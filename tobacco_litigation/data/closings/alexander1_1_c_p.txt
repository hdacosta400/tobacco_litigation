 1            MR. SMITH:  Good afternoon.
 2            First of all, let me say on behalf of
 3       everybody, Ms. Earline Alexander, everyone else
 4       who's participated in this case, thank you for your
 5       jury service.
 6            Second of all, I want to tell you that I've
 7       been doing this a long time and this is the first
 8       time in which I can say a jury has literally lived
 9       climactically through an entire year in four days.
10       Monday was summer and today is winter.  Between them
11       we had spring and fall.  It has been cold in here
12       and you have hot in here and in between, and you
13       have been attentive and you have listened carefully,
14       and everyone on both sides appreciates it
15       dramatically.
16            A little over a week ago I stood before you and
17       I told you what this case would be about, that we'd
18       really be turning the light on some things that all
19       of you have learned in the last few weeks that most
20       Americans don't know, and that's what really went on
21       in the tobacco industry for the last 50 years.
22            But before I go to that, I want to go back and
23       kind of go to where we started, and that is to
24       explain, as the Court has just instructed you, this
25       is what is known as an Engle progeny case.  And by

 1       now you all know that term in a way you never knew
 2       when you came into this courtroom.
 3            And an Engle progeny case means that, as it
 4       relates to Mrs. Alexander, we have to determine, the
 5       first thing, whether or not her husband, John Paul
 6       Alexander, is a member of the Engle class.  And if
 7       he is a member of the Engle class, as you have been
 8       instructed and we will go over again, then certain
 9       things cover him and apply to his case and answer a
10       great number of questions in this case.
11            THE COURT:  Mr. Smith, let me ask you -- can
12       you see past the --
13            A JUROR:  No, Your Honor.
14            THE COURT:  They can't see you.
15            MR. SMITH:  They can't?
16            THE COURT:  If you want them to see that, you
17       go to move that.
18            MR. SMITH:  Yeah.  I'll move this this way,
19       then.  I was trying to keep it on the other side.
20            All right.  How is that?  Better?
21            Okay.  Thank you.
22            THE COURT:  Go ahead.
23            MR. SMITH:  So what do we have to do to
24       establish the Engle class?  Well, there are several
25       things we told you in the beginning that you'd have

 1       to decide, and they're really not going to have to
 2       be decided now.
 3            First of all, it's been stipulated that he was
 4       a resident and citizen.  It has also been stipulated  
 5       that R.J. Reynolds is -- produces the only product
 6       that harmed him in this case.
 7            Cigarettes contain nicotine.  You remember that
 8       stipulation.  And that Brown & Williamson, American
 9       Tobacco, all the brands that you've heard about, the
10       brands that caused his death, or the brands that
11       caused harm, if harm was caused, as the stipulation
12       would be, were all R.J. Reynolds'.  So that's not
13       before you.
14            And, finally, that he died of COPD caused by
15       smoking.  That's not in question.  Their expert and
16       our expert and the stipulation has been that that's
17       all been taken care of.
18            So we really are down to just one additional
19       qualification to put him in to the protections and
20       to give him the benefit of that class that was
21       established by the Florida Supreme Court based on a
22       trial that was conducted many years ago, and that is
23       was he addicted to cigarettes.  Because if he was
24       addicted, we don't have to prove that nicotine is
25       addictive.  Because if he was addicted, we know that

 1       nicotine is addictive because it's stipulated to and
 2       it's been ruled upon.
 3            So what do we have to prove?  That he was
 4       addicted.  And how do we do that?  Well, first of
 5       all, I told you and the Court has already instructed
 6       you that your greatest tool is your common sense and
 7       experience.
 8            This is a man who the evidence shows in this
 9       case, pretty much uncontroverted evidence, that
10       sometime before he was 13, when we know he was
11       smoking, and as early as eight, that we know when he
12       was talking to his daughter in the later months, the
13       last years of his life, he said, I've been smoking
14       since I was eight years old.
15            But we know that between eight and 13 years old
16       in Raiford, Florida, this was a man who started
17       smoking cigarettes.  We know that by the time he was
18       14 years old he was a regular smoker, and we know
19       that from the testimony of Mattie Davis, who was
20       then his -- when he was 16 and she was 16 they got
21       married in Raiford.
22            We know that he smoked without ever ceasing
23       smoking from what would have been 1941 or '42 until
24       sometime after 1996.  Those facts are not in
25       controversy.

 1            We know from medical records and we know from
 2       the testimony of the witnesses who put it together
 3       that he smoked an average of -- I think one of
 4       the -- one of them says one-and-a-half to three
 5       packs; one of them says two packs.  He's got
 6       testimony of people saying he smoked one-and-a-half
 7       packs.
 8            We know that he was, quote, a heavy smoker.  We
 9       know that not because of the evidence we've
10       contended; we know that their expert, their doctor,
11       when asked by Mr. Avera, was he a heavy smoker,
12       said, yes, he was a heavy smoker.  We know that.
13            We know that he had a habit of smoking and it
14       pretty well followed.  He smoked when he first got
15       up in the morning.  There was testimony from his 
16       daughter Jeanette that when he would get up and go
17       to the bathroom in the morning, he would get a
18       cigarette.
19            We know that he smoked at his breakfast table.
20       We know that he smoked when he went to work because
21       we have people who have known him and worked with
22       him in the past.  We know that he smoked all day,
23       and we know that he smoked when he came home at
24       night.
25            We know from the evidence in this case that he

 1       oftentimes lit one cigarette from the cigarette he
 2       was just finishing smoking.  We know that when he
 3       got home at night he smoked.  We know the ashtrays
 4       in the house remained full.  We know that he smoked
 5       until he went to bed now.
 6            We know he smoked in the house; we know he
 7       smoked in the car.  We know he smoked at breakfast;
 8       we know he smoked at night.  We know that, in fact,
 9       and it's uncontroverted, that he got up during the
10       night and would smoke a cigarette.  That's how much
11       this man smoked.
12            I submit to you that we will probably never
13       see -- the medical records show that he had a
14       60-plus pack year of smoking, pack years meaning
15       that's a measure that they give for smokers.  That's
16       an incredible number.  But the truth of the case --
17       of the matter is that he actually probably had
18       something more like a 90- to 100-pack year smoking
19       history in his life, a number we probably will never
20       see again.
21            We know that he was, in fact, in 1996 -- had a
22       stroke.  In 1996 when he went to the hospital he saw
23       two doctors, first in -- I think the first was one
24       at the end of December; he later sees one in early
25       January, Dr. Connor and Dr. Melvin.

 1            And you remember what was put up on the board
 2       before you.  And I want you to remember this, folks.
 3       At that time there wasn't any litigation, there
 4       wasn't any class being discussed, there wasn't any
 5       membership being discussed.  This were -- these were
 6       two doctors who were analyzing and diagnosing their
 7       patient.  And they diagnosed their patient under the
 8       international code 305.1, which both sides have
 9       agreed was nicotine dependence.
10            So before anybody had a lawyer and started
11       talking about a lawsuit, the medical treatment and
12       medical history -- your common sense would show you
13       a man smoked that long was nicotine-dependent.  But,
14       more importantly, the doctors who treated him at the
15       time said he was nicotine-dependent.
16            We know that we produced expert testimony from
17       Dr. Tonia Werner.  And Dr. Werner opined to you
18       that, yes, he was cigarette-addicted; yes, it does
19       not mean he loses all control; but it is -- as
20       Dr. Burns said in the first testimony that was
21       played to you, it is, in fact, something that makes
22       it untrue to say that someone is now smoking of
23       their own free will.  That is untrue according to
24       Dr. Burns and untrue according to Tonia Werner, in
25       the sense that you can stop, but it is a barrier to
 1       that ever happening.
 2            We know that even after he was treated and told
 3       by a doctor, according to his daughter, that, If you
 4       don't quit smoking, it's going to kill you.  He went
 5       home and he took his Doral cigarettes and put them
 6       up, and we know that even after he had been on a
 7       respirator she caught him smoking, because he
 8       continued to smoke even when facing death.
 9            We know all that.  That's the case for
10       addiction.
11            And what is their response to that?  They bring
12       in one expert who says, I don't believe he's
13       addicted.  This is an expert, Dr. Myers -- I want
14       you to remember the following.  This is an expert
15       who, 22 years after the Surgeon General of the
16       United States defined for this nation what addiction
17       was, he still doesn't agree with it.
18            This is an expert who gave an opinion that is
19       inconsistent with the position taken by his current
20       hospital group that he works for and inconsistent
21       with the prior university that he worked for.
22            This is a man who said -- and I -- I want you
23       to know I'm going to give the facts as I remember
24       them, but you remember them yourselves, but I know
25       you will remember this.  This is a man who said he

 1       didn't consider a chain smoker or a heavy smoker
 2       somebody who smoked, you know, two packs a day.  He
 3       wasn't even willing to say that a person would be
 4       addicted, when he was asked by Mr. Avera, Well, what
 5       if they smoked six packs a day?
 6            Well, they could be.  Not necessarily.
 7            Ladies and gentlemen, the weight of the
 8       evidence, based on your common sense, the medical
 9       history of the patient, what you've observed and
10       what you've heard from the witnesses, is that this
11       was a man who's been smoking for more than 60 years
12       at the time he became ill and even then couldn't
13       stop.  That is an addiction.  Under the DSM criteria
14       he was addicted.  That's the finding.  That's the
15       finding, we submit, you must make.
16            Now, if that happens and when that happens, we
17       then go the Engle criteria.  The Engle criteria,
18       which has been explained to you, but I want to go
19       over a couple of them --
20            Blow them up, just, please.
21            The first one you know, chronic obstructive
22       pulmonary disease.  That's all he had.  That's what
23       killed him.  Nobody questions it.
24            That nicotine in cigarettes is addictive, we
25       know that.  Even without that instruction, you have

 1       heard evidence of that and nobody controverts it
 2       today.  Although that's today.  We'll show in a few
 3       minutes that for 50 years they knew it was addictive
 4       and they denied it, even under oath to the United
 5       States Congress as late as 1994, that R.J. Reynolds
 6       and the other tobacco conspirators denied what they
 7       knew was the truth.
 8            Number 3, that the defendants placed cigarettes
 9       on the market that were defective and unreasonably
10       dangerous.  Now, for us to prevail, what we have to
11       show is that the fact that they put a cigarette on 
12       the market that was defective -- defective?  We
13       don't know the manner, as someone's suggested.  Yes,
14       what we do know is it's been found it was defective
15       and unreasonably dangerous.
16            Because of Engle, we don't have to prove the
17       defect, but you heard from Dr. Proctor early that
18       there were thousands of carcinogens that have been
19       identified.  There have been -- there is Rayfield
20       activity that's been identified.  There is tar
21       that's been known about in levels which we know
22       cause cancer and other lung-related diseases, and we
23       know that they have never -- really never
24       effectively been removed.
25            We know that filters were a fraud.  We know

 1       that light cigarettes were actually a boon because
 2       you got the benefit of selling the light cigarette
 3       with the nicotine so that people would actually
 4       consume more nicotine -- more cigarettes to get more
 5       nicotine.  And we know that low-tar cigarettes have
 6       not proven to be more safe as it relates especially
 7       to COPD.  Those facts are known.
 8            Now, someone said, Well, what do you mean by
 9       defective and unreasonably dangerous?  What about --
10       well, let me give you an example.  If you're driving
11       down the road and the brakes don't work, your car
12       has got a defect.  It's unreasonably dangerous.  And
13       nobody would question if somebody put the brake in
14       or if they knew that the brake was put in wrong or
15       that they knew the brake didn't work or they knew
16       the speedometer -- excuse me, the accelerator stuck,
17       it would be defective and dangerous.
18            The defective and dangerous cigarette killed
19       him.  And how do we know that?  Because their own
20       expert says he died of COPD caused by smoking.  It's
21       what was in the smoke that caused the COPD that
22       killed him.
23            That the -- that the defendants concealed or
24       omitted material information not otherwise known or
25       made -- or available, knowing that the material was

 1       false or misleading, or failed to disclose a
 2       material fact concerning the health effects or
 3       addictive nature.
 4            We'll get to those.  I'll remind you of some of
 5       the false and misleading things they've done.  But
 6       remember this.  You've heard the instruction.
 7       They're going to get up and say, But you've got to
 8       show that that's what -- what you have to show is
 9       that if he had knowledge, it was less than they had.
10       And if their concealment of information was less
11       than what he -- what was concealed and what he knew
12       was less than what they concealed and what they
13       knew, if he didn't know of the material information
14       and they did, then that's causation.
15            That the defendants agreed to conceal or omit
16       information regarding the health effects of
17       cigarettes or their addictive nature with the
18       intention that smokers and the public would rely on
19       this information to their detriment.
20            The Supreme Court has found that if he's a
21       member of this class, you may now apply the law that
22       says they did it and they intended to do it for the 
23       purpose of making sure that people would rely on the
24       information to their detriment, that they misled the
25       public and they intended for the public to be

 1       misled, and that people just like John Paul
 2       Alexander, and we will show you John Paul Alexander,
 3       were victims of that concealment.
 4            And, again, the question you will read and was
 5       read to you is:  Did he have less information than
 6       they had?  And of course he did.
 7            That all of the defendants sold and supplied
 8       cigarettes that were defective.  In this case it's
 9       only RJR that matters.  And that all of the
10       defendants were negligent.
11            They were negligent in how they produced the
12       cigarette.  They were negligent in what they didn't
13       disclose.  It has been determined they were
14       negligent.
15            And if you find that that negligence, failing
16       to disclose information, failing to improve the
17       cigarette, failing -- whatever that negligence was,
18       if that negligence was a cause of a defective
19       cigarette, was a cause of the danger, was a cause of
20       misleading, then that is a cause of his injury.
21            Ladies and gentlemen, I want to go very briefly
22       back and remind you of some of the things that I
23       think are important.  But before I go there, very
24       quickly, we have an issue in this case called the
25       statute of limitations.

 1            Now, the difference on the statute of
 2       limitations is, they're saying, Okay.  Smoking
 3       killed him, and -- smoking killed him, our
 4       cigarettes killed him and caused COPD, but he knew
 5       or he should have known that -- and, by the way,
 6       it's not going to be -- read the instruction given.
 7       It says that he knew he had COPD or he reasonably
 8       should have known -- not could have known, should
 9       have known -- he had COPD caused by smoking.
10            Now, that's an interesting argument for them to
11       make, because, remember, in 1990 R.J. Reynolds was
12       still denying publicly that COPD was caused by
13       cigarette smoking.  But they want you to think that
14       this man, who their own expert says -- their own
15       expert yesterday says didn't know about COPD or
16       emphysema or chronic bronchitis till sometime
17       in '96, because how would he have otherwise known
18       it?
19            We're talking about a man who maybe had a
20       fifth-grade education, maybe read at a third-grade
21       level, who was diagnosed as unable to read, at least
22       on one of his times being put in the hospital.  They
23       say that that man should have known that he had
24       COPD, even though they -- there's nothing to suggest
25       that he knew what COPD or emphysema or chronic

 1       bronchitis even was.
 2            They say, Yeah, but he had a cough.  Well,
 3       according to the witnesses he's had a cough on and
 4       off throughout his life for some -- from the 1950s,
 5       and according to the expert testimony that you heard
 6       in the beginning about "of all people who have a
 7       cough, only 20 percent ever develop a lung disease."  
 8       So, consequently, that wouldn't have told him that
 9       there was any change in his life.
10            But let's go to what the facts are that we know
11       as to the condition he was in according to the
12       evidence in this case.
13            Go to Fayson, please.
14            You heard from Mr. Fayson.  This is
15       Mr. Fayson's testimony.
16            "How often did you work -- how often did you
17       work with him, fix cars, in the '90s?"
18            "About three days a week sometimes.  Sometimes
19       he just came to pick me up at home."
20            "And, once again, how did you get
21       transportation to the job?"
22            "Down to the job?"
23            "Yeah."
24            "Mr. Paul took me."
25            "And earlier than the '90s had you at times

 1       worked with him?"
 2            "Earlier -- early in the '90s?"
 3            "Earlier than the 1990s."
 4            "He taught me how to fix cars.  That's it.  You
 5       know, something wrong with my car, I could ask him."
 6            "Did you observe him smoke cigarettes?"
 7            "Yes."
 8            "Did you happen to know the brand?"
 9            "Salem."
10            "Okay.  Do you know how much he smoked?"
11            Go to the next section, please, and then cut
12       down to here.
13            "Now, was he able to do the work fixing cars in
14       the '90s?"
15            "Well, until he got sick about '95, as I know
16       of."
17            "Before that did you ever notice him not being
18       able to do his job?"
19            "No."
20            "Did he ever complain to you that he was sick?"
21            "No."
22            "Did he ever say anything about being sick?"
23            "No."
24            Go to Mr. Hines, please.
25            You heard from Jack Hines.  Now, these aren't

 1       people aren't family.  They aren't -- these are
 2       people that were his friends a long time ago or his
 3       co-workers.
 4            "Did he ever complain to you" -- you know,
 5       Mr. Hines is the one they say, Well, he noticed he
 6       was short of breath one time at the back fence.
 7       That's their evidence.
 8            "Did he ever complain to you about being short
 9       of breath?"
10            "No, sir."
11            "When he would work, how would you describe the
12       kind of work he was doing?"
13            "He was working on sometimes engines and
14       tune-ups, a timing change.  He kept working
15       tirelessly.  He always worked."
16            "And do you recall visiting him, seeing him
17       working on cars, after 1990?"
18            "Yes, sir." 19            "How would you describe his energy level?"
20            Go to the next section.
21            "Were you able to watch him do work from time
22       to time?"
23            "Yes."
24            "And were you able to talk with him and watch
25       him walk and talk from time to time?"

 1            "Yes, sir."
 2            "Even in the early '90s, how would you describe
 3       that he appeared in terms of his energy?"
 4            Answer:  "He had high energy."
 5            Go to Mr. Carnegie, please.
 6            "When you saw him after you had returned from
 7       the military, other than adjusting for age, how did
 8       his health appear to you?"
 9            "I'd say he was very ill -- very well, but he
10       had slowed down a little bit.  He wasn't moving as
11       fast.  He slowed down."
12            "It had been 20-something years by then,
13       right?"
14            "Yes."
15            Go on.
16            "Did you ever observe -- do you remember
17       observing him at any time you saw him coughing?"
18            "Somewhere -- it was back during the time when
19       I got back.  He was with Duncan back there in the
20       house.  He had a cough and his voice had changed a
21       little bit."
22            "Did you notice him in any other way being
23       ill?"
24            "No."
25            "Did you notice it affected his ability to do

 1       work?"
 2            "No, it didn't."
 3            "Did he ever comment to you that he wasn't
 4       feeling well?"
 5            "No."
 6            Now, since that's the evidence you have in
 7       front of you, that in the 1990s he was working, but
 8       we have their expert, who if you remember yesterday
 9       when I read his testimony, their expert,
10       Dr. Stueck --
11            Depo, please.
12            Dr. Stueck, when he was preparing his
13       testimony, he called him -- this is his -- what he
14       said.
15            "In the past I think you have" -- question --
16       "actually have" -- well, before I do that, sorry.  I
17       left a thought.
18            "On Mr. Carnegie, the fact that he -- 'he'
19       meaning John Alexander -- was quite successful as a
20       mechanic, what importance was that to you?"
21            "By quite successful I mean successful in the
22       expectations we would have for someone doing
23       that" --
24            Go on.
25            -- "kind of work.  Well, he was a person of

 1       some intelligence, some -- he was put in somewhat of
 2       a managerial position.  He was a person of some
 3       responsibility."  
 4            I'll go down.
 5            "He essen- -- yeah, I think that if you combine
 6       what Carnegie says to the fact that after he left
 7       his last job with the service station he essentially
 8       opened up his own business in his yard, which was
 9       auto mechanic, it shows considerable well-skilled,
10       initiative, you know, entrepreneurial, I suppose,
11       ambition.
12            "Part of my reaction to the Carnegie deposition
13       was in combination with the other information about
14       his, in effect, having his own business there in,
15       what was it, the late '80s or the early '90s about
16       his home."
17            We know that he worked for -- one of the last
18       gas stations he worked for in the late '80s was
19       Napoleon Filer.  We asked Mr. Filer, "Did he ever
20       complain about being sick?"
21            "No."
22            "How did he work?"
23            "Energetic, high energy."
24            "Did you ever know him to be sick and unable to
25       do a job?"

 1            "No."
 2            What did Mr. Filer say about him?  Mr. Filer
 3       said, "I didn't know he was sick until I learned he
 4       was sick after I went by to see him.  I never knew
 5       he was sick."
 6            That's the evidence in this case.  And on that,
 7       when no one was around him -- you know, think about
 8       it.  R.J. Reynolds has taken everybody's deposition
 9       they could find, every family member they could
10       find, anything they could find.  And you know what?
11       They never got the silver bullet.
12            Not one person has ever said that man, before
13       1996 said, I don't feel well.  We know we have the
14       records in 1996.  You'll note they want you to
15       speculate, Well, yeah, but there's some -- some
16       history of COPD.
17            Nothing that we know of.  We never found it.
18       We do know this, that no one has ever said,
19       certainly before 1990, that this man was sick,
20       looked sick, acted sick or said he was sick.  It's a
21       false issue.  And it's their burden of proof on that
22       issue.
23            I want to go very quickly to some other issues
24       in the case.  First of all, I want to talk about --
25       we talked about, and you heard Dr. Proctor and you

 1       saw Dr. Proctor and you heard Dr. Kyriakoudes.
 2       You've heard it at length about 1953, tobacco was in
 3       a panic, they had a meeting in New York, and here's
 4       what they said.
 5            37, please.
 6            They got with the research directors --
 7            Go to the next page, please.
 8            They got to the research directors, and what's
 9       the first thing the first research directors -- of
10       the four research directors they interviewed for
11       Hill & Knowlton, the top PR firm, they said -- one
12       of the men said, "It's fortunate for us that
13       cigarettes are a habit they can't break."  That's
14       the first thing said after they got together. 
15            What do we know happened next?  Well, we know
16       that they started coming up with reasons --
17            Go to the next highlighted section, please.
18            Go to the next -- next document, I think 39,
19       please.
20            VIDEO TECH OPERATOR:  39?
21            MR. SMITH:  39.
22            We know this.  We know that in February of
23       1953 -- go to the highlighted section.
24            In February of 1953 Claude Teague -- and, by
25       the way, he wasn't a man, as it was suggested, with

 1       a typewriter and a file and an idea.  He was a man
 2       that, if you remember the documents, he rose to some
 3       level towards vice president.  We know this, that he
 4       was with the company for some 30 years, because
 5       we've got documentation of him -- of his
 6       communications and research over a 30-year period of
 7       time.  And we know that -- even before they met in
 8       1953, we know that they knew there was an
 9       etiological likelihood of lung cancer caused by
10       cigarettes.  That's before they got together.
11       That's before the Wynder report really had hit the
12       news.
13            Go to the next document, please, Number...
14            Oh, I want to switch gears for just one second.
15       I want to go back and talk about something else
16       about the tobacco companies.
17            We know that their strategy was, from 1953 on,
18       to create a false controversy, to create a sense of
19       doubt.  And we know from the experts, Dr. Stueck,
20       and we even know from the expert Dr. Truncale that
21       they had people in the 1980s, they had people in the
22       1990s saying things that they weren't -- that
23       weren't true.
24            Now, what do we know they were about?  Well,
25       let's talk a little bit about the issue of --

 1            Go to Number 40, please.
 2            Number 40.  This is one of the first things
 3       they came up with.  This is literally a couple days
 4       after the meeting.  This is just an example of many,
 5       many that we put in and many that were heard in
 6       Engle.  This is an example.  Claude Teague, in one
 7       of his first jobs, ideas is, Well, I've got an idea.
 8       Have you noticed when people look at cigarette
 9       filter tips, if it turns colors they tend to think
10       it filters out things?  "While the use of such color
11       change material would probably have little or no
12       effect on the actual efficiency of the filter tip
13       material, the advertising and sales advantages are
14       obvious."
15            That's what their thinking was right away.  And
16       how do we know that the filter tip was false?
17       Because we know that in 1957 there were hearings in
18       front of the United States Congress resulting in the
19       1958 false advertising document that you have in
20       here in which the United States Congress said they
21       have been making false health claims for years, and
22       on the filter tip they are -- Americans are buying
23       into this and it is a false claim.  And they
24       actually criticized the FTC for not being more
25       aggressive. 3007
 1            I asked Dr. Stueck, Don't they -- didn't they
 2       even have, before 1957, a long history of false and
 3       misleading advertising?
 4            And their expert said, yes, based on what he
 5       had observed, they did have a long history of making
 6       false health claims about their product.
 7            Go to the next document, which is Number 92,
 8       please.
 9            And it worked.  What happened?  1957 -- 1956,
10       sales went up.  They went up all the way through
11       1964 without a bleep.  They increased at record
12       levels.  And why?  Because they advertised and they
13       targeted their advertising.
14            And what were the companies back then?  Lucky
15       Strike, Camel, Pall Mall.  Those were the three that
16       were the most advertised.  Those were the three that
17       led in sales.  And those were the three that were
18       smoked by Mr. Alexander.
19            But we know some other things that came out
20       during that time period.  We know that they lied
21       about addiction.
22            Go to Document Number 136, please.
23            1959, a study, 1959, by Philip Morris,
24       internal -- one of the co-conspirators in this case,
25       as you know.

 1            Next page, please.
 2            Study on the reasons people smoke.  Addiction.
 3       Their words.
 4            Then jumped up and said, Well, what -- let's go
 5       to a Philip Morris document, 1959, Document
 6       Number 138.
 7            Go to the highlighted section, please.
 8            What did Mr. Rodgman for R.J. Reynolds say,
 9       1959?  "The physiological requirements of the smoker
10       with respect to nicotine can be met by the
11       application of the optimum amount of nicotine to the
12       extracted tobacco."
13            163, please.
14            Next highlighted section, please.
15            This is tobacco.  This is a Brown & Williamson
16       document.  This is in 1961.  "Smoking demonstrably
17       is a habit based on a combination of psychological
18       and physiological pleasure, and it also has strong
19       indications of being an addiction.  It differs in
20       important features from addiction to other alkaloid
21       drugs, but yet there are sufficient similarities to
22       justify stating that smokers are nicotine addicts."
23            Next -- and go to 4- -- to 489, please.
24            Years later, a study for RJR, "Realistically,
25       if our company is to survive and prosper over the

 1       long term, we must get our share of the youth
 2       market."
 3            And guess what?  They wanted to tailor a
 4       cigarette to the youth market.
 5            Next highlighted section.
 6            "In contrast, once that learning period is
 7       over, the physical effects become of overriding
 8       importance and desirability to the confirmed smoker
 9       and the psychological effects, except the
10       tension-relieving effects, largely wane." 
11            In other words, they start smoking for the
12       psychology of it, but we get them hooked on the
13       physiology of it and then we have them.
14            And what did they say?  All of these years they
15       know --
16            Go to -- I think it's 538, please.
17            538.  This is a document much later.  Question
18       comes up.  Man writes a letter, said, I'm
19       particularly interested in knowing if nicotine has
20       any habit-forming properties.
21            And what is the answer?
22            Go to the next section, please.
23            Next section, please.
24            Alan Rodman, RJR.  "The two questions" -- this
25       is about nicotine addiction -- "are answerable, but

 1       briefly, I doubt whether we at RJR want to be on the
 2       record with the answers."
 3            That's what the American people were getting
 4       from tobacco companies.
 5            And how long did they keep it up?
 6            Go to 976, please.
 7            How long, after all they knew?  1994, United
 8       States Congress.  After all the addiction materials
 9       that you've seen in the internal documents that they
10       never released to the public, this is what they
11       still said:
12            (Videotape was played:)
13            REPRESENTATIVE WYDEN:  "Let me begin my
14       questioning on the matter of whether or not nicotine
15       is addictive.  Let me ask you first, and I'd like to
16       go down the row, whether each of you believes that
17       nicotine is not addictive.  I heard virtually all of
18       you touch on it.  Just yes or no.
19            "Do you believe nicotine is not addictive."
20            MR. CAMPBELL:  "I believe nicotine is not
21       addictive, yes."
22            REPRESENTATIVE WYDEN:  "Mr. Johnston?"
23            MR. J. JOHNSTON:  "Mr. Congressman, cigarettes
24       and nicotine clearly do not meet the classic
25       definitions of addiction.  There is no

 1       intoxication."
 2            REPRESENTATIVE WYDEN:  "We'll take that as a
 3       'no.'  And, again, time is short.  If you can
 4       just -- I think each of you believe is nicotine is
 5       not addictive.  We just would like to have" --
 6            (Videotape was stopped.)
 7            MR. SMITH:  And every one of them said it.  You
 8       heard it.  No.  After all the documents going back
 9       at least to 1959, they still couldn't tell the truth
10       to the American public about the addiction to their
11       product.
12            And you know we know -- we know that the TIRC
13       was a public relations gesture --
14            215, please.
15            We know that the TIRC was a public relations
16       gesture because, well, this strictly private and
17       confidential document --
18            Go to the next page, please.
19            "The TIRC cannot, in my opinion, provide the
20       vehicle for such research.  It was conceived as a
21       public relations gesture, however undefiled the 
22       scientific advisory board and its grants may be."
23            This is a year before the '64 Surgeon General's
24       Report.
25            "It has functioned as a public relations

 1       operation.  However -- moreover, its organization,
 2       certainly in its present form, does not allow the
 3       breadth of research -- cancer, emphysema, et
 4       cetera -- essential to the protection of" -- not the
 5       American public -- "the tobacco industry."
 6            Go to the next section, please.
 7            Next section, please.
 8            And then -- back.  Right there.
 9            And then they say, you know, Good things, bad
10       things.  There is a problem.  Moreover, nicotine is
11       addictive.  Then they say, Then there are some side
12       problems, and I think they have certain unattractive
13       side effects.  They may true -- well be truly
14       causative in emphysema, et cetera.
15            What they know, they knew it in 1963, before
16       the first Surgeon General's report.  They knew it
17       may truly well be a cause of emphysema.
18            In 1984 the Surgeon General issued a COPD
19       Surgeon General's Report.  It said absolutely COPD
20       was caused by smoking.  And what did the industry
21       say?  Well, their -- their president got on and
22       said, and the industry said through their documents,
23       which we had Dr. Stueck read -- we had Dr. Stueck
24       read it, and he said it's misleading when they said
25       that COPD had not yet been confirmed.  It had long

 1       been confirmed, but they continued to deny it.
 2            The only time they didn't want to deny the link
 3       would be, well, now, when they want to say, We were
 4       denying it in the '80s, but Mr. Alexander should
 5       have known.
 6            We know that they targeted kids.
 7            Go to 474, please.  Top of the page, please.
 8            We know they targeted children.  We know that
 9       they let -- that they --
10            518, please.
11            1975.  "Our paramount objective in '75 is to
12       reestablish our share of the marketing growth."  You
13       saw the documents when they were worried about
14       Marlboro taking their share of the 14-to-20-year-old
15       market.  That was in '75, '76 and '77.  We know that
16       they let their legal department override their
17       scientists.
18            611, please.
19            You remember this.  Doctor -- they wanted to do
20       research.  Legal said, No, we can't do research.  We
21       asked what's mutagenicity?  Mutagenicity's the study
22       of cancer.
23            Go to 612, please.
24            So the doctor, he -- he, frankly, wanted to do
25       the research.  What happened?  "In accordance with

 1       legal's wishes -- wishes and reasons, permission to
 2       examine the mutagenicity of smoke condensate
 3       fractions and denicotinized tobacco smoke condensate
 4       is refused."
 5            Legal ran the research department.
 6            Go to 1322, please.  
 7            And this is my favorite.  This is their --
 8       their in-house counsel writing to their general
 9       counsel about their new head of research.  Now, you
10       remember they said, But we did the mutagenicity
11       studies.
12            Well, wait a second.  In 1982 Dr. DeMarco had a
13       meeting with the in-house counsel, who's writing his
14       boss, the general counsel, Mr. Witt.
15            Drop down, please.
16            "During his law department orientation he said
17       that he thinks it's essential for R&D to work on the
18       development of a less mutagenic cigarette."
19            But they come back and they say, We can't do
20       that, because that would mean we were admitting --
21       by saying that we were working on a less mutagenic,
22       we'd be admitting that there was a mutagen, and we
23       can't do that.
24            "He seemed to" -- "He seemed to understand our
25       concern, but refused it -- to accept it as a

 1       rationale for not doing what he felt we had an
 2       obligation to do as a responsible manufacturer."
 3            Next section, please.
 4            "During his orientation he stated he wanted to
 5       spend more time talking to us about the
 6       state of the art on cancer.  He said that in his
 7       view the state of the art has developed over the
 8       past 20 years to the point where he thought our
 9       legal defense was or near perilously close to
10       obsolete."
11            That means that he knew as early as --
12       certainly since '62, but by '82 they knew that their
13       position on the harmfulness of their cigarettes was
14       obsolete.
15            But did it change?  No.
16            Next section, please.
17            And then my favorite.  And I want you to
18       remember this as tobacco talks about experts they've
19       presented again.
20            "He also said, though I can't recall exact
21       words, that our medical scientific witnesses will
22       say whatever we want them to say, clearly implying,
23       if not stating, that they lack credibility and
24       integrity."
25            That's one lawyer to another lawyer in a memo

 1       they thought we'd never see.
 2            We know that they also targeted African
 3       American smokers.  We know that they targeted them
 4       for menthol cigarettes.  We know they targeted them
 5       for menthol cigarettes in the following way.
 6            599, please.  Go to the highlighted section,
 7       please.
 8            Salem was in competition with Kool.  And what
 9       were they in competition for?  They were about the
10       menthol brand.
11            Next highlight, please.
12            Black market, market importance.  "The Black
13       market comprises 9.6 percent of total volume."  They
14       were talking about targeting the black market.
15            Go to the next section, please.
16            They're talking about Salem and Kool fighting
17       for market share. 18            Next section, please.
19            And then they were talking --
20            Go on to the next section, please.
21            And how did that battle go forward?
22            644, please.
23            VIDEO TECH OPERATOR:  There's no 644.
24            MR. SMITH:  I'm sorry.  1349, please.
25            The black menthol cigarette market.  "Kool's

 1       success in the Black market started in the mid-'60s,
 2       was responsible for the brand, eventually catching
 3       up with then passing Salem in volume share in 1972."
 4            You heard the testimony.  Menthol cigarettes
 5       were aimed at black smokers.  They marketed to black
 6       smokers who didn't read well.  They did it by going
 7       into grocery stores, gas stations, liquor stores.
 8            Go to the next section, please.
 9            That's where they saw the growth.  "Of
10       particular significance is the fact that Salem's
11       Black market growth between '76 and '78 came largely
12       from its Lights spin-off."
13            Next section, please.
14            Next section, please.
15            They identified the market they were after,
16       functionally illiterate African Americans.
17            Next section, please.
18            They function -- they said, We know that they
19       buy in small groceries, service stations, liquor
20       stores and vending machines, and they devised a
21       strategy -- next section, please -- to go after that
22       market, and they said, We know menthol cigarettes
23       are more popular with blacks than the general
24       smoking public.
25            Next section, please.

 1            More than a fifth of all -- of all black
 2       adults, 50 percent of black smokers, smoke menthol
 3       cigarettes.
 4            Next section, please.
 5            And why did they -- did they sell black -- and
 6       what was part of their message?  "Before the
 7       introduction of Lights, Black menthol smokers to a
 8       greater degree than their White counterparts
 9       believed menthol cigarettes were less hazardous,
10       irritating, than other cigarettes."
11            As a matter of fact, that's why they thought
12       they were doing so well.  And they marketed to them,
13       and guess what?  J.P. Alexander switched in the mid-
14       to late '60s to what?  Menthol cigarettes.  He
15       continued to smoke menthol cigarettes during the
16       entire period in which they targeted people who
17       absolutely met his demographic.
18            And they targeted them knowing that part of the
19       belief was that they assumed that they were less
20       hazardous or irritating.  But, in fact, the real
21       effect was, as we know -- and this we've heard from
22       the evidence -- that they caused significant health
23       problems.
24            You know, very quickly, I'd like to go to 697.
25       This is one of my favorite documents.  I hope you'll

 1       remember it.
 2            Next section, please.  
 3            This is a -- one of the Tobacco Institute
 4       people talking to another guy in The Tobacco
 5       Institute, and he realized he missed a meeting where
 6       they started talking about how addictive -- the
 7       addictive nature of their product.  And he said,
 8       "But I don't think the questions I now raise are
 9       academic."  Shook Hardy.  That was the law firm
10       representing tobacco in those days.  "I am told that
11       the entire matter of addiction is the most potent
12       weapon of a prosecuting -- a prosecuting attorney
13       can have in a lung cancer cigarette case.  We can't
14       defend smoking as free choice if the person was
15       addicted."
16            That's what's The Tobacco Institute was saying
17       to The Tobacco Institute.  But today they'll stand
18       here, a challenge.  They'll stand here today and
19       say, It's free choice, free will --
20            MR. KACZYNSKI:  Objection, Your Honor.
21            MR. SMITH:  -- addiction doesn't matter.
22            MR. KACZYNSKI:  May we approach?
23            (A sidebar conference was held outside the
24   hearing of the jury as follows:)
25            MR. KACZYNSKI:  Your Honor, I object to any

 1       inference, and it was more than an inference, to my
 2       client's defense of these cases as part of something
 3       continuing toward us saying it's free choice at this
 4       point.  My argument is that this is just a
 5       continuation of what those documents show.  It's
 6       improper.
 7            MR. SMITH:  I don't think it's improper.
 8            MR. KACZYNSKI:  It's grossly improper.  And I'm
 9       not moving for a mistrial now, but if it continues I
10       will.
11            MR. SMITH:  It's not improper.  All I'm
12       saying --
13            THE COURT:  I understand your contention is
14       it's improper because of what?
15            MR. KACZYNSKI:  Because what he is saying that
16       in defense of this case it was Mr. Alexander's
17       choice to smoke is part and parcel of some
18       conspiracy that takes them back into these documents
19       that the defense of this case is somehow tortious.
20            MR. SMITH:  I disagree with that.
21            THE COURT:  Defense of the case is somehow
22       tortious?
23            MR. SMITH:  I haven't charged that, but I have
24       said that is what they knew back then and that's
25       what they'll say now, even now.

 1            MR. KACZYNSKI:  Then I rest my case.
 2            MR. SMITH:  It's not inappropriate.
 3            THE COURT:  I don't think it's inappropriate,
 4       Mr. Kaczynski.
 5            MR. KACZYNSKI:  Okay, Your Honor.
 6            (The sidebar conference was concluded, and the
 7   following proceedings were held:)
 8            THE COURT:  Mr. Smith, you've consumed 40
 9       minutes.  I don't know if you want --
10            MR. SMITH:  I've got five more minutes of my
11       part, and then I'll be turning it over to my
12       partner.
13            I want to go to -- well, I'm going to leave out 
14       the verdict form part, because time passes so fast.
15            You know, I want to tell you that perhaps the
16       best measure of how truthful R.J. Reynolds has been
17       with the American people -- now, we know this.  We
18       know that -- Anne Browder got on and said, We don't
19       pay for movie placement.  You saw the contracts
20       for -- we just picked one, Sylvester Stallone.  We
21       know that they came off of television in 1971
22       because they didn't like the access problem they had
23       because of the Fairness Doctrine.  We know that they
24       doubled their advertising and promotion budget after
25       they went on television, that they became the

 1       greatest point of purchaser -- marketer in the
 2       history of the world.  We know that.
 3            We know, and it's uncontroverted, that,
 4       actually, it even affected John Paul Alexander in
 5       one way.  Do you remember Mr. Carnegie saying, You
 6       know, I do remember something.  They used to bring
 7       these posters by.  And I put a poster up and this
 8       guy had this hat and he had this cigarette, and I
 9       used to say, That's why you smoke, because you look
10       like that guy, and he thought that guy looked cool.
11            Remember that?  That's the testimony of
12       Mr. Carnegie.  That's what happened everywhere.  You
13       don't have to read well to see an image and for that
14       image to work with you.
15            Go to 8- -- 688, please.
16            We know under 688 in 1980 the then president,
17       Mr. Horrigan, was getting a memo.  He was real
18       worried because they were losing their market share
19       of those critical 14-to-17-year-olds.  Marlboro Man
20       was beating them.
21            But when he was asked on television, on
22       Nightline --
23            820, please.
24            When he was asked about whether or not they
25       supported cigarette smoking by minors, this is what

 1       he says:
 2            (Videotape was played:)
 3            TED KOPPEL:  "Joining us live now from Station
 4       WFMY in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, is Edward
 5       Horrigan, Jr., chairman of the board of the
 6       R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.
 7            "Cigarette smoking does not cause cancer, yes
 8       or no?"
 9            MR. HORRIGAN:  "It is not known whether
10       cigarettes cause cancer."
11            TED KOPPEL:  "All right, sir."
12            MR. HORRIGAN:  "It has not been causally
13       established."
14            TED KOPPEL:  "Cigarette smoking -- no causal
15       relationship between cigarette smoking and
16       emphysema?"
17            MR. HORRIGAN:  "Despite all of the research to
18       date, there has been no causal link established."
19            TED KOPPEL:  "Well, I admire your honesty for
20       telling me that you don't smoke, but what I'm
21       asking, though, I guess, is let us give your
22       position the benefit of the doubt for a moment and
23       say that there is still some doubt.  And I must say
24       that successive Surgeons General for the past 
25       20 years would disagree with that, but let us do

 1       that.  If there is doubt, should we not be leading
 2       our children in the direction of not smoking?"
 3            MR. HORRIGAN:  "Yes.  In fact, as far as we --
 4       when I say yes, the cigarette industry's position is
 5       that young people should not smoke.  And" --
 6            (Videotape was stopped.)
 7            MR. SMITH:  Stop.
 8            But they were worried about that
 9       14-to-17-year-old market share they were losing.
10       That's how honest they've been with the American
11       people.
12            And by the way, did you hear him say in 1984 on
13       national TV it's not been linked to emphysema?  But
14       they charge that this man should have known in the
15       1980s.
16            Ladies and gentlemen, my time runs short.  I'm
17       going to turn this over to my partner.  But I want
18       you to remember this, that they have spent 50 years
19       lying about addiction, lying about the hazardousness
20       of smoking, lying about every disease.
21            They've opposed every Surgeon General's report,
22       every one.  You've heard them.  You watched them.
23       Every time the FTC would come out with a report,
24       including a report that said -- and remember the FTC
25       report.  That's Document 758.  How many tens of

 1       millions of people in the '80s still didn't know how
 2       dangerous cigarette smoking was?  How many tens of
 3       millions of people into the '80s didn't understand
 4       that chronic bronchitis and emphysema were caused
 5       almost exclusively by cigarette smoking?  And 34 to
 6       39 percent of the people had no idea that they would
 7       cause any cases of chronic bronchitis or emphysema.
 8            Ladies and gentlemen, this is a conspiracy.  It
 9       was done intentionally.  They had the knowledge.
10       They could have done other things.  They could have
11       made a safer product, but it wouldn't give them the
12       profit they wanted.  They could have stopped the
13       production and come up with something that would
14       have worked for them, but it would have cost them
15       profit.
16            They could have told the truth to the American
17       people, but it would have cost them profit.  So they
18       lied.
19            And this man was in that class of people that
20       was hurt because of what they did, the way they
21       created the cigarette, how they marketed the
22       cigarette, how they pushed their cigarette, and what
23       it did to him in a horrible death that he suffered.
24            My partner will talk about the damages that
25       have been suffered in this case.

 1            Thank you, Your Honor.
 
 
 2            MR. AVERA:  Earline Alexander was born in the
 3       beginning of the Great Depression.  She is 82 years
 4       old today.  She has no education.  She has never
 5       seen the inside of a classroom her entire life and
 6       has never seen the inside of a courthouse, much less
 7       a courtroom, since stepping into this building last
 8       week.  She's worked her entire life.  She has very
 9       little but her worth and her integrity. 
 10            She has not lied to American families about the
11       dangers of smoking.  She has not, on the one hand,
12       spent hundreds of millions of dollars marketing and
13       advertising to American families to smoke a
14       cigarette the tobacco industry knew would kill its
15       customers, all at the same time they were whispering
16       out the other side of their mouth, Just keep
17       smoking.  Just keep smoking, folks.  If there's
18       anything harmful in it, we'll take it out.  Trust us
19       on that.  We will take it out.
20            She has not smeared or belittled reputable
21       scientists and medical doctors in their field of
22       specialty whose only endeavor was to seek out the
23       truth and the relationship between smoking and
24       diseases, emphysema, COPD, lung cancer, many others.
25            She has never sought to create a controversy

 1       where really none existed.  She has only tried to do
 2       what's right in her life, work hard, pay her bills,
 3       doing what's right, knowing the difference between
 4       right and wrong.
 5            Doing what's right is a claim that
 6       R.J. Reynolds Corporation will never be able to
 7       utter, think or place on a piece of paper because of
 8       its conduct during the last half of the 20th
 9       century.
10            Earline Alexander has only worked hard and was
11       there to be the caring wife for Paul Alexander
12       during those last three years when he so desperately
13       needed comfort and attention, when COPD slowly
14       robbed him of his breath and took his life, during
15       those three years when he needed her for better or
16       for worse, the words have meant something to Earline
17       Alexander.
18            Paul Alexander was simply a customer of
19       R.J. Reynolds.  He was taken from Earline by COPD, a
20       horrible disease, practically unheard of at the
21       beginning of the 20th century, a disease which
22       R.J. Reynolds denied was the cause -- was caused by
23       cigarette smoking until the end of the 20th century,
24       notwithstanding everything Mr. Smith just showed you
25       on that board.

 1            She watched her husband recover from a stroke
 2       in 1996 and slowly over time decline, dying from a
 3       disease that neither of them had ever heard of
 4       before 1996 and had certainly never heard of in the
 5       1980s.
 6            What should move us to action in matters like
 7       this is human dignity.  We, as a society, ladies and
 8       gentlemen, lose dignity if we are willing to
 9       tolerate the intolerable.
10            Manufacturing a nicotine delivery system in an
11       unreasonable, dangerous and defective manner and
12       giving it to American families, to adolescents, and
13       denying that there is any relationship between that
14       product and diseases that rob those customers, those
15       victims, of their dignity is evil and morally
16       corrupt.
17            Mrs. Alexander was there when John Paul
18       Alexander took sick in 1996.  When he slowly could
19       not breathe, she was there for him when she would
20       come home from work.  Other family was there when 
21       she was not.  She gave him her best to give him
22       comfort when he could not breathe.
23            During his last months she cleaned him when he
24       soiled himself, he could not toilet himself; fed him
25       when he could not feed himself; and watched his

 1       ability to breathe ebb slowly away.
 2            Paul was one, just one, of almost half a
 3       million -- half a million -- try to get that out --
 4       half a million Americans each year that die from
 5       smoking-related diseases.
 6            Smoking-related diseases are the number-one --
 7       is the number-one killer of Americans today and has
 8       been for decades.
 9            Paul is gone.  Earline is left.  She's never
10       really asked much -- for much in her life.  Maybe
11       there hasn't been much justice in a life that
12       doesn't have an education.  But hopefully,
13       hopefully, Mrs. Alexander will learn a lesson during
14       these two weeks, and that lesson is, is that a jury
15       will come together, citizens from her community, and
16       decide the conduct that cannot be tolerated, will
17       not be tolerated, in this community.
18            She will learn that a jury will come together
19       and hear the evidence and decide that they will not
20       tolerate an industry that makes a product such as
21       the one that R.J. Reynolds makes, bring experts to
22       trial and look you in the eye and deny the obvious.
23            And she will watch you measure her loss.  And
24       how should you do that?  Our system, ladies and
25       gentlemen, can only allow for money damages.  We

 1       abandoned an eye for an eye a long, long time ago.
 2            One measure may be what R.J. Reynolds is
 3       willing to pay an expert witness, 4-, $500 an hour,
 4       not an atypical amount.  There were other experts in
 5       this case for the plaintiff as well who were paid
 6       that much or more.  But experts that looked you in
 7       the eye and said such things as, I don't really know
 8       what you mean when you use the phrase "heavy
 9       smoker."  I don't agree with the statistics in the
10       DSM, the same manual that I'm using to determine
11       that John Paul Alexander was not addicted.
12            Experts who would look you in the eye and tell
13       you that their own employer was wrong about the
14       addictive qualities of nicotine.  An expert that
15       would disagree with the Surgeon General, C. Everett
16       Koop, of the United States; disagree with his own
17       employer, Jane Proffer at Brown University; disagree
18       with the University of South Florida, its training
19       materials that are used to train children about
20       tobacco prevention; look you in the eye and tell you
21       that just because somebody smokes two to three packs
22       a day does not mean they're a chain smoker, it's
23       going to take something more than that, four or five
24       packs a day, and even then somebody who smokes four
25       or five packs a day is not necessarily addicted to

 1       nicotine.
 2            A measure could be the price we place on
 3       inanimate objects.  Might be very simple to hear
 4       experts testify about the value of a painting or of
 5       a gem.  One expert says it's worth this many million  
 6       dollars; another expert says, No, it's this many
 7       million dollars.  But that's an inanimate object.
 8            A measure might be the millions we'll pay to a
 9       professional athlete whose really only skill is to
10       be able to bounce, hit or dribble a ball, and, yet,
11       we're willing to pay them millions of dollars a year
12       to do that.
13            A measure may be the hundreds of millions that
14       R.J. Reynolds and the tobacco industry spent over
15       the years to market to American families and to
16       advertise, all the while whispering to them, Just
17       keep smoking.  If there's anything bad in it, we'll
18       take it out for you.
19            Ladies and gentlemen, in measuring those
20       damages, it is only -- for whatever reason, we, as a
21       society, do not blink at the values of those
22       inanimate objects and we don't blink at the values
23       of professional athletes who make millions of
24       dollars in one year, and we don't blink at the
25       hundreds of millions that a corporation like

 1       R.J. Reynolds makes while marketing and advertising
 2       something that was not the truth.  But we throw our
 3       hands up in shock and surprise when we suggest that
 4       what Earline Alexander saw in those last three years
 5       of her husband's life is worth a couple million
 6       dollars.
 7            Human suffering has value, and all we can do in
 8       this case is to apply money damages.  Compensatory
 9       damages are to fix those things that can be fixed,
10       pay for harm that's been caused, make up for those
11       things that can't be fixed.  And 50 years of lies
12       can't be fixed.  Losing Paul cannot be fixed.
13            Mr. Kaczynski told you something in his opening
14       statement, that this case was about really one
15       thing, and that was giving Mrs. Alexander money.
16            True compensatory damages, her suffering and
17       watching her husband go through what he went through
18       and her being there with him are a significant part
19       of this case.  But as the evidence was laid out
20       before you over the last two weeks and you saw that
21       which almost all Americans have not seen, it may
22       have occurred to some of you that it was more about
23       their money, the money they were going to make over
24       50 years by not being honest with American families,
25       by creating controversy where there was none, by

 1       whispering to American families and adolescents,
 2       Just keep smoking.  Just keep smoking.  And if
 3       there's something bad in it, we'll take it out.
 4            I know that R.J. Reynolds wants to decide this
 5       case on choices.  I'm going to talk to you for just
 6       a couple of minutes about choices.  I want to get to
 7       the choices part of the verdict form.
 8            This is the verdict form which you'll see and
 9       these are the questions.  Before I talk about fault
10       and choices, I want to catch us up on the verdict
11       form.
12            The first question has to do with addiction.
13       And this is the question that determines whether
14       Mr. Alexander is a member of the Engle class or not.
15            Folks, everybody, you'll recall, was agreeable
16       and we all started out even on that scale and 
17       whoever tipped the scales in their favor would
18       prevail.  And everybody agreed that was acceptable,
19       and everyone agreed that they did not require any
20       greater burden of proof than that.  This one.
21       That's our burden.  We take that.
22            Mr. Smith has gone through the evidence
23       somewhat.  You were here.  You listened to the
24       defendant's expert, Dr. Myers.  You listened to the
25       plaintiff's expert, Dr. Werner.  I'm just going to

 1       ask you folks to apply your common sense in what you
 2       heard from those two experts, because you, as the
 3       trier of facts, are free to believe or disbelieve
 4       anything an expert tells you.
 5            I'm going to submit to you we're going to tip
 6       those scales.  I'm going to submit to you after the
 7       cross-examination of Dr. Myers was done we had
 8       slammed those scales up in our favor on the issue of
 9       addiction.  You should answer yes, because I suggest
10       it requires that, on Question Number 1.
11            Mr. Smith has gone over the causation issues,
12       and these, 2, 3, 4, 5, they all have to do with John
13       Paul Alexander doing exactly what the tobacco
14       industry wanted him to do during the decades that he
15       smoked.
16            They wanted him to smoke.  They didn't want him
17       to quit.  They wanted him to keep going to those
18       stores and buying those cigarettes over all those
19       decades, all the while whispering, by creating that
20       controversy, Now, folks, there's no direct
21       relationship here.  There's no proof here.  Just
22       keep smoking them.  We'll take it out, the bad
23       stuff, if we ever find out what it is.
24            On 2, 3, those questions should be answered
25       yes.

 1            4, Was R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's
 2       concealment or omission of material information
 3       about the health effects or addictive nature of
 4       smoking cigarettes or both a legal cause of John
 5       Paul Alexander's death?  The answer to that question
 6       must be yes.
 7            You've seen the evidence for yourselves.  Many
 8       of you may have come to this courthouse questioning
 9       whether the tobacco companies had really been
10       completely up front with the American public over
11       all those decades.  But now you know more.  Now you
12       know more than the folks who have not sat through
13       the evidence in a case such as this and have heard
14       what they did from the 1950s until the end of the
15       century.
16            Number 5, Was R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's
17       agreement with others to conceal or omit information
18       regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their
19       addictive nature a legal cause of John Paul
20       Alexander's death?  The answer to that question,
21       ladies and gentlemen, in weighing those scales, is
22       clearly yes.
23            How could it not be?  You've just seen the
24       internal documents where they absolutely refuse to
25       admit that which they should have been admitting to

 1       American families.  
 2            No one from the tobacco industry, and certainly
 3       not from R.J. Reynolds, ever stepped up and said,
 4       Folks, we want you to use our product, but there are
 5       a couple things you've got to know.  First, I want
 6       you to know they're addictive.  They are addictive.
 7       We've known they were addictive from the 1950s.  We
 8       want you to know that.  Two, they can kill you.
 9            But, no.  They created controversy.  They
10       belittled and besmirched respected scientists who
11       were only seeking the truth.  And they found it and
12       had found it by the late 1950s.  As Dr. Proctor told
13       you, there was no longer any controversy.
14            6, Mr. Smith has addressed that question.  I'm
15       not going to rehash that.  But 6 is the statute of
16       limitations defense.  That one should be answered
17       no.  You cannot find from this evidence that John
18       Paul Alexander knew or should have known before
19       May 5, 1990, that he had chronic obstructive
20       pulmonary disease and that there was a reasonable
21       possibility that his smoking caused COPD when --
22       when he had never heard of the disease, when he'd
23       never heard of emphysema, and it was at the same
24       time that the tobacco industry was telling Americans
25       that there was no correlation, no proof that smoking

 1       caused COPD.
 2            That argument should shock the conscience, that
 3       at the same time they expected a gentleman who went
 4       to school in the segregated schools of Union County
 5       in the 1930s, perhaps through the fifth grade,
 6       probably could not read, but if he could, very
 7       little, should have known that which R.J. Reynolds
 8       was denying in May of 1990.
 9            That's a no.  If it's yes, the case is over.
10       Earline leaves this courtroom.  Answering yes would
11       not be justice.
12            Number 7, that's going to be a question you
13       folks will debate.  The total has to be a hundred
14       percent.  That has to do with choices that I told
15       you that I was going to talk about.
16            It has always been argument that it's the
17       plaintiff's choice to smoke.  It's not really a free
18       choice when a child in the 1930s, late 1930s, early
19       1940s, decided to smoke.  That was the culture then.
20       Most people, most adults, by far, did smoke during
21       that period of time.  There's no information there
22       for a child to make that judgment.
23            Over subsequent decades R.J. Reynolds will tell
24       you that it was Mr. Alexander's decision to continue
25       to smoke during those same decades when they denied

 1       that nicotine was addictive.
 2            No one on behalf of the plaintiff has ever
 3       looked any of you folks in the eye and said that
 4       Mr. Paul Alexander had absolutely no control over
 5       his behavior.  It wouldn't make any common sense to
 6       say that.  He did.  At the same time that Dr. Myers
 7       was telling you that he had complete control of his
 8       smoking behavior, the very next thing that was on
 9       that screen was the Surgeon General's statement that
10       we know that addictive drugs, including nicotine,
11       they do affect one's control.
12            That's what happened in Paul Alexander's case 
13       and in millions of other Americans' cases.  When
14       they tell you the statistic 55 percent of
15       Americans -- 45 percent of Americans quit long-term,
16       that means that 55 percent are never able to quit
17       after repeated quit attempts, and those that do quit
18       long-term, typically six to seven quit attempts,
19       many of them using help, patches, gum and the like.
20            The easiest way to address fault here, ladies
21       and gentlemen, is what is the information that the
22       two sides had available to them?  Did R.J. Reynolds
23       have five times more information than Paul Alexander
24       about cigarettes, about nicotine addiction?  Did
25       they have ten times more information, 50 times more

 1       information?  And did R.J. Reynolds not tell the
 2       truth to American families about all those issues?
 3            The tobacco industry and R.J. Reynolds are very
 4       uncomfortable with having to deal with their
 5       choices.  They would like it to be completely the
 6       smoker's choice.  And you will have to consider
 7       those choices by Paul Alexander.
 8            When an 82-year-old woman comes into court
 9       courageously and says, Folks, using my common sense,
10       I'm going to tell you that my husband shared some of
11       the fault here, but only partially, then it's time
12       for the folks that made their choices in the
13       corporate board rooms to step up and take
14       responsibility, as well.
15            I'm going to suggest to you that because Paul
16       Alexander's choices came about as a result of human
17       frailty, his decision to smoke, his inability to
18       stop, no quit attempts until there at the very end,
19       that's human frailty, ladies and gentlemen.
20            Their decisions?  You just saw the documents.
21       They didn't care about American families.  They
22       cared about the tobacco industry.  That's avarice.
23       That's greed.  That's evil.  That's a completely
24       different kind of choice.  And for making those
25       choices, you should place 80 percent of the

 1       responsibility with R.J. Reynolds.  They had at
 2       least four times the amount of information that John
 3       Paul Alexander did.
 4            Place a challenge to the company, because they
 5       will step up and they will say this is a hundred
 6       percent Mr. Alexander's fault.  They will not
 7       acknowledge one percent of fault.  They will place a
 8       hundred percent of the fault in the lap of Earline
 9       Alexander and at the foot of the grave of Paul
10       Alexander and take no responsibility for their
11       choices and their decisions.
12            As to damages, ladies and gentlemen,
13       Mrs. Alexander's life has been rich in some ways and
14       not in others.  You can't bring Paul back.  We know
15       that.  This is one of those things where there's
16       been a harm and they must pay for the harms that
17       they've caused.  There's nothing that the money
18       damages will fix.
19            You are to be guided by your own life
20       experiences in what is fair and just in light of the
21       evidence and what rings true with respect to your
22       common sense.
23            I'm going to suggest to you the sum of 
24       $2 million in past pain and suffering suffered by
25       Earline Alexander and $1 million in future, for a

 1       total of $3 million.  You are, of course, free to
 2       award more or less based on your evaluation, your
 3       life experience, your common sense and what is fair
 4       and just.
 5            If you answer Questions -- either Question 4 or
 6       5 yes, then you answer Question 9:  Under the
 7       circumstances of this case, state whether punitive
 8       damages are warranted against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
 9       Company.
10            His Honor, Judge Hulslander, read to you the
11       instructions.  The standard here, as you know, is a
12       little bit higher than the compensatory damages.  It
13       is clear and convincing evidence.
14            What must you find to award punitive damages in
15       these circumstances?  Let's find out.
16            One, the conduct causing damage to
17       Mr. Alexander was so grossly flagrant as to show a
18       reckless disregard for human life or the safety of
19       persons exposed to the effects of such conduct.
20            Can anyone seriously argue that what they did
21       over five decades was not in reckless disregard of
22       human life?
23            Two, the conduct showed an entire lack of care,
24       that R.J. Reynolds must have been consciously
25       indifferent to the consequences.

 1            Folks, just so we're clear, if we're not
 2       already, during the entire time that they're
 3       whispering out the side of their mouth, Folks,
 4       just keep smoking, and creating controversy, and
 5       attacking scientists and calling the American Cancer
 6       Society and the federal government, accusing them of
 7       misleading the American public, they knew.  They
 8       knew they were killing Americans with their product.
 9            This has been a corporate conspiracy unheard of
10       in American history, and hopefully it will never
11       have been heard of again.  And now accountability is
12       being sought out in rooms such as this.  This is
13       where folks like you get to say enough is enough.
14       This is where you, ladies and gentlemen, can find
15       that punitive damages are warranted.
16            4, the conduct showed such reckless
17       indifference to the rights of others as to be
18       equivalent to an intentional violation of these
19       rights.
20            Folks, to say that what this corporation did
21       was permissible, was okay, would be to condone their
22       conduct.  And punitive damages are to punish them
23       but also to deter others who may be inclined to act
24       similarly.
25            The evidence, not just by clear and convincing

 1       evidence, but beyond and to the exclusion of all
 2       reasonable doubt, that criminal law standard, the
 3       highest we have, clearly shows that punitive damages
 4       are warranted against R.J. Reynolds.  Saying
 5       anything other than that would be to condone their
 6       conduct.
 7            And we know this in our society.  We know we
 8       want there to be more accountability, number two --  
 9       number one, and number two, that if folks do what
10       they did and there's no accountability, there's no
11       incentive for them to stop it.
12            Do the right thing.  Confirm that in our
13       society this conduct will not be tolerated.  Show
14       Earline Alexander that by her life of working hard
15       that even she can come into this courtroom and be on
16       evil -- even footing with a corporation.  Tell them
17       they didn't do the right thing.  Tell them they
18       didn't know right from wrong, or, if they did, they
19       intentionally harmed American families.  Tell them
20       by your verdict enough is enough.
21            Thank you.


16           MR. SMITH:  Thank you.
17           I think sometimes the best response to
18       everything is pretty quick anyway, so I'm going to
19       be pretty quick about this.
20           Number one, they have the burden of proof on
21       the statute of limitations and they have not
22       proven the smoking gun.  Not once in a lifetime
23       did anybody, all the people they talked to, ever 
24       say -- hear him say, I don't feel well, I'm sick,
25       I can't do my work.  They didn't produce a day he

 1       ever missed work.
 2           Now, what they did produce is a 1989 that he
 3       quit working for the gas station.  Actually by
 4       then he was driving, if you remember, he was
 5       actually driving a wrecker truck the last year
 6       that he got social security.  He didn't get social
 7       security when he was working for cash.
 8           Their own expert acknowledged, he showed them,
 9       entrepreneurial ambition.  We have three, if not
10       four eye witnesses to him working on cars in the
11       1990s.  That's the end of that issue.
12           They recognize, their own person, that with
13       that kind of physical exertion he couldn't do if
14       he was suffering from COPD.  He had no idea what
15       COPD was.
16           And then they go to Mrs. Alexander and they
17       say, well, she said that he got emphysema.
18       Mrs. Alexander said she learned that at the
19       doctor's office.  Her daughter told you that she
20       never went to the doctor's office except with him
21       when he went after he had his stroke.
22           Now, Mrs. Alexander is 82, almost 83 years
23       old.  And you've seen the instruction on memory.
24       Mrs. Alexander didn't remember her birthday.
25       Mrs. Alexander does get confused.  She has not had

 1       an easy life.  That doesn't mean she's not
 2       entitled to justice.
 3           And the fact that after three days and 500
 4       pages of depositions they got her confused in
 5       select passages.  You be the Judge of that.
 6           Please go to 883, please.  This ought to say
 7       it all.
 8           They say we told the truth.  This is what they
 9       said in the '80s.
10           (Plaintiff's Exhibit 883, video played for the
11       jury.)
12           MR. SMITH:  He was wrong.  And a half a
13       million people a year are dead.  Now, this isn't
14       any evidence that either side didn't know about.
15       This is what was being said during the life, this
16       was the position of the Tobacco Company's.
17           You know, go to 941, please.
18           I like what Dr. Kyriakoudes said and I hope
19       you'll abide by it.  You don't have to believe
20       this.  Believe their documents.
21           Go to the first highlighted section, please.
22           1964.  Chronic bronchitis, what do they do?
23       They deny it.
24           Go to the next section.
25           They say everybody knew.  This is 1989.

 1       Despite the growing level of public knowledge, a
 2       substantial number of Americans are still
 3       uninformed about and do not believe the health
 4       risks of smoking.  These gaps in knowledge or
 5       beliefs are more evident when one considers the
 6       proportion of adults who do not acknowledge
 7       certain health risks rather than the portion who
 8       do.  9           Go to the next section, please.
10           Although empirical evidence is sparse, tobacco
11       industry activities in the form of advertising and
12       promotion, public relations and lobbying may
13       interfere with public beliefs and personalized
14       acceptance of the health risks of smoking.
15           Next section, please.
16           And what do we know?  African Americans
17       particularly were slow to respond to the drop in
18       smoking.
19           Next section, please.  Go down and what does
20       this show?
21           Right here.  The least educated were 12 times
22       more likely to be reticent in stopping smoking.
23       And why?  Because they were more exposed to
24       advertising and less exposed to the ability to get
25       better information.  And they say, well, he's

 1       never shown that he relied on a single ad.  You
 2       heard Mr. Carnegie say we used to joke about the
 3       ad that he taught me how to put up.  There were
 4       lots of them.  I put them up, and one of them he
 5       talked about how it impressed him.
 6           Go to 248 please.  248.
 7           This is it.  This is what the whole case is
 8       really about.  1964.  They're really glad.  You
 9       know why?  The propaganda blast was tremendous and
10       the penetration was widespread.  But I have the
11       feeling that the public reaction was not as severe
12       nor did it have the emotional depth I might have
13       feared.
14           Go down to the bottom, please.
15           And this is what it was all about for them in
16       1964 and every day after that.  We must in the
17       near future provide some answers which will give
18       smokers a psychological crutch and a
19       self-rationale to continue smoking.
20           That's why we have the controversy and the
21       debate when their own experts say by the 1970s,
22       the 1980s, the science was settled, but not with
23       Edward Horrigan, president of R.J. Reynolds, in
24       1984 when they started a new white paper campaign
25       about can we have an honest debate.

 1           They've got a lot of nerve to come in here and
 2       talk about who knew right from wrong.
 3           They knew in '59 it was addictive.  They knew
 4       in the '80s it was addictive and they never agreed
 5       with it.
 6           You know, they say, well, he hasn't shown the
 7       addiction.  Well, let's get it straight.  We know
 8       that he smoked for 60 years.  We know he smoked
 9       every day.  We know he smoked literally, according
10       to Napoleon Filer, I never knew him to go an hour
11       without smoking.  We know that about him.
12           We know he got up in the night.  We know it
13       was the first thing in the morning.  We know that
14       about him.  And they want you to believe that he
15       smoked two, three, up to three-and-a-half packs a
16       day for 60 years and he was not nicotine
17       dependent.
18           Well, let's say, okay, both experts have their
19       agenda, set them aside.  It's their burden of 
20       proof.  Go back to the doctors who treated him in
21       the hospital, both Drs. Toner and Bellman, and
22       what did they say?  He's nicotine dependent, and
23       you're common sense tells you that.
24           They say, well, that's not what led to his
25       injury.  Wait a minute.  Let's go back.  You know,

 1       they have wonderful scripts.  I congratulate them
 2       on this.  As a matter of fact, when I say script,
 3       I mean the word because when they brought in their
 4       expert, Dr. Stueck, you realize literally it was
 5       just a rescripting of things that I put on the
 6       board that he had used before the last time they
 7       had a historian.  You remember that.
 8           But their script up here with the chains and
 9       all this.  Let me tell you about the chain.
10       Addiction kept him smoking.  And that's all I have
11       to do in this case is because smoking led to COPD
12       and it killed him, and that's not in debate.
13           They say we didn't tell you about the family.
14       Well, we brought Jeanette in.  We brought
15       Mrs. Alexander before you and, you know, you're
16       right, she's not learned.  She's easily confused.
17       She's had a tough life.  But there's an awful lot
18       to be said in very few words when shy tried to
19       describe what she went through with her husband
20       there at the end.
21           I want you to remember that because that's
22       evidence of the kind of pain she feels and felt
23       for what she saw and what she watched.  And there
24       are some evidence -- there is some evidence that's
25       been brought in, mostly through their own

 1       depositions that they brought up.
 2           They say, well, they didn't tell us what kind
 3       of father he was.  Well, I think they elicited he
 4       kept a roof over his kids' head.  They said, well,
 5       they didn't tell you about that.  They brought
 6       that up.
 7           He went to school plays.  They brought that
 8       up.
 9           He went to church programs.  They brought that
10       up.
11           They brought up that what happened when he was
12       at home -- when you'd get home late,
13       Mrs. Alexander?  Well, usually he was in there
14       playing with the kids.  They brought that up.
15           Mrs. Alexander doesn't come in here asking you
16       for sympathy.  She comes in here asking you for
17       justice because she sits without ever having gone
18       to school, with age advanced in this courtroom,
19       she sits with the same dignity in this system that
20       R.J. Reynolds.
21           But I go back to what my partner said, when
22       you want to talk about comparative fault, I'll
23       tell you what to use as a measure.  Comparative
24       knowledge.  Go to that.  Who knew and who knew
25       when and who knew why?  How long did they know it

 1       was addictive?  How long did they know it was
 2       carcinogenic?
 3           And they come back and have the nerve to say,
 4       well, yeah, we tried to fix it.  Wait a minute.  
 5       Remember the letter that we put in evidence when
 6       the guy said don't we have a little horns of a
 7       dilemma here?  Because we're saying at one point
 8       that we're looking to get rid of the bad stuff but
 9       on the other hand we're telling there's nothing
10       bad in it.
11            That was always their dilemma because they
12       couldn't say it was less mutagenic because then
13       they'd have to admit that it's mutagenic.  That's
14       the dilemma for them, so they never came clean.
15       They never told the truth.
16           And I don't know how much.  Nobody does.  That
17       will be up to you.  But I know this:  You watched
18       and you heard about the description of what COPD
19       does to someone.  The description was you start
20       off like you have a snorkel and then you have a
21       straw and then someone's pinching the straw.
22       First you start walking less.  Then you can't walk
23       at all.  Then you start talking less and then you
24       can't talk at all.  Then you live on a hose
25       stretched to your nose and you try to stay at home

 1       until they bring in hospice.  That's the facts of
 2       this case.
 3           THE COURT:  You're out of time, Mr. Smith.
 4           MR. SMITH:  Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you
 5       on behalf of Ms. Alexander.  I appreciate your
 6       justice.
