MR. MITNIK:
I would like -- we have been in
this room together a lot, but I don't want to get
right up on you and crowd you.
We've spent a long time together.
Y'all have
put in a lot of time.
You made an extraordinary
sacrifice for this duty, and I would like to start
my closing the way I started my opening and, on
behalf of everyone, thank you.
And now I have an opportunity to talk to you
about why the sacrifice of your time was worthwhile
in a very significant way. 4267
It goes beyond just, just a lawsuit of
compensation, but it involves deterrence at a higher
level.
May it please the Court.
THE COURT:
Yes, sir.
MR. MITNIK:
I'm going to go through the law.
We've put the evidence out.
And I was very tempted
to put document after document back up, but we did
it in opening.
I probably did too much in opening.
It was way too long.
I apologize that my opening
took so long.
And then we turned around and showed you a
bunch of them during the trial, which was
substantial and necessary to prove up the things I'm
about to talk about.
So I'm not going to run through this.
I have
some little summary boards.
If I have time, I may
put them up just to remind you, but y'all were here,
y'all took notes, and you've been extraordinarily
attentive.
So I really would rather talk to you
about how we've proven our case, and then go through
some of this law the Judge gave you and talk to you
about how the evidence fits into that law, so I can
give you the comfort that we have proven the
necessary things to reach this point that I am 4268
suggesting to you is of such importance.
But we don't just jump there.
We've got to
prove some things.
And I want to walk through it
and show you why the evidence shows we have met
those burdens.
And remember this, though, before I start
talking about the evidence and the law and how they
come together in this case, that the Judge just gave
you the instruction that I talked to you about
during jury selection, where I explained this is not
a criminal case where you have creating doubt
creates it out.
That's not the burden here.
The burden here is by the greater weight of the
evidence, the more persuasive, more convincing.
What persuades me more, what convinces me more, what
makes more sense.
Often said, what's more right
than wrong, but the literal definition is the one
the Judge gave you.
So as we go through this, I ask you to keep --
and I'm going to, at the end, talk to you about a
bit of a higher burden on the punitive damages being
awarded.
That's clear and convincing evidence.
I'm
going to talk about that, because when I read the
instruction to you, I'm going to explain under the
evidence, would suggest strongly to you, that we've 4269
blown past that burden.
But I want to point the
burden out on issues like class membership because
it is so important that the question not be things
like this, can you quit?
Did you hear things?
Did
you have some notice?
Were you powerless
completely?
You have now heard the instructions.
I believe
the Judge will ultimately give them to you.
None of
that's found anywhere.
The Judge tells you what the
parameters of the class membership and everything
else on the law.
And the parameters are -- one thing we don't
have to deal with, because the Judge told you he
found as a matter of law, that the smoking caused
her COPD and death.
So the Judge has decided that
part.
Then what's left for class membership?
Because
this is a process.
We prove class membership, and
then those Engle findings from that jury that sat
for a year, that went to the Supreme Court and
landed in this courtroom, they suddenly have
authority when we have proven class membership.
They're binding.
And you've seen the length of -- to put on the
documents, and you've heard the extraordinary number 4270
of documents.
You've heard about them.
You saw how
many you saw here in our three weeks.
So we're not
going to replow all the old ground, but we're going
to bring those findings into this courtroom from
that jury, and you're an extension of that when we
prove class membership.
And then here's the next step, just to kind of
put it all in a simpler perspective, once we've
proven class membership -- I'm going to tell you in
a minute what it is -- is that on the facts of this
case, that part is nearly a given.
We have to prove
it, but I'm going to, in a few minutes, I think,
show you how that one is pretty straightforward.
Once the class membership is there, and those
findings come into this courtroom, then here's what
we have to prove.
We're not back to square one
proving was there a conspiracy, did they get
together and agree amongst themselves in the
industry to zip their lips because loose lips sink
ships.
We don't have to prove that.
That's a given
once we're a class member.
We don't have to prove they committed a fraud
on the American people through concealment.
That's
a given in this case once we prove class membership.
We don't have to prove that this was a 4271
defective product.
Once we're class members, that's
a given.
We don't even have to prove they were
negligent, failure to use reasonable care.
Once we
prove class membership, that's a given.
Here's what's left to prove on that.
Those are
the givens.
What do we have to prove?
That those
chunks that I've told you about, they're called
causes of action, those things were a legal cause of
Dawn's death, COPD and death.
That they
contributed -- again, not the only reason, and I'm
going to say that over and over, and I'm going to
get a chance in rebuttal, and I bet you I'm going to
say it a bunch more times, because it isn't was it
the cause, as if it was an all or nothing,
either/or.
Either you had choice, or you were
addicted.
Either you heard something, or you were
completely uninfluenced by all we were doing to be a
stumbling block in something that might as well have
been called operation stumbling block.
It isn't either/or.
It is was it a
contributing cause.
And it can't be some
insubstantial cause, it's got to be substantial.
It
can't be insignificant, some meaningful cause.
In other words, in simple layman's terms, did 4272
what they do have a meaningful influence on the
outcome in this lady's life?
And if we prove that,
then we've proven everything in that part of the
case.
And what's left is we're going to talk about
the impact on the loss of this woman, who was the
gravitational pull in that family, that held it
together.
And then we're going to talk about punitive
damages being warranted under the law the Judge gave
you, then the evidence that we have painstakingly
brought to you, to show that they, indeed, are
warranted.
And then we will have passed through
this to the part in the end that I would suggest
elevates this, something that can really make a
difference, to try to protect the next generation of
teenagers from this addiction that kills at a rate
of 480,000 people a year today.
And those kids are
picking it up today because it has an addictive drug
that they don't respect and they don't fear because
it has been trivialized and sugarcoated to the point
it's like potato chips or coffee or jogging, and
it's nothing like that.
It's a nasty addiction, but it masquerades as
something else because people don't get high.
How 4273
can this be that kind of drug if you don't get high?
It's hard to convince those kids who think in
three to five years they're going to put it down.
We got these folks -- you heard the evidence --
still targeting the teenagers and won't take the
addiction out, and they can, so it would be a truly
choice cigarette, not a need cigarette.
And we're going to talk about their efforts,
their so-called efforts to produce such a cigarette,
but I'll save that after they're done, for rebuttal.
That's the substantial part of this case.
Now, let's talk about how Patty Dawn Allen
qualifies this case and empowers you to take that
next step under the law and the evidence.
I put this up, and I am sure nobody can read
it.
And I put these little stickies on it.
I'm
going to read them for you because even close
they're probably hard to read.
The point was the environment when she started
smoking.
Because, remember, it's a different time
and a different place.
And I'm going to do
something, and I don't want to be too gimmicky, but
I don't know to make this point with my mouth.
It's
just such a hard point to imagine that time through
the lens of today. 4274
So I'm going to spread around some ads, I'm
going to put up some of those orienting things, so
that I can do the best I can on behalf my clients
and on your behalf to do my job to make that a
reality, because it was a different time and place.
And in that different time and place, I'm going
to go through and try to put these things in a fair
perspective to see how, yes, indeed, what they did
had an impact on my client and the continued
smoking, in spite of family members urging her
later, her husband and her daughter, and a sister,
earlier, and parents who said, do as I say, not as I
do -- they didn't say it was dangerous, but said,
you know, don't do what I do; in spite of later,
doctors talking to her; in spite of information out
there you'd have to live in a hole not to have
heard, this could be the thing causing the cancer,
this could be it.
But when you put it in the perspective of the
time and place, and you see the counter-messaging
and the effectiveness on the addicted mind, let
alone on the child or the teenager or the senior in
high school is who's picking up cigarettes for the
first time, and being offered up safer-seeming
alternatives called filters that were a fraud, in an 4275
environment in which you said, look, the scientists
can't even agree, wait and see.
That message had been in place by the time she
picked up her first cigarette.
For 13 years, they
had been hammering away at it, with all of their
resources, creating -- just like you would have to
live in a cave not to have heard public health
saying these things could kill you, you would have
had to live in a cave not to have heard, but it's a
hotly controversial issue, nobody really knows.
And
there's only one reason it was a controversy, they
made it so on purpose, and it was a lie, and they
knew it.
So instead of growing up with concrete, I'm
young, this can kill me, and I'm about to engage in
a highly addictive drug that I may -- that no matter
how you bait it and make it look pretty, there's a
big barb in there.
And like heroin, I'm going to
steer clear because I don't want to be hooked and
struggling for life.
I'm going to play with it for
a few years and then put it down.
It's never going
to hurt me.
They concealed that hook.
And here's what the answer to that is.
Here's
their answer to that.
Well, at the turn of the
century, here's some document that says something 4276
about nicotine fit or something that says nicotine
is addictive.
Now, I want to ask you to keep your eye on this
because consistency is important in the search for
the truth.
And I'm going to ask you to look for
these answers.
If everybody -- at one point of the
defendants' case, if everybody knew at the turn of
the century, the kids, everybody, this was a highly
addictive, powerful drug, how come in '64 they're
going to tell you, it's okay for what we did,
Surgeon General said it wasn't addictive?
Well, over here when we want to say Patty Dawn
Allen would have known all she knew, we got all
these old things from dusty volumes someplace to
suggest everybody knew, but when it comes time to
say in 1964, we're going to take advantage of the
Surgeon General, so how were we supposed to know?
Well, if the people that were making it weren't
supposed to know, how was she supposed to know?
But we can answer that question.
I'm not going
to put them up, but you've seen them over and over,
their documents that say, nicotine is addictive, we
are therefore in the business of selling an
addictive drug.
That isn't what they were telling Congress, 4277
that isn't what they were telling Patty Allen, that
isn't what they were telling millions of other
Americans in that era, but that's what they knew.
You know how we know?
Not because I say it, but
because they said it.
They just said it behind the
darkest, closed, locked doors imaginable, as part of
an industry-wide conspiracy to keep it under wraps
because if one of the companies said it, it would be
out.
But why are they in this courtroom?
What's
wrong with smoking?
What does it have to do with
them?
They're a victim in this case.
They'll also tell you everybody at the turn of
the century knew how horrible they were.
There was
somebody in an opium den who they were talking about
how horrible cigarettes were.
And there was
something in the Florida Health Notes from the
1800's talking about how bad they were.
Then we showed you one just shortly thereafter
that said they were good, as if someone's combing
through the Florida Health Notes.
Then you will recall when we had Dr. Cummings,
I pulled some up.
There were little small articles
that were touting how wonderful cigarettes were.
And I said, now, let's put that aside and stop this 4278
dragging little stuff out, and let's get down to the
business of what the environment really was like for
this jury.
They would say, everybody, including her,
coming years -- goodness gracious, the turn of the
century, everybody knew these things killed you,
except they weren't killing everybody.
Here comes the cancer out here, slowly crawling
up.
Everybody knew.
But this is what I'm asking
you to keep your eye on the ball, everybody knew,
except when we get out here, they say, our people
that manufacture them, we didn't know.
Nobody knew.
It was -- the scientists really didn't know.
Which is it?
Everybody knew, including kids,
at the turn of the century.
Nobody knew when they
hit the conspiracy and decided to tell everybody no,
you know.
We can answer that one, too.
You don't need
Mitnik's mouth to answer that one either.
We can
use what they wrote behind those same closed doors
when they wrote, all but one person who wasn't part
of them all agreed, it's cancer causing.
You saw the Little document that Mr. -- the
company called -- I can't even remember the name --
something Little, came a little later in the case -- 4279
Arthur Little Company -- cigarettes cause cancer.
Didn't say anything about confusion and doubt and
maybe and controversy.
In fact, the very first document that kicked
the conspiracy off, the Hill & Knowlton document
that came out as part of their meeting in that
historical meeting in 1953, Christmas Eve, when all
the heads of all these -- including these defendants
came together in New York City, left their families
and got together, not with scientists and public
health, but with Hill & Knowlton to come up with a
spin and hatch this conspiracy they carried on for
50 years.
That very first document when the Hill &
Knowlton people were interviewing scientists from
the people who entered into the conspiracy,
including these two defendants, said, wouldn't it be
wonderful if we could be the first company to come
up with a cancer-free cigarette?
But they're in Congress in 1994, at the Waxman
hearings, saying, it don't cause cancer, it hadn't
been proven, we don't know.
At the same time
they're saying, swear on a Bible, it don't cause
addiction, it ain't addictive.
But they're going to come back, I suspect, and 4280
tell you, look at all these health notes that
everybody knew.
Did they miss that class?
What does this have to do with -- I'm going to
talk while he's doing it.
I hope that's not too
distracting.
What did all of this have to do with
Patty Allen?
Wrong smoke.
Well, I want to talk to
you about that.
The first part of this case involves -- while
he's doing that, I want to talk to you about the
class membership, and then I'll move into these
individual causes of action.
On the class membership, you have to determine
was Patty Dawn Allen addicted to nicotine, to
cigarettes -- whether Ms. Allen was addicted to
cigarettes containing nicotine, and, if so, whether
such an action was a legal cause.
Then, they will say, but for -- legal cause, if
it acts in a direct -- da, da, da -- or
substantially contributes to produce, so as to say
but for.
You're going to hear "but for" a lot.
And I ask you to do this when you hear "but
for" -- and I'm about to give you the rest of the
paragraph -- I'm going to ask you to do two things.
Always look at the rest of paragraph, too, so that
that's put in context.
And one other thing, I ask 4281
you to remember "but for," and their answer is
anything but our product caused her harm, anything
but, and how reasonable and fair that is.
Here's the rest of it:
"In order to be the
legal cause of COPD, an addiction to cigarettes
containing nicotine need not be the only cause.
It
may be a legal cause of COPD even though it operates
in combination with the act of another or some other
cause if it contributes substantially to producing."
Now, I want to set one thing very, very clear.
We do not have to prove that she had a toxic
overdose reaction and keeled over from nicotine.
As
if you took that bottle that Dr. Henningfield had
and soaked the nicotine out of it, he said, it can
kill you if you drink it.
That's not what we have
to prove.
It isn't that the nicotine caused her COPD
directly, it's was it a legal cause of her COPD and
death, which means did the nicotine contribute in a
meaningful way to her smoking long enough and
frequently enough to have gotten sick?
And it need
not be the sole cause.
Remember, she has acknowledged fault on her
part through her husband and her daughter.
She has
acknowledged that this isn't an all or nothing, that 4282
she shares in this responsibility.
And of course
she does.
And I'm going to suggest to you she does
in a manner that is early -- they are far more
responsible when this is a 17-year-old girl in the
environment like this and --
Can you put up the 4-A stuff -- in this
environment.
But as time goes on, her responsibility grows
some.
But you know what comes with it -- and I
don't mean to make excuses, I just mean to talk the
truth and try to get the fair balance in this -- the
addiction she's getting.
You heard these world class public health
officials who came in here, how you get deeper into
the addictive cycle, and it gets harder and worse.
And remember the document, they called it a holding
strategy.
They knew they couldn't keep it under lid
forever, but they wanted to hold on as long as they
could.
And as they held, she got deeper and deeper
into the addictive cycle, so it would be harder and
harder to break it.
And why did they do that?
Because they didn't
want to lose one cigarette.
Remember, in the Hill &
Knowlton, one cigarette could be a billion units
less.
They didn't want not only people quitting, 4283
they didn't want them cutting back, they didn't want
them trying.
How do we know?
The American Smokeout, just
one day, try to break free, America.
Just give it a
day.
Because maybe a day will add days.
They went
on the attack.
They wouldn't give them the one day.
Don't even try.
And then when Patty Dawn Allen does precisely
what they were targeting and aiming, they said,
what's that got to do with anything?
I mean, you
didn't have to listen to us.
She didn't even know
what they were up to.
She didn't know they were
using other organizations.
And she didn't have to
have heard The Frank Statement or such.
She was a
kid.
What she has to have done is lived during that
time because you had to live in a cave not to have
the era of the controversy, which tells the person
about the smoke, hey, this ain't so dangerous,
besides they don't know anything about the hook
hidden in the bait.
And then when you get addicted, and you're in
denial, and that disease, that addicted mind that is
being hardwired as a teenager doesn't want to give
it up, it doesn't take much.
And nobody knew better
than them that it doesn't take much.
They couldn't 4284
put the genie in the bottle, and they couldn't zip
up the lips of public health; but, what they could
do is say, scientists can't agree, wait and see.
And while the waiting and seeing is happening,
people are getting deeper and deeper addicted.
So, yes, her responsibility as she gets older
in life and more information is coming out becomes
more significant than when younger, but it's never
without addiction in the room.
You heard her
daughter say they were never alone because the
cigarette and the addiction was always there.
One thing I want to make clear, the percentages
in this case, which is the shared fault part.
Let
me just tell you, I'm going to make a suggestion,
what the lawyers say isn't evidence, but we have an
obligation to try to be a guide for you, give you
some measuring sticks to consider.
And I'm going to
make a suggestion that on this evidence that the
percentages of fault in this case should be 40
percent on Philip Morris, and 40 percent on R. J.
Reynolds, and 20 percent on Ms. Allen.
And here's
why.
You can say, goodness, you're putting 80 there
and 20 here.
Cute trick.
Let me tell you why, and
you assess whether it's a cute trick or whether it's 4285
fair and reasonable.
It's your decision.
Let me
give you my thinking, so you can vet and you can
process it yourself.
They knew it all when they set the stage for
this.
She was a kid who was in the dark.
And it's
just, in my suggestion, unfair to come anywhere
close to sharing the responsibility of the earlier
years.
Now, when she gets out and married to
Mr. Allen, and the time has gone on, and it's more
about the addiction and less about the conspiracy of
fraud, her responsibility goes up, but there's a
significant curve in that before she catches up.
And that's why I suggest each of them have 20 to 40.
Now, why do I say Philip Morris and RJR equal?
Here's why.
There are two ways to look at
responsibility for something like this.
One is, how
many cigarettes of your brand did you smoke?
And if
you smoked mostly theirs, then they're mostly at
fault.
Well, that may work if we left hardwired the
addicted child's mind, a teenager's mind, when it's
vulnerable.
The 20-year-old's mind, the
21-year-old's mind is still vulnerable and
developing.
And when you hardwire the addiction in, and 4286
you're the one that started this spiral into the
deep end of addiction and kicked it off, are you
suddenly less responsible because one of your
competitors snatched the person you set the hook on,
and they reeled her in for more time than you when
she finally got on the boat with all the others you
cast the net out, flailing on that boat, gasping for
air?
Does that make them less because it's less
number?
You can bet Philip Morris didn't want to lose
her as a customer, but she was already hooked.
Now, does that mean R. J. Reynolds, who was
part of this fraud, has carried on and facilitated
and exploited that addiction?
Yeah.
They're
responsible, too.
One thing I want to say on this.
Under the
law, the percentages of fault apply, but not to
everything.
They do not apply to those
intentional -- they're called intentional torts,
where someone on purpose did wrongful acts, wrong
deeds on purpose, by design.
So with fraud and the conspiracy and the
concealment, it doesn't apply.
The law says you
don't apply that to those.
It's apples and oranges
to the human frailties or negligence of someone who 4287
was addicted and keeps smoking.
There is nothing
comparable.
So the law keeps those separate, and
they ought to be separate.
Now, I want to walk through, was -- now, this
is the situation.
Could you put up that just real quick?
This is that different time.
And we've shown
some of these slides before.
And this is where she
would be living in.
Everywhere you looked.
Here's
the Mores, all these -- and they said it's a man's
brand.
These are funny looking men.
And how many
of them aren't thin?
How many of them aren't thin?
And I'm going to suggest this to you.
We hear
about other reasons she smoked.
Remember, it's not
either/or.
But she smoked because she wanted to be
thin.
She smoked because she was obsessed with her
weight.
She smoked because she had stress or
depression or back pain.
So she's not the right
smoker.
They drive people, through their ads, to smoke
over thinness.
You saw the other evidence that we
put in, how they exploit the relaxation effect of
nicotine.
They write about it in private.
It's one
of the good things they offer up.
Those are drug effects.
Does -- is it always 4288
the wrong smoker if somebody has a life that has
some stress, a parent dies, or they have some
depression?
Does that make them the wrong smoker?
If so, it's going to be hard to find the right
smoker.
What they did was way too big to hide behind
one thin lady.
And it has nothing to do with the
outcome of your decision here because it isn't
either/or.
The only way it becomes significant to
your decisions on class membership in this case is
if you were to say, I'm going to throw out
Dr. Burns, his life in public health, and his
extraordinary knowledge and experience, a guy the
Surgeon General turns to; Dr. Henningfield, who the
U.S. military turns to and the Surgeon General turns
to, and his extraordinary wealth of knowledge, and
has sacrificed his life to this issue; Dr. Cummings
who spent his life and got a grant to study all
these things, and has the biggest cessation clinic
in the state of New York trying to help people; and
Dr. Eye and Dr. Kirley; and even the family members,
and even Ms. Allen herself.
If all of them are just wrong, and she was just
smoking to be skinny, then maybe it matters.
But
otherwise, the question is, was addiction one of the 4289
reasons, a meaningful reason she smoked enough to
get sick, not can I conjure up other reasons to say
she might.
Because the instruction in the law tells
you there can be plenty of other reasons, so long as
this one played a part.
And if addiction doesn't play a part in why
someone smokes enough to get sick, what is
addiction, addiction to any drug.
If a drug
addiction isn't a significant driving force between
continuing to use it and the frequency of using it,
what does it do?
It's a word without meaning.
And that's what the person they brought to the
courtroom said, that addiction, he can't fathom a
situation where it would lead to someone smoking
enough to get sick, unless they had brain injury.
So unless we happen to represent someone with a
brain injury, they would be the wrong smoker, all of
them.
Why do I have ads up here of kids?
Is it just
to inflame you, with the Santa Claus stuff?
No.
It's highly relevant to the circumstances because
parents, why did parents smoke in that era, that the
kids modeled after?
These kind of ads back.
You
saw the older ads and the teaching to inhale ads.
That set it into the fabric of society, and it got 4290
passed as a right of passage from one generation to
the next.
And she was caught smack in the middle.
It has everything to do with her, with Patty
Dawn Allen, because everyone agrees her parents
smoking, her friends smoking, and it being glamorous
was a significant part of why you would pick it up.
She smokes Capri.
There is no slimmer way to
smoke.
These aren't Capris, they're Silvas.
"Cigarettes are like women.
The best ones are thin
and rich."
Look at Capri.
And they want to say, hey, what's that got to
do with her addiction?
She just wanted to be thin.
She's obsessed with her weight.
They're playing on
that, and it's addiction, even if it's true.
Once we show she's addicted -- and I don't know
what else we could do, it is -- we had the flip
chart.
It's down now, but we had the flip chart
that showed all the people that said she was.
And
standing alone over here by himself is the guy they
hired, who they went out and found, sent him
medical -- remember, the lawyers are giving him the
medicine and the articles, not the other way around,
to come in here and say, not addicted.
And we put up the criteria for you.
They
didn't.
And these criteria, there's no way she 4291
wasn't addicted under them, if you really sat down
and went through them.
But he skipped that part,
just got the conclusion that helped.
So was she addicted?
Yes.
Was it a reason she
smoked and continued to smoke, a significant, a
legal cause, did it contribute significantly, or was
it just a big coincidence?
They would have you
believe it's just a coincidence.
This case is much
about coincidence versus common sense, and,
ultimately, about truth and consequences.
And you're allowed, thankfully, to use your
common sense.
Yes, she was addicted.
Of course,
she was addicted.
She smoked after her doctor said,
you got COPD and are going to die if you don't quit
smoking.
She got off planes and raced.
She got up
in the morning before she went to the bathroom and
smoked and did it all day.
No one ever hardly saw
her without a cigarette.
Is that just because it's
yummy?
It tastes good?
Just so much fun?
Boy, I
can't just get enough of that.
I'm going to do it
first thing in the morning.
I'm going do it all day
and right before bed.
I'm going to do the next day.
And I'm going to do that for 30 years.
It's got
nothing to do with addiction.
Even after she couldn't inhale enough to get it 4292
down or keep it down, she still wanted cigarettes.
She's not addicted.
This is like potato chips.
So, yes, she's a class member.
And now those
findings come into this courtroom.
And I want to
just hit this again, now that I've put this massive
stuff out here, the environment.
This is the
environment.
And it's significant to say what has
this got to do with Patty Allen?
Massive marketing.
It became the norm.
All the adults were doing
it.
You want to be an adult, we're not -- not only
were all these ads here, you couldn't go anywhere
where the people weren't smoking.
Everywhere,
planes, restaurants, doctors' offices, the doctor
himself.
They were everywhere.
But, gosh almighty, she knew everything she
knew.
She picked it up.
It was her choice to
smoke.
We got nothing to do with that, anything but
us.
That's R. J. Reynolds' and Philip Morris' motto
in this case.
Youth marketing.
They hammered away at youth.
You've seen it.
They have been doing it.
They said
no brand, success or fall, rides on youth marketing.
And they get up and try to parse the word "young
adults," their disclaimer language.
And then we showed you over and over, it ain't 4293
young adults.
They were teenagers.
They were going
down to 12s and 14-year-olds in it.
Why are they
writing letters directly to students or to
principals of students?
Not just was Dr. Cummings
out in -- when was it, '90-something, but back in --
what was it -- '68.
Had nothing to do with
Dr. Cummings.
They were writing directly to the
students.
We want you to get our message.
These
things aren't hurting you.
Scientists can't agree,
wait and see, to the kids.
And they're still doing
it.
That's the environment, but this environment
doesn't stop there.
Thirteen years, they had an
opportunity to come clean and say, all right, it
kills you, rather than it's -- scientists can't
agree, wait and see.
They single-handedly made that
message.
She grew up on it.
The conspiracy started
when she was five.
When she picked up a cigarette,
it was 12 or 13 years later.
She just lived.
By now, the scientists still don't know.
How
scary is that to do?
And they concealed the
addiction.
How scary was it to do what the parents
and everybody else that was smart was doing, that
sure looked interesting, and all these pretty
ladies? 4294
But it's more than that.
The illusion of
filtration, that didn't come along later for her.
They had already, as part of the coverup, come up
with this, if somebody is nervous, let's give them a
self-rationalization to feel safe, the illusion of
filtration.
What's a filter do but purify?
So if
anyone's -- we don't know -- everybody doesn't react
the same to our creative controversy without
muddying the waters up.
Everyone doesn't react the
same.
So let's get out some products that make it
look safe.
And then they want to say, listen, that's all
the Surgeon General's fault.
And you saw, we had to
get back up and make the record clear after the
cross.
No, the Surgeon General's office and public
health was light years behind these guys and were
always playing catchup, and they were always taking
advantage of it.
But the public, we know, the FTC reports
believed it was safer, and it wasn't.
The Surgeon
General in 2010, they're not safer, but people think
they are.
2010.
What do you think she thought way
back then?
Just take that out of the mix.
Wouldn't that 4295
be something -- you get an instruction, materiality,
something that would have been significant in the
decision-making to Patty Dawn Allen.
You think it
wouldn't have been significant enough -- that's a
fraud, those things aren't really safer.
And by the
way, they really will kill you.
Scientists don't
disagree.
It's just us behind the scenes saying it
looked like scientists disagree.
And, by the way,
the truth is it's a highly addictive, powerful drug.
You take all that out of the mix, and they want
to say, just couldn't be that that contributed
because she didn't see The Frank Statement
personally.
How fair is that?
Because I want to talk to you about something
called reasonable inferences.
Reasonable
inferences.
You were instructed you can use reasonable
inferences and common sense.
Like with Philip
Morris, is it reasonable, likely, that she walked
into Ms. Norgaard's and picked up the first pack --
by the carton, I'm sorry, of Benson & Hedges, the
day she walked in, and the day she walked out from
living with her a couple of years later, just
dropped them at the moment?
Or is it likely that
she had been smoking for sometime before and after? 4296
Remember the evidence of there's brand loyalty
and very little switching, particularly with
young -- with that age group of women.
Not only
Dr. Cummings explained it, their internal documents
would show us that.
And we also know that it was like a year or
two, shortly before she went -- was seen by her
husband smoking the More brand, which is the R. J.
Reynolds brand, they had just come out, this hot new
thing, the long one -- the long one that says you
can get three, four, five more puffs.
Think how
many that is times 20 cigarettes.
Do you think
that's an indication?
They're brown, they aren't
real faded.
She picks the brown one, but she can
get all these extra puffs.
What's that say about
addiction?
So you can use your reasonable inferences to
figure out how much did she really smoke during this
initiation phase where the hook got set by Philip
Morris.
And I suggest the evidence is more than
just two years, although I cannot point to a witness
who can come in and say.
But along the same lines on this suggestion of
she doesn't have to see an ad, it's the wallpapering
effect.
You've heard that referred to.
They were 4297
so effective in getting it out, they're spending so
much more money than public health that they created
a controversy.
Did it affect her?
I suggest to you here's the
best measuring stick for that.
Let's look at what
they intended, what the aim of the conspiracy and
the fraud to conceal was.
Let's look if she
followed to a tee the aim.
And then let's take one
last check and say, are there really kind of a
decision that's a little bit of a head scratcher,
but for -- I'll use but for -- but for what they
did.
I wouldn't expect you to do that, but for.
So let's think about it a minute.
Does she
pick up a cigarette more likely -- did they want her
to pick up a cigarette?
Yeah, they did.
Did they
want her to inhale?
Yeah, they did.
Did they want
her to feel safe with filters?
Yeah, they did.
Did they want her not to be scared off, to
steer clear, because of this wishy-washy message
they were creating, the muck they created?
Yeah.
What does she do?
Started with filters,
started without fear, at 17 years old.
Coincidence
or common sense that that had an impact?
Sole
reason, no.
Oh, and parents and peers are an
influence of it, too.
Think they had something to 4298
do with that?
Wanted to be thin.
Think they had
something to do with that, or are they just innocent
bystanders, common sense coincidence?
Now, let's move to this period of time where
now we're past the initiation phase where she's
starting, and they got her hooked.
Now we've got
the environment during the sustaining period.
All
the while, sales are going through the ceiling.
All
the while, all those people are dying.
All the
while, these companies know these people are dying
from their product, and they're doing everything in
their power to keep it confused so people will keep
smoking, on a holding strategy, knowing they're
dying, because they can make a lot more money.
And
every time something came out, like a Surgeon
General report, like the warning pack, the FTC says,
just didn't work.
Every step, they keep driving it
up, fighting, knowing the consequences.
Are punitive damages warranted?
Is that clear
and convincing, so that you can have a conviction,
having heard the evidence that punitive damages are
awarded when endangering the public, callously,
recklessly, disregarding the dangers?
What is the other answer to that question,
other than yes?
Yes.
Yes. 4299
So what happens during the environment that
they did to impact the outcome after she gets
addicted?
They activate a denial big time.
They
said, you don't need to go through that nightmare,
thinking what it would be like to live without these
things I'm deeply addicted to.
You don't have to.
Unlike today, not everybody that is addicted today
is walking around going, gosh, I got to do something
about this.
These things are bad.
I know they're
bad, bad, bad.
That's a different environment.
Heard it's
bad, heard it may not be bad.
Who knows?
Scientists can't agree, wait and see.
That's what they did.
What did she do?
Wait
and see.
What did they give her?
Filters.
What
did they give her later on?
Low tar that everybody
thought was safer.
What did she do?
Switched to
low tar.
What did the witnesses -- she's not here
to tell you, but what did witnesses say?
She was
smoking the brown ones because she thought they were
safer, or words to that effect.
Why did she switch to the Capris?
She thought
they were safer, better for her, less dangerous,
whatever the word was.
That's the message they wanted.
That's 4300
precisely what they did.
That lines up for legal
cause.
Now, let's say, if you take what they were
doing out of the mix, is that just something she
would have done on her own?
Like if you had told
the truth, filters don't work, low tar is a fraud,
we're tricking the machines, shameful practices
ultimately found that they did by the FTC, if she
had known all that, would she be switching to them?
Would she not be -- here's one.
They didn't want
people to cut back, let alone even try to quit, let
alone be successful.
And they were going right down
to bury the people who tried to take one day off for
the Great Smokeout.
In one day, they would spend more money than
the whole clearinghouse for the public health.
You
saw the humongous numbers they poured into this,
sharing amongst themselves by their market share in
using fronts and shields and admitting -- and that's
their words in internal documents -- and talking
about, we're going to -- how they're going to get
away with it with a wink, internally bragging on how
well it worked, 20 years, boy, we did a wonderful
job.
All of that working like a charm on society. 4301
Are people -- some quitting?
Yeah.
We got millions
of smokers, and if one million a year quit, it's
going to add up to 50 or 60 million over 50 or 60
years.
That doesn't change the math.
It's 2 or 3
percent are successful, meaning 97 percent weren't.
But they didn't want to even give up that 2 or 3
percent chance.
So everything they did was to
create an irrational reaction, which was don't even
try.
Now, there is no suggestion that Patty Dawn
Allen was suicidal.
She was a driven woman, not
trying until she got diagnosed.
What does that tell
you about whether this conspiracy, more likely than
not, had an impact on her?
Put a different way, but for it, you think
it -- maybe coming clean, it's true, it really is
killing people, and, by the way, you may want to
seek help, this is a real addiction, you may want an
intervention.
They were running in like an AA
meeting saying, whoa, my name is -- no, shhh, shhh,
shhh, stay in denial.
That's why people in AA say, my name is, and
I'm an alcoholic.
It's an addiction.
And once you
admit it, it's the end of denial.
It would be like having the whole industry get 4302
together and run around the country and go to all
the AA meetings, shhh, shhh, shhh, you're not.
You
don't need help, go home, enjoy.
Go on enjoying
your cigarettes.
Remember those from the Hill &
Knowlton.
And she doesn't try during that period.
That's
irrational.
Take out the but for what they did, and
explain that.
Just because she loved it so much,
and she had a little anxiety, and she liked to be
thin, but it's killing you.
And they're going to say, well, wait, all this
pomp and circumstance, and Mitnik over there
about -- her family was telling her, saying, it's
going to kill her.
What good is the family?
That's one of the most outrageous parts of what
they do.
The natural support of the family, would
you trust and believe your family when they're
trying to help?
You may not like it, but you at
least believe.
They sabotaged that safety net of loved ones,
sabotaged, because by the time Mr. Allen is in the
picture, 25 years in public health has been running
around like Chicken Little, the sky is falling,
crying wolf.
And what are the independent-seeming
scientists saying at the same time that they're 4303
funding from behind the scenes?
They change the
name of the organization to take Tobacco Industry
out, make it Institute, so it would sound
independent?
They were saying, absolutely not.
It's like, remember, apple sauce.
Goodness,
some women like smaller babies.
Nobody knows.
Oh,
we wouldn't put those ads in the Superman movie.
Maybe the director liked them.
They are hammering
away, hammering away, and they created that
controversy, and she acted precisely the way they
wanted.
And when a family member would say, would you
please stop, these things could hurt you, or
whatever they said, could kill you, whatever, the
answer is, I've been hearing that the scientists
can't even agree, and it's been 25 years.
By then,
the conspiracy is 25 years in.
By the time she
picked up a cigarette, it was 13 years in.
And the cigarette companies promised, if anyone
ever finds it, we're going it fix it or filter it
out or take it off the shelf, and she's smoking
filters, and they're still on the shelf, and
scientists still can't agree, wait and see.
So when a family member says it, instead of
going -- and, by the way, you know you're addicted, 4304
so you know what you're up against, and the family
member can talk honestly about maybe we need to have
an intervention, you really are addicted, that's in
the dark.
Don't even know how ill you are with it.
It just seems like you're sorry and lazy, won't
quit.
It's just something so pleasurable, it could
be hard to give up, not a really, honest to God
addiction.
That's not even in the mix for the
family.
And the family is saying, this could hurt you,
so, please, honey.
And what do you get?
It causes
as argument.
You get a deaf ear.
It goes in one
ear and out the other.
Because you remember
Dr. Burns said there are levels of people's
understanding when you deal with addiction.
One of
them is hearing it, but not believing it.
The next
is believing it could be in general, but it's not
personalized, not me.
And it's always going on.
So rather than have the family say it and
saying, you know what, I don't have any -- I can't
rationalize or justify any way, shape or form in any
mind, it's true.
I really don't have any.
It's
just in one ear and out the other.
Because you're
not a scientist, what do you know?
Not suggesting
you have any evidence she said it, but I'm talking 4305
about the reasonable common sense inference.
Leave
me alone.
That is one of the things they did.
Because
you think it was a mystery to them that family
members, with all this in public health, were going
to just go, we're not going to say a word about it?
Family members were going to join in.
Treating
doctors were going to join in.
And they did
everything in their power to make sure it didn't
work, and it didn't work on Patty Dawn Allen.
And
they say, but that's got nothing to do with us.
They haven't shown you that she saw The Frank
Statement or one of these TV things they ran.
She's
not here to prove it.
And if she was, they would be
saying it's self-serving.
But actions speak louder
than words, and it's the best evidence in this
Court, and you're authorized by the Judge to rely on
it.
And her actions fit to a tee she was a
cigarette company success story, and they want to
say it's all just a big coincidence.
And I'm asking
you to use your common sense, particularly when the
conduct really is irrational but for what they were
doing.
Did it contribute?
Was it the only thing?
Some of it, maybe, but at least it contributed. 4306
I want to give you one analogy on that, and
then I'm going to move to a different subject
because I do want to save some time for rebuttal to
put things in context.
When I was younger, had a lot more hair, my
daughter loved Coke when she was little.
And she
drank it before bed, and she would get wired and
couldn't sleep.
So she wasn't allowed to have Coke.
She could have Coke, but not before bed.
I'm working on the kitchen table.
The
kitchen's right over here, but in a different room.
And I hear her -- she had already gotten in bed.
She crawled out of bed.
And I hear her in the
refrigerator rattling around.
So I think, she's
going for a Coke.
And I said, Jennifer, you're not getting into
Coke, are you?
She said, no, daddy.
So I went back
to whatever I was doing.
Next I hear, boom.
Came around the corner.
There's a big two-liter thing of Coke spewing all
over.
It's all over her nightie.
She's got a glass
in her hand, and it's foaming over the side of it.
And I asked a dumb question, but it was calling
for a direct evidence answer.
Direct evidence is
what someone says.
Circumstantial evidence is the 4307
circumstances that sometimes are much -- speak
louder than the words themselves.
And I said, you did get into the Coke, didn't
you?
And she said, no, daddy.
That was the direct
evidence.
The circumstantial evidence was foaming
all over and all over the ground.
And when it comes to Patty Dawn Allen, these
defendants have got Coca-Cola all over themselves.
There's no escaping it.
I want to talk to you a minute about damages.
This is a hard part of the case because we don't
have a calculator.
And we have to judge what is
fair.
The instructions tell you the things you can
consider; but, again, are they probably the most
reasonable part of it, the best guide you're going
to get?
I think it says fair and reasonable under
the circumstances.
What would be fair and
reasonable under the circumstances?
To recognize as a measuring stick for what was
taken, another life prematurely, but you don't just
say, okay, simmer down.
You have to look at the
circumstances.
And in the circumstances of this
case, let me put some of that evidence, just as a
reminder.
You heard it, and you know it, but let me
put it in context. 4308
It's pretty clear, and I mean no disrespect,
Mr. Allen, and I mean no disrespect, Amber, but she
kept that family -- she was the strength in the
middle of that family.
And I may probably shouldn't
say that because we've got a man in the room, but
it's true, you could see it.
That's part of the
circumstances.
And a loving, close relationship.
Not everybody's blessed with a great
relationship.
Sometimes in a death case, it may not
be that tremendous a loss.
This isn't one of those
situations.
Amber is a bit of a homebody and a bit shy.
And her mother was her best friend, her confidant.
There was nothing she couldn't talk about.
Her husband had a loving relationship.
And she
was the glue and the heart and soul that kept that
family on track.
And she didn't just wake up one
day and die of a heart attack.
She smoked after
getting diagnosed with COPD.
And both her mother -- I'm sorry, both Amber
and Mr. Allen would plead with her from time to
time, stop, and she kept smoking.
And it was like
someone else was in the room all the time, they're
not alone.
It's like an intruder in a man's house,
he can't get away from his wife.
And if he tries 4309
harder, it ends up in a fight.
The total frustration of that addiction in that
house is part of these circumstances, what that
leaves, the lacerations that leaves.
Watching her
wither away and literally suffocate to death.
Smoking up to where she can't inhale anymore, and
still announcing she'd like to have another
cigarette.
Living in the living room to be close to
everybody.
Mr. Allen met this woman, fell in love with
this woman, and found his soulmate.
And you know
they were married for 30 years.
Almost half of it,
she had COPD.
Is that all their fault, and she
doesn't carry any responsibility?
Absolutely not.
Of course not.
But we walk in this courtroom acknowledging her
share in it, and we're here to prove how they
mightily share in that.
And additional circumstances that, in fairness,
need to be put into the assessment, as you sit as a
group of appraisers and decide what's fair and
reasonable between you, as you try to determine too
much compensation is over, too little is under for
what was taken, what is fair and reasonable under
these circumstances. 4310
And this is a verdict for all time.
We don't
come back ten years now and do an update.
And when
you put that all together, I'm going to add another
circumstance to this.
And that is, the knowledge
that has since then been learned because they're
suffering -- remember, there's a 23-year-life
expectancy -- and nobody's got a crystal ball, but
that's the best evidence we got out of it, we read
to you.
This didn't end when we talk out of here.
The suffering goes on.
And the suffering went on up
to the day we walked in this courtroom, and
continues every day while we're here, one day at a
time.
We don't suffer in a lump and are done with it.
And in that environment of continued loss, where
Amber goes in and covers her dad up if he gets
uncovered, mom's job, where she's still living at
home.
The circumstances are this harsh reality.
While all that maddening, I can't get this off
of my wife, I can't even really have a discussion
about it, now you're sick, and I can't protect you
from this thing.
I'm powerless.
Mom, I want you to be around.
I can't protect
you from this thing.
To then find out the reality that we've all 4311
learned here in this courtroom of what they were
doing behind the scenes to contribute to it.
And to
know that, those -- when she switched to Capris
these little skinny cigarettes that look -- goodness
gracious, they're the skinniest little thing, they
sure look safer.
They got that nice white filter.
They didn't help mom a bit.
Low tar?
That was a lie.
They were tricking
the machines.
To now process the grief, with that
information front and center.
Filters were a fraud.
Tricking the machine.
The conspiracy.
It could have been a unified
message and armed me with more power to try and save
her from this addiction.
How about just tell us
she's addicted?
Really, serious drug addiction.
Not just some mamby-pamby like chocolate, but
serious, honest to God powerful drug addiction, so
we can get her help.
And then you start finally getting some of that
help, with patches and those things.
That's part of
what they suffer through.
And Mr. Allen, who will not even sleep in the
bed and won't change things around, they are frozen
because of the nature of the role she played in that
family, the horrendous way of watching her die the 4312
way she died, the horrible helplessness of that
addiction being front and center every day, every
moment, and then to learn afterwards all of this
that could have made a difference, that was kept in
the deep, dark places secretly by these defendants.
And under those circumstances, my suggestion to
you is that you use time, the value of the time and
the overall impact of that.
And I want to change subjects, because I'm
running out of time, for just a minute, and I'll
come back to that, but I want to change time for a
minute.
They bring an expert in who's the only one who
says she isn't addicted.
And they pay him $600 an
hour, and he comes here and tells you that.
His
value, his time, 600 an hour, and he comes and tells
you that.
And even if she was addicted, it had
nothing to do with why she smoked.
And that's the
only witness who stands between justice and an
opportunity to make a difference on this class
membership subject.
Now, the Surgeon General is dead wrong.
I'm
not going to play it.
You remember this guy
testifying?
American Tobacco, who was owned by
R. J. Reynolds, the Surgeon General is dead wrong. 4313
Who else came in there and said, dead wrong?
The
Surgeon General is wrong.
Remember these talking points that I put up as
to addiction, where they said when the Surgeon
General got around and caught up and figured out it
was like heroin, and they sent out the big press
release, scare tactic.
And I had talked to
Dr. Cummings, were these just in that document, or
was that the drumbeat, millions of former smokers,
95 percent cold turkey, not a real drug, hard to
give up, like any other pleasurable activity,
caffeine, it's just a matter of choice.
That's what
they were putting out there.
That was the message.
And the evidence you have here in this case
from Dr. Abramson is millions of former smokers, 90
percent quit cold turkey, hard to give up, because
of pleasure, it's a matter of choice.
I'm sorry I got side tracked.
I want to go
back now and finish talking on the subject of what's
fair and reasonable under these circumstances.
And I would suggest to you, under the totality
of the circumstances of this case that I laid out
for you, that $600 a day is a fair and reasonable
amount.
Not an hour.
That would be overreaching.
That would be overcompensating.
But for the 4314
magnitude of this loss under these circumstances,
$600 a day for Amber, for those 23 years that are
lived one day at a time, 365 days a year, is fair
and reasonable.
And the same for Andy Allen.
MR. BELASIC:
Your Honor, we object under the
law, the $600 compared to our expert testimony.
MR. MITNIK:
I didn't compare it --
MR. BELASIC:
It's contrary to the law.
That's
what he did.
MR. MITNIK:
I am not comparing it to it.
THE COURT:
All right.
I overrule the
objection.
The jury can understand that.
MR. MITNIK:
Sure.
I want to be clear with the
jurors.
I'm not saying, here's an expert, and make
it the same amount.
To the contrary, what an expert
does or makes has got nothing to do with their loss.
But what I do want to talk to you about is the
concept of their value of the time they lost with
their wife and with her mother.
Last, punitive damages, and I'll sit down.
Are punitive damages warranted under the
evidence of this case?
I've lost my jury
instructions, so I'll just talk to you about them.
You are entitled to consider on the issue of
reprehensibility, reprehensibility, harm to others. 4315
There has to be harm to my client, and it must flow
through her for her to bring an opportunity to you
to make a difference.
That's the law.
And I've
laid out why we've proven that and why what they did
to millions, they did to her, and how she was a
cigarette company success story.
And, yes, it contributed; and, therefore, they
are responsible for -- here's the law on punitive --
"Punitive damages are warranted in the circumstance
in a case as punishment or as deterrents."
MR. BELASIC:
Objection, Your Honor.
Can we
read the "and"?
MR. MITNIK:
-- "as punishment and" -- and --
"as a deterrent.
They may be warranted on a finding
that the defendant is liable for fraudulent
concealment and/or conspiracy to defraud and
conceal."
And then here come the elements for you to
consider:
Clear and convincing, was it so gross and
flagrant to show reckless disregard of human life
for the safety of persons exposed to the effects of
such conduct."
I don't know how else to answer that
but yes.
I'm not the one answering it, but I'm
making a suggestion of what I believe the evidence
shows. 4316
"The conduct shows an entire lack of care, that
defendant must have been consciously indifferent to
the conferences."
It couldn't be more clear, I
suggest.
When you talk clear and convincing, that
one's crystal clear.
"The conduct showed such an entire lack of care
that the defendants must have wantonly, recklessly
disregarded the safety and welfare of the public;
the conduct showed such reckless indifference to the
rights of others as to be equivalent to an
intentional violation of their rights; clear and
convincing evidence."
And it goes through and
explains it.
You're going to have it with you.
It's more than more persuasive, more convincing, but
what it comes down to is that "such weight that it
produces a firm belief or conviction about the
matter."
The evidence is proof.
The youth marketing is
crystal clear.
The conspiracy is crystal clear.
The coverup is crystal clear.
The manipulations and
additives done to make it more inhalable, to unleash
the beast of the addiction full force, is crystal
clear.
The whole use of the ads is clear.
Filters
could not be more clear in this case, and then low
tar. 4317
All of that flows directly through Patty Dawn
Allen, and you can consider the harm to others as to
reprehensibility to determine whether they're
warranted, and this is as reprehensible as it can
get.
I would suggest, as you work through this --
and I don't always go through saying, mark it this
way, but this is a heavy responsibility -- and I
would suggest to you, on the evidence and the law,
yes, she was addicted to cigarettes containing
nicotine.
And, of course, it was a cause of her
smoking enough to get COPD.
Now, we talk about the brands.
Yes, because
they took it over and carried the torch after they
wrestled her away as a customer.
And Philip Morris,
yes, because they're the ones that addicted this
teenager and hardwired her.
Yes, as to concealment.
Was it a legal cause
of her death?
Did it contribute, or was it just a
big coincidence?
I would suggest yes as to both.
The concealment, I would suggest yes as to
both.
They were in the conspiracy together to do
this.
You saw we presented mountains of documents
from both of them.
And it need not be just on one
or the other.
It can be either.
If the concealment 4318
and the fraud and the conspiracy as to the addiction
alone was enough to be yes, yes, as to the
concealing the health effects, yes, yes.
Not that
they were concealed, but what they did to conceal
the truth is, scientists do it, or it's not okay to
wait and see.
And this was the percentages that I talked to
you about.
And this is the warranted punitive
damages.
Under the circumstances of this case,
whether punitive damages are warranted against the
defendants, and I suggest yes, yes.
And if you answer that, we have a little more
work to do.
We have one more day of work to do.
And we come back just to present a very brief --
we're not starting from scratch, just a little more
evidence.
Then we will have an opportunity to try
to deter, to encourage, to encourage at this level
here, with you folks in Jacksonville, Florida, as
part of a process -- and no one ever knows which
step is going to be the one that counts most, but
every step counts -- to protect the next generation
of teenagers from this addiction, that they can get
out, they can get out.
And we've got these two companies who are the
leaders of the industry to try and encourage an 4319
industry-wide change.
Thank you.


MR. MITNIK:
Okay.
You're almost done from
hearing from all of us.
I've got all of this, not
enough time.
The good news, I don't have time.
The
bad news is I need more time because this is a
search for the truth and I want things in context.
And I'm -- I don't have time to put it all in
context, but I'm going to do the best I can.
Bear
with me, I'm going to talk a little fast.
First, Ms. Norgaard, we just heard about her
not really knowing if she smoked the Benson & Hedges
brand.
Well, there was a second section where she
went on, was asked about it, and she said clearly,
when asked, do you have a specific recollection that 4430
it was Benson & Hedges?
And she said, yes, and not
only that, that she bought them by the carton.
Lower smoking with teens.
You heard one in
four are starting today.
This was the Surgeon
General of the United States of America.
We put
this up for you.
Tobacco use in teens and young
adults remain shockingly high in the United States.
More than 3.6 million middle and high school
students smoke cigarettes.
In fact, for every one
that dies due to smoking, more than 1200 each day,
at least two youth or young adults become regular
smokers.
Nearly 90 percent of these replacement
smokers try their first cigarette by 18.
Clearly we
have not solved the problem.
This isn't some old
document.
That's now.
That's 2014.
But they sit here and I've listened to both.
It's -- it's -- it's -- it's Surgeon General's
fault.
It's somebody's fault.
It's not our fault.
We didn't do anything.
We get picked on.
And at
the end of the day, the worst we did was maybe say
some stupid things and maybe hung onto a couple
definitions, technical, too long.
You saw the
evidence.
That's the best they can come up with.
But we are here trying to -- in the only
language they understand, they talk about money and 4431
where the money's going.
You know what?
When it
comes to deterring and punishing, they're not
supposed to like it, but it's the only currency they
understand.
And we talked about this in voir dire, that if
it -- if the law was different and went somewhere
else, good, but that isn't the way the law is.
And
I -- some people said, I'd be bothered to the point
of distraction, and others said, you prove to me and
it's not going to get in the way at all.
Remember
A/B.
Every single one of you have said it wouldn't
stand in the way.
Because, you know, if you really want to take
on Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds and try to bring
about change in a court of law with people like you
coming in here, in Florida, that's always where it's
going to go.
That's always going to be the
argument.
And if it got in the way of the jurors,
you could never bring about change.
It is about
their conduct.
Risk reduction.
They talked about how the
doctor said if you quit by so-and-so date.
That's
one of the most reprehensible things in this case,
and it has directly to do with Patty Allen.
Because
had they been telling her, it isn't just your 4432
husband nagging; the Surgeon General isn't just
Chicken Little; there is no controversy; we made it
up; it was a lie; we got together and did it on
purpose to convince you you can keep smoking for a
while, it's too iffy.
Had they told her the truth -- and look, nobody
studied the science at that time more than they did.
You think they didn't know about risk reductions,
that if you told the truth, you'd give people a
chance and let them know that if you stop now, you
may be okay?
But they didn't.
They continued to
pile on what they called in their own words a
"holding strategy" while people were dying.
And
they want to say, well, what if you had just done it
sooner?
For them to say that?
I want to throw a quick analogy out because I
think it helps.
This idea on the legal cause
question -- and I say it need not be the sole cause?
Here's a simple concept, bicycle built for two, two
people pedaling in the same direction.
It isn't all
or one; more than one person contributes; more than
one thing contributes.
In this case, it's a bicycle
built for three.
Because I told you, they are trying to put the
floodlight, spotlight right on her.
How little they 4433
talked about themselves.
It's all she heard; she
heard; she heard.
One of the first things I said to
you when I stood up here is she heard; she had --
everybody heard.
This case isn't about if you
heard.
They would have you believe if she heard,
that's the end of it.
You know, if it was, who
would be the right smoker?
Everybody here.
Everybody's a wrong smoker under their analysis.
Everybody heard.
The question is what were you
doing?
It's like somebody who takes someone,
intentionally trips them, and when they fall down
and get hurt badly, you say, now, wait a minute,
other people kept their feet and didn't fall.
That's all on you.
Don't look at me.
Important, you heard -- you know what they
didn't talk about she heard?
That it was a heavily
addictive drug, like heroin, that they knew all
along, celebrated in private.
Because, you know, if
you find the concealment to the addiction
contributed as a meaningful way to getting her
hooked and we know the hook is what was a
contributing cause to this whole ugly story, if it's
the concealing the addiction only, then the answer
to those questions on the verdict form are yes.
It
doesn't have to be concealing lung disease and 4434
concealing.
Look at the law the judge gave you, either one.
If you concealed and conspired and it hurts
somebody, you don't get off the hook because you
say, I'm going to pick one side of it.
They hardly
even talked about concealing addiction because they
don't have anything to say about that side.
I'm going to go over these.
I want to say a
couple of quick things.
I'm going to run out of
time.
I'm going to be kicking myself if I don't get
to a couple of these.
Hold on one second.
They kept saying if you say yes to concealment,
the percentage of the fault doesn't come down.
And
that's the law.
Once again, we didn't pick the law.
It is the law.
We have knowledge responsibility,
but under the law, that doesn't fit on those torts,
those causes of action.
And they -- are they suggesting to you that if
the evidence shows it, just don't say yes to those
because of the way the law works if you don't like
it?
We were way too hard on all those people to get
folks who weren't going to follow this law to
wherever this evidence led.
Another one, Thanksgiving.
Say no.
We all go
and enjoy Thanksgiving.
Well, we worked too hard. 4435
You people are too committed to this process to take
a shortcut.
Everybody wants to get home.
But let's
finish a hard job, one more day, and let's do
something that matters under the law and the
evidence in this case.
Over and over, how many times did we hear these
phrases?
It didn't prevent her from quitting.
She
could quit.
It didn't prevent her from quitting.
It could quit.
Remember one of the first slides I
put up in opening was a slide that said, can you
quit isn't the question.
You don't have to take my
word for it anymore.
His Honor has told you the
question.
Look through there and find something
that says can you quit?
You remember those old documents that were up,
where it said our lawyers or the lawyers tell us if
it is free -- if addiction comes out, we can't keep
defending free choice?
Two of them.
To some extent
the argument revolving around free choice is being
negated on the grounds of addiction.
Cigarette
smoking is more addictive than using heroin.
We're
citing a quote.
We can't defend continued smoking
as free choice if the person was addicted.
And then the scare document, the scare tactic
document I'm going to put up that shows 90 percent 4436
could quit cold turkey.
It's all choice.
It's just
enjoyment.
Well, now, there's no way around it.
They're
addicted.
They can't deny that.
You've got these
Engle findings.
But where are we?
Well, we got
Abramson who comes in and says, well, even if you
are, it wouldn't make any difference because it
doesn't cause anyone to smoke unless they're
mentally damaged.
It's all just choice.
How many
times did the word "choice" come off the defendants'
lips?
It isn't about whether she had a choice.
You
heard Dr. Burns, said this person couldn't quit.
Now, he doesn't mean physically impossible.
It
doesn't work that way.
But she was overwhelmed by
it, was unable to be successful at it.
The question
isn't could you quit.
Here's another.
Remember, they started out
wrong smoker?
Well, here's a question.
If they say
everyone can quit and it is possible for everyone to
quit, some really overwhelming never are, but it is
physically -- it is literally possible for everyone
to quit.
If the question was could you quit, if
that was the question, who would ever be a right
smoker? 4437
But it isn't the question, hallelujah.
The
question is:
Was she addicted, and was the
addiction one of the reasons she smoked so
frequently and for so long and resisted what would
have been otherwise rational movements?
By the way, those were not out for Patty Dawn
Allen to see.
Those were in deep, dark, secret
places.
They got triers.
You'll see.
They said Benson & Hedges -- Benson & Hedges
menthols didn't come out until 1968.
You -- look,
this is a search for the truth.
Y'all take notes.
Dr. Cummings told you they came out in 1966.
That's
just not what the evidence was.
MR. KELLY:
Objection, Your Honor, that
misstates the evidence.
THE COURT:
Well, that's -- that's for the jury
to decide.
The argument of counsel is just argument.
You
are the ones who decide what the facts are based
upon the evidence.
MR. MITNIK:
I want to get this real quick.
This is the stuff about -- you keep hearing about
the -- the back pain she had and about the weight
issues.
I want to show you a little something.
It's all in the records.
These are little summaries 4438
for you, just to make it easier.
Because nowhere on
your question is it going to be did she have any
problem with -- with being -- wanting to be thin and
being -- spending too much time wanting to be thin
or whatever definition you put on it.
That's got
nothing to do with it.
They're trying to make it
sound like, oh, yeah, you have this problem so you
couldn't be addicted, or, oh, you had a little
depression so you can't be addicted, or oh, you have
some back pain; you're on some back medications so
you can't be addicted.
The question is:
Was she addicted?
Not
whether she had bangs and bumps and bruises and
hardships of life.
That's life.
But I want you to see something.
This is on
the pain medication.
She, no question, had pain
medication.
No question on one note.
The doctor
really just sounded like it was all the time
horrible.
But let's really look at the -- pain
medication is a very good measuring stick of -- as
Mr. Allen said, yeah, she had a back problem, but
she continued on and did things, and it kind of came
and went.
Now, there's evidence in the case.
And
they put up these records.
So let's look.
This is a ten-month period where she was on -- 4439
Flexeril -- Flexeril, which a muscle relaxant, and
then Darvocet, which is pain.
That is for a
ten-month period.
She was diagnosed with the COPD
right there.
Then six months go.
Now, you see when
she's using her medicines, she's filling them up.
Six months, no medications filled.
Then here we
are, refilled for 9/16 and 9/15.
Nine months go by,
no prescription refills.
Then we have a
one-and-a-half month period, then nine more months
with no refills.
And then in '99, three -- over
three years with no refills.
I'm not suggesting she didn't have back pain.
I'm suggesting they're overplaying their hand on
back because we'd rather talk about anything but
addiction.
Let's talk about weight.
Mrs. Allen, the
medical records they've been parading around.
We
just pulled them out in a summary form for you.
Here's her weight:
108, 105, 106, 100, 102, 103,
112, 118.
That's when she's diagnosed with COPD.
Let's keep following.
114, 14, 17, 18, 19, 15, 14.
Her dad dies.
Her weight drops significantly
right after her daddy died.
Weight's down.
Weight's down.
Weight starts coming back.
Weight
starts coming back.
We're now getting out away from 4440
the date of her dad's death.
Mom dies.
Weight
drops down.
Now she's hospitalized.
This is when
she can't breathe hardly and no longer can suck air
in enough to smoke a cigarette, even though she
wants to and is on oxygen and her weight's down.
And, in fact, it actually goes back to 106.
She's
thin.
What's that got to do with the defense or an
excuse for that?
Okay.
What have you got?
One more.
These are critical.
You have these pictures?
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:
Yes.
MR. MITNIK:
Pull them up, please.
Now, remember, they're saying -- their
suggestion is her whole life, she's been blaming her
anorexic -- just a wreck with this weight stuff her
whole life.
Let's look.
Pictures are worth 1,000
words.
There she is.
Next.
That's not high school.
Next.
There she is shortly before she was diagnosed
with COPD.
Does that look like some anorexic, sick
woman?
That's right before she was diagnosed on a
cruise with her husband.
Now, there she is with her family.
And Amber.
Now, let's look what she looks like after 4441
diagnosis.
But let's find for R. J. Reynolds and Philip
Morris because they say she got anorexic.
According to their expert, you can't be
addicted with the DSM-5 unless you're in this
extreme state that someone who couldn't work anymore
because they couldn't make it to a break and smoke.
That person may run out and be miserable and as soon
as the break time, suck it down in the cold and the
rain and come back and do that every break and at
lunch and all the way home and first thing, but they
wouldn't be addicted because they didn't have to
quit their job.
That's who they brought you.
They talk about witnesses we brought.
They
talk about Andy Allen, Jr.
We can bring witnesses
until we turn into the Engle trial.
At some point,
we quit calling witnesses.
And Andy was too old at
the time he died to have a claim.
But they have his
depo, what he says.
But who did they call?
A person?
Has anyone denied that they're still targeting
teens?
Ms. Allen never said, her daughter, I started
smoking or changed a brand because I saw this ad.
Imagine if she had take -- that young lady had taken 4442
this stand and said, my mom told me that on July
12th, 1998, she switched because she saw this ad
that said so-and-so.
Who on earth would believe
her?
But they say that's what's required or they
get a, no, we're not responsible.
They say that she never said to her husband, I
did this for this ad.
That's a badge of the
truthfulness.
How easy would it be for these two to
come in here and say, let me -- I've got the
checklist.
Let's just say it all.
But she isn't
walking around having those kind of conversations
with her husband.
But what they say she never said,
that, boy, there was any kind of conspiracy or fraud
or they did anything wrong?
She filed a lawsuit.
MR. BELASIC:
Objection, Your Honor, the
lawsuit's not evidence.
That's why we have the
trial.
MR. MITNIK:
Judge, they brought it up over and
over, over my objection.
MR. BELASIC:
It's not evidence.
Objection.
THE COURT:
I think it's obvious that the
lawsuit was brought so overrule the objection.
MR. MITNIK:
She died before her deposition was
taken, so we don't have her testimony here.
And
they're trying to exploit that.
They exploited her 4443
during her life, and here's the way we can bring
that to the conclusion in this courtroom.
MR. BELASIC:
Objection, Your Honor.
That
violates your order in favor of the defendants.
MR. MITNIK:
I'm talking about the defendants.
THE COURT:
Right.
But the deposition and
activities of the lawsuit should not be considered
by the jury.
MR. MITNIK:
They keep saying, what about this
and Mrs. Allen?
There was nothing personal about
this conspiracy and fraud with Ms. Allen, nothing
personal.
It was cold and calculated.
The only
people it's personal to is her family.
She tried
hypnosis, patches, nicotine, Wellbutrin, cold
turkey.
None of it worked.
Told she's going to
die.
None of it worked.
Told her daughter, I don't
like it, don't you ever touch them.
I'm addicted
but they say no.
And they say, well, how would we
ever know if she was addicted before she tried?
For goodness sake.
We don't check our common
sense at the door.
You think she was in that shape,
addicted and smoking two packs a day since 18 years
old and if we moved it back, that she wasn't
addicted?
Let's look at the logic.
If you're addicted, 4444
it -- if you don't try, you're not addicted.
But if
you do try, guess what, the conspiracy must not have
worked because you're trying.
And if you do try it,
by the way, or don't and you happen to be addicted,
Abramson will tell you, so what?
The question's
still, no, the question.
Here's what they knew about nicotine addiction.
In the business of selling nicotine, an addictive
drug.
'63, behind the scenes, closed doors, in
designing any cigarette product, the down
specification should be nicotine delivery.
'72,
behind the scenes, confidential, nicotine, a potent
drug, industry's based upon it, sale and attractive,
the dosage source of nicotine.
The cigarette's a delivery device.
That's what
they knew, but they stood up before Congress and
swore and denied it.
And they sure didn't tell
Ms. Allen.
And if they had it would have changed
the course.
Who would start up on something when
they were told when they were young, it's going to
kill you, and you're likely to get hooked like
heroin?
Find something else to express yourself.
But then everybody else wouldn't have been
doing it all around her, police and doctors and
everybody else.
You think what they did didn't have 4445
an impact on this case?
And they want to say, everybody knew at the
turn of the century.
She knew all about addiction.
Why don't they talk to you about this document?
How
much time did they spend explaining that?
Brown &
Williamson is R. J. Reynolds.
Very few customers
are aware of the effects of nicotine, it is -- its
addictive nature and that nicotine is a poison.
If
she knew and everybody knew, why aren't they
explaining that to you?
Not a word.
By the way, they put up, again, the reason she
started.
And they just left out one of them,
glamorous.
But you heard it.
Y'all took notes.
The very person they put up that said peers and
weight, said, and it was glamorous to everybody.
And they leave that out.
Because you know what?
That sounds less like it might be their fault.
And
I'm not saying all their fault, folks.
We're
talking about they significantly contributed to the
fault here and we're here to prove that.
The polls.
They showed the polls.
I don't
have time to go back over the polls.
The polls they
kept showing, you heard from Dr. Cummings that
people thought it cut your wind and gave you throat
scratch.
It wasn't about dying. 4446
The polls that showed it caused a death was a
big disparity between heard it because everybody
heard it and believed it and a much bigger disparity
between those who believed it and smoked and didn't
smoke, which you know fits to a tee, Patty Dawn's
family.
Her parents never said, it's going to kill
you, just don't do it.
They smoked.
Her sister,
who didn't smoke, said, stop, it's going to kill
you.
That's the difference.
They say that Patty Dawn knew -- knew, that was
their word -- knew that it was deadly.
Where's that
evidence?
Had she heard it?
Absolutely.
Their
whole conspiracy was to take no and convert it into
a muddy mess that wouldn't set.
And when someone's
addicted, it is the set hard, cold facts to get to
that level of personal threat.
Nobody said she
knew.
Everybody admits she heard.
It's a
life-and-death difference.
But the scientists couldn't agree, so wait and
see.
That was their message.
So when he said it,
she said it, fell on deaf ears because of what they
did.
They say, what have we got to do with this?
You've got --
THE COURT:
In timing, I made a little bit of a
mistake and gave them -- 4447
MR. MITNIK:
I think they got --
THE COURT:
About 20 after, 21 after.
MR. MITNIK:
There's virtually no evidence that
the warning statement on the cigarette package had
any significant effect.
Cigarette sales were high.
Were they all on the cigarettes?
Yes, they were.
Were they working?
No, they weren't.
Guess who
knew?
Them.
They come in here and say they were on
there.
They were.
Remember, I asked everybody on
the jury, does anybody think that if there are
warning labels on it, then you shouldn't be able to
sue?
Some of it, a lot of people did.
Not y'all.
1968, fourth-graders, fourth-graders.
This
ain't even to the principal.
It's to the students,
the class.
There's pitching the conspiracy to the
kids.
But that isn't ancient history.
1990, to the principal.
Nobody knows.
Scientists can't agree.
1990.
There's no need to punish and deter?
I beg to
differ based on the evidence, not what the lawyers
say.
Filters, I want to say this.
They've said
"choice" 100 times.
If I had more -- if I had 20
minutes, I'd fill it with filters, filters, filters
because they have everything to do with why they're 4448
responsible.
They said nobody -- nobody -- you
can't point to a single ad that says filters are
safer.
Of course not.
You heard Dr. Cummings.
If
they said they're safer, what would they be
admitting?
They're dangerous.
They were not going
to say safer because that meant dangerous.
But what they did through the packaging and the
imaging was to make sure everyone felt they were
safer.
And we know from the FTC that they worked
unbelievably, and everybody switched over because
they thought they were safer.
But they say there
wasn't anything on the package she saw.
There
wasn't anything like that on any package.
But we
got the wrong smoker.
But the problem is with those
arguments, everyone's the wrong smoker.
Misled the public about safety.
The industry
does not believe that there are any bad elements.
If there are any bad elements, they will be removed.
These are external statements.
Here, this is internal.
We say, here is our
triple, quadruple, quintuple filter, capable of
removing whatever constituents of smoke are
currently suspect.
That was their aim.
The smoker
of the filter cigarette was getting as much or more
nicotine and tar than he would have gotten from a 4449
regular cigarette.
That's not them.
That -- excuse me.
Is that an internal?
That's internal, what they're really saying.
The
illusion of filtration is what they're really
saying.
And the Surgeon General says, new designs
were used by tobacco industry as a tool to undermine
prevention and cessation efforts.
And she never picked up a cigarette, of any
evidence in this case, that wasn't filtered.
So
when she started way back in that other time and
place, they were 13 years into conspiracy, hiding
addiction, hiding the truth that there is no
dispute; there is no controversy; it's made up and
offered false, fraudulent, safe-seeming fixes.
Let's talk about their choices while you're
pulling that up.
They made the choice -- choices to do the
additives and the engineering for inhalability and
addiction.
They choose to add the chemicals to
increase the addictiveness of nicotine.
They choose
to spray the nicotine back on the cigarettes.
They
choose to trick the FTC machines to make the low
tars look like something they weren't.
They choose
to promote indirectly that the filters and the low
tars were safer.
They chose to conspire.
They 4450
chose to conceal.
And it's one billion a year in advertising,
more than one day -- they spent more in one day than
the clearinghouse spent the entire year.
Cigarettes
remained one of the most heavily marketed products
in the United States with more than $250 billion and
-- and $206 -- expended between 1940 and 2005 on
cigarette advertising and promotion.
And they would
walk in here and tell you it doesn't work.
They're
just wasting their money.
Because it worked so
well.
That's why it worked so well.
People don't
think they're being led to it.
Nicotine and disease, what we know.
Surgeon
General Report, 2010.
Highly addictive drug,
despite what their witness they hired and paid
said.
Addiction keeps people smoking.
That's legal
cause.
There it is, from the Surgeon General of the
United States of America.
Are you going to believe
him or Abramson?
Design for addiction.
Addiction -- addictive
and chemicals that help make them more addictive.
Filtered, low tars and lights, cigarettes are every
bit as addictive, are no safer.
Putting something up or are we done back there? 4451
THE COURT:
You have about three minutes.
MR. MITNIK:
I know.
I'm saying, you guys got anything else before I
wrap up?
They're back there furiously looking at
the clips.
I got one while they're looking real quick.
They say that she quit for five months, according to
Dr. Kirley's records.
Well, let's look at that with
the totality of the evidence.
Here's what you've
got.
She hadn't seen him for five months.
And she
had quit as of the last visit, tried to quit, tried
to stop as of the last visit, and she came back five
months later and walks into the office.
And he
figures out she's been smoking.
I -- I wasn't there
but doctors know what cigarettes smell like.
And
she says, I started back two weeks ago.
Now, it
could have been.
That is what she told the doctor.
Except we have another piece of evidence.
I'm
not just speculating.
We have Mr. Allen.
When he
said she quit for five months, no, she never quit
for five months.
A couple weeks.
And half their
case has been about the five months.
And there's
some evidence.
But how strong is that evidence in
the real world?
You think he would have known after
pleading with her if she quit for five months? 4452
She went through all of those quit attempts.
You heard the testimony about Chantix, which is the
drug that works with the brain level, and even that
is a -- got -- I forgot -- 70 percent failure rate
or something.
But it was the best that's come
along.
That wasn't available until after she had --
unable to inhale.
Is that it?
THE COURT:
One minute.
One minute remaining.
MR. MITNIK:
Here we go.
Truth matters, folks.
Truth matters.
Consequences matter, particularly
under these circumstances.
Consequences matter.
These defendants would not tell the truth.
They
knew what the consequences would be to millions and
it's still going on today.
And Patty Allen may not
have been door-to-door knocking.
They may not have
came to her first but they cast a big net and they
drug her in and did everything in their power to
keep her from getting out of the net.
And she ended
up on the deck with millions of others, gasping for
air.
And you know what they did?
They got a bunch
of replacement smokers that were teenagers and she
was one of them.
And as a result of being one of
them, she brings an opportunity here.
It doesn't 4453
come along often.
THE COURT:
All right.
Conclude your remarks.
MR. MITNIK:
I ask you, please, based on the
evidence and the law, to bring back a verdict that
says yes, all the way down to punitive damages.
And
please bear with us one more day, where I can lay
out a plan to talk about.
Can't talk about it now,
but I can lay out a plan to do something.
Thank you.
