25       case. MR. FURR:  May it please the Court?
2           Ms. Banks, Katrina, Counsel.
3           Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
4           Boy, have I been anxious to get up and have
5       a chance to talk to you.  But I've got to
6       start -- I'd like to jump in, but let me say one
7       or two things preliminary first.
8           First, we've got to thank you for your
9       service, and most importantly, I want to thank
10       you for your patience, because you sure have had
11       to be patient.  This case should have taken
12       about three or four days to try; instead we've
13       spent almost two weeks here, and the reason is
14       you spent day after day listening to evidence
15       and witnesses that have nothing to do with the
16       issues that you're here to decide, as the
17       verdict form will demonstrate, once you actually
18       see what you're here to decide.
19           This morning you listened to an hour and a
20       half closing argument that was designed to make
21       you angry and to distract you from the issues
22       that you're actually here to decide, designed to
23       make you angry --
24           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Judge, I object.  They
25       can't derogate the plaintiff's case in this courtroom.
2           THE COURT:  Overruled.
3           You can continue, sir.
4           MR. FURR:  -- designed to make you angry at
5       the tobacco companies so you will overlook the
6       plaintiff's complete inability to prove their
7       claims in this case.  Because this is a case
8       about George Banks.  It's not about generic
9       smokers.  It's not about all smokers.  It's not
10       about any other smoker.
11           So let's refocus on what the issues will be
12       here for you to decide, what the evidence is and
13       what the legal instructions are, so that you
14       have a roadmap.  And I'm going to start with the
15       first question, not the eighteenth question.
16       I'm going to start in the beginning where you
17       all will have to start.
18           But let's remind ourselves, the case is
19       about Mr. Banks.  The clearest, easiest way to
20       see it's about Mr. Banks is you're going to get
21       a verdict form that the Court read to you and
22       that's going to be your verdict.  You fill out
23       this form.  I've highlighted them, you'll see
24       this, there are 18 questions; 17 of them have
25       the name of George Banks in the question.  In several of those questions his name appears more
2       than once.  This is a case about Mr. Banks.
3           It's a long verdict form, there are lots of
4       questions, but there are actually only a few
5       issues that just repeat themself throughout the
6       verdict form.  So what I'm going to do is focus
7       on those issues and try to give you a roadmap as
8       to how those issues appear sequentially in
9       different parts of the verdict form.
10           But I want to be clear about something.
11       There has been a complete failure by the
12       plaintiffs to meet their burden of proof.  They
13       have to prove their claims to you and they
14       haven't been able to do it.
15           Let's talk about what was done.
16           You all probably know what a red herring is.
17       A red herring, that's a figure of expression.  A
18       red herring is something that is designed to
19       distract you and to mislead you away from the
20       real issues in the case and then take your eye
21       off the ball and get you looking somewhere else
22       as opposed to what you're supposed to be doing.
23           I submit, ladies and gentlemen, that what
24       was done during the last two weeks is the
25       plaintiffs have poured a barrel of red herrings in the courtroom that will not help you decide
2       the case about George Banks.  And I could talk
3       for a long time about it, but it's going to
4       distract us from what we're doing so I'm going
5       to try to do this briefly, because I think it's
6       important to understand a few things.  Because
7       the red herrings that the plaintiffs poured in
8       the courtroom really fall into three categories.
9       For each of those categories we need to take a
10       step back and look at, what was the actual
11       evidence on this issue and what did it have to
12       do with Mr. Banks, because your inquiry should
13       always come back to what does this evidence have
14       to do with Mr. Banks.  That should be your
15       yardstick for every piece of evidence you look
16       at you say, what does this have to do with
17       Mr. Banks.
18           The red herrings go into three general
19       categories:  Addiction design, youth marketing
20       and generic evidence.
21           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, take that down
22       for a second.  Your Honor, can I approach?
23           THE COURT:  Yes, you can approach, sir.
24           (The following discussion was held at
25 sidebar:) THE COURT:  What's your objection?
2           MR. SCHLESINGER:  I object to them
3       denigrating the offense in this case.  They are
4       so intensively arguing to Your Honor that we may
5       not run down the defense or attack the
6       defendants for defending the case.  Now they are
7       attacking the plaintiff for bringing the case.
8       And every one of those issues is instructed by
9       Your Honor.  You let all that evidence in and
10       that is not argument, that is attacking the
11       plaintiff's case.  And if they're going to say
12       we can't attack them, then they can't attack us.
13           THE COURT:  You can attack the evidence just
14       like they can attack the evidence.
15           MR. SCHLESINGER:  I agree, but that's not
16       what he's doing.  He told the jury that we waste
17       the Court's time, we took too long to do the
18       case and that our case is a red herring; that is
19       attacking the --
20           MR. FURR:  I'll rephrase it from attacking.
21           THE COURT:  You'll rephrase and you can
22       cover it in rebuttal.
23           (Sidebar discussion was concluded, and the
24 following proceedings were held in open court:)
25           MR. FURR:  May I proceed, Your Honor? THE COURT:  You may, sir.
2           MR. FURR:  What I'm focusing on, ladies and
3       gentlemen, is the evidence before you and
4       whether it's helpful or not or whether it's a
5       red herring that causes you to take your eye off
6       the evidence that does help you decide the
7       issues in the case.
8           There are three general barrels these red
9       herrings fit into.
10           One is this idea of addiction design.  I'll
11       tell you all what I mean by that in just a
12       minute.
13           Second, youth marketing.
14           And third, this concept of using generic
15       evidence to prove Mr. Banks' case.  We'll look
16       at that and we'll look at the facts real quickly
17       and then what it has to do with this case.
18           Addiction design, what I mean by that is
19       you've heard over and over throughout the case
20       that tobacco companies do something to design
21       the cigarette to make it more addictive.
22           There's been suggestions that they use
23       additives to make it more addictive.  There's
24       been suggestion that they've done something to
25       the nicotine to make it more inhalable and that makes it more addictive.  And suggestions that
2       they've done something to make the nicotine pass
3       through the blood and get to the brain faster in
4       an attempt to make it more addictive.
5           Let's look at what the evidence actually was
6       as opposed to the arguments that were made.  And
7       we'll use their own witnesses because their own
8       witnesses disprove all of these things.
9           You remember Dr. Proctor, the historian from
10       from California, and Dr. DiFranza, the internal
11       medicine doctor from Massachusetts.
12           First both of them told you that cigarettes
13       are dangerous and addictive by nature.  Tobacco
14       companies don't make them dangerous and
15       addictive.  If you burn a leaf it has all the
16       same carcinogens in it as a cigarette does.  It
17       has even more nicotine in it than ultimately the
18       cigarette does.  That's the nature of the
19       product.
20           When you think about this claim that the
21       tobacco companies did something to make
22       cigarettes more addictive, if that were the case
23       then some cigarettes should be more addictive
24       than other cigarettes.  Common sense.
25           Here's what Dr. Proctor admitted to you. Filtered full-flavored, light low-tar and
2       additive-free cigarettes are equally addictive.
3       He told you that additive-free cigarettes are
4       equally addictive as cigarettes with additives.
5       It can't be the additives that makes it
6       addictive.
7           This whole issue of inhalability -- excuse
8       me, roll-your-owns.  You know, they keep reading
9       things to you saying today's cigarettes are more
10       addictive than ever were before, but listen to
11       what their own expert said.  Roll-your-own
12       cigarettes and cigarettes from the 1800s are
13       just as dangerous and addictive as manufactured
14       cigarettes, cigarettes from the 1800s.
15           If that's the case, which their own expert
16       admitted under cross-examination, then all these
17       theories about what's been done to make
18       cigarettes more addictive fall down.  They've
19       had no effect.  Their own experts admit that.
20           They've also told you that cigarettes cannot
21       be made safe.  This morning there was an
22       argument made to you about here's what the
23       tobacco companies should do:  They should do X,
24       should do Y, should do Z to make their
25       cigarettes safe.  Dr. Proctor told you they can't be made safe and the only safe cigarette
2       is the one that's not lit.  That's their own
3       expert.
4           What else did their experts tell you?
5           Inhalability, throughout the case you've
6       heard that the tobacco companies did something
7       to make the smoke inhalable and that's what
8       caused cigarettes to be dangerous.  Well, that's
9       not what their expert said.  Their experts told
10       you that cigarettes have always been inhalable.
11           Dr. Proctor told you that back in the 1800s
12       people studying tobacco recognized that
13       cigarettes were more dangerous than other forms
14       of tobacco because they were inhalable, nature
15       of the product.
16           Dr. DiFranza shot down both of their
17       theories about cigarette design and addiction.
18       He told you first that the inhalability of
19       cigarettes is not what causes them to be
20       addictive.  And he explained to you that chewing
21       tobacco is addictive too.  Therefore, it's not
22       the inhalability.
23           Dr. DiFranza also told you that the speed in
24       which nicotine is inhaled and goes to the brain
25       has nothing to do with making smoking addictive. And, again, he used the common-sense explanation
2       that chewing tobacco is addictive too.
3           Their experts rejected both of those
4       theories.
5           Let's turn to youth marketing.  You've seen
6       this trial.  You've seen plaintiffs attempt to
7       insert the word "kids" and "children" into this
8       case --
9           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor.
10           MR. FURR:  -- over and over.
11           THE COURT:  Overruled.
12           MR. FURR:  Over and over.  We objected and
13       it's been sustained.  In fact --
14           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor.
15           THE COURT:  Don't comment on the evidence
16       that's been sustained, Mr. Furr.  Sustained.
17           MR. FURR:  Let's look at what the Court told
18       you.  Judge Tuter told you on February 13th --
19           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor.
20           MR. SKWRAO:  Ladies and gentlemen --
21           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Take that down.  Your
22       Honor, your instruction --
23           MR. FURR:  Take it down.  Take it down.
24           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor.
25       That's not an appropriate use of the record. THE COURT:  What's the legal basis of your
2       objection, please, Mr. Schlesinger?
3           MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's not the jury
4       instruction.  It's not argument.  It's not
5       evidence.
6           THE COURT:  What was that, Mr. Furr?
7           MR. FURR:  The curative instruction you gave
8       the jury, a transcript slide of your
9       instruction, Your Honor.
10           THE COURT:  Let me see it.
11           You can use it.  Overruled.
12           MR. FURR:  Cliff, if counsel or anyone ask
13       you to take it down, don't wait for me to take
14       it down.  As soon as an officer of the Court
15       asks you to, okay?
16           VIDEO TECH:  Okay.
17           MR. FURR:  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
18       You might recall Judge Tuter clearing things up
19       for us when he told you, "Ladies and gentlemen,
20       this case is not about kids or children.  It's
21       not about kids or children.  It's about
22       Mr. Banks and the two defendants that they've
23       sued."
24           Let's look at youth marketing a little
25       closer and why it's a red herring.  First of all, there's zero evidence that Mr. Banks
2       started smoking because of advertising.  Who
3       told you that Mr. Banks started smoking because
4       of advertising?  No one.  No one.  It's entirely
5       speculation.
6           Second, the medical records, and
7       Mr. Schlesinger candidly admitted this in his
8       closing this morning, the medical records
9       indicated that Mr. Banks started smoking when he
10       was about 24 years old.  Now, their expert said
11       maybe it was a year or two before because he
12       might have had -- he might have started at a
13       lower amount of smoking before he got to a pack,
14       but the experts, even on cross-examination his
15       expert said, might have been a year or two
16       before.  Clearly an adult when he started.
17           There is zero credible evidence that
18       Mr. Banks started smoking as a youth.  There's
19       just not any.
20           But I'm going to be comprehensive and we're
21       going to talk about the evidence they do have
22       and talk about what it means.  You all might not
23       even remember this.  But yesterday afternoon on
24       the cross-examination of Dr. Hoge at the
25       eleventh hour the plaintiffs asked Dr. Hoge: Didn't Mrs. Banks say that he started smoking as
2       a youth?   Now, she never told you that.  She
3       didn't testify about when he started.  And
4       there's a good reason for that.  Because you
5       heard the redirect that Mr. Keehfus did of
6       Dr. Hoge and Dr. Hoge told you what Mrs. Banks
7       actually said in her sworn deposition testimony.
8           Here's what she said.  She was asked, "Did
9       you ever ask him when he started smoking?"
10           And her answer was no.
11           "Did you ever have any discussions about his
12       smoking before you two met?
13           "No.
14           "Do you have any knowledge of when he
15       started smoking.
16           "No."
17           That was all that you heard from her 2012
18       sworn deposition testimony that she gave before
19       she got sick.  And she is sick and we all feel
20       sorry for her and it may have affected her
21       memory.  And nobody's criticizing her for that.
22       But that's why we keep bringing to you the
23       evidence from her deposition that she gave
24       before she got sick.  That's why we spent so
25       much time showing you what she said when she was in better shape and her memory was in better
2       shape.
3           Generic evidence.  You know, you keep
4       hearing this theory, he was a generic smoker, he
5       was a generic smoker.  He wasn't.  He was an
6       individual whose biography whose personal story
7       are the facts you need to decide this case.
8           What kind of evidence was brought to you?
9       Dr. Proctor from California came.  We had some
10       fun talking to him.  It's obvious he and I have
11       talked about these issues before, but it's
12       important what he told you.  Remember, he's been
13       paid almost 2 million dollars to testify against
14       tobacco companies.  And yet he came here and
15       provided to you only generic evidence.  He
16       didn't know when Mr. Banks started smoking, what
17       cigarettes he smoked.  He didn't even know what
18       disease -- he came here and said he didn't know
19       what disease he had, but then I reminded him
20       that in fact he knew it was esophageal cancer --
21       and that's important, we'll get to that in a
22       moment -- and he told you that he didn't review
23       the deposition and he didn't review medical
24       records.
25           I mean, Dr. Proctor, with all due respect, he sort of willfully chose not to learn the
2       facts of the case.  Because what he also told
3       you is that -- you remember what his testimony
4       was about; his testimony was about the tobacco
5       company's conduct, and he said they advertised
6       and they hid the truth and they confused people
7       about the dangers of smoking.  I'm not here to
8       debate all those issues in the abstract.  That
9       was the class action.  We're not here to
10       challenge the class action findings.  What we're
11       here to do, what your tasked to do is to figure
12       out how those findings apply to Mr. George
13       Banks.
14           Here's what Dr. Proctor told you.  He knows
15       of no evidence that Mr. Banks started smoking
16       because of advertising.  He knows of no evidence
17       that Mr. Banks relied on statements by any
18       tobacco company.  And he knows of no evidence
19       that Mr. Banks was ever confused about the
20       dangers of smoking.  And you know that the
21       reason he doesn't know of any evidence is
22       because there is none.  There is no evidence of
23       any of those things.  You didn't hear it during
24       the trial.  You didn't hear it this morning.
25           Instead the plaintiffs spent the whole case reproving the Engle findings.  The general
2       findings at the class action where really what
3       they spent the majority of their case on.  They
4       don't have to reprove those findings.  You heard
5       the instruction this morning, they don't have to
6       be proven, they can't be challenged.
7           Now, they have some limitations how they can
8       be used.  They can't be used to determine class
9       membership.  They can't be used to determine
10       whether punitive damages should be awarded.
11           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection.
12           THE COURT:  Once again, ladies and
13       gentlemen, I instructed you on that.  If the
14       lawyers say anything that disagrees with my
15       instructions always follow my instructions.
16           You may proceed.
17           MR. FURR:  They can't be used to determine
18       legal causation and they don't prove anything
19       about whether the tobacco companies are liable
20       to Mr. Banks, that's why you're here.
21           But why did they spend their whole time
22       reproving those cases and taking two weeks to do
23       it?  Here's the answer.  Because they have the
24       burden to prove their case to you, but they have
25       no evidence about Mr. Banks.  They have no evidence about Mr. Banks.
2           And I'm going to go right back to where we
3       started in opening statement, because there's a
4       huge gap in this case.  Nobody knows anything
5       about Mr. Banks before 1970 when he's 57 years
6       old.  He lived virtually a complete life.  He
7       was on the verge of retirement when Mrs. Banks
8       met him.
9           Here's what we know.  Well, let's look at it
10       from this perspective.  Think back before this
11       case started.  Had you asked yourself:  What do
12       we know before the case starts about Mr. Banks'
13       smoking from 1914 to 1970, I think your answer
14       would have had to be nothing.  You wouldn't have
15       known anything.  What do you know at the end of
16       this case after you've heard all the evidence
17       that the plaintiffs have?  Same thing, you don't
18       know anything about his smoking between 1914 and
19       1970.  And there's a reason for that.
20           Nobody ever saw Mr. Banks smoking before the
21       1970s.  Now, I acknowledge the medical records
22       take his smoking back to '38.  I'm not
23       challenging what the medical records say about
24       when he might have begun smoking.  But the point
25       is, there's no eyewitness that can tell you why he started or what he started smoking or who he
2       smoked with or how much he smoked or anything
3       like that.  There is no witness who saw what
4       brand he smoked before 1970.
5           Here's a case where the plaintiffs are
6       alleging they should be awarded, it sounds like
7       they're really only asking for $500,000 now, you
8       heard millions during voir dire, but in any
9       event, they're asking you for a large sum of
10       money to be awarded against RJ Reynolds and
11       Philip Morris, but no one knows whose cigarettes
12       Mr. Banks smoked before 1970.  Could have been
13       another company's, could have been
14       roll-your-own, no one knows.
15           Here's what we do know.  Here's what we do
16       know, though, in a case where the plaintiffs are
17       asking for a large sum of money from RJ Reynolds
18       and Philip Morris we know that every pack of
19       RJ Reynolds' cigarettes and Philip Morris'
20       cigarettes that anyone ever saw Mr. Banks
21       smoking carried a warning, carried a warning
22       that said, "The Surgeon General has determined
23       that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your
24       health."
25           Think about this.  One of the basic claims in this case, and it's throughout your verdict
2       form and I'll show them to you in just a few
3       minutes, is that Mr. Banks died because he
4       didn't know that smoking was dangerous because
5       RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris concealed that
6       from him.  That's a claim.
7           How can that be?  Every pack of our
8       cigarettes that anybody can testify to that he
9       ever smoked had this warning on the side of the
10       packs.  And we're going to talk about what
11       Mr. Lampe said about this warning and, more
12       importantly, what Yvonne said about this warning
13       to George.
14           And by the way, I have to refer to Yvonne
15       and Katrina during the course of my closing.
16       It's kind of a little awkward because they're in
17       the courtroom and they're human and they're
18       there.  And I don't mean any disrespect to them
19       and I'm not trying to be rude to them, but we
20       have to talk about the evidence that they gave,
21       that's why I'm talking about them.  I mean no
22       disrespect to these ladies who are sitting right
23       here to my right.
24           What else do we know?  You know, the claim
25       in this case is that Mr. Banks was a compulsive chain-smoking nicotine addict.  That's the basic
2       claim.  They're claiming that because he was a
3       compulsive chain-smoking nicotine addict that
4       they should be given money.
5           Who ever saw Mr. Banks smoke a cigarette in
6       his entire life other than the two ladies that
7       are here asking you for money?  Nobody.  Not his
8       best friend, not his acquaintance that he
9       borrowed money from, not his landlady who he
10       lived above for somewhere between three and five
11       years.  Nobody ever saw him smoke a cigarette.
12           Again, I'm not questioning he was a smoker,
13       that's not the point.  But was he a compulsive
14       chain-smoking nicotine addict?  If that's the
15       case, why did nobody else ever see him smoke?
16           How many neutral witnesses did the
17       plaintiffs bring you?  How many witnesses did
18       they bring to you who either they weren't paying
19       for their testimony or who weren't here seeking
20       money?  Zero.
21           The only body that brought you neutral
22       witnesses were the defendants.  And you know who
23       they are, Roosevelt Hall --
24           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Your Honor, I object.  May
25       I approach, please? THE COURT:  Yes, sir.
2           (The following discussion was held at
3 sidebar:)
4           THE COURT:  What is it now?
5           MR. SCHLESINGER:  You can't say you're
6       paying for testimony, Judge.
7           THE COURT:  Sustain the objection.
8           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Can I get a curative?
9           (Sidebar discussion was concluded, and the
10 following proceedings were held in open court:)
11           THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, the
12       testimony about paying for testimony is
13       sustained.  You're to disregard the remark.
14           Go ahead, Mr. Furr.
15           MR. FURR:  And I apologize.  I said that the
16       wrong way.  Witnesses who are being compensated
17       for their time testifying.  Didn't mean to
18       disparage them in any way, just a shorthand to
19       things.
20           But I don't want to lose this point.  The
21       only body who brought you any witness who didn't
22       have some skin in this game were the defendants.
23       So as we go through and we're trying to
24       reconcile competing views of what the facts
25       were, one of the sources you can always turn to are neutral witnesses who don't have a stake in
2       how this case comes out.
3           On page 3 of your instructions there's a
4       believability of witnesses instructions and
5       you'll see that one of the things you can
6       evaluate is whether the witness had an interest
7       in the case, because of course an interest in
8       the case may influence the way you testify.
9       That's in your instructions.
10           The evidence demonstrates a very telling
11       moment in the case was Dr. DiFranza's testimony.
12       You might remember Dr. DiFranza has testified he
13       told you first time he testified against the
14       tobacco companies were 25 years ago.  He's been
15       doing this for a long time.
16           And what did he tell you about this case?
17       He was asked "And you have never had another
18       case where you had less information about the
19       smoker from the period of his birth until age
20       60, right?
21           "Right."
22           There's just a complete failure of proof
23       because the plaintiffs don't have the facts they
24       need to prove their claims to you.
25           Let's organize ourselves around the legal issues so that as we look at the evidence we can
2       work through how that evidence applies to the
3       case, because there are three fundamental sets
4       of issues.  I told you you've got 18 verdict
5       questions.  It sounds awful.
6           But you can group those verdict questions
7       around three fundamental issues; the first is
8       whether he was a class member.  They failed to
9       prove that to you.
10           The second is whether Mr. Banks died because
11       he didn't know that smoking was dangerous after
12       May 5th, 1982 because of something the
13       defendants did.  That question actually appears
14       about three times on your verdict form.  We'll
15       look at that.
16           Finally, this issue that Mr. Schlesinger
17       raised with you this morning, and that's whether
18       Yvonne and Katrina are entitled to money damages
19       for the loss of Mr. Banks, and that primarily
20       deals with really what the nature of the family
21       relationship was.  We talked to you about that
22       in voir dire.  You've heard evidence.  And
23       Mr. Schlesinger acknowledged that that's
24       important for you to consider.  So we're going
25       to work our way through that and remind ourselves of what those facts were.
2           Class membership.  First, plaintiffs have
3       the burden of proof of class membership, first
4       thing to understand.  There are basically three
5       components of class membership.  First, the
6       plaintiffs have to prove to you, and I'll deal
7       with esophageal cancer and emphysema separately,
8       although they're basically the same except for
9       the first element.
10           The plaintiffs have to prove to you that
11       Mr. Banks died from esophageal cancer caused by
12       smoking, that's number one.
13           Second, they have to prove to you that
14       Mr. Banks was addicted to nicotine.
15           And finally, and this is a separate piece of
16       proof they have to offer to you, that addiction
17       to nicotine was a legal cause of George Banks'
18       death.
19           The important thing to understand here is
20       these are like three boxes that they have to
21       check off.  If they miss any one of them he's
22       not a member of the class.  So they've got three
23       different burdens they have to carry even to
24       establish that he was a class member.  And we're
25       looking at each of these three separately to parse them out so you can evaluate what the
2       evidence actually was.
3           And we'll start at the beginning with
4       esophageal cancer.
5           First part of class membership, on the
6       esophageal cancer claim, they have to prove that
7       he died from esophageal cancer caused by
8       smoking.
9           Well, what was the evidence?  Dr. DiFranza,
10       first medical witness in the case, told you that
11       Mr. Banks had at least four risk factors that
12       could have been related to his esophageal
13       cancer.  He told you that gender and age are
14       important risk factors.  If you're a male and
15       you're over 50 years old your chance goes up,
16       that's life, that's how things are.  He also
17       told you that alcohol and cigarettes are the
18       largest risk factors for esophageal cancer.
19           Dr. Traube, the other medical witness,
20       agreed with that.
21           Alcohol.  Let's talk about what was said
22       about alcohol, because it's actually the key to
23       understanding the case.  It's the key to
24       understanding both medical causation and
25       addiction causation, because really this case is in fact more about alcohol than it is about
2       tobacco when you understand the facts of the
3       case.
4           Dr. Proctor, Dr. Traube, both witnesses
5       called by the plaintiff.  On cross-examination
6       here's what they both told you, that alcohol is
7       a major cause of esophageal cancer and the more
8       you drink and the longer you drink the greater
9       your risk is.
10           Then we asked Dr. Proctor this question, I
11       asked him, "Would you agree that about 70
12       percent of the esophageal cancer cases are
13       attributable to alcohol consumption?
14           He said, "Ballpark, I agree with that."
15       Ballpark, I agree with that.
16           Think about what that means.  75 percent?
17       That means 3 out of 4.  So if you have four
18       cases of esophageal cancer before you and
19       nothing more, Dr. Proctor has conceded that 3
20       out of those 4 cases would be attributable to
21       alcohol consumption.
22           Smoking cigarettes can cause esophageal
23       cancer also.  Nobody disputes that.  But there's
24       a very important concept to understand, and it's
25       pretty common sense.  Why do doctors tell people that they should quit smoking?  Because when you
2       quit smoking, your risk of developing a disease
3       goes down.  And the longer you quit, the longer
4       it's been since you quit the lower your risk is.
5           So in evaluating whether smoking was a cause
6       of the esophageal cancer it's important to
7       understand how long after he quit smoking that
8       that esophogeal cancer developed and what does
9       the science tell us about what his risk from his
10       cigarette smoking would have been by the time
11       his esophageal cancer developed.
12           And Dr. DiFranza told you what that evidence
13       is.  He said based on the Surgeon General that
14       within five years of quitting, five years, your
15       chance of cancer of the throat, mouth and
16       esophagus is cut in half, is cut in half.
17           Another way of saying it's cut in half,
18       another way of saying it is is that in five
19       years after you quit it is more likely than not
20       that you will not develop cancer from that
21       exposure, because it's a 50 percent level, more
22       likely than not you will not develop.
23           So we need to look at Mr. Banks' smoking
24       when he quit and when the cancer developed.
25       Because after five years, after he quit smoking, Dr. DiFranza told us that his risk would have
2       been cut in half from smoking.
3           What do we know?  We know from the medical
4       records, they're very clear, that he quit two
5       years prior to the 1990 admission.  You all
6       remember when he fell down, hurt his hand, went
7       in, gave a history multiple times.  Both the
8       admitting nurse and the anesthesia nurse --
9       anesthesia doctor who did a probing interview
10       because they're getting ready to administer the
11       man anesthesia, they need to know what's going
12       on with him so they know what drugs to give him
13       and how much to give him, both of them had found
14       out he had quit in 1988.
15           Yvonne and Katrina came in here and told you
16       he never quit.  They came in and told you he
17       never quit.  But their experts didn't agree with
18       them.  Their experts, who read the depositions,
19       and our expert, who read the depositions, looked
20       at the medical records, considered all the
21       evidence in the case, all three experts who
22       testified on this issue rejected that testimony.
23           Dr. DiFranza, Dr. Traube, the plaintiff's
24       experts, both told you that they believe based
25       on the totality of evidence in this case that Mr. Banks quit in 1988.  And Dr. Hoge told you
2       the same thing.
3           And, frankly, the truth is Ms. Banks told
4       you the same thing if you look at her deposition
5       testimony and not her trial testimony.  You
6       know, in trial Ms. Banks told you that he only
7       quit when they put him in a casket.  But you
8       might remember during cross-examination she
9       acknowledged that in 1988 -- excuse me, she
10       acknowledged in her deposition, she said that
11       she didn't know whether he smoked after 1988.
12           So really when you go back to when her
13       memory was better, she didn't know either.
14       There's just no credible evidence that he smoked
15       after 1988.
16           He quit not five years but eight years
17       before he developed esophageal cancer.  In 1996
18       he had been quit since 1988.  So as the
19       witnesses explained to you, the longer you quit
20       the lower your risk was.  His risk would have
21       been decreased by more than 50 percent from the
22       smoking by the time he developed esophageal
23       cancer.  So what causes esophageal cancer?  What
24       did he continue to do during those intervening
25       eight years that we all know is a major risk factor and causes 75 percent of the esophageal
2       cancer?  You heard this morning Mr. Schlesinger
3       told you that Mr. Banks was a problem drinker
4       and they acknowledged that.  So did all the
5       experts.  The experts said he was a problem
6       drinker.  Mr. Schlesinger said he was a problem
7       drinker.  All of the medical records that you're
8       going to have and be able to look through them
9       all you want say that he was a problem drinker,
10       that he was a heavy user of alcohol, that he had
11       substance abuse and alcohol abuse.  And by the
12       way, the substance abuse is ETOH, it's not any
13       other substance.  But the medical records say he
14       was a heavy drinker.
15           And remember who wrote these.  These are the
16       folks who were taking care of him, who asked him
17       about his smoking -- excuse me, about his
18       drinking and who used their professional
19       judgment to determine what significance that was
20       for him.  His own doctors thought he was a
21       problem drinker.
22           The neutral witnesses told us that he had
23       been drinking for a long time.  Remember
24       Diedrich Lampe, his best friend, Ms. Banks told
25       you, his best friend, knew him since the '40s all the way through the '80s, even kept checking
2       on him as he got older, because he was fond of
3       him, told you that even back in the '40s when
4       was working for Diedrich and his father and both
5       at work at Jacksonville Liquors and in their
6       home that sometimes Mr. Banks drank more than he
7       should and he wouldn't make it to work.
8           By the way, I'm not doing a character
9       assassination, as was suggested this morning.
10       We're just talking about the evidence as it
11       relates to the issues you have to decide,
12       medical causation and addiction causation.
13           Roosevelt Hall, Mr. Banks' acquaintance,
14       told you that he saw him about 150 times between
15       1965 and 1977 and Mr. Hall told you that he
16       observed -- would tease Mr. Banks about being
17       under the weather and that most of the time he
18       saw him, most of the time he saw him Mr. Banks
19       had been drinking.
20           And then Helen Hall Norman, his landlady,
21       the dates were a little confusing, but the best
22       way to piece them all together, because it looks
23       like she was his landlady from 1980 to 1985.  So
24       she was his landlady both when Katrina and
25       Yvonne were still living in Jacksonville and after they moved to Miami.  What did Ms. Hall
2       tell us?  That she saw Mr. Banks intoxicated,
3       that he would drink with his roommate Melvin
4       Austin and that when she saw him coming and
5       going, remember, she lived right below him in
6       the same building, and she said she could see
7       him coming and going as he approached the
8       building, when she'd see him coming and going
9       that he looked like he had been drinking.
10           Then we had another episode where -- you
11       know, the fact of the matter is Yvonne also told
12       you that he was a frequent drinker.  Let's look
13       at what happened during this trial.  During this
14       trial in front of you Yvonne testified that I
15       never saw him drink.  I never saw him drinking.
16           But as Dr. Traube explained to you, the
17       plaintiff's expert explained to you that the
18       February 1996 medical record says that Mr. Banks
19       drank beer, liquor and wine very frequently, and
20       it says, wife gave info.  Wife gave info.
21       That's what Dr. Traube told you.  So that was --
22       I'm not picking on Ms. Banks in any way.  That
23       was 18 years ago, 18 years ago.
24           But we have a medical record from 18 years
25       ago where Mrs. Banks told the health care providers that he was a very frequent drinker.
2           I want to talk about what Dr. Traube told
3       you.  Because you might remember Dr. Traube, the
4       doctor who came down here from New York.  What
5       you might remember was that Dr. Traube was also
6       a lawyer, that he wasn't a practicing lawyer,
7       but he'd been through law school.
8           Well, you saw him testify and you get to
9       evaluate his demeanor and how he handled
10       cross-examination, because you saw, basically
11       Dr. Traube knew all the tricks.
12           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor.
13           THE COURT:  Sustained.  Not proper argument.
14       Sustained.
15           MR. FURR:  Dr. Traube would not admit that
16       anything was authoritative.  He would not admit
17       that any source was authoritative and thus he
18       avoided being cross-examined.  But what
19       happened?  Frankly, in the end he broke, in the
20       end he broke.  And let's look at his series of
21       admissions that he made that taken together
22       completely demonstrate that it was the alcohol
23       that was the only legal cause of Mr. Banks'
24       esophageal cancer.
25           The first thing he told us on cross-examination was that "Mr. Banks' alcohol
2       use enormously," his word, "enormously increased
3       his risk of developing esophageal cancer."
4           Then he broke a little more and he candidly
5       admitted that the alcohol consumption was a
6       cause, a cause of Mr. Banks' esophageal cancer.
7           That's the plaintiff's medical doctor that
8       they brought to you.
9           He also told you that had Mr. Banks quit
10       drinking when he quit smoking he would have
11       decreased his risk of esophageal cancer by 50
12       percent, 50 percent.  But then he went further,
13       he went further.  The final, the final admission
14       that Dr. Traube made is that if Mr. Banks had
15       stopped drinking when he stopped smoking he
16       could have avoided esophageal cancer, he could
17       have avoided esophageal cancer.
18           Now, you'll see when you read your
19       instructions, page 4 of your instructions
20       there's a lengthy instruction about causation.
21       And here's the part I want to focus on.  This is
22       class membership instruction.  In the third
23       paragraph down you'll see that -- this language,
24       "but for the addiction to cigarettes containing
25       nicotine, such as emphysema, esophageal cancer, the death would not have occurred. [sic]
2           Little abstract, but the point is it's
3       but/for causation, but/for causation.
4           And by this admission Dr. Traube has
5       admitted there's no but/for causation for
6       nicotine addiction, that it was his drinking
7       that was the cause of his esophageal cancer.
8           The other theory that you heard during the
9       case, and I want to talk about all the theories
10       you heard.  You heard, well, maybe it was some
11       synergistic reaction between smoking and
12       drinking.
13           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Your Honor, can I
14       approach, please?
15           THE COURT:  Yes, sir.
16           (The following discussion was held at
17 sidebar:)
18           MR. SCHLESINGER:  With all due respect, you
19       can't put up testimony without giving a page and
20       line.  We're in the middle of a trial with the
21       trial transcript.
22           THE COURT:  It's overruled, sir.  The jury
23       can remember it, disregard it, whatever they
24       want to do.  Overruled.
25           (Sidebar discussion was concluded, and the
United Reporting, Inc.
954-525-2221
0dbf17df-fc10-4733-840d-3f3c4a4ca47d
1 following proceedings were held in open court:)
2           MR. FURR:  Final theory you heard about
3       causation was that, well, maybe it's synergy,
4       maybe it's alcohol and tobacco acting together.
5       Well, in order to act together they both have to
6       be present at the same time.
7           You know, you've heard he quit smoking in
8       1988, developed his disease in 1996.  So for the
9       last eight years there could not have been any
10       type of synergy because he wasn't smoking any
11       longer.  But he continued to drink, and it
12       actually looks like his drinking accelerated.
13       And the evidence demonstrates that the only
14       cause of his esophageal cancer was his
15       problematic abuse of alcohol consumption.
16           Now, let's think about what the evidence was
17       even further.  The treatment records, the
18       medical records do not say that smoking caused
19       his cancer.  The autopsy doesn't say that
20       smoking caused his cancer.  The death
21       certificate doesn't say that smoking caused his
22       cancer.  In the process of providing care none
23       of the records say that smoking caused his
24       cancer.  The only record that says anything
25       about smoking caused his cancer was this record that was created at Mrs. Banks' request two
2       months after his death.  And if you look at this
3       letter you will see that Mrs. Banks requested a
4       doctor to send her a letter that smoking caused
5       his cancer and you'll have to decide why this
6       letter was requested.
7           Let's talk about the emphysema.  You know,
8       this is the easiest issue in the case by far,
9       because the emphysema was a complete nonissue in
10       this case.  Dr. DiFranza told you that he was of
11       the opinion that Mr. Banks might not have even
12       noticed that he had emphysema.
13           Dr. Traube told you that Mr. Banks didn't
14       complain of symptoms, that none of the treaters
15       that took care of him saw his symptoms, that it
16       didn't affect him in any substantial way.
17           Could I have the Elmo, please.
18           Thank you, Baron.
19           Your first two questions are class
20       membership.  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to
21       suggest to you that even before we get to
22       addiction and addiction causation that the
23       plaintiff's proof has failed on both of those.
24       And if you agree, no, your foreman goes to the
25       back of this verdict form, signs it and we all go home.
2           Back to the monitor, please, Baron.  Thank
3       you.
4           But that's not all the plaintiffs have to do
5       to prove he's a class member.  They have to
6       prove that Mr. Banks was addicted to nicotine,
7       that Mr. Banks was addicted to nicotine.  So
8       let's look at what the evidence was on that
9       issue.  Because really the only thing that was
10       proven to you is that Mr. Banks was a smoker,
11       that for some period of time he was being
12       observed smoking a pack a day.  The question for
13       you is, is that enough for the plaintiffs to
14       satisfy their burden?
15           Their own witnesses told you it's not.  They
16       told you that not all smokers are addicted and
17       that the latest, greatest best -- did I hit
18       something, Cliff?
19           -- the latest, greatest best available
20       information is that about 50 percent of regular
21       smokers are not addicted.
22           You were told that people smoke for other
23       reasons.  I mean, it was belittled this morning
24       but both of these witnesses, Dr. DiFranza and
25       Dr. Hoge, told you that people smoke for enjoyment, pleasure, relaxation, concentration
2       enhancement.  It's a habit for some people.
3       It's a habit for some people.
4           So let's look closer to see whether
5       Mr. Banks fits in the 50 percent category of
6       addicted smokers or whether he fits in the other
7       category of nonaddicted smokers.  Again, let's
8       look at what the neutral fact witnesses told us.
9       Mr. Lampe, his best friend, never saw him smoke
10       a cigarette in over 40 years.  They worked
11       together.  Mr. Lampe visited him, checked on
12       him.  They worked side by side, shoulder to
13       shoulder, riding in the same truck together
14       moving that equipment for a couple months at a
15       time in the 1940s.  He never saw him smoke a
16       cigarette.  He never smelled smoke on Mr. Banks
17       or in his apartment.  He never saw him bum a
18       cigarette.
19           Mr. Hall saw him 150 times when he would
20       come see Mr. Hall.  Never saw him with a
21       cigarette, never saw him smoke a cigarette,
22       never smelled cigarettes on him.
23           Ms. North, his landlady, of all the times,
24       she told you she saw him every three or four
25       days, that he'd be coming and going, going up and down the steps.  She'd see him every month
2       when he would come down to pay his rent, never
3       saw him smoke.  If he is an addicted smoker
4       smoking compulsively, as a nicotine addict, how
5       could it be that every neutral witness in the
6       case never saw him smoke?  How can that be?
7           Both experts in the case, Dr. DiFranza and
8       Dr. Hoge, admitted to you that Mr. Banks could
9       control his smoking.  They both told you he
10       wasn't a chain smoker, that he did things like
11       he always went outside to smoke, he wouldn't
12       smoke around Katrina, he wouldn't smoke in
13       church or meals, places that he was supposed to
14       not smoke he was able to control himself.  He
15       was not somebody who was controlled by nicotine.
16       He controlled his smoking.
17           Let's go to the medical records.  No doctor
18       who ever treated Mr. Banks while he was alive
19       diagnosed him with addiction to cigarettes or
20       nicotine.  There's no medical record that says
21       that Mr. Banks was addicted to cigarettes with
22       nicotine or abusing tobacco.  He was never
23       diagnosed as addicted to cigarettes before this
24       lawsuit.  Eighteen years after his death is the
25       first time that anybody had ever diagnosed him as abusing -- or excuse me, as a nicotine
2       addict, which you know that his treaters were
3       sensitive to issues of dependence and abuse and
4       addiction because they documented in the medical
5       records that he was abusing alcohol.  So it's
6       not like they missed this issue.  They knew the
7       significance of evaluating addiction issues for
8       their patients as they treated him.  They
9       identified that he was an alcohol addict or
10       abusing alcohol, but there's not a single
11       notation that he had any problems with nicotine.
12           Finally we brought you Dr. Hoge.  You know,
13       this is a case where the plaintiffs are asking
14       for significant amounts of money.  It's your
15       decision as to what being addicted to nicotine
16       means.  My suggestion to you is that at a
17       minimum it should mean that a smoker meets
18       medical diagnostic criteria that are used by
19       health care providers to diagnose whether
20       someone is addicted to nicotine.
21           And Dr. Hoge just yesterday walked through
22       his careful, elaborate analysis of whether
23       Mr. Banks met the medical diagnostic criteria
24       embodied in the DSM-5, the text that
25       psychiatrists use and psychologists use to diagnose people.
2           He told you the first problem is the
3       threshold requirement.  Mr. Banks had no
4       significant clinical impairment.  There just was
5       no evidence that smoking was interfering with
6       Mr. Banks' life.  You can imagine a smoker who
7       hated it, who tried everything they could do to
8       quit, who was tormented by their smoking,
9       tortured by it, who talked about it, who thought
10       about it, who was obsessed with it, who was
11       driven crazy by their inability to quit.  That's
12       not Mr. Banks.  There was none of that evidence
13       for Mr. Banks.
14           Dr. Hoge told you, as we just discussed, he
15       controlled his smoking and there's no evidence
16       whatsoever of compulsive smoking.  No evidence
17       of compulsive smoking.
18           So I suggest to you, ladies and gentlemen,
19       that on the second prong of class membership,
20       whether Mr. Banks was addicted, that's another
21       independent reason -- can I have the Elmo,
22       please, Baron -- another independent reason of
23       why Mr. Banks is not a member of the Engle
24       class.
25           Now, remember there only has to be one X on the no side for any of these three things the
2       plaintiffs have to prove.  They didn't prove any
3       of them, so they failed three different times.
4           Thank you, Baron.  If I could go back to the
5       projector.
6           Third, the plaintiffs have to prove that
7       addiction to nicotine was a legal cause of
8       Mr. Banks' death.  It's kind of a strange
9       concept.  How could addiction to nicotine be a
10       legal cause?  Submit to you there's only one way
11       that addiction could be a legal cause of
12       somebody's disease and death, and that's if the
13       addiction prevented that person from being able
14       to quit in time to avoid their disease, if the
15       addiction was so strong that it compelled
16       somebody to continue using the substance and it
17       rendered them unable to quit and ultimately
18       caused their disease.
19           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Judge, I object.  Violates
20       preclusive findings, not the law, not the
21       instructions.
22           THE COURT:  Again, ladies and gentlemen, all
23       of this is set out in the instructions and
24       you'll follow the instructions as I've given
25       them to you in those instructions. You may continue, sir.
2           MR. FURR:  So I'm suggesting to you that the
3       question you can ask yourself is, was he
4       rendered unable to quit and avoid his disease?
5       Well, you know that's just not the case.
6           Let's remind ourselves generally about how
7       smokers quit then we'll look at Mr. Banks.  And
8       I'm going to use only the Surgeon General's
9       quitting statistics, not somebody   else's, not
10       the tobacco companies', but the Surgeon
11       General's quitting statistics.
12           Dr. Proctor told you about all of this.  By
13       1965 17.6 million Americans had quit, before the
14       first warning went on the pack, they quit
15       because of the information about the dangers of
16       smoking, Dr. Proctor told you.
17           In the 15 years between '64 when we had the
18       Surgeon General's Report and '79, 30 million
19       more quit, 2 million a year on average, about 5
20       or 6,000 people a day.
21           And today we know that about 60 million
22       people have quit, a much larger number than
23       number of people who currently smoke.
24           Well, okay, were these quitters light
25       smokers?  Were they nonaddicted smokers?  Next logical question.  It's a fair question.  Here's
2       the evidence.  Dr. DiFranza and Dr. Cummings,
3       who you may not remember, he was a video that
4       you saw early on, and Dr. Hoge all told you the
5       same thing; of the 60 million Americans who
6       quit, 90 percent of them they thought would have
7       been addicted.  Dr. Hoge told you the new
8       statistics are 50 percent, but Dr. DiFranza said
9       90 percent would have been addicted, 90 to 95
10       percent quit cold turkey.  Being addicted does
11       not compel you to smoke yourself to death.  It
12       just doesn't.  Dr. Hoge told you an addiction
13       diagnosis is not a person.  There's more to a
14       person than a diagnosis.  There's that person's
15       decision-making, their willpower, the choices
16       that they make.
17           Dr. Proctor told you that in fact heavy
18       smokers quit.  From the '70s on Dr. Proctor told
19       you that the average smoker who quit smoked more
20       than a pack a day, more than a pack a day, so
21       it's the heavy smokers who can quit.
22           One of the ways you can evaluate this,
23       because, you know, during the trial it was
24       depicted to you that smoking is a horrific thing
25       to try to quit and it's torture for people, and I'm not disputing that it can be hard for some
2       people, but let's look at what the plaintiff's
3       experts say outside the courtroom, outside the
4       courtroom.
5           Dr. Cummings.  "And when smokers come to
6       your stop-smoking clinic, you tell them that the
7       success rate for quitting among people who
8       really want to quit and stick to it is a hundred
9       percent, right?"
10           "Answer:  Yes, I do say that in my
11       literature."
12           Dr. Cummings wrote a stop-smoking guide for
13       the American Cancer Society.  "Do you have what
14       it takes to stop smoking?  There's no magic cure
15       that can help you stop smoking.  Take this short
16       quiz.  Find out if you have what it takes.  Do
17       you want to stop smoking?  Are you motivated?
18       Are you willing to make some changes in your
19       daily routine?  Are you willing to put up with
20       some uneasy moments after stopping?
21           "If you can answer yes to all three
22       questions you can stop smoking."
23           Again, what's said outside courtroom.
24           Dr. DiFranza outside the courtroom.  "And
25       you certainly would never tell one of your patients that they can't quit smoking?
2           "Answer:  I wouldn't."
3           So now let's turn to Mr. Banks and this
4       final component of class membership, this issue
5       of addiction causation.  Suggest to you that
6       here's the way to think about it.  Was Mr. Banks
7       compelled to smoke so that he was unable to quit
8       and prevent his death, or was he a problem
9       drinker who did not quit smoking before 1988
10       because he chose to drink and smoke daily?
11           It's an either/or.  It really can't be both.
12           Well, you've heard the plaintiffs have
13       admitted that "Mr. Banks' acts or omissions
14       relating to the frequency and duration of these
15       efforts to quit smoking were a legal cause of
16       his death."
17           Were a legal cause of death.
18           You'll see it that in the instructions.  You
19       heard it this morning when Mr. Schlesinger told
20       you we take responsibility.
21           Let's take a step back, because you're
22       allowed to draw inferences from the evidence.
23       You're allowed to consider, what does this
24       really mean?  And as you think through what this
25       admission really means, I'm going to suggest to you that it means this.  It means it's
2       implicitly an admission that Mr. Banks knew that
3       smoking was dangerous but continued to smoke.
4       Because why would someone ever admit on behalf
5       of their family member that they were a cause of
6       their own death if they didn't know?  If they
7       didn't know you wouldn't say they were a cause.
8           Second, it means that he had the ability to
9       quit smoking, the ability to quit smoking
10       earlier.  Because if he was hopelessly addicted
11       and unable to quit why would you ever admit that
12       he was a cause of his own death?
13           Finally, that admission implicitly means
14       that he had the ability to quit smoking at a
15       time that would have prevented his death.
16       Because the admission is that he was a cause of
17       his own death.  That admission would never be
18       made if they didn't believe that he could have
19       quit in time to prevent his own death.
20           Important piece of information for you to
21       consider, not just the literal words, but the
22       inferences, what actually underlies that
23       admission, so you can think through what does
24       that mean for the issue you have to decide in
25       this case? Well, let's zero in on Mr. Banks, because
2       that's where we should be.  Could he quit?  Of
3       course he could.  We know because he did quit.
4       We know because he did quit.  We know with 100
5       percent certainty that he could quit.  He quit
6       in 1988.
7           Dr. Hoge explained to you that being
8       addicted to nicotine does not mean -- simply
9       does not mean that a person loses the ability to
10       control their smoking.  And he told you that
11       based upon all the evidence nicotine addiction
12       was not a cause of Mr. Banks' esophageal cancer.
13       If it wasn't nicotine addiction, what was going
14       on?  You know the answer to that question.
15       Alcohol causes a loss of control.  Dr. DiFranza,
16       Dr. Traube, Dr. Hoge all told you that alcohol
17       use lowers inhibitions -- everybody knows
18       that -- reduces willpower and makes it more
19       difficult to quit smoking.  That's why he didn't
20       quit before 1988.  Although clearly when he was
21       drinking, he demonstrated he still had the
22       ability to quit.  60 million smokers quit.
23           Why didn't Mr. Banks quit earlier?  Why
24       didn't he quit smoking earlier?  Were the
25       cigarettes he was smoking more addictive than other cigarettes?  No evidence of that
2       whatsoever.
3           Was his brain affected differently than
4       smokers who quit?  No evidence of that.
5           Was he exposed to advertising different than
6       the smokers who quit?  No evidence of that.
7           Was he exposed to tobacco company statements
8       different than other smokers?  No evidence.
9           Did he smoke more or longer than smokers who
10       quit?  No.  You just saw that the average
11       quitter smoked a pack a day.
12           What was the difference between him and
13       other people who quit sooner -- because he did
14       quit, but who quit sooner?  Because he was a
15       problem drinker.  His problem drinking was a
16       barrier to him quitting smoking.
17           THE COURT:  One hour, sir.
18           MR. FURR:  Thank you very much, Your Honor.
19           Why didn't he quit?  He didn't do the types
20       of things that people need to do -- that people
21       do when they want to quit.  He didn't -- you
22       know, you were told that motivation and
23       persistence is the key to quitting, you have to
24       want to quit, you have to try to quit.  That's
25       how people accomplish most things in life, including quitting smoking.  You were told he
2       didn't do any of the things that people do.  He
3       didn't ask for help.  He didn't go to the
4       doctor.  He didn't even throw away his
5       cigarettes.  He didn't go to any clinic.  He
6       didn't go a single day without smoking.  There's
7       simply no evidence that he was motivated to
8       quitting smoking and persistent in his efforts
9       to quit smoking.
10           If this were a case where the smoker had
11       tried to quit 30, 40 times and went through just
12       an awful time every time you'd have a different
13       case before you, but that's just not what you
14       have, and Mrs. Banks told us that.
15           Here's what she was asked:  "Ma'am, this
16       first time he tried to quit smoking he actually
17       stopped smoking for less than an hour; is that
18       correct?
19           "Answer, yes.
20           "Question:  Okay, ma'am.  When you were
21       living in Miami from 1983 to 1992, you don't
22       have any knowledge about Mr. Banks trying to
23       quit smoking, do you?
24           "Answer:  Didn't I just tell you that he
25       tried to quit smoking once? "Yes, ma'am, you did.
2           "Well then, you got the answer."
3           Mrs. Banks, one time for one hour in a
4       50-year period of smoking and the claim is that
5       his smoking -- nicotine compelled him to smoke
6       and left him unable to quit in time to avoid the
7       disease?  It doesn't make any sense.  One hour
8       in 50 years?
9           I'm going to suggest to you that the third
10       prong of class membership the plaintiffs also
11       failed to prove to you, and that's this idea of
12       addiction causation.  There's no evidence that
13       he had an inability to quit smoking in time to
14       prevent his death, if the smoking was even a
15       cause of his disease.
16           Could I have the Elmo.  Thank you.
17           So, ladies and gentlemen, there's actually
18       three reasons why class membership fails in this
19       case, three independent reasons.  There only has
20       to be one for esophageal cancer and emphysema,
21       but there are three on each of them.  And if
22       that's what you find based on your evidence and
23       analysis then you go to the last page, sign and
24       date your verdict form and we all go home.
25           But of course I'm obligated to discuss all the other issues in the case with you so that's
2       what I'm going to do.
3           I want to go through this concealment issue,
4       this issue of whether Mr. Banks died because he
5       didn't know that smoking was dangerous.  You're
6       actually going to see that it disappears in
7       verdict form questions 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13
8       and 14.
9           Like I said, we can group these questions
10       together.  It's the same analysis for all of
11       them.  You have concealment questions related to
12       both esophageal cancer and emphysema.  You have
13       concealment questions related to both
14       concealment and agreement to conceal.  There
15       ended up being eight different concealment
16       questions.  They all really boil down to the
17       same thing, and that's whether the plaintiffs
18       have proven to you, have they proven to you that
19       Mr. Banks died because he didn't know that
20       smoking was dangerous because that information
21       was concealed from him by the tobacco companies.
22           And there's a very important instruction for
23       you to look at in that regard.
24           On page 11 of your instructions in the third
25       paragraph you'll see the last sentence of the third paragraph on page 11 says this, "However,
2       George Banks cannot be found to have reasonably
3       relied upon his statement if he knew it was
4       false or its falsity was obvious to him or that
5       the fact allegedly concealed was already known
6       to him."  Already known to him.
7           What's all that mean?  It means you can't
8       conceal something from somebody who already
9       knows it.  Pretty common sense.  If you already
10       know something no one can conceal it from you,
11       it's already information that you have.
12           So we need to look quickly at what was known
13       about the dangers of smoking in general and what
14       Mr. Banks knew to determine whether, in fact,
15       his failure to understand that smoking can be
16       dangerous was a legal cause of his death.
17           The question becomes:  Was the dangers of
18       smoking a secret?  If it was a secret and people
19       didn't know about it that would be an important
20       thing to know.  You know that's not true.  I'm
21       going to have to go a little faster than I would
22       like to through this, but you know that TV,
23       radio, newspaper, magazines, public health
24       authorities, doctors, churches, schools all were
25       important sources of information about the dangers of smoking beginning back in the 1800s.
2           And Dr. Proctor told you just that.  I won't
3       go through this busy slide but he told you that
4       beginning in the 1800s it was widely discussed
5       that smoking is bad for you, contains nicotine,
6       that school textbooks from the 1800s warned
7       people that smoking could shorten their life and
8       addiction was being discussed.
9           Florida Health Notes 1906, though eight
10       years before Mr. Banks is born, "Today the
11       cigarette is looked upon by all smokers as the
12       very worst form of tobacco addiction.  It is
13       generally inhaled."  Generally inhaled.
14           And I hadn't planned on doing this, but I
15       think there's an issue I need to address.
16           Can we have the Elmo again, please?
17           This morning Mr. Schlesinger told me that I
18       hurt his ego during opening statement.  I didn't
19       mean to do that.  He also suggested to you that
20       I misled you.  Surely didn't mean to do that and
21       I didn't do that.
22           Please write this exhibit number down, AWS
23       000054, 54.
24           I told you that the Surgeon General of the
25       United States had written a document in 1915 that said that cigarette smoking can be
2       addictive.  Here it is.
3           First, this is from the United States Public
4       Health Service, the branch of the government
5       that publish Surgeon General's Reports.
6           The health of garment workers by a doctor
7       who is the surgeon from the U.S. Public Health
8       Service, prepared by direction of the Surgeon
9       General.  In 1915.
10           If you turn to page 28 of this document, you
11       will see this sentence, "It seems that cigarette
12       smoking is by far the most popular form of
13       tobacco addiction among male garment workers."
14           And as if that weren't enough, we
15       cross-examined Dr. Proctor on this very subject.
16       He was asked, "Sir, you were asked the question
17       and gave the answer:  '1915 the Surgeon General
18       of the United States took the position that
19       smoking is addictive, right?
20           "And your answer was 'yes.'  Correct?
21           "Yes."
22           Complete sideshow, has nothing to do with
23       any important issue in this case, but I just
24       wanted to make sure the record was clear about
25       whether anything has been misrepresented to you all by me during my opening statement.
2           Could I go back to the projector, please.
3           Okay.  I got a little click happy.  Don't
4       have much time to go through all these general
5       things.  You've heard all this.  It was in
6       textbooks in the 1920s.  Dr. Proctor told you
7       that beginning in the 1950s people began
8       quitting in large numbers.  Why?  Because the
9       major reason was the fear created about smoking
10       and their health, right?
11           Mr. Banks would have been about 40 years old
12       in 1954, 40 years old.
13           Public health authorities of the day, 1957,
14       Mr. Banks is 43 years old, the Surgeon General,
15       Dr. Heller both testified in Congress that just
16       like we've been discussing, the public had been
17       informed through radio, television, TV,
18       newspaper, the public was being told what was
19       going on, people got to make choices, the
20       information was out there, they heard they made
21       their own choices.
22           In 1964 the Surgeon General's Report came
23       out.  Front page news.  This is the newspaper
24       that Mr. Banks read.  "Cigarette smoking held
25       grave hazard to health in the U.S.  Heavy cigarette smoking is the principal cause of
2       cancer of the lungs and the larynx and the
3       health hazard so grave as to call for remedial
4       action."
5           The information was everywhere, radio, TV,
6       newspapers, magazine covers.  You saw all that.
7           You saw the press conference.  The message
8       was everywhere.
9           Florida Public Health Organization the very
10       next year said, "Nearly all Floridians have
11       heard about this."
12           And soon after that the warning label went
13       on.
14           1966 the first warning label went on the
15       packages of cigarettes.
16           Dr. Daniel Horne, the public health
17       authority responsible for distributing
18       information about the dangers of smoking in the
19       1960s said this, and I'm going to read it
20       because it just speaks volumes.  "You could
21       stand on the rooftop and shout 'smoking is
22       dangerous at the top of your lungs' and you
23       would not be telling anyone anything they did
24       not already know."
25           How could Mr. Banks miss the message? Take a step back from this, ask yourself,
2       search your minds, there has not been one single
3       piece of evidence, not one piece of testimony,
4       not one document, nothing, no one has ever said
5       that Mr. Banks didn't know that smoking was
6       dangerous.  That's the claim before you, that he
7       died because he didn't know it.
8           Who said he didn't know?  Yvonne didn't say
9       that.  Katrina didn't say that.  It's not in the
10       medical records.  There's a complete absence of
11       proof.  Not one witness ever uttered a syllable
12       to the effect that Mr. Banks didn't know that
13       smoking was dangerous.
14           Instead what were we told?
15           Yvonne told you that he might have had
16       limited education but he kept up with current
17       events, he watched the news, he read the
18       newspapers.  And more importantly, Yvonne made
19       sure that he knew.  She made sure that he knew
20       that smoking was dangerous.  Here's what she
21       told us:  While living in Jacksonville before
22       1982, she told him about articles that she saw
23       about smoking in her magazines.  She told him
24       about things that she had seen on TV about
25       smoking, including anti-smoking commercials, including anti-smoking commercials.
2           I was going to show you one.  In the
3       interest of time I'm going to skip past it.
4           You remember the type of public health
5       service announcement being played.  You saw it
6       during Dr. Proctor's examination, things like
7       the American Cancer Society talked about
8       warnings and how quitting benefits your health.
9       The information was everywhere.  Yvonne saw it.
10       She told George about it.
11           And then maybe one of the most important
12       pieces of evidence in the case.  1970 this
13       warning label went on the package of cigarettes.
14       No dispute, also no dispute that it's accurate
15       as a matter of federal law.  "Warning:  The
16       Surgeon General has determined that cigarette
17       smoking is dangerous to your health."  Is
18       dangerous to your health.
19           A seminal piece of evidence in this case
20       because of what happened after this warning went
21       on packages.
22           First, did people about it in general know
23       [sic]?
24           Well, let's look at what Diedrich Lampe,
25       Mr. Banks' best friend, told you.  Mr. Lampe knew him from the '40s to the '80s.  Mr. Lampe
2       told me that he quit smoking when the dangers
3       came out and he said something, maybe it's a
4       little bit crude, maybe it's a little bit
5       insensitive, but this was Mr. Lampe's testimony
6       and this was a common guy speaking about what
7       was commonly known about the dangers of smoking
8       by virtue of that warning being on the pack.
9           Mr. Lampe told you, Warnings were printed
10       all over the pack.  It was obvious that smoking
11       is harmful to your health.  When he was asked
12       whether he knew smoking was harmful, he said,
13       I'm not a mental paraplegic.
14           Now, what did he mean by that?  Again, it's
15       a little insensitive and crude, but this was his
16       words.  He meant that it was obvious to anyone.
17       It's on the side of the package.  How could you
18       not know it?
19           And certainly Mr. Banks could not have known
20       it, because Mrs. Banks told you that when she
21       saw the warning label that the Surgeon General
22       had determined that cigarette smoking is
23       dangerous to your health, when she first saw it
24       she brought the label to the attention of
25       Mr. Banks.  She warned him to heed that warning. And what else did she tell you?  She told
2       you that he knew it wasn't good for him.  She
3       told you that she explained to him that smoking
4       wasn't healthy for him, that he would be
5       healthier for him if he quit.  Healthier for him
6       if he quit while she was in Jacksonville.
7           And then ultimately the single most powerful
8       piece of evidence in the whole case was this
9       testimony by Mrs. Banks.
10           "He knew it wasn't good for him."
11           "He knew it wasn't good for him."
12           All of the verdict form questions related to
13       concealment, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12 -- let me make
14       sure I got the numbers right.
15           Could I have the Elmo again.
16           Starting with 4, I won't read it all to you,
17       but 4, 5, 6, 7, and then again related to the
18       emphysema 11, 12, 13 and 14 all essentially ask
19       you the same question, whether he died because
20       he didn't know that smoking was dangerous to
21       him, especially, and this is critically
22       important, the issue is whether he knew after
23       1982, after 1982.  And you just saw, you just
24       saw that the warnings that he was provided all
25       occurred in the 1970s by Mrs. Banks, by Mrs. Banks.  Only one possible answer to those
2       questions related to concealment.
3           May I ask where I'm at on time, Your Honor?
4           THE COURT:  You have about 12 minutes.
5           MR. FURR:  12 minutes.  Would Mr. Heise be
6       able to give me some of his time?
7           (Laughter.)
8           MR. FURR:  Not that I'm pressuring you.
9           MR. HEISE:  Just putting me on the spot.
10           THE COURT:  I'll give you a little bit more
11       time and I'll give Mr. Schlesinger a little bit
12       more time on rebuttal to be fair to both sides.
13           MR. FURR:  Thank you.
14           Another question, don't know whether you get
15       here or not, obviously no class membership you
16       don't get here.
17           There is a question about allocation of
18       fault, allocation of fault.  A few important
19       things to understand.  You know, it was
20       suggested to you that at a minimum the tobacco
21       companies' fault should be more than Mr. Banks'.
22       I guess the argument was that the request to you
23       at least assign the tobacco companies 51 percent
24       and Mr. Banks only 49 percent.
25           Let's talk about what this allocation of fault really is, but this appears at questions 3
2       and 10, 3 and 10 of your verdict form.  Some
3       very important things to know.
4           Baron, could I go back to the projector.
5           This question of fault is not a -- questions
6       3 and 10 are not a generalized comparison of
7       conduct.  It's not a comparison of who was
8       better, Mr. Banks or the tobacco companies.
9       That's not the legal issue before you.  This
10       assignment of fault deals with a specific legal
11       concept, and that is, the assignment of fault
12       relates only to actions that were a legal cause
13       of George Banks' death, a legal cause of his
14       death.
15           And RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris can only
16       be assigned fault for actions -- excuse me,
17       cannot be assigned fault for actions that were
18       not a legal cause of his death.  So it's a very
19       narrow focused inquiry.  First thing to
20       understand, not a generalized comparison of
21       conduct, has to be conduct that was a cause of
22       the death.
23           Second point, it's sort of a natural human
24       inclination to say, okay, well, let's start at
25       50/50 and adjust from there.  That's not how it works, because the plaintiffs have the burden of
2       proof.  They've already admitted to you that
3       Mr. Banks was a cause of his own death.  Your
4       instructions will tell you you have to assign
5       fault to Mr. Banks if you get to this question.
6       But they have to prove fault by the tobacco
7       companies.  The tobacco companies start at zero.
8       They have to prove with evidence every single
9       percentage point of fault that you're going to
10       assign the tobacco companies if you assign them
11       any at all.  That's the plaintiff's burden of
12       proof.
13           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Judge, I object.  There's
14       no burden of proof on fault.  The Engle findings
15       preclude that.  That is an incorrect statement
16       of law.
17           THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, the law is
18       set forth in these instructions, and if the law
19       differs from what the lawyers argue you'll
20       follow the instructions as set forth by me.
21       Thank you.
22           You may proceed.
23           MR. FURR:  Thank you.
24           Please examine the instructions very
25       carefully.  Please examine them very carefully. They're your roadmap on how to decide this case.
2           Let's look at what the evidence shows us.
3           When you compare conduct that was a cause of
4       Mr. Banks' death, let's look at what the
5       evidence shows you about Mr. Banks' role.
6           THE COURT:  Can you show it to them, too,
7       please?
8           MR. FURR:  Sure.
9           There's already an admission that he is the
10       legal cause of his own death.  We know from
11       their own experts they've admitted that his --
12       by the way, that legal cause was due to his
13       failure to quit smoking sooner.  That's the
14       plaintiff's admission.
15           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Judge, I object.  Your
16       Honor, there's no such admission in the case.
17       Your Honor read the --
18           THE COURT:  All right, Mr. Schlesinger.
19       Ladies and gentlemen, you've been instructed on
20       what the law is in this case.  If the lawyers
21       arguments differ from the law, please follow the
22       law as set forth in these instructions.
23           You may proceed, sir.
24           MR. FURR:  You see that this admission is
25       based on his failure to quit smoking.  You also know that daily drinking caused his esophageal
2       cancer, that he knew that smoking was dangerous,
3       every pack of cigarettes that he smoked ever
4       from RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris carried that
5       warning, every pack.  Did he smoke other
6       company's packs before the warning?  We don't
7       know.  The only evidence is that every pack it
8       appears.
9           What did the defendants do?  What evidence
10       did they offer you to connect Mr. Banks' death
11       to what they did other than selling a legal
12       product that caused his disease and can be
13       addictive which is legal to sell as long as it
14       carries that federally-mandated warning?  That's
15       the only evidence you have.
16           They have not linked in any way Mr. Banks'
17       death to some act by the defendants other than
18       selling cigarettes, which cannot be the basis
19       for liability.
20           His drinking.  Here's what Dr. Traube told
21       you about his drinking.  "Sir, as a physician,
22       you're of the opinion that if a patient drinks
23       it's the patient's choice and the patient is
24       responsible for their drinking, correct?
25           "Yes. "Sir, today you acknowledge that his
2       consumption of alcohol played a role in the
3       development of Mr. Banks' esophageal cancer,
4       correct?
5           "Answer:  Yes."
6           Could I have the Elmo, please.
7           Ladies and gentlemen, if you get -- could I
8       have the Elmo, please.
9           If you get to this question on 3 and 10,
10       ladies and gentlemen, respectfully, I will
11       suggest to you there is no evidence that the
12       tobacco companies did something wrongfully that
13       was a cause of his death.  And if you get to
14       allocating fault the evidence demonstrates that
15       that should be the allocation.
16           If you get to question 10 it's the same
17       analysis.  The evidence demonstrates that that,
18       that should be the allocation of fault if you
19       get to these questions.
20           Need to talk to you about damages.  In case
21       you get to this issue we've got to talk a little
22       bit about damages.  First thing to remember is
23       the legal principle you see in your instructions
24       are that any damages must be fair and just in
25       light of the evidence, in light of the evidence. What evidence is relevant to damages in this
2       case?  As Mr. Schlesinger explained to you this
3       morning, it's the nature of the family
4       relationship and what that loss meant, given the
5       nature of the family relationship.  And although
6       it was uncomfortable at times and we had to
7       cross-examine Yvonne and Katrina on what are
8       normally private matters that don't belong in
9       the public, when you come to court and you make
10       a claim for the loss of someone, those issues
11       become something that has to be asked about for
12       the jury so that the jury has the evidence that
13       they need to make decisions.  That's why those
14       questions were asked.
15           And Mr. Schlesinger acknowledged to you this
16       morning that that is a reasonable thing for you
17       to consider when you evaluate damages.
18           So let's remind ourselves of the damage
19       issues in the case.
20           I have to go back to the projector, please.
21           It's important to understand what the two
22       claims are.  There's a claim for loss of the
23       relationship for Yvonne and Katrina.  They have
24       separate items and you will see they have
25       separate different instructions, but basically it's for loss of Mr. Banks, his companionship,
2       protection, guidance, things like that, that's
3       one set of damage claims.
4           The second set of damage claims is for
5       Mr. Banks' claim for emphysema.  And that
6       involves the pain and suffering that they have
7       attempted to claim that Mr. Banks incurred as a
8       result of his emphysema and their loss as a
9       result of his emphysema.  I'll say it first,
10       we'll dispense of these emphysema claims
11       quickly.
12           There's no evidence, zero evidence that
13       there were any damages caused by emphysema.  As
14       Dr. DiFranza told you, there was no shortness of
15       breath.  There was no cough.  He probably didn't
16       even know he had it.  It was incidental.
17           His primary finding on autopsy, he was never
18       treated for it, he was never diagnosed with it
19       during his life.  It's a nonevent.
20           If you happen to get there, respectfully
21       there's zero damages either for Mr. Banks or
22       Katrina or Yvonne related to emphysema.  There's
23       just not anything there.  You haven't heard a
24       shred of evidence that emphysema affected his
25       life or their lives, none. So let's focus on esophageal cancer.  And,
2       again, the only way to do this is to discuss
3       what the evidence was with respect to what their
4       relationship was, because their claim for
5       $500,000, I guess it is now, is based upon their
6       claim that his smoking caused them to lose their
7       relationship.
8           Here's what we know.  It's important, I
9       think, to bracket that relationship about when
10       it existed and when it didn't exist.
11           We know that between 1914 and 1970
12       Mrs. Banks did not know Mr. Banks.  So he was 57
13       years old before she ever meets him.
14           We know that from the time they met until
15       the time Yvonne and Katrina moved to Miami
16       Mr. Banks always kept a separate apartment,
17       always kept a separate apartment.
18           We know that from 1983 on for the rest of
19       his life Mr. Banks always lived alone while they
20       were in Miami.  And we know that when we
21       cross-examined Yvonne and Katrina they pretty
22       candidly admit that they saw him two or three
23       times a year for two to three days at a time,
24       and so, you know, somewhere between a few days a
25       year and nine days a year.  That was the extent of the relationship for the last 13 years of his
2       life.
3           What else do we know?  Let's talk about the
4       beginning of the relationship.  Ms. Yvonne told
5       us that she wasn't sure she wanted to marry
6       Mr. Banks.  She told us that after they got
7       married they kept the marriage a secret.  Why
8       would they keep the marriage a secret?  She also
9       told you he always kept a separate apartment but
10       she told me she doesn't really remember how
11       often he stayed in his apartment versus how
12       often he stayed with her and Katrina.  So we
13       asked other people what they knew about the time
14       that Mr. Banks spent with Yvonne and Katrina.
15       Mr. Banks' best friend, Diedrich Lampe, told you
16       that he never met Yvonne Banks.  How can your
17       best friend never meet your wife?
18           He also told you that he didn't stay with
19       her a lot, he didn't stay with her a lot.
20           Roosevelt Hall saw Mr. Banks between '65 and
21       '77, didn't know he was married, never saw him
22       with a woman, said he was always alone.
23           His landlady from 1980 to 1985 didn't know
24       he was married, never saw a woman or child go to
25       his apartment.  She did say he didn't take care of himself and she said he looked and acted like
2       a homeless person.  And when asked what she
3       meant by that, she said, he had nowhere to go,
4       he didn't have people to go to, he didn't have
5       people to go to.  Neutral witness.  No stake in
6       this lawsuit one way or another.  No reason to
7       believe she's slanting her testimony in any way.
8           What happened next?  Well, we know that when
9       it got to 1983 Yvonne and Katrina left Mr. Banks
10       in Jacksonville and moved to Miami.  Mr. Banks
11       was 69 years old, 69 years old.  He had been
12       retired since 1975 or '6, so seven or eight
13       years.  And we know that they never asked him to
14       move to Miami with him.
15           What happened after they got to Miami?  Did
16       they maintain a close, loving relationship?  Did
17       Mrs. Banks know the things that a wife knows
18       about her husband if she's in constant
19       communication with him and continues to be
20       involved in a close loving relationship?
21           Here's what Mrs. Banks told us.  She didn't
22       know who his friends were.
23           She didn't know who he spent time with.
24           She didn't know that he had a roommate.  She
25       didn't know how he occupied his time.  She didn't know that he was a problem drinker.  She
2       didn't know when he went to the hospital.  And
3       she told me that she didn't know he had lost
4       weight and he was unable to take care of
5       himself.
6           You have to evaluate what the nature of the
7       relationship reallly was using your common sense
8       and good judgment for a wife not to know those
9       things about her husband, who she described to
10       you all as the love of her life.
11           Katrina gave you an explanation as to why
12       they moved to Miami and left him in
13       Jacksonville.  She told you that his life was in
14       Jacksonville, odd jobs and friends, that he said
15       he never wanted to come to Miami and that he
16       didn't like Miami, he liked Jacksonville.
17           You have to evaluate whether this testimony
18       makes any sense, whether that's really how
19       families work.
20           Let me suggest there are more questions in
21       this case than answers about what was actually
22       going on.
23           Ask yourself these questions:  Why would
24       Yvonne and Katrina leave George in favor of
25       going to stay with her side of the family that they did not know well in Yvonne's case or had
2       never met in Katrina's case?
3           Why would Mr. Banks stay behind to, quote,
4       work when he was 69 years old and has been
5       retired for seven years?
6           Why would Yvonne and Katrina set up another
7       house in Miami when Mr. Banks had been unable to
8       pay for their house in Jacksonville?
9           More questions you might want to ask
10       yourself.  Why would Yvonne move 350 miles away
11       and leave the love of her life to live alone
12       doing odd jobs and yard work?
13           Does that make any sense?
14           Katrina gave you an explanation that they
15       stayed because she liked school.  And you have
16       to ask yourself, why would a 9-year-old girl
17       want to leave her father because she liked the
18       way she was being taught in one school versus
19       the other?
20           And why would Mr. Banks choose to live as a
21       loner, which is the way Mrs. Hall and Roosevelt
22       Hall described him, as a loner in Jacksonville
23       instead of joining his wife and daughter in
24       Miami?
25           You have to ask yourself those questions as you consider this relationship.
2           But let's look a little bit further and ask
3       yourself what was going on?  You saw that when
4       Mr. Banks was admitted to the hospital in 1990
5       when he fell and broke his hand he was asked to
6       identify the person to be notified in case of
7       emergency.  He didn't identify Yvonne or
8       Katrina.  He identified his landlady, his
9       landlady.
10           Further he was asked, and this document is
11       in evidence, the medical records are in
12       evidence, you can look at them all you want.  He
13       was asked to identify the person who should
14       receive his belongings, who should receive his
15       belongings in case something happened to him and
16       he died when he was in hospital.  He identified
17       his landlady, not Yvonne, not Katrina.
18           What was really going on in the
19       relationship?  Something else happened I think
20       is important for you to consider.  You were told
21       about letters from Mr. Banks to Katrina.  You're
22       going to have those letters and you can look at
23       them.  But there's a couple things that jump out
24       from those letters that you'll have to consider
25       what these facts mean with respect to what was going on in Mr. Banks' life vis-ŕ-vis his life
2       versus Yvonne's life.
3           These were letters that Katrina got.
4       They're in evidence.  When you look at the
5       birthday card you will see that the birthday
6       card is written in a different handwriting than
7       Mr. Banks'.  The one on the right appears to be
8       Mr. Banks' handwriting.  The birthday card is
9       written in a script that appears to be a woman's
10       handwriting.  And you will see on that birthday
11       card that, quote, Cat sends her love.  Cat sends
12       her love.
13           In the next letter written by Mr. Banks
14       you'll see Ms. Kats brother is in Miami and
15       maybe you can contact him for something.  So the
16       question is, who is this Ms. Kat that is writing
17       letters for Mr. Banks and who is sending her
18       love to Katrina, sending her love, obviously
19       suggesting an existing relationship where  they
20       knew each other, knew of each other and were
21       fond of each other.  She's sending her love to
22       Katrina
23           And when we asked Katrina who she was,
24       Katrina told you it didn't interest me to know
25       what her full name was, it didn't interest me to know what her full name was.
2           You have to sort through these facts and ask
3       yourself what was going on, what was going on
4       here where another woman was  writing these
5       letters for Mr. Banks and sending her love to
6       Katrina.
7           Just a couple more things on this issue.
8       When Mr. Banks showed up in the hospital in
9       February of '96, the medical records say he was
10       in awful shape.  He was disheveled.  He had
11       massive wasting and weight loss, failure to
12       thrive, unable to keep himself.  His teeth were
13       almost falling out.  That's what the doctors and
14       nurses observed.  Yvonne told you that she
15       didn't know he had lost weight prior to the
16       hospital.  Katrina told you that she didn't
17       remember he lost any weight and she didn't
18       remember any problems with dental hygiene.  How
19       close were they?  How often were they seeing
20       him?  What was the nature of the relationship
21       that they wouldn't know these things?
22           Let's talk about this weight loss, because
23       Katrina told you all that weight loss occurred
24       in the last week of his life.  Let's look at how
25       much weight loss he actually had and you can evaluate what to do with that testimony.
2           We have a baseline medical record from
3       September 20th, 1990 that shows Mr. Banks is
4       five eleven, 160.  When he goes into the
5       hospital in 1996 you will see that he weighed
6       108 pounds, 108 pounds.  A five eleven man, 108
7       pounds?  He was emaciated.  As the medical
8       records said, he had massive wasting and weight
9       loss.  He had a 50 pound weight loss, and you're
10       being told that that happened over the course of
11       a week.
12           What happened further when he went in the
13       hospital?  He started in Methodist Hospital.
14       Yvonne and Katrina said they came and spent some
15       time with with him.  Then he was moved to the
16       VA, and here's what Katrina told us happened in
17       the last two weeks of his life.  He was
18       transferred to the Lake City VA on February 29th
19       and that they spent one night in the VA with him
20       and then they both returned to Tallahassee,
21       about 100 miles away.  Keep in mind that Katrina
22       was 23, 24 years old at this time.  She was in
23       graduate school.  Why did Yvonne have to go back
24       to Tallahassee with Katrina as opposed to
25       staying with Mr. Banks?  Katrina is 23, 24 years old.
2           They told you that they received a call from
3       the hospital on March 12th telling them that
4       they should come soon but that they never went
5       back.  Bottom line is, you know, I don't want us
6       to go off track.  He spent the last two weeks of
7       his life alone in the hospital and died as an
8       81-year-old man who had been left alone and
9       unable to take care of himself and lost 50
10       pounds and showed up five eleven 108 pounds.
11       And they're requesting that you award them
12       $500,000 or more for the loss of Mr. Banks.
13           THE COURT:  You're just over your
14       expiration.
15           MR. FURR:  Yes, sir, thank you very much.
16       I'll finish in 10 minutes or less, if that
17       please the Court.
18           THE COURT:  Go ahead, sir.
19           MR. FURR:  The last topic I want to go to is
20       this issue of punitive damages.
21           It was really almost all that
22       Mr. Schlesinger talked about this morning.  They
23       told you that Mr. Banks was a conduit, a conduit
24       that they were using to try to get to punitive
25       damages.  The holy grail of punitive damages has been what this case has been about from the
2       plaintiff's perspective from the beginning.
3       That's what the case has been about, that's how
4       it was argued to you.
5           Let's look at what the law is on punitive
6       damages.  By the way, if you find that he did
7       not die from concealment you never get to
8       punitive damages.  You see in your instructions
9       you never get to question 18.  But if you do you
10       need to understand what you're really being
11       asked, because in addition to the $500,000 or
12       more that you're being asked to award, you're
13       being asked to award them more money unrelated
14       to any loss.  More money, that's what this case
15       has been about.
16           Couple important principles to understand.
17       Can only be awarded for concealment that was a
18       legal cause of his death.  They can only go to
19       Yvonne and Katrina.  They can only go to Yvonne
20       and Katrina.  And that they are in addition to
21       damages that you're being requested to fully
22       compensate them.  They want you to fully
23       compensate them and then they want to come back
24       on Monday and ask you for more money.  That's
25       what this claim is about, pure and simple. Because it's such an extraordinary claim
2       you're being asked to give them money unrelated
3       to their losses, more money, even after you've
4       made them whole, if you would happen to do so.
5       As Mr. Schlesinger told you, the highest
6       possible burden of proof in civil law, clear and
7       convincing evidence.  They have to prove to you
8       that they are entitled to punitive damages based
9       upon your review of the evidence without
10       hesitation.
11           On page 26 of your instructions you will see
12       the punitive damages burden of proof, clear and
13       convincing, "In contrast, clear and convincing
14       evidence is evidence that is precise, explicit,
15       lacking in confusion and of such weight that it
16       produces a firm belief or conviction without
17       hesitation about the matter at issue."  That's
18       the burden they've taken on to come back here on
19       Monday and ask you for more money.
20           And it's only related to concealment.  So
21       let's look at what the evidence was.  We'll go
22       through this quickly.  Important to remember
23       that the Engle findings, you'll see in your
24       instructions, can't be used.
25           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection. THE COURT:  Overruled.
2           MR. FURR:  The Engle findings cannot be
3       considered in any way.
4           THE COURT:  This is all set forth in the
5       legal instruction.
6           MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's not in the
7       instruction, Your Honor.  May I approach,
8       please?  This is not in the instructions.
9           THE COURT:  If it's not in the instructions
10       then the jury will disregard the remarks by
11       counsel.
12           MR. FURR:  You'll see that the Engle
13       findings do not establish that Yvonne and
14       Katrina are entitled to punitive damages.
15           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Your Honor, could we have
16       this corrected so it's not left confused?
17           MR. FURR:  Your Honor, please.
18           THE COURT:  It is corrected.  If it's in the
19       legal instructions, that's what they'll follow.
20       If it's not, then they won't follow it.  Okay,
21       that's corrected.
22           Go ahead, sir.
23           MR. FURR:  This question, should the
24       defendants be punished, should they be punished,
25       based on concealment?  A big part of what you were told about at CTR as an arm of concealment.
2       Well, there's another side to the story.  CTR
3       did some very important work on behalf of the
4       tobacco companies and the plaintiff's witnesses
5       admit it.
6           Tobacco companies gave CTR 350 million
7       dollars to fund research.  They funded thousands
8       of scientists who wrote thousands of articles.
9       You were told they were distraction research but
10       then Dr. Proctor admitted over 600 times these
11       Surgeon General books that they have read from
12       so many times, over 600 times they cited CTR,
13       CTR-sponsored research.  Nobel Prize winners
14       were sponsored.  It was prestigious universities
15       all over the country.
16           Dr. Cummings told you that when scientists
17       were given CTR money they were given complete
18       scientific freedom.  You were shown this article
19       by Knapp.  It's in evidence.  1963, CTR funded
20       research that concluded that heavy cigarette
21       smokers thus appear to be true addicts, true
22       addicts.
23           Tobacco company money.  You were told about
24       Larson, Haag and Silvette by Dr. Cummings.  He
25       said he disagreed with some of the conclusions in Larson, Haag and Silvette, but you were told,
2       remember he called it the green monster?  He
3       said it was a compilation of all the research
4       that had ever been done funded by CTR money and
5       that it was cited on and relied on, it was cited
6       by and relied on Surgeon General 1964 in that
7       famous 1964 report.
8           You heard about Premier and Eclipse.  You're
9       entitled to look at mitigating evidence, that is
10       evidence that goes the other way.  Mitigating
11       evidence is evidence that suggests that punitive
12       damages are not needed.
13           What did Dr. Proctor tell you?  He told you
14       about two very novel cigarettes that RJ Reynolds
15       developed called Premier and Eclipse.  He told
16       you they spent a billion dollars, that they were
17       commercial failures because of the poor taste,
18       but he told you they were less carcinogenic
19       cigarettes, less carcinogenic cigarettes.
20           What else can a tobacco company do and stay
21       in business?  They can put a warning on the
22       pack.  They can try to develop less dangerous
23       products.  That's what Reynolds did.
24           Dr. Proctor told you that both Philip Morris
25       and Reynolds tried hard to reduce nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, two
2       categories of chemicals that are thought to be
3       very important with respect to tobacco
4       carcinogenesis.
5           And finally, mitigating evidence, you're
6       being asked to punish them for concealment.  Are
7       they concealing?
8           This is the only evidence you have of
9       current day.  The website that the plaintiffs
10       put into evidence yesterday, RJ Reynolds'
11       website states:  "RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company
12       believes that individuals should rely on the
13       conclusions of the U.S. Surgeon General, the
14       Centers for Disease Control and other public
15       health officials when making decisions regarding
16       smoking."
17           And to make it easier for people to access
18       that information they actually provide links to
19       Surgeon General's Report and other public health
20       reports right there so the smoker can click and
21       get the information from the authorities that
22       they've used throughout this trial.
23           Ladies and gentlemen, if you get to question
24       18, if you get to question 18, whatever else
25       you've done, I submit the answer to that question should be no, we can all go home, the
2       case is over.  If you say yes, we'll come back
3       next Monday or whenever that day is so that we
4       can have a second phase and more evidence.
5           Let me wind up.  Wind up with three more
6       things.  This case is actually pretty simple.
7       You knew everything you needed to know to decide
8       this case before you ever walked in here in some
9       ways.  And these things have always been known.
10           Let's go back to 1955.  Dr. Hammond, one of
11       the early researchers who was studying -- doing
12       the epidemiology studies and reporting to the
13       public about the danger of smoking, let's look
14       at how smoking has always been viewed throughout
15       time.
16           Dr. Hammond, 1955.
17           (Video clip was played and taken down to the
18 best of the reporter's ability as follows:)
19           VOICE:  In my opinion people should be
20       warned of the dangers and they are being warned.
21       What they then want to do, whether they wish to
22       smoke or not is their own business.
23           (Video clip concluded.)
24           MR. FURR:  People had the information, they
25       get to make their own choice. Harry Reasoner 1964 when the Surgeon
2       General's Report was released.
3           (Video clip was played and taken down to the
4 best of the reporter's ability as follows:)
5           VOICE:  In this kind of a country it comes
6       down to you whether you like it or not.  No one
7       is going to forbid an adult to smoke and it is
8       now quite clear that no one is going to tell him
9       it's good for him either.  The decision is his,
10       the decision and the health that may depend on
11       it.
12           (Video clip concluded.)
13           MR. FURR:  People have information, they
14       make their own choices, that's the way it's
15       always been.
16           One final thing to look at.  I selected this
17       because I do not think that anyone could ever
18       say it better.  Dr. Koop, we've seen him several
19       times, the Surgeon General in 1988, was the
20       Surgeon General responsible for the report that
21       concluded that smoking was addictive.  As you
22       heard during the cross of Dr. Proctor, Dr. Koop
23       maintained a website where he provided advice to
24       smokers about smoking.  And here's what Dr. Koop
25       had to say about smokers 14 years after the 1988 Surgeon General's Report.
2           "The choice to light up is always yours."
3           "Ultimately you are the one that has control
4       over your behavior.  The cigarette is not going
5       to light itself and jump into your mouth."
6           This is the Surgeon General responsible for
7       the report that found that smoking is addictive.
8       It doesn't change anything.  People still make
9       choices, and in our society we have to take
10       responsibility for those choices.
11           I've talked too long.  Thank you very much
12       for your attention throughout the trial and
13       today.  I appreciate it very much.  And I ask
14       you to return a complete verdict in favor of
15       RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris.  Thank you.


21           MR. HEISE:  Good afternoon.
22           It's my pleasure to be here finally, have
23       the opportunity to talk with you.  I know you
24       all haven't forgotten about me sitting over
25       there in the corner, although occasionally sometimes I'm forgotten.
2           You know my name is Mark Heise.  You know I
3       represent Philip Morris.  You know I'm going to
4       be brief and you know if I'm standing up here
5       we're getting towards the end and that's true
6       again today.
7           So about two weeks ago we got together and I
8       told you at that time I was going to give you a
9       preview of the evidence, what we expected based
10       upon discovery and depositions that have taken
11       place.  In fact, that's what has happened here.
12       And we went through that evidence carefully.
13       And I've sat here and listened carefully as
14       Mr. Furr went through the presentation.  And to
15       put everyone's mind at ease, I'm not going to
16       repeat what he said.  I'm going to do what I've
17       done throughout this trial and that is to focus
18       on additional reasons to find in favor of
19       Philip Morris.
20           But to be clear, I completely agree with
21       what Mr. Furr said and what he said applies with
22       equal force to Philip Morris.
23           And one thing I probably should have said to
24       start this off with is I've been watching and
25       noting that all of you have been taking notes during all of this, paying attention, being
2       diligent, upholding your service as jurors.  And
3       as the other lawyers did, I want to thank you
4       because it's an important part of the American
5       fabric and society for the service you're
6       giving.  We deeply appreciate that on all sides.
7           As I said, one of the key issues I've
8       focused on throughout this trial, you saw it
9       from my questioning of witnesses, is how long
10       did George Banks smoke Marlboro cigarettes.
11           And the evidence that came in the trial was
12       exactly how I thought it was going to come in
13       based upon the prior sworn testimony.  But there
14       was one instance of evidence that came in that
15       was completely different than what we heard at
16       trial.  And because of that difference I need to
17       take a few moments to walk through with you the
18       evidence that we got before trial and the
19       evidence that you heard here today.  Because I
20       think it will put in focus for you the
21       additional reason why Philip Morris is not
22       liable in this case.
23           What I did is I prepared a brief timeline
24       here to highlight for you the evidence.
25           This is before trial you know on February 17th, 2012 Ms. Banks swore under oath when she
2       answered interrogatories.  And I had it on a
3       flip chart, but I put it on the big screen here.
4       Those are the five brands of cigarettes that she
5       put down in her answers to interrogatories.
6       Camels, Chesterfield, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall
7       and Bugler.
8           As you see, Chesterfield was the go-to brand
9       whenever Camels were out.  And you heard that
10       Chesterfield is no longer in this case, because
11       they're a small company and they're just suing
12       the two big companies.
13           You also see on this list Bugler.  What you
14       don't see is Marlboro, one of the most popular
15       brands, a brand somebody wouldn't forget.  And
16       what I think is important, and Mr. Furr
17       emphasized this, is that these are the sworn
18       answers given before Ms. Banks got sick and
19       before her memory failed.  This is what she knew
20       at a time when she was feeling well and did not
21       have any memory issues.
22           These five brands, and as you know, I've
23       said it every time I've stood up, none of them
24       are Marlboro.
25           You know from the testimony you heard on the witness stand that she went to a lawyer's
2       office, sat there, looked over, she wrote out
3       her answers and had them typed up.  And you
4       heard on the witness stand when she got these
5       she had all the time in the world to answer
6       them.  It's not a situation like this where
7       you've got people looking at you and you feel a
8       little stressed and you're hurrying through
9       them.  She had whatever time she needed.  She
10       made sure to look over them very carefully as
11       she testified.
12           "And after the answers were typed up, you
13       looked at them very carefully to make sure they
14       were accurate?
15           "Right."
16           And then importantly for your purposes the
17       last question and answer.
18           "And you knew it was important to give
19       complete and accurate information when you gave
20       those written answers, right?
21           "That's right."
22           So that's what she knew at that time and
23       there was never once a supplemental to these
24       answers in writing, not once.
25           Then continuing on, what happened before trial Ms. Banks' deposition was taken.  And in
2       that situation, because you heard a lot of her
3       deposition testimony because it was read to her
4       to remind her what she said, these two things
5       were told by her at her deposition.
6           On page 205, "And how long did he try the
7       Marlboros?"
8           And this is when defense lawyers were asking
9       her questions.
10           "He tried it a while, tried it.  He tried it
11       a while and went back.  I don't know.  And went
12       back to Chesterfield and Camels, Chesterfield
13       and Camels.  But Camel was his main brand.
14           "Did I read that correctly?
15           "I guess you did.
16           "I see.  Okay.
17           "No problem.
18           "Tried it for a little while."
19           Then when her own lawyer was asking her
20       questions at the deposition as you can see she
21       was asked by her own lawyers asking about this
22       for a little while.
23           "Do you know if he smoked these Marlboros
24       for a little while, more than a week?  Your
25       lawyer asked you questions. "More than a week, yes.
2           "Do you know if it was more or less than two
3       weeks?
4           "It was about two weeks that he smoked
5       them."
6           So that's what I told you the evidence would
7       be and that's what she said.
8           As you know we took the deposition of
9       Katrina Banks as well.  And what did she tell
10       you at deposition?  You heard three different
11       portions of her deposition were read to you when
12       she testified.  All three times she said, when
13       the store was out of Camel he would get Marlboro
14       or Pall Mall.  Pall Mall of course is another
15       unfiltered brand.
16           So when the store was out of Camel that's
17       when he would try the Marlboro or the Pall Mall.
18       You have to think about that, how often is a
19       store going to be out of one of the leading
20       selling brands of cigarettes, the Camel
21       cigarettes?  That's like a store running out of
22       Pepsi or Coke.  It's not something that happens
23       all the time.
24           And of course she never mentioned his go-to
25       brand, the Chesterfields, in her deposition. She mentioned these other brands including
2       Marlboro.
3           So then you heard -- we took the deposition
4       of Dr. DiFranza and I explained to you in the
5       opening what I expected his testimony to be
6       based upon his review of the entire record, all
7       the medical records, all of the depositions, not
8       just the three excerpts where Ms. Katrina Banks
9       said he only did it when the store was out of
10       Camel.  He read her entire deposition, he read
11       all of Yvonne Banks deposition, he concluded it
12       was as little as one week, perhaps up to two
13       months.  And that was the state of the record
14       when we got here to trial.
15           So what happens when we get to trial?
16           This is before we get here and here is when
17       we get here.  We know the written answers to
18       interrogatories didn't change.  Those are the
19       only five brands listed under oath in writing.
20           Dr. DiFranza came in based, again, on his
21       whole review of everything and he says one week
22       to two months.  And, specifically, what I want
23       to alert you to is he told us, "You read the
24       daughter Katrina's deposition, right?
25           "Right. "And from there, based on your review of
2       everything you gave yourself as little as a week
3       or as much as two months."
4           So he said exactly what we expected him to
5       say because that was the state of the record.
6           Then of course we all know Dr. Traube came
7       in and told everybody in the courtroom five
8       years is not enough smoking.  And I'm going to
9       talk about that in more detail in a minute.
10           Then you heard Yvonne Banks go on the
11       witness stand.  And really it didn't change much
12       of what she said.  I had to remind her of what
13       she said before, before she had the memory
14       problems.  And she agreed that he tried them for
15       two weeks then he went back to the Camels and
16       the Chesterfields, so that stayed the same.
17           But the one thing that changed was Katrina
18       Banks' testimony.  For the first time ever we
19       hear that Mr. Banks smoked Marlboro for a very
20       long time.  Now, why would somebody do that?  We
21       all know why.  Because Dr. Traube said five pack
22       years is not enough.  Five years of smoking a
23       pack a day of cigarettes is not enough to cause
24       esophageal cancer, it's not enough to cause
25       emphysema or COPD.  So when all the testimony was it was a week or two weeks or two months,
2       that was the end of it for Marlboros.  But
3       suddenly we got this new statement that it was
4       for a very long period, almost 20 years.
5           She had the opportunity to correct anything
6       that she said was wrong in her deposition.  You
7       saw the errata sheet that the doctor had filled
8       out.  He was very careful to review his
9       deposition.  There was no such errata sheet.
10           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor.
11           THE COURT:  Legal basis.
12           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Can't comment -- not in
13       evidence.
14           THE COURT:  Sustained.
15           You can only refer to things that are in
16       evidence, sir.
17           MR. HEISE:  So what did Katrina Banks tell
18       us?
19           She now remembers for the first time ever
20       that when she's two or three years old she's got
21       this distinct memory of her father smoking
22       Marlboros.  She remembers that almost 40 years
23       later.  And she said that he smoked Marlboros
24       all the way through 1992.  That's four years
25       after Mr. Banks himself said he stopped smoking, because we saw the medical records.
2           Mr. Banks told his doctors, I stopped
3       smoking two years ago in 1988, but she happens
4       to now in this court remember for the first time
5       ever he smoked it until 1992.  That's also four
6       years after their very own expert said,
7       plaintiff's expert, his conclusion that he
8       stopped smoking in 1988.
9           So one of the instructions you're going to
10       be given in this case is you have to determine
11       credibility.  Who is it that you believe?  And
12       you're asked by the Court to follow this
13       instruction and to look, does the witness have
14       any interest in the outcome of the case?  Are
15       they looking for money?  Do they have the means
16       and the opportunity to know the facts?  Do they
17       live in the same city?  Is their testimony
18       reasonable?  Is it reasonable that somebody
19       could remember 40 years ago when they were two
20       years old what their father smoked, what brand?
21       Is it reasonable to go from no Marlboros, based
22       on the answers to interrogatories, to almost 20
23       years of smoking Marlboros?
24           You have to decide what's believable and
25       what's not.  When you do, you'll be presented with the verdict form.  You're going to be asked
2       to go through all 18 questions.  You'll be asked
3       to go through them in order.  You don't start
4       with 18, you start with 1.
5           And Mr. Furr went through very carefully
6       questions 1 and 2 about class membership, that's
7       where he put the three Xs because there's three
8       independent reasons why you should answer no to
9       all those questions.  I don't have anything to
10       add to what Mr. Furr said other than to again
11       remind you that we agree with what he said and
12       that it applies equally to Philip Morris as it
13       does to Reynolds.
14           So the next question, and it's actually
15       questions 3 and 10 on the verdict form.  You'll
16       see question 3 and there's a similar one for
17       question 10, it talks about the percentage of
18       fault that was a legal cause of George Banks'
19       esophageal cancer and death and number 10 talks
20       about emphysema.  But it's the exact same
21       question.
22           Mr. Furr outlined for you why it is that
23       Mr. Banks is 100 percent responsible and that
24       the other two are zero percent.  But I suggest
25       to you there's an additional reason as to Philip Morris why Philip Morris has to be zero
2       percent.  And that is the medical testimony that
3       you heard in this case.
4           The doctors came in and they told you what
5       you probably knew from your common sense, that
6       smoking two weeks of any cigarette is not enough
7       to cause disease, but the amount of Marlboro
8       cigarettes that Mr. Banks smoked is not the
9       legal cause of any of his injuries.  And that's
10       why this question is divided up between
11       Philip Morris, Reynolds and George Banks.  So
12       that's an additional reason why you would put a
13       zero for Philip Morris.
14           And what I would put up -- it's probably the
15       only time in history this has ever been done.
16       I'm going to put up my entire cross-examination
17       of Dr. Traube, their expert.
18           Baron, can you flip it back, please.  Thank
19       you.
20           This is my entire cross-examination.  I
21       asked him two questions.
22           "You would agree that if someone smoked a
23       pack a day for five years or less that's not
24       enough smoking to cause esophageal cancer,
25       right? "Correct.
2           "And, likewise, if someone smokes a pack a
3       day for five years or less, that's not enough to
4       cause COPD or emphysema?"
5           He says what you already knew.  There's no
6       evidence that he smoked more than a week, two
7       weeks or two months.  There's certainly no
8       credible evidence that he smoked a pack a day of
9       Marlboros for five years or more than five
10       years.  Because their other doctor,
11       Dr. DiFranza, said it takes much more than five
12       years.  And that's an additional reason why
13       Philip Morris would be zero percent.
14           Mr. Furr went over the other portions of the
15       verdict form, the concealment and the agreement
16       to conceal.  Again, I'm not going to belabor the
17       same points he did.  Everything applies to
18       Philip Morris, but I will make two additional
19       points, one is there's a jury instruction that's
20       important for your consideration on this.
21           Baron, if I could have the Elmo, please.
22           And this jury instruction is the legal
23       product instruction.  And what it says is, "The
24       manufacture, advertisement and sale of
25       cigarettes are lawful activities, therefore, I," the Court, "instructs you that defendants cannot
2       be held liable merely for manufacturing, selling
3       or advertising cigarettes."
4           Why do I bring that to you?  Because what
5       have you been told George Banks saw?  You were
6       told there was some Marlboro ad sometime in the
7       1970s or '80s that nobody can identify whether
8       it was in a magazine or a billboard or any of
9       that.  But that's all you've been given with one
10       other important fact.  That ad wherever it was
11       had the Surgeon General's warning on it.  But
12       this is an additional reason why Philip Morris
13       is not responsible under the agreement to
14       conceal or the concealment is because all you've
15       been pointed to is this advertisement for
16       Marlboro.
17           And he's tried the Marlboro for two weeks
18       and then he went back to what he wanted.  He
19       didn't like them.  It's not the legal cause of
20       any of his injuries under these claims for
21       concealment or an agreement to conceal.
22           And so then you have the question of
23       damages.  Mr. Furr covered that at length.  I'm
24       not going to get into that any further.  But
25       then it concludes with punitive damages.  And I want to make an observation here.  As I said, I
2       agree with Mr. Furr, but what Mr. Schlesinger
3       told you in opening is exactly what happened
4       again in closing.  He told you that this is
5       about a generic smoker.  This case is not about
6       a generic smoker, it's about George Banks.  And
7       that's important when you're considering the
8       evidence and when you're looking at answering
9       these questions, particularly this issue of
10       punitive damages.
11           Because, as you were instructed by the
12       Court, for punitive damages, "Punitive damages
13       are warranted against a defendant if you find by
14       clear and convincing," that heightened standard,
15       "that the defendant was guilty of intentional
16       misconduct which was a substantial cause of
17       Mr. Banks' injuries and death."
18           So what's the first thing you heard about
19       today?  Menthol.  You know from the evidence in
20       this case George Banks never tried a menthol
21       cigarette in his life, but they spend their
22       first 5 or 10 minutes talking about menthol.  It
23       has to be intentional misconduct which was a
24       substantial cause of Mr. Banks' injury.  And on
25       that score all you've heard about is this Marlboro ad.  Advertisement is not intentional
2       misconduct, it's trying to get people to buy
3       your product.  As you saw from the jury
4       instruction, advertising is entirely legal and
5       we cannot be held responsible or liable for
6       that.
7           The other thing you heard a lot from the --
8       Mr. Schlesinger on was the nicotine, that that's
9       the evil in the cigarettes.  And remember when
10       Dr. Proctor was on the stand one of the
11       questions I asked him was to tell this jury,
12       Philip Morris tried to get nicotine out of
13       tobacco.  They bought the company Sanka that
14       took the caffeine out of coffee beans.  And they
15       thought, what a great idea, we can take the
16       nicotine out of tobacco.  And they marketed
17       that.  They put it in stores.  They tried to
18       sell it and nobody bought it.  It was a big
19       flop.  They made the effort to do exactly what
20       is being suggested here, that is not conduct
21       that should be punished in any way or any form.
22           So let me say it's been about two weeks and
23       about the length of time that Mr. Banks smoked
24       the Marlboro cigarettes.  It was not enough to
25       cause him any disease.  It's not enough for him to be a member of this class.  Ask you to fill
2       out the verdict form as Mr. Furr went through it
3       with you and find in favor of Philip Morris and
4       RJ Reynolds on all counts, but in particular for
5       the reasons that I outlined for you with
6       Philip Morris.
7           And I will end where I started by thanking
8       you very much for your service.  I do appreciate
9       all the time and attention you've given all of
10       us.  Thank you very much.
