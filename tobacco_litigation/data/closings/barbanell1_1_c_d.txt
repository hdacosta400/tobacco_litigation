 4                MR. GERAGHTY:  Counsel.
 5                Good morning, ladies and gentleman.  As
 6          you know -- Good morning.
 7                As you know, my name is Bill Geraghty,
 8          and Jenny -- along with Jenny Brown, we
 9          represent Philip Morris; and Jenny and I wanted
10          to start by just thanking you again, as
11          Mr. Hammer did, for all the time and attention
12          you've spent during the last two-and-a-half
13          weeks.
14                I think if your questions -- the
15          questions you have asked are indicative of how
16          much time, thought and consideration you have
17          given to the issues in the case; and I think on
18          behalf of everybody, we truly appreciate how
19          much attention you have paid.
20                I want to start by talking to you about
21          testimony that is not in dispute.  What doctors
22          write in their medical records is presumed to
23          be true.
24                What doctors write in their medical 25          records is presumed to be true because the

 1          information they have about the patient is
 2          fresh in their mind at the time they prepare
 3          the medical record.
 4                That's what plaintiff's own cancer
 5          expert, Dr. Malin Dollinger, told you during
 6          his testimony; and on that particular issue, he
 7          is absolutely right, absolutely right.
 8                All of plaintiff's medical experts agree
 9          that Shirley Barbanell's treating doctors had
10          more information about her condition when they
11          were treating her back in 1996, than what those
12          plaintiff's experts have today when you heard
13          them give you their opinions from this witness
14          stand.
15                And with all of the care and treatment of
16          Shirley Barbanell fresh in his mind,
17          Dr. Mascarenhas -- Dr. Mascarenhas filled out
18          that death certificate, and he wrote that
19          Shirley Barbanell died from liver cirrhosis
20          with ascites.  Liver cirrhosis with ascites.
21                Recall what Dr. Mascarenhas told you.  He
22          put Shirley Barbanell into the hospital on two
23          separate occasions, in March, and again on
24          April the 11th, just two weeks before she
25          passed away.

 1                Dr. Mascarenhas told you he went to visit
 2          Shirley every single day she was in the
 3          hospital, and on some occasions twice per day.
 4                He saw her physical condition, he saw her
 5          signs and symptoms, he had his entire medical
 6          chart with him, including the results of the
 7          biopsy, and the blood tests, and all of that
 8          information.  He had all of that information
 9          when he signed the death certificate.
10                And as Dr. Dollinger told you, the cause
11          of death on a death certificate is the final
12          diagnosis.  The final diagnosis.  That's what
13          Dr. Dollinger told you.
14                Dr. Blaustein also told you the same
15          thing.  He's filled out many death
16          certificates.  The death certificate is the
17          final diagnosis.
18                And in this case, as far as Shirley
19          Barbanell is concerned, the final diagnosis was
20          not lung cancer, it was not emphysema, it was
21          liver cirrhosis with ascites.
22                You heard from Dr. Mascarenhas because we
23          called him as a witness.  He sat there on that
24          witness stand for several hours and answered
25          every single question that I asked and every

 1          single question that Mr. Hammer asked.
 2                His only concern 13 years ago was to give
 3          Shirley Barbanell the very best care and
 4          treatment he knew how, he knew how.
 5                He was unequivocal when he told you that
 6          the mass in the lung and the reference to COPD
 7          did not cause Shirley Barbanell's death.  He
 8          was unequivocal when he told you that on the
 9          witness stand.  Unequivocal. 10                And he told you that he intentionally
11          chose the word "lung mass," not "lung cancer,"
12          because he never diagnosed her with lung
13          cancer.
14                And you heard that he told all of this to
15          Leon and Shirley Barbanell 13 years ago, before
16          she passed away, and that they understood and
17          they agreed.
18                And 13 years later, in 2009, as we sit
19          here today, Leon Barbanell still sees
20          Dr. Mascarenhas as his treating physician.
21          That testimony is uncontested in this case.
22                So, with that testimony in mind, let's
23          talk about the verdict form, and the questions
24          you are going to be asked to answer.  The
25          verdict form is going to come in two pages.

 1                I told you -- I told you two weeks ago --
 2                We had our opening statement two weeks
 3          ago, and I told you this case was not about
 4          whether cigarette smoking can cause lung
 5          cancer, not about whether nicotine in
 6          cigarettes is addictive.  Those issues are not
 7          in dispute in this case, and you won't see any
 8          question asking you about either of those
 9          issues on the verdict form itself.
10                I told you two weeks ago this case was a
11          wrongful death case, a wrongful death case;
12          meaning, the issue is, has plaintiff sustained
13          his burden to prove to you that Shirley
14          Barbanell's death was caused from either lung
15          cancer or emphysema as a result of her alleged
16          addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine.
17                And these are the questions you're going
18          to be asked:  Question Number 1 is the wrongful
19          death question.  Was Shirley Barbanell addicted
20          to cigarettes containing nicotine; and, if so,
21          was such addiction a legal cause of her death
22          from -- and you know the plaintiff claims lung
23          cancer, and then the second part is emphysema,
24          a form of COPD.  That's the first question
25          you're going to be asked to decide in this

 1          case.
 2                Now, I submit to you, ladies and
 3          gentleman, that the evidence you have heard,
 4          all the evidence you've heard over the last two
 5          weeks, the only just and fair verdict is that
 6          the answer to this question is "no."  "No" to
 7          1(a) and 1(b).
 8                And when you answer "no" to 1(a) and
 9          1(b), you will then move on to Question 2,
10          which is called a survival claim.  This is an
11          alternative claim that the plaintiff is making
12          in the case.
13                And the question here says, was Shirley
14          Barbanell addicted to cigarettes containing
15          nicotine; and, if so, was such addiction a
16          legal cause of lung cancer, A, or, B,
17          emphysema, a form of COPD.
18                So, the difference here is we're talking
19          about death in the first question, and here
20          we're simply talking about lung cancer and 21          emphysema.
22                And the reason that claim is being made
23          is because the plaintiff believes that he has
24          not proven to you that Shirley Barbanell --
25                MR. HAMMER:  Objection --

 1                MR. GERAGHTY:  -- died.
 2                MR. HAMMER:  Objection, that's not --
 3                THE COURT:  Overruled, sir.  You can
 4          respond in rebuttal.
 5                MR. GERAGHTY:  The only reason this
 6          alternative claim, survival, is being made is
 7          because the plaintiff believes he cannot -- he
 8          has not sustained his burden of proof to you
 9          that Shirley Barbanell died from lung cancer,
10          emphysema, caused by her alleged addiction.
11          Those are the first two questions.
12                THE COURT:  Get yourself some water.
13                MR. GERAGHTY:  Thank you.
14                The third and fourth questions I have on
15          the board here, these questions are simply
16          straightforward questions that ask you to
17          determine facts.
18                Did Shirley Barbanell know, or should she
19          have known in the exercise of reasonable care
20          prior to May 5, 1990, that she had been
21          injured, and that there was a reasonable
22          possibility that her injury was caused by
23          cigarette smoking?
24                The next question is, did Shirley
25          Barbanell know, or should she have known in the

 1          exercise of reasonable care prior to May 5,
 2          1990, that she suffered from emphysema, a form
 3          of COPD, and that there was a reasonable
 4          possibility that this injury was caused by
 5          cigarette smoking.
 6                Those are the four questions on the
 7          verdict form.  Now, on these first two
 8          questions -- on these first two questions on
 9          this board here, the plaintiff bears the burden
10          of proof.
11                The plaintiff has the burden of proof to
12          prove to you by the greater weight of the
13          evidence that Mrs. Barbanell was addicted to
14          cigarettes containing nicotine, and this
15          alleged addiction was the legal cause of her
16          death from lung cancer or emphysema.
17                The "greater weight of the evidence" --
18          this is the instruction you'll get -- means the
19          more persuasive and convincing force and effect
20          of the entire evidence in the case.
21                So, plaintiff must prove to you that
22          Shirley Barbanell died with the more persuasive
23          and convincing force and effect of the entire
24          evidence.  That means medical evidence, hard
25          medical evidence, medical data.

 1                The standard, the burden, is not what you
 2          heard earlier, "more likely than not, 51
 3          percent."  Listen when you hear the
 4          instructions from Judge Streitfeld.  You will
 5          not hear either of those phrases when Judge  6          Streitfeld gives you the instructions.
 7                This is the burden of proof that
 8          plaintiff must sustain in this case.  The
 9          greater weight means the plaintiff cannot prove
10          his case with speculation, maybes,
11          possibilities, unfounded assumptions that his
12          experts are willing to offer here in this
13          courtroom.
14                In other words, you cannot decide this
15          case for the plaintiff by jumping to
16          conclusions that are not supported by the more
17          persuasive and convincing force of the medical
18          evidence and the data you've heard in this
19          case.  And that's exactly what the plaintiff is
20          asking you to do in this case, because they
21          don't have any hard medical evidence.
22                Mr. Hammer has showed you several times
23          this concept of a scale.  Well, before you
24          heard anything, two weeks ago today on Monday,
25          you had heard nothing, no evidence.  That's

 1          where we were.  We were there at the bottom,
 2          zero.
 3                The plaintiff's burden is to bring forth
 4          medical evidence that rises to the level such
 5          that you are convinced that the more persuasive
 6          and convincing force and effect of the evidence
 7          supports his claim.
 8                Now, plaintiff has spent the past two
 9          weeks presenting the very best evidence, the
10          very best evidence that he can; and yet here we
11          are, and the three simple truths that I told
12          you about during opening statement, those three
13          simple truths remain undisputed and uncontested
14          in this case.
15                Number one, Shirley Barbanell's treating
16          doctors did not diagnose her with cancer.  None
17          of the doctors who treated Shirley Barbanell
18          ever diagnosed her with cancer; and, frankly,
19          you can now add emphysema to that list.  You
20          can add emphysema to that list.
21                And when I say "treating doctors," I'm
22          talking about the doctors who were charged with
23          the responsibility of caring for, treating, and
24          diagnosing Shirley Barbanell in the last months
25          of her life.

 1                Who are we talking about?  Dr. Frankel,
 2          the pulmonologist; Dr. Bradley Towbin, the
 3          gastroenterologist; and Dr. Eugene Mascarenhas,
 4          the primary care physician, the attending
 5          physician.  He was the quarterback of Shirley
 6          Barbanell's treating team.  He told you he was
 7          the, quote, captain of the ship.
 8                And as you've now heard, those doctors
 9          certainly suspected that Shirley Barbanell had
10          lung cancer, but they never diagnosed her with
11          lung cancer.  Those doctors all knew 13 years
12          ago that Shirley Barbanell was a heavy
13          cigarette smoker.  You heard that testimony.
14                In fact, those doctors 13 years ago were
15          aware of everything that Mr. Hammer has told
16          you during the course of this trial.  They were 17          aware of all of it, yet they never diagnosed
18          her with lung cancer or emphysema.
19                Second, none of these treating doctors
20          ever said or wrote that she died from lung
21          cancer or emphysema; and if they had done so,
22          you would see reference to it in the medical
23          records we still have today, but you've seen no
24          reference to that in any of the records we have
25          today.

 1                All the records in the final weeks of her
 2          life pointed to one thing.  They pointed to
 3          disease in her abdomen, the disease that was
 4          killing her, liver cirrhosis with ascites.
 5                Finally, and most importantly, every
 6          single medical expert, every single medical
 7          expert who has testified in this case has
 8          agreed that those treating doctors, 13 years
 9          ago, had more information than the plaintiff's
10          experts have today.
11                Ladies and gentleman, no one is asking
12          you to leave your common sense.  I urge you, I
13          implore you, use your common sense in this
14          case.
15                If the plaintiff -- if Mr. Barbanell was
16          so confident, so confident that his wife died
17          from lung cancer or emphysema, why didn't he
18          ever bring Dr. Mascarenhas to testify,
19          Dr. Frankel to testify, or Dr. Towbin?
20                Because there is no dispute that those
21          doctors -- those doctors are in the best
22          position to tell you what caused Shirley
23          Barbanell's death 13 years ago.
24                And the reason he didn't call them is
25          because Mr. Barbanell, the plaintiff, knows

 1          that none of those doctors diagnosed her with
 2          lung cancer, none of those doctors diagnosed
 3          her with emphysema.  They said she died from
 4          liver cirrhosis with ascites.
 5                Ask yourself why plaintiff never called
 6          Dr. Frankel, Shirley Barbanell's pulmonologist,
 7          who specializes in lung disease.  He said that
 8          Shirley didn't have lung cancer and she
 9          certainly didn't die of lung cancer.
10                Ask yourself why Mr. Barbanell did not
11          bring any of these doctors to testify.
12                MR. HAMMER:  Judge, objection as to what
13          witnesses that weren't called said.
14                THE COURT:  Sustained.
15                MR. HAMMER:  They never heard that
16          evidence.
17                MR. GERAGHTY:  This simply demonstrates
18          what I've just been telling you for the last
19          five minutes.  Who had more information?
20          You've got Dr. Feingold, Dr. Storch, and
21          Dr. Dollinger.  We know what they had.
22                Dr. Mascarenhas, Dr. Frankel, Dr. Towbin,
23          they had all the records, including the
24          pathology, the pathology report, Dr. Towbin,
25          the liver specialist records, the liver

 1          function studies, the blood tests, the records  2          of the hospitalizations, they had all that
 3          information.
 4                The truth is, the only way the plaintiff
 5          and the plaintiff's experts are able to tell
 6          you that Shirley Barbanell died from lung
 7          cancer is by rewriting the rules on how cancer
 8          is diagnosed.  Rewriting the rules.
 9                This is the slide that Dr. Feingold told
10          you he prepared in a presentation he gave to
11          lawyers.  And I showed him this slide during
12          cross-examination.
13                Dr. Feingold agreed -- he admitted that
14          the standard to diagnose cancer in a courtroom
15          is the same as in a hospital, in the real
16          world.  Dr. Feingold admitted you need a biopsy
17          to diagnose cancer.
18                Dr. Dollinger, the other expert for the
19          plaintiff, what did he tell you?
20                MR. HAMMER:  Judge, objection because
21          that was an objection --
22                THE COURT:  Overruled.
23                MR. HAMMER:  -- at the time, and it was
24          sustained during the testimony.
25                THE COURT:  Overruled.

 1                Folks, step into the jury room, please.
 2                Stand up when the jury stands, please.
 3               (Whereupon, the following proceedings
 4          were had outside the hearing of the jury:)
 5                THE COURT:  Sit down.
 6                It is a violation of courtroom procedure
 7          to argue evidence in an objection.  If you
 8          believe that a lawyer is not properly arguing
 9          the evidence, you have an opportunity to
10          respond in rebuttal.  Don't do it again.  Just
11          as I told Mr. Geraghty not to do it.
12                MR. HAMMER:  Except, Judge, for the
13          record --
14                THE COURT:  Bring the jury out.
15                MR. HAMMER:  Can I make a record, please?
16                THE COURT:  Bring the jury out.
17                THE BAILIFF:  Jurors entering.
18               (Whereupon, the following proceedings
19          were had within the hearing of the jury:)
20                THE COURT:  Go ahead, Mr. Geraghty.
21                MR. GERAGHTY:  You heard from
22          Dr. Dollinger, the plaintiff's other cancer
23          expert testify, as well.  He told you what
24          information he needs when he has a patient who
25          asks him for a second opinion about their

 1          diagnosis of cancer.
 2                And on his website, he says he needs
 3          medical records, discharge summaries, blood
 4          tests, x-rays, CT and MRI scans and pathology
 5          reports, just to name a few.
 6                And what you now know is that when it
 7          comes to Shirley Barbanell, Dr. Feingold and
 8          Dr. Dollinger did not have most of the
 9          information that they have told you they would
10          need to arrive at an appropriate diagnosis.
11                They don't have her medical records, they
12          don't have her blood tests, they've never seen 13          the results of the biopsy, yet they tell you
14          Shirley Barbanell has lung cancer based on two
15          things:  One, because she smoked for 40 or 50
16          years; and, two, because there was a mass found
17          in her right lung that is suspicious for
18          cancer.
19                Those opinions violate what they
20          acknowledge is the clear and unequivocal
21          standard for diagnosing cancer in every
22          hospital in this country.
23                One of you asked a very probing question
24          of Dr. Blaustein just last Thursday, Thursday.
25          The question was whether all patients enrolled

 1          in research studies at Mount Sinai Hospital
 2          must have a biopsy showing that they have
 3          cancer.
 4                And Dr. Blaustein told you, not only does
 5          every patient enrolled in a research study have
 6          to have a pathological diagnosis from Mount
 7          Sinai, they also send the slides out to the
 8          National Cancer Institute to have them look at
 9          it, too, and for them to confirm that
10          diagnosis.
11                If you need a biopsy to participate in
12          medical research, then you need a biopsy in
13          this courtroom.  It's just that simple.  When
14          it comes to cancer, you can have a definitive
15          answer.  You can have a definitive answer, and
16          the biopsy is a definitive answer.
17                Doctors don't guess whether a patient has
18          cancer.  They order a biopsy so they know for
19          sure.  That's how they know for sure.
20                The plaintiff relies primarily upon the
21          interpretation of that March 25, 1996, CT scan,
22          which you saw Mr. Hammer put on the screen, and
23          Dr. Storch's testimony.  That's what they rely
24          upon.
25                I told you during opening statement that

 1          you would hear lots of testimony about how
 2          cancer is diagnosed, about this concept of a
 3          treatment team in medicine, and the different
 4          roles that doctors play in the diagnosis,
 5          treatment and care of patients.
 6                And the testimony on those issues has
 7          been unanimous in this case.  All the doctors
 8          agree, all the doctors agree, you need a biopsy
 9          to diagnose cancer.  All the doctors agree you
10          cannot treat a patient for cancer without a
11          biopsy.
12                Radiologists do not diagnose cancer.  And
13          why not?  That's because everyone agrees the CT
14          scan cannot tell you what a mass is.  It can't
15          tell you what that mass in the lung is.
16                Radiologists don't treat patients.  In
17          fact, you heard they don't meet the patients in
18          many instances.
19                And, finally, the radiologists simply do
20          not have the clinical information of the
21          patient.  The clinical information necessary to
22          arrive at a proper diagnosis.
23                The radiologist has only one piece of the 24          puzzle, one piece of information from which you
25          now know is a large body of information.

 1                Dr. Mascarenhas told you that there was
 2          a, quote, world of difference between what he
 3          knew about Shirley Barbanell in 1996, and what
 4          the radiologists who were looking at these
 5          scans knew about her.
 6                He told you that the diagnosis must be
 7          based on the, quote, total picture; and, as
 8          you've now heard, none of the radiologists had
 9          that total picture.  None of them.
10                Let's talk about the evidence the
11          plaintiff lacks in this case, the evidence the
12          plaintiff lacks to prove that Shirley Barbanell
13          had cancer.  No biopsy of the lungs.  The
14          evidence shows that the liver biopsy was
15          negative.  There was no spread of cancer to the
16          brain, the bones, or the adrenal glands in
17          Shirley Barbanell.
18                You heard the testimony of Dr. Blaustein.
19          He told you small cell lung cancer, if it was
20          small cell lung cancer, is highly aggressive;
21          and if it spreads, as the plaintiff has told
22          you, it's going to spread also to the brain,
23          the bones, and the adrenal glands; and you know
24          from seeing all these radiology reports there
25          was no spread of cancer to any of these organs

 1          in Shirley Barbanell.
 2                What else do you know?  You know that
 3          Dr. Mascarenhas never referred Shirley
 4          Barbanell to an oncologist because she didn't
 5          have cancer.  She was never treated for cancer.
 6                And what you also know is Dr. Mascarenhas
 7          came into this courtroom, sat in that witness
 8          stand, and under oath told you if Shirley
 9          Barbanell had lung cancer, I would have written
10          "lung cancer" on the death certificate.  That's
11          what I would have written.  He told you that
12          right here just last week.
13                Now, in this case, the plaintiff hasn't
14          even explained to you how the lung mass or the
15          emphysema caused Shirley Barbanell's death.
16          Search your notes.  You've had no explanation
17          of that, none whatsoever.
18                Now, the plaintiff has spent a lot of
19          time during this trial focusing on words or
20          phrases from a variety of different radiology
21          reports where the radiologist or the ultrasound
22          technician wrote "suspicious for lung cancer,"
23          "possible lung cancer," "favored to represent a
24          neoplasm."  This is what they tell you is the
25          evidence of lung cancer.

 1                The reality is, you now know that Shirley
 2          Barbanell's doctors were investigating the
 3          possibility that she had lung cancer.
 4          Absolutely, they were.  But investigating the
 5          possibility that someone has cancer is not the
 6          same as a diagnosis.
 7                And let me walk through the medical
 8          records to show you what I mean by that.  9          You've seen this record before.  You remember
10          now that the first time this mass was ever seen
11          in Shirley Barbanell's lung was the February
12          8th, 1996, CT scan of the thorax.  It was
13          ordered by Dr. Mascarenhas, it was read by a
14          Dr. Puller, and Dr. Puller writes that there is
15          a mass in the lung, there is a large soft
16          tissue mass, this is favored to represent a
17          neoplasm.
18                And you heard a lot of talk about what
19          the word "neoplasm" means.  Dr. Feingold,
20          Dr. Mascarenhas, Dr. DePrima, Dr. Blaustein,
21          all told you it means new growth, but it
22          doesn't necessarily mean cancer.  Of course,
23          the most worrisome thing that it might be is,
24          in fact, cancer of the lung, and that's why
25          Dr. Mascarenhas was so concerned that he --

 1          hopefully you can see that, but, you know, he
 2          wrote in the very bottom that he spoke to the
 3          patient, Shirley Barbanell, he told her about
 4          these results, and he faxed this report to
 5          Dr. Frankel, the pulmonologist, the lung
 6          specialist.
 7                Now, in addition to the mass in the lung,
 8          you'll recall that Dr. Puller also sees an
 9          abnormality in Shirley Barbanell's liver, which
10          he suspects is a cyst, and he orders an
11          ultrasound.  He orders an ultrasound.
12                And you know that Dr. Mascarenhas
13          followed that suggestion and ordered an
14          ultrasound.  He ordered the ultrasound.
15                Now, this is the record prepared by Tammy
16          Blanc.  She called it a "tech sheet."  And she
17          clearly wrote on there, HX, for history, lung
18          cancer.
19                I am sure Ms. Blanc is good at her job,
20          and I'm sure she would have no reason not to
21          tell you the truth; but I want you to think
22          about her testimony when you deliberate.
23                Ms. Blanc told you she's not a doctor,
24          she's not a radiologist, she does not diagnose
25          patients.  She also told you that she could not

 1          remember Mrs. Barbanell at all, and she had no
 2          memory of performing this particular study 13
 3          years ago.  Ms. Blanc was unequivocal that she
 4          has no recollection of how she got this
 5          reference, HX lung CA.
 6                Dr. Mascarenhas, as you now know, did not
 7          diagnose Shirley Barbanell with lung cancer at
 8          this point in time, and he told you this was
 9          probably a mistake.
10                For all we know, Shirley told Ms. Blanc
11          that she believed she had lung cancer because
12          you saw from the record just two weeks earlier,
13          Dr. Mascarenhas told her about the results of
14          this study.
15                You should also bear in mind what the
16          radiologist who looked at the very same
17          ultrasound said.  This is the ultrasound study
18          report from the very same ultrasound read by
19          Tammy Blanc.  It was read by a Dr. Eisenberg. 20                And he wrote, there are numerous areas of
21          decreased echogenicity within both lobes of the
22          liver, which given the patient's possible lung
23          cancer are suspicious for hepatic metastasis.
24          And you now know "hepatic" is another word for
25          liver.  And he says, dedicated CT scan of the

 1          liver is suggested.
 2                If Mrs. Barbanell had been diagnosed with
 3          lung cancer as of the date of this report, why
 4          is Dr. Eisenberg writing "possible lung
 5          cancer"?
 6                And we know from Ms. Blanc's testimony
 7          that when Dr. Eisenberg wrote that report, he
 8          had her tech sheet, he had her sheet with
 9          everything she wrote down on that.
10                Now, Dr. Mascarenhas, again, follows
11          Dr. Eisenberg's suggestion, and he has a CT
12          scan of the abdomen, which shows the liver,
13          that's done on February the 27th, 1996, and in
14          handwriting it does say, DX, diagnosis, R,
15          slash, O mets to liver.  Rule out mets to
16          liver.
17                This liver CT scan, this abdomen CT scan
18          was read by another radiologist, a Dr. Conn.
19          And Dr. Conn writes, under his impression,
20          enlarged liver with at least and/or two
21          defects, but the multiple lesions seen on
22          ultrasound are difficult to identify.
23          Follow-up studies suggested.
24                And right after this, you know that
25          Dr. Mascarenhas did exactly what plaintiff's

 1          own experts, and, frankly, Mr. Hammer, himself,
 2          have told you, you would need to do to
 3          determine whether Shirley Barbanell has lung
 4          cancer.  He orders a biopsy.
 5                In plaintiff's opening statement,
 6          Mr. Hammer told you the purpose of that biopsy
 7          was -- the reason they did the biopsy was to
 8          rule out lung cancer.
 9                So, the question is, the biopsy was
10          performed to rule out lung cancer because it
11          was a suspicion that she had lung cancer.  That
12          was Mr. Hammer two weeks ago today right before
13          you telling you there was a suspicion she had
14          lung cancer as of March the 8th.
15                He's told you for an hour this morning
16          that they had already diagnosed her with lung
17          cancer.  You know that's not the evidence in
18          this case.
19                Now, here's the biopsy report.  You've
20          seen this biopsy report many times.  It was
21          ordered by Dr. Mascarenhas.  It very clearly
22          says at the top, reason for exam, R, slash, O,
23          mets, comma, lung CA; meaning, rule out that
24          lung cancer has metastasized or spread from the
25          lung to the liver.

 1                Now, again, plaintiff wants you to
 2          believe that because the word "lung cancer"
 3          appears on here, that Mrs. Barbanell was
 4          already diagnosed with lung cancer.  Well, two  5          weeks ago, Mr. Hammer told you that wasn't the
 6          case.  Just two weeks ago.  There was a concern
 7          that Mrs. Barbanell has cancer, and that's why
 8          this biopsy is being done.
 9                Now, it is undisputed, undisputed that
10          this -- the report, the report of the
11          pathologist who would have received these
12          tissue samples would have been sent to
13          Dr. Mascarenhas within a few days, within a few
14          days after the biopsy was conducted.
15                Plaintiff doesn't dispute that, but what
16          plaintiff has tried to suggest to you is that
17          somehow when they did the biopsy, they didn't
18          actually hit the right spot, they didn't
19          actually get a sample of the disease process.
20                Why do you think they've been suggesting
21          that to you throughout this trial?  Because, as
22          you saw, Mr. Hammer knows, his experts know,
23          that's the key to this case.  That biopsy is
24          the key to this case.
25                Rather than speculate about whether the

 1          biopsy was done appropriately, they could have
 2          brought the radiologist, Dr. Kozlowski, they
 3          could have brought him in here if they really
 4          believed that Dr. Kozlowski was going to tell
 5          you, I missed the spot, I missed the spot.
 6                Now, you heard testimony from both
 7          Dr. Blaustein and Dr. DePrima that the
 8          likelihood -- the likelihood that they would
 9          have missed the disease in Shirley Barbanell's
10          liver was, quote, extremely unlikely, extremely
11          unlikely.
12                And why is that?  That's because you know
13          that her liver was filled with disease,
14          widespread disease throughout her liver.  What
15          Dr. --
16                Let's go back and show you real quickly.
17                What Dr. Eisenberg said was numerous
18          areas, numerous areas.
19                Dr. DePrima showed you this.  This is the
20          March 25, 1996, CT scan.  Two weeks after the
21          ultrasound.
22                See, here we are, March 25, 1996.
23          Dr. DePrima showed this to you, and he said
24          this shows a diffuse disease process throughout
25          the liver.  He pointed to the alternating light

 1          and dark areas, because there was contrast
 2          used.
 3                So, the difference between the light and
 4          the dark areas is what he called the scarring
 5          alternating with the regenerating nodules.
 6                So, throughout the liver, you have normal
 7          tissue surrounded by diseased tissue, all
 8          throughout the liver, covering the entire
 9          liver.
10                Ladies and gentleman, on March the 8th,
11          they didn't miss the disease in Shirley
12          Barbanell's liver with that ultrasound.  They
13          didn't miss it.  There's no evidence of that in
14          this case.
15                What happens next is telling.  Two weeks 16          after that biopsy, long after Dr. Mascarenhas
17          would have had the results of the biopsy,
18          Dr. Mascarenhas orders a CT scan of the chest
19          on March the 20, 1996.  This is the patient
20          referral authorization form, which you've seen
21          several times.
22                Dr. Mascarenhas' office wrote as
23          diagnosis, neoplasms of unspecified nature.
24          Dr. Mascarenhas, again, told you unequivocally
25          from that witness stand that if Shirley

 1          Barbanell had lung cancer, he would have
 2          written "lung cancer."  He would have told his
 3          assistant to write "lung cancer" on this form.
 4          You heard, there is an ICD code for lung
 5          cancer.
 6                And, as you also heard, that if he had
 7          diagnosed her with lung cancer, Dr. Mascarenhas
 8          would have written "lung cancer," not "lung
 9          mass" on the death certificate.
10                But Dr. Mascarenhas didn't stop there, he
11          told you if the biopsy had shown cancer,
12          Shirley would have been referred to an
13          oncologist, the type of doctor who treats
14          patients.
15                Remember, Dr. Mascarenhas told you he has
16          an elderly patient population.  He often has
17          patients who are diagnosed with cancer; and
18          when that happens, he refers them to an
19          oncologist.  There is no reference to an
20          oncologist playing any role in Shirley
21          Barbanell's care and treatment.
22                In fact, after all the CT scans and the
23          biopsy that we've just now walked through, you
24          know that Shirley Barbanell was treated by a
25          doctor named Bradley Towbin, a

 1          gastroenterologist who treats liver cirrhosis.
 2                Here's a requisition form, it shows the
 3          ordering doctor, Dr. Towbin, the attending
 4          doctor, Dr. Mascarenhas.
 5                You know that on March the 28th, Shirley
 6          Barbanell is admitted to the hospital, to
 7          Florida Medical Center.  During that hospital
 8          stay, she's cared for by both Dr. Mascarenhas
 9          and Dr. Towbin; and we know that because
10          Dr. Towbin's name appears on many of the
11          records in those last two hospitalizations.
12          The few records we have, his name is on a
13          number of them.
14                From this point forward, all the
15          evidence, all the evidence points to Shirley's
16          problem being the disease process in her
17          abdomen, in her belly, the liver, liver
18          cirrhosis.
19                Dr. Mascarenhas told you from this point
20          forward, the focus was on her liver, and that's
21          underscored by the fact that we see Dr. Towbin
22          running and ordering many of the tests and
23          procedures to find out what is going on in
24          Shirley Barbanell's liver and belly.
25                What is also significant is that there is
2775  1          no mention of the pulmonologist, Dr. Frankel,
 2          in any of the records we have from those
 3          hospitalizations in March and April of 1996.
 4                Dr. Mascarenhas told you that if a lung
 5          specialist was needed, he would have called him
 6          in.  And what does that tell you?  That tells
 7          you that Dr. Mascarenhas was right, that
 8          nothing going on in Shirley Barbanell's lungs
 9          in March and April had anything to do with what
10          caused her death.
11                Let's talk about the evidence supporting
12          the final diagnosis of liver cirrhosis.
13          Plaintiff denies that Shirley Barbanell had
14          liver cirrhosis.  Plaintiff wants you to ignore
15          all the information that Dr. Mascarenhas had in
16          March and April 1996, the input of the liver
17          specialist, Dr. Towbin, the results of the
18          blood work and the liver panel studies, which
19          you now know tell the doctors how Shirley
20          Barbanell's liver would have been functioning.
21                Plaintiff wants you to ignore the fact
22          that Dr. Mascarenhas has treated hundreds of
23          patients for cirrhosis in his home country of
24          India, where, unfortunately, cirrhosis is a
25          very common disease.

 1                Dr. Mascarenhas told you he had hundreds,
 2          if not thousands, of pages of medical records
 3          showing Shirley Barbanell's conditions, her
 4          signs and symptoms in the last month of her
 5          life.
 6                The truth is, there is plenty of evidence
 7          of cirrhosis in the 34 pages of medical records
 8          we have left and the films we have, and let's
 9          talk about that for a few minutes.
10                I showed you this same slide in a board
11          form in opening statement.  These were the
12          signs and symptoms of liver cirrhosis.
13                One of the conditions Shirley Barbanell's
14          doctors were focused on is something called
15          ascites, which you all know now is simply an
16          abnormal accumulation of fluid in the abdomen
17          in the belly.
18                And you know the doctors found ascites in
19          Shirley Barbanell.  Dr. DePrima showed you
20          several examples of the ascites in the
21          March 25, 1996, CT scans.
22                The ascites are the darkened areas, here,
23          here, here along the top, that's all ascites.
24          That's a buildup of fluid that shouldn't be
25          there.

 1                This is, again, March 25, 1996, this is
 2          her liver; and then if you go down
 3          two centimeters, you drop down now from 24 to
 4          26, ascites, ascites, ascites.  Dr. DePrima
 5          showed you the ascites.  He showed it to you.
 6          You can see it with your own eyes.
 7                Remember, Dr. Blaustein testified that
 8          ascites is not caused by cancer spreading to
 9          the liver.  He told you that.
10                The plaintiff doesn't deny that Shirley
11          Barbanell had ascites, but what the plaintiff 12          wants to focus you on is that in the records it
13          says she had either, quote, minimal ascites or
14          very mild ascites, and that because of that,
15          the disease process could not have been
16          cirrhosis.
17                But keep two things in mind:  First,
18          remember that the ascites was removed during a
19          procedure called a paracentesis in March, what
20          the doctors referred to as a diagnostic
21          peritoneal tap.  So, much of the ascites was
22          removed, but it was found again later on April
23          the 12th.
24                And, second, remember the testimony of
25          Dr. Blaustein, Dr. Mascarenhas, and

 1          Dr. DePrima.  They all told you that many
 2          end-stage cirrhosis patients are only going to
 3          have minimal ascites.
 4                And why is that?  Because at the end
 5          stage of the disease process, many cirrhosis
 6          patients are not eating, and they're not
 7          drinking, so their body is not generating any
 8          fluid to cause the ascites.
 9                You also heard reference in several of
10          the records that Shirley Barbanell had an
11          enlarged liver with an irregular and wavy
12          border.  You saw that during Dr. DePrima's
13          testimony.  Again, this is consistent with
14          cirrhosis, and it was seen by several of the
15          radiologists.
16                You also know that Shirley Barbanell had
17          an enlarged spleen, an enlarged spleen.  The
18          testimony you saw was that it was measured in
19          February 1996, as 15 centimeters.
20          Fifteen centimeters.
21                A normal size spleen is about half that
22          size.  Eight to 10 centimeters.
23                And you heard that an enlarged spleen is
24          caused by portal hypertension, when the
25          liver -- when there's pressure in the liver and

 1          the liver backs up, fluid builds up in the
 2          spleen.
 3                There's no dispute that an enlarged
 4          spleen is not caused by cancer, that it's
 5          caused by cirrhosis.  You haven't heard any
 6          testimony to contradict that.
 7                The Swiss cheese appearance, Dr. DePrima
 8          showed this to you.  He said that when you have
 9          a diffuse, widespread disease throughout the
10          liver, it's going to have a Swiss cheese
11          appearance because there is going to be disease
12          throughout the liver.
13                Now, this is the ultrasound, so this is
14          actually right up against the liver, so you
15          don't see the entire liver, but in every shot,
16          every shot you see this Swiss cheese-like
17          appearance, all throughout the liver, all here,
18          showing just what I showed you on the CT scan,
19          that the liver was filled with this scarring
20          and regenerating nodules throughout.  It's
21          consistent with cirrhosis of the liver.
22                Shirley Barbanell also had something 23          called varices.  You heard testimony about
24          that.  Varices are simply swollen blood vessels
25          in the esophagus and stomach.

 1                Dr. DePrima showed you these swollen
 2          blood vessels, varices.  You've heard them
 3          referred to as "varicose veins."
 4                And what Dr. DePrima, and Dr. Blaustein
 5          and Dr. Mascarenhas told you was that it takes
 6          years for this process to occur, because it's
 7          pressure in the liver; and because of the
 8          pressure, the blood can't travel through the
 9          portal vein, through the hepatic vein, so it
10          looks for alternative routes around the liver,
11          and that's why you have these enlarged veins in
12          and around the stomach and the esophagus.
13                Dr. Blaustein, Dr. DePrima,
14          Dr. Mascarenhas all told you that the varices,
15          the ascites, the enlarged spleen are all caused
16          by portal hypertension, and you've heard no
17          testimony to dispute that.
18                Now, the plaintiff is going to tell you
19          there's no way she could have had cirrhosis
20          because cirrhosis takes years to form and there
21          was no evidence of cirrhosis as far back as
22          1994.
23                Well, you heard Dr. DePrima address that
24          particular issue.  You know the evidence now
25          proves that that's simply not true.

 1                This is the same board, although, it's a
 2          lot clearer than what we used in the opening,
 3          but this shows you Shirley Barbanell's liver
 4          from the May 1994 CT scan, in comparison to the
 5          March 25, 1996, CT scan.
 6                This is 21 months, 21 months before the
 7          mass was ever found in Shirley Barbanell's
 8          lung.  And Dr. DePrima told you already in
 9          May '94, 21 months earlier, you can see the
10          irregular border of the liver and an
11          enlargement of the liver.
12                And if you fast-forward 21 months, look
13          how that same area, the irregularity -- the
14          irregularity, the enlargement and the wavy,
15          bumpy border is more pronounced in the very
16          same areas where you see it 21 months earlier.
17                You can see it with your own eyes, ladies
18          and gentleman.  The cirrhosis was there for
19          years.
20                THE CLERK:  Counsel, 30-minute warning.
21                MR. GERAGHTY:  And that's consistent --
22          now, that's consistent with cirrhosis, because
23          as the doctors all told you, including
24          Dr. Dollinger, cirrhosis will progress for a
25          long time undetected in the body before the

 1          patient ever sees signs or symptoms.
 2                Dr. Mascarenhas told you that, cirrhosis
 3          has to destroy 90 percent of the liver before
 4          you will begin to see the signs and symptoms of
 5          cirrhosis.
 6                Now, plaintiff also tried to suggest to
 7          you that there's no way Shirley Barbanell had  8          cirrhosis because she wasn't an alcoholic, and
 9          we have no records that showed she had
10          hepatitis.
11                Well, what plaintiff failed to tell you
12          was that his own doctor, Dr. Dollinger, and
13          Dr. Blaustein, told you about something called
14          cryptogenic cirrhosis.
15                "Cryptogenic" simply meaning there's no
16          known cause of the cirrhosis.
17                And what did you hear from Dr. Dollinger
18          and Dr. Blaustein?  This occurs very commonly
19          in elderly women, in elderly women who have
20          diabetes.  Shirley Barbanell was 72 years old,
21          and you now know that she had diabetes.
22                Let's talk about plaintiff's claim.
23          Let's switch gears and talk about plaintiff's
24          claim that Mrs. Barbanell died from emphysema,
25          a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary

 1          disease.  That's what the verdict form is
 2          asking you to determine.
 3                I think I heard Mr. Hammer use the word
 4          "emphysema" once in his entire presentation.
 5          Emphysema, a form of COPD.
 6                Now, I want to be clear about what the
 7          plaintiff is claiming in this case, and what
 8          you are going to be asked to decide on this
 9          verdict form.
10                Plaintiff is claiming that Shirley
11          Barbanell had emphysema, not chronic
12          bronchitis, which is the other form of COPD.
13                Remember in opening statement, Mr. Hammer
14          told you, and you'll hear, that she had
15          emphysema, which is a form of COPD.  That's
16          what the plaintiff told you in opening.
17                You heard from Dr. Feingold -- this is on
18          cross-examination -- Dr. Feingold, you
19          testified that you believe that Mrs. Barbanell
20          had a particular type of COPD or form of COPD
21          called emphysema; right?
22                Yes, sir.
23                Question:  And you're not here to say
24          that Shirley Barbanell had any other kind of
25          COPD; correct?

 1                Correct.
 2                That's what you heard from Mr. Hammer and
 3          from Dr. Feingold.
 4                Now, you also heard that there are two
 5          different types of COPD.  There's chronic
 6          bronchitis and there's emphysema; and you heard
 7          that from both of the pulmonologists,
 8          Dr. Feingold and from Dr. Brodnan.
 9                And look at what the verdict form is
10          asking you to decide.  Emphysema, a form of
11          COPD.  That's the evidence that's been
12          presented to you in this case.
13                So, the questions you're going to have to
14          decide is, did Shirley Barbanell die from
15          emphysema, did she have emphysema.
16                Let's talk about the evidence you've
17          heard.  You've seen now many times this report
18          from Dr. Schwartz, from January 1991, up here 19          on the screen.  Plaintiff showed it to you
20          several times.
21                Now, what you never were shown by the
22          plaintiff is that at the very top of this
23          document, Dr. Schwartz says that Shirley
24          Barbanell reported to him a history of chronic
25          bronchitis.  A history of chronic bronchitis.

 1                And this was when Dr. Mascarenhas
 2          referred Shirley to Dr. Schwartz, when her
 3          shortness of breath was becoming more
 4          pronounced.
 5                Mr. Hammer didn't focus you on this part
 6          of the record because he knows it contradicts
 7          the plaintiff's claim that Shirley Barbanell
 8          had emphysema.  He knows that Dr. Mascarenhas
 9          had this record, that he had this record, and
10          it explains why Dr. Mascarenhas put "COPD" on
11          the death certificate, because Dr. Schwartz
12          said she had chronic bronchitis.
13                Remember when Mr. Hammer cross-examined
14          Dr. Mascarenhas?  He asked him lots and lots
15          and lots of questions.  He asked him if he
16          thought Shirley had COPD, but he never asked
17          him if she had emphysema.  He never asked him
18          that question.
19                Dr. Mascarenhas based his diagnosis of
20          COPD on the fact that in this record,
21          Dr. Schwartz diagnosed her with chronic
22          bronchitis.
23                As for COPD, Dr. Mascarenhas was clear on
24          both direct examination and cross-examination,
25          that while he included COPD as a contributing

 1          condition on the death certificate, COPD did
 2          not cause Mrs. Barbanell death.
 3                I asked him first, let me ask you this:
 4          Did the COPD, which you wrote down, did that
 5          cause Shirley Barbanell's death?
 6                Answer:  No, it did not.
 7                And then, Mr. Hammer asked a second
 8          question:  So, then would you agree, sir, that
 9          Shirley Barbanell died secondary to lung cancer
10          and COPD?
11                No, that was not the cause of death.  The
12          disease entity that caused her death was liver
13          cirrhosis with ascites.
14                In fact, the only doctor who claims
15          Mrs. Barbanell had emphysema is Dr. Feingold.
16          Four different radiologists over the course of
17          a five-year period, Dr. Hantman, Dr. Puller,
18          Dr. Greenhouse, and Dr. Storch looked at chest
19          x-rays and CT scans of Shirley Barbanell, and
20          not one of those doctors saw any evidence of
21          emphysema in any of those scans.
22                Dr. Storch and Dr. DePrima told you that
23          a radiologist can see emphysema on a CT scan,
24          and it's their job, if they see it, to note it
25          on the report.  But you know that Dr. Storch

 1          said that he never saw it.
 2                In examining the CT scan on Shirley
 3          Barbanell, you did not see any evidence of  4          emphysema, did you?
 5                Answer:  No.
 6                If you would have seen emphysema, you
 7          would have remarked on it in your report of
 8          March 25, 1996; correct?
 9                Answer:  Yes.
10                What these doctors did see was
11          interstitial lung markings, a sign of
12          interstitial lung disease.
13                As you heard from Dr. Brodnan,
14          interstitial lung disease causes shortness of
15          breath, but it's not caused by cigarette
16          smoking.  It is a restrictive disease, which is
17          the exact opposite of COPD, a chronic
18          obstructive disease.
19                Dr. Schwartz suspected that Shirley
20          Barbanell had interstitial lung disease in
21          1991.  This is a little tough to read, I think;
22          but this is the last page of Dr. Schwartz's
23          consult.
24                In his impression he writes, one, chronic
25          bronchitis by history, which we've just talked

 1          about; two, probable -- or excuse me --
 2          progressive shortness of breath, rule out
 3          interstitial lung disease, questionable,
 4          idiopathic versus secondary to vasculitis,
 5          question mark, pulmonary hypertension, question
 6          mark, chronic aspiration, question mark,
 7          history of hiatal hernia.
 8                And then in his recommendations, he
 9          writes, one, need to see pulmonary function
10          tests.  Particular attention will be given to
11          evidence of restrictive lung disease, decreased
12          lung volumes with low diffusing capacity.
13          That's what Dr. Schwartz wrote in January 1991.
14                And what did the radiologists have to
15          say?  Same date, January 9, 1991, Dr. Storch,
16          chest x-ray:  There is diffuse interstitial
17          lung disease, no evidence of emphysema.
18                April 29th, 1994, Dr. Greenhouse, there
19          is interstitial changes in both lung fields.
20          No evidence of emphysema.
21                February 8th, 1996, this is Dr. Puller.
22          There is also some increased interstitial
23          markings at both lung bases which could be a
24          reflection of some chronic fibrosis.  No
25          evidence of emphysema.

 1                You should ask yourselves how none of
 2          these doctors see emphysema, but somehow, 13
 3          years later, Dr. Feingold does.
 4                Dr. Feingold made a lot of excuses about
 5          the fact that the copies of the films he
 6          originally looked at were difficult to read.
 7          He, in fact, told you he saw more evidence of
 8          emphysema in the copies he first looked at
 9          compared to the originals.
10                He also told you that the first time he
11          looked at the films, he saw that Mrs. Barbanell
12          had breast implants.  Dr. Feingold is the only
13          doctor who said Shirley Barbanell had breast
14          implants, and he's the only doctor who says she 15          has emphysema.
16                The truth is, Shirley Barbanell never had
17          breast implants, and she never had emphysema.
18          But when you earn $2.7 million a year, and you
19          refer to yourself as a, quote, world-famous
20          expert who testifies all around the country,
21          well, I guess you can see emphysema when no one
22          else can.
23                What even Dr. Feingold could not deny is
24          that Mrs. Barbanell had a pulmonary function
25          test designed to determine whether she had

 1          emphysema just nine months before she died in
 2          July 1995.
 3                You saw that, and you saw that Shirley
 4          Barbanell's FEV1, FVC value was 76.  Well
 5          within the range of normal, just nine months
 6          before she passed away.
 7                Now, Dr. Feingold tried to tell you this
 8          test was unreliable because it used a nitrogen
 9          washout method.
10                Well, you heard Dr. Brodnan address that.
11          He told you the nitrogen washout method is the
12          most common method used to conduct a pulmonary
13          function test.  He told you this test was
14          performed properly.
15                He also told you about the nitrogen
16          washout method; and he said so long as the
17          washout time is less than seven minutes, and
18          for Shirley Barbanell it was 3.3, the test is
19          completely valid.  Completely valid.
20                Search the 34 pages of medical records we
21          have.  The word "emphysema" appears only once.
22          It appears only once in that January 10, 1991,
23          record by Dr. Schwartz, where Shirley told him
24          she had never been told she has asthma or
25          emphysema despite a long smoking history.

 1                Now, I want to switch gears and talk
 2          about Questions 3 and 4 on the verdict form.  I
 3          went over those before, so I won't go over them
 4          again; but the key issue is for you to answer
 5          these questions is, did Shirley Barbanell know
 6          or should she have known that there was a
 7          reasonable possibility that cigarette smoking
 8          was causing an injury to her, was harming her
 9          health.
10                And the evidence you've heard is that the
11          one symptom that she reported consistently was
12          shortness of breath, and to answer this
13          question -- to answer these two questions, you
14          need to look no further than the testimony of
15          Karen Siegel, her only daughter, and the
16          testimony of her husband, Leon Barbanell.
17                Both Karen and Leon told you that Shirley
18          Barbanell had been suffering from shortness of
19          breath for many years prior to 1990, and that
20          they all associated the shortness of breath
21          with her cigarette smoking.  Remember that we
22          read a few short passages of Karen's testimony
23          to you earlier in the trial.
24                Karen was born in 1948, and she testified
25          in the deposition that by the time she was in 2792
 1          high school, her mother was telling her that
 2          cigarette smoking was harming her health.  From
 3          the time I was in high school and past high
 4          school, she was very, very aware that her
 5          smoking was causing serious problems to her
 6          health from my high school years on.
 7                She went on, I heard it -- should be from
 8          the time I was very, very young.  She was aware
 9          that smoking was making her sick.  She knew it.
10                Now, you never saw Karen in person.  The
11          plaintiff didn't bring Shirley's only daughter
12          to testify in her case.  And after hearing that
13          testimony from the deposition, is there any
14          question in your mind why?  Because Karen said
15          Shirley was suffering from shortness of breath
16          in the 1960's, and believed it was caused by
17          her cigarette smoking.
18                You also heard from Mr. Leon Barbanell,
19          and we played a portion videotape deposition on
20          this screen.
21                And this is Mr. Barbanell's testimony:
22                Answer:  When she was starting to get the
23          shortness of breath, I said, hey, you know,
24          maybe smoking is not -- you need to cut it down
25          a little bit.

 1                Question:  And we're talking about 1965
 2          to 1970, when you were bugging her?
 3                Answer:  Yes.
 4                Question:  About her smoking, you were
 5          bugging her because you knew it wasn't good for
 6          her; right?
 7                Answer:  I didn't know it wasn't good for
 8          her.  I thought it might not be good for her
 9          because when she started getting a little short
10          of breath and all, I said, maybe you're smoking
11          too much.  That's it.  He went on.
12                Do you recall what caused her shortness
13          of breath initially?
14                Answer:  What caused her breath?
15                Question:  Shortness of breath.
16                Answer:  As far as I know, it was
17          cigarettes, smoking.
18                Okay.  And that's what you guys thought
19          at the time or at least you thought at the
20          time; right?
21                Answer:  That's what we figured at that
22          time, yeah.
23                That's from Mr. Barbanell.  Now, when he
24          took the stand to testify here live,
25          Mr. Barbanell said something a little bit

 1          different from that.  He told you he only
 2          remembered the shortness of breath from the
 3          time they moved to Florida in about 1982.
 4                But, ladies and gentleman, the exact year
 5          doesn't matter for purposes of the question
 6          you're being -- the questions you're being
 7          asked to decide.  All you have to determine is
 8          whether Shirley Barbanell was experiencing
 9          shortness of breath, believed she was injured
10          prior to May 5, 1990 -- May 5, 1990, and 11          whether the evidence shows that she believed
12          the shortness of breath was caused by her
13          cigarette smoking.  The evidence points to only
14          one answer, yes.
15                Now, the plaintiff may get up here and
16          suggest, well, she was never diagnosed, that's
17          absolutely true; but when you look at those
18          questions, you'll see there is nothing in there
19          about a diagnosis.  Nothing in there about a
20          diagnosis.  It's only what Mrs. Barbanell knew
21          or should have known.
22                THE CLERK:  Fifteen minutes remaining.
23                MR. GERAGHTY:  Now, I want to switch
24          gears and talk about plaintiff's claim that
25          Shirley Barbanell was addicted, and that it was

 1          her addiction to cigarettes that made Shirley
 2          smoke.
 3                In other words, did Shirley not quit
 4          earlier because of her alleged addiction, or
 5          does the evidence show that Shirley simply did
 6          not want to quit smoking?
 7                And to orient you as to how the addiction
 8          factors into the questions, let's take a look
 9          at the verdict form again.  The questions are
10          the same, Number 1 and Number 2, in terms of
11          the role addiction must play.
12                Was Shirley Barbanell addicted to
13          cigarettes containing nicotine; and, if so, was
14          such addiction a legal cause of her death?
15                And down here, it is, was addiction --
16          was she addicted, and was the addiction a legal
17          cause of either the lung cancer or the
18          emphysema.
19                Now, I'm going to get into what "legal
20          cause" means in just a moment, but let's talk
21          about the evidence you heard in the case.
22                Remember the question I asked Leon
23          Barbanell.  I asked him whether Shirley could
24          have quit smoking.  He told you honestly he
25          really didn't know because as far as he was

 1          concerned, she never really tried.  She never
 2          really tried.
 3                And remember I asked him about her level
 4          of motivation; how would you measure her
 5          motivation on a scale.  If you had a scale of
 6          motivation, and at one end of the scale is you
 7          would do anything possible to quit, and at the
 8          other end of the scale, the bottom of the
 9          scale, maybe you would try, you agree that your
10          wife is at the bottom end of the scale?
11                Answer:  At that time, yes, yeah.
12                Question:  So, she was closer to the
13          bottom of the scale of motivation?
14                Answer:  Yeah, that's right.
15                As far as her -- as far as her desire to
16          quit smoking is concerned?
17                Answer:  Right.
18                And who knew Shirley better than Leon
19          Barbanell?  He took the witness stand and he
20          told you Shirley liked to smoke cigarettes.  In
21          fact, he told you she loved to smoke 22          cigarettes.  He said she found it relaxing, she
23          liked the taste, she liked all the social
24          aspects of cigarette smoking.  She liked to
25          smoke with her girlfriends while she was

 1          playing cards.  She liked to smoke while she
 2          was on the telephone.  She liked to smoke with
 3          coffee, after a meal.
 4                Mr. Barbanell told you she enjoyed,
 5          quote, the joy of smoking.  That's what
 6          Mr. Barbanell told you.
 7                What happened when Leon nagged her to
 8          quit smoking?  Shirley said, mind your own
 9          business, you're smoking, too.  Mind your own
10          business.
11                Mr. Barbanell told you that Shirley's
12          older sister, Rose, a die-hard smoker, also
13          nagged Shirley to quit.  What did Shirley tell
14          her older sister, Rose?  Mind your own
15          business, mind your own business.
16                You heard that Karen and Faye Barbanell,
17          Shirley's sister-in-law, also nagged her to
18          quit, also nagged her to quit.
19                We know from the evidence that Shirley
20          was aware of the health risks of smoking.
21          You've seen the information about the health
22          risks, and that they were publicized to the
23          American public in the 40's, the 50's and the
24          60's.
25                You know, for those of us raised after

 1          the '64 Surgeon General's report that concluded
 2          that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer, and,
 3          frankly, that's all of us here, it would be
 4          easy to think that prior to 1964, no one had
 5          heard, no one had heard; but you've now heard
 6          the historians testify, and you know that
 7          information about the health risks of cigarette
 8          smoking was well publicized before Shirley
 9          Barbanell ever smoked a cigarette.
10                Mr. Barbanell told you from the time he
11          was a teenager, he and his friends called
12          cigarettes coffin nails, coffin nails; and
13          Mr. Barbanell told you, he knew exactly what
14          that meant.  If you smoke enough, you're going
15          to be dead.
16                Mr. Barbanell also told you -- and this
17          is in the mid-1930's.  Mr. Barbanell also told
18          you --
19                Before we even get to Shirley Barbanell
20          in here, Mr. Barbanell told you that he knew
21          that breathing fire into your lungs was not a
22          good thing to do, and he said Shirley knew it,
23          too.
24                And we know this information made its way
25          to Shirley.  Why?  Because you heard that Karen

 1          Siegel, her daughter, from the time she was
 2          very young, was having conversations with her
 3          mother about the health risks.
 4                Shirley told Leon -- Shirley, herself,
 5          told Leon, and Mr. Barbanell testified to it,
 6          that Shirley believed cigarette smoking was  7          addictive before they even got married in 1961.
 8                When the Surgeon General's report came
 9          out, and the first warnings went on cigarette
10          packs saying cigarette smoking may be hazardous
11          to your health, Mr. Barbanell testified that he
12          and his wife talked about those things, and you
13          know what he did?  He characterized that as a
14          matter-of-fact conversation.  And I asked him,
15          well, what do you mean by that?  He goes, well,
16          it's because it's something we already knew.
17          It wasn't new to them, they already knew this.
18                But, as you've heard from Mr. Barbanell,
19          Shirley was never concerned about her health.
20          She was a happy person, she didn't concern
21          herself with these things.
22                What evidence is there that Shirley
23          really wanted to quit smoking, that she made a
24          sincere effort to quit?  Because there's no
25          dispute in this case that if a smoker really

 1          wants to quit, they can.
 2                You heard that from plaintiff's own
 3          experts, Dr. Seely, and Dr. Neal Benowitz, the
 4          expert who appeared by videotape, who
 5          Mr. Hammer just told you an hour ago is a
 6          leading scientist on nicotine addiction.
 7                And what are the statistics that
 8          Dr. Benowitz told you?  As of 2009, 60 million
 9          people in this country have quit smoking.
10          Sixty million people.  That's 1.3 million per
11          year, 3,000 per day.
12                Many of those people are heavy smokers,
13          two- to three-pack-per-day smokers, just like
14          Shirley Barbanell.  And 90 percent of them quit
15          cold turkey, without any assistance whatsoever.
16                Anyone who is truly motivated to quit can
17          quit, and both those experts told you that the
18          key factor in quitting is motivation.
19          Motivation, which you now know, comes from
20          within.  The motivation comes from within.
21                This is a pamphlet, a publication from
22          the American Cancer Society, which I showed to
23          Dr. Neal Benowitz during his cross-examination,
24          and it is in evidence, it's PMU-8562, it's
25          called "Smart Move."

 1                The American Cancer Society is a leading
 2          authority on cigarette smoking and how to help
 3          people stop cigarette smoking, to quit.
 4                And according to the American Cancer
 5          Society -- I showed you this in opening --
 6          anyone can quit if they answer three simple
 7          questions.  Do you want to quit smoking?  Do
 8          you want to stop smoking?  Are you willing to
 9          make some changes in your daily routine?  And,
10          three, are you willing to put up with some
11          uneasy moments after stopping?
12                If you can answer "yes" to all three of
13          these questions, you can quit smoking according
14          to the American Cancer Society.
15                Could Shirley Barbanell have answered
16          "yes" to these three questions?  You've heard
17          the evidence.  Of course, she could.  Of 18          course, she could.
19                Could Shirley have quit if she were truly
20          motivated to do so?  Of course, she could.  But
21          you heard Leon's testimony, she wasn't
22          interested in quitting.
23                In fact, he told you despite all of his
24          nagging, in the 40 years they were married, in
25          the 40 years they were married, she tried to

 1          quit or cut down on only three occasions.
 2                She went to a hypnotist once or twice.
 3          She tried the nicotine patch for a week.  She
 4          went to a stop-smoking class one time, and she
 5          came home and told Leon, you know what, this
 6          isn't worth it, it's not for me, it's not for
 7          me.
 8                Three times in 40 years.  Now, I don't
 9          want you to think I am being critical of
10          Shirley Barbanell because she didn't quit or
11          because of a lack of effort on her part to
12          quit.  She had every right to choose to smoke.
13          In this country, we value personal
14          responsibility and self-determination above all
15          else.
16                You heard Harry Reasoner when you saw the
17          videotape of the CBS report on the Surgeon
18          General's report, he told you no one is going
19          to tell an adult not to smoke, and as of 1964,
20          no one is going to tell them it's good for them
21          either, but he said, now it comes down, the
22          decision, the choice is his or hers.
23                According to Mr. Barbanell, Shirley was
24          intelligent, strong -- strong-willed, and an
25          independent person, a person who was going to

 1          do whatever she wanted to do.
 2                Is she a smoker who was so tormented, so
 3          tortured, so desperately trying to quit that
 4          she was incapable?  That's not the evidence
 5          you've heard about Shirley Barbanell in this
 6          case.  That's not the evidence you heard.
 7                Even Mr. Hammer acknowledged in his
 8          opening statement, he characterized, he said
 9          she made choices, what he characterized as poor
10          choices.  That was his characterization, not
11          mine.  Plaintiff tells you Shirley couldn't
12          quit smoking.  But you know Shirley could, and,
13          in fact, she did.
14                January 1991, she told Dr. Schwartz one
15          month earlier she had quit smoking, that's what
16          she told Dr. Schwartz.  Now, we don't know for
17          how long she remained off cigarettes.  All we
18          know is that by January -- excuse me -- July
19          1995, when that pulmonary function test was
20          done, it said she was smoking less than a pack
21          a day.  Less than a pack a day.
22                Now, what's significant about this form
23          is, Dr. Schwartz doesn't report that Shirley
24          Barbanell had any serious withdrawal symptoms,
25          not one.

 1                And what did Mr. Barbanell tell you in 40
 2          years?  He said at most she was a little  3          fidgety, a little irritable.  What the American
 4          Cancer Society referred to as a few uneasy
 5          moments.  That's the only evidence of her
 6          having any withdrawal, you've heard, in this
 7          entire case.
 8                Was addiction the reason Shirley
 9          continued to smoke?  That's the question you're
10          being asked to determine on this verdict form.
11                And let me turn to that in the remaining
12          time that I have left.  Let's look at the
13          questions on the verdict form, and talk how
14          they relate to the instruction you're going to
15          receive on legal cause and the burden of proof
16          in this case.  Let me show you the instruction
17          you're going to receive.
18                Okay.  This is the legal cause
19          instruction from Judge Streitfeld.  Addiction
20          to cigarettes containing nicotine is a legal
21          cause of injury and death if it directly and in
22          natural sequence produced or contributed
23          substantially to producing such injury or
24          death, so that it can reasonably be said that
25          but for the alleged addiction, the loss would

 1          not have occurred.
 2                And then it goes on, in order to be
 3          regarded as a legal cause of injury and death,
 4          addiction need not be the only cause.
 5          Addiction may be a legal cause of injury and
 6          death even though it operates in combination
 7          with the act of another, some natural cause, or
 8          some other causes if such other cause occurs at
 9          the same time as the addiction, and if the
10          addiction contributes substantially to
11          producing such loss.
12                That's the instruction you're going to
13          receive.  And that's what "legal cause" means
14          when you see it in Questions 1 and 2 on the
15          verdict form.
16                So, how should you think about this?
17          Well, I think there's really two ways to think
18          about this.  If you removed "addiction," would
19          Shirley Barbanell have still smoked?
20                This board, we've put on here all the
21          reasons why you've heard in the evidence that
22          Shirley Barbanell smoked cigarettes.  We've
23          talked about the top five.  Mr. Barbanell
24          testified to those, but the plaintiff says
25          "addiction," and we've added "addiction" on

 1          here.
 2                So the question is, if you take
 3          "addiction" off this list, was Shirley
 4          Barbanell going to quit?  Did she have reasons,
 5          many reasons that have nothing to do with
 6          nicotine in cigarettes why she enjoyed smoking
 7          and why she liked to smoke cigarettes?  You've
 8          heard the evidence.
 9                And if you find that if you remove
10          "addiction" from the table, she would have
11          continued to smoke, then addiction cannot be a
12          legal cause of anything, and your answer to all
13          of these questions should be "no." 14                The other way to think about it is could
15          Shirley Barbanell have quit smoking if she
16          truly wanted to, if she were truly motivated to
17          do so?  Because if Shirley Barbanell could have
18          quit smoking at any time she made the decision,
19          at any time she was truly motivated to do so,
20          then addiction cannot be the legal cause.
21                And, again, your answers on all these
22          would be "no."  Your answer to all those
23          questions would be "no," just on the question
24          of addiction.  Because if Shirley Barbanell
25          always had it within her, and the

 1          uncontroverted evidence is motivation comes
 2          from within, if that motivation was always
 3          there, and she could have quit whenever she set
 4          her mind to do so, then addiction can't be the
 5          legal cause of death or injury.
 6                If you find that addiction didn't prevent
 7          her from quitting when she was truly motivated
 8          to do so, and that January 1991 record from
 9          Dr. Schwartz is all the evidence you need, then
10          your answer to these questions all should be
11          "no."
12                Let's look at it from one other
13          perspective.  Mr. -- Mr. Hammer alluded to it
14          very briefly, but he sort of said, well, maybe
15          there were multiple causes.
16                He sort of at the very end of his
17          presentation -- and listen to him in his
18          rebuttal, it won't surprise me if you hear,
19          well, maybe -- maybe the liver cirrhosis --
20          maybe the liver cirrhosis was one of the
21          causes, and -- but maybe the lung mass and the
22          COPD were other causes.  He may say that
23          despite denying that for two straight weeks in
24          this courtroom.
25                But if he says that, I want you to focus

 1          on this instruction.  Whatever causes, whatever
 2          things Mr. Hammer gets up here and talks to you
 3          about that he thinks contributed to Shirley
 4          Barbanell's death, every single one of those
 5          must be a substantial contributing cause.  They
 6          must contribute substantially to producing such
 7          injury or death, so that it can reasonably be
 8          said that but for the alleged addiction, but
 9          for the addiction, the loss would not have
10          occurred.
11                But for the addiction, would Shirley
12          Barbanell still be alive?  Would she have lived
13          on beyond April 1996?  That's the plaintiff's
14          burden by the greater weight of the evidence in
15          this case.
16                THE CLERK:  Time.
17                THE COURT:  You need to wrap up.
18                MR. GERAGHTY:  Okay.  Ladies and
19          gentleman, you've been here for two-and-a-half
20          weeks, it's been a long two-and-a-half weeks, I
21          know you've worked extremely hard.  Jenny Brown
22          and I thank you, I'm sure everybody thanks you
23          for your time and attention.
24                Simply put, the plaintiff has failed to 25          sustain his burden to prove by the greater

 1          weight of the evidence that Shirley Barbanell's
 2          death was caused by her addiction, her alleged
 3          addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine.
 4                The plaintiff wants you to find Philip
 5          Morris liable in this phase of the case for a
 6          death that was caused by liver cirrhosis with
 7          ascites, for a death that had nothing to do
 8          with whether she ever smoked a single
 9          cigarette.
10                I would ask you to return the only
11          verdict that's consistent with the persuasive,
12          the entire evidence you've heard, a verdict in
13          favor of Philip Morris.  This case should end
14          now at this phase.  Thank you very much for
15          your time and attention.
