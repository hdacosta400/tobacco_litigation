Okay?
Well, let me just say at the outset
suggestion to you that a whole bunch of information
and testimony you were going to receive in this case
had nothing to do with John Barbose.
And there was
this idea that you needed to have in your mind this
question of what does this have to do with John
Barbose.
that the only thing you see in this courtroom is
relevant evidence, evidence that His Honor decided
you should see because it's relevant to the case.
Anything that has nothing to do with John Barbose
doesn't ever come in this courtroom in the first
place.
remarkable how that attitude and a callous attitude
like that so perfectly sums up what the evidence has
shown in this case about the tragedy of the century
of lost lives and needless premature death, 20
million since 1964.

They knew it when this
From the beginning, you heard this case and you
heard from His Honor that this is an Engle Progeny
case, it derives from the Engle class action. So
you've heard from all of us, since the beginning of
the trial, the first question you have to answer is
was Mr. Barbose an Engle class member.
And I think
it's helpful in answering that question to just make 3616
it clear what class membership is not about, because
there has been a lot -- a lot of this trial about
fault and choice and all these other concepts,
awareness.
Class membership is not about fault or

have to answer -- and I told you this from the very
beginning, our burden of proof -- and we are happy

evidence to prove our case.
And all the evidence we
brought you is important to answering the questions
We brought you all of this 3617
on this verdict form, especially the concealment
questions, the conspiracy questions, and the
punitive damages questions.
the beginning, this is a case about punitive
damages.
You heard from His Honor that if you
answer yes to that question, there is a brief
additional phase.
Because we said from
A marathon is 26.2 miles.
You all have run 26
miles, okay?
If you answer yes on punitive damages,
you've got 0.2 to go to get to the finish line. It
will be a very brief phase.
It will probably be a
There will a little bit more evidence,
day or less.
and then you'll have the case to decide that part of
the case, too.
You've
done the 26 miles.
It's not going to be a lot.
Just a little bit more.
We would encourage you, look at the evidence in
this case and go to the punitive damages phase where
you'll have a chance to hear from some of these
representatives in this courtroom, most likely, and
answer some questions to you at that time.
But on all the other questions, our burden of
proof is the greater weight of the evidence, okay?
And this is -- you heard it in your instructions.
It means the more persuasive and convincing force
and effect of the entire evidence in the case. When you look at everything you heard over the

last three weeks or two and a half weeks, what is
the more persuasive and convincing force of all of
it?
What is greater of all that
you heard?
Did we
prove our case?
Who brought you the evidence?
What is greater?
The other very, very important part of your
instructions that I want to call your attention to
is this concept of concurring cause.
You saw it in
every single one of the instructions on legal cause.
There is this other part that says, in order to be
regarded a legal cause.
if it's the class membership question.
smoking for the second question -- whether smoking
was a legal cause.
There is concealment, there is
conspiracy.
And then there is addiction
There is
For those four questions that have that legal
cause, every single one of them has this concurring
cause section.
And what it means is, it's exactly
what -- and Dr. Hayes finally even admitted it.
Everybody has knowledge, she finally admitted it
too.
It can be both/and.
It's not either/or, okay?
It's not either/or.
There were a lot of different things that were
going on throughout the history of John Barbose and 3619
They were playing a role

So the addiction can operate in combination

That's what concurring cause means.

it in all of your instructions.
that.
It's very important.
Don't move past
So the first question you're going to have to
And the question on the
answer is class membership.
verdict form is "Was John Barbose addicted to
cigarettes containing nicotine; and, if so, was such
addiction a legal cause of his lung cancer and
death?"
Well, what this really boils down to is, was he
addicted -- first part -- and if so, was the
addiction a legal cause of lung cancer and death?
The addiction is a legal cause of his lung cancer
That's addiction causing the smoking,
and death.

You've 3620

And we'll get

start with that, because I think it's the easiest
part, okay?

were, iffy, or there was some question about that,
maybe, from opening statement.
There should be no
question that John Barbose had lung cancer, and
there should be no question that his lung cancer was
caused by a lifetime of heavy smoking.
We brought you the witnesses who sat here and
And,
who talked to you and who told you that.
again, this is a situation where it doesn't have to
be the only cause.
Even if you had some questions
or some doubts, if smoking was a substantial
contributing cause to his lung cancer, then we met
our burden of proof.
Okay?
And it's not just us that has this idea that 3621
addiction causes smoking which causes lung cancer.
It's the United States Surgeon General.
Once, finally, we got ahold of the documents,
once we finally got to know what this product is
really all about and we caught up with the tobacco
industry, we realized that addiction is the key to
everything.
It starts this whole
process.
It leads to the cigarette smoking.
It's right here.
And then this is all of that sort of medical
side of it that Dr. Villa talked to you about as far
as what's really going on, how it takes
dose-response, because there is all that damage that
goes on year after year after year, dose after dose,
as the addicted smoker smokes for his nicotine.
He's also getting all those carcinogens and all
those toxicants as well.
to lung cancer and how nicotine addiction causes
disease.
That's how addiction leads

said about this issue as far as smoking being the
legal cause of his lung cancer.
And you remember what he "Dr. Stein, based on the history, the physical,
the chest x-ray, the chest CT scan, the bronchoscopy,
the biopsy, and the brushings and washings, were you
able to arrive at a diagnosis of Mr. Barbose's condition

Based on the information that you

and training and experience, do you have an opinion,
sir, within reasonable medical probability as to whether
or not Mr. Barbose's 50 or so pack-year history of
cigarette smoking was a cause of his lung cancer?

"Well, in a gentleman like this, or any kind of
patient where you have a very strong smoking history, at

this type of bronchoscopic finding, with this type of
malignancy, a bronchogenic adenocarcinoma, large cell
adenocarcinoma, with this type of progression, with this
type of CT appearance, you've got to conclude that by
far the most likely cause of this cancer was his
smoking.
I don't believe there is any doubt about it.
Were there any other realistic risk factors

that you were able to see in any of the records, any of
the materials, any of the studies, any of the history, 3624
suggesting a different cause of his lung cancer other
than cigarette smoking?
A.
No, sir.
There are no significant confounding
factors.
Q.
Dr. Villa, for purposes of this question, I
want to ask you to assume that there has been other
testimony in this case indicating that Mr. Barbose was
addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes and that was a
cause of his heavy long-term smoking.

Mr. Barbose?

no doubt about it with Dr. Stein, smoking cigarettes
caused John Barbose's lung cancer.
And you saw
Dr. Villa there at the end where we asked him to
assume, because, you know, Dr. Villa, I would
submit, is far more qualified than the other experts
who came in here and talked about addiction from the
defense case.

He looked at the evidence. "Sir, seeing the evidence about nicotine

importance of nicotine in the cigarette industry's
business model, with that thought in mind, did you
review all the evidence gathered in this case regarding
John Barbose with an effort to determine whether or not

Yes.
I reviewed the evidence as to whether he was addicted to their cigarettes.

review?
A.
There's no doubt in my mind that he was an
addicted smoker, he was addicted to the defendant's
brands, and that he was unaware of the formulas and the
way the companies manipulated the brands he smoked." Dr. Cummings, no doubt -- and one
of the things you heard with Dr. Cummings and
Dr. Drobes is that they tend to find smokers who
smoked heavily for 40 or 50 years as addicted. And
they accuse them of that as if it was something

manufacturers could design cigarettes to allow
smokers to draw more smoke and nicotine from
cigarettes than was represented by those
machine-measured yields of tar and nicotine.
We showed you.
Remember the -- you probably
had never seen it before in your life, but we put
the filters up, the little paper up, and you see the
little laser perforated holes in there, more holes
in the lights than there are in the regulars.
That's there by design.
That's not an accident.
And it was there to trick these machines and give
different numbers than the smoker actually got
themselves.
And they make a big deal out of the idea that
no one could say that John inhaled more deeply or
whatever.
Who is going to know that about their
spouse?
But that's why they put those ventilation holes
in there is to get people to do that.
That's why
they do it is so that people will breathe in more
deeply and get diseases like adenocarcinoma. That's
what happens.
Dr. Cummings, who has reviewed more of this

information than anyone else who came in the
courtroom, told you addicted smokers, they rely upon
these industry lies. "Based on your research and study of the
industry, and these defendants in particular, do you

Do you believe that if John had been clearly

marketing, grew up in era where, you know, smoking was a
rite of passage and made that way by the marketing of
tobacco products to young people and then to adults as a
normal part of, you know, Americana.
And he smoked the
most popular brands of cigarettes, the most heavily
advertised that the companies would expect based on
their sales.
Their advertising directly relates to
that.
He was affected because he began smoking in the
early '50s and continued to smoke essentially right up
to the time that he passed away, by the concealment of
the health information, essentially what I call the
50-year coverup that was orchestrated by the defendants
in this case, R.J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, and other
cigarette companies where they spent over a billion Riesdorph 3671 dollars over that 45-year period to basically lie about
what they knew about the health risks of smoking, so not
giving the smokers the benefit of the doubt had there
been no controversy.
John Barbose was an intelligent
person.
He would at least have had the information at
that point that was withheld from him.
He tried to
They concealed the health effects of smoking
and addiction, specifically that nicotine addiction,
they knew it was going to hold him into the smoking
pattern once he got started smoking as a teenager and
that it would make it hard for him to quit.

quit and he failed, as they expected him to fail. It
was by design, not, you know, an accident, not a
personality flaw or character flaw of John Barbose. It
was the design and deliberate effort of the defendants.
The filter fraud and light fraud, that was just
another way of giving people an excuse, an exit ramp to
keep smoking.
That No. 2, you know, we've got to hold
So if you're having a tough time getting
smokers in.
off the cigarettes, here, we'll just make you a product
that, you know, gives you, you know, the perception that
it's lower in risk, when in fact the design changes that
went into those products, the addition of filters which 3672
makes it easier to draw the smoke deeper into the lungs
where you see it more on the peripheral part of the
lung, where you see most of the adenocarcinomas these
days, directly result in the companies -- the companies
knew there was no benefit to filters and lights.
And then nicotine manipulation, I've talked
about that, the design of the product.
Q.
Dr. Cummings, I want you to assume for the
purpose of this question that there is evidence in the
medical records that the jury will see and hear
testimony about that John Barbose died of lung cancer.
Did John Barbose -- assuming that, did John Barbose
become one of the 20 million people --
A.
Q.
A.
Yes.
-- who died from smoking?
Yes. John Barbose is one of those statistics."
You were told to ask the question

suffocate.
You heard her talk about at the end that
he ran out of oxygen and she had to race him to the
hospital.
You heard about how horrible it was.
And the instructions tell you you have to
consider her damages from the date of his injury
through the future losses that she has going
forward, all of that period of time, all those
things she experienced as she watched her strong,
hard-working husband get consumed by this lung
cancer.
So when you're looking at the damages in the 3688
case, the compensatory damages, the question on the
verdict form is going to ask you to compensate
Phyllis for the total amount of any damages she
sustained for the loss of her -- his companionship,
protection, and for the pain and suffering -- her
mental pain and suffering she experienced as a
result of his lung cancer and death.
And we all
made a commitment at the beginning that this case
would be decided on the evidence only, the evidence
and the law.
We talked about this way back in jury
selection.
The evidence in the case that you have
received on this -- it's something that you know
obviously from your own common sense -- is you have
to measure this based on the evidence in the case.
And so when you're appraising these damages, the way
to appraise these damages is to start the way you
would measure anything else.
If you're going to
measure how tall this is, you got to start from the
floor and come up.
Okay?
So the smallest amount of money we have in our
The smallest amount of time we

society is a penny.
have in our society is a second.
per second.
What that amounts to is over the course
of an hour, that's $36 around hour, which amounts to
$864 a day, because there's 24 hours a day.
Okay?
Okay? 3689
No one is going to come in here and suggest
And the evidence in this case is undisputed. All
right?
that there hasn't been 24 hours a day that she's
been without her husband.
1996.
without him.
she's going to be without him going forward. Okay?
It's undisputed on that.
He died July 17,
And 24 hours a day since then, she has been
Okay?
Twenty-four hours a day since then
And the same thing with the ten more years
together that you're supposed to consider their
joint life expectancy.
The only evidence in the
case you have is that she has ten more years based
on those mortality tables.
You can say that's not
It's up to you to decide that. But at
long enough.
least the evidence in the case is there is ten more.
And so you have 30 years total.
If you look at the days over those years in the
past at one penny per second over 24 hours a day,
you're talking about 7,062 days that she's
experienced in the past without her husband since he
died.
And that is $6,101,568 if you multiply
it times that metric of $864 a day, a penny per
second.
Okay?
Okay?
In the future, the ten years in the future from
today, is 3,652 days into the future.
If you 3690
multiply that, same thing, one penny per second as
the baseline, $3,155,328 is what that amounts to.
And so if you add that up all together on the
verdict form on the question where you'll write
this, which is question 6 as you see up here, okay,
the total amount of that figure is $9,256,896.
That's what the evidence has shown is the damages
that are awarded based on evidence in this case.
Obviously that is a suggestion.
All I can do is make a

You have to give an
The last thing I want to address is the
apportionment of fault.
You heard His Honor's 3691
Okay?
If you feel that the conspiracy and
instructions.
the concealment were a legal cause of John Barbose's
lung cancer and death, this doesn't apply.
The law says if you're a cheat, if you're a liar, if
you conceal stuff from people and you cause their
death, you don't get the benefit of this.
Okay?
That's just the way the law works.
All right?
But on the strict liability and the negligence
That's question 2, where
This does
And if it does apply, obviously you

apply to that.
need to compare the fault.
for those questions, for strict liability and
negligence, you've got to compare John Barbose and
what he did and what he knew and who he was to who
these industries were and who these companies were
and what they knew and what they did.
suggestion to you would be that based on the
evidence in the case, 45, 45, 10 is what the
evidence would show at most on that issue as far as
the comparison of the fault.
And our
You look at everything on those issues, on what
they knew versus what he knew and everything you
saw.
And, again, if it's -- the evidence in the
case we believe is very clear.
The fraud and 3692
conspiracy had a -- made a difference in the life of
John Barbose.
Their concealment made a difference.
If it does, this
It effectively caused his death.
gets wiped out.
Okay?
But if you have to write numbers down on there,
that's our suggestion what the numbers show based on
the evidence in the case.
That's the way the law is.
Obviously, thank you.
I just want to say one last thing before I sit
And I'll have a chance
down.
to speak to you again, but it will be very, very
brief.
Just after these folks go, I'll have a few
final comments on whatever they end up saying. I
just wanted to leave you with one sort of final
thought, because you've heard a lot in this case
about the evidence.
You've heard about 500,000

deaths.

But
a lot about that during this case.
fortunately, they don't write the laws that you're

the law that you're going to apply in this case.
Okay?
So when Mr. Geise is referring to little
excerpts of the law and picking little excerpts
here and there, you've got it in front of you.
Each of you has a copy.
There's a section called
final instruction 17 which is on punitive damages,
and it specifically tells you, you may consider
evidence concerning harm suffered by persons who
are not parties to this case.
Mr. Geise, when he
told you that no other smoker should be considered
here, he knew this was the instruction of the law. 3825
Okay?
You can consider
You have to consider that because how
That's what the law is.
that.
reprehensible their conduct was, how egregious
their conduct was for punitive damages, you have
to know exactly what they did, whether this was
just some isolated incident, was this a one-off
thing, or was this a pattern of practice over and
over.
So the law tells you you can consider that.
Considering the qualifications, I've already
talked about that.
The inference, this idea that an inference is
an assumption or some weird thing you're not
supposed to do, it's in the law His Honor has
given you.
You may use reason and common sense to reach
conclusions in this case.
inferences from the evidence.
It says -- now I've got to find it.

Same thing with the reliance.
Okay?
I mean, that

and conspiracy, that the reliance by John Barbose
on the conduct of these companies may be inferred
from the evidence and the testimony.
instructed by the Court that that's what the law
is.
Okay?
So when there's any questions about the law,
don't listen to what Mr. Geise thinks the law is.
Go to what it is in the instructions you have.
Now, I
don't know why he put that legal cause up there
and went on this thing about but for.
Okay? The
very next paragraph that he didn't choose to show
you that we did show you says, In order to be a
legal cause, it need not be the only cause. Okay?
Only cause is but for; it's the only cause. But
for this, it happened.
Same thing with that legal cause.
All right?
MR. GEISE:
Your Honor, objection, misstates
the law.

THE COURT:
MR. BIGGER:

Yeah.
In order to be regarded as a
Here's what the 3827
legal cause of lung cancer and death, an addiction
to cigarettes containing nicotine need not be the
only cause.
An addiction may be a legal cause
even though it operates in combination with the
acts of others -- cause, if such addiction
contributes substantially -- if it contributes
substantially to producing the lung cancer and
death.
So the question for you is, is that stuff --
Is it some
is the addiction just insubstantial?
insubstantial thing that doesn't matter at all, or
was it substantial?
you an addiction by nature -- addiction by its
very nature is a substantial contribution to why

information that would have made John Barbose act
differently if he had been told.
It says
that in the law.
You don't need to guess at it.
It's right there.
Okay?
The reliance idea, whether he took some
The action he took was the

the other part that he didn't take some action,
that he didn't try sooner to quit, that he didn't
