19          MR. McPHARLIN:  Thank you, Your Honor.
20          Counsel; Your Honor.
21          Good morning.
22          JURORS:  Good morning.
23          MR. McPHARLIN:  So, on behalf of Sharon
24    and, of course, Lillian --
25          Lillian started this lawsuit.  She's endured through this litigation from the
2    beginning.  She filed her lawsuit in 2007, but,
3    unfortunately, didn't make it to see the end of
4    that.  And, so, that's what we are here to do
5    today, to do this week, to see it through.
6          And we know that you have given up a huge
7    chunk of your life over these last few weeks to
8    be here.  Without you, this process doesn't
9    work.  Wrongs don't get adjudicated.  Those who
10    committed those wrongs escape accountability if
11    we don't have a process like this, if folks
12    like you aren't willing to give up the time
13    that you've given us.  So, of course --
14          And, obviously, we thank you.  And I'm
15    going to try not to waste any of your time
16    today.  I'm going to move as quickly as I can.
17    Somebody will probably slow me down eventually.
18    And I'm going to try to take you through
19    everything that I think that I can highlight to
20    you, that will show you, as we go through -- as
21    what you will go through in the verdict form as
22    part of your responsibility in this case.
23          As it has always been with the cigarette
24    industry, they do not want you to focus on
25    them.  They don't want you to look at what they did and what they created.  And this is what
2    they created (indicating).  This is what they
3    did.
4          We talked about the importance of these
5    time frames, we talked about the importance of
6    consumption and changes in the product that
7    they created, that were done intentionally by
8    them.  These weren't mistakes.  These weren't
9    done by accident.
10          This is what they did.  This is what they
11    created.  This graph is still growing.  This
12    graph isn't finished.  Lillian is a victim, a
13    part of this now.
14          They want you to think that it's just a
15    bunch of people who wanted to smoke themselves
16    to death.  That's what they want you to think.
17    It's not about their conduct, it's not about
18    their product, it's not about their
19    engineering, it's not about what they did; it's
20    just a bunch of people who didn't have the will
21    to stop doing what they knew from the '30s and
22    the '40s would eventually kill them.
23          They're going to tell you that selling
24    cigarettes is legal, marketing and advertising
25    cigarettes are legal, but that's only half of the sentence.  That's only half of the
2    statement.
3          What they can't do is lie, what they
4    can't do is create fake scientific
5    organizations, tell the public health
6    community, hey, we've got your back, we've got
7    the public's interest as our paramount
8    consideration, and we promise you -- we promise
9    that we are going to get to the bottom of this,
10    we promise that we are going to figure it out.
11          Science, to date, has not proven that
12    cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, or any
13    other disease, but you don't have to worry
14    about it.  We are going to put tens and
15    hundreds of millions of dollars into scientific
16    organizations, independent, neutral
17    organizations, that are going to get to the
18    bottom of this question.
19          So, selling a legal product, yeah, that's
20    great, that's business, that's what we have,
21    that's what our country prides itself on; but
22    what we also pride ourself on is not deceiving
23    consumers and our children, the public.
24          So you can market something if you want
25    to, but you better do it honestly.  You can market something if you want to make money, but
2    you better do it the right way.
3          And when you don't, when you harm
4    somebody because of the way that you have
5    conducted yourself, you are responsible for the
6    harms that you caused.
7          It's very simple.  It's not a complicated
8    equation.  They want you to think it's
9    complicated, but it isn't.  They lied, they
10    misled, they deceived, they confused.
11          These aren't my words; these are their
12    own words.
13          The choices that they made were to create
14    a litigation strategy, not a legitimate effort
15    to protect their consumers, not a legitimate
16    effort to help public health officials get to
17    the bottom of the question.
18          Their strategy was litigation.  Their
19    strategy was selling their product at any
20    price.  The price -- the price were lies.  The
21    price were one out of two people were going to
22    die using the product that they told everybody
23    was okay to use.
24          The Engle jury, the Engle class action
25    jury told them:  You lied, you deceived, you manufactured a product that caused harm.  You
2    did it so people would rely on it.  You
3    concealed, with your other manufacturers, other
4    organizations that you created, to deceive the
5    public.  They got caught.
6          And, so, we spent a lot of time talking
7    about what they did, a lot of time showing you
8    where we started and where we ended up.  We
9    didn't do it because we were trying to re-prove
10    what the jury in the Engle class action
11    decided.  That's not the purpose of it.
12          A couple of reasons:  One, because you
13    have to know.  You have to know what that
14    history is.
15          And the very last question on your
16    verdict form is going to be, is what they did,
17    what they did to this country, what they did to
18    Lillian, what they did, was it reprehensible?
19          Does it require us to spend a little more
20    time so that a punishment, an appropriate
21    punishment, can be exacted out on them, to
22    punish them for what they did, and to deter
23    them from doing it again, and to deter others
24    from thinking that this is an okay way to
25    conduct yourself, that corporations will know that this was not appropriate?
2          So the first thing --
3          Let's go to the slides.
4          We get to the very first issue for you,
5    and what I'm going to try to do is I'm going to
6    try to take us through, essentially, the
7    verdict form for you, and I'm going to do the
8    best I can.  There's a lot of evidence, there's
9    a lot of things that have been discussed,
10    there's a lot of issues for you.
11          I think they're going to try to make them
12    seem to be very complicated, but let's talk
13    about the first one.  The first one is class
14    membership.  And it's really not that
15    complicated, all right?
16          It's not about fault, it's not about
17    awareness, it's not about choices, it's not
18    about what brands she smoked.  It's not about
19    any of that.
20          Was she addicted?  Did her addiction
21    cause her to continue to smoke until -- did it
22    contribute to that, until she was -- until she
23    contracted COPD?
24          Very simple:  Addiction and COPD.
25          It's very straightforward, it's very important, because obviously if your answer to
2    that question is "no," then the case is over.
3    If your answer to that question is "no," you've
4    determined that Lillian is not a part of the
5    class, R.J. Reynolds wins, and the case is
6    over.  It's simple because it's very
7    straightforward.
8          And we have to prove our claim by the
9    greater weight of the evidence, right?  That's
10    our burden of proof, greater weight of the
11    evidence.  What is more likely than not?
12          What do we have to do?  We have to prove
13    to you everything that we have to prove.  Every
14    question on this verdict form, every issue that
15    we have the burden on, is by that standard,
16    greater weight of the evidence, what is more
17    likely than not.
18          It's not reasonable doubt, it's not
19    significantly more than the other; it's what is
20    more likely than not.
21          And I think, based on the evidence that
22    we have presented you with, we have clearly met
23    that burden and we have far exceeded "more
24    likely than not."  But that's the standard.
25    That's what we have to prove our case by. And, so, let's start with the very first
2    issue, her COPD.  What caused her COPD?
3          Well, the Judge read to you, in the
4    instructions, approximately five or six things
5    that R.J. Reynolds agreed to.  Of those five or
6    six things, one of them was not that cigarette
7    smoking was the cause of her COPD.  Because of
8    that, because of their --
9          Because of that, we have to prove it,
10    right?  If they don't agree to it, we have to
11    prove it.
12          Now, despite that, we have what you were
13    read -- what was read to you in trial.  This
14    was an admission by R.J. Reynolds.
15          All right.  This is from His Honor:
16    Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the
17    plaintiff's request for admissions on the
18    defendant R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company prior
19    to trial, their responses have been recorded.
20    You are to accept these facts as true.
21    Proceed.
22          Admit that Lillian Kaplan's COPD was
23    caused by smoking cigarettes.
24          Answer:  Reynolds admits that smoking was
25    the medical cause of Lillian Kaplan's COPD. Now, despite that, we still had to prove
2    it to you at trial.
3          MR. KACZYNSKI:  Objection, Your Honor.
4          THE COURT:  Sustained.
5          MR. McPHARLIN:  We had to prove it to you
6    at trial.
7          MR. KACZYNSKI:  Objection, Your Honor.
8          THE COURT:  Overruled.
9          Proceed, Counsel.
10          MR. McPHARLIN:  So what did we do?  We
11    presented you with the testimony of --
12          Well, we presented you their admission.
13    We presented you with the testimony of
14    Dr. Weiner.
15          What did Dr. Weiner say?  Dr. Weiner
16    said --
17          Dr. Weiner said clearly in his
18    testimony -- I'll find it -- that her COPD --
19    if you remember, if your recollections are --
20    her COPD was caused by cigarette smoking.
21          Dr. Keller, their expert, said --
22    testified under oath that her COPD was caused
23    by cigarette smoking.
24          So we have R.J. Reynolds' admission, we
25    have testimony from Dr. Weiner, and we have the sworn testimony from their own expert that her
2    COPD was caused by smoking.
3          And, so, I think that leaves that issue
4    alone, that you should not have to worry about
5    that issue.  It gets us to the next issue on
6    addiction:  Was Lillian Kaplan addicted?  Did
7    Lillian Kaplan's addiction cause COPD?  Did it
8    substantially contribute to her COPD?
9          All right.  And, so, one of the things
10    you're going to get, one of the things --
11    instructions you've already gotten is legal
12    cause.
13          Addiction is a legal cause of her COPD if
14    it directly and in natural and continuous
15    sequence produces or contributes substantially
16    to producing such COPD, so that it can
17    reasonably be said that, but for the addiction,
18    the COPD would not have occurred.
19          But for the addiction, if she was not
20    addicted to nicotine, would she have smoked two
21    packs a day for almost 50 years?
22          Two packs a day, 40 cigarettes a day.
23    That's 10,900 cigarettes a year; 547,000 over
24    her lifetime.  We talked about how much
25    nicotine that is, how much -- how many doses of nicotine that is that somebody is taking
2    throughout the day, throughout the week,
3    throughout the year, throughout their lifetime.
4    6,843,000.  114,000 hours spent smoking.  7,000
5    days spent smoking.  19.5 years.
6          Did her addiction substantially
7    contribute to that behavior?  What's more
8    likely than not?  That she did it -- like
9    Dr. Kaplan wants you to think, that she did it
10    because she liked the taste, that she spent all
11    that time because she liked the smell, that she
12    went back to it time and time again, after
13    trying to quit, because she liked the social
14    aspect of it?  Is that reasonable?
15          So what it is not about --
16          And, remember, legal cause is a cause.
17    It isn't the only cause; it is one of the
18    causes.
19          So did her --
20          Was her addiction a cause, a legal cause?
21    Did it substantially contribute, among many
22    other things, but did that substantially
23    contribute to her continued smoking and the
24    development of her COPD?
25          So it's not about choice.  That's not part of the question, that's not part of the
2    instructions that you're getting, that's not
3    the answer that you're asked on the verdict
4    form.
5          That's an issue that they raised, that's
6    an issue they want you to focus on; right?  But
7    it has nothing to do with class membership.
8    Zero.  Nothing.
9          Was she addicted and did that addiction
10    substantially contribute to her developing
11    COPD?
12          And, so, we have to look at her.  We have
13    to look at what her smoking behavior was.  She
14    started at age 12, smoked a pack a day,
15    unfiltered Camels, moved up to two packs a day,
16    and she told you why.  She just needed to smoke
17    more.
18          She smoked first thing in the morning.
19    She's grabbing her cigarettes before her feet
20    hit the floor, within minutes of waking up,
21    since she was in high school.  That's what she
22    did.  That's what compelled her.
23          She smoked while she was pregnant.  She
24    smoked around her children.  She took in huge
25    doses of nicotine every single day.  Her brain was flushed with nicotine every single day.
2          She bought cigarettes by the carton, she
3    inhaled deeply like they wanted her to do, like
4    they were teaching the public how to do.  She
5    could smoke anywhere.  She just craved it.
6          And she tried to quit for decades.  Even
7    Dr. Kaplan admits that she tried to quit.  Her
8    children saw her trying to quit.  Dr. Kaplan
9    says that because she couldn't remember or
10    report how she felt when she quit in '94, it
11    just means that all of those other years, all
12    of those other decades, all of those other
13    attempts, everything her kids noticed,
14    everything Lillian noticed, everything she
15    felt, that wasn't withdrawal.  It couldn't have
16    been.
17          She hits what we see as rock bottom in
18    1994, when what she is given, in her mind, is a
19    death sentence.
20          She obviously didn't know at that time
21    that her death would be caused by lung cancer,
22    but what she thought was a death sentence was
23    from her COPD.
24          And they wheeled in oxygen, and they put
25    her on oxygen, and the doctor diagnosed her with COPD.  And she was severely limited in her
2    breathing, severely limited in her lung
3    function, and, because of that, she can't
4    remember or recall how she was feeling.  She
5    was more focused on living, surviving, using
6    her oxygen, getting through that moment in her
7    life.
8          She tried to quit with her husband, she
9    tried to quit on her own.  She told you, her
10    words, she needed to smoke.  She craved it.
11          They asked her about enjoyment.  It
12    wasn't that I enjoyed it.  I hated myself for
13    it.  It was something I had to do.
14          The only evidence in the case that you
15    have is that, with her quit attempts, her many,
16    many quit attempts, she got distracted, she
17    felt all different kinds of withdrawal
18    symptoms.  There's no evidence to dispute that.
19          Her son talked about flu-like symptoms.
20    He saw her sick in bed when she was trying to
21    quit.  She would get irritable, nervous.  She
22    would get angry.  She yelled at her kids, which
23    she never did.  She yelled at her husband,
24    which she didn't do.  She was a different
25    person.  That was the observations of her family, and there's no evidence to contradict
2    that.
3          So that's the evidence about what she
4    went through when she tried to quit.  And
5    despite going through that, she tried it again
6    and again and again.
7          Even Dr. Kaplan admitted that there isn't
8    only one way to look at addiction.  We know
9    that through Dr. Kaplan, because when he
10    started testifying for the tobacco companies in
11    the late '90s, he didn't think cigarette
12    smoking was addictive, he didn't think nicotine
13    was a drug, and he didn't think, so he says,
14    that nicotine was addictive.
15          That's what he said under oath in 1999,
16    when he testified for the cigarette industry in
17    the Engle class action.
18          Compulsive need for and use of a
19    habit-forming substance characterized by
20    tolerance with well-defined physiological
21    symptoms upon withdrawal.  Persistent,
22    compulsive use of a substance known by the user
23    to be harmful.
24          That fits Lillian Kaplan to a tee.  That
25    fits the evidence that you've seen, and there is no substantial evidence to the contrary.
2          The definition recognized by even
3    Dr. Kaplan, "addiction" is defined as a
4    chronic, relapsing brain disease that is
5    characterized by compulsive use -- compulsive
6    drug-seeking and use, despite the harmful
7    consequences.  A chronic, relapsing brain
8    disease.
9          Dr. Cummings talked to you about it.
10    Even Dr. Kaplan admitted that nicotine changes
11    your brain, and it changes it in a considerable
12    way.
13          And the only one who's done research, the
14    only one who has been consulted by the Surgeon
15    General, the CDC, the National Institutes of
16    Health, international and domestic
17    organizations that are designed for public
18    health, was Dr. Cummings.
19          And he talked to you about how
20    significant this impacts our brain, how
21    significant it impacts the brain of a teenager,
22    of a child, and how important that is in the --
23    in creating, developing and sustaining
24    addiction.
25          And she started when she was 12.  She's a pack a day by the time she's 17.  So, by the
2    mid-'40s, she's a pack a day.  Her brain has
3    already started changing.  She's not even 20
4    years old yet.
5          The American Psychiatric Association
6    defines "addiction" as a chronic brain disease
7    that causes compulsive substance use despite
8    harmful consequences.  Compulsive substance
9    use.
10          Dr. Cummings talked about the key
11    features of Lillian's smoking behavior.  She
12    had persistent daily use.  The time to her
13    first cigarette, which has been validated and
14    scientifically studied for many decades, how
15    important that is, what that means, how much --
16    how important that is in terms of how hard it
17    is going to be for somebody to quit smoking,
18    she smoked within minutes.
19          She smoked two packs a day.  She started
20    early.  She tried to quit.  She went through
21    withdrawal symptoms.  She continued despite
22    hearing rumors.  At the very least, she's
23    concerned and she's trying to quit.
24          The Judge read you an instruction that
25    you may accept such opinion -- Regarding expert testimony, you may
2    accept such opinions -- opinion testimony,
3    reject it, or give it the weight you think it
4    deserves, considering the knowledge, skill,
5    experience, training or education of the
6    witness.
7          They want you to think that she smoked
8    enough --
9          They'll admit that she smoked enough to
10    cause a life-threatening disease, chronic
11    obstructive pulmonary disease, but not any of
12    it, not part of it, not even a little bit of it
13    was because she smoked because of an addiction.
14          That's what they want you to think.  She
15    smoked herself into a fatal disease, but her
16    addiction had nothing to do with it.
17          We talked about the product, itself, what
18    they created, what they knew they were doing to
19    folks.
20          1963:  Moreover, nicotine is addictive.
21    We are, then, in the business of selling
22    nicotine, an addictive drug, effective in the
23    release of stress mechanisms.
24          1972:  For the typical smoker, nicotine
25    satisfaction is the dominant desire. Therefore, in designing any cigarette product,
2    the dominant specification should be nicotine
3    delivery.
4          They knew exactly what they were doing to
5    the public.  They knew what they were doing to
6    kids and teenagers.  They knew that their
7    business were high school kids, and that that's
8    when they were starting, and this is why they
9    were smoking.  This is what was creating their
10    need to continue to smoke.
11          1972:  The tobacco -- tobacco products
12    can contain and deliver nicotine, a potent
13    drug, with a variety of physiological effects.
14    Our industry is based upon design, manufacture
15    and sale of attractive dosage forms of
16    nicotine.  We provide a product that is an
17    essential commodity and a habitual act.  Put a
18    hungry rat in a cage, put a lever in the cage,
19    the rat will push the lever.  Smoking the
20    cigarette is the lever push.
21          They knew exactly what they were doing.
22    They knew the impact that this had on people's
23    brains.  They studied it better than anybody.
24    They knew more than anybody about their
25    product, what it was doing to people, both on an addiction level and on a health level.
2          And we know from their own records that
3    addiction is not a choice that these folks are
4    making.  It's not what they're setting
5    themselves out for.  They're not setting
6    themselves out to become addicted, they're not
7    setting themselves out to die from a
8    smoking-related disease, one out of two.  Who
9    would do that?  Who would choose to do that?
10          The absorption through nicotine -- of
11    nicotine through lungs is as quick as the
12    junkie's fix.  In 20 to 30 minutes after the
13    smoker has finished his cigarette, most of the
14    nicotine has left, and this is just about the
15    time that the heavily dependent smoker needs
16    his next cigarette.
17          1980, they addressed this very issue.
18    Cigarette smoking is more addictive than using
19    heroin, hooking two-thirds of the people who
20    ever smoke.
21          Then they go on to say:  We can't defend
22    continued smoking as free choice if the person
23    was addicted.
24          They know that it's not a choice that
25    these people are making.  It's a reaction to the product that they're giving them.  It's a
2    reaction to their engineering, to the
3    specifications that they put into it.
4          The desired specification is addiction,
5    through the appropriate dosing of nicotine,
6    inhaled so it gets as fast to the brain as
7    humanly possible.

5    6 7    follows:)
8          VOICE:  Our nation has mobilized enormous
9    resources to wage a war on drugs, illicit
10    drugs.  We should also give priority to the one
11    addiction, tobacco addiction, that is killing
12    more than 300,000 Americans each year.
13          (Video clip concluded.)
14          MR. McPHARLIN:  So we talked about this
15    with Dr. Villa, and he explained to you the
16    mechanism and the process, the exposure, that
17    continued exposure.
18          And there is no question that that
19    continued exposure, 20, 40 times a day,
20    hundreds of times a day, thousands of times a
21    week, tens of thousands of times a year,
22    hundreds of thousands of times over a lifetime,
23    they're not doing it because of choice.
24    They're not choosing to get lung cancer.
25    They're not choosing to get carcinogens into their -- deep into their lungs.  That's not
2    what they're choosing to do.
3          You heard Dr. Kaplan recognize, when
4    asked -- many years ago, of course -- what is
5    your definition of "addiction"?
6          Well, most clinicians use the 1988
7    Surgeon General report.  And most clinicians
8    use, and I would use it, as the definition of
9    "addiction" --
10          He changed his testimony in trial, but
11    what he said was, that definition was
12    persistent daily use --
13          The primary features of his definition of
14    "addiction" back in 2002 were persistent daily
15    use, time to first cigarette, amount smoked per
16    day.  Right?
17          I'll get it right for you.  But you
18    remember that.
19          Persistent use, compulsive use,
20    drug-reinforcing behavior, psychoactive
21    effects, right?  Psychoactive effects,
22    drug-reinforcing behavior, compulsive use.
23          He changed his testimony about what
24    compulsive use was.  It used to be he would say
25    compulsive use is smoking cigarettes multiple times a day, every day.
2          Nicotine, by its nature, produces
3    psychoactive effects.  And he did admit Lillian
4    exhibited drug-reinforcing behavior.
5          So, by his own admission, by a definition
6    that he thought was perfectly fine a few years
7    ago, she would fit that criteria, she would be
8    addicted by the Surgeon General's definition of
9    "addiction."
10          And Dr. Cummings told you that the clear
11    medical consensus is that nicotine addiction is
12    the fundamental reason that people continue to
13    use cigarettes.  The fundamental reason.  Not
14    part of it, not some of it; the fundamental
15    reason.
16          And you heard only from Dr. Kaplan
17    something different.  If that wasn't the
18    medical consensus that we have formed today and
19    over the last many years, you would have heard
20    it.
21          Now, I'm not going to go through these
22    again.  Dr. Cummings talked in detail.  He
23    talked to you about the Heaviness of Smoking
24    Index, how significant -- how validated and
25    reliable it is, and what those indications are to somebody who -- how heavily addicted they
2    are, how hard it will be for them to quit.
3          Lillian scored high dependence on the
4    Heaviness of Smoking.
5          He took her through the Fagerstrom, which
6    is a validated measure of how addicted somebody
7    is.  And it's only for persistent daily users.
8    It's only for persistent daily users.
9          They're trying to make it sound like
10    anybody who ever smoked a cigarette would be
11    addicted under this.  Well, that's just not how
12    it's applied.  That's completely misleading.
13          It's applied to persistent daily users.
14    And then, once you have that, okay, let's go
15    through it.  Lillian was heavily addicted,
16    severely, under that measure, validated
17    measure.
18          Even with the DSM, if we took her through
19    the DSM, Dr. Kaplan's subjective use of the
20    DSM, who could possibly meet his criteria?
21          You would have to have a cognitive
22    disorder like dementia or psychosis, a serious
23    psychiatric condition like psychosis, in order
24    for you to meet his interpretation of the DSM.
25          And it's plain English, but he won't admit it.  A maladaptive pattern of substance
2    abuse leading to clinically significant
3    impairment or distress as manifested by three
4    or more.  That was the DSM-IV.
5          The same question for the DSM-5:  As
6    manifested by two or more of the following.
7          He does admit that, according to the
8    DSM-IV, 80 to 90 percent of regular smokers
9    have nicotine dependence.  Somehow Lillian is
10    that rare exception.
11          Ninety-five percent of regular smokers
12    started as teens.  Classic signs of withdrawal,
13    all of what we saw with Lillian.
14          And he also admitted that you don't even
15    use -- you're not even supposed to use the DSM
16    for somebody who isn't currently using the
17    substance.
18          Without the chemical compound, the
19    cigarette market would collapse.  PM would
20    collapse, we would all lose our jobs and our
21    consulting fees.  We cannot ever be comfortable
22    selling a product which most of our customers
23    would stop using if they could.
24          This is from R.J. Reynolds.
25          That is to say, if the exit gate from our market should suddenly open, we could be out of
2    business almost overnight.
3          Most who have smoked for any significant
4    time would like to stop.  We know Lillian did.
5    We know she wanted to.
6          Many, but not most, of those who would
7    like to stop smoking are able to do so.  That's
8    what they said.  That's what they recognized in
9    their own research.
10          However, we cannot ever be comfortable
11    selling a product which most of our customers
12    would stop using if they could.
13          So addiction is a legal cause, a cause of
14    her continued smoking, a cause of her continued
15    exposure to the carcinogens and toxins in their
16    cigarettes that led to her COPD.
17          This question is not about -- it's not
18    about fault.  Fault will come later.  It's not
19    about whether addicts can quit.  Even
20    Dr. Kaplan admitted that heavy addicts can
21    quit.
22          It's not about reliance, it's not about
23    responsibility.  It's about addiction, and did
24    that addiction contribute to her developing her
25    disease. And, so, clearly -- I'm going to move
2    through it quick -- the answer to Question 1 is
3    "yes."  More likely than not, was she addicted?
4    More likely than not, did that addiction
5    contribute to her continued smoking?  Yes.
6          Dr. Kaplan would have you believe that
7    nobody smokes -- go to 156 -- because of
8    addiction.  That's who they brought in.  That's
9    who their expert was.  That's their rebuttal to
10    all of the science, their own business records,
11    their own knowledge, Dr. Kaplan, who doesn't
12    think anybody smokes at all, even a little bit,
13    because of addiction.
14          So the very simple answer, was she
15    addicted, did that addiction contribute to her
16    disease?  Yes.
17          Now, the next thing I have to talk to you
18    about is statute of limitations.  And their
19    defense is that Lillian knew or should have
20    known that she had chronic obstructive
21    pulmonary disease.  That's their defense.
22    That's their burden, not ours.  It's theirs.
23          They have to prove to you that she had
24    COPD before May of 1990, and that she knew or
25    should have known that she had COPD.  Not did she have a cough, not did she have a smoker's
2    cough.  That's not the standard, that's not
3    what they have to prove.  They have to prove
4    that she knew or should have known she had it,
5    had COPD.
6          Now, we know --
7          This admission was read to you:  Admit
8    that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company is not in
9    possession of any medical records indicating
10    that Lillian Kaplan was diagnosed with COPD
11    prior to May 5th, 1990.
12          Response:  Reynolds admits that it is not
13    in possession of medical records indicating
14    that Lillian Kaplan was diagnosed with COPD
15    prior to May 5th, 1990.
16          There's no evidence of it.  Zero.
17          You heard from Dr. Weiner.  Aside from
18    the coughing, and aside from the cough --
19          This is Arthur, rather.  I'm sorry.
20          Aside from the coughing, did you ever
21    notice your mother having any breathing
22    difficulties?
23          Coughing from cigarettes can sometimes --
24    you can catch -- you can't catch your breath.
25          That's it.  That's it.  A cough, and nothing more.
2          Lillian was asked:  Do you recall any
3    relatives ever being diagnosed with emphysema?
4          No.
5          What about COPD?
6          No.
7          Talked about her husband, what she found
8    on his death certificate.
9          She never had a pulmonary function test.
10    Dr. Weiner is the one who gave her her first
11    pulmonary function test.
12          How soon after Florida -- moving to
13    Florida?
14          About two years.
15          Did you experience difficulty breathing
16    when you lived in New York?
17          No.
18          There's no evidence that she did.
19          Short of breath in the '90s.  There's no
20    evidence that she was short of breath before
21    that.
22          She bowled in New York.  She was active,
23    did what she wanted.  There's no evidence that
24    she was limited in any way, shape or form.
25          They told you that she believed her sister died from -- her lung cancer was caused
2    by smoking.  That's not what her testimony was.
3    Her testimony was that she didn't believe it
4    was caused by smoking.
5          All right.  So here's Dr. Kaplan.
6    Dr. Kaplan was asked:  You were asked about
7    Factor Number 9 in the DSM-IV, which is,
8    essentially, smoking in the face of a known
9    risk; correct?
10          And you gave -- you didn't give
11    Mrs. Kaplan that one because when she went to
12    the doctor, she was told about her COPD and she
13    stopped at that time; right?
14          Correct.  Not -- not just the known
15    risks, but the person believes that they have a
16    medical or psychological problem as a
17    consequence of the substance.  And the first
18    time that she believed that was when she saw
19    Dr. Weiner, he tells her -- he tells her, she
20    stopped.  So she would not fulfill that.
21          The first time she believed was when she
22    saw Dr. Weiner.  That's from their own expert.
23    He read her medical records, he read all the
24    depositions.  You saw the long list.
25          He spent $55,000 preparing to talk to you folks.  And his testimony is she didn't believe
2    it or know it until Dr. Weiner told her.
3          So, from 12 years old, up until 1994,
4    it's your opinion that she did not continue
5    smoking believing it was causing her any harm
6    or could potentially cause her harm; correct?
7          No.  She -- that's a different question.
8    She shared with me -- when I asked her about
9    the risk of harm, she shared with me multiple
10    things.  She shared with me that she knew about
11    the Surgeon General's warning.  She thought
12    it -- she thought, since the '70s, she knew it
13    could be dangerous, she knew about the films
14    and newspaper and other things, so she knew it
15    could be harmful; but in terms of her smoking,
16    knowing that she had a medical problem from
17    smoke, no.
18          That evidence is very clear.  She sees a
19    doctor, the doctor says, you've got serious
20    lung problems, you need to stop smoking.  Boom,
21    right in the office, she throws her cigarettes
22    out.
23          So when she found out she had a physical
24    problem related to tobacco use, she stopped on
25    that day. So, in your opinion, she didn't know she
2    had a medical condition prior to that time?
3          Correct.  That was caused by smoking.
4          Dr. Keller:  He admits that there's no
5    evidence that she had dyspnea on exertion
6    before 1990.  Correct?
7          Answer:  Yes.
8          No evidence of shortness of breath before
9    1990?
10          Correct.
11          No history of sputum production as it
12    relates to Lillian.
13          And he says:  No, no, not true.
14    According to the testimony of her son, she did
15    have sputum production.
16          That's not what he said.  So he's wrong
17    about that.
18          He didn't use the word "sputum?"
19          No.
20          No record during the entire time that she
21    was seeing Dr. Doben, from '91 to '93, in that
22    time frame, no record said she was diagnosed
23    with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
24    true?
25          And here's something interesting from Dr. Keller.  I'm going to speed through this.
2          All right.  What I can tell you is, from
3    treating thousands of patients with COPD, that
4    that is the paramount symptom in someone with
5    COPD; and it is very clear, when you read the
6    doctor's notes from those patients, dyspnea is
7    always there.  It is always there.  It's a
8    chronic symptom, it's gradually progressive,
9    and you cannot even entertain a diagnosis of
10    COPD on someone who doesn't have exertion
11    dyspnea.  Did I read that correctly?
12          Answer:  Yes.
13          There was no evidence that anybody
14    noticed shortness of breath before 1990?
15          Yes.
16          So there's no dyspnea?
17          Nothing, zero.
18          All right.  And, so, this is what you
19    were told.  You got a pretty long instruction
20    on this, and one of the things that the Judge
21    told you is:  Defendant need not prove that
22    Lillian was actually diagnosed with COPD before
23    May 1990 in order to prevail on that defense.
24    We agree.
25          For purposes of this defense, the critical event is not when her COPD was
2    actually diagnosed by a physician, but when her
3    COPD first manifested itself.  A disease
4    manifests itself when it becomes diagnosable
5    through evaluation of the plaintiff --
6    patient's symptoms.
7          Paramount to the diagnosis is dyspnea.
8    She never had it.  Even he admits that there's
9    no way that she could have been diagnosable
10    prior to May of 1990.
11          When it becomes diagnosable through
12    evaluation of a patient's symptoms.  And she
13    didn't have the paramount one that he said she
14    needed.
15          Dr. Weiner said it, too.  Cough is
16    probably the hardest diagnosis for me to figure
17    out when they come in to see me in the office,
18    because there are so many different things that
19    can result in cough.
20          And, so, when you're asked --
21          When you get to that section, Question 2,
22    did she know or reasonably have known, even
23    their own expert says she could not have known.
24    Could not have known, did not know.  Not maybe
25    she knew; she didn't know. The answer to that has to be "no."  Has
2    to be "no."
3          Now --
4          Yeah, that's true.
5          And Dr. Keller said -- and just use your
6    memory on this one -- he talked about
7    Dr. Doben, and he talked about how he didn't
8    blame Dr. Doben for not diagnosing her because
9    Dr. Doben wasn't a specialist like Dr. Keller
10    is.  And specialists don't have the training
11    and techniques in order to be able to discern
12    that stuff.
13          So it wasn't Dr. Doben's fault that he
14    didn't know she had COPD before Dr. Weiner
15    diagnosed her.  That's what Dr. Keller said.
16          Now, the next question you're going to
17    get to is apportionment of fault, and you're
18    going to have to decide how much R.J. Reynolds
19    is responsible for --
20          Remember, it's not just R.J. Reynolds.
21    It's R.J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson,
22    American Tobacco, Lorillard.  That's all
23    R.J. Reynolds.  It's all of their conduct, all
24    of their knowledge, versus Lillian; right?
25    That's what you have to decide. Now, this section doesn't apply to the
2    intentional wrongs that R.J. Reynolds
3    committed, and so this apportionment of fault
4    only applies to the negligence claims.
5          If you decide that they did something
6    intentional, the Court, as he told you, will
7    not reduce your award by this percentage.  But
8    it's still something you have to fill out, it's
9    still something you have to figure out amongst
10    yourselves, and use your best judgment and your
11    common sense as to who's more at fault.
12          Who's significantly more at fault here,
13    the company that manufactured the product, or
14    the 12-year-old who started, or the 17-year-old
15    who started, or the lady who -- the mom who was
16    smoking 25 years before the first warning went
17    on, the warning that they fought, that they
18    never gave her before that, and that they
19    continued to deny after that?
20          Reynolds placed cigarettes that were
21    unreasonably dangerous and defective on the
22    market.  That's a finding that you have to
23    accept and you have to follow.  It is the
24    finding of the Engle jury they were negligent.
25          Once you get past Question 2, you apply all of those findings, and then you answer
2    Question 3 with all of those findings in mind.
3          That's Lillian, as you know, 12 years
4    old.  This is the one that they're saying today
5    should have known everything that she needed to
6    know about cigarette smoking.  Twelve years
7    old, 17 years old.
8          Dr. Kaplan thinks that she is just as
9    mature as an adult at 12, Lillian Kaplan was.
10    That's what Dr. Kaplan said.
11          They misled the public about filters,
12    they gave the public a crutch, they gave the
13    public an excuse.  Forget about the things that
14    they said, the lie -- just the direct lies that
15    they gave -- they made.
16          They -- they marketed and advertised a
17    product that made people think you could
18    continue doing this without the possibilities,
19    without the potentials that these other folks
20    are saying they are.  But they're not.  But
21    smoke these, because this is what it will do
22    for you.
23          The industry does not believe there are
24    any bad elements.  If there are any bad
25    elements, they will be removed.  We say, here is our triple, quadruple, quintuple filter,
2    capable of removing whatever constituents of
3    smoke is currently suspect, while delivering
4    the full flavor and, incidentally, a nice jolt
5    of nicotine.  And if we are the first to be
6    able to make and sustain that claim, what price
7    Kent?
8          This is Reynolds at the top here, too:
9    In most cases, however, the smoker of a
10    filtered cigarette was getting as much or more
11    nicotine and tar than she would have gotten
12    from a regular cigarette.  She had abandoned
13    the regular cigarette, however, on the grounds
14    of reduced risk to health.
15          The illusion of filtration.  As we know,
16    all too often, the smoker who switches to a
17    hi-fi cigarette winds up smoking more units in
18    order to provide himself with the same delivery
19    which he had.
20          There's no way that Lillian Kaplan knew
21    that.  There's no way that she knew that the
22    claims that they were making were totally
23    false.  There's absolutely no way she could
24    have known that.  They withheld that.  They did
25    it intentionally. They used ingredients in their products
2    to affect the delivery of nicotine for one
3    reason and one reason only, as you saw by their
4    own business records:  To affect their sales.
5          Why?  Because they're addicting people.
6          Ammonia, in their secret documents, on
7    their list, on their website.  Ammonia.
8          They used flu-curing to make them
9    inhalable.  They put in additives to manipulate
10    nicotine delivery.  They used bronchodilators
11    to open up their lungs.
12          Flavorings, leaf blending, ammoniation,
13    freebasing nicotine.  That's what R.J. Reynolds
14    did.
15    16 17    follows:)
18          VOICE:  Truck driver, Dennis Gaines, a
19    grandfather, says he's been smoking for 30
20    years and is still not convinced cigarettes are
21    dangerous.
22          VOICE:  You know they say it causes
23    cancer and heart disease.  Do you believe that?
24          VOICE:  No, I don't.  Not -- not in my
25    heart, I can't believe it.  I look back at the peoples that make the cigarettes and I feel
2    like that the one that make the cigarettes
3    should know what they're doing.
4          (Video clip concluded.)
5          MR. McPHARLIN:  The ones that make the
6    cigarettes should know what they're doing.
7          That's what they told the public:  We
8    know what we're doing, we know exactly what
9    we're doing, we know what we're selling,
10    there's no proof it causes harm.
11          Despite their novel invention, filters,
12    lung cancer deaths continued to rise,
13    skyrocket.  Filters are going up.  Here we see
14    the jump increasing.  It dips a little bit and
15    then it continues to go up.  Why?  Because of
16    filters.
17          Ninety-five percent of the market is
18    quickly all filters.  Why?  Because of the way
19    they were advertising them, because of the way
20    that they were informing the public about
21    their -- about their efficiency, about their
22    effectiveness.
23          So when you're talking about a company
24    versus a 12-year-old, a 17-year-old, a young
25    mom, somebody just trying to get through life, somebody just trying to raise their kids,
2    who -- what are we comparing?
3          That's what you're comparing:
4    R.J. Reynolds, American Tobacco, Brown &
5    Williamson, Lorillard Tobacco, to Lillian
6    Kaplan, to Lilly.
7          Now, the next thing I'm going to talk to
8    you about is lung cancer.  What caused her lung
9    cancer?
10          Again, it is something we have to prove,
11    so we brought in Dr. Villa.
12          Does each dose of those years -- do each
13    of those years substantially -- of her
14    cigarette smoking, do each of those years
15    substantially contribute to the development of
16    her lung cancer?
17          Absolutely.
18          He testified, unequivocally, that the
19    years that she smoked, all of those years, the
20    years that she smoked Kent, Barclay, Winston,
21    Carlton, Lucky Strikes, Camel, all
22    substantially contributed to the development of
23    her lung cancer.
24          Their own expert, Dr. Bishopric, who is
25    board certified in internal medicine, went to medical school, it was her opinion that
2    cigarette smoking was the cause of Lillian's
3    lung cancer.
4          Dr. Villa talked to you about -- I mean,
5    just the likelihood that it wasn't from
6    smoking.  He talked about the percentages of
7    adenocarcinomas.  You heard about the
8    percentage of adenocarcinoma increased as a
9    result of filters.  She was obviously a
10    filtered cigarette smoker.
11          She had adenocarcinoma.  Dr. Villa took
12    you through that very specifically.  He even
13    talked to you about, when you look at
14    populations of women who smoke over a certain
15    number of years --
16          We talked about 40 years.
17          So I asked him:  That population of women
18    who develop lung cancer, what is the percentage
19    of that population that their lung cancer is
20    caused by smoking?
21          Ninety-seven percent.
22    Ninety-seven percent.
23          Are we to believe that Lillian Kaplan is
24    somehow in that three percent?  What's more
25    likely than not?  Remember, what's more likely than not?  That she's in the three percent or
2    the 97 percent?  That her cigarette smoking
3    caused her lung cancer, like Dr. Bishopric
4    said, and like Dr. Villa said?
5          And the only thing contrary you have from
6    them is Dr. Keller, who just simply said, I
7    don't know.  He's not a pathologist, he's not
8    an oncologist.  His opinion was, I don't know.
9    That doesn't rebut, that doesn't negate the
10    evidence that you have.  There's no evidence to
11    the contrary, that her cigarette smoking did
12    not cause her lung cancer.
13          And, so, I think the evidence is
14    overwhelming.  It's certainly more likely than
15    not, and it far exceeds that.  That, yes, her
16    smoking cigarettes, manufactured by
17    R.J. Reynolds and all of the companies that
18    they're responsible for, substantially
19    contributed to the cause -- it was a cause of
20    her lung cancer.
21          As he told you, I have a limited amount
22    of time.  I have two opportunities to speak to
23    you, and I'm sorry if I'm going too fast.  I'm
24    sure you want me to finish.  And I do have a
25    time limit, so I will finish. I have to talk about damages, and I have
2    to talk about them in two different ways,
3    because you have two questions on the verdict
4    form -- two different sets of questions on the
5    verdict form which apply to damages.
6          I don't think there's any question as to
7    what your answer needs to be as far as what
8    damages you would look at, lung cancer causing
9    her death, but let me talk about Lillian for a
10    moment as it relates to her COPD and her lung
11    cancer, and then I'll talk about her death.
12          She was diagnosed in 1994.  She was put
13    on oxygen.  She was routinely diagnosed with
14    severe air flow limitation.  Severe air flow
15    limitation.  She was routinely, at one point,
16    placed on oxygen.
17          She talked to you about how limited her
18    life was.  That's not how her life was supposed
19    to be.  That's not the life that she expected,
20    it's not the life she set out for, but it's
21    certainly not the life she knew she was going
22    to get when she was 12 years old, 17 years old.
23          But that's the life that she had, and
24    that's what you have to consider in determining
25    what her damages are, what amount of money is going to be commensurate with the injury, how
2    to compensate for that injury.
3          And, so, for 18 years -- sorry -- 18
4    years, she lived with her COPD, the limitations
5    that it brought with it, the doctor visits.
6          How many times did she go to the doctor?
7    All of the medications, the emergency inhalers,
8    the oxygen tanks.  Embarrassing as it was, she
9    didn't want to bring her oxygen with her.  She
10    was an independent, strong lady, who didn't
11    want to be dragging around her oxygen tanks.
12          It limited what she was able to do, it
13    limited her interactions with her family.  If
14    Dr. Keller doesn't think that that's a
15    limitation, he's in the wrong business.  What's
16    he doing taking care of folks like that?
17          Severe.  Very limited.  Affected
18    everything about her life.  She talked to you
19    about that.  When she would clean her house,
20    she would have to stop making her bed, take her
21    inhaler, use her oxygen.
22          Well, they asked her, well, you have a
23    dishwasher, don't you?
24          Yeah, I have a dishwasher.
25          It affected every aspect of her life. Her life mattered to her, mattered to
2    Sharon, mattered to her friends, people in her
3    community.  It clearly --
4          From all the evidence that you've seen in
5    this case, from the 1940s up until they were
6    raising their hand, swearing to God to tell the
7    truth in 1994, it is clear that her life did
8    not matter to them, but her life mattered to a
9    lot of people, and specifically to her daughter
10    Sharon.
11          Now, R.J. Reynolds can judge their
12    relationship, if they want to, but Lillian
13    Kaplan was an independent lady who wanted to
14    try to do for herself, who didn't want to be a
15    burden on her daughter, even though her
16    daughter didn't think of her that way, but
17    that's how Lillian wanted to be.  And if they
18    want to judge her for their relationship, I
19    don't even see how that's possible.
20          But her life mattered to Sharon.  She
21    lost her mom.  They were very close.  The
22    evidence is clear.  There's no evidence to the
23    contrary.  They were friends, they were family,
24    and her life mattered to her.
25          And, so, what Reynolds did, what they did over all of those years, was wrong.  What they
2    did to millions -- tens of millions of people
3    like her was wrong.
4          MR. KACZYNSKI:  Objection, Your Honor.
5          THE COURT:  Overruled.
6          MR. McPHARLIN:  And you have to decide
7    how to compensate.  And I know that's
8    difficult.  You have the medical bills.
9    227,000, that's the stipulated amount for her
10    medical bills.
11          Based on her relationship with her
12    daughter, I think the appropriate amount is
13    $4 million.
14          If you decide that her death was caused
15    by smoking, she died from lung cancer, it's
16    obviously a wrongful death case and you have to
17    decide how much money are we going to include
18    in our verdict for that -- for those harms, to
19    compensate for all of those harms, for the life
20    that she would have continued to live with her,
21    the life that they would have continued to have
22    together, $4 million.
23          If you decide that it is not a wrongful
24    death case and that you have to compensate
25    Lillian for those 18 years, for that 18-year period of time, for her COPD and her lung
2    cancer, I think the appropriate amount is
3    $8 million for that period of time.
4          Now, Lillian had the right to have all of
5    the facts.  She had the right to have the
6    truth.  She had the right to know what their
7    product was, what they were doing to it, how
8    addictive it was, and how truly harmful it was.
9          That was her right when she was a child,
10    when she was a teenager, when she was a young
11    adult, for the rest of her life.  That was what
12    they owed her.  They had that responsibility to
13    her and millions of other people like her.
14          And what they chose to do with that
15    responsibility, the responsibility that they
16    had to the public, to their consumers, to the
17    promises that they made to the public, to
18    public health, was concealed.  It's not
19    something that they can dispute anymore.
20          They can't dispute that they concealed
21    what they knew about cigarettes, that they
22    concealed what they knew about how addictive
23    and how harmful their product was.
24          And you heard all of the evidence, you
25    saw what they did, in order to get to that, in order to do that, in order to execute that
2    strategy.
3          Did Lillian Kaplan reasonably rely on any
4    concealment or omission of material information
5    by R.J. Reynolds, concerning the health effects
6    of cigarettes or their addictive nature; and,
7    if such -- if so, was such reliance a legal
8    cause of her loss, injury or damage?
9          And, remember, a legal cause.  It doesn't
10    have to be the only thing that she relied on,
11    it doesn't have to be the only thing that
12    caused her to rely on what they did.  It is a
13    legal cause, their concealment.
14          And did they conceal?  Of course, they
15    did.  They told the world that there was
16    nothing wrong with our product.
17          You heard her.  She remembers a company
18    saying there's nothing wrong, it's okay, it's
19    safe to smoke.  Because that's what they did.
20    That's what they told the public for decades.
21          Did Lillian Kaplan reasonably rely on any
22    act or omission taken by R.J. Reynolds in
23    furtherance of an agreement between the other
24    tobacco companies or organizations to conceal
25    or omit material information concerning the health effects or the addictive nature of
2    smoking cigarettes; and, if so, was such
3    reliance a legal cause?
4          Again, as I told you, Reynolds is
5    responsible for the acts of all of the
6    co-conspirators.  Philip Morris --
7          And you heard, why are we seeing all
8    these documents?  Because they're part of the
9    conspiracy.  Philip Morris, Liggett & Myers,
10    the TI, the TIRC, they were all part of it.
11    They're all primary players in it.  They were
12    all in it together for one purpose:  Protect
13    their profits.
14          They concealed that they formed a
15    conspiracy.  Obviously, Lillian didn't know
16    that.  She didn't know that what they were
17    doing was a big fraud, a big public relations
18    front.
19          She didn't know that they hired
20    scientists and doctors to mislead the public.
21    She didn't know that they were researching and
22    studying nicotine to figure out how they could
23    deliver it faster, to figure out how they could
24    deliver the right amount to make sure that they
25    created and sustained addiction.  She didn't know that one out of two people were going to
2    die.
3          She didn't know they manipulated
4    nicotine, that there were 70 cancer-causing
5    agents in every puff that she inhaled.
6    Arsenic, cyanide.
7          She didn't know filtered cigarettes were
8    no safer and likely more harmful.
9          She didn't know that R.J. Reynolds and
10    their conspirators purposely misled the public
11    about the safety of filters and low-tar
12    cigarettes.  She didn't know any of that.  That
13    was all part of their game.  That was all part
14    of their strategy.
15          She didn't know they met at the hotel and
16    devised this scheme to mislead the public.
17          Isn't it fortunate for us that cigarettes
18    are a habit they can't break?  Boy, wouldn't it
19    be wonderful if our company was the first to
20    produce a cancer-free cigarette?
21          That's 1953.
22          They produced this Frank Statement,
23    interest in people's health as a basic
24    responsibility paramount to every consideration
25    in our business. Totally not true.  A complete false
2    statement.  It was a litigation strategy
3    perpetuated by a public relations campaign.  No
4    doubt or confusion.  Internally, they knew what
5    they were doing.  They knew they were
6    addicting, they knew they were killing people.
7          The individuals we met believe that
8    smoking causes lung cancer.  That's 1958.
9    That's an internal document.  They knew,
10    without a doubt, by 1958, that their cigarettes
11    were causing lung cancer.  They knew it before.
12          They were studying, they were following
13    everything; and while they're following these
14    studies, they're putting out advertising, more
15    doctors smoke Camels, dentists, nurses.
16    They're playing on every feeling, every concept
17    that's going to convince people that it's okay,
18    it's safe to smoke.
19          Carcinogens are found in every --
20    practically every class of compound in smoke.
21    The amount of evidence accumulated to indict
22    the cigarette smoke as a health hazard is
23    overwhelming.  The evidence challenging such an
24    indictment is scant.  That's R.J. Reynolds,
25    1962. This is Brown & Williamson,
2    R.J. Reynolds, 1963:  Cigarettes have certain
3    unattractive side effects.  They cause lung
4    cancer.
5          Lillian Kaplan didn't know they knew
6    this.  They withheld that from her.  They can't
7    come in today and say, she didn't rely on
8    anything.  She smoked their products for
9    decades without this information.
10          They created an atmosphere, a wallpaper
11    of acceptability, that it's okay, it's
12    glamorous, it's no problem.
13          THE COURT:  Five minutes, Counsel.
14          MR. McPHARLIN:  Yes, sir.
15          If this committee had not been formed,
16    the cigarette industry would by now have been
17    in a deplorable position.
18          So that's the -- that's the entity --
19          Remember the TIRC?  That's what they did.
20    They created an organization to perpetuate
21    their public relations campaign.  Not to do
22    science, not to save the public, not to answer
23    the question.  A public relations campaign.
24          Give smokers a psychological crutch and a
25    self-rationale to continue smoking.  That's exactly what they did with their advertising,
2    with their public statements, with their
3    withholding information, concealing what they
4    knew.
5          Filters, doubt is our product.  Lillian
6    Kaplan didn't know that.
7          The most important story is that which
8    casts doubt on the cause-and-effect theory of
9    diseases and -- effect theory of disease and
10    smoking.  For example, a report indicating some
11    factor or factors other than smoking may be
12    involved.
13    14 15    follows:)
16          VOICE:  We want to be the detectives just
17    as much as the Surgeon General and the AMA, and
18    we'll cooperate in every way.
19          VOICE:  Well, obviously, a filter takes
20    out certain tar and nicotine.  I don't think
21    the industry admits there are any bad elements.
22    If there are bad elements, through our
23    laboratories, through the Surgeon Generals,
24    through the AMA, through acts of God and luck,
25    we hope we may find them.  And if they are found, they will be removed.
2          VOICE:  We -- we do talk to the question
3    of whether or not cigarettes are hazardous.  We
4    do not believe that cigarettes are hazardous.
5    We don't accept that, because when, as and if
6    any ingredient in cigarette smoke is identified
7    as being injurious to human health, we are
8    confident that we can eliminate that
9    ingredient.
10          VOICE:  Do you believe that cigarettes
11    are safe?  Have they been proven to be safe,
12    Mr. Cullman?
13          VOICE:  I believe they have not been
14    proven to be unsafe.
15          (Video clip concluded.)
16          MR. McPHARLIN:  Lillian was asked in her
17    deposition about quitting and about how she
18    thought she had done over the times that she
19    tried to quit.  And she said, if I knew then
20    what I know now...  If she knew then what she
21    knew now.
22          There is no question they concealed from
23    her.  There is no question that she relied on
24    it.  The law --
25          There is no instruction in there that says we have to show she relied on this
2    statement or that statement.  We've shown you
3    what they did, we've shown you their
4    advertising, their marketing.  We've shown you
5    what their own witnesses say that was designed
6    to do.  It was designed to get the public to
7    rely on what we were saying.  And that's what
8    happened.
9          More likely than not, was what they were
10    doing over decades, did it have an impact on
11    her?  More likely than not.
12          For 20 years, the industry has employed a
13    single strategy to defend itself on three major
14    fronts:  Litigation, politics and public
15    opinion.  While the strategy was brilliantly
16    conceived and executed over the years, helping
17    us win important battles -- "win important
18    battles," it should say -- it is only fair to
19    say that it is not, nor was it intended to be a
20    vehicle for victory.  On the contrary, it has
21    always been a holding strategy, consisting of
22    creating doubt about the health charge, without
23    actually denying it.
24          The TIRC, the CTR was an industry shield.
25    Special projects are the best way for -- that monies are spent.  The CTR has acted as a
2    front.  CTR is the best and cheapest insurance
3    for the tobacco industry.
4          In the cigarette controversy, the public,
5    especially those who are present and potential
6    supporters, must perceive and understand and
7    believe in evidence to sustain their opinions
8    that smoking may not be the causal factor.
9    10 11    follows:)
12          VOICE:  Take the controversy about
13    cigarettes.  In the 91st Congress, a house
14    committee heard testimony from leading experts
15    on smoking and health.  The record shows that
16    many of the country's most respected doctors
17    openly challenged anti-cigarette claims.
18          VOICE:  Turning a significant health
19    question into a publicity stunt is an insult to
20    serious science.
21          VOICE:  And I have to disagree with you,
22    in that we don't know what causes the ailments
23    that have been attributed to cigarette smoking.
24          VOICE:  Cigarette smoking does not cause
25    cancer, "yes" or "no"? VOICE:  It is not known whether
2    cigarettes cause cancer.
3          VOICE:  All right, sir.
4          VOICE:  It has not been causally
5    established.
6          VOICE:  Cigarette smoking --
7          No causal relationship between cigarette
8    smoking and emphysema?
9          VOICE:  Despite all of the research to
10    date, there has been no causal link
11    established.
12          VOICE:  The case is still open.  The jury
13    has not come in.
14          VOICE:  It may not be harmful?  You're
15    not convinced?
16          VOICE:  It may be or it may not be.  We
17    don't know.
18          VOICE:  I am saying that the science to
19    date, and over $100 million of our industry,
20    indicates that there is no causal link.
21          VOICE:  They agree that smoking causes
22    lung cancer.  Do you agree?
23          VOICE:  It may.
24          VOICE:  Do you know whether it does?
25          VOICE:  I do not. VOICE:  We don't know what causes cancer
2        in general right now, so I think that we may
3        find out what causes cancer and we may find out
4        some relationship which has yet to be proven.
5              (Video clip concluded.)
6        7     8        follows:)
9        Q.    And they wanted people to be able to
10 believe that and rely upon that, did they not?
11        A.    I believe, in general, yes.
12        Q.    And as late as '88 or '89 or '90, the
13 Tobacco Institute was saying they still didn't know
14 whether smoking caused cancer, correct?
15              That's what they were telling the public,
16 correct?
17        A.    They did not know that, they could not
18 make that determination, is what they said in the
19 video.
20        Q.    And they wanted the people to believe
21 them, correct?
22        A.    I would say they would, yes.
23              (Video clip concluded.)
24              MR. McPHARLIN:  That's R.J. Reynolds'
25        corporate representative.  It was -- The intent was for people to rely, and
2        they knew they were.  Their own research showed
3        that they were.
4              Our basic position in the cigarette
5        controversy is subject to the charge, and
6        subject to a finding that we are making false
7        and misleading statements to promote the sale
8        of cigarettes.
9              Of course they were.  That's what they
10        knew, though.  1968.
11              They knew filters were doing nothing for
12        folks.  Nothing, zero.
13              Cigarette manufacturers have deceived the
14        American public through their advertising of
15        filter-tip cigarettes.  The American public
16        have paid a premium for filter cigarettes for,
17        quote, protection they did not receive.
18              From Lorillard:  Kent was marketed as a
19        safer cigarette for smokers concerned about
20        smoking and health.
21              In 1956, when an innocent third party in
22        Reader's Digest created an awareness to the
23        consumer that Kent was the safest of all
24        popular filter cigarettes, Lorillard exploited
25        this advantage so that within a short period of two years, the Kent volume grew from less than
2        four billion cigarettes to 38 billion.
3              They exploited so many things over so
4        many decades in so many different ways.  That
5        was -- they were experts at exploiting.
6              This is on --
7              This is Brown & Williamson.  Brand image
8        of Carlton, Lillian's last cigarette.
9              Go ahead.
10              The Carlton smokers are -- more freely
11        admit that they wish they didn't smoke at all
12        than with any other brand.  They are desperate,
13        trying to quit, or have not been able to quit
14        and they end up with those.
15        16     17        follows:)
18        Q.    People rely on advertisements.
19 Otherwise, it wouldn't make a difference whether you
20 were truthful or not, right?
21        A.    I think people rely on advertising that
22 they see.
23        Q.    Can you describe for me any circumstances
24 in which a corporation should withhold information
25 from consumers regarding the dangers of its products? A.    No.
2              (Video clip concluded.)
3              MR. McPHARLIN:  So when you get to
4        Questions 4 and 5, based on their own
5        documents, based on their own research, based
6        on their own business records, they knew
7        consumers were relying.
8              Lillian was one of their consumers.  She
9        told you what she heard.  She told you what she
10        knew and understood.  She told you what she
11        believed about what they were saying about
12        their products.  There is no evidence to the
13        contrary.
14              The answers to those questions, 4 and 5,
15        are "yes."  And the reason those are important
16        is because you have to answer one of those
17        questions "yes" in order to get to the last
18        question, which is whether or not, under the
19        circumstances, by clear and convincing
20        evidence, punitive damages are warranted
21        against R.J. Reynolds.
22              And based on everything that you have
23        heard, based on all of the evidence that you've
24        seen, there is no question that R.J. Reynolds
25        should be punished for what they've done, for their reprehensible conduct, for the harm that
2        they have caused.  There is no question that
3        the answer to that is "yes."
4              That requires Phase II, but I assure you,
5        Phase II will be very short.  Our case in
6        Phase II will be about an hour.
7              All right.  So I'm going to sit down.
8        I've eaten up some of my time on the back end,
9        and I want to be able to have an opportunity to
10        talk to you when they're finished.
11              Thank you for listening.


7       MR. McPHARLIN:  I am thick-skinned.  I
8 don't have to like everything I hear.
9       It doesn't matter what he says, what
10 R.J. Reynolds says in this courtroom.  They
11 can't change the past.  Mr. Kaczynski told you
12 that after this trial you should search those
13 document websites.  I agree 100 percent.  I
14 agree it should be a class.
15       It should be a class that's offered in
16 school, so people can see, so children can see
17 the despicable history that they put this
18 country through.  I agree.  Kids, teenagers,
19 should be searching it for hours.
20       You know what would have been great?  If
21 those documents that are now available -- and
22 believe me, you didn't see all of them -- not
23 even close -- those documents that are now
24 available, they should have been available
25 decades ago. The truth in those business records
2 should have been available decades ago.  I
3 heard about rewriting history.  Well, that's
4 exactly what you saw in front of you today; an
5 attempt to rewrite history.
6       MR. KACZYNSKI:  Objection, Your Honor.
7       THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, you
8 rely on your own recollection of the evidence.
9 This is argument.  Proceed, Counsel.
10       MR. McPHARLIN:  R.J. Reynolds was a good,
11 responsible company.  They did good things.
12 They were looking out for the public.
13       Tobacco Working Group.  They were
14 researching nicotine, from what we just heard,
15 because they were concerned about the health of
16 consumers.  They were researching nicotine
17 because they were responding to the public
18 health community.
19       That's what you were just told.  It
20 wasn't like we showed you in their documents
21 where they were just jealous of Philip Morris
22 and how well they were doing with kids,
23 teenagers, with Marlboro, with ammonia.
24       No, Mr. Kaczynski just told you they were
25 researching nicotine because they were worried about the consumers.  That's the rest of the
2 story that R.J. Reynolds is telling in 2015.
3 What have they learned?  What has R.J. Reynolds
4 learned from their conduct, from being caught
5 doing what they did?
6       They don't acknowledge today that they've
7 done anything wrong.
8       MR. KACZYNSKI:  Objection, Your Honor.
9       MR. McPHARLIN:  It's testimony, Judge.
10       THE COURT:  Counsel, objection sustained.
11       MR. McPHARLIN:  He talks about the Master
12 Settlement Agreement.  Not one penny goes to
13 victims, not one penny.
14       He talks about all the money that they
15 put into it.  But all that money is after all
16 their profits.  You haven't even heard how much
17 they make, after paying all of those things.
18       He talks about the Tobacco Working Group,
19 another example of them looking out for the
20 public health.  We showed you the documents.
21 It was intelligence-gathering.  They did it so
22 they could keep an eye on the government.
23       We don't believe there's anything wrong
24 with our product.  We don't believe that a
25 safer cigarette needs to be investigated, but we'll participate.
2       And what do they see secretly?  We will
3 work to influence what happens in those groups.
4 We can influence Dr. Gori, because we're paying
5 him a lot of money.  Dr. Gori is worried --
6 he's running the group.  He's worried that
7 people are going to start giving him push-back
8 because he's so tied into the industry.
9       They said in their secret documents that
10 we can try to influence, we can keep an eye on
11 what they're doing.  That's them looking out
12 for the public health?
13       He mentioned the Green Monster, bought
14 and paid for by the tobacco industry, authored
15 by two scientists who have been in their pocket
16 for decades before that.
17       He told you -- use your memory.  But he
18 told you we don't, we don't go after kids.
19 We're not interested in children.
20       1533.  This one is in.  Show this one.
21 Preference-wise, Camel and Winston are shown as
22 holding their shares substantially constant,
23 while Salem increased its share, especially
24 among high school students.  This is in 1959.
25 They were desperate to get kids.  Desperate. Talked about filters, another effort by
2 Reynolds and the industry to look out for the
3 public health.  That's what he told you.
4       This is from one of their head
5 scientists, Dr. Teague:  While use of such
6 color change materials would probably have
7 little or no effect on the actual efficiency of
8 the filter tip material, the advertising and
9 sales advantages are obvious.
10       You can see where their hearts are.
11 They're really worried about people.
12       1958.  I mean, this is just one good,
13 clear example.  We showed you examples from
14 1953 of what they knew.
15       This is from 1958.  Caution: -- causation
16 of lung cancer.  R.J. Reynolds was at this
17 meeting.  This was the industry getting
18 together.  They are meeting, talking about,
19 because they were worried.  They're not worried
20 about health, the sake of the public.  They're
21 worried about their profits.
22       With one exception, HSN Greene, the
23 individuals whom we met believed that smoking
24 causes lung cancer, if by causation we mean any
25 chain of events which leads finally to lung cancer and which involves smoking as an
2 indispensable link.
3       In the USA, only Berkson apparently is
4 now prepared to doubt the statistical evidence,
5 and his reasoning is nowhere thought to be
6 sound.  Hueper of the National Cancer Institute
7 accepts that cigarette smoke is capable of
8 causing lung cancer, but believes that, as
9 compared with other environmental carcinogens,
10 the contribution of smoking to the total
11 mortality from lung cancer is being greatly
12 exaggerated.
13       If by causation we mean any chain of
14 events which leads finally to lung cancer.
15       He spent a little bit of time talking
16 about Lillian Kaplan.  And... I'm glad I do
17 have thick skin.
18       MR. KACZYNSKI:  Objection, Your Honor.
19       THE COURT:  Overruled.
20       MR. McPHARLIN:  An 84-year-old, a million
21 dollars for the passing of an 84-year-old?  Her
22 name was Lillian Kaplan.  Her life mattered.
23 Her life mattered to her family.  Her life
24 mattered to herself.  It obviously did not
25 matter to R.J. Reynolds. The fact that she was 84 means she lived
2 long enough, and it doesn't matter that we took
3 her life?
4       Not debilitating.  She was fine.  Who
5 wants to walk around with an oxygen bottle
6 strapped to their face?  Who wants to sleep on
7 oxygen every night?  Who wants to take
8 emergency inhalers because they can't clean
9 their room, they can't make their bed without
10 using an inhaler?
11       Sounds great to me.  Sounds perfect.
12 Sounds ideal.
13       Mr. Kaczynski told you that Mr. Johnston,
14 the CEO of R.J. Reynolds, was just not given --
15 not given an opportunity to speak his mind.  He
16 just wasn't being treated fairly when he was
17 testifying before Congress.
18       We know what was on his mind.  We know
19 what he thought.  We know what his scientists
20 thought.  We know what the executives thought.
21 They all new their cigarettes caused cancer.
22 They all knew they were addictive.
23       He got up there, and he lied.  He got up
24 there and he spun -- he tried to weasel out of
25 what he knew to be true.  So he was given plenty of opportunity.  They were given decades
2 to tell the truth.
3       Showed you an interrogatory answer,
4 without telling you what the context was,
5 without telling you anything it meant.
6       Lillian Kaplan wasn't looking --
7       VIDEO TECHNICIAN:  Elmo, please.
8       I'm sorry.
9       MR. McPHARLIN:  Lillian Kaplan wasn't
10 pursuing damages other than medical expenses.
11       Do you believe that?  That's what he told
12 you.
13       What are the injuries that you are
14 seeking compensation for in this lawsuit?  I am
15 going to die from this.  I have no other
16 alternatives, because I can't get new lungs.
17       Mr. Kaczynski's rest of the story?
18       Not the rest of the story.  You're going
19 to -- on the verdict form, you're going to get
20 those questions.  And you were told that the
21 Engle findings, which another jury sat through
22 trial and determined and have been upheld by
23 the Florida Supreme Court, made findings.
24       And you were told that those findings
25 don't mean anything to this case, don't mean anything to Lillian Kaplan.  Well, those
2 findings apply to Lillian Kaplan.  Once you get
3 past question 1, those findings apply.
4       And the Engle findings tell you that the
5 defendant, R.J. Reynolds, concealed or omitted
6 material information not otherwise known or
7 available, knowing that the material was false
8 or misleading or failed to disclose a material
9 fact concerning the health effects or addictive
10 nature of smoking cigarettes, or both.
11       That's what R.J. Reynolds did.  That
12 finding applies to that.
13       The defendants agreed with other
14 companies and industry organizations to conceal
15 or omit information regarding the health
16 effects of cigarettes or their addictive
17 nature, with the intention that smokers and the
18 public would rely on this information, to their
19 detriment.
20       With the intention they would rely.  That
21 applies to Lillian Kaplan.
22       Those companies include RJR Nabisco,
23 Inc., Lorillard, Brown & Williamson,
24 individuals, American Tobacco, and a list of
25 others, all because they were involved, all because they were in agreement together.  All
2 of those findings apply.  These findings may
3 not be denied or questioned by you.  They must
4 carry the same weight as if you had determined
5 them yourselves.
6       As if you had determined them yourself.
7       They were never interested in the
8 public's health.  The only thing they were
9 interested in were huge profits.  Look at the
10 documents.  You want to talk about what they
11 were interested in?  I don't have it at my
12 fingertips.
13       There's plenty of documents in there for
14 you to look at.  They talk about how they are
15 looking at trends.  They are seeing trends in
16 the 12 to 17-year-old age group, going down for
17 one of their brands.  This is R.J. Reynolds.
18       And they are talking about how they
19 can -- what they're going to do, what do we
20 have planned this year to reverse that trend?
21 That's not R.J. Reynolds interested in
22 targeting teens and getting kids?
23       1975.  Expand nationally, "Meet the
24 Turk."  To increase our young adult franchise.
25 To ensure increased and long-term growth -- growth -- for the Camel filter, the brand must
2 increase its share penetration among 14 to
3 24-year-olds.  They want to penetrate that age
4 group, 14 to 24.
5       Mr. Kaczynski told you we're not
6 interested in kids.  They're not?
7       This is what they told Lillian.  You can
8 see the proof of Kent's health protection.
9       More scientists and educators smoke Kent
10 with the Micronite filter.  More doctors smoke
11 Camel.  Dentists, nurses.
12       Mr. Kaczynski thinks, we've been punished
13 enough.  How have they been punished?  How have
14 they been punished for what they did to Lillian
15 Kaplan?  How have they been punished for what
16 they've done to millions of people?  They
17 haven't.
18       They can't even -- did he show you -- did
19 he get up here and say you know what?  We lied,
20 we misled and we concealed.  Absolutely not.
21 He got up and said just about everything else
22 but that.  How is that a company that's
23 changed?  How is that a company that doesn't
24 need to be told you can't do that?  That's not
25 okay. They were after kids; there's no
2 question.  They made a business decision to go
3 after children, they made a business decision
4 to lie, conceal and mislead, to create products
5 that would convince the public that they were
6 giving them a benefit, a health benefit.  Doing
7 something good for them.  That was a business
8 decision R.J. Reynolds made.
9       And they made those business decisions
10 decades ago, and they have harmed millions of
11 people because of their business decisions.
12       What happened is no surprise to them.
13 What happened to Lillian was not a surprise to
14 R.J. Reynolds.  They knew it was going to
15 happen.  They knew it was going to happen over
16 and over and over again.
17       Is their conduct worthy of punishment?
18 How could it not be?
19       Is their conduct worthy of setting an
20 example for other corporations?  How could it
21 not be?
22       Kids were replacement smokers to them.
23 That's what their record said, "replacement
24 smokers."
25       This came in through Dr. Figlar, I think: If the adult rate of smoking were to continue
2 at the present level, the impact of smoking on
3 future health and welfare of today's children
4 would be enormous.  Research has shown that
5 one-fourth or more of all regular cigarette
6 smokers die of smoking-related diseases.
7       If 20 million of the 70 million children
8 now living in the United States smoke
9 cigarettes as adults, 29 percent of them, then
10 at least 5 million of them will die of
11 smoking-related diseases.  This figure should
12 alarm anyone who is concerned with the future
13 health of today's children.
14       That's not R.J. Reynolds.
15       1958, 1959.  They are very interested in
16 how well they're doing with kids.  There is a
17 backlog of youth who have refrained from taking
18 up smoking in the face of the report.  A
19 substantial number of these can be expected to
20 join with this year's crop of prospects to
21 produce a healthy increase in the number of new
22 smokers.
23       R.J. Reynolds.  Many manufacturers have
24 studied the 14-to-20 market in the hopes of
25 uncovering the secret of the instant popularity some brands enjoy, almost to complete exclusion
2 of others.  Creating a fad in this market can
3 be a great bonanza, 14 to 20.
4       This is R.J. Reynolds:  In 1960, this
5 young adult market, the 14-to-24 age group
6 represented 21 percent of the population.  They
7 represent tomorrow's cigarette business.
8       That's not R.J. Reynolds interested in
9 kids?
10       As this 14-to-24 age group matures for at
11 least the next 25 years, it may well be to
12 consider another aspect of our business; that
13 is, factors which induce a pre-smoker -- a kid,
14 a teenager -- or nonsmoker to become a
15 habituated smoker.
16       He does not start to smoke to satisfy a
17 nonexistent craving for nicotine.  Rather, he
18 appears to start to smoke for purely
19 psychological reasons, to emulate a valued
20 image.
21       A valued image they wallpapered across
22 the country.  They made smoking look glamorous,
23 athletic.
24       This is from Lillian.  This is from her
25 2008 deposition.  Mr. Kaczynski told you she never talked about what the companies said,
2 until she had her stroke.  He talked about her
3 stroke a lot.
4       This is '08.  This is 2008:  Because
5 everything was supposed to be so good.  The
6 affidavits from the big shot, the stars, the
7 doctors smoked Camels, the best cigarette.  And
8 Arthur Godfrey smoked his Chesterfields.  Even
9 Perry Como.
10       I saw the original Oceans 11 on TV a few
11 weeks ago.  Every one of them smoked.  Nothing
12 was ever said.  And this was well until the
13 '60s and '70s.  Nothing was said, that it was
14 going to kill you.  It's going to hurt you or
15 anything.  I don't remember every hearing it in
16 those days.
17       Did the tobacco companies, my clients,
18 specifically, Philip Morris and Lorillard, ever
19 say it was safe to smoke cigarettes?
20       Yes.  In the beginning, yes.
21       When and what?
22       It's safe, it's tasty.  They had all kind
23 of affidavits from all the people that smoked.
24 There was nothing wrong.
25       So he told you the only time she ever said anything like that was in the deposition
2 after she had her stroke.  Not true.
3       You specifically remember advertisements
4 that it was safe to smoke cigarettes?
5       Yes.
6       Who were those advertisements for, ma'am?
7       You mean what particular brands?  I don't
8 even remember.  I just lumped them all
9 together.  Smoking was smoking.
10       So your instructions don't tell you what
11 brand was the statement or act associated with.
12 What company was it associated with?  We don't
13 have to do that.  The reason we don't have to
14 do that, they were involved together.  They
15 were conspirators in a strategy to keep people
16 smoking.  They are all part of the conspiracy.
17       I don't have to show you this one said
18 that or this one said this.  That's not what
19 the law is.  If it was the law, it would be in
20 your instructions.
21       They were in it together.
22       This is RJ Reynolds on the right here
23 too.  1972.  We already did this one on the
24 left.
25       Realistically, if our company is to survive, we must prosper -- prosper, profits --
2 over the long term, we must get our share of
3 the youth market, provide sufficient motivation
4 during the learning period to keep the learner
5 going.
6       Who are they talking about?  A
7 30-year-old, a 40-year-old?  Who is the learner
8 they are talking about?
9       Provide sufficient motivation, during the
10 learning period, to keep the learner going,
11 despite physical unpleasantness and awkwardness
12 of the period.  They are talking about
13 teenagers, getting through the awkward years.
14       What qualities and new image -- image a
15 new brand aimed at the youth market should
16 have.  Moderate level of nicotine delivered at
17 a pH to ensure slow absorption.
18       They don't want to offend them.  They
19 don't want to physically push them away from
20 their product.  They are talking about
21 engineering it so they don't discourage kids
22 from doing it.
23       We have deliberately played down the role
24 of nicotine.  Hence, the nonsmoker has little
25 or no knowledge of what satisfactions it may offer him and no desire to try it.  Instead, we
2 must somehow convince him, with wholly
3 irrational reasons, that he should try smoking,
4 in the hope that he will then for himself
5 discover the real satisfactions attainable.
6       There is zero question that this is a
7 company that deserves punishment.
8       I have to -- I want to --
9       VIDEO TECHNICIAN:  Did you want this one
10 video?
11       MR. McPHARLIN:  Yes.
12 13    14       follows:)
15       VOICE:  -- Special, Peter Jennings
16 reports.
17       VOICE:  Good evening and welcome.  This
18 hour is about cigarettes and the people who
19 make them, which means it is about the only
20 product that you can buy virtually anywhere
21 which, when used as directed, kills more than
22 400,000 Americans every year.
23       VOICE:  When Reynolds pushed the Joe
24 Camel image in the marketplace, they focused on
25 convenience stores, the place most underaged smokers get their cigarettes.
2       VOICE:  If you could push R.J. Reynolds
3 cigarettes to 18-year-olds, would you do it?
4 Would you be expected to do it?
5       VOICE:  Yes.
6       VOICE:  16-year-olds?
7       VOICE:  Yes.
8       VOICE:  15?
9       VOICE:  I would say teenagers, 13 and up.
10       (Video clip concluded.)
11       MR. McPHARLIN:  They're not interested in
12 kids?  Their burden is the statute of
13 limitations.  They have to put the evidence on.
14 They can't give you speculation, well, we don't
15 have all the medical records.  What was in
16 those medical records?  That's not evidence.
17 That's pure speculation.
18       And you know what?  It's their case, it's
19 their claim, right?  They have the burden of
20 proof.  They have to bring in evidence and
21 witnesses to support it.  Did they bring in a
22 single witness who knew her in that time period
23 and said hey, you know what?  I saw her.  She
24 couldn't get up a flight of stairs.  Absolutely
25 not. Did they bring in one person who knew her
2 for her entire life that said she was having
3 respiratory problems, she was having shortness
4 of breath?  No.  The evidence is completely to
5 the contrary.
6       You heard from Dr. Weiner, Dr. Doben.
7 Dr. Doben was a doctor, a medical -- practicing
8 medicine.  He treated her for years and never
9 once diagnosed her with COPD.  And remember, it
10 isn't a cough.
11       The instruction that you have, a disease
12 manifests when it becomes diagnoseable through
13 evaluation of the patient's symptoms.
14 Diagnoseable through the evaluation of the
15 patient's symptoms.
16       Dr. Doben treated her for years and never
17 once diagnosed her with COPD.  He didn't know
18 what was wrong with her.  He finally sent her
19 to a specialist, Dr. Weiner, because at some
20 point she started having respiratory problems.
21       So at some point, he started treating her
22 for it.  But it wasn't before she got here.  It
23 wasn't in New York.  It was after 1991.  And it
24 was 1994 when he sent her to Dr. Weiner.
25       Dr. Weiner told you it is very common for people not to know -- first of all, they
2 haven't even proven to you that she had COPD
3 before then.  That's their burden.  They have
4 to prove to you that she has it.  Then they
5 have to prove to you that she knew or should
6 have known.
7       And it's a very common way for us to make
8 the diagnosis of COPD; either in the office or
9 maybe the first time they ever get sick is the
10 first time they are hospitalized with their
11 breathing issues.  We make the diagnosis that
12 way.  That was Dr. Weiner.
13       Dr. Keller talking about Dr. Doben:
14 Well, look, they are not specialists.  I mean,
15 Dr. Doben could be a very fine general
16 practitioner, but he's not a specialist.  And
17 many times, they don't have that level of
18 awareness about certain diseases, and we see
19 that infrequently -- we see that frequently in
20 COPD.
21       And as I said before, patients with COPD
22 many times go undiagnosed for many years.  Even
23 after they've been seeing their primary doctor
24 on a regular basis.  So this is something that
25 we see in our daily practice. Dr. Doben doesn't have the level of
2 awareness after treating her for years, but
3 Lillian Kaplan is supposed to have that level
4 of awareness.  She's supposed to know, despite
5 the fact that her doctor doesn't know.
6       It can't be based on speculation.  It
7 can't be based on a cough.
8       Lillian Kaplan knowing she had a cough
9 from smoking is not COPD.
10       Lillian Kaplan knowing she has a cough
11 because smoking might irritate her throat is
12 not COPD.
13       That is not the standard.  That's not the
14 proof.
15       Dr. Keller:  No evidence that anybody
16 noticed shortness of breath before 1990.
17       Correct.
18       She did not have dyspnea on exertion
19 based on your review of the records prior to
20 1990.
21       Remember, they read a lot of depositions,
22 they looked at a lot of medical records.
23       And you have seen no evidence of chronic
24 shortness of breath prior to 1990, true?
25       Right. Dr. Kaplan:  So in your opinion, she
2 didn't know she had a medical condition prior
3 to that time?  Talking about up until 1994.
4       Correct.
5       That was caused by smoking.
6       Correct.
7       Not just the known risks, but the person
8 believes they have a medical or psychological
9 problem as a consequence of the substance.  And
10 the first time she believed that was when she
11 saw Dr. Weiner.  He tells her, she stopped.  So
12 she would not fulfill that.
13       From Lillian:  Did you ever experience
14 any difficulty breathing during the time you
15 lived in New York?
16       No.
17       No competent evidence to suggest
18 otherwise, except a cough.
19       From Dr. Keller:  And it is not unusual
20 at all for somebody to have COPD and be unaware
21 of it, right?
22       Yes, they can have it -- in fact, they
23 can have COPD for many years without being
24 aware of it.
25       And it doesn't matter what anybody else knew, doesn't matter what anybody else thought
2 or believed.  It's what Lillian -- what is the
3 evidence that Lillian Kaplan knew that she had
4 COPD?
5       And again, she cannot be held to a higher
6 standard than her own physician who didn't
7 know; who Dr. Keller says isn't skilled enough
8 to know, but Lillian Kaplan is supposed to be
9 skilled enough to know.
10       Dr. Kaplan, he takes some extreme
11 positions.  And by his standard, nobody is
12 addicted.  By his standard, addiction doesn't
13 influence anyone's smoking.
14       Those are extreme positions.  That's what
15 they brought you to rebut the fact that she was
16 addicted.
17       They talked about common sense.  I
18 embrace that.  Use your common sense, of
19 course.  Common sense will tell you Lillian
20 Kaplan was addicted.  She was heavily addicted.
21       The evidence is, without anything to
22 rebut it, that she tried to quit.
23       You know, all you have is Dr. Kaplan's
24 subjective opinion.  His opinion about whether
25 she tried hard or not doesn't mean a thing. He wasn't there with her, he wasn't there
2 with her kids.  Her kids testified to how hard
3 it was on her.  She was sick in bed sometimes
4 when she would try to quit.  That's how sick
5 she felt.  That's what people go through.
6       All right?  To suggest that Lillian
7 Kaplan wasn't addicted, not even one day, not
8 for one second, not for one minute, not for the
9 50 years that she smoked shows you his opinion
10 is not credible.
11       And the evidence is that it was hard on
12 her, very hard on her.
13       Where's the evidence otherwise?  Where
14 are the people that were involved in her life
15 over the course of all those years?  You know
16 what, I knew her, I didn't see that.
17       MR. KACZYNSKI:  Objection, Your Honor.
18       THE COURT:  Sustained.
19       MR. McPHARLIN:  Her lung cancer was not
20 caused by smoking.  Their own expert says it
21 was, Dr. Bishopric.  There is no evidence to
22 the contrary.
23       There is no expert that they produced,
24 except Dr. Keller, who doesn't -- isn't an
25 oncologist or a pathologist. Dr. Villa -- there is just no evidence to
2 suggest otherwise.
3       Oh, yeah.  Even Dr. Keller admitted she
4 had two risk factors.  Two risk factors, age
5 and smoking.  He doesn't know what caused her
6 lung cancer.  But the only two risk factors
7 that he was aware of were age and smoking.
8       And just by the way, age is the same risk
9 factor that a group of people that Dr. Villa
10 talked about, that .04 that never smoked, age
11 would be in that group too, along with
12 genetics, along with all the other things that
13 raise a nonsmoker's risk for lung cancer.
14       Remember, this is what R.J. Reynolds
15 said.  Mr. Kaczynski brought up 1982.  What was
16 R.J. Reynolds saying in 1982, on the right
17 here?
18       Most of those who have smoked for any
19 significant time would like to stop.
20       That's Lillian Kaplan.
21       Many, but not most of those who would
22 like to stop are able to do so.
23       That was Lillian Kaplan.  That's what
24 R.J. Reynolds knew about their customers.  They
25 can come in today and say anything they want. But this is what they knew.
2       This is what they said privately when
3 they thought nobody else was looking, that
4 nobody else would hear or listen to, ever.
5       However, we cannot ever be comfortable
6 selling a product which most of our customers
7 would stop using if they could.  That is to
8 say, if the exit gate from our market should
9 suddenly open, we could be out of business
10 almost overnight.
11       That was their only concern.  Business.
12 Everything was a business decision for them.
13       What to do in 1953 when the science
14 started coming out.  What to do in 1964 when
15 the Surgeon General Report came out.  What to
16 do in response to the Surgeon General getting
17 the report ready.
18       That was a business decision for them.
19 You saw the documents.
20       We can't give them what we know.  We're
21 not giving them this.  We're not giving them
22 that.
23       It was a business decision to withhold
24 what they knew.  It was a business decision in
25 1964 when the report came out. It was a business decision in 1988 when
2 the Surgeon General came out and said it was
3 addictive.  And they came out with guns blazing
4 that he was reckless, crazy.  Smoking's not
5 addictive.  Nicotine's not a drug.
6       They'd been saying it for decades before
7 that, in their private conversations,
8 obviously.  In the conversations they thought
9 nobody was listening to, when they would send
10 their memos to each other talking about how we
11 can get more of these kids or what we can do to
12 boost our image with these people.
13       THE COURT:  Ten minutes, Counsel.
14       MR. McPHARLIN:  I'm sorry?
15       THE COURT:  Ten minutes.
16       MR. McPHARLIN:  You know, it's one thing
17 to make a product that you know is addictive.
18 Sell it to children, get -- let them get
19 hooked, let them ingrain it into their life,
20 and then to judge them and judge how they
21 struggle trying to stop using that. Okay?
22       Why would Sharon beat up on her mom?  Why
23 would she beat up on her when she was trying to
24 quit smoking?
25       Do you think Lillian wanted -- of course she did.  We know what she felt.  She hated
2 herself.
3       So they say:  Oh, she said, leave me
4 alone.
5       Well, who wants to be constantly reminded
6 that you're failing at something?
7       There is no evidence to contradict that
8 she tried quitting over decades.  And so if
9 that bothered her, which it obviously did, from
10 her testimony, would we expect anything less
11 than for it to bother her?  For her not to want
12 to fight with her kids about it?
13       Her daughter wanted her to quit smoking.
14 Lillian wanted to quit smoking.  Her son wanted
15 her to quit smoking.  Even he struggled at
16 quitting.
17       This is not a case where somebody ran a
18 stop sign.  Somebody was playing with their
19 radio and blew a red light and made a mistake.
20       This wasn't a mistake.  Nothing
21 R.J. Reynolds did was by accident.
22       The strategy that R.J. Reynolds and
23 Philip Morris and Lorillard and American
24 Tobacco and Brown & Williamson and Liggett,
25 when they got together and they decided how they were going to handle this situation, how
2 they were going to respond to the science, that
3 wasn't a mistake.
4       It was deliberate, it was intentional.
5 It was a litigation strategy designed to
6 protect their profits.  Not to protect health,
7 not to protect the public, not to protect
8 people like Lillian Kaplan.
9       And, you know, they did it knowing what
10 the result would be.  They did it knowing that
11 people were going to die.
12       And they watched hundreds of thousands of
13 people die every year, every decade.
14       And I think I heard the words:  You can't
15 just put your head in the sand.
16       They didn't just put their heads in the
17 sand.  They stuck their head out loud and
18 clear.  They denied it, they refuted it.  They
19 went on national television, they went on Ted
20 Koppel, Nightline.  They swore before Congress.
21       They were the manufacturer of the
22 product.  They were telling the public:  We
23 know our product better than anybody else.  The
24 science isn't there, the government is wrong.
25 They are just trying to get into your business. They are just trying to interfere with you
2 doing what you want to do in life.  There's no
3 proof that it causes any harm.
4       When a corporation behaves that way, when
5 a corporation acts and causes harm, they are
6 responsible for the harms, all of the harms.
7 All of them.
8       And they don't get a pass because they
9 make a lot of money and they can pay the Master
10 Settlement Agreement.
11       They don't get a pass for their conduct.
12 They don't get a pass for the lives that
13 they've taken, the lives who are going to
14 continue to be taken.
15       You know, you watched the video of
16 Lillian Kaplan, and you watched her struggling
17 to breathe.  It wasn't just her stroke, it
18 wasn't just her voice.  You watched what she
19 was going through.  You watched how hard it was
20 for her.
21       She had been -- cancer had been killing
22 her for a while and obviously nobody knew it.
23 She had been losing weight for a while.  They
24 want you to think that everything was just
25 fine. But even if we just captured that one
2 year, the torment that she went through for
3 that one year, that R.J. Reynolds caused, that
4 R.J. Reynolds could have avoided.
5       They are the ones who decided to go down
6 the path that they went down, right?  They are
7 the ones who decided to try to convince people
8 to keep smoking.
9       It wasn't like they stood off on the
10 sidelines and let everybody make their own
11 decisions.
12       They actively got out there and said
13 there's nothing wrong with our product.  If a
14 car company comes out and says, you know what,
15 there's nothing wrong with our tires.  There's
16 nothing wrong with our seat belts.  The
17 government test data, the crash data is just
18 not accurate.
19       If they were lying, if they were
20 withholding information, they would be
21 responsible for all the harms that they caused,
22 right?
23       There's no difference.  But the
24 difference is, you know what?  They did it for
25 decades.  The difference is they tricked as many people in the public health as they could.
2 They tricked doctors, they tricked scientists.
3 It was an elaborate, elaborate plan for which
4 they spent hundreds of millions into the
5 billions of dollars.  To do what?  So they
6 could continue to make billions and billions of
7 dollars.
8       Dr. Kaplan said one thing that I agree
9 with.  That Lillian Kaplan was a nice, decent,
10 caring, dedicated, committed lady who did not
11 deserve what she got from R.J. Reynolds or
12 Lorillard or Brown & Williamson or American
13 Tobacco.
14       Thank you.
