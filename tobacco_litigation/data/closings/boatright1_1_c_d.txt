16       MR. REILLY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
17       Good morning, everybody.
18       JURORS:  Good morning.
19       MR. REILLY:  I want to start my closing
20 argument where I began my opening statement,
21 and that is by thanking you guys for your
22 service.
23       This is the beginning of our, what,
24 fourth week together, but who's counting,
25 right?

1       It's a tremendous service that you do, no
2 question about it.  I have an hour and 20
3 minutes.  So let me just be brief and say thank
4 you very much on behalf of myself, Philip
5 Morris, and frankly on behalf of everybody
6 involved.
7       Okay.  Now, when I stood before you in my
8 opening statement, I said that I was confident
9 that what I was telling you in my opening
10 statement was going to be the evidence would,
11 in fact, be the evidence.
12       And I told you that you would see -- you
13 can see I've got -- I don't have a computer
14 system that puts a hat on somebody's head.
15 What I've got are some old-fashioned boards.
16       But I told you in my opening statement
17 that I believed what I was telling you then
18 would be the evidence.
19       I was confident enough about it that I
20 expected to use many of the very same boards
21 when I stood before you in my closing argument.
22 That's exactly what I'm going to do.
23       That same timeline I showed you in my
24 opening statement, I'm going to show you that.
25       I'm going to go through more quickly than

1 I did in my opening statement.  But I've added
2 a few things to it.
3       And remember the board I showed you of
4 the wall of doctors' names.
5       Plaintiff's counsel indicated that this
6 was so easy, it's falling off a log, no issue
7 here about what Mr. Boatright had in the '90s,
8 what was his disease.
9       Remember I showed you the board of a
10 dozen doctors who all diagnosed Mr. Boatright
11 with the very same lung problem.  And what was
12 it?
13       And we went through -- during the course
14 of this trial, we went through medical record
15 after medical record after medical record in
16 the '90s.  And what was the disease?  It was
17 asthma.
18       So I'm going to show you that same list,
19 and I'm going to walk you through some of the
20 medical records, not all of them.  But -- I
21 mean, that took us a long time.  Right?
22       But I started with this board.  That very
23 same board.  And I said, you know what?  Not
24 the medical issue.  Not the issue of what did
25 Mr. Boatright have, what disease was he

1 manifesting in the '90s.
2       But I said:  What is the rest of this
3 case going to be about?  I said it was all
4 going to be about, two words:  Control and
5 responsibility.
6       Because I said in spite of what has been,
7 my goodness, an hour and 15 minutes of closing
8 argument.  How much did you hear about
9 Mr. Boatright in that hour and 15 minutes?
10       And whose lawsuit is this?
11       This is not a class action, ladies and
12 gentlemen.  It's not.
13       This is a lawsuit brought by one smoker
14 about one smoker's decisions.  One smoker's
15 smoking history.
16       And who is that?  It's Mr. Boatright.  It
17 always has been.
18       So the question of control, who is in
19 control of the decisions that Mr. Boatright
20 made in the course of his life regarding his
21 lifestyle?
22       Because as we talked about and as you saw
23 in this jury room -- in this courtroom, we
24 don't live our lives in a silo.  We don't just
25 smoke.  We don't just drink alcohol.  We

1 don't -- we live in an environment.
2       So who is in control of Mr. Boatright's
3 lifestyle decisions regarding how he was going
4 to live his life?
5       Who was in control of his decision to
6 begin and continue smoking?  Did you even hear
7 the story of him beginning smoking during his
8 closing argument?
9       Who controlled his decisions to become a
10 regular smoker?  What information did
11 Mr. Boatright have when he decided to smoke his
12 first cigarette, his second cigarette, and all
13 the rest of them, based on his own body and his
14 own life?  Have you heard that in this closing
15 argument?
16       Who controlled his decisions to use
17 smoking as -- did you even hear why he smoked?
18 Did you hear what his pleasure from smoking was
19 in this closing argument?
20       And did anything that Philip Morris ever
21 said or did, or for that matter Liggett, have
22 any substantial impact on Mr. Boatright's
23 decisions regarding whether he began smoking or
24 not?
25       You would have had to have been reminded

1 how he began to smoke to know the answer to
2 that, right?
3       You'd have to know that.  But you didn't
4 even hear it in his closing argument.
5       And what else did I say?  I said when you
6 knew the answers to these questions about
7 control, then you could address the question of
8 responsibility.
9       Judge Radabaugh has already read to you
10 the acknowledgment on the part of the
11 plaintiff.
12       He knows that he was in control of his
13 decisions about smoking, because he's
14 acknowledged that he has responsibility for
15 whether he did or he didn't quit.
16       It's in the instructions that the judge
17 just read to you.  The instructions that each
18 one of you will have a copy of.  Each one.
19       And then you'll get to determine to what
20 extent, if any, Philip Morris -- sure, Philip
21 Morris made the cigarettes that he chose to
22 smoke.  He liked their brand better than any
23 other one, and he said that.
24       All right.  And I said, well -- in my
25 opening statement, I said in order for you guys

1 to know the answer to these questions -- oh,
2 you know what, I should back up a step and say
3 I told you that those words "control" and
4 "responsibility" wouldn't be in the Court's
5 instructions.
6       I was half right.  "Control" is not in
7 the instructions, but "responsibility" is.
8 It's in the instructions over and over and over
9 again.
10       And I said that Judge Radabaugh was going
11 to read you pages of instructions filled with
12 legal terms, and he has.  And he was going to
13 read you a verdict form, pages filled with
14 legal terms.  And he has.
15       But they still all boil down to these two
16 words really, with the exception of the class
17 membership question.  And that's the medical
18 question.
19       And I said -- you know, I spent the time
20 in my opening statement to walk you through
21 what was the personal history of Mr. Boatright?
22 And that hasn't been done.
23       And why not?  Because when you do walk
24 through that personal history, then you know
25 the answers to these two questions.

1       So as I said, I want to spend the bulk of
2 my time going through this closing argument
3 just reviewing with you what that story was.
4       And I want to go back to the '50s.  You
5 know, Mr. Schlesinger said, oh, this was big
6 news about nicotine.
7       I can take you all the way back.
8 Remember Reader's Digest?  I put them in
9 evidence.  They are in evidence.  There's
10 Reader's Digests going all the way back to the
11 '20s, talking about why do people smoke?  For
12 nicotine.  Was this some secret?  There was no
13 secret.
14       If you want to, I've put in evidence the
15 examples of Reader's Digest articles, examples
16 of the newspaper articles that were occurring
17 in the '50s, magazine articles occurring in the
18 '50s, like this Life Magazine article,
19 communicating to the American public the
20 avalanche of information that was coming out,
21 telling the American public about the medical
22 advances that were occurring in the '50s,
23 connecting smoking with lung cancer.
24       You know -- and I'm not going to spend
25 hardly any time on the '50s, because you know

1 Mr. Boatright was born into a family of
2 smokers.
3       He was born January 1, 1953.  His mom
4 smoked, his dad smoked.  They weren't together
5 very long.  His mom took off.  His stepmom
6 shows up.  What was it, 1955 or thereabouts.
7       She smoked.  His older brothers smoked.
8 Ultimately, his younger brother's going to
9 smoke.  The uncles that lived with him smoked.
10       And you've heard from Dr. Proctor, their
11 witness, when I cross-examined him, you know,
12 you live in an environment like that, who
13 influences you to either begin or not begin
14 smoking?
15       And he said these people around you, your
16 environment.  And you know that's true.
17       And, in fact, who else contributes to
18 that environment are your peers.  And when we
19 get to Mr. Boatright's first cigarette, we're
20 going to see the influence of his peers.
21       Is he sitting there thinking about a
22 Marlboro ad with a middle-aged man riding a
23 horse?  Or is he being influenced by his best
24 friends?  His best friends.
25       All right.  You know that they smoked.

1 You know -- you know what?  We showed you the
2 news programs.  Of course he's a child.  He's a
3 baby here.  But this is the atmosphere in
4 which -- this is what's going on in the United
5 States.
6       You know that in 1957, when he was
7 5 years old, he had -- maybe it wasn't his
8 first serious episode of asthma, but you know
9 he had such a serious episode of asthma that he
10 had a doctor come stay at his house overnight
11 just to make sure he could breathe through the
12 night.
13       This is a story -- did you hear about
14 asthma in that closing argument?  Did you hear
15 the word "asthma" in that closing argument?
16 No, you didn't.
17       But you know that Mr. Boatright had
18 severe asthma throughout his life.  And you
19 know that he had restrictions put on him as a
20 child, restrictions on what he could and
21 couldn't do.  The physical restrictions,
22 because he had such severe asthma.
23       And you know that by the time the '50s
24 had ended, what is going on in the United
25 States?  There are 13 million Americans who

1 have quit smoking and millions more who didn't
2 start.  Why?  Because of all the information
3 that's out about the health risks of smoking.
4       By the time Mr. Boatright gets out of his
5 childhood, he's been hospitalized twice for
6 severe asthma.
7       Mr. Boatright, at age 10 was tested for
8 allergies.  He was so allergic to everything,
9 his allergies were very serious.  Very severe.
10       You know that in 1964, the Surgeon
11 General's report came out.  You know that
12 Mr. Boatright -- you saw the coverage.  You saw
13 the news coverage.
14       There is a CBS -- I'm not going to play
15 it for you, but there is the CBS Special News
16 Report.  You know how Harry Reasoner ends it.
17       He says:  You know what?  Now it's up to
18 you folks.  Filters aren't going to save you,
19 smoking causes lung cancer.  Now it's up to you
20 to decide whether or not you're going to start
21 smoking or continue to smoke or quit.
22       That's what's going on in the American
23 public.  And there is no question about it.
24 You saw the newscasts.  And it was on every
25 station.

1       And Mr. Boatright, even though he was
2 only 11 years old at the time, the media
3 coverage was so vast and so powerful that
4 Mr. Boatright said he remembered it.  When he
5 got on the stand, he acknowledged that he could
6 actually remember that newscast.  That news
7 coverage.
8       Did that prevent Mr. Boatright from
9 beginning smoking?  No.
10       You know that his stepmother who he said
11 was physically -- would use physical punishment
12 had said no smoking.
13       You heard that his dad said that because
14 of his asthma, he said my dad would have been
15 very concerned about me being a smoker because
16 of my asthma.  That's his testimony.
17       With that knowledge, knowing that if he
18 gets caught by Doris smoking, he's going to get
19 physically punished, he still does what?
20       When his buddies come over -- his two
21 friends came over when he was -- how old was
22 he?  Was he 12?  Was he 13?  Was he 14?
23       In the answers to interrogatories, he
24 said:  The first time I began smoking Marlboros
25 was when I was 14 years old.

1       I don't know what the real age is, but is
2 it 12?  Is it 13?  Is it 14?
3       The only variable there is, was the
4 warning already on the packs?  You know this
5 warning was put on the packs as of January 1,
6 1966.
7       Did the warnings on the packs prevent
8 Mr. Boatright when his friends came over and
9 they had swiped cigarettes from their moms and
10 dads, and they came over and said, hey,
11 Richard, come on with us, swipe a cigarette out
12 of your stepmom's pack, let's go across the
13 street.  Let's hide behind the shed and let's
14 smoke a cigarette.
15       You know that's how it happened.
16       I asked Mr. Boatright:  Why did you go
17 ahead and start smoking?
18       He said:  Well, all the cool kids were
19 smoking.
20       He wanted to be one of the cool kids.  He
21 wanted to be with his friends.  Peer pressure.
22 What makes people decide whether or not they're
23 going to smoke or drink or whatever.  Peer
24 pressure.
25       It was just something to do.

1       You were doing it to be a little
2 rebellious, right?
3       I think yeah, to a point, yeah.
4       Yeah, that's right.
5       And you know that in 1967,
6 Mr. Boatright -- first he's got the parents
7 that he's living with.  His dad and stepmom
8 don't want him to smoke.
9       Then he goes to live with his natural
10 mother in Orlando for several months in 1967,
11 and you know that he said, she told me not to
12 smoke.
13       And by the way, I also asked him -- I had
14 to sort of drag this out of him.  I don't know
15 if you remember this or not.
16       But I had to remind him from his
17 deposition what he'd said about his personal
18 knowledge when he smoked that first cigarette
19 because of his asthma, whether he didn't know
20 that that would be potentially bad for him
21 because of his asthma.
22       And here is what he said.
23       I had him read the question at line 10.
24       You knew there was a possibility that
25 cigarette smoking could cause you to have an

1 asthma attack from the time that you smoked
2 your very first cigarette, right?
3       And your answer was:  Whether it sank in
4 or not, I just -- it's been too long ago to
5 remember, while I would assume that cigarette
6 smoking was bad for me.
7       The question was:  You knew enough to
8 know that it might cause you to have a problem
9 from that very first cigarette, whether you
10 dwelled on it or not, you knew it?
11       The answer was:  Yes.
12       Do you remember being asked those
13 questions and giving those answers October 18,
14 2011?
15       His answer was:  Yes.  His answer was
16 yes.  But you didn't hear a word about that in
17 closing argument.
18       Why did he choose Marlboros?  Here is
19 what he said.
20       In terms of the strength of the smoke,
21 that's a matter of personal taste.
22       And your answer was:  For me, it was.
23       And then you were asked:  Okay.  So you
24 liked them, meaning Marlboros, better because,
25 you liked the taste better.  Is that what

1 you're telling me?
2       ANSWER:  They are stronger also.  That's
3 what it says, and I did like Marlboros.  I did
4 like the crush-proof box.  All my brothers
5 smoked Marlboros too.
6       Why did Mr. Boatright choose Marlboros?
7 There you have it.  That's his own testimony.
8       Again, I had to draw it out from his
9 earlier testimony in deposition.
10       His biological mother caught him smoking
11 in Orlando.
12       She caught you smoking.  She told you you
13 shouldn't be smoking because of health reasons
14 and because you were too young, right?
15       I believe that's what she said.  Yes.
16       You hid your smoking from her, right?
17       Well, yes.
18       So here he's got every adult responsible
19 for his well-being telling him, don't smoke.
20       Now, Mr. Schlesinger and Mr. Hammer said,
21 gosh, if we'd just said that smoking causes
22 illness he would never have begun smoking, he
23 would never have smoked.
24       But there you have people directly
25 involved with him.  This is not a class action.

1 This is about one smoker and one smoker only.
2       So now, how long did you stay with your
3 mom there in Orlando in 1967?
4       Not very long.  She had forgotten or
5 never even thought of -- we were not Ozzie and
6 Harriet kids.  She was trying to make us Ozzie
7 and Harriet boys, and we just had our
8 difference of opinions.
9       Now, that's Mr. Boatright describing
10 himself at that age.  And you know more about
11 that story.
12       So is there a serious contention here
13 about what Mr. Boatright -- who was in control
14 of Mr. Boatright's decisions about how he was
15 going to live his life?
16       And yes, he told you at age 15 or 16, he
17 makes another decision for himself about how
18 he's going to live his life.
19       As I said, you don't live your life in a
20 silo.  He goes back to live with his parents,
21 his dad and stepmother.  His mom sends him
22 home, back to Savannah from Orlando, because
23 she really just can't handle him.
24       So he goes back to Savannah, and now he
25 starts drinking beer.  I think he told us that

1 he started racking balls in a pool hall for
2 making money, and he drops out of school in the
3 10th grade.
4       What's he doing?  He's hanging out with
5 his friends, and you know what happens.
6       That takes us through the '60s.
7       Now, public service announcements.  You
8 saw them.
9       I think, Michael, do we have just the
10 figure of Bill Talman?
11       There's Bill Talman.  1300 of these
12 running every year.
13       Mr. Boatright said:  I saw those.
14       They didn't have any effect on him.  He
15 still was going to smoke, and he did smoke.
16       Dr. Proctor said:  That's not so powerful
17 as the ones today.  Ladies and gentlemen, that
18 guy is standing right there telling you, I'm
19 dying and I don't want to die.  That's pretty
20 powerful.
21       Let's go to the '70s.
22       You know the story of Mr. Boatright
23 joining the Marines.  You know the whole story,
24 all right?
25       That same year that he joins the Marines,

1 the warning changes on every pack of
2 cigarettes.
3       Now it says:  Warning, the Surgeon
4 General has determined that cigarette smoking
5 is dangerous to your health.
6       And you have an instruction from the
7 Judge that says, you know what?  That's --
8 that's the warning that's necessary.  You can't
9 criticize Philip Morris for not warning more
10 than that.  That's a reasonable warning.
11       He goes to the Marines.  Can
12 Mr. Boatright quit smoking when he's
13 sufficiently motivated to do so?  Sure.
14       Guess what?  He goes to boot camp.  Now,
15 he hasn't told them about his asthma, and does
16 he have severe asthma?  You know he does.
17       But for the first two, two and a half
18 weeks of boot camp, you can't smoke.  You're in
19 Marines boot camp.
20       Mr. Boatright said:  I didn't get to
21 smoke until -- the smoking lamp was lit
22 sometime after the first two weeks for 20
23 minutes, time enough to smoke a cigarette,
24 maybe two.
25       Could -- and Mr. Boatright said, hey, I

1 didn't smoke, of course not.
2       Because he was sufficiently motivated by
3 the U.S. Marine Corps not to smoke, in boot
4 camp, right?
5       But as you know, he was discharged
6 because of his asthma, and he went back to
7 Savannah, and he began to live that same
8 lifestyle of hanging out with his buddies.
9       Then he's going to stay there until
10 sometime in the late part of 1970.  And this is
11 really interesting.
12       Because I asked him, so -- he said he
13 started dividing his time between his dad's
14 house and his mom's house.  His dad in
15 Savannah, his mom in Orlando, right?
16       And toward the ends of 1970, I said:
17 You're living in Orlando at the end of 1970?
18       I think so.
19       So you were staying at your mother's
20 house, your natural mother's house in Orlando
21 dating Donna.
22       But remember in late 1970s, he starts to
23 date Donna Grant, the lady that becomes the
24 first Mrs. Boatright, right?
25       He says:  You were married in December of

1 1970, but you don't remember for how many
2 months before that you had been living in
3 Orlando?
4       I do not.
5       Once you started living in Orlando with
6 your mom and dating Donna, did you just stay in
7 Orlando to date Donna?
8       Yeah, I kind of grew apart from my best
9 buddies, you know, Ronny and Daniel, the guys
10 he had been hanging out with.  I mean, I just
11 kind of grew apart.
12       Well, what did he tell you -- he said:  I
13 saw Joe Cullman on "Face the Nation" on
14 January 3, 1971 sitting at my dad's house with
15 my stepmom, the hated stepmom, noon on Sunday
16 morning.
17       Well, he just got through telling you,
18 I'm sorry, he was in Orlando with his natural
19 mother, dating Donna.
20       Last time I looked, you can't be two
21 places at the same time.  But he admitted that
22 he found that clip of Joe Cullman on "Face the
23 Nation" after this lawsuit started when he was
24 cruising the internet, looking for stuff like
25 that.

1       MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge, misstates
2 the evidence.
3       THE COURT:  Overruled.
4       MR. REILLY:  There is an instruction here
5 about the credibility of witnesses, and you
6 guys get to decide about the credibility of
7 witnesses.
8       He meets, dates, marries his first wife
9 Donna.
10       1971, no more Marlboro ads on television
11 or radio.
12       1972, that warning goes on every ad.
13       1972, he begins working for Arthur Murray
14 dance studio, right?  And now you heard about
15 his lifestyle.  It's dancing, it's partying,
16 it's smoking, it's drinking.
17       He said at this point the one element
18 that hadn't been there in the time that he'd
19 been hanging out with his buddies was
20 traveling.  No more traveling.
21       But you learned that he and the first
22 Donna Boatright had an off and on again, off
23 again and on again marriage.  They get divorced
24 once, they get divorced twice.  They have a
25 child and then he's gone.

1       Divorced his first wife in 1975.  That's
2 the same time that he gets a -- this is -- I
3 almost let this one go by.
4       He said:  You saw the interview of Joe
5 Cullman, the CEO of Philip Morris, on "Face the
6 Nation."  Do you remember the date?
7       No, I know it was '71.
8       You went on the internet and searched and
9 found that TV clip, didn't you?
10       That's how I found it.
11       So there you go.  It's in black and
12 white.  It's -- transcript.  That's right out
13 of the court reporter's transcript in this
14 trial.
15       MR. HAMMER:  Objection.  He's left out
16 part of that answer.
17       THE COURT:  Overruled.
18       MR. REILLY:  So what you're saying is
19 that you have a distinct memory of sitting down
20 in the late morning with Doris and the two of
21 you watching "Face the Nation" on TV?
22       I don't remember exactly where I was
23 sitting, but I do remember it came on.
24       Those two stories, ladies and gentlemen,
25 do not fit.

1       Now, 1975, he gets a call from his buddy
2 Don Mann up in New York, up in Buffalo.
3       You moved up to New York because you had
4 a friend up there by the name of Don Mann?
5       Yes, he was there.
6       That's the reason you went to New York?
7       That's correct.
8       You went up there because he told you
9 that there was a lot of people, a lot of
10 parties, and a lot of what you described as
11 blah, blah, blah.  Right?
12       Yeah.  Don was the coach, my teacher,
13 and, yeah, he did say that.
14       So now why did he go to Buffalo?
15 Parties, people and blah, blah, blah, whatever
16 that is.
17       But you know what it is.  It's parties,
18 dancing, drinking, smoking, and now traveling.
19       And you know that that's where he begins
20 to -- when he meets Donna Conliffe, the
21 pulmonary nurse who came here and testified
22 under subpoena.  She's a neonatal nurse now.
23 You saw her.
24       She went to Arthur Murray dance studio to
25 get dance lessons, and he was there.  He wanted

1 to sell her dance lessons, then he ends up
2 wanting to date her.
3       And while they're dating, as a pulmonary
4 nurse, what does she do?  You remember.
5       Mr. Boatright is -- this is 1975.  He's
6 what, 22, 23 years old.
7       And she is very blunt with him.  And she
8 tells him:  Hey, look, you're an asthmatic.
9 You're smoking.  That's the worst thing you can
10 possibly do for yourself.
11       She works in the Community Hospital in
12 the pulmonary ward.  She's taking care of the
13 patients who have lung cancer, emphysema, who
14 are dying of smoking-related illnesses.
15       And she says to him, I told him that's
16 probably the worst thing in the world to do for
17 asthma is to smoke.
18       She had been in nursing school.  She had
19 a cadaver that she worked on.
20       She said:  I told him I had a human
21 cadaver with black lungs that had been a
22 smoker.  I told him that.  I said it's a coffin
23 nail.  You might as well just write yourself a
24 death warrant.
25       She offered to take him to the Roswell

1 Park Cancer Center right there in Buffalo, and
2 she said:  Look, there is a wall of all the
3 movie stars who have died from smoking-related
4 illnesses.
5       And I offered to take him down there and
6 show him that wall to convince him that he
7 really needed to stop smoking, because this was
8 a death warrant for him if he continued to
9 smoke.
10       Then I asked her:  So what was his
11 response?  What did he tell you about what he
12 wanted to do?
13       And she said:  He said nobody is going to
14 tell me what to do.  I'll stop if I want to
15 stop.  I don't want to stop.  I like it.  It
16 relieves my stress.  I'm fine.  Everybody in my
17 family smokes.  Nothing is going to happen to
18 me.  Quit griping to me.  Just arguing.
19       Now, that's the story you didn't hear.
20 Well, of course, you didn't hear it.
21       All right.  Very, very bottom, the part I
22 didn't read.
23       I said:  Did he ever tell you that he
24 didn't understand what you said?
25       No.

1       Or that he disagreed or that he was
2 uninformed?  Or he said, gosh, I don't
3 understand you, this isn't right.  I've seen
4 the guys on television or somewhere from Philip
5 Morris or some cigarette company, and you're
6 wrong, they're right.  Something like that?
7       That never happened.
8       Let's go to the '80s.
9       You know that he is with her -- they are
10 married for a total of five years, but they're
11 only together for, what, 15 months?
12       By 1978, when their child is born, he's
13 gone, right?  Last time she sees him is when
14 their son is 10 days old.
15       Before that -- and what was his
16 lifestyle?  You saw it.  Partying, dancing,
17 drinking, smoking; whole shooting match.  But
18 traveling, leaving the house a lot, coming back
19 sometimes.
20       She said one of the times that he came
21 back, she made a condition for him coming back
22 that he quit smoking.
23       Could he quit smoking when he was
24 sufficiently motivated to do so?
25       You heard her say:  You know what?  For

1 the two weeks that he remained around, I never
2 saw him smoke.  Never saw him smoke.
3       But two and a half weeks later, he's
4 gone.  Right?
5       1981.  You heard the quote from
6 Dr. Proctor.  He said:  By 1981, 95 percent of
7 the Americans are aware of the health risks of
8 smoking and 90 percent realize their health
9 could be affected.
10       Is Mr. Boatright in that crowd?  Of
11 course he is.  He's just had a registered nurse
12 working in a pulmonary unit at a hospital as
13 his wife.  Any question in your mind about it?
14       1982.  He's going to move to Miami.  He
15 moves to Miami.  He is working in Arthur Murray
16 dance studio in Miami.  He meets, dates and
17 marries Nicki Fraser.  She too told him not to
18 smoke.
19       All right.  Now let me go back.
20       You moved to Miami in about what, the
21 early '80s?
22       Yes, I believe so.
23       And your lifestyle in Miami was very
24 similar to what it had been in the Carolinas,
25 when you were married to Donna Conliffe?

1       Because you remember, they moved from
2 Buffalo down to the Carolinas.  And she went to
3 nursing school down in the Carolinas.
4       Yes, I believe that was the lifestyle.
5 We did a lot of dancing, a lot of practicing.
6 We would go out and practice.  Yes, that was
7 it.  Same lifestyle that we had.
8       But now he's in Miami.
9       This is his testimony about her, Nicki
10 Fraser, Nicki Boatright telling him about his
11 health risks.
12       And she talked to you about the health
13 risks of smoking, didn't she?
14       In a passing conversation.  We did not
15 have a big, big conversation about it.  But she
16 probably mentioned it.  I would not say she did
17 not.
18       That's a double negative.  It means she
19 did.
20       What was your response to her?
21       Probably -- just probably ignored her.
22       It's okay.  But who is in control of your
23 decisions?
24       This is 1981, 1982.  1982.
25       Now, you know that in 1983, that Nicki

1 Fraser, they had a child, Cristal.  Nicki
2 Fraser is going to move back to Miami.  And
3 Mr. Boatright is going to stay in Orlando.
4 There he's going to meet and date the fourth
5 Mrs. Boatright, Deborah.
6       And you know that the lifestyle remains
7 the same.
8       This is what Mrs. Boatright said.
9       What is his favorite drink?
10       Jim Beam.
11       Same lifestyle.  Where do they go?
12 Dancing at nightclubs.  That's okay.  It's a
13 lifestyle.  But you've chosen your lifestyle.
14 You chose your lifestyle.
15       So in 1984, while at one of those
16 nightclubs, what happens to Mr. Boatright?  His
17 asthma, which -- remember, Donna Conliffe had
18 said:  When I met him, he was using an inhaler.
19 He had asthma when I met him.
20       He's now going to have a serious asthma
21 attack, so serious that he's got to go to the
22 hospital.  He's got to go to the hospital.
23 Asthma.
24       And that is the same year that
25 Mr. Boatright said, I saw that CEO of

1 R.J. Reynolds on Nightline.
2       Remember that?
3       He said:  I saw that program.
4       Well, I put in evidence -- I realize it's
5 a very fuzzy enlargement.  I apologize for
6 that.
7       But it shows that Nightline came on, and
8 that program was Nightline 11:30 on a Thursday
9 night, February 2, 1984.
10       And, again, this is a question of did
11 Mr. Boatright really see it then?  Did it
12 really influence him then, or is this something
13 he found on the internet after filing this
14 lawsuit?
15       Because I asked him:  What time did you
16 get home when you were working at the Arthur
17 Murray dance studio in Orlando, Florida?
18       And he said -- here is his answer:  Uh,
19 let me think.  1:00 would be the earliest.
20 Then he said:  No, no, 12:30.
21       Okay.  But Nightline is over at midnight.
22 Over at midnight.
23       So unless they are watching Nightline
24 while they're dancing, that was impossible.
25       And I put this in evidence for you guys

1 if you want to look at it.
2       Now, just to show you about environment
3 as the precipitating factor for folks to smoke,
4 you remember that he's now dating
5 Mrs. Boatright, the fourth Mrs. Boatright, and
6 she's a nonsmoker.
7       When they begin dating, she's a
8 nonsmoker, and this is what she testified.
9       When you were growing up, your parents
10 advised you, don't smoke, correct?
11       Yes.
12       And they began advising you not to smoke
13 before you were in high school?
14       Yes.
15       And you never smoked in high school?
16       No.
17       Never smoked after high school?
18       No, not that I can remember, no.
19       As a matter of fact, Mr. Boatright
20 probably offered you his -- your first
21 cigarette.
22       Now, how old is she?  She's 23 years old.
23 What was the reason why she took the cigarette?
24 The environment.  They are out at nightclubs.
25 This is what she said.

1       We're out in a nightclub.  There's
2 drinking, dancing.  He offers me a cigarette.
3 I took it.
4       And she became a smoker.  Not as regular
5 a smoker as Mr. Boatright, but she became a
6 smoker.
7       That's environment.  That's peer
8 pressure.
9       Does Mr. Boatright know -- if there were
10 any question about Mr. Boatright knowing or not
11 knowing that what he's doing comes with a
12 health risk, I mean, at this juncture, is that
13 even remotely possible?
14       Warnings changed on the packs in 1985.
15 Now they include a specific warning saying
16 smoking causes lung cancer and emphysema.
17       1988, Mrs. Boatright becomes pregnant.
18 Public service announcements are continuing.
19       I think we have just the image of Yul
20 Brynner, another star who says, Hey, you know
21 what?  I'm dying.  I'm dead.  That one actually
22 said I'm dead.  That one actually said, If
23 you're seeing this now, I've died.
24       Mr. Boatright sees the Surgeon General's
25 report, the news coverage of that, 1988.  And

1 at the same time, his wife says, I'm pregnant,
2 I don't want you smoking around me anymore
3 because of our as yet unborn baby.
4       And what's he do?  He's going to sign up
5 for a smoking cessation class at St. Joseph's
6 Hospital.  He's going to take it, except it
7 comes at the very same moment that their
8 daughter Danielle is born three weeks
9 prematurely.
10       Does Mr. Boatright then sign up for that
11 smoking cessation program after she's born?
12       No.
13       I said:  So now let's take you to the
14 time period where we left, and that's about
15 1989.  Danielle is born.  You start trying to
16 quit?
17       Correct.
18       Not because of health effects, but
19 because Debbie wanted you to -- actually, this
20 is Mr. Hammer asking him questions.
21       He said:  That's correct.
22       So is he now in 1989 quitting smoking
23 because of the health effects out of a concern
24 for his personal health?
25       No.  He's doing it because Debbie wanted

1 him to.
2       That's correct.
3       Does Mr. Boatright want to quit smoking
4 in 1989?  That's his own lawyer asking him that
5 question.
6       And the answer was:  No.
7       And this, again, is Mr. Hammer asking
8 Mr. Boatright these questions.
9       Throughout the '60s, did you ever think
10 about quitting?
11       No, I didn't.
12       All throughout the '70s, did you ever
13 think about quitting?
14       No, sir.
15       The '80s, 1981.  All the way through
16 until around, say, '88 period of time when
17 Debbie gets pregnant.  Were you thinking about
18 quitting?  Was it even a thought?
19       No.
20       This is his own lawyer asking him these
21 questions.
22       And after all of that, all that personal
23 story of Mr. Boatright, is that really because
24 he still had some question as to whether what
25 he's doing comes with a health risk.  Or is it

1 because Mr. Boatright genuinely enjoyed
2 smoking.
3       You know what he told his second wife
4 Donna Conliffe?  He said:  It helps me relieve
5 my stress.  It's pleasurable.  I enjoy it.
6       Now, he denied having a stressful job,
7 but she said that's what he told her.  Helps me
8 deal with my stress.
9       1990s.  He's hospitalized for the first
10 time that we know about in the medical records
11 that we have for severe asthma.
12       I'm going to go through the medical
13 records briefly in just a minute when I get to
14 the first question on the verdict form about
15 what's going on medically.
16       But the medical record shows that he's
17 using the Nicoderm patch by prescription.  But
18 is he really interested -- is he doing this for
19 himself or is he doing this because someone
20 else wants him to quit?
21       Well, what you know is -- what you know
22 is that here in 1992, he told you that he went
23 to Dr. Catz, and he maintained that Dr. Catz
24 told him that he had emphysema, COPD from
25 smoking.

1       I'll cover that in just a minute.
2       But he said that was the eye opener for
3 him.  That's the first time he realized that
4 smoking was dangerous.
5       And what did he say to you?
6       He said:  I was angry.  I felt deceived.
7 I felt that I'd been misled by Philip Morris.
8       And so what did he -- oh, and by the way,
9 he said:  Up to that point, while I talked to
10 Dr. Leibowitz in the late '80s and Dr. Tabb in
11 1992, and they'd said to me, I ought to quit
12 smoking.  He said:  Right.
13       And I asked him:  And your point here was
14 they were talking to you.  But in your
15 estimation, they weren't counseling you.  They
16 were telling you to stop, but they weren't
17 counseling you.
18       He said:  Well, yeah, but what I was
19 trying to get across to the other attorney --
20 and that was Mr. Hammer -- was the --
21       MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge, misstates
22 the evidence.  It was -- co-counsel was taking
23 the deposition.
24       THE COURT:  The jury will rely on their
25 own memory.

1       MR. REILLY:  Well, yeah, what I was
2 trying to get across to the other attorney was,
3 a statement is something that says if you're
4 talking to somebody that says, oh, Richard,
5 you're a little overweight.  You should really
6 cut back.  You know, to me, that's a statement.
7       But to counsel somebody, you try to sit
8 down with them and explain to them, you know,
9 the options.
10       And that's what I was talking about
11 with -- about counseling.  A statement is one
12 thing, counseling is another.
13       That's from this trial transcript.
14       So in 1993, '2, he says he has this
15 epiphany with Dr. Catz.  And now he's angry at
16 Philip Morris for having deceived him.
17       So what does he do, this angry man?  This
18 angry man sends in sweepstakes entry forms for
19 Philip Morris saying, hey, I want to get stuff.
20 I want to be in your sweepstakes.  I want your
21 logo'd stuff.
22       You remember I said, gosh, you could have
23 gotten that canvas bag at Walmart or Penney's
24 or anywhere, right?
25       And here he is, he wants the logo, fanny

1 pack, jacket, carry bag.  This is an angry,
2 deceived man?
3       This is a guy who didn't know about the
4 health risks of smoking?
5       And that goes right on through to 2003.
6 The records are in about the last time he
7 signed up for something.
8       He signed up -- telephoned in a
9 sweepstakes request in 2003 just before he quit
10 smoking.
11       All right.  By 1995, 50 million Americans
12 had quit smoking.
13       Throughout the '90s, Mr. Boatright had
14 been seen at least 26 times by 12 different
15 doctors.  They all treat him for his
16 long-standing asthma.  They all advise him to
17 stop smoking.
18       We go to the 2000s.  Can Mr. Boatright
19 quit smoking when he is sufficiently motivated
20 to quit?  Yes, he can.  Because he does.  The
21 medical records are in evidence.
22       We have separated in that little black
23 binder the medical records that I think you'll
24 find to be the most interesting, not 45,000.
25 Just a few in there.

1       And they include one that says that by
2 the end of December 2001, Mr. Boatright is down
3 to smoking two or three cigarettes a day.
4       And as of January 1, I asked
5 Mr. Boatright:  Did you make a New Year's
6 resolution to quit smoking?
7       He said:  Yes, I did.
8       And so in Dr. Forman's medical records,
9 you'll see that as of April 19th, he had quit
10 smoking for three months.  Forman sees him
11 again May 13.  He's had one cigarette.
12       By mid July, he'd had a few cigarettes,
13 up until two weeks ago.  Two weeks ago, he quit
14 smoking again.
15       And then you know the story of him
16 quitting smoking on December 15, 2003.
17       The rest of the story about how he quit
18 smoking.  He said what was different that day
19 was that when he got out of the hospital,
20 instead of stopping on the way home and getting
21 a pack of cigarettes, as he'd always done in
22 the past, that day his nephew picked him up,
23 and he said take me on home.
24       He went on home, locked the door, went to
25 bed.  And while he was recuperating from his

1 illness, he stays home, doesn't watch TV,
2 apparently, doesn't see anybody smoking,
3 doesn't put himself in proximity to somebody
4 smoking, either on TV or in person.
5       And at the end of that time frame, guess
6 what?  He never smoked again.
7       And he never does smoke again.
8       All right.
9       Just for finish this on out, you know
10 about the rest of his care and treatment.
11       You know about him going to Shands
12 Hospital at the University of Florida, looking
13 for a lung transplant.  They say no, your
14 principal problem is asthma.
15       He goes to the Mayo Clinic to get a
16 second opinion.  They accept him in their
17 program.  He gets a lung transplant in 2010 and
18 2012 again.
19       All right.
20       Now, let me take you to -- I think I did
21 that faster than in my opening.  I think I did
22 it -- Oops, oops.  Calm down.
23       All right.  So let's look at the verdict
24 form.  This is the exact order in which it's
25 going to occur.

1       Was Richard Boatright addicted to Philip
2 Morris cigarettes containing nicotine, and if
3 so, was his addiction a legal cause of chronic
4 obstructive pulmonary disease that manifested
5 on or before November 21, 1996?
6       Okay.  Really that's three questions at
7 once.  Let me put some periods in here so it's
8 easier to understand.
9       Containing nicotine.  That's question 1.
10 Was he addicted to Philip Morris cigarettes
11 containing nicotine?
12       If so, was his addiction a legal cause of
13 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD,
14 that manifested -- so that's question number 2,
15 that's question number 1.
16       And here is question number 3 -- that
17 manifested on or before November 21, 1996?
18       If the answer to any of those three
19 questions is no, then the answer to this
20 question is no.
21       And as the form says, if your answer to
22 question 1 is no, please proceed no further
23 than to sign and date the verdict form and
24 return to the courtroom.
25       Here is the form I told you about in my

1 opening statement.
2       In the '90s, and all the way up, I think
3 this is 2001 -- throughout the '90s, he sees
4 these 12 doctors.
5       And with the exception of Dr. Tabb for
6 one visit in 1992, he is the first one to look
7 at him.
8       Dr. Tabb says:  You know, you've got
9 asthma.  But he also says:  I think you have
10 chronic bronchitis caused by smoking.
11       But no other doctor is going to come to
12 that same diagnosis; nobody.
13       And, in fact, Dr. Tabb sends
14 Mr. Boatright to see Dr. Catz, the
15 board-certified pulmonologist.  He's an
16 allergist, and he sends Mr. Boatright to see a
17 pulmonologist.
18       In the medical records that you're going
19 to see, Dr. --
20       Michael, I think I'm going to need a
21 little help.  I think I got it.
22       Dr. Tabb sends Mr. Boatright to Dr. Catz.
23 Dr. Catz, in the medical records that we showed
24 you during the course of this trial, saw
25 Dr. Tabb's reference and said, no.  And you'll

1 see it in the written -- I'm not going to take
2 the time -- I don't have the time to take you
3 all the way back through the medical records.
4       Dr. Catz says, you know what?  What he
5 has is mild bronchitis.
6       You guys all learned the difference
7 between chronic bronchitis and acute
8 bronchitis.
9       THE COURT:  Mr. Reilly, you have used 50
10 minutes.
11       MR. REILLY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
12       You know that in order to have chronic
13 bronchitis -- and this came right out of the
14 publication of Dr. Mannino signed off on it,
15 their expert, you gotta have a cough with
16 sputum for at least three months at least two
17 years in a row.
18       And you know that Dr. Catz did not
19 diagnose him with chronic bronchitis, nor did
20 any other one of these doctors.
21       What did Dr. Catz say Mr. Boatright had?
22       And I realize that Mr. Boatright once
23 again has said something that's not in the
24 records.
25       He says that Dr. Catz told him that he

1 had emphysema.  He told him that he had COPD.
2       But fortunately, we don't have to rely on
3 Mr. Boatright's memory, do we?
4       Because we have an actual letter.  And
5 it's in those records that was sent to
6 Mr. Boatright on November 9, 1992, by Dr. Catz
7 telling him exactly what Dr. Catz actually
8 diagnosed him with.
9       And what did he tell him?
10       He said:  You have asthma.  That's the
11 explanation for your lung problems.  And you
12 have allergic rhinitis.  That's a runny nose
13 because of your allergies.
14       He doesn't say anything about chronic
15 bronchitis, didn't say anything about
16 emphysema, or does he say you have COPD.
17       And he treats him for his asthma.
18       Again, I'm not going to take you through
19 all the medical records, but every one of these
20 doctors that are stated -- none of these
21 doctors say he has COPD, emphysema or chronic
22 bronchitis.  Not one.
23       And you were told that Dr. Tabb sees
24 Mr. Boatright and diagnoses him three times in
25 a row with chronic bronchitis?

1       That's not right.  He did it one time.
2 He sees him two more times, but for completely
3 different stuff.  So I don't know why you were
4 told that.
5       Now, yes, it's true there's an emergency
6 room record in which Mr. Boatright apparently
7 told somebody that he had asthma and emphysema.
8 But here he is in January 11, 1995, personally
9 filling out a new patient information sheet at
10 the Watson Clinic.
11       And he says, hey, I've got bronchitis,
12 asthma, and he doesn't say he has emphysema.
13 Does not.
14       Do his doctors specifically say what he
15 has?  Well, here is a great example of
16 Dr. Estupinan.  Judge Radabaugh had to tell me
17 how to pronounce his name.  I hope I got it
18 right.
19       September 7, 1996, he's ordering oxygen.
20 What disease is he ordering it for?  He's
21 ordering it for chronic obstructive asthma.
22       In fact, on one of the slides that
23 plaintiff's counsel put up, he said in 1996 he
24 had obstructive lung disease.  He does.
25       There it is right there.  Chronic

1 obstructive asthma.  Because asthma can prevent
2 you from being able to expel your air.
3       What he doesn't check is emphysema/COPD,
4 chronic obstructive bronchitis.
5       He specifically doesn't check any of
6 those.
7       Why not?  Because Mr. Boatright doesn't
8 have those diseases at this moment.
9       COPD does not manifest -- I have nothing
10 against Mr. Schlesinger's Shelties, but this is
11 not a no landing zone.  This is what the
12 medical records show.
13       When is the first time that anybody even
14 hints at the possibility that there's something
15 else going on?
16       When is the first even possible
17 manifestation of COPD?  Well, here it is.
18       This is Dr. Forman's pulmonary consult,
19 March 6, 2001.
20       And he says:  Severe obstructive airway
21 disease clinically compatible with asthma;
22 however, a possible component of cigarette
23 smoking causing fixed airway obstruction.
24       There it is.  Five years after the close
25 of that class.  This is not a trampoline no

1 landing zone.  This is the medical records in
2 this case.
3       And Philip Morris didn't make them up.
4 This is record after record after record, and
5 they're all right there in that black binder.
6       Here is a little chart of all the dates.
7 These are all the dates.
8       Look at all the dates that he's seeing a
9 doctor.  And many of these dates Mr. Boatright
10 is being asked:  What's your problem, what are
11 you here for?
12       And his answer is:  Asthma.
13       Many of those dates.  That's what he
14 reports he is there for.  And you'll see it in
15 the records.  Asthma, asthma, asthma.
16       Yes, I did bring you Dr. Schroeder, a
17 board-certified pulmonologist from California.
18 And what he said was, you know, what really is
19 helpful in this case to understand the timing
20 of when he had COPD, when it became manifest is
21 to look at the physical evidence in the case.
22 The pulmonary function test, look at the CT
23 scans of the chest.  Look at the lung pictures.
24       By the way, the lung pictures.  Did you
25 notice that neither Dr. Mannino nor Dr. Illei

1 were given the lung pictures?  That you saw.
2       And he said, look at the dance videos.
3 Because Dr. Schroeder said, and you know --
4       Do we have just an image of the dance
5 video?
6       Dr. Schroeder said:  If you have a
7 severely -- this is December 2007.
8       Dr. Schroeder said:  If you have a
9 severe -- somebody who is suffering from severe
10 COPD, from emphysema or chronic bronchitis,
11 they will not appear on the dance floor like
12 that, even if you tell me they walked off and
13 got oxygen.
14       Six dances.  He said asthmatics can do
15 that.  Why?  Because asthma is like this.  It's
16 like that.  Some days you can do that, some
17 days you can't.  You can't at all.
18       As a matter of fact, there's a medical
19 record that says Mr. Boatright, in 2008, is
20 still engaging in vigorous dancing activities.
21       The CT scans.
22       Do you remember both Dr. Illei -- I hope
23 I'm pronouncing his name right -- and
24 Dr. Schroeder said, you know what?  CT scans
25 are exquisitely sensitive to the appearance of

1 emphysema.
2       And here are four CT scans, 2004, minimal
3 paraseptal emphysematous change in the right
4 lung apex, top of the lung.  Right lung.
5       2006.  Mild apical emphysematous changes
6 seen bilaterally.
7       2008.  CT scan of the chest, very minimal
8 upper lobe emphysematous changes.
9       2009.  Not even a year before the
10 surgery.  Mild emphysematous most pronounced in
11 the apices.
12       Here is the Surgeon General in 2014
13 helping you date the onset based on CT scans of
14 emphysema.
15       It says:  Visual analysis of the pattern
16 extent of emphysema can identify small amounts
17 of centrilobular emphysema usually in the upper
18 lobes -- usually in the upper lobes.  That's
19 exactly where it was.
20       And he said:  Small amounts in the upper
21 lobes of persons who have minimal quantitative
22 emphysema.  This appears to be the earliest
23 manifestations.  My goodness, this is the very
24 language out of the Surgeon General's report.
25 "Earliest manifestations of lung structural

1 change associated with COPD."
2       And there it is, that's exactly what the
3 CT scans are telling you in 2004, '06, '08, and
4 '09.
5       That's completely consistent with
6 Dr. Forman saying in 2001, five years after the
7 close of the class, this is the first time
8 there's even a suspicion, and then I only
9 brought out one lung picture.
10       But then Dr. Schroeder showed you right
11 here the very same thing that the CT scans were
12 showing, and that is very minimal upper lobe
13 emphysema.  Minimal, mild, mild, right there.
14       And you know what?  Neither Dr. Mannino
15 nor Dr. Illei showed you those lungs, because
16 they never even saw them.  Why didn't they see
17 them?
18       Dr. Mannino.  Here is his testimony.
19       I said:  Yeah, you've seen all the
20 medical records you have and no doctor
21 indicates that they ever told Mr. Boatright he
22 had emphysema throughout the '90s, right?
23       Correct.
24       That's their Dr. Mannino.  Here he is
25 again.

1       None of them, aside from Dr. Tabb on the
2 very first visit that he had, ever said to
3 Mr. Boatright that Mr. Boatright had emphysema,
4 chronic bronchitis or COPD, did they?
5       Dr. Mannino, who said he looked at all
6 the medical records said:  I don't know.
7       And I said:  You say that if this is so
8 plain, that if none of them made that
9 diagnosis, they all missed it, didn't they?
10       If, in fact, none of them made that
11 diagnosis, then yeah, they missed what I think
12 should have been an obvious diagnosis.
13       Twelve doctors.  They're all wrong.  But
14 the difference between them and Dr. Mannino is,
15 guess what?  They all actually saw doctor --
16 they all actually saw Mr. Boatright.  They all
17 listened to his chest.
18       This is Dr. Alvarez.  They said that
19 Dr. Alvarez correlated all of this, and that
20 they didn't do a lung transplant because of
21 asthma.
22       Well, here's the question that was posed.
23       I said:  Am I correct that because it
24 wasn't of primary concern -- I didn't ask this.
25 This was on video.

1       Am I correct that because it wasn't a
2 primary concern, your group never really came
3 to a final determination as to what, if any, of
4 the conditions predominated?
5       No, we thought he had an asthmatic
6 component, and we thought he had COPD as well.
7       Okay.  So you thought he had both?
8       Yes, the best I can remember, yes.
9       Did Dr. Alvarez treat Mr. Boatright?  Did
10 he examine him in the '90s?  No, he doesn't see
11 him until he goes to the Mayo Clinic in the mid
12 2000s.
13       Twelve treating physicians and
14 Dr. Schroeder said he had asthma.
15       Eleven of them agreed with Dr. Schroeder.
16 That's what he's got, is just asthma.  No
17 chronic bronchitis, no COPD, no emphysema.
18       Throughout the '90s.
19       And here is where we got real confusion.
20 Dr. Illei, their pathologist, said that he
21 thought it was predominantly emphysema with
22 minimal chronic bronchitis.
23       And Dr. Mannino said, no, no, he's got
24 chronic bronchitis.
25       What?

1       And this was Dr. Schroeder's testimony.
2 Mr. Boatright had end-stage obstructive lung
3 disease that in my opinion was primarily due to
4 asthma with fixed airflow obstruction.  He did
5 have COPD from smoking from 2000 on.  Proven by
6 the fact that in 2004, when he had his CAT
7 scan, you saw emphysema.
8       And that is absolutely consistent with
9 Dr. Forman, the record I showed you from
10 Dr. Forman.
11       So what is the question -- what is the
12 answer to this question right here?  Did he
13 have COPD, chronic bronchitis or emphysema that
14 manifested on or before November 21, 1996?
15       The answer is no.  So you don't have to
16 worry about the rest of this question.  Because
17 all of those things have to exist in order for
18 the answer to be yes.
19       But that's why this got like five
20 minutes' coverage in closing argument by the
21 plaintiff.  Because that's what -- that's how
22 complex -- that's what the medical records show
23 in this case.  And they are in evidence.
24       If for some reason all those records are
25 wrong, unanimously you guys say no, no, no,

1 that's wrong, then you do have to answer the
2 other two questions.
3       You know what?  You don't get an
4 instruction from Judge Radabaugh as to how you
5 determine whether somebody is addicted.
6       Yes, there are lots of instances where
7 there's a reference to him being dependent and
8 that sort of thing.
9       But the question doesn't end there.  They
10 have to show that his addiction was the legal
11 cause of his COPD.
12       For the last time, I'll do that.  Here is
13 a big old instruction telling you what you have
14 to figure out in order to determine whether or
15 not addiction was a legal cause of his COPD.
16 This wasn't even mentioned to you.
17       And you can't skip over it.  You've got
18 to determine it, if you get this far.  The
19 evidence doesn't, frankly, warrant that.
20       But if you do, you've got to make a
21 determination that addiction directly and in
22 natural and continuous sequence produced or
23 contributed substantially to producing his
24 COPD.
25       So that it can be said that but for the

1 addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine,
2 the COPD would not have occurred.
3       Well, you've already been shown testimony
4 that was elicited by plaintiff's counsel that
5 indicated that Mr. Boatright had absolutely no
6 interest in quitting smoking until what, as
7 late as 1988, 1989?
8       So had they satisfied you that his COPD
9 was substantially produced by addiction but for
10 addiction that he wouldn't have gotten COPD.
11       And if the answer to that question is no,
12 either one of these, if either one of those is
13 no, then the answer is no.  Your work is done.
14 And you sign and date the verdict form and
15 return to the courtroom.
16       If for some reason you guys unanimously
17 decide that's all wrong, I've got to go through
18 the rest of the verdict form, I'll do it pretty
19 quickly.
20       Please state whether Philip Morris's
21 concealment or omission of material information
22 about the health effects or addictive nature of
23 smoking cigarettes or both was a legal cause of
24 Richard Boatright's COPD.
25       I haven't even seen this.

1       The concealment or omission of material
2 information not otherwise known or available or
3 the failure to disclose a material fact
4 concerning or proving health effects and/or
5 addictive nature of smoking cigarettes is a
6 legal cause of COPD if it directly and in
7 natural and continuous sequence produces or
8 contributes substantially to produce COPD so
9 that it can reasonably be said that but for --
10 looks like it should have been a period
11 there -- but for the concealment, the COPD
12 wouldn't have occurred.
13       What does that require?  That requires
14 that they prove to you that he wouldn't have
15 gotten COPD if Philip Morris -- he was
16 waiting -- basically that says he was waiting
17 to hear something from Philip Morris.
18       And if he'd only heard something from
19 Philip Morris, he would have changed direction,
20 changed his mind and not smoked or he would
21 have quit sooner than he did.
22       Was there any evidence in that whole
23 story that I just walked you through, was there
24 any of that really and truly?  Are you
25 convinced of that?

1       And they have to show that plaintiffs
2 relied -- or plaintiff's reliance on
3 defendants' concealment or omission of material
4 information to be a legal cause.  You have to
5 unanimously find that he reasonably relied on
6 statements by Philip Morris that omitted
7 material information.
8       Well, in light of that personal story, is
9 there any chance of that?
10       And in order for there to be -- in order
11 for that to be a legal cause, this is a little
12 diagram that I use to sort of give you a sense
13 of the requirement of legal cause.
14       Whatever they are complaining about, was
15 there really a direct connection between
16 Mr. Boatright and the decisions that he made?
17       Did he see it?  Did he hear it?
18       They showed you "Death in the West."
19       But, Mrs. Boatright -- you know the
20 cowboy movie where the cowboys are supposed to
21 be sick and all that.
22       But I asked Mrs. Boatright:  You never
23 saw that?
24       No.
25       Your husband never saw that?

1       No.
2       So why show it?  I mean, this is
3 Mr. Boatright's case, right?
4       Not only has there got to be a direct
5 connection, but as I said, there has to be a
6 substantial impact.  And then it can be a legal
7 cause.
8       THE COURT:  Mr. Reilly, you have used 70
9 minutes.
10       MR. REILLY:  That means I have about 10
11 left to give counsel her 10.
12       All right.  Let me hurry on through here.
13       All right.  Same applies to this
14 concealment question.  The answer to these
15 questions are no, frankly, both for Philip
16 Morris and Liggett.  The same instruction
17 applies.
18       I won't take the time to go through it
19 again, because it's the same thing, basically.
20       And then that would bring you, if you get
21 this far -- and again, I think the evidence has
22 indicated otherwise, but if you get this far,
23 you have to assign percentages of
24 responsibility, legal cause for Mr. Boatright's
25 COPD.

1       I think it was Mr. Hammer who said, oh,
2 goodness, Mr. Boatright deserves 10 percent, 5
3 to 10 percent, if you get this far.
4       In light of this personal story?  This is
5 not a class action.  In light of this personal
6 story, if you got this far, what percentage of
7 responsibility would you assign to
8 Mr. Boatright?  I leave that to you guys.
9       I don't think you will get here, but if
10 you did.
11       What is the total amount of damages?  If
12 you get this far, you have to address damages.
13 What is the total amount of Mr. Boatright's
14 damages for lost earnings in the past, loss of
15 earnings in the future, past medical expense,
16 future medical expense?
17       The only person that came and talked
18 about that subject was the guy named Padron,
19 right?  Do you remember him?
20       He was the CPA.  He didn't have any
21 numbers that he created.  He just was bringing
22 numbers down to present day value.  Right?
23       He relied entirely on a report by a guy
24 named Mr. Morris who didn't come here and
25 explain a thing.

1       But what you did learn was that in
2 reaching a conclusion about his future medical
3 expenses, Mr. Morris didn't talk to anybody
4 involved in giving care and treatment to
5 Mr. Boatright.
6       Who did he talk to?  He talked to their
7 expert, Dr. Mannino.
8       Why wouldn't you talk to the people that
9 are actually giving him care?  And when he was
10 calculating his past lost wages, future lost
11 pages, he made an adding and dividing by two
12 mistake that I caught?
13       If you saw my math skills, you would
14 laugh.  Funnier than the hat on Dr. -- what's
15 his cookie's head -- Schroeder's head.  I mean,
16 they make a $100,000 mistake.
17       He didn't consider the effect of
18 Medicare, didn't base his numbers on the pay
19 that Mr. Boatright actually earned.
20       There is a schedule in there of what
21 Mr. Boatright actually earned.
22       And yes, Mr. Hammer did ask
23 Mr. Boatright:  Hey, did you make $39,000 a
24 year?
25       And Mr. Boatright said:  Yes, I did.

1       But you can see his actual earnings.
2 They are in evidence in that report from that
3 guy, Mr. Morris.
4       So where did he get these numbers?
5 Frankly, I think the answer to this one is they
6 have a burden of proof here, and I think they
7 wholly failed to satisfy their burden of proof.
8 Wholly.
9       And you heard about the Lakeland
10 Ballroom.  Mrs. Boatright said they're not
11 doing business in Lakeland, and they -- here is
12 their face page.
13       Here is their Lakeland Jacksonville
14 Ballroom website.  It says, Lakeland Ballroom
15 has been teaching Lakeland and Polk County to
16 dance since '93.  They are now teaching and
17 expanding into the Jacksonville area.  Read
18 more.
19       Here is the question where it says, what
20 is the total amount of damages for pain and
21 suffering?  I leave that to your sound
22 discretion if you get here.
23       That's true for -- obviously they would
24 like to receive millions and millions of
25 dollars if you get here.  Again, I leave that

1 to your sound discretion, if you got here.
2       The same for Mrs. Boatright.  Same
3 situation.
4       And that brings us to the final question
5 on this verdict form, and that is:  Under the
6 circumstances of this case, please state
7 whether you find by clear and convincing
8 evidence that punitive damages are warranted.
9       You did get the definition of clear and
10 convincing.  In light of the lack of connection
11 between Philip Morris and Mr. Boatright, other
12 than he liked their ads and he liked their
13 cigarettes the best.
14       Remember, I just showed you that board a
15 little while ago that said he liked the taste,
16 he liked the strength?
17       And, yeah, they said he switched to
18 Marlboro Lights, but for what, a week?  That's
19 what his wife said, or maybe two.
20       And during that same period of time, he
21 smoked a bunch of other cigarette brands.
22       This has to be something that relates to
23 Mr. Boatright.  Mr. Boatright.
24       Who came in and testified about that?
25 Who came in and complained about Philip Morris

1 and his conduct?
2       Well, it was Dr. Proctor.  It was
3 Dr. Proctor.
4       You remember Dr. Proctor.  He's the guy
5 that said, oh, you ought to make cigarettes --
6 the FDA is not doing anything.  The National
7 Institutes of Health, not doing anything.
8 National Cancer Institute, not doing anything.
9       They ought to do what I say, should be
10 done.  Remember that?
11       They ought to make cigarettes that have
12 .1 milligrams of nicotine in the rod and make
13 it so that the pH of smoke is 8.
14       And I don't know why they're spending all
15 that time, energy and money figuring out how
16 cigarettes need to be advertised, made,
17 et cetera.
18       And he acknowledged that Philip Morris
19 actually asked for this legislation to be
20 passed going all the way back to 2000.  Wrote a
21 letter to President Obama, said please pass
22 this.
23       And the FDA, National Institutes of
24 Health, National Cancer Institute are funding
25 $275 million worth of research to figure out

1 how cigarettes ought to be advertised,
2 manufactured, et cetera.
3       Dr. Proctor said, that's completely
4 unnecessary.  Just do as I say.
5       He was critical of having financed Nobel
6 laureates for their medical research, looking
7 at the genetic basis for things like cancer.
8 Not everything that Philip Morris ever did -- I
9 told you in the very beginning, I wouldn't
10 stand up here and support everything they ever
11 did, and I won't.
12       Right -- with Dr. Proctor.  I said, you
13 know, that Dow deal was just bad, bad.  They
14 should never have said to Dow, don't do that.
15       But you know what?  Did that have
16 anything to do with Mr. Boatright?  Absolutely
17 not.
18       Did Mr. Boatright get Nicorette gum
19 whenever he wanted it?  Yeah.
20       And if you look at the medical records,
21 he didn't want it.
22       But that's exactly -- and why does
23 Dr. Proctor get $2.2 million?  Why is he
24 testifying here and there and everywhere?
25 $50,000 a week?  Because he comes in and says

1 stuff like that.  That's a no-brainer.
2       That's a no-brainer.
3       All right.  I think the answer -- the
4 evidence shows that the answer on this
5 entitlement to punitive damages -- and by the
6 way, this money goes where?
7       It goes to the Boatrights, right?  That's
8 it.
9       What is the answer to this question?  No
10 and no.
11       And then you'll work, if you even got
12 that far -- I think the first question is where
13 this whole thing ends.
14       But if you disagree and you have to work
15 your way all the way through this, then that's
16 where you end up.
17       If you answer no to these questions, then
18 no, there isn't a tomorrow.  There isn't a
19 second phase.  You don't come back.  Your work
20 is done.
21       If you answer yes, though, to these -- to
22 this question, then yes, you do come back,
23 there is more work, there is no evidence.
24 There is no instructions.  There's more of
25 everything.

1       But doesn't the evidence in this case, in
2 light of this case, not some class actions,
3 just this case, isn't that where this all ends
4 up?
5       Now, I have to sit down.
6       Ann St. Peter is going to get up and
7 address you on behalf of Liggett.
8       But then Mr. Schlesinger is going to get
9 back up.  He's got another 15 minutes, and he
10 gets to go again.
11       Now, I don't know what cute images he's
12 going to have, but he gets to go again because
13 he has the burden of proof.  He has to persuade
14 you that -- and he said, you know, the scales
15 of justice, he doesn't just have to tip them a
16 little.  He's got to bring a bigger mountain of
17 evidence than I just showed you on these
18 issues.  Not just a scintilla of evidence.
19 He's got to bring a bigger mountain of evidence
20 than I just showed you.
21       MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge, that's not
22 the standard.
23       THE COURT:  Sustained.
24       MR. REILLY:  Maybe it's not a mountain.
25 He showed a mountain.  I said a mountain.

1       He has to bring a greater weight of
2 evidence than I did, whether it's a mountain or
3 a molehill.  He's got to have greater weight of
4 the evidence than I showed you, except on this
5 last issue, which is he's got to do it with
6 precise evidence.
7       All right.  So all I would say is,
8 please, just ask yourselves, what has this got
9 to do with Mr. Boatright's case.  That's all.
10       I greatly appreciate your attention.
11 You've been great.
12       Thank you.


9       MS. ST. PETER-GRIFFITH:  May it please
10 the Court, Counsel, Mr. and Mrs. Boatright.
11       Ladies and gentlemen of the Jury, good
12 afternoon.
13       JURORS:  Good afternoon.
14       MS. ST. PETER-GRIFFITH:  Thank you,
15 again, for your service.
16       I'm Ann St. Peter-Griffith, and it's my
17 privilege to be representing Liggett Group,
18 LLC, in this matter.
19       To begin with, I need to stress with you
20 there's only one tort count that you'll
21 consider against my client.  And that's the
22 conspiracy count.
23       Mr. Reilly has done an excellent job
24 detailing the evidence for you and giving you a
25 roadmap to checking "no" as to each question on

1 the jury verdict form as to both defendants,
2 and we agree.
3       Before I talk about my client, what I
4 would like to do is take you back to one of the
5 very first witnesses, Danielle Boatright
6 Smiddy.  Mr. Hammer showed you some of her
7 testimony.
8       What I would like for you to do is
9 remember the very last question that I asked
10 her on cross-examination.
11       She gave testimony in a deposition.  And
12 I had to take her back to that testimony until
13 she finally admitted that she testified earlier
14 that her father only told her that asthma was
15 the condition that he had.
16       And what is that testimony consistent
17 with?  Medical record after medical record
18 after medical record that Mr. Reilly has gone
19 through with you in this case.
20       Switching gears a little bit to my
21 client.  Plaintiffs and Dr. Proctor would have
22 you believe that all of the tobacco companies
23 since 1953 have been conspiring, working as
24 co-conspirators who worked in concert to hide
25 the ball from Mr. Boatright and the public.

1       Dr. Proctor, however, had to admit
2 certain facts concerning my client.  He did so
3 in cross-examination.
4       Liggett publicly acknowledged the health
5 effects of smoking and that smoking was
6 addictive.
7       In fact, Liggett put on its packaging the
8 warning "smoking is addictive."
9       My client did not attend the Plaza Hotel
10 meeting.  It did not hire Hill & Knowlton.  It
11 did not participate in or publish the Frank
12 Statement.  It never belonged to an
13 organization named TIRC.
14       Liggett only belonged to the organization
15 known as CTR, or Council for Tobacco Research,
16 for a little under four years in the mid-1960s,
17 and then it dissociated itself.
18       As Dr. Proctor admits, Liggett's total
19 contribution to the Tobacco Institute was
20 0.3 percent of all industry contributions, 0.3
21 percent.
22       Now, ladies and gentlemen, what I have
23 before you here is Liggett's evidence.
24       Madam Clerk has kindly put blue tabs on
25 it, so it's easily identifiable.  You're going

1 to take this back with you.  You're not going
2 to take the big screen back with you.  You're
3 going to take this evidence back with you.
4       In the 1950s and '60s, Liggett undertook
5 an extensive multi-year research regarding the
6 relationship between smoking and health risks.
7       As Dr. Proctor admitted, that investment
8 was more than the rest of the industry
9 combined.
10       That's not to say Philip Morris and the
11 other companies didn't do research.  They did.
12       The first document I'll show you.  It's a
13 big one.  You'll be glad to know I'm not going
14 to ask you to read all 700-plus pages.
15       This was the compilation of Liggett's
16 research that was handed over in 1963 to the
17 number one public health authority, the Surgeon
18 General, for assistance in the Surgeon
19 General's report.
20       Now, you will remember the 1964 Surgeon
21 General's report.  You heard about that.  It
22 was a very, very big deal.  It was very, very
23 public.  And it led to cautions and warnings on
24 cigarette packaging.
25       I would just like to highlight a few

1 points of what is in evidence in this document.
2       In volume 1.  Liggett's researchers
3 concluded there was a gross statistical
4 association that existed between smoking,
5 cancer, and death.
6       The entire volume 3 is dedicated to the
7 carcinogenic or cancer-causing links to harmful
8 components in cigarette smoke.
9       And, finally, just as another example.
10 Appendix 8 of volume 3 includes a chapter
11 regarding habituation and addiction.
12       My client gave all of this to the Surgeon
13 General in 1963, before Mr. Boatright ever
14 started smoking.
15       And Liggett published critical portions
16 of this report.
17       And by the way, there's nothing in the
18 Arthur D. Little L&M perspective document that
19 my client did not disclose in this research.
20       Just briefly, the other tabs, we've also
21 put into evidence documents that established
22 that Liggett's research wasn't a secret to the
23 public health community.
24       As early as 1954, Liggett's researchers
25 were meeting with the American Cancer Society.

1       In Liggett's Exhibit 6965, the U.S.
2 Department of Agriculture's top tobacco
3 researcher praised Liggett for ten years of
4 productive collaboration.
5       And, finally, Exhibit 219, the Surgeon
6 General expressed the Surgeon General's special
7 gratitude for the tremendous time, effort, and
8 expense expended in the production of Liggett's
9 research for the Surgeon General.
10       Now, ladies and gentlemen, for all the
11 millions of documents that Dr. Proctor told you
12 he had access to, Dr. Proctor didn't tell you
13 about these documents.
14       Plaintiffs didn't tell you about these
15 documents.
16       What is that expression that Paul Harvey
17 used to have?  Now you know the rest of the
18 story.
19       My client wasn't hiding the ball.  And
20 plaintiffs certainly have not made any showing
21 that Liggett's conduct was a but-for cause of
22 Mr. Boatright's claims, the injuries that he
23 claims.
24       Nor has plaintiff shown by clear and
25 convincing evidence.  You heard that's a pretty

1 high standard -- that my client engaged in any
2 intentional conduct that would warrant punitive
3 damages entitlement.
4       And the same is true for Philip Morris.
5       Before I conclude, I would just like to
6 say that we understand that serious illness can
7 be difficult for an individual and his family.
8       It's understandable to empathize, to a
9 degree.
10       However, when we began this process, as
11 jurors you took an oath, and under that oath
12 you promised to follow the evidence and base
13 your decision only upon the evidence.
14       As Judge Radabaugh will tell you, you
15 should not be influenced by bias, sympathy,
16 prejudice, or public opinion.
17       You saw Mr. Boatright on the stand.  He
18 made his own decisions.  And we ask that you
19 render a verdict in favor of Liggett and Philip
20 Morris.
21       On behalf of my client, myself, Philip
22 Morris, the entire defense team and everyone
23 who has been here with you for the past three
24 weeks, thank you again for your time, for your
25 patience, for the careful attention that you've

1 paid to the evidence, and for your service on
2 this jury.
3       Thank you.
