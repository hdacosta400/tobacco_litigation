17       MR. HAMMER:  Thank you, Judge.  May it
18 please the Court, counsel.
19       Trial by jury, the best of safeguards for
20 the person and property of every individual.
21 Thomas Jefferson said that in 1823, and it
22 stands true today.  And tomorrow being Veterans
23 Day, where our men and women are honored for
24 fighting for our freedoms, one of those
25 freedoms is the trial by jury.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1       And I want to thank you all for staying
2 with us and coming back this week to hear our
3 final arguments and make a decision in this
4 case.
5       Take it down.
6       It's been over 20 years since Richard
7 found out he had COPD.
8       It's been over 20 years since Richard
9 found out he had the lungs of an 88-year-old
10 man.
11       It's been over 20 years since Richard
12 found out if he doesn't stop smoking, he will
13 die.  That's why we're here today.
14       Back in 1992, he was told that.  He was
15 told that these things, these cigarettes, is
16 what caused his disease.  He was told that by
17 Dr. Tabb.
18       And for the next 18 years of his life,
19 after being told that, he struggled with
20 addiction.
21       For the next 18 years, he knew this is
22 what caused his disease, and he knew it then in
23 1992.  No doubt about it.
24       Now, nearly every doctor that saw Richard
25 talked about his addiction.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1       Keith, go to slide 2, please.
2       He tried all sorts of things.  He tried
3 medications that were prescribed to him, but he
4 also tried at the first just quitting.
5       Remember, he talked about how -- he said:
6 I thought I could always put them down and
7 never look back.  Couldn't do that.  Couldn't
8 quit cold turkey.
9       He tried cutting back.  He tried throwing
10 away ashtrays.  He tried hypnosis.  He tried
11 Chinese cupping therapy.  He tried the patches,
12 he tried the gum, when they were still
13 prescription.  He tried Zyban and Wellbutrin.
14       Look at all the times he was prescribed
15 those things by his doctors.  He tried very
16 hard to quit.  But he couldn't quit.
17       Slide 3, Keith.
18       Slide 4.
19       Nearly every single doctor that saw him
20 made a reference to this man's addiction.
21 Called it a bunch of different things:  Tobacco
22 abuse, persistent tobacco abuse, tobacco
23 addiction, chronic cigarette abuse, tobacco use
24 disorder, smoking dependence, tobaccoism.
25       They all said he was addicted.  They all
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 said it.  And Richard knew it.  That's why he
2 was fighting so hard to quit.
3       Throughout the years, he quit for brief
4 periods of time.  But every time that hook
5 brought him back in.  He tried to quit.  He
6 really did.
7       Now, it took him ten years of constant
8 effort to finally quit.  And in 2003, he did.
9       You can take that down, Keith.
10       He did, with the help of what?  Being in
11 the hospital, getting Wellbutrin and Tranxene.
12       Tranxene is a powerful benzodiazepine.
13 Like Xanax or Valium.  But it's actually more
14 powerful than that.  It's used to help people
15 kick withdrawals, the DTs.
16       It finally worked.  That's what it took
17 for this man to finally be able to quit.
18       Of course, one of the things we must
19 prove to you is Richard was addicted.  I think
20 it's pretty clear that he was.  Based upon what
21 every doctor said, based upon what he told us.
22       We have to prove that his addiction
23 caused him to smoke these cigarettes, the
24 Marlboro cigarettes, made by Philip Morris.
25       That's what he smoked pretty much all his
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 life.  It caused him to get the COPD that
2 ultimately resulted in replacing his lungs.
3       And that COPD absolutely manifested
4 itself on or before November 21, 1996, because
5 Dr. Tabb found it in 1992.
6       Slide number 6.
7       Dr. Tabb, in his report -- number 6.
8 Thank you -- wrote:  Chronic bronchitis
9 secondary to tobacco abuse.  Chronic
10 bronchitis, COPD.  As a result of smoking these
11 things.
12       That's what Dr. Tabb wrote in his record
13 in '92.
14       And then in November, slide number 7,
15 please.
16       Dr. Catz, in his own report, he wrote:
17 Flow volume loop is compatible with COPD.  He's
18 got an estimated lung age of 88 years.
19       And he told Richard:  You've got
20 emphysema, you've got to quit.
21       Richard knew it.
22       Slide number 8.
23       He told us.  When did you know you had
24 it?
25       I knew I had COPD caused by cigarette
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 smoke in 1992.
2       And lungs.  Lungs of an 88-year-old man.
3 I was 39 years old at the time.
4       That's what he testified to.  And Debbie
5 knew it.
6       Next slide.  Number 9.
7        At that point, did you know exactly --
8 what did they explain to you and Richard what
9 the COPD was from.
10       They explained to me at that time, in
11 1992, it was from smoking.
12       And Danielle, who was just an infant at
13 the time.  Can you describe for us your
14 earliest recollections of your dad?
15       Probably when I was 4 or 5, growing up,
16 he always smelled like smoke.  It was always
17 known that my dad had COPD.  Ever since I
18 remember.  Being 4 or 5 years old.
19       She was born in 1989.  '93, '94, she was
20 4 or 5 years old.  That's what she knew all her
21 life.
22       And now Richard sits here before you, as
23 directed by the Supreme Court.  He was hoping
24 he would be around long enough to present this
25 case to you, and fortunately he is, as a result
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 of these double lung transplants.
2       It's a miracle that he's here, and we
3 will talk about that a lot.
4       But he sits here now, and we're -- Scott
5 and I, Brittany, we're proud to represent
6 Richard and Debbie and be able to present their
7 case, and we thank you for that opportunity
8 from the bottom of our hearts, and Debbie and
9 Richard thank you.  They really do.
10       Because what you're doing here is
11 tremendous, and we appreciate it.
12       We're asking you to determine that
13 Richard is a member of the class.
14       Slide number 14.
15       The issue that you first have to decide
16 is, was Richard Boatright addicted to Philip
17 Morris cigarettes containing nicotine?
18       And if so, was his addiction a legal
19 cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
20 COPD, that manifested on or before November 21,
21 1996?
22       That's the issue, that's the first issue.
23 The question is whether he smoked enough
24 cigarettes to develop a disease because of his
25 addiction.  That's what this case is about.  It
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 should be very simple, that first question.
2       And then once you answer yes, which we
3 hope you will, we move on to the Engle
4 findings, the issue of compensation, the issue
5 of percentage of fault and the issue of whether
6 or not these companies, both of these
7 companies, Liggett and Philip Morris, should be
8 punished for their actions and their conduct
9 over those years.
10       Now, the defense says no, it's not that
11 simple.
12       Mr. Reilly, Ms. St. Peter-Griffith,
13 they're going to stand up here and say no, it's
14 not that simple.
15       Because we're going to tell you,
16 Mr. Boatright, he didn't have COPD in the '90s,
17 he didn't have emphysema in the '90s.
18       They're going to tell you, his addiction,
19 that didn't cause disease.  His choice to smoke
20 caused his disease.  He could have quit any
21 day.  That's what they'll tell you.
22       But we all know the truth.  The truth is
23 Richard tried to quit, and it took a
24 combination of Wellbutrin and Tranxene, a very
25 powerful drug, to make this man quit.  It
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 wasn't until that, all those years, ten years
2 of trying, and he really did try.
3       But that's how addictive.  That's how
4 addictive these things are.  It's a drug.
5       Now, the defense also will tell you, hey,
6 you know what?  He didn't have the COPD.
7 Dr. Tabb, was wrong, Dr. Catz was wrong.
8       When Richard told the doctors at the ER
9 in '94 that I have emphysema, no, he was wrong.
10 Those doctors are wrong.
11       Listening to Dr. Schroeder, who came in
12 and told you no, this man only had asthma, he
13 didn't have COPD.
14       And despite the fact that the Mayo
15 Clinic, one of the top institutes in the world,
16 best hospitals in the world, they took out this
17 man's lungs because of what, because of
18 emphysema.
19       And we brought forth Dr. Illei from one
20 of the other top hospitals in the world,
21 Johns Hopkins.  He told you those lungs, when I
22 looked at the slides, not pictures, when I
23 looked at slides of the actual tissue that they
24 took out of this man, it showed emphysema.
25       Mayo Clinic didn't give Richard Boatright
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 a transplant for asthma.
2       Slide number 13.
3       When they took out his lungs, Dr. Khoor
4 from the Mayo Clinic, what did she say?
5       Dr. Khoor:  Emphysema and chronic
6 bronchitis.  Looking at the same slides that
7 Dr. Illei looked at.
8       Not some picture that Dr. Schroeder
9 looked at and said, oh, I see emphysema at the
10 apex, there's very mild ... but this man had
11 asthma.
12       Come on.  That's absurd.
13       And I'm sure Mr. Schlesinger will talk
14 more about Dr. Schroeder and how absurd his
15 opinion is.  But you as the jury have every
16 right to discount his testimony.  The judge
17 read you that instruction.
18       You can take that down, Keith.
19       Thank you.
20       So after 18 years, from first hearing
21 from his doctors that he had COPD, he ends up
22 on an operating table at Mayo Clinic.  And they
23 remove his lungs.  And they put in a set of
24 lungs from a 17-year-old boy who just happened
25 to die shortly before that, who fortunately was
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 an organ donor.
2       And unfortunately, just weeks after the
3 surgery, Richard's body started to reject the
4 lungs.  Went into rejection.  That happens from
5 lung transplant.  That's a major risk.
6       For the next 18 months, he struggled
7 every day with breathing.  He struggled every
8 day with the fear that he may not get a second
9 set of lungs.  He struggled every day with the
10 anxiety that I'm going to be facing another
11 surgery.
12       He described how painful that first one
13 was.  He described how they basically cut him
14 open like a can opener, scars here and here,
15 scars, angel wings in the back.  That's what
16 he's got.  He's scarred for the rest of his
17 life.
18       But you know what?  He's got new lungs in
19 his body and now he's breathing.  He's very,
20 very fortunate.
21       Very rare, very uncommon.  Second lung
22 transplant.  And he lives every day with the
23 fear that the slightest sniffle, the slightest
24 infection, can kill him.  That's a fear he
25 lives with every day, and that's a fear that
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 Debbie lives with every day.
2       That's a tremendous burden.  That's why
3 we're asking you for compensation.
4       Because this company, these cigarettes,
5 that's what did it to him.  Nobody chooses --
6 nobody chooses that.
7       Slide number -- actually, don't need a
8 slide yet.
9       The defense will try to convince you
10 otherwise.  Mr. Reilly will get up here.  He'll
11 speak to you.  He's a great lawyer.  Great
12 lawyer, very persuasive.
13       Don't let him confuse you with his
14 argument, because the evidence, the evidence
15 speaks volumes.
16       We put together -- I mean, you saw a
17 dozen or so boxes of medical records.  For
18 brevity, we put together some of the key
19 medical records.  It's all tabbed by year.
20       It's tabbed also by the records that were
21 used with Dr. Alvarez, by Dr. Mannino,
22 Dr. Illei, and Mr. Boatright.  So easy access
23 to the medical records for you.
24       We don't expect you to go through 40,000
25 records to find one that you might be
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 interested in.  And they are all chronological.
2 As I said, they are all tabbed with dates.
3       Now, he'll get up here, Mr. Reilly will
4 get up here and say, hey, as I said, this
5 wasn't addiction, it was his choice.  But we
6 all know.
7       Slide number 15.
8       Their own documents say we can't defend
9 continued smoking as "free choice" if the
10 person was addicted.  They knew that back in
11 1980.  Their own documents said that.
12       But really, what person ever chooses
13 addiction?  Richard smoked these things for 38
14 years.  Not because he liked them, not because
15 he enjoyed them, but because he was addicted to
16 them.  He was dependent on the nicotine.
17 That's what these things do to you.  They hook
18 you.
19       And again, there's been a lot of talk
20 about choice, and Mr. Reilly will probably talk
21 about it, it was his choice, he could have quit
22 any day.
23       But really, could he have?  He certainly
24 did try.  And that goes to comparative fault.
25 It doesn't go to whether or not his addiction
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 caused his disease.  Because we all know it
2 did.
3       Slide number 12.
4       This.  How addiction causes disease, 8
5 puffs a cigarette.  5 million lifetime
6 exposures to chemicals to cause disease.
7 That's how these things cause disease.
8       Doesn't matter about his ability to
9 quit -- you can take that down.
10       Doesn't matter if he did quit, doesn't
11 matter when he did quit.  What matters is he
12 smoked these things enough to give him disease.
13 That's what question 1 is all about.
14       I'm going to talk to you a little bit and
15 then Scott is going to talk to you about their
16 conduct.  I'm going to try not to be
17 repetitive.  Hopefully we won't be.
18       You heard a lot of things throughout this
19 day -- throughout the past few weeks, rather,
20 and sometimes we were repetitive.
21       We apologize for that, but we don't know
22 what you want to hear.  We try to put forward
23 the evidence that is necessary to convince you.
24 Hopefully we did that.
25       But I apologize to you up front if we
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 took too much time, and I apologize to you if
2 you think Scott and I covered the same topics.
3 We're going to try not to do that.
4       As I said, we all know people smoke --
5 some people do smoke for enjoyment.  They will
6 smoke a cigarette or two a day, not smoke for a
7 while, because they like the taste.
8       But, you know, people that smoke a pack,
9 two, three, they're not smoking for the taste
10 anymore.  They are not smoking because they
11 enjoy it.  They smoke because they need these
12 things.  They need the nicotine that's inside.
13       That's what this is.  It's a nicotine
14 delivery device.  You saw the documents.
15 That's all it is.  Delivers the dose of
16 nicotine to keep somebody addicted.
17       The choice of a child, 12 years old, to
18 pick one of these things up to be cool, along
19 with his friends.  That's a choice Richard
20 Boatright made.  Stupid, yeah.  But he's a kid.
21 Kids do stupid things.
22       The choice to keep on smoking to be cool,
23 to fit in.  By the time -- shortly after
24 starting, he was smoking a pack a day.
25       Riding his bike, collecting bottles,
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 picking up bottles a nickel at a time, crates
2 at a time for a quarter.  Turning them in to
3 buy one of these packs.
4       Back in those days, you could get them
5 for just 25 cents.  Pretty good deal.  Five
6 bottles, I get my cigarettes.
7       And it was cool back then.  And it was
8 cool all through the '60s and '70s, and into
9 the '80s, people were still smoking without a
10 thought.  That's what people did back then.
11       And even when Donna Hernandez, his wife,
12 who was a nurse tells him, hey, look, I'm
13 dealing with patients all the time that get
14 sick from this stuff, you've got to quit.  He's
15 in his 20s.  The guy is dancing 15 hours a day.
16 He's in great shape.  These things are never
17 going to hurt me.  I'm not worried about it.
18       And what happens?  He goes to the
19 hospital to pick her up, and the doctors are
20 walking out, smoking away.  In the hospital.
21       So come on.  Is he really going to
22 believe that?  Is he really going to think I'm
23 going to end up having to wear a mask every day
24 so I don't get infection because I could die
25 with my next breath if an infection gets inside
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 me?
2       Is he thinking that when he's 20 years
3 old?  Of course not.
4       Now, Richard started smoking -- slide
5 number 16 -- with these ads, okay.  These
6 ads -- these ads took him down that path.  He
7 became cowboy, rode that trail with the
8 Marlboro man, just like they wanted him to.
9       Now, I want to talk about -- go back to
10 the verdict form, Keith.
11       The first slide, the first question.  Was
12 he addicted?  Of course he was.
13       So I want you to check off yes so we can
14 move on to the findings, and Scott will talk to
15 you about the findings.
16       The judge read to you the findings, and
17 the judge explained to you legal cause.
18       Listen carefully to that.  Were these
19 cigarettes a legal cause?  Was it a reason that
20 Richard smoked cigarettes?  Of course.
21       I want to talk to you about -- skipping
22 ahead a little bit.
23       I want to talk to you about the damages
24 in the case.  Richard, he loved dancing.  He
25 loved life.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1       Show the next picture.
2       Look at this.  This is what the guy
3 looked like.  Do you think he ever thought
4 cigarettes were going to hurt him when he was
5 20 years old?  He was bulletproof.
6       That's what kids think.  That's what
7 young men think.  Never going to get sick.
8       Imagine -- imagine this.  You heard that
9 Richard saw Joe Cullman.  He saw Joe Cullman on
10 "Face the Nation."  Imagine if Joe Cullman had
11 said:  Listen, folks, our cigarettes, they're
12 going to kill you.  I represent Philip Morris,
13 and I know there's a lot of smokers out there.
14 But listen, I want to tell you the truth right
15 now, our cigarettes will kill you.  So we're
16 going to set up smoking clinics.  We're going
17 to cooperate with Dow Chemical, and we're going
18 to make Nicorette gum available to everybody so
19 you can quit before this stuff kills you.
20       In 1971, when Richard watched Joe
21 Cullman, he said this instead.
22       Play it real quick, Keith.
23       (The video clip was played and taken down
24       to the best of the reporter's ability as
25       follows:)
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1       VOICE:  We do not believe that cigarettes
2 are hazardous, we don't accept that.  Because
3 when, as, and if any ingredient in cigarette
4 smoke is identified as being injurious to human
5 health, we are confident that we can eliminate
6 that ingredient.
7       (Video clip concluded.)
8       MR. HAMMER:  For that reason alone --
9       Go to the verdict form, Keith, on
10 concealment.
11       If they told the truth, if they didn't
12 agree back in 1954, we wouldn't be here.  It
13 would be a different world that Richard grew up
14 in.
15       So, of course, yes, he relied on those
16 statements.  He relied on them because if they
17 would have said something else, things would
18 have been different.  And Richard told you that
19 in his own testimony.
20       So check off.
21       And Liggett, they're just as responsible
22 for that conspiracy, because they were involved
23 with all those other corporations.  They were
24 responsible.
25       Go to the percentage.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1       Now, you're going to be asked, well, what
2 percentage of fault?
3       Well, Philip Morris as compared to
4 Richard.  Richard, a 12-year-old kid started
5 smoking, Philip Morris a big corporation that
6 knew better.
7       I would suggest 5 or 10 percent for
8 Richard.
9       90 percent, at least 90 percent for
10 Philip Morris.
11       They need to take responsibility for
12 their actions.
13       You're going to be asked, well, how much
14 money should we give?  How do you determine?
15       First of all, we heard from Oscar Padron
16 the different options.  You heard the life
17 tables, he's expected to live about 20 years if
18 he's a normal white male of this age, so we
19 figured out the 20-year period.
20       And we also figured out a five-year
21 period.  Because you heard after a lung
22 transplant, possible five years.
23       But we think, you know what?  In today's
24 world.  Advances in science, advances in
25 medicine, who knows.  So I would ask you to
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 consider --
2       Next form, Keith.
3       -- option 2.  Which we said the 1.7
4 million.  I think that's reasonable under the
5 circumstances.
6       We're going to ask you to compensate
7 Richard for his pain, for his suffering, for
8 what he went through.
9       You are -- you heard what he went
10 through, cut open like a can opener.  Pain
11 every day, the fear of dying every day.  What
12 is that worth?
13       All the pain and suffering he went
14 through.
15       Skip ahead, Keith.
16       I would ask you to consider awarding
17 $10 million in this case to Richard Boatright.
18 I think that's fair and reasonable.
19       Now, you may think it's too much.  You
20 may think it's too little.  But we think that's
21 fair and reasonable under the circumstances.
22 Two lung transplants.  The pain this man went
23 through.
24       That's reasonable under the
25 circumstances.  It's a miracle he's alive
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 today.  And he thanks his lucky stars every
2 day.
3       Debbie, the pain and suffering that
4 Debbie goes through.  She's been there every
5 step of the way with Richard.  We would ask you
6 to consider 2.5 million.  We think that's fair
7 and reasonable.
8       Again, you may think that's too little;
9 that's too much.  It's your decision.  Those
10 are suggestions we have for you.
11       And then when it comes to punitive
12 damages.  Are punitive damages warranted
13 against each of these companies?  Of course
14 they are.
15       Scott is going to talk to you a lot about
16 that.  We would ask you to check off yes to
17 both of those companies.
18       Because if you're going to be a company
19 in this country, you're going to make a
20 product.  You're going to make a product, then
21 make a safe one, not one that kills half its
22 users.  That's just wrong, and they should be
23 punished for that.
24       I want to thank you very much for your
25 time.  Scott is going to talk to you for a
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 little while.  Please give him the same
2 attention.
3       And, again, the Boatrights thank you.


22       MR. SCHLESINGER:  May it please the
23 Court.
24       Judgment day.  A day of reckoning.  A
25 reckoning is an accounting for past wrongdoing.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 I'm going to take you back to the days before
2 we had medical testimony, and I'm going to talk
3 about conduct testimony and the conduct of the
4 tobacco industry insofar as what it's done in
5 the United States.
6       And when we talk about a day of
7 reckoning, it's because I want to talk to you
8 about the punitive damages count.
9       And I want to explain to you why this is
10 a case that calls for punitive damages because
11 of what's gone on with regard to reprehensible
12 conduct of an industry that placed profit over
13 human lives and did so with knowledge,
14 aforethought, did so intentionally, did so on
15 purpose.
16       And one of the ways to say it is that the
17 tobacco industry and the choice between the
18 physical health of consumers and the financial
19 well-being of business.  Concealment is chosen
20 over disclosure.  Sales over safety and money
21 over morality.
22       Who are these persons who knowingly and
23 secretly decide to put the buying public at
24 risk solely for the purpose of making profits
25 and who believe that illness and death of
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 consumers is an appropriate cost of their own
2 prosperity?
3       So when I say to you today we stand on
4 the precipice of something that is great, that
5 is larger than ourselves, that is an
6 opportunity to use the American justice system
7 to bring to bear equivalent playing field
8 between an enormous powerful corporation and --
9       MR. REILLY:  Objection.
10       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- regular folks in the
11 community --
12       THE COURT:  Overruled.
13       MR. SCHLESINGER:  And Dr. Proctor
14 testified about the power of the corporation.
15       You all are entitled to take into
16 consideration what they've done, what it's done
17 not only to the folks here in the courtroom, to
18 Mr. Boatright, who is a living example of a
19 smoker who has made it to face the tobacco
20 companies alive, and we'll talk about that.
21       Here is the most important thing.  Right
22 out of the box, you must know that as of -- and
23 this is in evidence.  This document is in
24 evidence.
25       This is going to be -- you can get these
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 for free from the government.  They pay the
2 postage.  It has enormous amounts of
3 information and shows you that even today, even
4 now, we are still learning and identifying and
5 understanding just the scope of the devastation
6 the tobacco industry has caused.
7       The findings in the Surgeon General 2014
8 that I wanted to reflect on with you so quickly
9 are that all these years, folks have talked
10 about stop quitting.
11       Yul Brynner, don't smoke, don't smoke.
12 You remember that public service announcement.
13       You may ask, well, if he was making that
14 public service announcement, where were the
15 tobacco executives watching this public service
16 announcement.  Why didn't they do something
17 about it.
18       Why didn't they get together and say, you
19 know what, we're killing all these people.
20 Let's stop making an effective and dangerous
21 product.  Let's taken addictiveness out.  Take
22 the inhalability out.  Let's sell tobacco in
23 its natural state.
24       They would still have the business, they
25 would be 1/10th of the business.  But wouldn't
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 be an epidemic of disease.
2       That's what we have here.  We have an
3 industrial driven epidemic of disease,
4 literally an infectious disease that sickens
5 and kills more Americans and more people
6 worldwide, but for this case Americans than any
7 other thing in the country.
8       We say it is an irrational madness that
9 hides in plain sight.
10       Kurt Vonnegut said to an insane society,
11 a sane man must appear insane.
12       And it's almost like a deprogramming
13 opportunity for us here.  We all live in a
14 culture they created, for you to see something
15 that a lot of folks haven't seen.  It hides in
16 plain sight.
17       One of the things I thought of that comes
18 from an old song is, when you came into this
19 courtroom at the beginning of the case, I
20 thought I knew, I thought I knew, but now I
21 know.  The song has a line, I thought I knew,
22 but now I know.  It's Elton John, Mona Lisas
23 and Mad Hatters.  It's a great song.
24       But the idea is, we went in a roomful of
25 150, 160 people, folks had preconceived
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 notions.  And we filtered y'all out, and you
2 all said, I'll be open-minded.  But even --
3 everybody has some idea about it.
4       You said:  I thought I knew.  But now you
5 know.  Now you have been exposed to what they
6 have done internally, what -- a secret business
7 plan, an enterprise of death that traded lives
8 for money all these years.
9       And what is interesting is, the focus is
10 on the smoker.  You can't say you're going to
11 lie to a smoker and then blame it on him.
12       You can't say I'm going to take a
13 12-year-old, a child of tender ages, the target
14 of my business activity, hook him as a
15 replacement smoker for my customers that I know
16 are dying and then say, It's all your fault.
17 All Richard's fault.
18       You can't do that.  That's not
19 reasonable.
20       This is something that's bigger.  It
21 transcends this courtroom.  It's about Richard.
22 It's about compensation for Richard, which is
23 restorative in nature.
24       But the point to make here is to say we
25 here in Bartow have seen something.  Our eyes
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 have been opened to something that is current.
2 It's relevant.  It's news.
3       2014, the tobacco epidemic was initiated
4 and has been sustained by the aggressive
5 strategies of the tobacco industry which has
6 deliberately misled the public on risks of
7 smoking cigarettes.
8       This is the first time in 50 years of
9 Surgeon General's reports -- and all the
10 Surgeon General cares about is helping people.
11 The first time in 50 years the Surgeon
12 General's report specifically changes its focus
13 from you should quit.  If you're addicted, you
14 should quit, even though addiction is a
15 fundamental -- it's a brain disease.  It causes
16 a permanent change.
17       This case, without a doubt and more so
18 than ever has got -- is replete with records
19 about this man being addicted.  It is not an
20 issue in dispute.
21       As a matter of fact, they presented not a
22 single shred of evidence to deny addiction, not
23 one shred of evidence.
24       As a matter of fact, the document they
25 put on, he pled ignorance.  I don't know, I
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 don't know.  I can't tell you about addiction.
2 It's part of his practice.  He should have been
3 able to say something about it, but he didn't.
4       And so this is an important point,
5 because it's current.  It's the first time the
6 Surgeon General is focusing not on the smoker,
7 the illness, the disease, but on who it is that
8 is sustaining this epidemic, who initiated the
9 epidemic, the aggressive strategy of the
10 tobacco industry deliberately misled the public
11 on the risks of smoking, and it worked.  It
12 worked.
13       Then we go to punishment damages, because
14 you will work your way through class
15 membership.  I say you can make it easy, you
16 can make it hard.
17       We talked about the burden of proof, and
18 this is the scales of justice.  And remember,
19 it's not a criminal case where it's all to the
20 exclusion of any reasonable doubt.
21       It's not like you've got to get the
22 scales to go all the way one way or the other.
23 It's on balance.  The preponderance of the
24 evidence.  What is most likely.  What is
25 persuasive.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1       An organic medical record from soup to
2 nuts that you saw lays out a case of a man who
3 is clearly sick, with documentation.  It's very
4 precise on that point.
5       And we brought heavyweights in the form
6 of Dr. Mannino from -- with unbelievable
7 credentials.  He wrote the chapter on chronic
8 obstructive pulmonary disease in the Surgeon
9 General's report.
10       Dr. Illei, Johns Hopkins, pulmonary
11 pathologist, and Dr. Alvarez, the treating
12 doctor from Mayo who all laid out the case
13 indisputably, and they dignified the
14 proceedings because they have the gravitas, and
15 they have the experience, the credentials to
16 bring them to you so we can honor this process
17 with men of great scientific background and
18 dedicated lives to helping people.
19       They are heavyweights, and they have
20 tried to counterbalance it on one single
21 occasion with a lightweight.  And you won't let
22 that happen, because that is how you determine
23 the greater weight of the evidence.
24       They may raise a doubt.  And you know
25 they say in their own documents, Doubt is our
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 product.  Doubt is our product.
2       MR. REILLY:  Objection, Your Honor.
3 Motion.
4       THE COURT:  Overruled.
5       MR. SCHLESINGER:  However -- however, in
6 a case of the burden of proof being the greater
7 weight of evidence, the more convincing force
8 and effect of all the evidence in the case, as
9 His Honor read to you, as you'll have in the
10 back of the room if you use his instructions,
11 that greater weight of the evidence is, what's
12 more likely than not?
13       Was there a doubt?  Sure.
14       Does that doubt carry the day?  No,
15 because doubts are resolved -- any small doubts
16 are resolved in the favor of the plaintiff.  If
17 more likely than not, you believe the case --
18       MR. REILLY:  Objection --
19       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- a doubt is resolved
20 in our favor.
21       THE REPORTER:  Wait, one at a time.
22       MR. REILLY:  -- the instructions that
23 doubts are not resolved in favor of a party.
24       THE COURT:  Sustained.
25       MR. SCHLESINGER:  So anyway, you must
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 decide if punitive damages are warranted, and
2 it's in addition to compensatory damages.  And
3 punitive damages are warranted as punishment to
4 one or more defendants as a deterrent to
5 others.
6       The case is about Richard Boatright and
7 much more.  It's about the harms to 20 million
8 smokers who have died since the 1964 Surgeon
9 General's report --
10       MR. REILLY:  Objection, Your Honor.
11       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- has come out.
12       MR. REILLY:  It's not about --
13       THE COURT:  Just a second.
14       MR. REILLY:  This is not about 20 million
15 people.
16       THE COURT:  Sustained.
17       MR. SCHLESINGER:  If I may.  This is the
18 instruction that is being read to you.
19       When considering whether to award
20 punitive damages, you may consider any harm
21 defendants' conduct caused Richard Boatright.
22 You may also consider similar harms suffered by
23 other parties not to this lawsuit in assessing
24 the reprehensibility or wrongness of the
25 defendants' acts in -- as proven in this case.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 That is why you can consider harms to others.
2 When you get to punishment damages, it's -- in
3 order to determine was what they did indecent;
4 was it reprehensible?
5       Is killing 20 [sic] people for profit as
6 a business plan and disregarding the health of
7 the American people while lying to them since
8 the '50s saying, we want to be frank, we want
9 to be honest.  We'll stop making it if it's bad
10 for you.  We want to be straight with you.  We
11 would never make a bad product.  We'll fix it.
12 Here is a filter, even though it's fake.
13       Defrauding the American public, the
14 resulting harm that Dr. Proctor himself said
15 caused millions of unnecessary deaths.  This
16 goes to what you decide, more than Richard
17 Boatright, was the conduct reprehensible.
18       So you have this, you have this -- this
19 entry as a jury instruction, because you have
20 great power.  This is -- you may have more
21 power today than in any situation you've ever
22 held in your life.
23       You get to decide about enormous, great
24 historical wrong, a tragedy of monumental human
25 proportions, right here in Bartow, right now.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1       And when you think about it -- I have a
2 picture here of Mount Everest.  You have Mount
3 Everest.  The fact that Richard Boatright is in
4 this courtroom at this time before you, a
5 living smoker getting his day in court to face
6 Philip Morris.
7       And Mr. Reilly is -- as he said, he's a
8 nice guy, but he is not Philip Morris.  You're
9 not making a decision about is Mr. Reilly a
10 fine fellow or a decent man.
11       He's doing a job for his client.  He is
12 not a corporate representative.  He is not an
13 executive of Philip Morris.  They could have
14 brought anybody they want to come here and talk
15 to you about it.  They could have brought down
16 Mark Barrington-- (phonetic)
17       MR. REILLY:  Objection.
18       THE COURT:  Sustained.
19       MR. SCHLESINGER:  However, you're not
20 judging Mr. Reilly.  You're judging the conduct
21 of the company he represents.  That's more
22 important to remember.
23       More people have climbed to the top of
24 Mount Everest.  And this is the northern view
25 of Mount Everest from the Rongbuk Monastery in
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 Tibet.  The biggest mountain on earth.
2       There are more people that have stood on
3 the top of that mountain than have made it
4 alive into a courtroom to face Philip Morris as
5 a sick smoker in a case in the United States.
6       That's how rare.  That's how special.
7 That's how amazing it is that we're here with
8 this case.
9       MR. REILLY:  Objection.
10       THE COURT:  Overruled.
11       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Can I go back to my
12 original numbers?
13       Just put me back to where I was, please.
14       So in addition, the major conclusions in
15 these Surgeon General's reports -- and delve
16 through them, look through them.
17       This is the current thinking, cutting
18 edge.  This is still a current topic.  The
19 major conclusions in the Surgeon General 10,
20 the blue one, is about how tobacco causes
21 disease.
22       It's got a chapter on COPD and addiction
23 on page 105.  Nicotine, the fundamental reason
24 people smoke.  That's why these diseases get
25 caused.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1       Surgeon General 12, the red book, is all
2 about the children.  It's all about hooking
3 children.  That is the basis of the business,
4 and they want to say cigarettes are legal.
5 Well, they are legal.  But it's not legal to
6 sell them to kids.
7       And when the basis of the business is
8 children, is youth, that is something that
9 doesn't meet with the bounds of human decency.
10       His Honor read an instruction to you.
11 The corporations are entitled to be treated
12 like people.  Great.  I like that instruction.
13       They have the ability to be treated as a
14 person.  The idea being, don't come in there
15 and say, well, they're just a big corporation,
16 so we're going to slam them.
17       That's not fair.  Let's treat them as a
18 person.  I embrace that.
19       Because I say with the rights of human
20 personhood come the obligations and
21 responsibilities of being a person.
22       And I say, if you want to be treated like
23 a person, act like a person.
24       Be decent to people.  Robert Fulghum
25 wrote the book on everything I ever needed to
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 learn about life, I learned in kindergarten.
2 Remember ten points, a simple book.  Be nice to
3 people.  Don't hurt people.  If you hurt
4 someone, try to make it right.  It's a simple
5 thing.
6       And when you are indecent, when a
7 corporate business practice says we're going to
8 lie to our customers, we're going to give them
9 a drug that addicts them and kills them
10 50 percent of the time, one-fifth of all deaths
11 in America occur from cigarette-related
12 diseases.
13       I've been running down that Fort Fraser
14 Trail.  You go by the Oak Hill Cemetery.
15       Imagine if you visited that Oak Hill
16 Cemetery, that one in every five tombstones had
17 a little no-smoking sign on it, because that's
18 how many people are dying from the scourge of
19 tobacco.
20       You're here seeing an amazingly
21 monumental human wrong.  And you have amazing
22 power to do something about it today in this
23 courtroom.
24       MR. REILLY:  Objection, Your Honor,
25 conscious of the community.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1       THE COURT:  Overruled.
2       MR. SCHLESINGER:  The major conclusions
3 of the report.  I read you number 2.
4       Another one says:  The century long
5 epidemic of cigarette smoking has caused an
6 enormous public health tragedy.  Since the
7 first Surgeon General's report in 1964, more
8 than 20 million premature deaths can be
9 attributed to cigarette smoking.
10       Let's think about that.
11       Can I have the map of Florida.
12       Think about that for a second.  What does
13 that mean?  Despite 1964 coming out and saying
14 it caused cancer, 20 million people are dead.
15 What does that mean?
16       Okay.  That means that every single man,
17 woman and child that populate this state would
18 be gone.  20 million people is the population
19 of the state of Florida, 19.55 --
20       MR. REILLY:  Objection, Your Honor, this
21 is inappropriate.
22       THE COURT:  Overruled.
23       MR. SCHLESINGER:  To give you a sense of
24 scale.
25       And you put up my numbers board.  I don't

1 know which one that is.  The numbers board.
2       VIDEO TECHNICIAN:  Yes.
3       MR. SCHLESINGER:  The numbers numb.
4       In other words, you talk about
5 20 million.  Sometimes they say if one or two
6 or three people die, it's an incomprehensible
7 tragedy.
8       1200 people are dying every single day.
9 More than 1200 people in the United States.
10 That's like the equivalent of three jumbo jets
11 going down.  That would be front page news.
12       But when 480,000 people are dying a year,
13 adds up to $20 million, it's almost like, it's
14 a statistic.  It's hard to wrap your minds
15 around it.
16       But these are people and families and
17 loved ones and moms and dads and uncles and
18 aunties and grandparents.  And people -- not
19 only the people involved, but other people are
20 suffering.
21       So you are witnessing something, it's
22 Tobacco 101 --
23       MR. REILLY:  Objection.
24       THE COURT:  Overruled.
25       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Exposed to something
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 really bad.
2       So I thought of this, the numbers numb.
3 The numbers numb.
4       It's almost numbing, the amount.  That's
5 why I put up the state of Florida, which is
6 19.55 million people.
7       Imagine the entire -- go from Bartow in
8 every single direction to Key West and
9 Pensacola and not see a single soul.  They are
10 all gone.  That's what we've lost preventably
11 and prematurely because of the scourge of
12 tobacco epidemic.
13       Can you go back to where I was in the
14 punies, please.
15       So you have to decide if punishment is
16 warranted.  To me, it's the most important
17 thing in this case.  It clearly is.  You've got
18 to get through the preliminary questions and
19 address restorative damages to Mr. Boatright
20 and his wife.
21       Mr. Hammer suggested a number.  It's only
22 a suggestion.  If that number is too high to
23 you, if you say, you know, you're grubbing for
24 money, you're losing credibility with me, I
25 don't like that, you can order any amount you
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 want.
2       If it's 500,000.  If it's 2 million.  If
3 it's 3 million.  Whatever it is.  But when it
4 comes to medical bills and economics, a million
5 and a half, $2 million in economics, earnings,
6 lost earnings, medical bills.
7       When folks are laying in the hospital --
8 and Richard is there fighting for his life to
9 get a lung transplant.  His loved ones and
10 family members aren't going to the hospital and
11 saying, oh, my God, how much are your medicals
12 going to be.
13       They're like, when are you going to get
14 back out there and smell the roses?  Are you
15 going to make it?
16       So the human concepts of mental anguish
17 are so enormous.  And in this case they're so
18 substantial, they are worth considering.
19       Punitive damages are warranted.  You may
20 consider the Engle findings which are very
21 clear.  The Engle findings say fraud,
22 conspiracy, defective product.  And you own
23 these Engle findings.  They are binding on you.
24       And I say that in a way that both
25 captures you, but also recognizing folks don't
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 like to be said this is what you have to do.
2 They are binding.
3       And His Honor read, you may not disregard
4 them.  Mr. Reilly may not disregard them.  They
5 are binding.
6       But what is more, I say embrace them and
7 use them, because it also says it's as if you
8 found them yourself.
9       These findings are valid as if you found
10 them yourself.
11       Engle is not over.  Engle lives on.  This
12 is a generational fight.  Going back to 1960
13 when I read to you that New England Journal of
14 Medicine article saying the behavior of the
15 tobacco industry has been deplorable and hasn't
16 changed, and Dr. Proctor said it hasn't
17 changed.
18       It's been a generation since Engle was
19 started.  And now these are the Engle progeny
20 cases, and they go on.  And they go into the
21 future.  And you are a point in time that can
22 help with that.
23       So these are the things that can give
24 rise to reprehensible behavior.
25       We didn't do a year-long trial with a
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 million documents like Engle.  We gave you a
2 smattering to give you a sense of just how
3 incredibly wrongful, intentionally wrongful,
4 how -- the losing of the moral compass, losing
5 the direction that decent humans should treat
6 each other.  Reckless disregard for human life,
7 or a lack of care.
8       So it's conscious indifference to the
9 consequences.  Or wanton and recklessly
10 disregarding the safety and welfare of the
11 product or reckless indifference to the rights
12 of others to be equivalent to intentional
13 violation of those rights.
14       All those things are applicable here, and
15 the Engle findings lay them all out.  Liggett
16 is only in because they were part of a
17 conspiracy to commit fraud.
18       So there's one question on Engle was, is
19 this the kind of thing that contributed to what
20 happened?
21       So I say, what should a responsible
22 manufacturer do?  Think about all the
23 scientists, think about the brilliant men, the
24 cleverness, the ingenious way they formed this
25 conspiracy.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1       What if that energy had been directed to
2 good.  To helping people.  Where would we be
3 medically.  How many fewer deaths.  There would
4 have been millions fewer deaths would we have
5 seen had they done that.  And they didn't.
6       So that is why you can say to them, we
7 reject this conduct, in the strongest possible
8 terms.  We don't want this behavior.
9       So I say you should protect children, you
10 should not addict them.
11       That's what we should do.  We should not
12 be preying on children.  There should not be
13 predation on youngsters, the only basis of the
14 business.
15       If you don't start smoking before 18, you
16 don't start smoking.  The business goes down to
17 90 percent.
18       Put those cigarettes behind the counter
19 of the pharmacy, require ID for 21 years of
20 age.  And then, instead of having a
21 multibillion dollar business, they've got a
22 hundreds of millions of dollar business.  It's
23 still a business, but it's more responsible.
24       But this is -- another thing.  Cure,
25 don't cause.  Couldn't they have directed their
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 energies, their scientists, their medical
2 people to curing and not causing this?  Yes,
3 they could.
4       But here is what they're really
5 interested in.  Who ain't for more money?
6       And they know back in the '60s, they
7 can't count it as a drug, because there are
8 dangerous FDA implications going behind those
9 walls.
10       Forty years later, the FDA gets ahold of
11 them.  What does Dr. Proctor say.  They're just
12 as dangerous.  Not a single change has been
13 made.  They wield too much power and influence,
14 and they block any attempts by the FDA.
15       In a sense, you hold more power than the
16 FDA today.  You can do something.  You can make
17 an expression of moral condemnation --
18       MR. REILLY:  Objection, Your Honor.
19       MR. SCHLESINGER:  You can say something
20 to the defendant.
21       THE COURT:  Overruled.
22       MR. SCHLESINGER:  That we do not accept
23 this behavior.
24       I showed you this one.  You consider
25 wrongfulness to others.  It's bigger than just
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 Richard.
2       And Richard presents an opportunity.
3 He's a generic smoker.  Like he said to you, I
4 was the perfect customer.
5       He did everything they wanted to do.  He
6 started smoking at 12 years old.  He smoked
7 them up silly.  He smoked cigarettes, he was
8 terribly addicted to them.
9       And that's the whole business model.  The
10 center of their universe is addiction.  He
11 bought their gear, and he did what they wanted
12 him to do.
13       So I told you it's about Richard, but
14 much more, because it presents an opportunity
15 going forward to enact deterrence, not just to
16 the tobacco companies, but other companies that
17 might not put the safety of their customers
18 ahead of their corporate profits.
19       So the numbers numb, I've told you that,
20 and it's about truth and consequences.  When
21 you engineer for addiction, there will be
22 consequences.
23       When you lie to the American public,
24 there will be consequences.
25       When you offer up solutions, such as
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 filters which do nothing, there will be
2 consequences.
3       So when you are tricking folks with fake
4 filters that are nothing more than a fraud for
5 a health reassurance concept, there will be
6 consequences.
7       And they knew it.  And they knew it.
8 Back in the '60s.
9       The position we're taking is going to be
10 subject to a finding.  We're making false and
11 misleading statements to promote the sales of
12 cigarettes.
13       They knew it.  And, of course, punishment
14 damages is a higher burden of proof.
15       Remember I said on balance, the greater
16 weight of the evidence?
17       You must find that it's clear and
18 convincing evidence.  It's a higher burden of
19 proof, meaning you must be able to say it's
20 precise.  It's explicit.  And it doesn't
21 confuse me.
22       I know what they did now, those records,
23 those internal documents.  We've got the goods
24 on them.  Those internal documents lay it all
25 out, and you've seen them.  You were exposed to
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 Tobacco 101.
2       A lot of people have not seen it, even
3 though they were available.  Six jurors at a
4 time, we're learning about this.  And it should
5 be lacking in confusion and form a firm belief
6 or conviction about the matter at issue.
7       Here is the thing.  Lacking confusion.
8 There ain't no illusion about the confusion.
9 There's no doubt about the doubt.
10       They offered the illusion of filtration.
11 They said so.  That's how you know.
12       They offered a doubt campaign that they
13 celebrated as a brilliant holding strategy that
14 enabled them to win many, many, many victories
15 in litigation and other fronts, because that
16 was a big part of the arm of the conspiracy, as
17 Dr. Proctor testified.
18       So, he meets those standards.  He smoked
19 almost always Marlboros, one of the most
20 popular brands, the most popular brand in the
21 world.
22       What did Dr. Proctor say about it?  This
23 is the greatest branded cause of death in the
24 history of human civilization.
25       You know, I thought I knew.  But now I
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 know.
2       Class membership is not about fault.
3 Please pay attention to that carefully.
4       Because there is a tendency to conflate,
5 to mix, to confuse the idea that in class
6 membership, which is a simple question, okay,
7 Dr. Tabb's note, chronic bronchitis secondary
8 to tobacco abuse, which was defined by Mannino
9 and Alvarez as tobacco addiction, like drug
10 abuse, that note alone is everything you need
11 to know about class membership.
12       Did he have a manifestation, the
13 appearance of the signs and symptoms of
14 suffering of a disease, chronic bronchitis,
15 which is part of COPD.
16       Did he have it before 1996 in November?
17 Yes, this is 1992.
18       Was it caused by drug addiction?  Yes, it
19 was secondary to tobacco abuse, which is
20 tobacco addiction.
21       There is no way to get around it.  And,
22 quite frankly, they hook teenagers and children
23 and those guys become lifelong customers.
24       Fishermen use hooks.  Fish never see the
25 hook.  That's the whole idea.  And when they
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 hook them, like Dr. Tamol said in the document:
2 Keep a minimum amount of nicotine required to
3 keep the normal smoker hooked.
4       They know, they've got them hooked.
5 That's just the way it is.
6       Class membership is not about fault.
7 Class membership is only, was he a sick smoker?
8       There was 700,000 of them during the
9 period of years of the Engle class period
10 between 1990 and '96, and -- I mean, it would
11 be a heck of a waste of time and resources to
12 pick the wrong one.  And I don't think we did.
13       He has clear and convincing organic,
14 meaning legitimate.  It appeared in the chart,
15 unrelated to anything, that the man was seeking
16 medical care in the '90s.
17       So when you get to class membership, it's
18 not about fault.
19       Later, there is a question on fault and
20 you can compare the fault.  You can say Richard
21 should have started -- tried harder to quit.
22 But the records are so clear that he was
23 tormented.  He tried so hard to quit.
24 Especially in '01, '02, '03.  On cigarettes,
25 off cigarettes.  Going to counseling, getting
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 medicines.
2       Addiction is a scourge.  It is so
3 powerful, so overwhelming.  It destroys free
4 choice.  He was powerfully addicted.  No doubt.
5       So fault is after class membership.  Do
6 not get hung up on the concept that he might
7 have been at fault for not trying harder to
8 quit.
9       They want to shine a floodlight.  They
10 want to shine a floodlight -- excuse me, a
11 spotlight on Richard.
12       Look at Richard.  Look at Richard.  What
13 did Richard do?  It's like anything else.  If
14 you don't have a leg to stand on, on your
15 conduct, one of attack approaches is break the
16 other guy's leg.
17       If you don't have a leg to stand on on
18 what you did 50 years over, hence, break the
19 other guy's leg.
20       And why does it work?  It works.  If you
21 watched any of the campaign news, was all that
22 advertising for elections negative.  Even
23 though we hate it, we hate it, it must work.
24 Because at some level psychologically, it gets
25 to us.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1       Focus on Richard.  I say turn on the
2 floodlights and look at Richard and then look
3 at what is on either side of Richard.  Liggett
4 and Philip Morris leading him down the aisle,
5 encouraging addiction all the way along,
6 denying the harms of smoking, saying it's an
7 open question.  Creating doubt.
8       Operation stumbling block, a
9 de-motivation campaign for drug addicted
10 cigarette smokers in denial to keep smoking.
11       That's what happened.  That's the truth
12 of it.  That's the dirty little secret that
13 hides in plain sight.  Catching those kids.
14       The Engle class period.  This is the
15 trampoline case, as the fellow they brought,
16 Dr. Schroeder, said.  Strict no landing zone.
17       I thought about it.  Because I used to
18 have Shelties.  They would run around.  The
19 birds would come out in the yard.  They would
20 never let the birds land.  They would chase the
21 birds, and they'd fly.  And I said my Shelties
22 enforced a strict no landing policy in the
23 backyard.
24       And that's what I thought of that idea.
25 Here it is, this is the trampoline.  They are
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 using the technical class period.  No matter
2 what tries to get in there, boing, everything
3 bounces out.  Ain't nobody going to be in the
4 class period if the tobacco defense approach
5 has anything to do it with it.
6       That's not the reality of what these
7 records show.
8       Dr. Tabb saw this gentleman on four
9 consecutive occasions, over an entire year and
10 always kept the same diagnosis, chronic
11 bronchitis, going throughout the record.
12       He saw him.  Kept the same treatment in
13 July.  Keep the same treatment in August.  Keep
14 the same treatment in October.
15       The only guy they're talking about,
16 Dr. Catz, he only saw him one time.
17       And what Dr. Schroeder got hung by his
18 own petard was he had just come from the Taylor
19 case two days earlier up in Jacksonville where
20 my friend Jimmy Gustafson is trying the case,
21 and he said --
22       MR. REILLY:  Objection.
23       THE COURT:  Overruled.
24       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- well, can you make
25 the diagnosis or distinguish between COPD and
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 asthma if you haven't had continuity of care
2 and multiple visits?  Is that important?  It's
3 extremely important.
4       All of a sudden, the fact that Dr. Catz
5 only saw him one time wasn't extremely
6 important.  And Dr. Catz said he's got COPD on
7 the testing.
8       And Dr. Mannino, a world's expert,
9 explained this is COPD.
10       So, you know, you have to look at the
11 case in terms of what is reality.  What is
12 obvious.
13       And what do they say?
14       Business is selling nicotine.  Nicotine
15 is the drug.  They describe their customers as
16 a rat in a cage.  An essential commodity, a
17 habitual act.  Put a hungry rat in a cage -- I
18 mean, you know, this is their business.
19 Nicotine is the center of the universe.  No one
20 has ever smoked without nicotine.  The product
21 is nicotine.  The cigarette is a package.
22       The cigarette pack is a storage container
23 for a day's supply of nicotine.
24       Very few consumers are aware of the
25 effects of nicotine and its addictive nature
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 and that nicotine is a poison.
2       Remember this?  We tabbed Motives of
3 Incentives and showed the book.  Because he had
4 never seen one of those.
5       It's amazing what you can find nowadays.
6 This is the book.  And it says:  No doubt about
7 it.  It's the nicotine.
8       William Dunn, the nicotine kid from
9 Philip Morris.  No doubt about it.  It's the
10 nicotine.  Way back in the '70s, they
11 celebrated this.  This was their business.
12       Smoking is not a free choice.  When you
13 start smoking as a teenager and become
14 addicted, you can't quit.  Very few people can
15 quit.  And the prevalence of nicotine
16 dependence is the highest addiction in the
17 world.
18       Alvarez says it's one of the most
19 addictive substances there is, more addictive
20 than heroin because of the relapse.  You try,
21 you fall back.
22       And it's a normal consumer product.  How
23 do you tell somebody it's not normal?  You
24 have -- it looks like this.
25       A kid comes up and picks up a pack of
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 cigarettes with the pretty colors on it and
2 says:  Daddy, what is this?
3       You say:  Son, it's bad.
4       He says:  Doesn't look bad.
5       Well, it doesn't look bad.  It looks like
6 everything else.  It looks like everything
7 else.  It can be the same colored patterns as
8 the toys he's playing with.
9       So how are you supposed to teach the kids
10 that it's bad in an environment where when our
11 client was smoking in the early '60s, more than
12 half the kids his age were smoking.
13       When Claude Teague who said on the youth
14 market at 18, what is immoral?
15       My client had -- you're going to judge
16 his responsibility in combination with theirs
17 in terms of starting to smoke at 12.  And what
18 could a future -- what long-range future plans
19 could a 12-year-old have?  Very few.
20       And here it is.  Manifestation.
21 Manifestation you'll see.  The judge didn't say
22 manifestation means it has to be diagnosed.  It
23 emerges, it manifests.  The simple meaning of
24 the term.
25       He was suffering from the disease.  The
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 manifestation is clear.  Here it is.
2       This is class membership right here.  Bar
3 none, sine qua non, unless they can convince
4 you there's something wrong with this note and
5 there isn't.
6       This note, as Alvarez said, leads to
7 Dr. Alvarez's treatment in 2010.  And he said
8 it was one continuous process, the emphysema,
9 the result of this man losing his lungs,
10 started and was demonstrated in 1992.  Same
11 process.
12       That's a treating doctor, Dr. Alvarez.
13 Not hired by anybody, not paid any kind of
14 expert witness fees, to -- he's just a guy that
15 doesn't testify, like Mannino doesn't come into
16 court and testify.
17       Illei doesn't come into court and testify
18 to tell you -- to honor the system with
19 expertise where we are honored to bring you
20 world class experts.
21       I wish there was a classroom of people
22 here to be able to see what they have to say
23 because of what they were teaching.
24       Compatible with COPD.  And Mannino
25 explained extensively, that sure looked like
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 COPD.
2       And what was helping this man, Atrovent,
3 a COPD drug.  We learned a lot about this in
4 this trial.  I didn't even really know that
5 much about it.  45,000 pages.  I got an in.  I
6 didn't read them.  Somebody said they did.
7       Think about whether it was physically
8 possible to go through 45,000 records.  It was
9 not.
10       History of asthma and emphysema.  This is
11 what the patient said to a doctor in an ER
12 visit as to what he thought he had.
13       And by the way, Dr. Keeler didn't
14 diagnose asthma.  She diagnosed an acute
15 reaction to an adrenaline drug.  That's what he
16 was there for.  He didn't go to the ER for a
17 special evaluation of his well-being, his lung
18 conditions.
19       He said emphysema, and he told you, I
20 learned from these guys that I was sick with a
21 smoking-related disease.
22       The proof is in the pudding.  Actions
23 speak louder than words.
24       In '94, in the doctor's office, the man
25 is saying, what have you got?
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1       I got asthma and emphysema.
2       He never said he didn't have asthma.  But
3 he's got both.
4       And then in '99 at the Watkins Clinic.
5 There's a look-back note where someone says his
6 spirometry did show a moderate obstructive
7 ventilatory defect in '92.
8       In 2004.  How organic, how much the ring
9 of truth does this note have.  What year did
10 you know you had a lung disease?  1996.  He
11 knew he had a lung disease.
12       And then the lung pathology, of course,
13 said chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
14 emphysema and chronic bronchitis.
15       That's when we actually looked at the
16 slides of the lungs, that's what the man had.
17       But you know it wasn't asthma in '96.
18 And it's approximately what year, and it's
19 going back in time to the period between '90
20 and '96.  1.  2.  3.  4.  References that
21 period.
22       It's easy.
23       And then every single thing about the
24 disease being caused by tobacco abuse.  Chronic
25 bronchitis secondary tobacco abuse.  Tobacco
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 abuse of two and a half per day times 30 years
2 resulting in emphysema.  Severe obstructive
3 airway disease secondary to many years of
4 tobacco abuse.  Tobacco addiction all
5 throughout the board.
6       We shouldn't be fighting about this.
7 Okay?
8       And Donna Hernandez.  She didn't get a
9 couple things right.  I'm not going to spend a
10 lot of time on her right now.
11       Millions are caught in the web of deceit.
12 So was Richard.  There is 40 million Americans.
13       This is 2014.  40 million Americans
14 caught in the web of tobacco dependence.  Every
15 day, kids under 18 are smoking, and a bunch of
16 them --
17       MS. ST. PETER-GRIFFITH:  Your Honor, I
18 would object to this demonstrative.  It has the
19 wrong --
20       MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is.
21       MS. ST. PETER-GRIFFITH:  Wrong defendant.
22       MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'll move on.
23       So anyway, let me read another major
24 conclusion from the report.
25       Dr. Proctor started out.  Dr. Proctor,
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 you know -- you know, Dr. Proctor looks to help
2 people.  He dedicated his life to researching
3 the truth of the history of the tobacco
4 misconduct.
5       And he is a true scholar, and he did a
6 great job coming into this courtroom, I think,
7 to really show you things that you couldn't
8 even imagine.
9       And he said something about, I think
10 they're too dangerous to be marketed.  I think
11 these drugs are just too dangerous to be
12 marketed.
13       It's funny, because in the Surgeon
14 General 2014, hot off the press, focusing on
15 the role the tobacco industry played in
16 creating this epidemic.
17       Major conclusion number 9:  The burden of
18 death and disease from tobacco use in the
19 United States is overwhelmingly caused by
20 cigarettes and other combusted tobacco
21 products.  Rapid elimination of their use will
22 dramatically reduce this burden.
23       If you took cigarette smoking out of this
24 country, it's like finding a vaccine.  It stops
25 a third of all cancers.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1       So Proctor is in alignment with the
2 Surgeon General.  He's actually a senior
3 scientific reviewer of the Surgeon General.
4       Remember, I said build a better
5 mousetrap.
6       You can go back to the other picture.
7       Build a better mousetrap, and the world
8 will beat a path to your door.
9       Don't let them create a false equivalency
10 in the defense of the case by saying, okay, we
11 were able to get Schroeder up to about a
12 million dollars of earnings.  And Dr. Proctor,
13 he's probably earned about $2 million.
14       Well, did he earn $2 million because he
15 invented the better mousetrap and the world
16 beat a path to his door.
17       What is the way in which you get an
18 expert witness?
19       You go to the literature, you go to the
20 science, you research, you study, you look who
21 has committed themselves on paper to scholarly
22 articles, books, learning, teaching, through a
23 lifetime dedicated to becoming an expert.
24 Building that better mousetrap.
25       He built that better mousetrap.  And
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 because he was an expert, the world beat a path
2 to his door.
3       Here in Florida, the only state where
4 these Engle progeny cases are going on, his
5 expertise has been sought out because he's
6 earned it.  He deserved it.  He built a better
7 mousetrap, and the world beat a path to his
8 door.
9       There was no world beating any path to
10 Dr. Schroeder's door.  He was a random pickup
11 in Kansas City, the home base of one of the
12 major firms for the defendants, and they
13 brought the guy in.
14       And I submit to you, yeah, he may be good
15 at doing some things.  We will talk about it a
16 little bit more.
17       I'm trying not to go off on Schroeder,
18 because I feel that enough was demonstrated to
19 discount him.  But I have a few choice words
20 for him in rebuttal.  Because I get another 15,
21 20 minutes.
22       THE COURT:  You have 30 minutes left.
23       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thank you, Judge.
24       I'm going to be taking a little bit from
25 my back end, but we'll keep going.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1       So Heimann said, Philip Morris, we want
2 people to rely.  That's why you can check off
3 those boxes.
4       Did their lies -- lies cost lives?  Did
5 their lies lead to my client and many, many
6 others like him getting sick?  They clearly
7 did.
8       Tons of advertising spent to convince
9 folks to keep smoking and make it glamorous.
10       You know about what they said about the
11 Marlboro Adventure Team, the great success of
12 their brands, their marketings.
13       One of the things very interesting.  The
14 tobacco industry tries to disappear in this
15 courtroom.  Cigarettes fall out of trees, we
16 don't grow them.  They are a crop.  We just
17 harvest them.
18       I thought of that children's story,
19 Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.  How about
20 cloudy with a chance of cigarettes.  They don't
21 just fall out of the sky.  They are the
22 manufacturer.  And yet we are the ones bringing
23 you the gear and the advertisements and showing
24 you the boxes.
25       This is their beloved, most proud logo,
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 the most successful logo in the history of the
2 world, and you never saw one time that they
3 ever showed you anything from their proud logo.
4       You can see the sign on the gas station
5 down at the racetrack down the way, if you're
6 driving down 98.
7       But you didn't see any of it in here.
8 Because just like Dr. Proctor says, they want
9 to disappear.
10       Here is my replacement smoker, 12 years
11 old.  He was older than that here.  But he was
12 12 years old.
13       The strategic research report from Diane
14 Burrows, we must capture the youth market, we
15 must get the share of young smokers.  They're
16 the only source of replacement smokers.
17       That is patently offensive.  It's
18 reprehensible.  It's not the kind of conduct
19 that decent people can accept or should accept
20 in this country.
21       In any event, Marlboro red and its rapid
22 growth and success.  As teenagers, there is a
23 great bonanza getting to kids.  Younger adults
24 with critical factor.  This is where it all
25 comes from.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1       Replacement smokers.  Getting the
2 14-year-olds, getting the 12-year-olds.  All
3 these are critical.
4       If we're going to prosper, we must get
5 the youth market.  And they know that kids
6 don't smoke because they are addicted to
7 nicotine.  They don't know what to expect from
8 nicotine.  They smoke to be cool or -- look at
9 the cowboy.
10       How about this.  These folks are coming
11 along, doing what they're doing, and they are
12 not understanding this central truth.  Here is
13 what they -- I'm not a drug addict.  I'm a
14 cowboy.
15       That isn't the truth.  That isn't reality
16 in this case.
17       So Diane Burrows worked it all out.  They
18 were competing internally for kids, but they
19 weren't admitting that publicly.  Publicly,
20 they were denying it.
21       It was such an incendiary word they had
22 to change the code language in their papers.
23 Hey, you know what, don't say youth anymore.
24 Call the 12-year-olds young adults.
25       Because they knew if these documents get
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 out, folks would be offended.
2       How did you feel the first time you
3 started seeing these documents?  How did it
4 make you feel when you saw the words behind the
5 general idea, folks generally may think tobacco
6 did something bad?
7       But everyone knows it's bad for you.  So
8 it's all on them.
9       It's not like that.  There's something
10 driving this.
11       Anyway, Marlboro is going for the
12 13-year-olds, they are going for the
13 12-year-olds.
14       The nicotine response is absent in the
15 pre-smoker, and it's overwhelmingly important
16 in the smoker who's lost the freedom to choose.
17 Plus plus plus, it's all about the nicotine.
18       And here, my client is -- he wrote about
19 my client.
20       On January 6, 1965, when he was 12 years
21 old, he was born on January 1, '53.  He was 12
22 years old.  And at 12 years old, they knew that
23 report, the Surgeon General's report, was going
24 to cause a slowdown in sales for a little bit,
25 because the Surgeon General came out and said,
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 hey, it causes lung cancer.
2       But when it came to the young kids, they
3 recognized there's been a backlog of youth who
4 have refrained from taking up smoking in the
5 face of the report, and a substantial number of
6 these can be expected to join this year's crop
7 of prospects.
8       Richard Boatright.  They were right about
9 him.  He was that year's crop of prospects.  He
10 began smoking in 1965, and there is the crop.
11 The orange tree right down the Fraser Trail.
12 Right down the Fraser Trail, down this way.
13 You can run or bicycle.
14       A bunch of oranges, a crop.
15       They are dehumanizing, because they are
16 not thinking about these people.
17       It's like when the ranchers on the farms
18 are looking at the cows, there's baby cows, all
19 the little guys laying around.  They walk down
20 and they're like, little hundred dollar bills.
21 All those calves, or literally those little
22 veals are $100 bills.  They are looking at them
23 as money.  Cash crop.  They're smokers, those
24 kids.  That's the cash crop.
25       That just ain't right.  And it isn't
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 right in a way that is so astonishingly,
2 powerfully wrong that y'all can reject it.
3       You can say I can't accept it.
4       That's why when you speak as one voice to
5 this company today, you're expressing something
6 on behalf of a lot of people.  But it's a
7 powerful message you can send.  It's a powerful
8 message.
9       This is what Claude Teague said.  And
10 I -- we have deliberately played down the role
11 of nicotine, hence the nonsmoker has little or
12 no knowledge of what satisfactions it may offer
13 him and no desire to try it.
14       Instead, we must convince him with wholly
15 irrational reasons that he should try smoking,
16 in the hope that he will for himself then
17 discover the real "satisfactions" obtainable.
18       We scramble.  We stay up all night.  We
19 work really hard to try to come up with a
20 presentation to you.
21       And this document, I call the chiller.
22 Because the more I read it -- and I hope the
23 more you read it, and it's in evidence and you
24 can read it, it's chilling.
25       Look what he's saying.  We're going to
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 convince them with wholly irrational reasons
2 they should try smoking.
3       You'll be cool.  You're not going to be a
4 drug addict.  You're a cowboy.
5       In the hope that he would then
6 discover -- and remember how Proctor and Jon
7 talked about what it means when they put the
8 quotations around things.
9       The real "satisfactions" obtainable.  The
10 code word for satisfactions is addiction.
11       That's what they're doing.
12 Bait-and-switch.  Trick them and hook them, you
13 know.
14       So all about nicotine -- yeah, I know,
15 I'm watching.
16       All about nicotine.
17       You know, the warnings are not effective.
18       What do you do when you have a little kid
19 and -- you see a kid and he's getting ready to
20 get on the diving board, and the diving board
21 goes into an empty pool, and it says No Diving.
22       And they want to say, well, the
23 warnings -- you've been warned.  Richard,
24 you've been warned.
25       Okay, the fine print on the side of the
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 package.  Richard, you've been warned.
2       If a responsible, decent human being sees
3 a kid getting ready to jump into an empty pool,
4 going past the sign on the diving board that
5 says No Diving, does he say, it's okay.  He's
6 been warned.  Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
7       Is that what they do, they encourage him?
8 Or do they do everything in their power to stop
9 him.  They scream, they run to try to grab him
10 and stop him.
11       What do they do?  What do responsible,
12 decent people -- and if you're going to be
13 treated like a person, act like a person.  What
14 do decent, responsible people do.  Everything
15 they can to stop that kid from jumping in that
16 pool.  Because he's going to get hurt.
17 Something is going to happen to him.
18       That's what should be done in this case.
19 Nobody can stop.  We all know that.  It's all
20 about who ain't for more money?
21       It's all about they will go out of
22 business if they lose the nicotine.
23       We are suffering from the externally
24 repressed fear that we are devoting our
25 business lives to the propagation of lung
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 cancer.
2       When you know that and you continue that
3 and you go forward with that, there's got to be
4 a day of reckoning.  There's got to be the
5 truth and the consequences.  The truth matters.
6 There's got to be a day of reckoning.
7       That's why punishment, as St. Augustine
8 said, is justice for the unjust.  And it's a
9 fervent prayer we bring to you that you see
10 this already, that I'm able to stitch this
11 together for you after this lengthy trial.
12 Where you've taken and been so responsible, as
13 a six-man jury without an alternate, to go over
14 the time, to spend the time with us and learn
15 this.
16       I come up here and I say I want -- can I
17 think of something that's true and beautiful
18 and American and meaningful to get you to see
19 that it's not that Richard is here grubbing for
20 money, that there's something bigger than that,
21 and it's a chance to do what is right and see
22 things as they are in a world and a culture
23 that has deceived everybody.
24       So, you know, there's an unattractive
25 side effect.  It causes cancer.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1       They always knew it caused cancer.  They
2 didn't care.  They got together in the '50s, we
3 showed you that Frank Statement.  They lied to
4 the public.  We're going to find out and get to
5 the bottom of it.  It was a doubt campaign.
6       They said:  Don't worry about it, let the
7 scientists do the worrying.
8       But really, they knew it was a habit they
9 couldn't break.  They knew what was going on.
10 They all worked together.  It was amazing they
11 could keep that conspiracy together for so
12 long.  It was amazing to think of the idea,
13 don't just deny it.  Just keep doubt open.
14 Just keep it an open question.  We're not
15 really sure.
16       It went on for decades.  And all those
17 PSAs and all those executives on television,
18 denying the harms or keeping the doubt open.
19 Those are national news stories, and they
20 wanted Richard to see them, just like they
21 wanted millions of Americans to see them.
22       And he did see them.  That was their
23 goal.
24       They celebrated the success of this.
25 They belittled and attacked the Surgeon
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 General.
2       And then the Frank Statement.  You know
3 about that.  You knew they would go out of
4 business if they would stop making it.
5       They knew it was a brilliant and
6 successful strategy that worked.
7       On all the major fronts.  Litigation.  It
8 was always a holding strategy.  Doubt the
9 health charge without denying it.  It was set
10 up as an industry shield and a front.  It was
11 never a legitimate scientific operation.
12       The key word was confusion.  Doubt is our
13 product.  Doubt is our product.
14       The cigarette industry, doubt is our
15 product.
16       Give those smokers a psychological crutch
17 and self-rationale to keep smoking.
18       Why does it connect?  Why does lies, why
19 does conspiracy, why does all that cause my
20 client as a cause, as a contributing cause,
21 along with any other causes, his human
22 weaknesses in not trying harder to quit.
23       Which I don't know how these records
24 could reveal anybody that didn't try harder to
25 quit than Richard Boatright.  Tormented smoker
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 for decades.
2       And young.  He didn't have as much time
3 as the average person, in his late 30s, early
4 40s.  That's when a lot of people start really
5 thinking seriously about quitting.  He was
6 already getting sick.  You don't expect that.
7       Lies cost lives.  That's what Dr. Proctor
8 testified to, and that's why on those questions
9 of did the conspiracy contribute to what
10 happened to Mr. Boatright, the answer is yes.
11       Did the fraud and the concealment and the
12 suppression contribute to what happened to
13 Mr. Boatright?  The answer is yes.
14       And Proctor said -- he blamed millions of
15 deaths on this conspiracy.  They kept cigarette
16 sales going, they bought themselves a lot of
17 time.
18       Imagine how many lives would have been
19 saved if this had been stopped 20, 30 years
20 ago, if they had come clean.
21       If you come up with an antagonist in
22 nicotine, we're going to put ourselves out of
23 business.
24       If we do that, we are in the process of
25 digging our own grave.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1       No problem digging the graves of 480,000
2 Americans every year, but they anthropomorphize
3 themselves, they're concerned about their
4 health, they have a survival instinct, they
5 don't want to dig their own grave.
6       They avoid any subjects on study that
7 relates human disease to smoke.
8       What are they going to do if they get
9 results with regard to the addiction of
10 nicotine?  They bury it.  Bury results.
11       And he talked about not burying it.
12 They're in the pharmaceutical industry.  They
13 knew this in the '70s, and they claimed we
14 don't know, nobody knows, they didn't know --
15 if they didn't know, if executives didn't know,
16 if the Tobacco Institute didn't know, and they
17 kept putting this message out, how is my client
18 supposed to know?
19       If they had it over the Surgeon General,
20 what chance did my client have?  He was a young
21 kid.  He smoked in the era of Marlboro.  He
22 grew up in the culture they created.
23       He grew up in the conspiracy.  He was
24 born in 1953, the year they had the conspiracy.
25       They controlled the nicotine, they used
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 diammonium phosphate, they made additives to
2 precisely control the nicotine, to freebase the
3 molecule to make it so powerful.
4       They could control it, optimum
5 specificity.  All these things that are
6 designed.
7       This is a highly sophisticated nicotine
8 delivery disease.  Deliberating free nicotine.
9 That's what made the sales take off in
10 Marlboro.  It was the soul of Marlboro was this
11 ammoniation.  Made sales go up.
12       They had many, many opportunities to come
13 clean, tell the truth.  Take a different tact.
14 Get back on a moral compass, go the right way,
15 and they did not.
16       And when it comes to witnesses, you may
17 say to yourself, how could a guy like that -- I
18 was listening to Dr. Schroeder.  Maybe you
19 weren't believing him.  Maybe you were doubting
20 him.  Maybe you were saying, this is so
21 outrageous, it's so off topic.  I don't know
22 how it could be allowed to be said.
23       It's because His Honor gives you the
24 power to -- these are the believability of
25 witnesses, but down here you have a special
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 instruction, special power for witnesses.
2       When it comes to a guy that wants to call
3 himself an expert, you can consider what kind
4 of credentials he has, and you can reject what
5 he has to say.
6       I submit to you, you should reject what
7 he has to say.
8       Is that too much?
9       But that's -- that's where it is.  Okay?
10       You know, this is the record that shows
11 he had immunosuppression that led to the
12 colostomy.  It's embarrassing.  That's just the
13 truth of it.
14       These are the Engle jury findings.
15 Fraud, conspiracy, negligence.
16       I'm going to save a few minutes.  I'm
17 going to say thank you very much.
18       I know I talk fast.  I always tell myself
19 I'll slow down.  But I try to get a lot in.
20       Mr. Reilly is going to have a chance to
21 talk to you, and I ask you to give him the same
22 kind of attention you've given me.
23       I'll have about 15 minutes to address you
24 on the back end to comment on what he had to
25 say.

1       Thank you.


14       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Let me make sure this
15 is working.
16       Is it working?
17       Let's take a look at this.  May 22, 1992.
18 Allergic rhinitis and asthma, chronic
19 bronchitis secondary to tobacco abuse.
20       That is class membership in a nutshell
21 from Dr. Tabb.
22       See it?  That is class membership from
23 Dr. Tabb.
24       Nicoderm, all of this, all of these
25 records, when he's constantly having bronchitis

1 and asthma, they're always trying to get him to
2 stop smoking.  He's constantly taking smoking
3 cessation aids.  He's deeply addicted,
4 according to Mannino, who is unrebutted in that
5 regard.  There is no doubt.
6       How about this.
7       Ooh, what about that?
8       Let's just make pretend for a second that
9 instead of May 22, 1992, it said May 22, 1982.
10       What do you think Mr. Reilly would do
11 with that record if he had that chart to work
12 with?  Do you think he would be supporting it
13 and saying trampoline defense, he's out, he's
14 before 1990.  He's too soon.
15       Do you want to know what the importance
16 of that record is?  Turn it around and ask
17 yourself what would they be doing if they had
18 that record and it said 1982.
19       Every single thing else in the case,
20 exactly the same.  What do you think they would
21 be doing?
22       Because that is a critically important
23 record.  It is contemporaneous, and it
24 shouldn't be missed.
25       Now look at this.  Dr. Waller Tabb.  He

1 saw this man four different occasions.  May
2 21st of '92.  May 21.  He talked about
3 bronchitis, attacks asthma.  He made the
4 diagnosis, chronic bronchitis secondary to
5 tobacco abuse.  All by itself, that's class
6 membership.
7       Secondary to tobacco addiction.  That's
8 class membership.
9       But then he saw him in June.  Continue
10 everything as is.  Those records are in there.
11 You haven't seen them.  You will see them.
12       Then he saw him in August.  Continue
13 everything as is.  You'll see them.
14       But then he saw him in October.  Continue
15 everything as is.  Chronic bronchitis,
16 secondary to tobacco abuse was the ongoing
17 situation all the way through.
18       He didn't rewrite on the chart.  He
19 didn't rewrite his diagnosis.  But the fact is,
20 he didn't change anything.  He said continue
21 everything as is.
22       So this gentleman saw him for months and
23 months and months.
24       And then a year later, in May 25 of '93,
25 he okayed six months for refills of Atrovent,

1 because that's what helped my client.  A
2 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease medicine,
3 and that's what he used.
4       So then the next one here -- now, let me
5 show you this.  Super important.  Okay?
6       This is the document in the record, the
7 olden days of a medical record, the clinic, the
8 Watson Clinic.  You open it up, and you look in
9 the record.  And what do you see in the record?
10 No one has seen this until right now.
11       Can we blow this up, Keith?
12       VIDEO TECHNICIAN:  Go ahead.
13       MR. SCHLESINGER:  "Keep in front of
14 chart."
15       The page in front of the chart said,
16 May 22, '92, allergic rhinitis and asthma, and
17 chronic bronchitis secondary to tobacco use.
18       That record continued to exist in the
19 chart in '92, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97, and '98.
20 How do we know?  It's reviewed down here as
21 part of the chart as late as February 4, 1998.
22       And even when there was an asthma
23 exacerbation, which you heard about in the
24 context of he's having asthma and he's having
25 bronchitis, which all the records that he

1 pointed to that they said asthma also have
2 bronchitis.
3       He carried a diagnosis on this critically
4 important document that you have not seen until
5 now of allergic rhinitis and asthma and in
6 chronic bronchitis secondary to tobacco abuse
7 from '92 all the way through till 1998.
8       It was always there.  It was never
9 removed.  It's always part of the chart.
10       Again, as late as '93, a year later,
11 Dr. Tabb, who saw him four times, was still
12 saying, I'm going to give you Atrovent for
13 COPD.
14       Dr. Catz saw him one time.  One time.
15       Mr. Reilly -- let me show you this.
16       This was the first picture I showed you
17 of my client.  Remember, first picture.  I did
18 it for a reason, because I wanted you to see
19 what made up this man's family.
20       You know, Mr. Reilly is an interesting
21 cat, because he kind of subtly takes shots at
22 my client.  He does it nice.  But he hit him
23 with this alcohol business.  You look through
24 the medical records.
25       MR. REILLY:  Objection, Your Honor, to

1 excuse me of taking shots is inappropriate.
2       THE COURT:  He also called you a nice
3 guy.
4       Overruled.
5       MR. SCHLESINGER:  There are subtle ways
6 to dig into the character of a man to try to
7 prejudice you.  Sympathy and prejudice should
8 not make up your decision.
9       The point is this.  The records are
10 clear.  There's a bunch of records in there.
11 If you find them, you're better people than us,
12 because we obviously didn't find them all.  But
13 they are in the records, a lot of places.
14       He hasn't drunk in a year.  He doesn't
15 drink.  He's not a drinker.  He's not a
16 drinker.
17       He was dancing and going to discos when
18 they had the hustle.  He was having a party and
19 partying.
20       That's what life is all about.  We should
21 be able to go out and have a party, and that
22 doesn't mean we're disqualified for being
23 worthy of the justification of a claim when our
24 lungs have been ripped out from emphysema from
25 chronic smoking and the powerful addiction.

1       The point is, there's no evidence of this
2 man being a drinker.  He's not a drinker in
3 this case.  Most of the records are very
4 clear -- and what did he tell you?
5       I was scared of heroin.  They scared me.
6 I never would have become a drug addict on
7 nicotine if I knew what it was.  That had the
8 ring of truth.  That was a spontaneous moment.
9       Had they, instead of being seductionists,
10 lowering the threat level, promising you that
11 everything is okay, Go ahead, you're a cowboy,
12 it would have been a different set of
13 circumstances.
14       What about this picture right here?  We
15 have the true family.  1989, birth of his
16 daughter.  He is a happy man.  Young guy.
17       Oh, these old hair with the blue and the
18 hair from the '80s.  But who is the important
19 member of the family that we didn't point out
20 in the beginning of this case?  Who was the
21 important member of the family?  Right there.
22 Right next to his lungs.  Right next to his
23 chest.  Where it's going to be.  A pack of
24 Marlboro reds.
25       Now that completes the family, and that's

1 the family this man belonged to.  He was an
2 integral part of the family.  There was a part
3 of him in every step of the way.
4       And it ended up costing him an amount
5 that when you ask yourself, this is the price
6 we pay for pleasure, for satisfaction, for the
7 marketing terms that they like to use.  Those
8 insipid and absurd things about drug addiction
9 to try to say it's pleasure.  Okay?
10       You know who takes pleasure?  Tobacco
11 industry executives take pleasure.  They take
12 pleasure from making money.  They enjoy making
13 money.  They get satisfaction from making
14 money.  But they do it on top of a mountain of
15 graves that they disregard the human element.
16 That's why these cases right here in Bartow are
17 so important.
18       So this is a road to nowhere.  These are
19 the miles, okay, the Marlboro miles that they
20 collect.
21       And where do they go?  Where do these
22 miles take you?  They take you nowhere.
23       Are they frequent flier miles?  Or are
24 they frequent "dier" miles?  What are these
25 for?

1       That Cat Stevens song has been going
2 through my head this whole trial, Miles From
3 Nowhere.
4       Where do these get you?  They get you
5 nowhere.  They end up in the closets of the
6 people that are dead, because by the time
7 there's enough of them saved, the luggage --
8 you can't go anywhere because you've got
9 emphysema.
10       It's a terrible thing, but it keeps
11 people smoking, at all times.  It's a road to
12 nowhere.
13       What do they say?  "Our medical and
14 scientific witnesses will say whatever we want
15 them to say."  Clearly implying that if not
16 stating they lack credibility --
17       MR. REILLY:  Objection, Your Honor.
18       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- credibility and
19 integrity.
20       THE COURT:  Just a second.
21       MR. REILLY:  Putting an affront of this
22 on the defense.
23       MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is in evidence.
24       THE COURT:  Overruled.
25       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thanks, Judge.

1       It's an internal document back during the
2 time of the conspiracy.  When Dr. Proctor
3 explained one of the arms of the conspiracy was
4 the importance of defending the cases:  We
5 intend to play hardball with the victims of
6 cigarette smoking when they press their claims
7 in the courtroom.  This is the industry's
8 ultimate public relations sham.  And our
9 position continues to mislead the public with a
10 wink.
11       Okay?
12       That right there is internal.  They had a
13 heavy motivation to not being exposed to some
14 of the problems from litigation, and this is
15 one of the ways they did it.
16       Our medical witnesses will say whatever
17 we want them to say.
18       Okay?  Doubt is our product.  We talked
19 about that.
20       The industry would have been in a
21 deplorable position.  That's how good this
22 worked.  The key word is confusion.  They are
23 giving addicted smokers, poor, pathetic drug
24 addicts, a psychological crutch to keep
25 smoking.

1       They are telling you, Here is a filter,
2 and it's incapable of removing whatever
3 constituents.  And by the way, deliver a nice
4 jolt of nicotine.
5       What did the smoker of the filtered
6 cigarettes do?  He was born into the filtered
7 smoking generation.  He relied on them and he
8 smoked them.
9       You're getting just as much tar and
10 nicotine as you would from a regular cigarette,
11 but you abandoned the regular cigarette on the
12 grounds of reduced risk to health.  You lose
13 your filtration.
14       The Surgeon General's reports say that
15 these filters and lights were used as a tool by
16 the Tobacco Institute to undermine prevention
17 and cessation efforts.
18       So Dr. Schroeder had said it's extremely
19 important for there to be continuity of care.
20 That was in Taylor.
21       It didn't fit when he came into this
22 courtroom, because nobody -- like Catz, he
23 didn't have continuity of care.  "You have to
24 have multiple visits and continuity of care
25 before one can distinguish between COPD and

1 asthma.  That's extremely important."
2       That worked up the street a couple days
3 ago, but didn't work in this courtroom when
4 you're trying to elevate what Catz had to say
5 and think about it.  Catz, he was a little bit
6 of an outlier.
7       Harman was an outlier.
8       Ultimately, every note that Harman wrote,
9 in subsequent notes Dr. Forman said, He's got
10 COPD from smoking.
11       Dr. Forman was never thrown off course
12 when he was getting letters from Dr. Harman at
13 U of F.  That's why you go for a second
14 opinion.  No big deal.  You go for a second
15 opinion.
16       That's what they did.
17       THE COURT:  Five minutes.
18       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, sir.  Thank you.
19       So, this is Mr. Reilly's board.  Quite
20 frankly, there's a lot of errors in it.
21       Let's talk about Donna Hernandez for a
22 second, disgruntled ex-wife.  For a moment, I
23 thought we were making a little bit of peace.
24 I almost thought they would maybe get together
25 and hug it out, because she admitted there was

1 some old wounds.  She didn't feel great about
2 him.
3       She talked about some things she might
4 have told her ex-husband in his 20s.  And I had
5 that cute picture of them.
6       But the point was, she thought she
7 offered to take him to see the picture of John
8 Wayne, dead on the wall.  He wasn't dead until
9 '79, so that might have been a mistake.
10       She said she thought she mentioned it.
11 But she also said John Wayne was dead.  He
12 wasn't dead in 1979.  And she was talking about
13 the mid-'70s.
14       So that's a little bit of a mistake.
15       Mr. Reilly said:  Oh, she said she wanted
16 to take him down to the lab where she was
17 cutting up some black lungs from lung cancer.
18       But the fact is, when I asked her about
19 that, she said that was years ago.  I couldn't
20 have taken him down to the lab.  I had nothing
21 to do with black lungs.
22       So did she say to him smoking could make
23 you sick -- and you heard she was a crusader.
24 Yeah.  Sure, she did.
25       But what did she also say about Richard?

1 He didn't absorb this.  It didn't register with
2 him.  Of course not.  He's not a drug addict.
3 He's a cowboy.
4       So here's what his note says, and there's
5 a problem.  It isn't 26 times by 12 physicians
6 in the '90s.  These people are in the 2000s.
7       Keeler did not make a diagnosis of
8 asthma.  She made a diagnosis of epinephrine
9 reaction and documented that he told them, "I
10 have emphysema."  Where else could he have
11 gotten that from, but a doctor?
12       So -- and Waller Tabb, who saw him four
13 times, was carrying the chronic bronchitis note
14 all the way along.
15       So when you start subtracting it from the
16 '90s, you end up with a number that is like 12.
17 Every one of those people that said asthma,
18 look how many saw him one time.
19       Randall, one time.  Keeler, one time.
20 Bavinger, one time.  When they said asthma,
21 they also said bronchitis.  What did his expert
22 say?  You had to have multiple visits.
23       And we hooked him with that.  When he was
24 on the witness stand, as soon as I asked him,
25 he tried to dodge it, because he knew it was

1 coming.  They were trying to get ready for it,
2 because they knew he had testified
3 inconsistently up the road just a few minutes
4 earlier.
5       This was very important.  I want to go
6 over this with you for a minute.
7       It's very sad, because doctors don't know
8 this.  Doctors don't know this.  Take a look at
9 this --
10       Oh, by the way, when we get to punitive
11 damages, it only takes the morning to put on a
12 minor amount of information, and you guys would
13 never shirk your duty.
14       If we deserve punitive damages, you guys,
15 I trust, will be here to hear the rest of the
16 evidence, even if it takes another half a day.
17 And you're not going to say, Well, I would have
18 given punies, but I want to get out of here, so
19 I'm not going to give them.
20       So we're not worried about that.
21       But when you give punitive damages, when
22 you punish for wrongful acts, here is what
23 you're going to say.  You are going to speak to
24 them in the only language they understand, the
25 language of dollars.

1       Their business plan is to make money, at
2 the expense of human lives.  And we're going to
3 ask you to speak to them in the only language
4 they understand.
5       And what do they know here?  They are
6 encouraging all the time.  They are sending him
7 catalogs.  He's responding on January 9th,
8 when two days later, he's in the Watkins Clinic
9 with tobacco addiction and tobacco dependence
10 being treated.
11       So he's buying jackets and all this other
12 stuff as an addict, and the doctors are trying
13 to treat him, and these guys are encouraging
14 him all along the way.  Hey, keep on smoking.
15 Here are some jackets.  Here is a lunchbox
16 that's got a cooler in it.  Yeah, this is a
17 great cooler.  You know what you can do with
18 this cooler?  When you have your lung
19 transplant, you can transport your lungs to the
20 operating room in this cooler.
21       I mean, when you look at these things for
22 what they are, when you see things for what
23 they are, it's outrageous.  Okay?
24       So every time within days of the database
25 giving them -- keeping track of what he's up

1 to, he's fighting his addiction.  He is
2 desperately fighting his addiction, and they
3 are encouraging him to keep smoking all the
4 way.  Here is three bucks off on a carton.
5       Here he's quitting, but he's noticing
6 cravings.  They are congratulating him on his
7 tobacco efforts.
8       Three days later, he's getting coupons to
9 take money off cartons.
10       Look at this.  He's got the components of
11 cigarette smoking fixed obstruction.
12       Forman's notes in order are brilliant.
13 He's recognizing, look, I think this smoking
14 has something to do with it.  And then each
15 subsequent note, he shows how much more he
16 learns about it.
17       You read those notes.  You will see how
18 well Forman understood this case.
19       Then in his planner, he quits smoking.
20       Then he calls Philip Morris.  Do not
21 contact me.  Do not mail.  Leave me alone.  I'm
22 trying to quit.
23       Does that happen?  No, it doesn't happen.
24       You know why?  Because Philip Morris
25 knows this condition is merely conversion

1 reversible.
2       What does that mean?  Conversion, I've
3 quit.  Reversible, we'll get him back.  We'll
4 get him back.  He'll relapse.
5       THE COURT:  Time's up.
6       MR. SCHLESINGER:  May I finish this one
7 piece, Judge?  One minute?
8       In any event, it says right here, the
9 Bond Clinic, he's got the tobacco abuse for 30
10 years with resulting emphysema, and it talks
11 about his attempts to quit.  And it keeps on
12 going.
13       He's telling them he doesn't want to see
14 that anymore.  They are calling him conversion
15 reversible.  He still has tobacco addiction.
16 He's still part of their program.
17       In any event, Dow Chemical, they blocked
18 Nicorette gum.  They didn't want people to
19 learn to quit.  This was the first product
20 coming out on the market, and they boycotted
21 Dow Chemical so they wouldn't put nicotine gum
22 out there.
23       And Mannino and the Surgeon General's
24 report all say chronic bronchitis and the other
25 are all parts of emphysema.

1       And this is also on the Fraser Trail:
2 "We will be known by the tracks we leave," a
3 Seminole quote.  I ran by that the past few
4 weeks.
5       That's an opportunity you have, and I
6 will tell you I wish you really good luck in
7 coming to a just result in this case.  And
8 there's only -- there's one thing I just want
9 to read them, if the judge will just let me.
10 One thing I saved here.
11       I put it in the front, I bet.  Yes, I
12 did.
13       This is one thing I want to read you.  I
14 read this in every single case.  This is about
15 the book 1984.
16       The movie was Richard Hurt -- John Hurt
17 and Richard Burton, and 1984, George Orwell.
18 He was about to torture him.  He's got him on
19 the table.  Leaning over and whispering.
20       And he says to him, "And above all, we do
21 not allow the dead to rise up against us.  You
22 must stop imagining that posterity will
23 vindicate you, Winston.
24       "Posterity will never hear of you.  You
25 will be lifted clean out from the stream of

1 history.  We shall turn you into a gas and pour
2 you into the stratosphere.  Nothing will remain
3 of you.  Not a name in a register.  Not a
4 memory in a living brain.  You will have been
5 annihilated in the past, as well as in the
6 future.  You will never have existed."
7       My client exists.  Your verdict will be
8 known by the tracks we leave.  It will make an
9 important statement.  It will have an effect of
10 deterrence.
11       I thank you so, so much for taking the
12 time and being such a cohesive and good group.
13 And I look forward to turning this case over to
14 you now.  It's all in your hands.  Thank you.
