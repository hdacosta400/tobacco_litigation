19             MR. GEISE:  Thank you, Your Honor.
20             Counsel, Mrs. Bounomo, ladies and
21   gentleman of the jury.
22             We are at the end of the case.  It started
23   a couple weeks ago.  You've heard from the
24   witnesses.  The evidence is in.  All that is left
25   now is for you to do your job as the judges of the

 1   facts.
 2             It has been my great pleasure to get a
 3   chance to try this case in front of the seven of
 4   you. Years from now I'll look back on this
 5   experience and I'm remember your faces.  We don't
 6   get to talk a lot, but I'll remember your faces.
 7   I'll remember how you reacted to certain evidence or
 8   something funny that happened in the courtroom, and
 9   it will be a fond memory for me.  I got to tell you,
10   you were on time every day.  We never waited for one
11   of you.  You were here.  You took your jobs
12   seriously.  As an attorney, that is all we can ask
13   for, and I want to thank you for that.  If it wasn't
14   for you, our system wouldn't work.  But it does
15   work.
16             Unfortunately for you, there is a little
17   bit of work you have to do.  You have to deliberate.
18   But you have paid attention.  You have taken notes.
19   You have asked incredible questions.  I have asked a
20   lot of questions.  That shows that you are paying
21   attention, that you're listening to the evidence,
22   that you are taking this seriously, and we
23   appreciate that.  For all you have done, I want to
24   say thank you.
25             As the judge told you repeatedly and said

 1   it a couple times while Dr. Cummings was on the
 2   stand, this case is about two issues and two issues
 3   only.  I put this up in my opening statement, but I
 4   want to go back to them again.  These are really the
 5   two factual issues that matter in this case.  Was
 6   Mr. Bounomo addicted to cigarettes containing
 7   nicotine and, if so, did that addiction cause COPD  8   before November 21st, 1996.  Those are the two
 9   factual questions that you need to focus on to
10   answer the verdict form.
11             We talked throughout that the plaintiff
12   has the burden of proof on those two questions.  The
13   court will instruct you about what that burden
14   means.  Counsel already talked about the greater
15   weight of the evidence.  It is the plaintiff, not
16   the defense, but the plaintiff who has to prove that
17   Mr. Bounomo was addicted to cigarettes, and that he
18   smoked because of an addiction, not because he
19   wanted to, not because of choice.  It is the
20   plaintiff that has to prove that Mr. Bounomo had
21   COPD before November of 1996.  And the plaintiff has
22   to prove both of those things by the greater weight
23   of the evidence.
24             Plaintiff's counsel used these scales.  He
25   said we start out like this, and it just has to get

 1   just like that for them to meet the burden of proof.
 2   That is not exactly true because the fact of the
 3   matter is we don't have a burden of proof on
 4   anything.  So I don't have to put one weight, one
 5   piece of evidence, anything on the scale.  Even if I
 6   don't do that, the plaintiff still has to prove this
 7   case by the greater weight of the evidence.  It is
 8   not a question of what they put in versus what I put
 9   in.  They have the full burden.  And the greater
10   weight doesn't equal just a little bit.  The greater
11   weight isn't met through speculation.  It is not met
12   through bare conclusions.  It is not met through
13   hypotheticals.  It is only met through proof.  It is
14   the burden of proof.
15             He encouraged you at the beginning of the
16   trial to demand proof.  As you listened to the
17   testimony, I think you'll see that the plaintiff did
18   not satisfy that demand for proof.
19             The evidence in this case proves that Mr.
20   Buonomo was a stubborn man who did what he wanted to
21   do, especially when it came to smoking, but when it
22   came to other things as well, and I'll touch on
23   that.
24             The proof in this case is that he quit in
25   1995 and he never smoked again.  The proof is that

 1   it was his choice and his want that caused him to
 2   start smoking, that caused him to continue smoking,
 3   that caused him to stop smoking, and caused him to
 4   never smoke again.
 5             Secondly, the plaintiffs simply cannot
 6   prove that Mr. Bounomo had COPD before 1996.  The
 7   medical evidence I'll go through demonstrates he had
 8   congestive heart failure, and that congestive heart
 9   failure, not COPD, caused his death 13 years later 10   at the age of 80 years old.
11             I want to talk first about addiction. In
12   determining whether Mr. Bounomo was addicted to
13   cigarettes, you have to consider what it means to be
14   addicted.  The instructions will not contain a
15   definition for you.  You'll need to decide that.
16             Does it mean if you are addicted you have
17   to smoke no matter what and you can't stop no matter
18   how hard you want to?  Is that addiction?  Or does
19   it mean you can stop smoking but only with
20   incredible willpower?  Or does it mean that smoking
21   controls you and you don't control smoking?
22             Common sense tell us that addiction
23   prevents from doing something you would otherwise
24   do.  For a smoker it means addiction prevents you
25   from quitting if you want to, or it compels you to

 1   smoke when you don't want to.
 2             Last, the evidence demonstrated Mr.
 3   Bounomo was a man who made his own choices.  When it
 4   came to smoking, he made a lot of them.  Let's look
 5   at some of these.  I showed you this in opening.  I
 6   think all the evidence that came in supported this.
 7   He chose to start smoking.  He chose to continue
 8   smoking.  He chose what brands he wanted to smoke.
 9   He chose to switch brands.  He chose to stick with
10   his favorite brands.  He chose not to quit, and
11   eventually he chose to quit.
12             Maybe there is one other thing I could put
13   on there we heard from Dr. Marks.  He chose every
14   day to quit and to not start again.  That was 13
15   years of decisions.  These choices Mr. Bounomo made
16   based upon what he wanted to do.  He controlled
17   these choices.  Smoking didn't control him.
18             Let's look quickly at his smoking
19   behavior.  We heard he started smoking in the early
20   1940s.  No one knows exactly when he started.  No
21   one knows exactly why he started.  No one knows what
22   brand Mr. Bounomo smoked for that first ten years he
23   smoked before he got back from Korea.
24             That is an interesting point.  Nobody
25   knows if the brands he smoked were made by my

 1   client, somebody else's client, or just penny
 2   cigarettes.
 3             MR. UUSTAL:  Objection, Your Honor.
 4             THE COURT:  Sit down.  Overruled.
 5             MR. UUSTAL:  I had an agreement about
 6   this.
 7             THE COURT:  Step in the juryroom.
 8             (Jury absent)
 9             (Record read back as recorded above)
10             THE COURT:  There was evidence about that.
11             MR. UUSTAL:  But, Your Honor, I agreed to 12   take out the jury instruction about R.J. Reynolds'
13   relation to the other parties.
14             THE COURT:  The objection as to this phase
15   is irrelevant.  The issue is not whether he was
16   addicted to Reynolds' cigarettes.  That has been
17   established in every trial.  The issue of whether he
18   was addicted at all which is your company's fault
19   because of your cigarettes is a phase-two question.
20   So I'm going to instruct the jury about that, and
21   then you can continue.
22             Bring the jury in.
23             (Jury present)
24             THE COURT:  Just so it is clear, as we
25   proceed in this phase of the trial, it is irrelevant

 1   which cigarettes Mr. Bounomo was smoking as far as
 2   the question of whether he was addicted or not and
 3   whether or not it caused him to suffer a disease.
 4   It would be relevant in phase two if we reach phase
 5   two, but it is not relevant on the issues you are
 6   being asked to decide in this phase.
 7             You may proceed.
 8             MR. GEISE:  Thank you, Your Honor.
 9             We also heard from Mrs. Bounomo how Mr.
10   Bounomo selected his cigarettes.  She testified when
11   he came from Korea in 1952 he was smoking Camels,
12   Lucky Strike, and Chesterfield.  But she didn't like
13   the smell of Lucky Strike and Chesterfield, so she
14   asked him to smoke Camel, and he did.  That is how
15   he settled on that brand, Camel.  It wasn't based on
16   addiction or advertising.  It was because his wife
17   didn't like the smell of the other cigarettes and
18   encouraged him to smoke Camels.  He smoked Camels
19   from the 1950s to the 1970s.  We heard he would try
20   other brands, but he would return to Camels because
21   he liked their taste.  Later his wife told us that
22   he switched to Salem because he liked the menthol
23   flavor of Salem.  Again, he chose his brand based on
24   taste, not advertising, not addiction, but taste.
25   It was his choice, a choice based on taste.

 1             There is also no dispute in the case that
 2   Mr. Bounomo stopped smoking.  There is no question
 3   whether he could or could not quit smoking.  He did.
 4   He answered that question for you.  It is a fact
 5   that Mr. Bounomo not only could quit smoking but he
 6   did quit smoking just like the 60 million other
 7   smokers who have quit, and the 90 percent of those
 8   smokers who have quit without using any aids or
 9   cessation methods.
10             We heard testimony that Mr. Buonomo tried
11   to quit many times.  I think if we look at the
12   evidence behind those quit attempts, we can see how
13   serious those attempts were.  Mrs. Bounomo told you 14   that he would have a pack of cigarettes in the
15   morning, say he was going to stop, he would throw
16   the pack away, but he wouldn't throw the carton
17   away.  He kept a carton in the closet so when he
18   wanted a cigarette he would go to the closet and get
19   one.  When he did this, she testified he wasn't even
20   sure if her husband intended to give up cigarettes
21   permanently.
22             If you want to stop, you have to intend to
23   give up permanently.  Other times Mrs. Bounomo said
24   after he said he was going to stop, a little while
25   later he would say well, maybe I'm going to cut

 1   back.
 2             Again, these are not the actions of
 3   someone who is really serious about quitting, not
 4   someone who is motivated to quit.
 5             We heard about word search and hard candy
 6   and sweets and things Mr. Bounomo might have done to
 7   keep his mind off smoking at the time he was trying
 8   to quit.  But we also heard that he did word
 9   searches and ate candy and loved sweets while he was
10   smoking.  You heard he was a big sweets guy.  He
11   didn't use these things to replace smoking.  It is
12   not like he stopped and picked up sweats or did word
13   searches to replace smoking to give him something to
14   do.  These are things he always enjoyed doing.
15             You also heard that anybody could quit
16   smoking, even smokers who were addicted.  Dr.
17   Henningfield, Dr. Cummings, everybody agrees
18   addiction does not mean you can't quit.  Sure, it
19   might be harder for some people to quit than others.
20   Everyone is different.  Some people might never
21   quit.  But other people like Mr. Bounomo will quit.
22   You heard from Dr. Marks that smoking doesn't take
23   away your free will.  Smoking doesn't make you lose
24   the ability to think rationally. Smoking doesn't
25   prevent you from being able to make decisions.

 1   Smoking does not rob you of your ability to chose
 2   not to smoke if that is your choice.
 3             Dr. Cummings told you that motivation is
 4   the key.  He said it a number of times.  You got to
 5   want to quit.  Dr. Cummings testified trying
 6   different methods to quit is an indication of
 7   motivation.
 8             Let's look at some of the methods Mr.
 9   Bounomo didn't use to quit.  Never used nicotine
10   gum.  Never used a nicotine patch.  Never sought
11   medical help.  Never visited a smoking cessation
12   clinic.  Never tried hypnosis.  Never threw out his
13   cigarette carton, his matches, or his ashtrays.  Not
14   doing those things is a sign there wasn't the
15   motivation to quit.  You got to want to quit.  Why 16   didn't he do those things?  Because he didn't want
17   to go without smoking.  We heard that Mr. Bounomo
18   would stop smoking briefly but then he would start
19   again. Mrs. Bounomo told you when he would start
20   again, she never asked him why he started smoking
21   again and he never told her.
22             Let's assume that Dr. Berndt and Dr.
23   Bolton, the two treating physicians that first saw
24   Mr. Bounomo in May of 1995 and said he quit a year
25   earlier -- We all remember those documents, and we

 1   remember the testimony from Dr. Bolton.  Let's
 2   assume they are wrong, that he never told them he
 3   stopped in 1994, and let's assume Mr. Bounomo did
 4   stop in 1995.
 5             The plaintiff will tell you the only
 6   reason Mr. Bounomo stopped in 1995 is because he was
 7   hospitalized and because he was on oxygen.  You
 8   heard Mr. Bounomo had not been hospitalized or been
 9   to a doctor in 40 years.  So for the first time in
10   over four decades he is in a hospital.  He is
11   uncomfortable.  Doesn't feel well.  He is in
12   respiratory failure.  He is irritable.  Who wouldn't
13   be?  He is hooked up to tubes.  He has doctors
14   coming in.  He is taken out of his normal life.  Of
15   course you are going to be uncomfortable.  While he
16   was in the hospital he couldn't smoke.  He asked for
17   three things.  He asked for a cigarette, he asked
18   for a sandwich, and he asked for a newspaper.  Did
19   he ask for these three things because was addicted
20   to all these of those, or did he ask for those three
21   things because those were the things that would make
22   him comfortable, to take him back to what comforts
23   him.
24             The interesting thing is after Mr. Bounomo
25   got out of the hospital he went back to eating

 1   sandwiches.  He kept reading the newspaper.  But he
 2   never went back to smoking.  So does that mean he
 3   was addicted to sandwiches and the newspaper or the
 4   things he wanted to do?
 5             It is odd.  Dr. Cummings told you that
 6   addiction is a loss of control.  But when Mr.
 7   Bounomo lost control for the first time in 40 years,
 8   that is when he quit.  Dr. Marks told you when he
 9   was in the hospital, this was the first time this
10   gentleman lost control, that he couldn't do what he
11   wanted to do, and it was that first time he lost
12   control that he stopped smoking not just until he
13   got out of the hospital but for the rest of his
14   life, for the next 13 years.
15             Mrs. Bounomo told us that Mr. Bounomo was
16   first angry and irritable in the hospital, but after
17   a few days he was calmer and okay.  That is while he 18   was quitting once and for all.
19             So we talked about the symptoms of
20   nicotine withdrawal, and we talked about
21   irritability, and we talked about how it changes
22   your personality if this is a sign of addiction.
23             Mr. Bounomo's daughter testified.  Look
24   what she told us about his change in personality
25   when he quit.  She was asked:

 1             "Question:  I think you told us you didn't
 2   notice any change in his personality after he
 3   stopped smoking in 1995.  Is that fair to say?
 4             "Answer:  Yes.
 5             No change in his personality when he quit
 6   after smoking.  Even though we did not hear from Mr.
 7   Bounomo in this case, we learned a lot about him.
 8   We learned this was a man who did what he wanted to
 9   do.  Just think of the persistence of a person who
10   decides they are not going to drive a vehicle.  This
11   is hard for us to fathom.  He knew how to drive.  He
12   just made a decision not to.
13             Dr. Marks told you this is an indication
14   of somebody's personality, that they can make their
15   decision and go forward with it even if it causes
16   some inconvenience.  Mr. Bounomo had the similar
17   choices with smoking.
18             In the 1950s after he and Mrs. Bounomo
19   were married, she asked please don't light up the
20   cigarettes in the bedroom.  His response was he did
21   it anyway.  In the 1970s she kept nagging him about
22   his smoking.  They saw the warnings on the package
23   telling him it was dangerous, and he kept smoking.
24   In the 1980s she continued to get on his case, but
25   he didn't respond by not smoking.

 1             You remember what Ms. Bounomo said about
 2   her husband's personality?  He was a very stubborn
 3   person who had his own mind and did what he wanted
 4   to do.  While it was just a phrase, she said he was
 5   so stubborn you couldn't change his mind if he had a
 6   gun in his back.  That was his personality.  His
 7   daughter Marilyn told you the same thing.  She
 8   testified he was a very decisive man, and that he
 9   believed in his opinion, and it was very, very hard
10   to sway him.
11             The decisions to smoke was like other
12   decisions in his life.  He made up his mind what he
13   was going to do, and no one could convince him
14   otherwise.  He didn't want to stop smoking so he
15   didn't.
16             I want to talk a little bit about the
17   people who talked about whether Mr. Bounomo was
18   addicted or not, the plaintiff's experts, their
19   treating physicians who they made their experts in 20   this case that you saw on video.  They testified
21   that Mr. Buonomo was addicted.  But when he saw each
22   one of them, they already stopped smoking.  They
23   admitted they weren't experts on addiction.  All the
24   doctors testified to that testifying by video.  They
25   knew nothing about his attempts to quit.  They

 1   didn't know when or how he quit.  Based on that
 2   simple fact he smoked, they said he was addicted.
 3   That is not enough.  That is not enough proof.
 4             You also heard from Dr. Cummings.  I want
 5   to spend a minute or two talking about Dr. Cummings.
 6   Plaintiff's counsel talked about being a stranger to
 7   the courtroom in the first part of his closing
 8   argument.
 9             Dr. Cummings is no stranger to a
10   courtroom.  Frankly, he spends more time in court
11   than I do.  Dr. Cummings is a general in the war on
12   tobacco.  You heard him say this.  In this case, I
13   think his battlefield maps were a little off, and he
14   is at the wrong spot for this case.
15             We talked in opening statement and voir
16   dire about the right juror for the right case.  I'm
17   not sure what Dr. Cummings came here to talk about
18   was pertinent to the two issues you need to decide.
19   He talks about a Quit Line in New York that receives
20   thousands of calls a year from smokers who want to
21   quit.
22             Mr. Bounomo never called the Quit Line in
23   New York or anywhere else.  Dr. Cummings talks about
24   what he does in his smoking cessation clinics.  Mr.
25   Bounomo didn't go to smoking cessation clinics.  Dr.

 1   Cummings combed his archives to select the most
 2   inflammatory statements he could find to play for
 3   you, but there isn't a bit of evidence in this case
 4   that Mr. Bounomo saw any of those clips he played or
 5   saw the articles from some of the newspapers from
 6   the Boston Globe.
 7             Dr. Cummings talked about Sergeant Bilco,
 8   the Beverly Hillbillies, and The Flintstones.  There
 9   was no testimony in this case that Mr. Bounomo saw
10   those shows.  Dr. Cummings showed you lots of
11   advertising as well.  But Mrs. Bounomo told you she
12   doesn't know that Mr. Bounomo ever picked a brand of
13   cigarette based on advertisement.
14             Dr. Cummings talked about studying people
15   in 20 countries to determine their smoking habits,
16   but he never talked to you about Mr. Bounomo's
17   smoking habits.  He talked about different tools he
18   uses to determine if a hypothetical person is
19   addicted, but he didn't tell you that Mr. Bounomo
20   was addicted.  In fact, if you go back to the
21   transcript, he didn't utter Mr. Bounomo's name once. 22             In all the sound bites and the film clips
23   and all the things Dr. Cummings did put up about
24   smoking and addiction, there was one person at left
25   out of his montage, and that was Mr. Buonomo.

 1             You heard in 1975 when Mr. Bounomo caught
 2   his daughter smoking he reprimanded her that night
 3   and told her don't do this, you will never be able
 4   to quit.  He told her that in 1975.  He knew smoking
 5   would be difficult to quit.  He told her that.  This
 6   is 13 years before surgeon general Koop calls it an
 7   addiction. I think Dr. Cummings was waging a
 8   different war from a different place, and a general
 9   didn't belong in this case.
10             Dr. Henningfield was the same way.  Let's
11   look at a clip from Dr. Henningfield.
12             "Question:  Doctor, let's talk but your
13   knowledge of the smoker or smokers in this case.
14   You don't know the name or names of any of the
15   smokers involved in this case do you?
16             "Answer:  That's correct.
17             "Question:  You don't know the smoking
18   behavior of the smoker or smokers in this case, do
19   you?
20             "Answer:  No, I don't.
21             "Question:  For example, whether a smoker
22   quit or not is unknown to you?
23             "Answer:  That's correct.
24             Dr. Cummings and Dr. Henningfield know a
25   load about addiction in general, but they didn't say

 1   anything about addiction specific to Mr. Buonomo.
 2   Ask yourself how they help you answer the question
 3   in this case about Mr. Buonomo because you need
 4   proof about Mr. Buonomo's addiction, not somebody
 5   else.
 6             The only qualified professional you heard
 7   from that diagnoses people with addictions and
 8   dependancies who offered an opinion about Mr.
 9   Buonomo was Dr. Marks.  And his opinion about Mr.
10   Buonomo was that he was not clinically addicted or
11   dependent.  He always had the ability to quit and he
12   made the decision not to smoke in 1995 and every day
13   for the next 13 years.
14             Now, I mentioned in opening statement that
15   the words addiction and nicotine dependence are just
16   labels.  Dr. Cummings talked about the labels and
17   how they changed over time.  He said in 1964 the
18   surgeon general and the World Health Organization
19   called smoking a habit.  They didn't call it an
20   addiction.  Then in 1977 and 1982 the surgeon
21   general called it a personal choice behavior.  Then
22   in 1988 the surgeon general called it an addiction.
23   Now other organizations call it a dependence. 24             I'm not sure what counsel is going to say
25   when he gets up to rebut, but I'm sure you'll see

 1   some of the film clips Dr. Cummings played for you.
 2   I'm certain of that.  They will probably say that my
 3   client and other tobacco companies said those things
 4   to give a crutch to Mr. Buonomo and other smokers
 5   like them.  If Reynolds was giving him a crutch,
 6   what was the surgeon general doing in 1964?  What
 7   was the World Health Organization doing?
 8             I don't want to get hung up on labels.
 9   But if you follow the bouncing label in this case,
10   let's assume someone has -- Their smoking behavior
11   is what it is and it doesn't change.  In 1964 that
12   person is going to be habituated, in 1977 they are
13   going to have a behavior, in 1988 they are going to
14   have an addiction, and maybe now they have a
15   dependancy.  Their smoking behavior would have
16   stayed the same all along.  That is why I don't want
17   to get hung up on terms like addiction and
18   dependence.  Those words are labels.  At the end of
19   the day, the only thing that matters is Mr.
20   Buonomo's smoking behavior, not what we call it.
21   And Dr. Cummings agreed on this.  He said the
22   fundamental question is whether people can quit
23   smoking.  Mr. Buonomo answered that fundamental
24   question.  He quit smoking.  So when we talk about
25   standard, Fagerstrom, the Heaviness of Smoking

 1   Index, the DSM, the best standard to use in this
 2   case to determine if Mr. Buonomo could quit smoking
 3   is whether he did, and we know how he answered that
 4   standard.
 5             A final thought about the label addiction.
 6   Mrs. Buonomo smoked for 19 years and then quit.  But
 7   she doesn't think she was addicted and neither does
 8   her family.  The family didn't put that label on
 9   her.
10             Interestingly, Mr. Buonomo never put the
11   label of addiction on himself.  His daughter
12   testified the following:  I don't recall him ever
13   saying the word addicted to me personally.  Mrs.
14   Buonomo testified in her response to one of your
15   questions that he never called himself addicted.
16             You heard that this lawsuit was filed
17   before he passed away.  Mr. Buonomo never called
18   himself addicted after he stopped or before he
19   stopped, or before he filed the lawsuit or after he
20   filed the lawsuit.  Sure he thought it would be hard
21   to quit, but he was able to quit.  Maybe that is not
22   addiction.  If Mr. Buonomo didn't say he himself was
23   addicted, should we?
24             I want to switch gears completely now and
25   talk about the medical issues.  Before I get to the 1862
 1   medical evidence you saw and the testimony you
 2   heard, I want to point out something you probably
 3   noticed.
 4             During this trial you did not see a single
 5   medical record until we started our part of the
 6   case.  Plaintiffs didn't put a single medical record
 7   up on the overhead with their witnesses to talk
 8   about Mr. Bounomo's medical condition.  They didn't
 9   show you a single X-ray or a single CT scan.  They
10   didn't show you any echocardiograms.  Instead, they
11   showed you canned videos from their four experts.
12   That is what they showed you.  They gave you their
13   bear bones conclusions without walking you through
14   all the reasons for their opinions.  I hope you ask
15   yourselves why that happened.
16             Plaintiff counsel has attacked the experts
17   I called in, attacked a gentleman who is board
18   certified in cardiology and testified today, a man
19   who does it for a living.  He is a cardiologist.  He
20   teaches other doctors how to be cardiologists.  He
21   works hard.  That is what he does.
22             They attacked a man who is a diagnostic
23   radiologist.  He is board certified.  It is all he
24   does is look at radiology.  Sure he doesn't have
25   opinions on these other areas because that is was he

 1   does.  That is his expertise.
 2             And they attacked the pulmonologist and
 3   what he does is pulmonology.  He came in here and
 4   talked to you about pulmonology.  They attacked Dr.
 5   Marks for doing the same thing, for doing what he
 6   does.  They also seem to indicate there was
 7   something wrong for these people getting paid for
 8   the time they put in in this case, the time they put
 9   in to prepare, to come here, to sit here and answer
10   my questions, answer their questions, and answer
11   your questions.  They wanted to prepare themselves
12   for that, and they did.
13             Some of the time they spent, they asked,
14   did you meet with lawyers, did you meet with Mr.
15   Geise, did you talk this over?  Yes, they did meet
16   with me.  Do you know why?  Because I'm not a
17   cardiologist or pulmonologist, and I'm not a
18   radiologist.  So if I don't meet with the experts
19   who can tell me about those areas, I can't present a
20   case to you knowing what is going on.
21             Now, the interesting thing is I needed to
22   be taught about radiology and cardiology and
23   pulmonology because just like Dr. Issa and Dr.
24   Silver and Dr.  Feinstein, I'm not a radiologist,
25   I'm not a cardiologist, I'm not a pulmonologist.

 1   That is why I needed to be taught.  2             In order to win this case, the plaintiff
 3   must prove that Mr. Buonomo had COPD caused by
 4   smoking and they must prove that he had that disease
 5   before November 21, 1996.  If the proof doesn't
 6   support that claim, they can't meet their burden and
 7   they lose.
 8             I talked in opening about different kinds
 9   of evidence that proves Mr. Buonomo did not have
10   COPD.  After hearing the evidence, let's see how
11   these line up.  First one, no pulmonary function
12   test.  I was going to show you the clips from every
13   doctor who testified there was no PFT ever
14   performed, but frankly I think we all got that
15   point.  A PFT was never performed by any of Mr.
16   Buonomo's doctors, not Dr. Berndt, not Dr. Bolton,
17   not Dr. Issa, not Dr. Silver, not Dr. Feinstein, not
18   a doctor he saw at any point between 1995 and 2008.
19   No one.  No one.  That is the proof on the PFT.
20             When I think of all the doctors that could
21   have performed a PFT at some point over the 13
22   years, I'm reminded of a story one of my coaches
23   told me in high school.  I heard it again recently
24   and I thought it applied.
25             It is a story about four people,

 1   everybody, somebody, anybody, and nobody.  There was
 2   an important job that needed to be done.  Everybody
 3   was asked to do it.  Everybody was sure somebody
 4   would do it.  Anybody could have done it, but nobody
 5   did it.  So when the job didn't get done, somebody
 6   got angry because it was everybody's job.  Everybody
 7   though anybody could do it, but nobody realized
 8   everybody wouldn't to it, so the job never got done.
 9             That is what happened here with the
10   pulmonary function test.  Dr. Bolton, Dr. Silver,
11   Dr. Issa, Dr. Feinstein, everybody, somebody,
12   anybody, nobody, over the course of the 13 years the
13   PFT never got done.  The absence of a PFT alone is
14   the absence of proof that would be needed to prove
15   the PFT is necessary.  You don't need to do it.
16             But look at the standards.  You heard the
17   testimony by Dr. Klotz about the standards set out
18   by the American Thoracic Society and the GOLD, the
19   GOLD standard, national and international
20   organizations of doctors, pulmonologists who put the
21   standard for how you diagnose COPD.  Just like
22   needing that blood sugar test to show if somebody is
23   a diabetic, you have to conduct a pulmonary function
24   test to see if someone has COPD.
25             Let's look at some of the testimony from

 1   the plaintiff's experts on these points.  Dr. Issa
 2   agreed the American Thoracic Society said a PFT is
 3   necessary.  He is asked to look through it.  He has  4   pointed out that it said pulmonary function
 5   measurements are necessary for diagnosis and
 6   assessment of the severity of this disease.  Dr.
 7   Issa says if it is written in this journal, I guess
 8   I agree.
 9             Dr. Bolton talked about the Global
10   Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease
11   Standard.  He was asked the following?  Spirometry
12   should be undertaken in all patients who may have
13   COPD.  It is needed to make a confident diagnosis of
14   COPD.  If you want to have a confident diagnosis
15   that gives you the greater weight of the evidence,
16   you need to do a PFT.
17             It is not just the ATS, it is not just the
18   GOLD standard, or Dr. Klotz who says you need to do
19   a PFT.  The plaintiff's own experts, when they are
20   not testifying in this case, think the same thing.
21             Let's look first as Dr. Issa.  You might
22   recall Dr. Issa.  I think -- Counsel, if I may.  Dr.
23   Issa referred to Cecil's as the Bible of internal
24   medicine.  You might remember that from his
25   videotape.  He called it the Bible.  What Dr. Issa

 1   said is in his Bible it says spirometry, the measure
 2   of FEV1 and FVC is the GOLD standard for diagnosing
 3   COPD.  You heard Dr. Klotz talked about FEV1 and
 4   FVC.  The Bible, according to Dr. Issa, says you
 5   have to do spirometry.  Dr. Issa didn't do a
 6   pulmonary function test or spirometry.  Dr. Issa
 7   isn't alone.
 8             Dr. Bolton is the one pulmonologist that
 9   the plaintiffs called.  One.  He was very confident
10   he did not need to do a PFT to diagnose COPD.  He is
11   talking about the GOLD classification.  Here he is
12   asked about it.  Said the GOLD classification relies
13   on pulmonary spirometry, and in my opinio I do not
14   need for the most part a pulmonary spirometry to
15   make a diagnosis of COPD.  He doesn't need it.  It
16   is a standard recognized by national and
17   international pulmonologists, but he doesn't need to
18   do a PFT.
19             But let's at some of the other things Dr.
20   Bolton does.  He is flipping thru it in the video.
21   He has a brochure he has in his waiting rooms, and
22   he hands out to all his patients that come in.  It
23   is entitled A Brief Guide to COPD Including Chronic
24   Bronchitis and Emphysema.  And the guide has a
25   section in it that says how does COPD get diagnosed.

 1   And the pamphlet that Dr. Bolton gives his patients
 2   says the following?
 3             On page ten of the brochure, under how is
 4   COPD diagnosed, it says the healthcare provider
 5   diagnoses COPD by combining an evaluation of your  6   symptoms with a breathing test that measures how
 7   much air you can exhale and how fast you can exhale.
 8   That is pulmonary function.
 9             The pamphlet that Dr. Bolton gives his
10   patients says you need to do a pulmonary function
11   test.  But it gets even better.  Dr. Bolton wrote an
12   article and he was asked about the article.  In his
13   article he writes screening pulmonary function
14   studies are needed to determine the type,
15   obstructive or restrictive, and degree, and response
16   to bronchodilator studies.  More sophisticated
17   pulmonary function studies will be indicated.
18             You heard you do a pulmonary function test
19   to determine the amount of obstruction.  You heard
20   it tells you the degree and response to broncho
21   dilator studies, after you take the broncho dilator,
22   you test again to see if there is an any impact.
23   That is how you make this diagnosis.  That is what
24   Dr. Bolton wrote.  Now, here I don't need to do a
25   PFT.

 1             Beyond the initial diagnosis of COPD, Dr.
 2   Bolton also wrote this:  Following up pulmonary
 3   function studies at six-month intervals are
 4   indicated to determine the progress of disease.
 5             There are two reasons to do a PFT.  One,
 6   to make a diagnosis.  Two, to see what the person's
 7   lung function is as they progress.  That is what Dr.
 8   Bolton is writing about, six-month intervals.  Let's
 9   see.  Then 13 years after Mr. Buonomo is diagnosed,
10   if you took a PFT every six months, that would have
11   been 26 times you would have done a pulmonary
12   function test according to Dr. Bolton.  How many
13   times did Mr. Buonomo's doctors do one?  Zero.
14             So when Dr. Bolton is not acting as an
15   expert, he writes that a PFT is needed and he gives
16   his patients literature that tells them the
17   diagnosis of COPD must include a breathing test.
18   But he testified to you here that wasn't the case.
19   Dr. Issa didn't do a PFT and said it wasn't
20   necessary, but what he calls his Bible says you need
21   to do it.
22             Counsel put up a list of all the doctors
23   who treated and diagnosed COPD.  I crossed off the
24   top here because the same list applies to doctors
25   who didn't do a PFT.  Same list.  Same doctors.  All

 1   of them had the chance to do a pulmonary function
 2   test.  Nobody did one.  Not before any one of them
 3   diagnosed with COPD, not when they were treating him
 4   for COPD, not when he was originally diagnosed, not
 5   in the 13 years after that.  Without a PFT, there is
 6   no proof necessary to demonstrate the diagnosis of
 7   COPD, and that failure alone is enough to decide the  8   entire medical question.  That alone is the failure
 9   of proof that tips the scales in my client's favor.
10             But there is more.  There is more medical
11   evidence you saw.
12             Mr. Buonomo's medical condition is at odds
13   with COPD.  Remember the C stands for chronic?
14   There is nothing chronic about Mr. Buonomo's medical
15   condition when he seeks treatments in May of 1995.
16   I know you are tired of seeing the record from Dr.
17   Berndt when he went in so I'm not going to put it up
18   again.  You probably have it memorized.  No
19   bothersome cough.  No hemoptysis.  He denied
20   shortness of breath except on much exertion.  This
21   is a 67-year-old man in 1995.  No shortness of
22   breath except on much exertion.  No chronic problems
23   whatsoever.
24             The testimony you heard from his family
25   further proves that he didn't have chronic health

 1   problems before 1995.  Mrs. Buonomo testified he
 2   hadn't seen a doctor for 40 years.  She testified in
 3   the decade prior to the diagnosis, the 1980s, he was
 4   healthy.  He didn't have a cough.  He retired in '92
 5   and '93 because he wanted to.  He worked hard his
 6   whole life and he wanted to retire.
 7             A couple years later in the spring of '95
 8   they called him and say hey, you want to come back
 9   to work part-time, and he did it.  I asked her was
10   there any medical reason or any concern about his
11   going not back to work.  There was none.  He didn't
12   have any of these chronic symptoms at that point.
13             Ms. Diaz, Mr. Buonomo's granddaughter,
14   testified prior to 1995 she didn't see him become
15   short of breath and never heard him coughing.  She
16   called him being in good health, no trouble
17   breathing, no cough, no shortness of breath.
18             One of you asked Mrs. Buonomo daughter,
19   Paula Levis, what took her father so long to see a
20   doctor.  Why did it take 40 years?  She told you he
21   only went to the doctor if he was sick.  That makes
22   sense.  He wasn't sick in the 60 years leading up to
23   May of 1995.  He had no chronic symptoms.  He had no
24   chronic sickness.
25             Because COPD is a chronic disease, if Mr.

 1   Bounomo had it in 1995 and that was the reason for
 2   his symptoms, they would have presented sooner, but
 3   they didn't.
 4             While we are talking about Dr. Berndt, the
 5   first doctor who saw him, the first doctor who
 6   started this chain of medical records, I'm sure
 7   counsel is going to make a bigger deal when he comes
 8   up here about the fact that my experts disagree with
 9   these treating physicians.  He touched on it the 10   first time.  I'm sure when I sit down he is going to
11   touch on it again.
12             But my doctors aren't the only ones who
13   said something in the treater's records was wrong.
14   Mrs. Buonomo went through a number of errors in Dr.
15   Berndt's records with you.  Dr. Berndt says Mr.
16   Buonomo was not compliant and didn't like
17   physicians.  Dr. Berndt said he had not smoked in
18   year.  Everybody told you that is not true.  Dr.
19   Berndt recorded he had quit drinking about ten years
20   or so.  She told you he never had any drinking
21   issues.  Dr. Berndt told you he did not exercise.
22   She told you he walked all over the place.  Finally,
23   Dr. Berndt said he didn't drive because he lived in
24   Brooklyn, New York.  She told you that was wrong.
25   He was in New Jersey.  He was on the other side of

 1   the river.
 2             It must be okay for the plaintiffs to
 3   disagree with the treating physicians when they want
 4   to, but it is not okay for my medical experts to
 5   give you medical reasons why they disagree.
 6             I want to talk about this point of
 7   emphysema, emphysematous changes.  Again, I'm not at
 8   big label guy.  But I want to talk about emphysema.
 9   No matter what people call it, emphysematous
10   changes, bullae emphysema,  or emphysema, I think
11   everybody can agree emphysema is an anatomical
12   feature in somebody's lung that is a destruction of
13   the air sacs.  And remember the doctor showing you
14   those air sacs.  That is what it is.  That is what
15   emphysema refers to.  When you want to talk about
16   bullae changes, that is what experts do.  They stick
17   in their field.  For Dr. Dautenhahn as a
18   radiologist, what radiologists say is emphysematous
19   changes.  They want to say he disagreed over
20   everything.  You saw a lot of X-rays, X-ray reports,
21   CT reports from 2007, 2008, that use the same
22   language that Dr. Dautenhahn used, emphysematous
23   changes.
24             You can have these changes, but not as
25   COPD.  People who don't have COPD have them.  The

 1   only way to know if emphysematous changes, or
 2   emphysema, or bullae emphysema, the only way to know
 3   if that is COPD is to do a pulmonary function test.
 4             More importantly, emphysema is permanent.
 5   Dr. Bolton said it is permanent and irreversible.
 6   If you have it, if you have that anatomical
 7   destruction at some point, you are going to have it
 8   from here to the rest of your life.  So if it
 9   appears on one X-ray, it will appear on every other
10   one because it's permanent and irreversible.
11             There are two ways that you can diagnose 12   emphysema, pathology and radiology.  Two ways you
13   can do it on pathology.  You can do a lung biopsy.
14   That is when a person is alive, they use a
15   procedure, a surgery.  They go into a person's lung
16   and you get out a piece of the tissue of their lung
17   and you look at it.  If you look at it you can see
18   the destruction of those air sacs.  Mr. Buonomo
19   never had a biopsy done.
20             The second way you can do it on pathology
21   is autopsy.  After a person passes away, you can
22   autopsy, you can look for these things.
23             Despite the fact that this lawsuit was
24   filed before Mr. Buonomo died and cause of death was
25   an issue.  And his diagnosis was an issue, no

 1   autopsy was conducted either looking for
 2   pathological proof of COPD or emphysema.  There
 3   isn't that proof in this case.  It is not there.
 4             If addition to pathology, you can see
 5   these emphysematous changes or emphysema on
 6   radiology.  Plaintiffs didn't call a single
 7   radiologist.  None of their treaters were
 8   radiologists.  They all admitted it.
 9             But Reynolds did.  We called Dr.
10   Dautenhahn, a man who looks at thousands of chest
11   CTs.  Thousands of X-rays.  He teaches radiology.
12   He testified from his review of all the films and we
13   went through them yesterday.  Went through one after
14   the other.  He told you the first time that he saw
15   any emphysematous change, any emphysema at all, was
16   in 2007.
17             I want to talk a little bit about some of
18   the findings before and see what happened in 1995 up
19   to 2007.  Mr. Buonomo had a CT scan of his chest in
20   May of 1995.  You heard CT is a much more sensitive
21   way to see the changes, much more sensitive than a
22   chest X-ray.  If we look at the report, Dr. Styles
23   was the radiologist who read the CT.  You never
24   heard any testimony from Dr. Styles.  Dr. Styles'
25   impression, moderate right plural effusion with

 1   focus of atelectasis or other infiltrate at the
 2   right lung base posterior.  No evidence of discrete
 3   pulmonary nodule mass, no evidence of significant
 4   interstitial disease.
 5             Dr. Styles didn't record hyperinflation,
 6   he didn't record blebs.  He didn't record bullae or
 7   emphysematous changes.  Dr. Dautenhahn agreed with
 8   this finding.  Dr. Styles we assume agreed with this
 9   finding.
10             The plaintiffs will tell you they were
11   looking for mediastinal disease here.  Come on.
12   Radiologists have to look at the film and write down
13   what they see.  They don't write down what someone 14   else is asking them to look for.  They write down
15   what they see.  That is their professional
16   obligation.  Dr. Styles didn't see anything
17   consisting with emphysema or COPD in May of '95.
18             Dr. Bolton, another plaintiff expert.  He
19   agrees with what Dr. Styles says.  There is no
20   mention of blebs or bullae in the lungs as one would
21   expect in a case where a patient who had COPD or
22   emphysema.  On this report, it is not mentioned.
23             Okay, and the treating radiologist here in
24   his examination notes did not know of any condition
25   in Mr. Bounomo's CT scan from May of 1995 consistent

 1   with emphysema?  Correct.  There is no impression
 2   that would indicate emphysema by this CAT scan.
 3             That is Dr. Bolton.  Did he look at the
 4   X-ray or CT scan and seeing something different?  We
 5   didn't hear about that.
 6             The X-ray report that lists bullae
 7   changes, October of 1995, lots of testimony on this.
 8   Dr. Klotz told you he looked at it and didn't see
 9   it.  Dr. Klotz said he thinks there was bullae
10   emphysema in 2007.  Dr. Dautenhahn showed you the
11   X-ray, put it up there, and said there is no bullae
12   changes in this.  Nothing.
13             Did plaintiffs call anyone to show you
14   where the bullae changes were?  Did plaintiffs call
15   the radiologist who wrote the record to have him
16   show you or explain what he is talking about?  Did
17   the plaintiff give you any proof at all as to where
18   or what bullae changes they were referring to there?
19   No.  Because they didn't show you a single X-ray or
20   a single CT in their case.
21             The reason behind beyond what Dr.
22   Dautenhahn said when he looked at the radiology, the
23   reason we know there is no bullae changes or
24   emphysematous change in October of 1995 is because
25   they are not on the May CT that Dr. Styles talked

 1   about.  He doesn't describe them.
 2             And you remember these changes are
 3   permanent.  They would be there.  They weren't
 4   there.  The only thing we know a month later in
 5   1995, the radiologist doesn't mention them either.
 6   If he thought they were there in October, poof, they
 7   are gone in November of '95.  That is not how
 8   emphysema works.  It is not how COPD works.  They
 9   are permanent, irreversible.
10             Dr. Dautenhahn admitted he saw
11   emphysematous changes in 2007, but doesn't see
12   anything prior to that.  Nothing prior to November
13   21, 1996.
14             There is no proof Mr. Buonomo had COPD
15   before November 21, 1996.  A PFT is needed to make a 16   diagnosis.  One was never done.  Mr. Buonomo didn't
17   have chronic symptoms consistent with COPD at that
18   point.  The doctors never took a biopsy, and you
19   can't see emphysema on any other radiology.  When
20   you consider all this evidence, when you demand
21   proof, the plaintiff can't provide it before
22   November of 1996.
23             As I said, we don't have the burden of
24   proof to show you anything.  But we did put on
25   evidence and I think we proved what Mr. Buonomo had

 1   in 1995 and had throughout his life was congestive
 2   heart failure.
 3             The only cardiologist you heard from was
 4   today, Dr. Yount.  That's it.  The only one.  There
 5   are seven other cardiologists who looked at the
 6   echocardiograms.  With the exception of a minor
 7   thing here on a percentage of ejection fraction, Dr.
 8   Yount agreed with all of Mr. Buonomo's
 9   cardiologists.
10             Plaintiff never called a cardiologist to
11   dispute what Dr. Yount was going to say.  No one to
12   discuss the symptoms of congestive heart failure.
13   No one to discuss the fact that he had left-sided
14   congestive heart failure, no one to interpret the
15   echocardiograms.
16             I want to go quickly and look at some of
17   the records.  Dr. Bolton testified to his medical
18   record from early on May of 1995.  He says when this
19   patient comes to him in the hospital, I cannot rule
20   out the possibility of heart failure.  From day one,
21   this condition was possibly due to heart failure and
22   his doctors knew it.
23             There are a number of reasons that
24   demonstrate why he had congestive heart failure.  I
25   want to go over those quickly.  The symptoms were

 1   consistent.  The onset was consistent,
 2   echocardiograms were consistent, reduced ejection
 3   fraction, the subsequent history, and the BMP
 4   levels.
 5             About the symptoms, Dr. Bolton told you a
 6   productive cough is a symptom.  Dr. Bolton told you
 7   peripheral edema, swelling, symptom of congestive
 8   heart failure.  Dr. Feinstein told you bilateral
 9   effusions and confusion are symptoms.  You know from
10   the doctors, the testimony you heard, and the
11   medical records that Mr. Buonomo suffered from these
12   symptoms.
13             We heard about the onset of his disease
14   because Dr. Yount testified -- He is a cardiologist,
15   I'm not.  I can't explain it the way he did.  But he
16   talked about the onset of Mr. Buonomo's disease in
17   1995 and how that severe respiratory failure is 18   consistent with congestive heart failure.
19             We showed you the echocardiogram from Dr.
20   Borshuk May 15th, 1995.  The cardiologist agrees.
21   He said impression, dilated left ventricle and left
22   atrium with diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis,
23   and moderate reduction ejection fraction to
24   38 percent.
25             Dr. Yount just explained to you this is

 1   classic leftsided congestive heart failure.  Dr.
 2   Issa  agreed that Mr. Buonomo's heart problems of
 3   1995 were leftsided, not rightsided, not cor
 4   pulmonale.
 5             Dr. Issa's testimony.
 6             As is reflected in the records from 1995,
 7   heart problems were leftsided, not rightsided.
 8             Leftsided?
 9             Yes, sir.
10             We learned that congestive heart failure
11   can describe all of Mr. Buonomo's respiratory
12   problems.  Dr. Yount explained that.  Dr. Bolton
13   talked about patients with leftsided heart failure.
14   What did he say about that?
15             The ejection fraction that was reported
16   leftsided ventricular defect.  You agreed with
17   patients with leftsided heart failure are short of
18   breath?  Yes.  And depending on the severity of that
19   leftsided heart failure, they can be in respiratory
20   failure?  Correct.
21             That is what happened to Mr. Buonomo in
22   May of 1995.  The evidence you heard demonstrates he
23   had congestive heart failure in 1995.  The symptoms,
24   the onset, the echocardiograms, everything
25   consistent with congestive heart failure.  This is

 1   evidence of leftsided heart failure in May of '95,
 2   not evidence, not proof of COPD.
 3             You also learned that leftsided congestive
 4   heart failure can be caused by hypertension, sleep
 5   apnea, obesity was mentioned by Dr. Yount.  And you
 6   know Mr. Buonomo had hypertension.  That was the
 7   first thing that Dr. Berndt gave him medication for.
 8   He underwent a sleep study.  Maybe he had sleep
 9   apnea, maybe he didn't, but he wore a machine for
10   it.  Neither of these are caused by smoking.  Heart
11   failure is not caused by smoking.
12             Mr. Buonomo's history after 1995 provide
13   further proof that he had congestive heart failure.
14   I said in opening that I thought the evidence was
15   going to be that he didn't see a doctor from
16   December of 1995 until March of 1999.  The plaintiff
17   showed us an indication of medications where he got
18   a prescription or was getting medication in 1998.  I
19   will agree, I didn't see that before.  He didn't see 20   a doctor from 1995 until sometime in 1998.
21             They can talk about missing charts or
22   records not being complete.  They can say that he
23   saw doctors and we just don't have a progress note
24   from it.  But this case is about proof.  Saying
25   something isn't there, something might have been

 1   there, something might be missing, is not proof.
 2             If we look in the record, when you string
 3   things together, you can tell Mr. Buonomo was not
 4   getting chest X-rays all the time between 1995 and
 5   1999.  Remember we had the October of '95 X-ray, the
 6   November of '95 X-ray, and the March of '95 X-ray.
 7   Let's look at those quickly.
 8             October of 1995 X-ray.  November of 1995,
 9   from the same diagnostic folks, it compares to the
10   previous chest X-ray which was the month before.  In
11   1999, the next X-ray we have, the next X-ray of
12   approval the comparison study is way back to
13   November 29, 1995.
14             Were there other X-rays in there?  I don't
15   know.  There is no evidence of them.  We haven't
16   seen them.  We didn't have a chance to look at them
17   if they exist.  That is no record from looking at
18   these records that that was the case.  Dr. Klotz
19   walked you through a number of medical records that
20   talked about the condition Mr. Buonomo was in.
21             Dr. Yount talked today about out how
22   congestive heart failure can compensate and
23   decompensate.  COPD is supposed to be chronic,
24   permanent.  We looked at a number of records from
25   1999 to 2000.  I think you got tired me going

 1   through them and I think Dr. Klotz was tired of me
 2   asking about them.  All of these times where there
 3   are no complaints and the lungs are clear, the
 4   plaintiffs may argue Mr. Buonomo just wasn't a
 5   complainer, he didn't go in and tell his doctors he
 6   was having any problems.  But the doctors do their
 7   own assessment of him and their own assessment said
 8   the lungs are clear.
 9             Clear lungs with no complaints are not
10   proof of COPD.  The same pattern continued with Dr.
11   Silver, 2002, 2003.  We went through these.  These
12   are in evidence.  You can look at them.  No
13   respiratory distress.  Breath sounds normal.  This
14   isn't me saying he was having normal breath sounds
15   in 2002, 2003.  These are the treating physician.
16   The folks who put a stethoscope up to his chest and
17   listen.  Normal breath sounds are his only chronic
18   condition here.
19             We heard in 2004 he had a decompensation
20   from congestive heart failure and he was back in the
21   hospital.  We also heard he was receiving Digoxin 22   and Lasix from 1995 that was supposed to treat and
23   help compensate the congestive heart failure.
24             But he wasn't always getting the right
25   amount of Digoxin, and we have a composite of these

 1   records that showed the Digoxin levels below the
 2   therapeutic level.  One of the doctors on video was
 3   saying it is only one tenth below, it is only two
 4   tenths below.  This is a pretty small rating.  It is
 5   supposed to be .9 to 2.0.  It is a pretty concise
 6   measurement.  All of those are below it.
 7             In 2004, Mr. Buonomo goes to the hospital
 8   and gets treatment.  His condition improves.  Dr.
 9   Yount told him he was able to go home.  Again, just
10   like 1995.  This is how congestive heart failure
11   works.  It is not how COPD works.
12             We get to 2007.  He has another bout of
13   respiratory problems.  He undergoes another
14   echocardiogram.  We showed it to you this morning.
15   Left ventricular hypokinesis, reduction in ejection
16   fracture 35 to 40 percent.  Dr. Yount told you this
17   is leftsided heart failure.  Dr. Issa agreed.
18             Let's look at what he said.
19             "Question:  We went through all the
20   findings of that CT and at the bottom, those are all
21   findings consistent with leftsided heart failure;
22   correct?
23             "Answer:  Correct.
24             You didn't hear from any cardiologist who
25   disagree with Dr. Yount.  There is no question Mr.

 1   Buonomo had congestive heart failure.  Dr. Issa put
 2   him in a congestive heart disease management
 3   program.  This is the same time Mrs. Buonomo
 4   testified no doctor told her that her husband had
 5   congestive heart failure, when he was in a program
 6   for it.
 7             Dr. Yount testified when doctors record
 8   congestive heart failure in a record, cardiologists
 9   refer to it as leftsided congestive heart failure.
10   That is what he learned when he was becoming a
11   cardiologist.  That is what they told him when he
12   was a fellow.  That is what he does when he teaches
13   people at LSU.  That is the way cardiologists refer
14   to heart failure.
15             Dr. Issa said yes, I have all of these
16   statements in my records of congestive heart
17   failure, but they were not leftsided, they were all
18   rightsided.  Dr.  Yount is a cardiologist.  Dr. Issa
19   isn't.
20             None of the seven cardiologists who looked
21   at Mr. Buonomo's echocardiograms from 1995 to his
22   last one said he has rightsided congestive heart
23   failure or cor pulmonale.  That is what the 24   cardiologists said.
25             But there is even further proof of

 1   congestive heart failure.  We talked a lot about
 2   BMP.  We saw the BMP values throughout this case.
 3   Let's look at the bar graph.  Normal goes up to 861.
 4   Other diseases can cause an elevation.  COPD, as Mr.
 5   McPharlin elicited on cross, COPD can cause an
 6   elevation, but Dr. Yount said it might take it up to
 7   a thousand, 1200.
 8             Look at Mr. Bounomo's values.  We even
 9   heard there were other ones that were 10,000.  No
10   other disease other than leftsided heart failure can
11   cause BMP values like this.
12             I am going show you a little bit of
13   testimony about Mr. Buonomo's final illness.
14   November of 2008 he is back in the hospital.  Chest
15   X-ray is taken.  The radiologist there is Dr.
16   Rosendorf.  Dr. Rosendorf said followup respiratory
17   failure, congestive heart failure.  That is what the
18   radiologist said.  Dr. Issa agreed that on that
19   study.  Dr. Rosendorf didn't describe anything
20   consistent with COPD.  See at the bottom?  He
21   doesn't describe any emphysematous changes; right?
22   He doesn't use the term COPD to describe what he
23   sees on the film.  Correct.  That is what Dr. Issa,
24   their expert, is saying about Dr. Rosendorf.  That
25   is not something Dr. Dautenhahn is saying.  That is

 1   what their experts are saying.
 2             Another radiologist two days later, Dr.
 3   Klotz had a similar observation.  No COPD.  X-rays
 4   on the 29th and 30th reveal bilateral pleural
 5   effusions consolidation, interstitial lung disease
 6   suggestive of congestive heart failure, and on the
 7   next day the same thing.
 8             December 8th chest X-ray read by another
 9   radiologist Dr. Joseph.  No description of -- What
10   does Dr. Bolton say about it?  He didn't describe
11   blebs, bullae, or he didn't describe emphysema, he
12   didn't describe hyperinflation, and he didn't
13   diagnose Mr. Buonomo with COPD.
14             Based upon all of that, Dr. Issa reaches
15   this conclusion.  Most of the chest X-rays looked
16   like congestive heart failure.
17             Dr. Feinstein admits the same thing about
18   Dr. Palacia from a December 9th X-ray.  Dr. Goldberg
19   X-rays on December 10th.  They go on and on.  If you
20   talk about disagreeing with the treating physicians,
21   disagreeing with what doctors have to say, what were
22   Dr. Rosendorf, Dr. Klotz, Dr. Joseph, Dr. Palacia,
23   Dr. Goldberg.  At the end of his life, congestive
24   heart failure.  None.  COPD.  Based on elevated BMP
25   level, the chest X-rays, the CT scans, the symptoms, 1889
 1   the echocardiogram, and Mr. Buonomo's history, the
 2   evidence is Mr. Buonomo died as a result of
 3   exacerbation of congestive heart failure, not COPD.
 4   Even Dr. Bolton admits he can't rule out congestive
 5   heart failure as the cause of Mr. Buonomo's death.
 6             Now, plaintiff pointed quite a bit to Dr.
 7   Feinstein, the doctor who filled out the death
 8   certificate.  Dr. Feinstein agrees with all of these
 9   records.  Fist of all, he didn't look at any records
10   before October of 2007 I think.  He didn't go back
11   more than a year to look at records.  He determined
12   the cause of death.
13             But one of things Dr. Feinstein was asked,
14   and he testified to this in front of you by
15   videotape, would you refer to a board-certified
16   cardiologist who said that Mr. Buonomo's death was
17   due to congestive heart failure, yes.  So the
18   cardiologist weighing in his opinion on this would
19   defer to his judgment.  He said yes.
20             That cardiologist, the only cardiologist
21   you heard from in this case, is Dr. Yount.  I don't
22   know if one of the seven other cardiologists who had
23   the same thing down in their echocardiograms would
24   have agreed.
25             What caused Mr. Buonomo's death in 2008 is

 1   what caused him to be hospitalized in 1995,
 2   congestive heart failure.  So when you demand proof
 3   on this medical issue, this is the proof we have.
 4   There was never a PFT.  The radiology was consistent
 5   with congestive heart failure.  There was no chronic
 6   symptoms before 1995.  There was never any lung
 7   pathology of emphysema.  There was no biopsy or
 8   autopsy taken.
 9             Mr. Buonomo had congestive heart failure
10   in 1995 and thereafter.  His congestive heart
11   failure can and does explain his respiratory
12   problems.  His echocardiograms consistently show
13   leftsided heart failure, both diastolic and
14   systolic, and his BMP values demonstrate leftsided
15   heart failure.
16             When you consider this, there is no way
17   that the greater weight of the evidence supports
18   COPD.  In fact, it is just the opposite.
19             You had a look at the verdict form before.
20   I want to put it up and talk to you a little bit
21   about it.  Two questions.  The first one did Matthew
22   Buonomo have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
23   before November 21, 1996.  Second, was Matthew
24   Buonomo addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine
25   and, if so, was such addition a legal cause of the

 1   COPD.  2             If you decide the answer to either one of
 3   those questions is no, we go home.  There is no
 4   phase two like plaintiff's counsel talked about.
 5   That ends this case.  So this can be the last time I
 6   have the opportunity to address you.  If you say the
 7   answer to either one of these questions is no, that
 8   ends the case.
 9             While I have enjoyed being before you and
10   I have enjoyed trying the case, I think the evidence
11   mandates this should and will be the last time I
12   appear before you because the question, did Matthew
13   Buonomo have COPD before November 21, 1996, the
14   greater weight of the evidence, the proof in this
15   case is that he did not.  The answer to that
16   question is no.
17             We talked in voir dire.  And you all
18   agreed if the evidence warranted it you would be
19   able to return a verdict for my client, R.J.
20   Reynolds.  You said you would sit there.  You said
21   nobody would hold anything against experts called to
22   testify on behalf of R.J. Reynolds.  You said if the
23   evidence warranted a verdict in R.J. Reynolds's
24   behalf, all of you could check no to that question.
25   Ladies and gentlemen, the evidence warrants checking

 1   no.
 2             I thank you again for your attention.  I
 3   thank you for your patience.  I thank you for your
 4   service.
 5             Thank you.
