16             MR. GEISE:  Thank you, Your Honor.
17             May it please counsel, most importantly,
18   you, the jury.
19             This is the end.  After three weeks of
20   hard work by plaintiff's counsel, defense counsel
21   and the jury, we are at the end.  The work is almost
22   over.  The process is almost over.  This will be the
23   last time that I have the privilege to stand before
24   the seven of you.  And it has been my privilege.  I
25   want to start today as I started every time I have

 1   been before you, from voir dire sessions, opening
 2   and closing in phase one, opening in phase two, by
 3   thanking you.  You dedicated yourself to this trial
 4   in a way few juries have ever done before.  For
 5   three weeks you have been here on time every time.
 6   Witnesses and testimony that sometimes is boring,
 7   sometimes not, you stayed awake.  You paid
 8   attention.  You took notes.  You asked questions.
 9   You have gone above and beyond.  You have missed
10   work to be here and you have missed probably lots of
11   other things you would have rather have been doing
12   than sitting on a jury.
13             This has been a disruption to your lives,
14   and we're eternally grateful to you for accepting
15   that disruption.  No one will ever be able to
16   question your commitment to our jury system, and I
17   thank you.  I thank you.  Mr. Reid thanks you.  My
18   client thanks you.
19             I want to start by putting the focus back
20   on where this case really belongs.  This case is not
21   a referendum on cigarettes or cigarette smoking.
22   This is not a trial where you are going to give a
23   thumbs up or thumbs down vote on smoking.
24   Cigarettes, for all their health risks, are a legal
25   product.  They are legal to manufacture.  They are

 1   legal to advertise.  They are legal to sell.  They
 2   are legal to smoke.
 3             As the judge will instruct you, the
 4   manufacture and sale of cigarettes is a legal
 5   activity.  So our job is not to decide whether this
 6   should be a legal product or not.  That is the
 7   government's job, and they have already done that  8   job.  You can't hold Reynolds liable for the mere
 9   act of selling cigarettes.
10             You have heard from a number of witnesses
11   and seen lots of documents.  You have probably heard
12   the acronyms PFT, COPD, DSM, CTR more than you ever
13   wanted to hear.
14             In phase one you determined that Mr.
15   Buonomo was addicted and his addiction was a cause
16   of COPD.  As I mentioned last Friday, I may not
17   agree with that, but I respect that version.  But in
18   this phase, we move beyond that determination, and
19   we need to decide a new set of issues, issues that
20   concern how the testimony and documents you heard
21   relate if at all to Mr. Buonomo and the choices he
22   made.
23             One of the first issues you'll need to
24   decide that counsel talked about is the cause of
25   deaths.  This is something we talked about a lot in

 1   phase one.  At the end of phase one, I gave you my
 2   explanation for why I thought the cause of death was
 3   congestive heart failure.  You heard from our
 4   doctors.
 5        A.   You saw the record from the cardiologist.
 6   I didn't get a chance last week to ask you why you
 7   ruled the way you did, but I'm going to assume it
 8   was because you thought Mr. Buonomo had COPD and
 9   COPD caused his death.  If I'm wrong, you can check
10   the appropriate box on the version form.  But I'm
11   not going to spend the time today rehashing what I
12   said last week.  You are all smart people.  You took
13   notes.  You remember what was said.
14             I want to move on to the other issues that
15   are really new for phase two.  As the judge
16   instructed you at the beginning of this phase, there
17   are only going to be three issues we are going to be
18   concerned about.  I want to spend a minute talking
19   about each of these, causation, fault, and damages.
20             If the answer to the first one is in a
21   certain way, you don't worry about two and three.
22   If the answer to two is in a certain way, you don't
23   worry about three.
24             On causation, the judge instructed you on
25   certain findings made by another jury in a class

 1   action.  Those findings are not in dispute in this
 2   case, but Mr. Buonomo's facts were not in dispute in
 3   that case.  That is why we are here.  That is why we
 4   have this case.  That other case did not involve Mr.
 5   Buonomo.  So we are here to look at those findings
 6   and to look at them in conjunction with what we
 7   learned about Mr. Buonomo and his decisions to
 8   determine if the plaintiff met the burden of proving
 9   that those findings actually had something to do 10   with Mr. Buonomo and his addiction, his COPD, and
11   his death.
12             It is not enough to prove that cigarettes
13   caused Mr. Buonomo's addiction or COPD.  That is not
14   enough.  If that was it, we would have been done
15   after phase one.  That was just the prerequisite to
16   get to this step.  Now the plaintiff has to take
17   that conduct and they have to show it was the legal
18   cause of Mr. Buonomo's addiction, COPD, and his
19   death.
20             You'll receive a definition of legal cause
21   from the judge.  Legal cause means but for the
22   conduct, the injury would not have occurred.  But
23   for the negligence, the injury would have never
24   occurred.  But for is going to be very important as
25   you make your deliberations.

 1             As I mentioned last week, phase two
 2   requires the plaintiff to build a bridge that links
 3   the findings from that other jury to Mr. Buonomo's
 4   decision.  It is abridged between the two.  It is a
 5   but-for bridge.  That is how the bridge has to be
 6   built.
 7             The plaintiff has to build that bridge by
 8   proving that Reynolds' conduct and what they did or
 9   didn't do or what it said or didn't say was the
10   legal cause, the but-for cause of Mr. Buonomo's
11   choices.
12             I don't think the plaintiff met that
13   burden or built that bridge.  The plaintiff didn't
14   identify a specific negligent act yet alone one that
15   was a but-for cause of Mr. Buonomo reason to smoke.
16             The plaintiff didn't identify a specific
17   product defect.  They said cigarettes are harmful,
18   that cigarettes can be addictive.  All cigarettes
19   are like that.  They didn't point to a specific
20   defect that is the but-for cause of Mr. Buonomo's
21   injury.  The plaintiff can't show Mr. Buonomo's
22   decisions would have been different but for
23   something Reynolds did because Mr. Buonomo's choices
24   were his choices.
25             He was a decisive man.  He made his own

 1   choices.  His choices about smoking were not caused
 2   by the conduct listed by that other jury.  His
 3   choices were made by his own decisionmaking or those
 4   around him.
 5             I want to talk about three main smoking
 6   decisions Mr. Buonomo made, his choice to start
 7   smoking, his choice to smoke a specific brand, and
 8   his choice to quit.
 9             Even though Mrs. Buonomo did not met Mr.
10   Bounomo until about ten years after he started
11   smoking, we heard stories about when he started in 12   1941 or 1942.  He went down to the store with his
13   cousin, and they bought penny cigarettes.  We don't
14   know why he went to that store or why he bought
15   those first cigarettes.  We don't know what his
16   first reaction was to those cigarettes.
17             There is no evidence he started smoking in
18   response to anything Reynolds did or said.  There is
19   no evidence that anyone from Reynolds handed him a
20   cigarette and made him smoke it.  The evidence is he
21   went down to the store with his cousin and he bought
22   a penny cigarette.  That was a choice they made.
23   Nothing about Reynolds was the but-for legal cause
24   of why he started smoking.
25             From that first penny cigarette in the

 1   early 1940s, he made the decision to continue
 2   smoking throughout that decade.  None of the
 3   plaintiff's experts told you he became addicted on
 4   that first cigarette.  There is no one including
 5   Reynolds that forced him to continue smoking during
 6   the 1940s.  He had ability to decide whether to
 7   continue smoking or not during this period of time.
 8             One thing we know.  In the late 1940s, Mr.
 9   Buonomo was in the military.  That is also the time
10   when Mrs. Buonomo began sending him cigarettes in
11   his care package.  He would get candy, sweets, and
12   he also got cigarettes.  Mrs. Buonomo testified she
13   sent him Camel cigarettes.
14             She didn't make that selection on the
15   basis of Mr. Buonomo's request from overseas.  She
16   didn't make that decision based on any advertising.
17   She didn't say she made that decision based on any
18   statements Reynolds made.  She sent Mr. Buonomo
19   Camel cigarettes because those were the cigarettes
20   her father smoked.
21             When we look at Mr. Buonomo's early
22   smoking history, there are two things that were
23   involved, what family members smoked and his peers,
24   his cousin.
25             Let's look at what Dr. Henningfield said

 1   about the importance of parents and peers.  Dr.
 2   Henningfield was asked, in fact, people start
 3   smoking for different reasons.  Yes.  There are a
 4   number of factors that are major factors.  As a
 5   matter of fact, the surgeon general has identified
 6   what are the major factors, and they are peers and
 7   parents; right?  Peers, yes.  Parents are a major
 8   factor.
 9             Let's look about how Mr. Buonomo selected
10   his brand when he got back to the States in October
11   of 1952.  Ms. Buonomo testified when he got back and
12   they started dating, his brands were Lucky Strike,
13   Chesterfield, and Camel. 14             We didn't hear any testimony about why
15   those were his three brands or how he picked those
16   three brands.  It was just a fact those are his
17   three brands.  Look how he settled on his regular
18   brands.  Listen to the testimony of Mrs. Buonomo:
19             "Question:  You didn't like the smell of
20   the Chesterfield or his Lucky Strike cigarettes, did
21   you?
22             "Answer:  Horrible.  No.
23             "Question:  You told him you liked the
24   smell of the Camels but not the Chesterfields or
25   Lucky Strikes?

 1             "Answer:  That's correct.
 2             "Question:  So he started smoking Camel
 3   then?
 4             "Answer:  That's correct.
 5             "Question:  I think you testified that
 6   beginning in the 1950s, then his regular brand
 7   remained Camel?
 8             "Answer:  Yes.
 9             Reynolds' conduct was not the but-for
10   cause of Mr. Buonomo's selection of Camel as his
11   regular brand.  Advertising didn't influence that
12   decision.  The but-for cause was Mrs. Buonomo's
13   preference for what she wanted to smell.  If she had
14   preferred the smell of Chesterfield, that is what
15   Mr. Buonomo would have smoked.  The reason he smoked
16   Camel was because of her nose preference.
17             Mr. Camel settled on Camel in 1952, and
18   you saw it was his regular brand for a number of
19   years, 20 years or so.  And there is the testimony
20   about what he did in those 20 years.
21             "Question:  He told you he liked the taste
22   of Camel?
23             "Answer:  Yes.
24             "Question:  And he tried other cigarettes,
25   but he returned to Camels because of the taste?

 1             "Answer:  Yes.
 2             It was his personal preference for the
 3   taste, not advertising, not something Reynolds said,
 4   not something The Tobacco Institute said.  It was
 5   his personal preference for the taste of Camels that
 6   kept him coming back to Camels instead of the other
 7   brand he tried.
 8             We heard in the late '70s, maybe the
 9   '80s -- The time period isn't clear -- he switched
10   to Salem.  Mrs. Buonomo wasn't sure about when it
11   was, but she did say he liked the taste of Salem.
12   And it wasn't anything Reynolds said or did that
13   caused him to select Salem.  Again, it was his
14   taste.  If his tastebuds said otherwise and he would
15   have switched from Camel to something else, that 16   something else would have been a cigarette he
17   thought tasted good.
18             We heard about filters and what was said
19   about filters.  Dr. Cummings talked about what was
20   being about filters in 1950.  He mentioned there was
21   misleading advertising about filters in the 1950s.
22   I think they put that in evidence to try to get you
23   to think what was said in the '50s influenced Mr.
24   Buonomo's decisions.
25             But he didn't switch to Salems.  He didn't

 1   switch from the unfiltered Camel to the filtered
 2   Salems for over two decades, until the 1970s.  When
 3   he did make that switch, the brand he settled on was
 4   because of taste.  There is also no evidence that
 5   Mr. Buonomo ever, ever picked this cigarette because
 6   of a tar or nicotine level.  There is no evidence he
 7   thought one was going to be low in tar and low in
 8   nicotine.  The reason he picked his brand was taste
 9   and taste alone.
10             The plaintiff showed you a number of ads.
11   When I sit down, you may see a few more ads.  Dr.
12   Cummings talked about how ads can influence the
13   public.  The ads might influence the public, but we
14   don't have evidence here that they influenced Mr.
15   Buonomo.
16             Matthew Buonomo, in the other case with
17   the other jury with the facts, that didn't have
18   anything to do with Mr. Buonomo.  Maybe that is what
19   they thought was a basis for their liability.  But
20   here we have to look at the testimony about Mr.
21   Buonomo.
22             Let's look at what we heard about the
23   influence of advertising on him first of all from
24   his wife.
25             "Question:  In your deposition, I think

 1   you testified that you didn't know whether your
 2   husband ever smoked a particular brand of cigarette
 3   because of the advertising he saw; is that correct?
 4             "Answer:  He might have them tried them
 5   because of the advertisement.  But I --
 6             "Question:  You just don't know?
 7             "Answer:  I don't know.
 8             So maybe in the '50s, '60s, or '70s when
 9   he tried those other brands, maybe was because of an
10   advertisement.  But he always came back to Camel or
11   Salem because of the taste.  He didn't rely on the
12   ads to pick his brand.
13             Let's look at what his daughter Marilyn
14   said:
15             "Question:  Did your father ever talk to
16   you about cigarette advertising?
17             "Answer:  No. 18             "Question:  Did he ever tell you that he
19   bought a cigarette because advertisements?
20             "Answer:  No.
21             And this other daughter Paula:
22             "Question:  Your dad never mentioned any
23   specific advertising to you over the years?
24             "Answer:  No.  He really didn't mention to
25   me the advertising I can recall.

 1             That is the evidence.
 2             Now, more doctors smoke Camels.  We saw
 3   these ads.  We heard about this.
 4             Yesterday Dr. Cummings told you it was an
 5   ad campaign that ended in the fall of 1952.  In
 6   October of 1952 Mr. Buonomo returned to the States.
 7             "Answer:  At the time he returned to the
 8   States, he picked Camel as his regular brand over
 9   Lucky Strike and over Chesterfield.
10             Did he pick it because more doctors smoked
11   Camel, or did he pick it because that is what Mrs.
12   Buonomo preferred?  In the fall of 1952, that ad
13   campaign went away forever.  That was it.  So there
14   is no evidence that Mr. Buonomo started smoking
15   because of that campaign.  We know why he picked
16   Camel when he got back.  We know why he continued to
17   smoke Camel.  Because of the taste.  Most doctors
18   smoked Camels is not the but-for clause of any
19   decisions Mr. Buonomo made.
20             There is no evidence in this case Mr.
21   Buonomo would have made a different choice if
22   Reynolds said something different.  Plane and
23   simple, his personal taste was the but-for cause on
24   his smoking decisions, not advertising, not
25   statements, not Reynolds' conduct.  His taste.

 1             In the mid 1990s -- We talked about this a
 2   lot in phase one -- Mr. Buonomo was hospitalized and
 3   quit smoking.
 4             Apparently nothing anything could have
 5   said to him or showed to him would have mattered to
 6   him until he was hospitalized.  We heard about how
 7   he was trying to quit and was unsuccessful.  He
 8   wasn't going to quit until he got sick.  Some people
 9   are like that.  People have to make their own
10   decisions about when they are going to quit.  It is
11   hard to say what event is going to trigger them.
12             We heard testimony from Mr. Buonomo's
13   daughter Marilyn about this.  I think it was a
14   question one of you asked.
15             One juror asked:
16             "Question:  If cigarette packages would
17   have had the warnings smoking causes cancer, COPD,
18   emphysema, would you still have continued to smoke?
19             "Answer:  I'm really sorry to say I 20   probably would have.  It took my father getting the
21   disease for me to stop.  I had to see it.
22             Her father was ultimately the same way.
23   Despite his attempts to quit with varying degrees of
24   success in his lifetime, he quit once and for all
25   when be was hospitalized.  That is when he made the

 1   decision the impact on his health wasn't worth
 2   smoking anymore.
 3             Even though Mr. Buonomo was addicted,
 4   addiction doesn't mean he didn't have the ability to
 5   quit.  He could have stopped before.  That is the
 6   evidence.  Dr. Henningfield and Dr. Cummings
 7   admitted that addicted smokers can and do quit
 8   permanently, over 50 to 60 million smokers have done
 9   that.
10             There are more ex-smokers now than current
11   smokers, and 90 percent of those have stopped
12   without any assistance.
13             Now, even if addicted, Mr. Buonomo had the
14   ability to quit smoking.  He had the capacity to
15   quit smoking.  And 60 million smokers have.  So
16   there is no question that Mr. Buonomo had the
17   ability to quit.  He had the ability to quit the day
18   he started smoking with penny cigarettes.  He had
19   the ability to quit throughout the 1940s, the '50s,
20   the '60s, the '70s, and '80s.  Even though he was
21   addicted as you determined, that addiction did not
22   rob him of the ability to stop.  And addiction does
23   not negate responsibilities for your actions.
24             I want to talk quickly.  I'm not going to
25   go through the version form.  I think you saw the

 1   questions you are going to answer.  I agree those
 2   are the questions you are going to have to answer.
 3             You can assume the way I'm going to
 4   suggest you should answer them is to check no.  So
 5   I'm not going to take time to walk through them,
 6   this is the question, I suggest no.
 7             I think the evidence I will law out here
 8   will demonstrate that.  But I want to say a couple
 9   words about some of the specific claims and causes
10   of action.
11             Design defect.  I kind of mentioned this
12   before.  What evidence did we hear about the
13   specific defects in cigarettes?  Is it that
14   cigarettes contain nicotine?  Is it that cigarettes
15   contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons?  Are those
16   the specifically defects?  Because those are not
17   specific.  All cigarettes have those.
18             What is the specific defect in the Camel
19   or in the Salem?  That is what a specific defect
20   means.  The testimony in this case is that all
21   cigarettes contain nicotine, and all cigarettes can 22   cause disease.  This is no such thing as a safe
23   cigarette.
24             So what did you see as far as a specific
25   defect?  Nothing.  And you can only hold Reynolds

 1   liable on that cause of action if there is a
 2   specific design defect in the cigarette unique to
 3   those cigarettes that causes the injury.
 4             During phase one and again in phase two,
 5   mostly through Dr. Cummings, you saw lots of
 6   documents.  You saw lots of statements.
 7             The documents that Dr. Cummings showed you
 8   are the same documents he shows other juries.  And
 9   Mr. Reid went through a list of the States where he
10   has been on his campaign as the general on the war
11   on tobacco.
12             Those comments you saw are the same
13   documents the other jurors saw in coming to their
14   findings.  Just seeing those documents like they did
15   isn't enough to hold Reynolds liable.  The documents
16   have to be linked to Mr. Bounomo.  The other jury
17   didn't make that link, and that link wasn't made
18   here either.
19             Dr. Cummings said something interesting
20   about his role and these documents.  This is what he
21   said:
22             "Question:  As you go around testifying,
23   you generally use the same group of documents, and
24   your testimony is pretty similar case to case to
25   case; correct?

 1             "Answer:  Yes.  The facts are the same.
 2             That is not true.  The facts are not the
 3   same in this case as the other case or the other
 4   case or the other case.  The facts are different
 5   here, and the facts matter here.  This case is about
 6   one smoker and one smoker only.  It is about Mr.
 7   Buonomo.  It is not about the other.
 8             You have to determine what those documents
 9   you saw and these statements you heard had to do
10   with Mr. Buonomo.
11             Despite testifying twice in the case, Dr.
12   Cummings admitted something that surprised me.  He
13   specifically didn't give any opinions in this case
14   about Mr. Buonomo personally, his specific case, as
15   opposed to sometimes you do.  His answer, that's
16   correct.  Normally I do.  He didn't have a case
17   specific opinion for you about what those documents
18   and what their impact was to Mr. Buonomo.  He didn't
19   give you that opinion.  He give you the documents,
20   but he didn't help to build that bridge to Mr.
21   Buonomo.  He didn't mention Mr. Buonomo's name once
22   to you.
23             I think the court is going to instruct you 24   about reliance and what reliance means.  I think if
25   we got this right, he will give you the law.  I

 1   think this is what he is going to say.  The next
 2   issue for your determination is whether Mr. Buonomo
 3   reasonably relied to his detriment on any statement
 4   by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company that concealed or
 5   omitted material information and, if so, whether
 6   such reliance was a legal cause of his death.
 7   You'll get that instruction.
 8             There are important points I want to talk
 9   about here, reasonably relied, legal cause.  In
10   other words, if Mr. Buonomo saw a statement in the
11   internal documents, would it have impacted his
12   decision?  That is what legal cause means.
13             So you really have two questions when you
14   look at reliance as you go through the version form.
15   Ask yourself did he see this statement and, if so,
16   did it matter to him.  And if this is something he
17   didn't see, if he had seen it, would it have
18   mattered.  I think on both of those prongs, the
19   answer will be no.
20             I want to talk a few minutes about some
21   of documents and some of things you heard from Dr.
22   Cummings and you heard from counsel here today.
23   The plaintiff argued there was some agreement
24   hatched by the tobacco companies in December of
25   1953, and it was an agreement to get together and

 1   conceal information, and that agreement and that
 2   conspiracy began with the frank statement.
 3             I have a few comments about this argument.
 4   First, in this case, is no evidence that Mr. Buonomo
 5   ever heard, saw, or read the frank statement.  There
 6   is none.  There is no evidence that he ever heard,
 7   saw, or read any statement from CTR, from TIRC, from
 8   TI.  There is none.
 9             There is no evidence anything those groups
10   said ever made a difference in a decision he made.
11   That is the link that needs to be made.  That is the
12   bridge that needs to be built.  You didn't hear that
13   evidence.
14             This meeting in December of 1953 was
15   12 years after Mr. Buonomo start smoking.  After.
16   He didn't start smoking in reliance on some meeting
17   in New York City.  He had been smoking.  This was a
18   year after he picked Camel as his regular brand.  A
19   year after.  He neither started or selected any
20   cigarette based the frank statement.  There is no
21   link between that document and Mr. Buonomo.  It is
22   not the but-for cause of any of his decisions.
23             The second point on this frank statement
24   and this meeting in December, it was far from
25   secret.  You heard before anybody ever met in New 2700
 1   York City that the tobacco companies invited Judge
 2   Barnes, the assistant attorney general for the
 3   United States, to attend.
 4             I have never been a conspirator, but I
 5   don't think I would invite a judge from the Justice
 6   Department to my meeting to hatch a scheme.  I don't
 7   think that would happen.  More than just inviting
 8   him, they sent him their by-laws and their statement
 9   of purpose.  It was known to the Justice Department.
10   If you are going to conceal something, I don't think
11   you invite the government to the meeting.
12             Mr. Reid also took Dr. Cummings through
13   parts of the frank statement, took you through the
14   first few paragraphs.  Recent reports on experiments
15   with mice have given wide publicity to a theory that
16   cigarette smoking is in some way linked with lung
17   cancer in human beings.  Dr. Cummings told you that
18   was true.
19             At the same time, we called attention to
20   the fact that eminent doctors and research
21   scientists had publicly questioned the claimed
22   significance of these experiments.  Had eminent
23   doctors and research scientists pubically questioned
24   them?  Dr. Cummings told you yes, that was true.
25   Who were some of the doctors that did that?  Dr.

 1   Heller from the National Cancer Institute.  Dr.
 2   Stewart from the National Cancer Institute.  Dr.
 3   Hammond from the American Cancer Society.
 4             So if the frank statement was something
 5   put out by the tobacco companies to deceive, it had
 6   support from people from the American Cancer Society
 7   and the National Cancer Institute for what it said.
 8              You look at the sponsors on the frank
 9   statement, all the people listed.  Mr. Reid went
10   through a number of them with Dr. Cummings.  A
11   couple of the organizations, when you looked at it,
12   it probably surprised you because you didn't hear a
13   lot about them in this trial, the Burley Tobacco
14   Growers Cooperation Association and the Maryland
15   Tobacco Growers Association.  They were also
16   sponsors to this.  These were farmers.  Apparently a
17   number of farmers got invited to the same meeting
18   that the Justice Department got invited to.  It is
19   not the select clandestine group of people the
20   plaintiff wants you to I think it was.
21             A final report about the frank statement.
22   It reports on there the TIRC was pledging aid and
23   assistance to the research effort into all phases of
24   tobacco use and health.
25             Plaintiff's counsel just told you that was

 1   fake, that was a complete fake, there was no truth  2   to that whatsoever, it was totally false, totally
 3   fake.  He must not have been paying attention when
 4   Dr. Cummings testified yesterday.  Dr. Cummings told
 5   you that TIRC and CTR gave legitimate grants to
 6   legitimate scientists to do legitimate research.
 7   That is what Dr. Cummings said.  That's fake?
 8   Excellent researchers, even those from Roswell Park
 9   were Dr. Cummings is from.  Was that fake?
10   These researchers published thousands of articles
11   from their grant work, and over 600 of these
12   articles were cited by the surgeon general in his
13   report on smoking and health.  Were those fake
14   cites?  Fake articles?
15             Remember Dr. Cummings talked about the
16   Green Monster?  I wish I had a copy of it.  It is a
17   green monster.  This is a compilation of research
18   funded by the tobacco companies that was turned over
19   to the surgeon general in 1962 or 1963 when they
20   putting together that first report.  It included
21   over six thousand references to research on smoking,
22   addiction, and all phase of tobacco.  It was so
23   helpful that in 1964 the surgeon general commended
24   them on the work.  Was that fake?  I don't think so.
25             Many of the funded articles were critical

 1   or indicted smoking.  You saw one yesterday
 2   afternoon from 1962 entitled Addictive Aspects in
 3   Heavy Cigarette Smoking.  It was co-founded by the
 4   TIRC and the American Cancer Society.  It concluded
 5   that every cigarette smoker appeared to be true
 6   addicts.  This was 1962, two years before the
 7   surgeon general called smoking a habit, not an
 8   addiction.  There was a article published, joint
 9   funding, TIRC, American Cancer Society.  Was the
10   American Cancer Society part of that same agreement?
11             I want to talk a little bit more about
12   some of the documents on nicotine.  The fact that
13   smoking could be hard to quit is not and has not
14   been a secret in the country for 100 years.  The
15   plaintiff didn't produce any evidence that Reynolds
16   ever denied that smoking could be hard to quit.
17             We saw it in trial and we saw it again in
18   the closing statement, this video clip from
19   Reynolds' CEO, Tim Johnson, in 1994 in congress.
20   While we look at the old clips, you can see how
21   things have changed.  Hair styles changed, clothing
22   changed, black and white to color, those things
23   changed.  The one thing that doesn't change is that
24   congressmen like to grandstand at their hearings,
25   and we saw that on those videos.  But if you got

 1   past the grandstanding and listened to what Mr.
 2   Johnson's answer was, he testified he didn't think
 3   cigarettes were addictive according to the classic  4   definition of addiction.  That is what he said.  He
 5   didn't say quitting smoking would be easy.  He
 6   didn't say, ah, quit tomorrow.  He said he didn't
 7   think it was addictive according to the classic
 8   definition.  Plaintiff's experts told you about this
 9   classic definition.
10             Let's see what Dr. Cummings said.  At the
11   time of the surgeon general's report, they also
12   believed that smoking should not be classified as
13   addiction.  Right.  They had criteria for evaluating
14   substances as addictive.  Those were the criteria
15   adopted in the '64 report.  The feeling was it
16   needed to be intoxicating.  That's right.  Nicotine
17   cigarette smoking was not considered at the time by
18   the scientists who wrote that report intoxicating.
19   It is not intoxicating.
20             Dr. Cummings showed you a document from
21   the mid 1970s to show to try to demonstrate that the
22   public didn't understand in the 1970s it could be
23   hard to quit.
24             I don't know about the public, about I do
25   know about Mr. Buonomo.  In the 1970s, he told his

 1   daughter that very information.  Let's look at this
 2   testimony.
 3             "Question:  Did your dad say anything to
 4   you about whether smoking was a hard habit to quit
 5   or not?
 6             "Answer:  He said it would be hard.  I
 7   said I could stop whenever I wanted.  And he said it
 8   would be a hard thing to stop if I didn't do it now.
 9             "Question:  So you were pretty comfortable
10   with your dad appreciating quitting was hard?
11             "Answer:  Yes.  He knew quitting was hard.
12   He knew quitting was hard.
13             This isn't the mid 1970s.  Maybe some
14   other people in the public didn't know that, but Mr.
15   Bounomo did.
16             When he talked to his daughter he didn't
17   say you can quit tomorrow, don't worry about it.  He
18   said quit now.  That was 20 years before Mr.
19   Johnson's congressional testimony that Mr. Buonomo
20   was telling his daughter that information.
21             So did that congressional testimony have
22   anything to do with Mr. Buonomo?  Did you ever hear
23   that he saw it, watched it, that he listened to it,
24   that he made any decision to try to quit or not quit
25   because of it?  There is no reliance on that.  There

 1   is no link.  There is no but-for cause between Mr.
 2   Buonomo and that statement.
 3             You heard a lot about Claude Teague and
 4   his 1953 paper.  Mr. Teague went to the library.  He
 5   did a long book report.  He found everything he  6   could in the library on smoking and cancer, publicly
 7   available articles.  He included them in his report,
 8   78 sources to be exact.  Sources from hard to find
 9   scientific journals like the Journal of the American
10   Medical Association, the Journal of the National
11   Cancer Institute.  That is where he found the
12   information for his report.
13             How could Reynolds conceal information the
14   public when Dr. Teague got the information from the
15   public?  The information was available to the world
16   in 1953.  Any eighth-grader with a library card
17   could have gone and done what Dr. Teague did.
18             So if this information in 1953 was the
19   start of a conspiracy, the conspiracy started with a
20   trip to the library.
21             Dr. Cummings showed you a disclosure of
22   invention from Dr. Teague.  But on cross
23   examination, he admitted he didn't know if there was
24   ever a patent issued for it, and he didn't know if
25   Reynolds ever took action on it.

 1             Remember in opening I said it is like a
 2   suggestion box?  So if Dr. Teague had a suggestion
 3   in there, it was never acted upon it.  If Reynolds
 4   didn't act upon it, how could more Buonomo have
 5   acted upon it?
 6             There is another document, an Alan Rodgman
 7   document, who Dr. Cummings said was an excellent
 8   scientist.  There was a bit of confusion with Mr.
 9   McPharlin and Dr. Cummings on the stand where one
10   had a six- or eight-page version of the document,
11   the other a 24-page version, and we weren't sure
12   which one was going to come in.
13             You learned that the longer version and
14   shorter version were both drafts to begin with.  The
15   longer version had a bibliography of 121 references
16   to support what was written in the report.
17             If you just looked at the abridged version
18   or you just saw the draft, you might have missed the
19   whole story.  You need to consider the context.
20             I told you in opening you are going to see
21   some documents that are going to make you sick, and
22   some you are going to think are stupid, and indeed
23   we saw some of those.  I hope you kept a couple of
24   questions in mind.  Were they drafts or proposals?
25   Were they like Teague's invention or Rodgman's

 1   documents?  Was there ever any evidence that they
 2   were acted upon?
 3             In all the documents you saw, did you ever
 4   see a statement in there saying it is easy to quit,
 5   not hard to quit?
 6             Finally, with all the documents, ask
 7   yourself what do they have to do with the decisions  8   Mr. Buonomo made?
 9             In order to prevail on the claims here on
10   concealment or agreement to conceal, I showed you
11   the plaintiff has to prove reasonable reliance by
12   Mr. Buonomo.
13             We don't know if Mr. Buonomo ever took any
14   action in response to what Reynolds said, so there
15   might not be any reliance at all.  He wasn't
16   influenced to start smoking because of that.  He
17   didn't switch brands because of that.  There was no
18   evidence he was ever affected by any statement made
19   by Reynolds.
20             As I do this today, I want to go through
21   some of the testimony you heard and some of
22   inconsistencies we heard.  This is one area where
23   some of the testimony was inconsistent with some of
24   the other testimony, and you'll have to decide which
25   to believe.

 1             Let's looks at this next slide.
 2             I was asking Mrs. Buonomo:
 3             "Question:  I want to point to your page
 4   153 of your deposition.  You were asked the
 5   following questions.
 6             Were there any statements by tobacco
 7   companies that he committed on as you recall?
 8             "Answer:  I can't recall.
 9             "Question:  Was that your testimony then?
10             "Answer:  If I said it, yes.
11             That was the testimony in the deposition.
12   Here she may have told you something different.
13             Any reliance Mr. Buonomo would have had
14   would not have been reasonable, and I'll show you
15   why.  We know that Mr. Buonomo received numerous
16   messages about the health risks of smoking, not just
17   from the public but from his own family members.
18             His Daughter Paula hounded him in the
19   1960s.
20             "Question:  Your daughter Paula also
21   always tried to get your husband to stop smoking?
22             "Answer:  Correct.
23             "Question:  And I believe she started
24   hounding him about that when she was a teenager?
25             "Answer:  Correct.

 1             "Question:  And that would have been about
 2   the mid 1960s?
 3             "Answer:  Yes.
 4             "Question:  She would tell Mr. Buonomo
 5   that cigarettes were bad for his health at that
 6   time?
 7             "Answer:  Yes.
 8             "Question:  And she would tell him what
 9   she was learning in school? 10             "Answer:  Yes.
11             Mr. Buonomo's reaction to that information
12   is something else that was a little bit different
13   than in deposition than he heard in court.
14             Let's look at that next slide.
15             I asked Mrs. Buonomo:
16             "Question:  He would respond to her by
17   saying I know, I know, I know.
18             She said:
19             "Answer:  I don't know what he was
20   responding to her.  I don't know what she said.
21             "Question:  Mrs. Buonomo, I want to take
22   you back to page 87 of your deposition.  And the
23   question was how could he respond to her requests?
24             And your answer was:
25             "Answer:  I know, I know, I know.  I don't

 1   remember what I said.
 2             How can the plaintiffs say Mr. Buonomo
 3   didn't know about the risk of smoking in 1960 when
 4   he told his daughter he did, he did, he did.  And
 5   when he got that information in the 1960s, he didn't
 6   even try to quit smoking.  He didn't even try.  It
 7   had no impact on him.
 8             Later in the 1970s, Paula became a nurse
 9   and continued to tell him that smoking was bad for
10   his health and could cause lung cancer in the early
11   1970s.
12             I don't want to read through all the
13   testimony.
14             "Question:  Did you mention what you heard
15   to your parents?
16             "Answer:  Yes, I did.
17             "Question:  To both your mom and dad?
18             "Answer:  Yes, I did.
19             Again, that information from his daughter,
20   the nurse, didn't have an impact.  When he caught
21   Marilyn smoking when she was 16, he told her it
22   could be hard to quit.  Whether you call it
23   addiction or habit or whatever it is, he understood
24   the concept, and that is what he told his
25   granddaughter about it.

 1             His granddaughter Elizabeth told you in
 2   kindergarten she learned about the risks of smoking
 3   and told her grandfather about them.
 4             These personal pleas from Mr. Buonomo from
 5   his family members had no impact on him.  There is
 6   no evidence that hearing that or something different
 7   from a tobacco company would have had an impact.
 8             We heard a lot by Dr. Martinez yesterday.
 9   And I could tell from the look on some of your faces
10   you were getting bored.  It was a steady drum beat
11   of information over the course of the entire 20th 12   century.  While it was steady and while it may have
13   have been a little bit boring, what he told you at
14   the end of it is somebody in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s
15   should have known about the risk of smoking.
16             And we learned that Mr. Bounomo was an
17   avid reader.  He read the newspaper.  He read the
18   magazines.  He watched the nightly news.  He was up
19   on current events.  He was the type of person that
20   would see that stuff.
21             Let's look at some of the things here.
22   Let's go to 23 first.  1953 Life Magazine.  Wynder
23   and Gram, mouse skin painting.  You heard Dr.
24   Cummings talk about it.  Life Magazine.  Mrs.
25   Buonomo told you this was popular in their house.

 1   Readers Digest.  You saw all the articles in Readers
 2   Digest, also a magazine the Buonomos received.
 3             You saw polling information including one
 4   from 1954, do you think cigarette smoking is harmful
 5   or not.  This isn't a have you heard.  This is do
 6   you think it is harmful?  Seventy percent said yes.
 7             In 1954, ten years before the surgeon
 8   general's report, you heard about that surgeon
 9   general's report and you heard about the widespread
10   coverage.
11             I want to point out two more of these
12   things.  The Fort Lauderdale News the day after,
13   smoking called a grave hazard, a hazard rather than
14   a true addiction, but this statement carries with it
15   no information that the habit may be broken easily.
16             The Miami Herald the same thing.  I quit
17   smoking at 2:00 P.M. Saturday.  That's it.
18   Cigarettes are guilty.
19             You also heard a little bit about the
20   warning labels on cigarettes and how Mr. and Mrs.
21   Buonomo saw them in the 1970s, and he continued to
22   smoke anyway.  Let's look at her testimony on that.
23             "Question:  The warning at the time said
24   that the surgeon general has determined that
25   cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health?

 1             "Answer:  Correct.
 2             "Question:  You said you saw it and your
 3   husband saw it but you continued smoking?
 4             "Answer:  Yes.
 5             Let's look at all of the warnings together
 6   that appeared beginning in 1966.  See how these were
 7   up there.  On every pack.  On every pack he picked
 8   up.  Let's assume he smoked three packs a day.
 9   Sometimes it was four.  Sometimes it was one to two.
10   Let's assume it is three packs a day.  Let's look at
11   what that math works out to be.
12             Over the course of his smoking history, he
13   saw those warnings over 31,000 times.  When he 14   switched from Camels to Salem, he went from the
15   unfiltered to the filtered.  The warning stayed the
16   same.  There wasn't a warning on the pack that
17   filters were safer than unfiltered.  The warning
18   stayed the same.
19             In addition to the coverage of health
20   risks, there was also coverage about clinics you
21   could go to if you wanted to stop.  Let's look at
22   that.  All of these Quit Cigarettes Clinics, Miami
23   Herald, Fort Lauderdale News, throughout the '60s
24   and '70s.  Mr. Buonomo read the papers, but he
25   didn't go to the clinics.

 1             The health risks, the addictive nature of
 2   smoking was not something secret and only in the
 3   bowels of R.J. Reynolds and their internal
 4   documents.  They were on the front page of the
 5   newspapers and magazines throughout the country.
 6             To determine if reliance is reasonable,
 7   you need to consider whether it was reasonable that
 8   Mr. Buonomo didn't change his smoking behavior in
 9   the face of a number of things, family warnings,
10   newspaper articles, magazine stories, TV news,
11   warning labels, and government findings.  Those
12   things didn't matter to Mr. Buonomo.
13             The plaintiff's theory is that if Reynolds
14   said something publically, that would have been an
15   internal document, or if it said something different
16   it would have made a difference.  Folks, that story
17   doesn't add up.  There is no bridge to link
18   Reynolds' documents to the choices Mr. Buonomo made.
19   There is no reliance, and there is no reasonable
20   reliance.
21             I talked about but-for in relationship to
22   causation.  Let's suppose that Reynolds never
23   existed, you think Mr. Buonomo would have still
24   smoked cigarettes?  If Reynolds said something more
25   or different about the hazards of smoking, do think

 1   Mr. Buonomo would have paid attention to it, that he
 2   would have acted on it, that company have quit
 3   sooner?  This is no evidence that he would have.
 4             Without these links, without this
 5   causation, you answer no to everything on the
 6   verdict form, and you don't move on to the question
 7   of fault.  But if you do answer yes to something, I
 8   want to talk a little bit about the concept of
 9   fault.
10             Counsel talked about what he does with his
11   kids when there is something wrong, what he asks
12   them.  When my boys do something wrong, I ask them
13   what they should to, and I hope they take
14   responsibility for what they have done wrong and
15   told me what happened. 16             The question of Mr. Buonomo's
17   responsibility in this case has been an interesting
18   one.  In phase one, counsel said Matthew Buonomo
19   takes responsibility for the decisions he made and
20   you will assign fault to him.  That is not in phase
21   one.  That's phase two.
22             They said we accept that Matthew has some
23   fault here, you are going to hear about that.  But
24   we never heard it from any of the witnesses.  We
25   only heard it from the attorneys.  In fact, Mrs.

 1   Buonomo denied any fault.
 2             So when the attorneys tell you you are
 3   going to hear about it in this case, the only two
 4   people you heard it from were the two attorneys.
 5             I asked Mrs. Buonomo pointblank this
 6   question yesterday.
 7             "Question:  Do you believe your husband
 8   shares any responsibility for his illness?
 9             "Answer:  No.
10             "Question:  Do you believe he is partially
11   at fault for having smoked for so many years?
12             "Answer:  Not as a child.  I don't think
13   at that age you know what you are doing.
14             "Question:  What about as an adult?
15             "Answer:  By this time he was addicted.
16             "Question:  So he doesn't share
17   responsibility for that?
18             "Answer:  I don't believe he does.
19             The plaintiff doesn't think her husband
20   should share any responsibility, not even one
21   percent for his decision to start smoking, for his
22   decision to smoke Camel, for his decision to switch
23   to Salem, for his decision to smoke.  Not one
24   percent for anything.
25             In closing argument, her attorney says he

 1   is at fault.  These are lawyer games.  The judge is
 2   going to tell you that Mr. Buonomo is negligent in
 3   this case and does bear some responsibility, and
 4   despite the plaintiff's claim he doesn't.  He does.
 5             Personal responsibility is an important
 6   concept.
 7             MR. UUSTAL:  Judge, I object to that.
 8             THE COURT:  Sustained.
 9             I'll instruct you because the plaintiff's
10   lawyers agreed to the instruction that Mr. Buonomo
11   accepts responsibility, and you will decide how
12   much.
13             MR. GEISE:  Thank you.
14             Personal responsibility is an important
15   concept.  Here Mr. Buonomo should bear
16   responsibility for the choices he made.  He was
17   aware of the method to quit, but he didn't try to 18   quit.  He smoked with knowledge of the health risks
19   from the newspapers, from the magazines, from his
20   own family.
21             Saying someone is addicted doesn't excuse
22   responsibility.  The fact that quitting may be
23   difficult, a fact that has never been disputed by
24   Reynolds and has been known by the public, doesn't
25   excuse responsibility.

 1             With the ability to quit comes the
 2   responsibility to take action, and Mr. Buonomo was
 3   no different.  And no one is criticizing his
 4   choices.  No one.  Certainly not Reynolds would
 5   begrudge him from smoking.  It is a legal decision.
 6   It is legal to sell, and it is legal to smoke.
 7             People are free to choose to take risks
 8   and free to make their own choices.  Smokers are
 9   well aware of those risks, including smokers like
10   Mr. Buonomo.  When you make your choices and the
11   choices have risks, you bear the responsibility for
12   your choices.
13             While Mrs. Buonomo doesn't agree that Mr.
14   Buonomo should bear any responsibility, ask yourself
15   who was in the best position to avoid Mr. Buonomo's
16   fate.  If we look at a number of things, he was in
17   control of his choice to start smoking.  We don't
18   know why he did, but that was something he was in
19   control of.  No one forced him to continue smoking
20   despite the warnings.  No one forced him to continue
21   to smoke despite the widespread public information.
22             He continued to smoke despite the pleas of
23   his family and then he eventually quit.  There is
24   evidence in the case that some of the things Mrs.
25   Buonomo did had an influence on Mr. Buonomo.  She

 1   sent him Camels because of her preference for the
 2   smell.
 3             So the fact you concluded in phase one
 4   that Mr. Buonomo was addicted cloaks him in class
 5   membership, but it does not strip him of personal
 6   responsibilities.  I submit Mr. Buonomo should bare
 7   the greatest responsibility for his smoking decision
 8   and his failure to stop.  I submit he should bear
 9   the greatest responsibility for fault in this case.
10   That simply acknowledges that the personal
11   responsibilities we bear for our choices.
12             In voir dire some folks talked about fast
13   food or alcohol or the Cheese Cake Factory.  We
14   engage in those activities knowing sometime it is
15   not the best choice for us.  If we continue to make
16   those choices, our health could be impacted.  If it
17   is, we are responsible for those choices.
18   Personally responsible.
19             Let me discuss Reynolds' responsibility. 20             Earlier I discussed the view plaintiff
21   can't construct that but-for causation bridge
22   between the findings and Mr. Buonomo.  I pointed out
23   the lack of evidence that Mr. Buonomo never relied
24   on something that Reynolds said or didn't say.  I
25   explained the plaintiff I didn't think proved a

 1   specific defect in Reynolds cigarettes compared to
 2   other cigarettes.
 3             THE CLERK:  Twenty minutes counselor.
 4             THE COURT:  If you decide one of questions
 5   is yes and say an unidentified defect is the cause
 6   in this case, it would be reasonable for you to
 7   assign some responsibility to Reynolds.  The
 8   question is how much.
 9             Since the plaintiff hasn't identified
10   something Mr. Buonomo did in reliance, in response
11   to something Reynolds said, the theory is
12   essentially Reynolds should be held responsible for
13   selling cigarettes.
14             For three decades those cigarettes had
15   warning labels on them when Mr. Buonomo smoked them.
16   Over the same period of time -- And I'm talk about
17   this in a minute with respect to punitive damages.
18   But you heard Reynolds was working with the NCI and
19   the Tobacco Working Group.
20             If you conclude the plaintiff met her
21   burden on the design defect causation, Reynolds will
22   accept responsibility for that, but compared to Mr.
23   Buonomo, I think our responsibility should be much
24   smaller.
25             The third issue they have to connect is

 1   the damages.  There are two kind of damages,
 2   compensatory and punitive.  Compensatory damages are
 3   like the name implies, to compensate the plaintiff
 4   for injury or for loss.  You consider what the
 5   plaintiff lost and you compensate that person for
 6   that loss.  In your determination of compensatory
 7   damages, fully compensates the plaintiff for that
 8   lose.
 9             One thing I think we can agree on in
10   trying to determine an amount here are the medical
11   bills.  They are in evidence.  It is $400,000.  That
12   is an easy number to put out there.  But the next
13   step isn't as concrete.  They ask you to look at the
14   loss of companionship to a wife who lost a husband
15   for a number of years, and that is obviously a
16   difficult decision.
17             Mr. Buonomo died when he was 80.  Most of
18   us would love to have our loved ones live to the age
19   of 80.
20             In some situations, if someone dies, you
21   can look at how many more years would they have 22   worked, and what were they earning per year.  You
23   can figure out what they earned each year and add
24   that up and try to have some concrete number to
25   determine compensatory damages.  That type of

 1   calculation doesn't work here.
 2             What you need to do is to determine what
 3   is fair, reasonable, and what is just.  Plaintiff's
 4   counsel has a much different view on that than I do.
 5   They went through the different parameters depending
 6   on which way you go on the version form.
 7             By my calculation, the compensatory
 8   damages are anywhere between $7 million dollars and
 9   $12 million dollars.  For anyone, that is a huge sum
10   of money, an enormous amount of money.  It is to me.
11   It is to my client.  It is to Mrs. Buonomo.  I'm
12   sure it is to each of you.
13             Out of the 50 million living or current
14   smokers, on compensatory damages alone, the
15   plaintiffs ask you to make Mrs. Buonomo one of the
16   richest people in Fort Lauderdale, in Florida, or
17   even the country on compensatory damages alone.  Is
18   that fair?  Is that reasonable?  Is that just?  I
19   don't think so.
20             In determining the loss of damages for
21   someone who has died, the cause of that person's
22   death doesn't impact the loss.  But if somebody dies
23   in a car accident as counsel said, or dies from
24   natural diseases or disease, or dies from any other
25   injury, the loss is the same.  The amount of that

 1   loss doesn't depend on what caused the loss.  And I
 2   suggest that plaintiff's counsel asking for $7 to
 3   $12 million dollars in compensatory which is beyond
 4   what I think is a normal amount of money simply
 5   because this is a case against a tobacco company.
 6   But it is not fair, just and reasonable for the
 7   loss, but it has something to do with who is on the
 8   other side.
 9             Based on the evidence -- And this is hard
10   to do.  I'm not a plaintiff's attorney.  I don't
11   typically try to assign values to compensatory
12   damages.  I would say a fair and reasonable number
13   is $250,000.
14             Plaintiff's talked about a life expectancy
15   table.  If somebody is 80 years old now or in 2008,
16   they will live another seven or eight years.  There
17   was also on the table someone born in 1928 would
18   live 57 years.  I don't want to get hung up on life
19   expectancy.  Let's say it is ten more years.  The
20   reason I got to $250,000 is $25,000 a year for those
21   ten years.  That adds up to $250,000.
22             Now, I know that is a far cry from $12
23   million dollars.  But a quarter of a million dollars 24   is an awful lot of money.  How long does it take the
25   average Floridian to work hard every day and earn a

 1   quarter of a million dollars.  Combined with the
 2   medical bills, the total is $650,000, over a half a
 3   million dollars.  That is significant.  Compensatory
 4   damages are not a windfall.  Compensatory damages
 5   are not a lie.  Compensatory damages are supposed to
 6   fully compensate.  I suggest $650,000 if you get to
 7   that point would fully compensate.
 8             Finally I need to turn to punitive
 9   damages.  This is atopic that really focuses only on
10   money.  As you heard, punitive damages are supposed
11   to serve two purposes, deterrent and punishment.
12   But you only get to punitive damages if you find on
13   the verdict form that Mr. Buonomo relied on
14   statements.
15             They have to demonstrate that alliance and
16   then show a little more, that it was Reynolds'
17   reckless disregard or conscious indifference or
18   intentional violation of his rights.  So it is
19   reliance plus.
20             If you get to punitive damages, the
21   standard on the burden of proof is more than the
22   greater weight of the evidence.  It is clear and
23   convincing.  You have to find these acts clear and
24   convincing.
25             I'm not going to repeat the arguments I

 1   made on the lack of reliance and the lack of
 2   reasonable reliance.  If you agree with me on those,
 3   we don't get to the issue of punitive damages.  But
 4   let's assume we get there.  Let's talk about
 5   deterrence.  The question is do you believe there is
 6   a need to deter Reynolds in the future?
 7             Most of the plaintiff's argument is based
 8   on the alleged concealment of company documents.
 9   That can never happen again.  Since 1990, Reynolds
10   documents have been publicly available.  Dr.
11   Cummings told you there are 60 million documents on
12   the Internet website.  Dr. Cummings had 16 million
13   of them himself.  The documents are public for
14   everyone to look at.  There can no longer be an
15   argument something is concealed.
16             There is also no need to deter Reynolds
17   from making public statements about smoking and
18   diseases and smoking and addiction.  It is not about
19   whether smoking can be addictive.  It can be.
20   Reynolds admits that.  Dr. Cummings told you that
21   they have admitted that since 2000.  Again, Reynolds
22   has made that change.  There is no reason to deter
23   them on that ground.
24             Many of the people and organizations you
25   heard about in this trial no longer exist, TI, TIRC, 2727
 1   CTR.  Out of business in 1998.  The people who wrote
 2   many of the documents no longer work at Reynolds.
 3   Claude Teague, Frank Colby, Murray Senkus, they are
 4   gone.  There is no basis or way to deter these
 5   people.  They are gone.
 6             Dr. Cummings likes to tell you that
 7   Reynolds is the same company it was back the '40s
 8   and back the '50s, but then he tells you his
 9   experience with Reynolds that tells you that is not
10   the case.  He admitted that Reynolds spent over $1
11   billion dollars to develop Premier and Elipse.
12   $1 billion.
13             Counsel talks about net income and all of
14   that.  Reynolds took $1 billion dollars and put it
15   towards trying to develop a safer cigarette, a
16   cigarette that heated instead of burning tobacco, a
17   cigarette they consulted with Dr. Cummings on.  They
18   had him come down to Wiston-Salem to involve him in
19   the process.
20             And Dr. Cummings said they didn't change?
21   What did Dr. Cummings say about the cigarettes they
22   eventually produced out of this?  You have
23   testified, haven't you, sir, that both Elipse and
24   Premier are safer cigarettes?  Yes, safer than
25   conventional.

 1             You'll hear Premier was a flop.  It didn't
 2   go overwhelm.  And the public health community
 3   immediately attack it -- Actually they didn't
 4   immediately attack it.  They attacked it before it
 5   came out.  That didn't change Reynolds' idea.  They
 6   went and tried to develop Eclipse.  They tried to do
 7   it a little better.
 8             Dedicating over $1 billion dollars to
 9   develop a safer cigarette is not conscious
10   indifference.  It is just the opposite.  This is not
11   the first time that Reynolds has worked on trying to
12   develop a safer cigarette.  Reynolds worked with the
13   public health community for a decade.  Dr. Cummings
14   told you about the National Cancer Institute Tobacco
15   Working Group.
16             This is what he said about it.  This is an
17   organization of scientists as well as industry reps.
18   They did a variety of studies, different ones on
19   tobacco, on filter efficiency, high and low nicotine
20   products to see if they could reduce the harm
21   associated with smoking.
22             Two Reynolds scientists participated in
23   it, Dr. Rodgman who Dr. Cummings told you is an
24   excellent scientist, and Dr. Senkus.  You saw the
25   thank you notes they got from the government when

 1   that work as completed asking them to stay involved.  2             Reynolds did not have to participate in
 3   that program.  They volunteered to do it.  If they
 4   were acting with reckless disregard, they would have
 5   said forget it.  But they didn't.  The suggestions,
 6   the writings, the documents you saw are from decades
 7   in the past.  They are not part of Reynolds today,
 8   and they won't be part of Reynolds tomorrow.  If
 9   there was a need for deterrence, that need has since
10   passed.
11             Now I got to talk about the money part,
12   the punishment part of punitive damage.  You'll be
13   instructed along these lines.  Again, pay attention
14   to the instruction.  But you will be told that
15   punitive damage cannot be used to punish for conduct
16   that did not harm Mr. Buonomo, and it cannot be used
17   to punish for harms outside the state of Florida.
18             Even on punitive damage, each on the
19   amount, there has to be a link between Reynolds'
20   conduct and Mr. Buonomo.  Punitive damage, folks,
21   are simply about how much more money the plaintiff
22   wants.  Even though I submit there is no
23   justification for punitive damage based on the facts
24   in this case, I need to address the plaintiff's
25   request.

 1             The plaintiff suggested $62 million.  That
 2   is a staggering number.  Plaintiff's counsel tried
 3   to gouge it in, how Reynolds runs its business or
 4   what Reynolds makes out of its operations and sale
 5   of cigarettes.  I don't think that is an appropriate
 6   gauge for determining punitive damage.
 7             Cigarettes are a lawful product, legal to
 8   make, legal to sell.  Reynolds' profit and income
 9   are derived from engaging in that legal operation.
10   It is not a basis to punish them.  The simple act of
11   making money from selling a legal product that may
12   have harmed is not justified.  It is not a Reynolds,
13   not a McDonalds, not a Budweiser, not any company
14   who sells a product that is legal but is not without
15   risk.
16             As I mentioned, compensatory damages are
17   meant to compensate the plaintiff for her injuries.
18   That determination fully compensates the plaintiff
19   for her loss.  So if you deliberate and decide to
20   award compensatory damages, that is the amount you
21   have determined makes the plaintiff whole.
22             Punitive damages, however, are unlike
23   compensatory damages.  They have nothing to do with
24   compensating the plaintiff for her loss.  They are
25   an award of cash over and above what you would have

 1   determined compensates her.  So every dollar you
 2   award in punitive damages is a dollar over and above
 3   what you had determined fully compensated the  4   plaintiff.  In this case, plaintiff's counsel wants
 5   you to award $62 million over and above.
 6             One thing to keep in mind is who receives
 7   your award of punitive damage.  It doesn't go to the
 8   American Cancer Society.  It doesn't go to a
 9   hospital.  It don't go to Dr. Cummings for research.
10   It goes to the plaintiff and the plaintiff alone.
11             Given that punitive damages go directly to
12   the plaintiff, I have to I guess try to suggest an
13   amount that would be more reasonable than $62
14   million dollars.
15             While I do not think punitive damage are
16   justified in this case, using my moot and a PROIchD
17   from before I would suggest another $250,000 like we
18   talked about in compensatory damages would be
19   appropriate.
20             THE CLERK:  Five minutes, Counselor.
21             MR. GEISE:  Thank you.
22             Why would I suggest that?  It would
23   basically give the plaintiff one hundred percent
24   over and above what that compensatory damage amount
25   would be.

 1             Again, I submit you should not get to
 2   punitive damage.  But I think if you do, another
 3   quarter of a million dollars is a reasonable amount.
 4             Plaintiff's counsel may get up here and
 5   use a speeding ticket analogy to say what I'm
 6   suggesting is a drop in the bucket.  I disagree.  If
 7   you add up what I suggested for compensatory and
 8   punitive damages, if you find liability and you find
 9   the entitlement to punitives, it adds up to almost
10   $1 million.  For any person, that is a lot of money.
11   If it is a drop in the bucket, I would love to have
12   that drop in the bucket.  It is a lot of money.
13             Reasonable compensation in a lawsuit
14   doesn't mean having to make someone an instant
15   multimillionaire, especially someone who seeks to
16   recover from the choice someone else made.
17             What the plaintiff would have you
18   knowledge is reasonable, compensatory and punitive
19   damages are over $70 million dollars, an amount that
20   would overnight make Mrs. Buonomo one of the richest
21   people in Broward County and in the entire
22   southeast.  I say that is unreasonable.
23             Moreover, I want to remind you of one more
24   thing.  Mr. Buonomo was one of thousands of smokers
25   who are part of this class that you determined in

 1   phase one.  Judge Streitfeld I believe will instruct
 2   you on that along the lines that follow:  Other
 3   individuals who have been harmed can bring their own
 4   suits and seek compensatory and punitive damages in
 5   their own right.  That means thousands of other  6   Floridians can come into the courtroom and have the
 7   same day in court Mrs. Buonomo had.  They can seek
 8   compensatory damages and punitive damages, too.
 9   They can try to build the same bridge that Mrs.
10   Buonomo has to build.  I ask you to consider that
11   when you deliberate.  When you do, I believe you
12   will find another quarter of a million dollars in
13   punitive damages is a reasonable amount to award one
14   plaintiff in one case.
15             I'm almost out of time.  Before I sit
16   down, I want to remind you of a couple things.  One,
17   unlike all other parts of the trial, the plaintiff
18   goes and I go and I'm done, and the plaintiff goes
19   last here.  The plaintiff has the final word.  So
20   I'm sure in the next 20 minutes or so there are
21   going to be things I would like to stand up and
22   object to or have had a chance to respond to, but I
23   don't get that chance.  This is it for me.  This is
24   the last chance I get to address you.
25             When counsel talks to you, I want you to

 1   keep a couple questions in mind.  Did anything
 2   Reynolds said or didn't say, did or didn't do, have
 3   an impact, a direct link, to Mr. Buonomo?  And if
 4   the claim is that it did, what is the proof?  We
 5   know it wasn't advertising.  We saw the testimony.
 6   We know it wasn't statements.  We saw the testimony.
 7   We know why he made his decisions.  We know where
 8   there is a link and where there isn't a link.  Keep
 9   that in mind.
10             I know you have worked hard and paid
11   attention for three weeks.  You have taken great
12   notes and asked probing questions.  I can't tell you
13   how many times we get a question out and we would
14   think to ourself I wish I asked that.
15             When you go back to deliberate this
16   afternoon, trust your judgment.  Have courage in
17   each of your convictions.  Each of you are very
18   important to this process.  You have your own views
19   and you worked hard.  Don't be afraid to express
20   them.
21             Finally, the judge will instruct you your
22   verdict has to be based on the law and the evidence,
23   not on sympathy or emotion.
24             I thank you once again.  It has been my
25   great privilege to stand before you over the last

 1   three weeks.  It is an appearance I will not forget.
 2   I hope I have the opportunity to run into you
 3   sometime outside of the courthouse and actually get
 4   to speak with you.
 5             Thank you.
