12             MR. UUSTAL:  Thank you, Your Honor.
13             Good morning -- No.  Good afternoon.
14             Thank you for your attention and your
15   patience.  After many years, here we are.  This
16   lawsuit, this litigation started in a different
17   time.  And I'm not talking about the 1950s, 1940s,
18   1930s when Matt first began smoking.  This lawsuit
19   started in a different time.  The Engle trial was
20   during a time when the tobacco companies denied that
21   smoking was addictive or that it caused illness.
22             After a yearlong trial, the jury in Engle
23   said no, smoking is addictive, it does cause
24   disease.  That is the power of the jury in this
25   country, and that is your power now because you have

 1   been selected to finish the work that they started.
 2   For Connie, today, or maybe tomorrow, is the finish
 3   line of a very, very long process.
 4             I am standing here talking to you about
 5   what seems to me to be the most important things I
 6   have ever said in my life.  I have the sense my
 7   whole career, my whole life has been leading up to
 8   this moment with you.  I'm proud to be here with
 9   you, and also a little scared because what we are
10   doing is important.
11             R.J. Reynolds designed their cigarettes to
12   be as addictive as possible.  They didn't even have
13   to be addictive because they had the ability to take
14   the nicotine out.  But it didn't stop there.  They
15   made specific design choices always to maximize the
16   addictiveness of their product while targeting
17   children, sending people to schools knowing that
18   this was a deadly and addictive drug.  And they
19   still make those cigarettes the same way.  They
20   don't have to, but they do. 21             You will be asked in this case whether RJR
22   deserves to be punished or not.  That is your
23   decision.  As you hear what I talk about and what
24   RJR's lawyers talk about, one of the things you'll
25   need to think of is if a punishment is appropriate,

 1   what kind of punishment is appropriate for a company
 2   like this.  If you or I run a red light and get a
 3   $80 fine, it makes us want to stop running red
 4   lights.  But $80 would not be noticed by RJR.
 5   $80,000 would not be noticed by them.  Even
 6   $80 million would not have an affect on the company.
 7             We rushed through this yesterday because
 8   people had to go, but it was critically, critically
 9   important.  Let me just bring you back to that.
10             The net worth of this company is
11   $7.9 billion.  That is what the company is worth,
12   essentially $8 billion.  An even more interesting
13   number I think is that the net earnings for the last
14   year that we have reliable figures was $1.338
15   billion dollars.
16             What are net earnings?  Revenue minus
17   every single expense, the cost of goods sold, all
18   the overhead, payroll taxes, interest.  Every single
19   expense of the company, these items are deducted out
20   so you have revenue minus all the expenses.  What is
21   left is the bottom line.
22             For this company, after everything is
23   paid, salaries, taxes, cost of building the product,
24   CEO bonuses, private jets, whatever it is, any cost,
25   all of that, after it is paid, about $1.3 billion a

 1   year in extra excess cash they can send up to their
 2   parent company.
 3             MR. GEISE:  Objection, Your Honor.
 4             THE COURT:  Overruled.
 5             MR. UUSTAL:  $3.5 million dollars a day.
 6   $3.5 million dollars a day.
 7             In one sense, what we do in this courtroom
 8   doesn't matter.  I mean did you notice there is
 9   nobody at that table that works for R.J. Reynolds?
10   There is nobody who testified who works for R.J.
11   Reynolds.  They are not in this courtroom.  They
12   didn't bother to show up because with numbers like
13   that, they suspect I think whatever we do won't
14   matter to them.
15             I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself.
16   Let me start at the beginning.
17             We know that Matt Buonomo started smoking
18   at 13 years of age.  This picture was taken when he
19   was 16 or 17.  We don't know exactly.  That is him
20   and his baseball team.  All of them are smoking.
21             During this time period when he was this
22   age and younger, for R.J. Reynolds, school time 23   means big tobacco business for somebody.  Let's get
24   it.  Let's start right now.  List of schools,
25   colleges, universities, prep schools, high schools.

 1   They sent people to those schools.  Not to mention
 2   the heros of that time period.  All smoking.
 3             These are just a couple of ads.  But this
 4   was everywhere, every day.  Everywhere.  Heros.
 5   Athletes.  They won't get your wind.  They are safe.
 6   Everywhere they looked, they targeted him.  They
 7   were stalking him.  As you have seen in the other
 8   documents, children are the lifeblood of their
 9   business because adults don't chose to smoke.
10   People don't start smoking at 25 to 30.  It is very,
11   very, very rare.  They need to get people addicted
12   when they are children, and that is exactly what
13   they sought to do even though they knew it was a
14   deadly and addictive drug.
15             When he was in Korea.  Free cigarettes for
16   the troops in World War II in Korea.  They
17   advertised about it.  Bragged about it.  At the time
18   it was accepted.  It wasn't seen as something bad
19   that they were sending free cigarettes over there.
20   More doctors smoke Camel ads.
21             The more doctors smoke Camel, that
22   appeared in hundreds of different variety of ads.
23   Television ads, he saw two.  But also in what looked
24   to be articles -- They weren't -- they were ads, but
25   they looked to be articles.  Dr. Martinez, their

 1   historian found all their articles.  He didn't come
 2   across those.
 3             You have seen their documents.  You know
 4   from this time period they had identified specific
 5   carcinogens in tobacco smoke that cause cancer and
 6   other diseases.  They were up to date on all of the
 7   current scientific findings.
 8             I just don't understand how they can say
 9   that any schoolboy in the 1930s knew but their
10   scientists were baffled.  The best scientists the
11   tobacco companies had, we didn't know, and at the
12   same time every schoolboy supposedly knew.
13             When the first public attention started to
14   be focusing that there may be a danger, they got
15   together and they made a plan.  It was a conspiracy
16   because it was with the intent to commit fraud.  And
17   we know now what their plan was.
18             When they published this statement in
19   newspapers across the country, An Honest Statement
20   to Cigarette Smokers, when they told smokers that
21   medical research indicates many possible causes of
22   lung cancer, that there is no agreement among the
23   authorities regarding what the cause is, that there
24   is no proof that cigarette smoking is one of the 25   causes, when they published that, days after they

 1   had met and formed their conspiracy, they knew it
 2   wasn't true.
 3             We have some of the documents from the
 4   early first days around that Christmas of the
 5   conspiracy.  Not from the tobacco company.  But
 6   remember they hired a public relations firm.  The
 7   most brilliant public relations firm in the country,
 8   and especially John Hill who founded it.  You heard
 9   about him.  His private papers when he died were
10   sent to a university, and we have some of them.  We
11   know what their plan was.
12             When you see what they did, think about is
13   this consistent with their plan because everything
14   you heard fits the same exact theme they were saying
15   in the first few days about what they were going to
16   do.
17             Convince people that no one who has been a
18   heavy smoker is going to benefit himself now by
19   falling into a panic and eliminating the pleasure
20   that comes from cigarettes.  They may just as well
21   have gone on enjoying to smoke in this interim while
22   research pursues the fact with full an insurance if
23   any cancer causing agents are ever really found in
24   tobacco, the manufacturers will quickly find a way
25   to eliminate it.  That is what they said they were

 1   going to do.  You heart lots and lots of ways as
 2   they did that.
 3             They talked about what are we going to do
 4   about the people who are trying the get the truth
 5   out about the harm of cigarettes.  Well, we have
 6   options.  Smearing and belittling them?  We saw them
 7   do that.  Try to overwhelm them with mass
 8   publications of the opposed viewpoints, debating
 9   them in the public arena?  They did that.  And
10   raising the issue far above them so they are hardly
11   even mentioned so that we can make a real case.
12   That is what they did most brilliantly of all.
13             When you saw an actor smoking a cigarette
14   in a movie, when they put their product placement of
15   cigarettes in television shows, it wasn't a logical
16   appeal.  It was their real message which is if this
17   guy is doing it, it must be safe.  If this guy is
18   doing it, you should, too.
19             Because it is true that there was
20   knowledge that cigarettes -- Their people were
21   hearing there could be a problem with cigarettes
22   going back to the '50s, and gradually it was more
23   and more and more.  They couldn't stop that.  But
24   what they could do was change how people looked at
25   it, especially people who were addicted to nicotine.
2657  1   So they said we have one essential Joe.  To convince
 2   the smokers his chances of getting lung cancer are
 3   too infinitesimal to worry about it at all.  The
 4   average man is more likely to die in an automobile
 5   accident.  So let the scientists do the worrying for
 6   us.  That is their business.  In the meanwhile, let
 7   us go on eating, working, playing, smoking, relaxing
 8   and reading in automobiles and living a good life
 9   every day.  Just convince him the risk is small,
10   infinitesimal.
11             Sure, maybe it does cause a disease, but
12   the risks so small.  Are you going to give up
13   driving because you might get in a car accident?  Of
14   course not.  You don't have to give up smoking.
15             I showed you a couple very short videos of
16   them doing exactly what they said they were going to
17   do.
18             Can we see clip one, please?
19             (Video clip published)
20             "Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to
21   your health.  It may not be.  We just don't know.  I
22   don't know.  Frankly, I think smoking may be
23   hazardous.  It may not be.
24             Smoking may be hazardous.  It may not be.
25   No one, including TV-7, knows for certain.  It may

 1   be or it may not be.  We don't know.  I don't know
 2   if cigarettes are bad or not bad.  We don't know
 3   what causes the ailments that have been attributed
 4   to cigarette smoking.
 5             I'm saying the science to date and over
 6   $100 million of our industry indicates there is no
 7   causal link.  I'm not denying the fact cigarette
 8   smoking could be a risk factor involved with some
 9   people.  You know, who knows?  The rabbit runs
10   through the briar patch, it is pretty hard to look
11   back and see which briar stuck him.  The jury has
12   not come in."
13             Specialist in the '60s, they were
14   constantly saying because they knew what worked, if
15   there is ever anything identified as bad, don't
16   worry about it, we will take it out.  You don't have
17   to quit today because tomorrow if we find something
18   bad, we will take it out and you can keep on
19   smoking.
20             Timothy Hartnett, former president of a
21   major tobacco firm and chairman of the Industry
22   Research Committee.
23             Mr. Mauro, I would like to quote from a
24   statement released at the time the Tobacco Research
25   Committee was formed.  At that time, we stated we

 1   accept an interest in people's health as a basic
 2   responsibility paramount to every other  3   consideration in our business.  And that's where we
 4   stand today.
 5             If there be anything in a cigarette that
 6   is harmful, there is no doubt in my mind that thing
 7   can be discovered by doctors, by research people,
 8   and that the tobacco industry will eliminate it.  If
 9   there is something in tobacco or the smoke that is
10   the causative factor, that can be remedied because
11   when and if any ingredient in cigarette smoke is
12   identified as being injurious to human health, we
13   are confident we can eliminate that."
14             I don't want to go through all the
15   evidence with you.  You were here.  You saw it.  I
16   just want to draw this clear connection.  This is
17   what they said they were going to do.  It is no
18   coincidence these people were using the same
19   language.  It was exactly part of the plan they came
20   to when they formed the conspiracy.  And it worked.
21             The government did surveys.  1981, FTC
22   report.  A couple things I want to read to you.
23   First of all, cigarettes are the most heavily
24   advertised product in America, $1 billion dollars a
25   year.  If you see an article here or a pamphlet

 1   here, it is tiny in terms of the amount of attention
 2   that you have compared to a billion dollars a year
 3   in cigarette advertising.  That is in 1981 dollars.
 4   They spent more on advertising cigarettes in one day
 5   than the government's primary agency working in this
 6   area spent in one year.  So it is not close.  The
 7   messages people were receiving was far, far more
 8   that smoking is safe.
 9             The government looked at what the ads were
10   saying.  Two things predominated, the portrayals of
11   the desirability of smoking, and the assurances
12   about the safety of cigarettes.  That is what they
13   were telling people.
14             They did a thorough analysis of what
15   people thought.  This is in 1981.  A substantial
16   portion -- This is analysis of all the data reviewed
17   in its entirety.  And all of these by the way are in
18   evidence, and you will have them if you want to look
19   at them.
20             A substantial portion of the population
21   does not know how dangerous smoking is or whether
22   the dangers of smoking applies to them and,
23   therefore, does not have an understanding of the
24   health hazards of smoking.
25             Why?  Why?  Because the plan was working.

 1             It has been 17 years they said since the
 2   surgeon general first determined that cigarette
 3   smoking was hazardous to health.  For 15 years,
 4   warnings of that kind appeared on cigarette  5   packages.  Yet there are approximately 54 million
 6   smokers in the country, and the data suggests that
 7   millions of Americans who smoke still do not know
 8   that smoking is harmful to health.
 9             Why?  They said they were going to do it.
10   They came to a plan, and it worked.  That is why
11   millions of Americans didn't know.
12             So we have the plan.  We have all the
13   things they did with the plan.  Then we have the
14   government study showing that it worked.
15             The tobacco people themselves,
16   Exhibit 106, said our plan is working.  This was in
17   1972.  For 20 years the industry has employed a
18   single strategy brilliantly conceived and executed.
19             We have one more battle.  They said it is
20   working.  It was never intended to be a vehicle for
21   victory.  It has always been a holding strategy to
22   create doubt.
23             This makes me mad.  They knew they could
24   never in the end win and convince people that
25   smoking was safe.  One day the truth would get out.

 1   But they said we are going to hold.  We have a
 2   holding strategy of delay, create confusion, create
 3   doubt.  Every day they were holding, the people were
 4   crossing the line, the line after which they would
 5   get emphysema or lung cancer.  Every day they held,
 6   people died.  Time mattered.  That delay of 20 or
 7   30 years mattered to millions of people.
 8             The cigarette companies knew better then
 9   anyone else that with an addictive product like
10   their cigarettes, the best way to convince someone
11   to smoke, the best chance someone had of quitting
12   smoking was a clear and present danger.  The highest
13   motivation was a clear and present danger.
14             There were opportunities over all those
15   years the cigarette companies could have used or at
16   least let the health officials use to get people to
17   quit smoking.
18             When the first mouse painting study came
19   out showing cancer, the 1646 surgeon general's
20   report, the warning labels first went on cigarettes.
21   Every one of those was an opportunity to create that
22   clear and present danger for smokers.  But the
23   tobacco companies viewed those opportunities not as
24   opportunities to educate or opportunities to save
25   lives or lease but an opportunity for them the stand

 1   out of the way.  They viewed those as deadly threats
 2   to their business, and they cared more about their
 3   business than their customers.  So they made the
 4   risk appear wishy-washy and far off.
 5             To an addicted smoker, if the risk is
 6   small, that is an excuse to keep smoking.  And they  7   knew it.  And that is what they did.  You don't have
 8   to quit today.  You can always quit tomorrow.  If
 9   there is anything bad, we will tell you about it.
10   Right now there is not.  There is certainly no
11   proof.
12             And if you would just switch to filters.
13   Filters, that is the biggest scam of all.  Because
14   for people who were worried about their health, who
15   heard things that it might be dangerous, and decided
16   to try to quit but were having trouble, they said
17   just switch to filters.
18             A filters are clear.  You heard from Dr.
19   Cummings when the filter is made it is clear.  It is
20   not white.  They paint it white.  They paint it
21   white so when you smoke you see it turn yellow and
22   you think it is working.  They knew it wasn't.  But
23   here was an excuse.  And while that excuse worked
24   for millions of people, they crossed the line.  They
25   got their diseases, and many of them died.

 1             Let's look at the version form you got to
 2   fill out because it is more complicated than the
 3   first one.  It is in three sections, this version
 4   form.  You are going to fill out only two.  The
 5   first question will decide whether you fill out A or
 6   B.
 7             The first question is simply did his COPD
 8   cause his death.  Because technically the question
 9   you answered in phase one was simply did he have
10   COPD caused by cigarette smoking.  So this is a
11   slightly different question.  Did it cause his
12   death.  I'm not going to go through all of that
13   evidence.  Again, the death certificate and the
14   medical record is there.  I think the answer is
15   clearly yes.  But depending on what you decide, you
16   fill out it because if it killed him, it is a
17   wrongful death case and you fill out a wrongful
18   death version form.  If it didn't, it just caused
19   COPD which injured him and something else killed
20   him, whether it was a car accident or congestive
21   heart failure, whatever it was, it was a different
22   cause, then there is a different set of questions
23   you have to answer.  So I believe the answer to that
24   is yes.  You have all the evidence.
25             Assume you answer yes, you will fill out

 1   version form A.  These are the first two questions
 2   in version form A.
 3             THE COURT:  Tough to read.
 4             MR. UUSTAL:  Thank you, Your Honor.
 5             THE COURT:  I think we are all going to
 6   the eye doctor after the case is over.
 7             MR. UUSTAL:  The Engle jury determined
 8   that R.J. Reynolds was negligent, and they  9   determined that the cigarettes that R.J. Reynolds
10   made were defective.  You have already determined
11   that Matthew Buonomo had COPD from smoking and from
12   his addiction.  And if you are answering these
13   questions, you have determined they caused his
14   death.  These two questions just tie everything
15   together.
16             Was the negligence that you heard about
17   and that the Engle jury found the cause of his
18   death?  All the different elements have been found.
19   This is where you tie them together.
20             With two, the same things, were the
21   defective cigarettes manufactured by R.J. Reynolds
22   Tobacco Company a legal cause of Matthew Buonomo's
23   death.  The answer to this is yes.
24             Let's talk about question three.  Did
25   Matthew Buonomo reasonably rely to his detriment on

 1   any statement made by R.J. Reynolds which concealed
 2   or omitted material information, and was that the
 3   legal cause of his death?
 4             The question here is reliance.  You heard
 5   from his wife that when she suggested to him that
 6   there was a problem with cigarettes that he said I'm
 7   smoking the safer cigarette, a safe cigarette, the
 8   one that doctors smoke.  He relied on those
 9   statements they made.  He showed Connie the filter
10   turning yellow.  He relied on that.
11             I just want to remind you of some of that
12   testimony.  When he tried to quit in 1980s, had he
13   heard all of these things about smoking being bad?
14   Yes.  But did he think that it was proven?  No.  It
15   was, but they were saying it wasn't proven.  The
16   only way he could have thought it wasn't proven is
17   if he relied on what they said.
18             I forget if it was Mr. Geise or Mr. Reid
19   who was asking her some questions.  He said well,
20   doctors are smoking.  He said there is no scientific
21   proof.  I'm smoking Camels.  That's a safe
22   cigarette.  Some are saying it is safe.  Some are
23   saying it is not.  Which, by the way, wasn't true.
24   Remember?  It was known to be harmful.  But he
25   relied on what they told him, and he thought it was

 1   a safe cigarette.
 2             The opinion witness, the historian hired
 3   by RJR, said The Tobacco Institute, part of
 4   conspiracy, would be on television routinely talking
 5   about a cigarette controversy.  Yes.  And he
 6   admitted that information reached Mr. Buonomo.
 7             I talked to Mr. Martinez about this a
 8   little bit.  The false -- Many people falsely
 9   believed -- I showed him a government document.
10   Many people falsely believed there was a 11   controversy.  He didn't know what I meant by that.
12   I meant it was false, and that is what the
13   government meant.  This was no controversy.  Anyone
14   who thought there was a controversy was relying on
15   statements made by the conspirators.  They created
16   The Tobacco Institute, a fake scientific
17   organization, in order to pretend there was a
18   controversy.
19             Let's go back to the version form.
20             Question four, did Matthew rely to his
21   detriment on an actor's act or statement made by
22   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company which concealed or
23   omitted material information, and whether such
24   reliance was a legal cause of his death.
25             Not only did he rely on the statements he

 1   made, but he relied on the acts of the conspiracy.
 2   Remember the one, two, three, four, the Engle jury
 3   already found they were negligent, that the
 4   cigarettes were defective, and that they engaged in
 5   a conspiracy when they fraudulently concealed the
 6   information.  You are just being asked were those
 7   things the cause of his smoking and his death.
 8             Fifth and sixth, was there intentional
 9   misconduct by RJR?  Six, was there gross negligence.
10   Intentional misconduct is lying.  Intentional
11   misconduct is making a cigarette more addictive.
12   And they didn't do those things by mistake.  We saw
13   in their own documents they knew cigarettes were
14   harmful in the '80s.  In 1990 is when they testified
15   before congress cigarettes were not dangerous, there
16   was no causal link, they knew it was a lie, and a
17   lie is intentional conduct.
18             This question in particular, number five,
19   is talking about the design of the cigarette.  They
20   intentionally -- And there is nobody.  They brought
21   in nobody to say this wasn't true.  Dr. Cummings
22   told you how they adjusted the paper, they picked
23   the porosity, the pH levels, the type of tobacco.
24   They actually take some of the nicotine out and put
25   nicotine back in, and they do it all precisely to

 1   engineer the cigarette for maximum addictiveness.
 2   That is intentional.  The nicotine doesn't come out
 3   by mistake and get put back in in the exact right
 4   measure to be addictive by mistake.  That is
 5   intentional.
 6             Six is gross negligence.  That is actually
 7   even a lower standard than intentional.  Negligence
 8   is you made a mistake.  Maybe you run a red light.
 9   Gross negligence is not something you intend but
10   maybe like drinking and driving.  They were grossly
11   negligent.  They did it intentionally.  That is even
12   a higher standard, so you are definitely going to 13   find in regard to the design of the cigarette gross
14   negligence.
15             The jury instructions you will have back
16   with you are fairly long.  But they will make clear
17   the definition of negligence, gross negligence, and
18   intentional misconduct.
19             I just want to show you two more video
20   clips on this issue of intent and gross negligence.
21   These also go to his reliance, what he relied on,
22   and the future questions you are going to answer
23   about whether they deserve to be punished.  This
24   conduct, all of it was intentional.
25             Can we see clip three, please?

 1             (Video clip published)
 2             "Do you believe nicotine is not addictive?
 3   I believe nicotine is not addictive.  Yes, sir.  Mr.
 4   Johnson.  Congressman, cigarettes and nicotine
 5   clearly do not meet the classic definitions of
 6   addiction.  There is no intoxication.
 7             We will take that as a no.
 8             I don't believe nicotine for our products
 9   are addictive.
10             I believe nicotine is not addictive.
11             I believe nicotine is not addictive.
12             I believe nicotine is not addictive.
13             And I, too, believe nicotine is not
14   addictive.
15             I'm saying the science to date and over
16   $100 million of our industry indicates there is no
17   causal link."
18             They knew that was untrue when they said
19   it.
20             Clip four, please.
21             (Video clip published)
22             "And I conclude from that report it is
23   true the babies borne from women who smoke are
24   smaller, but they are just as healthy as the babies
25   born to women who do not smoke.  And some women

 1   would prefer having smaller babies."
 2             Smaller babies are not just as healthy,
 3   and he knew that.
 4             The next question has to do with assigning
 5   fault.  You don't have to answer a question about
 6   whether Mr. Buonomo, whether Matt was at fault
 7   because we admit that.
 8             Connie, you heard her testify.  When she
 9   was asked that question, she said no, I don't think
10   he was at fault, I saw what he went through, they
11   got him addicted when he was a kid, and by the time
12   he found out the truth it was too late, and he had
13   to be half dead and hooked up to oxygen 24 hours day
14   to quit.  But he was alive when this suit was 15   brought.  She told you he felt that he had let his
16   family down by not being able to quit, so we are
17   admitting.  You will give some percentage of fault
18   to him.  The question is how much.
19             You have to weigh the intentional acts of
20   engineering a product to be addictive, of targeting
21   children like Matt for an addictive and deadly drug,
22   of lying to people about the dangers in order to
23   take away their motivation to quit, of tricking them
24   with filters.  You have to weigh that against the
25   decision of a 13-year-old to pick up a cigarette and

 1   then his difficulty in quitting.
 2             Should he have quit earlier?  Yes.  But
 3   why didn't he?  Because they were whispering in his
 4   ear every moment of his life you don't have to quit
 5   today, you got the filter, you will be fine.
 6             So you heard that 95 percent of smokers
 7   who try to quit relapse, and only five percent in a
 8   given year succeed.  They say he should have been
 9   one of those five percent earlier.  The maximum
10   then, the maximum fault that could be his, is five
11   percent.  He should have been in that five percent
12   category.
13             Well, 95 percent of the people don't
14   succeed, and many of them are not nearly as heavily
15   addicted as him.  And they don't succeed because of
16   actions and decisions they take.
17             It doesn't even seem right to me to come
18   in here and say you should have quit earlier, you
19   should have broken the addiction to our cigarettes
20   which we engineered to be difficult to quit.  You
21   should not have believed our lies.  You should not
22   have relied on the filter.  That is why you are at
23   fault.
24             I want to talk briefly about the
25   textbooks.  The only support those textbooks were

 1   ever seen by Matt that Dr. Martinez brought here was
 2   a 1903 document.  He wasn't even born until 1928 for
 3   textbooks used in the New Brunswick school system,
 4   and he didn't even go to those schools, and none of
 5   those textbooks are on the list.  I asked him what
 6   is your support that he saw these.  I don't have it
 7   with me.
 8             They showed you articles about the dangers
 9   of smoking.  Yes, there were articles.  The good
10   guys were trying to get the truth out.  But if we
11   had tried to bring you every moment in a movie or
12   television show, every advertisement he saw, every
13   article he saw about the controversy, it would fill
14   this courtroom.  It would fill this courthouse.  It
15   would fill 100 courthouses because it was a feature
16   of his life. 17             A billion dollars a year buys a lots of
18   influence.
19             You then will be asked to answer some
20   questions about compensating his family, and these
21   are elements that the law provides for compensation
22   when someone is killed wrongfully.
23             First of all, medical bills and funeral
24   expenses, we didn't talk about this to save time,
25   but it is in evidence.  You'll have it.  It is a

 1   summary of the medical bills and funeral expenses.
 2   It is $404,330.  $404,000.  That will be in there
 3   for you.  That question is simple.  There is no
 4   dispute.  There is no evidence against it.  It is
 5   $404,000.
 6             You will be asked the total amount of
 7   damages sustained by Connie for the loss of her
 8   husband.  This is really the only difference between
 9   the two version forms.
10             If you decide from that first question
11   that smoking was not a cause of his death, that the
12   negligence, the COPD didn't cause his death, then
13   you would answer a version form that is essentially
14   the same with a couple minor differences.
15             If you answered that one, you will decide
16   the compensation for Matthew himself because the way
17   the law looks at this, if you are injured -- Let's
18   take this out of a totally different context.  You
19   get in car accident and you get injured.  Somebody
20   else is at fault.  If that car accident kills you,
21   the law looks to the family to compensate you for
22   what was lost, not the person killed in the accident
23   because that person has died.  But if the person is
24   injured in the car accident but they survived and
25   for another reason unrelated they are killed, we

 1   still look at the injuries to the person himself.
 2             If you fill out this version form, you
 3   will be focused on Matt himself.  You will look at a
 4   variety of things that's you'll have to add up.  The
 5   medical expenses we have seen which were around
 6   $404,000.  These are all elements the law instructs
 7   you to look at in terms of compensating a person
 8   when they are injured.  Pain.  Suffering.
 9   Disability.  Physical impairment.  Disfigurement is
10   not really an issue in this case.  Mental anguish.
11   Inconvenience.  The loss of capacity for the
12   enjoyment of life.  All of these are significant,
13   and you have to look at each of them.
14             How to come up with a figure for that?  I
15   was trying to figure out some way to do that.  Their
16   lowest paid opinion witness got $225 an hour.  The
17   highest was $750 an hour.  And for them, as one of
18   them told you, it was fun. 19             Well, suffocating to death for 13 years is
20   not fun.  Nobody would take that job for $225 an
21   hour or $750 an hour.  But even if you were to look
22   at the amount of hours someone is awake in a year,
23   five to six thousand, even if you use $225 for their
24   lowest witness, you are talking about $1,125,000.
25   $1,125,000 per year for Matthew.  For 13 years from

 1   1995 to 2008 which is $7,280,000.  But I don't think
 2   you should be answering this version form.  The
 3   amount of money you will award to his family is less
 4   if you decide that COPD killed him.  That is the
 5   law.  But we are not going to come in here and tell
 6   you COPD didn't kill him because it did.
 7             Abraham Lincoln was a lawyer.  He said
 8   resolve to be honest.  And if you cannot be an
 9   honest lawyer, solve to be honest and not a lawyer.
10   A lawyer does not have to contest everything, and we
11   are not.  You should be filling out the other
12   version form.
13             You heard what happened to her for the
14   rest of her life starting in 1995.  He was
15   suffocating to death.  He was the one who was
16   trapped in the house who could never go anywhere by
17   himself again who could barely walk without turning
18   gray.  But she, all their dreams they worked so hard
19   for, saved all their lives, Italy, Oklahoma, all of
20   that was over.
21             One of their experts, one of them, Dr.
22   Martinez, the last one, he said 2000 hours at $225
23   an hour.  $450,000.  One of their experts.  So I
24   don't think that it's conceivable that anyone could
25   say that somewhere in that range is too much for

 1   what she went through.  Half of what I talked to you
 2   about Matthew, half of what we talked about for
 3   Matthew would be $560,000.  $560,000.
 4             If you do $560,000 per year from the date
 5   of injury, that would be $8,400,000.  In the future
 6   you heard he would have lived another eight years if
 7   he hadn't gotten COPD.  That would be another
 8   $4,480,000.  $8,400,000 in the top line, and
 9   $4,800,000 in the bottom line.
10             So the last questions have to do with
11   punishment and the whole reason, the most important
12   reason you are here.
13             Number ten, the most important question on
14   this version form.  Is this a case where something
15   RJR did they should be punished for?  That people
16   should take notice of?  That this company and other
17   tobacco companies and other tobacco companies should
18   take into account to deter them from doing anything
19   like this in the future?
20             Your Honor, can I take five minutes? 21             THE COURT:  You split up the time however
22   you want.
23             MR. UUSTAL:  Thank you, Your Honor.
24             I don't want to do the most important part
25   of the version form in two minutes.

 1             You remember Matt lost two days.  He was
 2   fined two days, suspended from work two days when
 3   they caught him smoking.  I think that is a good way
 4   to punish someone.  Take punished him by taking away
 5   two days pay just for making the mistake of smoking
 6   when he came out the door onto the floor.  I think
 7   you should look at RJR in the same way, and you are
 8   going to have to decide what is an appropriate
 9   punishment for a company like this.
10             I took a calendar and said just for the
11   days of this trial since we have been here until
12   today, how much did they make on average in net
13   earnings?  It is $3.6 million a day.  Two days fine
14   would be over $7,000,000.  For the entire trial it
15   adds up to $62,000,000 in excess cash.  That will
16   not affect the operation of this company at all.
17   This is after every single thing has been paid.
18             I have one more thing for you, one more
19   thing to talk about, because I don't know what a
20   good punishment really is.  Sometimes with my own
21   kids, something I found to be effective which they
22   hate is to say what do you think the punishment
23   should be.  And, you know, that is a good question
24   because the answer tells us a lot.  It tells us if
25   they are sorry.  That is why my kids hate it because

 1   if they did something bad and they tell me a
 2   punishment that is meaningless, I know either they
 3   are not sorry or they don't think what they did was
 4   bad.  It is a tough question for them.  But it is a
 5   good question.  And that is the question I have for
 6   RJR right now.  And I hope they give you an answer.
 7   What should the punishment be.
 8             I don't know if I talked to you about half
 9   the things I was planning to.  I know I went longer
10   than I expected to.  So thank you for your patience.
11             Thank you.


20             MR. UUSTAL:  I would like to think what I
21   do in this life has some meaning, that we do here
22   today going to mean anything.
23             RJR has the ability to hire the best, most
24   clever lawyers in the entire country, and you have
25   seen that.  Connie picked Todd and I.  We grew up

 1   here in Fort Lauderdale.  Went to high school
 2   together.  We are doing the best we can.  We want
 3   this to mean something.  And Connie does, too.
 4             There is a reason why RJR doesn't change.
 5   There is a reason.  And Mr. Geise showed you there
 6   are other lawsuits arising out of Engle, post Engle
 7   lawsuits that talked about.
 8             The money that he talked about that might
 9   be paid in those lawsuits that hasn't been paid?
10   Not one dime.  They don't admit that Matt was
11   addicted.  They don't admit that he was harmed by 12   smoking.  None of them were.  Not one dime.  That is
13   why they don't change.
14             If you are making that kind of money,
15   there has to be a reason to do something different.
16   They make the cigarettes to be addictive and they
17   don't have to.  Isn't that a big deal?  Shouldn't
18   they have to stop?  What we do can mean something.
19             I didn't suggest that $62 million number
20   there.  My personal opinion doesn't matter.  But I
21   don't think it is enough, because to mean something
22   we have to make them change.
23             When the CEO wake s up tomorrow morning he
24   has to be told about this, and there is only one way
25   to make him take notice.  That last question on the

 1   verdict form, that is not about what it is going to
 2   do to Connie.
 3             The total amount of punitive damages, it
 4   doesn't matter that it goes to Connie.  It doesn't
 5   matter that it is tax deductible.  Those are things
 6   not on what you are supposed to consider.  Because
 7   this is the only way and the only chance that you
 8   have to say it is not okay.
 9             All the things they do to make a cigarette
10   more addictive than tobacco is normally, they
11   shouldn't do it.  People die.
12             I don't know.  When I first got involved
13   in this case, I couldn't get over -- I don't know
14   how it has affected you.  Maybe we get numb after
15   awhile.  We hear about the tobacco company lies.
16   Maybe we just kind of accept it so that it is okay
17   for RJR to come into this courtroom and say it
18   didn't hurt anyone, they were just words, Matt
19   didn't rely on them.  For some people, those were
20   not just words.
21             When those lies resulted in a disease that
22   forced his family to watch him for 13 years
23   suffocate to death, that is what COPD is.  You heard
24   it.  I'm not going to show it to you again.  It is
25   just a little bit of breath, constantly on the edge

 1   of panic.  To watch him go through that.  Those were
 2   not just words for this family.  And if you ask me,
 3   it is not okay.  There is only one place for you to
 4   tell them that, and that is right there.
 5             On the question of how to punish them,
 6   15 years of litigation if you go back to Engle.  Mr.
 7   Reid was there.  There is nothing else I can do to
 8   make them stop.  But now you, the jury in the United
 9   States of America, you have the power that very few
10   people ever have.
11             I got so upset on the last part I don't
12   remember the first part of what I was supposed to
13   respond to. 14             It is not just Camels.  This will be a
15   part of the jury instructions that might seem a
16   little strange about how RJR, there was a merger of
17   the American Tobacco Company, and they took control
18   of another company, and all of these brands related
19   to RJR.  RJR is now responsible for, not just
20   Camels, not just Salems which were by and large the
21   vast majority of what he smoked.  The other ones you
22   heard testimony as well were manufactured by
23   companies like the American Tobacco Company which is
24   now a part of them which they are now responsible
25   for.

 1             Cigarettes are legal.  But like any legal
 2   product, they can be defective.  If a pharmaceutical
 3   drug was manufactured and it was manufactured to be
 4   extra addictive, that would be defective.  And
 5   nobody came in from RJR to take that stand and say
 6   we don't do it.  Nobody says we don't change the
 7   porosity of the paper.  We don't change the type of
 8   tobacco, the pH, the burn rate, the ink, the
 9   flavoring agents, the plasticizer, the filtration,
10   the permeability of the paper.
11             You heard evidence from one of the most
12   respected scientists in the country about how they
13   precisely control the delivery of nicotine to make
14   this more addictive than regular tobacco.  It is
15   undenied, unrebutted.  That is a defect.  It is
16   negligence, but it is far more than that.
17             It is a complicated verdict form.  But the
18   answers, all of them, should be yes.  The numbers
19   are up to you.  I have no suggestion for this last
20   number.  Before that I did give you suggestions of
21   95 percent to R.J. Reynolds and five percent to
22   Matthew Buonomo.  Why?  I don't see how it can be
23   more than five percent when only five percent of
24   smokers can quit each year and 95 percent relapse.
25   That $404,000 number is not disputed.  You will have

 1   to come to a determination of what the suffering
 2   that they went through is worth.
 3             This number, this last number, based on
 4   the law, there is a relationship between that number
 5   and this number and these numbers here.  So if these
 6   numbers are lower, then the judge, after this case
 7   is over, no matter what you do, will have to look at
 8   whether this number --
 9             MR. GEISE:  Objection, Your Honor.
10             THE COURT:  Overruled.
11             MR. UUSTAL:  Their internal documents say
12   we cannot defend smoking as free choice if the
13   person is addicted.  We admit it.  The only reason
14   you don't have to decide that Matthew is at fault is
15   because we admit it.  Connie doesn't believe it, 16   especially after what she heard here in trial.
17             Before he died, Matthew was our client.
18   He is not here because of a disease caused by
19   smoking, and you didn't get to hear from him.  She
20   told you he felt like he let the family down.
21             I'm not going to play for you the clip
22   from Dr. Silver.  But he explained to you how
23   miserable and devastating and panic stricken this
24   disease is if you have COPD.  And the idea of living
25   with that day after day after day for a year, and

 1   then having -- for 13 years, but for every year to
 2   have a tobacco company come in here and say that is
 3   not even worth what we pay one of our witnesses to
 4   say he wasn't addicted, it is not even worth
 5   one-third of what we pay a witness to spend a few
 6   hours and come here and say a man who was obviously
 7   addicted wasn't even addicted.  That took my breath
 8   away.
 9             They are willing to pay the lawyers God
10   knows how much, the experts you heard about.  A year
11   of gasping for breath is not worth -- It is not up
12   to me.  This is the law.  These are the things you
13   have to consider when compensating someone in a case
14   like this.  To suggest that gasping for breathing,
15   suffocating for a whole year is not worth even a
16   third as much as somebody sitting around reading a
17   few depositions and coming in here and talking?
18             Just in case there are any of you on the
19   jury still receptive to the idea that smoking is not
20   that bad, you heard Mr. Geise's closing argument
21   that smoking is like going to the Cheese Cake
22   Factory.  They are not informed.  It is the same
23   thing.  And they are good at it.  But that doesn't
24   make it true.
25             I have Connie's testimony about the things

 1   he relied upon, but I won't get into that.  I'll
 2   just remind you they paint the filters white.  You
 3   know he relied on that.  He mentioned things they
 4   said and he specifically said it is not proven.
 5   Should he have quit earlier?  Yes.  He should have.
 6   He should have.  Did he hear things?  Yes, he heard
 7   things.  We admit that.
 8             But the question is who took away his
 9   motivation?  Why didn't he quit?  There were
10   intentional lies here involving deadly drugs.  Let's
11   not skip over that.
12             They showed you a poll in 1954 that
13   70 percent said smoking was harmful.
14             THE CLERK:  Five minutes, Counselor.
15             MR. UUSTAL:  Five percent in 1954 thought
16   smoking could cause disease.
17             You have to remember that cigarettes were 18   initially marketed in a way that I guess were
19   somewhat similar to today.  They appealed to people
20   who were trying to break the rules.  There was a
21   backlash with cigarettes initially.  Even a backlash
22   helped cigarette sales because when kids thought it
23   was something that was an adult habit that they
24   shouldn't get involved in, that some people thought
25   was a dirty habit, it helped cigarette sales.  But

 1   that is very different hearing than cigarette
 2   smoking is something you shouldn't do in polite
 3   society.  It is very different than hearing it might
 4   cause a disease, and then thinking it might cause an
 5   disease.  So you have to look at those polls in
 6   context.
 7             Some of those polls are in evidence.  Only
 8   five percent of people thought smoking might cause a
 9   disease in 1950.  You know even in 1980 based on
10   government studies there were lots of people who
11   thought the risk was very small, and they thought
12   the risk was very small because they conspired.
13             They heard it again and again.  Billions
14   of dollars a year of advertising, a fake scientific
15   organization.  That is why they thought it.
16             Mr. Geise accepted he would live ten more
17   years.  So whatever number you decide per year, you
18   have to do it for the past, from the date of his
19   injury 15 years until today, and then into the
20   future ten more years of whatever number you
21   assigned per year times 15 for the past and times
22   ten for the future.
23             I'm not going to get into all this.  This
24   case is for you to decide.  I'm not suggesting what
25   it is that would be an appropriate punishment.  I'm

 1   just giving you the facts that $3.6 million a day
 2   this company has in excess cash per day.
 3             Per hour?  Per hour that is a lot.  Just
 4   during the time of this trial it made $62 million.
 5   What you are going to do with that is up to you.
 6             This trial has been a few weeks.  I thank
 7   you for being patient.  The litigation has been a
 8   lot longer.  The conspiracy started a long time ago.
 9   And we didn't go through all the things the Engle
10   jury heard for over a year because those things were
11   proven.  Now it is for you to take the next step,
12   the final step, and make a difference.
13             Thank you.
