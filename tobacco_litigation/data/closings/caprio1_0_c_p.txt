4       MR. HAMMER:  Thank you, Judge.  May it
5 please the Court.
6       Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
7 This is our opportunity to sum up the case.  I
8 know we've been here for a long time.  We truly
9 appreciate the attention you've given us.
10       We put on a lot of evidence.  You heard
11 from Dr. Proctor, you heard from Dr. Seidman,
12 you heard from Dr. Mannino, you heard from
13 Dr. Patel, you heard from Dr. Herrera.  You
14 heard from Ed, you heard from Bryan.  And we
15 put together the case for you because we didn't
16 know what you needed to hear to come to a
17 decision.
18       And you may have heard some repetitive
19 stuff, and we apologize for that, and it may
20 have taken a lot longer than you all
21 anticipated, and we apologize for that.
22       But we don't know what you need to hear.
23 And we think we brought you forth enough
24 evidence to convince you by a greater weight of
25 the evidence that certainly Ed belongs as a

1 class member.
2       So I thank you for your patience, and
3 we're going to try to rip through what we
4 covered in the last few weeks in the next
5 couple hours.
6       I'm going to talk to you for a little
7 while, then Mr. Schlesinger is going to talk to
8 you for a little while, Mr. Gdanski may talk to
9 you.  So all of us are going to talk to you
10 about what we showed you throughout the past
11 few weeks.
12       First of all, trial by jury.  Great
13 thing.  It's a great thing we have in this
14 country.
15       Thomas Jefferson said, "The best of all
16 safeguards for the person and property of every
17 individual."
18       He said that a long time ago, and it
19 still stands true today.  What you all are
20 doing is magnificent, the fact that you've been
21 here, and we appreciate that.
22       You know, it's been 20 years, nearly 20
23 years since Ed was first diagnosed with COPD.
24 On that day, he learned he had a
25 life-threatening disease.  On that day, he

1 learned the impact of the cigarettes that he'd
2 been smoking for all those years.
3       He started smoking when he was 15 years
4 old; a kid, a kid.  He started smoking as a
5 kid, when the world was different.  The world
6 was totally different.
7       And, you know, he tried -- as soon as he
8 found out how smoking was affecting him, he
9 tried to quit.
10       Number 37.
11       He tried to quit so many different ways.
12 We talked about this.  Many times you've seen
13 this.  We put it up, the defense put it up.
14 Dr. Seidman talked about it.  Ed talked about
15 it.  Dr. Dorce talked about it, their own
16 addiction expert.
17       He tried so many different ways to quit,
18 and he couldn't do it.
19       Thankfully, today he sits there, since
20 January 1st of this year, not smoking.  It's
21 miraculous.  Hopefully he never goes back
22 again.
23       But he tried to quit.  And the question
24 that you've got to decide in this case is, was
25 Ed addicted?

1       Well, he tried to quit, and every time he
2 tried -- number 38 -- he went through all sorts
3 of withdrawal symptoms.  Every single range.
4 All the -- the whole gamut of withdrawal
5 symptoms.
6       We talked about this.  You saw this
7 slide.  And Ed talked about it, Dr. Seidman
8 talked about it, Dr. Dorce talked about it.
9        Dr. Dorce said:  Yeah, but he had
10 control over his smoking.
11       Okay, that was her opinion, and she's
12 entitled to that.
13       Throughout the years, he quit.  He would
14 quit for brief periods of time.  But that hook
15 kept drawing him back.  He was addicted.  This
16 is a man that was hopelessly addicted and still
17 is today.  He still craves the cigarettes.
18 That's crazy.  It's crazy, but he does.
19       That's how powerful this addiction is.
20 And for some people, they can put it down,
21 never look back.
22       Ed can't do that.  He hasn't been able to
23 do that.  He's done it now for the past, now,
24 what is it, I don't know how many -- 38 days
25 now, I guess.

1       But, you know, it's a difficult task.
2 And every day he fights it.  He told you that.
3       Nearly every doctor that saw Ed, all the
4 people close to him, Bryan, Ed himself, Louise,
5 all his doctors, throughout the medical records
6 said nicotine addiction, tobacco addiction.
7       The doctors that treated him, that had
8 their hands on him.  You heard from Dr. Patel
9 and Dr. Herrera, the men that touched him, that
10 felt him, that talked to him directly, that
11 knew him the best, all throughout the medical
12 records from '96 on, said he was addicted.
13 They had no doubt about it.
14       We have to prove that Ed's addiction led
15 to his disease.  Caused his disease.
16       And there's legal cause.  I'm going to
17 talk about that in a minute.
18       But, you know, there is no dispute in
19 this case -- number 18.
20       There is no dispute in this case that
21 Ed's COPD and lung cancer was caused by
22 smoking.
23       Dr. Andrews, remember Dr. Andrews, the
24 defense expert even came in and said:  No, he
25 had lung cancer.  He had COPD caused from his

1 smoking.  Now, he didn't talk about addiction.
2       Dr. Dorce from the defense talked about
3 addiction.
4       But what did Dr. Mannino tell you, the
5 world-renowned expert.  What did Dr. Patel,
6 Dr. Herrera.  They told you, Ed's addiction
7 caused him to smoke all those cigarettes.  Ed's
8 addiction caused that disease.
9       That's what we have here.  Now, by virtue
10 of those facts alone, Ed should be considered a
11 member of the Engle class.
12       That's the first question you have to
13 answer.  First question, Engle class.
14       The Engle class, a member of the original
15 700,000 members of sick or dying smokers in the
16 state of Florida.  That was the original class.
17       What we're here to determine today, is Ed
18 Caprio one of the children, the progeny of the
19 Engle class action case that took place 20
20 years ago.
21       We said he is.  Of course he is.  That's
22 why he's sitting here.  He's waited now --
23 since being diagnosed with COPD, he's waited
24 for his day in court.
25       And we thank you for that.  He thanks you

1 for that.
2       Now, number 22.  The Engle findings.
3       The Engle findings, the Judge read these
4 to you.  This is what the Engle jury
5 determined.  The Supreme Court said this stands
6 once you find that Ed is a member of the Engle
7 class.
8       Is he a member of the Engle class?  Of
9 course he is.
10       Let's take a look at the verdict form.
11 This is the verdict form you're going to be
12 getting.
13       The first question you have to answer is:
14 Was Ed Caprio a member of the Engle class
15 essentially?
16       Was Ed Caprio addicted to cigarettes
17 containing nicotine, and if so, was such
18 addiction a legal cause of Mr. Caprio's COPD?
19       (There was a telephone interruption.)
20       MR. GDANSKI:  It's a tradition.
21       MR. HAMMER:  Was it?  Of course it was.
22 So we would ask you to check off "yes."
23       And each of these cigarettes, Philip
24 Morris, Lorillard, and R.J. Reynolds, did their
25 cigarettes cause them?  Yes.  That's what he

1 smoked.
2       He smoked Philip Morris cigarettes,
3 Marlboros, he smoked Kents.  When he switched,
4 he smoked Winstons.  He smoked their products.
5       So, of course, those cigarettes, each one
6 of them that he smoked, caused his COPD.
7       That's a threshold question to determine
8 whether or not -- let's go to the Engle
9 findings in this case.  To determine whether or
10 not the Engle findings apply to this case.
11       It's a threshold question.  It should be
12 a no-brainer.  It should be simple.  A simple
13 question to answer.
14       Now, was Ed addicted to the cigarettes?
15 Of course he was.
16       Go to slide 8.
17       This is what he smoked.  All these
18 different brands.  This is what he started out
19 with Liggett, but he only smoked a handful.
20 Started out with Chesterfields.
21       Then he went to R.J. Reynolds' products;
22 Lucky Strike, Camels.
23       Philip Morris, Lorillard, again back to
24 Philip Morris, Marlboro Lights.  Continued with
25 Philip Morris, and then he smoked Winston

1 Lights, an R.J. Reynolds product.
2       That's why these companies are liable for
3 his injuries.  Liable for his COPD.  That's
4 what he smoked.
5       Now, defense will probably get up here
6 and say it wasn't his addiction that caused his
7 COPD.  It wasn't his addiction.  It was his
8 choices.  It was his failure to quit.
9       But you know what?  Nobody chooses
10 addiction.  Nobody chooses addiction.
11       And, you know, Dr. Dorce came in here and
12 she's Harvard, Yale grad.  Very impressive.
13 She is an addiction expert in heroin, cocaine,
14 opiates, pills.  She works up in Palm Beach at
15 a facility that treats inpatient.
16       And what did she tell you?  Well, what
17 was interesting is she tells you that she also
18 treats nicotine addiction.  However, at her
19 facility, they recommend their patients to
20 bring a carton of cigarettes with them.  The
21 people that are addicted to nicotine, bring
22 your drug with you.
23       She's not focusing on nicotine addiction.
24 She may be a great addiction specialist with
25 regard to heroin and cocaine, but she doesn't

1 know a whole lot about nicotine addiction.  She
2 hasn't written on it, she hasn't published on
3 it.
4       We brought you people who devoted their
5 lives to nicotine and to tobacco and nicotine
6 addiction.
7       Dr. Seidman, Dr. Mannino, people that
8 contributed to the Surgeon General's reports.
9 These are all in evidence.  People contributed
10 to these reports.
11       We brought you reputable, world-renowned
12 doctors that specialize in nicotine addiction.
13       They brought you Dr. Dorce, and she said
14 under the criteria of the DSM-5, that Ed's not
15 addicted.
16       Well, okay.  Well, let's take a look at
17 the DSM-5.  And go to 36.
18       VIDEO TECHNICIAN:  36 or 12?
19       MR. HAMMER:  I'm sorry, 12.  You're
20 right.  I apologize.  Number 12.
21       She talked about the DSM-5, and she said,
22 well, he meets two other criteria, so he's got
23 a tobacco disorder.  But it doesn't rise to the
24 level of addiction.
25       And then Mr. Gdanski you remember was

1 asking her questions about, well, what about
2 this one, what about that one?
3       And he asked her the one about -- which
4 one is it, number 8.  Recurrent tobacco use in
5 situations in which it is physically hazardous.
6 And she said, no, he doesn't fit that.
7       Let's put up the next slide.
8       She said -- in fact, there was a medical
9 record that Jon said:  Well, he smoked by his
10 oxygen tank.
11       She said:  Yeah, but he knew the risk.
12       Well, that fits that criteria right
13 there.  A man that is sitting here on oxygen,
14 lights up a cigarette?  Come on.
15       He fits that criteria.  That's a lot more
16 dangerous than smoking in bed.  And yet she
17 said he doesn't fit that criteria.
18       You know, unfortunately, I don't think
19 Dr. Dorce was an unbiased, unprejudicial
20 witness.  She was an expert witness that was
21 paid by the tobacco companies to come in here
22 and say that Ed doesn't meet the criteria.
23       And yet she couldn't argue with
24 Mr. Gdanski when he asked her about all those
25 other definitions.

1       Now, I think 36, right?
2       About whether or not tobacco was highly
3 addictive.  And she kept saying:  Well, highly,
4 I don't know about highly.  It can be
5 addictive.
6       And she kept saying:  Well, I don't know,
7 you know, it could be.  It could not be.
8       And it sounded a lot like -- I don't know
9 if you remember when we were playing the videos
10 with Dr. Proctor, there was that woman Anne
11 Browder that talked for the tobacco industry.
12 And she said:  Well, it could be, it may not
13 be.  And that seemed to be the tagline for
14 tobacco all those years in the conspiracy.
15       And, you know, Dr. Dorce, she followed
16 that tagline.  It can be addictive.  It may be,
17 it may not be.
18       And she actually -- this is what kind of
19 boggles the mind.
20       MR. SEIDEN:  Objection, litigation
21 objection.
22       THE COURT:  Overruled.
23       MR. HAMMER:  A woman who treats people
24 with heroin, cocaine, opiates, pain killer
25 addiction, when Jon -- when Mr. Gdanski asked

1 her:  Well, Doctor, how about heroin, is that
2 addictive?
3       Well, it can be.
4       Seriously?  Heroin, crack cocaine can be?
5       Use your common sense.  Crack cocaine, by
6 its very nature, is addictive.  Heroin is
7 addictive.  All of those drugs are addictive
8 drugs.  She was using the tobacco tagline.  And
9 that's because she's a tobacco expert.
10       Now, the other things you're going to be
11 asked to do on this verdict form is state
12 whether Mr. Caprio reasonably relied upon any
13 statements made after May '82 which concealed
14 or omitted information and whether he
15 reasonably relied to his detriment on any
16 statement made after '82 in furtherance of the
17 conspiracy.
18       Well, Mr. Caprio started smoking when he
19 was 15 years old.  He started with the
20 non-filtered cigarettes and then switched to
21 filters, because he didn't like the tobacco in
22 his teeth.
23       Remember, he told you about that?
24       But then he stayed smoking filters for
25 the rest of his life.  And he relied upon the

1 fact -- ultimately, he switched to Kent,
2 because Kent, by Lorillard, came out with a
3 safer filter, a charcoal filter.  That's why he
4 switched to Kent.  He told you that.
5       That's in the '60s, right when all the
6 information started coming out.  And he said to
7 you:  There was confusion.  And there was
8 confusion generated by the tobacco companies.
9       Now, I'm sure the defense will get up
10 here and say, well, wait a minute.  What
11 statement did he rely on?  We asked Mr. Caprio,
12 what statement.  Did you see any of these
13 statements?
14       Well, no, but all of those statements
15 formed the public's information.  They formed
16 what America relied upon.  They formed what Ed
17 Caprio relied upon, and he relied upon the ads
18 that said filters are safer.
19       And then what did he do?  He switched to
20 lights.  When it became known, more known that
21 cigarettes may be dangerous or are dangerous,
22 what did tobacco companies do?  They came out
23 with light cigarettes, light cigarettes.
24       And he switched to light cigarettes.
25 Why?  Because the ads said, not necessarily

1 said "they are safer," but they certainly
2 implied that.
3       And the tobacco companies duped him.  He
4 told you:  I was duped.
5       And he continued smoking lights until he
6 finally quit.  And what is so significant is
7 that when he meets up with Bryan, Bryan is
8 smoking regulars.  Bryan and he get together,
9 and Ed convinces Bryan to switch to light
10 cigarettes.
11       In the late '80s, close to '90s, Bryan
12 told you:  I switched to lights.  Why?  Because
13 Ed told me they're safer.  Smoke lights, they
14 are safer.
15       Well, so did Ed rely, continue to smoke
16 light cigarettes based on something this
17 tobacco company said or did, or omitted to say?
18 It's kind of hard to rely on something that's
19 omitted.  But of course he did.
20       It's kind of -- how do you know if
21 somebody omits it from you?  They don't tell
22 you if they conspire to conceal it.  Well,
23 that's what they did, they conspired to conceal
24 it, and Ed relied upon the light cigarettes
25 into the '80s, beyond '82.

1       And that's why you should check these
2 boxes off.
3       And, you know, now, Liggett, they'll get
4 up here and tell you, well, we weren't part of
5 the initial conspiracy in 1953.  We didn't sign
6 on to the Frank Statement until 1954.
7       Dr. Proctor will tell you, no, they
8 didn't.
9       But they became part of it, and they
10 contributed to it.  They did.  That's why they
11 should be held responsible as well.
12       Now, the other thing we're going to have
13 to ask you about is talk about fault.  Talking
14 about fault.
15       Well, what did Ed Caprio know about
16 smoking cigarettes?  Well, he did know
17 eventually that smoking cigarettes can be
18 harmful.  He did learn smoking cigarettes can
19 cause disease.
20       I mean, he had family members that got
21 sick.  I'm sure the defense will point out that
22 John's uncle -- I'm sorry, John's father, Ed's
23 uncle, got sick and had COPD.  I'm sure they
24 will point that out to you.
25       So he should have known better.  You know

1 what?  Maybe he should have.  But you know
2 what?  These guys really knew what was going
3 on.
4       And had they told the world the truth in
5 1954, instead of forming that conspiracy, had
6 they said -- and taken out the Frank Statement
7 and said, Hey, smoking is linked to cancer, you
8 ought to quit now, guess what?
9       If they did that in 1954, Hey, smoking is
10 linked to cancer, we're stopping, we're not
11 going to make our product anymore.  Guess what?
12 Ed would never have been able to smoke that
13 first cigarette in 1958, if they lived up to
14 their promises.
15       But instead, they decided to form a
16 conspiracy and hide the truth for the next 50,
17 60 years, hide the truth from people like Ed
18 Caprio.
19       So what kind of responsibility should Ed
20 have had?  Really, when you think of it in
21 light of the tobacco companies?
22       I would say -- I would suggest to you
23 that each of the tobacco companies should share
24 the blame.  Liggett, maybe a little bit less
25 because they joined the conspiracy later.  They

1 got out earlier.
2       And Ed, a total of 5 percent.
3       MR. COFER:  Objection, Your Honor.  May
4 we approach, please?
5       THE COURT:  Sure.
6       (The following discussion was held at
7       sidebar:)
8       MR. COFER:  I move for mistrial.  I move
9 for mistrial.
10       They should be estopped from arguing that
11 he accepts any responsibility.
12       Mr. Hammer represented in jury selection
13 that he accepted no responsibility; that we
14 were 100 percent at fault.  They used that
15 argument to kick people off the jury, and now
16 they can't -- having kicked people off the jury
17 and taking that position, they can't now come
18 back and try to seem reasonable.
19       They are judicially estopped from that,
20 so you neither need to instruct the jury that
21 it's 100 percent at fault or we need a
22 mistrial.
23       MR. HAMMER:  Judge, I totally disagree
24 with defense.
25       THE COURT:  I do, too.  I'll deny that

1 request for mistrial.
2       MR. COFER:  You know what I want to do?
3 Then I want to admit their prior petitions,
4 their prior complaints where they admitted
5 fault, and they then backed off and got you to
6 let them say they are no longer at fault.
7       They use Ed as both a -- in their words,
8 a sword and a shield.  You can't do that.  You
9 can't take the position to kick people off the
10 jury, and once you get the jury you think you
11 want, you completely change your position for
12 the jury you had.
13       THE COURT:  I'm going to deny that
14 request.
15       (Sidebar discussion concluded, and the
16       following was held in open court:)
17       MR. HAMMER:  May I proceed, Judge?
18       THE COURT:  If the court reporter is
19 ready.
20       THE REPORTER:  I'm ready.
21       MR. HAMMER:  You know, you should say,
22 Hey, Ed shouldn't be held responsible at all.
23 And we don't think he should be.
24       But -- but -- if you think Ed could have
25 tried harder, if you think Ed maybe should have

1 quit earlier, his share of the responsibility
2 pales in comparison to these guys.  That's why
3 I say if you're going to fault Ed at all, fault
4 him 5 percent, at most.  Because these guys,
5 what they did is reprehensible.
6       Mr. Schlesinger is going to talk to you
7 about that, about the reprehensible conduct,
8 and why they should be punished.
9       Now, the other thing you're going to be
10 asked to do is determine the amount of money
11 sustained by Ed Caprio with respect to the
12 following elements.
13       One of them is ... there's been a
14 stipulation with regard to the amount of money
15 involved as far as past lost wages, as far as
16 past medical costs, and as far as future
17 medical expenses.
18       The stipulation of past lost wages of
19 $206,158.  Stipulation of past medical costs of
20 $103,014.  And future medical expenses of
21 $75,000 a year in the future.
22       And we read to you the life tables, the
23 life tables, according to the National
24 Consensus Bureau, Centers for Disease Control.
25 They say a man of Ed's age should live to about

1 another 13-1/2 years.
2       And you may think he should live less, he
3 may live longer.  We don't know.  But we would
4 submit to you that he hopefully has another
5 13-1/2 years left.
6       And so 13-1/2 times 75,000 is $1,012,500,
7 for a total of economic loss of $1,321,672.
8 Thank you.
9       Now, you're also going to be asked to
10 determine what damages Ed deserves for pain and
11 suffering.
12       You know, Ed has been on this oxygen
13 tank.  He lives every day in fear that his
14 oxygen might run out.  He lives every day
15 without this oxygen like a fish out of water.
16       He told you about this lung cancer
17 surgery he had, a lifesaving operation where
18 they removed two lobes of his lung as a result
19 of an epidemic that these companies created,
20 lung cancer, which was not existent before
21 cigarettes.  Remember, Dr. Proctor told you,
22 lung cancer, if a doctor saw that in the 1900s,
23 he would call the medical students together,
24 look at lung cancer.
25       And now it's rampant, one of the number

1 one killers in the nation.  It's unbelievable.
2 And it was created by these companies.
3       Ed has pain to this day as a result of
4 that surgery.  Pain to this day.  He described
5 for you what they had to do to cut open his
6 body.  He's got a scar going from front to
7 back.  He feels it every day of his life.
8       How do you compensate somebody for that?
9 I would suggest to you that a fair compensation
10 is $12 million, for a total award of
11 $13,321,672.
12       That's fair, that's just.  For a man that
13 sits here today a cripple.  And he only sits
14 here today a cripple as a result of their
15 product.  This product kills more people than
16 the number of bullets have killed people in the
17 war.  Dr. Proctor told you that.
18       MR. BIDEAU:  Objection, Your Honor.
19       THE COURT:  Overruled.
20       MR. HAMMER:  That's crazy.
21       And yet, yeah, it's legal.  But you know
22 what?  A responsible company would have done
23 what they promised back in 1954.  They would
24 have looked out for their customers, and they
25 would have shut down.

1       Yeah, it's legal.  But they would have
2 done the right thing.  Because in this country,
3 corporations don't do that.  In this country,
4 if you're going to make a product, stand behind
5 it.
6       If you're going to make a product and it
7 hurts people, fix it.  If you're going to make
8 a product and it kills people, then stop making
9 it.  It's not a lot to ask.
10       But you know what?  They just can't do
11 it.  They can't help themselves.  You know why?
12 Because for them, it's all about money.  It's
13 all about money.
14       And that's why when you're asked should
15 these companies be punished, absolutely.  They
16 deserve to be punished, they need to be
17 punished.  They need to be told, hey, look, you
18 can't do this.  We -- this jury, you, who
19 decide this case, we can't accept this kind of
20 behavior.
21       Shut these boxes off and let us go on to
22 a punitive damage phase.  It's going to be very
23 short.  Very short.
24       Mr. Schlesinger is going to talk to you a
25 little bit more and talk about the conduct of

1 these companies.
2       But as you sit there, think about Ed.
3       Show some of the photos.
4       Think about Ed Caprio, think about the
5 fact he sits here before you, as he told you, a
6 proud gay man.  He got married last month.
7 Finally, his dream fulfilled.  Thirty-two years
8 he's been with the same person.
9       That's amazing in this day and age that
10 couples can stay together that long.  And now
11 he's married.  He hopes to live a long life
12 with Bryan.
13       Ed sits here before you, and it's been
14 our honor and our privilege to represent him in
15 front of you all.
16       I ask you to listen carefully to
17 Mr. Schlesinger's argument.  I ask you to
18 listen carefully to the defense argument, and
19 see what they have to say.  Because I've got
20 news for you, folks.  This case is important to
21 them, and it's important to Mr. Caprio.
22       The case is going to be in your hands
23 soon, and we look forward to talking to you
24 some more about punitive damages.
25       Thank you, Judge.


12       MR. SCHLESINGER:  May it please the
13 Court.  Counsel.  Ladies and gentlemen of the
14 jury.
15       Good morning.  I'm Scott Schlesinger, and
16 I've been with you for as much of this trial as
17 I could be.  Circumstances have impaired some
18 of my involvement in the case, nothing you need
19 to worry about, but I am glad to be here.
20       I'm busting to be able to talk to you.
21 So I've tried to pay close attention to what is
22 going on with this case as best I can, read the
23 transcripts, keep up with my great trial team
24 who really stepped up and supported me when I
25 needed help from them.

1       It's a wonderful thing.  Nothing that's
2 any of your business, but just -- we have a
3 great trial team, and we do these cases in a
4 lot of different places.
5       So if you will indulge me, even though
6 you don't know me.  I missed your jury
7 selection process, so I have not developed a
8 comfort level with you.
9       You do not know me to know is this guy
10 trustworthy?  I haven't seen how he's acting.
11 So if you will take one thing from me at face
12 value, I will not intentionally mislead you
13 about anything that's happened in this court or
14 evidence in the case.
15       If your collective recollection differs
16 than anything that I say, rely on your
17 collective recollection.  Okay?
18       My job is to talk to you about an
19 enterprise of death, a great historical wrong
20 that brings us into this courtroom in the
21 United States of America to pursue a system of
22 justice that only we have, where the mighty and
23 powerful can be on -- brought to bear to be on
24 equal footing with regular folks like us.
25       I want to talk about that, talk about

1 some of the evidence that came in with regard
2 to wrongful conduct by the tobacco companies.
3       Now, let's just start right here.
4       Okay.  And you will see that in
5 evidence -- you actually have these textbooks
6 in evidence.  Now, these books are the Surgeon
7 General's reports.  They are the -- our top
8 health agency, our federal agency, the Surgeon
9 General.
10       This is for the health and welfare and
11 the public good.  This is for the benefit and
12 the well-being of the health of Americans.
13       And we hopefully honored this process by
14 bringing you heavyweight experts who
15 contributed to this -- to the chapters in these
16 books who were senior scientific reviewers, who
17 hew to the truth of medicine and science as we
18 know it.
19       And even a book like this, that's just
20 published in 2014, a year ago, where even
21 Dr. Proctor went to the White House to attend
22 the unveiling of this book, because he was such
23 an important contributor to it.
24       You can get this book free from the
25 government.  Every one of you.  Get five

1 copies.  They will send it to you for free.
2 They will even pay the mailing.
3       But this is the statement of the truth
4 about tobacco, and it is news.  Because, even
5 in 2014, they continue to say we have an
6 industrially driven epidemic.
7       The tobacco epidemic is not about people
8 smoking, it's about an industry that -- the
9 epidemic is persistent.  Not because kids are
10 reckless, but rather, because a powerful
11 industry depends upon its perpetuation.  That's
12 where the tobacco epidemic has come from.
13       And now, as recently as 2014, they have
14 begun to focus on the role that the tobacco
15 industry has played, because they, too, have
16 had a decade or more now to research the
17 internal secret documents that didn't
18 previously exist.
19       Imagine what a different world we would
20 live in if all of those research of scientists
21 that the internal documents at those -- that
22 the tobacco industry had.  If they had that out
23 in the open and contributed to the knowledge of
24 the public health authority, all the things we
25 would have learned, how much sooner we would

1 have learned it.  But we didn't, because it was
2 all withheld.
3       Now that it's not withheld, the Surgeon
4 General and all the myriad of professors and
5 authorities that are contributing to this
6 document are using those internal documents to
7 learn things they never knew.
8       The secrets that tobacco held in their
9 own laboratories about how they knew it was
10 addictive, how they celebrated addiction.
11 Addiction was the center of their universe.  It
12 was the sine qua non, nicotine -- without
13 nicotine, there was no business.
14       So one of the things that's here, the
15 major conclusions, you can turn right to them.
16 You have this in evidence.  You can turn to
17 major conclusions and you can read.
18       This is on page 7.  Scientific basis of
19 report.  This is all heavily vetted,
20 peer-reviewed literature.
21       Take a look at something like this.  And
22 what they say is, in major conclusion number 1:
23 An enormous avoidable public health tragedy,
24 the century-long epidemic.  More than
25 20 million premature deaths.

1       I challenge the tobacco defendants, the
2 cigarette lawyers who will come up.
3 Mr. Tepikian, who may be a nice guy, but he is
4 not Philip Morris.  He's an attorney
5 representing Philip Morris.
6       And I challenge him to come up here and
7 say, we have been responsible for the deaths of
8 20 million.  Or don't even say that.  We agree
9 there have been 20 million deaths from tobacco.
10       But you won't hear that.  Because much as
11 we are asking you to say, this case is about
12 punishment.  This case is about correcting a
13 historical wrongdoing.  Part of it is no
14 acknowledgment of past wrongdoing, which
15 requires further deterrence.
16       When we ask you to consider this case as
17 one which merits a penalty, a fine, punishment,
18 it is because we ask you to see the truth of
19 this case as it's unfolded in this courtroom
20 and in the evidence that you have available to
21 look at, as something that calls out from you
22 for an expression of moral condemnation for
23 quasi criminal behavior by the tobacco
24 companies --
25       MR. BIDEAU:  Objection, Your Honor.

1       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- and you'll see that
2 as we go.
3       THE COURT:  Sustained.
4       MR. BIDEAU:  Move to strike.
5       THE COURT:  I'll strike it.
6       The jury is to disregard.
7       MR. SCHLESINGER:  I have case law
8 supporting that statement, Judge.  But I'll
9 move on.
10       THE COURT:  Okay.
11       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Now, then, the tobacco
12 epidemic was initiated and was sustained by the
13 aggressive strategies of the tobacco industry
14 which has deliberately misled the public on the
15 risks of smoking cigarettes.
16       You see?
17       In 2010, 2012, 2014, the most recent
18 pronouncements with wonderful pieces of data
19 that you really should take a moment to look
20 through, if you have a chance back there.
21       Here is a conclusion that says, it isn't
22 about let's quit smoking and try harder to
23 quit.
24       It's about a tobacco epidemic that was
25 initiated and sustained by the aggressive

1 strategies of the tobacco industry which has
2 deliberately misled the public on the risks of
3 smoking cigarettes.
4       And what do they also say?  What is a big
5 point of this document here which also says
6 that 40 million people are caught in the web of
7 addiction?  We'll get to that.
8       That's all the smokers.  40 million
9 people.  Over half a million deaths a year.
10 One-third of all cancer deaths.  One in five of
11 all deaths of Americans in this country.
12       Imagine you went to a cemetery, and every
13 fifth headstone had a little no smoking symbol
14 on it.
15       MR. BIDEAU:  Objection, Your Honor.
16       THE COURT:  Overruled.
17       MR. SCHLESINGER:  That's how broad this
18 epidemic is.  We're inured to it.  I say it's
19 an irrational madness that hides in plain
20 sight, you know, because cigarettes look like
21 normal consumer products.  And they are nothing
22 but drugs.  All these are, are drugs.
23       That's all this is.  That's all this is,
24 that's all it ever was.  But it looks like a
25 normal consumer product.  And where it's hard

1 to wrap your mind around it, but this is drugs.
2 That's all it is.  That's all it's ever been.
3       A cigarette is a delivery device, a
4 vehicle, a delivery device for nicotine.  The
5 product is not the cigarette.  The cigarette is
6 the package.  The product is nicotine.  The
7 nicotine that hits the brain faster,
8 intravenous in less than ten seconds.
9       And a person like Ed Caprio has smoked
10 over half a million cigarettes.  And every
11 puff, every cigarette is 8 to 10 puffs.
12 5 million hits of the drug nicotine to the
13 brain.  5 million hits.  Who does that but for
14 the nicotine?
15       Taste?  Pleasure?  Satisfaction?  Pep?
16 It gives you a lift?  These are nonsense terms.
17       These are the terms of an advertising and
18 marketing culture that's spent a quarter of a
19 trillion dollars to convince people that they
20 were doing something fun with a cigarette.
21       Nobody smokes on a clock, day in and day
22 out, a pack, two packs a day, hundreds of hits
23 of nicotine to the brain.  Except the drug is
24 short-lasting, it goes to the brain, the brain
25 is rewired, it becomes full of receptors that

1 scream for that nicotine, and folks become
2 hopeless addicts.
3       Now, when they set out to hook their
4 customers, they are hooking children.  That's
5 the basis of the business.  That's the dirty
6 little secret that hides in plain sight.
7       And when you see documents -- and I
8 believe Mr. Seidman held one up from Diane
9 Burrows from 1984 that clearly said, Hey, you
10 know, we've got to get these 12-year-olds.  All
11 smoking is based on youth.
12       But by that time, they had a new code
13 word.
14       MR. SEIDEN:  Objection, misstates the
15 evidence.
16       THE COURT:  Overruled.
17       MR. SCHLESINGER:  They had a new code
18 word.  And the code word was, don't call them
19 youth anymore.  Call them young adults.
20       Well, why would it be that in a secret
21 1984 Diane Burrows document, there would be so
22 many references to the word "young adults."
23 That's because in 1975, you saw the Pittman
24 document where they said, You know what?  We
25 better change reference to the word "youth" to

1 reference to young adults.
2       It was a code word for 12-year-olds,
3 13-year-olds, 14-year-olds, 15-year-olds.  But
4 it was in the secret document.
5       Why?  Because it is so incendiary, it is
6 so outside the bounds of moral human decency of
7 what regular folks, human beings that care for
8 one another, that should be protecting
9 children, not addicting them, that in the event
10 that those documents ever got out, which they
11 ultimately did a decade after the lawsuit shook
12 loose the documents, they could come in now and
13 say, Look, it says "young adult."
14       But we've got the goods on them.  We
15 showed you the document that said, Don't call
16 the youth -- the 12-year-olds, the
17 13-year-olds, the 14-year-olds, don't call them
18 youth, call them young adults.
19       Just like Dr. Proctor said that we have a
20 code word that they use for lung cancer.  And
21 what is that code word?  Zephyr.  And what is
22 zephyr?  Zephyr is a warm, nurturing breeze.
23 Everybody loves a zephyr during an Indian
24 summer, not an ill wind of lung cancer.
25       So these are some of the things that I

1 want you to reflect on.
2       In any event, they called for the end of
3 this epidemic by getting rid of cigarettes.
4 That's what Dr. Proctor said.  He believes in
5 abolition, and his book says, right on the
6 cover:  Abolish cigarettes.  It's a laudable
7 goal.  It makes sense.
8       There is no redeeming basis to
9 cigarettes.  And for an industry to get away
10 with a conspiracy for 50 years that killed
11 20 million Americans is -- it doesn't meet with
12 the bounds of moral humanity or decency.
13       I put up Mount Everest.  Why do I do
14 that?  Because remember Dr. Mannino talked
15 about just how rare it is for a man like Ed
16 Caprio to be an Engle class member that was way
17 back in '92, '93, '94, '95, '96?
18       You guys thought Jon talked fast, right?
19 I have got a lot to cover.  So you'll get most
20 of it.  I know you won't get -- but I -- you
21 know, let it wash over you, get the impression
22 from me.  And if I do it too fast, again, I
23 apologize.
24       Just thanks for listening to me.  You
25 guys never met me before.

1       So Mount Everest -- and here is the
2 thing.  You guys are here for a historic moment
3 in time.
4       MR. COFER:  Objection, Your Honor,
5 improper argument.
6       MS. RUIZ:  Objection.
7       THE COURT:  Overruled.
8       MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is an important
9 moment in time.  You guys are on the cutting
10 edge of important litigation going on all
11 around this state, the Engle progeny class
12 litigation.  It's going on right in this
13 courtroom as we speak.
14       And the thing is, Ed is a rare, rare,
15 rare breed.  Most Engle progeny folks are dead,
16 and their family members are here.
17       MR. COFER:  Objection, lack of
18 foundation, and improper argument.
19       THE COURT:  Overruled.
20       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Dr. Mannino testified
21 to this.  He said it's extraordinarily rare.
22       And I submit to you that Mount Everest,
23 as seen from the Rongbuk Monastery, the north
24 face of Everest in Tibet, that there are more
25 people that have stood at the top of that

1 mountain than have lived to face Philip Morris
2 in a courtroom, in a court of law, and face
3 them for what they accuse them to do.
4       So this is a rare and special moment, and
5 we call upon you to think about that and rise
6 to the occasion.  Because this is a case in
7 which you all probably hold now more power than
8 you've ever held in your entire lives, and more
9 power than you'll ever hold --
10       MS. RUIZ:  Objection.
11       MR. COFER:  Objection, Your Honor.
12       THE COURT:  I will sustain the objection.
13       MR. COFER:  Ask to strike.
14       THE COURT:  I'll strike it.  Jury is to
15 disregard it.
16       Go right ahead, sir.
17       MR. SCHLESINGER:  When I talk about the
18 power, I mean the jury instructions empower you
19 to follow the law and apply the law.
20       We will get to the law in a minute.
21       Right here, what business is this company
22 in?  What business is this company in?  This is
23 just RJR's website.  Philip Morris has a
24 similar website.  This is one of the things
25 they say about tobacco and health.  They've got

1 a mark up there.
2       And it says -- it says:  Consider the
3 conclusions of the U.S. Surgeon General.
4 That's why you've got these reports.  They say,
5 rely on the Surgeon General.  They admit the
6 Surgeon General now is the place to go.
7       But here is what is more important.  The
8 best course of action for tobacco consumers
9 concerned about their health is to quit.
10       And then it says:  Minors shouldn't use
11 tobacco products, and adults who do not use or
12 have quit using products should not start.
13       So I'm scratching my head.  What is the
14 business of tobacco?  If this is sincere, as
15 opposed to insincere, as opposed to marketing
16 pap, then here is the question.  What business
17 are they in?
18       If what they do is something that they
19 recommend nobody do, and anyone who is doing it
20 should quit, then why are they in business?
21 Why are they making the cigarettes when they
22 said over and over again in the '60s, '70s, and
23 the '80s, if it's ever proven to be harmful,
24 we'll quit making it?
25       How different would the world be if they

1 had done that?  And how stronger would our
2 nation have been, because it weakens a nation
3 to kill off its citizenry 540 --
4       MR. COFER:  Objection, Your Honor,
5 improper argument.  Move to strike.
6       THE COURT:  Overruled.
7       MR. SCHLESINGER:  540,000 people a year.
8 You learned in this courtroom for the first
9 time a brand-new finding.  It isn't 484,000 a
10 year --
11       MR. COFER:  Objection, Your Honor.  For
12 the record, 401, 402, Williams-State Farm.
13 Lack of foundation.
14       THE COURT:  Overruled.
15       Go ahead.
16       MR. SCHLESINGER:  You learned a brand-new
17 fact in this courtroom, which is that it isn't
18 484,000.
19       I jumped ahead.  Don't look at that yet.
20 Finish this thought.
21       It's 540,000 a year, because there's new
22 research out.  I found this very interesting,
23 where a bunch of universities came out and
24 research, it got in the New York Times --
25       MR. COFER:  Objection, lack of

1 foundation.  There was no testimony about this.
2 There was an article in the New York Times.
3       THE COURT:  Overrule the objection.
4       Please, no speaking objections.
5       Go ahead.
6       MR. SCHLESINGER:  You heard about the
7 research in the New England Journal of
8 Medicine.  There's a fresh off-the-press report
9 in the New York Times.  Dr. Mannino talked
10 about it.  All of a sudden, it's 540,000 a
11 year.  That's 1400 people a day dying.
12       There's nothing we ever see on the
13 evening news that compares with the calamity of
14 cigarette-related death and destruction.
15 There's just nothing that compares to it.
16       It's weird what -- depending on what you
17 learn.  You guys have now joined and gone to
18 the College of Tobacco Knowledge.  Right?
19       You heard about the defense having the
20 Traveling Truth Squad and these words to try to
21 suggest that they were out to have the truth
22 when really they were confusing it.  But you've
23 learned stuff now that folks haven't learned.
24 And in realtime, right in this courtroom, fresh
25 information came in.

1       Cigarettes are even more dangerous and
2 deadly than imagined.  How much worse can it
3 get?
4       So believability of witnesses.  This is
5 an important instruction that was read.  I want
6 to reflect on a couple things, because you
7 heard different experts.  You heard our
8 experts, you heard their experts.
9       But you also heard our treatings.  And
10 remember, the treatings are independent
11 eyewitnesses.  They are standing on the corner
12 when a car wreck happens at the intersection,
13 and they are just saying what they saw.
14       Those treatings, Herrera, Patel, the rest
15 of them, the other folks whose record says
16 "tobacco addiction," they had nothing to do
17 with litigation.  Their record is organic.
18 It's natural.  It's credible.  It's believable.
19 It has no interest in the outcome of the
20 proceedings.  It's not about anything having to
21 do with a specially retained expert for a court
22 trial.
23       That record was chock full of references
24 to addiction.  Are you going to disagree with
25 the record that is the natural record of

1 doctors who cared about the patient as they
2 were treating him?
3       Of course he was addicted.  But the point
4 is, there's two kinds of witnesses and two
5 kinds of instructions for believability.  This
6 is how I say you are empowered.  You have the
7 right to do stuff.
8       You may say, wait a second.  I'm not a
9 doc.  I heard these docs testifying.  How do I
10 know?  Maybe I have to accept what they want to
11 say.
12       And I say, some of the doctors they
13 brought in were not worthy of belief, should be
14 rejected by you.
15       And guess what?  The Court empowers you
16 with this instruction right here, which is
17 different than the regular witnesses, which is
18 just what is their believability, what is their
19 lack of frankness, what interest do they have
20 in the outcome, what's their body language, how
21 do they look?
22       It isn't just what they say.  It's
23 everything about what you observe when you're
24 observing.  It's part of the reason why we
25 don't want you to get too deep -- caught up in

1 the notes.  It's because you've got to look at
2 people.  You've got to eyeball them.
3       The psychologists say 80 percent of
4 communication is nonverbal.  I mean, look at
5 me, I'm moving around like a spaz in front of
6 you guys.  So they say that communication could
7 be nonverbal.
8       But the point is this.  With an expert,
9 you can accept an expert's opinion.  You can
10 look at his credentials.
11       But here is what I like, the power.  You
12 can reject it.  Therefore, with all due respect
13 to witnesses that deserve to be rejected,
14 Dr. Dorce, I'm sorry to say, who comes here and
15 does what Dr. Proctor told you they always do,
16 and that is to deny anybody could be in the
17 Engle class.
18       And the logic is flawed.  Because the
19 logic is, oh, you could have quit.  Well, you
20 didn't quit.  If you didn't quit, you should
21 have quit.  You didn't quit.
22       It's got nothing to do with Engle.
23       MR. SEIDEN:  Objection, litigation.
24       THE COURT:  Overruled.  Go ahead.
25       MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's a misconstruction

1 of the dependence of nicotine, which is one of
2 the most highly addictive drugs anywhere.
3       In any event, you have the right to
4 reject.  That's the power.  I put that up
5 there.  I was looking for a straw man.  That's
6 a scarecrow.  But call it a straw man.  What is
7 a straw man?  A straw man is like a false
8 logical construct.
9       There's two of them I want to address.
10 The first one is, Dr. Dorce using the DSM-5.
11       Now, His Honor has not read you an
12 instruction.  You will not hear an instruction.
13 There is no law that says anything about the
14 DSM-5 being the applicable test that determines
15 addiction.
16       Here is what is really interesting.
17       If you had a motivation to not find
18 somebody addicted, what better book to go to
19 than the DSM-5, which doesn't have a diagnosis
20 of addiction?
21       It's like saying, Well, you know that
22 book, The Hobbit by Tolkien, he's not addicted
23 under that book.
24       Well, the DSM doesn't have addiction in
25 the book.  But every other test for addiction

1 that is in the Surgeon General '10, which has
2 an entire chapter starting on page 105 -- write
3 it down, read it, and read the summary in
4 there.  And the very first word is nicotine is
5 the fundamental reason people persist in using
6 tobacco products.  And this persistent use is
7 what contributes to the diseases in the book,
8 including emphysema and including lung cancer.
9       So using a book that doesn't diagnose
10 addiction because it doesn't have an addiction
11 diagnosis in the book, and then saying, I
12 couldn't find that person addicted in that
13 book, I'm like, I need a V8.  What are you
14 talking about?
15       That can't be possible.  You have to use
16 something that's relevant.  All things that
17 relate to addiction in this case overwhelmingly
18 point to dependence.
19       And here's the thing.  The Engle finding
20 says nicotine is addictive.  Well, the Engle
21 finding was a war and a trial that took a year,
22 where the defendants denied that it was
23 addictive.  Now the finding is it is addictive.
24 Those findings are binding on you.  And I say
25 you can -- and the instructions say they can't

1 be denied.  You must embrace them and
2 incorporate them.  Nicotine is addictive.
3       So when you get up and try to say, under
4 this book, which doesn't do addiction, I don't
5 see addiction, that is a reputation of the
6 Engle finding, which is the binding law on this
7 case.
8       MR. BIDEAU:  Object, Your Honor.
9 Misstates the law, and definition.
10       THE COURT:  Overruled.  Go ahead.
11       MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's a repudiation of
12 the binding Engle finding.
13       So you can think about that and apply
14 what we know the law is and find that it is
15 addictive.  And if not him, who?  Because this
16 man smoked an awful lot.
17       Something else is, when you smoke despite
18 harmful consequences, that's a key indication
19 of addiction.
20       So dependence on nicotine, the drug, I
21 think is clear.
22       The straw man is the DSM-5, trying to say
23 that's what is applicable.
24       Here is another straw man.  Something
25 very interesting.  I'll do this very quickly

1 with you.  You remember, remember
2 communication, nonverbal.  Okay.
3       Dr. Proctor -- no, Seidman, first medical
4 expert.  Well-credentialed.  He wrote books on
5 addiction.  So they could say, Hey, didn't you
6 say in this book people are addicted.
7       Dr. Dorce doesn't have a book on
8 addiction.  We could have seen the position if
9 she had a book or a paper or research on
10 addiction.  She testified even in violation of
11 her own society of addiction medicine rules --
12       MR. COFER:  Objection, Your Honor.
13       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- against having --
14       THE COURT:  Hold on, hold on, sir.
15       MR. COFER:  Improper argument about
16 Dr. Dorce's testimony.
17       THE COURT:  Overruled.  Argument.
18       Go ahead.
19       MR. SCHLESINGER:  She testified against
20 the ASAM, just like Dr. Andrews testified
21 against the ATS guidelines.
22       Why do medical health organizations have
23 guidelines discouraging doctors that are
24 members from involving themselves with tobacco?
25 It's to avoid the insidious and undermining

1 effect of tobacco, because of the historical
2 way in which they would infiltrate healthcare
3 institutions --
4       MR. BIDEAU:  Objection, lack of
5 foundation.
6       THE COURT:  Overruled.  Go ahead.
7       MR. SCHLESINGER:  It would infiltrate
8 healthcare institutions and create either a
9 sign of credibility for tobacco companies or
10 research that was distraction or confusing.
11 And that's what Dr. Proctor talked about so
12 extensively with you.
13       But the other scarecrow here is this.
14 I've got to do it quick, because I'm on limited
15 time.
16       So, Dr. Seidman is on the witness stand.
17 Now Dr. Seidman is being cross-examined.  Now
18 remember, we go first, they go last.  You've
19 got to keep an open mind so that they get to
20 tell their side of the story, right?  And we
21 get to go first.  We're telling our side of the
22 story.  But on cross-examination they get to
23 tell their side of the story, too, a little
24 bit.
25       So the first cross-examination of a

1 treating or an expert doctor on addiction was
2 Seidman.  And the defense counsel, that
3 represents the cigarette industry, says:  You
4 didn't treat him.  If he was so addicted and
5 you're such a caring doctor, why didn't you
6 treat him?
7       Now a jury is sitting there, may not know
8 the ins and outs of that and they hear the body
9 language, the tone, the tenor, the voice and
10 say, yeah, man.  Why didn't you treat him?
11       Because it sounds like someone is
12 indignant and impairing the credibility of the
13 witness.  Well, if you really care, why didn't
14 you treat him?
15       Now let's unpack that.  That's a word
16 people like to use here.  Let's unpack that.
17 Why didn't you, hired as a forensic expert with
18 no treatment relation with the patient, not
19 licensed to practice your psychological medical
20 services in the state of Florida, violate your
21 ethical obligations and insinuate yourself into
22 the care when your only basis was to come here
23 and give expert testimony to help a jury
24 understand the medically complicated subject
25 such as addiction?

1       It wasn't until Dr. Dorce got up on the
2 witness stand that we took away that straw man.
3 The straw man being he should have treated, and
4 by not treating, you guys should think his
5 credibility is impaired.
6       And Mr. Gdanski, right out of the box,
7 said to Dr. Dorce.  You didn't treat him?  No.
8 You would never treat him?  No.  You know the
9 forensic experts and folks who are coming to be
10 experts from out of state --
11       MR. COFER:  Your Honor, sidebar?
12       THE COURT:  Sidebar.
13       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Will you hold my time,
14 Judge?
15       (The following discussion was held at
16       sidebar:)
17       MR. COFER:  Your Honor.
18       THE COURT:  Gentlemen, gentlemen.
19       MR. COFER:  We need an instruction that
20 the defense experts cannot contact the
21 plaintiff, because the plaintiff is represented
22 by counsel.  It would be improper, unless you
23 have the CME, which did happen.
24       However, their experts are retained by
25 Mr. Caprio through their lawyers.  So, of

1 course, they can do whatever they want to do.
2 That's the difference.
3       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Except there is no
4 evidence of that in the case.
5       THE COURT:  Hold on, Mr. Schlesinger.
6 You'll get your opportunity.
7       MR. COFER:  That's the difference.  They
8 have now misled the jury.  Legally we can't
9 contact the plaintiff.  Their experts can.
10       So we at least need that instruction,
11 that the defense experts, defense lawyers
12 cannot talk to or contact the plaintiff,
13 because they don't represent them.
14       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Fair comment on the
15 evidence.  I'm definitely inferring from the
16 evidence, only commenting on the evidence.
17       MR. COFER:  He's making fun of me and
18 attacking my credibility.
19       THE COURT:  I'm going to overrule the
20 objection.  Hold on.  Deny the request, and I
21 suspect you're going to ask if you can do this.
22       MR. COFER:  I can address it in closing.
23       THE COURT:  Sure.
24       MR. COFER:  Okay, fair enough.
25       (Sidebar discussion concluded, and the

1       following was held in open court:)
2       MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'm going to start my
3 time again, Judge.  Thank you.
4       So that's the other straw man, is to
5 intimate that there's some reason why someone
6 should have treated, when their own expert
7 acknowledged that no expert involved in these
8 cases would be treating or insinuating
9 themselves or anything like that.
10       So everything that Dr. Seidman did,
11 Dr. Mannino did was perfectly appropriate.  And
12 that was an apparent credibility attack that
13 doesn't have validity.  And you can think about
14 that.
15       And by the way, this is a mousetrap.
16 Okay.  Here is what I say.  Build a better
17 mousetrap and the world will beat a path to
18 your door.
19       Dr. Proctor has achieved the status of
20 scholarship, Harvard University, full professor
21 at Stanford, he teaches on tobacco.
22       Where is his book?  He's got a book that
23 he published that's -- an incredible work of
24 scholarship, highly valid.  Anybody can read
25 it.  You guys can't read it now, but after

1 this, when the trial is over, anyone can study
2 anything they want and develop a story.
3       One of the interesting things with this
4 book, okay, that Dr. Proctor -- and it makes
5 the man a hero.  He is an advocate for public
6 health.  He is a big contributor to the Surgeon
7 General reports, and what he's doing, he's
8 doing the right kind of work.
9       But what is interesting is that they did
10 not challenge him with a single solitary word
11 out of this 800-page book, with footnotes,
12 heavily footnoted, all referenced to tons of
13 internal documents, the scholarship of the
14 secrets of the industry, made open.
15       It will take decades for scholars to
16 fully digest the 60 million pages, and that
17 doesn't include the ones that Dr. Proctor said
18 were destroyed.
19       So this is an interesting element in the
20 case.  They talked to Dr. Proctor.  He seemed
21 agreeable with them.  He gave them the points
22 they wanted.  Yeah, there was this, there was
23 that.  But they never once took a word out of
24 this book and tried to discredit him.  I
25 thought that was important.

1       Build a better mousetrap and the world
2 will beat a path to your door.  Why do I say
3 that?  Because it's a false equivalency to put
4 an expert witness on the witness stand such as
5 Andrews or Dorce, who don't have a dedicated
6 specialty and haven't committed their life to
7 helping smokers or researching nicotine or
8 understanding the scourge of diseases, and then
9 say, Well, Dr. Proctor made money.
10       Well, he earned that money.  You know,
11 you earn money if you do something spectacular,
12 if you dedicate your life to something, and
13 then it turns out that what you did fulfills a
14 need, as it does in this litigation across the
15 state with all these Engle smokers.
16       It fulfills the need one case at a time.
17 He's teaching jurors one jury at a time.  He
18 built a better mousetrap.  The world has beat a
19 path to his door.
20       It's a false equivalency to say that
21 Dr. Dorce was button-holed by a friend of the
22 tobacco industry, with no specialty in nicotine
23 addiction, and comes in and becomes an expert
24 and earns a tremendous amount of money.
25       There's two different purposes behind

1 one.  One is a man who has paid his dues,
2 certainly deserves to make money.  Making good
3 money, doing good work.  And the other is
4 someone who perhaps, you can consider the money
5 is a motivation to do something that doesn't
6 meet with credibility.
7       Dr. Andrews, it looks to me like he
8 joined the ATS, which prohibited -- he worked
9 for tobacco, and in the aftermath, he quit the
10 ATS because on balance at $900,000 and
11 counting, the money was more important than the
12 professional society that dedicates its members
13 to the helping of sick people.
14       So that's something to think about.  And
15 by the way, this book, all three of these
16 books, look at the beginning of the book.
17 There's pages and pages and pages of
18 contributors, professors, scientists, public
19 health officials; a universe of them.
20       Why couldn't the tobacco industry bring
21 one of those witnesses in who really dedicated
22 their lives to cigarette issues and nicotine
23 addiction, or any of that?  Out of a universe?
24 Because uniformly the truth is what you heard
25 from Mannino and Seidman and Patel and Herrera.

1       And Herrera --
2       MR. BIDEAU:  Objection, Your Honor,
3 improper argument.
4       THE COURT:  Overruled.
5       Go ahead.
6       MR. SCHLESINGER:  I dug Herrera, because
7 he was like, let's cut through all this, you
8 know, chitchat.  He wasn't like a guy in a depo
9 room with lawyers talking all that formality.
10 He was bam bam, straight to the point.  He said
11 nicotine is one of the most addictive,
12 dangerous and lethal legal drugs on the market.
13       Let's talk about legality.
14       In Engle, those findings of a dangerous
15 product, unreasonably dangerous, and findings
16 of culpability for fraud and conspiracy and
17 lying to the American public about the dangers.
18 That's not legal.
19       And in addition to that, those are
20 violations of law.  That's why we're here.
21 Those are liability fault findings.  And in
22 addition to that, when it comes to kids under
23 18, it's not legal to sell them to kids under
24 18.  And that's what 90 percent of the business
25 is.

1       So here is the ASAM guideline.  Don't
2 take money from tobacco.  Despite that, their
3 expert did.  They say it's a conflict.
4       Dr. Dorce disagreed with everybody.  Here
5 is the American Thoracic Society.  It's a
6 conflict of interest to have a relationship
7 with the tobacco company, but these experts did
8 that.  Trying to avoid that insidious effect
9 that tobacco companies have on legitimate
10 science, which Dr. Proctor testified about.
11       Then we get to punitive damages.  And you
12 must decide if punitive damages are warranted
13 as punishment to the defendants and as
14 deterrent to others.
15       The Engle findings are all here.  And
16 number 4 is fraud, number 5 is conspiracy.
17 Because they all work together.  Remember, the
18 TIRC, the TI, the CTR, the Tobacco Institute,
19 the Tobacco Industry Research Council, the
20 Center for Tobacco Research, these were all
21 co-conspirators, found out to be in Engle.  So
22 defendants include all of those guys.
23       So all of those statements that you heard
24 from the industry spokesmen that were really a
25 defensive front, a shield, they were sham

1 organizations.  They were all co-conspirators.
2 What is important here, though, it says -- and
3 you'll have these back there to read -- but
4 that these findings show that these misleading
5 statements, what was withheld was entered with
6 the intention that smokers and members of the
7 public relied to their detriment.
8       So what they did was, with the doubt
9 campaign, they did something that was designed
10 to make sure folks would keep smoking.  Because
11 as long as you keep smoking, we keep selling
12 cigarettes.  And selling cigarettes and making
13 profits by the billions is really what we're
14 all about.  Even if it derogates the common
15 human decency of looking out for the health of
16 people.
17       So, punitive damages are warranted.
18       And it talks about clear and convincing
19 evidence standard, which is different than the
20 greater weight of the evidence.
21       Here is the greater weight of the
22 evidence.  As far as is Ed a member of the
23 Engle class?  Yes, he is.  If on balance, if
24 the scales tip slightly in our favor what
25 weighs more, what sways me more, he's a member

1 of the Engle class.  That's all there is to it.
2       This isn't a criminal case where someone
3 is trying to raise a doubt.  Doubt.  If you
4 think he's probably a member of the Engle
5 class.  If I was a betting man, 55, 60, 75, 80
6 percent member of the Engle class.  Maybe
7 there's a 5 or 10 percent chance.  Maybe
8 there's some expert.  I heard some things, I'm
9 not sure.
10       In a civil case, the benefit of the doubt
11 is resolved in favor of Ed Caprio.  So that if
12 you think he probably belongs, and the greater
13 weight of the evidence, that which weighs more
14 and sways me more, he's a member of the Engle
15 class.  I'm not going to spend too much time on
16 it, because I feel the evidence is overwhelming
17 that he is, and you're going to find him to be.
18       And then you're going to have to work on
19 the percentage of fault.
20       And the most important question for me is
21 that we get a chance to discuss punishment for
22 past wrongdoings, unacknowledged.  No
23 contrition.
24       Some folks say, listen, tomorrow it's
25 going to be Friday.  You're going to be

1 deliberating.  If I go for punitive damages,
2 I'm going to have to come back and listen to
3 these guys for more.
4       But you know what?  Out of many -- there
5 were many called, few were chosen.  You all
6 were chosen.  And we feel confident that you
7 won't shirk your responsibility by saying, I
8 was going to agree that they need punitive
9 damages, but I want to get out of here, so I'm
10 not going to do it.
11       We don't even have the first compunction
12 or concern that you guys would ever do that.
13 We're not worried about that.  You're going to
14 do what is right.  You have been responsible in
15 this regard.  We trust you in that regard.
16       And you have no stake in this outcome.
17 You were an independent, neutral, calm, cool
18 dispassionate, deliberative body.  That's all
19 we want.
20       So, anyway, reckless indifference.
21 You'll hear about that.
22       What should we be doing?  Let's cure
23 cancer.  Let's not cause cancer.  Let's cure
24 emphysema.  Let's not cause emphysema.
25       Those were some really smart scientists.

1 Those conspirators were some smart scientists.
2       Claude Teague was real smart.  What would
3 have happened if they had dedicated their lives
4 to doing human, decent things to help people?
5       Can you imagine?  Wow.  Where would we
6 have been, if it had been a cooperative effort
7 to benefit the public health, as opposed to a
8 fiendish manipulation of nicotine to addict
9 children and then replace them when they
10 invariably died prematurely from very horrible
11 diseases that don't --
12       MR. BIDEAU:  Objection, improper.
13       THE COURT:  Overruled.
14       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- that don't end in a
15 peaceful death in any way, shape or form?
16       So we say a motivation of a responsible
17 person would be cure, don't cause.  And they
18 could have done that.
19       How -- how about this?  How about we
20 product children and don't addict them?  Is
21 that a laudable goal?  Is that reasonable?
22       Shouldn't we be protecting children and
23 not addicting them; not putting them down the
24 path to make them a 20-, 30-, 40-year customer,
25 so that you can grind these kids through this

1 process of addiction leading to horrible
2 diseases and death and use them as replacement
3 smokers?
4       It's callous, it's cynical.  A
5 replacement smoker for those leaving the
6 market.
7       Now, here is another thing.  There's an
8 instruction which says that the corporation has
9 the rights of people.  Okay?
10       So, in your deliberations consider the
11 rights of people.  Well, I've got a great
12 answer for that.  They are human, but they're
13 not humane.  Because if you have the rights of
14 a person, then you should also execute the
15 responsibilities of a person, and you should
16 not act indecently towards your fellow man.
17       So I say, if you want to be treated like
18 a person, act like a person.
19       Do they have a soul?  Do they have the
20 nurturing spirit for their fellow man?
21       Do they pursue those goals that we like
22 to see in the best of American citizens, that
23 they care and they try to help?  And I say no.
24 I say what has been revealed in these documents
25 is that they are human, but they are not

1 humane.
2       Here is one of the things you see.  What
3 are they about?  They are about money.  That is
4 what they are about.
5       Now, in this case you are saying, well,
6 Ed Caprio is asking for money.  But the point
7 is, today you are going to speak to them in the
8 only language they understand, and that's
9 money.  And that's the only tool the law gives
10 you at your disposal.
11       And sure, you heard a lot of evidence,
12 because one of the rules we don't have is that
13 the jurors can raise their hand and say:
14 Enough already.  We got it.  I got it.  I heard
15 you.
16       If you guys could have put your hand up
17 and said, We know enough evidence now to
18 deliberate, if that rule was in place, maybe
19 that case would have been over sooner.  But we
20 don't know.
21       What we do know is:  Who ain't for more
22 money?  Even back in the '60s, they are talking
23 about, of course cigarette smoke is a drug.
24       But dangerous FDA implications to go
25 beyond these walls.

1       Here is really what it's all about.
2 Let's get to that.  What is it really all
3 about?
4       What is this corporate human?  What is
5 this corporate human's lifeblood?  What flows
6 through the tobacco industry's veins?
7       Green money.
8       What did Dr. Proctor say?  Why do they
9 keep doing this?  He goes:  Greed, I guess.
10       This is something we are asking you to
11 consider as being reprehensible.  Indecent.  In
12 the nature of an atrocity.  To addict a child
13 and trade his golden years of life to replace
14 him with additional children, in a business
15 that is based solely and exclusively on youth.
16       What is Oscar Wilde?  I think it's the
17 Picture of Dorian Gray.  That's the book.
18 Oscar Wilde, who was interesting, he was a
19 homosexual writer.  Famous homosexual writer.
20 Isn't that interesting?  We are in a courtroom,
21 how times change.  Used to be if someone said
22 they were homosexual in a courtroom, they would
23 go to jail.  There were anti-sodomy laws.
24       Now the world is changing. We are in a
25 courtroom in another setting.  And we're

1 looking at someone who is a minority, but who
2 has someone he loves, who has a partner in
3 life.  And it's normal.
4       And I feel no prejudice in this courtroom
5 from the defense lawyers, from the witnesses,
6 from anybody.  We've accepted it, and we're
7 moving along.  That's progressive, and that's
8 good.
9       But what did they say?  What did Oscar
10 Wilde say?  In The Picture of Dorian Gray,
11 which by the way, The Picture of Dorian Gray is
12 a great analogy for the tobacco industry,
13 because The Picture of Dorian Gray was -- does
14 anyone know what that is?  Anyone know The
15 Picture of Dorian Gray?
16       It was a story by Oscar Wilde, great
17 writer, playwright.  Where he, the guy, Dorian
18 Gray, was like a debaucher.  He was a bad -- he
19 was out doing all kinds of terrible things in
20 his community, back in the Victorian era, or
21 wherever he was, on his horse.  He was doing
22 bad things to people, lots of bad stuff.
23       But he looked great.  He looked clean and
24 beautiful.  Presenting to the public, he was a
25 smooth and beautiful guy.  But at home in his

1 mansion, on the wall was his portrait.  And it
2 was rotting.  It was rotting.  The evilness of
3 what his conduct was, which didn't show on him,
4 internally, in secret, in his mansion, on his
5 wall, that picture would show, over time, a
6 deterioration.  That's The Picture of Dorian
7 Gray.
8       In some ways, the tobacco industry is
9 saying:  Wait.  They look beautiful.  They look
10 pretty.  There's models, there's actors,
11 there's great colors of package products that
12 look like everything else, and, you know, are
13 indistinguishable from normal consumer
14 products.
15       I mean, look at this stuff.  Here is a
16 pack of cigarettes.  Pall Mall.  Look at the
17 colors.  And then look at how the colors match
18 up with every other normal consumer product.
19 Everything around the same size.
20       It hides in plain sight.  Here is a
21 Batman.
22       How are you supposed to know this stuff
23 is bad?  A six-year-old boy walks up to his
24 father and holds up a pack of these cigarettes
25 and says, Dad, what are these?

1       And the father, dutifully trying to
2 protect his son, says, They're bad.
3       Dad:  Those are bad.
4       And you know what the six-year-old son
5 says?  They don't look bad.  They look nice.
6 Some of them have a nice camel on the cover.
7 Just like a little toy camel the kid has.
8       How do you teach them it's bad?  It looks
9 like a normal consumer product.  How do you
10 team them that?  And what do they say?
11       What is the cigarette?  It is exquisite
12 and it leaves one unsatisfied.
13       What does that mean?  We kept hearing
14 about satisfaction, right?  Pleasure, taste,
15 satisfaction.  You saw the ads.  You heard
16 about the ads.  We heard about all of that.
17       But what does it really mean?  Cigarettes
18 leave you unsatisfied, because smokers are
19 addicted, and the nicotine wears off.  And
20 you're not smoking to feel better; you're
21 smoking to avoid the effects of withdrawal, the
22 jitteriness that happens when in a few minutes
23 to 30 minutes, the cigarette and the nicotine
24 begins to wear off.
25       So here's the truth, internally.  Let us

1 hope our addicted customers stay unsatisfied,
2 and then what will the effect of that addiction
3 be?
4       All we'll need is a bigger bag of money
5 to carry to the bank -- a larger bag of money
6 to carry to the bank.
7       This is what it's really about.  You can
8 decide, hey, I don't think that meets with the
9 bounds of moral decency.  I find it to be
10 reprehensible.
11       So the case is about Ed Caprio much more,
12 because you may consider harm suffered by other
13 persons not party to this lawsuit in assessing
14 the reprehensibility or wrongfulness of the
15 defendants' acts.
16       That's why we talked about 20 million
17 other deaths.
18       So, when you talk about what they did to
19 Ed and what happened to him and how he believed
20 and how he was duped, you can make the
21 decision, by clear and convincing evidence, no
22 confusion, that punitive damages are warranted
23 as to Ed.
24       And when you deliberate on the punitive
25 damages, it will be as to Ed.  It won't be as

1 to everybody.
2       But whether or not this industry, a
3 non-contrite industry should be punished, you
4 can consider harms to others.
5       Now remember.  Remember that lung cancer
6 line going up that matched the cigarette sales
7 line?
8       You know, that's not just a statistical
9 line.  That's mothers and fathers and aunties
10 and grandparents and brothers and sisters and
11 folks who suffered.  And not just the people
12 that actually were sick, but their loved ones.
13       The toll that tobacco exerts is amazing.
14 Elton John's got a song.  Mona Lisas and Mad
15 Hatters.  It's got a line in there:  "I thought
16 I knew, but now I know."
17       You all came in here and maybe you
18 thought you knew something about it.  But now
19 maybe you know something different.  Because a
20 lot of folks don't know the truth of what the
21 tobacco industry really was all these years.
22       So, 20 million people.  That's a lot of
23 people.
24       And I say the numbers numb.  You know,
25 one or two deaths is a tragedy; 100 deaths is a

1 statistic.  Folks have that.
2       How do you wrap your mind around a case
3 where you guys are called upon to take
4 responsibility for deciding punitive damages
5 and harm to others?  We are talking about
6 20 million deaths.
7       MR. COFER:  Objection, Your Honor.  401,
8 403, State Farm.  Improper argument.
9       THE COURT:  Overruled.  Go ahead, sir.
10       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Take a look at our
11 great state of Florida.  I'm born and raised
12 here.
13       Now, from Key West to St. Augustine, to
14 Pensacola, Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Eustis,
15 Arcadia, Zolfo Springs, Hardee County, you name
16 it, from one end of the state to the other.
17 You name it.  I want you to picture in your
18 mind --
19       MR. COFER:  Objection, Your Honor.
20 Improper argument, Williams, State Farm.  401.
21 403.
22       THE COURT:  Overruled.
23       Go ahead.
24       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thank you.
25       And imagine that no matter where you went

1 in the state of Florida right now, that that
2 entire state was empty.  There wasn't a single
3 living, breathing human soul anywhere, from one
4 end of the state to the other, no matter where
5 you drove, no matter what school you went to --
6       MR. COFER:  May we approach?
7       THE COURT:  Hold on, sir.
8       MR. COFER:  May we approach?
9       THE COURT:  Sure.
10       (The following discussion was held at
11       sidebar:)
12       MR. COFER:  I move for mistrial.
13       He's now basically said we exterminated
14 the state of Florida.
15       This is Ed Caprio's case.  You cannot
16 punish for harm to others.  You can only
17 consider harm to others in reprehensibility if
18 it's the same conduct that also harmed Ed
19 Caprio.  That's Williams-State Farm.
20       He's made no nexus between all these
21 other people that may or may not have died and
22 all the circumstances.
23       But this argument got so incredibly
24 prejudicial.  He's now basically said we killed
25 the entire state of Florida.  Improper

1 argument, pandering, inflaming the jury.  It's
2 outrageous.
3       I've objected several times.  You
4 permitted it.  At this point, we need a
5 mistrial.
6       MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's not close to it.
7 I didn't say they killed anyone in Florida.  I
8 was trying to give them context for the
9 magnitude of 20 million.
10       THE COURT:  I'm going to deny the request
11 for a mistrial.
12       MR. COFER:  Can we at least have a
13 standing objection?
14       MR. SCHLESINGER:  He already ruled.
15       THE COURT:  Hold on.
16       MR. COFER:  Can we at least sustain the
17 objection, tell the jury to disregard, and have
18 him move on?
19       THE COURT:  No.
20       MR. COFER:  This is outrageous.
21       (Sidebar discussion concluded, and the
22       following was held in open court:)
23       MR. SCHLESINGER:  If I may, start my time
24 up, Judge?  May I continue?
25       THE COURT:  Sure.  We have about another

1 20 minutes, and then we'll take a break.
2       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.
3       So, continuing on.  The point I'm trying
4 to make is, there are 20 million people in the
5 state of Florida now.  Imagine there was nobody
6 in the state of Florida.
7       I'm trying to give you a sense of the
8 magnitude of loss from 1964 to the present of
9 20 million folks dying prematurely and
10 needlessly from a tobacco epidemic perpetuated
11 and sustained by an industry.  That's how
12 significant that loss is.
13       And you know what?  America is this
14 industry's ashtray.  They stub out 540,000
15 lives per year --
16       MR. BIDEAU:  Objection, Your Honor.
17       THE COURT:  Overruled.  Go ahead.
18       MR. SCHLESINGER:  America is this
19 industry's ashtray.  They stub out 540,000
20 lives a year, for money?
21       You know, we've lost the attention to it.
22 We hear so many things, but we've lost the
23 attention to it.
24       This is an attempt by me to persuade you
25 to talk, but also I want you to say, I want you

1 to think, we are seeing things as they are, the
2 truth of what the tobacco scourge really is.
3       And then we talked about truth and
4 consequences.
5       And so, when it comes to punishment, you
6 know, when you sell a product to millions of
7 people, the truth matters.  Okay?
8       When your greed causes devastating
9 consequences for millions of your fellow
10 Americans, there should be consequences for
11 you.  There should be consequences for
12 companies that engineer their products for
13 addiction, target children and teens in order
14 to addict them, choose to keep selling
15 addiction as part of a defective product.
16       Because remember, this is, according to
17 the Engle findings, a defective product,
18 unreasonably dangerous.  It's unreasonably
19 dangerous, more dangerous than it needs to be.
20 Dr. Proctor said:  Make it uninhalable.  Take
21 it out of the hands of anyone under 25 years of
22 age, and you would have a much different
23 situation.  Or ban it altogether.  Okay?
24       But it's an unreasonably dangerous
25 product.  More dangerous than it needs to be.

1 That's a finding in this case.
2       When you trivialize the power of
3 addiction, when you don't tell the truth about
4 a dangerous and defective product, when you
5 know full well about it, and when you
6 deceitfully offer up false illusions of safety
7 for a deadly product.  This is about truth and
8 consequences.
9       It's about the truth and how they need to
10 tell it, when, in fact, they butchered the
11 truth.  And consequences.  And they need to
12 face them.
13       And punishment, has been said by
14 Augustine, to be justice for the unjust.
15       They are not supposed to like it.  They
16 are supposed to be punished because you all
17 have made that conclusion that they deserve to
18 be punished.
19       So they say right here, our basic
20 position?  The cigarette controversy is subject
21 to the charge and may be subject to findings
22 that we are making false or misleading
23 statements to the promote the sale of
24 cigarettes.
25       So they say, years ago, in 1968:  We are

1 lying, and we're going to get caught lying, and
2 we're going to get busted for it.
3       They knew internally they were lying to
4 the American public, but they decided to do so
5 for their business.
6       And this jury instruction talks about how
7 do you get to punitive damages.How do you
8 arrive at the justification to exact a penalty
9 for this pack, this pack of lies, a pack of
10 lies is all this is.  How do you get to that
11 point?
12       Some of the things is that there's a
13 little bit higher standard.  It isn't just the
14 greater weight.  It must be without confusion.
15 Lacking in confusion.
16       You will have the instruction.  You can
17 read the whole thing.  I'm saving time.  Let's
18 talk about lack of confusion.
19       There is no doubt about the doubt.
20 Right?  They created a doubt campaign.  They
21 pursued a doubt campaign.  They made it so that
22 folks wouldn't know.  It's unproven.  Nobody
23 knows.  We have to wait to see.
24       There is no doubt about the doubt.  We've
25 got records and documents that you saw.  I'll

1 show you some.
2       There's also no confusion about the
3 confusion.  Remember, are we going to arrive at
4 this jury instruction without confusion?  Sure,
5 there's no confusion about that.  What isn't
6 there confusion about?  That's what is funny.
7 The confusion.  The confusion that was the
8 business model of the tobacco industry.
9       Where do they say it?  Obviously, the key
10 word is "confusion."  This is their internal
11 document from 1966, as part of the conspiracy.
12 Started in 1954.  He felt into their
13 conspiracy, started smoking in 1958 as a
14 15-year-old.  What chance did he have?
15       There were no warnings on a pack of
16 cigarettes when he was smoking.  And even the
17 first one wasn't even a warning.  It was a
18 caution.  Maybe cigarettes could be hazardous
19 to your health.
20       Maybe they aren't.
21       The poor man falls into addiction at the
22 age of 15, when the pediatric brain is the most
23 susceptible and exquisitely sensitive to the
24 addiction of nicotine, and he becomes an addict
25 for all those years.

1       So there is no confusion about the
2 confusion.  Anything we can do to confirm such
3 a situation works to our advantage.  And there
4 is no doubt about the doubt.
5       How is this?  What about this?
6       Doubt is our product.  They sell
7 cigarettes, they make cigarettes, they
8 fabricate them.  They manufacture them.  They
9 juice them up with sugar and ammonia compounds
10 to freebase crack nicotine that goes to the
11 brain and makes the maximum amount of addiction
12 possible.
13       And they say:  Doubt is our product.
14 Because it competes with the body of fact.  We
15 are competing with facts.  And it's a means of
16 establishing a controversy.
17       They admit that TIRC and all those things
18 were defensive operations and front
19 organizations, and they would be in a
20 deplorable position.
21       And they say, now that folks are hearing
22 it's bad for you in '64, we will put the phony
23 filter on it.  The phony filter, which not only
24 didn't it help; it made things worse.  Filter
25 cancer.  Adenocarcinoma.  The new scourge of

1 addictive cigarettes, the drug of cigarettes
2 today.
3       These are things that help you know, hey,
4 we meet the obligations under the clear and
5 convincing standard.
6       Here is what I want to say.  There is no
7 doubt about the doubt.  There is no confusion
8 about the confusion.  Is that clear?
9       I think it is.  I hope you'll find that
10 it is.
11       Then they misled about filters.  Filters
12 were a fraud, they were a marketing gimmick.
13 They were the health reassurance campaign.  In
14 the '50s, when the health scare came out, they
15 needed to come up with a psychological crutch.
16 So they put stuff on and said, they are getting
17 just as much tar and filter, but they abandoned
18 the cigarette on grounds of reduced risk to
19 health.
20       What is it really about?  The illusion of
21 filtration.
22       What are they really saying?  We will
23 advertise and say here is the super duper,
24 super extra you-know-what 5,000 filter that's
25 capability of taking out anything bad, and a

1 nice jolt of nicotine.
2       And what does the Surgeon General say?
3 Here is a few pages you may want to read in
4 this good book.  I call this one of the "good
5 books" because it's good in a lot of ways.
6 Page 16, page 17, page 20, tells you the whole
7 story about the filter fraud and how they faked
8 out the Surgeon General for decades, and they
9 had to admit that the new designs were used by
10 the tobacco industry as a tool to undermine
11 prevention and cessation efforts.
12       So they fooled and duped the Surgeon
13 General, as well.
14       And then this is the National Cancer
15 Monograph.  That's in evidence as well.  And it
16 talks about the lights being the same kind of
17 fraud.  Give folks a psychological crutch.
18 Keep them smoking, because if they start
19 quitting, we're going to lose business.
20       Here is the scheme linking.  The only one
21 second on this is, hey, linkage isn't
22 causation.
23       I heard Dr. Dorce.  I thought that was
24 really parsing words.  I didn't think that
25 you'll find that that was very credible.

1 Chains linking together, associations,
2 causation.  Playing word games to avoid that.
3       Nicotine addiction leads to lung cancer.
4 That's the bottom line.  How do we know that?
5 Can we play?
6       (The video clip was played and taken down
7       to the best of the reporter's ability as
8       follows:)
9       VOICE:  We should also give priority to
10 the one addiction, tobacco addiction, that is
11 killing more than 300,000 Americans each year.
12       (Video clip concluded.)
13       MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is way back then,
14 in Koop.  The one addiction, tobacco addiction,
15 that is killing 300,000 Americans a year.
16       That's when those numbers were down
17 lower, back in those years.  Tobacco addiction
18 killing.  That is what is known as addiction
19 causation.  That's the consequence.
20       The addiction makes you smoke crazy
21 compulsive, hundreds of hits to the brain a day
22 of nicotine.  There is no other reason for
23 smoking.  Hard to wrap your mind around it,
24 because we live in the culture they created.
25       We are in the business of selling

1 nicotine.  It's a potent drug.  It's all about
2 nicotine, its addictive nature.  No one has
3 ever become a cigarette smoker without
4 nicotine.
5       And then they even say the cigarette is
6 not the product; the cigarette is the package.
7 The product is nicotine, and the cigarette pack
8 is a storage supply of a day's supply of
9 nicotine.
10       Cigarette is a nicotine delivery device,
11 one of the most craftily designed small devices
12 on the planet.
13       This here, this package here, has been
14 sold more than any other packaged product in
15 the history of human civilization.  The most
16 successful advertising campaign, the most
17 recognizable logo.  And what's the leg up?
18 They're selling an addictive drug.  Gives them
19 a nice leg up.
20       Anyway.  And the Surgeon General is very
21 clear.  It isn't free choice.  You can't say Ed
22 chose, Ed chose, Ed chose, when everyone knows,
23 including their own internal memorandum.  Shook
24 Hardy reminds us, we can't defend a smoking and
25 health case as free choice if the person was

1 addicted.
2       That was in 1980, when they were denying
3 addiction.  That was before 1988, when Surgeon
4 General Koop declared the drug nicotine to be
5 so highly addictive as cocaine and heroin.
6 They were saying:  If it ever gets out that
7 it's addictive, we can't defend that someone is
8 making a free choice when they are addicted.
9       And they are.
10       Millions are caught in this web of
11 deceit.  As a matter of fact, Surgeon General
12 2014.  There is Ed.  Ed is the web.  There are
13 the defendants.
14       And here is what the Surgeon General
15 says.  Chief preventable killer with more than
16 40 million Americans caught in the web of
17 tobacco dependency.
18       Ladies and gentlemen, that's all of them,
19 or darned near all of them.  If there's 45
20 million smokers, 40 million is almost all the
21 smokers.  Because it is known that when you
22 smoke, you smoke for nicotine.  The drug gives
23 you a dependence.
24       Let's not keep talking about how a
25 million and a half or a million people a year

1 quit over the last 50 years, at a rate of
2 3 percent of the 50 million smokers that
3 ultimately added up to 50 or 60 million
4 quitters.
5       That's what the defense, the cigarette
6 attorneys, want to talk about.
7       Let's talk about the 50 million that are
8 smoking and the 40 million caught up in the
9 web, and the millions that have died, and the
10 1200 to 1400 that are going to die today.  And
11 the 50,000 that died during this trial.  As
12 many as died in the Vietnam war.  Let's talk
13 about them.  Let's hear from them about that.
14       But there's going to be blinders.  You
15 won't.
16       So how about this?  Philip Morris stood
17 in the way of nicotine cessation.  They didn't
18 want Ed to quit.  He was the perfect customer.
19 He used the product as they intended.  He
20 bought the product, he used their coupons, they
21 incentivized him.  He did everything they
22 wanted him to do.
23       Isn't it interesting to spend a couple
24 weeks in the courtroom with the tobacco company
25 saying, he should quit, he should quit, he

1 should quit.  When the last thing in the world
2 the tobacco company wants you to do is quit.
3       And when Merrell Dow first came out with
4 a way that maybe would help smokers quit, that
5 chewing gum, they went crazy, they boycotted
6 them, they blocked them, they said everything
7 about this gum is offensive to our business.
8 That's not an entity that cares about their
9 customers.
10       What if they really cared about their
11 customers?  What if they didn't ever let a
12 cigarette be sold to anyone under 25?  You had
13 to have behind the counter at the pharmacist
14 and IDs.  What if when a 30-year-old said, I'm
15 30 years old now, I've been smoking since I was
16 14 years old, I want to have a family, why
17 don't they say, You know what?  You're a great
18 customer.  We're going to help you quit.
19       What if they didn't sell to minors?  If
20 all smoking begins at adolescence and youth,
21 and they lost that business, because if you
22 don't start smoking by 25, you don't start
23 smoking.  They would lose 90 percent of their
24 business.  They'd have 10 percent left.
25       So they would only be making hundreds of

1 millions of dollars a year instead of billions
2 of dollars a year.  They would still have a
3 business.  Would that be more responsible?
4 Sure.  Could they have done that?  Sure.
5       These are the choices they chose to make.
6       Let's talk about who really is making
7 free choices.  Ed was an innocent, addicted.
8 Maybe his human frailties, his human weaknesses
9 were such that he was not maybe completely able
10 to try as hard as he could.  He should have
11 tried harder.
12       He got COPD.  They said:  You're sick,
13 you need to quit.  He tried hard to quit, but
14 he didn't.  But the fact that he couldn't quit
15 when he got sick is evidence of addiction.
16 Substantial impairment demonstrated by
17 continued use despite harmful consequences.
18       Robert Heimann said it wasn't injurious.
19 And he said:  Smokers are justified in relying
20 on our statements.
21       So was Ed.  They didn't tell the truth to
22 Ed.  What about the stuff they concealed?  If
23 they had told him the truth about it, would it
24 have been important?  Would it have been
25 material?  If they got up in said, in 1964, you

1 know, you're right.  This is a dangerous
2 problem.  We're killing people.
3       How different would it have been?  I'm
4 going fast.
5       A quarter trillion dollars,
6 250,000 million dollars, since the '60s, on
7 advertising that supposedly has no effect.
8       Well, look at page 618 in Surgeon General
9 '12 where Tyler Foote, a famous advertising
10 guy, says tobacco companies trying to maintain
11 that advertising doesn't work, that's utter
12 nonsense.
13       By the way, we also heard something --
14 and this is important -- on peer pressure.
15 There are pages in this, 2012, I hope you'll
16 get to, where the tobacco companies' marketing
17 practices create peer pressure.  They are the
18 ones that create the peer pressure.
19       They want people to smoke.  And then for
20 it to be like a communicable infectious
21 disease, for everybody else to smoke.  That's
22 good for business, when smokers beget more
23 smokers.  But it's in the culture they have
24 created.
25       So I said:  Protect children, don't

1 addict them.
2       And then here is all the youth marketing.
3 Which they've never admitted, except for
4 Bennett Lebow.  Today's teenager, tomorrow's
5 regular customer.
6       The smoking patterns of teenagers are
7 particularly important to Philip Morris.
8       The success of Philip Morris Red during
9 its rapid growth was it's the brand of choice
10 among teenagers, who stuck with it as they grow
11 older.
12       What did Dr. Robert Fulton say in the
13 book, Everything I Need to Know I Learned in
14 Kindergarten?
15       He said:  Play nice.  Don't hurt people.
16 If you do, say you're sorry.  Be decent to
17 people, not indecent.
18       This isn't decent.  This is
19 reprehensibility.  This is atrocious
20 misconduct.
21       Then all through here, more documents.
22 The great bonanza to get the youth market.  The
23 14-to-24 age group, tomorrow's cigarette
24 business.
25       Oh, by the way, better get that word

1 "youth" out of there and throw "young adults"
2 in there.  From now on, 12-year-olds are young
3 adults.  Let's tell that to our 12-year-olds.
4 And now you're young adults.  Young lady, you
5 are a young adult now.  You can start smoking.
6       Younger adults have been a critical
7 factor in the growth and decline of every major
8 brand for the last 50 years.
9       That's Diane Burrows, it's in evidence.
10 Her whole chart starts with 12-year-olds
11 smoking.  Up to 10 percent of the 12-year-olds
12 are smoking in that chart.
13       And then Dr. Teague.  If we're going to
14 survive and prosper in the long term, we must
15 get our share of the youth market.
16       How can we induce a pre-smoker and a
17 non-smoker to become a habituated smoker?
18       How do you get someone who doesn't know
19 about nicotine to think of a valued image, or a
20 cool baseball player or something neat or some
21 rebellious act to take up that first puff?
22 Because that first puff starts the role of
23 addiction.
24       And then Joe Camel.  It's as young as you
25 get.  As young as you get.  Selling kids

1 cigarettes with cartoons.  There's the
2 12-year-old replacement smoker.  Talk about
3 cynical and callous.  We're losing customers
4 who are dying or quitting and then getting sick
5 and dying, and we're going to replace them with
6 12, 13, 14 years old.
7       Here it is.  It's about as young as you
8 can get.  That's Joe Camel. Okay?
9       And then this is a paper on nicotine,
10 Claude Teague.  You can read about it, that the
11 nicotine isn't important to the kids.  Right
12 there at says:  At the beginning they are free
13 to choose.  Plus, plus, plus, plus, plus.  But
14 at the end, negative.  You're not free to
15 choose.  You're not free to choose when you're
16 an addicted smoker.
17       Then this is referring to the kids as
18 crops.  Right?  Referring to the little kids
19 as -- the youth as a crop.  They dehumanize the
20 customer, while humanizing themselves, making
21 themselves out to be healthy and strong and
22 hale and well-met.
23       The youth is going to join with this crop
24 of prospects, like they're an orange to be like
25 squeezed and juiced and squeezed.  All that

1 profits out of them so there's a dried-up husk
2 and there's nothing left and your lungs are
3 rotted, or they've cut out your lungs, or two
4 lobes of your lung.
5       And then they said something when they
6 cut out his lungs about, oh, the only thing
7 that bothers him is he's got an itch on his
8 scar.  That was one of the cross-examinations.
9 You know, he's all better.  They cut out a
10 couple hunks of his lung, and the only thing
11 bothering him is a little itchy scar.
12       Come on.  You can't breathe when you have
13 emphysema and they take out a chunk of your
14 lung.  That's unreasonably -- saying he's not
15 hurt.  And he's terribly hurt.
16       So, here's a document I call the chiller.
17       THE COURT:  Five minutes.
18       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thank you.
19       This is Claude Teague.  Claude Teague
20 says:  We have deliberately played down the
21 role of nicotine.  Hence, the nonsmoker has
22 little or no knowledge of what satisfactions it
23 may offer him and no desire to try it.
24       Instead, we must convince him with wholly
25 irrational reasons that he just try smoking, in

1 the hopes that he will then discover -- that he
2 will for himself then discover the real
3 satisfactions obtainable.
4       Is that cold blooded?  Is that just cold
5 blooded?  That's why I call it the chiller,
6 because that is just somebody completely devoid
7 from the humanity of what he is saying that
8 articulates in a sentence what the business is.
9 The two-stage model.
10       Get the kid that thinks it's cool, and
11 then he's going to discover the real
12 satisfactions.  He's going to be hooked.
13       Why do you think fishermen use hooks?
14 The fish don't know there is a hook in there.
15 The fish doesn't want to get hooked.
16       That's a petri dish with bacteria growing
17 in it.  That's the peer pressure I was telling
18 you about.  All those peers, all those other
19 smokers, they are not smoking because the
20 bacteria is growing in a culture medium.  The
21 culture.  The culture medium.  They created the
22 culture, the environment in our country that
23 allowed the proliferation of smokers among
24 peers.
25       There's extensive scientific research

1 that explains that.  They created the culture.
2 That's how things grow and proliferate.
3       Without that warm nurturing environment
4 of advertising and assurances of health and
5 promises of glory to children and
6 rebelliousness to children, you're -- and the
7 food, the agar, medium in the food.  You don't
8 proliferate it.
9       They are the ones that create the peer
10 pressure.  They can't disappear in this
11 courtroom.  They are not flying colors.  You
12 don't see them flying their proud logo.  You're
13 not seeing this, what you see with advertising.
14 Because, as Dr. Proctor says, the tobacco
15 company, in a courtroom, would like to
16 disappear.
17       And this is Surgeon General 2012:  All
18 tobacco use begins during youth and young
19 adulthood.
20       Thousands of kids started today.  Every
21 day.  This is why you have a chance to say
22 something.  We reject this conduct.  You can be
23 a brick in the wall.  There is the song by ...
24       MR. GDANSKI:  Pink Floyd.
25       MR. COFER:  Pink Floyd.

1       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Pink Floyd.  Thank you.
2       That talks about another brick in the
3 wall.  You can't be another brick in the wall.
4 You can't stop the entire one.  But you can
5 look where it says, Hey teacher, leave those
6 kids alone.
7       You can say:  Hey tobacco, leave those
8 kids alone.
9       That's one of the really heinous things
10 they've done.
11       This is the peer pressure document on
12 page 522.  The tobacco industry attributes to
13 peer pressure but does not acknowledge a
14 relationship between their advertising and the
15 peer influence.  And the evidence shows -- and
16 this is scientific evidence -- that these
17 efforts, the marketing efforts, affect peer
18 influence to smoke and encourage smoking among
19 young people.
20       That's the truth of it.  So pay attention
21 to the industry that's driving this epidemic.
22       Again, they call the smokers rats in a
23 cage.  But it's all about nicotine.
24       And then you remember the quote?  If it
25 wasn't for the nicotine, folks would be no more

1 likely to smoke cigarettes than they would be
2 to blow bubbles or light sparklers.
3       Think about it.  That's what it is, a
4 mouth thing.  You're blowing bubbles, whatever.
5 You're holding up a cigarette, or you're
6 watching some fire.
7       But the truth is, it's a drug.  As Ed
8 said, he's a drug addict.  It's hard to wrap
9 your mind around it.  But cigarettes, they
10 don't look in culture as drugs, but that's what
11 they are.
12       THE COURT:  Time is up, sir.
13       MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'm going to take from
14 the back end, if I may.
15       THE COURT:  Sure.
16       MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is Robert Heimann.
17       He was against the warnings.  The
18 warnings were a fraud and a sham from the very
19 beginning.  They were watered down, they didn't
20 have any applicability.
21       Dr. Teague said the warnings are a plus,
22 because if you tell a kid not to do something,
23 he's probably going to do it.  They were on the
24 side of the pack.  They didn't really say
25 anything specific until 1985.  He had been

1 smoking for decades by then.
2       And when they finally did, they always
3 attributed it to the Surgeon General.  The
4 Surgeon General says -- but they always
5 disagree with the Surgeon General.  They
6 belittle the Surgeon General.
7       They never said "we say."
8       Early on, those early warnings didn't
9 mean a thing.  The FTC reports told you they're
10 dried out and useless.
11       And here's the thing.  It's 30 years,
12 they've not changed the warnings.  Everything
13 we've learned, all these additional documents.
14 Everything we know, they've not changed the
15 warnings.
16       The only time, Liggett went ahead and put
17 "smoking is addictive" on their box of
18 Chesterfields.  Philip Morris bought the
19 Chesterfield brand, took "smoking is addictive"
20 off.
21       That's a pretty important thing to know.
22 For a lot of folks, they didn't know they were
23 addictive.  That's the ineffectiveness of
24 cigarette labeling.
25       Here is the thing about warnings.  If you

1 see a kid walking up a high dive board to -- a
2 diving board that's on an empty pool, and there
3 is a "no diving" sign there and you see him
4 going by, do you say:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.
5 You've been warned.
6       And let him just jump off that diving
7 board into the pool.  No.  What do decent
8 people do?  What do human people do?  Caring,
9 nurturing people who want to protect children?
10 They scream:  Don't do that.
11       They yell:  Hey, kid, it's dangerous.
12 They run after him.  They launch themselves up
13 the ladder and they try to grab him to stop
14 him.
15       They don't say:  You've been warned.
16 You're on your own.
17       Little kids can't make long-range
18 planning decisions.  No kid that tries his
19 first cigarette because of peer pressure
20 promoted by tobacco knows what he's getting
21 himself into.
22       So determine the minimum nicotine
23 required to keep the normal smoker hooked.
24       Dr. Tamel.  I like that one because it
25 shows they know all about their smokers being

1 hooked.
2       Who ain't for more money?
3       If we didn't have nicotine, we're going
4 to be out of business.  Overnight, we will lose
5 our jobs and consulting fees.  We tend to
6 suffer from the fear that we are devoting our
7 business lives to the propagation of lung
8 cancer.
9       There is one in here that says cigarettes
10 have certain unattractive side effects.  They
11 cause lung cancer.  An unattractive side
12 effect?
13       And the thing, moreover, nicotine is
14 addictive.
15       Cancer is in every class of smoke, and
16 you can't filter it out.  But they told the
17 Surgeon General you could.  They said:  There's
18 no cancer, we will filter it out.
19       Internally they said:  There's cancer all
20 through the smoke, it's full of cancer.  But
21 we'll filter it out.  So they were lying.
22       Project SCUM.
23       MR. SEIDEN:  Judge, continued objection
24 on the grounds we spoke about earlier.
25       THE COURT:  Yes, sir.

1       MR. SCHLESINGER:  And this is where I
2 will wrap up, I think.  Unless I've got more
3 slides.  But the slides are dictating.
4       Project SCUM.  The reason I want to show
5 you Project SCUM and talk about it is because a
6 company that willfully trades lives for
7 profits, that has an enterprise of death as a
8 business, that sells an addictive drug to
9 children to hook them for life to generate
10 profits, even though they foreshorten their
11 life by decades or more and kills people,
12 doesn't have any compunction in their cynicism
13 to also ridicule those same customers.
14       What is worse?  Addicting them and
15 killing them or making fun of them while you're
16 doing it?
17       Now, internally in the '90s, they were
18 making fun of gay people and homeless people.
19 They called them Project SCUM.  Some clever
20 person said Sub Culture Urban Marketing is
21 Project SCUM.
22       They never sanctioned anybody or got in
23 trouble.  They never quit doing that.  It was
24 only when they got caught, when the documents
25 came out years later, that the CEO issued an

1 apology, which I say was insincere.  Because
2 when you apologize only after you got caught,
3 that's insincere.
4       Now Project SCUM is belittling the
5 customer.  Of course, if you addict and kill
6 them, what is the big deal to also belittle
7 them?  And, as Dr. Proctor said, this ain't the
8 only example.  There are plenty more.
9       And they said here, it's the Castro area,
10 the homeless people.  They had to -- those are
11 the kind of people.  They were targeting the
12 most vulnerable people.  Let's sell them
13 cigarettes, let's get them hooked.
14       Hey, here is an overlooked market.  The
15 weak, the powerless, the vulnerable.  Let's get
16 them hooked and sell them cigarettes.
17       And then what do they say in their
18 internal documents right around the same time,
19 when the Committee of Counsel, the all powerful
20 lawyer meeting is getting together?
21       Stevens, the head of the Committee of
22 Counsel, is quitting.  And what have we got?
23 The coronation of the God King.  The head of
24 the Committee of Counsel, the number one chief
25 architect and top of this whole entire

1 conspiracy is the God King.
2       They dehumanize their customers, and they
3 deify themselves.  And what does a God King who
4 has been crowned in a coronation have over
5 folks, over his dominion?  He has the power of
6 life and death.
7       You are celebrating that?  Addiction and
8 death, and you're celebrating it through the
9 success of your conspiracy?
10       Why should you check off that last box
11 that says there is no confusion about the
12 confusion; there is no doubt about the doubt;
13 that clearly and convincingly and without
14 hesitation you can arrive at a decision that
15 this entity deserves punishment?
16       And why is that an important reason why
17 we're here today, and one of the most important
18 things I've been honored to do in my life?
19 Because that's the truth of it.  That's an
20 interesting comparison right there.
21       And then they said they would go out of
22 business if it was ever proven to be dangerous.
23 They did that a bunch of time.  They never did.
24       And, as Dr. Proctor said, what keeps it
25 going?  Just greed, I guess.

1       And why is Ed -- why does it matter under
2 though reliance instructions, which are
3 complicated but you have to read them?  Here is
4 the simplified wording of those instructions:
5 Lies cost lives.
6       Proctor testified to it.  Lies cost him
7 his lungs.  That's why.  He was hurt by their
8 lies.  That's why, he was one of the millions
9 hurt by their lies.
10       It was nothing personal.  They were lying
11 to everybody.  But he was caught up in it.
12       They talked about what would happen if
13 they came up with the antagonist in nicotine,
14 if they could block the nicotine.
15       They would be in the process of digging
16 their own grave.  And remember, they've got a
17 survival instinct.  They humanize themselves,
18 and they don't want to dig their own grave.
19 However, they're fully willing to dig half a
20 million graves a year of their customers who
21 are dying off.
22       And the literature.  Should I skip that?
23 I'll skip it.
24       And then one of the things real quick
25 they talked about was that the -- the surface

1 area of your mouth.  The size of a tennis ball.
2 Hold cigar smoke in your mouth, the size of a
3 tennis ball.  That's how much absorption.
4       But as Dr. Andrews testified, the surface
5 area of the lungs, the size of a tennis court.
6 That's why when a big puff of smoke goes into
7 your lungs, which, by the way, has no taste
8 buds whatsoever.  There's no taste buds in the
9 lungs.  You can't taste with your lungs.  All
10 that nicotine is rapidly absorbed in that
11 highly vascularized organ.  And you get all
12 that nicotine shooting to your brain.
13       Controlling nicotine, controlling
14 nicotine.  They can do it.  It's all about
15 nicotine.
16       Sales correlating with nicotine.  More
17 nicotine, more money.
18       And Shook Hardy.  We can't defend
19 continued smoking as a free choice if the
20 person is addicted, 1980.  I told you that.
21       The Waxman hearings.  You saw them.  I'm
22 not going to play them again.
23       Thanks so much for listening to me.  I
24 know it was rapid fire.  I hope some of it got
25 absorbed by you.


7           MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.  
8           Good morning.  Thanks so much.  You guys 
9 have been a wonderful jury, unbelievably patient.  
10           I spent a lot of time on my feet with a 
11 lot of witnesses, and now I'm going to be the last 
12 one to talk to you today before you go back and 
13 deliberate.  
14           And before I say anything, first and 
15 foremost, thank you so much.  Thank you very much 
16 on behalf of Ed, everyone who tried this case.  We 
17 very, very much appreciate it.  
18           Now if you listened to the tobacco 
19 lawyers, you've heard a tremendous amount of 
20 evidence, a mound of evidence, days and days of 
21 evidence showing how these companies did very, 
22 very, very awful, horrendous, heinous things.  
23           But if you listened to them, they make 
24 it sound like they've done nothing wrong, zero, 
25 nothing. 5489
1           Nothing they did mattered.  Nothing they 
2 did made a difference.  Nothing they did impacted 
3 people.  They never killed anybody.  They never 
4 addicted anybody, never manipulated cigarettes, 
5 nothing. 
6           They've been absolved in their own 
7 minds, but nowhere else have they been absolved, 
8 nowhere else, and that's important.  
9           Now I agree with Mr. Seiden, the 
10 evidence matters.  He said:  The plaintiff wants 
11 you to believe the evidence doesn't matter.  
12           How could that possibly be true?  We put 
13 so much before you.  
14           The evidence in this case indisputably 
15 is that this industry profits off the backs of 
16 customers they exterminate and then blames them 
17 when they press their claims in court. 
18           You kill them, and then you blame them 
19 for killing them.  
20           That's just -- it's mind-boggling.  In 
21 no other institution, in no other society, in no 
22 other environment would somebody be able to defend 
23 actions like this.  
24           You don't blame the victim, but they do.  
25           And now -- I heard it in the beginning 5490
1 of the case.  First thing Mr. Cofer said in jury 
2 selection -- both panels, some of you sat on the 
3 first panel, some of you sat on the second panel, 
4 and I think some of you might have met when you 
5 were all selected for the jury.  I think that was 
6 the case.  
7           Both times, he said:  There's two sides 
8 to every story.  Two sides to every story. 
9           Mr. Seiden said it again today:  There's 
10 two sides to every story. 
11           That sounds very reasonable.  You know, 
12 it's a well-vetted tobacco line.  
13           Dr. Proctor talked about it.  They used 
14 that line to convince Americans 40, 50, 60, 30, 
15 20, and 10 years ago that there's nothing wrong 
16 with cigarettes.  
17           That was the foundation of their entire 
18 conspiracy:  There's two sides to every story.  
19           MR. SEIDEN:  Litigation objection.  
20           THE COURT:  Overruled. 
21           Go ahead.
22           MR. GDANSKI:  There's two sides to every 
23 story. 
24           I'm surprised they're still using it, 
25 but they are.  But you know what?  There's not 5491
1 always two sides to every story.  
2           It's not.  It sounds good.  You like to 
3 tell people that.  You like to talk to your kids.  
4 I've talked to my kids. 
5           I'd say:  What did you do wrong?  Who 
6 hit who first?  
7           Sometimes after you hear 16, 17, 18 days 
8 of evidence or five minutes talking to my 
9 five-year-old, I say:  Hey, what you did, what 
10 they did is really, really ridiculously bad.  It's 
11 evil.  It's heinous.  There's not two sides to 
12 Project SCUM.  There's not.  
13           You apologized after you got caught.  
14 After they got caught, they apologized one time in 
15 one letter to the San Francisco Times after they 
16 were busted. 
17           That's not an apology.  It's 
18 meaningless.  Where is the record evidence of them 
19 going out to make sure homeless people in this 
20 country don't smoke?  
21           That seems like a pretty noble thing to 
22 do.  That would be very, very good.  Where is 
23 that?  
24           What is the other side to the story of 
25 manipulating cigarettes?  Where is it?  When did 5492
1 they talk about it?  
2           What is the other side to the story of 
3 Joe Camel?  They still pretend Joe Camel wasn't 
4 meant to market to youth.  
5           Come on.  We put up the document.  As 
6 low as you can go.  It's a cartoon character.  Who 
7 else are they marketing to?  
8           What's the other side of the story to 
9 manipulating nicotine, adding ammonia, high 
10 fructose corn syrup?  
11           What's the other side of the story to 
12 killing 20 million people, an epidemic of death 
13 unknown in any other aspect of human history?  
14           MR. COFER:  Excuse me for one moment. 
15           Your Honor, just to preserve the 
16 objection, Williams/State Farm, and I won't 
17 interrupt again.
18           THE COURT:  Okay.  Overruled.  
19           MR. GDANSKI:  What's the other side of 
20 the story to free-basing nicotine?  Why are they 
21 doing that?  
22           So if they wanted to tell the other side 
23 of the story, they got all the data on free-basing 
24 nicotine.  
25           They're the ones who did it.  They never 5493
1 refuted it.  They never said:  We didn't do that.  
2 You know, we never free-based nicotine.  
3           So then, what is the explanation?  What 
4 is the other side of the story?  None offered.  
5 Silence.  
6           Instead, what do they do?  They point 
7 the finger at Ed and say:  Oh, Ed, you knew in 
8 1958 that smoking cigarettes was bad because there 
9 was a poll.  
10           Well, if he knew in 1958 smoking 
11 cigarettes was bad, then it also stands to reason 
12 he knew everything they were saying.  
13           But they want to have it on a one-way 
14 street, and this world does not exist on a one-way 
15 street.  It doesn't work that way. 
16           What's the other side of the story of 
17 485, 500, we heard the numbers growing, 520, 530, 
18 half a million Americans dying a year?  What's the 
19 other side of the story?  
20           They never tell you the other side.  
21 There is no other side.  Instead, they ignore it.  
22 They ignore death.  They ignore everything that 
23 they do.  
24           These companies don't manufacture 
25 cigarettes.  They manufacture lung cancer.  They 5494
1 manufacture COPD, and they manufacture death.
2           And for all these deaths, for all the 
3 deaths, the 480, the 20 million, there's countless 
4 and endless suffering that goes with it.  
5 Countless and endless children, parents, family 
6 members.  
7           It's not like when a person dies, that's 
8 the end of that story, and we just -- one person 
9 who existed at one moment in time.  
10           They have loved ones.  John and Louise 
11 Mavrakis are here today.  They couldn't come in 
12 the trial.  They couldn't sit in.  It's Ed's 
13 sister and brother-in-law.  
14           Ed has people who love him, who care 
15 about him, and so do every single person these 
16 companies exterminate.  
17           And you know what?  We talked -- let's 
18 take a look at a couple of things.  Okay?  
19           There you go.  Just click it.
20           VIDEO TECHNICIAN:  Yes.  
21           MR. GDANSKI:  Thanks.
22           So they said:  Well, we didn't get Ed to 
23 start smoking.  
24           This was the very beginning.  If you 
25 think about their defense, all they've really done 5495
1 is tell you the same four things over and over and 
2 over and over and over again.  
3           Ed started smoking with a girl in high 
4 school.  John's dad had COPD.  Ed's uncle had 
5 COPD, and Dr. Patel warns.  
6           How many times did they repeat that?  
7           Yesterday they said:  You remember Ed's 
8 uncle.  
9           Of course we remember Ed's uncle.  You 
10 talked about him every single day in the entire 
11 trial.  
12           But the reality is the Surgeon General 
13 tells us the tobacco industry -- so you know, it's 
14 funny, some of the early Surgeon General's reports 
15 don't reflect on the tobacco industry because we 
16 didn't know how awful they were, and we didn't 
17 know how evil they were, and we didn't know how 
18 much they were affecting people.  
19           The later Surgeon General's reports, the 
20 last two, three ones, they're all about the 
21 tobacco industry because now we're learning:  Hey, 
22 you guys faked out the Surgeon General.  You faked 
23 out every person.  
24           So here they say the tobacco industry 
25 routinely attributes smoking to peer pressure, 5496
1 just like they did.  
2           But it does not acknowledge the 
3 relationship between advertising and peer 
4 influence, or the effects of advertising on 
5 normative behavior.  
6           The point is, you're never going to find 
7 a person who says:  Oh, Of course, I started using 
8 that product.  I bought my iPad because I saw a 
9 wonderful commercial.  
10           Of course not.  But does it all affect 
11 us?  Of course.  And where does it come from?  
12 From the manufacturer, and they pretend to 
13 disappear.  
14           They live in a world where cigarettes 
15 fall from trees, and the tobacco companies 
16 disappear, and cigarettes just wonderfully, 
17 magically make their way into smokers' hands, and 
18 then they get COPD, and then that's the end of it. 
19           That's the world they want to live in.  
20 It's not reality.  
21           The evidence reviewed shows that these 
22 efforts also affect peer influence to smoke and 
23 encourage smoking among young people. 
24           That's peer pressure.  
25           The Engle findings.  I want to be super 5497
1 clear because there's an issue in this case about 
2 reliance and about what Ed did know or didn't 
3 know. 
4           And it's not that complicated.  It's 
5 really not that complicated.  
6           The Engle findings are that:  The 
7 defendants, Number 4 -- they're in your jury 
8 instructions -- concealed or omitted material 
9 information not otherwise known, not otherwise 
10 known.  
11           And so when Mr. Seiden gets up there and 
12 says:  Well, it had to be something he didn't 
13 otherwise know, that's the finding.  
14           What he said is a rejection of the 
15 findings.  It's a rejection of Engle. 
16           MR. SEIDEN:  Objection.  Misstates my 
17 argument.  
18           THE COURT:  Overrule the objection.  
19           MR. GDANSKI:  Not otherwise known. 
20           He knew this was in the instructions.  
21 It's Number 4 of the findings.  His client was 
22 involved in the case.  
23           Not otherwise known or available, 
24 knowing it materially was false or misleading to 
25 the company or failed to disclose a material fact 5498
1 concerning the health effects or addictive nature 
2 of smoking cigarettes or both.  
3           The defendants agreed with other 
4 companies and industry organizations to conceal or 
5 omit information regarding the health effects of 
6 cigarette smoking or the addictive nature of 
7 cigarettes. 
8           This agreement was entered with the 
9 intention that smokers and members of the public 
10 rely to their detriment.  That includes Ed.  That 
11 includes Ed Caprio.  
12           And so when you get to the verdict form, 
13 the questions that deal with the words "rely," 
14 these findings matter.  "Rely," the findings talk 
15 about reliance, not otherwise known.  The findings 
16 talk about not otherwise known.  
17           What evidence is there after the 1980s?  
18 They talk about:  Well, it had to be something 
19 that made a difference to him.  It had to be 
20 something that made a difference to him.  
21           Ed trusted the cigarette manufacturers.  
22 Ed testified in this case he never would have 
23 believed they'd lie to millions of Americans.
24           Would it have made a difference -- when 
25 you're looking at the questions of reliance, would 5499
1 it have made a difference to a reasonable person 
2 if they knew that the tobacco companies were 
3 ammoniating cigarettes, free-basing nicotine, and 
4 manipulating pH?  Would that have made a 
5 difference?  
6           I think it would have.  I think if 
7 they'd come out and said:  We're doing this, 
8 people would respond.  
9           That's called reliance.  That's how you 
10 rely on an omission because the omission, the 
11 failure to tell the person the truth, when 
12 revealed, would it have made a difference?  That's 
13 reliance.  
14           Would it have made a difference if Ed 
15 knew how they controlled nicotine?  Would it have 
16 made a difference if Ed knew that filters were a 
17 fraud?  
18           The only place in the world where 
19 anybody credibly maintains that filters work, 
20 courtrooms.  That's it.  Tobacco companies in 
21 courtrooms.  That's it.  No place else.  
22           Would it have made a difference if Ed 
23 knew that they compared smokers to rats?  Would 
24 all of that have made a difference?  
25           I think it would have.  I think it would 5500
1 make a difference in anybody if a product we have 
2 and we know the manufacturer knows it's addictive 
3 and comparing our use of it to a rat in a cage.  
4           Ed never knew that without nicotine 
5 there would be no smoking.  That would matter to 
6 people.  That would matter to Ed.  
7           Here's what Ed said:  When you think 
8 we're smoking -- and back up, before I read it, we 
9 have direct, immediate, express, clear, crystal 
10 clear, without hesitation evidence of reliance.  
11           Ed and Bryan, Roger Bryan, they 
12 obviously love each other.  They're obviously 
13 close. 
14           They've been through the horrors of not 
15 just Ed's disease but their close friends that 
16 they loved and cared for, watching them die of a 
17 disease that nobody understood, that was confusing 
18 them, that they were always scared they'd get.  
19           And Ed, who cares for, loves his 
20 partner, will remain life partners to the end, 
21 said:  Hey, switch to light cigarettes.  These are 
22 safer for you.  
23           That's what he told him way after 1982.  
24 So if he's telling Roger, Bryan, to switch to 
25 light cigarettes, doesn't that mean that he 5501
1 probably believed light cigarettes were better for 
2 him?  
3           I mean, come on.  It doesn't take a 
4 rocket scientist to figure that out.  And Ed 
5 testified to that.  He said he thought they were 
6 safer.  
7           Did you think that because of 
8 advertisements?  
9           And Ed said, you know, and he sort of 
10 said it honestly:  Of course.  They didn't say it 
11 directly, but less tar, less nicotine.
12          Is that what the ads implied?  
13           Yes.  
14           Did they work on you?  
15           Of course.  
16           Is that why you convinced Bryan?  Did 
17 you still believe it?  
18           Yes.  
19           And you told Bryan that?  
20           Yes.  
21           When you convinced Bryan, were you 
22 relying?  
23           I was relying on the tobacco industry, 
24 their ads.  I never imagined an American company 
25 would dupe millions of Americans smoking a product 5502
1 with carcinogens that were dangerous to their 
2 health.  I just couldn't imagine that type of 
3 inhumanity.  
4           This pack of cigarettes -- can I turn 
5 this off now a second or no?  
6           VIDEO TECHNICIAN:  Yes.  
7           MR. GDANSKI:  This pack of cigarettes is 
8 illegal.  It's illegal.  
9           Can I get a ten-minute and a five-minute 
10 warning?  
11           THE COURT:  Sure.  Which one?  Both, ten 
12 and five?  
13           MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, please.
14           THE COURT:  You got it.  
15           MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.
16           This pack of cigarettes is illegal.  So 
17 what Ed is smoking in 1982, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 
18 they are illegal today.  Why?  Dr. Proctor said 
19 why.  Because they were misleading.  
20           So we have a guy smoking a misleading 
21 product that today would be illegal to smoke.  
22 That's evidence of reliance after 1982.  
23           And they went everywhere they could.  
24 They told everyone they could that smoking 
25 cigarettes was dangerous -- was not proven to be 5503
1 dangerous, that you should continue smoking.  
2           We don't know.  We don't know.  
3           We have a video we can play?  
4           VIDEO TECHNICIAN:  Yes.  
5           MR. GDANSKI:  Okay.
6           And when you see "Lights" on there, 
7 that's a statement.  "Lights" is a statement.  
8 It's a word they put on their packs as a 
9 statement.  
10           So think about that when you see the 
11 word "statement" in the jury instructions.  
12           (Video clip played as follows:) 
13           VOICE:  Throughout your tenure with 
14 American, it was not only American's position but 
15 your position that cigarettes weren't injurious to 
16 health; is that accurate?  
17           VOICE:  Through my tenure?  
18           VOICE:  Yes.
19           VOICE:  Yes, that is so.
20           VOICE:  That is something American 
21 Tobacco wanted the public to believe; is that 
22 correct?  
23           VOICE:  Yes.  
24           VOICE:  It's a statement that American 
25 Tobacco placed great reliance on? 5504
1           VOICE:  We issued that statement, yes.  
2           VOICE:  And as far as --
3           VOICE:  Of course we wanted them to 
4 believe it.
5           VOICE:  As far as you're concerned, a 
6 person is justified in relying on that statement?  
7           VOICE:  Yes.  
8                     - - -  
9           VOICE:  And I have to disagree with you 
10 in that we don't know what causes the illness that 
11 has been attributed to cigarette smoking.
12                      - - -
13           VOICE:  Cigarette smoking does not cause 
14 cancer, yes or no?  
15           VOICE:  It is not known whether 
16 cigarettes cause cancer.  
17           VOICE:  All right, sir.  
18           VOICE:  Has not been causally 
19 established.  
20           VOICE:  Cigarette smoking, no causal 
21 relationship between cigarette smoking and 
22 emphysema?  
23           VOICE:  Despite all of the research to 
24 date, there has been no causal link established.

1           VOICE:  The case is still open.  The 
2 jury has not come in.  
3           VOICE:  It may not be harmful; you're 
4 not convinced?  
5           VOICE:  It may be, or it may not be.  We 
6 don't know.  
7                      - - -
8           VOICE:  Do cigarettes cause answer?  
9           VOICE:  I don't know if they do or 
10 not.  
11                      - - -
12           VOICE:  I'm not in a position to give 
13 you a "does" or "does not" answer.
14                      - - -
15           VOICE:  The medical experts agree that 
16 smoking causes emphysema.  Do you agree?  
17 Emphysema?  
18           VOICE:  It may.  
19           VOICE:  They agree that smoking causes 
20 lung cancer.  Do you agree?  
21           VOICE:  It may.  
22           VOICE:  Do you know whether it does?  
23           VOICE:  I do not.  We don't know what 
24 causes cancer in general right now, so I think 
25 that we may find out what causes cancer and we may 5506
1 find out some relationship which has yet to be 
2 proven.  
3           (Video clip concluded.)
4           MR. GDANSKI:  That's all after 1982, and 
5 those are all senior executives in the companies.  
6           That's the message they were trying to 
7 put out.  They knew it was critically important to 
8 them achieving the goal of sustaining profits 
9 because that's what it was about.  
10           They want to say Mr. Caprio is here for 
11 money.  That's all the law allows.  He'll take a 
12 pound of flesh if the law would allow it.  He 
13 can't.  But all he can ask for is money in a civil 
14 case.  
15           And so that's what he can ask for.  And, 
16 you know, we asked for $12 million in the economic 
17 numbers.  The $12 million is for his pain and 
18 suffering in the past and in the future.  
19           The man has suffered.  I don't think I 
20 have to say any more about that.  I know I, my 
21 people, we don't measure suffering by how much 
22 people make in a year, a salary.  
23           We don't choose to do it that way.  I 
24 think that that's an unfair way to measure 
25 suffering when you can't breathe at night. 5507
1           And if there's a power outage in South 
2 Florida, your oxygen tank goes out, and then you 
3 have a major, major problem.  
4           So I think that the evidence justifies 
5 the numbers that we offer to you, but you can do 
6 whatever you want. 
7           When we're done, you go back; you pick a 
8 foreperson.  It's all in your hands.  You can go 
9 higher.  You can go lower.  You can do whatever 
10 you see fit, whatever the evidence calls for.  
11           Can I go back to this pack for one 
12 second?  
13           VIDEO TECHNICIAN:  Sure.  
14           MR. GDANSKI:  Thanks.  
15           On the pack, so it says Marlboro Lights, 
16 and then it says -- and Dr. Proctor talked about 
17 this -- hard to see, it says a Latin phrase:  
18 Veni, vidi, vici.  
19           This is the corporate motto of greed 
20 from Philip Morris:  We came, we saw, we 
21 conquered.  
22           Who on earth did they conquer?  They 
23 knew it.  They knew they were the God Kings.  They 
24 knew they had the world of millions of smokers in 
25 their grasp to do with as they chose, and they 5508
1 did, and they took advantage of it, and they 
2 manipulated it.
3           And then they want to come to court 
4 proud and beat their chest and say:  It's all your 
5 fault.  Nothing we ever did mattered.  
6           Who puts:  We came, we saw, we 
7 conquered, on a product that kills people?  How is 
8 that -- it's mind-boggling.  It's mind-boggling.  
9           Mr. Cofer said yesterday:  Mr. Caprio, 
10 he had a wake-up call in 1996 when he got 
11 diagnosed with COPD.  
12           A wake-up call?  It's not a wake-up 
13 call.  There's no such thing as a little bit of 
14 COPD.  You know, a diagnosis of COPD is a lifelong 
15 situation.  
16           It's not a wake-up call.  It's not like 
17 the alarm clock goes off and you shut it off.  
18 COPD stays with every breath that you have. 
19           And I asked Dr. Andrews -- he tried to 
20 trivialize it.  He did.  He tried to trivialize 
21 Ed's COPD in 1996 by saying:  He didn't have 
22 symptoms.  
23           I said:  He had shortness of breath.  He 
24 had low oxygen.  He had distant breath sounds.  
25           He said:  Those all could be from 5509
1 something else. 
2           There was nothing else.  Ed had real 
3 COPD.  
4           Of course if he were to stop smoking, 
5 he'd get better.  
6           That's not the point.  He was addicted.  
7 There's no real question that the man was 
8 addicted.
9           I think in any sensible situation, any 
10 sensible medical test, the Fagerstrom test, it all 
11 shows that Ed was addicted.  
12           But you can't trivialize COPD.  You 
13 can't trivialize cutting open his lungs.  You 
14 can't do that.  
15           Next, please, Project SCUM.
16           There you go.  Thanks.
17           MR. SEIDEN:  Continuing objection?  
18           THE COURT:  Sure.  
19           MR. GDANSKI:  Project SCUM, they say 
20 that we're misusing Project SCUM.  They say that 
21 we're the ones coming forward and, you know, we're 
22 taking it out of context. 
23           Mr. Cofer said that we used Project SCUM 
24 in a shameful manner.  You are the first jury in 
25 the history of the universe to hear about Project 5510
1 SCUM.  Never been shown to a jury who is going to 
2 decide the fate of these companies.  Never been 
3 shown to a jury.  
4           This is not shameful.  What is 
5 disturbing is how lost they are.  Their moral 
6 compass is lost. 
7           The appropriate thing to do when you 
8 show Project SCUM is to get up here and say:  Hey, 
9 mea culpa, that was really awful, and if we didn't 
10 apologize enough, we're going to do it one more 
11 time. 
12           That's what you do.  You don't come 
13 forward and say:  These guys are misusing Project 
14 SCUM. 
15           Project SCUM was disgusting.  That's 
16 what they call Ed Caprio?  That's what they call 
17 people in this country?  
18           MR. SEIDEN:  Objection.  Misrepresents 
19 the evidence.  
20           MR. GDANSKI:  It's insane.
21           THE COURT:  Overruled.
22           MR. GDANSKI:  It's insane.  It's -- 
23 there's no words to describe it.  It speaks for 
24 itself.  
25           And the moral compass that they've lost 5511
1 in the '40s and '50s and '60s and '70s and '80s, 
2 you'd like to think they got it back, but they 
3 haven't.  They haven't.  
4           They've shown no real, you know, 
5 understanding of what is decent, what is good, 
6 what is appropriate, what they should be doing. 
7           And it's not us, the lawyers, who 
8 thought of Project SCUM.  I showed you the article 
9 from the San Francisco New Times right after where 
10 they said:  Hey, what you guys are doing, the 
11 purpose -- this is Anne Landman.  Dr. Proctor 
12 talked about it.  
13           They said:  As I dig through these 
14 documents, I come to realize it's all nasty, but 
15 this one is particularly nasty.  Even if it's a 
16 cute acronym, how do you justify it?  
17           What customers would want to buy a 
18 product from any company that calls them "scum"?  
19 The name of the project is beyond offensive.  
20           And they realized that a little too 
21 late.  
22           It's one thing to go after a particular 
23 group to extract its money, but it's another to be 
24 derogatory while you do it.  
25           This is the newspaper articles calling 5512
1 these companies out.  That's the truth of the 
2 matter.  That's the truth of the situation.  
3           You put in a -- I hope after this came 
4 out you put in new laws at the company to protect 
5 against the evils that you've perpetrated in the 
6 past.  
7           But those are all what Dr. Proctor 
8 called evescasting.  Do you remember, no one 
9 understood the word?  He thinks he coined the 
10 word. 
11           It's basically covering up your tracks.  
12 That's all it is, covering up your tracks after 
13 you do something wrong.  
14           One of the things you're going to see in 
15 your jury instructions is legal cause.  Mr. Cofer 
16 showed you this paragraph:  Addiction to 
17 cigarettes, legal cause, directly and in natural 
18 and continuous sequence, produced or contributed 
19 to produce such COPD that it can be reasonably 
20 said but for the addiction to cigarettes 
21 containing nicotine, COPD would not have occurred. 
22           And he thinks legal cause is very 
23 important, and it is.  
24           There's a second section to legal cause 
25 which he did not show you. 5513
1           Nicotine addiction does not have to be 
2 the only cause.  In order to be regarded as a 
3 legal cause of COPD, an addiction to cigarettes 
4 containing nicotine need not be the only cause. 
5           Addiction to cigarettes containing 
6 nicotine may be a legal cause of COPD even though 
7 it operates in combination with the acts of 
8 another, some natural cause, or some other cause, 
9 if such other cause occurs at the same time as the 
10 addiction and the addiction contributes 
11 substantially to producing the COPD.  
12           That is tremendously complicated 
13 language, which, quite frankly, I don't really 
14 understand it. 
15           What it means is that, did his addiction 
16 to nicotine contribute substantially?  Did his 
17 addiction play an important role in his continued 
18 smoking?  
19           That's what it means, and of course it 
20 did.  
21           Addiction is the center of their 
22 universe.  Without addiction, there would be 
23 nothing.  It is the sine qua non of their entire 
24 business enterprise, without which there is 
25 nothing, nothing. 5514
1           No nicotine in cigarettes, no lawsuit 
2 here today.  No nicotine in cigarettes, no oxygen 
3 tank humming in the back.  No nicotine in 
4 cigarettes, no 20 million deaths.  No nicotine in 
5 cigarettes, no 500,000 dead a year. 
6           That's what "substantially contributes" 
7 means.  
8           The Surgeon General tells us:  Nicotine 
9 addiction -- Page 105.  When you go back there, 
10 you guys can take as much time as you want.  We 
11 are not time bound by you.  You have all the time 
12 you want.
13           We're up against a weekend.  We trust 
14 and hope that you guys understand the importance 
15 and significance of this case.  
16           The next phase of this trial I assure 
17 you will be extremely short.  We have no evidence.  
18 We have no witnesses.  We will start and rest. 
19           They can do whatever they want to do to 
20 drag it out.  We will not put on a witness.
21           MR. SEIDEN:  I object to that.  
22           THE COURT:  I'll sustain the 
23 objection.  
24           MR. SEIDEN:  Move to strike the 
25 comment. 5515
1           THE COURT:  We'll strike it.  The jury 
2 is to disregard it. 
3           Go right ahead.
4           MR. GDANSKI:  Page 105, 105:  Nicotine 
5 addiction is the fundamental reason, fundamental 
6 reason. 
7           That's all you need.  And so what do 
8 they do?  What do they do here?  
9           You don't have a leg to stand on, you 
10 break the other guy's.  You don't have a leg to 
11 stand on, you break the other guy's.  
12           And that's what they've done.  Project 
13 SCUM:  We're just going to knock one of their legs 
14 down.  
15           Put up addiction as a fundamental 
16 reason, we're going to knock one of their legs 
17 down.  
18           But the reality is, is that when you 
19 knock their leg down, you don't hit them when 
20 they're down.  
21           And yesterday Mr. Cofer made a low blow.  
22 He made a low blow.  He called out Scott 
23 Schlesinger for not being here during parts of the 
24 trial.  
25           Scott apologized for that.  Mr. Cofer 5516
1 knows good full and well that Mr. Schlesinger's 
2 mom died a sudden, a sudden death that was 
3 unexpected.
4           MR. SEIDEN:  Objection.  
5           THE COURT:  I'll sustain the 
6 objection.  
7           MR. GDANSKI:  He knows why he wasn't 
8 here.  
9           MR. COFER:  Whoa, whoa, whoa, and we can 
10 instruct the jury to disregard?  
11           THE COURT:  Yes.  
12           The jury is to disregard that.  
13           Go ahead, sir.
14           MR. GDANSKI:  He knows.  We know.  
15 Everyone except for you-all know why Scott wasn't 
16 here a few days.  
17           MR. SEIDEN:  Can we have a motion, Your 
18 Honor?
19           THE COURT:  I'll sustain the objection. 
20           Strike that.
21           MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.  
22           Dr. Herrera, they say Dr. Herrera sent 
23 Ed Caprio to Dr. Kirsch to treat him for nicotine 
24 addiction.  That's just not true.  He said 
25 otherwise.

1           Can we play that?  
2           VIDEO TECHNICIAN:  Sure.  
3           MR. GDANSKI:  Thanks.
4           (Video clip played as follows:)
5           VOICE:  But you were the doctor, and you 
6 had been the doctor primarily managing his 
7 nicotine addiction, right?  
8           VOICE:  Yes.  
9           VOICE:  That has not fallen to the 
10 responsibility of a psychiatrist, correct?  
11           VOICE:  Correct.  
12           (Video clip concluded.)
13           MR. GDANSKI:  He said it.  He said:  I 
14 treated him for nicotine addiction.  I didn't send 
15 him to Dr. Kirsch for nicotine addiction.  I was 
16 the one who treated him.  
17           I asked that question because I knew one 
18 day these guys were going to try to come to court 
19 and say:  Dr. Kirsch never did X, Y, or Z.  
20           Dr. Kirsch's records don't say anything 
21 about Mr. Caprio's nicotine addiction.  Neither 
22 did Dr. Patel's, by the way.  
23           And when someone finally asked him a 
24 question, he said:  Yeah, of course the guy was 
25 addicted to nicotine.  No doubt about it.  No 5518
1 doubt about it.
2           They could have gone to ask Dr. Kirsch 
3 questions.  You notice in Dr. Herrera's deposition 
4 for the first four hours -- look at the time of 
5 that deposition, by the way.  It's 19:50.  
6           I'm not good with Army time, but it was 
7 late.  When I left, it was very dark.  It was 9, 
8 10:00 when we finished that deposition. 
9           They could have asked Dr. Kirsch what 
10 she thought.  They chose not to do that.  
11           And you know what?  They also called 
12 Dr. Herrera out for not knowing Ed had a partner.  
13 It was 10:00 at night.
14           The guy's medical records say:  Patient 
15 lives with a partner.  Patient lives with a 
16 partner.  Patient lives with a partner.  Patient 
17 lives with a partner.  Patient lives with a 
18 partner.  
19           How many times?  Okay.  How many times? 
20           And you know what?  The tobacco 
21 companies, they make it easy to start, as easy as 
22 possible to start, and as hard as possible to 
23 stop.  
24           And that is their business enterprise.  
25 That is their life blood.  That is what they do. 5519
1 That is how they survive.  
2           And at the center of it all were 
3 lawyers, were lawyers.  Lawyers were running it, 
4 engineering it, building it up, feeding it, 
5 feeding it, and then making sure it went in the 
6 right directions.
7           THE COURT:  Ten minutes, sir.  
8           MR. GDANSKI:  And they just kept going.  
9 They kept going.
10           This is -- 
11           THE COURT:  Counsel, ten minutes.  
12           MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you, Judge. 
13           Thank you.  
14           For purposes of the litigation, the 
15 industry is not willing to concede anything.  
16           In the litigation venue, we will require 
17 plaintiffs to prove causation, both legally and 
18 scientifically.  
19           We intend to play hardball with the 
20 victims of cigarette smoking when they press their 
21 claims in the courtroom.  
22           This -- that, that sentence I just read, 
23 that they'll play hardball and make them prove 
24 legal and scientific causation, is the industry's 
25 ultimate public relations sham. 5520
1           Our position continues to mislead the 
2 public with a wink, with a wink.  
3           That's all you need to see.  I can sit 
4 down though.  I won't because I've got extra time.  
5 That's all you need to see.  
6           The lawyers run the conspiracy, the 
7 influence of the lawyers.  In consequence of the 
8 importance of the lawsuits, the main power in 
9 smoking and health situation undoubtedly rests 
10 with the lawyers, and more particularly with the 
11 policy committee of lawyers.
12           The lawyers -- 
13           MR. SEIDEN:  Litigation objection.  
14           THE COURT:  Overruled.  
15           Go ahead.
16           MR. GDANSKI:  The Jensen issue --
17           MR. SEIDEN:  Continuing objection, Your 
18 Honor?
19           THE COURT:  Sure.  
20           MR. GDANSKI:  And this is, by the way, a 
21 Lorillard document.  I'm using the clicker, so I 
22 can't blow it up, but it has Lorillard/CTR Inquiry 
23 at the top.  So when he said we didn't put in a 
24 Lorillard document, here it is, Lorillard/CTR 
25 Inquiry.

1           The Jensen issue raises a larger 
2 question, whether funds administered through 
3 Shook, Hardy were used to purchase favorable 
4 judicial or legislative testimony, thereby 
5 perpetrating a fraud on the public.  
6           They purchased favorable judicial or 
7 legislative testimony in an effort to perpetrate a 
8 fraud on the public.  
9           And then they have the gall to come in 
10 and question Dr. Proctor.  That takes a lot.  This 
11 man has dedicated his life to curbing this 
12 epidemic.  He's not taking free money.  They have 
13 gall to do that. 
14           You know, these are their words, how 
15 they describe their own conduct, not written for 
16 purposes of exposing it to you in a courtroom.  
17 This is their secret, secret files.  
18           Everybody knows that in the story of Eve 
19 in the garden, the serpent is blameworthy.  The 
20 serpent is blameworthy.  He's the tempter, the 
21 tempter, the one who feeds -- 
22           MR. COFER:  Objection, Your Honor.  This 
23 is improper argument.  Move to strike.
24           THE COURT:  Overruled.  
25           Go ahead.

1           MR. GDANSKI:  And we know that.  That's 
2 a basic fundamental human being piece of 
3 knowledge. 
4           We have the goods on them now.  The time 
5 is up.  It's over with.
6           And they have a document, the God King.  
7 I said it back then, I feel uncomfortable saying 
8 the words.  I feel uncomfortable using the words 
9 "God King" to call a tobacco company.  Who refers 
10 to themselves as that?  
11           They talked a lot about Dr. Proctor 
12 going from courtroom to courtroom.  I thought one 
13 thing that Dr. Proctor said -- oh, this one is -- 
14 I'm sorry, this one I can't -- it's an internal 
15 document where Dr. DiMarco said:  Although I can't 
16 recall his exact words, our medical/scientific 
17 witnesses will say whatever we want them to say, 
18 clearly implying, if not stating, that they lacked 
19 credibility and integrity. 
20           It's the words on their pieces of paper 
21 before any experts were ever retained going 
22 forward in this case.  That's all you need to see.
23           Dr. Proctor said:  Have they ever 
24 admitted that a single person had a disease caused 
25 by addiction to nicotine? 5523
1           No.  
2           Of course he's got to go from courtroom 
3 to courtroom.  They won't admit anybody is a class 
4 member. 
5           They make it that much harder on the 
6 process.  I mean he would earn much less money, by 
7 the way, if they would just admit someone was a 
8 class member for one time, one time.  If not Ed, 
9 who?  If Ed's not a class member, who is?
10           And if an industry --
11           MR. BIDEAU:  Objection, Your Honor.  
12           THE COURT:  Overruled.  
13           Go ahead.
14           MR. GDANSKI:  And if an industry is not 
15 deserving of punishment -- if any industry is 
16 deserving of punishment, which better one than 
17 this one?  Which better one than this one?
18           And if not now, then when?  A billion 
19 deaths in the next century.  A billion deaths.  
20 Are we going to wait until then?  We can't wait 
21 until then.
22           MR. COFER:  Your Honor, objection.  
23 Williams/State Farm.  
24           THE COURT:  Overruled.  
25           Go ahead.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1           MR. GDANSKI:  In this trial, we learned 
2 there's 480,000 annual deaths.  That's 40,000 
3 deaths monthly.  That's 1,315 daily deaths, 
4 yesterday, today, tomorrow.  
5           That means if we take the days of this 
6 trial, you have 42,000 people dying from 
7 tobacco-related diseases during the course of this 
8 trial.  
9           This is no joke.  This is no joke, and 
10 that's using the 480,000 number, not the new 
11 numbers which are coming out and being 
12 substantiated in leading medical journals. 
13           This is no joke we're dealing with.  
14 This is a mass epidemic, and so what are they?  
15 They're what I call Engle breakers.  
16           They take the once proud and still proud 
17 Engle class and break them down one by one by one 
18 by one, courtroom to courtroom.  They will not let 
19 any Engle class member survive, and that is --
20           MR. BIDEAU:  Objection, Your Honor.  
21           THE COURT:  Overruled.  
22           Go ahead.
23           MR. GDANSKI:  That is a repudiation of 
24 the process.  That is unfair.  The Engle class is 
25 alive.  It is strong.  It is multigenerational, 5525
1 and it will outlive them.  It will teach them a 
2 lesson. 
3           Today you hold their fate -- like they 
4 pretended they were God Kings holding the fate of 
5 smokers, you're hold their fate in your hands. 
6           You hold their fate in your hands in a 
7 way they never did and in a way they never could 
8 because they don't get to go back and continue 
9 manipulations.  It's over.  
10           I'm going to skip this.  
11           Before and after 1982, they duped the 
12 Surgeon General, they duped the National Cancer 
13 Institute, they duped the Federal Trade 
14 Commission, they duped medical doctors, they duped 
15 millions of Americans, they duped Ed Caprio, and 
16 he used the term "shameful" earlier, "shameful."
17           Let's blow up the bottom.
18           THE COURT:  Five minutes, sir.
19           MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir. 
20           The FTC said:  We will not continue to 
21 be a victim of their shameful marketing practices. 
22           They said:  We will not continue to be a 
23 victim of the shameful marketing practices of 
24 tobacco companies.  
25           That is the Federal Trade Commission 5526
1 talking.  
2           We do live, we do unfortunately live in 
3 the world they created.  
4           The truth, Dr. Proctor said -- and when 
5 he said it, I wrote it down.  I thought it was 
6 very eloquent.  
7           The truth was their worst enemy.  Doubt 
8 is our product.  It's also the means of 
9 establishing a controversy.  Doubt is their 
10 product.  That's it. 
11           The FTC, they are the ones who said:  We 
12 are going to rescind our guidance.  
13           On that last one I showed you, they took 
14 off their guidance and said:  We will not let you 
15 guys -- be a cloak screen anymore for you, for the 
16 industry.  We're taking it away.  These are not 
17 safer. 
18           They took away what they had previously 
19 said.  
20           I'm not going to -- well, it only takes 
21 a second. 
22           Go ahead, please.
23           (Video clip played as follows:) 
24           VOICE:  Please consider yourselves to be 
25 under oath. 5527
1           VOICE:  Let me begin my questioning on 
2 the matter of whether or not nicotine is 
3 addictive. 
4           Let me ask you first -- and I'd like to 
5 just go down the row -- whether each of you 
6 believes that nicotine is not addictive. 
7           I heard virtually all of you touch on 
8 it, and just yes or no, do you believe nicotine is 
9 not addictive?  
10           VOICE:  I believe nicotine is not 
11 addictive, yes.  
12           VOICE:  Mr. Johnston?  
13           VOICE:  Congressman, cigarettes and 
14 nicotine clearly do not meet the classic 
15 definitions of addiction.  There is no 
16 intoxications.  
17           VOICE:  We'll take that as a no, and, 
18 again, time is short.  If you could just -- I 
19 think each of you believe nicotine is not 
20 addictive.  We just would like to have this for 
21 the record.  
22           VOICE:  I don't believe that nicotine or 
23 our products are addictive.  
24           VOICE:  I believe nicotine is not 
25 addictive. 5528
1           VOICE:  I believe that nicotine is not 
2 addictive.  
3           VOICE:  I believe that nicotine is not 
4 addictive.  
5           VOICE:  And I, too, believe that 
6 nicotine is not addictive.  
7           (Video clip concluded.)
8           MR. GDANSKI:  They want to say that 
9 those guys aren't lying.  That's what they want to 
10 claim in this courtroom today.  
11           If you're claiming in this courtroom 
12 that they're not lying, then you're lying.  That's 
13 it.
14           MR. COFER:  Your Honor, objection.  
15           MR. SEIDEN:  Objection.  
16           THE COURT:  I'll sustain the objection.  
17 The jury is to disregard it.  
18           MR. COFER:  Thank you, Your Honor.
19           MR. GDANSKI:  Mr. Cofer said:  Well, Ed, 
20 he accepts now five percent.  Before, he accepted 
21 no percent.  
22           You know, Ed accepts some percent.  When 
23 are they going to accept their fair share of the 
24 blame? 
25           The Frank Statement, they said, we 5529
1 accept as a responsibility.  When are they going 
2 to accept their fair share of the blame?
3           It hasn't happened. 
4           The Surgeon General, 2014, rapid 
5 elimination.  So we're moving forward in time.  
6 We're going from reduction.  Let's eliminate it.  
7 Let's eliminate it.  
8           That's the Surgeon General in 2014.  
9           This is the conspirator board.  We put 
10 this up.  Mr. Seiden showed it.  I showed it.  
11 It's got faces.  It's got names.  It's got people. 
12           Those were real people who worked for 
13 real companies and made real decisions.  Those 
14 were real people whose decisions had 
15 ramifications. 
16           Those were people whose decisions caused 
17 death, and I fundamentally disagree with the board 
18 that he put up where names and faces get erased 
19 because we know horrors leave shadows. 
20           Dr. Proctor said that:  Horrors leave 
21 shadows.  History is important.  We don't forget 
22 the horrors of history.  We teach our children and 
23 everybody to never forget.  
24           That's what we say.  We say:  Never 
25 forget. 5530
1           We don't erase them.  We study them.  We 
2 remember them, and by remembering those people, by 
3 remembering those people, we show dignity to the 
4 people that they killed. 
5           We remember the people that they killed.  
6 We remember the people who they affected.  And you 
7 know what?  These aren't all of the conspirators, 
8 but they killed and they hurt a lot of people. 
9           They hurt a tremendous amount of people, 
10 and I don't ascribe to the philosophy that we 
11 should erase them from the board. 
12           Every one of those guys should have a 
13 tombstone put over them for all the people that 
14 they've killed.  
15           And, you know, Ed, Ed will not live 
16 forever.  Ed Caprio, he will not live forever.  
17           Many of us in this room will outlive Ed 
18 Caprio, two, three, twelve years.  I'm younger 
19 than him.  I'll live forever [sic].  I'll live 
20 past Ed.  The natural course of things are going 
21 to be that way.  
22           And I reject the idea that you erase 
23 people from a board.  I will never erase Ed.  Ed 
24 never deserves to be erased. 
25           I'll remember Ed.  Steve will remember 5531
1 Ed.  Bryan will remember Ed.  Louise will remember 
2 Ed.  John will remember Ed.  Scott will remember 
3 Ed.  Brittany will remember Ed.  Moni will 
4 remember Ed. 
5           That's what people deserve to be.  They 
6 deserve to be remembered.  This industry lives in 
7 a world where they can erase faces.  
8           Today you can tell them, you can tell 
9 this industry:  You must remember Ed.  Never 
10 forget Ed Caprio. 
11           That is the power you have today.  We 
12 wish you God speed.  Good luck in delivering swift 
13 justice, and I hope to talk to you again. 
14           Thank you very, very much.
