9           MR. HAMMER:  Thank you, Judge.  May it
10      please the Court.  Counsel.
11           Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  Folks,
12      this has been a long trial, and I want to thank
13      you very much for your attention you have given
14      throughout the past four weeks.  It's been an
15      honor to represent Fannie and present her case
16      before you.  She thanks you for the attention
17      you gave and for the time that you took out of
18      your own lives.  We really respect that.  We
19      appreciate that.
20           It's been said trial by jury, the best of
21      all safeguards for the person and property of
22      every individual.  Thomas Jefferson said that
23      back in 1823 and it still stands true today.
24           Trial by jury, it is really the great
25      equalizer.  It allows people like Fannie Collar, just a plain old person like Fannie to come into
2      court and present her case against large
3      corporations like these tobacco companies.  It's
4      an equal playing field.  That's what it's all
5      about.
6           You heard the judge say that corporations
7      should be treated just like people.  They should
8      be looked at just like people in this courtroom.
9      And we want you to do that because with that,
10      when you want to be treated like people, you've
11      got to act like people.
12           I'm going to talk a lot about how these
13      corporations acted as compared to Fannie.
14      Because that's what they want you to look at,
15      Fannie's choices.  We want you to look at the
16      tobacco company's choices throughout the
17      history.
18           You're going to be deciding this case, and
19      it will likely be one of the biggest decisions
20      you've ever made.  You hold great power, and
21      with power comes great responsibility.  We
22      appreciate that and we respect that.  Whatever
23      decision you make, we're going to be perfectly
24      acceptable with.
25           Now, you've heard evidence in this case that most people do not get to hear.  Most
2      people don't get to hear about what these
3      tobacco companies have done.
4           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, that's not in
5      the evidence in the case.
6           THE COURT:  Overruled.
7           MR. HAMMER:  You've gotten to hear about
8      these tobacco companies, about the history of
9      these tobacco companies, things that they never,
10      ever wanted people like you or the public to
11      ever hear about.  That's why they had these
12      internal documents.  It's only because of
13      various things that happened over the years,
14      litigation and these kind of cases, that we have
15      those documents to show you.  Otherwise, they'd
16      still be secret.
17           And it's -- the idea is, they controlled a
18      business and pursued a business of addiction and
19      death, and that's what this case is about,
20      addiction and death.  It's about Fannie Collar
21      and the fact that she got addicted and got
22      diseases, and unfortunately she's going to die
23      from those diseases.
24           You're hearing -- you got to hear from
25      Fannie Collar.  You got to hear from Fannie Collar, which is a rare example in an Engle
2      case.  She's a living victim of these companies'
3      atrocious acts.  You got to hear from her, heard
4      from her own lips what she experienced.
5           Twenty-five years ago we didn't have the
6      evidence we have today that we were able to
7      present you because those were all secret
8      documents, but now they have seen the light of
9      day and you've seen it.  Hopefully you took it
10      all in and you understand what these tobacco
11      companies are really all about.  Because what
12      they're all about is greed.
13           We presented a lot of evidence to you, and
14      you know, it took two-and-a-half weeks now, now
15      it's three weeks that you-all are here.  We
16      didn't know what you needed to hear.  There is
17      tons of documents that you didn't see.  You
18      heard Dr. Proctor talk about 80 million
19      documents.  We certainly couldn't bring all
20      those in to you.  It would take forever to do
21      that.  But we brought to you what we thought
22      would enlighten you on what these tobacco
23      companies are all about.
24           What it's all about is simple.  It's about
25      replacement smokers and it's about addiction. That's the nature of this company's business.
2      They look for replacement smokers and addiction.
3      That's what it's all about.  They attract the
4      youth to get them started, and they keep
5      cigarettes addictive to keep them smoking.
6      That's what this case is about.
7           These are the dirty little secrets of the
8      tobacco companies, secrets that they never
9      thought would see the light of day, but you got
10      to see them in this courtroom.  Without youth
11      marketing, without nicotine, there would be no
12      smoking, and it would reduce the epidemic that
13      has become rampant in this country as a result
14      of these tobacco companies.  Without nicotine
15      that's where we would be, and that would be a
16      great thing.
17           So why do they do it?  We saw this
18      document.  Who ain't for more money?  That's why
19      they do it.  It's all about greed.  You know,
20      they talk about the fact that they just -- hey,
21      we just sell cigarettes.  You know, we just sell
22      cigarettes.  It's just a cigarette.
23           Except that we know from their internal
24      documents that cigarette smoke is just a drug.
25      They know that.  They're not in the cigarette business.  They're in the pharmaceutical
2      business.  It's a drug.  It's a potent drug.
3      It's an addictive drug.
4           And they've known it forever and yet
5      they've lied about it forever.  They claimed
6      that it was not a drug.  They claimed it was not
7      addictive.  They claimed there was no problems
8      with it for the longest time, for decades.
9           In another document, remember Dr. Teague,
10      he was a scientist at R.J. Reynolds, he says, we
11      deliberately played down the role of nicotine.
12      That's what he said in their documents.  Their
13      product is nicotine.  That's what it's all
14      about.  It's not the cigarette.  The product is
15      nicotine.
16           The first question you have to answer is,
17      was Fannie addicted to nicotine?  To answer that
18      question you really don't have to look any
19      further than their own documents.  Without
20      nicotine, the argument goes, there would be no
21      smoking.  This is a document from 1972.  No one
22      has ever become a cigarette smoker by smoking
23      cigarettes without nicotine.
24           They say, the cigarette should be conceived
25      not as a product, but as the package.  The product is nicotine.  The cigarette is but one
2      of many layers.  Think of the cigarette pack as
3      a storage container for a day's supply of
4      nicotine.  And they got Fannie to do exactly
5      what they wanted her to do, she was smoking a
6      pack a day, a daily supply of nicotine.
7           The truth is, this industry knows very well
8      beyond any shadow of a doubt that nicotine is
9      the absolute center of their universe.  It's
10      their life blood.  It's their oxygen, and
11      without it they would die.
12           They even reference that in their own
13      documents.  It's all about the nicotine.
14      Nicotine is the sine qua non, without which
15      there is nothing.  We'd all lose our jobs and
16      consulting fees without the chemical compound
17      nicotine.
18           However, we cannot be comfortable selling a
19      product which most of our customers would like
20      to stop using.  They recognized that.  But
21      without nicotine, we could be out of business
22      almost overnight.  They know that.  They know
23      that without nicotine they would die.  They know
24      that nicotine is important.
25           Can we play that?

1 (Thereupon, the video clip was played and transcribed as
2 follows:)
3           We want to be the detectives just as much
4      as the Surgeon General and the AMA.  We'll
5      cooperate in every way.
6           Obviously, until they say it's unsafe, tar
7      and nicotine, I don't think the industry admits
8      there are any bad elements.  If there are bad
9      elements, through our laboratories, through the
10      Surgeon General, through the AMA, through Acts
11      of God and luck, we hope we may find them, and
12      if they are found, they will be removed.
13           We do talk to the question of whether or
14      not cigarettes are hazardous.  We do not believe
15      that cigarettes are hazardous.  We don't accept
16      that.  Because when, as, and if any ingredient
17      in cigarette smoke is identified as being
18      injurious to human health, we are confident that
19      we can eliminate that ingredient.
20           Do you believe that cigarettes are safe?
21      Have they been proven to be safe, Mr. Cullman?
22      I believe they have not been proven to be
23      unsafe.
24 (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)
25           MR. HAMMER:  What you just saw was Howard Cullman in 1963 right after the Surgeon
2      General's report was released, that first one --
3      I'm sorry, 1964, and then Joseph Cullman on Face
4      the Nation in 1971, both of them told the
5      American public, the entire country, that if
6      there are any bad elements or ingredients, they
7      will be removed.
8           And we know the most harmful ingredient in
9      these things is the nicotine because it's the
10      nicotine that keeps people addicted.  It's the
11      nicotine that keeps people smoking.  Without the
12      nicotine, people wouldn't smoke.  They know
13      that.
14           So why not take out the nicotine?  We know
15      they can do it.
16           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object.
17      There's no evidence on that at all.
18           THE COURT:  Sustained.
19           MR. GERAGHTY:  Move to strike.
20           THE COURT:  It will be stricken.
21           MR. HAMMER:  If they wanted to, they could
22      but they don't.
23           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object
24      and move to strike.
25           THE COURT:  Overruled. HAMMER:  You know what, it's never too
2      late to keep a promise.  So do it.  Take out the
3      nicotine and the cigarette would be a hell of a
4      lot safer, but they won't do it.
5           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object
6      and have a motion --
7           THE COURT:  Sustained.
8           MR. HAMMER:  Instead of owning up to their
9      promise to remove the dangerous elements, what
10      do they do?  They chose profits over public
11      health.
12           Dr. Leo Abood -- we saw this document.
13      Remember, Dr. Leo Abood was a scientist who was
14      working to develop an antagonist to nicotine.
15      What that means is something that would block
16      the addictive effect of nicotine.
17           And they realized, in this internal
18      document, Philip Morris realized, wait a minute,
19      if we do that, we're in the process of digging
20      our own graves.  That's incredible.  They don't
21      want to dig their own graves, but they have no
22      qualms, no qualms whatsoever about digging the
23      graves of millions of Americans.
24           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object
25      and move to strike. THE COURT:  Sustained.
2           MR. GERAGHTY:  And I have a motion.
3           MR. HAMMER:  Dr. Niaura, remember, he was
4      our expert witness, he explained to you that he
5      was interested in the diagnosis of nicotine
6      dependence, also known as tobacco dependence,
7      also known as tobacco use disorder.  He told you
8      it's a chronic relapsing brain disease.  He told
9      you, nicotine addiction, those are the terms
10      that are used in medical records to reflect
11      nicotine addiction.
12           We even had Dr. Ticknor on the stand for
13      the defense, remember Mr. Gdanski showed him the
14      codes, and he finally acknowledged, yeah, well,
15      I guess that is for nicotine addiction.  We
16      don't have to look any further than Fannie's own
17      medical records to see that she was addicted to
18      nicotine, nicotine abuse, cigarette abuse,
19      tobacco use disorder.  Remember, that's the
20      record that Mr. Gdanski used with Dr. Ticknor.
21      All of those things reflect nicotine addiction
22      in her medical records.
23           Now, the tobacco companies, the defendants,
24      they admit that smoking cigarettes caused her
25      lung cancer and emphysema, which is a form of COPD.  So let's be clear about that.  They
2      acknowledge that her smoking caused her lung
3      cancer.  They acknowledged that her smoking
4      caused her COPD.
5           And yet, the defense will have you believe
6      that she smoked enough to cause her COPD and
7      lung cancer but not enough to addict her.
8      That's incredible.  That makes no sense
9      whatsoever.  It defies logic.  Think about it,
10      if you use a drug in a chronic fashion, use it
11      daily, day in and day out for many years, isn't
12      it obvious you're probably addicted?
13           Dr. Mannino explained that to you.  It's
14      obvious that people who have diseases caused by
15      an addictive drug were, in fact, addicted to the
16      drug.  And he explained, To me it is, when I see
17      lung cancer or COPD that occurs in longtime
18      smokers, it's easy to connect the dots between
19      their addiction and the development of their
20      disease, lung cancer, COPD.  It's a no-brainer.
21      He's seen that in all of the research he's done.
22           This is Fannie Collar.  Fifty years of
23      smoking.  Fifty years of smoking.  To say she's
24      not addicted, that's crazy.  That's absolutely
25      absurd. Now, we have to prove this case to you by
2      the greater weight of the evidence, which means
3      the more persuasive and convincing force and
4      effect of the entire evidence in the case.
5           In doing so, it's a very simple concept.
6      It's strange because as lawyers we take
7      semesters in law school to learn about the
8      burden of proof in both criminal and civil
9      cases.  It's kind of a complicated issue but I
10      want to try to make it as simple as possible for
11      you.
12           The scales, they start out even.  Before
13      the case starts, they start out even.  In a
14      civil case, as opposed to a criminal case where
15      you have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt and
16      tip the scales all the way, it's -- you have to
17      prove the case by a greater weight of the
18      evidence, Just tip the scales ever so slightly.
19           Now, I think we've done a lot more in this
20      case than that.  Certainly we've presented to
21      you a lot of evidence to show that Fannie is
22      addicted.  The defense attorneys, they want to
23      try to raise a doubt in your mind about whether
24      she was addicted, whether her addiction caused
25      her disease, whether she's entitled to money damage.  They want to raise doubts in your mind
2      about that.
3           However, this is not a criminal case.
4      Doubts don't matter.  If you have a doubt, okay.
5      Well, the benefit of the doubt goes to the
6      plaintiff.  And in these cases we have to tip
7      the scales ever so slightly, just like I showed
8      you the scales.  So we have to tip the scales,
9      and I think we've certainly done that, but let's
10      think and look at some of the evidence of
11      addiction.
12           You heard about Fannie's smoking patterns.
13      She smoked all the time.  She always had a
14      cigarette in her hand.  She smoked her first
15      cigarette of the day right after she woke up.
16      She smoked in bed.  She'd get up in the middle
17      of the night to smoke.  She smoked in
18      restaurants, and then stopped going to
19      restaurants when they didn't allow smoking
20      anymore.
21           She was a chain smoker.  She smoked while
22      cooking, through her pregnancies, she stopped
23      going to the movies.  Without a cigarette, you
24      heard her say she was jangled, irritable,
25      impatient, anxious, couldn't sleep.  She smoked cigarette butts out of her vacuum.  I want to
2      talk about that in a second.
3           She smoked after having her right lung
4      removed.  She repeatedly relapsed.  She had
5      cravings and she still does.  She still has
6      cravings.  She had a persistent desire to quit,
7      and they were unsuccessful time and time again.
8      She tried over 100 times to quit.  You heard
9      that.
10           She tried rationing cigarettes, cutting
11      down, cold turkey, lady's pipe, all of these
12      things.  She tried hypnosis, smoking cessation
13      courses, all of the things Dr. Ticknor talked
14      about, that's what somebody would do who wanted
15      to quit smoking.
16           She tried the patches.  She tried the gum.
17      She tried laser therapy treatments.  Chantix and
18      Wellbutrin, prescription drugs, she was taking
19      prescription drugs to help her stop smoking.
20      Those are certainly signs of somebody who wants
21      to try to quit smoking and who is motivated to
22      try to quit smoking.  You wouldn't do all these
23      things if you weren't motivated.
24           They talk a lot about motivation.  They
25      talk a lot about choice.  This woman tried to quit.  She was too addicted.  She kept
2      relapsing.  That is the sign of an addict.
3           Let's think about that.  She told you, I
4      got my vacuum cleaner, because I used to go
5      around and clean out the ashtrays.  This was the
6      day she was trying to quit, remember.  Think
7      about this.  Think about what it means, imagine
8      seeing one walk over to a dumpster or a garbage
9      can or in Fannie's case opening up a dirty
10      vacuum bag.  We all know what those vacuum bags
11      contain, they're disgusting.  Thinks about that.
12           You go through those dirty contents, you
13      find a cigarette, not a whole cigarette, not a
14      whole cigarette, but a butt of a cigarette that
15      had been smoked and stamped out in an ashtray,
16      and you take that butt and you light it up and
17      you smoke it.  Is that person addicted?  Is that
18      something -- anything rational?
19           In fact, Dr. Ticknor said to you, when
20      Mr. Gdanski asked him about, what about that
21      vacuum cleaner incident, he said, well, that was
22      out of character for her.  Yeah, it was out of
23      character because she was addicted.  That's what
24      addicted people do.  They do things that
25      reasonable people wouldn't do.  What reasonable person would do such a thing?  It's disgusting.
2      She told you, I'm ashamed of it.
3           The defense would have you believe Fannie
4      enjoyed that butt of a cigarette, right?  She's
5      sitting on the floor, going through this dust,
6      she lights up the cigarette, and she enjoyed
7      that cigarette?  That must have really tasted
8      good, right?  Come on, folks, that is a sign of
9      addiction.  If that isn't, then what is?
10           Dr. Ticknor just blows that off.  Tobacco
11      companies would like you to think that's --
12      Fannie chose to do that.  That was her own
13      choice.  She could have not done it.  Yeah, she
14      could have not done it, except their addiction
15      drove her to do that.  It wasn't her choice.
16           The tobacco companies talk a lot about
17      choice.  The choice of the defendants to market
18      cigarettes known to be both addictive and cancer
19      causing raises the question of fault.  You're
20      going to be asked about fault in this case.
21      That should be reserved for the section on
22      fault, when you determine the percentages of
23      fault.
24           When it comes to determining the percentage
25      of fault about the tobacco companies, what they knew about their product, what they didn't tell
2      the public, that's important in answering that
3      question.
4           By the same token, the choice of a child,
5      Fannie Collar at age 12 to start smoking, that
6      also raises a question of fault.  Those choices,
7      the choices she made throughout her life, maybe
8      she could have tried harder, things of that
9      sort, that also goes to the level of fault.  But
10      you shouldn't decide how much either side is at
11      fault when determining whether or not Fannie was
12      addicted.  You need to keep that out of your
13      decision-making process when you're thinking
14      about addiction.
15           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, misstates Your
16      Honor's instructions.
17           THE COURT:  Sustained.
18           MR. GERAGHTY:  I would move to strike.
19           THE COURT:  It will be stricken.
20           MR. HAMMER:  Why am I even talking to you
21      about choice when I'm talking to you about the
22      evidence of addiction?  I'll tell you why,
23      because the tobacco companies, they want to
24      pretend that Fannie wasn't addicted.  But if you
25      think she was addicted, then they want a fallback position.  If she was addicted --
2           MR. GERAGHTY:  I would object to the
3      characterization of the positions.
4           THE COURT:  Overruled.
5           MR. HAMMER:  Judge, this is argument.
6      Thank you.
7           If she was addicted, then it was her
8      choice.  It was her choice to continue smoking
9      long enough to get sick.  Therefore, it was her
10      choice and not her addiction that caused her
11      COPD and lung cancer, that's what the tobacco
12      companies want you to believe.
13           But you know what, not one piece of
14      evidence was presented to you by either side
15      that Fannie Collar's addiction was her choice.
16      You know why, folks, because nobody chooses
17      addiction.  It's simple as that.
18           Addiction is often a terrible side effect
19      of the choice to smoke.  Just like the addiction
20      some people get from prescription pain
21      medications.  No one chooses that addiction
22      either, but it frequently happens as an
23      unintended consequence of the use of the drug.
24           Lawful but dangerous drugs often have side
25      effects, like addiction.  That's why ordinary people say, be careful.  When you're taking
2      those pain medications, when you're taking any
3      medication, be careful, you might get hooked.
4      That's the warning people give.
5           Why do people say that?  I'll tell you why,
6      because addiction is just like a fish getting
7      hooked.  The fish chooses to strike the bait,
8      then gets caught by the hidden hook.  The hook
9      starts pulling the fish along and the fish
10      starts fighting the hook.  Some fish who are
11      hooked just through the side, through the lip,
12      they wiggle away and they get off the hook.
13           Fish that are hooked through the gills,
14      they're hooked.  They're hooked deep.  And
15      they're addicted.  They become hooked and
16      they're goners, and the fishermen know that.
17      The fishermen know that that's why you use bait
18      on the hook in the first place.  No fisherman
19      would ever tell you that the fish was hooked
20      because he chose to get caught.  The fish died
21      because he didn't see the hook in the first
22      place.
23           Fannie Collar, when she was 12 years old,
24      she certainly didn't see that hook.  She went
25      out in blueberry fields with her friend to smoke that pack of cigarettes.  You heard that story.
2      Do you think at 12 years old she ever thought
3      she'd get hooked on tobacco?  Of course not.
4      She didn't see the hook.
5           The tobacco companies, they didn't tell
6      their customers that they thought cigarette were
7      addictive until seven years after Fannie was
8      diagnosed with her lung cancer and COPD, the
9      year 2000.  Instead, for decades they repeatedly
10      told everyone that there was a substantial
11      scientific controversy about whether cigarettes
12      were harmful and about whether they could get
13      you hooked.
14           Now, there were no labels on cigarette
15      packs until 1966.  That wasn't even a warning.
16      It was a caution.  By that time, 1966, Fannie
17      was 32 years old.  She'd been addicted to
18      smoking for years and years.  She was hooked.
19      She was hooked bad.  She tried to get away, but
20      she didn't.  Being hooked eventually led to her
21      strapped to oxygen.  It eventually led to her
22      getting her lung removed, lung cancer, COPD.
23           Now, the tobacco companies want to tell you
24      being hooked had nothing to do with Fannie
25      Collar's lung cancer and COPD.  That's a real fish story.  Fannie chose to smoke at a time
2      when no one knew the real dangers of addiction
3      and disease that are inherent in these things.
4      Nobody knew about that.
5           She started as a 12-year-old little girl in
6      an era when the advertising in the movies never
7      mentioned addiction, never mentioned the harms.
8      They never discussed diseases like COPD,
9      emphysema, lung cancer.  She'd been smoking for
10      about 20 years before the cigarette packs even
11      said, caution, it might be dangerous.  It might
12      be hazardous to your health, but it might not
13      be.  In that amount of time that hook sets deep,
14      very deep.
15           Fannie Collar was pulled along by that hook
16      for more than 40 years.  Folks, she tried to get
17      away.  She tried to fight it, but she didn't get
18      off.  Maybe some of you think she should have
19      tried harder, and that's fair, but that is
20      fault.  It's not class membership or addiction.
21           Right now the defendants want you to
22      believe that Fannie was never hooked.  If you
23      won't believe that, they want you to believe
24      that being hooked didn't contribute to causing
25      her injuries in any way.  Common sense tells you that's nonsense.
2           The reason we all worry about getting
3      hooked is because addiction starts pulling you
4      along, and it's hard to get away.  If you don't
5      get away, you get a horrible disease like COPD
6      and lung cancer.  That's what happened to
7      Fannie.  She didn't get away in time, and at
8      least one important reason was her addiction to
9      nicotine in cigarettes.  That addiction was a
10      big factor in why she didn't get away.
11           They ought to know, they're the ones who
12      put the hook right in.  The defendants put the
13      hook in cigarettes.  They learned that.  They
14      keep the customers hooked because that is the
15      name of their business.  They keep it that way
16      so that people keep buying more cigarettes.
17      They know that.  They want that.
18           They keep nicotine in their products to
19      keep doing that, to keep people hooked, just
20      like they hooked Fannie Collar all the way to
21      the end.  That is the name of their business.
22      Nobody chooses addiction.  Fannie certainly
23      didn't choose to be a drug addict.  Nobody
24      chooses that.
25           The sad thing is the tobacco companies knew that smoking was something that most people
2      would like to stop.  They knew that smoking was
3      something that people can't break.  They
4      characterized that situation as fortunate for us
5      the cigarettes are a habit they can't break.
6      They knew it.  They knew it.  Fortunate for the
7      companies.  How unfortunate for the victims.
8      How unfortunate for Fannie.
9           Throughout the years they acknowledged that
10      nicotine is the center of their universe.  They
11      acknowledge nicotine is addictive, and that they
12      were in the business of selling nicotine, an
13      addictive drug.  That in designing cigarettes,
14      the dominant spec should be nicotine delivery.
15      That nicotine is a potent drug and the industry
16      is based upon the design, manufacture, and sale
17      of attractive forms of nicotine.
18           And they compare their customers to a rat.
19      Compare their customers to a rat, in a cage,
20      pushing a leaver, that's how they talk about
21      their customers.  That's what they think about
22      their drug addicts.  Do they care?  Of course
23      not.
24           The Judge is going to read to you a legal
25      cause instruction.  And she read to you and it's going to be in your packet.  She told you,
2      addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine was
3      a legal cause of plaintiff's lung cancer and/or
4      COPD if it directly and in a natural and
5      continuous sequence produced or contributed
6      substantially to producing such lung cancer
7      and/or COPD so that it can be said but for the
8      addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine, the
9      lung cancer and COPD would not have occurred.
10           But what's missing on this slide?  Choice.
11      You're not going to see the word "choice" on the
12      jury instructions.  You won't see the word
13      "choice" on the verdict form.  That's not on
14      there.  You also won't see the question about
15      what she knew when it comes to addiction.  It
16      isn't what she knew.  It's what happened because
17      of her addiction, and because of these company's
18      lies to sustain that addiction.
19           These tobacco companies told each other, we
20      must give smokers a psychological crutch and a
21      self-rationale for them to continue smoking.
22      That's exactly what they did to Fannie.
23           So we talked about the legal cause
24      instruction.  You see these words.  It says a
25      legal cause.  Not the legal cause, a legal cause.  Contribute substantially basically
2      means, did the addiction play an important role?
3      But for the addiction essentially means if she
4      was not addicted to nicotine, would she have
5      smoked one or more packs per day for more than
6      40 years and developed lung cancer and COPD?
7      That's basically the legal language broken down
8      as simple as possible.
9           What did Dr. Ticknor tell you?  Their own
10      defense expert, he came in and he was asked by
11      Mr. Gdanski, you also agree that if there was no
12      nicotine in cigarettes, most likely Fannie
13      Collar would not have smoked as many cigarettes
14      as she did, true?
15           Fair.
16           Is that true?
17           I believe that's true.
18           Isn't it true, sir, at the end of the day
19      you agree nicotine is a primary reason that
20      Fannie Collar smoked cigarettes?
21           Yes.
22           He acknowledged it.
23           Keep in mind, class membership is a
24      threshold question.  The Engle decision is all
25      inclusive.  The Judge read to you, all Floridians who meet that criteria who were
2      smokers who became addicted and got disease.
3           Nicotine addiction had to play an important
4      role in getting to where Fannie is today.
5      Remember, there's no dispute that smoking
6      cigarettes got her sick.  Fannie Collar was
7      addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes.  There
8      should be no question in your mind.
9           Smoking cigarettes was a legal cause of
10      Fannie Collar's lung cancer or COPD, that's been
11      acknowledged.  Addiction to the nicotine in
12      cigarettes was a legal cause of Fannie Collar's
13      lung cancer or COPD.  It's just a natural
14      sequence of events.
15           Dr. Niaura told you, nicotine addition is
16      the fundamental reason individuals persist in
17      using tobacco products, and this persistent
18      tobacco use contributes to many diseases.  He
19      was asked, is nicotine addiction a fundamental
20      reason smokers continue to smoke?  He said, yes,
21      people wouldn't smoke or use tobacco products
22      unless there was nicotine in them.
23           Think about this, 200 hits of nicotine a
24      day.  That's what's contained in a pack of
25      cigarettes, the daily dose of nicotine.  The daily dose of nicotine that Fannie Collar was
2      smoking day in and day out, 200 hits.  If
3      someone took 200 hits of any other drug every
4      day, would there be any doubt in anyone's mind
5      that that person was addicted?  Of course not.
6           We talked about the Surgeon General's
7      reports, and we made reference to them
8      throughout this case.  The Surgeon General's
9      reports lay out the most current, up-to-date
10      scientific evidence on nicotine addiction and
11      smoking-induced diseases.  It's evidence that's
12      been researched at the highest levels of the
13      Government.
14           Dr. Niaura, remember, he's the guy that
15      wrote in this book the chapter on nicotine
16      addiction.  What did the defense do with
17      Dr. Niaura?  They said, well, Doctor, you're not
18      doing clinical work.  Is that enough to say to
19      the Surgeon General, oh, wait, we can't use your
20      writings?  No, of course not.
21           He's one of the leading men on nicotine
22      research, nicotine addiction.  He wrote the
23      chapter for the Surgeon General.  It doesn't get
24      higher than that.  He told you that nicotine
25      addiction is the fundamental reason smokers continue to smoke.
2           Dr. Mannino, who we called, remember he
3      drew this out for you on the chart.  We put it
4      on the slide here.  He drew out this flow chart
5      to show you how addiction causes disease.
6           The point is that the originating element
7      is nicotine addiction, which causes tobacco
8      smoke intake, which causes the damage to the
9      cells, which causes lung cancer and COPD.  He
10      explained that to you.  He took it to you.  He
11      walked you right through it.  It's common sense.
12           This industry, this tobacco industry, they
13      can abolish the chain of people who have been
14      smoking cigarettes by removing nicotine.
[#DELETED OBJECTION DIALOGUE#]
23           MR. HAMMER:  Thank you, Judge.
24           You heard evidence in this case from
25      Dr. Proctor.  The rise in lung cancer was directly related to the cigarettes.  That's how
2      those studies were made.  That's how Dr. Wynder
3      and all of the scientific research that was out
4      there, they came to that conclusion, cigarettes
5      caused cancer.
6           Why?  Because before the cigarettes like
7      these, there was no lung cancer.  They created
8      it.  It's a manmade epidemic, manmade by these
9      tobacco companies.  When people use tobacco
10      products over long periods of time, they develop
11      tobacco-related, smoking-related illnesses, they
12      all go together.  Had she never been addicted to
13      nicotine, would she have developed lung cancer
14      or emphysema?  Probably not.  Most likely not.
15      That's what we have to prove to you in this
16      case, probably, more likely than not.
17           We brought in world class experts.
18      Dr. Niaura wrote the book on nicotine addiction
19      for the Surgeon General, a chapter.  He wrote a
20      book, a handbook that psychiatrists use.  He
21      wrote the book.
22           We brought in Dr. Proctor.  He wrote the
23      Golden Holocaust, which is a study of the
24      tobacco industry internal documents, and we
25      brought him to you.  And he was a writer of the -- the editor of the Surgeon General's 2014.
2      And Dr. Mannino wrote the chapter on COPD for
3      the Surgeon General.
4           We brought to you world-renowned experts.
5      They've written hundreds of articles,
6      peer-reviewed research, written articles for the
7      Surgeon General, go around lecturing around the
8      world about their knowledge.  They are world
9      class experts.
10           They brought in to you Dr. Ticknor, who is
11      a psychiatrist who practices.  But what did he
12      tell you?  He told you he's never written
13      anything.  He's never done any research.  He's
14      got no credentials, other than the fact that
15      he's a psychiatrist and treats people.  Most of
16      his practice isn't nicotine addiction.  It's
17      entirely different.
18           They bring him in because he's the team
19      psychiatrist for the San Antonio Spurs.  That's
20      great.  What did he tell you about nicotine
21      addiction?  They brought him in to raise some
22      doubt in your mind.  That's why they brought him
23      in.  Doubt doesn't count in this case.
24           Then, when he was confronted with the NIDA
25      definition -- so he said the APA, the American Psychiatric Association, which he's a proud
2      member of, and NIDA, they defined addiction a
3      certain way.  And Mr. Gdanski asked him, isn't
4      it true that you agree that Fannie Collar, her
5      use of cigarettes caused chronic brain changes?
6      That's part of the definition.
7           It isn't true, Dr. Ticknor, that Fannie
8      Collar had compulsive use of cigarettes?  Part
9      of the definition.  Isn't it true, Dr. Ticknor,
10      that she smoked despite horrible consequences?
11      Part of the definition recognized by the
12      American Psychiatric Association and by NIDA.
13      And he says, well, Doctor, isn't it true that
14      Fannie by that definition was addicted?  He
15      says, no.  How is that possible?  How is that
16      credible?
17           Then he talks about -- remember that
18      rainbow that he made, that rainbow spectrum that
19      he made?  He's talking about -- first of all,
20      talking about his testimony.  He's testified in
21      about a dozen cases.  Now, Mr. Gdanski, here is
22      the Collar case, so that's -- he counts through,
23      one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
24      nine, ten, eleven, including the Collar case.
25      He clearly told the jury once again that that smoker is not addicted to nicotine.
2           That's what he does.  The tobacco companies
3      went and found him, taught him how to be an
4      expert witness, and they bring him in.  Not
5      because of his writings, not because of his
6      research, not because of his scholar, but
7      because they trained him how to be an expert
8      witness.
9           They put this rainbow up and you put -- you
10      don't put Fannie anywhere on the rainbow?  She's
11      not even on the spectrum?  That's correct.  You
12      know, at least if he put her under mild or
13      moderate, you could say, okay, well, maybe
14      that's reasonable.  At least he's being
15      reasonable.  But to not even put her on the
16      spectrum of tobacco dependence, that's absurd.
17      That is absurd.
18           The Judge read to you the believability of
19      witnesses.  The most important part of this
20      section is reject it.  You have the power to
21      reject the testimony of an expert.  I say he is
22      not worthy of believing.  He just isn't.
23      Nothing but doubt.  That's what he tried to cast
24      on you.
25           Let's take a look at the verdict form.  Was Fannie Collar addicted to cigarettes containing
2      nicotine, and if so, was her addiction a legal
3      cause of her lung cancer or COPD?
4           Remember, class membership is not about
5      fault.  We're asking you to confirm that Fannie
6      Collar is obviously a member of the Engle class.
7      It should be very, very simple to answer that
8      question.  Folks, if Fannie is not a member of
9      that class, then who is?  Who is?
10           Class membership is not about fault.  Keep
11      that concept in front of your mind as you listen
12      to the defense attorney's arguments.  When
13      you're answering Question 1, don't get hung up
14      with their arguments that Fannie might have been
15      at fault for not trying to quit.
16           On the verdict form there's a question
17      about class membership and then there's --
18      further down there's a question about fault.
19      Two separate issues.  Please keep those issues
20      separate in your mind as you decide class
21      membership.  Because you could find that she is
22      a class member even if you think she should have
23      tried harder to quit, because the question is,
24      was she addicted, and did her addiction cause
25      her disease? It's not about the fault of either party.
2      It's not about whether the smoker shares some
3      responsibility.  It's not about whether the
4      addict loses total control.  It's not whether
5      addicts can quit.  And it's not even about
6      reliance on tobacco company statements.  That's
7      not part of the class membership.  That comes in
8      later, too.
9           These tobacco companies, they want you to
10      focus all eyes on Fannie.  So do we, but we also
11      want you to look at their behavior throughout
12      this case.  They are using millions of pounds of
13      menthol and licorice, theobromine, ammonia in
14      their cigarettes, additives.  Their cigarettes
15      are full of poisons and carcinogens like arsenic
16      and cyanide and radioactive plutonium.
17           They say she should have quit smoking.
18      They should have quit, too.  They should have
19      quit lying.
20           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object
21      for the reasons discussed earlier.
22           THE COURT:  Sustained.
23           MR. HAMMER:  Judge, can we approach?
24           THE COURT:  Yes.
25 (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.) HAMMER:  Judge, this case is all about
2      the tobacco companies lying.
3           THE COURT:  They should have quit, too?
4           MR. HAMMER:  They should have quit, too.
5      They should have quit lying.
6           THE COURT:  You didn't say that.
7           MR. HAMMER:  That's what I just said.
8           THE COURT:  They should have quit, too.
9           MR. GERAGHTY:  The implication was they
10      should have quit making cigarettes.
11           MR. HAMMER:  No.  They should have quit
12      lying.
13           THE COURT:  You didn't say that.
14           MR. HAMMER:  Well, that's exactly what I
15      said.  They may not have picked it up.  That's
16      exactly what I said.
17           THE COURT:  All I heard was, you said it
18      after they should have quit --
19           MR. HAMMER:  Right.  They should have quit,
20      too.  They should have quit lying.  That's a
21      totally appropriate argument.
22           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor instructed the
23      jury that manufacturing and selling cigarettes
24      were lawful activities.  They can't tell us we
25      should stop making cigarettes.  It's the third or fourth time he's implied that.
2           THE COURT:  All I heard was, she should
3      have quit.  They should have quit, too.  And
4      then you objected, and he said, they should have
5      quit lying.
6           MR. GERAGHTY:  He said that here.
7           MR. HAMMER:  No, that's not what I said
8      here.  The record reflects what I said.
9           THE COURT:  So after he objected, I
10      sustained.
11           MR. GERAGHTY:  All right.  Well, Your
12      Honor, he can't continue to make arguments that
13      we should stop making cigarettes.  That's
14      contrary to Your Honor's instruction.
15           THE COURT:  He didn't.
16           MR. GERAGHTY:  That was the implication.
17      There was a pregnant pause and he waited.
18           MR. HAMMER:  That's clear.  Can I please
19      continue?
20           THE COURT:  Yes, it does say that --
21 22           MR. HAMMER:  May I proceed?
23           THE COURT:  You may.
24           MR. HAMMER:  May it please the Court.
25           Yeah, they should have quit.  They should have quit lying.  But lying is their life blood.
2           They say she should have quit smoking in
3      the 1950s.  Remember that whole thing they were
4      talking about, well, in the '50s when your
5      foster father died and the co-worker's wife
6      died, you should have quit.  What did she know
7      then?  What did she really know about smoking,
8      cancer, and COPD?  COPD wasn't even a word back
9      then.  What did she know?
10           What if they had stopped lying in the
11      1950s?  What if they would have stopped lying in
12      the 1950s and said, cigarettes do cause cancer?
13      That would have had an effect on her, don't you
14      think?
15           They say she should have quit when her
16      husband Mert preached to her about smoking.  Of
17      course at the time he was smoking three packs a
18      day.  He was smoking three packs a day, and they
19      want you to believe that every day he was
20      preaching to her, you got to quit, as he's
21      sucking down three packs a day.  How absurd is
22      that?  But she should have quit, she was warned.
23           They say she should have quit in the 1960s.
24      When the first Surgeon General's report came out
25      and when the caution label went on the cigarette packs, and her father-in-law showed her the
2      warning on the side of the packs, she should
3      have quit.
4           What did she tell us?  She was smoking
5      filters.  He was smoking Camels, unfilters.  She
6      thought she was safe.  Why did she think she was
7      safe?  Because of the lies they told her.  She
8      believed it.  What if they would have told the
9      truth in the 1960s instead of going on TV like
10      we saw Howard Cullman do earlier and say, if
11      there's any bad elements, we'll remove them.
12           Why?  Think if he would have gone on TV and
13      said, you know, that Surgeon General, he's the
14      doctor of the United States, he's saying it
15      causes cancer and we agree.  So ladies and
16      gentlemen, stop smoking.  Until we can do
17      further research and tell you it's safe, stop
18      smoking.  Think about that impact.  Think about
19      that impact.
20           Their mantra is choice, choice, choice.
21      They say she smoked herself sick.  It serves her
22      right.  They blame the victim and absolve the
23      perpetrator.
24           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object.
25           THE COURT:  Sustained. GERAGHTY:  I object and move to strike.
2           THE COURT:  It will be stricken.  You may
3      proceed.
4           MR. HAMMER:  We don't live in a society
5      that absolves the corporations of the
6      responsibility for their products.  If you're
7      going to make a product, then you make it safe.
8      That's the American way.
9           In this country corporations are held
10      responsible for the products they make.  That's
11      what we're asking you to do in this courtroom.
12      They're making a product.  Hold them responsible
13      for it.  Do the right thing.
14           MR. GERAGHTY:  This misstates Your Honor's
15      instructions.
16           MR. HAMMER:  The defense likes to use terms
17      such as "choice" and "decision" when they talk
18      about Fannie.  What about the tobacco industry?
19      What about their choices and their decisions?
20      They say that Fannie smoked despite the risk.
21      But they made the decision to form this
22      enterprise of lies and deceit in 1953.  There
23      was a lie about a deadly and addictive product
24      despite the risks to the public.  Those risks
25      were massive. We've seen the total of those risks.  The
2      people in charge of these tobacco companies
3      throughout the years, they made decisions, they
4      made choices between the physical health of
5      their customers and their own financial
6      well-being.  There's nothing wrong with making
7      money if you're a corporation.  But if you're
8      going to do it, do it the right way.
9           Don't kill people.  They chose concealment
10      over disclosure.  They chose sales over safety.
11      They chose money over morality.  They knew that
12      people smoked for nicotine and that smoking
13      kills.  Knowing that, what did they choose to
14      do?  They chose to manipulate the nicotine in
15      cigarettes to make them more addictive.
16           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, there's no
17      evidence.
18           THE COURT:  Sustained.
19           MR. GERAGHTY:  Move to strike.
20           THE COURT:  It will be stricken.
21           MR. HAMMER:  If they'd been honest, they
22      had all these scientists working in their
23      facilities, working in their labs, you saw these
24      memos written by them internally, just imagine
25      if those scientists -- because they were really good scientists, very smart people, imagine if
2      they devoted their life to curing cancer instead
3      of hiding the truth.  Imagine that.  Imagine
4      how different this world would have been if
5      they'd told the truth, told smokers the truth.
6      That's all we're asking.
7           You're going to have to determine fault in
8      this case.  You're also going to have to
9      determine responsibility, the percentage to
10      apply.  Here is the verdict.  So on Question 1,
11      was Fannie addicted to cigarettes containing
12      nicotine, and if so, was her addiction a legal
13      cause of her lung cancer and COPD?
14           Of course.  We ask you to check that box
15      off on the verdict form.  This is basically the
16      form you're going to be dealing with.  Check
17      that box off yes and let's move on to the rest
18      of the verdict form.
19           The next question you're going to be asked
20      about is fault, the percentage of fault of R.J.
21      Reynolds, Philip Morris, and of Fannie.  Now,
22      Fannie, quite frankly, she told you, she doesn't
23      see herself having any fault based on what she
24      knew compared to what they knew.  I want to talk
25      about that. As a class member, all of the Engle
2      findings apply to Fannie Collar.  The Judge read
3      to you the Engle findings --
4           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, this is not the
5      instruction Your Honor gave.
6           THE COURT:  Sustained.
7           MR. GERAGHTY:  Neither is that page, Your
8      Honor.
9           MR. HAMMER:  Wait a minute.  All right.
10      I'll move on.  You guys have the Engle findings.
11      I don't need to read them to you.  We'll talk
12      about those.
13           Everything you need to know about this case
14      about fault is right here.  The Frank Statement
15      in 1954, these companies, except for Liggett,
16      they didn't sign on to the Frank Statement in
17      1954, but they joined the Tobacco Institute
18      years later.  Remember the Tobacco Institute?
19      They were the spokespeople for the entire
20      tobacco industry.
21           So when the Judge read to you this thing
22      about the organizations, that includes the
23      Tobacco Institute.  It includes the TIRC, the
24      CTR, all of the spokespeople for tobacco spoke
25      on behalf of Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, and Liggett.  They were their mouthpiece basically.
2           In 1954 they took out that full page ad in
3      450 newspapers across the country, a Frank
4      Statement to smokers, the truth about cigarette
5      smokers.  That's what they wanted to do.  And
6      what they said is, we accept an interest in
7      people's health as a basic responsibility.
8           In 1954 they told the public and they told
9      people like Fannie, we accept the
10      responsibility.  So all we're asking you to do
11      today in this courtroom is hold them to that
12      responsibility that they accepted back in 1954
13      and continued to accept throughout the years.
14           Now, knowledge of harm, and smoking despite
15      that knowledge, like Fannie did, that's actually
16      a sign of addiction.  What she knew can be
17      relevant evidence to you.  You can use it to
18      decide if she was at fault.
19           We argue that her fault is excised or
20      lessened by her addiction.  What do I mean by
21      that?  Meaning I said to you fault doesn't
22      matter for addiction.  However, addiction can
23      certainly matter for fault.  Because of her
24      addiction, how can you hold her to be at fault?
25      She was addicted, and she was addicted by these companies.  If it wasn't for the nicotine in
2      cigarettes, she would not have become addicted.
3      She would not have smoked the number of
4      cigarettes she smoked.  She would not have
5      gotten lung cancer and COPD and be strapped to
6      an oxygen tank.
7           The tobacco industry from 1940 to 2004,
8      $250 billion.  Think about this.  The tobacco
9      industry, Dr. Proctor told you this, spent more
10      on advertising in one day, in one day, than the
11      National Clearinghouse on Smoking, which was the
12      health organization putting out the message
13      don't smoke spent in an entire year.  In one
14      year that the Public Health Community spent, the
15      tobacco companies spent in one day.  They
16      drowned out the message.  They drowned out the
17      message.  Advertising drowned out all of the
18      other messages that were out there.  The Surgeon
19      General, they had no chance against this.  Of
20      course it drowns out the message.
21           Marlboro cigarettes, remember we saw this
22      video.  I want to show you --
23 (Thereupon, the video clip was played as follows:)
24           SPEAKER:  Combined sales reached
25      105 billion in 1972 making Marlboro the best selling cigarette in the world.  It has remained
2      the leader ever since.  Marlboro is far and away
3      the leader in the cigarette industry, and the
4      trend is continually upward.  In 1990 Marlboro
5      sold more than 344 billion cigarettes worldwide,
6      making it the most widely packaged consumer
7      goods product in the world.
8 (Thereupon, the video clip was concluded.)
9           MR. HAMMER:  More packages of this sold
10      than any other consumer product in the history
11      of the world.  That's incredible.  In the
12      history of the world.
13           They brag about their success.
14           Who was in control.  Who was really in
15      control of this cigarette?  Was Fannie Collar in
16      control of this or were those tobacco companies?
17           Who was in control?  In their own documents
18      nicotine should be delivered at about 1 to
19      1.3 milligrams per cigarette minimum for
20      confirmed smokers.  They knew exactly what they
21      were doing.  They knew exactly what they were
22      doing.  They controlled every aspect of the
23      cigarette.  They manipulated it for
24      inhalability, micro adjusted the nicotine
25      levels, ammoniation to increase the freebased nicotine, glucurone sugars controlling pH
2      levels, adding menthol, adding licorice, all to
3      control the cigarette.  What chance did Fannie
4      have?
5           Remember what Dr. Proctor told you about
6      inhalability.  Do cigarettes have chemicals
7      added to them?  Yes.  But also tragically and
8      ironically, the harms of cigarettes, even though
9      they're becoming milder, they were more likely
10      to have been inhaled.  It was the inhalation
11      that caused most of the harm.  They spent tens
12      of billions of dollars, tens of billions of
13      dollars to design this thing.
14           This isn't just some tobacco rolled up in
15      paper.  Tens of billions of dollars to design
16      this perfect delivery device.
17           What chance did Fannie have?
18           Let's take a look at the ads.  I'm sorry,
19      before we do that -- who controls the amount of
20      ammonia in the Marlboro cigarette?  That's the
21      manufacturer.  They control every aspect of this
22      cigarette.  Let's take a look at some of the
23      ads.  We saw these.
24 (Thereupon, the video clip was played and transcribed as
25 follows:) SPEAKER:  What cigarette do you smoke?
2      You'll be interested to know how the doctors of
3      America answered that question.  Doctors in
4      every branch of medicine were asked, what
5      cigarettes do you smoke.
6           When you change to Philip Morris, you will
7      feel better.
8           Don't miss the bus, smoking bus, miss the
9      bus, smoking bus.
10           Do you inhale?  Then you're better off
11      smoking Philip Morris, and here is how you can
12      prove it.
13           Let's take a Winston break.  That's it.
14      Winston is the one filtered cigarette that
15      delivers flavor 20 times a pack.  Winston has
16      got that filter flavor.
17 (Thereupon, the video clip concluded.)
18           MR. HAMMER:  We saw these commercials.  We
19      don't have to keep watching them.  They made it
20      look like fun.  They made funny jokes about it.
21      They don't say that filters are phony and fake.
22      They don't say that this product is addictive
23      and will kill you.  They don't say it's going to
24      make you end up in a wheelchair strapped to an
25      oxygen tank later in life.  They make it fun. They make it enjoyable.  That's the image they
2      portrayed, and people bought into it.  So did
3      Fannie Collar.
4           If there are any truth in advertising, they
5      would say those things.  They would say, hey,
6      smoking gives you cancer, so quit smoking.
7      Smoking gives you COPD, so quit smoking.
8      Smoking is going to kill you, so quit smoking.
9      Smoking is addictive, so let us help you break
10      the habit.
11           If there was any truth.
12           They don't do that.
13           The defendants, I'm sure you heard it
14      throughout the course of the trial, they talk
15      about the warning labels.  Well, these cigarette
16      packs, they had warning labels so Fannie should
17      have known.  The public was warned.  The public
18      should have known better.  They tell you there's
19      warning labels on every pack, and Fannie must
20      have seen them.  So therefore, they should be
21      absolved of any wrongdoing, right?  It's like
22      their get out of jail free card, free pass.  It
23      allows them to kill millions of people.
24           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object
25      and move to strike that last comment. THE COURT:  Sustained.
2           MR. GERAGHTY:  Motion, Your Honor.
3           THE COURT:  Sustained.
4           MR. HAMMER:  Sure, their packs have warning
5      labels on them.  They were obligated to put them
6      on under the law.  But these companies also had
7      an obligation not to lie.  They were obligated
8      to put the labels on, and they were obligated
9      not to lie.  If you're going to make a product,
10      don't lie about it.
11           An addict needs a straightforward message,
12      not a mixed message.  The mixed message is the
13      warnings tell you one thing on the pack and the
14      industry telling that same addict, it's okay, go
15      ahead and smoke.  The filter will take out
16      anything bad.  Don't worry about it.  If it's
17      proven it's bad, we'll stop making it.  What
18      kind of mixed message is that to an addict?
19           THE COURT:  It's been one hour.
20           MR. HAMMER:  Thank you.
21           Let's think about that.  Think about this
22      for a second.  Imagine this, you see a child
23      walking to the end of the diving board above an
24      empty pool.  There's a no diving sign.  But the
25      kid didn't see it.  You walk right past the sign, and he's about to dive into an empty pool.
2           What do you do?  What would any reasonable
3      person do?  They'd stand on the side of the pool
4      and yell to that kid, wait, don't jump in,
5      whatever they could to keep him from doing harm
6      to himself, right?
7           You don't say, well, there's a sign there,
8      so if he falls in, oh, well, that's his fault.
9      He didn't see the sign.  He didn't pay attention
10      to the sign.  It's his fault.  Of course not.
11           Warning labels, yeah, they were on there.
12      Caution label, '70s, 1985.  Twenty years after
13      Fannie started smoking.  Twenty-four years and
14      39 years after Fannie started smoking.  She was
15      hooked by then.  She was hooked by then.
16           What are these warning labels telling her?
17      What did she tell you?  She told you, I didn't
18      really look at the warning labels.  I don't look
19      at a box of cocoa every time I make myself a cup
20      of cocoa.
21           Let's talk about the obvious.  Everybody
22      knows what a dollar bill looks like.  We touch
23      it every single day of our lives many, many
24      times a day.  At least 20 times a day probably
25      we touch a dollar bill.  We see it, hold it in your hand every single day.  It's in your
2      pocket.  Does anyone really know what's on the
3      back of a one dollar bill?
4           They bring in signs with the warning labels
5      on it blown up big, huge.  We bring you in the
6      cigarette pack that shows the actual warning
7      labels.  They don't want to show their logos and
8      the warning labels.  They're not proud of it.
9      They are not even proud of their industry enough
10      to show it to you.  They hide.  They hide in
11      plain site.  That's what they do.
12           Even though they were required by law to
13      put the warning labels on, they use these
14      warning labels as a defense to say that Fannie
15      should have known and, therefore, she should
16      have quit.  But meeting the legal minimum does
17      not supplant the moral maximus.  Think about
18      that.
19           Who controlled their business choices?  Who
20      controlled the level of nicotine?  Who
21      controlled the manipulation?  Who controlled the
22      addictive nature?  Who was responsible for the
23      conduct of the tobacco companies?  The tobacco
24      companies.  They're responsible for putting
25      Fannie in this shape. The industry was not motivated to put lives
2      and health of customers above profit.  Instead,
3      the industry continued to make choices which had
4      health consequences.
5           What chance did Fannie have?  What chance
6      did she have?  Their business model should be,
7      cure, don't cause.
8           We talked about the fact that they're a
9      corporation.  You may not discriminate between
10      corporations and individuals.  I agree.  If
11      you're going to be a corporation and you want to
12      be treated as a person, act like a person.  Act
13      like a person.
14           You know, we learned everything we ever
15      needed to know in kindergarten.  Robert Fulton
16      wrote a book about it.  How do you behave to
17      other people?  Be decent, be nice, be
18      responsible.  Don't hurt the other guy.  You
19      want to be treated like a person, then do the
20      right thing.  Don't do it because it's all about
21      money.
22           The tobacco companies and their executives,
23      they celebrated their wins.  They celebrated the
24      money they made.  That's all they cared about.
25      They put money ahead of lives.  They turned a blind eye to the suffering of people like Fannie
2      Collar.  They didn't care.  They didn't give one
3      thought about Fannie Collar or the millions of
4      Americans whose lives they destroyed.
5           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object
6      and move to strike that last comment.
7           THE COURT:  Overruled.
8           MR. HAMMER:  They didn't care about Fannie.
9      So when it comes down to the verdict form, we
10      already talked about Question Number 1.  When
11      you go down to decide the fault, I would suggest
12      to you -- that's what I would suggest to you:
13      These tobacco companies, they are to blame.  How
14      can you fault Fannie Collar as a 12-year-old
15      little girl sitting there in a blueberry field
16      smoking and continuing to smoke when all they
17      did was lie to her the entire time she smoked?
18           You know, if you think, well, maybe Fannie
19      should be held to blame, then you ought to give
20      her very, very little fault in comparison to
21      these tobacco companies.  Certainly maybe 5 or
22      10 percent at the most.  But I would suggest to
23      you, how do you hold her to blame, based on what
24      she knew compared to what they knew?
25           Now, these are the Engle findings.  I particularly want to focus on 5 and 6 here.
2           Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, they
3      concealed or omitted material information
4      knowing that material information was false and
5      misleading.  And they agreed, all three
6      defendants, Philip Morris, Liggett and R.J.
7      Reynolds, they agreed with the other companies
8      and the industry organizations, TI, TIRC, CTR,
9      to conceal or omit information regarding the
10      health with the intention that smokers and the
11      public would rely on this information to their
12      detriment.
13           That's what they counted on.
14           Although Fannie may not have attributed any
15      particular statement to R.J. Reynolds or Liggett
16      or Philip Morris, what did she tell you?  She
17      repeatedly heard the tobacco industry in general
18      talk about smoking, talking about the fact that
19      filters are safe, talking about the fact that if
20      they're dangerous, we'll stop making them,
21      talking about the fact that smoke filters, it
22      takes out the bad stuff.  She heard that
23      repeatedly, not just once.
24           MR. BELASIC:  Objection.  Misstates the
25      evidence, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Overruled.
2           MR. HAMMER:  She heard that repeatedly
3      throughout the years.  She told you that.
4           What chance did Fannie Collar have against
5      these tobacco companies since they all agreed?
6           And what did Dr. Proctor tell you, the
7      Tobacco Institute spoke for all of the
8      defendants.  Philip Morris was a paid member
9      R.J. was a paid member.  Liggett was a paid
10      member on and off.  And the Tobacco Institute
11      would go on TV and speak for the companies very
12      often.  Not just one time, very often.  We saw
13      examples of that.  There's no doubt they
14      concealed information.
15           This is the verdict form you're going to
16      get.  There's no doubt they concealed
17      information.  There's no doubt they entered into
18      an agreement to conceal it.  The findings, which
19      are binding upon all of us, make it clear that
20      they did so with the intention that smokers like
21      Fannie Collar and members of the public would
22      rely on it.  These issues are not in dispute.
23           The horror is they knew it was affecting
24      people.  That's the horror.  They knew they were
25      lying and they knew people were trusting them and they knew people were dying from their lies
2      and they kept doing it.  That's just wrong,
3      folks.
4           Fannie told you she trusted them, just like
5      millions of other people.
6           In their own documents it says, our basic
7      position in the cigarette controversy is subject
8      to the charge and may be subject to a finding
9      that we are making false or misleading
10      statements to promote the sale of cigarettes.
11      That's exactly what Fannie told you she heard,
12      but the tobacco industry told us it was not
13      dangerous, and I depended on their statements
14      more than the Surgeon General because they were
15      the ones producing the cigarettes and they would
16      have more idea of what was in them than the
17      Surgeon General in her opinion.  Was she naive?
18      Maybe.  But so were millions of other Americans.
19           MR. GERAGHTY:  I would object and move to
20      strike the last comment.
21           THE COURT:  Sustained.  It will be
22      stricken.
23           MR. HAMMER:  They admit internally that
24      they're making false statements and misleading
25      the public to sell cigarettes.  That's their lies.  Doubt is their product.  Doubt is their
2      product.
3           When no one was looking, they did an awful
4      lot of things.  It's been said that the
5      character -- character is defined by what you do
6      when you think no one is looking.  Character is
7      defined by what you do when you think no one is
8      looking.  Let's look at the character of these
9      companies.  When no one was looking, they lied,
10      they misled, they committed a fraud to the
11      public, they formed an enterprise to conceal or
12      omit information, they buried and destroyed
13      documents, they manipulated the product.
14           And then when people came looking for
15      answers, what did they do?  Did they tell the
16      truth?  No.  They manufactured doubt.  Doubt is
17      their product.
18           Again, the word is confusion.  Doubt is our
19      product.  The success, they brag about the
20      success of the TIRC.  It's been a successful
21      defensive operation.  They talk about giving
22      smokers a psychological crutch.  That's exactly
23      what they did to Fannie.  Exactly what they did
24      to Fannie.
25           She told us again, I always depended on what the tobacco industry was telling the
2      public.  I didn't think you people would be
3      lying.  I believed you.
4           In their forwarding memo they said how to
5      free Americans from the guilty fear, free them
6      from the guilty fear.  That's exactly what they
7      did, they gave them a crutch.  Lies cost lives,
8      folks.  Lies cost lives.
9           The tobacco industry, they misled the
10      public about the safety of filters and Fannie
11      bought into it.  You remember these documents.
12      Fannie bought into them.  She told you.  It was
13      filtering out all the impurities, the illusion
14      of filtration.  They lied.
15           Based on historical record, Dr. Proctor
16      told you that the filters caused disease,
17      filters caused death.
18           Fannie didn't know what these tobacco
19      companies knew.  She didn't know they formed
20      this enterprise to fraudulently conceal the
21      lethal effects.  She didn't know they hired
22      scientists and doctors to lie.  She didn't know
23      that they misled the Surgeon General to smear
24      and belittle public health officials, that they
25      targeted children, that they knew 50 percent of smokers would die.  She didn't know that smoking
2      cigarettes was killing hundreds of thousands of
3      Americans.  She didn't know they manipulated the
4      levels of nicotine.  She didn't know there were
5      70 cancer-causing agents.  She didn't know there
6      were chemicals like arsenic and cyanide and
7      radioactive polonium.  She didn't know these
8      things.  Who did?  They did.  They did, and they
9      kept it from her and the rest of the world.
10      Why?  For money.
11           Dr. Proctor talked about the fact that the
12      whole concept, the whole point of the enterprise
13      was to create a deception.  And it worked for
14      decades and Fannie fell for it.
15           Talked about Liggett, Liggett's activities.
16      They conducted research internally with contract
17      research organizations.  But they, generally,
18      like the other companies, they did not say
19      publicly that smoking caused harm.
20           Fannie may not have smoked Liggett
21      cigarettes, but Liggett made a choice to join
22      the TI.  Before they made that choice, they had
23      an opportunity, they had an opportunity to come
24      out and tell the truth.  They could have said,
25      you know what, what's been going on for the past few years with these other organizations, we
2      don't agree with that.
3           Instead they jumped right in.  Jumped right
4      in.  Why?  Because they saw how much money those
5      other companies were making.  That's why they
6      did it.
7           You saw the document from Liggett.  They
8      knew cancer causing, cancer promoting,
9      poisonous.  There should be no confusion about
10      the confusion, folks.  There was no doubt or
11      confusion internally that cigarettes caused
12      cancer they knew it.  There should be no doubt
13      about the doubt.
14           We talked about reliance.  We have shown by
15      a greater weight of the evidence that Fannie
16      relied to her detriment on the defendants'
17      concealment and agreement to conceal.  Of course
18      we did.  The lies told by Philip Morris and R.J.
19      Reynolds and the other members of the agreement,
20      like Liggett, they influenced Fannie Collar just
21      like tens of millions of Americans exactly as
22      they planned.  That's what caused Fannie's lung
23      cancer.  She relied on those statements.
24 (Thereupon, the video clip was played to the jury as
25 follows:) SPEAKER:  This is 20/20.
2           We asked Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds,
3      Brown & Williamson and Lorillard to appear on
4      this program.  None would.  They told us to talk
5      to the Tobacco Institute.  The Institute said
6      Ann Browder would speak for them.
7           The jury has not come in.
8           It may not be harmful.  You're not
9      convinced.
10           It may be or it may not be.  We don't know.
11 (Thereupon, the video clip was concluded.)
12           MR. HAMMER:  That's what they're telling
13      the public in 1983, despite what they know in
14      their internal documents.
15           Fannie Collar was this industry's perfect
16      customer.  Their internal documents set out
17      their plan for smokers like her, and she
18      followed that plan to a tee.  She did exactly
19      what they wanted her to do, just like millions
20      of other people.  She switched to filtered
21      cigarettes.  She relied on their statements and
22      she continued smoking for many, many years.  She
23      was swept up in the effects of their lies and
24      deceit and concealment, along with millions the
25      others.  She was influenced by their conduct. She told you that.
2           Consider the scope of that conduct.
3      Targeting kids as replacement smokers.
4           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object
5      and have a motion.
6           THE COURT:  Sustained.
7           MR. HAMMER:  Advertisements, counter
8      messaging, disinformation packets, health
9      reassurances, and a campaign of death.  What
10      chance did Fannie Collar have?
11           They promised to stop making cigarettes if
12      it was determined that they were harmful.  They
13      made that promise.  They didn't stop it.  They
14      lied about that too.  Fannie told you she heard
15      that and relied upon it.
16           You heard the jury instruction on these two
17      topics.  Agreement to conceal -- and let's go to
18      the verdict form.  I'll ask you, did Fannie rely
19      on this misinformation?  Did Fannie rely on
20      these lies?  Did Fannie rely upon their campaign
21      of doubt?  Their lies?  Of course she did.  Did
22      it cause her to keep on smoking, keep on being
23      addicted, to get disease?  Of course.
24           That's why I ask you to check off "yes" to
25      all of these boxes, including Liggett. Including Liggett, RJR, Philip Morris.  They all
2      agreed hand in hand to lie to the American
3      public and perpetuate that lie for decades.
4           We're also going to be asking you to give
5      Fannie money for her pain and suffering.
6      Everything you need to learn about Fannie you
7      can see from her medical records.  COPD
8      exacerbation.  Think about this.  Fannie got
9      lung cancer in 1993.  They said, yeah, but she's
10      cured.  She's cured?  They took out her lung.
11      They cut her open like a can opener to take out
12      her lung.  She went through radiation treatments
13      for 8 weeks.  She had complications, had to be
14      hospitalized for 45 days.  She's cured, as if
15      she took some magic pill and she's all better.
16      Really, folks?  That's what they want you to
17      believe.  She is fine.  She's cured.  She's got
18      COPD.  She's had it since 1993, and it's only
19      going to get worse.  Only going to get worse.
20           The medical records.  She's got severe
21      obstruction as late as 2013.  Severe
22      obstruction.  She's going to be tied to this
23      thing.  She doesn't like it.  Do you think she
24      likes sucking oxygen through a tube?  Do you
25      think she likes that?  She told you she was active.  She was vibrant.  She loved life.  She
2      loved life.  She told you she's not going to
3      stop.  She doesn't want to be in a rocking
4      chair.
5           And then, basically, Dr. Suen told you
6      everything you need to know.  You heard from
7      Dr. Suen, her treating pulmonologist.  He takes
8      care of her even today.
9           I'm not going to play that.
10           Remember she was asked -- Dr. Mannino was
11      asked by Mr. Geraghty, do you think she
12      considered her disabled when she was able to
13      walk three miles after her surgery?  Do you
14      think she considered herself disabled?  That's
15      such an unfair characterization of Fannie's
16      disability.  Such an unfair characterization.
17      We saw the zest for life Fannie has.  We saw
18      that.  She's not going to give up despite her
19      disability.
20           We encourage people with disabilities to
21      fight, not to give into it.  What Fannie is
22      doing, walking like she did, riding her bike,
23      that should be commended, not disrespected.  She
24      doesn't want to live in a rocking chair.  She's
25      going to enjoy her life as best as she can, but she's fighting with every breath.  You saw that.
2           On the verdict form you're going to be
3      asked, what's the total damages of the medical
4      bills, and you heard Fannie say that she
5      incurred in excess of $200,000.  We're going to
6      ask you to award her that $200,000 as
7      reimbursement for the medical bills she's
8      incurred.  What's the total amount of damages?
9      How do you put a value on somebody's life?  How
10      do you put a value on what she's going through
11      and will continually go through in the future?
12      How do you put a value on a lung?  They took her
13      lung out.  She's not cured.  They took her lung
14      out.  How do you put a value on that, on the
15      pain and suffering she's endured and is going to
16      continue to endure until her last breath?  How
17      do you put a value on that?
18           I would suggest $15 million as a fair and
19      reasonable amount of money to compensate her for
20      the loss of a lung, for COPD and the future
21      she's going to be facing for the next hopefully
22      nine years according to the life tables.  It may
23      be shorter.  It may be longer.  Another nine
24      years of sucking on oxygen from a tube, and it's
25      only going to get worse.  It's only going to get worse.  They don't care.  They don't care.
2           We're not here only asking you to
3      compensate Fannie for her pain and suffering,
4      which will get worse.  We're also here to ask
5      you to consider punishing these tobacco
6      companies.
7           Punitive damages.  The judge read to you
8      the instruction.  Look at the things they did.
9      They can't even talk about what they did.  They
10      won't address it.  You stand at a unique moment
11      in history.  You have the power and authority to
12      do something today in this courtroom.  You have
13      to see it clearly.  We have to prove to you by
14      clear and convincing evidence that these acts
15      these tobacco companies committed over the years
16      should be punished.  I think we certainly have
17      done that with the evidence.
18           You have to remember, this is an industry
19      that is a master of illusion.  They've done it
20      for decades.  This is their judgment day.  It's
21      their day of reckoning.  It's time to make an
22      accounting for the past misdeeds.
23           You've got to ask yourself, should they
24      escape punishment?  Of course not.
25           Today I'm calling on you to make an expression of moral condemnation for the
2      insidious --
3           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I object --
4           THE COURT:  Sustained.
5           MR. GERAGHTY:  -- and move to strike and I
6      have a motion.
7           THE COURT:  It will be stricken.
8           MR. HAMMER:  What they did was
9      reprehensible.  It doesn't meet with the bounds
10      of human decency.
11           MR. GERAGHTY:  Same objection.
12           MR. HAMMER:  It's about corruption.
13           MR. GERAGHTY:  Same motion, Your Honor.
14           THE COURT:  Overruled.  Reserved on the
15      motion.
16           MR. HAMMER:  It's not corruption. It's not
17      greed.  It's not morality.
18           MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection, Your Honor.
19           THE COURT:  Sustained.
20           MR. GERAGHTY:  Motion.
21           MR. HAMMER:  These companies, they have a
22      survival instinct.  The health of their profits
23      is the only thing important to them.  They don't
24      care about the customer.  They don't care about
25      Fannie Collar.  They're addicted to their products.  They enjoy making money.  It gives
2      them pleasure and satisfaction.  Their conduct
3      needs to be examined.
4           These companies, they took over -- Reynolds
5      took over, took over Lorillard recently.  And
6      Philip Morris, when they took over Liggett's
7      brand of Chesterfield, what do you hear?
8      Remember Chesterfield?  Liggett's attorney stood
9      up here and said, well, we put a label, nicotine
10      is addictive on our cigarettes.  What did you
11      hear?  Philip Morris bought that pack -- those
12      cigarettes up.  The first thing it did was took
13      the label off.  It took the label off.
14           You must decide as to each defendant the
15      punitive damages warranted to punish them and as
16      a deterrent to others, so that other
17      corporations don't do the things that these
18      tobacco companies did for 50 years.  So that
19      others don't do what they did.  That's the only
20      way things can be right.
21           The tobacco epidemic was initiated and has
22      been sustained by the aggressive strategies of
23      the tobacco industry, which has deliberately
24      misled the public on the risks of smoking, and
25      they should be punished for it. Twenty million people have died.  They talk
2      about 60 million people have quit.
3      Twenty million people have died.
4           Numbers, can you conceptualize 20 million
5      people dead?  The population in this country has
6      been decimated by this tobacco industry.
7           This epidemic, it's been driven by greed
8      and corruption.  Let's think about it for a
9      second.  20 million people dead.  There's about
10      20 million people in the state of Florida.
11           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I object.  This
12      argument is under Williams and State Farm.
13           THE COURT:  Sustained.
14           MR. HAMMER:  You know what, 500,000 people
15      are dying each year today.  Do they care?  Not a
16      bit.
17           Do you know why?  Because it's all about
18      money.
19           Truth and consequences.  It's about truth
20      and consequences.  When you engineer your
21      product to cause addiction, there should be
22      consequences.  When you target children, there
23      should be consequences.
24           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I object.
25           MR. HAMMER:  When you lie to the American public, there should be consequences.  When you
2      offer up false solutions --
3           THE COURT:  Sustained.
4           MR. HAMMER:  -- there should be
5      consequences.  When you offer up filters that
6      don't work, there should be consequences.  When
7      you commit fraud, there should be consequences.
8      When you hurt one person, there should be
9      consequences.  When you kill millions, there
10      must be consequences.
11           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would move to
12      strike the last comment.
13           THE COURT:  Sustained.
14           MR. HAMMER:  A manufacturer has to tell the
15      truth about its product.  They have to.  That's
16      the responsible way to do things.  That's the
17      responsible way to do business in this country.
18      If you don't, you need to be punished.  It's as
19      simple as that.
20           Protect.  Don't addict.  Protect.  Don't
21      addict them.
22           They talk about the base of their business
23      is the 14- to 24-year age group.  They talk
24      about inducing a pre-smoker or a non-smoker to
25      become habituated, deliberately playing down the role of nicotine.  They referred to younger
2      adults as replacement smokers.  As young as 12
3      years old.  Twelve years old as replacement
4      smokers.  That's their target.
5           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object
6      and move to strike that comment.
7           THE COURT:  Sustained.
8           MR. HAMMER:  Fannie Collar, she was one of
9      those replacement smokers at 12 years old.
10           Because we know the younger a person is
11      when they start to smoke, the more likely they
12      are to continue to smoke as adults.  The tobacco
13      companies knew that.  They knew that.
14      Internally they knew that.
15           They dehumanized the customer.  They called
16      them crops.  Crops.
17           This is the jury instruction.  The Frank
18      Statement.  All you need to do is look at the
19      Frank Statement.  Let's take a look close at it.
20      Remember the Frank Statement?  This was in 1954.
21      Let's look at it basically line by line.  We
22      accept an interest as a basic responsibility
23      paramount.
24           Their own documents.  Who ain't for more
25      money?  We always have, and we'll always cooperate closely with those whose task it is to
2      safeguard the public.  But the campaign of
3      smearing and belittling them, trying to smear
4      the scientists who are doing the real research.
5           One by one these charges have been
6      abandoned for lack of evidence, they tell the
7      public, and yet inside they say overwhelming
8      evidence to indict cigarette smoking.  They knew
9      it inside, and they're telling the public, oh,
10      no, it's not true.
11           The TIRC, they set up a scientist with
12      unimpeachable integrity and national repute, and
13      yet in their own documents they say it was set
14      up as a shield and a front.  And let's face it,
15      we are interested in evidence which denies the
16      allegation that cigarette smoking causes
17      disease.  Is that being truthful?
18           THE COURT:  Five minutes.
19           MR. HAMMER:  They said if our product is
20      harmful, we'll stop making it.  What did Fannie
21      tell you?  In the late '50s, as I recall the
22      tobacco companies were or the industry was
23      telling people if we switch -- if we had any
24      doubts about cigarettes being harmful to our
25      health, we should switch to filters and there would be no problem.  And if they ever found out
2      they cause cancer or other disease, they would
3      stop making cigarettes.  She relied on that, as
4      did millions of others.
5           They buried the research.  They buried it.
6      Remember this graph?  This was shown.  It talks
7      about the rise in cigarettes.  Rise in
8      cigarettes, and the rise in cancer.  This is how
9      they put together that link.
10           Remember?  1954, that was a pivotal moment
11      in tobacco history.  That's when they linked up
12      arms and decided on this campaign of doubt and
13      lies and deceit.  Just imagine, just imagine if
14      they'd told the truth.  Fannie Collar was 19
15      years old.  Imagine if they'd told the truth.
16      If they'd really meant what they said, if it's
17      harmful, we'll stop making it.  Or if they took
18      out the Frank Statement and said -- told the
19      truth.  Imagine what would have happened?
20      Fannie Collar wouldn't have gotten sick.  Lung
21      cancer would have been extinguished over the
22      years.  We wouldn't be here in this courtroom.
23      That's why they should be punished.
24           Punitive damages.  I would ask you to check
25      off yes, yes, and yes to each of these companies.  They need to be punished.  They need
2      to be punished.  I ask you to check those boxes
3      off, and we'll come back for another day,
4      present evidence real quick to you, and then you
5      decide how much.
6           These companies need to be punished.
7           Not only for Fannie's sake but for
8      everybody else out there.


20 21           MR. HAMMER:  The defense just said to you
22      Fannie just quit in '93.  She quit in '93 after
23      being hospitalized, having her lung removed,
24      going on oxygen, and then going through
25      radiation for eight weeks, and she just decided to quit.  That was a decision?  No.
2           She just had surgery to remove her lung.
3      She was just told she had COPD, and she was
4      placed on oxygen for a period of time to
5      recuperate.  She went through rehab, and then
6      she went through radiation.  Yeah, I guess
7      that's her decision.  She was properly motivated
8      by that kind of surgery.  That's what they want
9      you to believe.  Yes, she was.  That's some
10      pretty darn good motivation.
11           Guess what, she didn't choose to smoke all
12      those years.  It was her addiction that drove
13      her smoking.  That's what you've got to
14      understand.  That's what they want you to just
15      poo poo away, no big deal.
16           They want to talk about all the times that
17      she tried to quit before that and say, well,
18      Dr. Suen said if she was properly motivated.
19      Remember, Dr. Suen became her doctor in 1993.
20      He wasn't seeing her all those years beforehand
21      when she was having difficulty quitting.
22           They talk about Dr. Suen.  Let's put up
23      Dr. Suen.  Can you play Dr. Suen's testimony?
24      Because really everything you need to know about
25      Fannie Collar and her condition Dr. Suen told you.
2 (Thereupon, the video clip was played and transcribed as
3 follows:)
4      Q    Can you identify any other place in the
5 chart for me where you documented an opinion or your
6 observation on your part that Ms. Collar had COPD,
7 mild or otherwise, prior to January 14th, 2005?
8      A    I know that, you know, the -- at the time
9 of her surgery, you know, the lung that was removed
10 was analyzed, and that there were changes of
11 emphysema, pulmonary emphysema in the lung specimen.
12 So even, you know -- even back in the '90s we knew
13 there was -- she did have COPD.
14           She may -- I've counseled her multiple
15 times to quit smoking, and there were periods of
16 months at a time where she wouldn't smoke, but she
17 did go back to smoking again.  Yes, I just don't
18 remember for how long she was smoking free at the
19 time, but she always relapsed back into smoking
20 during those years.
21           With her, you know, I know that she has
22 struggled with trying to quit smoking.  So I did talk
23 to her about pharmacological aids, in this case
24 Chantix on this visit, and I've also prescribed
25 Wellbutrin on other occasions. Q    Do you see anything in this -- either of
2 these exhibits that documents any withdrawal symptoms
3 that she claims to have been suffering from at that
4 time?
5      A    I didn't document that, but I do have a
6 recollection that she did tell me about withdrawal
7 symptoms.
8      Q    What specifically did she say in that
9 regard?
10      A    My recollection is that she had -- felt
11 like she had a craving for smoking.  I remember her
12 using the term feeling jittery or filling more
13 anxious, you know, during that -- when she gets those
14 feelings of wanting to smoke.
15 (Thereupon, the video ended.)
16           MR. HAMMER:  So he told you she was
17      relapsing.  He told you she was craving.  He
18      told you she had COPD.  Not what they've just
19      told you.  She had all those signs of an
20      addiction.  All of the signs of an addiction.
21      And he prescribed Wellbutrin and Chantix.  But
22      she could have quit any time she wanted, that's
23      what they want you to believe.  This woman was
24      addicted.
25           They say she went back to smoking because of meeting up with Ben.  You know what was
2      missing on Mr. Geraghty's timeline that he
3      painstakingly blew up for you and went through?
4      No mention of Gail on that timeline, her
5      daughter who was diagnosed with a deadly disease
6      and then died 18 months later, which spun Fannie
7      right back into that addiction.  He conveniently
8      left that off his timeline, didn't he?
9           You know, all throughout this case they
10      made a big issue about Fannie's mom slapping
11      her.  Remember that?  It was a big issue in
12      opening statement and all throughout the trial.
13           Dr. Ticknor, what did he tell you?  Well, I
14      didn't really make note of that.  That was
15      really not a significant time in her life.  The
16      reason is because -- Fannie's mother slapped her
17      because she said it wasn't ladylike.  No other
18      reason.  She didn't want her to smoke.  Her dad
19      said, just don't let Mom find out.  Smoke with
20      me.  So that's another mixed message she's
21      getting not from the tobacco companies, from her
22      own family.
23           She continued to get those mixed messages.
24      They talk about the fact that she said, I only
25      heard it one time.  Well, let's take a look at the slide of -- I think it's 144, Dan.
2      Testimony from Fannie Collar, do you have that?
3           In the late '50s, as I recall, the tobacco
4      industry was -- or the industry was telling us
5      that if we switched -- if we had any doubts
6      about cigarettes being harmful to our health, if
7      we switched to filters, there would be no
8      problem.  And if they ever found out that they
9      ever caused cancer or any disease, they would
10      stop making cigarettes, and they're still making
11      cigarettes today.
12           Then she told you in that same line of
13      questioning, slide number 145, please.  This is
14      Mr. Geraghty asking her questions.  You told us
15      yesterday very clearly that the first time you
16      ever heard of that was in 1966.
17           She answers, I think we had a
18      misunderstanding.  I thought you were talking
19      about the warning on the pack, which is 1966.
20      1966 was the first time I saw the warning.  My
21      father-in-law showed it to me.  He was smoking
22      Camels at the time.  I was already smoking
23      filters so I felt I was safe.
24           Mr. Geraghty, So you made a mistake
25      yesterday and you want to change your testimony? No, I don't think it was a mistake.  I
2      misunderstood what you were saying.
3           That's what she told Mr. Geraghty.
4           This whole thing about how she smoked
5      Marlboro first and then switched because --
6      never smoked Winston and started smoking
7      Marlboros when she met Merton, no.  Let's look
8      at her testimony, slide number 138.
9           I bought Winston while Mert was smoking
10      Camels.
11           That was her testimony in court to the
12      defense counsel.
13           Then that was a pattern you had throughout
14      your life?
15           No, I wouldn't say it was a pattern.  I
16      bought Winstons while Mert was still smoking
17      Camels.
18           Then on slide 139, please.  No, I started
19      on Winstons.
20           This is, again, defense counsel
21      questioning.
22           Then ultimately switched to Marlboros?
23           Yes, when Mert switched to Marlboros.
24           Let's talk about what we're here about.
25      Fannie Collar is absolutely addicted.  She deserves to be a member of the Engle class.  The
2      issue is, was anything they said or did
3      important to Fannie Collar?
4           Certainly in 1954, instead of saying, we
5      take an interest and basic responsibility in our
6      customer's health over all other things in our
7      business, instead if they I would have said,
8      quit smoking in 1954 because the scientists are
9      right, smoking causes lung cancer, we would not
10      be here.  If they lived up to their promises of,
11      if it's proven that it's unsafe, we'll stop
12      making the product, we would not be here.
13           If they didn't lie about filters and the
14      fact that it takes out the bad stuff, we would
15      not be here.  If they didn't lie about the
16      addictiveness of the product and the fact that
17      it causes cancer, we would not be here.  It's as
18      simple as that.
19           We would not be here because Fannie
20      wouldn't have lung cancer or COPD.  Those lies
21      are what caused her to get those diseases.
22      Yeah, obviously her smoking caused her to get
23      those diseases, but her addiction caused her to
24      smoke all those cigarettes.  She became addicted
25      because of their lies, because of their lies, as did millions of other people.
2           So were their lies important and relevant?
3      Yeah.  Would that information that they
4      concealed have been substantial for folks to
5      hear, for Fannie to hear?  Of course.  What if
6      they had kept their promise to stop making them?
7      Lives would be different.
8           MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection, Your Honor.
9           THE COURT:  Overruled.
10           MR. HAMMER:  Sadly, all too often in the
11      choice between the physical health of consumers
12      and the financial well-being of business,
13      concealment was chosen over sales over safety
14      and money over morality.  These tobacco
15      companies who knowingly and secretly decided to
16      put the public at risk solely for the purpose of
17      making products and believed that illness and
18      death of consumers was an appropriate cost to
19      their own prosperity, that's wrong.
20           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object.
21           THE COURT:  Sustained.
22           MR. GERAGHTY:  Motion.
23           MR. HAMMER:  Their conduct needs to be
24      continued to be examined.  This is not old news.
25      This goes back to the 1950s and continues. We're just starting to understand the scope of
2      how deep these --
3           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, that's not in
4      evidence.
5           THE COURT:  Sustained.
6           MR. HAMMER:  Some of our country's best
7      scholars, including Dr. Proctor and the students
8      he's teaching out at Stanford, are still
9      studying these documents and finding more and
10      more.  He told you that.
11           It's important for us to understand what
12      happened because those who forget history are
13      doomed to repeat it.  We all know that.  That's
14      a lesson we've learned.  If you forget about
15      history, society is doomed to repeat it.  We
16      can't let that happen here.
17           That's why punitive damages are so
18      warranted, because when we talk about deterrents
19      to others in punitive damages, we're talking
20      about letting other corporations know that this
21      behavior is not acceptable.  That's what it's
22      all about.
23           The jury instruction on agreement to
24      conceal, real quick, slide number 78.  It says,
25      Each party to an agreement to conceal or omit material information is responsible for the acts
2      or omissions of any other party to the agreement
3      to conceal or omit information so long as the
4      acts or omissions were in furtherance of the
5      agreement to conceal.
6           Accordingly, the Defendants are responsible
7      for their own acts and for the acts of the other
8      tobacco companies and organizations, meaning the
9      CTR, the TI and the TIRC, taken in furtherance
10      of the agreement.
11           That's why all of these companies should be
12      held responsible.  They all agreed to conceal
13      this information from the public.  They all
14      agreed to conceal this information from Fannie
15      Collar.  Yet, can Fannie Collar point to a
16      company and say, oh, this one told me this on
17      this day, this one told me that on this day.
18      No.
19           They shaped how America felt about
20      cigarettes.  They formed the country.  They
21      formed the country's opinion about cigarettes.
22      They formed Fannie's opinion about cigarettes.
23      She didn't know.
24           Wait, they want to say she knew.  She knew
25      it was harmful.  She had to know.  Her uncle -- I mean, her father-in-law told her.  Her own
2      father told her.  The person she worked for told
3      her.  She had to know.
4           Well, why didn't they know?  Why didn't
5      they know?  How did they go on TV and say, we
6      don't know, it's not proven.  How did they do
7      that year after year, decade after decade, how
8      did they do that and get away with it?  They've
9      gotten away with it.
10           But today in this courtroom you can say no
11      more.  That's the power you have.  They have
12      shown you their callused and cynical attitude.
13      What these companies did was cold.  It was
14      calculated.  It was premeditated.  They knew
15      exactly what they were doing, and they were
16      doing it all for money.
17           Let's take a look at the punitive damages
18      instruction, also, slide number 85.  To ask you
19      to punish these companies for their conduct,
20      that's what we're asking you to do because that
21      kind of behavior should not be tolerated by
22      people like you, by juries like you.
23           One of the things you can consider in
24      assessing reprehensibility or wrongfulness is
25      the harm suffered by Fannie, as well as the rest of the American public, that's what this
2      instruction tells you.
3           Conduct causing loss to Fannie was so gross
4      to show disregard of human life or the safety of
5      persons exposed to the elements.  Total
6      disregard for the safety of people.  Total
7      disregard that they were harming people
8      throughout the decades.  Total disregard.
9           They want to talk about the warnings.
10      Let's take a look at PT 3870.  They want to talk
11      about the warnings, they see how effective and
12      impactive the warnings can be.  Let's take a
13      look.
14           This is the FTC report to Congress in 1967,
15      just after the first caution label went on
16      cigarettes.  Let's take a look at what the
17      Federal Trade Commission said, please.
18           Effectiveness of cigarette labeling.  There
19      is virtually no evidence that the warning
20      statement on cigarette packages has had any
21      significant effect.  That's the FTC, a
22      government agency talking about the warnings
23      that they say, Fannie should have known.
24      They're effective.  That's enough.  That's all
25      we needed to do.  Come one, folks.  The FTC report says warning labels are not effective.
2           Fannie told you when she was shown the
3      label by her father-in-law, what did she tell?
4      She told you, I saw it but I was already smoking
5      filters.  He was smoking Camels.  She told you
6      that.  I felt I was safe.  Why did she feel she
7      was safe?  Because of what the tobacco companies
8      were telling her.  That's why.
9           Let's look at how the industry reacted to
10      their warnings.  They said, when scientists said
11      smoking causes disease -- their own warnings to
12      the tobacco companies, when scientists said
13      tobacco smoke, cigarettes cause disease, what
14      did they do they?  They ignored those warnings
15      and they kept lying and manipulating.
16           When smokers started to get sick and die
17      and the lung cancer rates went up, they ignored
18      those warnings and they kept lying and
19      manipulating.
20           When the Surgeon General said smoking
21      causes lung cancer and other diseases, they
22      ignored those warnings and they kept lying and
23      manipulating.
24           When the government said that there was an
25      epidemic, an epidemic caused by cigarettes, they ignored those warnings and they kept lying and
2      manipulating.
3           Why?  Because they're greedy and they're
4      profit minded.  That's what it's all about.
5      Dr. Proctor told you, slide number 120, they're
6      extremely profitable.  There's no more
7      profitable industry.
8           Slide number 121, there's a certain sort of
9      invisibility that the industry has.  That's very
10      important for their whole strategy.  Essentially
11      making themselves invisible and all attention on
12      the smoker and the cigarette.  No attention on
13      themselves.  You know what, in this courtroom
14      you heard --
[#DELETED OBJECTION DIALOGUE#]
9           MR. HAMMER:  Thank you, Judge.  Dan, Slide
10      Number 122, please.
11           Dr. Proctor told you that for roughly every
12      million cigarettes smoked in our society there's
13      one death.  He told you they make millions of
14      cigarettes a day.  They have machines that make
15      10 million cigarettes a day.  They've got tons
16      of those machines.  Despite those millions of
17      deaths, do they care?  No.  They keep making
18      millions of cigarettes from machines that make
19      millions of a day, which result in millions of
20      dollars to these companies and to these
21      defendants.  They don't care.  They don't care.
22           And Dr. Suen told you she always relapses
23      back.  Is that control?  No.  Did she have
24      control as she opened up that vacuum cleaner and
25      dug out a cigarette butt?  Is that control over her smoking?  Of course not.  That's addiction.
2           They said, well, she was a chipper, because
3      you know, after her surgery she only smoked
4      occasionally and then started smoking with Ben.
5      Well, what did Dr. Mannino tell you about that?
6           Slide Number 141.
7           He was asked:  Doctor, you don't agree,
8      based upon the medical records that we have
9      reviewed, the pattern we just saw was that of a
10      chipper?
11           He said:  No.  This is a person who is
12      addicted, who is trying to quit.
13           Fannie Collar wasn't a chipper.  She was
14      addicted.
15           You know, Dr. Ticknor, he talked about this
16      60 million people that have quit.  Remember that
17      discussion Mr. Gdanski had with him?  Let's take
18      a look at that.
19           Slide Number 126.
20           The stat you talked about, you actually
21      don't know the basis of it, the formulation of
22      it, the makeup of it, the demographic of it.
23           I don't.
24           You just came prepared to give one number?
25           Yeah, it's the number I'm familiar with. This is the expert they brought in.  He has
2      no idea how they came up with that number.
3      That's just the number they gave him.  Say
4      60 million quit.  That's good enough.
5           Then he tells you addiction does not cause
6      disease.  I've never seen a case where addiction
7      causes disease.  How convenient.  We have to
8      prove that addiction caused Fannie Collar's
9      disease.  They bring in a witness to you that
10      tells you addiction doesn't cause disease.
11           Let's take a look at PT 1913.
12           This is a document from December 1982.  And
13      in this document what do they say about expert
14      witnesses?
15           Our medical scientific witnesses will say
16      whatever we want them to say, clearly implying,
17      if not stating, that they lack credibility and
18      integrity.  Their own documents.  Basically they
19      say our expert will say whatever we want them to
20      say.
21           You know, in 1953, Slide Number 128, they
22      linked arms and walked together at the Plaza
23      Hotel.  They recognized that this is the way the
24      world ends.  Not in a bang, but a whimper.  It's
25      something almost too terrible for most of the industry's men to realize, even though the very
2      heads of the great corporations themselves
3      signalized the end of the old days, when they
4      linked arms and walked together because that was
5      unprecedented.  As it was pointed out many
6      times, they were competitors, but when they saw
7      their business threatened, they linked arms,
8      they joined forces and decided to lie for the
9      next 50 and 60 years to the American public and
10      people like Fannie Collar.  Why?
11           Ann Browder, Number 129, please.
12           She went on TV many different times.  You
13      saw her -- I forget what year we showed first.
14           Can we show that, Dan.
15 (Thereupon, the video clip was played and transcribed as
16 follows:)
17           SPEAKER:  We know cigarette smoking is bad
18      for our health.  Why does the Tobacco Institute
19      continue to promote smoking?
20           SPEAKER:  Well, the Tobacco Institute does
21      not promote smoking.  It promotes the right of
22      an individual to make a decision to smoke and
23      then supports that individual in making that
24      decision.
25           And I have to disagree with you in that we don't know what causes the ailments that have
2      been attributed to cigarette smoking.  Certainly
3      I am not denying the fact that cigarette smoking
4      could be a risk factor involved with some people
5      and some of the problems that they might have,
6      but I don't think that there is a causal
7      relationship established between cigarette
8      smoking and any disease.  If there were, Diane,
9      I don't think there would be a cause without the
10      effect or the effect without the cause, and we
11      all know that happens.
12 (Thereupon, the videotaped testimony of the witness was
13 concluded.)
14           MR. HAMMER:  1983, speaking on behalf of
15      all of the tobacco companies, Philip Morris,
16      R.J. Reynolds, Liggett.  Still, we don't know as
17      late as 1983.
18           Let's take a look at PT 2412.
19           This is a document that's in evidence.
20      Let's go to that page I asked you to turn to.
21      Why do they do it?  Why do they do it?  They say
22      let us provide the exquisiteness and hope that
23      they, our consumers, continue to remain
24      unsatisfied.  All we would want then is a larger
25      bag to carry the money to the bank. That's what this is all about.  That's what
2      drives it.  That's their life blood.  That's
3      their oxygen.  They need it.  They want it.
4      That's all they care about at the risk of
5      killing millions of people.
6           You know, the truth is Fannie will die a
7      slow and miserable death.  Sad to think about
8      it, and I hate saying it in front of her.  She's
9      going to end up gasping for air.  And despite
10      her best efforts, she's going to suffocate.
11      That's what happens to people with COPD.  That's
12      what's going to happen to her.
13           They want to say it's all because she
14      wasn't motivated to quit.  What was their
15      motivation to lie?  We know the answer.  Bigger
16      bags of money to take to the bank.
17           They knew it.  Their motivation, PT 1525.
18           Unless some lawyer be looking over our
19      shoulder, I do not conceive that even one person
20      dies of a chronic disease that is caused by
21      smoking cigarettes.  Their own documents.
22           Their lying didn't stop.  It continued
23      throughout the years.  It continued all the way
24      through the years leading up to Fannie lung
25      diagnosis.  And it went to the highest levels of government.  We saw this once before, and I want
2      to show it to you again, in 1994.
3 (Thereupon, the video clip was played and transcribed as
4 follows:)
5           I'd like you to rise and those who will be
6      testifying as well, will you to rise.
7           Do you swear that the testimony you're
8      about to give is the truth the whole truth and
9      nothing but the truth?
10           Please consider yourself to be under oath.
11           Let me give my question on the matter of
12      whether or not nicotine was addictive.  Let me
13      ask you first, I'd like to go down the row,
14      whether each of you believes that nicotine is
15      not addictive?  I heard virtually all of you
16      touch on it.  Yes or no, do you believe nicotine
17      is not addictive?
18           I believe nicotine is not addictive, yes.
19           Mr. Johnson.
20           Congressman, cigarettes and nicotine
21      clearly do not meet the classic definition of
22      addiction --
23           We'll take that as a no.  Again, time is
24      short.  I think each of you believe nicotine is
25      not addictive.  We just would like to have this for the record.
2           I don't believe the nicotine from our
3      products are addictive.
4           I believe nicotine is not addictive.
5           I believe that nicotine is not addictive.
6           I believe that nicotine is not addictive.
7           And I too believe that nicotine is not
8      addictive.
9           Mr. Campbell, you were also deposed and you
10      said, quote, to my knowledge, it has not been
11      proven that cigarette smoking causes cancer.
12      This is a rather passive and puzzling approach,
13      especially in light of the consensus.
14           Not by some, but all of the scientific
15      community will you ever be convinced, and what
16      evidence are you waiting for?  Let's have the
17      microphone passed over.
18           Yes, I may be convinced.  We don't know
19      what causes cancer in general right now.  So I
20      think that we may find out what causes cancer
21      and we may find out some relationship, which has
22      yet to be proven.

24           MR. HAMMER:  A year after Fannie Collar is
25      opened up like a can opener to remove her lung, they're still going to Congress, going to
2      Congress, raising their hand and lying.  That is
3      as reprehensible as it gets.
4           THE COURT:  You have like 3 minutes.
5           MR. HAMMER:  Thank you, Judge.
6           For nearly 20 years this industry has
7      employed a single strategy to defend itself on
8      three major fronts:  Litigation, politics and
9      public opinion.  While the strategy was
10      brilliant, conceived, and executed over the
11      years, helping us to win important battles, it
12      is only fair to say that it is not, nor was it
13      intended to be, a vehicle for victory.  On the
14      contrary, that has always been a holding
15      strategy consisting of creating doubt about the
16      health effects without actually denying it.
17           They talk about Fannie saw one statement.
18           Let's put up her testimony at 142, please,
19      Dan.
20           That's not what Fannie said.  She told you
21      when you use the tobacco industry term, the
22      combination of all of the tobacco companies.  I
23      think when Mr. Belasic got up here and he said
24      to you that was only one statement, remember?
25      Was it only one statement that you heard over the years or many, many statements over the
2      years?  There was more than one.  More than one
3      statement.  Yes.  There was more than one
4      statement.  She told you that.
5           I ask you, don't erase Fannie's name from
6      the history of this atrocity that these tobacco
7      companies created.  Posterity should remember
8      things.  You can make that happen today with
9      your verdict.  Inscribe her name in the law
10      books of Florida, maintaining her name in the
11      proud Engle class to which she belongs.  The
12      Engle class has done so much to bring --
13           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I object and
14      make a motion.
15           THE COURT:  Sustained.
16           You have about 1 minute.
17           MR. HAMMER:  This litigation has brought
18      tobacco companies --
19           MR. GERAGHTY:  I object, Your Honor --
20           THE COURT:  Sustained.
21           MR. GERAGHTY:  -- and make a motion.
22           MR. HAMMER:  History has brought the
23      tobacco companies' deception and lies to light
24      for you all to see.  Fannie deserves to be
25      remembered.  She deserves to be remembered.  She deserves to be a member of the Engle class.  She
2      doesn't want to be.  She wishes she didn't have
3      to be.  But these companies, their lies, their
4      deceit, that's what caused it.  Because if they
5      would have been truthful over the years, things
6      would have been different.
7           Six people can change history.
8           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object
9      and make a motion, Your Honor.
10           THE COURT:  Sustained.
11           And you're out of time.
12           MR. HAMMER:  We ask you to return a verdict
13      for Fannie Collar, check off the box for
14      punitive damages, and we'll come back one more
15      day to talk about how these companies should be
16      punished.  I want to thank you for your service
17      and your attention.  This case is now in your
18      hands.  Thank you, on behalf of Fannie.
