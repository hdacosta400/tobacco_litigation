1 evidence.  
2           We know from the evidence in the case 
3 that more than 400,000 people a year die of 
4 smoking-related illnesses.
5           MR. DAVIS:  Objection, Your Honor.  
6           THE COURT:  Overruled.  
7           MR. JOHNSTONE:  We know that.  That's 
8 the evidence in the case.  
9           But Mary Cooper beat those cancers and 
10 is here as a living, breathing human being, a 
11 woman with a heart and a mind and a family who is 
12 loved and who loves other people.  
13           And she's here to hold the tobacco 
14 companies responsible to some degree for what they 
15 did in marketing and selling and advertising the 
16 cigarettes that she bought at 15, 16 years old and 
17 that she started smoking when she was 11, 12 years 
18 old.  
19           Now the first two questions, despite all 
20 these instructions that are somewhat complicated, 
21 they're the longest instructions I've ever seen.  
22 I've been practicing for a number of years, quite 
23 a number of years.  
24           This is the jury verdict form here in 
25 Broward County with His Honor Judge Tuter who we 5260
1 have been lucky to have as a judge to marshal 
2 everybody and keep the case moving and organize us 
3 and get everybody to show up on time and he's done 
4 more than that.  
5           He's worked behind the scenes for 
6 months, as all the lawyers have, to present the 
7 case to you folks, and we're grateful to him and 
8 grateful to you.  
9           You are one of -- you six, seven folks 
10 were among 300 people that were chosen.  There's a 
11 lot of reasons why you were chosen as jurors.  The 
12 main reason is because it was decided by 
13 everybody, including the Court, that you were the 
14 best qualified, the least biased, the most 
15 open-minded, the most fair people of the 300 that 
16 we spoke to, and we thank you all, and Mary Cooper 
17 thanks you.  
18           So despite 18 pages or whatever it is of 
19 instructions, these are the key issues that gets 
20 us into the rest of the case, because as it must 
21 become clear to you folks, if you find that Mary 
22 was not addicted to cigarettes after all the 
23 evidence, after all that you've heard and seen, if 
24 you find that she was not addicted to cigarettes, 
25 which caused her laryngeal cancer, then the 5261
1 tobacco companies win this case.  
2           If you find that Mary Cooper's laryngeal 
3 cancer wasn't present in her, she didn't have 
4 symptoms, it didn't manifest before November 21st, 
5 1996, then they've succeeded in throwing her case 
6 out of court.
7           MR. DAVIS:  Objection, Your Honor.  
8 Misstatement of law.  
9           MR. JOHNSTONE:  That's what they're 
10 doing.  
11           MR. DAVIS:  Improper argument.  
12           THE COURT:  Okay.  Overruled.  
13           MR. JOHNSTONE:  That's exactly what 
14 happens if you listen to the two experts that they 
15 called, Dr. Agharkar on addiction, and Dr. Fee, 
16 the ENT.  
17           Now what I'd like to do, since it was 
18 the last question that I asked, I'd like to remind 
19 you folks about Dr. Fee, the fellow who was paid 
20 something like $100,000 to come in and testify.  
21           And I want to make this clear, and it's 
22 clear in my mind because it was the last question 
23 that I asked him when I had a chance to get up.  
24           Dr. Fee was asked a series of questions 
25 about why it was that he was out on a limb by 5262
1 himself.  
2           How is it that he came to the conclusion 
3 that Mary didn't have laryngeal cancer in '96 or 
4 '97, but all of the other physicians, all of the 
5 other treaters did?  
6           And he said they didn't have all the 
7 records.  
8           That's not true.  And I don't use the 
9 word "liar" very often, but what he said was flat 
10 wrong and untrue.  
11           And so I went back to make sure last 
12 night.  We worked very late to get the evidence to 
13 you.  
14           Their ENT expert said that doctors 
15 Shapiro, and Kronberg, Weed, Mudad, did not have 
16 the records and couldn't possibly have sat and 
17 gone through them to reach the conclusions that 
18 they did.  
19           That was a lie.  Dr. Mudad, Dr. Shapiro, 
20 Dr. Weed, Dr. Sundararaman, every one of them 
21 received all of the records that are in evidence 
22 and all of the records that the attorneys have 
23 been talking about for three weeks.  
24           That's the same fellow that said that 
25 none of the physicians who testified under oath 5263
1 that you've seen, Dr. Shapiro live, and all the 
2 other physicians by videotape, none of those 
3 physicians were qualified to give opinions on 
4 whether this was recurrent cancer that had been 
5 sitting in her throat since '96.  
6           That's simply not true.  So let's look 
7 at the evidence, and let's see what the tobacco 
8 companies have been doing as far as fact and fancy 
9 going back 50 years, because it occurred to me 
10 last night that what you heard in this 
11 courtroom -- I'll pull this down, zoom it down a 
12 little bit.  
13           What you heard in this courtroom for the 
14 last three weeks from the tobacco companies is 
15 essentially what they've been doing for more than 
16 50 years.
17           MR. DAVIS:  Objection, Your Honor.  
18 Defense of the case.  
19           MR. JOHNSTONE:  I'm going to show you 
20 what they've done.  
21           THE COURT:  Overruled.  
22           MR. JOHNSTONE:  Fact versus fancy.  
23 Dr. Fee is the individual that came in here and 
24 said there's a mystery malignancy in her head or 
25 neck.  He can't say what the origin was, and he 5264
1 didn't know what happened to it.  
2           It disappeared magically with Mary's 
3 immune system.  That's what he said.  That's the 
4 expert.  That's the quality of the testimony that 
5 was presented to you folks.  
6           And going way back to 1954, after Mary 
7 had already been born, one of the tobacco 
8 executives, George Weissman, is telling a big 
9 trade association facts versus fancy, and that's 
10 exactly what you heard from Dr. Bennett, fanciful, 
11 untrue, absurd opinions about laryngeal cancer 
12 that manifested for the first time in 2001.  
13           He's the only person that has ever said 
14 that in the life of this case, the only person.  
15           And this is what the tobacco company is 
16 telling all of these folks at the meeting:  
17 Believe me -- this is what George Weissman says:  
18 Believe me.  
19           I know this is your position as well as 
20 ours, if any one of us believed that the product 
21 we were making and selling was in any way harmful 
22 to our customer's health, and our own as well, we 
23 would voluntarily go out of business.  
24           And that's what they were telling people 
25 who were watching television and watching the 5265
1 shows and the debates.  
2           And this is going back to the '50s, is 
3 the story that they put out, and it's simply not 
4 true.  
5           Now I want to put up these questions, if 
6 I can, again because they're -- based on the 
7 evidence in the case, I think and we believe we've 
8 proved not just by the greater weight of the 
9 evidence but by clear and convincing evidence that 
10 Mary was addicted to cigarettes containing 
11 nicotine and that it caused her laryngeal cancer 
12 and that it manifested before, this laryngeal 
13 cancer manifested before November of '96.  
14           Dr. Craig Shapiro was the physician who 
15 did the biopsies and admitted that, in retrospect, 
16 he did not go widely or deeply enough and that 
17 these biopsies were superficial, but that she had 
18 the cancer in '96.  
19           And I'm going to show you the testimony 
20 of all the other treating physicians from Miami, 
21 Dr. Mudad here in Broward County, the other men in 
22 Miami, and show you what they testified to.  
23           Importantly, Craig Shapiro testified in 
24 open court, after being cross-examined by the 
25 attorneys for the defense:  It's my opinion that 5266
1 Mary was addicted.  She was told numerous times 
2 after the initial procedure to stop.  She 
3 continued to smoke.  She tried to stop.  She 
4 couldn't stop.  
5           We know that she used Nicoderm patches 
6 and Nicorette Gum and tried cold turkey repeatedly 
7 but she couldn't stop smoking and he was asked if 
8 Mary wasn't addicted and didn't keep smoking 
9 cigarettes for 30 years, Dr. Shapiro's trial 
10 testimony:  More likely than not would she have 
11 developed the laryngeal cancer that we've been 
12 talking about this morning?  
13           He says:  No, it's likely she would 
14 never have developed the cancer.  
15           Mary has talked for 600 pages in depo 
16 and for a full day on the witness stand about her 
17 addiction.  
18           She didn't appreciate when she was 12, 
19 13, 14, 15, 16, that she was addicted or was going 
20 to become addicted.  
21           She had no idea about all the 
22 carcinogens and poisons and all of the additives 
23 that the tobacco companies have put in their 
24 cigarettes since she was a little girl.  
25           She had no idea.  She was a young, 5267
1 immature girl whose parents smoked, father smoked, 
2 whose brother had access to cigarettes.  
3           And for you younger people on the panel, 
4 there's a few of you younger people, you wouldn't 
5 have known before this case the environment that 
6 she grew up in.  
7           The United States was very, very 
8 different in those days, and Scott Schlesinger is 
9 going to tell you about it, but Mary was allowed 
10 to smoke at school as a 16 year old.  
11           Her teachers permitted her to do that.  
12 She smoked in movies.  Everybody smoked in cars 
13 and trains and buses, and you've heard that.  It's 
14 a totally different world now.  
15           And the tobacco companies helped create 
16 that national environment through their 
17 advertising and their sales and their 
18 glamourization of cigarettes, young girls, young 
19 teenage boys, like Mary, through the advertising 
20 saw athletes and movie stars and famous people and 
21 people that everyone respected, teachers, doctors, 
22 judges smoking at the courthouse, in medical 
23 offices.  
24           That's the environment that the tobacco 
25 companies helped create, and so when we talk about 5268
1 addiction, remember that this woman who is now 
2 almost 63 next month became addicted as a 
3 teenager.  
4           That's when she was the most vulnerable, 
5 when her brain and her judgment and her ability to 
6 make important decisions were that of a young 
7 girl, teenager.  
8           It's not as though this is a woman who 
9 began smoking ten years ago and has cancer, now 
10 that we know so much more about it, and 
11 advertising is limited and the tobacco companies 
12 are regulated.  The world was very different then.  
13           So what I'd like to do is I'd like to 
14 play evidence and fortunately we have video clips 
15 which give us a chance to show you what the 
16 evidence is.  
17           I have found in the past that many 
18 jurors say:  What was the evidence?  Can we see 
19 the transcripts?  What did the doctors actually 
20 say?  
21           So I want to play them, doctors 
22 Kronberg, Weed, Mudad, short clips to remind you 
23 of the treating physicians who did the charting at 
24 the time regarding whether Mary had laryngeal 
25 cancer that was recurrent, that had been there 5269
1 since '96.  Folks that actually saw and treated 
2 her, not paid experts that have come in from 
3 California.  All right.  So let's take a look.  
4           (Video clip played.)
5           VOICE:  Dr. Kronberg, can you give me a 
6 range of when you thought -- of -- of within which 
7 you think Ms. Cooper's cancer began before 1997?  
8           THE COURT:  Pause it.  
9           (Videotape paused.)
10           THE COURT:  All right.  Why don't we let 
11 our juror regroup and we'll come back in a couple 
12 minutes?  Ma'am, do you need some Kleenex because 
13 we've got more?  
14           JUROR SHORTER:  It's sinus.  
15           THE COURT:  We'll let you regroup back 
16 there.  Ring the buzzer when you're all set again.  
17           (Jury exited courtroom at 9:41 a.m.)
18           MR. JOHNSTONE:  I saw her reach for her 
19 Kleenex to blow her nose.  
20           THE COURT:  She was -- more than 
21 anything else, she was distracted.  
22           This is on Mr. Schlesinger's time, by 
23 the way.
24           MR. JOHNSTONE:  Say it again, Judge.  I 
25 didn't hear you. 5270
1           THE COURT:  I said this is on 
2 Mr. Schlesinger's time.  Keep that in mind.  
3           MR. JOHNSTONE:  I am.  I am.  
4           (A recess was taken from 9:42 a.m. to 
5 9:46 a.m.)
6           THE COURT:  Okay.  The jury is buzzing.  
7 Is everybody back?  
8           Bring the jury in.  
9           (Jury entered courtroom at 9:47 a.m.)
10           THE BAILIFF:  Jury coming in.  
11           THE COURT:  Do we have a seat there for 
12 Ms. Cooper, Scott?  
13           MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, Robert is going to 
14 get one.  They need you to get up so Mary can 
15 sit.  
16           MR. PHILIPSON:  That's fine.  
17           THE COURT:  All right.  Folks, welcome 
18 back.  Everybody can be seated.  
19           Ma'am, there is a lot of things in the 
20 building here, so you're not the first to have 
21 sinus problems that's sat with us.  So don't worry 
22 about that.  
23           If you do need to stop, do not be 
24 embarrassed, just raise your hand, and we'll be 
25 happy to take breaks as necessary.  We want to 5271
1 make sure you're able to stay with us and focus 
2 and not let that distract you.  
3           So we are going to get everybody seated 
4 here and we are going to regroup.  I apologize, 
5 Mr. Johnstone, you may start.
6           MR. JOHNSTONE:  Thanks, Judge, I 
7 appreciate it.  I'm sorry, I probably should have 
8 noticed, but if anyone has a problem, let us know.  
9           So what we were going to do is spend 
10 just a couple minutes actually looking at the 
11 trial testimony of the actual physicians who cared 
12 for Mary, and let's do that with Dr. Kronberg, 
13 just short clips, Dr. Weed, Dr. Mudad.  Let's do 
14 that, please.
15           (Video clip played as follows:)
16           VOICE:  Dr. Kronberg, can you give me a 
17 range of when you thought -- of -- of within which 
18 you think Ms. Cooper's cancer began before 1997?  
19           VOICE:  My feeling is that the cancer 
20 was there when he did the excision of the neck 
21 mass.  Okay.  So it was there before that.  
22           VOICE:  Why did her laryngeal cancer 
23 manifest prior to November 1st, 1996?  
24           Go ahead, sir.
25           VOICE:  Based on the size of the 5272
1 metastatic disease that was present, and the fact 
2 that she had had the fullness in that area, the 
3 fact that she had the hoarseness prior to that, 
4 although she had the vocal cord polyps, and based 
5 upon my clinical judgment and the years of 
6 practicing.  
7           (Videotape paused.)
8           MR. JOHNSTONE:  Now let me pause for a 
9 minute.  I want to see if you folks remember this.  
10           When their ENT expert, Dr. Fee 
11 testified, he admitted, it took a while to pull it 
12 out of him, but he did admit three weeks into the 
13 trial what you hadn't heard from the attorneys 
14 representing the tobacco companies, you hadn't 
15 heard this from them, but what he did admit is, in 
16 fact, if he was wrong, if it was laryngeal cancer, 
17 as we've said all along, as all the physicians 
18 said, then it manifested prior to November of '96.  
19 He admitted that on the stand.  
20           He also said if it was some other 
21 mystery disease that her autoimmune system took 
22 care of when all the other cancers had to be 
23 treated, they didn't go away, even if it was 
24 another head cancer, base of the tongue, 
25 tonsillar, whatever, that whatever was there that 5273
1 he says he doesn't know what it is, but he's 
2 surmising, that manifested, that was symptomatic 
3 prior to November of '96.  He said that as well.  
4           So that issue, I think, is a dead 
5 letter.  We flogged that horse, the overwhelming 
6 evidence from everybody is, as we've said.  
7           So let's go to the next tape or the next 
8 clip, please.  I think this is Dr. Weed.  
9           (Video clip played as follows:)
10           VOICE:  All right.  So in 2001, when 
11 Mary Cooper came to your office for the initial 
12 visit, what was it that led you to conclude that 
13 she had was there for a reoccurrence of the cancer 
14 she had in the late '90s?  
15           VOICE:  In 1997, she presented with a 
16 squamous cell carcinoma involving a lymph node in 
17 the neck.  That, by far and away, is most likely 
18 to have come from a cancer of the throat.  
19           The doctors at the time searched for 
20 where the cancer was coming from and could not 
21 find it.  
22           By convention, based on the natural 
23 history of squamous cell carcinoma, we consider 
24 patients cured after five years of -- five years 
25 after completion of treatment. 5274
1           Any time in that five years, if they 
2 have cancers develop, it's a recurrence, unless 
3 it's a completely different site.  
4           When I say "completely different site," 
5 I'm referring to the primary site.
6           MR. JOHNSTONE:  Can you pause?  
7           VOICE:  So the lymph node where her 
8 cancer was originally diagnosed --
9           (Videotape paused.)
10           MR. JOHNSTONE:  Very briefly, we know 
11 from the records that Mary was actually 
12 symptomatic a full year before her physician, 
13 Dr. Gutania spent her to Dr. Goldberg, the ENT.  
14 She became -- that cancer had been sitting there 
15 all along, but it had actually broken through the 
16 mucosa a full year before she was diagnosed.  
17           This cancer recurred within a three-year 
18 time frame, and the records show that she was 
19 complaining of pain and tightness in her throat 
20 and hoarseness and difficulty swallowing.  
21           She just had trouble getting a referral 
22 and she's not critical of anybody.  No one in this 
23 case has ever said that any of the physicians 
24 involved did anything wrong.  They saved her life.  
25           Mary is super grateful to every one of 5275
1 the physicians who helped save her life.  She has 
2 overcome amazing odds, she really has, lung 
3 cancers, both lungs, neck cancer, laryngeal 
4 cancer, and she's still here, and her PET scan, 
5 her PET scan taken recently is completely normal.  
6           So God's will, good luck, you name it, 
7 she's here and she's going to be here for many 
8 years to come.  
9           Let's pick up with Dr. Weed.
10           (Video clip played as follows:)
11           VOICE:  -- is a regional site that is a 
12 metastatic site.  This is the first primary site 
13 that she's ever had.  That is the one that was 
14 diagnosed in 2001.  
15           VOICE:  All right.  
16           VOICE:  But it's in that four-year time 
17 frame and is the presumed primary site of her 
18 cancer.  
19           VOICE:  Okay.  And when you and 
20 Dr. Kronberg and other physicians treated her in 
21 2001, did you conclude then that the cancer you 
22 were treating in the larynx was a reoccurrence of 
23 the cancer from 1997, seen metastatic in the neck?  
24           VOICE:  Yes, that was my conclusion.  
25           VOICE:  And is that still your 5276
1 conclusion today?  
2           VOICE:  That is still my conclusion.  
3           VOICE:  And in your opinion what was the 
4 cause of Mary Cooper's cancer?  
5           VOICE:  Her smoking.  
6           (Videotape paused.)
7           MR. JOHNSTONE:  Pause.  Everybody agrees 
8 it took a while, we had to pull it out on 
9 cross-examination, you didn't hear this in 
10 opening, you didn't hear it until I finally got 
11 Dr. Bennett, Dr. Fee to admit what.  
12           The number one reason that Mary had 
13 laryngeal cancer was her smoking, her nicotine, 
14 tobacco addiction, the abuse, pack and a half a 
15 day for 30 years.  Everybody said that.  
16           So it's not clear to me -- it's not 
17 clear to me why the defendants would get up and 
18 cross-examine witnesses about skin or scalp 
19 cancer.  
20           Why would they do that?  No one ever 
21 said she had skin or scalp cancer.  It was a 
22 billing clerk that wrote that on one piece of 
23 paper out of 10,000.  
24           Why would you cross-examine Dr. Shapiro 
25 on that?  Because the defendants are refusing to 5277
1 accept the truth in the case, the actual facts and 
2 the truth.  
3           We get a stiff arm.  We get questions 
4 about skin cancer and HPV.
5           MR. DAVIS:  Objection, Your Honor.  
6 Disparaging the defense in the case.  
7           THE COURT:  Overruled.  
8           MR. JOHNSTONE:  The defendants made a 
9 big issue of HPV, and in the opening statements, 
10 one of the attorneys, Mr. Belasic or one of the 
11 others, started talking about risk factors in 
12 Mary.  
13           HPV, a sexually transmitted disease?  
14 She's been with the same fellow for 30 years.  She 
15 hasn't seen either one of her husbands in almost 
16 35 years, and what witnesses did they call to say 
17 HPV exists in this patient as a risk factor.  
18           Every single doctor says smoking was the 
19 cause of her laryngeal cancer, every single one.  
20           Bennett, Fee, everybody.    
21           All right.  That's the truth in the 
22 case.  There is no skin cancer.  There is no HPV, 
23 and these other risk factors that they talk about, 
24 why are they talking about that?  
25           She worked spinning cotton to turn it 5278
1 into thread as a teenager in the '70s.  That 
2 caused her laryngeal cancer?  No.  No, it didn't.  
3           Can you pick up?  
4           (Video clip played as follows:)
5           VOICE:  Okay.  And my question to you 
6 is:  In October, let's say October 24, 1996, did 
7 Mary Cooper have symptoms and manifestation of 
8 what we now know was primary laryngeal cancer?  
9           VOICE:  Four months prior, she had 
10 symptoms of what was known to be cancer in the 
11 left neck, yes.  
12           VOICE:  Okay.  And the cancer that we 
13 see here in the left neck, was that cancer -- as 
14 described in February 24th, 1997, was that cancer 
15 already developing a palpable neck mass at least 
16 as early as October 24th, 1996?  
17           VOICE:  Correct.  
18           VOICE:  In October of 1996, did Mary 
19 Cooper have primary laryngeal cancer which spread 
20 to her left neck and was already symptomatic in a 
21 metastatic site?  
22           VOICE:  Based on subsequent events, I 
23 think yes.  
24           VOICE:  Was it the same cell type found 
25 and seen later on in 2001? 5279
1           VOICE:  Yes, it was.  
2           VOICE:  Is there any evidence that 
3 you've seen in the case to suggest that these were 
4 two different cancers, what happened in 1996, '97, 
5 is different than what took place in 2001?  
6           VOICE:  There's no evidence to suggest 
7 that.  
8           VOICE:  Okay.  And it also describes a 
9 history of chronic hoarseness?  
10           VOICE:  That's correct.  
11           VOICE:  Okay.  Do you think that 
12 Ms. Cooper's hoarseness was related, to some 
13 degree, to her cancer and the spread of that 
14 disease?  
15           VOICE:  To some degree, yes.  
16           VOICE:  Well, is a couple of beers a 
17 week a substantial risk factor for the development 
18 of laryngeal cancer?  
19           VOICE:  It's actually not.  Laryngeal 
20 cancer is not typically associated with alcohol 
21 use.  
22           VOICE:  Oh, it's not.  So I'll ask you 
23 this way:  Is alcohol use a risk factor, in your 
24 opinion, that's typically associated with squamous 
25 cell carcinoma of the larynx like she had? 5280
1           VOICE:  It is much less associated with 
2 the laryngeal subsite than tobacco.  
3           VOICE:  And is it your opinion, sitting 
4 here today, is it your scientific conclusion after 
5 reviewing records going back many, many years that 
6 Mary Cooper's primary laryngeal carcinoma started 
7 in, at the latest, October of 1996?  
8           VOICE:  Yes.  
9           VOICE:  Did Mary Cooper have symptoms of 
10 primary laryngeal carcinoma in October of 1996?  
11           VOICE:  Yes.  
12           (Video clip concluded.)
13           MR. JOHNSTONE:  Now if alcohol is a 
14 minor risk factor, why in the world would the 
15 defendants spend the better part of their 
16 presentation talking about alcohol.  
17           Mary is not an alcoholic.  Mary never 
18 abused alcohol.  Anyone who said that she did is 
19 lying.  There's no evidence that she ever did.  
20 Drinking wine with dinner, having a couple of 
21 beers.  
22           She's never been treated for HPV or 
23 alcohol related diseases of any kind.  So what did 
24 the defense do?  Misdirection.  Look over here.  
25 Don't pay attention to actually the facts in the 5281
1 case.  
2           Her cigarette smoking caused the 
3 laryngeal cancer and she's addicted to the 
4 nicotine that she smoked for 35 years.  Don't pay 
5 attention to that.  
6           Let's talk about alcohol by talking to 
7 an ex-husband she hasn't seen in 40 years?  And 
8 somebody said she smoked 100 marijuana cigarettes 
9 a month or a week or whatever it was.  It's 
10 insane.  
11           She never saw marijuana, used it or 
12 touched it in North Carolina.  Anyone who says 
13 otherwise is making it up.  
14           Let's look at the next testimony.  This 
15 is the final clip I'm going to show you of her 
16 treating physicians who did all the charting 
17 contemporaneously with their treatment at the 
18 time, long before this case.  Dr. Mudad.
19           (Video clip played as follows:)
20           VOICE:  Do you have an opinion, whether 
21 in this case more likely than not, probably more 
22 likely than not, Mary's cigarette smoking caused 
23 her laryngeal cancer?  
24           VOICE:  I think it's more likely than 
25 not that her cancer was related directly to 5282
1 smoking.  
2           VOICE:  What's the relationship between 
3 nicotine addiction causing long-term smoking and 
4 the development of laryngeal cancer?  Have you 
5 seen that before?  
6           VOICE:  Well, I've seen nicotine 
7 addiction causing patients to continue to smoke 
8 and then exposure to the carcinogens and the smoke 
9 leading to the development of smoking-related 
10 cancers.  
11           VOICE:  Dr. Mudad, do you have an 
12 opinion in this case within reasonable medical 
13 probability more likely than not whether Mary 
14 Cooper was addicted to the nicotine in the 
15 cigarettes that she smoked for 30 years or more?  
16           VOICE:  Yes, I do believe that she was 
17 addicted to smoking.  
18           MR. JOHNSTONE:  At least we can read it.  
19 Yes, I do believe -- 
20           (Video clip paused.)
21           MR. JOHNSTONE:  You can just let it play 
22 because we can read it.  
23           (Video clip resumed.)
24           VOICE:  Why do you have that opinion?  
25 What do you base that on? 5283
1           VOICE:  Based on the majority of people 
2 who pick up the habit of smoking become addicted 
3 to smoking.  
4           VOICE:  And, in your experience, when do 
5 such patients normally become addicted?  When do 
6 they start smoking regularly?  
7           VOICE:  Typically the most common is in 
8 teenage years to late teenage years.  
9           VOICE:  Well, what does it tell you 
10 about the degree of addiction or the magnitude of 
11 Mary Cooper's addiction.  
12           What does it tell you about the 
13 addiction that she continued to smoke cigarettes 
14 even after being diagnosed with a lymphadenopathy, 
15 a tumor in the lymph node in her left neck.  
16           What does that tell you?  
17           VOICE:  It tells me that the addiction 
18 is very strong and is very difficult to get 
19 over.  
20           VOICE:  You've told us that you think 
21 that that cancer originated, manifested in Mary 
22 prior to November of '96?  You told us that?  
23           VOICE:  Yes.  
24           VOICE:  You've told us that you think 
25 that the cancer that spread to her neck that 5284
1 Dr. Shapiro cut out came from that laryngeal area?  
2           VOICE:  Yes.  
3           VOICE:  Do you think the cancer that 
4 ended up in her lungs, the metastatic cancer that 
5 she was treated for, came from that same laryngeal 
6 area?  
7           VOICE:  Yes.  
8           VOICE:  So expressed differently, are 90 
9 percent of the -- are 90 percent of the patients 
10 that you diagnose with head and neck cancer 
11 long-term smokers?  
12           VOICE:  Yes.  
13           (Video clip concluded.)
14           MR. JOHNSTONE:  One of the instructions 
15 that you guys got that you may not remember but 
16 you'll have a chance to see because the judge is 
17 going to give you the instructions that he read to 
18 you, is that you may consider in judging the 
19 credibility of expert witnesses what motive, what 
20 knowledge, what experience, what background they 
21 have in giving the opinions that they express.  
22           And I'm going to represent to you that 
23 every single one of the physicians involved in 
24 these issues, addiction and legal cause, the legal 
25 cause of Mary's laryngeal cancer are not hired, 5285
1 paid experts.  
2           They were under subpoena, and, in fact, 
3 Dr. Mudad told us he didn't want to get involved.  
4 You heard him say that when we played the entire 
5 video.  
6           He had to be subpoenaed because he was 
7 told that:  Look, what we're going to do is ask 
8 you questions.  We need you to tell the truth.  
9 And he didn't want to get involved, he had his own 
10 lawyer there.  
11           He didn't want to sit in a room with 12 
12 or 15 lawyers.  I don't blame him.  But he swore 
13 to tell the truth, and everyone of these men did, 
14 everyone of these treaters.  And those are the 
15 facts.  That's the truth.  
16           Let me move on.  As late as 1980 -- 
17           MR. TELOFSKI:  Thirty minutes.
18           MR. JOHNSTONE:  Yes, sir.  
19           -- as late as 1980, and we can see the 
20 date at the top, this is an internal memo that we 
21 all know was finally obtained from inside these 
22 tobacco companies offices that had been conspiring 
23 for 50 years to lie to the public and to mislead 
24 teenagers, young adults who were their replacement 
25 smokers. 5286
1           If you have 400,000 people dying a year, 
2 you've got to get new smokers to keep up your 
3 profits and make your shareholders happy, which is 
4 exactly what these tobacco companies have done 
5 since they began.  
6           And here's what they say to one another 
7 inside, never dreaming that the truth would come 
8 out, never dreaming that they'd be held 
9 accountable for their dishonesty, their lying, and 
10 their conspiracy to push nicotine and dangerous 
11 tobacco products on the public.  
12           Here's what they said:  I'm told that 
13 the entire matter of addiction is the most potent 
14 weapon a prosecuting attorney can have in a lung 
15 cancer/cigarette case.  We cannot defend continued 
16 smoking as "free choice" if the person was 
17 "addicted".  
18           And yet that's exactly what you're going 
19 to hear in closing arguments.  I'm going to tell 
20 you now that you can expect to hear from the 
21 attorneys who stand to speak for these tobacco 
22 companies that this whole case is Mary's fault.  
23           All of her cancers, all of her 
24 surgeries, all of the misery, all of the anorexia 
25 and hair loss and weight loss and the inability to 5287
1 even breathe normally, she doesn't breathe through 
2 her mouth or nose, she breathes through the hole 
3 in her throat that she covers with the scarf, that 
4 she cleans four or five times a day, as she did in 
5 this trial in the ladies' room.  That's her fault 
6 only.  
7           She's 100 percent responsible for 
8 starting to smoke and becoming addicted as a 
9 teenaged girl, and we know that's a lie.  We 
10 cannot defend continued smoking as "free choice" 
11 if the person was "addicted".
12           MR. DAVIS:  Objection, Your Honor.  
13 Suggesting that the defense of the case is a 
14 continuing fraud is unconstitutional.  
15           THE COURT:  Objection is overruled.  
16           MR. JOHNSTONE:  Okay.  Now they've 
17 gotten away in this case with Mary Cooper for 17 
18 years.  They've gotten away with saying it's Mary 
19 Cooper's fault.  It's free choice.  She's an 
20 adult.  She can make a decision to smoke.  
21           Well, not today and not tomorrow.  It's 
22 time to hold them accountable and using your best 
23 judgment, your collective wisdom, determine what 
24 the respective responsibility is.  
25           You don't market -- you don't market, 5288
1 you don't target, you don't advertise to young 
2 women like this who start smoking full time at 15, 
3 16 years old, and then claim when she's lying in a 
4 hospital bed with her throat cut out that you're 
5 not responsible at all in the least, not one 
6 percent.  
7           That's wrong.  That's not the truth.  
8           MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, I'm sorry to 
9 interrupt.  These are continuing violations of 
10 pretrial rulings on failure to take 
11 responsibility.  
12           THE COURT:  Objection overruled.  
13           MR. JOHNSTONE:  All right.  It's wrong.  
14           Seventeen years, thirteen years without 
15 a voice book.  It took her six months to use that 
16 electrolarynx to be able to speak to people.  
17           When she goes out in public, they stare 
18 at her.  Yes, she made a mistake as a girl.  Yes, 
19 she did, and she accepts responsibility.  She 
20 stood up and said that, and she has the guts to 
21 come into this courtroom and tell the truth and 
22 hold these people responsible.  
23           The first page:  Did she rely to her 
24 detriment on any statement of material fact, 
25 et cetera?  The answer is yes.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1           And all you have to do is look at the 
2 hundreds of pages of records that Dr. Cummings and 
3 Hardee Bass went over together, Marlboro Lights, 
4 the spirit of Marlboro is a low-tar cigarette, and 
5 if you blow it up, and there are lots of other 
6 examples, I don't have time:  Lighter in taste, 
7 lower in tar, and still offers up the same quality 
8 that has made Marlboro famous.  
9           This is what they were telling 
10 everybody, and she smoked filters because she 
11 thought they were safer.  You can see all the gunk 
12 and she was led to believe that if you smoked 
13 filters instead of nonfilters the tar and nicotine 
14 would be collected in the filter.  
15           And if she smoked lights, they were 
16 healthier for her.  They were less dangerous.  She 
17 was wrong.  She feels stupid.  She feels used.  
18 She feels ashamed.  Okay.  Yeah, she does.  
19           And she told you that, and she didn't 
20 say one thing that wasn't true.  They go to 
21 impeach her on the witness stand.  She said -- 
22 they asked her:  When did you start smoking 
23 regularly, start buying cigarettes?  She said:  
24 13, 14, 15.  
25           And they impeach her saying:  Oh, you 5290
1 said 16.  Who cares?  She was a kid.  That's what 
2 they do in cases like this.  
3           MR. BELASIC:  Objection, Your Honor.  
4           THE COURT:  Sustained.  Sustained.  The 
5 objection is overruled.  Stick to the facts of 
6 evidence in this case, Mr. Johnstone.  
7           Ladies and gentlemen, disregard the 
8 remarks of the counsel.  The case is between 
9 Ms. Cooper and these defendants and no one else.
10           MR. DAVIS:  I think you meant the 
11 objection is sustained.  
12           THE COURT:  The objection is 
13 sustained.  
14           MR. JOHNSTONE:  All I'm talking about is 
15 Mary Cooper.  That's all I'm talking about.  When 
16 they impeached her using her own deposition, they 
17 made a big deal of the fact that she said 14 or 15 
18 when she started smoking regularly.  
19           I'm upset if I said something else, I'm 
20 talking about Mary Cooper.  I don't know what 
21 they're talking about.  Mary Cooper.  And then 
22 they impeach her with a transcript saying she's 16 
23 when she started smoking regularly and buying 
24 cigarettes at a store.  
25           Okay.  That's their defense.  Did any 5291
1 statement or omission referred to -- et cetera, 
2 and I'll not going to spend any more time on this 
3 because these issues on the jury verdict form, 
4 Questions 4, 5, and 6, are going to be address by 
5 Scott Schlesinger.  Now I need to move on because 
6 our time is limited.  
7           Please state the percentage of fault 
8 that was a legal cause of Mary Cooper's laryngeal 
9 cancer.  And I suggest to you, and you use your 
10 collective wisdom in holding the parties 
11 proportionately responsible for wrongdoing.  
12           That RJ Reynolds is 40 percent 
13 responsible, Philip Morris is 30 percent 
14 responsible, Lorillard is 15 percent responsible, 
15 Liggett Group is 10 percent, and Mary herself is 5 
16 percent, and that's based on the years of smoking.  
17           It's based on the brands that she smoked 
18 for the numbers of years and the collective damage 
19 that it did to her larynx, her lungs, et cetera.  
20           In your wisdom, if you decide 
21 differently, we respect that.  In fact, we respect 
22 if the verdict is based on the truth and the 
23 evidence, we respect everything that you announce 
24 as the facts in the case, the judges of the facts, 
25 you determine. 5292
1           We called, by videotape, Susan McKenzie, 
2 and we presented evidence from Mr. Padron, the 
3 CPA, about what Mary's damages have been, the hard 
4 economic damages.  
5           There was no evidence from the defense 
6 at all.  They cross-examined on a few issues, but 
7 basically sat down.  They didn't call anyone to 
8 address this, and I've done the arithmetic.  I did 
9 the last night until 2 in the morning.  
10           We finished so late yesterday, that's 
11 how -- I went back:  What's the total amount of 
12 Mary Cooper's damages for medical expenses 
13 incurred in the past and to be incurred, and I did 
14 until the age of 75.  
15           We asked them to two models and I wrote 
16 it on the board and I've chosen to help you as a 
17 guide what future medical care reduced to present 
18 money value will be when you add it to the past 
19 medical expenses.  
20           The past meds in this case were like a 
21 million four and Mary testified to that.  The 
22 bills are in evidence.  If somebody wants to check 
23 the math, please do.  The future meds and the past 
24 meds are a million nine.  
25           What is the total amount of Mary 5293
1 Cooper's damages for lost earnings in the past and 
2 loss of earnings capacity in the future?  
3           Mary was a single mom, raising her 
4 daughter.  She still lives with her daughter and 
5 her grandkids.  The evidence is that she worked 
6 her tail off, 50, 60, 70 hours, 80 hours a week, 
7 and she did that from the time that she came down 
8 to Florida in the late '70s, until she finally had 
9 to quit working in 2004, when she was diagnosed 
10 with lung cancer.  
11           Mary is going to be 63, I think, it's 63 
12 next -- in two weeks, three weeks.  Mary wasn't 
13 going to retire.  She needed the money.  She 
14 needed the security and she wasn't able to work 
15 and she hasn't since 2004.  
16           And when you do the arithmetic as 
17 Mr. Padron did -- it's I don't think disputed.  
18 There is no evidence otherwise -- the past lost 
19 wages and the inability to work until the age of 
20 66, when she gets full Social Security benefits, 
21 that number is $420,000.  That's the arithmetic.  
22           Those are hard numbers, and they're not 
23 in dispute as far as I'm aware.  
24           This is the difficult question.  This is 
25 on the verdict form, and it's a question that you 5294
1 folks have to determine based upon all the 
2 evidence in the case, what you've heard, what you 
3 heard from Mary and other witnesses, physicians 
4 included, as to what she's been through and how 
5 this series of cancers and cancer treatments 
6 affected her life.  
7           What is the total amount of damages 
8 sustained by Mary Cooper for pain and suffering, 
9 disability, physical impairment, disfigurement, 
10 mental anguish, inconvenience, aggravation of a 
11 disease or physical defect -- this is legalese, as 
12 usual.  
13           It's lawyer -- legalese judge talk, for 
14 how her cancer has helped wreck her life.  
15           And I'm not going to stand here and go 
16 through all of the indignities and all of the 
17 worry and all of the depression and all of the 
18 upset that she's been through because you have 
19 heard it.  You can understand what she's been 
20 through the last 17 years.  
21           You're going to hear that people can 
22 quit smoking.  Yeah, Mary quit smoking.  She did.  
23 She quit smoking after having her last cigarette 
24 in the parking lot of the University of Miami 
25 before Dr. Weed spent eight hours cutting out the 5295
1 cancer and reconstructing her neck to cover up the 
2 veins and the arteries that were exposed.  
3           She quit smoking.  She quit smoking 
4 because she couldn't smoke anymore.  She doesn't 
5 breathe through her mouth or her nose, and she lay 
6 in a hospital bed on morphine in the ICU and in 
7 the hospital regular floor for a week.  
8           And when she got up and looked at 
9 herself for the first time, she almost fainted.  
10 She was absolutely shocked, and her whole life got 
11 flipped upside-down by choices that she made as a 
12 15- and 16 year old.  Yeah.  
13           And also by the lying and the conspiracy 
14 and the marketing and the misdirection that came 
15 from the tobacco companies for 50 years.  
16           The CEOs, these respected CEOs of every 
17 one of these tobacco companies appeared in front 
18 of Congress as late as 1994, and swore under oath 
19 things like:  Nicotine isn't addictive, and:  We 
20 don't know whether cigarette smoking causes 
21 cancer.  
22           It's outrageous.  They were lying 
23 through their teeth and they were saying that to 
24 people like Mary who were addicted and creating 
25 confusion and misdirection and putting out 5296
1 information that was a huge lie.  
2           And it's the biggest conspiracy that's 
3 ever been foisted on the American public since our 
4 founding almost 300 years ago.  
5           And I'm asking you today, tomorrow as 
6 you deliberate, to hold these companies 
7 responsible to Mary Cooper for what they've done 
8 to her, their respective responsibility.  
9           What is the number I'm suggesting?  This 
10 is what I'm suggesting.  I'm suggesting $10 
11 million for the 17 years since her diagnosis with 
12 neck cancer, and $10 million for the next 15 or 20 
13 years that she's going to live with her daughter 
14 and her granddaughters like this.  
15           And if you will take the time to look at 
16 the photographs and to look at the video that's in 
17 evidence of her day in the life, you'll see what 
18 her day is like every single day.  
19           And she's been robbed of the ability to 
20 so much as blow out a birthday candle or to speak 
21 normally to her grandkids and read stories to 
22 them.  
23           And she's stared at and she draws from 
24 kids in particular weird quizzical stares 
25 everywhere she goes if she tries to use her 5297
1 electrolarynx.    
2           You decide what's fair.  You do what the 
3 evidence supports in the way of compensating Mary 
4 for all that she's been through these 17 years.  
5           And I'm asking you not to turn your back 
6 on her and let these tobacco companies, with the 
7 witnesses, the quality of the witnesses that they 
8 brought into this courtroom, Dr. Agharkar doesn't 
9 know as a doctor whether smoking causes laryngeal 
10 cancer.  He admits that many of the tests that she 
11 underwent, many of the tests used to evaluate 
12 addiction means that she is, in fact, addicted.  
13           But then comes in as the only guy ever 
14 in this case to say she's not addicted, and it was 
15 embarrassing.  
16           And I'm going to finish with this:  They 
17 brought an expert in, these tobacco companies.  
18 They can call whomever they choose.  They don't 
19 have to call anybody as witnesses.  They don't 
20 have to, but they chose certain people to call.  
21           Mr. Gdanski says to Dr. Agharkar:  
22 Dr. Agharkar, let's say that a person comes into 
23 your office with a hole in her throat and she's 
24 trying to smoke through the hole and she's had 
25 peripheral vascular disease and lung cancer and 5298
1 she comes in and she can't breathe through her 
2 mouth and nose, she's been smoking two packs a day 
3 for 30 years, and she says to you:  Do you think 
4 I'm addicted?  
5           What did he say?  
6           I don't know.  I can't say that.  I need 
7 more information.  
8           That's outrageous.  That's the quality 
9 of the physician that they brought in to testify 
10 in a case of this magnitude that's been pending 
11 all these years.  
12           Hold them responsible.  Please do the 
13 right thing, and please give Mr. Schlesinger a 
14 little -- a bit more of your time before we break 
15 for lunch.  Thank you.


3                CLOSING STATEMENT
4           MR. SCHLESINGER:  May it please the 
5 Court?  
6           Counsel, ladies and gentlemen, good 
7 morning.  Hello again. 
8           We spoke at opening, and, as you recall, 
9 I go fast, and that's what we're going to be 
10 doing, fast.  So get ready. 
11           You're not going to get it all, but 
12 you'll get the idea.  So this is my inspirational 
13 opening.  This is Thomas Jefferson. 
14           He said:  Trial by jury, the best of all 
15 safeguards for the person and the property of 
16 every individual. 
17           I remember a great quote from the movie 
18 "Amistad" when Anthony Hopkins was talking to the 
19 Supreme Court, and he said, when he was calling on 
20 the spirits of the past presidents and figures in 
21 American history, and he said:  Who we were is who 
22 we are.  
23           And that's why in this courtroom today 
24 we're going to talk about large-scale American 
25 principles, morality and decency, and we're going 5311
1 to start out with one of the laws that the judge 
2 himself read to you about a corporation.  
3           These lawyers may be fine gentlemen.  
4 They may be nice guys.  You might like them, but 
5 they are not RJR.  They are not Philip Morris.  
6 They are not Liggett, and they are not Lorillard.  
7 Okay?  
8           You will see that the corporate rule 
9 that His Honor read to you is, they get treated to 
10 be like people.  
11           And I say:  That's fine.  We accept 
12 that.  We embrace that, because if you want the 
13 rights of a person, you also must act in 
14 accordance with the responsibilities of a person, 
15 and to the extent they have human attributes, they 
16 must act with decency to other people.  
17           And a campaign to know that something 
18 causes death and to choose at a crossroads in 
19 time, as I pointed out to you in the openings, in 
20 The Frank Statement, to embark upon a campaign of 
21 deception, to trade lives for profits and say:  We 
22 will maintain our business at the expense of 
23 lives, which now, as Dr. Cummings has said, has 
24 tolled in the millions. 
25           Even since the 1964 Surgeon General 5312
1 report came out, 20 million lost souls, 
2 preventably -- preventably dead because of the 
3 scourge of tobacco.  
4           Now that epidemic was unnecessary.  That 
5 epidemic was driven by one thing and one thing 
6 only, profit and greed.  
7           And when you lose your moral compass and 
8 you put profit above all else, the truth matters, 
9 and we're going to be here to talk about the 
10 consequences of that truth.  
11           The truth matters.  That's what this is.  
12 When I ask you -- because you will see a maze of 
13 questions on this verdict form. 
14           But it's the last question on the 
15 verdict form that is the true reason we are here 
16 and the true opportunity where you can exercise 
17 something that you, as a jury, have that nobody 
18 else has, a power to right a wrong, a power that 
19 may be greater than any power you'll ever hold 
20 again in your life, the power to speak to 
21 corporations who act indecently. 
22           If you want to be treated as a person, 
23 you know what, act like a person, with decency.  
24           And I call on you today, if you see this 
25 our way, as I try to stitch this together, the big 5313
1 picture -- because there's a lot of laws and 
2 instructions and verdict form questions, and you 
3 can work through them if you see the big picture.  
4           A great historical wrong that calls out 
5 for an expression of moral condemnation.
6           MR. DAVIS:  Objection to the "historical 
7 wrong" as improper argument.  
8           THE COURT:  Objection is overruled.  
9           MR. SCHLESINGER:  If you see it our way 
10 and you work your way through that, you will be 
11 able to speak to these companies and this 
12 industry, and you will say, in the strongest 
13 possible terms:  We want you to change.  
14           They make a lethal product.  It is 
15 defective and unreasonably dangerous by law in 
16 rules that you will see, that you embrace for 
17 yourselves, as if you found them.  The Engle 
18 findings are yours. 
19           This is an Engle progeny case.  You are 
20 the Engle progeny jury, that is, the children of 
21 Engle, a 20-year battle for a group of people, a 
22 class of which, using their logic, would be the 
23 null class. 
24           It would be an empty classroom.  It 
25 would be the College of Tobacco Knowledge, a big, 5314
1 giant empty classroom if you listen to the way 
2 tobacco argues what constitutes class membership. 
3           For Mary, class membership is a simple 
4 threshold determination, and I'll show you why, 
5 but she is entitled to those Engle findings. 
6           And in her entitlement to those Engle 
7 findings, you will see they have been found guilty 
8 of fraud and conspiracy and making a product that 
9 is defective and unreasonably dangerous, more 
10 dangerous than it needs to be, because, as I told 
11 you in opening statement, it's inhalable. 
12           That unleashed the demon of addiction 
13 that never before existed.  It's been engineered 
14 like one of the most highly engineered small 
15 devices on the planet as nothing more than a 
16 nicotine delivery system. 
17           It's a drug.  It's nothing more than a 
18 drug, and one of the hardest things to wrap your 
19 mind around is that it looks like everything else.  
20           Our kids say:  One of these things is 
21 not like the other.
22           MR. DAVIS:  Objection.  Objection, Your 
23 Honor.  Your Honor, please.  
24           THE COURT:  Mr. Schlesinger, no 
25 reference to "kids."
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Excuse me.  
2           THE COURT:  And don't know a 
3 demonstrative unless the defense knows what it is, 
4 please.
5           MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is a box of 
6 Frosted Flakes. 
7           That youth and young people, if you go 
8 into a store, everything looks the same, Imodium, 
9 Frosted Flakes, a deck of cards.  The color 
10 schemes are the same. 
11           These look like normal consumer 
12 products.  These are sardines.  Sorry.  Sardines, 
13 normal consumer products.  
14           But it's a scourge that hides in plain 
15 sight.  Cigarettes are an irrational magnes that 
16 exists in our society.  
17           When used as intended, they kill half of 
18 their customers.  There's nothing like that in the 
19 history of civilization, nothing.  If you use them 
20 the way they're to be intended, they kill.  
21           And why?  Because they are nothing more 
22 than drugs.  That's what they are.  
23           They are more defective and dangerous 
24 than they need to be because they don't have to be 
25 inhalable, and that's controlled by these tobacco 5316
1 companies.  
2           They don't have to be addictive because 
3 the nicotine is completely controllable.  They can 
4 remove it and lower the level below addictive 
5 levels, and people will have a choice whether or 
6 not they're going to smoke. 
7           But they don't do it because then the 
8 roaring of river of cash would be interrupted, and 
9 they would not make the money they made, and they 
10 trade that money for human lives, and that, I say 
11 is indecent and reprehensible and deserves censure 
12 by you.  
13           Mary is a conduit to that opportunity 
14 today to protect future generations and deter, and 
15 the harm that they've done to others is why you 
16 heard the evidence from Dr. Cummings for a whole 
17 week explaining all of the damage and scourge this 
18 tobacco addiction causes.  
19           It's an addiction-driven epidemic, 
20 that's all it is, with eyes-wide-open greed, and 
21 you know what?  It's an American story.  It's not 
22 tolerable in this country.  It's one of the things 
23 that's terribly wrong, and it's worth -- it's 
24 worth thinking about, and it's worth doing 
25 something about, and you have power today, and we 5317
1 ask you to exercise it.  
2           These are the cigarettes.  She smoked 
3 them all for various amounts of years.  
4 Mr. Johnstone put out some of the timing on it, 
5 how you should do it.  
6           Is this going to work for me, Rob?  
7           MR. PHILIPSON:  It should.  
8           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay. 
9           Greater weight of the evidence -- can I 
10 have my scales? 
11           The greater weight of the evidence, the 
12 scales start out even.  When we put all the 
13 evidence on the scales, what weighs more, what 
14 sways me more, what weighs more, what sways me 
15 more?  
16           We're looking just for the preponderance 
17 of evidence.  They start out.  We put the 
18 scales -- we put our evidence on.  They put their 
19 evidence on.  Which way does it go?  What's the 
20 better weight of the evidence?  
21           Every single treating physician, men 
22 that -- they appeared by videotape.  You know why?  
23 Because they're down at the University of Miami 
24 trying to save lives of victims of tobacco 
25 addiction whose lungs are being cut out and whose 5318
1 insides are being radiated and whose lungs are 
2 deteriorating, and their throats are being cut out 
3 because of the product these gentlemen sell.
4           MR. DAVIS:  Objection, Your Honor.  Not 
5 based on any evidence in the case.  
6           THE COURT:  I sustain the objection. 
7           Ladies and gentlemen, disregard those 
8 remarks from counsel.
9           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Those doctors take 
10 care of cancer caused by smoking.  
11           Did Mary Cooper have any idea, did she 
12 have the first clue when she was smoking 
13 cigarettes as an 11-year-old girl that grew up in 
14 the shadow of the king, the RJR factory down the 
15 road from her house in Tobacco Country, doing what 
16 everybody else her age did. 
17           And remember presentism, 1951, born in a 
18 time and in a place.  Look at it the way she 
19 looked at it then.  Remember what she said? 
20           A 13-year-old, I was invincible. 
21           Remember what Dr. Claude Teague said?  
22 At 18 and under, at 17 years old, 16 years old, 
23 youth think they are invincible. 
24           The warning that they're going to put on 
25 the package of products is going to be a plus 5319
1 because kids want to do things that are 
2 risk-taking.  
3           So these -- paint stripper, welding 
4 torches, ant poison, napalm, lighter fluid, car 
5 batteries, carbon monoxide, exhaust fumes, 
6 insecticide, embalming fluid, lethal injection 
7 poison, cyanide, polonium, it's radioactive, did 
8 Mary Cooper have any idea this was in her -- this 
9 was in her cigarettes?  Absolutely not.  
10           So don't get confused about class 
11 membership.  It's the simplest concept in the 
12 world. 
13           This is an addiction-driven epidemic and 
14 nothing more.  Nobody smokes, no one sticks a lit 
15 stick and inhales gases into their lungs that make 
16 you cough when you learn. 
17           Remember you heard Dr. Cummings with 
18 Hardee Bass talking about the learning.  It's 
19 unpleasant.  We've got to keep then going.  We've 
20 got to make them think there's some other reason 
21 to get into it, and then we're going to hook them 
22 with the nicotine. 
23           This is the nicotine business.  The 
24 nicotine is the center of the universe, but we 
25 live in an interesting world. 5320
1           It's hard to wrap your mind around it.  
2 When you see it, it looks like every other 
3 consumer product.  So it's hard to understand it's 
4 really drug addiction. 
5           That's what -- we're trying to deprogram 
6 folks who think:  Wow, yeah, it's a product. 
7           They enjoy it. 
8           Enjoyment, satisfaction, pleasure, these 
9 terms are absurd, nonsensical, and irrelevant to 
10 drug addiction.  
11           It's the most wide drug addiction in the 
12 country, you know.  These drugs kill 480,000 
13 people a year.  Heroin kills 4,000.  
14           Class membership is not about fault.  
15 Mary is willing to take her fair share if they'll 
16 take their fair share. 
17           So when you are deciding about class 
18 membership, you contextualize first:  Was she 
19 dependent?  
20           The Engle findings that I showed you in 
21 opening statement describe the class, and the 
22 class is described as all Floridians. 
23           And I open my arms and I embrace all 
24 Floridians who were sickened or lost loved ones 
25 from diseases caused by tobacco addiction to 5321
1 nicotine in cigarettes.  
2           That's how the word is of what the class 
3 is, not no Floridians, the null class.  Every one 
4 of their logical arguments, anybody can quit, 
5 well, you know what? 
6           She could have quit if she had tried 
7 harder, or maybe she should have tried harder, but 
8 they should have quit too; they should have quit 
9 lying. 
10           The very first caution on the side of a 
11 pack of cigarettes, after this young lady had been 
12 already smoking for years as an 11-year-old with 
13 no concept of the future, said:  Cigarettes may be 
14 hazardous. 
15           Do you remember that Christmas carton we 
16 showed you:  Cigarettes may be hazardous, and, 
17 then again, they may not be, perfectly in keeping 
18 with the doubt campaign they launched in the '50s 
19 that they celebrated as a success to keep 
20 cigarettes continuing to be sold.  
21           This is not anything to do with class 
22 membership.  That comes into the fault section, 
23 and you can give Mary 5 percent.  You can give her 
24 10 percent.  You can give her 15 percent.  You 
25 could do whatever you want and give her 1 percent. 5322
1           I say 1 percent.  I think Crane was too 
2 generous, because here's what I say:  What they 
3 did was 100 times worse than whatever her human 
4 weaknesses were.  
5           And whatever her inability to understand 
6 what she had gotten herself into, I say:  When 
7 they did it on purpose and she was someone who had 
8 human weakness, what they did is 100 percent 
9 worse, 100 times worse. 
10           He says it was 20 times worse.  Maybe 
11 you think it was 10 times worse.  Maybe you think 
12 she is just as responsible as them.  That's why 
13 you get to fill out the form, not us.  
14           All we're doing is suggesting how it 
15 should be filled out.  So this is how you apply 
16 the facts of law.  It can't be any more direct.  
17           They quoted from Neal Benowitz's New 
18 England Journal of Medicine article:  Addiction to 
19 nicotine is the proximate cause of diseases of 
20 lung cancer.  
21           You heard about Agharkar and his 
22 forensics.  Proximate cause is a legal cause.  And 
23 here is what it is, you're addicted to nicotine.  
24 It's a legal cause of smoking, not the legal 
25 cause. 5323
1           Watch that word.  The difference between 
2 the word "a" and "the" is very importance because, 
3 very simply, it can act in combination with other 
4 causes.  
5           A legal cause.  Was the nicotine 
6 dependence driving that smoking in Mary, to some 
7 extent, enough that it was a substantial, 
8 continuous, direct, significant cause of her 
9 getting sick? 
10           Of course it was because all smokers are 
11 similarly situated.  That's all it is.  
12           This is what the defendants would tell 
13 you, but that is not what the instructions say, 
14 and the defendants have a slide that say this, and 
15 they want to say these three things. 
16           That's got nothing to do with it.  
17 You'll see that slide.  That's not what the law in 
18 the case is.  That's not how the instruction 
19 reads.  
20           And then this is the Benowitz article:  
21 Nicotine -- in causing smoking-induced diseases, 
22 addiction to nicotine is the proximate cause of 
23 these diseases. 
24           This is June 25th, 2010, New England 
25 Journal of Medicine, one of the most highly 5324
1 respected journals ever:  Nicotine addiction 
2 drives disease.  
3           The Surgeon General's report that 
4 Dr. Agharkar doesn't accept, a completely 
5 unqualified guy here making a ton of money, coming 
6 in here. 
7           And there's a rule, and you're going to 
8 learn this rule.  I'm going to give you power.  
9 Here's the power I give you:  In the jury 
10 instruction, you have the believability of 
11 witnesses. 
12           And there are regular witnesses to be 
13 believed.  Those are the treating doctors that 
14 come in with no ax to grind who were there at the 
15 time only doing one thing, and that's taking care 
16 of Mary. 
17           They're credible.  Their records exist 
18 at the time.  They're credible and believable. 
19           These guys can hire anybody they want 
20 and pay them anything they want, hundreds of 
21 thousands of dollars, and get a guy that's making 
22 a half a million a year who went to medical school 
23 so he could become an expert, because days after 
24 he got out of medical school, he got on the 
25 witness stand -- 5325
1           MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor, objection.
2           MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- and he became --
3           THE COURT:  Mr. Schlesinger, hang on.  
4           MR. BELASIC:  Objection.  No evidence in 
5 the record of that.  
6           THE COURT:  The objection is overruled. 
7           Ladies and gentlemen, you'll determine 
8 what the evidence is in the case. 
9           Go ahead, sir.
10           MR. SCHLESINGER:  And Dr. Agharkar, with 
11 no credentials to say anything else, takes 
12 exception with the Surgeon General's report that 
13 is in evidence in this case and is relied upon and 
14 is the statement of the chief medical officer of 
15 the United States of America, who is charged with 
16 protecting us, the Americans, the public health, 
17 who only, conservatively and incrementally with 
18 science and study, approaches the truth and 
19 acknowledges it when it's rock solid science.  
20           They don't have to play by those rules, 
21 and so they belittle him, and they say the Surgeon 
22 General is having scare tactics. 
23           And what do they do?  They say it's 
24 irresponsible.  They do the same thing that 
25 Dr. Agharkar came in here, he doesn't agree with 5326
1 the Surgeon General. 
2           What does the Surgeon General say?  
3           Nicotine addiction is the fundamental 
4 reason that individuals persist in using tobacco 
5 products, and persistent tobacco use contributes 
6 to many diseases described in this report. 
7           That's 2010, and that's explaining why 
8 nicotine addiction is how you get sick.  Nobody 
9 smokes 350,000 cigarettes and takes 3 million 
10 direct hits of nicotine to the brain, leaving a 
11 permanent mark, the hard mark of addiction, unless 
12 they are driven by smoking.  
13           A woman that was petrified to leave the 
14 house without a pack of cigarettes, scared to be 
15 without cigarettes, a woman who had -- when they 
16 cut her voice box out, was writing:  I want a 
17 cigarette so bad. 
18           That's how powerful nicotine addiction 
19 is when it changes your brain.  
20           And then, again, the same thing:  
21 Nicotine maintains the addiction and thereby leads 
22 to ongoing exposures to smokers to chemical 
23 compounds with known adverse health effects.  
24           This is why Mary is a class member.  
25 This is why Mary relied on their marketing plan. 5327
1 Their marketing plan fit her to a tee.  She 
2 followed along. 
3           So all throughout -- this is just a 
4 bunch of quotes.  I'll do it real quick.  They 
5 knew full well and they denied it like the dickens 
6 viciously, vituperatively against the Surgeon 
7 General to confuse the message and muddy the 
8 waters and instill fears in addicts and confuse 
9 them and give them an illusion of safety and give 
10 them a psychological crutch to keep smoking. 
11           They knew all along, the '60s, the '70s, 
12 the '80s, all along that their business was 
13 nicotine delivery.  
14           The dominant specification designing a 
15 cigarette is nicotine delivery. 
16           And right there, they call them rats.  
17 They describe their customers as a rat in a cage, 
18 because they refer to themselves and their health 
19 and their well-being. 
20           And Diane Burrows in '84 talking about 
21 the youth market and 12-year-olds saying, you 
22 know:  Just like a population has to continue to 
23 give birth or it will dwindle, she's talking about 
24 us, us as tobacco people. 
25           We're going to give birth to new 5328
1 smokers, replacement smokers, young people.  
2 That's the cycle of this business. 
3           Start -- all smoking starts in 
4 adolescent and youth, and that's where it starts, 
5 and that's where that addiction is so vulnerable, 
6 they're so vulnerable to that addiction.  
7           And then that hook pulls them along.  
8 They're hooked, and they're pulled along, and 
9 they're customers, and they're cash cows, and they 
10 produce cash. 
11           And then when they get sick or die and 
12 they're worthless to the tobacco company, the 
13 tobacco company maintains equilibrium, as 
14 Dr. Cummings said, and they recruit young smokers, 
15 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, 14-year-olds.  
16           What are we supposed to do in this 
17 country with our children?  What are we concerned 
18 about? 
19           Protecting, not addicting.  You don't 
20 prey on children.  You protect them.
21           MR. DAVIS:  Objection.
22           MS. BRAY:  Objection, Your Honor.
23           MR. PEDROSA:  Motion for mistrial.  
24           MR. BELASIC:  Objection, Your Honor.
25           THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, 5329
1 there's no evidence in this case about that.  I 
2 have stricken that.  You should disregard that 
3 remark and not consider it at all during your 
4 deliberations. 
5           Does everybody understand?  
6           THE JURY PANEL:  Yes.  
7           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Let me use -- I'm not 
8 going to say the word "children."  The word is 
9 "youth," young people and teenagers. 
10           I'm going to show you one of the 
11 documents here from Lorillard:  The basis of our 
12 business is the high school student.  
13           You should protect youth.  You should 
14 not prey on them.  Protect them.  Don't addict 
15 them.  That is what should be done.  That is what 
16 is moral and decent.  
17           And if a corporation wants to say:  I'm 
18 a person.  Treat me like a person.  You know what?  
19 You want to be treated like a person, act like a 
20 person.  
21           They know that no one has ever become a 
22 cigarette smoker by smoking cigarettes without 
23 nicotine.  They know that full well.  
24           And, quite frankly, Dr. Agharkar 
25 admitted that if there was no nicotine in 5330
1 cigarettes, Mary would have never smoked.  
2           And in 1953 when they launched that 
3 conspiracy and they put out that Frank Statement, 
4 they said:  We'd never make an injurious product.  
5 We're going to have an impeccable scientist of 
6 unimpeachable repute get up there and really find 
7 what's going on.  We don't think we have injurious 
8 products.  We'll stop making it. 
9           If they had done any of that at that 
10 time, if they had been truthful, instead of liars, 
11 they could have stopped making it until they found 
12 out what was wrong with it and made it safe. 
13           And she never would have become a smoker 
14 and if she wasn't watching cartoons, Fred 
15 Flintstone, as a little girl, right in the year 
16 where she was a little girl, and The Beverly 
17 Hillbillies. 
18           And folks of an age know the Beverly 
19 Hillbillies, watching cigarette smoking, she 
20 wouldn't have become a smoker. 
21           But you know what they would tell you?  
22 Fred Flintstone, he chose to smoke.  If he was in 
23 here:  It was Fred Flintstone's choice to smoke. 
24           Okay.  That's what they would tell you. 
25           Granny, it was her choice to smoke. 5331
1           That's what they would tell you.  
2           The bottom line is they say right in 
3 here:  The cigarette isn't even the product.  The 
4 cigarette is a package.  The product is nicotine.  
5 The cigarette is a nicotine delivery device.  
6           They know that, and they then they come 
7 into this courtroom, and the language they use 
8 very cleverly is a tautology.  It's a denial of 
9 addiction. 
10           They say:  Oh, it can be addictive, but 
11 then they set out an explanation by which nobody 
12 could ever be addicted, because no matter how much 
13 you smoked, you could have smoked more. 
14           You smoked one pack?  That's not enough.  
15 You need two. 
16           Oh, you smoked two packs?  That's not 
17 enough.  You need three.
18           You smoked three packs?  That's not 
19 enough.  You need four.
20           Oh, you tried to quit?  You didn't quit 
21 long enough.  You didn't spend enough time 
22 quitting. 
23           Oh, you used the patch?  You didn't use 
24 the patch enough. 
25           Well, what did they do to help her?  You 5332
1 know what, if you want to do something right, you 
2 want to be a responsible corporation, you know 
3 you're selling an addictive drug, how about if you 
4 take it upon yourself to say:  We are not going to 
5 let anyone under 21 years old ever get a 
6 cigarette.  We're going to put it behind the 
7 counter at the pharmacy and demand a prescription. 
8           You know why?  Ninety percent of the 
9 business would disappear.  It would still be a 
10 business.  They'd still make tons of money, 
11 hundreds of millions instead of billions.  That 
12 wouldn't be good enough?
13           Give people a real choice, but you don't 
14 have smoking that starts after 21.  The basis of 
15 the business is the high school student. 
16           That's the dirty little secret about 
17 this business that's been going on for decades, 
18 that's going on today unchanged. 
19           There's no mitigation.  You saw the 
20 magazines they still advertise in.  There's been 
21 no mitigation.  
22           In any event, it causes cancer.  It's 
23 full of poison.  The addiction is what keeps 
24 people sucking that poison their lungs. 
25           And bit by bit, millions of doses by 5333
1 millions of doses, it kills half a million people 
2 every year, 20 million since the 1964 Surgeon 
3 General report. 
4           What good did that do if 20 million 
5 people died? 
6           Because they're addicted.  You can't 
7 tell addicted people:  Oh, just quit.  
8           So this guy, Cummings, Cummings is a 
9 hero.  What Cummings does is of such important 
10 benefit to the public health that he should be 
11 lauded and honored.  You-all got a chance to see 
12 what should be given college credit for, something 
13 that's out there; and unless you're interested in 
14 it, unless we turn your attention to it, you don't 
15 get to see it.  
16           The man's life is dedicated to trying to 
17 save people from being killed by tobacco 
18 addiction.  
19           And he gets treated in this courtroom in 
20 a way that you can judge.  Was he credible?  Did 
21 they attack him because what he does is abhorrent?  
22           Well, I have news for you, would you 
23 attack a cop for being against crime?  
24           They say he's a warrior in the war on 
25 tobacco.  He's a soldier in the war on tobacco. 5334
1           I'm a soldier in the war on tobacco.
2           MR. PEDROSA:  Objection.  
3           MR. SCHLESINGER:  My client Mary is a 
4 casualty -- 
5           MR. PEDROSA:  Objection.  
6           MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- in the war on 
7 tobacco.
8           MR. PEDROSA:  Personal opinion, and I 
9 object to Mr. Schlesinger shouting.
10           THE COURT:  I sustain the objection, 
11 Mr. Schlesinger.
12           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Sorry.
13           THE COURT:  This case is about the facts 
14 as framed in the jury instructions and nothing 
15 more and nothing less. 
16           Sir, please stick to the evidence.
17           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay. 
18           Sorry what I said, and I'll keep going 
19 fast, but I won't be as fired up.  Sorry about 
20 that.
21           Anyway, the Fagerstrom test, she's 
22 addicted under it.  One of the key components 
23 validated. 
24           Everybody knows the first thing in the 
25 morning, you smoke, you smoke while you're still 5335
1 in bed, key component not only of deep addiction, 
2 which she met the highest level of severity of 
3 addiction, she's a full-time smoker. 
4           Dr. Cummings evaluated her.  He said 
5 Fagerstrom, it's the most validated test.  It's 
6 the test that's used all over. 
7           Rj Reynolds uses it.  Philip Morris uses 
8 it.  We got that out on cross-examination of 
9 Dr. Agharkar. 
10           She's highly addicted under the 
11 Fagerstrom test.  Even Agharkar said, yeah, 
12 Fagerstrom is the authority on it.  It's the most 
13 widely used test.  Even the defendants use it.  
14 She's addicted.  There's no doubt about it.  
15           And then addiction versus free choice, 
16 here it is in a nutshell very simply:  In '89, two 
17 factors refute the argument that smoking is a 
18 matter of free choice. 
19           Most smokers start smoking as teenagers, 
20 then become addicted. 
21           That's what happened to her.  Not a 
22 teenager.  Twelve is not a teenager.  Eleven is 
23 not a teenager.  
24           Starting smoking at that age when the 
25 pediatric brain, still in its adolescence, still 5336
1 developing, is so uniquely susceptible to exposure 
2 to nicotine that the brain changes and is rewired 
3 permanently, that's not a teenager.  
4           And then from then on, smokers aren't 
5 smoking for fun; they're smoking to avoid the 
6 withdrawal effects from that cigarette when the 
7 nicotine wears off in a few minutes.
8           And they smoke to feel normal, and then 
9 a tobacco defendant will say:  Well, you should 
10 try harder.  You should be more motivated.  You 
11 could try harder to quit. 
12           That's great.  You know, that's really 
13 easy to tell somebody else what to do.  Lose more 
14 weight.  Do this.  Do that. 
15           When you're deeply addicted and your 
16 brain is wired in such a way as you don't feel 
17 normal unless your receptors are filled with 
18 nicotine, it isn't easy to quit. 
19           Do you know why?  It's pain, and if 
20 someone is trying to run a seven-minute mile that 
21 can run an eight-minute mile, try to run that 
22 seven-minute mile and feel that pain. 
23           And what is that pain going to do?  It's 
24 going to slow you down and stop because people 
25 avoid pain. 5337
1           And the brain is changed, and they need 
2 the nicotine to feel normal.  It's not fun.  It's 
3 not for taste.  It's not for satisfaction.  It's 
4 not for any of those marketing terms.  It never 
5 has been.  
6           So they recognize that tobacco use as an 
7 addiction is critical for both treating the 
8 tobacco user and understanding why people continue 
9 to use tobacco despite its known health risks.  
10           This is in the late '80s.  Scientists 
11 are just now understanding it because tobacco is 
12 suppressing that knowledge. 
13           The memo, the lawyer memo that 
14 Mr. Johnstone showed you about:  Hey, you know 
15 what, the most powerful weapon a prosecuting 
16 attorney can have is this business about 
17 addiction.  We can't defend a case as free choice 
18 if a person is addicted. 
19           This is back before there was a 
20 declaration by the public health authority it was 
21 addictive.  That was in 1980.  They were able to 
22 keep it out of the Surgeon General for another 
23 eight years.  
24           And in between those eight years, if 
25 somebody had gotten that information to millions 5338
1 of smokers, including my client Mary, it would 
2 have made a difference. 
3           It would have been material and 
4 important information that she could have used and 
5 relied on to maybe get the help.  
6           And if someone is a 30-year-old and 
7 they've been smoking a tobacco product since 
8 they're 15 years old and they go to the tobacco 
9 company and say:  You know what, I want to start a 
10 family now.  I'm addicted.  I need help, would it 
11 be responsible of a corporation to say:  You know 
12 what, we've made money off you.  We have smoking 
13 cessation centers.  We're going to help you get 
14 off this drug because we know it's terribly 
15 addictive, and we're going to help you. 
16           Did they do that?  No.  That's what a 
17 responsible corporation could do.  There are many 
18 things that could have been done to mitigate this. 
19           Menthol?  Menthol is more addictive.  
20 They know it.  One-third of all smoking is 
21 menthol.  She was a life-long menthol smoker. 
22           It eases initiation in youth.  It 
23 deepens addiction and makes it more difficult to 
24 quit.
25           MR. PEDROSA:  Objection.  Outside the 5339
1 evidence.  
2           THE COURT:  Overruled. 
3           The jury will determine what the 
4 evidence is.
5           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Dr. Cummings testified 
6 to this.  
7           And Mary as a menthol smoker was even 
8 more deeply addicted, and Mary never had that 
9 help.  
10           And it says there that the prevalence of 
11 individuals diagnosed as nicotine dependent is 
12 higher than for any other substance use disorder.  
13           This you saw:  We can't defend if 
14 they're addicted, and yet they do.  
15           There's the simple truth.  We're 
16 spending weeks in this courtroom.  We're trying to 
17 make people understand something that's hard to 
18 wrap your mind around with good reason because 
19 these products all look the same.  
20           A chocolate bar looks like a box of Pall 
21 Mall or a box of Camel Crush.  How can you tell 
22 the difference between any of these?  A kid could 
23 pick it up and say -- 
[#DELETED OBJECTION DIALOGUE#]
[#DELETED MOTION FOR MISTRIAL#]
10           MR. SCHLESINGER:  If it pleases the 
11 Court, and I apologize, I'm using synonyms I 
12 shouldn't.  It's "youth" and "teenagers."  That's 
13 all I mean. 
14           Honestly, if I misspeak, it's not 
15 intentional.  All I'm saying is if you go into a 
16 store, it looks like a normal consumer product. 
17           It could be gum.  It could be Apple 
18 Jacks cereal, a box of chocolate or Camel Crush, 
19 and the point of it is, it hides in plain sight, 
20 and people don't recognize it for what it is, but 
21 it's drugs.  That's all it is.  
22           That's why I said it's the simple truth.  
23 You can spend a lot of time discussing it, but 
24 that's what it is.  It's the simple truth.
25           And then here is -- one of the laws 5345
1 you'll see:  Addiction is a legal cause of injury 
2 if it directly and in natural, continuous sequence 
3 produces or contributes to substantially producing 
4 such loss, injury, or damage so that it can be 
5 reasonably said but for the addiction of 
6 cigarettes containing nicotine, such laryngeal 
7 cancer would not have occurred.  
8           And here's how I break it down and make 
9 it understandable:  Contributes substantially.  
10 Did the addiction play an important role, in Mary, 
11 a pack-and-a-half to a two-pack-a-day smoker for 
12 over 30 years.
13           She got laryngeal cancer at a young age, 
14 in her 40s.  Would she have smoked that many 
15 cigarettes for that long if she wasn't addicted? 
16           And the answer is, of course not.  
17           So this is the blah, blah, blah.  You'll 
18 have to read it.  The bottom line is, I call it 
19 the lumper, the lumper meaning that in order to be 
20 a legal cause of laryngeal cancer, it doesn't have 
21 to be the only cause. 
22           It can act in combination with a bunch 
23 of other causes.  Because she chose to smoke, she 
24 didn't try hard enough to quit, she loved the 
25 taste of sucking that smoke down in her lungs, any 5346
1 of those things could be a contributing cause as 
2 long as the addiction was a substantial and 
3 important cause, not an independent cause. 
4           And I just showed you a bunch of 
5 documents from the defense, their internal secret 
6 documents that we ripped out of their secret 
7 coffers through litigation, that says:  We're in 
8 the nicotine business, and nobody is going to 
9 smoke without nicotine. 
10           So they've admitted internally what 
11 they've denied publicly all the way through '94, 
12 in 1988 when the Surgeon General said, in '94 when 
13 the CEOs were brought before Congress.  
14           They knew it full on all along that it 
15 was an addictive drug, and they denied it, but 
16 that's just the truth of it. 
17           So it can be in combination with 
18 different things.  You'll read it.  It's a little 
19 confusing, but it's the big picture.  It's the 
20 lumper. 
21           It's not going to be:  Is it this or is 
22 it that?  Oh, she liked smoking, or:  She didn't 
23 try hard enough to quit.  
24           That does not break the chain of the 
25 dependence-driven disease any more than addiction, 5347
1 the epidemic of addiction disease that's killed 20 
2 million people since '64 was because of this 
3 terrible scourge of nicotine addiction. 
4           They didn't care.  They were making 
5 money, a roaring river of cash.  They didn't care 
6 about Mary Cooper.  They didn't care about any of 
7 the customers. 
8           They just wanted them to smoke.  Smoke, 
9 die, and don't bother us after you're dead, and 
10 we'll replace you with youth. 
11           So this is that medical explanation in 
12 2004:  Nicotine addiction leads to cigarette 
13 smoking, a whole bunch of fancy biochemical 
14 things.  Your cells change.  You get genetic 
15 damage.  Stuff goes wrong, and then, bang, you get 
16 lung cancer.  This poor lady, she's a wisp. 
17           You know Ralph Fiennes was in a movie 
18 called "The English Patient."  I don't know if you 
19 ever saw it, and he laid there, and he got burned.  
20 He was in a hospital bed. 
21           It was an interesting, long -- but Ralph 
22 Fiennes is a great actor.  I like him.  
23           And he was talking to folks that were 
24 looking after him as he lay in his bed, you know, 
25 burned all over his body, and he said:  I'm just a 5348
1 bit of toast, my friend.  
2           And he was burned on the outside. 
3           Well, she's been burned and consumed and 
4 eaten up on the inside.  She is a living 
5 embodiment of the commercial for Tobacco Free 
6 Florida that we see on TV all the time.
7           MR. PEDROSA:  Objection.  
8           MR. DAVIS:  Objection.  Outside the --
9           MR. SCHLESINGER:  She is that living 
10 embodiment.
11           THE COURT:  Overruled.  
12           The jury will determine --
13           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Mr. Belasic --
14           THE COURT:  -- what the evidence is.
15           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Mr. Belasic made a 
16 cute joke during the cross-examination of Mary:  
17 You smoke pot.  Oh, you smoke pot. 
18           This is the year 2014.  Half of the 
19 states in this country have legalized pot either 
20 medicinally or recreationally.  
21           And her medical records said she smoked 
22 pot to relieve stress.  Well, that's a medicinal 
23 reason in half of the country now. 
24           What world are we living in that talking 
25 about smoking pot should gasp and besmirch this 5349
1 woman in a way that she doesn't deserve a verdict? 
2           And which of us in here is somebody 
3 that, if they were undergoing microscopic scrutiny 
4 of their existence, would be wondering:  Wow, I 
5 wonder if they asked me that question.  I wonder 
6 if that could be the linchpin to everything. 
7           And, by the way, the clever thing he 
8 said -- and he's a smart guy.  Mr. Belasic is very 
9 smart.  He said:  You didn't see any billboards 
10 that were advertising for marijuana when you chose 
11 as an adult to try marijuana. 
12           Well, if you drive up and down I-95 
13 right now, there are billboards on marijuana.  You 
14 could get in the marijuana business because 
15 they're thinking about legalizing marijuana in the 
16 State of Florida. 
17           In the world we live in right now, 
18 smoking marijuana, as so many of our recent past 
19 presidents have done, and millions of people do --
20           MR. PEDROSA:  Objection, Your Honor.
21           MR. DAVIS:  Objection, Your Honor.
22           MR. PEDROSA:  This has nothing to do 
23 with the evidence.  
24           MR. BELASIC:  This has nothing to do 
25 with the evidence.  Can we have a sidebar?
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1           THE COURT:  All right, folks.  Listen, 
2 billboards on 95 are not in evidence.  They're not 
3 before you. 
4           Marijuana in Florida is not before you, 
5 and what presidents smoked marijuana is not before 
6 you.  Okay.  So disregard all those remarks.
7           Stick to the evidence, Mr. Schlesinger.  
8           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, sir.  Sorry. 
9           Anyway, this is how many lifetime 
10 exposures of poisonous chemicals she got into her 
11 lungs and how many direct hits of nicotine she got 
12 to her brain. 
13           The nicotine, they could take out and 
14 make it nonaddictive.  People wouldn't die and 
15 get -- sick and get die -- sick and die, or they 
16 could make it not inhalable, go back to mouth 
17 puffing, like pipes and cigars, and people 
18 wouldn't get sick and die. 
19           But the fact is, it's that addiction 
20 unleashed by deep inhalation is what gets you 
21 going. 
22           So all this evidence of addiction in 
23 Mary, she was a constant smoker.  She smoked in 
24 bed.  She smelled like cigarettes.  She 
25 chain-smoked.  She smoked in the middle of the 5351
1 night.  She smoked.  
2           Was she addicted to cigarettes 
3 containing nicotine, and was it a legal cause of 
4 her laryngeal cancer?  You bet.  
5           And then of course the Engle jury 
6 findings, all important in this case.  They are 
7 unreasonably dangerous, meaning defective and more 
8 dangerous than they need to be, and they've done 
9 nothing to make them safer. 
10           They committed fraud.  They gathered up 
11 to a conspiracy, and they hid and omitted material 
12 information not otherwise known or available, 
13 meaning Mary Cooper, as a class member, was 
14 deprived of information they knew.  
15           And when they did it -- and they all got 
16 together in an amazingly successful conspiracy, 
17 because if you've ever been in Daytona in Bike 
18 Week, the T-shirt on the back of the bikers says:  
19 Three people can keep a secret if two of them are 
20 dead. 
21           Somehow a giant corporation kept a 
22 secret among higher-ups for decades, and a roaring 
23 river of cash was produced because of it, all on 
24 the backs of sick and dying smokers by a company 
25 that didn't care. 5352
1           How could you lose your moral compass?  
2 How could you let something like that happen? 
3           She was caught in that trap.  They knew.  
4 It was their intention that smokers and the public 
5 would rely on this information to their detriment.  
6           Mary relied on the information to her 
7 detriment.  They didn't tell her about the poisons 
8 in smoke.  They didn't tell her about the serious 
9 addictiveness of smoke. 
10           Even when she thought she was addicted, 
11 she didn't understand what it meant.  For many of 
12 the Surgeon General's reports, they kept saying:  
13 It's a personal choice behavior. 
14           There's no personal choice behavior, and 
15 here's the important thing, because I remember 
16 from looking at some of y'all's backgrounds, a lot 
17 of you folks are not smokers.  You've never 
18 smoked.  You've never been around smoking.  You've 
19 never had the experience. 
20           And as Dr. Cummings testified, if you've 
21 never smoked, you have no idea the power of 
22 nicotine addiction.  
23           Ay-yi-yi.  Okay.  This one is basically 
24 that all the members of the conspiracy, all 
25 co-conspirators, when you're in a conspiracy, 5353
1 anything any of your co-conspirators do that 
2 furthers the conspiracy encompasses your 
3 responsibility.  
4           So if Philip Morris did something bad 
5 and Reynolds was a part of that conspiracy, 
6 they're on the hook. 
7           Same thing with Liggett.  Liggett is 
8 little Liggett, and they're not going to get as 
9 much of this on them if you see this our way 
10 because they were in the conspiracy. 
11           Mary didn't smoke a lot of their 
12 cigarettes.  There's only going to be a few 
13 percentage points for them, but they were part of 
14 the conspiracy, and Dr. Cummings testified to it. 
15           One of the things I liked was they kept 
16 saying:  Look at all this research we gave.  Look 
17 at all these papers we put in through the CTR, and 
18 we got a thank you letter. 
19           The public health official sent us a 
20 thank you letter.  The National Cancer Institute 
21 said:  Thank you for sending us this information. 
22           They didn't know they were being lied 
23 to.  They didn't know it was a fraud.  They didn't 
24 know it was like:  Thank you for suckering us.  
25 Thank you for confusing us so we don't declare 5354
1 nicotine addictive until 1988. 
2           They want credit for that?  We conned 
3 the public health authority, and we want credit 
4 because we got away with it and they sent us a 
5 thank you letter.  
6           Again, combination.  This is the lumper.  
7 Many different things can contribute to cause, 
8 cause something to occur, addiction if it 
9 contributes, and it did.  
10           Ay-yi-yi.  Look at this one.  There's a 
11 lot.  Concealment, omission -- too much there.  
12 We're going to skip that one. 
13           Now let me tell you about Mary.  Tobacco 
14 companies created a new product for this altered 
15 product, okay, a new market for this altered 
16 product, mass marketing, mass production, mass 
17 inhalation, all of a sudden, mass sales, like:  
18 Wow.  Look at this.  We're selling billions of 
19 these sticks. 
20           Camel was invented in 1913.  It 
21 celebrated its 100th birthday last year, the Camel 
22 cigarette.  Here come the Camels. 
23           They invented this product.  They 
24 altered the natural tobacco plant that was used by 
25 Native Americans for religious ceremonies puffing 5355
1 through a pipe, keeping it in your mouth, not the 
2 tennis court size area in the lungs to suck an 
3 unnatural thing, suck smoke that's noxious into 
4 your lungs. 
5           So it became the social norm.  Everybody 
6 smoked, just like Mary Cooper.  She relied.  
7           Smokers most commonly switch to brands, 
8 the leading brands, as they're advertised more 
9 frequently and gain popularity in the market, just 
10 like Mary Cooper. 
11           A quarter trillion dollars in 
12 advertising, 250 thousand million dollars in 
13 advertising, that would be a waste of money if it 
14 didn't sell cigarettes, if it didn't show young, 
15 fun, alive with pleasure, health. 
16           The FTC said:  There's never any 
17 worthwhile information in a cigarette ad.  It 
18 makes everybody look like they're healthy and 
19 having the greatest time in the world. 
20           That's the imagery.  Advertising works 
21 at a broad societal level.  It isn't supposed to 
22 be direct to her, and the instruction says it can 
23 come circuitously.  It can come from your peers. 
24           It's like a disease that's handed down 
25 from generation to generation.  What a great boon 5356
1 to tobacco that her parents smoked, and she 
2 smoked, and then the tragedy is, then her daughter 
3 begins smoking. 
4           They love that.  That's great for their 
5 business.  They don't want people to quit.  
6 Quitting means quitting buying.  
7           A majority of the smokers fell prey to 
8 the filter fraud.  Filters were, is, are, am, and 
9 always will be a fraud, a fake, a dupe, a dodge, a 
10 straw man. 
11           They even have Dr. Teague proudly 
12 inventing a fake color-changing filter with a dye 
13 so when you suck on it, the white filter tip will 
14 turn brown, and the smoke will attach significance 
15 that something bad is being removed. 
16           And he says in that document, which is 
17 in evidence:  It isn't going to help or do any 
18 filtering, but the marketing advantages are 
19 obvious. 
20           And all throughout this, the filters 
21 were a way to still fears and calm people down and 
22 keep them smoking when that cancer scare first 
23 came out, and it worked.  
24           The same thing with menthol, just like 
25 Mary Cooper did.  Menthol is an additive, and it 5357
1 accounts for a big part of sales in this country. 
2           Menthol is an additive, and she smoked 
3 it.  It was milder.  It was inhalable.  She smoked 
4 it as a young person, and young people are more 
5 susceptible. 
6           Very popular, these Camel Crush 
7 cigarettes now, because they've got the little 
8 mint candy ball that you can pop in them, and 
9 that's how they get you to smoke.
10           Many smokers were fooled by the illusion 
11 of safety created by lights and switched rather 
12 than keep trying to quit, just like Mary Cooper. 
13           And she smoked that Marlboro product for 
14 over ten years, the Marlboro Menthol Lights 100s, 
15 the big, long ones that get you that extra bunch 
16 of nicotine because she's so nicotine dependent. 
17           She moved to lights for the fact that 
18 they seemed safer, and she stuck with them, and it 
19 was later in the game, but the fact of the matter 
20 is she stuck with them because they gave her some 
21 sense of reassurance, and that's what the tobacco 
22 companies wanted her to do.
23           But the fact is the lights were a fraud, 
24 complete fraud.  By 2008, the Federal Trade 
25 Commission knew so. 5358
1           Smokers didn't know the different kinds 
2 of cigarettes they were smoking were just as 
3 dangerous, just like Mary.  She relied.  
4           Cigarette smokers were unaware that the 
5 cigarette companies gamed the system as to lights, 
6 fooled the FTC machine, faked it out, knew that 
7 cigarette smokers were getting every bit of the 
8 tar, just like Mary Cooper. 
9           They didn't know they were engineered to 
10 sustain addiction.  They didn't understand the 
11 inhalability and all the things they put in it, 
12 just like Mary Cooper. 
13           She was entitled to know this 
14 information, just like millions of smokers that 
15 didn't know.  She was entitled to know. 
16           That's all things that were kept from 
17 her and concealed from her that she would have 
18 considered important and might have given her a 
19 fighting chance. 
20           She tried the best she knew how.  When 
21 she warned her daughter:  Don't be like me, and 
22 they're using that to try to say:  Well, she knew 
23 it was bad; she should have done something about 
24 it, she was an addicted smoker.  She was trying to 
25 warn her daughter about getting stuck in this 5359
1 cycle of addiction that can be so hard to escape. 
2           And they had no idea what these guys 
3 were up to behind closed doors.  Nobody knew, even 
4 the public health community until the late '90s 
5 when we got some of their secret documents. 
6           We'll be studying them for the next 100 
7 years because there's 84 million of them, and 
8 they're writing reports about them till this day, 
9 and new things are being learned every day -- 
10           I'm sorry.  I spit on the court 
11 reporter.  I'm sorry. 
12           -- just like Mary Cooper. 
13           Sorry.  
14           Okay.  People can't quit.  Every year, 
15 70 percent of people want to quit.  Some 45, 50 
16 percent of them try.  Seventeen million try.  Less 
17 than three percent are successful in any given 
18 year. 
19           And they say 50 million have quit.  
20 Great.  Fifty million have quit.  Twenty million 
21 have died. 
22           And how many of those 50 million -- how 
23 long did it take for 50 million to quit?  It took 
24 50 years because only a million are quitting a 
25 year.  There's 45 million smokers.  You don't get 5360
1 credit for that.  That's not a badge of honor.  
2           And when people quit and they're out of 
3 the market, they get replacement smokers.  They 
4 get more smokers.  So she failed, and she tried.  
5           I mean it's a sign of being more 
6 addicted if you can't go more than a few hours 
7 without smoking. 
8           Millions are caught in a web of deceit, 
9 just like Mary Cooper.  
10           She is a classic example of an Engle 
11 class member.  She deserves to be in that class 
12 with so many others. 
13           They would tell you that the logic that 
14 they apply to Mary Cooper, if you think about it, 
15 would apply to any smoker ever, and no one could 
16 ever be in the class, and that's why you can -- 
17 that's why you can reject it.  
18           This case is about truth and 
19 consequences.  We're talking about it because when 
20 companies don't tell the truth, there should be 
21 consequences. 
22           When they engineer for addiction, there 
23 should be consequences.  
24           When they target and addict teens, there 
25 should be consequences. 5361
1           When they engineer for addiction, there 
2 will be consequences. 
3           When they offer up safe alternatives to 
4 trying to quit, to get you not to worry about it, 
5 there will be consequences. 
6           When they choose to keep selling 
7 addiction as part of a defective product instead 
8 of fixing it, there will be consequences.  
9           And when they sugar-coat and trivialize 
10 the power of addiction to hook the next generation 
11 of teenagers, putting them at unnecessary and 
12 unreasonable risk, there will be consequences. 
13           If you see it our way, today is a day of 
14 reckoning, you will express it as a form of moral 
15 condemnation.  You will say:  We do not want you 
16 to do this. 
17           And even the littlest person can change 
18 the course of history, and it can make a 
19 difference. 
20           And Mary has paid the ultimate price and 
21 deserves to be here, a living smoker 20 years 
22 after a lawsuit. 
23           How many smokers do you think are alive 
24 after getting sick in 1996, almost 18 years later 
25 to come live to a courtroom? 5362
1           That is not something you're going to 
2 see, and it's what makes this country great.  It 
3 makes our justice system great, because you guys 
4 have no interest in the outcome of this.  You're 
5 completely independent of it. 
6           We're trying to teach you something.  If 
7 you see it our way, it's something today that you 
8 can do that's important.  
9           When you sell a product to millions of 
10 people, the truth matters.  
11           When you don't tell the truth, there 
12 should be consequences, and the devastating 
13 consequences of these defendants' actions driven 
14 by eyes-wide-open greed should have consequences 
15 for them too.  
16           Let's motivate them to reverse engineer 
17 some of the deadliness out of this product and 
18 take away either the inhalability or the 
19 addictiveness or both and go back to puffing on 
20 things that aren't going to kill you.  
21           It isn't worth killing millions of 
22 people to make billions of dollars.  It just 
23 isn't.
24           This is presentism, what people were 
25 like at the time.  The case is about Mary Cooper 5363
1 and very much more.  
2           I talked about this.  This is why this 
3 evidence comes in.  You know, they say:  This case 
4 is about Mary Cooper.  This case is about Mary 
5 Cooper.  It's about Mary Cooper. 
6           No, no, no, it's the Engle progeny case 
7 of conspiracy, fraud, defective product, denial of 
8 addiction that was proven, all for the benefit of 
9 you, because you embrace those findings as if you 
10 determined them yourself. 
11           You take up exactly where the Engle jury 
12 left off back in the year 2000 with these findings 
13 as the armament to go to these defendants and say:  
14 Hey, this is wrong.  You've been found to be 
15 wrong. 
16           They are preclusive.  They cannot deny 
17 that they sell an addictive product.  It's legal.  
18 It isn't legal to sell it to teenagers.  That's no 
19 excuse. 
20           And right here, it says:  You may 
21 consider harms suffered by other parties not -- 
22 other persons not parties to the lawsuit in 
23 assessing the reprehensibility or wrongfulness of 
24 the defendants' act. 
25           In any event, what that means is, is 5364
1 that's why we're telling you about 20 million 
2 deaths, 1200 dead people a year, thousands of 
3 young people taking up smoking every single day, 
4 every single day. 
5           And we know that a substantial 
6 proportion of them are going to become addicted 
7 smokers, that a substantial proportion of them are 
8 going to die.  That's just the truth of it. 
9           So you may consider harm to others.  It 
10 isn't just about Mary.  Mary is not on trial here.  
11 Mary is not the defendant.  Mary is a victim. 
12           Ever heard of the concept blaming the 
13 victim?  Well, Mary is the victim.  She's the 
14 casualty.  She is not on trial here.  
15           Her actions are to be considered by you.  
16 Her relative degree of responsibility is to be 
17 considered by you, but the tobacco companies are 
18 the defendants here.  
19           We are prosecuting them.  They are --
20           MR. PEDROSA:  Objection.  
21           MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- guilty of acting 
22 with intent to hurt people.  
23           MR. DAVIS:  Objection to the criminal 
24 reference, Your Honor.  
25           THE COURT:  Hang on a second.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1           MR. SCHLESINGER:  And the guilty --
2           MR. PEDROSA:  Objection.  There's no 
3 prosecutor.  No one is guilty.  This is a civil 
4 case.
5           THE COURT:  Sustained. 
6           This is not a criminal case.  There is 
7 no prosecution, ladies and gentlemen. 
8           You may continue, Mr. Schlesinger. 
9           MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'll show you the jury 
10 instruction that says you'll determine whether or 
11 not they were guilty of intentionally doing these 
12 wrongful acts, and I say they are guilty of doing 
13 intentional wrongful acts -- 
14           MR. PEDROSA:  Objection.  
15           THE COURT:  Overruled.  
16           MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's in the jury 
17 instruction. 
18           THE COURT:  Overruled.
19           MR. SCHLESINGER:  And I'll read it to 
20 you.  
21           -- that affected people like Mary.  
22 She's a generic smoker. 
23           This is the toll.  I've told you about 
24 that.  One-third of all cancer in the USA is 
25 caused by addiction to nicotine.  Smokers account 5366
1 for one in five deaths.
2           How about if every single cemetery in 
3 the United States, the grieving family members and 
4 their friends go to pay their respects, when you 
5 see those headstones, how about if one in every 
6 five headstones in every single cemetery in United 
7 States had a big "No Smoking" sticker on it for 
8 the 20 percent, the one in five deaths that are 
9 accounted for in this country?  
10           Millions and millions of those stickers.  
11 Think about that because the number is numb.  The 
12 number is numb. 
13           We talk about -- okay.  You know, a 
14 terrible thing happened the other day.  There was 
15 a shooting.  There was a death.  Something bad 
16 happened.  We hear about it.  It's the evening 
17 news.  Scott Pelley, it's the first thing he says, 
18 and we say:  Oh, my God.  That's terrible.
19           MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, if I can object.  
20 To bring that horrible event into this case --
21           MR. SCHLESINGER:  I didn't say any 
22 event.  
23           THE COURT:  I don't know what event 
24 you're talking about.
25           MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'm not talking about 5367
1 an event.
2           THE COURT:  Okay.  Good.  Then stick to 
3 the evidence.
4           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes.
5           I'm just saying, occasionally tragedies 
6 occur that involve the death of some or a few 
7 people, and it ends up on the evening news. 
8           This happens every single week.  I'm not 
9 talking anything specific.  What I'm talking about 
10 is, the number is numb. 
11           The scale of the destruction is so 
12 different when somebody's life or a few people's 
13 lives are lost, it is important to us as 
14 Americans. 
15           It's reported on every channel of the 
16 evening news, and we think about it, and we're 
17 concerned about it, and it starts a national 
18 conversation. 
19           But every single day, over 1300 people 
20 are dying unnecessarily from cigarettes, and no 
21 one is talking about it.  It's hiding in plain 
22 sight. 
23           Thousands of children -- 
24           MR. BELASIC:  Objection, Your Honor.  
25 Fifth time around, a violation of your order. 5368
1           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thousands of youth --
2           MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor -- 
3           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Please.  
4           MR. DAVIS:  -- can you make a ruling 
5 before he keeps going?  
6           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thousands of youth --
7           THE COURT:  Mr. Schlesinger, let him 
8 make an objection, please.
9           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes.
10           THE COURT:  You know the rules.  You 
11 can't just keep talking over everybody because you 
12 want to.  Please don't do that.
13           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, sir.  
14           THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, once 
15 again, that word is not part of this trial.  You 
16 will disregard the lawyer's remarks. 
17           This is the fourth time I have said that 
18 you shall disregard that remark. 
19           Does everybody understand?  
20           THE JURY PANEL:  Yes, Your Honor.  
21           THE COURT:  You may continue, sir.
22           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thousands --
23           MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, we renew our 
24 motions.  
25           MR. BELASIC:  We renew our motions.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1           THE COURT:  The motions are denied.
2           You may continue, sir.
3           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thousands of youth 
4 take up the act of cigarettes every single day. 
5           This is seed corn.  How can I express 
6 something to you in numbers?  Mary grew up in farm 
7 country.  I thought about that.  That's a bushel 
8 of corn.  That's about 72,000 grains of corn. 
9           During our trial, that's about how many 
10 young new smokers tried a cigarette for the first 
11 time. 
12           And we know, from what we've learned in 
13 this courtroom, that a substantial percentage of 
14 them will become lifetime smokers, and half of 
15 them will die.  
16           So these numbers are not -- they're 
17 abstract because they're so large, but they 
18 involve real people, by the millions, real 
19 Americans.  
20           You have to move that because I don't 
21 want to cause an allergy.  
22           In any event, in any event -- that's 
23 heavy, isn't it, Jon?  
24           MR. GDANSKI:  It ain't light.  
25           MR. SCHLESINGER:  In any event, these 5370
1 cigarettes are designed for addiction.  I showed 
2 you this in opening statement.  I won't spend a 
3 lot of time on it. 
4           But one of the things is menthol, 
5 levulinic acid, bronchodilators to get the 
6 nicotine in your lungs, I mean ammonia compounds. 
7           Mary didn't know about any of these.  
8 Most people don't.  They don't think there are any 
9 additives in cigarettes. 
10           They think it's just a leaf rolled up.  
11 It's not.  It's a manufactured process.  They take 
12 the nicotine out.  They put the nicotine back in. 
13           They put in flavorants and chemicals and 
14 chocolates and licorice and theobromine to open up 
15 your lungs so the nicotine can get in better, all 
16 to sustain addiction.
17           MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor, we object to 
18 that last demonstrative.  It's, for a sixth time, 
19 a violation of your order.  We move for a mistrial 
20 again.  
21           THE COURT:  Okay.  I didn't see the 
22 demonstrative, but I sustain the objection if it 
23 did have what I've consistently ruled is not 
24 admissible.  
25           MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is the Belair ad? 5371
1 Play it.  I may stop you.
2           This is that Belair ad.
3           MR. PHILIPSON:  Well, it's a 
4 combination.  
5           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.  Play it.
6           (Video clip played as follows:)
7           VOICE:  Breathe easy, smoke clean with 
8 new Belair.  
9           VOICE:  What cigarette do you smoke?  
10 You'll be interested to know how the doctors of 
11 America answered that question.  Doctors in every 
12 branch of medicine were asked:  What cigarette do 
13 you smoke, Doctor?  
14           VOICE:  Something wonderful happens.  
15           VOICE:  When you change to Philip 
16 Morris, you'll feel better.  
17           VOICE:  Did you say I'll feel better 
18 smoking Philip Morris?  
19           VOICE:  Yes, you will feel better.  
20           VOICE:  (Singing) Don't Miss the Fun of 
21 Smoking, Don't Miss the Fun of Smoking.  
22           VOICE:  Do you inhale?  Then you're 
23 better off smoking Philip Morris, and here's how 
24 you can prove it.  Light up a Philip Morris.  Take 
25 a puff.  Get a good --

1           VOICE:  As cool and as clean as a breath 
2 of fresh air.  
3           VOICE:  Let's take a Winston break.  
4           VOICE:  That's it.  Winston is the one 
5 filtered cigarette that delivers flavor 20 times a 
6 pack.  Winston's got that filter blend.  
7           VOICE:  Yeah, Fred.  
8           VOICE:  Pearl, Winston is good smoking.  
9 Sure wish you could taste it.  
10           VOICE:  I am tasting it, Granny.  
11           (Video clip concluded.)
12           MR. SCHLESINGER:  You know, what's 
13 interesting is, my client saw that. 
14           She said, she testified, a living smoker 
15 in open court, when she took that first cigarette 
16 with her brother, she said -- and she had to fight 
17 back with Mr. Belasic, and I honor her for 
18 standing her ground to say:  Don't put words in my 
19 mouth. 
20           And she can't even get the words out of 
21 her mouth.  There was no air in her mouth.  She 
22 talks with a machine that goes ba, ba. 
23           She sounds like a robot.  She can't go 
24 to a casino because no one can hear her and it's 
25 embarrassing. 5373
1           She can't whisper.  If I want to speak 
2 in a whisper to my client during the trial to tell 
3 me something, she's got to go like this, and she 
4 can't even tell me a secret.
5           MR. BELASIC:  Objection, Your Honor.  
6 You've repeatedly ruled on demonstratives.  He 
7 repeatedly violates your order.  
8           THE COURT:  Mr. Schlesinger, do not use 
9 demonstratives that you did not show to the other 
10 side first.  
11           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Have you seen this 
12 before, Mr. Belasic?  Is the first time you saw it 
13 in the courtroom today?  
14           THE COURT:  Mr. Schlesinger -- 
15           MR. DAVIS:  Objection, Your Honor.  
16 Please --
17           THE COURT:  Mr. Schlesinger --
18           MR. BELASIC:  I'm moving for a mistrial 
19 again, Your Honor.  
20           THE COURT:  Mr. Schlesinger --
21           MR. BELASIC:  This is open contempt of 
22 the court.
23           THE COURT:  -- do not engage in that 
24 behavior, please, in front of me.
25           Continue your argument.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1           MR. BELASIC:  Can I have a ruling on my 
2 mistrial?
3           THE COURT:  Your motion for mistrial is 
4 denied. 
5           Continue with your argument, sir.
6           MR. SCHLESINGER:  She saw this.  Okay.  
7 That's a kid show.  Kids watch it anybody.  
8 Anybody who grew up in that time knows that's 
9 true. 
10           Here are the ads:  Alive with pleasure.  
11 Okay.  Under a Gamma knife for lung cancer, under 
12 surgery, having your lung cut out and having your 
13 throat removed. 
14           They talk about the warnings.  The 
15 warnings were a product of the fraudulent denial 
16 of the information.
17           MR. DAVIS:  Objection, Your Honor.  
18           MR. SCHLESINGER:  They didn't give the 
19 Surgeon General -- they didn't give the Surgeon 
20 General --
21           MR. DAVIS:  Objection, Your Honor.  
22 Express preemption post '69.  
23           MR. SCHLESINGER:  There's no 
24 preemption.  
25           THE COURT:  The objection is overruled. 5375
1           You may continue, sir.
2           MR. SCHLESINGER:  The warnings that they 
3 talk about, like the apple thing you click with 
4 the fine print, that the FTC say are worn out and 
5 never seen, they're not advertising any of that 
6 here. 
7           You've can barely see any of those 
8 warnings, and the warnings were a product of the 
9 fraud and the conspiracy. 
10           And the fact that they were not giving 
11 the proper information to the Surgeon General back 
12 in 1964 when they knew in their own papers it was 
13 addictive, or these things would have been marked 
14 as addictive a long time ago. 
15           And the FTC says:  This is all worn out.  
16 These warnings are ineffective. 
17           That's the defense to the case?  She was 
18 warned.  Nobody is warned by those warnings. 
19           You want to warn somebody, you want to 
20 scare somebody about a pack of cigarettes, put a 
21 picture of a woman with her throat ripped out and 
22 blood all over the pack. 
23           That will scare somebody about the 
24 warning of a pack of cigarettes, but the truth of 
25 tobacco disease is never a part of advertising. 5376
1 It's always the beautiful, healthful -- 
2           MR. DAVIS:  Objection, Your Honor, 
3 please.  Inflammatory.  Express preemption post 
4 '69.  It's right in the instructions.  
5           THE COURT:  Okay.  If it's in --
6           MR. SCHLESINGER:  He already ruled.
7           MR. DAVIS:  Well, it's a new 
8 objection.  
9           THE COURT:  Okay.  Do you-all want me to 
10 be involved in this case, or do you want me to 
11 leave, because I'm happy to do the latter. 
12           The objection is overruled. 
13           Ladies and gentlemen, you'll be guided 
14 by the legal instructions as I gave in this 
15 regard. 
16           Also, Mr. Schlesinger, no inflammatory 
17 remarks about what should be on cigarette packages 
18 that you just described. 
19           You should disregard those remarks, 
20 ladies and gentlemen. 
21           Go ahead, sir.
22           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Camel, they're 
23 advertising -- I showed you the Christmas pack.  
24 Santa Claus is selling cigarettes.  
25           This is what they spend.  I'll come back 5377
1 to it maybe.  Tell me what it is.  
2           They advertise the filter.  You're a 
3 smart person if you use the filter.  The Kent 
4 filters are the best, the scientists, athletes, 
5 everybody. 
6           The message they're putting out has got 
7 nothing to do with that little, tiny warning.  
8 It's got to do with:  It's smoother.  It's 
9 greater, every crazy scientific technical 
10 marketing gimmick, but people believed it.  It 
11 worked.  Their internal documents prove it.  
12           And then -- is this a montage?  No, I'm 
13 going to skip that. 
14           But you saw it, about Marlboro bragging.  
15 Even when they got knocked on TV, they made a 
16 smooth transition to the Marlboro man and the 
17 billboards and how great it was. 
18           It was a great internal ad to motivate 
19 their sales team, the number one selling product 
20 in the world. 
21           More packages of Marlboro sold than 
22 packages of anything else in the history of the 
23 world. 
24           Look at this.  This is what they told 
25 people about filters.  Okay.  We'll say here's our 5378
1 triple, quadruple -- quadruple filter capable of 
2 removing whatever constituents of smoke is 
3 currently suspect, while delivering full flavor 
4 and, incidentally, a nice jolt of nicotine.  And 
5 if we can sustain that, how much money can we 
6 charge for Kent? 
7           Okay.  And they know on Page 20 of the 
8 Surgeon General's report in 2010 -- because we're 
9 learning more now.  We're taking their documents. 
10           We're analyzing them, as Dr. Cummings 
11 says, scientifically and realizing the new designs 
12 were used by the tobacco industry as a tool to 
13 undermine prevention and cessation efforts.  
14           And this is their internal admission.  
15 This is what they say internally in writing:  The 
16 illusion of filtration is as important as the fact 
17 of filtration. 
18           And they say:  The smoker of a filtered 
19 cigarette is getting every much -- as much 
20 nicotine in tar as they would have gotten from a 
21 regular cigarette but had abandon the regular 
22 cigarette on the grounds of reduced risk to 
23 health. 
24           And they want to say:  Well, Mary was 
25 already smoking filters when she started smoking. 5379
1           Yeah.  That was the safer cigarette to 
2 smoke.  She didn't go back to unfiltered 
3 cigarettes.  She smoked what she thought was safer 
4 and continued to smoke them, and, by the way, the 
5 more addictive menthol.  
6           Then FTC explains that the filters were 
7 made -- made people believe it was less hazardous. 
8           And here's what the FTC finally said in 
9 2008, after 1966, when they duped the federal 
10 government into saying on behalf of tobacco:  Hey, 
11 use these filtered cigarettes.  It will reduce the 
12 tar. 
13           So they conned the government, the 
14 federal government, into letting them use the 
15 government's statistics and ratings, saying:  Low 
16 tar, low nicotine, which they advertised like 
17 crazy. 
18           And they used:  The government's lowest 
19 rating, the government's lowest rating.
20           People believe the government.  
21 Mr. Belasic said:  Only three percent of people in 
22 this poll believe what tobacco companies say about 
23 their product.  
24           Well, that's the third-party strategy 
25 you heard about.  They use Harvard professors that 5380
1 they pay off. 
2           They use the government that they fool 
3 to make it seem like somebody credible can be 
4 there helping you. 
5           But here's what's really interesting:  
6 When a tobacco company -- and he used several 
7 polls on this.  It's really interesting to me. 
8           He put up three polls showing:  Who do 
9 you believe on tobacco and health? 
10           And it showed the poll about, these 
11 are -- remember? 
12           And down here was:  Three percent 
13 believe tobacco. 
14           And you come into the courtroom and you 
15 tell the jury 97 percent of people don't believe 
16 what tobacco companies have to say.  
17           And that's going to help you win your 
18 case?  
19           We agree, there are 97 percent 
20 unbelievable.  I agree with Mr. Belasic's poll. 
21           They're not worthy of belief.  They're 
22 not worthy of belief more than three percent. 
23           And there's not enough of you here, 
24 because there are only six of you, out of 97 
25 percent. 5381
1           Then I say:  There's nobody here that 
2 ought to be able to believe anything a tobacco 
3 company has to say. 
4           I don't know why he used that static.  
5 But this was the book, Monograph 2000, and it's 
6 the one that, you'll see the conclusion, said 
7 lights and filters are no better, and, in fact, 
8 may be worse.  They cause deeper inhalation. 
9           And what did they say?  The FTC will not 
10 be a smokescreen for tobacco companies' shameful 
11 marketing practices.  
12           Mary didn't know about that.  That 
13 didn't happen until 2008.  Her throat had been cut 
14 out.  Her lung had been cut out.  Her other lung 
15 had been radiated because she didn't have enough 
16 lung left to breathe. 
17           Who could have paid a bigger price?  Who 
18 else could deserve to be here, to come before you 
19 and say:  I am a living, breathing example of 
20 something that is intolerably indecent done for 
21 money in this country, for pure greed. 
22           They didn't care.  
23           We talked about this.  It's all through 
24 this. 
25           The basis of the business is the high 5382
1 school student.  Younger adult smokers had been 
2 the critical factor in the growth and decline of 
3 every major brand and company over the last 50 
4 years. 
5           And of course they changed the wording.  
6 We showed you the document.  They changed the 
7 wording from "youth" to "young adult," even though 
8 it refers to 12-year-olds, because they knew one 
9 day they'd get caught, and they knew that anything 
10 under an adult isn't somebody they're supposed to 
11 market to. 
12           So they were aware of that, because, 
13 here, these are the documents, and what do they 
14 say? 
15           There's a Chinese proverb that says:  
16 The palest ink is far more vivid than the 
17 brightest memory. 
18           This is what's in writing.  This is what 
19 they wrote internally.  These are their 
20 admissions, right? 
21           Another thing I heard that I think made 
22 sense too:  Documentation trumps conversation.  
23           This is what they wrote.  Imagine what 
24 they said.  Imagine, behind those corporate 
25 offices and in those towers with those chief 5383
1 executives, imagine what they said. 
2           If this is what they wrote, can you 
3 imagine what they said? 
4           So they've talked about it being a 
5 bonanza.  
6           The basis of our business is the high 
7 school student.  
8           And then, again, Teague -- you've got to 
9 read the Teague documents.  He was really quite 
10 the scientist when it came to addicting youth and 
11 addicting people.
12           He understood tobacco really well, how 
13 to get the learners going.  You saw that. 
14           And then:  You have to capture the youth 
15 market if you want to stay in business.  We must 
16 get our share of the youth market.  
17           Realistically, if our company is to 
18 survive and prosper in the long-term, we must get 
19 our share of the youth market.  
20           And here, Claude Teague, and I just got 
21 to -- I've got to slow it down for a second 
22 because this is what Claude Teague talks about in 
23 one of his memorandums from 1972. 
24           And when you look at it, he says:  We 
25 deliberately played down the role of nicotine, 5384
1 hence, the nonsmoker has little or no knowledge of 
2 what satisfaction it may offer him, and no desire 
3 to try it. 
4           Instead, we must convince him with 
5 wholly irrational reasons that he should try 
6 smoking in the hope that he will, for himself, 
7 then discover the real "satisfactions" obtainable.  
8           That is cold-blooded stuff right there.  
9 That is -- that is what it is.  That is what it 
10 is, okay, a simple truth from the inside of a 
11 company doing something that ought to be very, 
12 very different than what we consider to be within 
13 the bounds of human decency.  
14           Punitive damages are a call for a 
15 consideration of quasi-criminal behavior.  That's 
16 the Florida Supreme Court's language. 
17           And when you call for an expression of 
18 moral condemnation, it's because this kind of 
19 intentional conduct, we're going to trick them to 
20 addict them and hook them along and carry them as 
21 customers for a lifetime and when they fall off 
22 and die, replace them, it just doesn't -- it can't 
23 be acceptable. 
24           We don't advertise to children. 
25           That's a lie.  That's a lie.  Full-page 5385
1 advertising that is not truthful, and that is the 
2 word.  Mr. Johnstone doesn't like to use it. 
3           In this case, it is the most applicable 
4 way to describe what tobacco companies have done 
5 to Americans in this country for millions and 
6 millions of deaths and tens of millions of 
7 diseases of sick people.  
8           And going down by tobacco, it's a bad 
9 way to go.  There's nothing peaceful about death 
10 and destruction by tobacco, dying and being sick 
11 of lung cancer or laryngeal cancer or having your 
12 lungs corroded by emphysema. 
13           That is not a nice way to go, and it 
14 costs a lot of money in this country that doesn't 
15 need to be spent because it's a preventable -- 
16 they're all preventable diseases. 
17           And this right here, this is how -- 
18 that's why I showed you the corn, because they 
19 call their clients a crop, and this is right at 
20 the time of Mary.  
21           A backlog of youth who have refrained 
22 from taking up smoking in the face of the 
23 report -- this is in 1965. 
24           Mary is 13 years old.  She's smoking.  
25 This is before the caution goes on and after the 5386
1 Surgeon General's report comes out that Mary paid 
2 no attention to. 
3           And why would a 13-year-old know 
4 anything about a Surgeon General's report or what 
5 it meant or what it meant for her when she was 
6 invincible, and they were worried that the punch 
7 would be lethal because of the Surgeon General's 
8 report. 
9           And in that document, they say:  It was 
10 far less lethal than we expected it to be. 
11           And here's what they say:  A backlog of 
12 youth who have refrained from taking up smoking in 
13 the face of the report. 
14           Well, she was already a smoker. 
15           However -- because they knew that the 
16 cigarettes were rebounding.  All of their 
17 counter-punches to the Surgeon General's reports, 
18 sales were rebounding.  
19           A substantial number of these can be 
20 expected to join with this year's crop of 
21 prospects, a crop. 
22           That's why I showed you the corn.  They 
23 looked at them, and they dehumanized the smokers. 
24           They're just a commodity.  You know, 
25 smokers consume cigarettes.  Cigarette companies 5387
1 consume smokers. 
2           The smokers get burned up just like the 
3 cigarettes, and then they get more. 
4           And they say right here:  Can be 
5 expected to join with this year's crop of 
6 prospects to produce a healthy increase in the 
7 number of new smokers.  
8           Healthy to who?  Healthy to the smokers 
9 who are going to die from it, to the 50 percent of 
10 smokers, one out of every two smokers are going to 
11 get sick and die? 
12           No, healthy to the tobacco companies 
13 because they're persons, remember?  They're 
14 corporate persons with legal rights. 
15           And do you know what their legal rights 
16 are?  They have the legal right to have a survival 
17 instinct, and that's what they've got. 
18           And what flows through the veins of this 
19 corporate person, one thing and one thing only, 
20 green cash.  That's what they care about.  
21           Replacement smokers.  12-year-olds.  
22 Call them replacement smokers.  The only source -- 
23 so you know about that, that's in evidence. 
24           I say that's cold, callous, uncaring, 
25 indecent, inhuman. 5388
1           And then this was one of the ones where 
2 it shows that when you get to a certain part of 
3 smoking, you no longer have free choice.  
4           Down there:  Free to choose.  See:  Free 
5 to choose.  Over to the right, there's a negative 
6 there. 
7           So that was when Claude Teague was 
8 going -- you have the documents in evidence. 
9           Claude Teague went through the 
10 presmoker, the learner, and the confirmed smoke, 
11 another one of the code words for addicted to 
12 nicotine, when the physiological effect takes over 
13 and you're no longer smoking because you want to 
14 be cool, because you're a kid, and you've overcome 
15 the adverse effects of choking when you smoke, 
16 because that's what you do. 
17           The only thing that's supposed to be in 
18 your lungs is air.  You suck in smoke, you choke, 
19 unless you put minty menthol in it. 
20           All youth have tasted mint.  Mint is a 
21 familiar flavor.  It eases inhalation.  It acts as 
22 an anesthetist.  It numbs the throat, and it helps 
23 that inhalation. 
24           Teague went through a whole process of 
25 how you get the presmoker to start, emulate a 5389
1 valuable image, how you get them over the adverse 
2 period of that choking and smoking on those first 
3 few cigarettes. 
4           But then, right there:  Free to choose, 
5 sure, when you're first starting to smoke.  When 
6 you're a confirmed smoker, you get a negative, 
7 because you're no longer free to choose, and they 
8 know it. 
9           This is the FTC again saying:  Kids 
10 don't have the first clue how dangerous it is, and 
11 they smoke.
12           MR. DAVIS:  Objection, Your Honor, to 
13 the statement.  
14           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Youth don't have the 
15 first clue how dangerous it is, and they smoke. 
16           Teenagers take up the smoking habit. 
17           I meant to say:  Teenagers take up the 
18 smoking habit because the health dangers of 
19 cigarette smoking are not brought home to them in 
20 an effective and meaningful way. 
21           Once they start, they may never be able 
22 to stop. 
23           That's what the Federal Trade 
24 Commission, who is in charge of deceptive 
25 advertising, is saying in the '60s. 5390
1           But they can't stop the onslaught 
2 because that 250 million I showed you, tobacco 
3 spent more money in a day on advertising than the 
4 federal government spent in a year getting out its 
5 message. 
6           So 365 to 1 is the spending ratio of 
7 tobacco putting out a message of health and 
8 enjoyment and satisfaction versus 1. 
9           So in one day, the budget is blown, and 
10 tobacco has 364 more days to go to keep telling 
11 you how great it is and how alive with pleasure 
12 and how something wonderful is going to happen 
13 when you start inhaling these toxins in your 
14 lungs.  
15           So this talks about the ineffectiveness 
16 of warnings.  I told you about that.  If you're 
17 not telling the truth to the federal government, 
18 they're not going to put effective warning labels 
19 on anything that's going to warn anybody.  
20           And then this whole thing here is:  We 
21 completely control the nicotine.  That's the 
22 dominant product specification. 
23           It says here:  People can't stop. 
24           Here's a great document by a doctor 
25 named Tamol, another higher-up in the Philip 5391
1 Morris Company. 
2           And he wanted to know -- because when 
3 the light cigarettes were coming, they were afraid 
4 of weaning.  See:  Habituating level of nicotine.  
5 How low can we go? 
6           If you get too low with the tar, maybe 
7 the people will be able to quit because they will 
8 be weaned off the addiction. 
9           They didn't want that to happen.  So 
10 Tamol wanted to determine the minimum nicotine 
11 required to keep the normal smoker hooked, their 
12 word, "hooked."
13           And they said:  If we get rid of 
14 nicotine, we're going to liquidate our business. 
15           And they used levulinic acid to make it 
16 bind to the brain better.  That's an additive to 
17 make it more deadly and dangerous. 
18           And she relied on it because she didn't 
19 know about it, and they concealed it from her, and 
20 she kept smoking, like millions like her.  That's 
21 what reliance is.  
22           Anyway, Jet Lincoln, he speaks the 
23 mantra for the tobacco companies:  Who ain't for 
24 more money?  Who ain't for more money?  Do we 
25 really want to tout cigarette smoke as a drug?  It 5392
1 is, of course, but there are dangerous FDA 
2 implications to this conceptualization going 
3 beyond these walls. 
4           That's in '69, and it isn't until 2009, 
5 40 years, that the FDA has first gotten a right to 
6 do something. 
7           And in Phase II when you check off "yes" 
8 for punitives, we'll tell you everything you need 
9 to know about what's going on today.  
10           And maybe you'll meet a tobacco 
11 representative, and we'll talk to him about what 
12 he's doing to make the world a safer place with 
13 his tobacco products. 
14           That's the next phase, and that's where 
15 we want to be, and that's why I'm here, and that's 
16 the one thing I hope, because we get to talk again 
17 in rebuttal. 
18           And I hope you'll be willing to continue 
19 listening as I'm going at you a hundred miles an 
20 hour. 
21           But talking to you after this part of 
22 the case is what we really want to be able to do 
23 because they deserve punishment. 
24           They're not supposed to like it, but you 
25 guys have a right to exact punishment against 5393
1 them. 
2           They're not supposed to like it.  It's 
3 supposed to hurt.  It's not about compensating 
4 Mary for what happened to her. 
5           And $20 million is a lot of money.  You 
6 may say that's too much.  You may say it's not 
7 enough. 
8           What she went through is unimaginable.  
9 So the amounts are completely up to you.  You can 
10 determine to compensate her in any way you see 
11 fit. 
12           But, in any event, they know if they 
13 lose nicotine, they go out of business overnight, 
14 and that's true in the '60s, the '70s, and the 
15 '80s, into late '82:  We get rid of nicotine, 
16 we're going out of business.  
17           Anyway, they always knew it caused 
18 cancer.  That was in the '50s.  And they lied 
19 about it to the Surgeon General, and they knew 
20 full well it caused cancer.
21           They should have told the truth.  They 
22 said:  We'll stop making it. 
23           If they had spent $250 billion, right, 
24 putting out the message of truth and telling 
25 people how deadly dangerous this is, would Mary be 5394
1 a smoker?  Would anybody be a smoker? 
2           If a quarter billion was spent, rather 
3 than advertising as glamorous and sexy and movie 
4 stars and athletes, if they spent that money on 
5 telling the truth, it's deadly dangerous, no one 
6 over 21 is ever going to get it, it's going to be 
7 a heck of an adult decision because literally 
8 you're playing Russian roulette, slow motion 
9 Russian roulette with three bullets in the gun, 
10 because it's one in two people are going to die. 
11           If they told that truth, would she be a 
12 smoker?  No, she would not be a smoker, not 
13 reasonably, not likely. 
14           That's reliance, and she's part of a 
15 large group of people that would not be smokers, 
16 because they knew it caused cancer, and they could 
17 have stopped making it like they said they were 
18 going to. 
19           If they had told the truth about not 
20 making it, would she be a smoker?  That's 
21 reliance. 
22           And all through here, they know in the 
23 '60s that cigarettes have certain unattractive -- 
24 isn't that an interesting way for a company 
25 concerned about its profits to refer to itself, 5395
1 unattractive side effects.  
2           This is an unattractive side effect, 
3 lung cancer.  It's unattractive.  I don't like the 
4 way it looks.  I don't like the way Mary looks 
5 with her lungs cut out.  That's unattractive. 
6           That's how they describe it because they 
7 don't care about people.  
8           And then all through here:  Let the 
9 scientists do the worrying, and you go on 
10 enjoying. 
11           But what's going to happen if this 
12 cancer scare gets out and one cigarette less a day 
13 is smoked by smokers?  We'll be 40 billion less 
14 smoking a year, and less smoking means less cash, 
15 and we can't -- that's too terrible to think 
16 about.  We can't let that happen. 
17           And here, way back in the '50s:  It's 
18 fortunate for us that cigarettes are a habit they 
19 can't break. 
20           What a great deal, an addictive drug, 
21 but if a person goes and says:  Hey, Bob, I've got 
22 a great idea for a business.  You know, we're 
23 going to sell this stuff, and it's this kind of 
24 pizza, and it's really, really delicious, and it's 
25 so good that people can't stop eating it. 5396
1           They eat ten of them a day.  The only 
2 problem is, after 20 years, it kills them dead.  
3 But we know that, but we're going to make a lot of 
4 money. 
5           Would anyone go in that business? 
6           They talk about, what did Mary do in the 
7 morning, when she was looking in the mirror and 
8 she decided what she would do for the day? 
9           What about the executives?  Were they 
10 looking in the mirror in the morning and saying:  
11 What is our business?  We're devoting a business 
12 career to the propagation of lung cancer?  Is that 
13 appropriate?  Is that proper?  
14           It's not.  So, anyway, this is all the 
15 promises they made.  Every one was a lie. 
16           And The Frank Statement, you heard about 
17 Clarence Cook Little.  The unimpeachable -- the 
18 scientist of unimpeachable integrity and national 
19 repute was the Surgeon General. 
20           And they were trying to -- they were 
21 knocking him down.  You know, I don't know if I 
22 said this already, but if you don't have a leg to 
23 stand on, break the other guy's leg, negative 
24 campaigning. 
25           So they went after the Surgeon General 5397
1 and tried to --
2           MR. PHILIPSON:  Hold on a second.  Hold 
3 on.  Give me one second. 
4           MR. SCHLESINGER:  When you're standing 
5 here talking about 400 words a minute, one second 
6 feels like about an hour and a half, just so you 
7 know.  
8           MR. PHILIPSON:  Go ahead.  
9           MR. SCHLESINGER:  And here's where they 
10 promised to stop making it, and I told you in 
11 opening statement, three different Philip Morris 
12 guys said:  We'll promise to stop making it. 
13           Well, if that promise was truthful, if 
14 they stopped making it, or if they shut things 
15 down for a little while, they interrupted putting 
16 this deadly addictive poison behind the 
17 convenience store counters and the public 
18 supermarkets and everywhere looking colorful and 
19 pretty where people can get it, would Mary have 
20 had a chance to stop smoking?  
21           Could they have helped her?  Was she 
22 entitled to rely on this?  
23           This is what they're saying externally, 
24 when internally these CEOs, chief executives, know 
25 what they're doing is completely false and it's a 5398
1 lie.  
2           Not telling the truth about disease, 
3 here's what they said:  Cancer is in every class 
4 of smoke, and we can't filter it out. 
5           That's what they knew internally, and 
6 what did they give the Surgeon General to help him 
7 get to the truth in 1964? 
8           Oh, there's nothing bad in there, and if 
9 there is, we'll filter it out.  
10           So right there, they got their internal 
11 information.  They know the truth, and then they 
12 give a complete opposite answer to the Surgeon 
13 General, just lied to him. 
14           And then they celebrate how they preempt 
15 the Surgeon General's media event by Institute, 
16 the Tobacco Institute, their front, their shield, 
17 as a first news strike, and they get top billing. 
18           And then their speakers are all over the 
19 airwaves putting out the public message, and I 
20 think Mr. Belasic was trying to suggest:  Why 
21 would Mary have seen any of this?  
22           Because you guys put it on national 
23 news, because you guys did everything you could to 
24 make a wallpaper effect of advertising and make 
25 sure that everybody saw it. 5399
1           Wait a second though.  How about the 
2 shift in justification?  I love this from 
3 Mr. Belasic, who I have a fondness for him, and I 
4 think he's a great lawyer, but I love what he said 
5 about the -- that Mary was negative two when the 
6 such and such came out, so how could she have seen 
7 it? 
8           Okay.  Let's talk about the Reader's 
9 Digest.  The cigarette articles in the Reader's 
10 Digest were in the '30s and '40s. 
11           Mary was negative 10 and negative 20 
12 when that came out.  Did Mary see in 1887 an 
13 article that they found in some dusty stack in 
14 Chicago on something about they found the word 
15 "addiction"? 
16           Do you think these guys have resources 
17 to find a word "addiction" in a dusty old document 
18 in a library somewhere in 1887? 
19           Was she supposed to see that?  She was 
20 negative 60. 
21           Was she supposed to see the Florida 
22 Health Notes in 1906 where some opium den in San 
23 Francisco has got guys making cigar butts out of 
24 opium, and that's the worst form of tobacco 
25 addiction? 5400
1           I have to admit, the 1906 Florida Health 
2 Notes, they were the most popular health notes in 
3 the country at the time.  I mean people were crazy 
4 about those Florida Health Notes.  I'm sure 
5 everyone has seen the Florida Health Notes. 
6           I mean that's shifting justification.  
7 She didn't see The Flintstones.  She didn't see 
8 the men on TV.  She didn't see what was right in 
9 front of her growing up in front of a TV in the 
10 generation when we were all watching TV, but she 
11 saw something in 1887 in a stack in Chicago were 
12 the 1906 Florida Health Notes. 
13           And the Reader's Digest, they were 
14 putting out attacks in their internal documents to 
15 forcefully refute the Reader's Digest. 
16           And the Reader's Digest didn't take 
17 advertising for cigarettes.  So can you imagine 
18 the editors rolling over in their grave seeing the 
19 tobacco companies trying to wear as a badge of 
20 honor what the Reader's Digests were saying? 
21           They were denying it.  The great pivot 
22 in this, the great pivot in this is that all the 
23 way through '94, all the way through '98, they're 
24 lying.  They're denying. 
25           They're saying:  Nobody knows what 5401
1 causes cancer.  It's not addictive.  It's not 
2 dangerous.  Nobody knows.  We need more studies. 
3           And, all of a sudden, in this courtroom, 
4 this huge pivot:  Everybody knows.  Everybody 
5 knows.  Everybody knows. 
6           If everybody knows, why didn't they 
7 know?  Why didn't they know?  
8           Because they were lying. 
9           And then they attacked the Surgeon 
10 General and the public health.  They say:  He's 
11 hoodwinking the public and making unjustified 
12 health scares, and he's insulting, grossly 
13 insulting the scientific community. 
14           And the number one problem is the extent 
15 to which these officials knowingly mislead the 
16 American public.
17           MR. GDANSKI:  You've got to save some 
18 time, Scott.  
19           MR. SCHLESINGER:  I've got to what?
20           MR. GDANSKI:  You've got to save some 
21 time.
22           MR. JOHNSTONE:  You've got to save some 
23 time.
24           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.  
25           Claims that cigarettes are addictive. 5402
1 Irresponsible scare tactics. 
2           They had an antagonist to nicotine back 
3 in 1978.  They were coming up with a way to block 
4 nicotine. 
5           And what did they say?  We're not going 
6 to fund that study.  Do you know why?  If we can 
7 get the progress to block nicotine, come up with a 
8 pill to help people get off nicotine, we'd be in 
9 the process of digging our own graves. 
10           There's no problem digging 20 million 
11 graves but not their graves.  They have a survival 
12 instinct. 
13           And down here:  Subjects to be avoided.  
14 Remember, all the articles, all the information we 
15 gave to the -- the CTR gave to the public health 
16 authority.
17           There was a Nobel prize winner that 
18 submitted an article that had nothing to do with 
19 smoking and health. 
20           Down here:  Subjects to be avoided:  
21 Attempts to relate human disease to smoking. 
22           And a whole thing carefully planning 
23 what they would study so no harm could come to the 
24 industry. 
25           And what did they say?  What is our 5403
1 company?  It's a highly ritualized and stylized 
2 segment of the pharmaceutical industry. 
3           They knew that.  That's quality back in 
4 the '70s.  They knew what business they were in.
5           Now they're under the FDA.  What does 
6 the "D" stand for?  "Drug."  And I don't see 
7 anybody eating cigarettes. 
8           Okay.  That's what cigarettes are.  
9 They're a drug, and it was a secret addiction 
10 unleashed on America with no conscience, 
11 conscienceless, with no conscience.  
12           Skip it. 
13           Anyway, this is the business, the doubt.  
14 You know about that and how great -- the key word 
15 is confusion.  Doubt is our product. 
16           You know why?  I don't know if I said 
17 this.  This is just a pack of lies.  A pack of 
18 cigarettes is a pack of lies. 
19           And they say so themselves:  Doubt is 
20 our product.  All we want to do is confuse.  Give 
21 the smokers a psychological crutch and 
22 self-rationale to continue smoking. 
23           And they gave that to Mary every single 
24 day of her entire life until she smoked a 
25 cigarette outside of Jackson Memorial's Sylvester 5404
1 Cancer Center to go in and get a dehumanizing -- 
2 the voice is what makes us human. 
3           It's what separates us from the animals.  
4 A lawyer standing in front of you speaking as the 
5 voice of a woman without a voice, what higher 
6 calling could there be? 
7           What culmination of a legal career could 
8 be achieved by what I have got the right and honor 
9 to do before you today? 
10           I am so grateful to be able to do it.  I 
11 hope, and I always ask the jurors -- I'm not going 
12 to go into this now.  
13           I hope, and I always ask my jurors, that 
14 when you get to this, the American jury system, 
15 the civil justice system, all it does, it gives 
16 you a chance at justice. 
17           There's no guarantee.  And I say:  Good 
18 luck at arriving at justice, and you do the best 
19 you can. 
20           I won't presume to tell you what you 
21 must do or what you have to write or what you will 
22 write. 
23           I don't make that prediction.  I don't 
24 know.  You're an independent body that has been 
25 here now for weeks doing a duty you said you would 5405
1 do.  
2           Many were called, and few were chosen, 
3 and you were chosen.  So I'll have a little bit of 
4 time to talk to you again. 
5           You'll give the same kind attention to 
6 defense counsel and Mr. Belasic and his 
7 co-defendants, and we'll talk a little more this 
8 afternoon after lunch. 
9           Thanks so much for taking the time.


23           MR. SCHLESINGER:  May it please the Court?
24           Let's get this show on the road and get you
25       guys to where you guys take over and we turn it

1       over to you and you're in charge and you're the
2       boss and we're on your time and we're sitting
3       out here going, what are they doing?
4           First thing you need to know, Dr. Michael
5       Cummings testified that Marlboro cigarettes
6       helped contribute to Mary's cancer, every
7       cigarette, every puff of a cigarette does
8       cellular damage and contributes to causing
9       cancer.  You need to know that and I wanted to
10       let you know that right up front.
11           I also wanted to let you know this is
12       important.  Dr. Shapiro, Dr. Shapiro had a
13       medical record in his chart that said Mary came
14       in with a lump on her neck that was there for
15       four months.  And he said that is the history he
16       took.  Doctors take records.  They're
17       contemporaneous.  There at the time.  Four
18       months.  He had cut through the platysmal muscle
19       to take out that cancer, which was cancer of an
20       unknown primary at the time, and he radiated her
21       neck, which slowed the growth and the
22       recurrence.  All the records say recurrence.
23       All the treating doctors say it was recurrence
24       of laryngeal cancer, that's what it is.
25           Now, when she said four-month history and

1       they tried to say in the deposition Shapiro gave
2       an incorrect answer, during that deposition, and
3       you heard it, they had not shown him his record.
4       He was giving a deposition 12 years or 14 years
5       or 17 years later, and they asked him a general
6       question.  He had no idea how important this
7       contemporaneous record was.  And the lawyers
8       took him out in the hall and said, there's
9       something really important here.  You can't
10       guess and say a couple of months, a few months,
11       the time matters.
12           And you know what, that's a lawyer's
13       obligation on behalf of his client.  And what
14       kind of lawyers would we be if we let them foist
15       a mistake into the record that could confuse
16       you.  It's our obligation to say, wait a second,
17       you're asking him a question 20 years after the
18       fact, he doesn't have the record, you didn't ask
19       the record, you're trying to establish something
20       adverse.  He doesn't know the importance of
21       those dates.
22           Their experts --
23           MR. BELASIC:  Can we approach?
24           THE COURT:  Mr. Schlesinger, please.  When
25       they make an objection -- I know you're

1       passionate, stop to let them make their
2       objection.
3           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Hold my time, Judge.
4           MR. BELASIC:  Intentional misstatement of
5       the record.
6           THE COURT:  Objection is overruled.  No
7       sidebar.
8           Ladies and gentlemen, there's a dispute in
9       the evidence, it's your job to resolve that
10       dispute, okay.  Everybody understand the rules?
11       Very good.
12           MR. SCHLESINGER:  May it please the Court?
13           Remember, their experts were prepped well
14       ahead of time to max -- to work on that date as
15       the legal significance of it.  This lawyer was
16       not given the opportunity to look at his
17       contemporaneous record, and what he did he
18       corrected it and that's what a lawyer is
19       supposed to do.  And any client I represent I
20       would be proud to say I want to make sure we get
21       it right.  And there's the record that existed
22       back at the time in February of '97 in no
23       uncertain terms sends this thing back to the
24       pre-11/'96, which puts her in the class period.
25       And that's what's fair.  So that's important to

1       do.
2           Now, Dr. Fee.  Dr. Fee.  You know, his name
3       suits him, and that's all I'll say about
4       Dr. Fee.  All right.
5           Can I see the picture CPH 030 and CPH 0050
6       really quick?
7           So Mr. -- and one of the things -- here's
8       one of the things I want to read to you, okay.
9       When Dr. Cummings was testifying on August 14th,
10       there was questions about how you have a
11       permanent mark on your brain from addiction.
12       Remember that?  I'm going to tie that into this
13       in a second.  How?  I'm going to do it.
14           He said -- Mr. Belasic asked him, you said
15       imprinting can create a sort of brain or neural
16       memory, right?
17           Yes, right.
18           And imprinting has something to do with what
19       you described as a conditioned response, right?
20       And a whole variety of repetitive behaviors will
21       create imprinting in the brain, correct?
22           Sure.
23           Because what Mr. Belasic was trying to do
24       was take away the significance of nicotine
25       addiction, you know, playing down the nicotine

1       addiction.  Trivializing it endangers teenagers
2       going forward in the future.  That's part of the
3       reason we want a punitive damage consideration
4       here is to deter that conduct, to tell them they
5       shouldn't do that, but the fact is Cummings said
6       the hard mark of addiction is permanent, it
7       leaves a permanent mark.
8           Mr. Belasic was skillfully trying to say,
9       well, there's a lot of things like muscle
10       memory.  And he said, Mr. Belasic, and if you're
11       someone like me who played baseball, you may not
12       have thrown a baseball for a long time, but you
13       still know how to snap off a curve because of
14       muscle memory, right?
15           And that's what Mr. Belasic did to you
16       during his closing statement; he snapped off a
17       curve.  And what does a curve do?  It looks like
18       it's coming at you, then it curves and you miss
19       it because it tricks you and it deceives you.
20           And trying to say that Dr. Weed and the
21       treating doctors in this case had anything other
22       than to say than the most likely medical
23       scientific probable, the greater weight of the
24       evidence -- I don't know where my scales went --
25       the greater weight of the evidence was probably

1       laryngeal cancer recurrence from that November
2       1996 treatment that Dr. Shapiro test about
3       [sic].  And if you want to say they can raise a
4       doubt, doubt is their product.  Is it possible
5       it's something else?  Sure it's possible it's
6       something else.  But what is medically probable?
7       Scientifically more likely than not that this
8       poor woman had that laryngeal cancer, the
9       superficial biopsy on the left side didn't pick
10       it up, Dr. Shapiro came in and told ya, I'm
11       sorry I missed it, I did the best I could.  It
12       happens.  I radiated the area and kept it away
13       for a long time.  And every other treating
14       doctor came in and said it was a recurrence and
15       had it been there all along.  And that's the
16       medical truth in this case, snapping off a curve
17       ball notwithstanding.
18           In addition to that, and I want to put up VS
19       125.  This is an important power -- I got
20       distracted trying to give this to you, but it's
21       an important power you have.  We got a do this
22       now.  Stay on this.
23           Look at this.  She never said she didn't
24       smoke pot.  Smoking pot.  She didn't smoke a
25       pack of pot cigarettes a day for 30 years, okay.

1       Pot is not addictive.  It is a red herring.  I
2       told you, I begged you in opening statement, and
3       I did meet you guys before jury selection, I
4       picked you guys in jury selection, I was there.
5       And I said in opening statement, don't let
6       prejudice, don't let prejudice enter into your
7       verdict in a way that you use evidence for a
8       reason other than what it should be used for.
9       If she really smoked enough dope that that's
10       what caused laryngeal cancer that's worth
11       knowing something about.  But there's only two
12       entities in this courtroom that hurt this woman,
13       the tobacco industry and Mr. Hollingsworth, who
14       she didn't want to talk about, and he said
15       something about pot in 1977.  And then they
16       wanted to draw some conclusion from 1977 to the
17       year 2013 as if that's the kind of pot smoking
18       that she smoked all along.  A man that she was
19       so hurt by she didn't want to talk with him.
20       You could see her react emotionally.
21           So she said she never smoked any pot until
22       she got to Florida.  And she moved to Florida to
23       get away from someone that was hostile to her
24       that showed up 40 years later with them, kindred
25       spirits.  Because no marijuana hurt her, no

1       alcohol ever hurt her.  The only thing that hurt
2       her were cigarettes.
3           And then this business -- and the original
4       pictures are in evidence.  This business about
5       what is that smoke coming out of that vase that
6       Mr. Belasic threw a curve ball at you like
7       there's smoke coming out of the vase.  You look
8       at that, it's a vase, there's no smoke.  I gave
9       you the original and when you look all around
10       that picture it's dated 1986, there's photo
11       damage from aging all around that photo.  You
12       look and you see if there's any smoke coming out
13       of that vase.  It's a vase.  What is he saying,
14       it's something else?  It's a pipe?  A hookah?
15       What is it?  There's nothing on there.  It's a
16       vase, but, oh, let's raise a little doubt about
17       it.
18           Let's look at another picture.  Look at the
19       étagère.
20           Is that what we call those things?  Is that
21       called an étagère?
22           MR. GDANSKI:  Yes.
23           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Look at the étagère.  Oh,
24       guess what Mary collects?  Vases.  There's vases
25       all over, look at the vases.  Maybe they're

1       hookahs.  Maybe she was a hookah collector.
2       Okay?  He can still snap off a curb ball, great.
3       That was an on-the-fly move and he took a chance
4       and he shouldn't have taken that chance, because
5       you take a chance in a courtroom in front of a
6       jury and it's run back to you, you lose
7       credibility.  And we have a thing called falsus
8       in unum falsus in omnibus.  So focus on what's
9       important in this case.
10           Agharkar admitted it was -- nicotine played
11       a role in smoking.  Slide 152, then slide 90
12       after that.
13           Wrong one?  There.
14           One of the reasons Mary Cooper continued to
15       smoke is for nicotine?
16           Yes.
17           Dr. Cummings doesn't come here to make
18       money.  He told you how he donates a proportion
19       of his money.  Dr. Agharkar admitted to earning
20       a half a million a year being a professional
21       expert.  That's a big difference.  But even
22       after hours and hours with this doctor, even
23       Dr. Agharkar said it played a role.  And that's
24       important.
25           And we talked about -- let's talk about

1       the -- we talked about the idea of the members
2       of the class.  And I told you logically,
3       reductio ad absurdum.  Aristotle technique of
4       philosophy and argument and logic, reductio ad
5       absurdum, break it down to its most absurd.
6       Every one of their arguments could be applied to
7       any smoker so that nobody would ever be in the
8       class.  And the class wants all Floridians,
9       many, many, many, many people.
10           And you know Aesop made a fable and it said
11       an old man on the point of death summoned his
12       sons around him to give them some parting
13       advice.  He ordered his servants to bring in a
14       bundle of sticks and said to his eldest son,
15       break it.  The son strained and strained, but
16       with all his efforts was unable to break the
17       bundle.  The other sons also tried, but none of
18       them was successful.  Untie the bundle, said the
19       father, and each of you shall take a stick.  And
20       when they had done so he called out to them, now
21       break.  And each stick was easily broken.  You
22       see my meaning, said the father?
23           We're here with one lady that was a member
24       of a class, a group.  And they said, well, that
25       class action didn't apply to her.  Of course it

1       did.  If she's a member of the class, of course
2       it did, her and everybody in the class.  But
3       here individually is she one stick?  And will
4       you let her break that one stick?  I hope you
5       will not.
6           The montage, slide 90.  We don't know.
7           Oh, yeah, this is one of the power -- I keep
8       trying to get to it, then I get off.
9           Look, real quick.  This is one of the powers
10       you have.  There are regular people like the
11       doctors that came in to testify because they
12       were eye witnesses to the cigarette catastrophe
13       accident that happened in her throat and then
14       tore up her lungs and made her a shell of the
15       woman she is today, okay.  Those are regular
16       witnesses.  And there's a believability
17       instruction for them.  You should believe them.
18       But then there's another kind of a person.  He's
19       called an expert.  And because he supposedly has
20       scholarship and a justification to explain to
21       lay people technical subjects, he gets to be
22       called an expert, but we empower you to consider
23       what that expert is really doing and whether
24       it's meritorious.
25           And if you don't like what he says and you

1       do not believe it, you may accept such opinion
2       testimony, reject it or give it the weight that
3       you [sic] deserve.  Reject it is extra power,
4       extra law been given to you, because when you
5       see an expert like some of the ones they brought
6       in, you take them and three of them, Bennett,
7       Fee and Agharkar, three holes in a bowling ball
8       and you roll them out the door.  And you have
9       the power to do that if you believe that they
10       were not believable.
11           So you don't have to say well, I'm not an
12       expert like them, I have to accept them.  No.
13       You can say, on balance, they were not
14       believable, they were not credible, they were
15       not worthy of belief, they were here for a
16       corrupt purpose and I reject what they say --
17           MR. DAVIS:  Objection.
18           MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- that's the power you
19       have --
20           THE COURT:  Sir, sir.
21           I sustain the objection.
22           Ladies and gentlemen, the word "corrupt
23       purpose" is not part of this trial and it's not
24       part of the legal instructions.  You should
25       disregard and ignore the remark.

1           Continue, sir.
2           MR. SCHLESINGER:  I --
3           MR. BELASIC:  We new our motion.
4           THE COURT:  Your motion is denied and your
5       record is preserved.
6           Keep going, Mr. Schlesinger.
7           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Play it now, please.
8 9 10           VOICE:  Take the controversy about
11       cigarettes.  In the 91st Congress a committee
12       heard testimony by leading experts on smoking
13       and health.  The record shows that many of the
14       country's most respected doctors openly
15       challenged anti-cigarette claims.
16           VOICE:  I have to disagree with you in that
17       we don't know what causes the illness that has
18       been (inaudible).
19           VOICE:  I don't know.  Frankly, I think that
20       smoking may be hazardous, it may not be.
21           VOICE:  Smoking may be hazardous, it may not
22       be.  No one, including TV 7, knows for certain.
23           VOICE:  I'm saying that the science to date
24       and over 100 million dollars of our industry
25       indicates that there is no causal --

1           VOICE:  Cigarette smoking does not cause
2       cancer, yes or no?
3           VOICE:  It is not known whether cigarettes
4       cause cancer.  It has not been causally
5       established.
6           VOICE:  Cigarette smoking, no causal
7       relationship between cigarette smoking and
8       emphysema?
9           VOICE:  Despite all of the research to date
10       there has been no causal link established.
11           VOICE:  And I think it's worth pointing out
12       that all the links that have been established
13       between smoking and certain diseases are based
14       on statistics.  What that means is that the
15       causative relationship has not yet been
16       established.
17           VOICE:  The case is still open.  The jury
18       has not come in.
19           VOICE:  It may not be harmful, you're not
20       convinced?
21           VOICE:  It may be or it may not be, we don't
22       know.
23           VOICE:  Do cigarettes cause cancer?
24           VOICE:  I don't know if they do or not.
25           VOICE:  I'm not in a position to give you a

1       does or does not answer.
2           VOICE:  The medical experts agree that
3       smoking causes emphysema, do you agree?
4           VOICE:  It may.
5           (Video clip concluded.)
6           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Go to the end.
7           MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, while it's down, I
8       wanted to object on the grounds that the
9       conflation of the historical evidence in the
10       defense of this case is violation of due process
11       clause of the United States.
12           THE COURT:  The objection is overruled, sir.
13           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Slide 108 real quick.
14           This is one of the slides they talked about
15       the -- you know, she knew and she knew and
16       everything else.  "Increased awareness of the
17       presence of deleterious substances" -- this is
18       Philip Morris' own human behavior studies.
19       "Increased awareness of the presence of
20       deleterious substances in smoke may dissuade
21       smokers from smoking, but there's strong
22       evidence that the will to smoke is impervious to
23       concerted dissuasive practices."
24           So when you're addicted, when your brain has
25       been rewired permanently and you're dependent on

1       the nicotine in cigarettes, even if you hear
2       it's bad it doesn't mean you're going to be able
3       to quit.  And even if Mary could have tried
4       harder to quit and her human weaknesses were
5       such if you believe she should have tried harder
6       to quit.  And she admitted, maybe I could have
7       tried harder.  That goes in the fault section.
8       That goes in the percentages section.  Right
9       here on the --
10           Can you turn the Elmo on?  This is -- that's
11       it.
12           That's how we hope you will answer the
13       questions on punitive damage as to all of these
14       entities that under the circumstances please
15       state whether you find by clear and convincing
16       evidence that punitive damages are warranted
17       against any of the defendants listed below.
18       They said they're asking for 22 million, they're
19       asking for 22 million, they're asking for 22
20       million.  Mr. Johnstone made a recommendation.
21       You can decide whatever is fair in compensation.
22       22 million dollars to these defendants is not an
23       inordinate amount of money.  It has nothing to
24       do with punishment.
25           MR. DAVIS:  Objection.

1           THE COURT:  The financial wealth of any
2       corporation is not relevant nor is there any
3       evidence of it.  I sustained the objection, but,
4       ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you shall
5       disregard that remark.
6           MR. BELASIC:  We renew our motion, Your
7       Honor.
8           THE COURT:  Your motion is denied.
9           You have about four minutes.
10           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, thank you, Judge.
11           Remember there was a section where they
12       talked about biopsying?  This was a defense
13       opening slide and they said, well, we don't know
14       where this magic cancer is, it could have
15       disappeared, must not have been in the larynx,
16       it must have been somewhere else, could have
17       been somewhere else.  Where else was it?  It was
18       in the larynx.  It was right next to the larynx,
19       it was in the -- it was in the lymph node and it
20       showed up and it was radiated and showed up.
21       And they're like, well, anywhere but there,
22       anywhere but where it's going to put her in the
23       class.  And what do they say?  The nasopharynx,
24       the base of the tongue, the tonsils, the
25       pyriform sinus were not biopsied.

1           Now give me the record, please.
2           Mary ain't got no tonsils.  Okay.  When she
3       was a little girl her tonsils were removed.  So
4       that shows -- show another record.  There's 20
5       records.  There's dozens.  Every record, there's
6       a record her tonsils were removed.  And they put
7       an expert saying, maybe there was a cancer in
8       her tonsils and they didn't biopsy there.  And
9       that man made, what, $100,000?  And you think
10       for $100,000 at 500 bucks an hour you ought to
11       read the record.  And before you give an opinion
12       saying maybe there was a cancer somewhere else,
13       like where, Dr. Fee, Dr. Where's-My-Fee,
14       Dr. Can-I-get-some-more-fee, Dr. Did-I-
15       earn-enough-fee, Dr. The-only-
16       thing-that-matters-to-me-is-my-fee --
17           MR. DAVIS:  I'm going to object --
18           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Do you think he would have
19       read the record --
20           THE COURT:  Mr. Schlesinger.
21           MR. DAVIS:  -- improper argument.
22           THE COURT:  The objection is overruled.
23           You may continue, sir.
24           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Do you think he should
25       have taken the time for that price and put in

1       the effort and energy to see in the multiple
2       locations that Mary's tonsils were removed.  So
3       that undermines his opinion and it also shows he
4       isn't it a thorough, careful expert.  He isn't
5       here trying to tell you like it is.
6           There's one thing very important I want to
7       tell you about Mary.
8           THE COURT:  Two minutes.
9           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Here's the difference
10       between tobacco and regular people, the tobacco
11       industry and regular people.  George Orwell
12       wrote a great book, 1984.  It was made into a
13       film.  It was made into a film more than once.
14       One of the films starred Richard Burton and John
15       Hurt.  You may not have ever seen the film.
16       Richard Burton in his day was one of the great
17       actors, and John Hurt was a terrific actor.
18           One of the lines in the book, because it was
19       about an all-powerful force, and tobacco, you've
20       seen evidence, they're very powerful.  One of
21       the lines was, "Ignorance is strength."  That
22       was one of the mottos of the party.  Ignorance
23       is strength.
24           The counter quote to that --
25           I want to say Bacon.  I might not be right.

1       Is it Bacon, Crane?
2           -- is "Knowledge is power."  What we've
3       given to you today is the power of knowledge.
4       The power of knowledge to understand that
5       they've worked and made billions because
6       ignorance is strength.
7           And here's the last thing I want to read to
8       you.  This is from George Orwell.  And if you'd
9       ever seen the movie, Richard Burton, who
10       represents the party, the powerful entity, the
11       oligarchy, he's leaning over John Hurt, who he's
12       getting ready to torture, and he whispers to
13       him, he says, "Winston, you must stop imagining
14       that posterity will vindicate you.  Posterity
15       will never hear of you.  You will be lifted
16       clean out from the stream of history.  We shall
17       turn you into a gas and pour you into the
18       stratosphere."
19           MR. BELASIC:  Objection, Your Honor.  It's
20       inflammatory.  It's not a totalitarian
21       government.
22           THE COURT:  Finish your remarks, sir.
23           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thank you.
24           "We shall turn you into a gas and pour you
25       into the stratosphere.  Nothing will remain of

1       you, not a name in a register, not a memory in a
2       living brain.  You will have been annihilated in
3       the past as well as in the future.  You will
4       never have existed."
5           And I ask you to think of those words and
6       indelibly mark a recognition that the justice
7       due Mary Cooper will make her someone that is
8       remembered and will not be forgotten.
9           And, again, I say thank you for your time.
10       I wish you the best of luck in arriving at a
11       just verdict in this case.
