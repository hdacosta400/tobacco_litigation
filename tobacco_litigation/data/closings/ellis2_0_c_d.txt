11          MR. GEISE:  May it please the Court?
12          THE COURT:  Yes, sir.
13          MR. GEISE:  Ms. Shamp, Ms. Bryan, Mr. Ellis.
14          Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
15          THE JURORS:  Good afternoon.
16          MR. GEISE:  I think when we met three weeks
17     ago, I had a similar spot to introduce myself and
18     that was right after lunch.  So it's after lunch
19     again.  I'm hoping you didn't fill up on a lot of
20     food and you're going to fall asleep on me because I
21     do have a few things to say today, and I'm going to
22     be up here probably longer than you want me to be.
23     But I think they're important things to say, and I'm
24     going to take my time talking about the case.  So I
25     ask you once again for your time and your attention 3623
1     and your patience while I address you.
2          And once again, it's not only after lunch, but
3     it's the bottom of an inning.  And once again, I
4     want to thank you for your service.  As I said in
5     voir dire, as I said in opening, we could not have a
6     jury trial without a jury.
7          The lawyers, we have to be here.  We -- we
8     choose to do this for a living.  Mr. Ellis is here
9     because he chose to file this lawsuit.  But you
10     didn't choose to do this.  We chose you to do this.
11     And there are a lot of ways in this country that
12     people can contribute.
13          On the eve of September 11, I think we think of
14     the first responders and the people serving in the
15     military as really paying that highest price.  Many
16     of us vote on election day, as it was a couple weeks
17     ago during voir dire.
18          In the past three weeks, you have done your
19     duty of serving on a jury.  So whatever you decide,
20     whatever the verdict, you can go home to your
21     friends, to your family and to your co-workers, and
22     you can feel proud that you've helped make this
23     country work because you have.
24          And for the three weeks that you have dedicated
25     to this process, by being here, by paying attention, 3624
1     by taking notes, by asking questions, we thank you.
2     On behalf of myself, my client and my team, we thank
3     you.
4          When this case started two weeks ago, I told
5     you that this case is not about other smokers.  It's
6     only about Betty Owens.  And in particular, this
7     case is about the choices she made when it came to
8     smoking.  As this case now comes to a close, that's
9     what it's still about.  And, yes, I am going to talk
10     about Betty Owens today.  I'm going to talk about
11     her a lot.
12          Two weeks ago, I told you that you would hear
13     an avalanche of information and testimony about
14     things that had nothing to do with Betty Owens.  And
15     you sure did.  In fact, you heard about some of
16     those things again today, things that Judge Norton
17     said had already been resolved in that other lawsuit
18     in the findings, things that I told you in my
19     opening statement weren't an issue and were not
20     going to be issue.
21          Dr. Burns and Dr. Wright spent a lot of time
22     telling you that smoking causes lung cancer.  You
23     heard that from Judge Norton and from me on day one.
24     It wasn't an issue then.  It's not an issue now.
25          Dr. Werner and Dr. Burns told you that 3625
1     cigarette smoking is addictive.  You heard that from
2     Judge Norton and from me on day one of this trial.
3     It wasn't issue an then.  It's not an issue now.
4          And this case isn't about whether cigarettes
5     should be or are legal.  They are.  They're legal to
6     make.  They're legal to advertise and they're legal
7     to sell.  And in this case, you heard that Reynolds
8     manufactured, advertised and sold cigarettes, all
9     legal acts.  You can look at Page 18 of your jury
10     instructions.  It'll tell you that.
11          And cigarettes are also legal to smoke.
12     Everyone has the right to smoke or not smoke.  And
13     smokers like Mrs. Owens made the choice to smoke
14     cigarettes, all legal acts.
15          You may recall in my opening statement that I
16     told you that the plaintiff had the burden of proof
17     and needed to provide all the pieces to the puzzle.
18     In my closing argument, we're going to look at the
19     pieces that Mr. Ellis failed to provide, and in
20     addition, the pieces they offered that just don't
21     fit this case.
22          I also told you you would hear two sides of the
23     story, the two sides about who Betty Owens was.
24     Now, the plaintiff tried to tell you that Betty
25     Owens was a weak, naive, uneducated woman who was 3626
1     unaware of the risks of smoking and unable to stop
2     smoking.
3          We provided evidence that paints a different
4     picture of Mrs. Owens, a picture of a -- of a
5     woman who faced adult matters from a very young age,
6     made adult decisions from a very young age, but used
7     her determination to overcome personal hardships in
8     her life to support a family and have a life of her
9     own.
10          And it was also a picture of a woman who was
11     repeatedly told about the risks of smoking, but was
12     never interested in quitting because she enjoyed
13     smoking and she wanted to continue smoking.
14          And I also told you in my opening statement
15     that the plaintiff would only tell you half of the
16     story, and you would probably have to wait until we
17     asked questions into our case to hear the whole
18     story.
19          And the plaintiff did just that.  It started
20     with their first witness, Dr. Proctor.  Now, you may
21     remember him.  He's the $2 million man who had that
22     travel plan Mr. Carter took him through that's
23     already seen dozens of trials this year, including
24     five in the month of August.
25          And when he took the stand, he started by 3627
1     telling you about -- you remember the rocks falling
2     from the sky and things from the cosmos.  And he
3     said -- he was talking about something called the
4     celestial realm of the fifth essence.  I have no
5     idea what that means.  I didn't know then; I don't
6     know now.
7          But Dr. Proctor also said that one of his
8     specialties was "the history of ignorance."  And I
9     thought that was pretty telling because when it came
10     to Betty Owens, ignorance was right up Dr. Proctor's
11     alley.  He was completely ignorant of any and all
12     facts about Betty Owens.  You recall Mr. Carter
13     walked him through things he didn't know.
14          "As a result, you have no opinion for this jury
15     as to why Mrs. Owens began smoking, correct.
16          "That's right.  I don't have an opinion about
17     her biography one way or the other.
18          "That includes not having any information about
19     whether she ever tried to quit smoking?
20          "That's right.
21          "You don't have any understanding as to why she
22     chose any particular brand of cigarettes, do you?
23          "That's right.  As I said, I don't have any
24     biographical information about her in general."
25          That's Dr. Proctor. 3628
1          The second live witness you heard was
2     Dr. Goldberg.  But just like Dr. Proctor, he
3     couldn't tell you anything about Mrs. Owens either.
4          "So with respect to specific advertising, you
5     can't identify any specific advertising campaign for
6     any brand of cigarettes that Mrs. Owens, in fact,
7     saw, read or heard at any point in time, correct?
8          "That's correct.
9          "And you can't identify any specific statement
10     from the tobacco industry that Mrs. Owens, as an
11     individual, in fact, heard, read or saw, correct?
12          "That's correct."
13          But saying nothing at all might be better than
14     just saying half the story.  How many times did we
15     have to show the rest of the story with Dr. Proctor
16     and Dr. Goldberg?  They would plant the seed with
17     you on direct examination and wait to see if we
18     would bring out the whole story on cross.
19          Ms. Shamp showed you the Winston ad with The
20     Flintstones twice in her opening statement, and
21     Dr. Goldberg mentioned it during his direct exam.
22     It's just planting a seed that Reynolds had
23     advertised with cartoons and focused on kid shows.
24     I called this half story in opening statement.  I
25     told you they were going to do it and by golly, they 3629
1     did it.
2          So on cross, you had to learn the other side of
3     the story.  You learned that The Flintstones were
4     originally an adult comedy, modeled after The
5     Honeymooners.  And it aired in the evening, not
6     Saturday morning.  And that The Flintstones were
7     cosponsored by Alka Seltzer and One A Day vitamins,
8     hardly targeted at kids.  We showed you the ad for
9     Alka Seltzer and One A Day.
10          And you also learned Reynolds never advertised
11     on the show when it moved to mornings.
12          Now, Dr. Goldberg didn't know either one of
13     those facts, or if he did, he just didn't share them
14     with you.  So we had to show you and him the other
15     side of the story.
16          And one other part of that story that relates
17     to Betty Owens, you heard that she was a grown
18     woman, on her second marriage and had already raised
19     three kids by the time The Flintstones debuted.  And
20     the last part of the story they didn't share, there
21     was no evidence in this courtroom that she ever saw
22     or watched The Flintstones or saw that ad.
23          Another half story, Teague, '53, one of the
24     first documents that Ms. Shamp showed you in
25     opening, one of the first documents she showed you 3630
1     today.  She told you that Dr. Teague did a research
2     project and found all of this information about
3     cigarettes and that Reynolds didn't make that
4     research public.
5          But on cross, you heard that all 78 articles
6     cited by Dr. Teague were publicly available.  Now,
7     Dr. Proctor said, well, some of them were in German,
8     so he had to work a little harder to find those.
9     Well, Dr. Teague shouldn't be criticized for doing a
10     thorough job on his research paper.
11          Another example of telling you only half the
12     story is about internal company research on
13     nicotine.  They suggested during Dr. Proctor's
14     examination and again today that this research was
15     done to find a level of nicotine -- nicotine to keep
16     smokers addicted or that the pH level was adjusted
17     in a way to drive market share.  Do you remember
18     that?
19          Again, on cross, and through cross of
20     Dr. Proctor and through Dr. Figlar's testimony, you
21     heard the other side of the story.  The research was
22     done at the urging of the public health authorities
23     in conjunction with the NCI with their Tobacco
24     Working Group that was looking to find a less
25     hazardous cigarette and that it was at the 3631
1     instigation of the Surgeon General to do that as
2     well.  And you also saw that later studies showed
3     that there was no connection between pH and market
4     share.
5          Ms. Shamp calls it nicotine manipulation.  But
6     the NCI called it progress.  Dr. Proctor didn't tell
7     you any of that on direct.
8          Dr. Burns, Dr. Proctor, Dr. Goldberg showed you
9     lots of memos from bench level scientists and other
10     people at Reynolds, but they failed to show you this
11     one.  This is from the president of R. J. Reynolds
12     to the head of R&D in 1968.  And what did it say
13     that the plaintiff's experts didn't tell you?  "In
14     cooperation with others, you should push the work
15     concerning tobacco and health.  You should prepare a
16     plan to foster any relationship with government
17     personnel in the quest for mutual understanding of
18     facts, ultimately to gain their cooperation in
19     proper research of the subject.  If there is a safer
20     cigarette, let's continue and increase our efforts
21     in this program.  Please prepare a plan to carry it
22     out."
23          This wasn't a memo that was prepared to be a
24     trial exhibit.  It was a directive to continue,
25     which means the work had already started, and to 3632
1     increase their efforts to develop a safer cigarette.
2     And you heard from Dr. Figlar about those efforts.
3          Dr. Burns, Dr. Proctor, Dr. Goldberg, they knew
4     about this document, but they kept it from you.
5          Why did you have to wait for cross examination
6     or for our witnesses to get the full story, the side
7     the plaintiff didn't tell you?  Why?  The answer is
8     simple, to get you mad, to upset you.
9          The first three witnesses had three things in
10     common.  They were here to reprove the findings that
11     don't need to be reproven and get you mad.  They
12     couldn't and didn't say a single word about
13     Mrs. Owens.  And, finally, they each became
14     millionaires testifying in cases against the tobacco
15     companies.
16          Those three weren't here to offer a single
17     opinion about Mrs. Owens.  In fact, they couldn't.
18     They were here to get you mad so that you would
19     decide this case based on emotion rather than on the
20     facts of the case of Betty Owens.
21          Because if you focus on the facts of Betty
22     Owens, unlike these three, Mr. Ellis loses.  He
23     loses because he can't meet his burden of proof that
24     Mrs. Owens' adenocarcinoma was caused by smoke.  He
25     loses because Betty Owens wasn't addicted.  She 3633
1     maintained control over her smoking choices and
2     smoked because she enjoyed it, never expressed an
3     interest in quitting and was not motivated to quit.
4          And he loses because any addiction Mrs. Owens
5     had wasn't the legal and substantial cause of her
6     injury.  Instead, her adult choice to do what she
7     wanted to do was the legal cause of her actions and
8     whatever consequences came from them.
9          Finally, Mr. Ellis loses because he can't prove
10     a link between anything Reynolds said or did and any
11     smoking decision made by Mrs. Owens.
12          I showed you this slide in opening.  And it's
13     the burdens that the plaintiff has to meet in this
14     case.  And Ms. Shamp identified these three in her
15     closing argument to you today.  And as I said in
16     opening statement, the plaintiff has the burden of
17     proof.  It was true then and it is true now.
18          And -- and let me tell you something about the
19     burden of proof.  Ms. Shamp tried to suggest it's
20     just a tipping of the scales.  It isn't.  It isn't.
21     It's not a comparison of how many pieces do you have
22     here versus how many documents over here?  That's
23     not how it works.
24          If you look at your jury instructions, when you
25     go back to deliberate, on Page 4, it tells you that 3634
1     the greater weight of the evidence means the more
2     persuasive and convincing force and effect.  It
3     doesn't talk about a scale.  It doesn't talk about a
4     tally.  It doesn't talk about size.
5          And when you look at the burden of proof and
6     you consider the evidence, consider what you saw,
7     but consider what they couldn't show you.  I don't
8     know how you weigh missing evidence, but you need to
9     consider it in this case.
10          If Mr. Owens fails -- or Mr. Ellis fails to
11     prove that Mrs. Owens' adenocarcinoma was caused by
12     smoking, he loses.  But if he meets that burden, he
13     also has to prove that she was addicted.  And if he
14     meets that, that her addiction was a legal cause of
15     her death, not other factors, such as her choice to
16     smoke in the face of multiple warnings and constant
17     hounding from her children because she did what she
18     wanted to do.
19          These three burdens are all contained in that
20     first question on your verdict form.  All three are
21     separate hurdles.  All three are separate burdens.
22     If the plaintiff fails to meet his burden on any one
23     of those issues, he fails to prove his entire case.
24     In order to check -- check yes on that first
25     question, the plaintiff needs to clear all three 3635
1     hurdles by the greater weight of the evidence.
2          And one by one, I will address each of those
3     burdens and show you why the answer to that question
4     should be no.
5          Now, in my opening statement, I said there
6     would be no dispute that Mrs. Owens had lung cancer
7     and was a smoker.  That's not in dispute.  But I
8     told you that the plaintiff would not be able to
9     meet his burden of proof because the available
10     medical evidence is scant, and important pieces of
11     the medical puzzle are missing altogether.  And I
12     asked you to hold the plaintiff to its burden of
13     proof instead of jumping to that knee-jerk reaction
14     that anytime a smoker gets lung cancer that it has
15     to be caused by smoking.
16          Now, instead of hearing from any doctor whoever
17     met, saw or treated Mrs. Owens, you heard from
18     Dr. Wright.  Dr. Wright's another professional
19     witness.  He's testified over 1600 times, most often
20     in cases involving electrocutions.  He gets 100
21     percent of his income from litigation.  And he said
22     he stopped treating patients to be a full-time
23     expert because he didn't like sharing his money with
24     his hospital.  That's who they brought to talk to
25     you, not her doctors, but Dr. Wright. 3636
1          And Dr. Wright told you that this case was
2     aberrant.  It was abnormal.  It was unusual.  He
3     told you the records were scant.  He admitted that
4     he had just a few smattering of things, hardly any
5     medical records, and he said everything appears to
6     be basically gone.  That's what he had.
7          He admitted that the gold standard for
8     diagnosing cancer is tissue analysis, but then he
9     couldn't meet that standard because there was no
10     tissue for him to analyze.  That was just one
11     missing piece for Dr. Wright.  There were others --
12     no pathology, no pathology reports, no tissue from
13     the bronchoscopy, the lobectomy or the wedge
14     resection -- resection, no radiology, no films and
15     no autopsy.
16          With all of the pieces missing, Dr. Wright
17     couldn't do an independent evaluation and couldn't
18     put the puzzle together himself.  He told you that.
19     So what he did is he had to take the word of another
20     doctor that Mrs. Owens had adenocarcinoma.  But he
21     never tried to get a word in with that doctor.  He
22     told you he didn't bother to try to talk to her
23     doctors.
24          Now, the words that those doctors did use in
25     the scant records we do have are pretty telling. 3637
1     Dr. Wright was asked this.  Okay?
2          "Regardless, there's no indication here on the
3     death certificate that Ms. Owens' lung cancer was
4     caused by tobacco or smoking cigarettes?
5          "Correct.
6          The medical records here which were filled out
7     by Ms. Owens' treating physicians also don't report
8     on the cause of her lung cancer being smoking or
9     tobacco?
10          "No.
11          "And similarly, none of the medical records
12     list adenocarcinoma secondary to or caused by
13     smoking?
14          "Correct."
15          So the only word you had in this case linking
16     Mrs. Owens' adenocarcinoma to cigarette smoking
17     comes from Dr. Wright.
18          And you might recall, Dr. Wright was asked in
19     his deposition, did he think that the medical
20     records at some point referred to Mrs. Owens having
21     small cell cancer.  You might remember that.  And on
22     the stand, he said, yeah, that's what I believed at
23     the time; I was wrong.
24          Dr. Wright was wrong on other things too.  To
25     link Mrs. Owens' adenocarcinoma to her smoking, he 3638
1     said he had to base his opinions on epidemiology.
2     But look at what he said about epidemiology and his
3     experience.
4          "Now, you don't have a degree in epidemiology?
5          "No.
6          "You talked about your board certifications.
7     You're not board-certified in the field of
8     epidemiology?
9          "I am not.
10          "You've not published on the topic of
11     epidemiology?
12          "I've published in epidemiology.
13          "Have you published on the epidemiology of
14     cancer?
15          "No, just gunshot wounds.  Gunshot wounds."
16          So as a result, Dr. Wright had to admit this.
17          "So today, do you believe yourself to be an
18     epidemiologist in cancer?
19          "No."
20          And this case involves cancer, specifically
21     Mrs. Owens' cancer.  It doesn't involve gunshot
22     wounds.
23          So despite a complete lack of expertise and
24     with only scant records, Dr. Wright told you that
25     Mrs. Owens' adenocarcinoma was caused by smoking. 3639
1     But you know the opinion he tried to tell you is
2     directly contrary to an opinion he offered in a
3     different case just a couple years ago when he said
4     this.  He was asked, about his transcript in that
5     other deposition:  "What types of cancers are
6     associated with lung cancer?
7          "Answer:  Squamous cell, small cell,
8     undifferentiated and large cell too.  Adeno, close
9     call."
10          The next question:  "When you say close call,
11     you mean you don't believe there's sufficient
12     evidence to link smoking?"
13          His answer:  "I don't.  Some people may.
14     Adeno, it's pretty not clear.  To me, it is not
15     clear.
16          "Was that your testimony in November?
17          "That was my testimony."
18          That was his testimony then.  Which was the
19     truth, his testimony then or his testimony to you?
20     Is this something else that he must have believed at
21     the time, but was wrong about?
22          And Ms. Shamp will criticize R. J. Reynolds for
23     not saying until 2000 that smoking caused lung
24     cancer.  This was 2012 for their expert.
25          Now, not surprisingly, Dr. Wright, when he 3640
1     comes in here to testify, admits he was previously
2     wrong when he needs to for purposes of his opinion
3     in this case.
4          Ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day,
5     there are too many missing pieces for Mr. Ellis to
6     satisfy his burden of proving his mother's
7     adenocarcinoma was caused by smoking by the greater
8     weight of the evidence.  The tissue and records that
9     would allow you to prove that are missing.  The
10     records we have don't say anything about smoking
11     being the cause of adenocarcinoma, of her
12     adenocarcinoma.  And Dr. Wright lacks the expertise
13     to offer an opinion about the cause of her cancer,
14     and, more importantly, lacks the credibility to do
15     so since he testified exactly the opposite in a
16     different case when a different opinion was called
17     for.
18          For all these reasons, the plaintiff fails to
19     meet his burden of proof of cause -- of -- of
20     proving what caused Mrs. Owens' adenocarcinoma and
21     death.  And for that reason, the answer to Question
22     Number 1 should be no.
23          Now, if you move beyond that, you move into the
24     question of addiction.  And you'll need to decide
25     what addiction means in this case.  The Court will 3641
1     not define it for you.  We went through the jury
2     instructions.  There's not an instruction on what
3     addiction means.
4          Ms. Shamp asked, where is the evidence that she
5     was not addicted?  I'm going to talk about the
6     evidence that showed that she was not addicted.
7          First, you heard from Dr. Hayes and Dr. Werner.
8     There is no medical record from any doctor who
9     treated Mrs. Owens that reveals a diagnosis of
10     addiction, of dependence, of tobacco use disorder,
11     nothing.  I don't know what you do with that.  You
12     can't put that on a scale because it doesn't exist.
13     It's a burden they have that they can't prove.
14          And you heard that people who are addicted
15     experience a loss of control and become
16     significantly impaired and distressed.  Mrs. Owens
17     had the ability to control her smoking and you saw
18     evidence of that.  Martha didn't allow smoking in
19     her house and her mom complied.  Mr. Ellis didn't
20     allow smoking, she respected his wishes.  He didn't
21     allow smoking in his car, she didn't.  Both Martha
22     and Ken didn't want her smoking around their kids,
23     she didn't.  She went to Baptist services every
24     Sunday, you couldn't smoke at church, she didn't.
25          I told you in opening statements you'd hear 3642
1     some simple facts about nicotine and nicotine
2     addiction, and you did.  Nicotine addiction does not
3     permanently change brain receptors.  It doesn't.  It
4     doesn't interfere with a smoker's ability to
5     understand the risks of smoking.  It doesn't
6     interfere with the smoker's ability to make a choice
7     to quit or to make a choice to continue smoking.
8     And it doesn't prevent a smoker from quitting.  Any
9     smoker can quit.  Everybody agreed to that --
10     Dr. Burns, Dr. Werner, Dr. Hayes.
11          On cross examination, even Dr. Werner admitted
12     that millions of smokers, over 60 million smokers,
13     have quit smoking and millions of them were addicted
14     and yet they were able to stop for good.
15          I want to talk a little bit about DSM-5.  Both
16     Dr. Werner and Dr. Hayes talked about it yesterday.
17     Ms. Shamp said in her closing -- I wrote down -- she
18     said, DSM-5 is the book; it's the book.  Well,
19     oddly, despite using it, Dr. Werner doesn't think
20     that the book is authoritative.  You remember I
21     asked her that question yesterday, I believe.
22          And -- and her back story on DSM-5 is
23     interesting.  First, she has never, never used DSM-5
24     to treat one of her own patients, never.  She only
25     uses it for litigation.  And then she explains why 3643
1     she can't use it in her practice by saying, it's
2     impossible.  And remember, you she said those
3     diagnostic codes, the ICD codes, are different from
4     DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5.  But -- but you saw the truth
5     yesterday.  I showed you the DSM-IV-TR and I showed
6     you the DSM-5.  And I don't know if you'll remember,
7     but the code in both of them is 305.1.  It's the
8     same code.
9          And I showed you where the American Psychiatric
10     Association told practitioners to use the DSM-5
11     immediately, and that's when it came out, in the
12     spring of 2013.
13          Leaving that aside, what does the book say
14     about addiction?  The book, DSM-5, says that 50
15     percent of daily smokers are addicted.  So that
16     means 50 percent of daily smokers are not addicted.
17          Now, in her rebuttal, Ms. Shamp may come back
18     and say, well, let's go back and look at an earlier
19     version or let's go back to this one.  Let's not
20     look at the new -- the book, the DSM-5.  Let's not
21     look at that.  Let's base it on something else.
22     Look, the earth is not flat.  You can base your
23     decision in this case on the current thing, the book
24     that both addiction experts in this case used.
25          Now, Dr. Werner agreed that different mental 3644
1     health professionals can look at the same set of
2     facts and apply DSM-5 and reach different opinions.
3     And she said each professional has to apply their
4     own critical judgment based on their experience,
5     their background and their training.
6          Now, after telling you that DSM-5 can't be used
7     as a cookbook, Dr. Werner did exactly that with
8     Ms. Shamp, and Ms. Shamp showed you it again today.
9     They put up a list of things.  They check the boxes
10     and say, that's what it adds up to; it must mean
11     addiction.
12          Well, first of all, even though I questioned
13     Dr. Werner on this, you remember the -- the
14     checklist that -- that they used where it said,
15     DSM-5, addiction?  DSM-5 doesn't have a diagnosis of
16     addiction.  It has tobacco use disorder.  But never
17     mind.  Set that aside.
18          The second step in using this cookbook is
19     Dr. Werner misapplied it.  The DSM says right up
20     front that you must look for clinically significant
21     impairment or distress.  And I don't recall
22     Dr. Werner telling you that Mrs. Owens was
23     clinically significant impaired or distressed.
24          Now, in her closing argument today, Ms. Shamp
25     said that Dr. Hayes never told you why Mrs. Owens 3645
1     was not addicted.  So she may not have been
2     listening when Mr. Carter put Dr. Hayes on direct,
3     when she walked through the reasons she said that.
4     But she also wasn't listening to the question from
5     one of you.  And I don't know which one of you asked
6     it, but in your questions to Dr. Hayes, one of you
7     asked, explain how you came to your conclusion.  And
8     she did.  She told you that Mrs. Owens was not
9     distressed.  She was not impaired, she retained the
10     choice to smoke, and she didn't make the choice to
11     stop.
12          Dr. Hayes used her experience, her background
13     and her training, and she told you that Mrs. Owens
14     was not clinically significantly impaired or
15     distressed and she told you why.
16          Now, in addition, when Dr. Werner walks through
17     the cookbook and tries to pick it off, she didn't
18     even follow the recipe correctly.  You remember, in
19     DSM, it says, you've got to look for those criteria
20     in the same 12-month period?  Well, Dr. Werner
21     picked something from the '60s, something from '80s,
22     something from the '90s and tried to mix it
23     altogether.  It doesn't work that way.
24          And moreover, Dr. Werner admitted this.
25          "And, in fact, Ms. Owens would say that she 3646
1     enjoyed smoking.  It relaxed her and she liked to
2     smoke, correct?
3          "Yes."
4          Choosing to do something you enjoy is not a
5     sign of significant impairment or distress.  Doing
6     what you want to do is not a disorder.  It's a
7     decision.  And Betty Owens had the choice and the
8     control to make a different decision if she wanted
9     to.  Dr. Hayes told you it takes motivation,
10     determination and persistence.  You heard that
11     Mrs. Owens' quit attempts, if any, were not
12     motivated, were not determined and were not
13     persistent.
14          Yesterday, Ms. Shamp asked Dr. Werner to
15     speculate.  Do some people try to quit and not tell
16     anyone?  It's complete speculation in this case
17     because the facts and the proof in this case tell
18     you differently.  Don't accept speculation.  Look at
19     the proof.
20          Martha told you her mother never went a full
21     day, 24 hours, without smoking a cigarette.  She
22     doesn't recall her mother making any attempt to quit
23     at any time before she moved out of the house in
24     1968.  And after she moved out, she recalled one
25     time coming home, and her mom was sucking on a 3647
1     lozenge in between smoking two cigarettes.  She
2     wasn't necessarily trying to quit, but just sucking
3     on a lozenge.  Not only is that not an attempt to
4     quit; it wasn't a quit at all.
5          Mr. Ellis only recalls two times when his
6     mother may have been trying to cut down.  In the
7     1960s, he recalls her sucking on something, a pill,
8     a lozenge, something, and in that time, she never
9     told him she was trying to quit.  And in the 1980s,
10     he wasn't around, but he heard that she tried
11     something again, but he wasn't there to observe
12     her.
13          Ladies and gentlemen, that was the evidence you
14     heard.  That was it.  Two times over the course of
15     30-plus years.  That's not persistence.
16          And these attempts, whenever they may be, had
17     one thing in common.  Her method to allegedly quit
18     smoking was to keep smoking.  No other steps.  No
19     plan, no motivation, no determination.  She never
20     took the step of throwing away her cigarettes or her
21     ashtrays in an attempt to quit smoking.  She never
22     made what the Surgeon General calls a "serious quit
23     attempt" of 24 hours.  And when cessation aids
24     became available in the '80s, Mrs. Owens didn't try
25     them.  And before cessation aids and after cessation 3648
1     aids, the most popular way to quit is cold turkey.
2     Mrs. Owens never tried that either.
3          Now, the plaintiff said that his mother
4     appeared to be moody or agitated when she was
5     sucking on that lozenge in the 1960s.  Well, first,
6     again, one of you asked a great question.  Smokers
7     who are not addicted can also have withdrawal
8     symptoms.  And, secondly, Mr. Ellis told you his mom
9     was going through a divorce at that time, a divorce
10     that he and his sisters knew nothing about even
11     though they were living in the same house.
12          You heard a little bit this morning, and I
13     guess you'll probably hear it this afternoon, about
14     when Mrs. Owens asked for cigarettes when she was in
15     the nursing home.  Now, you also heard from Martha
16     that during that visit in the nursing home, what
17     were the other two things that they got Mrs. Owens?
18     They got her a nightgown and they got her a
19     television, things to make her comfortable, things
20     that she enjoyed.  And as Mr. Ellis wrote on that
21     letter that we'll talk about in a little bit, he
22     said his mom enjoyed it.
23          And you also heard about many other times where
24     Mrs. Owens was unable to smoke, and no one told you
25     that she asked for cigarettes, complained or 3649
1     experienced any withdrawal symptoms.  And that was
2     her hospital stays.  You heard from Dr. Hayes.  She
3     was in the hospital for different treatment for 20
4     days in April of 1991, six days in July of that
5     year, 19 days in September of that year, 14 days in
6     June of 1992 and 28 days in January of 1993, five
7     different stays.
8          And on each of those occasions, neither Ken nor
9     Martha testified that she was moody or fidgety.
10     Nobody testified she had any cravings.  There was no
11     evidence that she asked, somebody get me cigarettes
12     or somebody take me outside so I can have one.  No
13     evidence.
14          More importantly, because of the lengths of
15     some of these stays, you know that all of the
16     nicotine was completely out of Mrs. Owens' system at
17     that time.  When she returned to smoking after those
18     stays, it was because she wanted to, not because of
19     addiction.  That's evidence she wasn't addicted.
20          Now, one other point.  Through some of the
21     witnesses, the plaintiff tried to suggest that there
22     was a genetic reason for Mrs. Owens' initiation and
23     her continued smoking.  Well, if -- if that's true
24     and that theory applies to Mrs. Owens, you know that
25     Ken and Martha bucked their genes.  They never 3650
1     smoked.  And you know that Uncle Bernice bucked his
2     genes because he quit smoking.  And Dr. Werner had
3     to admit yesterday that Uncle Bernice's quit is a
4     good indicator of success for Mrs. Owens, but it
5     would only be successful if she wanted to quit.
6          Mrs. Owens was always in control of the
7     decision to quit.  Dr. Werner said this yesterday on
8     direct examination.  Ms. Shamp asked her:
9          "Now -- and I heard you say that smokers have
10     control over their decision to quit."
11          And Dr. Werner said:  "That's correct."
12          Mrs. Owens never experienced a loss of control
13     over that decision.  She never lost the ability to
14     quit.  She was never significantly impaired.  She
15     was never significantly distressed.  She was not
16     addicted.
17          Now, because the plaintiff did not prove she
18     was addicted, he didn't clear that second hurdle
19     either, and for this additional reason, the answer
20     to the first answer on the verdict form has to be
21     no.
22          Let's move to the third hurdle.  If you find
23     that Mrs. Owens was addicted, the third hurdle is to
24     determine if her addiction was the legal cause of
25     her death. 3651
1          And you have it in your jury instructions at
2     Page 12, I think, and the instruction says:  An
3     addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine is a
4     legal cause of Betty Owens' lung cancer and death if
5     it directly and in a natural and continuous sequence
6     produced or contributed substantially to producing
7     Betty Owens' death so that it can reasonably be said
8     that but for that addiction, her death would not
9     have occurred when it did.
10          You have that in your instructions.  And the
11     evidence here proves that addiction is not the "but
12     for" reason for any of Mrs. Owens' smoking
13     behaviors.
14          The "but for" cause of her smoking was her
15     choice, her decision to smoke for as long as she did
16     because that's what she enjoyed and wanted to do.
17          Now, ask yourself this question:  If Mrs. Owens
18     was not addicted, would she have continued to smoke?
19     And I think from the evidence you heard in this
20     case, the answer is, of course, she would have.  For
21     this reason alone, addiction cannot be the legal
22     cause of her death because it was far from the
23     substantial cause of her smoking.  If her smoking
24     behavior would be the same whether she was addicted
25     or not, then addiction cannot be a substantial cause 3652
1     because it didn't make a difference.
2          As you look at this question in this case, keep
3     something in mind.  This case is about Mr. Ellis
4     seeking money on account of Mrs. Owens' decision to
5     do what she wanted to do for years.  Ms. Shamp said,
6     just because you make a choice doesn't mean it's a
7     good decision.  Well, in this trial, it really
8     doesn't matter whether you think Mrs. Owens' choices
9     were good choices or bad choices.  What matters is
10     that they were her choices and we shouldn't
11     second-guess them.
12          Yes, Mrs. Owens started smoking as a teenager.
13     There's no dispute about that.  Dr. Werner told you
14     yesterday, though, that she was mature enough at 13
15     or 14 to make the decision to get married and to
16     start a family and also mature enough to make the
17     decision to smoke.  We shouldn't second-guess the
18     choice.
19          Now, in response to the constant nagging and
20     hounding she received, Mrs. Owens told her children
21     that she enjoyed smoking; it relaxed her and she
22     liked to smoke.  Those are the reasons she offered
23     for smoking.  She didn't say she was addicted.  She
24     didn't say she was unable to quit.  When asked, she
25     responded she enjoyed it; it relaxed her and she 3653
1     liked it.
2          When Mrs. Owens chose not to sleep over at
3     Mr. Ellis's house, it wasn't because of an
4     addiction.  It was because it was her decision.  She
5     was a homebody who liked to be home.  As I covered
6     with Mr. Ellis on Monday, Mrs. Owens would say that
7     she preferred to go home where she could relax,
8     where she could be in her own house and do what she
9     wanted to do.  It sounds like the things that
10     homebodies like to do.  And the other thing is she
11     never expressed any interest in quitting so she
12     could spend the night.
13          You heard from Martha about how close she was
14     with her mother, and you heard how she asked
15     Mrs. Owens to stop smoking every time she saw her.
16     If Mrs. Owens wanted to quit smoking and just
17     couldn't do it, do you think she would have asked
18     her daughter, a nurse, for help in quitting?  Of
19     course, she would have.  But she never did.  Why?
20     Because she did not want to quit.  Martha told you
21     that.  This is the evidence in this case.
22          "You never heard your mother say that she
23     wanted to quit smoking?
24          "Never.
25          "Your mother never told you, I'm trying to quit 3654
1     smoking, did she?
2          "No, she didn't."
3          And Mr. Ellis told you he doesn't think anybody
4     could have said anything to Mrs. Owens to make her
5     quit.  Mrs. Owens was smart enough to know the risks
6     of smoking, but she was not motivated enough to want
7     to stop.  She smoked for as long as she did not
8     because she was addicted, but because she wanted to.
9     And Mr. Ellis shouldn't be awarded money for
10     Mrs. Owens' decisions.  So even if you decide Betty
11     Owens was addicted, that addiction was not a legal
12     cause.
13          And here's another way to look at what legal
14     cause requires, as you're instructed.  It requires
15     that it naturally, directly, continuously and
16     substantially caused it.  You saw that did not occur
17     in Mrs. Owens' case.  You saw that Mrs. Owens'
18     choices were the direct, the natural, the continuous
19     and the substantial causes of her injury.
20          Why?  Because she made the choice to begin
21     smoking against her father's wishes.  She made the
22     choice to continue smoking despite the health
23     warnings and hounding from her children.  She made
24     the choice to control her smoking.  And she made the
25     choice to not make a serious quit attempt.  And 3655
1     that's just not me saying this.  The plaintiff's
2     experts agree that the decision and the choice lies
3     with the individual.
4          Dr. Burns, you saw him by videotape.
5          He was asked:  "All right.  And you see what he
6     wrote at the last paragraph, E. Koop or Surgeon
7     General Koop, wrote 'Cigarette smoking is an
8     addictive behavior.'
9          "Yes.
10          "'And the individual smoker must decide whether
11     or not to continue that behavior?'
12          "You agree with that statement, don't you?"
13          And Dr. Burns said:  "Absolutely, sure."
14          Dr. Werner agreed with that very statement
15     again yesterday.
16          Mrs. Owens had a decision to make, and her
17     decision was to continue her smoking.  She never
18     said she wanted to decide otherwise and quit.  And
19     even Mr. Ellis admitted it was his mother's decision
20     to make.
21          You might remember this testimony from Monday.
22     He answered one of my questions.
23          "Well, I didn't allow her to smoke in my house.
24     I don't tell adults what they should or shouldn't
25     do." 3656
1          And then I asked:  "Is smoking an adult
2     decision?"
3          And Mr. Ellis said:  "Well, when you're an
4     adult, whatever decision you do is your decision.  I
5     don't make decisions for people."
6          That's the plaintiff in this case talking about
7     his mother, said whatever decision you do is your
8     decision.
9          But now, 21 years after her death, Mr. Ellis
10     doesn't want to respect Mrs. Owens' decision.  In
11     this lawsuit, to get money for his mother's choices,
12     Mr. Ellis tells you that his mother's decisions were
13     not her own, that she lost control, and her decision
14     to smoke was based on addiction.  That's not what he
15     told you on the stand.
16          And Dr. Koop reported, who is in control:
17     "Ultimately you are the one that has control over
18     your behavior.  The cigarette is not going to light
19     itself and jump into your mouth, nor are you going
20     to go into a brain-induced hypnotic trance and light
21     the cigarette.  No matter how much you have smoked
22     or how much you smoke, the choice to light up is
23     always yours."
24          Ladies and gentlemen, the cigarette didn't jump
25     into Mrs. Owens' mouth.  She made each and every 3657
1     choice, despite the knowledge of the harm it could
2     do to her.  Whatever decision she made was her
3     decision.  When Mrs. Owens made that choice to
4     smoke, her choice was the legal cause, the direct,
5     the natural and the substantial cause.  As a result,
6     any disease or death brought about by her smoking
7     was not legally caused by addiction.
8          I want to look at the verdict form, and you
9     have a copy with you.  Based on the evidence in this
10     case, looking at Question 1, the answer to Number 1
11     is no for three separate reasons.  Because the
12     plaintiff can only bring you a professional expert
13     who relies on aberrant and scant records that can't
14     be confirmed and more importantly because that
15     expert has testified in the past that he doesn't
16     believe there's sufficient evidence for a link
17     between adenocarcinoma and smoking, the first hurdle
18     is isn't met.  Because Mrs. Owens didn't suffer from
19     a loss of control or significant impairment or
20     distress, she was not addicted, and that hurdle
21     wasn't met.  And because addiction was not the "but
22     for" cause of Mrs. Owens' smoking or death, the
23     plaintiff failed to prove that addiction caused it,
24     so that hurdle isn't met.
25          So be -- can I get the ELMO, please, Michael? 3658
1          Because the plaintiff failed to clear all three
2     of these hurdles, the answer should be no to
3     Question 1, which you can see it has all three parts
4     in it.  The cause of her lung cancer; was she
5     addicted and was addiction a legal cause for lung
6     cancer.  Because they failed to clear any of those
7     three hurdles, the answer to Question 1 should be
8     no.
9          Now, you'll also see on the verdict form that
10     if your answer to Question 1 was yes, you continue.
11     But if your answer to Question 1 was no, you proceed
12     no further.  I represent that the evidence in this
13     case shows you you should check no and proceed no
14     further.
15          But I'm going to continue anyway.  If you
16     continue past that first question and clear those
17     three hurdles, you need to consider Mr. Ellis's
18     concealment and conspiracy to conceal claims in
19     Questions 2 and 3.  And I think we have a slide of
20     those.  These are the two questions pulled off your
21     verdict form on Pages 2 and 3.
22          Now, one thing I'll tell you upfront, when you
23     look at these two questions, you'll notice
24     specifically that Betty Owens' name is in both of
25     those.  These questions relate only to Betty Owens, 3659
1     not to some other smoker who isn't in this
2     courtroom.  They relate only to Betty Owens.  And
3     there essentially two parts to these questions.
4          First, you need to determine if information
5     about the health risks and the addictive nature of
6     smoking was a secret to Mrs. Owens, and if so,
7     you'll need to determine if she reasonably relied on
8     any statement to her detriment.  Here, the
9     information was not a secret to Mrs. Owens, and she
10     did not rely on anything any tobacco company said.
11          So let's start with that first question.  Were
12     the dangers of smoking a secret?  You'll remember
13     that Ms. Shamp told you in opening statement that
14     the evidence would show that the public didn't know
15     smoking was harmful, but the other side of the story
16     showed just the opposite.  It showed the public did
17     know about the risks of smoking and its addictive
18     nature, and more importantly, so did Mrs. Owens.  In
19     fact, it was drummed into her over and over by her
20     children.
21          And we need to even start this story before
22     Mrs. Owens was born.  You heard this from
23     Dr. Proctor.  He said before Reynolds even existed,
24     it was known tobacco contained nicotine.  It was
25     known for hundreds of years that it could be 3660
1     addictive and it could be hard to quit.  It was
2     known for a long time smoking can be bad for you.
3     And since the beginning of the 20th century, it was
4     common to refer to cigarettes as "coffin nails" or
5     "cancer sticks."
6          And incidentally you heard from Mr. Ellis
7     that -- the growing up, he heard the term "coffin
8     nails" and "cancer sticks."  And it would be used to
9     make fun of people because they smoked, because
10     there were health ramifications.
11          You saw this, Florida Health Notes, 1906.
12     "Today, the cigarette is looked upon by all smokers
13     as the very worst form of tobacco addiction.  And
14     Dr. Proctor told you that in that early 1900s, the
15     movement after alcohol prohibition, the crowds would
16     chant "nicotine next, nicotine next."  And he said
17     nicotine was synonymous with tobacco because
18     everyone knew it was a drug in tobacco that made it
19     hard to quit.
20          In the 1930s, you saw The Three Stooges in that
21     movie scene involving what?  The Coffin Nails
22     Cigarette Company from the 1930s.  Now, Dr. Proctor
23     can call it a joke, but the material information
24     that the Stooges had and all of their fans
25     understood was that smoking could kill you and put 3661
1     you in your coffin.  If people didn't understand
2     that, nobody would get the joke of Coffin Nails
3     Cigarette Company.
4          You heard that Mr. Owens -- or Mrs. Owens'
5     father didn't want his children to smoke.  Mr. Ellis
6     told you that his mom told him that if she got
7     smoking, she would be disciplined, and she would
8     likely get the belt.  As a result, she started
9     smoking behind her father's back so she wouldn't get
10     caught and punished.
11          You saw the coverage in the Reader's Digest.
12     Reader's Digest, a magazine that Mrs. Owens not only
13     read, but she collected.  You saw the coverage --
14     Ms. Shamp showed you a mouse this morning.  You saw
15     the coverage from the mouse skin painting that
16     appeared in LIFE magazine in 1953.  Again, a
17     magazine that Mrs. Owens read and collected.
18          The messages made it to the papers in
19     Tennessee.  You saw these from the 1950s.  And
20     Illinois, when they moved there after she married
21     Mr. Owens, it made it there in the 1950s.  And it
22     followed them to Virginia when they went to Roanoke.
23     Ann Landers said "Anyone who can read or hear knows
24     by now that there is a definite link between lung
25     cancer and cigarettes." 3662
1          Now, they can try to minimize Mrs. Owens'
2     education all they want, but there's no doubt that
3     Mrs. Owens could read and hear.
4          Now, not surprisingly, the public health
5     officials in the 1950s recognized this widespread
6     dissemination and awareness of the information.  You
7     saw these quotes from two of the pioneers back then.
8          Leroy Burney, who was the Surgeon General said:
9     "Our position is that we have informed the public
10     through the excellent coverage of the press, radio
11     and TV."
12          And Dr. Heller, who was the head of the
13     National Cancer Institute, said:  "Newspapers, radio
14     and TV and other media have done an excellent job
15     covering this problem and a very objective job.
16     This is an exceedingly valuable way of informing the
17     public."
18          When Mr. Carter pressed Dr. Proctor on these
19     statements, what did he say?  Dr. Proctor said that
20     Dr. Burney was engaging in -- and I wrote it down --
21     self-congratulating, and he said that Dr. Heller was
22     ignorant.
23          His theory is that these giants and pioneers in
24     public health work -- remember, he said they were
25     beating their chests when they made these comments. 3663
1     Now, these were guys making history in the 1950s,
2     the head of the NCI and the Surgeon General.  But
3     now 60 years later, Dr. Proctor, a guy who studies
4     history, said they were way off base.  These
5     officials had their boots on the ground back then
6     and were eyewitnesses for what the public knew.  And
7     at the time, they said the public knew.
8          Now, instead of praising these public health
9     officials for their contributions, Dr. Proctor calls
10     them ignorant chest-beaters.
11          In 1964, 50 years ago, the first Surgeon
12     General's Report linking smoking with lung cancer
13     was published, and you saw that it was front-page --
14     a front-page story around the country.  In Florida,
15     in 1964, the Times-Union.  And you know who was a
16     paper boy for the Times-Union from 1964 to 1968.  We
17     know who that was.  It was Mr. Ellis.  It wasn't
18     just in the paper.  It was in LIFE.  They covered
19     the 1964 Surgeon General's Report, again, a magazine
20     that Mrs. Owens read and collected.
21          And that night, it was on the evening news on
22     all three stations and there were only three.  So if
23     the TV was on in the Owens' household that night,
24     that story was on.
25          And -- and it was communicated in big red 3664
1     letters at the very spot that Mrs. Owens bought her
2     cigarettes.  This sign was posted at each of the
3     Navy Exchanges.  So if you bought cigarettes, you
4     were going to see the words from the Surgeon
5     General's Report in big red letters.
6          From 1960- -- January 1966 and every day
7     thereafter, every pack Mrs. Owens had in her hand
8     came with a warning label.  And we know Mrs. Owens
9     was aware of this warning label.  How do we know?
10     The evidence in this case.  Martha told us.
11          "When you first saw that warning label on a
12     package of cigarettes, you mentioned it to your
13     mother?
14          "Correct.
15          "You mentioned it to her during one of your
16     conversations when you asked her to quit smoking?
17          "Correct.
18          "And you told her specifically that even the
19     packet says that cigarette smoking could be harmful?
20          "Correct.
21          "Your mom had already seen the warning label on
22     cigarettes; is that correct?
23          "Yes, she said that she saw it."
24          Ken told you about it too in his testimony on
25     Monday. 3665
1          And you heard that when that warning label came
2     out, in the next four years, 13 million people made
3     the decision, made the choice to stop smoking.  They
4     had that warning in their hand, and they took
5     matters into their own hands and quit.  Mrs. Owens
6     could have too.
7          Now, this message was being communicated to
8     Americans in towns large and small around the
9     country.  You remember Dr. Horn, his "You could
10     stand on a rooftop and shout 'smoking is dangerous'
11     at the top of your lungs, and you would not be
12     telling anyone anything they did not already know."
13     That's Dr. Horn.
14          Dr. Burns also got on his own rooftop.  He was
15     the plaintiff's expert in this case.
16          And he was asked:  "Now, in 1981, you gave a
17     speech to a lung association group about the
18     percentage of smokers who were aware of the risks,
19     correct?"
20          "Yes.  I'm well familiar with that group.
21          "All right.  And you told that group in 1981
22     that 95 percent of smokers were thoroughly aware of
23     the health risks, and 90 percent thought that it
24     might affect their own health, correct?
25          "That's correct.  And I believe I said that 3666
1     more smokers know that cigarette smoking causes
2     disease or cancer than know the name of the
3     president of the United States."
4          That's the plaintiff's expert in this case.
5     And Dr. Burns also told you that he knew Dr. Horn,
6     and Dr. Horn had told him on a number of occasions
7     the same thing he said about people shouting it from
8     the rooftop and not telling them something you
9     wouldn't know.
10          Now, I suppose if we had asked Dr. Proctor, he
11     would probably say Dr. Burns and Dr. Horn were
12     ignorant chest-beaters as well.
13          And you know the warnings kept coming, 1970,
14     1985.  Through all this time, on top of all these
15     warnings you see, Mrs. Owens was receiving repeated
16     warnings and messages from whom?  Her children.
17     Even before Martha graduated from high school,
18     before she got married and before she moved out of
19     the house in 1968, she talked to her mother about
20     smoking.  And she told you how those conversations
21     continued every time she saw or talked to her
22     mother, especially when she was going to nursing
23     school.
24          Let's look at what Martha told you in this
25     case. 3667
1          "Something you learned during nursing school,
2     that smoking was associated with lung problems?
3          "Correct.
4          "And as you just said, you saw healthy lungs
5     versus damaged black lungs?
6          "Right.
7          "And you learned that it was the chemical --
8     chemicals in tobacco smoke that caused that damage
9     to the lungs?
10          "Correct."
11          Martha continued.
12          "And these things that you were being taught,
13     you shared what you were learning in nursing school
14     with your mother?
15          "Yes.
16          "You told her that cigarette smoking wasn't
17     healthy for her?
18          "Yes.
19          "You told her about the damaged lungs and the
20     chemicals in the tobacco smoke that you learned
21     about?
22          "Yes.
23          "You told your mother if she kept up smoking,
24     she would have respiratory issues?
25          "Yes, I did. 3668
1          "You told her about chronic obstructive
2     coronary disease, COPD, that would get if she kept
3     smoking?
4          "Correct.
5          "You told her about the possibility of cancer
6     if she kept smoking?
7          "Correct.
8          "You also told your mother that there was a
9     possibility she would have to wear oxygen if she
10     kept smoking?
11          "Correct.
12          Did Mrs. Owens ever respond to Martha by
13     saying, well, I saw a story somewhere else that
14     conflicted with what you just told me you learned in
15     nursing school?
16          No, not once.
17          Now, Martha tried to tell you she didn't know
18     if her mother received the paper, but as we
19     established, Mr. Ellis was a paper boy.  And you
20     remember when I asked if he thought his mom received
21     the paper prior to the time he was a paper boy and
22     we had that exchange over what it means to believe
23     or not believe, well, I'm not sure how Mr. Ellis
24     would finally define the word "believed."  But
25     Martha testified that her mother "believed" 3669
1     everything that anyone would tell her.  Remember
2     that testimony?
3          If that's true, that would include LIFE.  That
4     would include Reader's Digest.  That would include
5     the Navy Exchange.  It would include the warnings on
6     the packs.  But more importantly, it would surely
7     include what her own flesh and blood told her.  Her
8     own children, including her daughter, the nurse,
9     told her over and over and over about the risks of
10     smoke and the need to quit.  If she believed
11     everything that anyone would tell her, she certainly
12     would have believed everything that her son and
13     daughter told her about cigarette smoking.
14          When we talk about material information and
15     when you try to answer Questions 2 and 3, Page 15 of
16     your jury instructions tells you what material
17     information is.  And it says:  Material information
18     is information that is of such importance that Betty
19     Owens would have considered it significant in her
20     decision-making process.
21          The information that Betty Owens was getting
22     from her daughter was material information.  She had
23     the material information about the dangers of
24     cigarette smoking and its addictive nature.
25          So on the first prong of Questions 2 and 3, was 3670
1     that -- were the dangers a secret?  The plaintiff
2     cannot prove the material information about the
3     health effects or addictive nature were secrets from
4     Mrs. Owens.  They assured me they did not.  So for
5     that reason alone, the concealment claims,
6     Questions 2 and 3 on your verdict form, the answer
7     has to be no on those.
8          Now, that alone is enough to deal with those
9     two questions, but there's a separate reason why the
10     answer has to be no there.  And the second component
11     to these is the issue of reliance.  And Ms. Shamp
12     spent some time talking about that this morning.
13     To -- to let you know what that means,
14     Jacksonville's called the "River City," and as a
15     result, Jacksonville has a number of bridges -- the
16     Main Street Bridge, the Acosta Bridge.  To prevail
17     on Questions 2 and 3, the plaintiff needs to build a
18     bridge in this courtroom.  They need to build the
19     Betty Owens bridge.
20          And for the second part of the concealment and
21     conspiracy claims, they need to build a bridge
22     between statements, something that was said and on
23     the other side of the bridge, something Mrs. Owens
24     did.  And they need to build that bridge with
25     evidence. 3671
1          For purposes of the verdict form, the bridge is
2     called "legal cause."  It's defined as reliance.
3     And you have to decide if the reliance, if they can
4     show any, is reasonable.  Now, the plaintiff then
5     has to prove that Reynolds' conduct caused
6     Mrs. Owens, not some other smoker, but Mrs. Owens to
7     take some action to rely on something that was or
8     wasn't said and then get a disease caused by smoking
9     that she otherwise would have avoided.  If the
10     plaintiff can't build that bridge, then they will
11     have failed to meet their burden of proof with
12     regard to the concealment and conspiracy claims in
13     Questions 2 and 3.  Ladies and gentlemen, the
14     evidence you heard never let the plaintiff make the
15     first step towards building that bridge.
16          I told you in opening statement to keep this
17     question in mind:  What does this have to do with
18     Betty Owens?  Dr. Proctor came here and spent hours
19     telling you about statements from industry
20     representatives to the public.  Now, Dr. Figlar told
21     you that some of those positions, whether they were
22     based on science or not, were -- were clung to for
23     probably too long.  And in some other smoker's case,
24     one of these other cases that Dr. Proctor's in,
25     maybe those statements matter.  Maybe they're 3672
1     relevant.  But not in Mrs. Owens' case.
2          For the second and third claims, the plaintiff
3     has to build their bridge between something Reynolds
4     said or did and Mrs. Owens.  And Mr. Ellis did not
5     do that.  Fact witness after fact witness confirmed
6     that fact.
7          No witness testified that Mrs. Owens ever saw,
8     heard, read or relied on any of these things, not
9     the Frank Statement, nothing from CTR, TIRC, TI,
10     press releases, anything from Reynolds, anything
11     from Brown & Williamson or anything from the
12     American Tobacco Company.  That was the evidence in
13     this case.
14          Now, the plaintiff will argue that even though
15     there's no evidence specifically about Betty Owens
16     hearing, reading, seeing, or relying on something
17     that Reynolds ever said that you can assume it
18     happened.  But assumptions are not facts.  Someone
19     who has proof doesn't need to rely on an inference
20     or an assumption.  But Ms. Shamp said, well, maybe
21     you can infer that.  Ladies and gentlemen, don't
22     infer something that is contrary to the facts you
23     heard in this case.
24          And I'm going to show you some of the facts in
25     Betty Owens' case.  As Mr. Ellis would say when I 3673
1     asked him questions, these are what you would call
2     the 100 percent true facts.  Ms. Shamp asked in her
3     closing, what evidence did we put up?  I'm going to
4     show you that.  Evidence we put up from Martha.
5          "And it's fair to say you don't know anything
6     R. J. Reynolds said or did that caused your mother
7     to smoke her first cigarette?
8          "Since I wasn't born yet, no, I can't say.  I
9     don't know.
10          "Your mother never talked to you about why she
11     chose a brand of cigarette; is that correct?
12          "No."
13          What evidence did we put up?  This is from
14     Martha.
15          "You never heard your mother say that something
16     a tobacco company said or did caused her to start
17     smoking?
18          "No.
19          "Or to continue smoking?
20          "No.
21          "In fact, your mother never talked about
22     statements that she heard or read from any tobacco
23     company?
24          "No.  She didn't talk to me about anything,
25     no." 3674
1          What evidence did we put up?  How about this
2     from Mr. Ellis?  And this is hard to read and I'll
3     summarize.  He basically said he never had any
4     conversation with his mother about TIRC, CTR, Frank
5     Statement, any -- any contact with a tobacco
6     company, Hill & Knowlton, British American Tobacco,
7     Philip Morris, Lorillard, Reynolds, American,
8     Brown & Williamson, nothing.
9          There is no evidence in this case, nothing,
10     nothing from CTR, nothing from TI, nothing from
11     Reynolds or any of its companies, nothing.  That's
12     the evidence that was put up here, the evidence that
13     there is no reliance because she never saw anything
14     or heard anything that they could identify in the
15     first place.
16          I thought it was interesting in her closing
17     argument, Ms. Shamp put up and mentioned the -- the
18     testimony before Congress.  And that testimony
19     before Congress was in 1994.  You learned that
20     Mrs. Owens died in 1993.  She couldn't have relied
21     on something that happened a year after she passed.
22          Now, Ms. Shamp did and may continue when she
23     gets up later this afternoon -- she talked about
24     filters and menthol, maybe lights and low tar.  She
25     may talk about that.  But you know who never did? 3675
1     Mrs. Owens.  And there's no evidence that that stuff
2     had anything to do with her selection of brands.
3     She asked what evidence did we put up?  We put up
4     this, from Martha.
5          "You never heard your mother say that filtered
6     cigarettes were safer or that they were healthier?
7          "No.
8          "Your mother never told you that light
9     cigarettes were healthier or that they were safer?
10          "No.
11          "You mentioned menthol cigarettes.  You never
12     heard your mother say that the menthol cigarettes
13     were healthier or safer?
14          "No.
15          "Your mother never said to you that low-tar or
16     low-nicotine cigarettes were healthier or that they
17     were safer?
18          "No."
19          Mr. Ellis told you the same thing.  These are
20     the 100 percent true facts.  There is no reliance.
21     Instead, what you heard, the basis for Mrs. Owens'
22     decisions were based on price.  Martha -- or
23     Mr. Ellis told you.
24          "And price was the primary factor in your mom
25     in her selecting a brand of cigarette, wasn't it? 3676
1          "I would say so.
2          "And price is the only reason you can think of
3     of why she switched from one brand of cigarette to
4     another, correct?
5          "That would probably be true."
6          Her decisions weren't based on anything about
7     the filters or menthol or ads or coupons or
8     statements.  Her decisions were based on price.
9          Ms. Shamp told you in her closing this morning
10     that you would get evidence that is relevant and
11     evidence that is irrelevant.  I'm going to talk
12     about evidence that's irrelevant right now.  And
13     that's evidence about coupons.  The plaintiff
14     attempted to make a big deal out of coupons.  I
15     submit that the evidence about coupons is not
16     relevant to the issues you have to decide.
17          Why?  Well, to begin with, there's nothing
18     illegal or fraudulent about coupons.  They cannot be
19     a basis of liability if they're not illegal or
20     fraudulent.  And as Dr. Goldberg told you, there's
21     nothing materially false about the coupons.
22          He was asked by Mr. Carter:  "Have you come
23     across any examples that you believed contained
24     materially false information with respect to the
25     coupons? 3677
1          "No.  They promised goods and they delivered
2     the goods.
3          "So you've never seen a materially false
4     statement in a coupon that you've reviewed for
5     Reynolds?
6          "They promised the goods and they delivered the
7     goods.  That was the deal.  That was the deal."
8          So moreover, even though coupons were legal and
9     delivered exactly what they promised, there's no
10     evidence that they impacted Mrs. Owens' smoking
11     decisions.  Did she collect coupons?  Sure.  I don't
12     dispute that she had them.  But what does it mean?
13     This was what Martha told you.
14          "Now, your mother never told you that she
15     started smoking a specific brand because it offered
16     coupons, did she?
17          "No.
18          "Your mother never told you that she continued
19     to smoke a brand specifically because of the
20     coupons; is that correct?
21          "Correct, no.
22          "And your mother never told you that she would
23     quit smoking if not for those coupons; is that
24     correct?
25          "Oh, we never had that conversation, no." 3678
1          And Ken told you he couldn't recall Mrs. Owens
2     sending in coupons to get something and not getting
3     what she wanted back.  That was the deal.  If she
4     smoked and -- and the cigarettes she happened to
5     smoke had coupons on them, she saved them.  You
6     heard she also saved the S&H Green Stamps.  From
7     whatever else she bought, she saved the stamps and
8     she turned in those -- turned those in too.  Coupons
9     can't be a basis of liability here.
10          And it's a similar story with advertisements.
11     I told you that you would see a lot of ads from
12     Dr. Goldberg and you did.  And they were trying to
13     upset you with allegations about youth marketing and
14     casting stones about ads being used by a variety of
15     consumer goods, whether it's Santa Claus or the
16     military or attractive women or people having fun.
17     And they showed you documents that contained
18     demographics on teens in the 1970s and the 1980s,
19     again, trying to tick you off.
20          But remember in the '70s and '80s, Betty Owens
21     was what, 40s, 50s?  Far from youth.  She was a
22     mature adult with a job, had three grown children.
23     She had raised one to be a nurse, one to be a
24     successful person in the corporate business world.
25          And the other thing about ads, Dr. Goldberg 3679
1     couldn't link any statement or ad to Mrs. Owens
2     because he didn't know anything about her.
3          And Mrs. Shamp -- Ms. Shamp said people in the
4     public smoke because of ads.  Well, this case isn't
5     about people in the public.  This case is about
6     Betty Owens.  And we asked the witnesses who knew
7     Mrs. Owens if she ever discussed advertisements with
8     them or if she ever made any smoking decision based
9     on an advertisement.  Every witness said no; Uncle
10     Bernice, Ken, Martha.  Let's look at what they said.
11          Martha was asked:  "Your mother never talked
12     about cigarette advertisements with you, correct?
13          "No.
14          "She never told you that she started smoking a
15     specific brand of cigarettes because of an
16     advertisement that she saw?
17          "You mean -- well, my mother was growing up,
18     there were no TVs in that home, so she never saw any
19     ads on TV, so no."
20          That's evidence in this case that she didn't
21     see any ad or rely on any ad, and according to
22     Martha, she never even saw them because they didn't
23     have a TV.
24          And it's a similar story with Mr. Ellis.  She
25     asked, what evidence did we put up?  We put up this 3680
1     evidence.
2          "Now, your mother never told you that she
3     smoked a particular brand because of an
4     advertisement she saw, did she?
5          "I can't ever recall that.
6          "And you don't recall your mother ever telling
7     you that she smoked because of tobacco advertising,
8     correct?"
9          The answer:  "Correct."
10          Those admissions where Mr. Ellis and
11     Ms. Schofield sealed the deal on any allegation
12     about advertising.
13          The important facts for this case are that no
14     witness who knew Mrs. Owens testified that she ever
15     smoked a brand of cigarette because of an ad or a
16     slogan or any statement by R. J. Reynolds, not the
17     Kool Jazz Festival, not NASCAR racing, not The
18     Beverly Hillbillies and not Joe Camel.
19          You heard a lot about Joe Camel both ways in
20     this case.  The truth is at the time of the Joe
21     Camel campaign, Mrs. Owens was in her 40s and her
22     50s.  Nobody testified that she saw the Joe Camel
23     campaign.  Nobody testified that she smoked Camel
24     cigarettes because of the Joe Camel campaign.  And
25     over this back and forth, over what the stats show 3681
1     and what was in this book, what was in this, if you
2     look at anything on Joe Camel, look at AM 2645.
3     That's a June 1994 study from the FTC, after the
4     Surgeon General's Report that Ms. Shamp mentioned
5     this morning.
6          And the FTC concludes -- you remember,
7     Mr. Carter did this with Dr. Goldberg.  And the FTC
8     concluded, you know, look, we would like to think
9     that Joe Camel got kids to smoke and it really drove
10     initiation.  But we looked at it, we investigated it
11     and the conclusion is it didn't.
12          Ladies and gentlemen, I don't want to go back
13     and forth all day on Joe Camel because it has
14     nothing to do with Betty Owens, but that was the
15     fact you heard from the FTC about Joe Camel.
16          And when it came to Mrs. Owens' choices with
17     cigarettes and brands, the only thing that mattered
18     to her was price.
19          Another thing about advertisements, every
20     advertisement the plaintiff showed you in this case
21     was a legal advertisement.  In fact, you'll remember
22     Dr. Goldberg said he hadn't really looked at Sports
23     Illustrated, but for some reason this year, he
24     happened to pick up the swimsuit issue.  Do you
25     remember that?  And he started to talk about it. 3682
1     And the judge cut him off and instructed you that
2     Reynolds hasn't broken any law with Sports
3     Illustrated and ordered you to disregard
4     Dr. Goldberg's testimony.
5          But the final point on advertising is the
6     instruction you have in your jury instructions.
7     Page 18, second paragraph, the Court instructed you:
8     Manufacturing and selling and advertising cigarettes
9     is a lawful activity.  I, therefore, instruct you
10     that R. J. Reynolds cannot be held liable for merely
11     manufacturing, selling or advertising cigarettes.
12          The plaintiff knew that was the instruction.
13     And worse yet, they knew that advertising had
14     nothing to do with Mrs. Owens' decisions, but they
15     still spent hour upon hour showing you ads in the
16     hope that it would upset you.
17          Now, throughout the course of this trial, you
18     did hear two things that I think the plaintiff may
19     come back this afternoon and say, well, this shows
20     you that Mrs. Owens thought something different.
21     And you heard that when she was diagnosed with lung
22     cancer, they said that she didn't believe she had
23     lung cancer.  Well, if Mrs. Owens really believed
24     everything that anyone told her, you'd have to ask,
25     would she have believed her doctors; would she have 3683
1     believed when they told her those facts, when those
2     facts were the same ones that her daughter Martha
3     had told her throughout her life?  And finally, if
4     you don't think you have lung cancer, why would you
5     proceed with chemotherapy and radiation and lung
6     surgery?
7          Second, I think Martha testified that on one
8     occasion her mom told her that the government
9     wouldn't allow something to be sold if it was
10     harmful.  Now, Mr. Ellis told you that Mrs. Owens
11     was skeptical of the government, but Martha told you
12     she wouldn't -- she didn't think the government
13     would allow something to be sold that was harmful.
14     Either way, it doesn't matter for -- for purposes of
15     this case.  Mr. Ellis has a beef with the government
16     for selling cigarettes.  That's not an issue in this
17     case.
18          Ladies and gentlemen, use your common sense and
19     focus on the facts about Betty Owens.  When the
20     plaintiff can't produce a single witness to say
21     Mrs. Owens heard, read, saw and, most importantly,
22     relied on anything Reynolds said or didn't say,
23     don't infer otherwise.  Because when you get this
24     question, did concealment of information cause
25     Mrs. Owens' death, the answer has to be no.  If 3684
1     there was any evidence that Betty Owens relied on
2     any statement from Reynolds, don't you think they
3     would have given that information to Dr. Proctor or
4     Dr. Goldberg so they could talk about it?  Of
5     course, they would have.  But they didn't because
6     they can't.  That evidence doesn't exist in this
7     case.  That's why Ms. Shamp kept talking about the
8     public and other smokers and not about Betty Owens.
9          Now, after listening to Dr. Proctor and
10     Dr. Goldberg, it isn't surprising that Mr. Ellis, on
11     the witness stand, spouted out a couple times
12     saying, well, there's conflicting stories.  I
13     believe he probably picked that up here at trial
14     because there was no proof in his deposition or no
15     proof on the witness stand that his mom ever saw,
16     heard or relied on such a conflicting story.
17          Where was the proof?  There isn't any.  That
18     piece of the puzzle is completely missing from their
19     burden of proof.  Otherwise, Mr. Ellis and Martha
20     would have shown it to you.  This case is only about
21     Mrs. Owens, and there's no evidence at all that she
22     relied or heard statements from R. J. Reynolds.
23          And no matter what some other smoker in some
24     other case might have done, the plaintiff has to
25     prove in this case that Mrs. Owens did.  He has to 3685
1     provide the puzzle pieces.  He didn't.  There is no
2     Betty Owens bridge in this case between statements
3     from Reynolds and some action from Mrs. Owens.
4     There's no evidence.  There's no proof of reliance.
5     And that is the 100 percent true fact in this case.
6          Can I get the ELMO again, please?  Thank you.
7          So if you look at your verdict form,
8     Questions 2 and 3, because Mrs. Owens knew the
9     material facts about the health effects and
10     addictive nature of smoking, the answer must be no.
11     And because there's no reliance or what's called
12     "legal cause" on anything Reynolds said or did, the
13     answer has to be no.
14          So for those reasons, the only answer on
15     Question 2 and Question 3 is no.
16          I want to address a couple other points.  I
17     told you in opening that the plaintiff would
18     overreach and force pieces into spots where they
19     don't fit and try to create pieces to fill in for
20     those that are missing.  And I think he did it.
21          And one I want to talk about was one that
22     Ms. Shamp stressed in her closing and that's the
23     National Enquirer.  The National Enquirer, a
24     magazine known for preposterous stories that Elvis
25     is still alive; the next royal baby is going to have 3686
1     two heads; President Obama's visited by Martians,
2     whatever they have on a week-to-week basis.
3          And the plaintiff's story in this case was that
4     there was an article that ran in the National
5     Enquirer that was a reprint of an article that ran
6     in True, and the article in the National Enquirer
7     was -- said it was authored by Charles Golden.  And
8     Dr. Proctor said that Charles Golden was a
9     fictitious name made up by Hill & Knowlton.
10          Now, I don't dispute that Mrs. Owens read the
11     National Enquirer.  But no one suggested that
12     Mrs. Owens ever saw, read or heard that article that
13     appeared one time in the National Enquirer or
14     discussed it with Mr. Ellis or Ms. Schofield, no
15     one.
16          Now, Martha did suggest that her mom may have
17     believed a different story about a woman turning
18     into a snake.  She never suggested that her mother
19     heard or read any article in the National Enquirer
20     about smoking.
21          And even if she had seen it, you would have to
22     decide if relying on a single article in the
23     National Enquirer over the decades of health
24     warnings in the Reader's Digest that she read and
25     collected, the LIFE she read and collected, the 3687
1     local newspapers that Ken delivered, the information
2     on her cigarette packs, the information at the
3     checkout counter at the Navy base and the constant
4     hounding from her children, you'd have to decide if
5     that one article, if she saw it, it would be
6     reasonable to rely on that compared to everything
7     else.
8          Again, getting back to the burden of proof,
9     what is the more persuasive and convincing force
10     there?  I submit it can't be that somebody would
11     rely on something in the National Enquirer over the
12     wealth of other information that she had.
13          But this attempt to really create something out
14     of the National Enquirer, all it really did was
15     expose two of the plaintiff's experts, Dr. Proctor
16     and Dr. Goldberg.  This is what Dr. Proctor said
17     first.
18          "And that's exactly what my next question is.
19     I believe you said twice on direct and now again
20     that Charles Golden was not a real person and it was
21     a fictitious name, correct?
22          "Yes.
23          "And you said it was invented by Hill &
24     Knowlton to conceal the fact that it was a version
25     of the Stanley Frank story, correct? 3688
1          "I think that's basically correct."
2          So Dr. Proctor said Hill & Knowlton invented
3     Charles Golden.
4          So on cross, you'll remember Mr. Carter showed
5     him an article from the National Enquirer from
6     1963 -- or from 1967 that linked a murder in Miami
7     to the JFK assassination in 1963.  And when
8     Mr. Carter showed Dr. Proctor that, Dr. Proctor had
9     to come clean.
10          And Mr. Carter asked him:  "So you had not
11     bothered to look at the National Enquirer to see if
12     Charles Golden existed and if he had written other
13     stories for the National Enquirer before you came in
14     and told the jury that he was created by tobacco
15     companies for that story, did you?"
16          And Dr. Proctor said:  "That's correct."
17          Now, I think the plaintiff was not pleased that
18     that puzzle piece got ripped apart, and so I think
19     they tried to have Dr. Goldberg tape it back
20     together for them.  So what they did is they
21     spoon-fed him documents the day before he testified
22     so -- documents he didn't have at his deposition,
23     documents not on his reliance list, and they asked
24     him to clean up the mess that Dr. Proctor created.
25     This is what Dr. Goldberg said. 3689
1          "The National Enquirer article, had you seen
2     that prior to yesterday?
3          "No.
4          "And, in fact, the first time you reviewed
5     those documents as a group to offer the opinions you
6     gave today was yesterday, correct?
7          "That's correct.
8          "They were provided to you by Ms. Shamp; is
9     that true?
10          "Yes."
11          But that puzzle piece still didn't fit.  Look
12     at what Dr. Goldberg said.
13          "Is it your testimony that the tobacco industry
14     created Charles Golden as a cover for Mr. Frank,
15     that his identity and his use of a pseudonym was one
16     that was created by Hill & Knowlton?
17          "No.  It was created by the National Enquirer."
18          I don't think the National Enquirer means
19     anything in this case, but those are the facts you
20     heard from their witnesses on two different stories
21     about who created it or who didn't.  And no matter
22     that, nobody ever said Mrs. Owens saw it.
23          So inquiring minds want to know, why did
24     Dr. Proctor stretch the story without checking the
25     facts first?  And inquiring minds want to know, why 3690
1     did plaintiff's counsel have to give the documents
2     to Dr. Goldberg the night before he testified?  And
3     inquiring minds want to know, why spend so much
4     effort on an article that neither Ken nor Martha
5     said Mrs. Owens ever saw or read?
6          And the answer, it was another attempt by the
7     plaintiff to force a puzzle piece, or worse, make
8     one where it doesn't exist because there's
9     absolutely no evidence that Mrs. Owens ever saw that
10     article or could have reasonably relied on an
11     article in the National Enquirer.  It's a misshapen
12     puzzle piece that doesn't fit in this case.
13          But that wasn't the only puzzle piece the
14     plaintiff tried to create.  Mr. Ellis created his
15     own puzzle piece and sent it to his Uncle Bernice.
16     You saw Mr. Ellis's letter.  You'll have it in
17     evidence.  It's ARA 2091.
18          Now, before Bernice gave a deposition in this
19     case, a deposition you got to see, Mr. Ellis sent
20     him a letter to "jog his memory."  But on the stand,
21     Mr. Ellis is like, I sat down five, ten minutes and
22     just sent it to him.  But I don't know how good a
23     typist he is, but that's pretty good to pound that
24     out in five or ten minutes if you're not really
25     giving it any thought. 3691
1          But Mr. Ellis also said that Mr. Birdwell, he
2     couldn't read or write very well.  Well, why send
3     him a letter?  Either way, the letter contained
4     facts Mr. Ellis wanted to plant with his
5     Uncle Bernice.
6          Now, one fact he got right in here was where he
7     said his mom smoked because she enjoyed it.  But you
8     know that there were many facts in this letter that
9     were just fraud.  Wrong as to how much Mrs. Owens
10     smoked.  Wrong as to how many times she tried to
11     quit.  And wrong as to what she did to try to quit.
12     All of the things he wrote in that letter would have
13     made their case here better if they were true, but
14     they weren't.
15          Ms. Shamp said this morning she wanted to talk
16     about the truth.  Mr. Ellis didn't want to talk
17     about the truth in that letter to his Uncle Bernice.
18          Now, not only were many of the statements in
19     that letter just wrong; they were directly contrary
20     to what Mr. Ellis had testified to under oath.  So
21     inquiring minds want to know, why send the letter to
22     someone that you know contains wrong information and
23     is contrary to your own sworn testimony?  Inquiring
24     minds want to know, why fail to mention that you
25     sent the letter to your uncle in your deposition, 3692
1     and why didn't you save a copy of it?  The answer is
2     simple.  The letter was an attempt by Mr. Ellis to
3     put words in his uncle's mouth, to make puzzle
4     pieces for use in this trial.
5          But you got to see and hear his Uncle Bernice.
6     You heard what he said about the letter.  And you
7     heard what he said about his relationship with
8     Mr. Ellis.  You can judge who to believe.
9          These pieces that the plaintiff tried to
10     manufacture in this case only bring his
11     believability and the credibility of their experts
12     into question.  They don't help meet his burden of
13     proof, and instead, they shine a spotlight on the
14     gaping holes in this case and further support a
15     verdict in favor of Reynolds.
16          Now, if you get beyond the first three
17     questions, you'll get to Question 4 on comparative
18     fault.  If you get there, you will have had to
19     decide that Mrs. Owens died of adenocarcinoma caused
20     from smoking, that she was addicted, that addiction
21     was a legal cause of her death and that Reynolds'
22     conduct was the legal cause of her death.  And I
23     submit that the evidence I'm showing you today that
24     you saw during the trial doesn't allow you to get to
25     this question. 3693
1          But if you do, you'll have to allocate
2     responsibility between Reynolds and Mrs. Owens.  The
3     question is the allegation of -- allocation of fault
4     for her death.  And there are a couple points to
5     keep in mind.  The assignment of fault relegates
6     only to actions that were a legal cause of
7     Mrs. Owens' death.  And R. J. Reynolds cannot be
8     assigned fault for actions that were not a legal
9     cause of Mrs. Owens' death.  These points are in
10     your instructions and they're very important.
11          Comparative fault is not a global comparison of
12     conduct.  It's not what did Betty Owens do over the
13     course of her life versus the global conduct of the
14     tobacco industry.  It's a comparison of actions of
15     Betty Owens and R. J. Reynolds that were the legal
16     cause of her death.  It's a very narrow inquiry.
17          Now, you may have seen things throughout this
18     trial that the tobacco company said in public or
19     wrote internally that you don't like, but the issue
20     in this case is whether they affected Betty Owens
21     and caused her death.  If you find that something
22     Reynolds did was wrong and you don't like it, but is
23     it connected to Betty Owens, it cannot be considered
24     part of your analysis under comparative fault.
25          Now, Ms. Shamp raised the issue of the brands 3694
1     that Mrs. Owens smoked.  And I told you that they
2     would have the burden of proving the brands she
3     smoked, when she smoked them, how long she smoked
4     them, why she smoked them.  Now, both Mr. Ellis and
5     Ms. Schofield identified a number of different
6     brands, but neither one of them could tell you how
7     long she smoked any of them.
8          You saw from Martha.
9          "You observed that she would often buy
10     cigarettes that were on sale at the base?
11          "Correct.
12          "And, now, the brand she bought depended on
13     whether the brand was on special at the base that
14     week?
15          "Correct.
16          "But of those, there wasn't any particular
17     brand that you observed that would be her regular
18     brand?
19          "No.
20          "Sometimes it would change from week to week,
21     sometimes two weeks it was the same?
22          "Correct."
23          Mr. Ellis told you.
24          "You don't know what your mom's favorite brand
25     of cigarettes was, do you? 3695
1          "No.  I have no idea of her favorite.
2          "And that's because she switched brands all the
3     time, right?
4          "Well, she rotated with a certain more than
5     others.
6          "She never told you that she had a favorite
7     brand of cigarette, did she?
8          "We didn't talk about cigarettes like that,
9     no."
10          Then he was asked:  "And you can't put a time
11     frame on when she smoked any of those brands to the
12     exclusion of any other brand, correct?
13          "Probably not.
14          "And you can't tell us the order in which your
15     mother smoked any of the brands that she smoked, can
16     you?
17          "I didn't study it that hard to know that
18     answer.  No.  I would say no.
19          "So you can't identify a decade in which she
20     smoked any particular brand of cigarette?
21          "I just said I don't have the answer."
22          Plaintiff failed to prove how long Mrs. Owens
23     smoked any of my client's brands.  Now, Ms. Shamp
24     pointed out to you a stipulation, a stipulation that
25     two other companies, Lorillard and Philip Morris, 3696
1     that their brands weren't a legal cause, and I'm not
2     here to tell you they were.  But what I am here to
3     tell you is that stipulation doesn't say Reynolds'
4     brands were a legal cause, and it's their obligation
5     to prove that.  Just because other companies aren't
6     in this case, it doesn't mean we're responsible for
7     every other bit of smoking without them proving what
8     it was.
9          So that's something to keep in mind in this
10     case if you have to allocate fault for the acts that
11     caused Mrs. Owens' death because Reynolds can only
12     be responsible for its conduct and its cigarettes.
13     So when they can't even identify the decade that she
14     smoked any one of them, please consider that.
15          Now, leaving the brand identification and
16     smoking history aside, Mrs. Ellis's [sic] attorneys
17     and Ms. Shamp today tried to play this question a
18     little cute, and they say it's up to you to
19     determine if Mrs. Owens is responsible at all.  But
20     she never accepted or acknowledged any
21     responsibility for Mrs. Owens' decision to start
22     smoking and continue smoking, despite the knowledge
23     of the risks and Ken and Martha's nagging and
24     hounding, never.  No responsibility at all for
25     someone who made her own decisions and did what she 3697
1     wanted to without regard to the risk to her health.
2          I come back to the words of their experts.
3          "Dr. Burns, you've said many times that smokers
4     are responsible for their own smoking behavior,
5     correct?
6          "That's correct.
7          "And even if they're addicted, the smokers are
8     still responsible for their own smoking behavior,
9     correct?
10          "That's correct.  The fact that someone's
11     addicted is a barrier to behavioral change, but it
12     doesn't free them from responsibility for their own
13     behavior."
14          Dr. Burns says smokers remain responsible.  He
15     doesn't say Reynolds does.  And -- and look at how
16     Mrs. Owens accepted responsibility during her life,
17     without blaming anyone.  She left school.  She got
18     married and accepted the responsibility of starting
19     a family when she was a teenager.
20          When her first husband killed herself [sic],
21     she didn't seek to blame anyone.  She got a job and
22     she accepted the responsibility of raising Ken and
23     Martha.
24          When she remarried, had another child and
25     ultimately decided to divorce Mr. Owens, she didn't 3698
1     blame anyone.  She accepted the responsibility of
2     raising three children, getting her GED and getting
3     a job.
4          Now, Ms. Shamp has pointed out through a number
5     of witnesses in this trial that I called this
6     "street smarts" and I did.  I didn't call it street
7     smart as a way to demean Mrs. Owens, but as a way to
8     praise her.  Maybe instead of "street smarts," I
9     should have called all these accomplishments a sign
10     that she had and took personal responsibility
11     because that's what she did.  When she was diagnosed
12     with lung cancer, she never placed the blame on
13     Reynolds or any other tobacco company.  You heard
14     Martha on that.
15          "Ms. Schofield, last question.  Your mother
16     never blamed the tobacco companies for her decision
17     to smoke, did she?
18          "We never had a conversation of any kind
19     whatsoever like that, no."
20          And you know that Mrs. Owens never told
21     Mr. Ellis that she blamed the tobacco companies.  In
22     fact, for 17 years after her death, it never entered
23     Mr. Ellis's mind to sue until he saw something in
24     the paper and embarked on what he said is a
25     vindictive personal vendetta. 3699
1          If Mrs. Owens had to assign responsibility,
2     would she accept it?  Of course, she would.
3     Mrs. Owens faced adult matters, she made adult
4     choices and she shouldered adult responsibilities
5     her entire life.  Smoking was no different.  She's
6     responsible for her decision to choose to smoke and
7     keep smoking despite knowledge of the risks.  And
8     she's responsible for the injuries she suffered
9     because of those choices.
10          I showed you a slide earlier for Mr. Ellis.
11     And you remember he said this:  "When you are an
12     adult, whatever decision you do is your decision.
13     Ultimately, you are the one who has control over
14     your decisions."
15          That's what Dr. Burns says and that's what
16     Mr. Ellis says.  They don't say you have 10 percent
17     control, they don't say you have 50 percent control,
18     but you have 100 percent control of your decisions.
19          Nobody made Mrs. Owens' decisions for her.
20     Nobody could decide for her to choose to smoke, and
21     nobody could choose for her to stop smoking, not
22     Burns, not Martha and not Ken.  Only Mrs. Owens
23     could make her adult decisions.
24          As Mr. Ellis told you, she was going to do what
25     she wanted to do, and there wasn't anything you 3700
1     could say to make her stop.  She had the control and
2     she had the responsibility.  So if you get to that
3     point on the verdict form, I ask you to give
4     Mrs. Owens 100 percent responsibility for her
5     conduct.
6          Now, I've got a couple minutes left.  If you
7     find everything that I've said this afternoon
8     unpersuasive and decide to return a verdict for
9     Mr. Ellis, you'll have to decide on an amount of
10     damages in Question 5, an amount that you want to
11     award him for his mother's death 21 years ago.  And
12     this is hard.  We all feel compassion.  It's sad
13     whenever anybody loses a loved one, and we all wish
14     Mr. Ellis the best, but compassion and good wishes
15     are not reasons to exceed common sense and good
16     judgment.
17          Your instruction will tell you there is no
18     exact standard and that any such award should be
19     fair and just in light of the evidence.  Ms. Shamp
20     didn't suggest an amount.  And it isn't a question
21     of whether the defendant is a big company or not.
22     If you find Reynolds liable, it's a question about
23     what damages Mr. Ellis and his sister have as a
24     result of their mother's death.  And, again, your
25     instruction will say you need to be fair and just in 3701
1     light of the evidence.
2          The evidence you heard was that Mr. Ellis was
3     41 when his mother died and Martha was 43.  The
4     evidence you heard is that this lawsuit wasn't
5     Martha's idea.  The you evidence you heard was that
6     Becky's family doesn't even know about the lawsuit.
7     The evidence you heard is that nobody has sought
8     counseling or grief therapy in the 21 years she's
9     been gone.  You heard no evidence about any expenses
10     that Mr. Ellis or Ms. Schofield have.  And the
11     evidence you heard is that Mrs. Owens was not
12     financially supporting either Ken or Martha at the
13     time of her death and hadn't been for over two
14     decades prior to that.
15          So that's the evidence you have to consider.
16     So if you make an award and you decide to compensate
17     Mr. Ellis, please compensate him based on the
18     evidence you heard, using your common sense and good
19     judgment.
20          Finally, if you get all the way through the
21     verdict form, you have to decide whether punitive
22     damages are warranted.  Now, if we get that far, you
23     will have already fully compensated Mr. Ellis for
24     his mother's death.  Punitive damages are not about
25     compensation or making someone whole.  Punitive 3702
1     damages are about more money for Mr. Ellis.  They
2     are damages in addition to damages that fully
3     compensate him.  They can be awarded only for
4     conduct that was a legal cause of the harms suffered
5     by the plaintiff, and punitive damages cannot be
6     based on the findings.
7          Now, since the plaintiff continues to stress
8     the findings, let me stress this:  And this is in
9     the instructions that the judge gave you this
10     morning on Page 21.  It will tell you:  The Engle
11     findings may not be considered in any way when
12     determining whether punitive damages may be
13     warranted.  You cannot consider the Engle findings
14     in any way to make that determination, not at all.
15          Ms. Shamp said, punitive damages are designed
16     to punish and deter, punish for conduct that is
17     tantamount to reckless disregard for human life.
18     And to prove it, the plaintiff must meet a higher
19     level of proof called "clear and convincing
20     evidence."  Page 20 of your jury instructions talk
21     about it and I pulled it out here.
22          Clear and convincing evidence differs from the
23     greater weight of the evidence in that it's more
24     compelling and persuasive.  It requires evidence
25     that is precise, explicit, lacking in confusion and 3703
1     of such weight that it produces a firm belief or
2     conviction about the matter in issue.
3          When considering this, consider the testimony
4     you've heard.  Consider what you heard from
5     Dr. Proctor.  He told you that Dr. Rodgman at
6     Reynolds used the best available science to identify
7     constituents of cigarette smoke.  His research was
8     excellent.  He didn't keep the research secret.  And
9     the 1964 Surgeon General's Report relied on that
10     research.
11          You heard from Dr. Proctor.  You heard from
12     Dr. Figlar.  Dr. Rodgman was the first person to
13     identify many of the compounds and constituents in
14     cigarette smoke.  He published the methods Reynolds
15     invented to identify the constituents, submitted
16     them to the Surgeon General's committee and even
17     gave a speech to the American Chemical Society
18     talking about them and drawing the compounds.
19          Now, the plaintiff subpoenaed Dr. Figlar to be
20     here.  He's the one witness who wasn't getting paid
21     to be here.  And I'm glad you got to hear from him.
22     And please consider Dr. Figlar's testimony about
23     what he and others before him at Reynolds have done
24     for decades to develop tobacco products that may
25     reduce risk and also talked about what Reynolds has 3704
1     done in his time there.
2          Dr. Proctor also talked about other
3     contributions that the tobacco companies made,
4     Larson, Haag and Sylvette.  Remember the Green
5     Monster?  Said it was a comprehensive account of the
6     world literature, summarized thousands of articles,
7     included information that was both favorable and
8     unfavorable.  And it was also relied upon by the
9     Surgeon General in the 1964 report.  And Dr. Proctor
10     said he still uses not only the Green Monster, but
11     the red one, the blue one and the yellow one.
12          You also heard about Reynolds' cooperation with
13     the public health community.  You heard about the
14     NCI's Tobacco Working Group that Reynolds
15     participated in from ten years, from 1968 until
16     1978, when the government shut it down.  You heard
17     that Reynolds has spent a fortune to make cigarettes
18     less hazardous and develop reduced-risk products.
19          And you heard that Reynolds addressed every
20     suggestion from the public health community.  In the
21     1970s, the low-tar medium-nicotine cigarettes, they
22     were suggested by the Surgeon General, the NCI and
23     Dr. Russell, who you heard was a pioneer in this
24     area.  Reynolds explored those things.
25          And it's interesting because I -- remember, I 3705
1     asked Dr. Figlar, in the Surgeon General's Report --
2     and I held up the 2014.  I'm like, does it tell you
3     in here what to do to make cigarettes safe or safer?
4     And he said no.  If they did, Reynolds would try to
5     do it.
6          And interestingly, while Ms. Shamp read
7     Dr. Figlar lots of quotes from the Surgeon General's
8     reports that had nothing to do with cigarette
9     design, she never asked Dr. Figlar about this chart
10     on cigarette design in the 1979 Surgeon General's
11     Report.  And I know it's really hard to read, but
12     you recall that Dr. Figlar walked you through this,
13     and he talked about all these different efforts that
14     Reynolds had taken, some on their own, some at the
15     suggestion of the public health community and these
16     were efforts designed to try to make the cigarette
17     safer.
18          And where these ones were identified with a
19     plus or two pluses, these are ones that the Surgeon
20     General gave a thumbs up to and said, this is a good
21     development; this is a step in the right direction.
22          In the 1980s, you saw Reynolds' efforts and the
23     focus on -- on cigarettes that heat and didn't burn
24     tobacco, with Premier and then Eclipse.  And you
25     heard that Reynolds still sells Eclipse today, even 3706
1     though they lose money on every pack.  Dr. Figlar
2     told you it's because they're committed to the idea
3     and think it's a step in the right direction.
4          You heard that Reynolds discovered a way to
5     cure tobacco to lower tobacco-specific nitrosamines.
6     You remember how they talked about they noticed the
7     heat exchange and where it was coming back and it
8     was leading to higher tobacco-specific nitrosamines?
9     So Reynolds came up with a way to change it so that
10     it lowered tobacco-specific nitrosamines.  And
11     Reynolds shared their research work.
12          And no matter what Ms. Shamp says now, during
13     the entire time Mrs. Owens was alive, the public
14     health community, including Dr. Burns, encouraged
15     Reynolds to make lower tar and nicotine cigarettes.
16          You also heard about Reynolds' involvement and
17     the -- and the tobacco industry's involvement in
18     publication.  Now, CTR, Dr. Proctor would call it
19     distraction research, but he had to admit that it
20     produced over 7,000 peer-reviewed articles.  It had
21     research on -- it had substantial influence on the
22     public health community.  The grantees were cited
23     repeatedly in the Surgeon General's reports and that
24     the research funded 10 Nobel laureates.
25          You heard about Reynolds' publications that 3707
1     have been cited in -- in the Surgeon General's
2     reports from the first one in 1964 till the most
3     recent one in 2014.
4          And Dr. Figlar told you that Reynolds has taken
5     up dozens of patents, patents that aren't secret,
6     but they're available for anybody to look at.
7          You saw that Reynolds published a big book on
8     Premier, the Premier Monograph, and it published a
9     book called The Biology of Nicotine that talked
10     about nicotinic receptors in the brain.
11          And in addition to traditional cigarettes,
12     Dr. Figlar talked about Reynolds' mission to
13     transform tobacco, other focusing on Snus and
14     e-cigarettes and nicotine replacement therapy.  And
15     they're even now using tobacco technology to develop
16     drugs for diseases such as Ebola.
17          Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a record of a
18     wanton conduct or reckless disregard for human life.
19     This is a record of trying to lower the risks of an
20     inherently risky, but always lawful product.  It's a
21     record of contributing to science that has been
22     recognized by the public health community.  There
23     were some successes and there were some failures,
24     but they tried.  And in trying to lower the risks of
25     an inherently risky -- I'm sorry.  And in trying to 3708
1     lower the risks of an inherently risky, but legal
2     product, it should not be punished or deterred.
3          You also heard of an industry that Reynolds had
4     changed and evolved to take steps in the last couple
5     decades.  You heard that there was an agreement that
6     disbanded the organizations you heard about from
7     decades ago -- the CTR, TI and TIRC.  Those
8     organizations are gone.  The employees you heard so
9     much about, Teague and Horrigan and Rodgman, they
10     long ago left the company and some of them are dead.
11          Ms. Shamp started today by talking about
12     documents.  And one of the things she said is this
13     case is unparalleled because of the amount of
14     documents.  Even though they claim that documents
15     were destroyed, you have an unparalleled amount of
16     documents.  And Dr. Proctor talked about previously
17     secret documents that are secrets no more.  There's
18     a public website with millions and millions of
19     documents available.
20          When this trial is over, if you want to -- the
21     judge will let you -- you can go online, and you can
22     look at any document you want from Reynolds.  It's
23     online.  You can do it in the comfort of your own
24     home.
25          Now, if the company position on smoking and 3709
1     health and addiction throughout the years angers
2     you, Dr. Figlar told you that Reynolds' position
3     changed over a decade ago, when it admitted that
4     smoking caused cancer and was addictive.  And in the
5     past, industry representatives, they would challenge
6     the new Surgeon General's reports, but not anymore.
7     You saw that Reynolds has a link to the newest and
8     even the most recent Surgeon General's reports on
9     its website and refers the public to them.
10          Dr. Proctor talked about industry restrictions,
11     and Dr. Figlar discussed how the many FDA
12     regulations impact his job on a daily basis.
13     Reynolds meets with the FDA scientists and presents
14     to them and other government organizations on
15     product development.  And those organizations
16     haven't told Reynolds, take this out of smoking and
17     make it safe, do this with that, get rid of this
18     combination.
19          Looking at all of this, there's no need to
20     punish or deter for changes that have already taken
21     place over a decade ago.  So if you get to this
22     point and you've already fully compensated
23     Mr. Ellis, I suggest that the evidence doesn't
24     justify awarding more money.  With the higher
25     standard of proof of clear and convincing, I suggest 3710
1     that that standard will not be met.
2          And so if you get to Question 6 --
3          May I have the ELMO, please?
4          Thank you.
5          If you get to Question 6, based on all the
6     evidence you've heard in this case, I submit that
7     your answer should be no.
8          In jury selection, each of you committed to
9     holding the plaintiff to his burden of proof, and if
10     the evidence warranted, committed to your ability to
11     enter a verdict in favor of my client.  At the end
12     of this trial, the evidence compels a verdict in
13     Reynolds' favor on every question.  On the question
14     of the cause of death, on the question of whether
15     Mrs. Owens was addicted and on the question of what
16     was the legal cause of her death, the plaintiff
17     failed to meet its burden.
18          Mrs. Owens made adult decisions on adult
19     matters her entire life.  She persevered and she
20     provided.  She did what she had to do for her
21     family, and she did what she wanted to do for
22     herself.  And one of those decisions was her
23     decision to smoke.  But don't reward the plaintiff
24     by making Mrs. Owens a victim in this lawsuit
25     because of her decisions. 3711
1          This is the only and last chance I get to speak
2     with you.  As the plaintiff had the burden of proof,
3     when I sit down, Ms. Shamp gets to get up and give
4     you a rebuttal.  Because I can't respond to her, I
5     would ask one of you to be my advocate in the jury
6     room.  You've seen throughout the last two weeks how
7     we have responded throughout this trial to give you
8     the other side of the story.  And as you deliberate,
9     I ask you to keep the full story in mind and answer
10     Ms. Shamp as you think I would.
11          Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to end as I've
12     begun every stage of this trial and that's by
13     thanking you.  I have enjoyed having the opportunity
14     to present this case to you.  It is frustrating that
15     I don't get to talk to you personally and -- and get
16     your feelings about this.  But I know you've done
17     your job, I know you've paid attention, and I know
18     you will do the right thing.  And for your service
19     to this community and this county and this process,
20     we thank you very much.
