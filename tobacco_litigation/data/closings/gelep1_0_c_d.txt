2                MS. PARKER:  May it please the Court.
3                Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  I have
4           an opportunity now to talk to you again at the end
5           of the case.  I want to also thank you for your
6           service as jurors here, and I want to thank you on
7           behalf of my client, R.J. Reynolds, and also on
8           behalf of our trial team, John Walker and Ben Hill
9           over here as well.
10                You've all been sitting here day after day.
11           And, you know, it's two weeks tomorrow that you've
12           all been sworn in as jurors.  You've been patient.
13           You've been paying attention and listening to the
14           evidence, and we appreciate it very much.
15                Now, when I gave my opening statement, I told
16           you at the very beginning that I was only going to
17           talk about one person, that this case is about one
18           person and one person only, and that's Alex Gelep.
19           And that's still the case here.
20                This case is about Alex Gelep.  It's about
21           his cancer.  It's about his choices, his smoking,
22           his decisions.  And ultimately this case is about
23           whether the plaintiff here is entitled to recover
24           money damages from Reynolds and from Philip
25           Morris.  That's what we're here about. 34
1                Now, Mr. Acosta said in his opening that
2           Reynolds and Philip Morris is the seller of the
3           cigarettes.  And that's true.  But that's only  4           part of the story.  Our society is fully aware
5           that cigarettes have helped -- have decided that
6           cigarettes should be a legal product for adults
7           who choose to smoke.
8                And I told you in my opening statement
9           cigarettes can cause lung cancer.  We don't
10           dispute that.  Cigarettes can be addictive.  We
11           don't dispute that.  And some people who smoke are
12           addicted.  We don't dispute that.
13                But this case is about Mr. Gelep.  And
14           Congress and our society already knows that
15           cigarettes cause lung cancer and that cigarettes
16           can be addictive.  But we have freedoms here in
17           the United States.  We have freedoms in the
18           United States to engage -- to choose to engage in
19           risky behavior.  We can do that.  We can choose to
20           drink alcohol.  We can choose to smoke cigarettes.
21           We can choose to go snow skiing.  We can choose to
22           race cars.  We can choose not to eat right.
23                Our society allows cigarettes to be sold.
24           And, in fact, you heard the evidence that
25           Mr. Gelep and his wife owned a store where they 35
1           sold cigarettes.  And Mr. Gelep sold cigarettes in
2           that store because he believed that adults should
3           have the right to choose to smoke just like he
4           did.
5                He made the decisions when he wanted to
6           smoke, and he made the decisions when he wanted to  7           quit.  And that's what he told his doctor.  When
8           he wanted to quit, he quit.  When he didn't want
9           to cut down, he didn't cut down.  When he decided
10           to quit, he was able to do that with no
11           assistance.  He was able to quit cold turkey
12           successfully with no assistance.
13                But rather than spend the trial talking about
14           Mr. Gelep, a lot of this case, a lot of what you
15           heard from the plaintiffs has been about cigarette
16           smoking in general terms.  But as I said at the
17           very beginning, we don't dispute cigarettes cause
18           lung cancer.  We don't dispute that cigarettes can
19           be addictive.  But that doesn't answer the
20           question that we're here about today, which is
21           about Mr. Gelep.
22                Now, what I'm going to do this afternoon with
23           my time is talk about Mr. Gelep and to go over
24           what the evidence has been about him.  And you're
25           going to be given a verdict form, Mr. Acosta 36
1           showed you up there on the screen, with that one
2           question.  And ultimately in order to answer this
3           question, you're going to have to consider
4           Mr. Gelep and the circumstances of his life.
5                Now, after the lawyers finish the closing
6           arguments here, Judge Rondolino will give you the
7           instructions on what the law is, like he told you.
8           What I'm going to do is go over what we think
9           those instructions will be and apply those to the 10           evidence that you've heard in this case about
11           Mr. Gelep.
12                First of all, as Judge Rondolino has told you
13           the plaintiff here has the burden of proof.  That
14           means the plaintiff has to prove to you every
15           element of the claim.  Every element of the claim
16           has to be proven to you by the plaintiff.
17                So if we'll break this down, there's three
18           elements here.  There's primary lung cancer,
19           addiction, and legal cause.  All of those have to
20           be proven to you by the plaintiff, and all of
21           those are on the verdict form.  And if the
22           evidence fails to establish any part of that --
23           any part of it, then you should find in favor of
24           Reynolds and Philip Morris.
25                And that's important.  Because if we had -- 37
1           if we had not stood up at all, if we had put up
2           zero evidence in the case, the plaintiff still has
3           to meet their burden of proof.  They have to prove
4           to you everything that's in that question.  But we
5           did put on evidence.  And our evidence shows that
6           not only did the plaintiff fail to prove their
7           case, but they really don't have a case.
8                Now, the threshold issue is whether Mr. Gelep
9           had primary lung cancer.  And by that, I think we
10           all know we're talking about lung cancer that
11           originated in his lung, not cancer that spread to
12           his lung from some other part of his body.  And if 13           the plaintiff cannot meet that threshold issue,
14           the case is over.
15                The plaintiff also has to prove that
16           addiction is the legal cause of Mr. Gelep's
17           illness.  In other words, the plaintiff has to
18           prove that Mr. Gelep was addicted and that his
19           alleged addiction is the reason that Mr. Gelep
20           developed his illness.  But the plaintiff is not
21           going to be able to do that -- has not been able
22           to do that, because even if you assume somehow
23           that Mr. Gelep had cancer caused by smoking, it
24           still can't be said that that was but for the
25           addiction.  There's more than one part here, more 38
1           than one thing the plaintiff has to prove.
2                Now, in order to prove their case, the
3           plaintiffs are asking you to discount Mr. Gelep's
4           own words, what he told his doctors.  They're
5           asking you to discount his own actions, what he
6           did in his life.  And they're asking you to
7           discount the fact that Mr. Gelep believed that
8           other consumers also had the right to choose to
9           smoke.  That's what he believed.  That's what he
10           stood for.  And that's why he sold cigarettes
11           himself.
12                So as I go over the evidence, I think that
13           you'll see the plaintiff here just does not have a
14           case in this case about Mr. Gelep.
15                Now, we've presented evidence to you so that 16           you would get to know Mr. Gelep, you could get to
17           know him as a person, you could get to know his
18           medical situation, you could get to know about his
19           illnesses so that you can make the decisions that
20           are going to be before you here.
21                Remember this medical record.  Mr. Gelep
22           doesn't want to cut down on smoking.  And the
23           doctor who wrote that, Dr. Hansen, who was the
24           older doctor who came whose son is married to
25           Gelep's daughter, on the stand, Dr. Hansen said 39
1           this is what Mr. Gelep told him.
2                Now, as you're considering the case, it's
3           really important to remember what the
4           circumstances are about Mr. Gelep and what the
5           circumstances are not.  This is not a gentleman
6           who tried everything in the book to quit but
7           wasn't able to.  This is not the kind of person
8           who woke up in the middle of the night because he
9           needed a cigarette.  He was not the kind of person
10           who was tormented by smoking, who hated smoking,
11           who wanted to quit but just couldn't.  That is not
12           Mr. Gelep, and there's been no evidence that that
13           describes Mr. Gelep.  And, in fact, the true
14           picture is exactly the opposite.
15                Let me show you these photos.  These are all
16           of Mr. Gelep.  These are all in evidence.  This is
17           a happy gentleman.  This is a happy guy who
18           enjoyed smoking.  He was not somebody who's 19           tormented by smoking.  Some smokers like Mr. Gelep
20           enjoy smoking and they don't want to quit.  And
21           even the plaintiff's experts who came to court
22           agreed to that.  And according to Dr. Seiden, who
23           came to court last Friday and testified,
24           Mrs. Gelep said -- and Mrs. Gelep was the person
25           who knew Mr. Gelep the best -- if he wanted to 40
1           quit smoking, he would quit; if he didn't, he
2           didn't.  It was a matter of what he wanted to do.
3                He was a willing smoker.  He was a willing
4           smoker.  He knew there were health risks to
5           smoking.  He knew that from his own personal
6           experience starting with the kidney cancer back in
7           1969, but those risks weren't important enough to
8           him for him to decide that he didn't want to
9           smoke.  And, again, he said he doesn't want to cut
10           down.
11                Now, this case is not about whether
12           cigarettes can be addictive or whether some people
13           who smoke may be addicted because, as I've said
14           already, they can be.  But unless you yourself
15           want to quit, you're not going to be successful.
16                So you have to look at the circumstances of
17           the particular individual instead of just talking
18           generally about cigarettes or about addiction.
19           And the fact that cigarettes are addictive and
20           maybe that some people who smoke may be addicted
21           is not a question on this verdict form.  It's not 22           something that you're going to have to decide in
23           this case.
24                Let me go now to the first point, and that is
25           the medical case.  And that is that Mr. Gelep did 41
1           not have primary lung cancer.  And that is he did
2           not have cancer that started, that originated in
3           his lung.  The plaintiff has the burden to prove
4           that with evidence.  But for the plaintiff's case,
5           where was the pathology?  Where was the pathology?
6                Dr. Groff testified.  Dr. Groff came -- was
7           the first witness for the plaintiff.  He said he
8           never reviewed the pathology.  He said, I'm just a
9           psychiatrist.
10                Dr. Goldman -- Dr. Goldman is the one from
11           here in Tampa that Mr. Acosta talked about.  He
12           did not even know that there was pathology in
13           existence.  He didn't even know that until I told
14           him.  And, of course, he had no opinion.
15                Dr. Cummings -- now, Dr. Cummings is the
16           expert that Mr. Acosta brought from Buffalo,
17           New York.  He's the one who was the public health
18           specialist who started a stop -- ran a
19           stop-smoking clinic.  Dr. Cummings said he was not
20           qualified beyond public health epidemiology.  He
21           had not reviewed the pathology.
22                Dr. Dunn, who is the first one of the
23           treating physicians who came that Mr. Acosta
24           called -- now, Dr. Dunn is the one who performed 25           that bronchoscopy procedure where they went in and 42
1           got the tissue.  And Dr. Dunn said he didn't look
2           at it.  He sent it to a pathologist.  And, also
3           Dr. Dunn, recall, did not even know that Mr. Gelep
4           had kidney cancer or had cancer that was in his
5           abdomen -- in his abdominal fluid.  I had to tell
6           him that on cross when I asked him questions.  He
7           didn't even know that.  He treated him for a very,
8           very limited period of time.
9                And then Dr. Hansen, again, the elderly
10           doctor whose son is married to the Gelep girl, he
11           said he never reviewed the pathology either.
12                So ask yourselves.  The plaintiff has the
13           burden of proof.  Why didn't the plaintiff bring
14           the pathologist to testify?  We had to bring the
15           pathology to court.  We had to introduce this
16           evidence, what's left over, of the pathology.  And
17           it's marked, and it's in evidence.
18                Now, Dr. Bennett, who came to court Monday,
19           yesterday, and he -- he looked under the
20           microscope and he showed you -- he demonstrated to
21           you what the pathology shows us about Mr. Gelep's
22           cancers.  And Mr. Gelep had multiple cancers.
23           Remember this chart.  He had kidney cancer back in
24           1969.  He was operated on in early 1970.  He had
25           kidney cancer again in 1996.  He had colon cancer 43 also in 1996.  And, again, this is all that same
2           general area of your body.  He had cancer in his
3           peritoneal fluid that was all throughout his
4           abdominal cavity.  And he had cancer located in
5           his lung.  But that cancer came from elsewhere.
6           It did not start with his lung.  And the key point
7           is where that cancer originated.  You need to know
8           where a cancer originated in order to determine
9           what caused it.
10                And I know you-all have heard this several
11           times throughout the trial, but if the cancer
12           starts in your kidney, it's called a kidney
13           primary or primary kidney cancer.  If a cancer
14           starts in your colon, it's called a primary colon
15           cancer.  If it starts in your lung, it's called
16           primary lung cancer.  But a cancer that starts
17           somewhere else in your body and then spreads to
18           your lung is not a primary lung cancer.
19                The bottom line here is that Mr. Gelep did
20           not have cancer caused by smoking.  His cancers --
21           his multiple cancers, were all connected.  They
22           were all related to the same disease process
23           caused by his genetic defect.  That's what caused
24           him to have these cancers located all over.  None
25           of Mr. Acosta's witnesses had reviewed the 44
1           pathology, and none of them had reviewed the
2           genetic DNA background to this.  3                And in addition, besides not bringing a
4           pathologist, the plaintiff did not take steps to
5           preserve evidence that would have been useful in
6           this case.  There could have been medical tests
7           conducted when Mr. Gelep was alive, but he refused
8           some of those tests, and he didn't have others.
9           Remember he didn't have a colonoscopy.  He refused
10           the chest X-ray.  He refused a rectal exam.
11                There could be tests done on tissue samples
12           from his lung, but this is all we have.  The lung
13           tissue was not preserved.  There could have been
14           tests on his body, on his tissue through an
15           autopsy, but the family did not have an autopsy.
16                Those are three different opportunities that
17           the plaintiff had.  But instead, they're coming to
18           court and asking you to speculate that Mr. Gelep's
19           lung cancer started in his lung and was caused by
20           smoking.
21                And that's particularly troubling here when
22           you consider that the Gelep's son Paul -- Paul
23           Gelep is a lawyer.  And you've heard the evidence
24           that he's the person who was behind filing the
25           lawsuit.  He signed the complaint.  He met with 45
1           the doctors.  He attended the depositions.  And,
2           remember, he named himself as the beneficiary of
3           the complaint.  At first he said he didn't know
4           that.  Remember I got the complaint and I showed  5           it to him to refresh his memory?  And then he
6           agreed.  He signed the complaint that started this
7           lawsuit that named himself as a beneficiary.
8                And, ladies and gentlemen, less than a week
9           before this trial started, Paul Gelep prepared a
10           document that you have not seen yet.  This is a
11           document that his mother signed as the personal
12           representative of his father's estate and it
13           transfers property, real estate, from the estate
14           to herself.  That is an official exhibit.  It's an
15           official court document that's going to be in
16           evidence that you can take back with you to the
17           jury room.
18                So now on the one hand, the plaintiff is
19           saying she has the capacity to sign legal
20           documents that are filed in court transferring
21           property on March 4th, less than a week before
22           this trial started, but on the other hand, you
23           heard Mr. Acosta say during his opening that she
24           was confused.  And that's their excuse as to why
25           you should discount what she said.  So I encourage 46
1           you, when you go back to the jury room and
2           deliberate, look at this document that's in
3           evidence.
4                Now, we are -- I said this in my openings.
5           We are very sorry that Mr. Gelep had cancer.  And
6           it's always a tragedy when you lose a family
7           member.  The judge is going to -- Judge Rondolino  8           is going to give you the legal instructions, and
9           that includes an instruction that you should not
10           be swayed from the performance of your duty by
11           prejudice, sympathy, or any other sentiment.  So I
12           ask you to focus on the facts as you're evaluating
13           this evidence.
14                Now, this has been a long trial.  It's been
15           two weeks now, and you've heard a lot of evidence.
16           But I just cannot emphasize this enough.  If the
17           plaintiff has not met her initial burden to prove
18           that Mr. Gelep had cancer -- primary lung cancer,
19           cancer that originated in his lung, then the case
20           is over.  They did not call a pathologist, and
21           they did not preserve all the tissue.
22                Now, Mr. Geraghty, on behalf of Philip
23           Morris, and I have both said in our opening
24           statements, and I've said again this afternoon,
25           cigarettes can cause lung cancer.  And there are 47
1           many parts of our society that are involved and
2           engaged in selling cigarettes because they believe
3           that the public has a right to choose.  And even
4           the plaintiff's own witnesses, their own experts
5           agree you can't look at statistics alone.
6           Statistics can only tell you about a population as
7           a whole, but they can't tell you about a
8           particular individual like Mr. Gelep.
9                Now, Dr. Cummings -- again, he's the one who
10           came from Buffalo, New York, and he said his 11           specialty was epidemiology.  And I asked him and
12           he agreed that that's the study of populations,
13           not the study of individuals.
14                So the plaintiff's position is, well, he had
15           cancer -- their position is he had cancer -- they
16           found the cancer in his lung.  So that's it.  He
17           was a smoker, so it must have been caused by
18           smoking.  But that is not consistent with the
19           facts here.  And the statistics and general
20           statements alone can't satisfy the plaintiff's
21           burden of proof.
22                Let me give you an example about why you
23           can't rely on general statements and statistics.
24           If you looked at ten people -- just randomly ten
25           people and you knew they had died, if you looked 48
1           at just statistics, that would mean that six or
2           seven out of those ten people passed away from
3           heart disease, because that's six or -- 60 to
4           70 percent of people die from heart disease.  So
5           if that's all you knew as the statistics, the
6           general information, you can say, here are ten
7           people who have passed away; six or seven of them
8           must have passed away from heart disease.  But if
9           you look at the specific facts of those
10           individuals instead of looking just generally, if
11           you look at those people, those ten people could
12           have been on an elevator that fell 20 floors and
13           all ten of them passed away not because of heart
14           disease, but from the injury of the elevator 15           crash.
16                You can't just consider these general
17           statements about cigarettes causing lung cancer.
18           Pardon me.  You have to look at the individual,
19           about Mr. Gelep.
20                Now, Mr. Gelep had cancer in his abdomen that
21           started in his colon.  You have two parts to your
22           colon.  There's the small intestine and the large
23           intestine.  You heard Dr. Bennett say the most
24           likely origination point here was his colon, his
25           large intestine.  And that cancer spread 49
1           throughout his body.  And the medical term for
2           that is metastasize.
3                And one of the places it spread was his
4           abdominal fluid, his peritoneal fluid.  And that's
5           throughout your abdomen.  It goes all the way from
6           your diaphragm all the way down to your colon.
7           Cancer cells were found in that abdominal fluid,
8           and here's the report that shows that.  You've
9           seen that before.
10                Both the plaintiff's experts, Dr. Goldman and
11           Dr. Hansen agree Mr. Gelep had cancer in his
12           abdominal fluid.  There's the report.
13                Now, there were tests done on those cells
14           that came -- those cancer cells that came out of
15           his abdominal fluid.
16                If we could pull that up. 17                That's the report about the special staining
18           that Dr. Bennett told you about, the special
19           staining here including this CEA stain that was
20           done by Mr. Gelep's treating doctors on the cancer
21           cells that came from his abdominal fluid.  And
22           those tests were strongly positive -- called it
23           strong positivity for this CEA.  As Dr. Bennett
24           explained, 95 five percent of colon cancers stain
25           positive for CEA. 50
1                One key issue in this case are those stains,
2           because they show colon cancer was in -- had
3           already spread and was in his abdominal fluid.
4           But Mr. Acosta and the plaintiff did not bring an
5           expert to talk about those stains.
6                Dr. Bennett testified yesterday -- and I'm
7           going to go over his qualifications very briefly.
8           He's a medical doctor, pathologist, forensic
9           medical examiner, completed over 8,000 autopsies.
10           He's the only witness in this case who's qualified
11           to answer the questions here about the pathology,
12           about the staining, and about the big picture of
13           what happened.
14                Now, Dr. Bennett prepared this list over here
15           that he showed you yesterday, and I want to go
16           over that briefly.  This is why Mr. Gelep did not
17           have primary lung cancer.  First of all, where it
18           was located.
19                If we could pull up that. 20                The expert report say it was in the
21           parenchyma, which is the tissue part of the lung.
22           It was not found in his airways.  And that's where
23           primary lung cancer usually starts.
24                The cell type is the second thing that
25           Dr. Bennett listed.  The pathologist who reviewed 51
1           the tissue from the lung -- because that tissue is
2           no longer available.  That's not what's in these
3           boxes.  They said that all they could -- all they
4           could say is that it's non-small cell.  They could
5           not go further and say a particular type.
6                Non-small cell is most consistent with this
7           being a metastasis as opposed to being a primary
8           lung cancer.  Most colon cancers are non-small
9           cell.  And if this had been a primary lung cancer,
10           his doctors would have been able to determine
11           exactly what cell type it is instead of just
12           saying this general non-small cell description.
13                The third thing is the pattern of spread.
14           You heard Dr. Bennett talk about the footprint and
15           about the way it spread.  The cancer spreads up.
16           It can't spread down using the body's pathways
17           that Dr. Bennett explained to you.  It's very
18           uncommon for lung cancer to spread without first
19           going to all those lymph nodes.  And here there's
20           only a suggestion that it pushed up against one of
21           them.  But there's plenty of evidence that his
22           cancer in his abdominal area had a footprint to go 23           to his lung.  First of all, that's where the blood
24           goes and also the direct extension that
25           Dr. Bennett told you about. 52
1                Number four, the symptoms.  How many times
2           have we seen this record?  When Mr. Gelep went to
3           the doctor in January, he told his doctor, cough,
4           nausea, diarrhea, seven-and-a-half-pound weight
5           loss.  Nausea, diarrhea, and weight loss are all
6           symptoms of colon cancer.
7                Do you recall that when Dr. Goldman, the one
8           from Moffitt here in Tampa, was on the stand and
9           he at first disagreed with that.  And then I asked
10           him what was on the Moffitt Cancer website, and
11           then he finally agreed those are symptoms of colon
12           cancer.
13                And number five is the pathology staining
14           that we talked about, the CEA stain.  That shows
15           this is a cancer that did not start in his lung,
16           that spread there from his colon.
17                Those five reasons show why Mr. Gelep had
18           colon cancer that spread to his lung, not a
19           primary lung cancer.
20                Now, why is there nothing in the medical
21           records about colon cancer?  When Mr. Gelep got
22           sick in January of 1996, he went to his doctors.
23           That's when he told them he had those symptoms,
24           and they ran tests.  And they found right there in
25           January he already had cancer located in his lung,
EXCERPT - CLOSING STATEMENTS 3-24-09 53
1           located in his kidney, located in his abdominal
2           fluid, and he was terminal.  It was inoperable,
3           and there was nothing that they could do other
4           than treat the symptoms.  And so his doctors had
5           no reason -- they had no medical reason to conduct
6           tests to find out exactly where this cancer
7           started or what caused it.
8                And I also wanted to mention, in these
9           medical records from the plaintiff, this
10           Exhibit 508 here, there is inconsistency from his
11           doctors -- from his treating doctors over what
12           kind of cancer that Mr. Gelep had.  Some records
13           say he had kidney cancer from 1969/1970, 20 years
14           ago, that metastasized -- that's "mets" -- to his
15           lung and to his kidney.  You can go through those.
16                And one doctor said the cells from the cancer
17           in the peritoneal fluid looked more like the
18           kidney.  So even under these medical records from
19           his doctors who weren't even looking for it, the
20           cancer in Mr. Gelep's lung didn't start there.
21           Even under these records that the plaintiff has
22           put in evidence, these doctors say this was kidney
23           cancer that spread to his lung, that is not
24           primary lung cancer.
25                Now, remember Dr. Bennett talked yesterday 54 about the role of fire fighters.  And I hope
2           you-all remember that.  He said fire fighters are
3           like the treating doctors.  They're the ones who
4           get there on the scene and they've got to put the
5           fire out.  And that's what Mr. Gelep's treating
6           doctors did.  He came to them, he was sick, and
7           they took care of him.  They treated him.
8                But Dr. Bennett is like the fire
9           investigators who come in after the fact and sort
10           through everything to determine what happened and
11           what started the fire.
12                Remember this:  Mr. Gelep never had a
13           colonoscopy.  Every witness has agreed that a
14           colonoscopy is the best way to determine whether
15           or not somebody has colon cancer.  But he never
16           had one.  His doctors never did that.  He also
17           refused a rectal exam.  And he also refused a
18           chest X-ray.  Nobody was -- none of his doctors --
19           nobody was looking at the whole picture, and they
20           didn't have any reason to have to.  He was already
21           terminal.  He was already inoperable at that
22           point.
23                But that's what a forensic medical examiner
24           like Dr. Bennett does.  He comes in and he looks
25           at all these different things and he puts the 55
1           pieces together.
2                Now, let me mention again, there is no lung
3           tissue here.  And that's the gold standard.  If  4           they had done an autopsy or they had preserved the
5           tissue from the lung, that lung tissue would be
6           available.  And it could be tested and it could be
7           reviewed under the microscope.  But we don't have
8           that.  And the plaintiff is asking you to
9           speculate without that physical evidence that what
10           Mr. Gelep had was primary lung cancer that started
11           in his lung.
12                Now, let's talk again about colon cancer.
13           Because, remember, Dr. Bennett went over this part
14           with you.  Colon cancer is not caused by smoking.
15           It's associated with genetics, high fat diet, red
16           meat, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, family
17           history, age, chronic colon conditions, and
18           alcohol.  Remember, we went over that yesterday.
19                And Dr. Bennett said the same -- one of the
20           same genetic defects that causes kidney cancer
21           also causes colon cancer.  All of Mr. Gelep's
22           cancers were related to his genetic predisposition
23           for cancer.
24                Now, I want to talk for a minute about his
25           kidney cancer and tell you first and foremost -- 56
1           and you'll see this on the verdict form -- there
2           is no claim in this case that you're going to have
3           to answer a question for about kidney cancer.  The
4           only issue on the verdict form is about primary
5           lung cancer.  There's no claim here on kidney
6           cancer.  7                The first kidney cancer was diagnosed when
8           Mr. Gelep was 42 years old in 1969.  And we've
9           heard a lot of evidence about that.  That's when
10           he had one of his kidneys removed.  And then he
11           was diagnosed with kidney cancer again in 1996
12           when he was 68 years old.  And you've heard that
13           over 50,000 people a year get kidney cancer, many
14           of whom are people who have never smoked.
15                All of these cancers are related because of
16           Mr. Gelep's genetic makeup.  And all the evidence
17           points to this genetic defect that he was born
18           with that caused him to have these cancers.  An
19           individual who develops -- who has that first
20           kidney cancer and then develops a second one, the
21           fact that you have that second kidney cancer is
22           strong proof -- you heard from the witness
23           stand -- strong proof there's a genetic component
24           to it.  And then when you have an individual who
25           has all these different cancers located all these 57
1           different places, that's also evidence of
2           genetics.
3                Now, here's the diagram Dr. Bennett went over
4           showing the cells that contain those genes.  And
5           if you have a genetic susceptibility to cancer,
6           that means that you have a defect in one of those
7           genes.  And Mr. Gelep, as you've heard, was
8           adopted.  So we don't know his family history of
9           cancer.  We don't have any way to find that out. 10           But we do know that family history and genetics
11           plays a significant role in the development of
12           cancer.  And there are DNA tests that could have
13           been performed to show whether Mr. Gelep had this
14           genetic defect, but we can't do that because we
15           don't have that tissue.  We don't have that
16           evidence to run the tests on.  You heard
17           Dr. Bennett talk about that yesterday.  And then
18           there was no autopsy.
19                Even without those tests, though, we know
20           from the evidence we have, that Mr. Gelep's
21           cancers were caused by his genetic defect.
22           Remember this chart that Dr. Bennett prepared.
23           The genetics are 10 to 13 times most likely to be
24           the cause.
25                Now, you may be thinking, well, even if it 58
1           was genetics, his smoking played some role.  And
2           when you hear the instructions on the law from the
3           Court, the Court is going to explain to you that
4           the question is whether addiction to cigarettes
5           that contain nicotine is a substantial
6           contributing cause.  The legal question is not
7           whether smoking played any role, it has to be a
8           substantial contributing cause.  And look at those
9           numbers.
10                So if you apply your common sense to the
11           facts of this case and if you base your decision
12           on this case about evidence about Mr. Gelep that 13           you've heard here in this courtroom, you'll find
14           that the plaintiff has not met the initial
15           threshold burden to show that Mr. Gelep had a
16           primary lung cancer.  And that means the case is
17           over and you would answer no.
18                Again, we didn't have to put up any evidence.
19           The plaintiff has the burden of proof.
20                I want to talk for a minute about the death
21           certificate.  The death certificate was signed by
22           the older doctor who came in, Mr. -- I'm sorry --
23           Dr. Hansen, again, the one whose son is married to
24           the Gelep's daughter.  He signed the death
25           certificate.  And the death certificate says that 59
1           the cause of death was adenocarcinoma of the lung.
2           But remember, there is not a single pathology
3           report, not a one that says that.  All the
4           pathologist could say is that it was non-small
5           cell.  We don't know where Dr. Hansen came up with
6           the idea that it was adenocarcinoma, but there is
7           no evidence in the pathology -- the pathology
8           reports to support that.  He was just wrong.
9                Mr. Gelep's death was caused by this
10           abdominal fluid buildup.  You recall -- and it's
11           in the medical records and Dr. Bennett talked
12           about it yesterday -- the doctors removed two
13           liters -- if you go to the grocery store and buy a
14           bottle of Coke -- we're talking about two liters
15           that were removed on one occasion and four liters 16           that was drained on a different occasion.  That's
17           a lot.
18                And so when you get to this question, again,
19           on the verdict form, the plaintiff has to prove
20           that but for the cigarettes that Mr. Gelep smoked,
21           this injury would not have occurred.  And the
22           plaintiff is not going to be able to meet this
23           initial threshold issue of establishing that there
24           was a primary lung cancer.
25                Let me turn now to the next issue in the 60
1           case, and that is, did Mr. Gelep smoke because he
2           couldn't quit or because he could quit and just
3           didn't want to?  But before I do that, I want to
4           address something briefly.
5                Mr. Acosta talked a lot about company
6           documents during his opening statement.  He showed
7           you documents that are in evidence here.  What do
8           those documents have to do with Mr. Gelep?  Ask
9           yourselves that.  And are these documents finals
10           or are they drafts?  One of the documents that
11           Mr. Acosta just showed you, which is
12           Exhibit 545 -- it's not a good quality copy -- it
13           has a notation at the top that Mr. Acosta didn't
14           show you.  If you fill that in, it says "Draft."
15           This is a draft.
16                So when you are looking at the company
17           documents, look at them carefully and ask, what do
18           they have to do with Mr. Gelep?  Are you just 19           being shown a cherry-picked sentence or two out of
20           a document?  What do the documents have to do with
21           the cigarettes that Mr. Gelep smoked?  My point
22           is, you need to look at the whole picture, not
23           just a cherry-picked sentence or two out of a
24           document that's marked "Draft."
25                All right.  Let me talk now about addiction. 61
1           Mr. Gelep's death was not caused by an addiction
2           to cigarettes, it was caused by something else.
3           It was caused by his choice to smoke even though
4           he knew he was capable of quitting, because he did
5           quit.  The best evidence there is about whether a
6           smoker can quit is whether they were able to quit,
7           whether they did quit.
8                We know Mr. Gelep was able to quit because he
9           did quit here, and that's documented in the
10           medical records.  The evidence is that he quit at
11           least four times in his life.  He quit in 1969
12           when he was diagnosed with kidney cancer.  He quit
13           cold turkey.  In 1974, he quit.  And that's when
14           the attorney's son, Paul, testified that they had
15           met for a Duke-Florida homecoming game and his
16           father had quit then.  In 1987, he quit for six
17           months.  And this is when the son, Paul, sent the
18           letter from the grandson.  This is Mr. Acosta's
19           letter that's in evidence where Mr. Acosta says
20           the longest time he quit was in approximately 1987
21           for six months.  And he quit the fourth time in 22           January of 1996 for nine or ten months, and he
23           quit told cold turkey.  Plus, there's this medical
24           record that says he quit for eight years.
25                Mr. Gelep quit for good in January 1996 cold 62
1           turkey when he was diagnosed with cancer.  When he
2           was personally motivated, he could quit with no
3           trouble at all.  But he was never committed to
4           quitting before then.  He didn't want to quit
5           before then.  He told his doctor he didn't want to
6           cut down.
7                How can a smoker's family come to court and
8           ask for money damages when the smoker told his
9           doctor he didn't even want to cut down?
10                Mr. Gelep knew that smoking was risky.  He
11           knew it was bad for his health.  He believed it
12           had caused his kidney cancer back in 1969, but he
13           decided to take those risks because he enjoyed
14           smoking.  What's important in this case are the
15           circumstances of Mr. Gelep's life about his
16           smoking.  And here's what the evidence showed
17           about that.
18                When Mr. Gelep applied himself to things that
19           he cared about, he was successful.  That was
20           consistent throughout his life.  He was a
21           successful man.  He was a strong-willed man.  You
22           heard his son, Paul, say that he was his own man.
23           Nobody could tell him what to do or what not to do
24           in any area of his life, not just smoking.  And he 25           ran his own business.  And obviously you have to 63
1           be an intelligent person -- you have to be smart,
2           savvy to run your own business and be successful
3           at it.  And Mr. Gelep ran a number of businesses.
4           He ran -- the evidence was he ran a deli, a bar, a
5           liquor store.  He ran that sundry shop called
6           Gelep Sundries where he and Mrs. Gelep sold
7           cigarettes.  He invested in and he owned
8           commercial real estate.  He owned an insurance
9           company.  He was an intelligent man, and he
10           enjoyed smoking.
11                His habit was, you heard, to have a cigarette
12           with a cup of coffee in the morning.  Sometimes
13           that was at home.  Sometimes he had his first cup
14           of coffee when he got to work.  And sometimes,
15           remember, he went to a number of restaurants and
16           he met his friends there to have a cup of coffee
17           and a cigarette.  And he enjoyed smoking when he
18           played golf.  And when he decided to quit, he did
19           so instantly, cold turkey, no assistance.  He
20           never tried nicotine gum.  He never tried a patch.
21           He never went to a stop-smoking clinic.  He never
22           tried hypnosis.  He never tried medication.  He
23           never asked a doctor for help.  And he never asked
24           anybody else for help, because he was able to quit
25           easily, with no assistance, cold turkey. 64      This is not somebody who has tried everything
2           in the book over and over and just can't quit.
3           This is somebody who quit as soon as he decided
4           that he wanted to.
5                Mr. Gelep was a willing smoker who smoked
6           despite knowing about the health risks.  And at
7           some points in his life, he chose to smoke and at
8           other points in his life, he chose to quit.
9                And I want to talk for just a minute about
10           when Mr. Gelep smoked.  Remember this Navy record
11           in 1945, doesn't drink or smoke.  Now, the medical
12           records are inconsistent about how long, what long
13           of a period of time Mr. Gelep smoked.  One record
14           says 10 years, another record says 18 years,
15           another record says 30 years, and then the record
16           that says 45 years.  The records are just not
17           consistent, whether it's 10 years or 45 years.
18                But the earliest any record shows Mr. Gelep
19           smoking was 1951 when he was a 24-year-old adult.
20           However long he actually smoked, we know he was
21           able to quit without outside assistance, cold
22           turkey.  And even the plaintiff's own expert,
23           Dr. Cummings, the one from Buffalo, New York, said
24           that.  Dr. Cummings said his definition was --
25           remember this -- six months of no smoking equals a 65
1           quit -- a successful quit.  And under -- this is  2           Mr. Acosta's -- this is the plaintiff's expert.
3           Under the plaintiff's expert's definition,
4           Mr. Gelep successfully quit on at least two
5           occasions, 1987 when he had the six-month quit and
6           1996 when he quit for nine to ten months.
7                You heard from the witness stand that one
8           aspect of whether a smoker is motivated to quit is
9           whether that person is aware of the health risks
10           of smoking.  Mr. Gelep's family and his doctors
11           encouraged him to quit smoking over the years.
12           Did Mr. Gelep know that smoking was risky for his
13           health?  Yes.
14                I want to go over briefly what the evidence
15           was about that.  Mr. Gelep was warned decade after
16           decade from his family and from his doctors that
17           he should quit smoking because of health concerns.
18           He knew smoking was bad for his health, but he
19           chose to smoke anyhow.  He believed it firsthand
20           from his own cancer in 1969.  And you may recall
21           Dr. Seiden said based on reading Mrs. Gelep's
22           deposition, he quit at that time because he didn't
23           want it to kill him.
24                He owned a bar and a liquor store and a
25           sundry shop where he sold cigarettes.  And those 66
1           cigarettes had warnings on the packages.
2           Mr. Gelep sold cigarettes even though he was aware
3           of the risks of smoking because he thought and
4           believed that smokers should have a choice.  5                In 1974, we heard the testimony about
6           Mr. Gelep catching his son John smoking.  Remember
7           that?  John was 17 years old, and he said he was
8           coming out the door and his father was coming in
9           the door and he left his smokes there in the
10           garage, and his father caught him.  And his father
11           left him a note the next day and kicked him out of
12           the house.  That shows -- and he said -- let me
13           add this.  And John Gelep, on the stand, testified
14           that in that note his father told him that he was
15           kicking him out of the house that one of reasons
16           was because smoking was bad for him.  That shows
17           right there Mr. Gelep knew in 1974 that smoking
18           was bad for his health, and he believed that his
19           son had a choice.  And he could have quit smoking
20           if he had wanted to.
21                And Mr. Gelep's doctors told him to quit.
22           Here are four medical records where his doctors
23           told him, discontinue cigarettes, discontinue
24           cigarettes, stop smoking.  By not smoking, you
25           could keep it that way.  And his son Paul told him 67
1           he should quit because of his health over and over
2           again.  And Mr. Gelep was aware of the warning
3           labels that were on the cigarettes that he smoked
4           starting in 1966.
5                We'll put those on the screen.  Warnings were
6           on every single package of cigarettes that
7           Mr. Gelep smoked from 1966 forward.  And he was  8           exposed to that package warning 365 days a year
9           for every year he smoked starting in 1966.  The
10           evidence is overwhelming that Mr. Gelep knew about
11           the health risks of smoking.
12                On those times when Mr. Gelep quit, he was
13           able to function normally.  And that's what he
14           told his doctors.  We need to go by what he said,
15           not what somebody says way after the fact.  He
16           only gained some weight because he ate more.  And
17           he may have been what was described as restless or
18           jittery.  Those are not clinically significant
19           symptoms, nothing like what you hear about as
20           withdrawal.
21                Let's look again at these medical records.
22           These are in Mr. Gelep's own handwriting.  He had
23           quit two weeks before this record.  He quit two
24           weeks before, and he said he was not depressed.
25           Remember when some of the doctors -- some of the 68
1           experts for the plaintiff came in and said, oh, he
2           suffered from depression because he was -- because
3           of withdrawal.  He said he didn't.
4                And then the next record from 1988, his wife
5           did not seem to believe that when he was off
6           cigarettes, he was depressed.  That is nothing
7           that comes close to what's described as withdrawal
8           by the medical doctors.
9                Now, Mr. Gelep usually smoked, according to
10           the medical records, two or three packs a day. 11           But just because somebody smokes two packs a day
12           or three packs a day doesn't mean they can't quit.
13           And we know that.  We have proof positive in this
14           case.  We have proof positive because Mr. Gelep
15           did quit.  This is not a case of somebody who
16           never quit and couldn't quit.  He did quit.  He
17           quit on at least -- at least two occasions.  And
18           the last time he quit, he quit for good in
19           January 1996 and never smoked again.
20                Last Friday we brought to trial Dr. George
21           Seiden who testified.  Remember he the one with
22           two doctor degrees.  He's a medical doctor.  He
23           also has a Ph.D., board certified, treats
24           patients.  And he said that he only called one
25           smoker addicted because he thought it was 69
1           pejorative term.  He didn't like to use that word
2           addicted because if you tell somebody they're
3           addicted, that gives them an excuse.  They can
4           say, oh, I'm addicted.  I can't quit.  And
5           Dr. Seiden said he didn't like to do that.  He
6           didn't like to use that term addicted when
7           describing a smoker.
8                He studied all the records, all the
9           depositions, all the evidence in the case, and he
10           explained that Mr. Gelep did not lose control over
11           his smoking.  It was his decision to smoke and his
12           complete lack of motivation to stay quit.  And
13           that's why he smoked. 14                We know that Mr. Gelep controlled his
15           smoking.  It didn't control him.  We know he
16           controlled his smoking because he didn't smoke in
17           bed.  He didn't smoke in the bedroom.  He didn't
18           smoke until he had his first cup of coffee in the
19           morning.  He didn't smoke at the movies.  He
20           didn't smoke in church.  He sat in the nonsmoking
21           section of restaurants.  And he refrained from
22           smoking wherever it was forbidden like at his son
23           Paul's house.  And he didn't complain about it.
24           That's somebody who can control their smoking.
25           This isn't somebody who can't go to the movies 70
1           because they need to smoke or can't go out and eat
2           at a restaurant unless they were able to smoke a
3           cigarette.  That's not Mr. Gelep.
4                And I said this in my opening and I'm going
5           to say it again.  Actions speak louder than words.
6           Actions speak louder than words.  Mr. Gelep
7           controlled his smoking.  And we know that because
8           of what he did, his own actions in his life.
9                The plaintiff cannot prove that Mr. Gelep was
10           not capable of quitting because he did quit.
11           There was nothing about his smoking that impaired
12           his intelligence.  There was nothing about it that
13           caused him to lose his power of reasoning or his
14           ability to quit if he wanted to.  Mr. Gelep just
15           never made the decision to quit smoking for good
16           until January 1996. 17                And there's not a shred of evidence in this
18           case that he had any of these nicotine receptors
19           that you heard about.  Remember I asked the
20           experts?  There's nothing in any radiology to
21           suggest that and we don't have an autopsy here.
22           There is no physical evidence to support that in
23           this case.
24                In the face of all these warnings that he
25           received over the years from his doctors, from his 71
1           family, from the warning labels on the packages,
2           Mr. Gelep had to make a decision for himself about
3           whether to smoke or not.  And he decided to smoke
4           despite knowing that it was bad for him.  Why did
5           he do that?  Because for Mr. Gelep, with full
6           awareness about the health risks of smoking,
7           Mr. Gelep said -- decided for himself the
8           enjoyment, the pleasure I get out of smoking is
9           worth taking that risk.
10                Everybody makes lifestyle choices.  And many
11           of those choices are made, just like Mr. Gelep
12           did, despite known health risks.  They're made
13           because of these intangible things that you can't
14           measure like enjoyment and pleasure.  That's why
15           some people decide to have a glass of wine or a
16           beer or being a couch potato and not getting
17           enough exercise or not eating the right foods or
18           smoking.  Now, we all don't make the same
19           lifestyle choices.  That's up to the individual. 20           Mr. Gelep made that decision for himself to choose
21           to smoke.
22                And during jury selection, remember you-all
23           were seated out there and I was up here and I
24           asked everybody if you believed that individuals
25           should be permitted to make the choice to smoke 72
1           for themselves.  And all of you said yes.  Whether
2           you agree or disagree with the choice Mr. Gelep
3           made is not the issue.  The issue is whether any
4           of us should second guess the choices that
5           Mr. Gelep made.
6                Some people weigh those benefits of pleasure
7           against the health risks and they say it's not
8           worth it.  And those people don't smoke or they
9           quit smoking.  Other people weigh that and they
10           say, it's worth the risk to me.  And I'm going to
11           smoke.  And I choose to smoke.  And that's what
12           Mr. Gelep did.
13                Now, you heard during the trial there have
14           been a lot of labels used to describe smoking,
15           habit, dependence, addiction.  And you heard that
16           the term addiction has changed over time.  There
17           was one definition in the 1964 Surgeon General's
18           report, and then they changed the definition in
19           the 1988 version of the Surgeon General's report
20           to something different.  But whatever you call it,
21           whatever you label it, it doesn't mean you can't
22           quit.  It doesn't mean that Mr. Gelep couldn't 23           quit.
24                And let me just talk for a minute about
25           nicotine.  You heard from the witness stand 73
1           nicotine occurs naturally in the tobacco plant.
2           And even Mr. Acosta's -- even the plaintiff's
3           experts agreed nicotine does not cause cancer.
4           Nicotine is not a carcinogen.
5                But this case is not about smokers in general
6           and whether nicotine might play a role with
7           respect to some other smokers.  This case is about
8           Mr. Gelep and could Mr. Gelep have quit.  And the
9           answer is, yes, because he did quit.  And there's
10           no stronger evidence that you could have.
11                Was Mr. Gelep's death caused by an addiction
12           to cigarettes?  Is that the legal cause?  And
13           that's the question on the verdict form.  Did
14           Mr. Gelep smoke because he couldn't stop or
15           because he didn't want to stop?
16                The evidence in the case has been that his
17           death was not caused by an addiction to
18           cigarettes, because he was capable of quitting,
19           because he did quit.  And you can't have stronger
20           evidence than that.  He was able to quit when he
21           wanted to cold turkey.  He had control.  When he
22           wanted to stop, he stopped.  When he wanted to
23           start and start smoking, he started.  And he chose
24           not to quit for good until January of 1996.  He
25           was aware of the risks.  And for him, the benefits
EXCERPT - CLOSING STATEMENTS 3-24-09 74
1           of smoking outweighed the risks.  He was willing
2           to take those risks.
3                Now, you've been listening to evidence for
4           two weeks now -- just about two weeks, two weeks
5           tomorrow.  So you ought to have a good idea about
6           Mr. Gelep now and the kind of man he was and the
7           kind of smoker he was.  There's no basis here to
8           conclude that addiction substantially contributed
9           to Mr. Gelep's cancer and that but for any alleged
10           addiction, he would not have gotten cancer.  As
11           Dr. Seiden who testified on Friday put it, there
12           was no clinically significant impairment.
13           Nicotine does not control a person's choice.  And
14           that was true for Mr. Gelep.
15                Mr. Gelep's death was not caused by an
16           addiction to cigarettes.  Mr. Gelep made a series
17           of choices in his life, just like we all make
18           choices where we all take risks that might affect
19           our health.  Mr. Gelep was in control of those
20           choices, and he chose to smoke.
21                That brings us to the verdict form.  And the
22           verdict form, as we've shown you, has one question
23           on it.  You're going to have this back in the jury
24           room.  And it asks, was Alexander Gelep addicted
25           to cigarettes that contained nicotine; and, if so, 75 was such addiction a legal cause of a primary lung
2           cancer and his death?
3                The evidence that you've heard in this case
4           proves that the answer to that should be no,
5           because the plaintiff has not met their burden of
6           proof.  When you're going back and you're
7           deliberating and you're evaluating the case, I'm
8           going to ask you to remember and focus on three
9           key facts.
10                He did not have primary lung cancer.  He did
11           not have cancer that originated in his lung.  He
12           had multiple related cancers all in the abdominal
13           area that spread to his lung, but that is not
14           primary lung cancer.  And smoking was not the
15           cause of those multiple cancers in his abdomen.
16           That was genetics.
17                Number two, Mr. Gelep was able to quit.  We
18           know he was capable of quitting because did he
19           quit.  When he was motivated to quit, he quit cold
20           turkey, no assistance, no trouble at all.
21                And number three, before 1996, in his own
22           words to his doctor, he didn't want to cut down.
23           And Dr. Hansen confirmed that on the witness
24           stand.
25                Now, I've tried with my time this afternoon 76
1           to go over everything that Mr. Acosta mentioned in
2           his closing argument.  But if I have omitted
3           something, if I've forgotten something, don't let  4           the fact that I haven't mentioned it make you
5           think that we're in agreement.
6                Mr. Acosta's going to have another
7           opportunity to talk to you after Mr. Geraghty for
8           Philip Morris finishes.  That's because the
9           plaintiff has the burden of proof, as
10           Judge Rondolino has told you.  And I think you've
11           seen from this trial you need to hear both sides
12           of the situation.  You need to hear both sides of
13           the story, so to speak.
14                So if Mr. Acosta raises something new in his
15           rebuttal, knowing that I can't respond to it, I'm
16           going to ask you to consider two questions.  One
17           is, why didn't he mention it already so I could
18           address it?  And second, knowing the evidence
19           you've heard in the case, how would we have
20           responded if I had had an opportunity to?
21                When you listen to Mr. Acosta's rebuttal,
22           listen carefully and see if you hear answers to
23           any of these questions.  How can the plaintiff
24           prove her case when they didn't have an autopsy?
25           How can the plaintiff prove her case when they 77
1           didn't have all the pathology tissue?  How could
2           the plaintiff proof her case when Mr. Gelep
3           refused some of these medical tests and he didn't
4           have others?  How could the plaintiff prove her
5           case when it's undisputed that Mr. Gelep had
6           multiple cancers located in his body?  How can the  7           plaintiff prove her case when they did not even
8           call a pathologist to testify?  How could the
9           plaintiff prove that Mr. Gelep could not quit when
10           we all know did he quit at least twice, six months
11           in 1997 and nine or ten months in 1996?  How can
12           the plaintiff prove her case when all the evidence
13           is he enjoyed smoking and he smoked because he
14           chose to do that?  How could the plaintiff prove
15           that addiction was a legal cause when you heard
16           from Mr. Gelep himself in the medical records that
17           he did not want to cut down on his smoking?
18           That's what he told his doctor.  And how could the
19           plaintiff prove that addiction prevented him from
20           quitting when he never ever had trouble quitting?
21           When he made up his mind to quit, he quit
22           successfully, cold turkey, no assistance, no
23           trouble.
24                Now, none of us likes to consider or have to
25           consider the truthfulness of anybody.  I mean, 78
1           it's just against our nature.  But as jurors,
2           that's going to be something you're going to have
3           to do.  That's your obligation to consider the
4           witnesses.  And the Court will instruct you --
5           give you an instruction about the credibility and
6           the believability of the witnesses.  And you're
7           going to have to decide for yourselves whether you
8           believe the plaintiff's witnesses when they did
9           not even look at the pathology and at least one of 10           them didn't even know that there was pathology out
11           there.
12                I want to thank you again for your service as
13           jurors here.  I want to thank you again on behalf
14           of myself and our trial team and also my clients,
15           Reynolds.  And I want to ask you when you go back
16           in the jury room to keep your focus on Mr. Gelep.
17           And I also want to ask you to keep something else
18           in mind.  I don't know if you can see from where
19           you're seated here, but behind the court on the
20           wall, there is lady justice on the seal.  You see?
21           She's blindfolded.  And she's blindfolded because
22           when you make up your mind, when you deliberate
23           out there, you should consider the evidence
24           without taking into account sympathy or whether
25           you have any prejudice about any company or anyone 79
1           else.  She's blindfolded so that the decision,
2           what's fair and what's just, is based on the
3           evidence and nothing but the evidence in the case.
4                I want to close with just one final thought.
5           If the plaintiff here can avoid these choices that
6           Mr. Gelep made, then the family of anybody who's
7           used a risky product can also claim that the
8           choice -- that their choices should be
9           disregarded.  You, the jury, stand between us and
10           the question that you have to decide as to whether
11           the family of a smoker who had a disease that had
12           nothing to do with smoking, who enjoyed smoking, 13           who controlled his smoking, who understood the
14           risk of smoking all throughout his life, who told
15           his doctor he didn't even want to cut down, who
16           quit when he decided to quit with no trouble, who
17           didn't preserve the evidence or bring it to court
18           will be able to go forward with their case for
19           money damages.
20                So we're in your hands now.  And we want to
21           just respectfully ask that you follow the law and
22           you listen to the evidence.  And I want to thank
23           you again very much for your attention this
24           afternoon.
25                Your Honor, that concludes my closing. 80
1                THE COURT:  Thank you.
2                Mr. Geraghty?
3                MR. GERAGHTY:  I'm just going to need a
4           couple more minutes to move things around.
5                THE COURT:  Okay.  Then we'll just wait.
6                Anybody need a break or are we good?
7                THE BAILIFF:  You can stand up and stretch,
8           if you want.
9                MR. GERAGHTY:  May I proceed, Your Honor?
10                THE COURT:  Please.
11                MR. GERAGHTY:  May it please the Court.
12                Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
13                Here, again, I'm the last lawyer that's
14           speaking to you, although by my clock it's a
15           little early.  I think typically it's been 4:00 16           that I've normally been able to address you.  So
17           the fact that it's only 3:30, I'm going to look at
18           as an advantage.
19                I won't be the last lawyer to speak to you,
20           as I think you've heard.  Because the plaintiff
21           bears the burden of proof, Mr. Acosta will have
22           one more time to address you.
23                Now, I hope I don't disappoint you when I
24           tell you that I can't promise you that I'll take
25           ten minutes or less.  It's been a long trial, and 81
1           the evidence is such that I simply can't summarize
2           what I believe are the important points in that
3           span of time; but I promise you I won't take any
4           more than about 25 minutes.  And I also can't
5           guarantee it, but I'll try my best not to trip
6           over a cord while I'm up here.
7                Now, on behalf of my client, Philip Morris
8           USA, myself, and I think on behalf of all the
9           lawyers, I just want to thank you for the time
10           that you've spent here with us.  It's been over
11           two weeks.  You've been extremely attentive.
12           You've been very engaged throughout.  And I think
13           I can speak for all the lawyers when I say that we
14           really appreciate your time and your attention
15           over the last two-plus weeks.  It's been a long
16           trial.  I know you're anxious to retire and go
17           deliberate and then hopefully go home, so I'm
18           going to try to address the important points as 19           quickly as I can.
20                Now, this lawsuit is about Alexander Gelep --
21           I think you-all know that at this point -- the
22           kind of man he was, the way he lived his life, and
23           his decision to smoke cigarettes.  And I want to
24           show you the verdict form.  Ms. Parker has already
25           showed it to you, and Mr. Acosta showed it to you. 82
1                Can you-all see that clearly from where you
2           are?
3                And just so you know the case is about
4           Mr. Gelep, the verdict form refers specifically to
5           him.  The question is "Was Alexander Gelep
6           addicted to cigarettes that contained nicotine
7           and, if so, was such addiction a legal cause of a
8           primary lung cancer and his death?"
9                Now, Ms. Parker has already talked to you
10           about the fact that there are three components to
11           this question, and she addressed specifically the
12           issue of whether or not the plaintiff had
13           primary -- the decedent had primary lung cancer as
14           the plaintiff contends or whether he had primary
15           colon cancer as the defendants contend.  I'm not
16           going to address that issue.  I'm going to address
17           the two other parts of the question; was Mr. Gelep
18           addicted to cigarettes that contained nicotine,
19           and if so, was his addiction a legal cause of his
20           death.
21                I talked to you about these three simple 22           truths in my opening statement:  One, Mr. Gelep
23           enjoyed smoking; Two, Mr. Gelep made a personal
24           choice to smoke; three, Mr. Gelep always had the
25           ability to quit smoking.  The evidence you've 83
1           heard over the course of the last week and a half
2           to two weeks supports every single one of these
3           points.  And I would submit to you that these
4           three points help you answer the question on that
5           verdict form.
6                I'm going to spend the time I have talking to
7           you about the evidence you heard and the evidence
8           you did not hear from the three fact witnesses.
9           And specifically I'm referring to Paul Gelep, John
10           Gelep, and their sister Helen Diamandis.  I call
11           them fact witnesses because I want, in your mind,
12           to distinguish them from the expert witnesses you
13           heard testify in the case.
14                I'm also going to talk a little bit about
15           some of the medical records you heard Ms. Parker
16           refer to.  These medical records are key in this
17           case.  Because through his doctors, Alexander
18           Gelep actually speaks directly to us about how he
19           feels, what he wanted to do, what he didn't want
20           to do, and what he intended to do.  And these
21           records represent the only testimony we have for
22           Mr. Gelep himself.
23                Alexander Gelep enjoyed smoking cigarettes.
24           You don't have to take my word for it; you've seen 25           the evidence over the last two weeks.  Ms. Parker 84
1           showed you a series of photographs, all of which
2           are in evidence, and those photographs demonstrate
3           that Mr. Gelep enjoyed his life.  I would
4           encourage you to look at those photographs.  He
5           enjoyed being in the company of his friends and
6           family, and he enjoyed smoking cigarettes.
7                But we have more than just pictures, we have
8           the testimony of Mr. Gelep's oldest son, Paul.
9           What did Paul tell you?  Paul said that his father
10           was the kind of man who, quote, never met a
11           stranger.  Never met a stranger.  He told you his
12           father would spend time socializing with friends
13           and family, enjoying a cup of coffee, and smoking
14           cigarettes.  Those are three things -- three
15           things that Alexander Gelep enjoyed to do.
16                In fact, Paul told you about the different
17           places on Clearwater Beach where Mr. Gelep would
18           go to meet his friends, drink coffee, and
19           socialize.  The Island House Restaurant, Young's
20           (phonetic) Pit Barbecue, and McDonald's on
21           Clearwater Beach.  During these visits Mr. Gelep
22           and his friends would talk about the day's events,
23           what was happening in their lives, and he would
24           enjoy a cup of coffee and smoking cigarettes.
25                There's no doubt that Mr. Gelep was a 85 personable, outgoing, and friendly man who chose
2           to spend time doing the things he enjoyed; and
3           smoking cigarettes was one of those things.
4           Mr. Gelep made a personal choice to smoke
5           cigarettes.  He was an informed smoker.  He
6           understood that there were significant health
7           risks associated with cigarette smoking.
8                We know that his wife Mary quit smoking in
9           the mid 1960s in response to the 1964 surgeon
10           general's report.  For years his son Paul preached
11           to him about the dangers of cigarette smoking and
12           urged him to quit.  And the evidence is clear that
13           despite being informed of the risks of cigarette
14           smoking, Mr. Gelep chose to continue smoking.  You
15           haven't heard any evidence to suggest that
16           Mr. Gelep did not understand the health risks
17           associated with cigarette smoking.
18                To the contrary, what we've learned about
19           Mr. Gelep over the last couple of weeks is that he
20           was an intelligent and successful businessman who
21           made a decision to smoke cigarettes.  As his son
22           Paul said from the witness stand, he said, quote,
23           my father, quote, had his opinions about things,
24           and he had his views.  That was Paul from the
25           witness stand. 86
1                You heard that both Dr. Hansen, who testified  2           here, and Dr. Smitherman told Mr. Gelep on a
3           number of occasions that he should cut down or
4           quit smoking.
5                Ms. Parker showed you the medical record from
6           1994 where Dr. Hansen wrote that Mr. Gelep told
7           him that he did not want to cut down on smoking.
8           Dr. Hansen testified here live right before you.
9           Mr. Acosta himself asked him very pointedly, did
10           Alexander Gelep tell you that he did not want to
11           stop smoking?  And Dr. Hansen, without batting an
12           eye, told you, yes, he did say that.  That comes
13           directly from Dr. Hansen.
14                Alexander Gelep always had the ability to
15           quit smoking.  He always had the ability within
16           himself to quit smoking when he decided it was
17           time to do so.  And how do we know that?  Because
18           he did.  Because he did.  He quit smoking on
19           several occasions, and you've heard all about that
20           during the course of the evidence.  And each time
21           he quit, he did it cold turkey, without any
22           assistance whatsoever.
23                Paul Gelep told us about several different
24           times that his father quit smoking.  You heard
25           that he quit in 1969 when he was first diagnosed 87
1           with kidney cancer.  You also heard from Paul that
2           in the fall of 1974, he saw his father in
3           Gainesville and his father was not smoking at the
4           time.  Paul wasn't sure why his father had quit  5           smoking at that point, but what we do know is that
6           Alex Gelep quit smoking for a period of time and
7           then later that year decided to resume smoking
8           again.
9                Alexander Gelep quit again in 1987.  You've
10           heard about him receiving a letter from his
11           grandson.  Reading that letter motivated Mr. Gelep
12           to quit once again in 1987.  The evidence shows
13           you that he quit for at least six months and maybe
14           longer.  And the evidence you also heard from Paul
15           was thereafter, his father told him that he wanted
16           to start smoking again.
17                In January of 1996, two weeks before he
18           learned that he had lung cancer, Mr. Gelep once
19           again decided to quit smoking, and this time he
20           quit for good.  This time he quit for good.
21           According to Paul, he never smoked another
22           cigarette again.  That's Paul's testimony.  He
23           quit cold turkey.  And you saw the record -- I
24           won't put it up there again, because Ms. Parker
25           has already showed it to you.  But when he went to 88
1           see Dr. Dunn two weeks after he quit smoking, he
2           didn't report a single significant withdrawal
3           symptom -- not a single significant withdrawal
4           symptom.
5                Is there any reason why Mr. Gelep could not
6           have made the decision to quit for good at some
7           earlier point in his life?  Is there any reason  8           why?  The evidence shows that the answer is
9           absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  Mr. Gelep always
10           had the ability within himself to quit smoking
11           whenever he was motivated to do so, and the proof
12           is that he did.
13                Now, you may recall from my opening statement
14           that I told you you would hear evidence that the
15           single most important factor that determines
16           whether somebody's going to be successful of
17           quitting smoking is motivation.  Motivation.
18                And who did you hear that from?  Well, you
19           heard it from Dr. Seiden, for one, but you also
20           heard it from Dr. Michael Cummings, the expert
21           that the plaintiff brought to the courtroom.
22           Dr. Cummings and Dr. Seiden both agree that
23           motivation is the single most important factor in
24           determining whether a person can successfully quit
25           smoking.  And then after motivation is 89
1           persistence.
2                Now, during my opening statement I also
3           talked to you about three questions.  Three
4           questions.  I told you about three questions from
5           the American Cancer Society.  You may recall this
6           is a pamphlet called Smart Move published by the
7           American Cancer Society.  It's actually written by
8           Dr. Cummings himself, the same Dr. Cummings who
9           testified in this case.  Dr. Cummings told you-all
10           that this was one of the most widely distributed 11           stop-smoking pamphlets in the country.
12                And one of the questions that Dr. Cummings
13           and the American Cancer Society asks:  Number one,
14           do you want to stop smoking?  Number two, are you
15           willing to make some changes in your daily
16           routine?  And number three, are you willing to put
17           up with some uneasy moments after stopping?  And
18           if you can answer yes to all three of those
19           questions, according to the American Cancer
20           Society and Dr. Michael Cummings, the plaintiff's
21           own expert, you can quit smoking.  You can quit
22           smoking.
23                Could Mr. Gelep have answered these three
24           questions?  Of course he could.  Of course he
25           could.  And could he have answered them at any 90
1           point in his life that he decided that that was
2           the time to stop smoking?  Absolutely.
3                Now, have you heard any evidence to
4           contradict what I've just told you?  Have you
5           heard any testimony from Paul or John or Helen
6           Diamandis to dispute these three things?
7                Significantly, you didn't hear any evidence
8           from any one of Mr. Gelep's children to dispute
9           that he could have quit smoking whenever he was
10           sufficiently motivated to do so.  None of them
11           testified that their father said he was addicted.
12           None of them testified that he said he wanted to
13           quit smoking.  None of them testified that he 14           tried and failed to quit, ever.  They never said
15           No, our father, he didn't enjoy cigarette smoking.
16           You heard no testimony from them to that effect.
17                And after Mary Gelep -- aren't they the ones
18           who knew their father best?  And if they truly
19           believed that their father was hopelessly addicted
20           and incapable of quitting smoking, don't you think
21           you would have heard them testify to that fact on
22           the witness stand?  You didn't hear anything of
23           the sort from them.  Instead, all you heard them
24           talk about were the specific brands of cigarettes
25           that their father smoked. 91
1                And I want to spend a few minutes talking
2           about this testimony, because it's important.
3           It's important because it goes to the issue of
4           credibility, the believability of the witnesses.
5           And I won't put it back up there, but you saw the
6           instruction that Ms. Parker showed on the screen.
7           That's an instruction you're going to receive from
8           Judge Rondolino.  And you will be the judges of
9           the believability of the witnesses in the case.
10                You may recall that I told you in my opening
11           statement that members of the Gelep family were
12           going to come in here and change their testimony
13           about when their father smoked Marlboro Light
14           cigarettes.  And you saw it happen right here in
15           this courtroom.
16                Why this sudden change in their testimony? 17           Well, perhaps it was because Paul Gelep knew that
18           his mother had provided sworn answers under oath
19           that his father only smoked Marlboro Lights from
20           1990 to 1996, and he was concerned that they would
21           be unable to prove their case against Philip
22           Morris.
23                So let me remind you of the evidence that you
24           heard.  And as you listen, consider whether you
25           can believe the changed testimony you've heard 92
1           from John and Paul Gelep.
2                You heard from the witness stand, John and
3           Paul testify about a matter that contradicted Mary
4           Gelep's sworn interrogatories.  In those sworn
5           answers she said that her husband smoked Marlboro
6           Lights from 1990 to 1996.  Paul prepared those
7           answers originally back in 1999, and then Mary
8           swore to them under oath in 2001.  Paul testified
9           that before he prepared those answers, he checked
10           with his mother, he checked with his brother John,
11           and he checked with his three sisters, including
12           Helen Diamandis.  Paul testified he would never
13           have had his mother sign that answer under oath,
14           back when their memories were fresh, if he didn't
15           believe the answer she gave was honest, truthful,
16           and accurate.
17                Paul confirmed the accuracy of those answers
18           as recently as December 2008 when he gave a
19           deposition in this case.  That's just three months 20           ago.  Then in this courtroom they told you a
21           different story.
22                They told you that they believed their father
23           started smoking Marlboro Lights in the 1970s.
24           They told this new story based upon two
25           photographs that they claim show their father with 93
1           packs of Marlboro Light cigarettes.  These two
2           photos have been admitted into evidence.  They're
3           Plaintiff's Exhibit 662 -- I believe this one is
4           M, and this is 662-K.  These are those two
5           photographs.
6                John flatly admitted that the photograph of
7           he and his father and his girlfriend from
8           Las Vegas doesn't depict a pack of Marlboro
9           Lights.  He flatly admitted that.  Paul, on the
10           other hand, said he thought this particular photo
11           that shows a New Year's day cake, 1980, he thought
12           this showed a pack of Marlboro cigarettes.  Paul
13           said he and his brothers blew up these photographs
14           on March the 8th, 2009, the day before this trial
15           started.
16                Now, Paul did not bring the blown-up versions
17           of the photographs, but we have them now.  They've
18           been introduced into evidence as Defendant's
19           Exhibit G, H, and I.  And I encourage you to take
20           a look at them.
21                And what you'll see when you look at the
22           back, is that on the very -- on the back of the 23           photograph, it indicates that these photographs
24           were created at a Ritz Camera on March the 8th,
25           2009 by Paul Gelep and his brother John and his 94
1           sisters.
2                What else did Paul and John not show you?
3           Well, they didn't show you a photograph taken of
4           their father at about the same time on a boat.  We
5           introduced that photograph into evidence.  I
6           believe it's Defendant's Exhibit A.  The
7           photograph is on your left-hand side.
8                This is the photograph we admitted into
9           evidence, and we showed the photograph to both
10           Paul and John.  And on the right-hand side is a
11           photograph -- a picture of True cigarettes.  John
12           and Paul both admitted that the pack of cigarettes
13           in their father's left breast pocket has a
14           circular blue emblem that looks an awful like --
15           an awful lot like a pack of True cigarettes.  True
16           cigarettes were not manufactured by either Philip
17           Morris or the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.
18                We've introduced some other photographs that
19           show Mr. Gelep with packages of cigarettes in a
20           left breast pocket that look like True Cigarettes.
21           This photo was taken in 1979 or 1980, about the
22           same time that Paul and John told you about the
23           two other photographs.
24                Finally, I want to remind you that John
25           testified under oath twice before this photo
EXCERPT - CLOSING STATEMENTS 3-24-09 95
1           jogged his memory -- excuse me, before this photo
2           jogged his memory, John Gelep testified twice that
3           his father was smoking True cigarettes in 1979 or
4           1980.  Take a look at the two photographs; the
5           only two photos that John and Paul brought to
6           support their changed testimony.  Paul told you
7           that they had hundreds and hundreds of photographs
8           of their father.  And of those hundreds and
9           hundreds of photographs, these are the two
10           photographs they brought you to support their
11           changed testimony.  You decide -- take a look at
12           these photographs when you go back and deliberate,
13           and you decide whether these photographs show a
14           package of gold and white Marlboro Lights.
15                So why do we have the sudden change in
16           testimony on the eve of trial?  I would submit
17           again that it's because Paul Gelep was concerned
18           that there was insufficient evidence that his
19           father smoked Marlboro Lights long enough to be
20           the cause of his father's death; that 1990 to 1996
21           was too little too late.  Did John and Paul
22           testify truthfully from that stand?  Well, that's
23           for you to decide.  You're the judge of the facts
24           in the case, and you can accept or reject the
25           testimony as you deem appropriate. 96      Now, frankly, I'll tell you now, there is no
2           question on the verdict form in this phase of the
3           case that asks you to decide what brands of
4           cigarettes Mr. Gelep smoked.  This will only be
5           relevant in Phase Two of the case, if you even get
6           that far.  I don't think you will based upon what
7           has happened in this phase.
8                But this changed testimony is important,
9           again, because it goes to the issue of
10           credibility.  Remember that the experts brought by
11           the plaintiffs relied upon the deposition
12           testimony of Paul and John Gelep.
13                And also remember Dr. Groff, the very first
14           witness you heard for the plaintiff who said that
15           Mr. Gelep was addicted, who did he rely upon?  He
16           told you that he interviewed Paul and John Gelep.
17           That was the basis for his opinion that Mr. Gelep
18           was addicted.
19                Now, Mr. Acosta spent a lot of time talking
20           about Dr. Farone and all the things that he had to
21           say.  That has nothing to do with Mr. Gelep and
22           the question you're being asked to decide today.
23           It's simply a distraction.  But I need to address
24           it, so let me just say a few things about that.
25                Dr. Farone testified that while he was at 97
1           Philip Morris, he and his coworkers did important
2           research that benefited the customers of Philip
3           Morris.  He also told you that the work he did, in  4           his view, served the public's interest.  He
5           testified that he spent 80 percent of his time --
6           80 percent of his time trying to make safer
7           cigarettes while at Philip Morris.  He said he was
8           proud of the work he did.  Proud of that work.
9           Did he want to leave Philip Morris?  No.  He
10           testified that he was hoping to become vice
11           president of research and development.  That's the
12           position he was hoping to get.
13                But then Dr. Farone was fired; you heard him
14           testify about that.  He was fired because he
15           complained to his coworkers and he threatened to
16           sue the company.  He became angry and bitter
17           because he and his wife did not get promotions
18           that he believed they deserved.  And now you hear
19           him tell a story that's completely at odds with
20           his statement that he expected to spend his entire
21           career at Philip Morris running its research and
22           development department.
23                He talked about ammonia.  But what he didn't
24           tell you is that Philip Morris obtained a patent
25           from the United States government in 1967 based on 98
1           its use of ammonia in cigarettes.  This was no
2           secret.  The government knew about it.  The patent
3           is in evidence.  You can take a look at it.  And
4           as Dr. Farone told you, the government never told
5           Philip Morris or any other tobacco company that
6           they needed to take ammonia or any other  7           ingredient out of their cigarettes.
8                Where is the document from Dr. Farone where
9           when he was employed at Philip Morris he said that
10           ammonia or urea or acid aldehyde made cigarettes
11           more addictive like he testified on that
12           videotape?  Where is that document where he
13           expressed any concern while he was an employee at
14           Philip Morris as to any of those issues?
15           Mr. Acosta didn't show you such a document.  I
16           submit to you he's not going to be able to show
17           you such a document.  So despite the sensational
18           allegations you heard from Dr. Farone on that
19           videotape, Dr. Farone didn't say any of those
20           things while he was an employee at Philip Morris.
21                And at the end of the day, recall what
22           Dr. Farone admitted during his cross-examination.
23           He admitted that despite everything he said on
24           that videotape, he said, quote, I'm not trying to
25           say whether or not one person is more addicted 99
1           than another.  He told you he couldn't say that.
2                He was also asked a very pointed question
3           about all the ingredients that you heard
4           Dr. Acosta talk about.  He was asked, And you
5           can't tell that if there was some substance that
6           increased the rate of absorption by a matter of
7           only milliseconds, that that would make any
8           difference whatsoever in the level of a person's
9           addiction.  Right?  And Dr. Farone said that's 10           correct.  He admitted that was true.
11                More importantly, what does this have to do
12           with the issues in this case?  What does this have
13           to do with Mr. Gelep?  Absolutely nothing.
14           Absolutely nothing.
15                Paul said that Mr. Gelep was a sports fan.
16           Well, there's a saying in sports:  Keep your eye
17           on the ball.  Keep your eye on the ball.  Don't be
18           distracted.  Don't be distracted by things that
19           are not relevant to the case.  So let's look at
20           the evidence that relates specifically to
21           Mr. Gelep; the evidence that shows that he quit
22           smoking for good in 1996 when he was motivated to
23           do so, when he decided it was time to quit.
24                I want to show you the verdict form again,
25           and then an instruction so you understand how the 100
1           two go together.  This one may be hard to read, so
2           let me know if anyone can't -- do I need to move
3           this one closer?  No?  Okay.
4                Let's talk again about the question you're
5           going to be asked to answer in this phase of the
6           case.
7                This is the verdict form.  Again, Ms. Parker
8           has addressed one aspect of it, and that is the
9           medical causation issue.  But I want to talk to
10           you about the second -- the two other parts of the
11           question, whether Mr. Gelep was addicted to
12           cigarettes that contained nicotine, and if so, was 13           such addiction a legal cause of a primary lung
14           cancer and his death.
15                You're going to have to determine this
16           question based on the legal cause instruction that
17           the Court gives you.  Let me read it to you.
18                "Addiction to cigarettes is a legal cause of
19           an injury and death if it directly and in natural
20           and continuous sequence produces or contributes
21           substantially to producing such injury and death
22           so that it can be reasonably said that" -- and
23           this is the key phrase here -- "but for the
24           addiction to cigarettes, the injury and death
25           would not have occurred." 101
1                "But for" -- those are the key words.  The
2           instruction continues:
3                "In order to be regarded as a legal cause of
4           injury and death, addiction to cigarettes need not
5           be the only cause.  Addiction to cigarettes may be
6           a legal cause of injury and death even though it
7           operates in combination with the act of another,
8           some natural cause or some other cause if such
9           other cause occurs at the same time as the
10           addiction to cigarettes and if the addiction to
11           cigarettes contributes substantially to producing
12           such injury and death."
13                That's a lot of words.  But, again, the words
14           "contribute substantially" are in the second
15           paragraph, and they're all the way up here.  And 16           the way it is defined, contributes
17           substantially -- "contributes substantially" is
18           defined "so that it can be reasonably said that
19           but for the addiction to cigarettes the injury and
20           death would not have occurred."  That's the
21           standard you have to apply.
22                In order to satisfy this burden, the
23           plaintiff must establish that Mr. Gelep's claimed
24           addiction was an essential reason why he smoked --
25           essential so substantial of reason that if he 102
1           hadn't been addicted, he would have quit in time
2           to avoid the injury, the injury that the plaintiff
3           occurs to place in this case.  So substantial that
4           Mr. Gelep lost his free will and couldn't stop
5           smoking.  Is that Mr. Gelep?  Does that sound like
6           the Mr. Gelep you heard about in this case over
7           the course of the last week or two?
8                I would submit to you again that the answer
9           to that question comes from the very first board I
10           showed you.  The simple truth -- I believe they
11           provided you with the answer to the question on
12           the verdict form.  Mr. Gelep enjoyed smoking,
13           Mr. Gelep made a personal choice to smoke, and
14           Mr. Gelep always had the ability to quit smoking.
15           And ultimately he did quit, when he was motivated
16           to do so.  And when he quit, he did so cold turkey
17           without any assistance whatsoever.  The ability to
18           quit was always within Mr. Gelep himself.  The 19           motivation, the persistence were always there.
20                If you believe that the evidence supports
21           these three points, then addiction could not have
22           been the legal cause of Mr. Gelep's death, and you
23           should check no on that verdict form.
24                If you believe these three simple truths,
25           then the plaintiff has failed to prove by the 103
1           greater weight of the evidence that Mr. Gelep's
2           claimed addiction was the but for cause of his
3           disease.
4                The Court will define the greater weight of
5           the evidence as being "The more persuasive and
6           convincing force and effect of the entire
7           evidence -- the entire evidence you've heard over
8           the course of this trial."  Ask yourself, could
9           Mr. Gelep have quit smoking, whether or not he was
10           addicted, whenever he decided to set his mind to
11           do so?  Based on the entire evidence that you've
12           heard, I submit to you that there's no doubt that
13           when he was motivated to do so, when he decided he
14           wanted to do so, Mr. Gelep could have quit smoking
15           at any point -- at any point in time.  And we know
16           that to be true because he did, in fact, quit
17           several times, and he ultimately quit for good in
18           1996.  And, therefore, his claimed addiction is
19           not the but for cause of his death in this case.
20           Why not?  Because Alexander Gelep always had it
21           within himself to quit smoking. 22                So for all the reasons Ms. Parker discussed
23           and all the reasons I've now explained to you, I
24           would ask that you answer the question on the
25           verdict form "no" and end this case now.  Answer 104
1           that question "no" and return a verdict in favor
2           of Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, the only
3           verdict that I would submit to you is consistent
4           with the entire force and effect of the evidence
5           you've heard in this case.
6                I want to thank you very much for your time
7           and attention.
