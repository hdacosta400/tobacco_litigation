23              MR. SCHULTZ:  Thank you, Your Honor.  Good
24        afternoon.  We've reached the end of the trial.  We've
25        spent three weeks together.

 1              We're here today at your invitation.  When you
 2        came in originally, you received a summons in the mail.
 3        You had to show up.  You sat through voir dire.  You
 4        were chosen.  You were chosen because you were unbiased
 5        jurors.  You sat through two weeks of evidence.  You
 6        were attentive.  You listened to both sides.  You went
 7        back and deliberated.  You reached a verdict, and a
 8        fair verdict.  You compensated Mrs. Gray for her
 9        losses.  That phase of the trial is over.
10              You invited us back because you felt unanimously,
11        each of you, that what you had seen convinced you that
12        R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company deserves to be punished
13        for what you saw in the two weeks of trial, and R.J.
14        Reynolds does deserve to be punished.
15              We're going to talk a little bit about what that
16        means, what you might consider, what you may punish
17        them for, and what the best measure might be for
18        punishing them.
19              First of all, I want to talk just a moment about
20        what punishment is, or what it's not maybe.  Punishment
21        is not a penalty.  Punishment should not be a cost of
22        doing business.
23              Punishment involves moral condemnation.  It
24        involves condemnation of what, in this particular
25        instance, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has done for

 1        more than 50 years.  We saw a slice of R.J. Reynolds
 2        through Dr. Figlar's testimony.  You've seen a whole
 3        lot more of R.J. Reynolds than that throughout the
 4        trial.
 5              R.J. Reynolds is going to stand up and ask you,
 6        in essence, to put a stamp of approval on everything
 7        they did.  If we don't punish misconduct, we condone
 8        it.  If you don't punish R.J. Reynolds for what they
 9        did, what you've seen, then you're condoning that
10        conduct.  The message that you're sending is that
11        everything is just fine.  Everything is not just fine
12        with what R.J. Reynolds did.
13              Can we pull up, please, jury instruction 3, Ryan?
14        The first question is, what are you punishing for? 15        You'll receive an instruction from the Court.  It says,
16        if you decide to award punitive damages, it should be
17        no greater than the amount that you find necessary to
18        punish R.J. Reynolds for the harm caused to Charles
19        Gray.  You'll also see the amount of damages must be
20        based only on harm suffered by Carolyn Gray and Charles
21        Gray.
22              You're punishing R.J. Reynolds for what happened
23        to the Gray family.  You're the only jury who will ever
24        have the chance to do that.  No other jury under our
25        law is allowed to punish for the harms that Mrs. Gray

 1        suffered for the death of her husband.  You are the
 2        only jury who can do that.  No jury has ever required
 3        R.J. Reynolds to pay for those losses.  No jury ever
 4        will be required to pay unless you require them to pay
 5        today.
 6              You can punish for that harm, and you can punish
 7        for a second reason.  And this, by the way, is the only
 8        reason you heard any evidence from R.J. Reynolds this
 9        morning.  That is to deter R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
10        Company and others similarly situated from engaging in
11        such misconduct in the future.
12              You can punish for the loss that Mrs. Gray
13        suffered.  You can punish to deter R.J. Reynolds from
14        engaging in the same sort of misconduct on a
15        going-forward basis.
16              Could we look at jury instruction 2, please?  How
17        do you decide?  In determining an amount of punitive
18        damages, what can you consider?
19              It says the amount would be in addition to
20        compensatory damages.  In making the determination, you
21        can consider the nature, the extent, the degree of
22        misconduct on part of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.
23              We know the nature of the misconduct.  The nature
24        of the misconduct was a preconceived conspiracy to
25        commit fraud.  The human toll of that behavior is

 1        virtually unspeakable.  You're not here to punish for
 2        all of that.  You're here to punish for Mr. Gray and
 3        Mrs. Gray.
 4              The extent of the misconduct, you've seen the
 5        resources that went into this conspiracy over a 50-year
 6        period, the billions of dollars that went into
 7        sustaining that message publicly.
 8              And the degree of misconduct is also something
 9        you should consider.  We're talking about a conspiracy
10        to commit fraud that resulted in the death of a human
11        being.  It's hard to imagine anything else that's not
12        on the criminal side of this courthouse that's more
13        reprehensible than that.
14              The second thing you may consider, you consider
15        the nature, the extent, the degree of the misconduct,
16        and you consider their resources.
17              Why do you consider R.J. Reynolds' resources?
18        You heard already R.J. Reynolds' net worth is roughly
19        $8 billion.  That's not all the money R.J. Reynolds
20        ever made from selling cigarettes.  That is all of R.J.
21        Reynolds' assets, minus all of their liabilities.
22              Everybody in the courtroom has a net worth.  If
23        you have $100,000 in the bank, and you don't have any
24        other debts or liabilities, you have $100,000 net
25        worth. 3300
 1              If you have equity in a home, that goes into your
 2        net worth.  R.J. Reynolds' net worth, as of the latest
 3        numbers that we have, is $8 billion.
 4              Why does that matter?  Because if you're going to
 5        punish R.J. Reynolds, you have to know what it takes to
 6        hurt.  A $150,000 fine to an individual for committing
 7        some infraction might be quite a deterrent.  For R.J.
 8        Reynolds, they make that much money in an hour.  It's
 9        not much of a deterrent to award $150,000 of punitive
10        damages when that's one hour's income, and that's also
11        based on the most recent numbers that we have.
12              Net income of $1.3 billion a year, which is
13        roughly $3.5 million a day, which means R.J. Reynolds
14        Tobacco Company, since the day you walked into this
15        courtroom, has made something on the order of net
16        earnings of $74 million selling the products just like
17        the products that killed Charles Gray.
18              So you're not supposed to, and we certainly don't
19        ask you to hold it against R.J. Reynolds that they're a
20        successful corporation, but it does matter.  It matters
21        what their net worth is because punishment doesn't mean
22        much unless it has some sort of deterring effect on
23        them.
24              Also talking about R.J. Reynolds, there's
25        something else you heard from the Court last week, and

 1        that is, R.J. Reynolds is a person under the law.
 2        You're not to hold it against them that they're a
 3        corporation.  You're not to favor them because they're
 4        a corporation.  Under our law corporations are treated
 5        just like people.
 6              What that means is, R.J. Reynolds, in this
 7        courtroom, is the same person who put up those
 8        advertisements that you saw in the 1930s, 1940s, the
 9        same person who met at the Plaza Hotel in 1954 and
10        conspired to defraud Mr. Gray.  It's the same
11        corporation, the same person, who said that Dr.
12        Benowitz and everyone else involved in the 1988 surgeon
13        general's report was irresponsible and was engaging in
14        scare tactics when they said that cigarettes were
15        addictive.  It's the same person who held up their hand
16        in Congress and said, we don't believe -- we don't know
17        whether smoking causes lung cancer.  Those are all
18        statistics.  That is the person who's in the courtroom
19        today.
20              So when you hear, gee, that's the old R.J.
21        Reynolds.  Forget about all of that.  Look at the new
22        R.J. Reynolds.  You can't forget about all of it.  The
23        Court has already told you R.J. Reynolds is a person
24        under the law.  They are the person who committed the
25        acts that caused Mr. Gray's death.

 1              I want to take a look -- if we can pull the Elmo
 2        up, please, Ryan.  I made a little chart, and it's
 3        crude.
 4              I was listening during Dr. Figlar's testimony.
 5        His testimony -- and keep in mind, he had an
 6        opportunity to come in here and tell you anything R.J.
 7        Reynolds wanted to say.  Dr. Figlar was the voice of
 8        R.J. Reynolds for the punishment phase of this trial.
 9              You heard him last week.  He came in here and
10        said everything R.J. Reynolds has done since the 1950s 11        is consistent with public health.  He could have come
12        in here and said, I retract that statement.  I take it
13        back.  We've seen your verdict.  We understand we need
14        to change.  He didn't do that.  He came in here and
15        ignored all of that.
16              If we go back 100 years with R.J. Reynolds to
17        1910 -- in 1913 Camel cigarettes came out.  In 1935, 25
18        years, Charlie Gray was born.  12 years later he began
19        smoking.
20              R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company never studied its
21        products during this entire period, never did any
22        research on them.  At least they don't have any
23        documents suggesting that they did research on them.
24        All of this was left out of R.J. Reynolds'
25        presentation.  It's like it never happened.

 1              You've already seen, you have to consider not
 2        only deterrence of the RJR today, stop them from doing
 3        in the future what they've done in the past, you have
 4        to look at what they did in the past and punish them
 5        for it.  That's why we're here.
 6              The Plaza Hotel in 1954, the response to every
 7        surgeon general's report all the way into the 1980s, in
 8        1994 when Charlie Gray died, the same year they stood
 9        up in Congress and said, we don't believe cigarettes or
10        nicotine are addictive.
11              And then two years after that we get to Eclipse,
12        and that's what you heard testimony about.  Almost all
13        of this morning was about this piece of the pie of R.J.
14        Reynolds' long and sordid history.
15              You're not punishing for this slice of the pie.
16        You're punishing for everything they did during this
17        period of time that caused harm to Mr. Gray or to
18        Mrs. Gray.  And let's not forget the kauai kolada and
19        pineapple and mint-flavored cigarettes that also went
20        on during this time period.
21              It's hard to know what to make of R.J. Reynolds'
22        response.  They had the opportunity to come in here
23        today and answer for all the rest of this time, and we
24        heard not a single word about it.  They don't admit
25        mistakes.  They don't apologize because they don't

 1        think they did anything wrong.
 2              They could have stood up there and said, we heard
 3        you.  You were right.  Addiction caused Mr. Gray's
 4        death, and we played a role in that, and we're going to
 5        do something about it.  They didn't say a word of that
 6        because they don't think that, and they're not going to
 7        change what they're doing.
 8              R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company is in the business
 9        of selling addiction.  Eclipse -- I'll tell you the
10        truth.  If people have got to smoke, I hope they smoke
11        Eclipse cigarettes because they do have fewer
12        carcinogens, but is that really the problem?  It is a
13        problem.  It's a problem they should address.  They
14        don't get awards for addressing such an obvious health
15        issue.
16              They've entirely ignored the question of
17        addiction.  So they spent $1 billion, we were told, on
18        harm reduction, and they haven't spent one penny on
19        trying to make their products less addictive.  And when
20        you ask them about it on the stand, what do they say?
21        I don't know how we would do that.  I can't imagine how 22        we would make them less addictive.  We lowered the
23        nicotine, and that didn't work, so we stopped.  We just
24        decided we're not going to do anything else, even
25        though that is the reason people are dying from the use

 1        of their products.
 2              That's the reason Charles Gray died -- because of
 3        the addiction.  You found that yourselves.  Yet they
 4        come back into the courtroom and say, don't punish us,
 5        but you won't hear a word about addiction because we're
 6        not going to change a thing that we're doing.  That's
 7        just the truth.
 8              You have an opportunity today to send R.J.
 9        Reynolds a message, a message that says, at least for
10        Charles Gray, you should do something different.
11              We can't punish for everybody.  We can't punish
12        for all the harm that you've done, all the tragedy
13        that's followed in the wake of everything that we've
14        seen over the last 100 years, but we can send a message
15        from the Grays, and the message is, do something about
16        the addictiveness of your products.  You've got
17        hundreds of scientists, billions of dollars.  You know
18        it's a problem.  Do something about it.
19              Can we look at the PowerPoint slide?  RJR, 1946,
20        this is roughly the year Mr. Gray started smoking
21        cigarettes as an 11- or 12-year-old.  Net sales of R.J.
22        Reynolds Tobacco Company, $613 million.
23              A quote from their own annual report in 1946,
24        sales of Camel cigarettes again established a new high
25        mark, the number sold being substantially greater than

 1        in 1945 when the previous high mark was established.
 2              $613 million in net sales, and they tell you they
 3        did no research, whatsoever, on their products that
 4        entire time.  They certainly weren't researching
 5        addiction because for another 64 years they've told us
 6        they don't research addiction.  We know they do
 7        research addiction.  They don't research ways to reduce
 8        addiction.  Let's put it that way.  Let's see the next
 9        slide.
10              This is what they were spending the money on,
11        advertising -- advertising comic book ads.  They give
12        away magic trick books if you send in five Camel packs.
13        Ads for Father's Day.
14              Instead of doing what a responsible corporation
15        would do, like pharmaceutical companies do today.  When
16        they realize -- you heard from Dr. Benowitz, when they
17        realize they have a problem with addictiveness in one
18        of their drugs, they try and reduce it.  That is
19        considered a side effect that is undesirable.  They
20        don't want people becoming hooked on drugs that are
21        meant to help them.
22              It's just the opposite in the cigarette industry,
23        just the opposite with R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.
24              Let me see the next.  You see it, 1953.  You've
25        seen these quotes before.  When they first found out

 1        about all the harms, what did the heads of the various
 2        companies say?  We don't know if one of these were R.J.
 3        Reynolds or not, but it certainly is sentiment you're
 4        familiar with after all the evidence you've heard.
 5              It's fortunate for us that cigarettes are a habit
 6        they can't break.  Here's Eclipse 50 years before.  7        Boy, wouldn't it be wonderful if our company was the
 8        first to produce a cancer-free cigarette?  What we
 9        could do to the competition.
10              The one thing it doesn't mention, by the way, it
11        has to be addictive.  Eclipse is addictive.  Eclipse
12        contains nicotine.
13              Can we see the next?  And this is nicotine in the
14        words of the industry.  You've seen these documents.
15        Cigarettes and nicotine clearly do not meet the classic
16        definition of addiction, 1994, but look what they were
17        saying behind closed doors.
18              Addison Yeaman of Brown and Williamson Tobacco
19        Company, involved in the Tobacco Institute, said it
20        clearly 30 years before that.  We are, then, in the
21        business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug.
22        Happily for the tobacco industry, nicotine is both
23        habituating and unique.  1978, a nicotine blocker.  You
24        heard Dr. Cummings.  This is something very close to
25        Chantix.  1978 they found out there's work going on, a

 1        nicotine blocker or substitute.  Says one of the
 2        lawyers for the CTR, could put the industry out of
 3        business overnight.  Unacceptable.
 4              Can we see the next slide?  Claude Teague, a long
 5        career and retirement from R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
 6        Company.  In essence, a cigarette is a system for
 7        delivery of nicotine to the smoker, and you've seen the
 8        quotes.
 9              We can go on, 1991.  This isn't just Claude
10        Teague or Alan Rodgman or Frank Colby.  We are
11        basically in the nicotine business.  It is in the best
12        long-term interest for RJR to control and effectively
13        utilize every pound of nicotine we purchase, and that's
14        exactly what they did.
15              R.J. Reynolds does study addiction.  They just
16        don't study how to reduce addiction because when you're
17        selling addiction, having an addictive product is a
18        very, very good thing, and you'll see it's very, very
19        lucrative.
20              Can we see the next slide, please, Ryan?  On the
21        way back in '73, any desired additional nicotine kick
22        could be easily obtained through pH regulation.
23              Want to amp up the nicotine?  We've got chemists
24        who can do that.  They do have scientists working on
25        nicotine, and that's what they're doing.

 1              Those are documents that you were never meant to
 2        see.  That's how R.J. Reynolds scientists spoke to one
 3        another behind closed doors when they thought no one
 4        would ever see it, and they stamped "confidential" on
 5        it, and they put it in files that they thought would
 6        never see the light of day, and now they have, and it
 7        deserves punishment, and that's why we're here.
 8              Companies that lose sight of what matters need to
 9        be punished.  When people become numbers, when people
10        become nothing more than numbers, and this is a means
11        to making more and more money, then that is a company
12        deserving of our condemnation and punishment.
13              Can we see the next slide, please?  Here we are
14        in 1989 again.  This isn't the 1950s.  This isn't
15        ancient history.  Enhancement of nicotine binding to
16        nicotine receptors by nicotine levulinate and levulinic
17        acid in the brain. 18              There was testimony that rats don't smoke
19        cigarettes, do they, during direct examination.  Well,
20        rats don't smoke cigarettes.  They're studying rat
21        brains because it tells them a whole lot about people's
22        brains.
23              This is the kind of research RJR has been
24        engaging in since at least the 1970s, we've seen.  So
25        it's not entirely true when they tell you they don't

 1        study addiction.  They do study addiction.  They study
 2        it very closely.
 3              Can we see the next?  And this is really what
 4        it's all about.  You've seen this slide before.
 5        Charlie Gray, younger adult smoker.  Younger adult
 6        smokers are a key market for RJR.  And they talk about
 7        Winston.  This is going back to the 1950s.  That's
 8        Mr. Gray as a 19-year-old starting on Winstons in 1954.
 9              The only source for replacement smokers, that's
10        how they view the human beings that use their products,
11        replacement smokers.  Who do you think Charlie Gray
12        replaced, and whose replacement -- is there somebody
13        walking around right now who's the replacement for
14        Mr. Gray?
15              Let me see the next slide.  This is the modern
16        RJR, all since Mr. Gray's death.  Have they really
17        changed?
18              Even if they've changed, everything that we've
19        seen from their past behavior deserves punishment.
20        You've seen the nature, the extent, the degree of the
21        reprehensible conduct.  That's if they've changed.
22        Maybe they've gotten better, more sophisticated, more
23        innovative.
24              The next one.  Their newest product, you just
25        heard about it.  Dr. Figlar doesn't think they resemble

 1        Tic Tacs.  They sure look like nicotine candy to me.
 2              We heard about migration, migration from people
 3        off of cigarettes onto these.  We haven't heard about
 4        migration from these onto cigarettes.
 5              You heard Dr. Figlar.  People can become addicted
 6        to these.  And when they do become addicted to these,
 7        how hard is it to figure out that smoking a cigarette
 8        is a much better delivery system for nicotine than one
 9        of these?  There's Nicorette gum out in the world.
10        People don't have to have orbs if they want nicotine.
11              They're in the business of selling addiction.
12        They're selling addiction today just like they were 100
13        years ago, 70 years ago, 40 years ago, the day Mr. Gray
14        died.
15              They're still selling addiction, and they won't
16        do anything about it, and that's why you didn't hear a
17        word about it on the stand this morning.  They could
18        have talked about it.  They could have come in here and
19        told you, this is what we're going to do different, but
20        they refuse to.
21              You have an opportunity to send a message for the
22        harm that the Grays suffered.  The message you should
23        send to R.J. Reynolds is, research your products,
24        cooperate with the FDA.  Don't wait for a letter from
25        the FDA saying, can you please send us all the research

 1        on these new nicotine orbs and nicotine strips that
 2        you're selling.  Cooperate with them proactively and  3        study the addictiveness of your products and do
 4        something about it.  It's not lowering the nicotine.
 5              There are 100 ways, if you put bright scientists
 6        with the resources that RJR has, to try to do something
 7        about the addictiveness of their product.
 8              They're all about choice when they come in here.
 9        They talk a lot about choice and responsibility.  They
10        don't want people to have a choice.  They want people
11        to be addicted to their product because that means more
12        money, and you've seen it.  For 50 years that's what
13        they did was perfect addictiveness of their product
14        because that makes them more money.  It's the only
15        thing they understand.
16              You'll see the new RJR in their presentation,
17        access to Reynolds documents, new positions on smoking
18        and health, links to surgeon general and other public
19        health authorities.  That's the new R.J. Reynolds after
20        they were sued by 46 states attorney general.
21        Litigation is what they understand.
22              Can we see the net worth slides?  This is R.J.
23        Reynolds' net worth, $8 billion, $3.5 million a day in
24        net earnings.  Each one of these dollar signs is
25        $20 million.  Each one of these lines is $500 million.

 1        Each bar is $1 billion.  That's what happens when you
 2        sell addiction, $8 billion.
 3              So if you want to send a message to RJR, how
 4        would you send it?  Could you say we're going to award
 5        $1 billion in punitive damages -- $1 billion in
 6        punitive damages for what you've done, and they still
 7        have $7 billion left.
 8              Would it be enough?  Would it get their
 9        attention?  I think it would probably get their
10        attention.  Would it change anything?  Who knows.  One
11        thing we know is, it would never survive in the court
12        system.  It would do no good to send that kind of
13        message.  What if it were $500 million -- $500 million?
14              It would probably get their attention.  It sounds
15        like a lot of money.  If you're walking out on the
16        street or if you're walking into the courtroom for the
17        first time, $500 million is a shocking figure.  But
18        when you see it in context, it's not really all that
19        shocking at all.  $500 million would never make it
20        through the Court system either.  That's not the system
21        that we have.
22              How about $70 million?  That's how much R.J.
23        Reynolds has earned since we started the trial in net
24        earnings, $74 million, $3.5 million today.
25              That would probably send the right message, but

 1        that's not what we're asking.  We are asking for a
 2        specific figure.  We're asking for treble damages.
 3              Can we see the last slide, Ryan?  We're asking
 4        for treble damages, punitive damages to punish them in
 5        the amount of $21 million.
 6              Is that really going to wake RJ up so they have a
 7        board meeting tomorrow and say, you know what, we got
 8        the message, and we're going to do what we can to make
 9        our products less addictive?
10              In all candor, I doubt it.  From everything we
11        know about them, it probably won't change the way they
12        do business, but it will be a message.  It will be a
13        message that people are watching.  It will be a message 14        that Charlie Gray counted.  And maybe the other people
15        who have suffered, whose losses you're not here to
16        punish for, maybe some of those people will have
17        lawyers and juries who can hear the facts and award
18        punishment for them.  That's not what you're here for
19        today.
20              One-fourth of one percent of their net worth is
21        what we're suggesting, and that is an award that would
22        survive in the court system.  In all candor, it's a
23        very modest award in light of everything that you've
24        seen.
25              Money is not the best measure.  It's not the best

 1        measure for the compensatory losses.  I'm sure it was
 2        difficult, when you went back there, to try and figure
 3        out how you translate the loss of somebody -- a human
 4        being -- into money.  It's the only tool that we have
 5        in the system.  That's why we're talking about money.
 6              You can't put them in jail.  Y'all don't have the
 7        power to put them in jail.  You do have the power to
 8        make them write a check.
 9              Mr. Gray paid with his life.  Mrs. Gray paid by
10        losing the only man she ever loved.  R.J. Reynolds gets
11        to write a check and go back to business.  I would say
12        they're somewhat fortunate, if you put everything into
13        context.
14              It probably won't change RJR overnight, but
15        certainly it will send a message that people are
16        watching, the juries are watching, and that they can't
17        go back to the way they were doing business and that
18        they have to be careful, that they should do better.
19              There are plenty of corporations in the world
20        that make a whole lot of money, and there's nothing in
21        the world wrong with that, but you can't cheat.  You
22        can't lose sight of what matters.  You can't turn
23        people into numbers.  That's what R.J. Reynolds did.
24        They lost sight of everything that mattered.
25              Now they're going to ask you, please don't punish

 1        us for that.  Please don't punish us because we
 2        intentionally conspired to commit fraud for 50 years
 3        that resulted in the death of a human being, but we
 4        don't deserve to be punished for that.  That's what
 5        they're going to tell you.
 6              It would be nice if we could say that we count on
 7        our government to regulate misconduct like we've seen
 8        from R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.  It would be nice
 9        if R.J. Reynolds would do to themselves, but we know
10        that neither of those things is going to happen.
11              For 1,000 years we've looked to juries in our
12        system to punish people that engage in the kind of
13        behavior R.J. Reynolds has engaged in.  We count on
14        juries to do that because juries can listen to the
15        facts.  Juries are not beholden to the industry.  Only
16        juries can render the kind of punishment R.J. Reynolds
17        deserves.  It's not exactly the punishment we would
18        have in a perfect world, but it's a punishment they
19        might have to pay.
20              We've counted on juries for 1,000 years to do
21        exactly what y'all are doing, and we're counting on
22        y'all today to do that.  Thank you.
