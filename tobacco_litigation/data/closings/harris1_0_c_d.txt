MR. COFER: THANK YOU.
MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT, COUNSEL, MRS. HARRIS,
MEMBERS OF THE JURY, GOOD MORNING.
I TOLD YOU IN OPENING STATEMENT THAT WE BELIEVE
THAT THIS CASE COMES DOWN TO THREE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD
QUESTIONS. WHY DID MR. HARRIS SMOKE? WHY DID HE WAIT SO
LONG TO QUIT? AND DID THE DEFENDANTS DO SOMETHING THAT
CAUSED MR. HARRIS TO SMOKE AND GET SICK? AND IF YOU
REMEMBER, I TOLD YOU WHAT THE EVIDENCE WOULD BE. I TOLD YOU
THE EVIDENCE WOULD BE THAT MR. HARRIS SMOKED BECAUSE HE LIKED
TO SMOKE AND EVERYONE IN HIS FAMILY SMOKED. THAT BY NO LATER
THAN 1974, MR. HARRIS HAD THE TOOLS AND EXPERIENCES THAT HE
NEEDED TO QUIT SMOKING WHENEVER HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE
WANTED TO QUIT AND MADE AN EFFORT TO QUIT.
AND FINALLY, I TOLD YOU THERE WOULD BE NO EVIDENCE
THAT ANYTHING THAT DEFENDANTS DID OR DID NOT DO, SAID OR DID
NOT SAY CAUSED MR. HARRIS TO SMOKE AND GET SICK.
SO LET'S LOOK AT QUESTION 1. WHY DID MR. HARRIS
SMOKE? DR. BURNS TOLD YOU THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
FACTORS IN WHETHER SOMEONE SMOKES IS WHETHER THEIR FRIENDS
AND FAMILY SMOKE. HE TOLD YOU THAT IF A PERSON'S PARENTS,
AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS SMOKE, IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT THEY
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
89 WILL BECOME A SMOKER TOO. HE TOLD YOU THAT SMOKING TENDS TO
CLUSTER IN FAMILIES. AND IT'S UNDISPUTED, MEMBERS OF THE
JURY, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN MR. HARRIS' LIFE. HIS
PARENTS SMOKED, HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS SMOKED, HIS WIFE
SMOKED, HIS SON SMOKED, HIS DAUGHTER SMOKED, HIS FRIENDS AND
COWORKERS SMOKED.
WE'VE ALL HEARD THE OLD PHRASE THAT "BIRDS OF A
FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER." THAT EXACTLY DESCRIBES MR. HARRIS'
SMOKING EXPERIENCES. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE, NONE WHATSOEVER,
THAT ANYTHING THE TOBACCO COMPANIES DID CAUSED MR. HARRIS TO
BECOME A SMOKER. NO ONE KNOWS WHEN MR. HARRIS BECAME A
REGULAR SMOKER. NO ONE KNOWS THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS FIRST
CIGARETTE. ALL WE KNOW FROM THE EVIDENCE, MEMBERS OF THE
JURY, IS THAT EVERYONE IN HIS LIFE SMOKED. IS IT REALLY A
SURPRISE THAT MR. HARRIS SMOKED TOO?
LET'S GO TO THE SECOND QUESTION. WHY DID HE WAIT
SO LONG TO QUIT? WHILE IT'S TRUE THAT CIGARETTES CAN BE
ADDICTIVE, IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT EVEN ADDICTED SMOKERS CAN AND
DO QUIT SMOKING. DR. BURNS TOLD YOU THAT ALL SMOKERS,
INCLUDING ADDICTED SMOKERS, HAVE THE CHOICE TO QUIT.
DR. BURNS TOLD YOU THAT. HE TOLD YOU THAT JUST BECAUSE
SOMEONE IS ADDICTED DOES NOT MEAN THEY CAN'T QUIT. DO YOU
REMEMBER WHAT ELSE HE TOLD YOU? HE TOLD YOU BY DEFINITION A
PERSON WHO DOESN'T TRY TO QUIT WON'T QUIT.
DR. BURNS TOLD YOU THAT THE 1990 SURGEON GENERAL'S
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
90 REPORT FOUND THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THE PEOPLE ALIVE AT THE
TIME THAT USED TO SMOKE HAD ALREADY QUIT SMOKING. BY THE
TIME OF MR. HARRIS' DEATH IN 2012, 55 MILLION AMERICANS HAD
QUIT SMOKING.
DR. BURNS TOLD YOU THAT HE BELIEVES THE VAST
MAJORITY OF THOSE 55 MILLION AMERICANS WERE ADDICTED, BUT HE
ALSO TOLD YOU THAT WHEN THEY MADE THE CHOICE TO QUIT AND THEY
MADE AN EFFORT TO QUIT, THEY DID QUIT. AND WHAT'S THE SINGLE
MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN QUITTING SMOKING? IT'S MOTIVATION
AND PERSISTENCE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS, MEMBERS OF THE JURY,
YOU HAVE TO WANT TO QUIT AND YOU HAVE TO TRY TO QUIT. AND
THERE IS VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE THAT MR. HARRIS
ACTUALLY WANTED TO QUIT SMOKING, AND THAT IS CRITICALLY
IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT BY NO LATER THAN
1974, MR. HARRIS HAD THE TOOLS AND THE EXPERIENCES HE NEEDED
TO QUIT SMOKING.
YOU HEARD FROM DR. BURNS IN 1974 MR. HARRIS GOT
INTO AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT. THAT ACCIDENT WAS THE TIPPING
POINT THAT FINALLY GOT HIS ATTENTION AND MOTIVATED HIM TO
QUIT DRINKING. IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HIS FAMILY THAT HE QUIT.
SO MRS. HARRIS ASKED HIM TO QUIT. HIS FAMILY SUPPORTED HIS
EFFORTS TO QUIT. HE MADE UP HIS MIND HE WAS GOING TO QUIT,
SO HE WENT TO THE DOCTOR AND HE GOT A PRESCRIPTION FOR
ANTABUSE. HE TOOK ACTION. AND WHEN THE ANTABUSE DIDN'T
WORK, HE DIDN'T GIVE UP. HE WENT TO AA. HE KEPT AT IT. HE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
91 SOUGHT THE HELP HE NEEDED TO BREAK HIS ADDICTION TO ALCOHOL.
BUT MRS. HARRIS TOLD YOU THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR THAT
ALLOWED HIM TO QUIT DRINKING, DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT SHE TOLD
YOU? SHE SAID HIS FAMILY. SHE SAID THE SUPPORT AND
ENCOURAGEMENT OF HIS FAMILY, AND THAT MR. HARRIS DID NOT WANT
TO DISAPPOINT HIS FAMILY.
DR. KAPLAN TOLD YOU YESTERDAY THAT ANY TIME HE
WANTED TO, MR. HARRIS COULD HAVE TAKEN THOSE EXPERIENCES AND
THOSE TOOLS HE LEARNED TO QUIT DRINKING AND APPLIED THEM TO
QUIT SMOKING. YOU KNOW, THE TRUTH IS, YOU DIDN'T NEED AN
EXPERT TO TELL YOU THAT. I MEAN, THAT'S COMMON SENSE AND
THAT RINGS TRUE.
THE PLAINTIFF WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE DR. HARRIS --
I'M SORRY, DR. BURNS YOU WOULD HAVE BELIEVE THAT WELL, THE
REASON HE KEPT SMOKING IS BECAUSE NICOTINE IS MORE ADDICTIVE
THAN ALCOHOL. WELL THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL. YOU KNOW WHAT
THE DIFFERENCE WAS? THE DIFFERENCE WAS THAT DRINKING, FOR
MR. HARRIS, IT DISRUPTED HIS LIFE. IT THREATENED HIS FAMILY,
HIS MARRIAGE AND HIS LIVELIHOOD, BUT NOT SMOKING. FOR
NONSMOKERS IT MAY BE HARD TO UNDERSTAND, SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO
SMOKE.
REMEMBER DR. PROCTOR TOLD YOU THAT NICOTINE IS
UNIQUE IN THAT IT'S BIPHASIC. REMEMBER HE SAID, YOU CAN USE
IT TO EITHER CALM YOURSELF DOWN OR YOU CAN USE IT TO GIVE YOU
A LIFT. FOR SOME PEOPLE THEY LIKE THE SMELL, AND TASTE AND
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
92 RITUAL OF SMOKING. THEY FIND IT PLEASING. THEY FIND IT
ENJOYABLE. SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO SMOKE WHEN THEY HAVE A CUP OF
COFFEE. SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO SMOKE WHEN THEY GET HOME FROM A
HARD DAY'S WORK AND ARE TIRED, AND THEY SIT DOWN AND THEY
HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE AND THEY WATCH THE EVENING NEWS. SOME
LIKE TO SMOKE WHEN THEY GET UP IN THE MORNING AND READ THE
PAPER. THESE DAYS MOST PEOPLE DON'T SMOKE. BUT, MEMBERS OF
THE JURY, THAT SMOKING WAS JUST AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE WAY
THE HARRIS FAMILY LIVED THEIR LIVES. THEY ALL SMOKED
TOGETHER. SMOKING HAS BEEN A TRADITION IN THE HARRIS FAMILY
FOR GENERATIONS.
NOW, DR. BURNS TOLD YOU THAT A SMOKER IS ABLE TO
QUIT SMOKING WHEN HE OR SHE MAKES UP HIS OR HER MIND THEY
WANT TO QUIT, AND WHEN THEY MUSTER SUFFICIENT INTERNAL
RESOURCES AND ARE PROVIDED WITH SUFFICIENT EXTERNAL SUPPORT.
DO YOU REMEMBER HIM TELLING YOU THAT? WHAT THAT MEANS IS
THEY HAVE TO WANT TO QUIT, AND IT'S VERY HELPFUL IF THEY ASK
THEIR FRIENDS OR LOVED ONES FOR MORAL SUPPORT, FOR HELP, TO
PITCH IN TO HELP HIM QUIT.
DR. BURNS TOLD YOU THAT THE KIND OF SUPPORT THAT A
FAMILY GIVES CAN EITHER HELP OR HOLD BACK A SMOKER'S
WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO QUIT. DR. BURNS TOLD YOU IT IS
VERY CLEAR FROM THE LITERATURE THAT FAMILY SUPPORT IS AN
IMPORTANT AID IN HELPING PEOPLE SUCCESSFULLY STAY OFF
CIGARETTES, BUT UNLIKE DRINKING, HE NEVER ASKED HIS FAMILY
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
93 FOR HELP IN QUITTING.
NO ONE IN HIS FAMILY ENCOURAGED HIM TO QUIT BECAUSE
THEY WERE ALL SMOKING TOO. MRS. HARRIS TOLD YOU THAT DURING
THE COURSE OF THEIR 40-YEAR MARRIAGE SHE NEVER TRIED TO QUIT.
MS. LONDON: OBJECTION.
MR. COFER: DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR 40-YEAR
MARRIAGE SHE NEVER TRIED TO QUIT.
THE COURT: THIS ONLY RELATES TO MR. HARRIS'
SMOKING, NOT MRS. HARRIS. SHE IS NOT IN TRIAL HERE. YOU MAY
CONTINUE.
MR. COFER: WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHY MR. HARRIS
DIDN'T QUIT. THAT'S WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS TESTIMONY IS.
AND MRS. HARRIS TOLD YOU THAT SHE SMOKED WITH HER HUSBAND.
SHE NEVER TRIED TO QUIT. SHE NEVER ENCOURAGED HER HUSBAND TO
QUIT, AND THEY NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT.
MS. LONDON: OBJECTION.
THE COURT: AGAIN, I THINK THE JURORS UNDERSTAND
THIS IS ABOUT MR. HARRIS, BUT SHE MAY COME INTO PLAY. IT'S
ONLY AS IT COMES INTO PLAY TO HIS SMOKING. YOU MAY CONTINUE.
MR. COFER: BUT HERE'S WHAT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT,
REMEMBER WHAT ELSE SHE TOLD YOU? SHE TOLD YOU SHE DOESN'T
KNOW IF HER HUSBAND WANTED TO QUIT. SHE DOES NOT RECALL HIM
INDICATING A DESIRE TO QUIT. SHE DOES NOT RECALL ANY TIME HE
TOLD HER THAT HE WANTED TO QUIT SMOKING. MEMBERS OF THE
JURY, IT'S CERTAIN IF YOU DON'T TRY TO QUIT, YOU'RE NOT GOING
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
94 TO QUIT. THAT'S COMMON SENSE. THAT'S TRUE OF EVERYTHING IN
OUR LIVES. IF YOU WANT SOMETHING YOU'VE GOT TO TRY.
SO QUESTION 3, DID THE DEFENDANTS DO SOMETHING THAT
CAUSED MR. HARRIS TO SMOKE AND GET SICK? I TOLD YOU THE
EVIDENCE WAS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING THE
TOBACCO COMPANIES DID OR DID NOT DO, SAID OR DID NOT SAY THAT
CAUSED MR. HARRIS TO SMOKE OR AFFECTED HIM IN ANY WAY.
SO LET'S GO BACK AGAIN TO MRS. HARRIS. SHE'S THE
ONLY FACT WITNESS PLAINTIFF CALLED IN THIS CASE WHO KNEW HER
HUSBAND. MRS. HARRIS ADMITTED HER HUSBAND NEVER SAID THAT HE
WISHED A TOBACCO COMPANY WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM MORE
INFORMATION, OR IF THE TOBACCO COMPANY HAD SAID SOMETHING TO
HIM SOONER THAT IT WOULD HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE.
NOW, IF YOU CAN REMEMBER BACK A WEEK AGO DURING
OPENING STATEMENT I SUGGESTED TO YOU, I SAID, LISTEN TO THE
EVIDENCE. YOU SHOULD ASK YOURSELF WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO
WITH JERRY HARRIS. AND NO BETTER EXAMPLE OF THAT IS
PLAINTIFF'S FIRST WITNESS, DR. PROCTOR. DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT
DR. PROCTOR TOLD YOU, ONE OF THE VERY FIRST THINGS HE TOLD
YOU? HE SPECIFICALLY SAID HE DID NOT HAVE ANY OPINIONS ABOUT
JERRY HARRIS. DR. PROCTOR TOLD YOU THAT. HE SAID, I'M NOT
HERE TO TALK ABOUT MR. HARRIS AT ALL. I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT
THE TOBACCO COMPANIES. AND THEN HE DID GIVE YOU A
FASCINATING HISTORY OF HOW TOBACCO HAS BEEN VIEWED THROUGHOUT
TIME. BUT AS I LISTENED TO HIS TESTIMONY, I KEPT ASKING
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 95
MYSELF, OKAY, BUT WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH JERRY
HARRIS? HOW IS THIS TESTIMONY GOING TO HELP THE JURY DECIDE
WHETHER MR. HARRIS WAS A MEMBER OF THE ENGLE CLASS? AND THE
ANSWER IS, IT DOESN'T, AND THAT IS BECAUSE DR. PROCTOR'S
TESTIMONY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MR. HARRIS. HE SHOWED YOU
ADS FOR BRANDS THAT MR. HARRIS NEVER SMOKED. HE SHOWED YOU
SNIPPETS OF DOCUMENTS THAT MR. HARRIS NEVER SAW AND DID NOT
INFLUENCE HIM IN ANY WAY. SO WHY THEN DID PLAINTIFF CALL
DR. PROCTOR? AND WHY DID THEY CALL DR. PROCTOR AS THEIR VERY
FIRST WITNESS IN THIS CASE? BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE YOU
MAD. THEY WANT TO MANIPULATE YOUR EMOTIONS. THEY WANT TO
DIVERT YOUR ATTENTION FROM MR. HARRIS.
MS. LONDON: OBJECTION TO THE CHARACTERIZATION OF
COUNSEL.
HONOR.
MR. COFER: IT'S NOT COUNSEL, IT'S PLAINTIFF, YOUR
THE COURT: THE OBJECTION IS OVERRULED.
MR. COFER: LET ME MAKE THIS VERY CLEAR, LAWYERS
REPRESENT CLIENTS. WHEN WE'RE SPEAKING TO YOU, WE'RE
SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF OUR CLIENTS. I AM NOT DISPARAGING
MS. LONDON AND MR. BYRD. THEY REPRESENTED THEIR CLIENTS WITH
ZEAL AND PASSION. I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR.
THE PURPOSE OF DR. PROCTOR WAS TO DIVERT YOUR
ATTENTION FROM WHAT MR. HARRIS KNEW, AND WHAT MR. HARRIS DID
AND WHAT HE DIDN'T DO.
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
96 DR. PROCTOR AND DR. BURNS SPENT A LOT OF TIME
TALKING ABOUT CIGARETTE ADVERTISING, BUT THERE WAS NO
EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT CIGARETTE ADS HAD ANYTHING TO DO
WITH MR. HARRIS' DECISIONS. AND WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE
MRS. HARRIS TESTIFIED AND SHE TOLD YOU THAT SHE AND HER
HUSBAND NEVER DISCUSSED CIGARETTE ADVERTISEMENTS. TO HER
KNOWLEDGE MR. HARRIS NEVER PURCHASED A CIGARETTE BRAND
BECAUSE OF ADS. SHE TOLD YOU HE WAS NOT THE TYPE OF PERSON
WHO BOUGHT THINGS BECAUSE OF ADVERTISEMENTS. THAT HE WASN'T
INFLUENCED BY ADS, AND THAT HE MADE UP HIS OWN MIND. YET SHE
HAD TWO WITNESSES TALKING WITH YOU ABOUT CIGARETTE ADS, WHEN
THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO, MEMBERS OF THE JURY, WHY JERRY HARRIS
SMOKED OR WHY HE CHOSE THE BRANDS HE DID.
LET'S TALK ABOUT FILTERS. DR. BURNS TALKED A LOT
ABOUT FILTERS AND LOW TAR CIGARETTES, BUT MRS. HARRIS
ADMITTED THAT SHE AND HER HUSBAND NEVER TALKED ABOUT FILTERS
OR LOW TAR CIGARETTES. HE NEVER TOLD HER WHY HE SMOKED THEM.
HE NEVER SAID HE THOUGHT FILTERS OR LOW TAR WERE SAFER. HE
NEVER SAID HE THOUGHT LOWER NICOTINE CIGARETTES WERE SAFER.
INSTEAD MRS. HARRIS TOLD YOU THAT HER HUSBAND SMOKED FOUR
BRANDS OF CIGARETTES. ALL WERE FILTERED. ONE WAS AN ULTRA
LIGHT. HE SMOKED THEM INTERCHANGEABLY. SHE TOLD YOU HE
DIDN'T HAVE A FAVORITE BRAND. SHE SAID SOMETIMES HE WOULD
MAKE A DECISION BASED ON PRICE. THAT WAS ALL THE EVIDENCE
YOU HAD ON WHY MR. HARRIS SMOKED THE BRANDS HE SMOKED. THAT
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
97 WAS IT.
NOW, DR. BURNS TOLD YOU THAT THE TOBACCO COMPANIES
MISLEAD THE PUBLIC INTO BELIEVING FILTERS WERE SAFER. WELL,
MEMBERS OF THE JURY, AS I SHOWED YOU ON CROSS-EXAMINATION, IT
WASN'T THE TOBACCO COMPANIES WHO TOLD THE PUBLIC FILTERS WERE
SAFER. THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY AND THE SURGEON GENERAL
TOLD THE PUBLIC FILTERS WERE SAFER. AND THE SURGEON GENERAL
NEVER SAID CIGARETTES WERE SAFE. THE SURGEON GENERAL SAID
THEY WERE SAFER. AND THE REASON WHY THE SURGEON GENERAL TOLD
THE PUBLIC THAT LOWER TAR CIGARETTES WERE SAFER, BECAUSE
THERE WERE DOZENS OF EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES THAT REPORTED
THAT PEOPLE WHO SMOKED LOWER TAR CIGARETTES HAD LOWER RISK OF
LUNG CANCER. AND HERE'S ONE EXAMPLE. THIS IS AN INTERVIEW
YOU SAW. IT'S DR. HAMMOND ON THE NBC NEWS. IT WILL COME UP
IN JUST A SECOND.
(VIDEOTAPE PLAYING.)
MR. COFER: SO WHAT YOU HEARD DURING TRIAL WAS
THERE'S NO WAY REALLY TO TAKE THE BAD STUFF OUT OF
CIGARETTES. YOU CAN'T SELECTIVELY FILTER IT. SO THE IDEA
WAS THAT IF TAR IS BAD, THEN LESS TAR IS LESS BAD. IT'S A
DOSE RESPONSE. ONE GLASS OF WINE MAY RELAX YOU AND MAKE YOU
FEEL GOOD. IF YOU CHUG A QUART OF TEQUILA, YOU MAY STOP
BREATHING. SO THAT WAS THE WHOLE IDEA, IF TAR IS BAD, LESS
TAR IS BETTER, AND THAT'S WHAT THE EPIDEMIOLOGY SHOWED. BUT
NOW WE KNOW THAT IF PEOPLE COMPENSATE BY SMOKING MORE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
98 CIGARETTES, OR BY SMOKING THEIR CIGARETTES DIFFERENTLY, THEY
MAY GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF TAR AS SOMEONE WHO SMOKES A FULL
FLAVORED CIGARETTE.
WELL, MEMBERS OF THE JURY, PEOPLE HAVE KNOWN THAT
FOR A VERY LONG TIME. REMEMBER I SHOWED YOU THE ARTICLE
MAY 1976 FROM CONSUMER REPORTS AND WE WALKED THROUGH THE
ARTICLE WHERE IT SAID, "LESS TAR/LESS NICOTINE. IS THAT
GOOD? NICOTINE IS AN ADDICTING AGENT FOR MOST SMOKERS. WHEN
CIGARETTE SMOKE CONTAINS LESS NICOTINE THAN SUCH SMOKERS ARE
ACCUSTOMED TO, THEIR BODY SIMPLY CAN TRY WAYS TO GET MORE
SMOKE." THE PUBLIC WAS SPECIFICALLY AND REPEATEDLY TOLD, "IF
YOU WANT TO AVOID THE RISK OF SMOKING, DON'T SMOKE. IF YOU
ARE GOING TO SMOKE, SMOKE LOWER TAR CIGARETTES AND DON'T
COMPENSATE." THAT'S WHAT THE PUBLIC WAS TOLD.
NOW, DR. BURNS SAYS, "WELL, THE SURGEON GENERAL AND
PUBLIC HEALTH MISINTERPRETED THOSE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES."
WELL, MAYBE THEY DID, MAYBE THEY DIDN'T, BUT IT WAS A PUBLIC
HEALTH COMMUNITY THAT ENCOURAGED THE TOBACCO COMPANIES TO
PRODUCE LOWER TAR CIGARETTES, AND IT WAS THE PUBLIC HEALTH
COMMUNITY THAT TOLD SMOKERS, "QUIT, BUT IF YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO QUIT, SMOKE LOWER TAR PRODUCTS."
I TOLD YOU IN OPENING STATEMENT THAT IF YOU LOOK
BACK OVER THE LAST 60 YEARS AT THE MILLIONS OF PAGES OF
DOCUMENTS WRITTEN BY THE THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES OF PHILIP
MORRIS AND THE OTHER COMPANIES, THEY SAID SOME DUMB THINGS,
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
99 AND NOW YOU'VE SEEN THEM AND NOW YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE, BUT I
WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT HOW PLAINTIFF SHOWED YOU THOSE
DOCUMENTS.
THEY LITERALLY WOULD TAKE A SENTENCE FROM A
DOCUMENT HERE, A DOCUMENT THERE, A DOCUMENT HERE, WRITTEN 40
OR 50 YEARS AGO, THEY WOULD HAVE DR. BURNS OR DR. PROCTOR
READ PART OF IT TO YOU, AND THEN THEY WOULD TACK LITTLE
QUOTES ON A TIMELINE. THEY MADE NO EFFORT TO EVER TIE ANY OF
THOSE DOCUMENTS TO MR. HARRIS OR THE DECISIONS HE MADE, AND
THEY DID NOT TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY. LET ME GIVE YOU JUST
A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES.
YOU REMEMBER WHEN THEY SHOWED YOU THE PHILIP MORRIS
DOCUMENT IN 1961 THAT WAS THE RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENT,
AND THEY SHOWED YOU THIS PAGE THAT SAID, "PARTIAL LIST OF
COMPOUNDS IN CIGARETTE SMOKE ALSO IDENTIFY AS CARCINOGENS."
WELL, PLAINTIFF TRIED TO LEAVE YOU WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT
PHILIP MORRIS KNEW SOMETHING THAT THE SURGEON GENERAL DIDN'T
KNOW, UNTIL WE GOT TO CROSS-EXAMINATION OF DR. BURNS, AND YOU
REMEMBER IT WAS THE VERY END OF THE DAY, AND I WAS HURRYING
TO TRY TO FINISH MY CROSS-EXAMINATION SO WE COULD GET HIM OUT
OF HERE. IT WAS A FRIDAY, GET HIM BACK TO CALIFORNIA. AND
DR. BURNS HAD TO ADMIT THAT PHILIP MORRIS VOLUNTARILY
PROVIDED THIS INFORMATION TO THE SURGEON GENERAL SEVEN MONTHS
BEFORE THE 1964 SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT. PHILIP MORRIS DID
NOT KNOW SOMETHING THAT THE SURGEON GENERAL DIDN'T KNOW.
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
100 PHILIP MORRIS TOLD THEM. BUT YOU DIDN'T HEAR THAT ON DIRECT
EXAMINATION, DID YOU? AND YOU WON'T SEE THAT ON THE LITTLE
TIMELINE OF QUOTES TACKED.
LET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE. DR. PROCTOR TRIED
TO SUGGEST THAT THE DEFENDANTS KNEW THAT PEOPLE SMOKED FOR
NICOTINE, AND TRIED TO KEEP THAT INFORMATION FROM THE PUBLIC.
FRANKLY, THAT'S JUST SILLY. DR. PROCTOR ADMITTED IT HAS BEEN
KNOWN SINCE THE EARLY 1900'S THAT SMOKERS SMOKED FOR THE
PHARMACOLOGICAL AFFECTS OF NICOTINE.
DR. PROCTOR SHOWED YOU SOME EXCERPTS FROM SOME
PHILIP MORRIS DOCUMENTS AND TRIED TO SUGGEST THAT PHILIP
MORRIS WAS TRYING TO HIDE NICOTINE'S AFFECT FROM THE PUBLIC.
THEN WE SHOWED YOU A SPEECH THAT BILL DUNN, A PHILIP MORRIS
RESEARCHER, MADE IN 1972 THAT SAID, "PEOPLE SMOKE FOR
NICOTINE." PEOPLE FROM THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE AND THE
SURGEON GENERAL'S OFFICE WERE IN THE AUDIENCE AND HEARD THE
SPEECH. HE WAS THEN, NEXT, PLEASE -- HE WAS INTERVIEWED IN
THE NEWSPAPER AFTER THE SPEECH. IT WAS A SUNDAY EDITION.
AND HE TOLD THE PUBLIC, WITH THIS PICTURE, AN IMPORTANT
REASON PEOPLE SMOKE IS NICOTINE.
AND THEN, NEXT PLEASE, HE PUBLISHED A BOOK, AND YOU
SAW THE BOOK, THAT SAID, "PEOPLE SMOKE FOR NICOTINE." AND ON
CROSS-EXAMINATION DR. PROCTOR TOLD YOU HE HAS THIS BOOK IN
HIS OWN LIBRARY, AND THE SURGEON GENERAL HAS PUBLISHED AND
CITED IT IN HIS REPORTS A NUMBER OF TIMES, BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
101 SEE IT ON DIRECT EXAMINATION?
ONE LAST EXAMPLE. DR. BURNS SHOWED YOU A STATEMENT
FROM A PHILIP MORRIS DOCUMENT IN 1964 THAT SAID, "IN THE NEAR
FUTURE WE NEED TO PROVIDE ANSWERS WHICH WILL GIVE SMOKERS A
PSYCHOLOGICAL CRUTCH AND SELF-RATIONALE TO CONTINUE SMOKING."
WELL, THAT LOOKS REALLY BAD, DOESN'T IT? BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL
CROSS-EXAMINATION THAT YOU LEARNED THAT GEORGE WEISMAN DID
NOT INVENT THE TERM "PSYCHOLOGICAL CRUTCH." IT WAS IN THE
SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT THAT HE WAS REFERRING TO, "UNDER THE
BENEFICIAL AFFECTS OF TOBACCO, THE DRIVE USED TOBACCO BEING
FUNDAMENTALLY PSYCHOGENIC IN ORIGIN HAS THE SAME BASIS AS
OTHER DRUG HABITS AND IN A LARGE FRACTION OF THE AMERICAN
POPULATION, APPEARS TO SATISFY THE TOTAL NEED OF THE
INDIVIDUAL FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL CRUTCH." AND HE DIDN'T SHOW YOU
THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF GEORGE WEISMAN'S MEMO WHERE
MR. WEISMAN SAID, "IN CLOSING, THE MAIN ESSENCE OF THE REPORT
AND PUBLICITY TO ME IS THAT IT IS STILL LESS SMOKING ON AN
INDIVIDUAL BASIS, THE INDIVIDUAL'S OWN CHOICE OF THE
PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFIT VERSUS THE ALLEGED HAZARD. ANYTHING
THAT IMPINGES ON THE RIGHT OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO MAKE THIS
CHOICE IS CONTRARY TO OUR MOST BASIC TRADITIONS." HE WAS
TALKING ABOUT THE BENEFITS. IT'S UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL TO
WEIGH FOR HIM OR HERSELF THE RISKS OF SMOKING AND THE
BENEFITS.
NOW, YOU SAW SOME VIDEO CLIPS WHERE SOME EMPLOYEES
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
102 OF THE COMPANY, AND SOME EMPLOYEES OF THE TOBACCO INSTITUTE
SAID THAT SMOKING WAS NOT A PROVEN CAUSE OF CANCER. YOU SAW
MANY OF THOSE. AND WHAT YOU DID NOT LEARN UNTIL
CROSS-EXAMINATION IS WHY THEY SAID THAT. ON
CROSS-EXAMINATION DR. PROCTOR EXPLAINED WHY THAT WAS THE
COMPANY'S POSITION. AND WHAT HE TOLD YOU WAS THE COMPANY'S
POSITION WAS THAT STATISTICS, STATISTICS ALONE COULD NOT
PROVE WHETHER SOMETHING CAUSED SOMETHING. AND THE BASIS FOR
THAT STATEMENT WAS THAT SINCE 80 TO 85 PERCENT OF SMOKERS
DON'T GET LUNG CANCER, AND NONSMOKERS GET LUNG CANCER TOO,
SMOKING IS NOT A NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT CAUSE. IN OTHER
WORDS, YOU CAN SMOKE AND NOT GET IT. YOU CAN NOT SMOKE AND
GET IT. SO THE COMPANIES ARGUED SOMETHING ELSE MUST BE GOING
ON.
NOW, WE ALL NOW KNOW THOSE ARE TECHNICAL ARGUMENTS,
AND FRANKLY, THEY'RE NOT VERY PERSUASIVE. AND IN 1964, WHEN
THE SURGEON GENERAL SAID SMOKING WAS A PROVEN CAUSE, THE
COMPANIES THEY SHOULD HAVE JUST KEPT QUIET. THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE.
AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING, LOOKING BACK 50 YEARS
LATER AT THOSE VIDEOS IN THIS COURTROOM, YOU HAVE TO SHAKE
YOUR HEAD AND SAY WHAT PLANET ARE THOSE PEOPLE FROM? BUT YOU
KNOW WHAT, UNLESS PLAINTIFF PROVES THAT MR. HARRIS SAW THOSE
STATEMENTS, RELIED ON THOSE STATEMENTS AND WAS FOOLED BY
THOSE STATEMENTS THAT THEY AFFECTED HIM IN SOME WAY, THEN
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
103 THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS CASE. THE ISSUE
IS NOT WHETHER THE COMPANIES SAID DUMB THINGS. THEY DID.
OKAY. THEY DID. THE ISSUE IN THIS CASE IS WHETHER
MR. HARRIS SAW THEM AND RELIED ON THEM. THE ISSUE IS WHETHER
MR. HARRIS WAS FOOLED BY THEM AND WHETHER THAT'S WHAT CAUSED
HIM TO SMOKE AND GET SICK. AND THE EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING,
MEMBERS OF THE JURY, THAT THEY DIDN'T.
STARTING IN THE EARLY 1950'S STUDIES WERE PUBLISHED
THAT LINKED SMOKING TO CANCER. WE SHOWED YOU THOSE. THEY
WERE WIDELY REPORTS IN POPULAR MAGAZINES LIKE READER'S DIGEST
AND TIME AND LIFE. WE SAW IN 1953 WE HEARD ABOUT THE MOUSE
SKIN PAINTING STUDY, AND YOU SAW HOW IT WAS PUBLISHED IN LIFE
MAGAZINE, A VERY POPULAR MAGAZINE AT THE TIME. WE KNOW FOR A
FACT THAT PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT THESE STUDIES BECAUSE IN
JUNE OF 1954 GALLUP RAN A NATIONAL POLL WHERE THEY SAID, "HAD
YOU HAD HEARD OR READ ANYTHING RECENTLY TO THE EFFECT THAT
THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAY BE A CAUSE OF CANCER OF THE LUNG?"
90 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ANSWERED "YES" TO THAT QUESTION.
JERRY HARRIS WAS 14 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME, AND THERE IS NO
EVIDENCE HE WAS A REGULAR SMOKER THEN.
TEN YEARS LATER IN 1964 THE SURGEON GENERAL
PUBLISHED HIS LANDMARK REPORT ANNOUNCING TO THE WORLD THAT
CIGARETTE SMOKING WAS A PROVEN CAUSE OF LUNG CANCER IN MEN.
BIG DEAL AND GOT A TON OF PUBLICITY. IT WAS LITERALLY
FRONT-PAGE NEWS. IT WAS THE LEAD STORY ON THE NIGHTLY NEWS
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
104 CAST. IT WAS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE NEWSPAPERS, ON THE
COVER OF MAJOR -- NATIONAL MAGAZINES. PEOPLE WERE TALKING
ABOUT IT, AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT IT BIG TIME AND HERE'S
HOW IT WAS COVERED ON CBS NEWS WITH HARRY REASONER.
(VIDEOTAPE PLAYING.)
MR. COFER: JERRY HARRIS IS 24 YEARS OLD WHEN THAT
REPORT CAME OUT.
NOW, IN 1964 IN ADDITION TO CONCLUDING THAT
CIGARETTE SMOKING WAS A PROVEN CAUSE OF CANCER IN MEN, THE
SURGEON GENERAL ALSO CONCLUDED THAT SMOKING WAS NOT AN
ADDICTION, BUT MORE ACCURATELY CHARACTERIZED AS A HABIT. AND
YOU HEARD THE REASON WHY, IS BECAUSE THE DEFINITION AT THE
TIME REQUIRED THAT FOR SOMETHING TO BE ADDICTING IT HAD TO BE
INTOXICATING, AND CIGARETTES ARE NOT INTOXICATING. AND IT
WASN'T UNTIL 24 YEARS LATER IN 1988 THAT THE SURGEON GENERAL
CHANGED ITS DEFINITION, ADOPTED A DIFFERENT DEFINITION AND
SAID INTOXICATION ISN'T REQUIRED ANY MORE AND SO CIGARETTES
ARE NOW ADDICTING. THE BOTTOM LINE, THOUGH, IS BETWEEN 1964
AND 1988, WHEN THE COMPANY SAID, "IT'S A HABIT AND NOT AN
ADDICTION," THEY WERE AGREEING WITH THE SURGEON GENERAL.
NOW, AS A RESULT OF THE 1964 SURGEON GENERAL'S
REPORT CONGRESS GOT INVOLVED AND HELD HEARINGS. AND IN 1966,
CONGRESS REQUIRED THIS FIRST WARNING LABEL GO ON THE
CIGARETTE PACK. CONGRESS WROTE THE WARNING. TOLD THE
COMPANIES EXACTLY WHAT IT WOULD SAY, HOW BIG IT WOULD BE AND
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
105 WHERE IT WOULD BE PLACED AND THAT WAS THE FIRST WARNING.
"CAUTION, CIGARETTE SMOKING MAY BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH."
FROM JANUARY 1966 ON, MEMBERS OF THE JURY, EVERY PACK OF
CIGARETTES SOLD IN THIS COUNTRY CAME WITH A WARNING ON THE
SIDE.
FOUR YEARS LATER, IN 1970, THE SURGEON GENERAL'S
WARNING CHANGED. CONGRESS WROTE A NEW WARNING, A STRONGER
WARNING AND SAID, "WARNING: THE SURGEON GENERAL HAS
DETERMINED THAT SMOKING IS DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH."
AND THEN, IN 1985, THE ROTATING WARNINGS WENT ON
THE PACK, AND LET ME SHOW YOU TWO OF THEM. YOU SAW THIS
DURING TRIAL. "SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING: SMOKING CAUSES
LUNG CANCER, HEART DISEASE, EMPHYSEMA AND MAY COMPLICATE
PREGNANCY." THOSE ARE THREE OF THE VERY DISEASES THAT
MR. HARRIS HAD, COPD, EMPHYSEMA IS A PART OF COPD, HEART
DISEASE AND LUNG CANCER. BUT WHAT'S MORE, THE WARNING ALSO
TOLD HIM HOW TO AVOID 'EM. "SMOKING CAUSES LUNG CANCER,
HEART DISEASE AND EMPHYSEMA. QUITTING SMOKING NOW GREATLY
REDUCES SERIOUS RISK TO YOUR HEALTH." THAT WAS 1985.
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE KNOW THAT MR. HARRIS GOT A
MORE PERSONAL WARNING IN OCTOBER OF 1985 THAT ANY PACK
WARNING COULD EVER BE, AND THAT'S BECAUSE IN OCTOBER OF 1985,
HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER ON HIS LEFT VOCAL CORD, AND HE
TOLD HIS LONGTIME FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR LEWIS JENNINGS,
"CIGARETTES CAUSED IT, AND IF I KEEP ON I'M GOING TO KILL
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
106 MYSELF WITH THEM." BUT EVEN THOUGH HE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD THE
RISKS, HE DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR THE NEXT 11 YEARS TO TRY
TO QUIT SMOKING.
NOW, ONE QUICK POINT ABOUT MR. JENNINGS. ON
CROSS-EXAMINATION HE SAID, "WELL, I HAD A CONVERSATION AT ONE
TIME WITH MR. HARRIS AND HE TOLD ME HE WAS CONFUSED ABOUT THE
RISKS." YOU REMEMBER ON REDIRECT I SHOWED HIM HIS DEPOSITION
AND REMINDED HIM WHAT HE SAID, AND I REMINDED HIM THAT HE
TESTIFIED, WELL, THAT CONVERSATION OCCURRED IN 1999, AFTER
MR. HARRIS HAD ALREADY HAD HIS LARYNGECTOMY, AND AFTER HE
QUIT SMOKING. AND MEMBERS OF THE JURY, IT'S CRITICALLY --
WELL, IT'S JUST CLEAR THAT BY 1985 THERE IS NO WAY THAT
MR. HARRIS COULD HAVE BEEN CONFUSED ABOUT THE RISKS OF
SMOKING.
SO WE'VE BEEN WITH YOU FOR A WEEK. WE THINK THIS
CASE COMES DOWN TO FIVE SIMPLE WORDS, JERRY HARRIS DIDN'T
EVEN TRY.
IN 1985 JERRY HARRIS WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER ON
HIS LEFT TRUE VOCAL CORD. HE WAS TREATED WITH RADIATION AND
HE WAS CURED. HE DODGED A BULLET. HE WAS CURED. HE TOLD
HIS NEIGHBOR THAT CIGARETTES CAUSED THIS CANCER AND IF I KEEP
ON I'M GOING TO KILL MYSELF WITH IT. DESPITE THAT KNOWLEDGE
HE DID NOT MAKE A SINGLE EFFORT TO QUIT FOR 11 YEARS.
NOW, IN HER CLOSING ARGUMENT, MS. LONDON SAID,
"MR. HARRIS DIDN'T KNOW HE HAD A RISK AT GETTING SICK. HE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
107 COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN. THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT HAD HE
KNOWN." HE KNEW IN '85 AND HE DIDN'T EVEN TRY. SIX YEARS
LATER IN 1991, HIS BROTHER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH THROAT CANCER
AND WAS CURED AND MR. HARRIS DIDN'T EVEN TRY. THE NEXT YEAR
HIS SISTER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH THROAT CANCER AND MR. HARRIS
DIDN'T EVEN TRY.
IN 1995 HE HAD A HEART ATTACK AND HIS SISTER DIED
OF THROAT CANCER AND MR. HARRIS DIDN'T EVEN TRY.
IN 1997, AND YES, IT WAS '97, AND I'LL SHOW YOU
THAT LATER, IN '97 AFTER HE HAD SURGERY ON HIS SECOND THROAT
CANCER, DO YOU REMEMBER THE EVIDENCE, HE DIDN'T SMOKE WHEN HE
WAS IN THE HOSPITAL. AND WHEN HE CAME HOME, HIS WIFE SAID,
"WELL, HE STARTED TO SMOKE AGAIN AS SOON AS HIS THROAT FELT
BETTER."
IT IS UNDISPUTED, MEMBERS OF THE JURY, THAT UNTIL
MR. HARRIS HAD HIS LARYNGECTOMY IN 1999, HE MADE EXACTLY ONE
UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO QUIT SMOKING. ONE TIME. SOMETIME
AFTER '96, AFTER PATCHES WERE AVAILABLE OVER-THE-COUNTER, HE
BOUGHT A NICOTINE PATCH AND HE WORE IT FOR SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
THREE AND SEVEN DAYS, BUT HE CONTINUED TO SMOKE WHILE HE HAD
IT ON. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE, OTHER THAN WHEN HE WAS IN THE
HOSPITAL, HE NEVER WENT A SINGLE DAY WITHOUT SMOKING. HE PUT
THE PATCH ON AND KEPT SMOKING. HOW COULD HE HAVE HAD
WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS WHEN HE WAS WEARING THE PATCH WHEN HE
KEPT SMOKING? SO HE GOT A RASH AND HE TOOK IT OFF AND THAT
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
108 WAS IT. THAT WAS HIS ONE UNSUCCESSFUL "QUIT ATTEMPT".
THAT'S THE EVIDENCE. THAT'S THE ONLY EVIDENCE IN THE CASE.
SO WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT? WELL, DR. BURNS TOLD YOU
WHY IT WAS IMPORTANT. REMEMBER DOLFF AND PETO, MR. RICHARD
DOLFF AND MR. RICHARD PETO AND THEIR STUDY, THE 50-YEAR STUDY
OF DOCTORS? IF YOU QUIT SMOKING BY AGE 30, SO FOR MR. HARRIS
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN 1970, YOU AVOID ALL OF THE RISK OF
SMOKING. ALL YOUR EXCESS RISK. IF YOU QUIT SMOKING BY 40,
YOU GET NINE YEARS BACK.
AND LET'S GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. AND AS DR. BURNS
HIMSELF WROTE IN THE 2007 INTRODUCTION TO THE IR HANDBOOK OF
CANCER PREVENTION, THIS IS DR. BURNS, "FIGURE 1 MAKES A VALUE
OF CESSATION CLEAR AND DEMONSTRATES THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF
SMOKING CAUSED MORTALITY, SMOKING CAUSED DEATH, IS AVOIDABLE
BY QUITTING PRIOR TO AGE 45. EVEN IN OLDER AGES A
SUBSTANTIAL FRACTION OF THE EXCESS MORTALITY DUE TO SMOKING
CAN BE AVOIDED BY QUITTING."
MEMBERS OF THE JURY, MR. HARRIS TURNED 45 IN 1985,
THE SAME YEAR THAT HE WAS DIAGNOSED AND CURED OF VOCAL CORD
CANCER. AND AS DR. BURNS ADMITTED, IF MR. HARRIS HAD QUIT
SMOKING, LET'S GO BACK TO THE FIRST WARNING, IN 1966, WHEN HE
WAS 26 YEARS OLD, AND THE WARNING LABELS FIRST ON THE
PACKAGES, HE WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED HIS RISK OF
DYING OF LUNG CANCER IN 2012.
DR. BURNS TOLD YOU, IF MR. HARRIS WOULD HAVE QUIT
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
109 SMOKING IN 1970 WHEN HE WAS 30 YEARS OLD AND THE STRONGER
WARNING LABELS WERE ON THE PACK, HE WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY
REDUCED HIS RISK OF DYING OF SMALL-CELL LUNG CANCER 42 YEARS
LATER.
IF MR. HARRIS WOULD HAVE QUIT SMOKING IN 1974 WHEN
HE WAS 34 AND QUIT DRINKING, HE WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY
REDUCED HIS RISK OF GETTING SMALL-CELL LUNG CANCER, DYING OF
SMALL-CELL LUNG CANCER IN 2012.
FINALLY, IF MR. HARRIS HAD QUIT SMOKING IN 1985
WHEN HE WAS 45 YEARS OLD AND CURED OF VOCAL CORD CANCER, HE
WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED HIS RISK OF DYING OF
SMALL-CELL LUNG CANCER 27 YEARS LATER. BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
MR. HARRIS DIDN'T QUIT AND HE DIDN'T EVEN TRY. SO LET'S LOOK
AT THE VERDICT FORM.
THE FIRST QUESTION ASKED, "DO YOU FIND THAT THE
PLAINTIFF HAS PROVED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT
MR. HARRIS WAS ADDICTED TO NICOTINE IN CIGARETTES?" SO WHAT
WAS THE EVIDENCE? WELL, DR. BURNS TOLD YOU THAT IT WAS HIS
OPINION THAT JERRY HARRIS WAS ADDICTED. THAT IS THE ONLY
EVIDENCE PLAINTIFF PRESENTED ON THAT ISSUE. DR. BURNS. THAT
WAS IT. THE ONLY EVIDENCE.
OF COURSE YOU ALSO LEARNED THAT DR. BURNS HAS BEEN
TESTIFYING FOR 30 YEARS, AND HE HAS NEVER ONCE, NOT ONE TIME
TESTIFIED THAT A PLAINTIFF WAS NOT ADDICTED.
HE ALSO TOLD YOU, WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE AT ALL, THAT
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
110 MRS. HARRIS IS ADDICTED AND THAT KRISTA HARRIS IS ADDICTED
TOO. HE NEVER EVEN MET KRISTA HARRIS. HOW COULD HE POSSIBLY
KNOW WHETHER SHE WAS ADDICTED. THE EVIDENCE WAS SHE QUIT
SMOKING COLD TURKEY FOR FIVE YEARS. HOW COULD HE POSSIBLY
KNOW WHETHER SHE WAS ADDICTED? WELL, IT'S BECAUSE IT'S HIS
TEST FOR ADDICTION. BURNS SAYS, WELL, NICOTINE IS ADDICTIVE.
IF YOU SMOKE A LOT OF CIGARETTES YOU ARE ADDICTED. PERIOD.
WE CALLED DR. KAPLAN. DR. KAPLAN IS A PSYCHIATRIST
HERE IN TAMPA. HE ACTUALLY TREATS PEOPLE. HE HELPS PEOPLE
OVERCOME ADDICTIONS, AND HE HELPS PEOPLE TO QUIT SMOKING
WHETHER YOU'RE DIAGNOSED AS ADDICTED OR NOT. AND WHAT
DR. KAPLAN TOLD YOU IS THAT MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND
PSYCHIATRISTS LIKE HIMSELF USE THE DSM-V TO DIAGNOSE PATIENTS
WITH MENTAL DISORDERS, INCLUDING ADDICTION.
HE TOLD YOU THAT BASED ON DSM-V IT IS HIS OPINION
THAT MR. HARRIS WAS NOT ADDICTED, BUT DR. KAPLAN TOLD YOU
THAT ADDICTION IS A MENTAL DISORDER. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS
LAWSUIT THE WORD "ADDICTION" IS NOT A WORD CASUALLY USED TO
DESCRIBE WHY WE DO SOMETHING. WHY DO YOU RUN? I'M ADDICTED
TO IT. WHY DO I EAT CHOCOLATE? I'M ADDICTED TO IT. WHY DO
I WATCH THIS TELEVISION SHOW? I'M ADDICTED TO IT, DAD. FOR
PURPOSES OF THIS LAWSUIT, ADDICTION IS A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS.
AND DR. BURNS TOLD YOU AS A THRESHOLD MATTER BEFORE SOMEONE
QUALIFIES AS ADDICTED, THERE MUST BE A SHOWING THAT THE USE
OF THE SUBSTANCE LED TO CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT.
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
111 IN OTHER WORDS, IT HAS TO CAUSE A PROBLEM IN THE PERSON'S
LIFE. IN HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS FAMILY, OR IN HIS WORK OR
IN SOME OTHER WAY.
NOW, THE BEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS TO COMPARE
HOW MR. HARRIS' DRINKING COMPARES WITH HIS SMOKING. HIS
DRINKING CAUSED ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS IN HIS LIFE AND HIS
RELATIONSHIPS. MR. HARRIS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED A PATTERN OF
USE OF ALCOHOL THAT LED TO CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT.
THERE'S NO QUESTION, NONE, THAT MR. HARRIS WAS ADDICTED TO
ALCOHOL. BUT HIS SMOKING DID NOT DISRUPT HIS RELATIONSHIPS,
OR HIS MARRIAGE OR HIS WORK IN ANY WAY. WHILE IT'S TRUE HE
SMOKED A LOT OF CIGARETTES FOR A LONG TIME, THAT IS NOT THE
SAME THING AS BEING ADDICTED. AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT
ANY DOCTOR THAT MR. HARRIS EVER SAW DIAGNOSED HIM AS
ADDICTED. THE BEST PLAINTIFF COULD DO OUT OF THOSE 19,000
PAGES OF MEDICAL RECORDS IS COME UP WITH ONE RECORD THAT
SAID, "HISTORY OF TOBACCO ABUSE." AND DR. KAPLAN TOLD YOU
THAT'S NOT A DIAGNOSIS OF ADDICTION. THAT'S DOCTOR CODE FOR,
"THE PATIENT USED TO BE A REGULAR SMOKER." THIS IS AN
IMPORTANT QUESTION BECAUSE IF YOU BELIEVE PLAINTIFF HAS NOT
SATISFIED HER BURDEN OF PROOF THAT HE WAS, IN FACT, ADDICTED,
THEN YOU CHECK "NO" TO QUESTION ONE AND THE CASE IS OVER.
NOW, LET ME SAY SOMETHING ABOUT PROOF. PLAINTIFF
DOES HAVE TO PROVE IT'S MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, BUT PLAINTIFF
HAS TO PROVE IT TO YOUR SATISFACTION. YOU KNOW THIS "JUST A
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
112 HAIR, MAYBE JUST A LITTLE BIT, OH YOU CAN HAVE DOUBTS," THE
BOTTOM LINE IS YOU'RE BEING ASKED TO MAKE VERY SERIOUS
DECISIONS IN THIS CASE AND PLAINTIFF HAS THE BURDEN OF
CARRYING AND PROVING THAT SHE IS ENTITLED TO THOSE FACTUAL
FINDINGS. YOU SHOULD HOLD PLAINTIFF TO THEIR BURDEN.
QUESTION 2, HAS PLAINTIFF PROVED THAT IT IS MORE
LIKELY THAN NOT THAT MR. HARRIS' ORAL CAVITY CANCER
MANIFESTED ON OR BEFORE NOVEMBER 21, 1996? WELL, YOU
REMEMBER THAT MRS. HARRIS TESTIFIED SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER.
SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER WHETHER HER HUSBAND HAD HIS ORAL CANCER
IN '96 OR '97. SO PLAINTIFF SHOWED YOU ONE MEDICAL RECORD
THAT WAS PREPARED ON FEBRUARY 3, 2012, BY MR. HARRIS'
RADIATION ONCOLOGIST THAT REFERRED TO HIS SUPRAGLOTTIC CANCER
IN 1996. THAT'S IT.
NOW, ON CROSS SHE TRIED TO SHOW YOU ONE OTHER
RECORD THAT SAID IT HAPPENED OCTOBER '96, BUT IT ALSO SAID HE
HAD A COMPLETE LARYNGECTOMY IN OCTOBER '96. WE KNOW THAT'S
NOT RIGHT. SO THIS IS THE RECORD. THIS IS THE ONE PIECE OF
EVIDENCE THAT PLAINTIFF IS RELYING ON TO MEET HER BURDEN TO
PROVE THAT THE CANCER MANIFESTED IN '96. SO IT WAS PREPARED
15 YEARS AFTER MR. HARRIS' CANCER. IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH AT
LEAST SEVEN OTHER MEDICAL RECORDS IN THE CASE THAT I SHOWED
YOU. AND IT SAYS -- "IN '96 HE UNDERWENT A SUPRAGLOTTIC
LARYNGECTOMY SQUAMES CELL CARCINOMA OF THE EPIGLOTTIS."
THAT'S THEIR COMPLETE EVIDENCE.
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
113 NEXT. WE ALSO KNOW THIS RECORD SAYS THINGS THAT
ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE FACTS. "HE HAS A LONG HISTORY OF
CIGARETTE SMOKING IN THE PAST, STARTING AT AGE 13 AND SMOKED
AS MUCH AS FOUR PACKS A DAY." THERE IS NO EVIDENCE HE SMOKED
FOUR PACKS A DAY. MRS. HARRIS SAID IN HER DEPOSITION ONE TO
TWO PACKS A DAY. MRS. HARRIS SAID ON A HANDWRITTEN FORM,
I'LL SHOW YOU IN A MOMENT, TWO PACKS A DAY. MRS. HARRIS SAID
WHEN SHE GOT TO TRIAL, TWO TO THREE PACKS A DAY. NO ONE SAID
FOUR PACKS A DAY. HE HAS DENIED DRINKING ALCOHOL. WELL,
IT'S UNCONTROVERTED THAT HE WAS AN ALCOHOLIC AND HE WAS A
REGULAR DRINKER FOR YEARS UP TO 1974. SO THAT'S THE ONE
PIECE OF EVIDENCE THE PLAINTIFF HAS.
NOW, LET'S CONTRAST THAT. I SHOWED YOU SEVEN
RECORDS, BUT I'M ONLY GOING TO SHOW YOU TWO THAT'S ALL, I
THINK, FRANKLY, YOU NEED TO SEE. THE FIRST IS, THIS WAS A
RECORD PREPARED ON FEBRUARY 5TH, 2001, BY DR. TRINA ESPINOLA,
THE PHYSICIAN WHO ACTUALLY PERFORMED THE SURGERY. AND HERE'S
WHAT DR. ESPINOLA SAID, "HE HAD FULL-COURSE RADIATION THERAPY
IN 1997, AND LEFT MODIFIED RADICAL NECK DISSECTION AND
EPIGLOTTECTOMY." WHEN MS. LONDON TOLD YOU THAT DR. BURNS
SAID MAYBE HE HAD RADIATION IN '96, AND THEN HE HAD THE
SURGERY IN '97, THAT'S NOT WHAT THE SURGEON WHO DID THE
DISSECTION SAID. HE HAD FULL-COURSE RADIATION THERAPY IN '97
AND LEFT MODIFIED RADICAL NECK DISSECTION AND EPIGLOTTECTOMY.
I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT ARGUMENT WELL, MAYBE HE HAD IT
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
114 IN OCTOBER AND MAYBE THEY WAITED UNTIL MAY TO OPERATE. ARE
YOU KIDDING ME? SOMEONE WHO HAS ALREADY HAD ONE HEAD AND
NECK CANCER, YOU THINK AN ENT IS GOING TO SAY, "WELL, LET'S
JUST WAIT EIGHT MONTHS, YOU KNOW, MAYBE, HOPEFULLY WON'T
SPREAD." THEY GO IN, THEY TAKE THE CANCER OUT THE VERY FIRST
THING AND THEN THEY GIVE YOU RADIATION AROUND THE MARGINS
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T CUT EVERYTHING OUT AND SO YOU GET RADIATION
AROUND THE MARGINS.
AND YOU REMEMBER MRS. HARRIS TESTIFIED THAT IT WAS
DR. ESPINOLA WHO DISCOVERED THE CANCER. MR. HARRIS HAD A
SORE THROAT AND WENT TO SEE HER. SHE'S THE ONE THAT
DIAGNOSED HIM. DOESN'T IT MAKE SENSE THAT THE THROAT DOCTOR
WHO DIAGNOSED THE CANCER AND PERFORMED THE SURGERY WOULD KNOW
WHEN SHE DID IT?
BUT HERE'S AN EVEN MORE PERSUASIVE PIECE OF
EVIDENCE, MEMBERS OF THE JURY. THIS WAS FILLED OUT BY
MRS. HARRIS HERSELF. REMEMBER SHE TOLD YOU SHE'S THE ONE
THAT WROTE THIS. "EPIGLOTTIS THYROID. OPERATION PERFORMED.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY. OPERATION PERFORMED. EPIGLOTTIS
THYROID MAY OF 1997. REASON FOR OPERATION, CANCER."
SHE HAD THE SURGEON WHO PERFORMED THE SURGERY. YOU
HAVE THE PLAINTIFF HERSELF AND THEY BOTH SAY 1997. SO IF
THERE WAS A REAL ISSUE ABOUT THAT, WHY DIDN'T THEY BRING IN
DR. COTMAN? WHY DIDN'T THEY BRING IN DR. ESPINOLA? WHY
DIDN'T THEY BRING IN KRISTA HARRIS? SHE GOT MARRIED IN APRIL
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
115 OF '96, DON'T YOU THINK SHE WOULD HAVE REMEMBERED IF HER
FATHER THEN HAD A SECOND THROAT CANCER A FEW MONTHS LATER?
WHY DIDN'T THEY BRING IN WILLIAM, HIS BROTHER? THEY HAD THE
BURDEN OF PROOF AND WHAT DID THEY BRING YOU? ONE RECORD, AND
THEY WANT YOU TO IGNORE THE RECORD THAT PLAINTIFF HERSELF
PREPARED.
HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE, IT'S PLAINTIFF'S BURDEN TO
PROVE THAT THE SUPRAGLOTTIC CANCER MANIFESTED ON OR BEFORE
NOVEMBER 21, 1996. AND I SUBMIT TO YOU, MEMBERS OF THE JURY,
THAT IF ONE THING IS CLEAR, THE EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING THAT
IT DID NOT, AND THE CANCER DID NOT OCCUR AND MANIFEST IN
1997. I RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST THE ANSWER TO QUESTION 2 IS
"NO".
SO LET'S GO TO THE NEXT QUESTION. "HAS PLAINTIFF
PROVED IT'S MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT MRS. HARRIS' (SIC)
ADDICTION WAS A LEGAL CAUSE, I WANT YOU TO FOCUS ON THAT
PHRASE, A LEGAL CAUSE OF MR. HARRIS' CORONARY HEART DISEASE
OR MR. HARRIS' ORAL CAVITY CANCER?" I DON'T LIKE TO OBJECT
IN CLOSING ARGUMENT BECAUSE THAT'S A LAWYER'S OPPORTUNITY,
AND THE JUDGE TELLS YOU THAT WHAT WE SAY ISN'T EVIDENCE, BUT
IT'S A LAWYER'S OPPORTUNITY TO SUMMARIZE WHAT HE OR SHE
THINKS THE EVIDENCE IS. BUT I DID OBJECT WHEN MS. LONDON
SAID, "A CAUSE" BECAUSE I WANTED YOU TO KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT
IT HAS TO BE "A LEGAL CAUSE". AND SO, LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.
YOU REMEMBER IN OPENING STATEMENT I TOLD YOU THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
116 LAW MAKES A DISTINCTION BETWEEN SOMETHING THAT'S A CAUSE IN
FACT AND SOMETHING THAT'S A LEGAL CAUSE. AND THE EXAMPLE I
GAVE YOU IS A MAN WHO GOT HIT BY A TRUCK. AND MS. LONDON
USED THAT EXAMPLE, SPENT SOME TIME ON THAT IN HER CLOSING
ARGUMENT. WELL, NOW THAT YOU HAVE HEARD THE EVIDENCE, LET ME
GIVE YOU A BETTER EXAMPLE.
SO IN FLORIDA WE ALL LOVE OUR BEAUTIFUL BEACHES AND
WE GO AND WE LOVE TO LAYOUT IN THE SUN. BUT WHEN WE GO TO
THE DOCTOR, WHAT THE DOCTOR SAYS IS, "USE SUN SCREEN, WEAR A
HAT, COVER UP AND DON'T GET TOO MUCH SUN." SO SUPPOSE A MAN
GOES TO THE DOCTOR AND THE DOCTOR IS DOING THE PHYSICAL AND
LOOKS AT THE MAN'S ARM AND SAYS, "YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'VE GOT A
SPOT ON YOUR ARM. IT'S NOT CANCEROUS, BUT WE NEED TO TAKE
CARE OF IT BEFORE IT GETS BAD. SO WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS
GO OUT AND MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH MY RECEPTIONIST AND COME
BACK NEXT WEEK AND WE'LL TAKE IT OFF." AND HE DOESN'T DO IT.
SO SIX MONTHS LATER HE'S BACK IN AND THE DOCTOR
LOOKS AT THE SPOT ON HIS ARM AND SAYS, "YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'VE
GOT A BASAL CELL CARCINOMA. IT'S CANCER. IT HASN'T SPREAD.
WE CAN TAKE IT OFF, BUT NOW YOU'LL HAVE A SCAR, AND YOU'LL
NEED STITCHES. SO WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS I WANT YOU TO GO
OUT AND I WANT YOU TO TELL THE RECEPTIONIST YOU NEED AN
APPOINTMENT TO COME IN AND GET THAT CANCER TAKEN OFF." AND
HE DOESN'T DO IT.
SO SIX MONTHS LATER HE COMES BACK AND HE SAYS, "YOU
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
117 KNOW, I'M NOT FEELING WELL AT ALL. I'M KIND OF RUN DOWN AND
TIRED. THE DOCTOR SAYS -- HE EXAMINES HIM AND SAYS, "MERCY,
YOU HAVE A MALIGNANT MELANOMA AND IT SPREAD THROUGHOUT YOUR
BODY. IT'S BAD. IT'S REALLY BAD. IT STARTED IN YOUR ARM.
IT'S BAD." WHAT WAS THE CAUSE, IN FACT, OF HIS MALIGNANT
MELANOMA? THE SUN, BUT WHAT WAS THE LEGAL CAUSE? HE DIDN'T
TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS. HE DIDN'T FOLLOW HIS DOCTOR'S ADVICE,
AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CAUSE IN FACT AND A LEGAL
CAUSE, AND MEMBERS OF THE JURY, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
HERE. EVEN IF YOU BELIEVE THAT SMOKING WAS THE CAUSE IN FACT
OF MR. HARRIS' CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE -- CORONARY HEART
DISEASE AND HIS ORAL CANCER, AN ADDICTION TO NICOTINE WAS NOT
A LEGAL CAUSE. YOU KNOW WHAT THE LEGAL CAUSE WAS? HE DIDN'T
TRY TO QUIT. AND THE ONLY THING, AT LEAST THE ONE THING THAT
BURNS AND KAPLAN AGREED ON IS THAT ALL SMOKERS, INCLUDING
ADDICTED SMOKERS, HAVE THE ABILITY TO QUIT. WHETHER THEY
QUIT DEPENDS ON THEIR MOTIVATION AND PERSISTENCE, BUT THEY
HAVE TO WANT TO QUIT AND THEY HAVE TO TRY TO QUIT. THE
BOTTOM LINE IS ADDICTED SMOKERS CAN AND DO QUIT SMOKING EVERY
DAY. THEY QUIT WHEN THEY MAKE UP THEIR MIND, IT'S MORE
IMPORTANT TO THEM NOT TO SMOKE THAN IT IS TO SMOKE. WHERE IS
THE EVIDENCE THAT MR. HARRIS WAS ANY DIFFERENT THAN THE 60
MILLION PEOPLE WHO QUIT SMOKING? THERE SIMPLY WAS NONE.
MR. HARRIS ALWAYS HAD THE ABILITY TO QUIT SMOKING
WHENEVER HE WANTED TO QUIT, WHENEVER HE WAS WILLING TO MAKE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
118 AN EFFORT TO QUIT. UNFORTUNATELY, HE WAITED UNTIL HE GOT HIS
LARYNGECTOMY BEFORE HE GAVE IT UP. MEMBERS OF THE JURY, THE
EVIDENCE IS COMPELLING THAT AN ADDICTION TO NICOTINE WAS NOT
A LEGAL CAUSE OF MR. HARRIS' HEART DISEASE, OR HIS THROAT
CANCER OR HIS DEATH. PLAINTIFF HAS NOT OFFERED ANY EVIDENCE
IN THIS CASE THAT AN ADDICTION TO NICOTINE PREVENTED
MR. HARRIS FROM QUITTING.
HERE'S THE COURT'S INSTRUCTION ON LEGAL CAUSE, AND
YOU'LL HAVE THIS WHEN YOU TAKE IT BACK.
THE COURT: THAT'S THE WHOLE PAGE. YOU'RE GOING TO
GET THIS FROM ME EVENTUALLY.
MR. COFER: I'M NOT GOING TO READ IT. WHAT I'M
GOING TO DO IS TELL YOU WHAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT. "IN ORDER
FOR ADDICTION TO BE A LEGAL CAUSE OF MR. HARRIS' DEATH,
PLAINTIFF HAS TO SHOW FIRST, HE WAS, IN FACT, ADDICTED, AND
THAT ADDICTION WAS SO STRONG AND SO SUBSTANTIAL THAT IT CAN
BE REASONABLY SAID, BUT FOR THE ADDICTION HE WOULD HAVE QUIT
AND HE WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN SICK." THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF
THAT. THERE WAS NONE. AND WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT? BECAUSE
IF MR. HARRIS WOULD HAVE STOPPED SMOKING IN 1985 -- NEXT ONE,
PLEASE -- WHEN HE WAS CURED OF VOCAL CORD CANCER, TEN YEARS
LATER IN 1995, HIS RISK OF HAVING A HEART ATTACK WOULD HAVE
BEEN THE SAME AS A NONSMOKER. DR. FURMAN TOLD YOU THAT. AND
HERE'S WHAT DR. BURNS, THE CDC FROM THE 2010 REPORT,
"QUITTING SMOKING REDUCES THE RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
119 AND DEATH. THE RISK FOR HEART ATTACK DROPS SHARPLY JUST ONE
YEAR AFTER SMOKERS QUIT ENTIRELY. EVEN PATIENTS WHO ALREADY
HAD A HEART ATTACK CUT THEIR RISK OF HAVING ANOTHER ONE BY A
THIRD TO A HALF IF THEY QUIT SMOKING." HE HAD NOT HAD A
HEART ATTACK IN '85. "AFTER TWO TO FIVE YEARS THE CHANCE OF
STROKE COULD FALL TO ABOUT THE SAME LEVEL AS NONSMOKERS."
SO IF MR. HARRIS WOULD HAVE QUIT SMOKING IN 1985,
HIS RISK -- HE WOULD HAVE HAD NO EXCESS RISK OF SMOKING BY
1985 WHEN HE HAD HIS HEART ATTACK. LIKEWISE, IF HE WOULD
HAVE QUIT SMOKING IN '85 WHEN HE HAD THAT FIRST CANCER, HE
WOULD HAVE AVOIDED HIS RISK OF CONTRACTING A SECOND ORAL
CANCER. THIS IS FROM IARC. "THE RISK OF CANCER OF THE
LARYNX DECLINES RATHER RAPIDLY AFTER THE CESSATION OF
SMOKING. NO DETECTABLE ELEVATION COMPARED WITH NEVER-SMOKERS
WAS SEEN AMONG SUBJECTS WHO HAD QUIT SMOKING FOR AT LEAST TEN
YEARS." THIS IS FROM IARC, AND USED BY DR. BURNS. IF HE
QUIT SMOKING IN 1985, HIS RISK OF GETTING AN ORAL CANCER IN
'97 IS THE SAME AS A NEVER-SMOKER. IF HE QUIT SMOKING IN
'85, HIS RISK OF GETTING A HEART ATTACK IN '95 IS THE SAME AS
A NEVER-SMOKER, RIGHT?
AND WITH RESPECT TO HIS HEART ATTACK, LET'S PUT UP
THE NEXT SLIDE, THE EVIDENCE WAS THE SMOKING WASN'T EVEN WHAT
CAUSED IT. MR. HARRIS HAD SEVERE AGGRESSIVE PREMATURE
ARTHROSCLEROSIS. HE HAD ALL THESE RISK FACTORS, SMOKING,
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, HIGH CHOLESTEROL, A HIGH FAT DIET,
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
120 ALCOHOL, HE WAS A MALE, HE HAD A FAMILY HISTORY OF HEART
DISEASE, HE WAS STRESSED, HE WAS 55 YEARS OLD. IT IS
UNDISPUTED THAT EVEN AFTER HE QUIT SMOKING IN 1999 HIS HEART
DISEASE KEPT GETTING WORSE AND WORSE. THAT IN ITSELF IS
PROOF THAT SMOKING WAS NOT WHAT WAS DRIVING HIS HEART
DISEASE. BECAUSE HAD IT BEEN SMOKING WHEN HE QUIT IN '99,
HIS SMOKING -- I'M SORRY, HIS HEART DISEASE SHOULD HAVE
STOPPED PROGRESSING. YET SEVEN YEARS AFTER HE SMOKED HIS
LAST CIGARETTE HE HAD A MASSIVE STROKE, AND THE SAME RISK
FACTORS THAT CAUSE HEART DISEASE CAUSE STROKES.
WE BROUGHT YOU DR. JOSHUA FURMAN, A BOARD CERTIFIED
CARDIOLOGIST FROM ONE OF THE FINEST CENTERS IN THIS STATE WHO
HAS BEEN TREATING PATIENTS IN FLORIDA FOR HEART ATTACKS AND
STROKES FOR 34 YEARS, AND EXPLAINED TO YOU EXACTLY HOW THIS
WORKS AND WHAT THE RISK FACTORS ARE, AND WHAT THE MECHANICS
ARE OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, AND HE TOLD YOU THAT
MR. HARRIS WOULD HAVE HAD A HEART ATTACK AND A STROKE IF HE
HAD NEVER SMOKED A SINGLE CIGARETTE. TO THE EXTENT SMOKING,
AND IT IS A RISK FACTOR, PLAYED ANY ROLE IN HIS HEART
DISEASE, IT WAS INSIGNIFICANT. AND SINCE SMOKING DIDN'T
CAUSE IT, IT'S NOT A CLASS-QUALIFYING DISEASE. LET ME SAY
THAT AGAIN. SMOKING IS A RISK FACTOR FOR HEART DISEASE, BUT
IN MR. HARRIS' CASE HE HAD AN AGGRESSIVE PREMATURE
ARTHROSCLEROSIS WHICH WAS BEING DRIVEN BY HIS OTHER RISK
FACTORS, PRINCIPALLY GENETICS, AND HIGH CHOLESTEROL AND HIGH
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
121 BLOOD PRESSURE. AND DR. FURMAN, THE ONLY CARDIOLOGIST WHO
TESTIFIED IN THIS CASE, THE ONLY, OTHER THAN DR. KAPLAN, A
PHYSICIAN WHO IS LICENSED IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA TO PRACTICE
MEDICINE TOLD YOU IT'S HIS OPINION TO A REASONABLE DEGREE OF
MEDICAL CERTAINTY THAT MR. HARRIS WOULD HAVE HAD A HEART
ATTACK AND A STROKE HAD HE NEVER SMOKED A SINGLE CIGARETTE.
SO LET'S GET BACK TO QUESTION 3(A) AND 3(B).
MEMBERS OF THE JURY, THE ANSWER TO QUESTION 3(A), "HAS
PLAINTIFF PROVED THAT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT MR. HARRIS'
ADDICTION WAS A LEGAL CAUSE OF HIS CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE?"
THE ANSWER IS "NO" FOR THREE REASONS.
FIRST OF ALL, IT WASN'T ADDICTION TO NICOTINE THAT
PREVENTED HIM FROM QUITTING. HE DIDN'T QUIT BECAUSE HE
DIDN'T TRY TO QUIT.
SECOND, THE HEART ATTACK WASN'T EVEN CAUSED BY
SMOKING.
AND THIRD, IF HE HAD QUIT IN '85, HE WOULD HAVE HAD
NO SMOKING RELATED RISK AT ALL FOR THE HEART ATTACK. IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN GONE.
AND, LIKEWISE, ON QUESTION B -- I'M SORRY, BACK ON
3(B) PLEASE. LIKEWISE, ON HIS ORAL CAVITY CANCER, THE
EVIDENCE WAS IF MR. HARRIS WOULD HAVE QUIT SMOKING IN 1985,
HE WOULD HAVE HAD THE SAME RISK AS A NEVER-SMOKER OR A SECOND
HEAD AND NECK CANCER BY 1997.
AND IF YOU ANSWER "NO" TO QUESTIONS 3(A) AND 3(B),
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 122
THE CASE IS OVER BECAUSE MR. HARRIS WAS NOT AN ENGLE CLASS
MEMBER.
THE COURT: MR. COFER, YOU ASKED ME TO REMIND YOU.
IT'S ONE HOUR.
MR. COFER: SO LET ME KIND OF MOVE ON THROUGH THE
REST OF THE QUESTIONS.
QUESTION 4, FOR ALL OF THE REASONS I'VE TOLD YOU
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS "NO".
LET'S GO TO QUESTION 5, AND THIS IS COMPARATIVE
FAULT. "IF YOU DECIDE THAT MR. HARRIS AND THE DEFENDANTS ARE
ALL RESPONSIBLE FOR CAUSING MR. HARRIS' INJURIES," THIS IS
WHERE YOU CAN DECIDE HOW MUCH EACH PARTY IS RESPONSIBLE. LET
ME TELL YOU SOMETHING SO THERE IS NO CONFUSION. YOU NEVER
GET HERE UNLESS YOU'RE PERSUADED THAT THE PLAINTIFF PROVED
THAT MR. HARRIS WAS A CLASS MEMBER. AND I BELIEVE THE
EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING THAT THEY DID NOT DO THAT. BUT IF
YOU DO GET THIS FAR, HERE'S WHERE YOU CAN DECIDE HOW MUCH
PLAINTIFF AND HOW MUCH ANY THREE DEFENDANTS -- LET ME TALK
ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND.
PLAINTIFF ADMITS THAT HER HUSBAND WAS AT LEAST
PARTIALLY AT FAULT FOR CAUSING HIS OWN INJURIES. REMEMBER
THAT? MS. LONDON TOLD YOU THAT. SO I WANT YOU TO THINK
ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS. IT CAN ONLY MEAN THAT PLAINTIFF
ADMITS THAT MR. HARRIS KNEW HIS SMOKING WAS HARMING HIM, AND
HAD THE ABILITY TO QUIT SMOKING BEFORE IT HARMED HIM OR HE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
123 COULDN'T HAVE ANY FAULT. HOW COULD HE POSSIBLY BE AT FAULT
IF HE DIDN'T KNOW AND HE COULDN'T QUIT? THE FACT THAT THEY
ADMIT THAT HE KNEW AND HE COULD HAVE QUIT IS INCREDIBLY
IMPORTANT IN THIS CASE. AND REMEMBER IT'S UNDISPUTED THAT BY
1985 HE KNEW HIS SMOKING CAUSED, OR HE BELIEVED HIS SMOKING
CAUSED HIS VOCAL CORD CANCER AND HE DIDN'T TRY TO QUIT.
AND I'LL TELL YOU MEMBERS OF THE JURY, IF YOU GET
THIS FAR, YOU SHOULD TAKE PLAINTIFF AT THEIR WORD. IF HE
KNEW HE CAUSED IT AND HE HAD THE ABILITY TO QUIT, YOU SHOULD
MARK 100 PERCENT RESPONSIBILITY FOR MR. HARRIS BECAUSE ONLY
MR. HARRIS --
MS. LONDON: OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.
THE COURT: OVERRULED. YOU MAY CONTINUE.
MR. COFER: BECAUSE ONLY MR. HARRIS WAS IN A
POSITION TO DECIDE WHETHER TO TRY TO QUIT OR NOT. THAT'S
NOTHING ANYONE ELSE COULD DO FOR HIM. IF HE KNEW IT AND HE
HAD THE ABILITY TO QUIT AND HE DIDN'T TRY, THEN YOU SHOULD
MARK 100 PERCENT.
LET'S GO TO QUESTION SIX. "WE THE JURY FIND THAT
THE PLAINTIFF HAS PROVED IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT SMOKING
MANUFACTURED BY THE DEFENDANTS WAS THE LEGAL CAUSE OF LUNG
CANCER AND DEATH." THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IS "NO". AND
I WON'T GO THROUGH IT AGAIN, BUT DR. BURNS TOLD YOU THAT HAD
HE QUIT SMOKING IN '66 OR 1970, OR 1974, OR 1985, HIS RISK OF
DEVELOPING A SMOKING RELATED DISEASE AND LUNG CANCER WOULD
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
124 HAVE BEEN BASICALLY THE SAME AS SOMEONE WHO NEVER SMOKED.
LET'S GO TO QUESTION 7. AGAIN, THIS COMPARATIVE
FAULT, FOR THE VERY SAME REASONS I MENTIONED IN QUESTION 5,
IF YOU GET THIS FAR, YOU SHOULD SIDE 100 PERCENT TO
MR. HARRIS.
LET'S GO TO QUESTION 8. "WE THE JURY FIND
PLAINTIFF HAS PROVED IT'S MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THE FOLLOWING
DEFENDANTS ARE LIABLE FOR FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT AND THAT WAS
A LEGAL CAUSE." SO, MEMBERS OF THE JURY, IN ORDER FOR A
CONCEALMENT OR AN OMISSION TO BE A LEGAL CAUSE, MR. HARRIS --
BLESS YOU -- PLAINTIFF HAS TO SHOW THAT HE REASONABLY RELIED
ON SOMETHING THAT HE DID OR DIDN'T DO. MS. LONDON SAID THIS
CASE WAS ABOUT WHAT WAS NOT KNOWN, AND WOULD IT HAVE MADE A
DIFFERENCE TO MR. HARRIS? WELL, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT
ANYTHING WOULD HAVE BECAUSE MRS. HARRIS SAID HER HUSBAND
NEVER TOLD HER HE WISHED A TOBACCO COMPANY WOULD HAVE GIVEN
HIM MORE INFORMATION, OR IF THE TOBACCO COMPANY WOULD HAVE
SAID SOMETHING SOONER IT WOULD HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE.
MRS. HARRIS ADMITTED HER HUSBAND NEVER TALKED ABOUT FILTERS
OR LIGHT CIGARETTES. HE NEVER TOLD HER WHY HE SMOKED THEM.
HE NEVER SAID HE THOUGHT FILTERS OR LOW TAR WERE SAFER.
AND FINALLY, WE KNOW THAT BY 1985 HE PERSONALLY
UNDERSTOOD AND BELIEVED HIS SMOKING WAS HARMING HIM, BUT HE
DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO QUIT. SO WHY WOULD YOU POSSIBLY THINK
THAT ANYTHING WE COULD HAVE SAID EARLIER WOULD HAVE MADE A
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 125
DIFFERENCE? IF GOING TO THE DOCTOR BEING DIAGNOSED WITH
CANCER, BEING CURED OF CANCER, UNDERSTANDING AND BELIEVING
IT'S CAUSED BY SMOKING DOESN'T EVEN GET TO YOU TRY TO QUIT,
WHAT IN THE WORLD COULD? PLAINTIFF HAS FAILED IN THEIR
EVIDENCE ON THIS, AND I RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST THE ANSWER
SHOULD BE "NO".
THESE NEXT QUESTIONS 9 THROUGH 15, AS MS. LONDON
SAID, ESSENTIALLY, THEY ARE REPETITIVE QUESTIONS OF EARLIER.
SO FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT YOU ANSWERED "NO" TO QUESTION 8,
YOU SHOULD, LIKEWISE, ANSWER "NO" TO QUESTIONS 9 THROUGH 15.
SO THAT TAKES US TO QUESTION 16. AND BACK ON 15,
THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU DON'T CHECK ANYTHING HERE BECAUSE HE
DIDN'T RELY ON ANYTHING BEFORE OR AFTER. LET'S GO TO 16.
SO THIS IS DAMAGES. YOU KNOW MS. LONDON SUGGESTED
THAT YOU AWARD $22.4 MILLION FOR THE DECISIONS THAT
MR. HARRIS MADE AND THE DECISIONS HE DIDN'T MAKE. YOU KNOW
ALL I'M GOING TO TELL YOU IS, I CAN'T HELP YOU WITH THIS.
YOU LISTENED TO THE EVIDENCE. YOU'RE THE ONES IN THE BEST
POSITION TO DECIDE WHETHER MR. HARRIS AND MRS. HARRIS ARE
ENTITLED TO RECOVER ANYTHING. I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEY CAME
UP WITH $22.4 MILLION, BUT IF YOU DO GET THIS FAR YOU SHOULD
AWARD SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK IS FAIR AND SOMETHING THAT YOU
THINK IS REASONABLE.
QUESTION 7 (SIC).
THE COURT: 17, BUT GO AHEAD.
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
126 MR. COFER: THANK YOU. THIS IS FOR INJURIES THAT
DID NOT CAUSE HIS DEATH. THE EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING THAT
SMOKING DIDN'T CAUSE HIS HEART DISEASE OR STROKE AND I
RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST THAT YOU NOT EVEN CONSIDER THOSE, BUT
AGAIN WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER DISEASES AWARD WHAT YOU THINK
IS FAIR IF YOU GET THIS FAR.
OKAY. JUST ABOUT DONE. I WANT TO TALK BRIEFLY
ABOUT PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE FINAL QUESTION, THIS IS
QUESTION 18, ASKS WHETHER YOU FIND BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING
EVIDENCE THAT PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARE WARRANTED AGAINST ONE OR
MORE OF THE DEFENDANTS IN THIS CASE. SO LET ME TALK FOR A
MINUTE ABOUT PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND WHAT YOU'RE BEING ASKED TO
DECIDE.
YOU'RE NOT BEING ASKED TO DECIDE AN AMOUNT OF
PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE ISSUE IS WHETHER BY CLEAR AND
CONVINCING EVIDENCE PLAINTIFF HAS SHOWN SHE IS ENTITLED TO
PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN THIS CASE. SO DON'T SPEND ONE MINUTE
THINKING ABOUT AMOUNT. THE QUESTION NOW IS WHETHER SHE'S
ENTITLED. AND IF YOU DECIDE SHE IS, THERE WILL BE ANOTHER
PHASE TO THE TRIAL, AND PLAINTIFF WILL PUT ON EVIDENCE, WE'LL
PUT ON EVIDENCE, WE'LL HAVE CLOSING ARGUMENTS AND YOU CAN
DECIDE THEN WHETHER AN AMOUNT IS APPROPRIATE.
SO THE ISSUE RIGHT NOW IS WHETHER THEY'VE PROVEN IT
BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE. IT'S A MUCH HIGHER
STANDARD. YOU HEARD MS. LONDON TALK ABOUT PREPONDERANCE OF
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
127 EVIDENCE, MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, THE JUDGE INSTRUCTED YOU
ON CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE. IT'S A MUCH, MUCH HIGHER
STANDARD OF PROOF. IT'S ONE WHERE THE EVIDENCE MUST BE
PRECISE, EXPLICIT, LACKING IN CONFUSION AND OF SUCH WEIGHT
THAT IT PRODUCES A FIRM BELIEF OR CONVICTION WITHOUT
HESITATION ABOUT THE MATTER AT ISSUE. IT'S A MUCH HIGHER
STANDARD. BUT WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT YOU HAVE TO DECIDE BASED
ON CONDUCT THAT HARMED JERRY HARRIS. THIS IS JERRY HARRIS'
CASE NOW. IT'S NOT A CLASS ACTION ANY MORE. OTHER PEOPLE
CAN FILE THEIR OWN LAWSUITS AND ASK FOR DAMAGES. SO IF YOU
GET THIS FAR, YOU CAN ONLY AWARD DAMAGES, PUNITIVE DAMAGES
FOR CONDUCT THAT HARMED MR. HARRIS.
MS. LONDON: OBJECTION.
MR. COFER: YOU CAN ONLY AWARD DAMAGES --
THE COURT: THIS IS ARGUMENT. YOU CAN READ THE
INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOURSELF AND DECIDE.
MR. COFER: YOU CAN ONLY AWARD DAMAGES FOR HARM TO
MR. HARRIS.
SO WHAT DID WE DO? IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE, ANYTHING
THAT THE DEFENDANTS DID THAT CAUSED HIM TO SMOKE OR CAUSED
HIM TO CONTINUE TO SMOKE? AND I'VE TOLD YOU THAT AND I THINK
THE ANSWER IS, NO, THERE ISN'T. WE SOLD CIGARETTES. THAT
ALONE CANNOT BE A BASIS FOR LIABILITY. THE ENGLE FINDINGS
ALONE ARE NOT A BASIS. THE EVIDENCE WAS MR. HARRIS ALWAYS
HAD THE INFORMATION HE NEEDED TO QUIT HAD HE WANTED TO QUIT
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
128 AND HE HAD THE ABILITY TO QUIT.
LET ME JUST SAY ONE MORE THING BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO TAKE TOO MUCH OF THE OTHERS TIME.
MR. TEPIKIAN: TEN MINUTES.
MR. COFER: TEN MINUTES. SO WE HAVE 35 MINUTES
LEFT. HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE LEFT, YOUR HONOR?
THE COURT: I'M GOING TO HAVE YOU UP TO 12:04
COMBINED. SO YOU'VE GOT ABOUT 37, 38 MINUTES LEFT.
MR. COFER: OKAY. LET ME SAY ONE MORE THING ABOUT
PUNITIVE DAMAGES. EVER SINCE 1966 THERE'S BEEN WARNINGS ON
CIGARETTE PACKS. WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MR. HARRIS'
SMOKING UNTIL 1972 WHEN HE MET MRS. HARRIS. IN 1972 HE WAS
32 YEARS OLD. WARNINGS HAD BEEN ON THE PACK FOR SIX YEARS.
WARNINGS -- I MEAN ADVERTISEMENTS WERE OFF TELEVISION FOR THE
LAST 11 YEARS -- OR 12 YEARS, RATHER. WARNINGS WERE ON EVERY
PRINT AD SINCE 19 -- WELL, WENT ON PRINT AD THAT SAME YEAR.
SO BOTTOM LINE IS THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT
ANYTHING THESE DEFENDANTS DID CAUSED MR. HARRIS TO SMOKE. WE
DON'T KNOW WHAT BRANDS HE SMOKED, IF HE SMOKED THEM WHEN HE
WAS A KID, AND YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THAT TOO IN THINKING ABOUT
ANY CONDUCT THAT MAY HAVE HARMED MR. HARRIS.
ALL RIGHT. LAST THING I WANT TO SAY, MEMBERS OF
THE JURY, THIS IS A CASE ABOUT ONE SMOKER AND WHETHER HE WAS
A MEMBER OF THE ENGLE CLASS, AND WHETHER HIS WIFE IS ENTITLED
TO RECOVER MONEY FOR HIS DECISIONS TO BEGIN AND TO CONTINUE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
129 SMOKING. IT'S A CASE ABOUT JERRY HARRIS, AND WHY HE SMOKED
AND WHY HE WAITED SO LONG TO QUIT. THE EVIDENCE WAS THAT
MR. HARRIS SMOKED BECAUSE HE LIKED TO SMOKED AND THAT ALL OF
HIS FRIENDS AND FAMILY SMOKED.
THE EVIDENCE WAS THAT MR. HARRIS HAD THE
INFORMATION HE NEEDED TO MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE WHETHER TO
SMOKE OR QUIT SMOKING.
THE EVIDENCE WAS THAT MR. HARRIS HAD THE TOOLS AND
EXPERIENCE HE NEEDED TO QUIT SMOKING WHEN HE WANTED TO QUIT.
AND FINALLY, THE EVIDENCE WAS THAT MR. HARRIS DID
NOT MEET THE BURDEN OF PROVING THAT MR. HARRIS WAS A MEMBER
OF THE ENGLE CLASS.
BUT LET ME CLEAR UP ONE THING, I HOPE THAT NOTHING
THAT ANY OF US DID, OR ANYTHING THAT I DID IN THIS TRIAL
SUGGESTED TO YOU IN ANY WAY THAT THE DEFENDANTS ARE BLAMING
MRS. HARRIS FOR HER HUSBAND'S DECISIONS. WE ARE NOT. WE ARE
NOT BLAMING MRS. HARRIS AT ALL. THE ISSUES IN THIS CASE ARE
WHY HE SMOKED, WHY HE DIDN'T QUIT AND WHETHER HE WAS A MEMBER
OF THE ENGLE CLASS. AND AS LAWYERS AND AS OFFICERS OF THE
COURT, WE HAVE AN ETHICAL OBLIGATION TO BRING YOU THE
EVIDENCE AND THE FACTS YOU NEED TO GET IT RIGHT. AND WE TRY
TO DO THAT RESPECTFULLY. WE TRY TO DO THAT IN A CONSIDERATE
WAY. WE HAD AN OBLIGATION TO DO THAT. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE
IT CLEAR WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO.
YOU KNOW, I TOLD YOU DURING VOIR DIRE THAT WE HAVE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
130 GREATEST SYSTEM OF CIVIL JUSTICE ANY NATION HAS EVER HAD.
IT'S NOT PERFECT. WE READ ABOUT MISTAKES. IT'S NOT PERFECT.
WE ARE THE ENVY OF EVERY OTHER NATION IN THE WORLD, AND THE
REASON WHY IS BECAUSE WE HAVE WOMEN LIKE YOU WHO ARE WILLING
TO TAKE TIME OUT OF YOUR LIVES AND COME SIT IN THAT JURY BOX
AND FOLLOW THE LAW AND DECIDE THE CASE BASED ON THE EVIDENCE.
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANTS, AND I THINK PLAINTIFF TOO, AND
EVERYONE IN THIS COURTROOM, I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY, VERY
MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE, AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING
TO MY CLOSING ARGUMENT.
THAT'S ALL I HAVE, YOUR HONOR.


MR. BIELBY: THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. GOOD MORNING.
MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT. WE HAVE NOW BEEN TOGETHER FOR
ALMOST A WEEK-AND-A-HALF AND WE ARE AT THE END OF THE CASE
AND RIGHT UP FRONT. LET ME SAY THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO
EVIDENCE THAT MR. HARRIS CHOSE ANY OF THE BRANDS THAT HE
SMOKED BECAUSE OF ANYTHING ANY TOBACCO COMPANY SAID, OR DID
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
131 OR DIDN'T DO. NONE AT ALL. PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL HAS GIVEN
YOU NO EVIDENCE THAT LORILLARD TOBACCO COMPANY SAID OR DID
ANYTHING THAT AFFECTED ANY OF THE CHOICES THAT GERALD HARRIS
MADE ABOUT HIS SMOKING. IN FACT, WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS JUST
THE OPPOSITE.
MRS. HARRIS TOLD US THAT SHE NEVER DISCUSSED WITH
HER HUSBAND WHY HE STARTED TO SMOKE, WHY HE CONTINUED TO
SMOKE, NOR WHY HE SMOKED ANY OF THE BRANDS OF CIGARETTES THAT
HE DID SMOKE.
I NEED TO REINTRODUCE MYSELF BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A
WEEK-AND-A-HALF. I'M LO BIELBY. I REPRESENT LORILLARD
TOBACCO COMPANY. I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT BY NOW, BUT I LIKE
TO SAY THAT UP FRONT AND THANK YOU FOR THE WEEK-AND-A-HALF
THAT YOU'VE BEEN TOGETHER AND BEEN WITH US.
I'M GOING TO TRY AND BE VERY, VERY BRIEF.
MR. COFER DID A VERY NICE JOB OF GOING THROUGH THE EVIDENCE
AND TALKING ABOUT THE VERDICT FORM. I'M GOING TO TRY VERY,
VERY HARD NOT REPEAT THAT. AS YOU RECALL, AT THE BEGINNING
OF THE CASE I SAID I WAS GOING TO BE VERY BRIEF, AND I WILL
TRY TO DO THAT AND RESPECT YOU AND YOUR TIME.
I WOULD LIKE TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THE EVIDENCE,
THOUGH. IT'S GOING TO BE AS SHORT AS I CAN POSSIBLY MAKE IT
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE EVIDENCE THAT MIGHT APPLY
AS TO LORILLARD.
MRS. HARRIS TOLD US GERALD HARRIS SMOKED SEVERAL
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
132 BRANDS, AND AS YOU HEARD, MR. COFER REMINDED US, THE
TESTIMONY WAS THAT HE SWITCHED BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN BRANDS
AND DID NOT SMOKE ANY OF THE BRANDS IN A PARTICULAR ORDER.
IF YOU RECALL MRS. HARRIS SAID THAT SHE NEVER
DISCUSSED HEARING, SEEING OR READING ANYTHING FROM LORILLARD
OR FROM ANY TOBACCO COMPANY. MR. HARRIS DID NOT RELY UPON
ADVERTISEMENTS. YOU RECALL HE MADE UP HIS OWN MIND. AND
FINALLY, YOU HEARD THAT SHE HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF MR. HARRIS
CHOOSING ANY BRAND BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WAS SAFER OR LESS
HAZARDOUS.
MR. HARRIS LIVED A LIFE FILLED WITH BOATS TO SEA
FISHING, AND JUST LIKE EVERY AMERICAN EVERY DAY, HE HAD THE
FREEDOM TO DECIDE WHAT HE WOULD CHOOSE TO DO THAT DAY, EVERY
DAY. MR. HARRIS MADE THOSE DECISIONS AS A LIFE-LONG BOAT
CAPTAIN. HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR PEOPLE, FOR PASSENGERS, FOR
THEIR SAFETY, FOR THEIR LIVES AND HE MADE VITAL DECISIONS
EVERY DAY. OF COURSE, HE WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
CONSEQUENCES OF HIS OWN DECISIONS JUST AS ALL OF US ARE.
MRS. HARRIS ADMITTED THAT HER HUSBAND NEVER SAID HE
WANTED TO QUIT SMOKING, AND SHE TOLD US SHE DIDN'T KNOW IF HE
EVER TRULY WANTED TO QUIT.
SO AFTER THIS WEEK-AND-A-HALF OF TRIAL, HERE'S WHAT
WE DO KNOW BASED UPON THE EVIDENCE FROM THIS COURTROOM. IT
ALL CAME FROM MRS. HARRIS, THE PERSON WHO KNEW HIM BEST. WE
KNOW THAT MR. HARRIS SMOKED AT LEAST FOUR BRANDS BETWEEN THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
133 TIME PERIOD OF 1972 UNTIL HE QUIT IN 1999. WE KNOW THAT
MR. HARRIS SWITCHED BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THOSE BRANDS,
BETWEEN LIGHTS AND NON-LIGHTS WITHOUT A PREFERENCE FOR ANY
PARTICULAR BRAND.
WE DON'T KNOW THE REASONS HE CHOSE TO SWITCH, BUT
WE DO KNOW THAT THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN HOW HE SMOKED ANY
PARTICULAR BRAND, A LIGHT OR A NON-LIGHT.
MR. HARRIS SMOKED THE SAME NUMBER OF CIGARETTES
EVERY DAY AND HE SMOKED THEM THE SAME WAY REGARDLESS OF THE
BRAND THAT HE WAS SMOKING. THIS IS NOT -- PARDON ME, I
JUMPED DOWN HERE.
MRS. HARRIS TOLD US THAT ONLY ONE LORILLARD BRAND
OF CIGARETTES WAS SMOKED BY HER HUSBAND, KENT III. THIS IS
WHY YOU'VE NOT HEARD FROM ME MUCH DURING THIS TRIAL.
WE KNOW THAT KENT III WAS FIRST SOLD IN 1979, THAT
IS STIPULATED BETWEEN THE PARTIES. IT IS UNDISPUTED. IN
1979 MR. HARRIS WAS AN ADULT. HE WAS AROUND 40 YEARS OLD.
HE WAS MARRIED, AND HE WAS THE FATHER OF TWO CHILDREN. SO WE
KNOW THAT MR. HARRIS' FIRST LORILLARD CIGARETTE COULD NOT
HAVE BEEN EARLIER THAN 1979.
WE DO KNOW THAT EVERY SINGLE LORILLARD CIGARETTE
THAT MR. HARRIS SMOKED HAD THE SURGEON GENERAL'S MANDATORY
HEALTH WARNING ON THE SIDE OF THE CIGARETTE PACKAGES.
MR. COFER WENT THROUGH THAT WITH YOU AND SHOWED THE WARNINGS
ON THE SIDE OF THE PACKAGES. IN FACT, EVERY BRAND OF
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
134 CIGARETTES THAT MR. HARRIS SMOKED AFTER 1966 HAD THE SURGEON
GENERAL'S MANDATORY HEALTH WARNING ON THE SIDES OF THE
PACKAGE OF CIGARETTES.
NOW, WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHEN HE SMOKED THE
LORILLARD BRAND AFTER 1979. WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY HE
SMOKED, HOW LONG HE SMOKED IT, BUT WE DO KNOW THAT HE NEVER
TALKED ABOUT -- TALKED TO ANYONE ABOUT LIGHT CIGARETTES.
AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE, THAT MR.
HARRIS EVER RELIED ON ANY STATEMENT OR ADVERTISEMENT BY
LORILLARD OR ANY OTHER TOBACCO COMPANY OR ABOUT THOSE
STATEMENTS OR ADVERTISEMENTS HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIS
DECISIONS ABOUT SMOKING ANY CIGARETTE, INCLUDING A LIGHT
CIGARETTE.
I DO WANT TO TALK A BIT ABOUT DURING THE TRIAL
PLAINTIFF SHOWED YOU A VIDEO DEPOSITION OF MS. CHRISTIE LEON.
SHE IS THE LORILLARD MARKETING PERSON. YOU SAW THE VIDEO ON
THE BIG SCREEN. SHE'S NOT AN ACTRESS, BUT IT WAS A LARGE
SCREEN IN FRONT OF US. MRS. HARRIS WAS ADAMANT THAT
MR. HARRIS WAS NOT INFLUENCED BY ADVERTISEMENTS AT ALL, BUT
WHAT'S IMPORTANT MRS. LEON SAID TO US IN HER VIDEO DEPOSITION
THAT THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION IS CHARGED WITH MAKING SURE
THE INFORMATION IS FACTUALLY ACCURATE. THE GOVERNMENT
ENTITY, THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION.
THE FTC'S GUIDELINES WENT INTO PLACE IN 1955 AND
LORILLARD HAS PRE-CLEARED -- ALL THE TOBACCO COMPANIES WE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
135 PRE-CLEARED THE ADS WITH THE FTC AND WE FAITHFULLY COMPLIED
WITH THOSE GUIDELINES. YOU SAW DURING THE TRIAL ONE KENT III
ADVERTISEMENT THAT PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL PUT ON THE SCREEN.
SHE SHOWED IT DURING THE TRIAL. THAT AD WAS FIRST REVIEWED
AND APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BEFORE IT WAS USED AND
PUBLISHED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
WHY IS ALL OF THIS IMPORTANT? BECAUSE THIS CASE IS
ABOUT GERALD HARRIS. IT IS NOT ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE, IN OTHER
STATES, AT OTHER TIMES OR OTHER CASES. THIS CASE IS ABOUT
MR. HARRIS. IT'S NOT ABOUT STATISTICS. IT'S NOT ABOUT AGE
COHORTS THAT DR. BURNS TALKED ABOUT, AND THE THEORIES THAT WE
HEARD IN THIS COURTROOM ABOUT LIGHT CIGARETTES FROM
PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL IS JUST NOT APPLICABLE TO MR. GERALD
HARRIS. THAT'S WHAT THIS CASE COMES DOWN TO.
BEFORE THIS AFTERNOON YOU HAVE NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO
TALK ABOUT THIS CASE AMONGST YOURSELVES, BUT IN A FEW MINUTES
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TALK AMONGST YOURSELVES AND DISCUSS THE
CASE BECAUSE YOU ARE THE DECISION MAKERS.
THE ENGLE CASE THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT, THE CASE THAT
RESULTED IN THOSE FINDINGS THAT PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL POSTED IN
FRONT OF YOU, THAT ENGLE JURY DID NOT HEAR ABOUT MR. HARRIS,
BUT YOU HAVE. IN A FEW MOMENTS JUDGE SARGUS WILL INSTRUCT
YOU THAT THOSE FINDINGS DO NOT ESTABLISH THE DEFENDANTS ARE
LIABLE TO PLAINTIFF IN ANY WAY. YOU MAKE THE DECISIONS AS TO
MR. HARRIS.
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
136 NOW, THE VERDICT FORM YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD,
CONTAINS A LOT OF QUESTIONS. THAT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT
OF THINGS THAT PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL MUST PROVE IN ORDER FOR
YOU TO FIND IN FAVOR OF PLAINTIFF IN THIS CASE.
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE VERDICT FORM AND THINKING
THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO COME INTO THE COURTROOM AND JUST SAY,
"WELL, MR. HARRIS SMOKED CIGARETTES FOR 45 YEARS, TO SAY,
WELL, THE TOBACCO COMPANIES SAID SOME DUMB THINGS, AND WELL,
LORILLARD MADE SOME OF THOSE CIGARETTES, THEREFORE, LORILLARD
MUST PAY SOME MONEY." THAT'S NOT THE WAY OUR SYSTEM WORKS.
THAT'S NOT THE LAW. PLAINTIFF MUST PROVE THE LEGAL CAUSE OF
HARM TO MR. HARRIS BEFORE YOU CAN THINK ABOUT AWARDING
DAMAGES. MR. COFER WENT THROUGH THE LEGAL CAUSE AND
DISTINCTIONS IN THAT REGARD. HE DID A NICE JOB. I WILL NOT
GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN, BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS TO BE
PREVIEWED BEFORE THINKING ABOUT AWARDING DAMAGES.
PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL HAS THE BURDEN OF PROVING ALL
THE ELEMENTS OF ALL OF THEIR CLAIMS. AS MR. COFER EXPLAINED,
THE PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL HAS TO PROVE, WITH EVIDENCE, A DIRECT
CONNECTION BETWEEN SOMETHING A DEFENDANT DID, AN INJURY TO
MR. HARRIS, AND THE PLAINTIFF MUST PROVE HER CASE AGAINST
EACH DEFENDANT, EACH ONE. I MENTIONED THAT IN OPENING
STATEMENT AND I MENTION IT AGAIN NOW. THAT'S WHY THERE'S A
SEPARATE LINE FOR EACH OF THE TOBACCO COMPANIES.
I DO WANT TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
137 QUESTIONS ON THE VERDICT FORM. I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH
EACH ONE, AND I DON'T HAVE ANY SLIDES, BUT SOME OF THE THINGS
I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT I'M GOING TO SHORTEN BECAUSE OF THE
LIMITED TIME IN FRONT OF YOU.
I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT COMPARATIVE FAULT. THAT
WOULD BE QUESTIONS 5 AND 7. IF YOU READ THOSE QUESTIONS, YOU
WILL BE ASKED TO COMPARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MR. HARRIS AND
THE DEFENDANTS. MR. COFER WENT THROUGH THIS. AND WE KNOW
FROM MS. LONDON'S OPENING THAT MR. HARRIS WAS AT LEAST TEN
PERCENT RESPONSIBLE. THAT IS WHAT SHE SAID IN THE OPENING
STATEMENT. THEY ADMIT THAT. SO THAT AMOUNT CANNOT BE ZERO
FOR MR. HARRIS --
MS. LONDON: OBJECTION.
THE COURT: I BELIEVE I THINK YOU SAID MRS. HARRIS.
MR. HARRIS. WITH THAT, THE OBJECTION IS OVERRULED OTHERWISE.
MR. BIELBY: I APOLOGIZE IF I MISSPOKE.
MS. LONDON: YOUR HONOR, MAY WE APPROACH?
THE COURT: NO. YOU MAY CONTINUE.
MR. BIELBY: YOU WILL DECIDE THE COMPARATIVE FAULT
BASED UPON THE EVIDENCE, BUT MY POINT THIS MORNING IS IT'S
CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND THAT APPORTIONMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY
DOES NOT APPLY TO THE CONCEALMENT QUESTIONS OF QUESTIONS 8,
10, 12 AND 14. THAT'S THE LAW AND THE JUDGE WILL GIVE YOU
THAT INSTRUCTION. SO IF YOU ANSWER "YES" ON QUESTIONS 8, 10,
12 AND 14, THEN YOUR DECISION IS ON APPORTIONMENT, WHAT
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
138 PERCENTAGE OF RESPONSIBILITY, ON QUESTIONS 5 AND 7 OF
COMPARATIVE FAULT, WON'T COUNT FOR ANYTHING. EVEN IF YOU
DECIDE 90 PERCENT RESPONSIBILITY ON MR. HARRIS AND ONLY
10 PERCENT ON THE DEFENDANTS, IF YOU ANSWER "YES" TO ONE OR
MORE OF THOSE FOUR QUESTIONS, THEN THE DEFENDANTS WOULD BE
HELD TO 100 PERCENT RESPONSIBILITY REGARDLESS OF THE
PERCENTAGE OF FAULT YOU INTENDED FOR MR. HARRIS TO SHARE.
WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT? WELL, THAT PERCENTAGE OF
RESPONSIBILITY WILL THEN NOT REDUCE ANY OF THE DAMAGES THAT
YOU AWARD IN THIS CASE. MR. HARRIS' PERCENTAGE OF
RESPONSIBILITY WOULD THEN EFFECTIVELY BE ZERO, WHICH EVEN THE
PLAINTIFF HAS SUGGESTED IS NOT CORRECT BECAUSE THEY ADMIT
10 PERCENT RESPONSIBILITY. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT
YOU GO THROUGH EACH OF THOSE QUESTIONS CAREFULLY, AND I KNOW
THAT YOU WILL AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT.
BY NOW YOU'RE PROBABLY BEGINNING TO SEE WHY
PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL SPENT SO MUCH TIME ON EXPERT WITNESSES
AND ON CLAIMS ABOUT INTERNAL DOCUMENTS AND STATEMENTS MADE BY
SOME OF THE TOBACCO COMPANIES, ALL OF WHICH REALLY HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH MR. HARRIS. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE HE EVER
SAW OR HEARD ANY OF THOSE DOCUMENTS OR READ THEM. AND HE
CERTAINLY NEVER RELIED ON ANY OF THOSE DOCUMENTS OR
STATEMENTS. HE NEVER RELIED UPON ANY ADVERTISEMENTS. MR.
COFER WENT THROUGH ALL OF THAT. I WILL NOT GO THROUGH IT
AGAIN.
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
139 I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE VERY LAST QUESTION ON
THE VERDICT FORM AND THAT IS THE PUNITIVE DAMAGES QUESTION.
MR. COFER WENT THROUGH THAT, AND I AGREE THAT THE FACTS OF
THIS CASE, THE CLASS MEMBERSHIP QUESTIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF
THE VERDICT FORM AND WHAT WE KNOW AND DON'T KNOW ABOUT
MR. HARRIS' SMOKING DECISIONS, RESPECTFULLY, YOU SHOULD NOT
REACH THE LAST QUESTION, BUT IF YOU DO, I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK
WITH YOU ABOUT IT FOR A MOMENT. I WOULDN'T BE DOING MY JOB
UNLESS I GOT TO THAT LAST QUESTION ABOUT PUNITIVE DAMAGES.
AS MR. COFER EXPLAINED, YOU WILL NOT BE DECIDING
THE AMOUNT OF THE PUNITIVE DAMAGES AT THIS POINT. THE AMOUNT
WILL BE DECIDED IN A SECOND PHASE OF THIS TRIAL THAT WE WOULD
COME BACK AND START AFTER YOU RETURN YOUR VERDICT HERE.
THAT'S CALLED THE PHASE TWO PART OF THE TRIAL, IF THERE IS
ONE.
YOUR DECISION TODAY, IF YOU REACH, THOUGH, THAT
LAST QUESTION, QUESTION 18, IS ONLY WHETHER OR NOT THE
PLAINTIFF HAS SHOWN BY THAT HIGHER BURDEN BY CLEAR AND
CONVINCING EVIDENCE WHETHER THIS CASE IS A CASE WHERE
PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARE TRULY WARRANTED TO PUNISH THE
DEFENDANTS.
I ALSO NOTE THAT ANY MONEY AWARDED TO MRS. HARRIS
FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WOULD BE ON TOP OF COMPENSATORY DAMAGES
THAT YOU MAY DECIDE TO AWARD. AND THE PUNITIVE DAMAGES DON'T
GO TO THE GOVERNMENT, DOESN'T GO TO A CHARITY, IT DOESN'T GO
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
140 TO A NONSMOKING ENTITY, IT WOULD GO TO MRS. HARRIS.
THE STANDARD, JUDGE SARGUS WILL READ TO YOU THE
STANDARD, WHEN I PARAPHRASE IT SAYING, "THAT EACH DEFENDANT
MUST ACT WITH CONSCIOUS INDIFFERENCE TO THE CONSEQUENCES AND
RECKLESS DISREGARD." I RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST TO YOU THAT YOU
HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER AS TO LORILLARD, OR FOR THAT
MATTER, ANY TOBACCO COMPANY THAT WOULD SHOW BY CLEAR AND
CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT ANY DEFENDANT ACTED WITH CONSCIOUS
INDIFFERENCE AND RECKLESS DISREGARD IN A MANNER THAT DIRECTLY
HARMED MR. HARRIS.
WHAT DID WE HEAR ABOUT LORILLARD REGARDING THE
PUNITIVE DAMAGES? YOU MAY RECALL THAT I ASKED THE VERY FIRST
PLAINTIFF WITNESS, DR. PROCTOR, SEVERAL QUESTIONS
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT LORILLARD TOBACCO COMPANY. HE HAD A LOT
OF GOOD THINGS TO SAY ABOUT LORILLARD'S NUMEROUS
CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE FIELD OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, INTO THE
HEALTH AFFECTS OF CIGARETTE SMOKING. AS YOU HEARD, LORILLARD
SUPPORTED AND WORKED WITH FAMOUS EARLY SCIENCE PIONEERS SUCH
AS DR. ERNST WYNDER, DR. DIETRICH HOFFMAN, AND THE SCIENTISTS
INVOLVED IN THOSE EARLY MOUSE SKIN STUDIES THAT YOU SAW
PICTURES OF PUBLISHED IN LIFE MAGAZINE IN THE 1950'S. THAT
RESEARCH WAS PUBLISHED IN NOT ONLY LIFE, BUT IN THE READER'S
DIGEST AND OTHER SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS AND TRADE PUBLICATIONS.
BOTH OF PLAINTIFF'S EXPERT WITNESSES, DR. PROCTOR AND
DR. BURNS TALKED ABOUT DR. WYNDER AND THEIR RESPECT FOR HIM
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
141 AS A GREAT SCIENTIST.
AS DR. PROCTOR TOLD YOU, LORILLARD WORKED CLOSELY
WITH DR. WYNDER AND SUPPORTED HIS RESEARCH, AND SUPPORTED THE
WORK OF THE SCIENTISTS SEEKING TO LEARN WHAT POTENTIAL
CARCINOGENS WERE IN CIGARETTE SMOKE. YOU HEARD THAT
LORILLARD PROVIDED THE CIGARETTES AND THE PRODUCTS FOR THAT
RESEARCH.
BUT LORILLARD'S HELP DIDN'T STOP THERE. THEY
COLLABORATED WITH DRS. WYNDER AND HOFFMAN AND OTHER
SCIENTISTS ON SMOKE FRACTIONATION RESEARCH TO LEARN WHAT WAS
IN THE CIGARETTE SMOKE, AND LORILLARD ASSISTED AND FUNDED
THAT RESEARCH, AND IT ENDED UP WITH LETTERS BACK AND FORTH TO
THE SLOAN-KETTERING CANCER INSTITUTE AND THE AMERICAN HEALTH
FOUNDATION AND THEY WORKED TOGETHER. THAT'S NOT RECKLESS
DISREGARD AND THAT IS JUST THE OPPOSITE.
AS THAT RESEARCH CONTINUED, LORILLARD WORKED WITH
DR. WYNDER ON HOW TO REDUCE SOMETHING CALLED PHENOLS,
P-H-E-N-O-L-S, IN CIGARETTE SMOKE. AND AT THAT TIME PHENOLS
WERE BELIEVED TO BE A SUSPECT AS A CAUSE OF CANCER.
LORILLARD SHARED ITS RESEARCH ON PHENOLS WITH THE SCIENTIFIC
COMMUNITY AND PUBLISHED THAT RESEARCH SO EVERYONE WOULD KNOW
WHAT IT FOUND. AND LORILLARD CAME UP WITH A FILTER THAT
REDUCED THE PHENOLS IN CIGARETTE SMOKE LEADING TO TWO PATENTS
BEING AWARDED TO LORILLARD BASED ON THAT RESEARCH.
AFTER THAT LORILLARD MADE TWO SUBMISSIONS TO THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
142 SURGEON GENERAL'S OFFICE AND DR. PROCTOR TOLD US THAT THOSE
SUBMISSIONS WENT TO THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE PRIOR TO THE
PUBLICATION OF THE 1964 SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT. THAT IS
NOT RECKLESS DISREGARD. AGAIN, THAT IS THE OPPOSITE.
THE COURT: COUNSEL, WE ARE RIGHT UP TO THE TIME
YOU ASKED ME TO REMIND YOU OF.
MR. BIELBY: THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
ONE MORE THING, DR. PROCTOR ACKNOWLEDGED THAT
LORILLARD DIDN'T PLACE ITS PRODUCTS IN MOTION PICTURES. HE
AGREED THAT IN FACT LORILLARD HAD A POLICY OF TELLING MOVIE
PRODUCES THAT LORILLARD WOULD NOT DO THAT, AND THAT POLICY
HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR 40 YEARS. THERE IS NO BASIS WHATSOEVER
TO FIND THAT PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND NO
BASIS AGAINST LORILLARD.
AGAIN, I THANK YOU. I HAVE EVERY FAITH AND
CONFIDENCE THAT EACH OF YOU WILL CAREFULLY REVIEW THE
EVIDENCE THAT CAME INTO THIS COURT, NOT EVIDENCE FROM OTHER
STATES, OR OTHER PEOPLE OR OTHER CASES. YOU WILL LISTEN AND
APPLY AND JUDGE, AND USE YOUR COMMON SENSE WHEN YOU REVIEW
THE EVIDENCE AND WHEN YOU EVALUATE THE WITNESSES. I'D LIKE
YOU TO APPLY YOUR COMMON SENSE TO THE QUESTIONS ON THE
VERDICT FORM. I KNOW YOU WILL. WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU WILL
ENTER A VERDICT FOR EACH DEFENDANT. AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR
TIME.

MS. BAKER: I WILL WORK FAST, YOUR HONOR.
MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT, MRS. HARRIS, COUNSEL AND
GOOD MORNING. I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH
YOU AGAIN. AS YOU KNOW, THE ONLY TIME WE CAN SPEAK WITH YOU,
THE LAWYERS CAN SPEAK WITH YOU ARE DURING OPENING STATEMENT
AND CLOSING ARGUMENT. AND ON BEHALF OF MY CLIENT
R.J. REYNOLDS AND MYSELF, I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR SERVICE
IN THIS CASE.
NOW, MR. COFER THOROUGHLY WALKED YOU THROUGH THE
EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE AND WHAT HE SAID APPLIES WITH EQUAL
FORCE TO R.J. REYNOLDS, BUT I HAVE A FEW ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS,
AND I HAVE A LOT TO SAY, BUT I'M GOING TO WORK QUICKLY. AS
YOU HEARD, I ONLY HAVE 18 MINUTES. SO I MAY TALK QUICKLY. I
MAY MOVE THROUGH THE ISSUES QUICKLY, BUT I WANT TO ADD THESE
THOUGHTS TO WHAT MR. COFER AND MR. BIELBY HAVE ALREADY TOLD
YOU.
NOW, I TOLD YOU AT THE OUTSET OF THIS CASE IT WAS
ABOUT ONE SMOKER, AND ONE ALONE, AND THAT'S MR. HARRIS. AND
YOU'LL SEE THAT -- YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN THAT REFLECTED ON THE
VERDICT FORM. THESE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT MR. HARRIS. NOT
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
144 ANOTHER SMOKER, NOT A CLASS OF SMOKERS, NOT SOME OTHER
GENERIC SMOKER. THEY ARE ABOUT MR. HARRIS. AND DESPITE THAT
YOU HEARD DAYS-AND-DAYS OF TESTIMONY THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH MR. HARRIS. AND MS. LONDON SPENT A GOOD BIT OF TIME
THIS MORNING DURING HER CLOSING ARGUMENT TALKING ABOUT THINGS
THAT DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH MR. HARRIS EITHER.
THEY DID THAT TO TRY TO REPROVE THOSE FINDINGS,
THOSE FINDINGS THAT JUDGE SARGUS ALREADY TOLD YOU ABOUT, AND
THAT YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT AGAIN IN HIS INSTRUCTIONS THIS
AFTERNOON. TO TRY TO REPROVE THOSE FINDINGS TO YOU. THOSE
FINDINGS AND THAT EVIDENCE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH
MR. HARRIS AND HIS SMOKING DECISIONS. BUT I WANT TO
ADDRESS -- I WANT TO JUST QUICKLY ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE
ISSUES THAT PLAINTIFF RAISED. I WANT TO ADDRESS THEM HEAD-ON
AND EXPLAIN WHY THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH MR.
HARRIS.
THE FIRST ISSUE IS HOW CIGARETTES ARE DESIGNED.
YOU HEARD OVER AND OVER AND YOU HEARD IT AGAIN THIS MORNING
THAT CIGARETTES ARE DESIGNED TO BE MORE ADDICTIVE.
SUGGESTIONS THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING DONE, ADDITIVES OR
SOMETHING DONE TO THE NICOTINE TO MAKE THEM MORE INHALABLE.
WHAT DID THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE ACTUALLY SHOW?
DRS. PROCTOR AND BURNS TOLD YOU THAT CIGARETTES ARE
DANGEROUS AND ADDICTIVE BY NATURE. THAT'S INHERENT. THERE
IS NO SAFE CIGARETTE. TOBACCO COMPANIES DON'T MAKE THEM
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
145 DANGEROUS AND ADDICTIVE. IF YOU ROLL UP A CIGARETTE, IF YOU
ROLL UP TOBACCO AND BURN IT, IT HAS THE SAME CARCINOGENS AS A
COMMERCIAL CIGARETTE. AND DR. PROCTOR ADMITTED THAT
CIGARETTES WERE INHALABLE LONG BEFORE THEY WERE MASS
PRODUCED.
NOW, THE SECOND ISSUE AND YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT
IT ALREADY THIS MORNING IS MARKETING TO UNDERAGED SMOKERS.
YOU HEARD REFERENCES IN THIS TRIAL TO YOUTH OVER AND OVER.
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN OR WHY MR. HARRIS BECAME A REGULAR SMOKER.
I THINK THAT'S CLEAR. BUT ONE THING WE DO KNOW, THERE IS
ZERO EVIDENCE, ZERO EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE THAT HE STARTED
SMOKING OR BECAME A REGULAR SMOKER BECAUSE OF ADVERTISING.
IN FACT, MRS. HARRIS WHEN SHE TOOK THE STAND SHE
TOLD YOU THE OPPOSITE. WHAT DID SHE TELL YOU? SHE TOLD YOU
THAT SHE COULD NOT RECALL MR. HARRIS EVER BUYING A BRAND OF
CIGARETTES BECAUSE OF AN AD. HE DIDN'T BUY THINGS BECAUSE OF
ADVERTISING. HE WAS NOT INFLUENCED BY ADS. THAT'S WHAT SHE
SAID. HE MADE UP HIS OWN MIND. THERE'S NO DISPUTE ABOUT
THAT. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU HEARD FROM MRS. HARRIS HERSELF.
NOW, WHEN I STOOD UP AND ASKED DR. PROCTOR
QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT REMEMBER I DIDN'T ASK HIM THAT MANY
QUESTIONS, BUT WHAT I SAID TO HIM I WANT TO PUT DOWN SOME
MILE POSTS. YOU SHOWED THE JURY A BUNCH OF DOCUMENTS,
DR. PROCTOR, LET'S PUT DOWN SOME MILE POSTS. AND I DID THAT
-- WHY DID I DO THAT? BECAUSE HE SHOWED A BUNCH OF REYNOLDS
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
146 DOCUMENTS THAT CAME FROM A TIME WHEN MR. HARRIS WASN'T A
YOUTH, THINGS FROM BEFORE HE WAS BORN, WHEN HE WAS WELL PAST
HIS YOUTH AND IN HIS 30'S AND HIS 40'S. SO I'LL TALK ABOUT
THOSE TWO ISSUES AND I WANT TO MOVE FORWARD AND REFOCUS ON
THE ACTUAL ISSUES IN THIS CASE.
I'M GOING TO WALK THROUGH A FEW OF THE QUESTIONS ON
THE VERDICT FORM. YOU HAVE SEEN THE VERDICT FORM ALREADY
THIS MORNING. YOU SAW IT FROM MS. LONDON, AND YOU SAW IT
WHEN MR. COFER STOOD UP, BUT LET ME ADD SOME ADDITIONAL
THOUGHTS.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT QUESTION 3. NOW, MR. COFER
ALREADY DISCUSSED THE EVIDENCE ON ADDICTION. I'M NOT GOING
TO REPEAT THAT. WE BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD FIND THAT
MR. HARRIS WAS NOT ADDICTED, BUT IF YOU FIND THAT HE WAS,
YOU'LL BE ASKED TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION. YOU'VE ALREADY
HEARD A LOT ABOUT LEGAL CAUSE THIS MORNING, AND THE JUDGE IS
GOING TO INSTRUCT YOU, AND YOU'LL HAVE THOSE INSTRUCTIONS,
BUT TO BE A LEGAL CAUSE, "PLAINTIFF MUST PROVE AN ADDICTION,
AN ADDICTION, NOT SMOKING, AN ADDICTION CONTRIBUTED
SUBSTANTIALLY TO MR. HARRIS CONTINUING TO SMOKE. THAT, BUT
FOR HIS ADDICTION, BUT FOR HIS ADDICTION, HIS HEART DISEASE
AND LARYNGEAL CANCER WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED."
NOW, MS. LONDON TOLD YOU THIS MORNING THAT
ADDICTION DIDN'T NEED TO BE THE ONLY LEGAL CAUSE. THAT'S
TRUE.
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
147 COURT: LET ME JUST INTERRUPT YOU FOR ONE
MOMENT. THE "B" HAS BEEN CHANGED. WE REACHED SOME DIFFERENT
LANGUAGE. YOU WILL GET THESE IN THE INSTRUCTIONS, BUT I JUST
WANT TO BE CLEAR ON THAT SO THE JURY IS NOT CONFUSED.
MS. BAKER: YES. THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
WE USED A MORE SPECIFIC TERM SO YOU AREN'T CONFUSED
ABOUT THAT QUESTION.
MS. LONDON TOLD YOU ADDICTION DIDN'T NEED TO BE THE
ONLY LEGAL CAUSE THAT'S TRUE, BUT LOOK AT THE INSTRUCTION
CAREFULLY AND LISTEN TO IT CAREFULLY WHEN THE JUDGE INSTRUCTS
YOU. IT REQUIRES THAT ADDICTION BE A SUBSTANTIAL CAUSE.
WHAT MS. LONDON TOLD YOU DOESN'T CHANGE THAT REQUIREMENT.
AND THE EVIDENCE ON THIS ISSUE IS CLEAR. ADDICTION WAS NOT A
LEGAL OR SUBSTANTIAL CAUSE OF MR. HARRIS' HEART DISEASE OR
LARYNGEAL CANCER. THE ONLY LEGAL CAUSE, THE ONLY SUBSTANTIAL
CAUSE WAS HIS CHOICE TO SMOKE AND CONTINUE SMOKING.
WE KNOW THAT MR. HARRIS KNEW THAT SMOKING WAS GOING
TO KILL HIM IF HE CONTINUED TO SMOKE, BACK IN 1985 WHEN HE
WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER AND IT WAS CURED. MR. HARRIS
WASN'T CONFUSED, BUT HE MADE A CHOICE TO IGNORE THAT WARNING
AND KEEP SMOKING. YOU HAVE HEARD THAT STORY A LOT IN THIS
TRIAL AND YOU MIGHT HAVE WONDERED WHY. WHY DO I KEEP HEARING
THIS? WHY DOES IT MATTER? IT MATTERS BECAUSE IT TELLS US
WHAT MR. HARRIS DID WHEN HE WAS WARNED. WHEN HE WAS GIVEN
INFORMATION ABOUT THE DANGERS OF SMOKING, WHAT DID HE DO? HE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
148 DIDN'T QUIT. NOT ONLY DID HE NOT QUIT HE DIDN'T TRY TO QUIT,
AND THAT WAS HIS CHOICE AND THAT WAS HIS RIGHT. BUT THE
CHOICE TO SMOKE OR THE CHOICE TO CONTINUE SMOKING -- AND
THAT'S FINE AND WE DON'T CRITICIZE THAT CHOICE -- BUT THAT
CHOICE TO SMOKE AND CONTINUE SMOKING THAT WAS NOT A ONE-TIME
SHOT.
PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL AND DR. BURNS WOULD HAVE YOU
BELIEVE THAT ONCE MR. HARRIS BECAME A REGULAR SMOKER IT WAS
ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE HE GOT HEART DISEASE AND CANCER.
BUT WE KNOW THAT MR. HARRIS HAD NUMEROUS EXIT RAMPS OFF THAT
HIGHWAY, MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO QUIT. WHAT WAS THE EVIDENCE
ABOUT THAT IN THIS CASE? WHEN HE SAW AN EXIT RAMP, HE KEPT
ON DRIVING. HE DROVE RIGHT PAST THESE EXITS, EXIT AFTER
EXIT, HE CHOSE TO KEEP SMOKING.
IN 1966 WHEN THE WARNING LABEL WENT ON EACH AND
EVERY PACK HE DROVE PAST THE EXIT AND KEPT SMOKING.
SAME IN 1970 WHEN THE WARNING LABEL CHANGED HE KEPT
ON DRIVING AND KEPT SMOKING.
'74 WHEN HE WENT TO AA AND QUIT DRINKING FOR GOOD,
HE KEPT ON DRIVING AND DROVE RIGHT PAST THAT EXIT AND KEPT
SMOKING.
'85 WHEN HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER AND KNEW THAT
IT WOULD KILL HIM, HE CHOSE TO DRIVE PAST THAT EXIT AND KEEP
ON SMOKING.
MILLIONS OF SMOKERS WERE QUITTING DURING THIS TIME
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
149 PERIOD. MR. HARRIS ISN'T EVEN TRYING TO QUIT. HE DIDN'T
MAKE ONE "QUIT ATTEMPT", NOT IN THE '50'S, NOT IN THE '60'S,
NOT IN THE '70'S, NOT IN THE '80'S. WHAT DOES THAT TELL US?
IT TELLS US THAT MR. HARRIS' WASN'T A TORTURED ADDICT. THERE
ARE SMOKERS WHO DESPERATELY WANT TO QUIT. THAT'S NOT
MR. HARRIS. SMOKERS WHO TRY, AND TRY, AND TRY AND CAN'T
QUIT, NOT MR. HARRIS. SMOKERS WHO ASK THEIR FAMILY, AND
FRIENDS, AND THEIR DOCTORS FOR HELP OVER AND OVER AGAIN, NOT
MR. HARRIS. SMOKERS WHO WANT TO QUIT TO REDUCE THEIR RISK OR
FOR OTHER HEALTH REASONS AND MAYBE GET SICK ANYWAY, THAT
WASN'T MR. HARRIS. MR. HARRIS AND HIS CHOICES STOOD IN
BETWEEN ADDICTION AND HIS HEART DISEASE AND LARYNGEAL CANCER.
AND I WANT TO PULL UP THIS SLIDE.
IT WAS MR. HARRIS BETWEEN AN ADDICTION AND HEART
DISEASE AND CANCER, AND BECAUSE OF THAT, BECAUSE OF THAT YOU
SHOULD ANSWER "NO" TO QUESTION 3 ON THE VERDICT FORM AND
PROCEED NO FURTHER.
BUT IF YOU DO GO FURTHER ON THE VERDICT, AND I
DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD, BUT THIS IS MY CHANCE TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT IT, BUT IF YOU DO GO FURTHER LET ME TAKE A
MOMENT AND TALK ABOUT SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS.
QUESTIONS 4 AND 6 ON THE VERDICT FORM. THESE ARE
QUESTIONS WHERE YOU'LL HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER CIGARETTES MADE
BY MY CLIENT, BY R.J. REYNOLDS, WERE A LEGAL CAUSE OR
SUBSTANTIALLY CONTRIBUTED TO MR. HARRIS' DISEASES. AND YOU
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
150 CAN SEE THAT EACH DEFENDANT IS TREATED SEPARATELY ON THIS
QUESTION AND THESE QUESTIONS.
AND AS I TOLD YOU IN OPENING, THE PLAINTIFF HAS THE
BURDEN, AND THAT WAS TWO PARTS, RIGHT. THE BURDEN, THAT'S
PART NO. 1, AND PROOF, WHICH IS HARD EVIDENCE. I ASKED YOU
TO DEMAND HARD EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE ON ALL OF PLAINTIFF'S
CLAIMS, BUT ON THIS CLAIM IN PARTICULAR AS IT RELATES TO MY
CLIENT. I SAID NOT GUESSES. NOT COULD-BE'S. NOT
IT'S-POSSIBLE'S. HARD EVIDENCE.
YOU HEARD TESTIMONY IN THIS CASE ABOUT THREE
REYNOLDS BRANDS, WINSTON, CAMEL AND PALL MALL. THE FIRST
REYNOLDS BRAND YOU HEARD ABOUT YOU HEARD THAT MR. HARRIS
SMOKED WAS WINSTON. NOW, JUDGE SARGUS WILL INSTRUCT YOU THAT
YOU ARE THE SOLE JUDGES OF THE CREDIBILITY OF THE WITNESSES
AND THE TESTIMONY THAT THEIR WEIGHT DESERVES. YOU GET TO
DETERMINE WHETHER A WITNESS IS WORTHY OF BELIEF. YOU ARE TO
CONSIDER THAT WITNESS'S MOTIVE AND YOU WILL HAVE TO DECIDE
WHETHER MRS. HARRIS' STORY IS CREDIBLE.
AS YOU HEARD, WE ASKED MRS. HARRIS AT HER
DEPOSITION WHICH BRANDS SHE REMEMBERED HER HUSBAND SMOKING,
AND SHE SAID THERE WERE FOUR. NONE OF THOSE WERE REYNOLDS
BRANDS, AND ONE L&M, WAS MADE BY A COMPANY THAT IS NOT A
DEFENDANT IN THIS LAWSUIT. THAT'S IT. THAT'S WHAT SHE TOLD
US AT HER DEPOSITION.
NOW, WHEN SHE WAS ASKED THE SAME QUESTION HERE WHEN
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
151 SHE TOOK THE STAND AT THIS TRIAL, HER STORY CHANGED. SHE
SAID SHE REMEMBERED MR. HARRIS SMOKING WINSTON, AND SHE
FORGOT ABOUT L&M, THAT BRAND MADE BY A DEFENDANT, MADE BY A
COMPANY THAT'S NOT A DEFENDANT IN THIS CASE. BUT MRS. HARRIS
DIDN'T TELL YOU WHEN MR. HARRIS ALLEGEDLY SMOKED WINSTON OR
HOW LONG HE SMOKED IT. IF SHE COULD HAVE, SHE WOULD HAVE,
BUT SHE DIDN'T, AND THAT'S NO HARD EVIDENCE.
THE NEXT BRAND YOU HEARD ABOUT -- THE NEXT TWO
BRANDS WERE PALL MALL AND CAMEL, AND YOU HEARD THOSE FROM
MR. JENNINGS. AND HE TESTIFIED THAT MR. HARRIS SMOKED PALL
MALL OFF AND ON FOR ABOUT 6 TO 8 MONTHS, AND CAMEL OFF AND ON
FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS. THAT'S THE SUM TOTAL ABOUT WHAT YOU
HEARD ABOUT MR. HARRIS SMOKING REYNOLDS BRANDS. AND OTHER
THAN PRICE, YOU DIDN'T HEAR WHY MR. HARRIS CHOSE TO SMOKE ANY
BRAND THAT HE SMOKED.
NOW, I TOLD YOU IN OPENING THAT YOU MIGHT HEAR SOME
VAGUE OR HAZY MEMORIES ABOUT WHAT MR. HARRIS SMOKED AND WHEN,
BUT THOSE VAGUE MEMORIES DON'T SATISFY PLAINTIFF'S BURDEN.
NOW, WE'VE TALKED A LOT IN THIS TRIAL, AND TODAY,
ABOUT SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION, LEGAL CAUSE AND SUBSTANTIAL
CONTRIBUTION. AND LET ME OFFER A WAY TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER
SOMETHING IS A SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION.
I HAVE TWO BOYS. I HAVE TWO LITTLE BOYS AND THEY
LIKE TO PLAY WITH LEGO'S. NOW IMAGINE THAT THERE ARE 40
LEGO'S SPREAD OUT ON THE FLOOR AND I ASK THEM TO CLEAN THOSE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
152 UP, AND ONE OF MY BOYS CLEANS UP AND PUTS 39 OF THOSE LEGO'S
BACK IN THE BUCKET AND ONE PUTS ONE BACK IN. NOW, I CAN
ASSURE YOU THAT THE ONE BOY WILL NOT THINK THAT HIS
SUBSTANTIALLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE CLEAN-UP EFFORT BY PUTTING
ONE LEGO IN THE BUCKET. AND JUST LIKE THAT, HARD EVIDENCE OF
ABOUT ONE YEAR OF REYNOLDS SMOKING DID NOT AND COULD NOT
SUBSTANTIALLY CONTRIBUTE TO MR. HARRIS' DISEASES.
THE COURT: YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES, COUNSEL.
MS. BAKER: THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
NOW, MOVING DOWN THE VERDICT FORM THERE IS ANOTHER
QUESTION WHERE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF
REYNOLDS CIGARETTES THAT MR. HARRIS SMOKED, AND THAT'S
QUESTIONS 5 AND 7. MR. COFER TALKED TO YOU ABOUT THAT.
MR. BIELBY TALKED TO YOU ABOUT THAT.
THIS QUESTION IS ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY. IT'S NOT
SOME GLOBAL COMPARATIVE OF CONDUCT. SO IF YOU HEAR
MS. LONDON TALK ABOUT REYNOLDS AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS AND
THEIR CHOICES, WHETHER THEY AFFECTED OTHER SMOKERS, THAT'S
NOT WHAT THIS QUESTION IS ABOUT. THIS IS NOT THE COMPARISON
THIS QUESTION CALLED FOR. MAYBE YOU SAW THINGS THAT PHILIP
MORRIS, OR LORILLARD, OR REYNOLDS OR SOME OTHER COMPANY SAID,
OR WROTE THAT YOU DIDN'T LIKE, BUT IF DIDN'T AFFECT
MR. HARRIS, IT'S NOT FAIR GAME WHEN ANSWERING THIS QUESTION.
YOU ALREADY HEARD THAT MR. HARRIS' CHOICES TO
CONTINUE SMOKING IN THE FACE OF NUMEROUS EXIT RAMPS, NUMEROUS
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
153 OPPORTUNITIES TO QUIT HIS CHOICE NOT TO QUIT AND NOT EVEN
TRY, YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT, MR. HARRIS IS 100 PERCENT
RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE CHOICES.
MS. LONDON: OBJECTION.
THE COURT: WELL, IT'S ARGUMENT. THE OBJECTION IS
OVERRULED. YOU WILL DECIDE ALL THIS OF COURSE.
MS. BAKER: MR. HARRIS HAD 100 PERCENT CONTROL OVER
THOSE CHOICES. HE HAD THE CONTROL. HE HAD THE POWER, AND
NOW HE HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY.
I WANT TO MOVE DOWN -- I WANT TO KEEP MOVING DOWN
THE VERDICT FORM TO QUESTIONS 8, 10, 12 AND 14. THESE ARE
THE QUESTIONS THAT MR. COFER TALKED TO YOU ABOUT, THE
QUESTIONS HAVING TO DO WITH CONCEALMENT AND AGREEMENT TO
CONCEAL.
NOW, AGAIN, WE DON'T BELIEVE YOU SHOULD GET THIS
FAR IN THE VERDICT FORM, BUT IF YOU DO, I WANT YOU TO FOCUS
ON ONE WORD "RELIANCE". MRS. HARRIS HAS TO PROVE THAT
SOMETHING PHILIP MORRIS, LORILLARD OR REYNOLDS SAID OR DID
CAUSED MR. HARRIS, NOT SOME OTHER SMOKER, MR. HARRIS TO TAKE
SOME ACTION TO RELY ON WHAT THEY SAID OR DID AND THAT THAT
CAUSED HIS DISEASES.
I WANT YOU TO LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT THESE JURY
INSTRUCTIONS AND LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY TO THE JUDGE THIS
MORNING. HE WILL TALK TO YOU ABOUT RELIANCE, ON THESE
QUESTIONS, ON THESE QUESTIONS ON THE VERDICT FORM, THE ONLY
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
154 WITNESS YOU REALLY NEEDED TO HEAR FROM WAS MRS. HARRIS, NOT
DR. PROCTOR OR DR. BURNS. THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
THESE ISSUES. MRS. HARRIS WAS THE ONLY ONE YOU HEARD FROM.
LET ME JUST SAY FOR A MOMENT YOU HEARD A LOT THIS
MORNING OF WHO SHOULD HAVE CALL WHAT WITNESSES. LET ME JUST
SAY IF THERE WAS ANY EVIDENCE, ANY EVIDENCE THAT MR. HARRIS
RELIED ON SOMETHING ANY TOBACCO SAID OR DID YOU WOULD HAVE
HEARD FROM THIS WITNESS. THEY WOULD HAVE CALLED THAT WITNESS
AT THIS TRIAL. YOU DIDN'T HEAR THAT. IN FACT, YOU HEARD
QUITE THE OPPOSITE.
WHAT DID MRS. HARRIS SAY ABOUT WHETHER MR. HARRIS
RELIED -- "HE NEVER RELIED ON ANY STATEMENT MADE BY A TOBACCO
COMPANY OR ANY AD IN MAKING HIS DECISION TO START SMOKING.
HE DID NOT RELY ON ADS IN MAKING HIS DECISION TO CONTINUE
SMOKING. HE NEVER SAID A TOBACCO COMPANY WITHHELD
INFORMATION FROM HIM. HE NEVER SAID HE WISHED A TOBACCO
COMPANY WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM MORE INFORMATION. AND HE NEVER
SAID IF A TOBACCO WOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING TO HIM SOONER IT
WOULD HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE." LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT'S
NOT HARD EVIDENCE. THAT'S NOT RELIANCE.
NOW, I'M COMING CLOSE TO WRAPPING UP AND THE JUDGE,
I'M SURE, IS ABOUT TO GIVE ME A ONE-MINUTE WARNING, BUT
BEFORE I GET TO THE LAST QUESTION ON THE VERDICT FORM I WANT
TO SPEND JUST A MOMENT ON DAMAGES. IF YOU DECIDE TO RETURN A
VERDICT FOR MRS. HARRIS, YOU'LL HAVE TO DECIDE THE AMOUNT OF
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
155 DAMAGES, AND THIS IS A DIFFICULT QUESTION FOR ME, BECAUSE
OBVIOUSLY I BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD NOT COMPENSATE
MRS. HARRIS FOR MR. HARRIS' CHOICES. BUT WE ALL FEEL
COMPASSION AND WE ALL WISH MRS. HARRIS WELL. BUT COMPASSION
AND GOOD WISHES ARE NOT REASONS TO EXCEED COMMON SENSE AND
GOOD JUDGMENT.
MS. LONDON THIS MORNING ASKED YOU FOR MILLIONS OF
DOLLARS FOR MR. HARRIS' CHOICES, BUT THE JUDGE WILL INSTRUCT
YOU THAT ANY AWARD SHOULD BE FAIR AND JUST IN LIGHT OF THE
EVIDENCE. SO IF YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE AN AWARD AND COMPENSATE
MRS. HARRIS FOR HER HUSBAND'S CHOICES, PLEASE DO SO BASED
ONLY ON THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU HEARD USING YOUR COMMON SENSE
AND YOUR GOOD JUDGMENT.
NOW QUESTION 18, YOU ALREADY HEARD ABOUT THIS A
COUPLE OF TIMES, BUT LET ME VERY BRIEFLY SAY, IF YOU GET TO
THIS QUESTION, IF YOU GET THAT FAR, YOU WILL HAVE ALREADY
FULLY COMPENSATED -- WHY DON'T WE GO AHEAD AND PULL UP THIS
SLIDE -- YOU WILL HAVE ALREADY FULLY COMPENSATED MRS. HARRIS
FOR MR. HARRIS' DISEASES.
PUNITIVE DAMAGES CAN ONLY BE AWARDED TO
MRS. HARRIS, AND THEY CAN ONLY AWARDED FOR CONCEALMENT OR AN
AGREEMENT TO CONCEAL. WHEN CONSIDERING THIS QUESTION, I ASK
YOU TO CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING: THOSE EMPLOYEES THAT YOU
HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT IN THIS TRIAL, THOSE DOCUMENTS THAT YOU
SAW FLASHING ON THE SCREEN FROM 30, 40, 50 YEARS AGO,
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
156 SOMETIMES LONGER, THE AUTHORS OF THOSE DOCUMENTS, PEOPLE LIKE
DR. TEAGUE OR DIANE BURROWS, THEY LONG AGO LEFT THOSE
COMPANIES AND MANY ARE NOW DEAD.
DRS. PROCTOR AND BURNS TALKED ABOUT SECRET
DOCUMENTS. THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE SECRET NO MORE. THERE'S A
PUBLIC WEBSITE WITH TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE.
ANYONE CAN GO SEE THOSE DOCUMENTS, NOT JUST DR. BURNS AND NOT
JUST DR. PROCTOR.
IF THE COMPANY'S POSITION ON SMOKING AND HEALTH AND
ADDICTION THROUGHOUT THE YEARS BOTHERED YOU, CONSIDER THAT
THOSE POSITIONS CHANGED OVER A DECADE AGO WHEN THEY ADMITTED
THAT SMOKING CAUSED CANCER AND WAS ADDICTIVE. THERE IS NO
NEED TO PUNISH AND DETER. AND BASED ON THE EVIDENCE AND
PLAINTIFF'S FAILURE TO MEET HER CLEAR AND CONVINCING BURDEN
YOUR ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION, YOUR ANSWER TO QUESTION 18
SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE "NO".
NOW, THIS IS MY LAST CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND I
AM ALMOST DONE. AS THE PLAINTIFF HAS THE BURDEN OF PROOF
SHE'LL GET THE LAST CHANCE -- SHE'LL GET THE LAST OPPORTUNITY
TO SPEAK WITH YOU, AND SHE'LL GET TO RESPOND TO MUCH OF WHAT
I HAVE SAID, AND MR. COFER AND MR. BIELBY. WE WILL NOT GET
AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO HER. SO I ASK YOU BECAUSE WE
CAN'T RESPOND I ASK THAT YOU BE OUR ADVOCATE IN THE JURY ROOM
WHEN YOU DELIBERATE.
YOU'VE SEEN HOW WE RESPONDED IN THIS TRIAL, HOW
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 157
WE'VE GIVEN YOU THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY AND WE STAYED
FOCUSED ON THE FACTS IN THIS CASE. I ASK YOU TO KEEP THOSE
FACTS AND MR. HARRIS' CHOICES IN MIND AND RETURN A VERDICT IN
DEFENDANTS' FAVOR.
MEMBERS OF THE JURY, IT'S BEEN AN HONOR AND A
PRIVILEGE TO TRY THIS CASE IN FRONT OF YOU. I THANK YOU FOR
YOU ATTENTION AND YOUR PATIENCE AND YOUR SERVICE THROUGHOUT
TRIAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
