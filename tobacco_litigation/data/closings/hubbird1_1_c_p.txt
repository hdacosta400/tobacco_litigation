3           MR. KAISER:  May it please the Court,
4      Counsel, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, good
5      morning.
6           JURORS:  Good morning.
7           MR. KAISER:  What I'm going to do is to
8      track the verdict form that you will have,
9      you'll be able to read it and you're going to
10      consider it when you go in and deliberate in
11      this case.
12           And I'd like to start off with the first
13      question you're going to be asked, and it goes
14      to class membership.  So we're going to talk
15      about addiction, and we're going to talk about
16      the medical issues.
17           And your first question on the verdict
18      form is going to be:  "Is David Ellsworth a
19      member of the Engle class?  That is, was Mr.
20      Ellsworth addicted to smoking cigarettes
21      containing nicotine; and, if so, was such
22      addiction a legal cause of his lung cancer?"
23           So in order to begin our discussions on
24      Engle class, let's talk about addiction.  And
25      you will recall the evidence, because the

1      evidence showed the following:
2           You will recall that David Ellsworth
3      started smoking at a young age.  There are
4      medical records that you have that show he
5      started perhaps as young as 14.  There's been
6      other testimony as well that, suffice it to
7      say, David Ellsworth was a child, was a kid,
8      when he started smoking back in the '40s or the
9      '50s.  We know that.
10           David Ellsworth started smoking as a young
11      kid at a time when his brain was not yet fully
12      developed.  We know that.
13           We know that when David Ellsworth started
14      smoking as a kid and whose brain was not
15      developed, he became more susceptible to
16      becoming addicted quicker and having a stronger
17      addiction that, according to Dr. O'Brien, would
18      be harder to treat.  We know that.
19           We know that throughout David Ellsworth's
20      life, he smoked from morning, noon till night.
21      We know that he smoked a lot of cigarettes.  We
22      know that he smoked at least two packs of
23      cigarettes a day, maybe more.  We know that he
24      smoked two packs of cigarettes, maybe more,
25      every day of his life without a day off.

1           I ask you, do you know is it feasible that
2      anybody can engage in an activity or use a
3      substance with such frequency as David
4      Ellsworth was able to do smoking a cigarette
5      every single day of his life without taking a
6      day off that isn't addicted?
7           And it's humanly impossible because no one
8      on the face of the earth was able to engage in
9      an activity with such frequency, and no one is
10      able to use a substance with such frequency.
11           No one can eat that much food, no one can
12      drink that much drink.  It's just humanly
13      impossible.  And if someone uses something
14      frequently, they don't have to do it every day
15      of their life if they're not addicted.  The
16      bottom line here is:  Do you really think that
17      David Ellsworth smoked every single day of his
18      life without taking a day off just because he
19      liked it?
20           That's silly.  He smoked every single day
21      of his life without a day off because he was
22      addicted, because it affected his brain to such
23      an extent that he couldn't stop.
24           And just think of this.  If you have any
25      lingering doubt about whether or not this was

1      just for enjoyment or not, maybe for another
2      reason.
3           Do you think when David Ellsworth had
4      pains in his ribs, and he was coughing up blood
5      for three weeks before he went to a doctor to
6      get diagnosed with lung cancer, do you think if
7      he wasn't addicted that maybe he wouldn't be
8      smoking a cigarette knowing full well this is
9      probably a lung problem, I'm coughing up blood
10      and I've got really serious rib pain, and the
11      man is smoking.  That is addiction beyond
12      doubt.
13           Now, remember Dr. O'Brien.  Dr. O'Brien
14      testified.  He testified about changes to the
15      brain.  He testified about memory.  He
16      testified about learning, that each puff of a
17      cigarette is a learned behavior.  It is a
18      memory.  It's not like doing some activity that
19      you will adapt to.
20           And that's why he explained, you can look
21      at a sunset, and that releases dopamine, and
22      that activates the pleasure zone in your brain;
23      but you adapt to it so that after a thousand
24      times the sunset is not a real big deal.
25           With cigarettes, Dr. O'Brien told you,

1      with each puff it is the same reinforcing
2      effect, it is the same learned behavior, it is
3      the same memory; and when you have millions and
4      millions of those memories stored in the brain,
5      you don't adapt, you become addicted, and that
6      changes your brain permanently.
7           Now let's take a look at what he said,
8      briefly, and we'll move on to medicine.
9           Dr. O'Brien said, you know, addiction is
10      very often a lifelong problem.  Of course it is
11      because it changes your brain for years, and
12      that explains why, after quitting smoking for
13      20 years, 25 years, one day the person
14      relapses, starts smoking, doesn't know why.
15           The drug activates this reward system and
16      it tends to produce learning.  Just like he
17      said, with any of the cues that are also
18      present that a person learns to associate with
19      the effect of the drug.  That's Dr. O'Brien
20      talking about that whole reward system and the
21      cues.
22           Remember what else he said?  Sometimes
23      these cues are involuntary, you don't even see
24      it and yet you're smoking a cigarette.  And
25      when he's trying to counsel people to stop, he

1      tells them that, and they can't believe it.
2           That's an involuntary response, that is a
3      diminished control in your ability to control
4      your smoking.  It's a loss of control.  If you
5      don't see a cue and you automatically smoke
6      because of that, that's not something you're
7      doing on your own volition.
8           Well, based on what I know, it's believed
9      that younger people, when they start smoking,
10      become hooked, become -- develop the disorder
11      much more rapidly than older people.
12           We know in this case, David Ellsworth
13      started as a young person.  Does one's
14      addiction cause a diminished or loss of
15      control?  Yes, that's pretty much part of
16      addiction.
17           Well, what it has to do with, the fact
18      that you have this reflex activation of the
19      reward system, which produces craving, and some
20      of it is at the unconscious level.  So you're
21      not consciously deciding to do something.  Like
22      Dr. O'Brien said, it is an involuntary response
23      to a condition.
24           Addiction is a disease that impairs free
25      will.  It's not that they want to do it.  It

1      often seems that they are pushed to do things
2      that are against their own -- their own
3      benefits, their own life circumstances.
4           And finally, when Dr. O'Brien testified,
5      "I've never seen anybody who had this much
6      evidence and wasn't addicted."
7           And remember in response to one of the
8      questions by you as the jurors:  "Do you think
9      David Ellsworth could have quit?"  And what was
10      his response?  "I don't think so."  He may have
11      had such a smoking history, smoked so long,
12      that Dr. O'Brien thought he probably couldn't
13      have quit smoking.
14           There's no question, based on the evidence
15      you've heard in this case, ladies and
16      gentlemen, that David Ellsworth was addicted to
17      the nicotine in his cigarettes.  That he smoked
18      day in and day out almost every day of his
19      life, without a day off, never got bored, never
20      enjoyed it, he was addicted.
21           Let's talk about the medical evidence in
22      this case.
23           The dispute is whether or not David
24      Ellsworth had this BAC you heard about or the
25      adenocarcinoma along with the squamous

1      carcinoma.  That's the issue.  Not whether he
2      had squamous carcinoma, that's undisputed.
3      That's undisputed.  He had squamous cell lung
4      cancer.
5           It's also undisputed that smoking caused
6      that.  There was not one question asked of
7      Dr. Okun during his direct examination about
8      other risk factors other than smoking, and he
9      agreed, that's about an 85 percent chance with
10      smoking.  So that's not an issue.
11           Let's talk about the issues.
12           Remember, this is the initial pathology
13      report from September of 1993 before he had the
14      operation and they took the lobe out.  This is
15      just the needle biopsy.  This is very important
16      because look at what it is showing.  Remember
17      Dr. Cerfolio.  The needle biopsy is showing
18      poorly differentiated carcinoma, not oat-cell
19      type.
20           Remember Dr. Cerfolio was saying that the
21      pathologist is telling you what he sees, and
22      he's saying that it's not oat cell.  That's
23      that small cell lung cancer that's extremely
24      deadly, with prominent fibroblastic reaction.
25      So we know in September this is a poorly

1      differentiated lung cancer, a carcinoma.
2           Now, by definition, like Dr. Cerfolio
3      said, can't be a BAC, because a BAC is a
4      well-differentiated tumor carcinoma.  Can't be.
5           Now, this is the proof in the pudding.
6      This is the saline washings, the left lung
7      needle biopsy, and what does it tell you?
8           It says, these features are suggestive of
9      adenocarcinoma differentiation, and most
10      importantly, malignant cells present consistent
11      with origin, not evolving, but origin from
12      poorly differentiated carcinoma, not oat-cell
13      type.
14           There's not one word, ladies and
15      gentlemen, that this cancer evolved from
16      anything.  The only word you see and that what
17      the pathologist read was that this was
18      consistent with an origin from poorly
19      differentiated carcinoma.  And even Dr. Okun
20      said:  BAC is a well-differentiated carcinoma.
21           Even before the pathology from the
22      lobectomy, it is demonstrated here that this
23      was not a BAC, this was an adenocarcinoma and a
24      poorly differentiated one at that.
25           And like Dr. Cerfolio said, everything is

1      against the BAC.  BAC is not a poorly
2      differentiated cancer, so there's nothing there
3      for BAC.
4           These features are suggestive of
5      adenocarcinoma differentiation.
6           Just really based on this, it's clear,
7      there's no BAC.  The BAC is nothing but a red
8      herring in this case.
9           Now we come to the pathology report.
10      Remember the October 1993 pathology report we
11      spent a lot of time on?  And we see that
12      there's no issue.  There were two separate
13      tumors.  We know that.  There is an issue --
14      there is an issue with the location of the
15      types of tumors.
16           Remember Dr. Cerfolio, when he had the
17      diagram, he drew this one large circle, and
18      inside the circle was another circle.  There
19      was the large mass, which was the squamous
20      cell, and this adenocarcinoma right on it.
21      Dr. Okun drew two circles, one bigger, one
22      smaller, one next to each other, totally
23      different location than Dr. Cerfolio.  They
24      differed greatly in their interpretation of
25      where the cancer was and how it was.

1           But at any rate, we know they were two
2      separate ones, regardless of where they were
3      located.  We know that this pleural-based
4      poorly differentiated carcinoma was a squamous
5      cell.  We know it was an invasive carcinoma.
6      We know that it invaded the wall of a large
7      blood vessel, we know that it invaded ribs, we
8      know that it invaded the chest wall.  There's
9      no issue that David Ellsworth had an aggressive
10      squamous cell carcinoma that occurred.
11           We also know there was a second lesion,
12      again, this non-oat cell discrete from the
13      first.  And it does say:  Predominantly a
14      bronchioloalveolar, but has focal large cell
15      differentiation as well.
16           Remember when I was talking to Dr. Okun
17      and he had talked about this evolving and the
18      BAC evolves into the aggressive tumor.  And he
19      distinguished the different kinds of non-small
20      lung cancer.  Remember there's a squamous cell
21      that's totally distinct, there's an
22      adenocarcinoma that's totally distinct, and
23      there's a large cell carcinoma that's totally
24      distinct.
25           And remember Dr. Okun said, "Well, a BAC

1      can evolve into an adenocarcinoma."  He said
2      that.
3           He said, "A BAC cannot evolve into a
4      squamous cell because they're different."
5           And he said, "Most importantly, a BAC
6      cannot evolve into a large cell."
7           And remember the pathology report?  We've
8      got large cell differentiation that belies any
9      contention that this BAC somehow evolved into
10      an adenocarcinoma when, before it even goes to
11      the lymph node, there is large cell
12      differentiation.  There's no BAC.
13           And then when we get to the lymph node,
14      the lymph node seems to be associated with this
15      second lesion, which is the large cell
16      differentiation, but this time what the
17      pathologist sees is adenocarcinoma
18      differentiation.
19           And remember what Dr. Cerfolio said.  Lung
20      tumor, unique to most tumors, lung cancer
21      unique to most cancers, are heterogeneous.
22      Most tumors everywhere else in the body you
23      have one type.  Lung cancer you can have many
24      different types in one cell.  You can have an
25      adenocarcinoma, you can have a squamous cell

1      carcinoma, although they're distinct, it's
2      called an adenosquamous.  You can have an
3      adenocarcinoma and you can have a large cell
4      carcinoma.  They are heterogeneous.  And that's
5      what Dr. Cerfolio said, and that's often seen,
6      and it's a big problem in lung cancer because
7      these are invasive cancers.
8           And so Dr. Cerfolio was saying, people who
9      smoke have a more poorly differentiated cancer,
10      you commonly see an aggressive tumor, bigger
11      than three or four centimeters, commonly poor,
12      dedifferentiated, and very aggressive.  That's
13      the squamous cell.
14           90 percent of squamous cell carcinomas are
15      from people who smoke.  So it is by far the
16      number one.  He differs with Dr. Okun by five
17      percentage points.  Dr. Okun said it was
18      85 percent; Dr. Cerfolio said it was
19      90 percent.
20           And then Dr. Cerfolio is telling you
21      there's a second lesion discrete from the
22      first, and he explained why this is not a BAC.
23      You might see some BAC in a heterogenous tumor,
24      you might see some BAC along with adeno and
25      large cell, but that doesn't mean it evolved

1      from anything.
2           And remember I asked Dr. Cerfolio:  "Where
3      does it start?  How can you tell us where it
4      starts?"
5           And he said:  "No one knows, only the good
6      Lord knows," is what he said.
7           And that's the pathology.
8           And, finally, we have the report of the
9      radiation oncologist.  And the radiation
10      oncologist, what he was doing was he was
11      cutting and pasting from the pathology report,
12      but then when he didn't cut and paste, he
13      referred to that second lesion that we just saw
14      that it was a poorly differentiated carcinoma,
15      non-oat cell type similar to the
16      adenocarcinomatous differentiated lesion.
17           So when he wasn't cutting and pasting, he
18      said the same thing, this was an
19      adenocarcinoma, not a BAC.
20           So certainly more likely than not, this
21      was not a BAC.  There's no doubt this was not a
22      BAC.
23           Anyone who thinks that maybe he had this
24      BAC just lingering and nobody knew because
25      they're so slow growing.  Remember Dr. Cerfolio

1      said:  These are indolent, slow-growing,
2      nonaggressive tumors, that when he sees them,
3      and he's seen a lot, he doesn't do anything, he
4      watches them.
5           And like he said in this case, if David
6      Ellsworth, that's all he had was a BAC, he'd be
7      sitting here today, because he would have lived
8      a long time, because these are nonaggressive
9      tumors.
10           So if you think there might have been this
11      BAC lingering for many years, look at this.
12      David Ellsworth was getting tested.  So we know
13      in 1993 they tested his left lung.  They found
14      no fungus, everything was negative for TB.
15           Don't you think at that time they might
16      have seen another growth if there was a BAC?
17      They didn't see anything.  Everything was
18      negative.  So there's no lingering BAC that
19      nobody knew about that was just lying there.
20           And, finally, just some of the things that
21      Dr. Cerfolio said.  Of course you are to
22      consider all of the testimony, but this is just
23      some of them.
24           And what did Dr. Cerfolio say?  "BAC,
25      usually in middle-aged women who don't smoke."

1      And his testimony was in all of the patients he
2      has, he has never had a man with a BAC.
3           And Dr. Okun, in response to one of your
4      questions, said, "BACs are commonly found more
5      in women than in men."
6           Without treatment of a BAC, how long can a
7      person live?  They can go forever.
8           When you're treating someone with cancer,
9      is it the case where a person's lung cancer is
10      always either a squamous cell, an adeno, or
11      some other type exclusively?  And his answer
12      was:  No, that's what makes lung cancer -- and
13      it should be "unusual" -- if you really look
14      under the microscope, it's almost always
15      heterogeneous.  It's got all of these things
16      there.
17           What is your opinion with regard to both
18      of these cancers and their contribution to the
19      death, in this case, of Mr. Ellsworth?  I think
20      both the squamous cell that was growing through
21      the ribs and was very aggressive and growing
22      through arteries, and the adenocarcinoma that
23      metastasized to the lymph nodes, both of those
24      together took his life.  That's Dr. Cerfolio's
25      opinion.

1           You have no question about addiction in
2      this case.  There's no question about the
3      medical causation this not being a BAC.
4           How, then, is addiction a legal cause of
5      the disease?  And remember what Dr. O'Brien
6      said.  When you are addicted, it causes you to
7      smoke more cigarettes; when you smoke more
8      cigarettes, you get more toxins; when you get
9      more toxins, you have more of a risk for
10      developing an illness.  And in this case,
11      that's exactly what happened to David
12      Ellsworth.
13           He was addicted to the nicotine in the
14      cigarettes.  It compelled him to smoke more
15      than he would, he developed, he got more toxins
16      from inhalation of these toxins, which
17      ultimately caused his lung cancer, resulted in
18      his lung cancer, and he died.  That is class
19      membership.
20           So in answer to Question Number 1 on the
21      verdict form:  "Was Mr. Ellsworth addicted to
22      smoking cigarettes containing nicotine; and, if
23      so, was such addiction a legal cause of his
24      lung cancer?"  The answer is beyond doubt, not
25      just more likely than not, it is beyond doubt

1      here, yes.
2           "Was David Ellsworth's death legally
3      caused by lung cancer that was caused by
4      smoking cigarettes manufactured by R.J.
5      Reynolds Tobacco Company?"  Well, the evidence
6      in this case was that the only cigarettes David
7      Ellsworth smoked were manufactured by R.J.
8      Reynolds Tobacco Company, or subsidiaries that
9      became R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.
10           Lucky Strikes we have evidence he smoked,
11      Viceroys we have evidence he smoked, Winstons
12      we have evidence he smoked.  Nothing more, all
13      RJR products.  The cigarettes, if they killed
14      him, were cigarettes manufactured by R.J.
15      Reynolds.  The answer to Question Number 2,
16      obviously that is yes.
17           The next thing that you have to consider
18      then is what we call the reliance element.
19           And what I want to do is once we prove
20      class membership, remember, you are now
21      entitled to consider the Engle findings.  They
22      are binding on you, we did not need to prove
23      any of these facts independently.
24           And so you know, smoking cigarettes causes
25      lung cancer, doesn't cause BAC, doesn't cause

1      BAC.  There wasn't a BAC in this case.  That
2      cigarette -- that nicotine in cigarettes is
3      addictive.
4           The fact that the cigarettes manufactured
5      by R.J. Reynolds are what killed David
6      Ellsworth, we have demonstrated that there has
7      been negligence and the strict liability we
8      have proved.  So those two claims, done.  You
9      don't need to consider them again.
10           What else do we have to do?  For reliance.
11      We know, because of the Engle findings, that
12      defendant concealed or omitted material
13      information not otherwise known or available,
14      knowing that the material was false and
15      misleading, or failed to disclose material fact
16      concerning the health effects or addictive
17      nature of smoking cigarettes, or both.  And
18      that defendant agreed to conceal, agreed to
19      conceal and omit information regarding the
20      health effects of cigarettes or their addictive
21      nature with the intention that smokers and the
22      public would rely on this information to their
23      detriment.
24           So let's talk about reliance.  What we do
25      know from the evidence in this case is that

1      R.J. Reynolds had more information about their
2      product than David Ellsworth did.  R.J.
3      Reynolds, for a long time, knew that their
4      product would cause lung cancer, and David
5      Ellsworth didn't.  R.J. Reynolds knew for a
6      long time what their product contained, what
7      chemicals, what toxins, what was in their
8      cigarette; and we have no evidence that David
9      Ellsworth knew that.  And so we know as a
10      given, R.J. Reynolds had more information about
11      their cigarettes, and they concealed
12      information about their cigarettes.
13           We know, number two, that David Ellsworth
14      was exposed to mass media.  We know David
15      Ellsworth was exposed to radio, we know David
16      Ellsworth was exposed to television when he was
17      a kid, in the '40s and the '50s, and we know
18      David Ellsworth would have seen commercials for
19      cigarettes on television.  We know he would
20      have heard commercials for cigarettes on radio.
21      We know he did because his brother said he did,
22      because his brother, Richard, said they
23      remembered, they would sit together, listen to
24      the radio at the house, they would hear
25      commercials, and, in fact, Richard Ellsworth

1      remembers the Lucky Strike commercials and to
2      this day still remembers the jingles.  He still
3      remembers the LSMFT, "Lucky Strike Means Fine
4      Tobacco."  Even today he remembers that jingle.
5      Why do you think so?  Because they probably
6      heard that a lot back in the day.
7           And what did he say?  He smoked Luckys,
8      his brother, David, smoked Lucky Strikes.
9      Clearly David Ellsworth got the message.  He
10      heard something.  He started smoking Lucky
11      Strikes.
12           We also know that David Ellsworth smoked
13      Viceroys.  We know Viceroys, at one time, was a
14      popular cigarette.
15           We know David Ellsworth smoked Winstons.
16      We know at one time Winston was the leading
17      selling cigarette.  David Ellsworth got the
18      message somewhere.  We know he was exposed to
19      mass media.
20           And you also heard, you listened to his
21      deposition, and you saw Robert Heimann, this
22      representative, this president from American
23      Tobacco Company, which is now RJR.  And what
24      did Robert Heimann say?
25           Robert Heimann said:  "We spend all this

1      money, millions of dollars on advertising our
2      products because we want people to buy them."
3      That's what he said.
4           And he also said:  "We spent all this
5      money, we want people to buy cigarettes, we
6      want them to smoke a lot of cigarettes, and we
7      want them to rely on our advertisements.  We
8      want them to rely on our advertisements."
9           And that's what David Ellsworth did.  He
10      did everything R.J. Reynolds asked him to do.
11      He saw these ads on television.  He saw these
12      ads that were pitched by famous actors and
13      actresses.  He saw these ads that were pitched
14      by athletes that people looked up to.
15           He was exposed to all of this information,
16      and he did everything that R.J. Reynolds wanted
17      him to do.  He started smoking young, he smoked
18      a lot, and he smoked for a long time.  And you
19      know what they want?  You know what R.J.
20      Reynolds wants right now?  They want to be able
21      to come up here and say:  Ladies and gentlemen,
22      David Ellsworth did everything we wanted him to
23      do, but he should have known we were lying.  He
24      trusted us.  It's too late for that.
25           It's too late, at this juncture, to say

1      that to you.  Because at the time they were
2      feeding him this information, they wanted him
3      to trust in what they were saying.
4           Only now they want you to believe that
5      David Ellsworth should have known better as a
6      kid and not believe what he saw because they
7      were -- because the tobacco companies were
8      lying to him.
9           And so even when David Ellsworth, at some
10      point had to find out that cigarettes were
11      dangerous, well, herein lies the problem.
12      David Ellsworth was addicted, David Ellsworth's
13      brain had changed, David Ellsworth couldn't
14      stop smoking, David Ellsworth was compelled to
15      smoke.
16           And we know since 1980, that the tobacco
17      industry, including R.J. Reynolds, knew that
18      the entire matter of addiction is the most
19      potent weapon a prosecuting attorney could have
20      in a lung cancer cigarette case.  Why?  Because
21      they knew it then and they know it now, we
22      can't defend continued smoking as free choice
23      if the person was addicted.  Pretty powerful in
24      1980.
25           So not only did David Ellsworth rely on

1      what you saw, not only did he get the message,
2      but by the time he might have found out the
3      truth, he was addicted, and you can't defend
4      free choice when a person is addicted.  He was
5      addicted and couldn't trust them.
6           So the question you have to ask is: What
7      happens if the tables were turned?  What
8      happens if this climate of normalcy didn't
9      exist back then?  What happens if cigarettes
10      weren't normal behavior when David Ellsworth
11      was a kid?  What happens if the cigarette
12      companies, like R.J. Reynolds, had provided
13      what they knew about their products back then
14      when David Ellsworth was a kid?  What happens
15      if they were honest with the public when David
16      Ellsworth was a kid?  What happens if there
17      were restrictions on smoking when David
18      Ellsworth was a kid, because it was known at
19      that time that smoking was dangerous?  What
20      happens if parents were more vigilant because
21      they knew about the dangers because RJR was
22      honest back then?  What would happen if
23      teachers were more vigilant because they knew
24      about the dangers of smoking because RJR was
25      honest back then?

1           The question is:  If all of these things
2      were going on back then, would this kid have
3      started smoking, and with his intelligence?
4      You know the answer is no.  Everyone says he's
5      smart.  He didn't have that back then.  He
6      didn't have that back then because RJR was not
7      being honest with him.
8           That's what reliance is.  That's all you
9      have to do is reliance.  If the tables were
10      turned and this information was out there,
11      would the man -- would the kid have smoked?
12           And it's the same exact thing with the
13      conspiracy.  So the first question is -- that
14      just goes to the reliability of R.J.
15      Reynolds -- Did David Ellsworth reasonably
16      rely, to his detriment, on any statement made
17      by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which
18      concealed or omitted material facts not
19      otherwise know or available to him concerning
20      the health effects or addictive nature of
21      smoking cigarettes; and, if so, was such
22      reliance a legal cause of his death?
23           And we know in the '50s and '40s when
24      David Ellsworth was a kid, and if he was
25      exposed to these TV ads and if he was exposed

1      to these ads that were on the radio, with these
2      beautiful, famous people pitching R.J. Reynolds
3      products, beautiful women and athletes pitching
4      these products that are somehow safe and good
5      and beneficial, and all the time making these
6      representations about their product, you never
7      heard them during that time say:  By the way,
8      these are going to kill you.  By the way,
9      you're going to get addicted and not stop.
10           That's the information they weren't
11      telling him back then.  So that he did rely to
12      his detriment because he became addicted and he
13      died.
14           It is the same exact information with the
15      conspiracy, except the difference is, it's not
16      just R.J. Reynolds, it's R.J. Reynolds and all
17      the other tobacco companies that joined
18      together on December 14th, 1953, at The Plaza
19      Hotel, and they decided:  We're not going to
20      tell the truth to the public, we're going to
21      create doubt for the next 50 years so that all
22      these consumers, like David Ellsworth, will
23      continue to smoke our products.  And it's the
24      same reliance, it's the same argument, and it's
25      the same but-for.

1           If only on December 14th, 1953, the
2      cigarette companies had decided, it might hurt
3      our business, but we have to be truthful with
4      our consumers and our shareholders, it might
5      hurt our bottom dollar, it might hurt our
6      profit, but it might save lives, maybe we just
7      wouldn't be here today.  That's what reliance
8      is.  So on that question on the conspiracy,
9      yes.  Individually?  Yes.
10           Next we talk about comparative fault.  Who
11      is to blame in this case?  Does David Ellsworth
12      have fault?  Does R.J. Reynolds have fault?
13      That's what we have to decide.
14           And we're going to start with December 14
15      of 1953, because that's when the tobacco
16      companies, including R.J. Reynolds, got
17      together and they made a decision what they
18      were going to do in response to all of this
19      negative information about cigarettes, about
20      this health scare, as they call it.
21           You heard Dr. Proctor talk about this,
22      this was The Frank Statement to Smokers,
23      January of 1954 -- can everyone see that?
24           And this was what they shared with the
25      public in every major newspaper in the country,

1      and they made promises to the public what they
2      were going to do in response to this health
3      scare that were alarming people, because at
4      this time, cigarette sales were dropping.
5      People, all of a sudden, weren't buying
6      cigarettes with the same frequency they were
7      before this health scare, because there was
8      information out in the public about the dangers
9      of cigarettes.
10           And, perhaps, if the cigarette companies,
11      including R.J. Reynolds, had acted differently,
12      enough people would have known early on instead
13      of the '70s and '80s and '90s when it was too
14      late.
15           And so what were some of the promises that
16      R.J. Reynolds made with the other tobacco
17      companies?
18           Well, one was that we accept an interest
19      in people's health as a basic responsibility
20      paramount to every other consideration in our
21      business.  That was a big promise they made to
22      a lot of people.  That due to this health
23      scare, we are very interested in your health,
24      and we're going to do everything we can to make
25      sure we get to the bottom of this problem.

1      That was a promise they made publicly.
2           Now, at that time, we didn't have the
3      benefit of their internal confidential
4      documents, no one did except for them.  Those
5      confidential documents were secret and no one
6      knew then, no one knew in the '60s, no one knew
7      in the '70s, no one knew in the '80s, no one
8      knew until the '90s what exactly they did, what
9      exactly the tobacco companies knew.
10           So let's just see how this they accepted
11      an interest in people's health from 1953 on.
12           In 1953, December, there was a forwarding
13      memo that resulted from this meeting, and what
14      do we know from that forwarding memo?  That the
15      tobacco companies, including R.J. Reynolds,
16      knew that their products were dangerous, and
17      they knew that they were addictive, because the
18      research directors made comments that were
19      recorded.  And what were these comments?
20      Fortunate for us -- not sadly, fortunate --
21      fortunate for us, cigarettes are a habit they
22      can't break.
23           They accepted an interest in people's
24      health.  They know that their products are
25      addictive, that cigarettes are a habit they

1      can't break.  Boy, wouldn't it be wonderful if
2      our company was the first to produce a
3      cancer-free cigarette?  Not only in '53 did
4      they know that their product caused cancer,
5      that it was addictive, but they were happy
6      about it.  And how were they going to show an
7      interest in people's health when they knew this
8      information?  By not telling anybody, by
9      keeping it to themselves.  That was in 1953.
10           We move on to 1964 when the Surgeon
11      General's Report came out, when the Surgeon
12      General's Report was going to come out and the
13      tobacco companies had wind of it, what did
14      Philip Morris do?  All their concern was for
15      the public's health was:  We've got to give
16      smokers a psychological crutch to continue
17      smoking cigarettes.  That was the interest they
18      had in people's health.
19           In 1972, Claude Teague, The Roper
20      Proposal -- this was a Tobacco Institute memo,
21      not Claude Teague -- this is almost 20 years
22      after they began this campaign of doubt,
23      promising they accepted an interest in people's
24      health.
25           What did they say?  Their strategy was

1      brilliantly conceived and executed, and what
2      did it consist of?  Creating doubt about the
3      health charge.  That was the interest that they
4      promised that they were going to take in
5      people's health.
6           But there's more.  We move on.  They
7      promised:  We accept an interest in people's
8      health.  And yet they knew, in 1972, that their
9      product was just a dosage of nicotine.  They
10      were in the business of selling nicotine.  And
11      they accepted that and they knew that.  And
12      their accepting an interest in people's health
13      consisted in the fact that they not only knew
14      that their product was addictive, they not only
15      knew it but RJR was happy, they were downright
16      happy that their product was habituating and
17      unique.  And they were happy because they were
18      going to get a lot of smokers who were not
19      going to be able to quit smoking their product
20      and would be smoking their product for a long
21      time; and when they die, they would be replaced
22      by younger smokers.  That's the interest they
23      showed in the public.
24           So they knew in 1972, 20 years after this
25      conspiracy on which they entered that their

1      product was addictive, they accepted an
2      interest in people's health, according to their
3      credo, and they didn't tell a soul.
4           They accepted an interest in people's
5      health, and in 1982, they realized many but not
6      most of those who would like to stop smoking
7      are unable to do so.  Most people they knew
8      couldn't stop smoking, couldn't stop smoking.
9           And they also said, if people started to
10      be able to quit, they'd go out of business,
11      because people smoke cigarettes for nicotine.
12      And they were worried because they were all of
13      a sudden getting wind that there was
14      development of these new techniques to help
15      people stop smoking their products.
16           And what did they say?  If somehow this
17      happens, what can happen?  We might go out of
18      business, because people smoke for nicotine,
19      despite what the defense expert on addiction
20      said.  And what else?  They would have to find
21      a way to eliminate the desire for smokers to
22      stop smoking.  They want smokers to keep
23      smoking their product.  They accepted an
24      interest in people's health in 1953, and this
25      is what they were saying in 1982.

1           And Robert Heimann.  You saw Robert
2      Heimann during his video deposition from
3      December 19th of 1986.  And what did he say:
4      Congress is wrong in requiring these warnings.
5      Is that correct?  We don't think they are
6      justified.
7           Now this is the president, chief executive
8      of American Tobacco Company, which became R.J.
9      Reynolds Tobacco Company, and to show they're
10      accepting an interest in people's health, when
11      he's asked about the warnings on the
12      cigarettes, he says they're not justified.
13      That's how much they had an interest in
14      people's health.
15           Secondly, the promise that they made, are
16      the credo statement that we included in the
17      Frank Statement was:  "We believe the products
18      we make are not injurious to health."
19           They were telling the public, have no
20      fear, we don't think our products are
21      dangerous.  You could rely on us.
22           Well, was that the truth?  We know that's
23      not.  1953, before this meeting at The Plaza
24      Hotel, Claude Teague, the research chemist at
25      RJR, did a survey of all this cancer research,

1      and what did he conclude in his paper?  Studies
2      of clinical data tend to confirm the
3      relationship between heavy and prolonged
4      tobacco smoke and incidence.  And they knew it.
5      And yet, what did they say to the public?  We
6      believe the products we make are not injurious
7      to health.  They lied.
8           Here is the forwarding memo again.  Not
9      only were they aware that this was bad, that it
10      could cause cancer, but they were joking,
11      wouldn't it be -- boy, wouldn't it be wonderful
12      if we made a cancer-free cigarette?  Of course
13      we're not going to tell the public right now.
14      And they didn't.  It's fortunate for us,
15      cigarettes are a habit they can't break.
16           And here's something else in the
17      forwarding memo, knowing full well the dangers
18      of their product, and denying that their
19      products were not -- that don't cause health
20      problems, what they wanted to do, most
21      important, how to free millions of Americans
22      from the guilty fear that is going to arise
23      deep in their biological depths regardless of
24      any pooh-poohing logic every time they light a
25      cigarette.

1           So their interest was not on health, their
2      interest was not on safety, their interest was
3      to how to convince the public to don't fear any
4      health consequences from smoking our product.
5           And they also acknowledged, in 1963,
6      internally, secretly, confidentially that they
7      know their product is addictive, and they know
8      they're in the business of selling nicotine,
9      and that's why they made cigarettes, and that's
10      why cigarettes were popular.
11           And that's why we know they were lying to
12      the public when they said we believe the
13      products we make are not injurious to health.
14      And we talk about fault here.  You get the
15      impression that this isn't David Ellsworth's
16      fault.  This isn't the man's fault.
17           This is R.J. Reynold's conduct, and
18      you-all promised me early on in jury selection,
19      you would not only consider the choices that
20      David Ellsworth made, you would consider the
21      choices that R.J. Reynolds made.  These are
22      some of the choices that we're considering
23      right now.
24           Another example, 1972.  Again, without
25      nicotine, no one is going to smoke.  No one has

1      ever become a cigarette smoker by smoking
2      cigarettes without nicotine.  I mean, why on
3      earth would someone smoke if they didn't get
4      the nicotine?  They wouldn't get the feel-good
5      effect.  They wouldn't get the satisfaction.
6      They wouldn't be addicted.
7           What do they think about their cigarettes?
8      What did R.J. Reynolds think of their
9      cigarettes?  That it was a supply of nicotine,
10      that it was a dispenser for a dose unit of
11      nicotine.  That's all they thought.  To the
12      detriment of the public, including David
13      Ellsworth when they said:  These products
14      aren't harmful, they're not harmful, folks,
15      trust us.
16           Only now, they want you to think, David,
17      you shouldn't have trusted us, you knew we were
18      lying then.
19           Very few consumers -- they knew in 1978 --
20      very few consumers are aware of the effects of
21      nicotine, its addictive nature that nicotine is
22      a poison, it's a poison and yet their public
23      stance was:  They're not injurious to health.
24           And Dr. O'Brien, even he said, when he got
25      involved in researching nicotine, it wasn't

1      until late, because no one knew about it.  It
2      was in the '70s, the '80s, that's when he got
3      involved.  He was involved in heroin and
4      cocaine abuse, but nicotine became an interest
5      of his in the '70s and the '80s, just like the
6      memo said, people aren't aware, if they were
7      aware, maybe they would try to quit or maybe
8      they wouldn't start.
9           What else did they promise in The Frank
10      Statement?  We always have and always will
11      cooperate closely with those whose task it is
12      to safeguard the public health.
13           I mean, how else to ensure confidence from
14      the public by promising these things?  We are
15      going to cooperate fully with anyone whose task
16      it is to safeguard the public health.  That is
17      a promise they made.  Wouldn't the public feel
18      comfortable with that promise?
19           And so what does the evidence show in this
20      case?
21           Number one, it showed in 1964, when they
22      didn't cooperate with the Surgeon General's
23      Report, they ridiculed it.  That was in 1964.
24           In 1972, when the Surgeon General's Report
25      was issued, they ridiculed it.

1           Now, publicly they were going to
2      cooperate, and yet they ridiculed it.
3           Robert Heimann testified:  What do you
4      think of the '64 report?  You, being his
5      company.
6           I would use the term misguided.
7           And if he was misguided, then I take it
8      that your opinion is that he is wrong?  Talking
9      about the Surgeon General.
10           I was simply trying to be polite about it.
11           All right.  But not being polite about it,
12      in your opinion, is he wrong?
13           Dead wrong.
14           That's what Mr. Heimann said, "Dead
15      wrong."  And yet they promised the public, and
16      David Ellsworth, we are going to cooperate
17      closely with those whose task it is to
18      safeguard the public health.
19           What else did they promise in The Frank
20      Statement?  They were going to hire the most
21      reputable scientists, they were going to grant
22      money, they were going to do research, they
23      were going to hire the best and the brightest,
24      and they were going to create this research
25      committee called the TIRC, The Tobacco Industry

1      Research Committee.  And, folks, they were
2      going to get to the bottom of the problem.
3      That's what they told the public in their Frank
4      Statement.  They were going to do research;
5      they've got this committee that they're going
6      to employ with the best scientists.
7           And what did they do?  We know what they
8      did.  In 1963, Brown & Williamson, which is RJR
9      now, the TIRC cannot, in my opinion, provide
10      the vehicle for such research.  It was
11      conceived as a public relations gesture.  It
12      has functioned as a public relations operation.
13           The promise they made was:  We're going to
14      get to the bottom of this with the best
15      research scientists that we have; and, yet,
16      they were nothing more than a public relations
17      gimmick.
18           1978, 25 years later, what do we learn
19      from The Council for Tobacco Research meeting,
20      which was just the same as The Tobacco
21      Institute Industry Research Committee?  The
22      TIRC was set up as an industry shield in 1954.
23      They knew it well back in '63, they knew it 25
24      years later, and yet they assured the public
25      that they were going to hire all of these

1      people to do research, all of these reputable
2      scientists to do research.  And like
3      Dr. Proctor said, they did do research.  There
4      was billions of dollars spent on research,
5      except it had nothing to do with smoking and
6      health.
7           And to the extent that some of these
8      research projects did concern smoking and
9      health, Dr. Proctor referred to that as nothing
10      more than a leakage.  And those institutions
11      wouldn't get grants anymore, those institutions
12      wouldn't get grants anymore, those colleges
13      wouldn't get grants anymore.  Do you remember
14      that?  That was the end of them for doing
15      something like leaking information that might
16      be truthful to the public.
17           And, finally, what did they promise?  This
18      statement, this Frank Statement to Smokers is
19      being issued because we believe that people are
20      entitled to know where we stand on this matter
21      and what we intend to do about it.  They wanted
22      the people to be assured, Look, we're not going
23      to lead you astray, we're going to tell you
24      exactly what we believe and where we stand on
25      this matter of your safety and of your health.

1           And what do we know?  We know that they
2      knew their product was dangerous, they knew
3      that they were selling nicotine, we know that
4      they were aware that consumers who were using
5      their products weren't aware of the effects of
6      nicotine.  And we also knew from Robert
7      Heimann:  Would you blame a person for smoking
8      two packs a day?  Would you?
9           No.
10           You wouldn't fault it for smoking one pack
11      or two packs; is that correct?
12           I think so.
13           And that's what they're going to do.  They
14      want people to know where they stand.  Well, we
15      know where the American Tobacco Company and
16      R.J. Reynolds stood.  We want people to smoke a
17      lot of cigarettes; we want people to smoke two
18      packs a day; we want people to smoke as much as
19      they want to smoke, because we're not going to
20      tell them the truth.
21           And, finally, 1994, 1994, at a time when
22      David Ellsworth is dying of cancer
23      Representative Waxman is convening hearings,
24      and under oath, each of the major executives of
25      the tobacco companies, including RJR, swore,

1      no, our products don't cause cancer.  No, we
2      don't believe our products are addictive.
3           1994 they're still saying this.  And it
4      wasn't until 2000 that they finally admitted
5      the truth.
6           So we talk about fault.  We talk about
7      fault.  Where in here is David Ellsworth's
8      fault?  Where in here did David Ellsworth do
9      anything?
10           I've got some examples that I want to
11      share with you that we will talk about.  Let's
12      talk about fault more, let's ask some
13      questions, because the defendants are going to
14      have a chance to talk to you --
15           MR. PERSONS:  Your Honor, before he moves
16      into this next argument --
17           THE COURT:  I'm sorry?
18           MR. PERSONS:  Before opposing counsel
19      moves into this next argument, I would like to
20      make an objection.
21           THE COURT:  Okay.  Let's go sidebar.
22           (Thereupon, the following proceedings were
23 held at side bar:)
24           THE COURT:  I believe this is the chart
25      that we talked about.

1           MR. PERSONS:  That's right, the fault
2      chart, and I just wanted to renew that
3      objection and ask for a continuing objection so
4      I don't have to keep doing this.
5           THE COURT:  That's great.  You can do
6      that.
7           And you started about 10 after 11, I
8      think, so as soon as you're done, I think we
9      should take a lunch break, and -- and you come
10      back and you give yours, and your rebuttal
11      closing.
12           (Thereupon, the sidebar was concluded and the
13 following proceedings were held in open court:)
14           MR. KAISER:  So the defense is going to
15      have an opportunity to talk to you, and I'm
16      going to pose some questions because you're
17      going to have to listen intently to see how
18      they're going to respond to these questions.
19      And you know what?  They won't.  They will not.
20      You know why?  They don't want to talk about
21      their conduct.  They haven't in this case once,
22      have they?
23           They've made this case into a David
24      Ellsworth case, for one reason, because if they
25      talk about this conduct, it's not going to be

1      good, and they won't do it.  They won't do it.
2      Mark my word.  Every one of these questions,
3      wait for their response, wait for their
4      answers, see if you get one.  And if you don't
5      get one, you know what that means?  That's
6      fault.  They can't talk about it.  They can't
7      talk about their fault.  They want to talk
8      about Mr. Ellsworth.  He didn't quit.  Quit is
9      just simple.  He just didn't throw his
10      cigarette packs away.  He didn't throw his
11      ashtrays away.  He didn't want to quit.  He
12      enjoyed smoking with coffee, he enjoyed smoking
13      while drinking, he enjoyed smoking while
14      eating, he enjoyed smoking doing every activity
15      he was going to engage in because the man
16      smoked a lot of cigarettes.
17           When R.J. Reynolds knew of the dangers of
18      smoking in the '50s, like I've shown you, by
19      1953 they knew.  They had a choice and the
20      question is:  Why did you choose not to tell
21      the public?  Why?
22           See what they tell you when they get up
23      here and tell you why they didn't.  And write
24      in your notes when they don't tell you why
25      they're admitting fault.

1           Now, when they didn't tell David Ellsworth
2      or anybody else about the dangers of their
3      products, when they knew it, is David Ellsworth
4      at fault?  Certainly not.  It's like the car
5      analogy, that car hypothetical.  When the
6      seller sells that defective car, they don't
7      tell you about it, is it the buyer's fault?  Of
8      course not.
9           But in this case it's different, because
10      at some point, I'm not going to deny it, David
11      Ellsworth had to have learned that the product
12      he was smoking was dangerous, but the problem
13      was, it was too late.  The man's brain had
14      changed.  He had millions of memories in his
15      brain by no fault of his own.  We can't hold
16      him at fault for that.  The evidence won't let
17      you.
18           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
19           THE COURT:  Grounds?
20           MR. PERSONS:  Objection to that argument.
21           THE COURT:  Okay.
22           (Thereupon, the following proceedings were
23 held at side bar:)
24           MR. PERSONS:  Here what we have now is
25      he's going beyond the realm of what the Court

1      said that it would permit him to do when we
2      raised these arguments this morning.  The Court
3      said, well, you can use that but you've got to
4      offer some explanation, put it in context; and
5      now he's saying that each of these, if we don't
6      respond to them, then that's an admission of
7      fault.  That's out of bounds.  That gets into
8      the realm of calling into question the way we
9      are defending our case, and that is
10      impermissible.
11           MR. KAISER:  I was commenting on the
12      evidence.  They're not going to be able to
13      respond to the evidence.
14           THE COURT:  Okay, that objection is
15      overruled, but it's noted for the record.
16      Thank you.
17           (Thereupon, the sidebar was concluded and the
18 following proceedings were held in open court:)
19           MR. KAISER:  Question Number 1.
20           Question Number 2:  When R.J. Reynolds
21      knew of the addictive nature of smoking in the
22      1950s, and we know they did, why didn't they
23      tell the public?  Why did they choose not to,
24      and is that David Ellsworth's fault, for their
25      negligence?  When they knew it and they didn't

1      tell him, that's their fault, not ours; and I'm
2      telling you, we will not accept responsibility
3      for it.
4           David Ellsworth does not accept
5      responsibility for not having been told in the
6      '50s, when he was a young kid, what R.J.
7      Reynolds knew.
8           Listen to how they address that question,
9      how they answer it.  I bet they won't.
10           Why did R.J. Reynolds choose not to
11      voluntarily warn the public and David Ellsworth
12      about the dangers of smoking with warnings on
13      the packs in the 1950s?  You know, those
14      warnings on the packs, that was mandated by
15      Congress in 1966, not the cigarette companies.
16      Well, in the '50s no one was mandating
17      anything.
18           And you heard Mr. Kreiner yesterday ask
19      his witness, every time that Mr. Ellsworth
20      picked up a pack of cigarettes, he would have
21      seen the warnings or read them.  How many
22      times?  Assuming the man is going to look at
23      the warnings when he picks up a pack of
24      cigarettes, who on earth does?  Well, maybe if
25      the cigarette companies were honest in the

1      '50s, and they voluntarily told people their
2      product was addictive, and put warnings on the
3      packages themselves, David Ellsworth would have
4      been in a position of maybe being able to quit
5      then because maybe his brain wasn't so changed
6      at that time.
7           Maybe he wouldn't have started, maybe he
8      was not a regular smoker, maybe he had the
9      ability then, if he knew the truth, to stop
10      with no difficulty, but he didn't get that
11      chance because they didn't tell him the truth.
12           Why did R.J. Reynolds choose not to
13      voluntarily warn the public about the addictive
14      nature of nicotine with warnings on their packs
15      in the '50s?  Same question.  They knew it, but
16      the answer is clear, they thought first about
17      profit than safety.  That's clear.  That's
18      clear as can be.
19           Is that David Ellsworth's fault that you
20      had a company that was worried more and
21      concerned more about their profit than safety?
22      No.  No.
23           Why did R.J. Reynolds normalize and
24      glamorize its cigarettes in advertising
25      campaigns using famous actors and actresses,

1      athletes during the '30s, '40s and '50s?
2           What do these types of advertising
3      campaigns appeal to?  What do they appeal to?
4      When someone looks at an athlete pitching a
5      cigarette product, when someone looks at a
6      beautiful actress pitching a cigarette product,
7      when someone looks at an actor pitching a
8      cigarette product, when someone looks at a
9      politician pitching a cigarette product, don't
10      you think kids might be vulnerable to that type
11      of advertising, kids like David Ellsworth whose
12      brain hasn't been developed yet?
13           And yet, why did they continue to do that,
14      especially in the '50s when they knew their
15      products were bad?  Why did they continue to
16      pitch their products instead of saying, by the
17      way, these are glamorous but they will kill
18      you, too?
19           And then the onus is on David Ellsworth,
20      but it's not now because they didn't tell him,
21      and we don't take fault or responsibility for
22      their negligence.
23           Why did R.J. Reynolds choose not to
24      voluntarily warn the public about the dangers
25      of their cigarettes in the early '60s before

1      Congress mandated those warnings?  Why didn't
2      they do it then?
3           By the '60s, RJR will tell you, there was
4      more information out to the general public so
5      that everybody would have known.
6           Dr. Proctor didn't tell you that.
7      Remember what Dr. Proctor said?  Look, this
8      took a long time before the public actually
9      knew about the risk of smoking and the
10      addictive nature of smoking.  Even though there
11      was information out there, the tobacco industry
12      responded in kind.  They spent billions of
13      dollars to advertise, they had executives
14      talking on news shows, they had all sorts of
15      these publications, and they had newsletters,
16      they were reaching millions and millions of
17      people with their strategic campaign that began
18      in 1953.
19           So this information might have been out
20      there, but certainly it was overburdened by the
21      information that was being put out there by the
22      tobacco companies in their denialist campaign.
23      And that's why you've got people like Dr.
24      O'Brien saying, people didn't know until the
25      '70s and the '80s.

1           And so maybe if R.J. Reynolds had chosen
2      when they knew their products were dangerous,
3      and in the '60s when they knew even more about
4      their products, maybe David Ellsworth would
5      have been young enough to be able to quit then,
6      but he didn't get the chance.
7           The same thing on addiction.  Why didn't
8      they -- why did RJR, when they made their
9      choice, do I tell or do I not tell the public,
10      they chose not to warn the public about their
11      addictive cigarettes.  They didn't voluntarily
12      put warnings on their packs in the early '60s.
13      They had that choice to make, and they didn't
14      make that choice.  And perhaps if David
15      Ellsworth was given that choice back then, to
16      either smoke then or heed the warning in the
17      '60s, he was able to quit because his brain
18      wasn't so changed yet.  But he didn't get that
19      chance; and for that reason, we don't take
20      responsibility for R.J. Reynolds' behavior.
21           Why did R.J. Reynolds choose to conspire
22      with other tobacco companies and create doubt
23      about the health risks of smoking for 50 years,
24      despite knowing its cigarettes were deadly?
25      Why did R.J. Reynolds join these other people

1      instead of saying:  You know what, our
2      responsibility is to tell our shareholders and
3      our consumers about our products.  But they
4      chose not to, and they chose not to for 50
5      years; and now they want to come in here and
6      tell you:  David Ellsworth is to blame because
7      he didn't know -- he didn't believe we were
8      lying back then, he should have known, he
9      trusted us.  It's too late for that.
10           Why did R.J. Reynolds choose not to reduce
11      nicotine amounts in their cigarettes to levels
12      that would not sustain addiction when it had
13      that capability well before David Ellsworth
14      started smoking?  Why didn't they do it?  They
15      had a chance to reduce nicotine so that people
16      could smoke as many cigarettes as they wanted
17      and they wouldn't get addicted, so that the
18      blame would be totally on them if they didn't
19      quit.  Because if they weren't addicted, if
20      there wasn't enough nicotine to cause
21      addiction, they could quit at any time they
22      want.
23           And so knowing that formula, for a long
24      time, before David Ellsworth even started to
25      smoke, they knew it.  That's their fault.

1      That's not ours.
2           And you heard evidence in this case.  They
3      actually tried it later on.  And it was not
4      commercially feasible, because people didn't
5      want to smoke a non-nicotinized cigarette.
6      Well, the problem is they waited so long to do
7      that.  Had they done it in the '40s, had they
8      done it in the '50s when all of these people
9      were starting to smoke, maybe they wouldn't
10      have those numbers of people starting to smoke
11      again.  Therein lies the problem.  And we don't
12      take responsibility for R.J. Reynolds'
13      negligence in not reducing nicotine way back
14      when, when cigarettes were first becoming
15      popular.
16           Why did R.J. Reynolds take this public
17      position about cooperating with public health
18      authorities in 1964 when they knew their
19      products were bad and they didn't share all of
20      the information they could about what they knew
21      with the Surgeon General?  Why didn't they do
22      that?  Just think.  Maybe if they shared all
23      the information they knew in '64, maybe if they
24      shared all the information with public health
25      officials way back when, maybe it would have

1      been a more restrictive environment way back
2      when, so that people couldn't smoke in
3      restaurants, so that people couldn't smoke in
4      public buildings, so that people couldn't smoke
5      on public buses, so that people couldn't smoke
6      in a movie theater, so that people couldn't
7      smoke on airplanes.  Just think, if that had
8      happened back in the '50s or the '60s, there
9      would be a lot of lives that would have been
10      saved.  But that didn't happen because R.J.
11      Reynolds chose, back in the '50s and the '60s,
12      not to cooperate with public health officials.
13           Why did R.J. Reynolds urge people to
14      switch to filtered cigarettes rather than quit
15      smoking when they knew that filters weren't
16      effective, when they knew that in the '50s?
17      And this is another example of how David
18      Ellsworth relied on the information that was
19      being put out there.  Because we know that
20      David Ellsworth smoked Lucky Strike cigarettes
21      that were a nonfiltered cigarette.  And at some
22      point when he switched to Winstons and
23      Viceroys, they were filtered cigarettes.  And
24      we know that the cigarette companies, including
25      R.J. Reynolds, advertised filtered cigarettes

1      as being safer without really telling people it
2      was safe, because they didn't want to admit
3      that they knew their products were dangerous.
4           But they pushed filters.  They pushed
5      filters to such an extent that unfiltered
6      cigarettes were not even part of the market
7      anymore.  Maybe 3 percent of the public were
8      smoking unfiltered cigarettes after a period of
9      time; that's because everybody in their right
10      mind, instead of quitting cigarettes, was
11      buying into this advertising campaign that
12      perhaps you should switch to a filter that
13      takes out all these bad things.
14           And so just think, maybe if they were
15      honest with David Ellsworth back then, and
16      instead of pitching filtered cigarettes that
17      they knew didn't work, they would say:  You'd
18      better think about quitting or smoking
19      responsibly because nothing is going to help.
20           So instead of encouraging people to maybe
21      quit, they put filters on there so that these
22      people, rather than quit, would smoke filters,
23      thinking it was taking the bad stuff out, when
24      R.J. Reynolds knew it was not.
25           If the Tobacco Industry, which was partly

1      funded by R.J. Reynolds, you've heard, if they
2      maintained that since 1980, it cannot argue
3      free choice when the smoker is addicted, then
4      why does David Ellsworth have any fault?
5           Remember, what the defendants want to do
6      with this case, is harp on David Ellsworth not
7      trying hard enough to quit.  They want to
8      concentrate on his quitting behavior.  You need
9      to concentrate on his starting behavior,
10      because if David Ellsworth had been given
11      truthful information before he ever started
12      smoking, or even when he had started, it was
13      early enough to where he could have quit, we
14      wouldn't be here today.  Because if he had quit
15      back then, he would not have had enough toxins
16      in his lungs to get lung cancer.  But that
17      didn't happen.  So the defendants want to harp
18      on this quitting, his quitting behavior.  It's
19      too late to harp on it because they know they
20      can't argue free choice when he was addicted.
21           And so the only possibility of David
22      Ellsworth's fault in this case, ladies and
23      gentlemen, is:  Did he try hard enough to quit?
24      And we know from his daughter Kerri, he told
25      her, he did try, and he was unsuccessful, and

1      he was trying to suck on lollipops and couldn't
2      do it.
3           Now, if he didn't try 10,000 times, does
4      that make it his fault?  If this man tried
5      twice and he was not successful, what did Dr.
6      O'Brien say?  He said:  That's evidence to
7      someone -- and Dr. O'Brien, in his mind, he
8      said when someone knows that they have to quit
9      for some reason and they make a concerted
10      effort to try and quit for some reason, and
11      they're unsuccessful in quitting, they're
12      addicted and they couldn't quit.
13           And like Dr. O'Brien said, "This man
14      probably couldn't quit because of his
15      addiction."
16           So what do we do about fault?
17           THE CLERK:  One hour lapsed, counsel.
18           MR. KAISER:  I submit to you, ladies and
19      gentlemen, that the fault in this case, the
20      brunt of the fault in this case, the totality
21      of the fault in this case, is on R.J. Reynolds,
22      because of his conduct that we've talked.
23           About.  If they had been truthful in the
24      '50s, if they had been truthful in the '60s,
25      perhaps David Ellsworth's life would have been

1      saved, but it wasn't.  And for that, we do not
2      accept responsibility.  And so when you are
3      asked to apportion fault in this case, and
4      you're asked:  Please state the percentage of
5      any fault that was a legal cause of David
6      Ellsworth's death that you charge to David
7      Ellsworth?  Respectfully, based on the evidence
8      in this case, zero.  Zero.  And R.J. Reynolds,
9      because of the evidence in this case,
10      100 percent.  Because if they had acted earlier
11      and responsible, we wouldn't be here today.
12           But they did what they wanted to do and
13      David Ellsworth bought into everything they
14      wanted to do, and he smoked their cigarettes
15      and he smoked them for a long time, and he
16      smoked them hard, and he got addicted and
17      couldn't quit.  That's why they're responsible
18      and David Ellsworth is not.
19           Now we get to damages.  There are two
20      types of damages in this case.
21           If you find, and we contend that David
22      Ellsworth died from adenocarcinoma and squamous
23      carcinoma, and you find that we've met our
24      burden, by the greater weight of the evidence,
25      that Kerri Ellsworth is entitled to recover for

1      the loss of support and services from her
2      father.
3           You heard the testimony of Dr. Raffa, and
4      he talked about this amount of support and
5      services.  And you heard the testimony of
6      Kerri, and you heard the testimony of others,
7      and what did Dr. Raffa tell you?
8           Dr. Raffa computed this on a conservative
9      basis, and he came up to this figure of
10      $1,299,461.  That's for the loss of support and
11      services.
12           The loss of support is not very much,
13      because he was only able to obtain certain
14      Social Security information, and David
15      Ellsworth did not have that much reportable
16      income.  That's why that number is low.
17           The services for the period of the
18      expected lifetime of David Ellsworth, if he
19      hadn't died, amounts to $1,254,376.
20           And remember Dr. Raffa, the way he did it,
21      he did it in a conservative fashion by getting
22      the market value for the type of care that
23      someone with cerebral palsy would need.  That
24      doesn't mean that you have to accept this
25      figure.  You can go higher.  And the reason you

1      can is because you can consider the
2      relationship that --
3           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.  May
4      we have a sidebar?
5           THE COURT:  Sure.
6           (Thereupon, the following proceedings were
7 held at side bar:)
8           MR. PERSONS:  On economic damages, unlike
9      noneconomic damages, you cannot go high up.
10      That's the number he's put out there and that's
11      the number plaintiff is going to have to live
12      with.
13           MR. KAISER:  Well, Dr. Raffa testified it
14      was a conservative estimate and because the
15      relationship between Kerri and her father is
16      relevant, they might very well say we want to
17      go higher.
18           THE COURT:  Okay, but I would ask you to
19      clarify that for the jury, it has to be based
20      on the evidence, and if they agree or accept
21      his representation that it's conservative, then
22      that sort of thing, but that is to be based on
23      the evidence.
24           MR. PERSONS:  Well, based on that, I move
25      for a mistrial.

1           THE COURT:  Based on what?
2           MR. PERSONS:  Based on that statement that
3      he made that they must -- they can go higher.
4      I don't know that you can cure that.
5           THE COURT:  Okay.  He can and he will.
6      But thank you.  It's overruled.  Denied.
7           (Thereupon, the sidebar was concluded and the
8 following proceedings were held in open court:)
9           MR. KAISER:  Why do I say he can go
10      higher?  Because one thing you can do here is
11      you can consider the relationship that Kerri
12      had with her father.
13           And remember the testimony of Dr. Raffa,
14      this was a conservative approach, conservative.
15      And who on earth would have the relationship
16      that Kerri had with her father?
17           Remember the evidence, the testimony you
18      heard?  This was the father who wanted to make
19      sure that his daughter, despite having these
20      infirmities from her cerebral palsy, was
21      treated like a normal kid, like she didn't have
22      any disability.  He made sure that's the way he
23      treated her.  And that's why you heard evidence
24      that he would take her camping and he would
25      take her fishing and he would treat her as any

1      normal part of the family, just like any other
2      normal kid.  And he taught her how to bowl.
3      And all of these things for his daughter that
4      he loved, and even Kerri said, that was my
5      primary caregiver.  That was my father who at a
6      very young age cut the tips out of my shoes
7      because those braces hurt.  And that's her
8      first memory of her caregiver, her father,
9      cutting the toes out because it hurt her at two
10      years old, or three years old, when she had to
11      wear those heavy braces that were painful.
12      That's her recollection.
13           And she talked about all of these things
14      that she would do with her father trying to
15      make her normal.  And she tried -- she talked
16      about the fact that she was able to confide in
17      him, even more so than she was with her mother.
18           Like she said, I could tell him anything.
19      I could talk to him about anything, and she
20      did.
21           And so when you look at this conservative
22      number that Dr. Raffa testified about, consider
23      also, based on the evidence, the relationship
24      aspect and you might decide that, no, Dr. Raffa
25      was too conservative, we want to go higher.

1           Now, this is on damages for support and
2      services if you find, in this case, that David
3      Ellsworth died from adenocarcinoma and squamous
4      cell carcinoma.  There is an alternative.
5           If you have any qualms in this case, if
6      you think, you know what, maybe he did have a
7      BAC.  The inquiry doesn't end.  There's an
8      alternative damages here.
9           If you are confused for a minute, if you
10      are uncertain for a minute about his cause of
11      death.  If you think there was a BAC, well
12      don't even worry any further than that, because
13      you're entitled then to consider the
14      survivorship claim in this case.
15           And that is, David Ellsworth's survivors,
16      David Ellsworth's pain and suffering while he
17      was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma and
18      while he suffered with squamous cell carcinoma.
19      And you're entitled to consider that.
20           And you remember the evidence in this
21      case.  First of all of, there's no dispute,
22      this is a certainty, David Ellsworth had
23      squamous cell carcinoma.
24           It is a certainty that this was an
25      aggressive cancer.  This was in his ribs.  This

1      was in his chest wall.  This is what was
2      causing his pain that prompted him to finally
3      go see a physician, because he was also
4      coughing up blood.  And Dr. Cerfolio said, "The
5      coughing up blood was because this was an
6      aggressive tumor that invaded his artery."
7           Now, the pathologist used that word, not
8      me.  The pathologist didn't use the word enter,
9      the pathologist said, "This cancer invaded a
10      major artery."
11           Not like Dr. Okun said, "Well, it didn't
12      go around, it grew inside and clotted."  No.
13      This was an invasion, like a war, it invaded an
14      artery.
15           Dr. Okun said, "One of the ways that
16      cancer spreads from one place in the body to
17      another is via vascular invasion, blood vessel
18      invasion"; and that's what this was called --
19      even Dr. Okun admitted -- this was called a
20      "vascular invasion."  It invaded this major
21      artery.
22           It caused this man to be coughing up
23      blood, it caused this man to have terrible
24      pain, it caused this man to go to a doctor and
25      he was finally diagnosed with cancer.  And he

1      was diagnosed with squamous cell cancer and he
2      suffered.  And he suffered miserably.  Only he
3      knows how bad he suffered, but he did.
4           And you heard from family members.  You
5      heard this debilitating cancer.  You heard from
6      Dr. Cerfolio what this does to you.  It took
7      this strapping, 180-pound man and took him down
8      to nothing, to 140-pounds so that when his son,
9      Rickey Mayou came to see him, who hadn't seen
10      him in ten years, he couldn't believe what his
11      father looked like.  He had shrunk into
12      nothing.  This is this horrible disease
13      process.  This man couldn't eat, this man
14      couldn't lay down, this man had to sleep
15      sitting up in a chair.  This is how he spent
16      the last 13 months of his life, in constant
17      pain.
18           And you can look at the medical records
19      and see, even the pain pills weren't helping
20      this man.  He was taking different kinds of
21      pain pills and it didn't help.
22           And Dr. Cerfolio explained to you, when
23      they went in there and they took his ribs out,
24      to try and get this cancer, that is one of the
25      most painful operations that a person could

1      endure.  And he explained, they go in there and
2      they take this huge tool and they chop his
3      ribs.  And they chop these ribs to take them
4      out and he had to recover from that.  And he
5      said that is extremely painful.
6           And his family members said he didn't
7      recover from that.  And he still had to go
8      through these other tests and having things
9      stuck down his throat and going through
10      radiation, which in and of itself is another
11      problem.
12           So you get it from the evidence, this man
13      suffered quite a bit in 13 months.  So the
14      question then becomes:  How do you quantify
15      that?  How do you put a damage amount on that
16      amount of pain and suffering?
17           And there is a way to do it, and I'm going
18      to suggest a way to do it.  I'm going to
19      suggest a way to do this, and I say suggest
20      because you can do a number of things.  You can
21      say that is a good suggestion and you might go
22      along with it; you can say, no, we have our own
23      method that we're going to employ; or you might
24      do a hybrid and say you will take part of mine
25      and you can do what you want.

1           And my suggestion is this:
2           We live on units of time.  Everything we
3      do in our life is based on time.  David
4      Ellsworth had a certain time that he lived.  We
5      sleep certain hours, seven hours, eight hours,
6      we get up and go to work, six, seven, eight
7      hours.  Everything is done on hours.  Sporting
8      events are done in minutes and hours.  College
9      kids take classes 12 to 15 hours.  Everything
10      we do, that's why we watch -- wear a watch --
11      is based on increments of time.
12           And so one of the things that you can do
13      is equate this suffering on a time component.
14      What does that mean?  People go to their jobs,
15      they get paid by the hour.  Nurses, they go and
16      they take care of people, they get whatever
17      salary they make, they do their job for how
18      many hours it is, they go home.
19           Professors, they teach kids maybe about
20      medicine, they get paid money for doing it,
21      they might enjoy their work.  They do their
22      eight hours, they teach for the nine months
23      that school is in session, and then they go
24      home for three months.
25           Expert witnesses, they testify, they do a

1      job, they come into court, they testify, they
2      do the best they can, they go home.  They
3      testify, they're paid by the hour.
4           Athletes, famous people, they're paid huge
5      sums at an hourly rate.  They do whatever they
6      have to do, and they do it well and then they
7      go home.
8           Well, it's the same thing here, basically.
9      Why do I say that?  Because the evidence here
10      shows that David Ellsworth was given a job.
11      David Ellsworth, because of his smoking R.J.
12      Reynolds cigarettes, was given a job, and that
13      job was to suffer for 13 months before he died.
14      That was his job.  He did not ask for that job,
15      he did not apply for that job, he didn't want
16      that job, but that job was given to him.
17           Would anybody want a job like that?  Of
18      course not.  No one in their right mind would
19      say:  Sure, I will suffer for 13 months with
20      terrible squamous cell cancer.  But that was
21      his lot in life, for 13 months, that was his
22      job because of the cigarettes that he smoked
23      that were manufactured by R.J. Reynolds.
24           The Lucky Strikes, the Winstons, the
25      Viceroys, all caused his squamous cell

1      carcinoma, and he got this job.  That job is
2      not part-time, it was full-time.  That job had
3      no vacations.  That job had no early
4      retirement.  That retirement came when he died.
5      That job had no vacation, that job was 24 hours
6      in the day, he needs to be -- his pain and
7      suffering, the estate needs to be compensated
8      for that.
9           So how do you do it?  You do it the same
10      way you do it for anybody else who has a job in
11      this lifetime; and that is you apply a wage, an
12      hourly wage.  And what do you apply?  And this
13      is my suggestion.  And I'm going to show you,
14      there's low range, a medium range and a high
15      range, and this is what you come out with.
16           For the damages for his pain and suffering
17      and mental anguish.  Below range, take for
18      example what an expert witness might get
19      paid --
20           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
21           (Thereupon, the following proceedings were
22 held at side bar:)
23           MR. PERSONS:  It is improper to do a per
24      diem based on what an expert who has testified
25      in the case charges.  I object.

1           THE COURT:  Where are you going with this,
2      because you didn't finish your sentence?
3           MR. KAISER:  A per diem argument where I
4      am going to suggest a wage that they could
5      imply and that's damage figures.
6           THE COURT:  What's the relationship though
7      to the expert witness?
8           MR. KAISER:  No basis other than pick it
9      out, he makes his money, does his job, well,
10      let's take that.
11           THE COURT:  You're not going to suggest
12      that he should get paid the same amount as an
13      expert witness?
14           MR. KAISER:  You know, I'm objecting to
15      this, I gave counsel my slides at 9 o'clock.
16      He knew it was in there, he flagged me and he
17      waits to sandbag me when I am doing my closing
18      argument, and I object to that.
19           MR. PERSONS:  That's false.  I didn't say
20      anything about it because he did not make any
21      reference to expert witness.  I saw raw
22      numbers.  I didn't have a basis for objection.
23           THE COURT:  Overruled.  Thank you.
24           (Thereupon, the sidebar was concluded and the
25 following proceedings were held in open court:)

1           MR. KAISER:  Like I said before, you are
2      free to do anything you want to this model.
3      You can take a different amount, you can take
4      different hours, you can do whatever you want.
5      I am merely suggesting what I think is a good
6      approach based on the evidence in this case.
7           And what it shows you, ladies and
8      gentlemen, is at a rate of $650 an hour, times
9      24 hours, times 395 days, which is 13 months
10      before he died, it amounts to $6,162,000.
11           I say 24 hours because suffering with
12      squamous cell cancer is a 24-hour-a-day job.
13           The median rate, $750 an hour times 24
14      hours in a day, times the number of days before
15      he died, 395 days, is 7,110,000.
16           And finally, at a higher rate, $850 an
17      hour, times 24 hour, times 395 days, equals
18      $8,058,000.
19           So in total you've got your low range of
20      6,162,000, your midrange at 7,110,000, and your
21      high range of $8,058,000, and that's your
22      damages.  That's compensatory damages.
23           And, finally, before I sit down, there's
24      one other aspect of damages; and that is, the
25      entitlement to punitive damages.

1           Compensatory damages, you are considering
2      the pain and suffering of David Ellsworth.
3           Support and services, you are considering
4      Kerri Ellsworth.
5           Punitive damages, you are not considering
6      the plaintiff, you are considering solely the
7      acts of the defendant.
8           And you have to determine whether or not
9      our evidence, by clear and convincing evidence,
10      supports our entitlement for punitive damages
11      so they can be punished for their actions and
12      to deter future conduct.
13           And I've got examples of what we've proven
14      by clear and convincing evidence that we are
15      entitled to punitive damages in this case.
16           And we've already been over this, so I
17      will be quick.  When R.J. Reynolds knew about
18      the health risks of smoking and cigarettes,
19      they chose not to tell the public.  When they
20      knew it and they made this choice, that's
21      reprehensible.  That was intentional.  That
22      wasn't by accident.  They wanted -- R.J.
23      Reynolds -- they wanted smokers to become
24      addicted to their cigarettes.  You've seen the
25      documents.  They didn't just acknowledge that

1      their product was addictive, they were happy
2      about it.
3           In that Claude Teague document, remember,
4      "Happily for us, it's addictive."  How much
5      care did they have for the public, people like
6      David Ellsworth, in a situation like that?  Is
7      that not a reckless indifference to human life
8      when their attitude is:  We're happy that it's
9      going to addict these people, because they will
10      be smoking our cigarettes for a long time and
11      they will be lining our pockets with money.
12           That's why we're entitled to punitive
13      damages.
14           R.J. Reynolds, they marketed their
15      cigarettes to people in general, but who
16      else -- who else is going to be influenced by
17      these famous people pitching their ads?  Young
18      people.  Young people whose brains haven't
19      developed.  And they know that, they know that
20      young people are going to be impressionable to
21      famous athletes and actors and actresses and
22      politicians; and that's just what they did.
23           When they engaged in a conspiracy to
24      create doubt instead of being honest with the
25      public and not becoming part of this

1      conspiracy.  Instead, for 50 years they
2      participated in this denialist campaign instead
3      of telling the truth with the American public
4      and David Ellsworth.
5           That's another example, by clear and
6      convincing evidence, why we're entitled to
7      punitive damages.
8           R.J. Reynolds lied to the public about the
9      health risks of smoking.  In 1994, in the
10      Waxman committee, they lied about the health
11      risks of smoking.  When they made this promise
12      with The Frank Statement, they lied to the
13      American public in 1953.  That's lying when
14      they knew full well their cigarettes were
15      deadly and they were addictive as well.
16           R.J. Reynolds lied to the public about
17      nicotine not being addictive.  Same time
18      period.  Up to 1994, they didn't admit it until
19      2000.
20           And for that, we should be entitled to
21      punitive damages, because David Ellsworth
22      didn't have the chance to learn about this
23      stuff from R.J. Reynolds, from the people that
24      were selling him the products back in the '50s.
25           Millions of people have been harmed from

1      R.J. Reynolds' intentional acts.  Just think,
2      in the '50s, if they had given David Ellsworth
3      this information that we've talked about
4      already, what could have happened?  But it
5      didn't, because of the indifference they have
6      to the American public, because at the expense
7      of health and safety, they were more interested
8      in their bottom dollar.
9           And that is exactly the last reason.  R.J.
10      Reynolds chose profits over health and safety.
11      And you know that from 1953 forward for the
12      next 50 years where it was more important for
13      them to go on a 50-year public relations
14      campaign instead of a health and safety
15      campaign.
16           And I'm going to wrap it up, ladies and
17      gentlemen, and just ask you one thing:
18      Consider the evidence in this case, if you
19      will.  Please consider the evidence in this
20      case, consider the testimony in this case, and
21      based on that testimony, based on that
22      evidence, we have proven to you by a greater
23      weight of the evidence that R.J. Reynolds is
24      responsible for David Ellsworth's death.
25           And R.J. Reynolds, based on the evidence,

1      needs to compensate the estate and they need to
2      compensate Kerri Ellsworth.
3           I thank you for your time.


MR. KAISER:  Everyone ready?
THE PANEL:  Yes.
MR. KAISER:  Good afternoon.  I will be
brief, and I want to just respond to some of
the issues that were raised.
Number one, I want to mention a couple of
things about this name you keep hearing, Carole
Mayou.  The defense likes to rely on Carole
Mayou.
You've read some of her testimony in this
trial.  And you may recall, Carole Mayou is the
person who recalls listening or hearing
cigarette advertisements on TV in the late 4422
'70s, when they had been banned six or seven
years before from the airways.
This is in her testimony when she was
listening and watching a football game,
remember, and she swore she saw these TV
commercials, but it was about seven years after
they were banned from television.  So that's
the credibility that Ms. Mayou has on which the
defense relies.
Carole Mayou was the only single person
whose testimony in this case revealed that
David Ellsworth smoked Doral cigarettes.
Not one word from anybody else that you
heard in this courtroom or through deposition
testimony that David Ellsworth smoked anything
other than Lucky Strikes, Winstons and Viceroy,
and this woman comes up with Doral and didn't
see him smoke anything else.
The Doral came up because David Ellsworth
worked at the Doral Country Club.  She was
wrong on that.  Doral Country Club, remember
that, he was a landscaper at Doral Country
Club?  The next thing you know, Carole Mayou is
saying I remember he smoked Doral cigarettes,
and I don't remember him smoking anything else. 4423
That's the kind of credibility we're
dealing with, with Ms. Carole Mayou.  Carole
Mayou is the ex-wife of Ricky Mayou.  Carole
Mayou is the ex-wife who doesn't remember when
she was separated.  Carole Mayou is the ex-wife
who doesn't remember when she was divorced.
Carole Mayou is the person who said she saw
David Ellsworth sporadically.  That's the
Carole Mayou that they want you to rely on.
This is the woman who, when we asked her
questions, said, I guess I was just assuming
that David Ellsworth liked smoking, because he
never said it to me.  That's what Carole Mayou
is all about.
Let me say a couple of things on
concealment.  And remember, we don't have to
prove this.  We don't have to prove number four
and five.  This is a given.  This has been
proven.  This has to be accepted once we prove
class membership, which we have.
Defendants concealed or omitted material
information.  They did that.  Not otherwise
known or available.  They did that.  Knowing
that the material was false and misleading or
failed to disclose a material fact concerning 4424
the health effects or addictive nature of
smoking cigarettes or both.
Now, this doesn't matter in the 1980s or
the 1990s.  What's relevant here, folks, is
that the concealment took place in the '50s.
The concealment took place when R.J. Reynolds
was advertising their cigarettes in the '50s,
knowing full well that their products could
kill people, knowing full well that their
products were addictive, and when they were
advertising on the airways with their beautiful
celebrities and their beautiful actors and
actresses and their athletes pitching products
so that young people could see who they idolize
and say, look, this looks good, I'm going to
smoke.
What was the material omission from those
advertisements in the '50s?  This stuff can
kill you.  That's pretty material.
Now, do you think that David Ellsworth
knew, in 1953, that cigarettes could kill him?
Is there any evidence that he knew in 1953 that
cigarettes could kill him?  Absolutely not.
That's the concealment.  And the question
for you, like I mentioned earlier is, if he did 4425
know cigarettes could kill him in 1953, when he
was a kid, if he did know that these are
addictive and if you start, you might not be
able to stop and die, then maybe the shoe would
be on the other foot, and maybe he would have
quit.  That's concealment.
And what the defense wants you to see is
all this information that was out there, what
did I tell you?  They would not talk about
their conduct.
So when RJR doesn't exist, yes, it looks
like there's a lot of information out there,
there's a lot of bad information about
cigarettes, there's a lot of bad information
about addiction.  That came from Dr. Proctor.
He told you about it.
They didn't call a historian.  You didn't
hear anything about their historian.  We called
ours.  And he told you, yeah, there was bad
information, but tobacco responded.  See, they
don't want to talk about their response.  They
can't talk about their response.
Now, what did Dr. Proctor tell you?  Well,
why on earth would there be news coverage of
these important issues in the '60s, in the 4426
'70s, in the '80s?  Because people didn't know.
That's why it's called newspapers and not old
papers, because if it's covered, people don't
know, and they have to learn.  Otherwise, there
would be no use covering information.  If it
was so well-known, it wouldn't be worthy of
press.
That's why Dr. Proctor said, it wasn't a
question that this was common knowledge,
because no one knew until late.  If all this
information was so well-known in the '50s and
'60s, how come Ricky Mayou, in Miami, Florida,
in junior high school, was able to smoke on
school grounds?  Why?  Do you think people
didn't care?  No, people didn't know.
If all this information was out there in
the '50s and the '60s and the '70s, how come
there weren't restrictions on where people
could smoke until the '80s and the '90s?
Because people didn't know.
People weren't complaining.  People didn't
know.  The government didn't act.  It wasn't
until the '80s and the '90s, folks, that you
couldn't fly on an airplane and not smoke,
where you couldn't go into a restaurant, 4427
finally, and smoke a cigarette, couldn't go
into an office building and smoke.  You
couldn't go on public transportation and smoke,
couldn't come into this courtroom and smoke.
It took a long time, because it wasn't
known, and that's the whole idea of
concealment.  And that's all I've got to say
about that.
Addiction, Mr. Persons proved our
addiction for us, and the way he did that was
he read something from one of these leakage
documents that Dr. Proctor talked about, and he
read, "Heavy cigarette smokers are true
addicts."  That's what he read from a long time
ago.
And remember what Dr. O'Brien said?  All
you need to know is how much the man smoked and
how often he smoked, and that's enough, and he
tried and couldn't quit, he's addicted, he's
addicted.  So that answers that question.
Some of the medical issues.  Why do they
quote Dr. Cerfolio and not their own expert?
Why do they quote Dr. Cerfolio and not their
own expert?  
They don't quote Dr. Cerfolio, they don't 4428
quote his testimony because it's going to be
out of context.  Remember what they're saying?
Dr. Cerfolio wouldn't rule out A, B and C.  He
wouldn't rule out.
When Dr. Cerfolio was on the stand,
remember what his answer was to every question
where it was premised with, you can't rule out,
he goes, Counsel, anytime it's prefaced with
rule out, you're right, I can't, I can't rule
out anything.  So when you ask me those
questions, the answer is always no.  That's
what he said.
Now, the defense did not quote any
testimony from Dr. Cerfolio on these risk
factors because it would be taken out of
context, because simply Dr. Cerfolio said,
squamous cell carcinoma is caused by smoking,
end of story.  And he did talk about these risk
factors, but he said, in this case, it didn't
happen.
The best expert in this case, Dr. Okun,
who was called by the defense, he's the one you
need to rely on for these risk factors of dust,
because Dr. -- oh, Dr. Okun didn't say a word.
They didn't ask him any questions about dust, 4429
remember?
They didn't ask Dr. Okun, the defense, one
question about dust.  They didn't ask Dr. Okun,
their expert, one question about TB.  Why
didn't they ask him about that?  He didn't say
one word, because that, ladies and gentlemen,
is what's called a red herring.  That's not an
issue.
If you want to think that David Ellsworth
was up to his eyeballs in dust, go right ahead
and think that, because it didn't have anything
to do with his cancer in this case.
If it did, Dr. Okun would have said, sure,
that probably played a substantial part in this
case.  He wasn't asked, it's not an issue.
TB, Dr. Okun wasn't asked, it's not an
issue.  And if it was an issue, what did
Dr. Cerfolio say?  It's not additive where one
and one is two.  When you've got TB and smoking
and they're both inflammatory responses, it's
one plus one equals eight.  That's called
synergy.
The tobacco and the scarring from the TB
act together, so they both can cause cancer and
they both are substantial causes of cancer. 4430
But, in this case, what did Dr. Cerfolio
say?  Smoking; squamous cell, smoking; squamous
cell, aggressive; squamous cell, deadly; no
BAC; adenocarcinoma; no evolving.  It's a
heterogenous tumor that you're going to see
BAC, you're going to see adeno, you're going to
see squamous.  That's just the nature of the
beast with lung cancer.
So what the defense didn't show you was
the medical record, the pathology.  I did.
Which talked about this was origin of poorly
differentiated cancer, not BAC.
This was anything but a BAC.  This was two
deadly cancers, an adenocarcinoma and a
squamous carcinoma.
And on the issue of fault, remember I said
they would not respond to my questions?  They
can't respond to my questions.  Although they
want to assign 100 percent fault to David
Ellsworth, they can't respond to questions
about their conduct.
The only answer to that, folks, is because
they're at fault 100 percent.
And so I'm going to answer the questions
because Mr. Persons didn't have enough time to 4431
do so.
And so what is the answer?  Why, in the
'50s, when RJR knew that smoking was bad, that
they knew it could kill, they chose not to tell
David Ellsworth and the public?  It's simple.
Because they were more interested in
making money than they were in protecting
people.  They were more interested in their
profits than health and safety.  That's the
reason.
And that's why they can't come up here and
tell you that.  Because it's their fault, not
David Ellsworth's.
And the same thing for number two.  When
they knew it was addictive in the '50s, why
didn't they tell people then?  Then they could
say, you were warned in the '50s.  We put
warnings on our packs in the '50s.  We told you
in our advertisements, when we had these
beautiful actresses pitching our products, and
they said it's going to kill you.  We did
everything we had to do.  But they didn't,
because they didn't want to lose sales.
They didn't care about health and safety.
That's why they didn't tell the public.  And 4432
that's why they didn't want to answer these
questions for you today, because what else can
they say?
Why didn't they warn?  Same reason.  Every
one of these, it's the same answer.  They were
more interested in the bottom dollar.  They
were more interested in their profits than they
were health and safety.
That's why, on December 14th of 1953, when
R.J. Reynolds met with the other tobacco
companies, it was a public relations problem to
deal with and not a health and safety problem,
and that was the issue.
And they decided, we're not going to tell
the public the truth, because we need to make
money.  I mean, how often is it that you get
these fierce competitors in this type of
industry coming together instead of fighting
and competing?  They joined forces in 1953 to
deceive the public for 50 years.
And for that, they should be praised
because now they're good citizens?  Hogwash.
Because they admit their product was
dangerous and deadly in 2000, six years after
David Ellsworth is dead, and now they're good 4433
citizens and shouldn't be published?  Hogwash.
And so when you look at all these
questions, you know what the answer is.  R.J.
Reynolds bears fault.  R.J. Reynolds made a
choice.  And they didn't tell David Ellsworth.
And for that, they are at fault, and we accept
none for that.
They want to dwell on the issue of he
could have quit at any time because he quit in
1993.  Why do you think he quit?  This man had
devastating cancer invading his body.
Now, do you know how he felt?  Does anyone
know how he felt?  Does anyone know whether he
even had the strength to inhale a cigarette at
that time?  And these people are telling you he
quit because he wanted to because of his
cancer, and he was able to quit cold turkey.
He was dying, folks.  He was dying a
miserable, horrible death because of R.J.
Reynolds.  And he quit in '93 and they're
telling you he could have quit at any time.
How does anyone know that?  How does
anyone know if he quit sometime in 1993, he
could have quit the day before?
How could someone tell you if someone quit 4434
in 1993, they could have quit a month before?
How could someone tell you if someone quit in
'93, they could have quit a year before?  No
one can tell you that.
Because he was fortunate enough to be able
to quit when he was dying doesn't mean he could
have quit the day before, a month before, a
year before, a decade before.  And no one could
tell you otherwise.
So, yeah, he quit.  And I'm sure he wanted
to quit before that, because the evidence shows
he tried.  He tried twice at least and couldn't
quit, and we don't know how many more times he
might have tried when he didn't tell anyone and
still couldn't quit.
And so they didn't tell David Ellsworth
this information in the '50s, and if they did,
maybe he wouldn't have been in the position he
was in 1993, and maybe he wouldn't have
started, and maybe if he did, he hadn't been
smoking long enough, so that he could have
quit.
But by the time this information started
coming out in the '70s and '80s and '90s, it
was too late, because he was already addicted. 4435
And it was already too tough for him to even
stop smoking at that point because of that
learned behavior, that reinforcement, those
cures, that involuntary reaction to smoking
that these defense attorneys are telling you he
liked it.
So when you consider all of these examples
of the defendant's fault, you've got to
consider why they didn't answer these
questions.  And you know why, because they
would have to admit they're at fault.
Why didn't they choose to just take their
nicotine out of those cigarettes in the '50s,
in the '40s, in the '30s, so that people could
smoke as much as they want, as long as they
want, and quit when they want?  Because they
wouldn't be addicted.  But they didn't do it
because they know that people smoked for
nicotine, and it's going to affect their bottom
dollar.  That's why they didn't do it.  They
had the wherewithal --
MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.  May
we have a sidebar?
THE COURT:  Sure.
(Discussion sidebar.)  4436
MR. PERSONS:  The basis of the objection,
plaintiff's counsel says that R.J. Reynolds
should have admitted fault.  I mean, that's
tantamount to saying that R.J. Reynolds should
admit responsibility.  That's inappropriate
and, therefore, I move -- I object to it and
move for a mistrial.
THE COURT:  He said they didn't answer
these questions because they would have to
admit they were at fault.
So what is your answer to that?
MR. KAISER:  That's right.  I'm not saying
they need to admit fault.  I'm saying the
evidence is, look at all this stuff, and so
they can't respond because they'd have to admit
they were wrong and at fault.  That's the
truth.
THE COURT:  Objection is overruled.  Just
be careful with your words.
(Sidebar concluded.) 
MR. KAISER:  So that's why they don't
respond to these questions, because it's
simple.  Because these are tough questions to
answer for R.J. Reynolds.  They can't answer
them truthfully without admitting fault. 4437
Remember, this whole idea about filters,
that's another example.  Why mislead people
like David Ellsworth?  When you know your
product is bad and you know filters don't help,
just because they wanted to line their pockets,
now they're saying the filters would take all
this bad stuff out.  Don't quit if you're going
in that direction, smoke our filters.  And
people did and people died.
That's not David Ellsworth's fault.
That's their fault.  David Ellsworth switched
from a non-filtered cigarette to a filtered.
If he enjoyed smoking his Luckies, what would
prompt him to change all of a sudden to a
filtered cigarette?
What would prompt anyone to change?  It
was this marketing effort, where they kept
inundating the people, the public, David
Ellsworth with this safety idea of filtered
cigarettes, and that's why we have 97 percent
of people smoking filters and 3 percent smoking
non-filtered after a number of years, because
of this advertising campaign to get people not
to quit because of this health scare, but to
smoke something that's going to prolong life, 4438
to not kill you, to take all this bad stuff out
when they knew it was just the same as a
non-filtered cigarette.  It didn't filter
anything.  Like Dr. Proctor said, you can't
filter smoke.
So that's another example, and they can't
answer that.  Then, finally, the answer is,
even when the man knew, and at some time, he
had to know, because he tried to quit, he tried
to quit and couldn't.
But the problem is, they can't argue free
choice when he was addicted, and they've known
that since 1980.  So that's the fault.
These people aren't good citizens.  They
weren't good citizens back then, and it doesn't
matter what they've done since 2000.  It
doesn't matter because David Ellsworth died in
1994.  And the whole issue of punishment is you
punish the defendant for their behavior.
You punish them for deterring others in
the future.  They're punished for what they
did.  And they did a lot in this case.  We're
entitled to punitive damages in this case based
on the clear and convincing evidence.
Now, I just want to finish up.  You've got 4439
Dr. Cerfolio saying something.  Dr. Cerfolio's
opinions, you've heard.  You've got Dr. Okun
making his opinion.  Reasonable minds can
differ.
What does it mean?  Maybe it's
qualifications.  Maybe it's the qualifications
that cause people to differ in their opinions.
What do we have here?  Cerfolio, he
specializes in oncology and lung cancer.
Remember he said oncology is cancer.  He treats
cancer.  He operates on cancer.  He takes care
of lung cancer patients.
98 to 99 percent of the patients he treats
have non-small cell lung cancer.  That's why he
was able to talk about that.
He's the chief of thoracic surgery at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham.  He
teaches high school students, medical students,
residents, fellows.  He's a full professor.  He
lectures to medical students.
He's authored 150, more than that, 200
articles, almost all on lung cancer.  Remember
he was telling you, all of his surgeries.  He
does studies.  He writes about them.  BACs,
non-small lung cancer, adenocarcinomas, 4440
squamous cell, he writes.  He publishes.  He's
written 40 to 50 book chapters on lung cancer.
Mostly about non-small lung cancer.
He's an editor of two peer-reviewed
journals.  He lectures at other medical schools
around the world on his specialty.
Remember what else he said he does.  He
does this robotic surgery.  He's pioneered and
approached this robotic surgery to where he
travels all over the world to teach other
surgeons how to do it, and they come to him at
the University of Alabama at Birmingham to
watch him operate using this robotic technique.
He lectures at grand rounds all across the
world to teach other people and to talk about
lung cancer.
He's performed 16,000 operations.
Remember he was saying sometimes he does a
thousand a year.  He's done more than anyone in
the world.
He's seen 33,000 patients.  He's the
endowed chair on lung cancer research.
Research.  That's Robert Cerfolio.  That's his
credentials.
What do we have for David Okun?  He's 4441
never published a peer-reviewed article on BAC
or any other lung cancer, and, yet, he's going
to come up here and explain to you why this
cancer was a BAC.
He's never served as a peer reviewer for
any medical or scientific journals on articles
having to do with BAC or other lung cancer.
He's never lectured at any medical school
on lung cancer.  He's never lectured to any
professional societies on lung cancer.  He
hasn't published any articles in 30 years or
over 30 years.
He's never been a principal investigator
on any clinical studies involving lung cancer.
Dr. Cerfolio said he's a clinical -- he's been
a principal investigator on hundreds of
studies.
He's not been invited by any other med
schools around the country to participate in
grand rounds involving cases dealing with lung
cancer and cancer treatment, and 90 percent of
the cases he treats have nothing to do with
lung cancer.
Because 10 to 12 percent, he says, he's
treated for lung cancer.  That's the extent of 4442
his oncology practice.
So when you weigh their credentials, who
do you believe?  Who's the authority to be able
to come in here and talk to you about non-small
lung cancer and BAC?  And the evidence
overwhelmingly supports it's Robert Cerfolio.
Same with Dr. O'Brien and the defense
expert that they called.
Again, it boils down to credentials.
Because on the one hand, Dr. O'Brien comes up
with an opinion that Mr. Ellsworth is addicted.
On the other hand, the defense expert comes up
with the opposite opinion.  
And, yet, that man says, well, that's my
opinion, and that probably should be the
opinion of every clinician, because I'm right.
That's what he told you.
And so let's look at the credentials and
see who's right.  And we see Dr. O'Brien has
written 520 peer-reviewed articles, mostly
about addiction, 520.  That's a lot of writing.
He's the editor of journals, including a
journal called Addiction.  He lectures
worldwide on addiction.  He created a medical
school course on addiction that's required of 4443
medical students at Penn and elsewhere.
He's an endowed chair in psychiatry at the
University of Pennsylvania.  He's got a
building named after him.  It's the Charles
O'Brien building at the University of
Pennsylvania, bestowed on him in his honor for
his work in addiction.
He's been elected to the Institute of
Medicine of National Academy of Science for his
work on addiction.  He's served on drug abuse
counsel for National Institute of Drug Abuse.
40 years much research he's done, including
nicotine addiction.  
His interest.  He's been a principal
investigator for hundreds of clinical studies
concerning addiction and nicotine addiction, in
particular.
He's been invited to the White House to
consult on substance abuse.  He's been knighted
by the French government with the Chevalier
award on his work on addiction.
He's treated individual patients on his
own since 1971 for things like addiction,
including nicotine.
He was the chair of the Substance Abuse 4444
Disorder Committee for the DSM-5.  He's the man
that helped write the criteria under which they
spoke of yesterday and when he testified.  He
wrote it.
He's written 40 to 50 book chapters on
addiction.  This is the man who you saw
testify.  This is Dr. Charles O'Brien.
Roger Samuel, he has never written a
peer-reviewed article on nicotine addiction or
substance abuse and, in total, has written
three articles in his career.
He has never been Board-certified in
addiction psychiatry.  He has never been a
reviewer on any peer review committee.  He has
never been an editor for any professional
journals.
He has never lectured before any
professional societies on nicotine addiction.
He has never done any research on nicotine
addiction.  He has never been on any committees
for the DSM-5, 4 or 3, like Dr. O'Brien has.
He has never written any criteria for
substance abuse or tobacco use disorder.  He
has never served on any government committees
related to substance abuse. 4445
He has never run any clinical studies on
addiction.  He has never taught a course solely
on substance abuse or addiction.
He has never written any chapters or
textbooks on addiction.  He has seen maybe two
people in the entirety of his career solely for
nicotine addiction.  That is Dr. Samuel's
credentials.
And you know what else you know about
Dr. Samuel, is that Dr. Samuel is paid as an
expert witness, and Dr. Samuel, in his entire
career, in deposition and trial testimony, has
found a total of zero people addicted.  That's
the expert that they called.  He never finds
anyone addicted.
Finally, when you consider the testimony,
consider how he answered questions.  This is a
man who conducts this workshop on cross
examination.  But let's see what he's learned.
He answers the questions on direct
examination with yes or a no and when he's
asked to, he'll explain.  Does that well.
On cross examination, did he ever answer
one question directly?  And you know the answer
to that.  He wanted to just turn away and 4446
lecture you.  Not answering the question
directly, but saying whatever he wanted to say,
regardless of what the question was, so that
almost every response, I had to say, okay, now,
my question, I guess the answer is what, yes,
no.  Every time.
That's what he's learned in his workshop
and cross examination.  Don't ever answer a
question on cross directly.  Don't even answer
the question.  You say what you want to say to
the jury to get your point across.  
What kind of points did he want to get
across?  This man had the audacity, the
audacity, the unmitigated gall to sit there and
tell you, their own expert agreed with me, and
said the man wasn't addicted, he agreed with
me.
Now, if that were true, if that wasn't a
bald-faced lie, don't you think, when
Dr. O'Brien was on that stand, Mr. Kreiner, who
is the best attorney in this courtroom, would
have said, now, Dr. O'Brien, do you recall when
I took your deposition?  Well, let's read your
deposition, because today you're saying that
David Ellsworth is addicted, but, in July, you 4447
said he was not; is that correct?
Well, it didn't happen, because that was
not the testimony.  And, yet, their own expert
is telling you that under oath.
That's the kind of expert they called for
addiction.
And, finally, lastly, on the issue of
fault.  Since 1963, the defendants have known
this is an issue of fault.  Since 1963.  Why?
That memo I keep referring to as the Battelle
Hippo that I showed you today?  
What does it say?  "It's difficult to
assess the effect of the report on causes of
action arising prior to its issuance.  
"Logically, it would be argued the report
does no more than to collate preexisting
knowledge, knowledge as available to the buyer
as the seller.  But logic might, in the minds
of a jury, yield to the emotional reaction that
if this knowledge was available to the seller,
it was up to him, having the means to do so, to
make the product safe.
"A jury might, whether instructed or not,
operate on the theory of comparative
negligence.  True, the buyer was negligent in 4448
smoking a product he knew was dangerous, but he
was lulled by the seller, and the seller's
negligence was the greater in failing to make
this product safe."
That's exactly what the evidence has shown
in this case.  The seller, R.J. Reynolds, knew
in the '50s their product wasn't safe, and they
didn't tell David Ellsworth.
And in 1963, they knew, we're more at
fault than David Ellsworth.  Based on the
evidence in this case, they're 100 percent at
fault, David Ellsworth has none.
Now, with respect to damages, Mr. Persons
talked briefly about damages and said you
shouldn't award any.  Well, he hasn't come up
with a suggestion of his own for how you
should.
So you can take my suggestion, as I said,
leave it as it is with our number, or you can
take whatever number you'd like.
I ask that you consider the evidence, the
testimony, find RJR responsible, award
compensatory damages to Kerri Ellsworth for her
loss of support and services for her father.
And alternatively, for some reason, for some 4449
happenstance, you find that we haven't proven
that was not a BAC -- that this was a BAC, if
you find it was, and we haven't met our burden,
then you look at the survivorship claim, the
pain and suffering of David Ellsworth.
And, lastly, we ask that you find that we
are entitled to punitive damages based on the
evidence we've shown.
Thank you again.
