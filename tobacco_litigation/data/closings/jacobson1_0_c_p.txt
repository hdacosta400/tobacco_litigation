6          MR. KAISER:  May it please the Court.
7          Ladies and gentlemen of the jury:
8          Good morning.
9          The first thing I want to do -- and I think I speak
10 for everybody -- is to thank you for bearing with us and for
11 serving and for basically ignoring your life and being here
12 for the last couple of weeks, because without you we wouldn't
13 be able to do this.  So thank you very much for your service.
14 It's almost done.
15          What I want to do -- and you're going to get a packet
16 of instructions read to you and you're going to get a verdict
17 form, and there are going to be certain questions you are
18 going to be asked to answer, and I'm going to go just in order
19 as I did in my opening statement, but this time in my
20 summation I will follow the exact order.
21          And the first thing that you're going to be asked to
22 decide is whether Fredric Jacobson was an Engle class member.
23 You will be asked whether he was a class member, which means,
24 number one, did he have COPD on or before November 21, 1996.
25 That's the first question that we have to talk about.  The

1 second question was, was he addicted to the nicotine in the
2 cigarettes that he smoked; and finally, was his condition a
3 legal cause of his COPD.  That is what Engle class is all
4 about.  So let's start off with COPD.  The question is whether
5 or not he had COPD on or before November 21, 1996.
6          And I might add that if you find that 99.9 percent of
7 Mr. Jacobson's problem was related to asthma and .1 percent
8 was related to COPD, you will answer "yes" to question 1
9 whether he has COPD.
10          MR. GERAGHTY:  Objections Your Honor.  Misstates the
11 testimony and the law.
12          THE COURT:  It's up to the jury to recall what the
13 testimony was.
14          Go ahead, Mr. Kaiser.
15          MR. KAISER:  Why?  Because all we have to show is
16 that he had COPD, not exclusive of asthma, not exclusive of
17 anything.  We have to show you he had COPD.  So, what did the
18 evidence show?
19          First of all, you did not see any medical records
20 where Fredric Jacobson was diagnosed with adult intermittent
21 asthma in this case, not one.  You did not see any medical
22 record where Fred Jacobson was diagnosed with any medication
23 for adult intermittent asthma.  You did not see medical
24 records where Fredric Jacobson talked about allergies as an
25 adult which are associated with asthma.  And recall, when

1 Dr. Frazier testified, he said that as a child Fred's asthma
2 was precipitated by allergies.
3          You also heard during the defense's opening statement
4 that Fred couldn't have a dog as a child or in his life
5 because of his childhood asthma, when in fact not only did he
6 have a dog as a child but he had dogs throughout his life.
7 Never heard anything about allergies.
8          What you did hear on the medical records, what you
9 saw was that in almost every one of these medical records they
10 talk about his smoking history, which is relevant to COPD
11 because that's what causes COPD.  His smoking history, his
12 name is identified in almost all of the medical records that
13 were displayed to you in this case.
14          Now, what we have in this case is a number of
15 pulmonary function studies in 1997 and forward, and I'm going
16 to show you in a minute and we're going to talk about what
17 these pulmonary function studies show.
18          And beginning on the top left from this chart, we see
19 the note from Dr. Krieger.  And recall, Dr. Krieger, in his
20 history of the patient -- and this is in 1997 -- what did he
21 note?  He noted that Fredric Jacobson had a history of
22 childhood asthma while growing up in New York which has not
23 caused any problems in the past 40 years.  That's clear as day
24 from the history that Dr. Krieger took in 1997.
25          Well, you ask, what about that 1988 note from

1 Dr. Korn that we saw during the defendant's case, and that
2 note you recall talked about Fred Jacobson does wheeze.  How
3 often?  We don't know.  When?  We don't know.  How long?  We
4 don't know.  And it said, when he does wheeze, he'd get short
5 of breath.  How often?  We don't know.  What we do know is
6 that wheezing is not necessarily a single cause of asthma.
7 Wheezing can be a cause of a number of things, including
8 bronchitis, for example.
9          So, what does that note from 1988 tell us?  Virtually
10 nothing.  Because if you review the note, you're going to see
11 that Dr. Korn did not prescribe any medication for Fredric
12 Jacobson for asthma, he did not diagnose him with adult
13 asthma, and he did not indicate any follow-up was necessary
14 after 1988 for asthma.
15          Also, the defense pointed out to you that, well,
16 there's this insurance form that Fred Jacobson filled out and
17 he said that he was rejected from the military because of a
18 asthma.  What does that mean?  Does that mean that he went for
19 a physical examination when he was an adult and they found he
20 was suffering from adult asthma and they said you are rejected
21 from the military?  We don't know.  Does that mean that he
22 filled out his registration for the draft when he was 18 years
23 old and on the registration said I suffer from childhood
24 asthma and he got a letter back saying you are rejected?  We
25 don't know.  Does that mean his father pulled strings and got

1 him out of the military in the '60s so he wouldn't have to
2 serve and they said it was because of asthma?
3          MR. GERAGHTY:  I would object, Your Honor.  There's
4 no evidence to support that statement.
5          THE COURT:  Just a second.
6          I think it's fair argument, and again, it's up to the
7 jury to recall what the evidence in the case was.  And I would
8 just remind the jury that what the lawyers say during closing
9 argument is not the evidence in the case.  It's what you
10 recall the evidence was and what the record reflects.
11          Now, that's not to say that the lawyers can't make
12 arguments based on inferences derived from the evidence.  But
13 again, it's up to you to decide whether you want to accept
14 those inferences or reject them.
15          MR. KAISER:  And these are just some of the questions
16 that you need to ask, because the document doesn't tell you
17 that.  And, so, when you see this reference that he was
18 excluded from the military, what does it really show you?  It
19 shows you absolutely nothing.
20          Now, let's look at the pulmonary function studies
21 after 1996, and we can see that the first one that you were
22 shown was in July of 1997 from Baptist Hospital from
23 Dr. Hernandez, where, as a result of the test that was
24 performed, his analysis indicated a moderate obstructive lung
25 process, which the defendant's own doctor said can be

1 consistent with COPD, although he said it's not diagnostic of
2 COPD.  What they also told you was, well, during this time he
3 had this huge mass in his upper airway that was causing the
4 obstruction.
5          Remember, Dr. Feinberg testified, yes, he had
6 obstruction in his upper airway, but his diffusing capacity
7 was low, and that is COPD.  That's in July of 1997.  We have
8 confirmation of an obstructive lung process.  Not one word
9 said about asthma.
10          In October, October 17, 1997, when there is
11 absolutely no evidence of a mass in Fred Jacobson's chest, we
12 see a pulmonary function study, Baptist Hospital, Richard
13 Prager, M.D.  And what does he tell you in his
14 interpretation?  He tells you that it is consistent, his
15 obstructive lung process, with emphysema.  He does not say
16 asthma anywhere in his report.  So in October he tells you
17 emphysema.
18          We move on to Dr. Ziffer, which the defense did not
19 even mention in their questioning of Dr. Frazier.  And what
20 did Dr. Ziffer say?  He did a study and his study demonstrated
21 severe bilateral lower lobe air trapping, not upper, but
22 lower, in 1997.
23          Dr. Feinberg, what did he say air trapping is
24 consistent with?  COPD/emphysema.  What did Dr. Frazier say
25 air trapping is consistent with?  Emphysema.  Here we have

1 1997, a test, low air trapping, severe.
2          And finally, we have Dr. Gidel, a consultation in
3 June of 2000, and in June of 2000 he examined Fred Jacobson
4 and he noted asthmatic bronchitis.  He was fully aware of
5 asthmatic bronchitis.  "Bronchitis" is the word here,
6 asthmatic bronchitis, not asthma, bronchitis.
7          And he also, despite that finding of asthmatic
8 bronchitis, said he has a smoking history, which we know is
9 related to COPD, because that's what causes it, and said
10 likely underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, not
11 asthma.
12          Now, taken into consideration, what did Dr. Gidel
13 conclude?  He had asthmatic bronchitis as well as COPD, which
14 can coexist together.
15          So, we have one physician saying asthma didn't bother
16 the man in 40 years.  We have Dr. Hernandez who says
17 obstructive lung process.  We have Dr. Feinberg saying as well
18 that, well, yes, he also had COPD at that same time, because
19 of his diffusion capacity.  We have Dr. Prager saying
20 consistent with emphysema.  We have Dr. Ziffer saying lower
21 lobe air trapping consistent with emphysema.  We have
22 Dr. Gidel saying I understand asthmatic bronchitis, but I can
23 tell you that's likely of underlying chronic obstructive
24 pulmonary disease.  We have met our burden by a greater weight
25 of the evidence that Fred Jacobson had COPD.

1          Now, the defense is going to tell you, but that's not
2 a confirmatory diagnosis, none of this was confirmed.  But we
3 do have a confirmatory diagnosis before this in April of 1996
4 by Dr. Schneider.
5          Dr. Schneider was the treating physician, and you
6 have heard Dr. Frazier basically establish Dr. Schneider's
7 confidence.  How did he do that?  He talked to you about
8 receiving certain records for his review in order to formulate
9 his opinions.  He testified that one of the depositions he
10 reviewed was Dr. Schneider's.  And I questioned him about
11 that, and he agreed to a number of things.
12          For example, he told you he agreed with
13 Dr. Schneider's assessment that the FEV 1 and the FEV 1 ratio
14 are the most important variables for spirometry testing.  He
15 agreed with that.  He agreed with Dr. Schneider's working
16 definition of asthma.  He agreed with that.  He agreed with
17 Dr. Schneider's distinction between emphysema as air trapping
18 and asthma as a spastic component.  He agreed with
19 Dr. Schneider's testimony that you can have COPD and asthma at
20 the same time.  He agreed with Dr. Schneider that you can
21 diagnose or at least see emphysema on an x-ray study, and even
22 if you don't see it on an x-ray, that doesn't exclude the
23 possibility of emphysema.  And he also agreed that you can
24 have COPD mild with no symptoms.
25          Now, you heard Dr. Schneider testify.  At the time

1 that he did a pulmonary function study test on Fred Jacobson
2 in April of 1996, he had been doing that testing for 20
3 years.  He had previously diagnosed asthma.  He had previously
4 diagnosed COPD.  He knew the criteria to apply in order to
5 diagnose either one, and he had the numbers based on the
6 pulmonary function test.
7          You were also told this test is a very simple, not
8 complicated test.  Dr. Frazier agreed with that.  And it's
9 also a test that doesn't have to be administered by a
10 pulmonologist.  Dr. Schneider is not a pulmonologist.  He's an
11 internist and a cardiologist.  But Dr. Schneider had all of
12 these parameters when he made his diagnosis.  And he made a
13 note on April 26 of 1996, on the same day of the testing.
14          And based on all of his knowledge, all of his
15 experience, his 20 years that he had of doing pulmonary
16 function tests, what did he decide?  He came up with a
17 diagnosis of mild COPD.  In 1996, he came up with that
18 diagnosis, mild COPD.
19          Now, you heard Dr. Frazier say this is a slow
20 process.  This disease is not something that you just wake up
21 with one morning.  But the proof is that the fact that he had
22 COPD on subsequent testing verifies Dr. Schneider's diagnosis
23 that he made in 1996, which was mild COPD.
24          And he also recommended the best treatment -- it was
25 even agreed to by Dr. Frazier -- the sole best treatment for

1 treating COPD, especially mild COPD, and that was to stop
2 smoking, stop smoking, stop smoking, and he told Fred Jacobson
3 that his COPD was caused by smoking and he needed to stop.
4          There's more.  We talked a little bit about a test in
5 June of 2000.  Remember, Dr. Gidel's consultation.  Well, in
6 addition to Dr. Gidel's consultation, there was a pulmonary
7 function study that was done in June of 2000.
8          And I'm not going to get into the details of all of
9 the test results.  But even according to Dr. Frazier, when I
10 asked him, the FEV 1, that was not normal.  The FEV 1 ratio,
11 that was not normal.  And you can see that.  All he could say
12 was, well, it's consistent with COPD but it's not diagnostic.
13 That's all he could say.
14          And I questioned him more, and you can see from the
15 printout which he said he never reads, and the computer
16 printout, what did it show?  Suggesting emphysema.  Well,
17 almost every other test has said.  But most importantly were
18 two variables.  Number one, the RV, not the VC, the RV,
19 residual volume.  And I asked him, I said, well, isn't that a
20 little bit high?  And he said, yeah, but that's unreliable.
21          Now, you'll remember this.  He said that was
22 unreliable because Baptist Hospital in Miami didn't use the
23 right testing equipment.  They didn't use this body box.
24 Instead, they used this helium dilution method.  So
25 Dr. Frazier said it was a total unreliable result.

1          Well, he had to say that because he couldn't explain
2 any other reason for why that would be what it is which
3 suggests emphysema/COPD.  So he told you that Miami, Baptist
4 Hospital Health System as a whole has an unreliable test and
5 that all these patients over the years that are being tested
6 have an unreliable test because they're using the wrong
7 machine.
8          Now, really, don't you think that our good
9 pulmonologists in Miami working throughout the Baptist Health
10 System would know perhaps that the testing they are using
11 might be unreliable if that were really the case?  Or maybe
12 it's that the helium dilution method is just as reliable as
13 the body box test that Dr. Frazier says they use in
14 Mississippi.  Because we have the administrators of the
15 Baptist Hospital Health System along with the pulmonologists
16 using unreliable tests for all these years, does that really
17 make sense?  But that's all that Dr. Frazier could say about
18 that.
19          And what was it that Dr. Frazier said about the
20 diffusing capacity when I asked him?  Sure, it was severely
21 low, he said, but that's because Fred had severe anemia.
22 Well, I showed him the tests for his hemoglobin that was done
23 at the same time as these tests, and when he looked at it, he
24 says, oh, it's mild anemia.
25          And the next question was, well, what result would

1 that have?  What effect would that have on the diffusion
2 capacity?  He said, very little, very little.  On those two
3 results alone, ladies and gentlemen, that's COPD.  That's
4 COPD.
5          Dr. Frazier is different than Dr. Schneider and Dr.
6 Feinberg.
7          Dr. Frazier was hired while this litigation was
8 pending.  Dr. Frazier gets paid a thousand dollars an hour to
9 come in here and tell you what his opinion is.
10          Dr. Schneider is a treating physician who is not a
11 paid expert.  Dr. Schneider treated Fred Jacobson, knew Fred
12 Jacobson, knew his history.  It was his patient.
13          Dr. Feinberg is not a paid witness.  He is not a paid
14 expert.  Dr. Feinberg was a treating physician; he knew Fred
15 Jacobson; he treated Fred Jacobson; and they treated Fred
16 Jacobson well before this litigation was even thought about.
17          And, so, you have Dr. Frazier coming into this
18 courtroom from Mississippi and he's telling you about his
19 prior testimony.  What did he say about that?
20          Well, there's five cases where he's testified on
21 behalf of the railroad, the Illinois Railroad, and in each of
22 those cases the plaintiff said that they were exposed to
23 asbestos and they got a disease because of that.  And what did
24 he say?  In each one of those cases he testified it was not
25 asbestos; it was something else.

1          He testified in another case -- several cases on
2 behalf of a mining company, where plaintiffs were contending
3 that they were --
4          MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, none of this is in
5 evidence in the case.  None of it.
6          THE COURT:  That's sustained.
7          MR. KAISER:  Well, he testified about whether --
8          THE COURT:  It's sustained.
9          MR. KAISER:  And he's testified in other cases.  In
10 each one of those cases it was always something else other
11 than the disease.
12          And so, in an Engle case in the past he testified.
13 In that case he testified, yes, the woman had COPD, but it was
14 outside the time period of the Engle time period.
15          THE COURT:  Actually I do have to stop you.  My
16 realtime has collapsed.
17          THE REPORTER:  It's coming back.
18          MR. KAISER:  May I proceed?
19          THE COURT:  Yes.
20          MR. KAISER:  So that's how he's testified in the
21 past.  It's always someone else.  So that when he was hired in
22 this case, of course, it's not COPD despite all this evidence;
23 it's something else.  It's asthma.
24          And you know what?  Simple logic will show you how
25 Dr. Frazier is wrong.  Dr. Frazier, you see, all through the

1 medical records there's not any talk about adult onset of
2 intermittent asthma.  And yet, this one record from June of
3 2000, what does it say?  Asthmatic bronchitis, and he seizes
4 on that.  This is asthma.  Remember, he said it should even be
5 changed.  It shouldn't be asthmatic bronchitis.  It should be
6 bronchitic asthma.
7          Well, interestingly, isn't there something called
8 bronchial asthma we've all heard about?  Doesn't say a word
9 about that.
10          Let me just show you.  Simple logic.  Dr. Frazier's
11 testimony, what does he say?  COPD includes emphysema and
12 chronic bronchitis.  They're not exclusive.  They're always
13 together.  That's what he said.
14          You know what else he said?  When you have chronic
15 bronchitis and you have an exacerbation, a worsening of your
16 chronic bronchitis, is that asthmatic bronchitis?  And he said
17 yes.
18          Well, what does that mean?  That just meant that Fred
19 Jacobson's chronic bronchitis got bad for a day or to and it
20 became asthmatic bronchitis, not asthma, asthmatic bronchitis.
21          And when Dr. Feinberg was talking about asthmatic
22 bronchitis, remember what he said?  He wrote down acute
23 bronchitis with bronchospasm.  And he was asked on the bottom
24 whether or not acute bronchitis with bronchospasm, if there's
25 a difference between that and asthmatic bronchitis.  He goes,

1 there's no difference, there's no difference.
2          So, all this means is that Fred Jacobson had acute
3 bronchitis with a bronchospasm, a cough, and it was an
4 exacerbation of his underlying chronic obstructive disease,
5 which was chronic bronchitis on the one hand and emphysema on
6 the other.  That's all it was.  So Dr. Frazier seizes on this
7 and he says that was asthma.  And we know it was not.  It was
8 COPD.
9          And you know what?  Even if you find maybe he did
10 have an asthmatic component, we showed you he had COPD as
11 well.  So, when you're asked on your first question did Fred
12 Jacobson have COPD on or before November 21, 1996, I submit to
13 you the evidence suggests yes, he did.
14          Secondly, we need to talk about Fred Jacobson's
15 addiction.  Was he addicted to the nicotine in the cigarettes
16 he smoked?
17          Well before anyone thought of litigation in this
18 case, Dr. Feinberg prepared a note from June 6, 2000.  No one
19 thought of litigation in this case when Fred Jacobson was
20 alive.  And Dr. Feinberg wrote in his report that Fred
21 Jacobson has a history of tobacco abuse.  No one hired him as
22 an expert.  This is a treating physician who knew his patient,
23 he treated his patient, and he said Fred Jacobson had tobacco
24 abuse.
25          Now, you also heard the testimony of various friends

1 and family members who testified in this courtroom starting
2 with Jeffrey Jacobson, Fred's son.  And Jeffrey Jacobson was
3 asked what he can remember about his father smoking.  He said,
4 I can remember him always smoking.  That was him.
5          Do you think your father was addicted to smoking?
6          Yes, sir.  He said, I saw my father smoking
7 regularly.  It's what he did.  He always had a pack of
8 cigarettes with him in his pocket.  Wherever there was a
9 break, he smoked.  It's like what he did.
10          And over what period of time are we talking about?
11          And Jeffrey said:  My entire life that I knew my
12 father until the end.  He was a smoker.
13          What about Jennifer Dill, his daughter?  She was
14 asked, do you believe your dad was addicted?  She said, yes, I
15 do.  And it was the question why.  And what does she do?  She
16 gave a definition of what she thought was addiction.  And what
17 did she say?  Because he couldn't stop and people that loved
18 him and asked him to over and over, and he couldn't stop and
19 he wanted to stop.
20          What better definition for "addicted"?  His loved
21 ones urged him, begged him, pleaded with him to stop smoking.
22 He recognized it must have been bad for him, and he tried and
23 he tried and he couldn't quit.  Is this someone who enjoyed
24 smoking or perhaps he couldn't quit because he was addicted?
25 The evidence suggests he was addicted.

1          And Ronnie Jacobson, who was his wife for 17 years:
2          You would say he smoked about a pack or a pack and a
3 quarter a day?
4          Yes.
5          Do you think he was addicted to cigarettes?
6          Absolutely, she said, absolutely.
7          Now, you've got people that were around him for a
8 long time in his life.  You have a medical record that
9 supports the fact that he was suffering from tobacco abuse.
10 We have proved by a greater weight of the evidence, ladies and
11 gentlemen, that Fred Jacobson was addicted to the nicotine in
12 the cigarettes.
13          But there's more confirmation to his addiction, and
14 that can be found in the Surgeon General's Reports that are in
15 evidence from 1988 and 2010.  And I ask that you review those,
16 because in 1988 you're going to see from the Surgeon General
17 that the workings, the processes that determine tobacco
18 addiction are similar to those that determine addiction to
19 drugs such as heroin and cocaine.  That's pretty significant
20 that cigarettes are equated with heroin and cocaine insofar as
21 addiction.  That's the Surgeon General in 1988 telling us
22 that, ladies and gentlemen.  And in 2010 the Surgeon General
23 spoke on the issue again, and the report concentrated on
24 addiction.
25          And if you review certain parts of the report, you

1 can see.  What does it tell you?  Number one, it doesn't
2 really take that much to become addicted.  Here it says up to
3 a half a pack of cigarettes a day and that's enough to sustain
4 addiction and you don't need more.  That's pretty compelling
5 from the Surgeon General in 2010, isn't it?
6          And then relapse is something that happens a lot.
7 Relapse, look at the percentages here.  Relapse ultimately
8 claims 30 to 40 percent of smokers who stop smoking for one
9 year.
10          Now, we don't contend for a minute, despite the
11 records, that Fred Jacobson quit smoking for a year or any
12 length of time up to a year.  Maybe a few days, maybe a few
13 weeks.  You've not heard from one witness in this courtroom
14 who said Fred Jacobson quit for a year.  You've not heard one
15 witness say Fred Jacobson quit for six months.  You've not
16 heard one witness say anything other than he quit for a few
17 days or maybe a couple of weeks and that's it.  And even if he
18 did -- which we don't believe he did -- relapse is very
19 common, and you can still be addicted and relapse.
20          And typically, smoking initiation occurs during
21 adolescence.  Research shows that adolescent smokers report
22 some symptoms of dependence even at low levels of cigarette
23 consumption.
24          We know Fred Jacobson's level of consumption was not
25 low.  He smoked a pack a day for 40 years.  And let me explain

1 that to you in simple math.
2          Fred Jacobson smoked Kents when he started out
3 smoking for a number of years from '56 until 1976, maybe to
4 '79, after which he switched to Benson & Hedges.  Those are
5 the long cigarettes.
6          How many puffs do you think it takes to smoke a whole
7 cigarette?  Well, we know that Fred got his money's worth
8 because his wife told us that he smoked them to the end.  Is
9 one puff enough and then you put the cigarette out?  Not if
10 you're going get to the end it's not.  Two?  No.  Much more
11 than that.  Maybe ten?  How about eight to ten puffs before
12 you put that cigarette down.
13          Based on that, we compute, if Fred Jacobson averaged
14 out to be a pack-a-day smoker for a 40-year period of time,
15 just how many dozes bathed his lungs containing nicotine.  Let
16 me show you the doses of nicotine that Fred Jacobson bathed
17 his lungs with for his 40-year smoking history.  If he smoked
18 a pack a day for 40 years, that's 20 cigarettes times 14,600
19 days, which is a 40-year period of time.  That's 292,000
20 cigarettes he smoked during that time.
21          If you average eight puffs on those cigarettes, he
22 had 2,336,000 doses of nicotine that bathed his lungs, and we
23 know that nicotine is addictive.
24          I ask you, does it take 2,336,001 to be addicted, two
25 to be addicted, or you think maybe that's enough?  If you

1 bathe your lungs with a substance that is addictive, maybe
2 it's not going to take that much to be addicted.  And that's
3 how may doses he took over his 40-year smoking history.
4          And I suggest and I submit to you that we have proven
5 by a greater weight of the evidence, yes, Fred Jacobson was
6 addicted.  A doctor said so, his family members said so, and
7 calculations say so, as well as the Surgeon General.
8          When you put the two together, did he have COPD?
9 Yes.  Was he addicted to cigarettes?  Yes.  Was his addiction
10 a legal cause of his COPD?  Of course, it was, because if Fred
11 Jacobson wasn't addicted and he didn't smoke cigarettes, he
12 wouldn't have gotten COPD and died.  That's class membership.
13          So, on your verdict form you're going to be asked,
14 did Fredric Jacobson have chronic obstructive pulmonary
15 disease, and, if so, did his COPD first manifest itself on or
16 before November 21, 1996?  The evidence says yes.
17          Number 2:  Was Fredric Jacobson addicted to
18 cigarettes containing nicotine?  The evidence supports the
19 fact that he was.
20          Number 3:  Was his addiction to cigarettes containing
21 nicotine a legal cause of Fredric Jacobson's COPD?  Again, the
22 evidence supports the fact that it was a legal cause.
23          If you answer the questions yes, yes, yes, we have
24 proven that Fred Jacobson is a class member.  You are then
25 entitled to the Engle findings, which the Judge has read to

1 you, will read to you again.
2          And particularly, for what I'm going to talk about
3 next, there are two findings that I want to read to you:  One,
4 that defendants placed cigarettes on the market that were
5 defective and  unreasonably dangerous.  That is a fact that
6 has been proven and you do not need to decide it again.
7          Number 6:  That defendants were negligent.  That is a
8 fact that has been proven and you don't need to consider any
9 evidence, again.  That is a finding that you must agree that
10 you must accept that defendants were negligent.
11          Well, the question you're going to be asked, then,
12 is:  As to plaintiff's negligence and strict liability claims,
13 please state as to each defendant whether smoking cigarettes
14 manufactured or sold by that defendant was a legal cause of
15 Mr. Jacobson's lung cancer and death.
16          COPD is no longer relevant because we've proved class
17 membership.  All class membership does is unlock that door so
18 that you can now consider the other issues in this case, and
19 that is Fred Jacobson's lung cancer and his death from
20 cigarettes.  So the question asks you whether smoking the
21 cigarettes manufactured by Philip Morris and Lorillard caused,
22 are the legal cause of Fred Jacobson's lung cancer and death.
23          We know that Fred Jacobson's lung cancer was caused
24 by smoking.  There has been testimony to that effect.  That's
25 not disputed.  Lung cancer, small cell in this case, is caused

1 by smoking.
2          We know that Fred Jacobson smoked Benson & Hedges and
3 Kents.  Kents were manufactured by Lorillard.  Benson & Hedges
4 were manufactured by Philip Morris.  He do not smoke any other
5 brands for any type of long period in his life.  Those
6 cigarettes that he smoked caused his lung cancer.  If he
7 didn't smoke those cigarettes or any cigarettes, he wouldn't
8 have gotten lung cancer and died.  That's legal cause, ladies
9 and gentlemen.
10          So that we have proven to you the strict liability
11 and negligence claim.  That's all we have to show, a legal
12 cause because of the findings after class membership that the
13 defendants placed cigarettes on the market that were defective
14 and unreasonably dangerous and they're negligent.
15          So, what's the next step?  After we demonstrate legal
16 cause, the next step is, well, how are you going to apportion
17 fault.  How do you apportion fault?  It has to equal 100
18 percent.
19          Who's at fault in this case?  We accept
20 responsibility.  I said that at the start.  We accept some
21 measure, very little, for Fred Jacobson's smoking.  The
22 defense accepts none.
23          I'm going to demonstrate to you, based on the
24 evidence in this case, how the defense should be almost
25 totally responsible for Fred Jacobson's decisions that he made

1 in this case.
2          This case is not just about Fred Jacobson and his
3 choices that he made concerning his smoking.  This case is
4 about the tobacco companies, it's about the defendants, and
5 it's about the choices and the decisions and their
6 responsibility in this particular case, and I want to go over
7 that.
8          Because you heard from Dr. Proctor and you heard from
9 other witnesses, Alan Weidberg, the tobacco industry created a
10 climate where smoking was normalized.  That was Dr. Proctor's
11 words.  Remember?  They created this climate through their
12 mass marketing and advertising when smoking was normalized.
13 It was part of life where everybody smoked and you could smoke
14 virtually anywhere without restriction, and that went back a
15 long time ago.
16          And they advertised their products.  You heard
17 testimony that on the radio there were shows that were
18 sponsored by tobacco companies, and they advertised their
19 products on radio.  You heard that on television there were
20 shows that were sponsored by tobacco companies, and they
21 advertised their product on television shows for years until
22 1970 when it was banned on network television.
23          You heard that billboards advertised cigarettes and
24 they advertised their products on billboards.  In fact, you
25 heard in Times Square there was a particular billboard that

1 blew huge smoke rings out that we know Fred Jacobson saw.
2          And they created this climate, and sometime, even
3 before the '50s, there were studies, one in particular by
4 Angel Roffo in Argentina, where he came up with his own
5 correlation between smoking and cancer.  He painted the back
6 of rabbits.
7          And we know from 1950 there were four studies in the
8 United States that linked smoking and cancer, and we know that
9 the tobacco companies and these defendants were aware of those
10 studies and they had been following those studies, because
11 that's what Dr. Proctor told you in his testimony.
12          So the tobacco companies, when they knew about this,
13 they also knew about addiction.  When they knew about this,
14 they had certain choices to make, just like Fred did.  And
15 what choices did they have?
16          Number one, you heard that they had the ability to
17 use nonflue-cured tobacco in their cigarettes and the result
18 would be it would be virtually impossible to inhale the
19 smoke.  Did they choose to do that?  No, they did not.
20          You heard that they had the ability to take enough
21 nicotine out of the tobacco in their cigarettes so that they
22 would not sustain addiction, so that people could smoke
23 cigarettes and they wouldn't get addicted.  Did they choose to
24 take the amount of nicotine out necessary so as not to sustain
25 addiction?  No, they did not.

1          They had a choice to make.  They found out about this
2 information.  Did they tell the American public, the consumers
3 who were buying their products, what they knew at that time
4 when they knew it?  They did not.  That was a choice they
5 made, not Fred Jacobson.
6          So, when Fred Jacobson picked up his first cigarette
7 in 1956 as a 13-year-old boy, there wasn't a warning on that
8 pack of cigarettes saying Fred, don't smoke.  And in 1957,
9 there wasn't a warning on that cigarette pack saying don't
10 smoke.  Lorillard wasn't telling them that.  On those packs of
11 Kents, Philip Morris wasn't telling people don't smoke our
12 cigarettes because they're dangerous, or be cautioned.
13          In 1958, they weren't telling Fred Jacobson, when he
14 was smoking, that these cigarettes are addictive and they
15 might cause harm.  In 1959, they didn't tell him.  In 1960,
16 they didn't tell him.  In 1961, they didn't tell him, up until
17 1966, when the cautions first went on the packs of cigarettes
18 and they were mandated by Congress, not by the defendants.
19          And these were the choices they had before Fred
20 Jacobson ever picked up that first cigarette.  So that when he
21 did pick up that first cigarette in 1956 as a 13-year-old kid,
22 I submit to you he was ill-informed what he was getting into.
23          And while they were marketing their cigarettes, while
24 they were sponsoring TV and radio shows and they were pitching
25 their product with athletes, famous athletes at the time that

1 everybody knew about, Mickey Mantle, people like that, they
2 were pitching their products with actresses and actors that
3 were well known at the time -- everyone knew them -- they were
4 pitching their products with politicians talking about the
5 virtues of cigarette smoking, all along not telling people but
6 we also know they could be really bad for you and they could
7 be addictive.  And we also know that during this time they
8 were marketing their cigarettes to kids.
9          Now, these are the choices that were made by Philip
10 Morris, by Lorillard, by the rest of the tobacco industry.
11 And we could look at certain of their internal documents and
12 see what they knew and what they were doing to show how
13 blameworthy they are and just how blameworthy Fred is.
14          And let's take a look.  We know back in 1946, in a
15 letter, internal correspondence with Lorillard Tobacco
16 Company, that they were aware of certain dangers in
17 cigarettes, at least a presumption.  That's in 1946.
18          We know in the early '50s they knew about addiction
19 and they knew about cancer and they knew about the correlation
20 between their cigarettes and health and addiction.
21          And so we know by the time they met at the Plaza
22 Hotel on December 14, 1953, they were not meeting because they
23 were concerned with safety and health of their consumers.
24 They were worried about their bottom dollar because their
25 stocks were falling.  And so, when they got together at the

1 Plaza Hotel on December 14, 1953, it was a public relations
2 issue, and that's why they hired Hill & Knowlton, the most
3 influential well known public relations company in the
4 country.
5          And so, from December of 1953, when they first came
6 out with what's called the Forwarding Memo, when Hill &
7 Knowlton representatives interviewed certain of the research
8 directors for the large tobacco companies, what did they say?
9 And they quote different people, different research directors.
10          Fortunate for us that cigarettes are a habit they
11 can't break.  That was something that they liked.  It was
12 fortunate for them that people smoking those cigarettes were
13 going to get a habit, they would get addicted, and they
14 weren't going to be able to stop.  They real liked that.
15          What else?  Boy, wouldn't it be wonderful if our
16 company was the first to produce a cancer-free cigarette?
17 What would we do to the competition?  Now, this is 1953.
18          And what do these interviews show you?  They knew
19 about the dangers of their product.  They knew about the
20 addictive nature of the nicotine in their product.
21          And what did they decide to do?  Not tell Fred
22 Jacobson and everybody else that was buying their cigarettes.
23 They issued the Frank Statement to Smokers on January 1954,
24 and the Frank Statement was the beginning of their fraud for
25 50 years, their concealment fraud where they concealed the

1 truth about their knowledge of cigarettes and addiction.  For
2 50 years that's what they decided on privately.
3          What did they say publicly?  What do their records
4 tell us?  Their records said that basically they're going to
5 get to the bottom of this health scare from these studies.
6 They're going to do all the research they can do to get to the
7 bottom of things.  Don't panic.  We're going to hire the best
8 researchers and we're going to study the issue of smoking and
9 health.  That's what they put out in the Frank Statement,
10 because they thought the public needed to know and they were
11 committed to that, and they were going to form the Tobacco
12 Industry Research Committee to do this granting of monies and
13 to fund these studies and hire the best people to do research
14 about smoking and health.  And that's what they said publicly.
15          And you know what they said privately?  This was a
16 scam.  This was a front.  This was an industry shield against
17 the truth, because they were going to study everybody but
18 smoking and health and let the public believe they were really
19 going to do something to get to the bottom of this.
20          And you know how that's proven?  If we look years
21 ahead -- this is 1954 -- if we look at a memo written by
22 Philip Morris in 1978, almost 25 years later, what did they
23 say privately in a memo?  That the TIRC was set up as an
24 industry shield in 1954; that it was nothing more than a
25 front.  Like Dr. Proctor said, it was a shield against the

1 truth.  It was to create doubt in the public that there was no
2 problem with smoking and they were getting to the bottom of
3 it, and they knew for 50 years they were doing everything but
4 getting to the bottom of it.  Is that Fred's fault?
5          They knew, 1963, the Battelle Hippo memo, that's a
6 Brown & Williamson memo.  They later become part of R.J.R.,
7 R.J. Reynolds.  You're going to be told that as far as the
8 agreement to conceal, this conspiracy, the act of one is the
9 act of all.  One company becomes the agent of all the others,
10 so that when Brown & Williamson writes this memo, Lorillard is
11 responsible for its contents; Philip Morris is responsible for
12 its contents.  All the coconspirators are responsible for the
13 contents as if they wrote it.
14          And remember, at the Frank Statement, at that meeting
15 at the hotel on December 14, 1954, every one of the big
16 tobacco executives was there, presidents, chairmen of the
17 board.  Chairman Kent was there for Lorillard.  The CEO of
18 Philip Morris was there.  The heads of all of these tobacco
19 companies were there when they agreed to do this concealment
20 fraud for 50 years.  They all agreed to it.
21          And so, in 1963, what are they telling?  What do they
22 know?  Nicotine is addictive.
23          They're not in the business of selling cigarettes for
24 enjoyment.  They're in the business of selling nicotine, an
25 addictive drug.  They knew at that time people weren't smoking

1 their cigarettes because it was enjoyable.  They were smoking
2 their cigarettes because they were going to get addicted and
3 they needed to smoke their cigarettes.  That's what they knew
4 and that's what they were writing privately that they did not
5 publicly tell anybody until 2000.  Is that Fred's fault?
6          In 1964, in response to the Surgeon General's Report,
7 what does Philip Morris say?  And again, Philip Morris is
8 speaking for every other coconspirator when they write this in
9 1964.  They needed to find a way to give smokers a
10 psychological crutch so they would continue to smoke and not
11 stop.
12          Now, this is a company, Philip Morris, that when
13 Dr. Proctor testified, they said, well, didn't we contribute,
14 didn't we give research to the Surgeon General, and didn't the
15 Surgeon General thank us?  And Dr. Proctor said, yes, the
16 Surgeon General thanked you.
17          And yet, what was their response to the Surgeon
18 General's Report when it came out in 1964?  They ridiculed
19 it.  Publicly they ridiculed it.  They said it was
20 irresponsible.  And privately they were saying we've got come
21 up with a way to make people believe they can still smoke
22 instead of quitting, because our business relies on that.
23 That was 1964.
24          And they wanted to do it in a numerous way, a light
25 way.  That's how they were going to respond to the findings of

1 1964, make it light and funny, when all the while they knew we
2 want people to smoke, not stop.  Is that Fred's fault?  No.
3 We take none.  We take no responsibility for their actions
4 during this time frame.  I'm sorry, we just don't.
5          We move on to 1966.  In 1966, again, Philip Morris,
6 as an agent for everybody else that was part of this
7 agreement, including Lorillard, what does Philip Morris say?
8 A cigarette that does not deliver nicotine cannot satisfy the
9 habituated smoker and cannot lead to habituation.  That's
10 addiction.
11          So, what were they saying?  If they don't have
12 nicotine to addict their smokers, people aren't going to
13 smoke, because people smoke for addiction, for the feel, for
14 the nicotine.
15          And that's why they said -- and you'll see that in
16 the Federal Trade Commission report in 1967, what did they
17 say?  Well, first of all, the cautions on the cigarettes they
18 say prove to be ineffective mainly because was no one was
19 looking at them.  That's how good those cautions were back
20 then.  And they also said that so pervasive is cigarette
21 advertising that it is virtually impossible for Americans of
22 almost any age to avoid cigarette advertising.
23          They got their message out and they were getting
24 their message out without telling the people the truth about
25 what they knew about their cigarettes.

1          And in 1972, R.J. Reynolds, again, an agent for
2 everybody else, and what are they writing?  Happily for the
3 tobacco industry, nicotine is both habituating and unique in
4 its variety of physiological actions.  Hence, no other active
5 material or combination of materials provides equivalent,
6 quote, satisfaction, unquote.
7          Now, they knew, they knew at this time and before
8 that nicotine is what provided smokers with the impetus to
9 smoke cigarettes, not enjoyment, not bathing lungs with this
10 nice gray smoke, not liking the feel of a cigarette in their
11 hand, not enjoying a cup of coffee with a cigarette, not
12 enjoying chatting with people smoking a cigarette.  It was to
13 get satisfaction for nicotine, and the tobacco industry was
14 happy.  They were giddy with the fact that nicotine was
15 habituating and unique.  That's how they were acting at that
16 time.
17          They have to be responsible for their actions.  They
18 have to be responsible for their choices.  They have to accept
19 responsibility for what they were doing back then in not
20 telling people like Fred Jacobson.
21          Was their strategy that they employed successful?
22 Was their information getting out to the public?  Remember
23 what they were doing.  They were using all sorts of techniques
24 in addition to advertising to get their message out, the White
25 Papers, newsletters, press releases, television exposure,

1 executives talking and denying the health risks of smoking,
2 public appearances, speeches, all sorts of things to get their
3 message out.
4          And in 1972, Tobacco Institute memo, what does it
5 say?  That their strategy was brilliantly conceived and
6 executed almost 25 years later.  And how was it brilliantly
7 conceived and executed?  Among other things, in creating doubt
8 about the health charge without actually denying it.  They
9 recognized that their message was out there, that their
10 strategy was brilliant, that their message was getting out to
11 the public and it was creating doubt, and people were
12 continuing to smoke their cigarettes and they weren't quitting
13 because there was enough doubt where they didn't need to
14 quit.  And they were lauding themselves for that in 1972.  And
15 they didn't stop in 1972.
16          In 1994, on television, before Congressman Waxman,
17 every major executive from the tobacco companies under oath
18 testified, number one, we don't believe nicotine is
19 addictive.  They knew that for the last 50 years, and they're
20 still lying in 1994.  And they said, all of the executives,
21 the top executives, we don't believe cigarettes cause cancer.
22 This is in 1994, and according to Dr. Proctor, it wasn't until
23 2000 that they finally admitted that cigarettes cause cancer
24 and that nicotine in their cigarettes is addictive.
25          That's from there own documents, their own internal

1 documents where you can see privately what they were thinking
2 and what they were saying publicly.  And there are certain
3 questions that you need to see how the defense addresses them
4 in their closing argument.  How are they going to address
5 these questions?
6          And the answer is going to be, they will not be able
7 to.  They will not address them.  Why?  Because they will have
8 to admit fault, and they will not do that.  They will not
9 answer these questions for you.  And you need them answered
10 because you need to apportion fault.  And I submit to you, if
11 they can't answer the questions, their fault needs to be real
12 high in comparison to Fred's.
13          So let's see how they'll answer these questions.
14 Number 1:  When the defendants, Philip Morris, Lorillard and
15 others, when they knew by the early '50s that cigarette smoke
16 contained carcinogens and could cause cancer, why did they
17 choose to not tell the American public, including Fred?  Why
18 didn't they do that?
19          You deserve an answer to that question.  You need the
20 defense to come up here and explain to you we knew about it
21 but we didn't tell the American people.  Instead, we created
22 this controversy that didn't exist for 50 years and never told
23 the truth until 2000.  Why did they do that?  Is that Fred's
24 fault that they did that?  Absolutely not.
25          When they knew that smoking caused cancer, why did

1 they choose to not use nonflue-cured blends of tobacco that
2 would make inhaling difficult?  After all, if they had the
3 wherewithal to do it, if you didn't have to bathe your lungs
4 with all those bad chemicals, why didn't they do that?  You
5 are owed an explanation to apportion fault.  They knew way
6 back when that they could do that and they chose not to.  Is
7 that Fred's fault because they made that choice?  Absolutely
8 not.  The reason that they didn't do these first two things is
9 because they value profit over safety.  That's the reason.
10          When they knew, the defendants, by the '50s that
11 nicotine was an addictive drug, as we saw in their internal
12 memos, why did they choose not to tell the American public,
13 including Fred?  After all, if they had told the American
14 public, perhaps enough people would not start smoking knowing
15 they faced possible addiction to the cigarettes and possible
16 disease from smoking their cigarettes.  That would affect the
17 bottom line of the tobacco companies, and they didn't tell the
18 American public.
19          Is that Fred Jacobson's fault?  No, it's not.  Why?
20 The defendants knew that nicotine was an addictive drug.  Why
21 did they choose not to take the appropriate amount of nicotine
22 out of their cigarettes so they wouldn't sustain addiction, so
23 people could actually smoke cigarettes to enjoy that smoke
24 bathing their lungs, so they could sit and chat with people
25 over a good meal with their cigarette?  And the answer is

1 because people didn't smoke for enjoyment.  They smoked for
2 the nicotine, the tobacco companies knew it, and they didn't
3 want to let on that they knew that, and there was no way they
4 were going to tell people like Fred and the American public
5 because it's profit over safety.
6          When the Surgeon General's Report was issued, and
7 despite their cooperation and the fact that they were thanked
8 by the Surgeon General, why did they ridicule it?  Why did
9 they publicly ridicule the Surgeon General's Report, all along
10 privately knowing that what the Surgeon General said was
11 right?  Why did they do that?  Because they didn't want people
12 like Fred to know from the cigarette companies that their
13 product was dangerous and it was addictive, because they
14 valued profit over safety.  Is that Fred's fault?  No, it's
15 not.
16          When the Surgeon General's Report was issued, why did
17 they privately advocate providing a psychological crutch for
18 people to continue smoking instead of giving them the choice
19 to quit if they told them what they knew?  The same answer,
20 ladies and gentlemen.  They valued profit over safety.
21          Let them respond to you.  Let the defense respond to
22 these questions.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe there was some other
23 reason.  We need to know.
24          Why did the defendants respond to the strong evidence
25 linking cigarettes to cancer, which they already knew, with a

1 campaign designed to create doubt about the health risks and
2 addictive nature of cigarettes for the next 50 years?
3          This was not something that lasted a month.  This was
4 not some campaign of denial that lasted for a week.  This was
5 a campaign of denial that was calculated to create doubt,
6 calculated to create a controversy that didn't exist for 50
7 years.  That's a lot of responsibility.  That's not Fred's
8 fault.
9          Did the defendants want Fred -- did they want him to
10 believe their message they were putting out there:  That more
11 research was needed; that there was no proof that cigarettes
12 were dangerous; that bad things would be removed in cigarettes
13 if they were found and they would close their business if it
14 was found that their cigarettes were dangerous to health?  Did
15 they want Fred to believe that message?  They absolutely did
16 want him to believe that message because they were spending
17 lots and lots of money to get their message out to the
18 public.  Sure, they wanted Fred to believe that.  Sure, they
19 wanted Fred to continue smoking.  Sure, they didn't want Fred
20 to quit.  Sure, they wanted Fred to be a longtime user of
21 their cigarettes.
22          And, so, if they wanted Fred to believe their
23 message, and if he did believe their message, why is he
24 blameworthy?  Why?  If he did everything they wanted him to
25 do, if he bought their product, if he smoked their product, if

1 he smoked their product for a long, long time, why is he to
2 blame?
3          And finally, why did the defendants -- and you heard
4 Dr. Proctor -- this is advertising dollars alone.  From 1940
5 to 2004 they spent $250 billion advertising their product.
6          Now, that doesn't even include how much they were
7 spending to fund their denialous campaign.  Why were they
8 spending billions and billions of dollars on a message that
9 was not working all the while congratulating themselves for
10 their success?
11          And the reason is because it was working.  It was
12 working.  Despite this evidence you heard about Reader's
13 Digest having articles over the years about smoking being bad,
14 and Columbus in 1492 and John Adams writing a letter and
15 things like that, they got their message out, they knew they
16 got their message out, and they were congratulating themselves
17 for their success.  These are questions that you need
18 answered.
19          And you know what Fred Jacobson's fault is in this
20 case?  You know what it is?  And this is what we take
21 responsibility for.  Why was Fred Jacobson born too weak to be
22 able to be motivated to quit smoking?  Why did he have the
23 constitution that didn't allow him to quit successfully until
24 1996?  Why didn't Fred try hard enough?
25          We know he tried to quit in the '70s, in the '80s, in

1 the '90s, and he was unsuccessful.  We knew at some point he
2 had to realize that smoking was bad.  His loved ones wanted
3 him to quit.  He tried to quit.  He was unsuccessful.  He got
4 irritable when he quit.  He was not fun to be around.  That's
5 what Jeffrey testified about.
6          Did he try hard enough to quit?  Well, maybe he
7 didn't.  Maybe he didn't.  And for that, ladies and gentlemen,
8 we take responsibility.  We take responsibility for that.  But
9 I'm going to make myself clear.  We don't take responsibility
10 for any, any of the actions of the tobacco companies.
11          And so, you've got ten reasons why they're
12 responsible here and one for Fred.  That's a ten-to-one
13 ratio.  I submit to you, based on the evidence, the
14 apportionment of fault is 91 percent for the tobacco companies
15 and 9 percent for Fred.  Put 9 percent on him.  Put 9 percent
16 on Fred to say you just didn't try hard enough.  You believe
17 them.  After all, tobacco companies want you to believe that
18 smokers should have been smart enough to believe the other
19 information out there and should have known we were lying.
20 They trusted us.  Well, that message is not acceptable.  91
21 percent and 9 percent for apportionment of fault.
22          Next for your determination is reliance.  You're
23 going to be asked -- reliance is necessary for you to resolve
24 as to the concealment fraud and the conspiracy to conceal.
25 And you're going to be asked the following question:  Please

1 state for each defendant, Philip Morris and Lorillard, whether
2 Mr. Jacobson relied to his detriment on representations made
3 by that defendant on or after May 5, 1982, that concealed or
4 omitted material information concerning the health effects or
5 addictive nature of smoking cigarettes, and, if so, whether
6 such reliance was a legal cause of his lung cancer and death.
7 That's reliance for the concealment fraud.
8          Let's talk about reliance.  We know that the tobacco
9 companies went on their denialous campaign for 50 years.  You
10 heard about that.  I just discussed it.  We know that they
11 responded vigorously to any negative information about their
12 products.
13          As I told you, they responded by press releases, by
14 their executives telling people, look, we'll take all this bad
15 stuff out if we find anything in our cigarettes.  They went on
16 television.  They were on news shows.  They were in front of
17 the Waxman Commission.  They were in newspaper articles.  They
18 made speeches.  They advertised their products.  They spent
19 billions and billions of dollars to get their message across.
20          We know that Fred Jacobson was a smart man.  We know
21 that Fred Jacobson was an intelligent man.  We know that Fred
22 Jacobson was well read.  We knew that Fred Jacobson was up on
23 current events.
24          The defendants would have you believe that his
25 intelligence and his being well read and up on current events

1 is only applicable to the information that he was aware of
2 dealing with the risk of smoking and the addictive nature of
3 smoking.  That's what they want you to believe.
4          When it comes to their response with the White Papers
5 and the newsletters and everything I discussed, they don't
6 want you to believe that he was so well read.  They don't want
7 you to believe he was up on current events.  They want you to
8 believe at that point he was stupid.
9          MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object to that
10 statement.
11          THE COURT:  It's overruled.
12          MR. KAISER:  The fact remains you can't have it both
13 ways.  If he was smart and up on current events, to be a
14 recipient of the bad news about smoking, he was equally
15 intelligent and up on current events to be exposed to the
16 information that was being put out by the tobacco companies.
17 And there was no doubt that Fred Jacobson was exposed to the
18 good.  He was exposed to the bad.  He was exposed to the
19 tobacco companies' information that they were putting out for
20 50 years.  He was exposed to all of it.  We don't doubt that.
21 And we also don't doubt that at some point in team he knew
22 that cigarettes were bad, at least in the late '70s or early
23 '80s, because he tried to quit.
24          What we also know from the Engle findings is that the
25 tobacco companies knew more than Fred did and they were

1 concealing information that Fred was not aware of.  And that's
2 why one of the findings is that defendants concealed or
3 omitted material information not otherwise known or available,
4 knowing that the material was false and misleading, or failed
5 to disclose a material fact concerning the health effects or
6 addictive nature of smoking cigarettes, or both.
7          Now, we know all this information was being put out
8 in the public domain up until 2000, when they finally admitted
9 that smoking was addictive and smoking cigarettes could cause
10 cancer.  And we know specifically in 1988, Philip Morris
11 ridiculed the Surgeon General's Report, not just 1964 but
12 1988, and we know in 1994, all the major executives of the
13 tobacco companies under oath told Congressman Waxman's
14 committee that their cigarettes were not dangerous to health
15 and that nicotine in their cigarettes was not addictive.  We
16 know that.
17          The question that you have to answer is do you think
18 Fred Jacobson was exposed to that.  This is big news.  If it's
19 in the newspapers, it's on television, by all accounts, Fred
20 Jacobson saw that information.  He saw a lot of the
21 information that was being put out by Philip Morris and
22 Lorillard during this time.  After all, they were putting out
23 information in the billions of dollars of ads and statements.
24          So the question needs to be, if Fred Jacobson had
25 learned the truth from the tobacco industry, would he have

1 acted differently, what he have maybe tried harder to quit?
2 And this is how to resolve the question.
3          Remember, from 1964, when the tobacco companies
4 realized they needed to give a psychological crutch to smokers
5 to continue smoking, how would a smoker like Fred Jacobson,
6 who I submit to you was addicted, react to the information
7 about cigarettes being bad and, on the other hand, the
8 information from the tobacco companies that we're doing all we
9 can to research this issue and we'll let you know?
10          Don't you think it's more likely than not that the
11 addictive smoker is going to grab on to the information that
12 gives him that crutch to keep on smoking?
13          MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, this misstates Your
14 Honor's instructions.
15          THE COURT:  It's overruled.
16          MR. KAISER:  Don't you believe that the smoker wants
17 to hear information to rationalize his smoking as opposed to
18 quitting?  And so the question becomes, if the tobacco
19 companies -- if the information came straight from the horse's
20 mouth between 1982 and 1994 that their products were
21 dangerous, that their products could kill people, and that the
22 addiction, that the nicotine in their cigarettes was
23 addictive, and it's coming from the horse's mouth, perhaps
24 maybe Fred would have quit sometime during that time or at
25 least tried harder to quit.  That's something you need to

1 answer.  I submit to you, based on the evidence, he would have
2 quit.
3          And then it becomes whether or not his reliance was a
4 legal cause.  If Fred Jacobson had be given that truthful
5 information sometime during '82 to '94, what's the likelihood
6 of him, if he had quit, of developing cancer?  If he had quit
7 for 14 years before he actually got the cancer, there's a
8 likelihood he would never have gotten it, because you heard
9 testimony that most smokers don't get sick.  Most smokers
10 don't get sick.  So that's the reliance element on the
11 concealment fraud.
12          And it's basically the same evidence on the
13 conspiracy.  And you have the Engle findings on the
14 conspiracy, that defendants agreed to conceal or omit
15 information regarding the health effects of cigarettes or
16 their addictive nature with the intention that smokers and the
17 public would rely on this information to their detriment.
18          Now, on your verdict form you're going to be asked as
19 to each defendant whether Mr. Jacobson relied to his detriment
20 on any act undertaken by any of the defendants in the Engle
21 case after May 5, 1982, in furtherance of their agreement to
22 conceal or omit information regarding the health effects and
23 addictive nature of cigarettes and whether such reliance is a
24 legal cause of his lung cancer and death.
25          This just opens up the door to the universe of

1 statements between 1982 that were put out by not just
2 Lorillard and Philip Morris but by all of the defendants in
3 furtherance of their agreement to conceal.  So, necessarily
4 it's not just their appearance before 1984, the Waxman
5 Commission, the response by Philip Morris to Surgeon General's
6 Report; it's any number of statements that Dr. Proctor talked
7 about, this flood of statements that went on until 2000 in
8 furtherance of their conspiracy, and that's reliance.
9          And again, this is a person who has had over
10 two million doses of nicotine, who we submit is addicted, who
11 we submit is going to grasp on to information that allows him
12 to keep smoking because there's hope that maybe the product
13 isn't so bad.  And maybe, if he had known from the horse's
14 mouth that it was in fact bad or addictive, he just would have
15 quit and tried hard enough to do so and been successful
16 earlier and avoided cancer and death.
17          I want to talk to you about damages in this case,
18 because I've told you in my opening statement that we were
19 going to be asking for a significant amount of damages to
20 compensate Ronnie Jacobson for her loss, for her loss of
21 companionship, for her mental pain and suffering.
22          You heard the evidence in this case that is
23 undisputed, uncontradicted that she had a fabulous
24 relationship with Fred.  No witness said anything
25 differently.

1          Ronnie told you it was the best 17 years of her life,
2 from the first night she laid eyes on Fred until he died in
3 her arms on February 22, 2001.  Theirs was a special
4 relationship and everybody that testified said so.  They were
5 made for each other.  They loved each other.  And you could
6 see from the videos that we played without sound, even without
7 the sound, you could see the love that they had for each
8 other, without even knowing what they were saying during those
9 times on the videos.  You could see that.
10          And you heard Ronnie.  You heard people talking about
11 what they liked to do.  They liked to entertain.  They liked
12 to go out.  They traveled.  You saw pictures.  You saw the
13 photographs of them.  They were always together.  In fact,
14 Ronnie said there was only one night that they slept apart
15 from each other and that was only time that happened for 17
16 years.  They were in love.
17          And in June of 1997, the worst news that she could
18 possibly hear is when Fred was diagnosed with lung cancer from
19 smoking cigarettes.  And you heard -- and I don't need to go
20 over it in as much detail -- but you heard this was a tragic,
21 a terrible thing to go through.  Nobody would want to go
22 through what Ronnie went through, from the time of diagnosis
23 till his death.  She went to every one of Fred's doctors'
24 appointments.  She wanted to make sure that things were
25 positive and not negative.  She went around tearing the pages

1 out of books so that Fred wouldn't look and see that he was
2 going to die.  Even in the back of her mind, when she thought
3 that she might lose him, she never let on to Fred that there
4 was not hope.  She always gave him hope.
5          And Fred was the kind of guy who he cared more about
6 Ronnie when he was having this cancer, when he was dying, than
7 caring about himself.  On his worst days he would say how are
8 you instead of how am I.
9          When Ronnie was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1999,
10 when they got radiation together, it was Fred who was in the
11 throes of his lung cancer who was caring more about his wife's
12 decease than his own.  That's the kind of man that Fred was.
13          And as much as she loved Fred in life, she grieved
14 for him in death.  She has not remarried 12, almost 13 years
15 after he died.  And you know what?  It's very possible that
16 she will never remarry.  She thinks about Fred every day.  She
17 grieves about Fred every day.  When she does go out on dates,
18 she always compares these people, unfortunately, to Fred and
19 they never equal up to Fred.  No one ever will in her life.
20 Hers was a special relationship.
21          And, so, Ronnie Jacobson in a million years never
22 asked for this, in a million years would never have taken on
23 this task, this full-time job, if you will, from the day that
24 he was diagnosed with this illness until his death.  This
25 became a job thanks to the tobacco companies.  Thanks to

1 Philip Morris and Lorillard, this became her full-time job to
2 watch her husband suffer and die from lung cancer.
3          This is not television suffering.  This is real life.
4 This is real life, and you heard it.  There were ups and
5 downs.  There was remission of the cancer when everyone's
6 hopes got up, and then there was a spread to the liver.  There
7 was the hope where there was remission, then there was the
8 spread to the brain.  There was hopes after the remission,
9 then there was spread to the liver.  And it was up and down
10 and up and down, and all during this time Ronnie made sure to
11 keep Fred active, to keep his lifestyle the same, not to let
12 him become bedridden.  And they tried to go on trips.  They
13 did things like that until the cancer finally invaded his
14 brain and he no longer knew where he lived.
15          So, in order to compute damages in this case, it's
16 almost as if Ronnie got a full-time job, a job that no one in
17 their right mind would ever ask for, a job that no one would
18 apply for, a job that no one would want, a job that Ronnie
19 would give up in a heartbeat if she could have had Fred back.
20          But that was her lot in life.  She got a job and she
21 needs to be paid for that job from the time that Fred was
22 diagnosed until her grieving right now to this very day.  She
23 deserves to be compensated for that, because she doesn't have
24 Fred's companionship and she has suffered tremendously.
25          What did she tell you?  She was stricken with what's

1 called the widow's curse, where since Fred died she has not
2 had a good night's sleep in 12 or 13 years.  And as we sit
3 here, she still grieves for Fred.
4          No money could ever really compensate her for Fred's
5 loss, but she's entitled to be compensated, nevertheless.  She
6 would much rather, if given the choice, forego any money and
7 have Fred back.  But that's not going to happen and she knows
8 it.
9          So, what I have done is I have computed based on an
10 hourly wage, if you will, and the way to do this I suggest --
11          MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, may I preserve my
12 objection?
13          THE COURT:  Yes.
14          MR. KAISER:  I suggest the way to do this is the
15 defense called their expert witness, Dr. Frazier, who gets
16 paid $1,000 an hour to deny responsibility and to say in this
17 case that --
18          MR. GERAGHTY:  I would object to that statement, Your
19 Honor.
20          THE COURT:  Just a second.
21          Yeah.  It's sustained.  I think that's improper
22 argument.
23          MR. GERAGHTY:  I'd make a motion, Your Honor.
24          THE COURT:  No.  Your motion is denied.
25          The jury is instructed to disregard Mr. Kaiser's last

1 statement.
2          MR. KAISER:  They bought in their witness to testify
3 as an expert witness who got paid $1,000 an hour.  How much do
4 you think someone would take as a wage and have a job of
5 watching their husband suffer and die?  A thousand dollars an
6 hour?  A million dollars an hour?  How about if we take a
7 tenth of $1,000 an hour and say how about a hundred dollars an
8 hour?  A hundred dollars an hour might compensate her,
9 one-tenth of what they paid their expert in this case.
10          And what do we have?  If we base it on a 24-hour day,
11 because this woman hasn't had a decent night's sleep since her
12 husband died, and we base it on a number of days up till
13 today, this is what we end up with at a hundred dollars an
14 hour.  This to compensate for a hundred dollars an hour Ronnie
15 Jacobson for her grieving, for her loss of companionship and
16 for her mental pain and suffering.
17          You might decide that's too high; lower is
18 appropriate.  So you might decide, no, we think $50 an hour is
19 fair.  That's what you arrive at for $50 an hour.  You might
20 say, you know what, I understand what you're telling us.  You
21 might decide it's higher.  It's whatever you decide.  You are
22 free to play with these numbers.  You're free to calculate any
23 way you wish.  But based on the evidence, I suggest to you, I
24 submit to you that this is the appropriate monetary figure to
25 compensate Ronnie for her loss in this case.  This is money to

1 compensate Ronnie.
2          Now, there's another aspect to this case, and that is
3 punitive damages.  That is to punish in this case.  And you
4 need to determine whether or not we've proved by clear and
5 convincing evidence that the defendants in this case deserve
6 to be punished, whether we are entitled to punitive damages to
7 punish behavior and to deter behavior of the defendants and
8 others in like circumstances so this is not repeated.  That's
9 what the role of punishment is for.  And there are a number of
10 reasons that we have laid out in this case to support
11 entitlement to punitive damages, and I'm going to go over
12 them.
13          Entitlement to punitive damages.  By clear and
14 convincing evidence, we're going to show you that the
15 defendants knew, they intended the consequences, they acted
16 with knowledge, so that they knew about the health risks of
17 smoking their product and they chose not to tell people,
18 including Fred Jacobson.  That was their choice, not Fred's.
19 That was intentional, not accidental.  That was calculated,
20 not mistaken.
21          We showed you, they wanted smokers to become addicted
22 to their cigarettes and they were giddy about it.  They were
23 happy that their product addicted people because they didn't
24 want people not to become addicted because they wouldn't smoke
25 their cigarettes.  They acted with intention, not by mistake

1 or accident.
2          We proved to you through Dr. Proctor, they marketed
3 their cigarettes to youth, to children.  That's who they
4 targeted during the years.  And isn't it happenstance that
5 Fred started smoking when he was 13 years old and Alan
6 Weidberg started smoking when he was 14 years old, that people
7 start smoking when they're teenagers, like the Surgeon General
8 has said?  That's intentional.  That's not accidental.
9          They engaged in a conspiracy to create doubt -- we
10 know about that because that's an Engle finding -- to create
11 doubt about the health risks and addictive nature of smoking.
12 That was their decision, not a mistake, not an accident, and
13 it lasted not for a day, not for a week, not for a month, but
14 for 50 years, 50 years.
15          They lied to the public about the health risks of
16 smoking up until 1994, when they went on television and six
17 years after that until they admitted it.  They lied.  They
18 didn't tell Fred.  They concealed that information.  That was
19 not accidental.  That was willful.  That was intentional.
20 That deserves punishment.
21          They lied to the public about their nicotine not
22 being addictive while we know privately they were well aware.
23 They were happy about it.  They knew that people needed
24 satisfaction from cigarettes, and that's why they did not sell
25 cigarettes; they sold dosages of nicotine.  That, ladies and

1 gentlemen, is action by intent, by intentional acts, and not
2 accidental or mistaken acts.
3          And finally, Fredric Jacobson and others, countless
4 others, died because of their intentional acts, because of
5 their decision made all the way back into the '50s when many,
6 many more people were starting to smoke than do today, when
7 most people smoked then as opposed to not many now.  They
8 consciously made the decision back then, when they knew full
9 well about the dangers of smoking not to tell people.
10          They made a conscious decision, when they could use
11 different tobacco so people wouldn't be able to inhale their
12 cigarettes and die of lung cancer, but they chose not to do
13 that.  They knew full well they could take nicotine out of
14 their cigarettes so that people could smoke and not be
15 addicted, but they realized people wouldn't smoke if they
16 did.  So they didn't do that.
17          And they knew full well that from the time they knew
18 about the dangers of smoking and how addictive it was, all
19 they had to do was tell people, warn people, and they didn't
20 do that.  And so people like Fred Jacobson, when he started
21 smoking cigarettes in 1956, or those whereabouts, wasn't
22 informed, not by his fault but by theirs, Lorillard and Philip
23 Morris.
24          That's acting with intent.  That's not acting by
25 mistake.  That's not acting by happenstance.  That is acting

1 with intent, and by clear and convincing evidence, ladies and
2 gentlemen, we are entitled to seek punitive damages to punish
3 them and deter them in this case.
4          I ask you to consider the evidence, consider the
5 testimony, consider all of the exhibits that you've seen that
6 are part of this trial, ladies and gentlemen, and we have
7 proven by the greater weight of evidence such that on every
8 one of your questions you could be satisfied in answering
9 yes.  And I ask you to compensate Ronnie Jacobson for her loss
10 accordingly.
11          Thank you very much.


         MR. FINGER:  May it please the Court, Counsel, and
Members of the Jury.
         Now it's my turn.  This portion of the trial I will
have the opportunity to respond to some of the comments you have
heard from the defense.  I guess I would be remiss if I didn't
thank you, too, because everybody else thanked you.  So I will
thank you too on behalf of Ronnie Jacobson, co-counsel, and for
affording Ronnie her day in court and for your attention of this
throughout.
         I suspect when you walked into the courtroom for jury
selection, and we know when Judge Ungaro questioned you, all of
you were of a mind that the decision to smoke is an individual
choice of every smoker.  Indeed it is.  We have heard much of
Fred Jacobson's choice to smoke, and, indeed, he did.
         This case, Ladies and Gentlemen, and I will respond to
their remarks because they keep talking about his choice to
smoke.  The case is not about Fred Jacobson's choice to smoke.
There is no issue that he chose to smoke.  There is no issue
that he made that decision.  It was a fatal decision; it cost
him his life.          This trial is about why he made that choice, because it
was a very, very bad choice.  It was a choice that generations
of Americans made.
         The question for you, Ladies and Gentlemen, is not
whether or not Fred Jacobson chose to smoke; he did.  The
question is what did they have to do with that choice.  And when
little Fred Jacobson, 13 years old was in that schoolyard and he
took that first cigarette, what free choice did he have, and are
they responsible for the choice he made?  They would lead you to
believe they had nothing to do with it.
         You know, there is a saying, it takes two to tango.
They would have you believe Fred Jacobson danced alone.  There
was a reason why that little boy took that cigarette.  There was
a reason why it was the thing to do.  There was a reason why
everybody did it.  There was a reason why they spent $5 billion
in 1966 on advertising.  That was Proctor.  $5 billion I believe
was his testimony in advertising.  That was in 1966 when a
dollar meant something.
         So why did Fred Jacobson make that choice and what did
they have to do with it?  He made that choice because they
knowingly, intentionally, coldly, and calculatedly after a
meeting at the Plaza Hotel in 1953 got together and decided we
have to mold public opinion.  We have to create doubt in people.
         That meeting at the Plaza Hotel in about 6 weeks will
celebrate the 60th anniversary of the meeting of those conspirators of all the tobacco companies.  They met -- these
were competitors.  They were fierce competitors, and yet they
got together, and they had a meeting at the Plaza Hotel the
middle of December of 1953 because they knew that they needed to
band together to fight a common enemy.
         What was the common enemy?  The common enemy was the
truth.  The truth about their product was coming out, and they
knew that if the public became aware of it, sales would fall.
And they hired the leading public relations firm in the country,
Hill & Knowlton, who devised, by their own documents -- I'm
going to spend this time talking to you rather than -- for the
bulk of my time rather than putting up documents that you have
been seeing, documents probably until it comes out of your ears,
so let me take this opportunity to talk to you and give you the
overview of how we see the evidence.
         They put and they got together and they came up with a
campaign, an advertising campaign, that they described 20 years
later as brilliantly conceived and executed.  That plan was to
create doubt.
         MR. PEDROSA:  Objection, Your Honor.  Repetitive and
not rebuttal.
         THE COURT:  I don't know that this is rebuttal.  I will
give you a little latitude, but we are not going to go over all
the same things we went over in the opening close.
         MR. FINGER:  The strategy was to create doubt so that people would not exercise free choice.  Their choice would be
influenced by the ads, by the media.
         Defense counsel says who was in control?  Who was --
let me respond to who was in control.  They were in control.
They controlled the media, they controlled marketing, they had
an impact on Congress.  They were in control.
         Was Fred Jacobson in control of his smoking?  Sure.
But was it a free choice or was he guilty of fraud?  The Engle
findings after you determine that he had COPD and that he was
addicted, after you make that determination, and I will spend
time on that, you will then have the opportunity to decide if
that choice was a free and informed choice or was it the victim
of fraud.
         Mr. Geraghty gets up there and says Fred Jacobson was
the type of guy that accepted responsibility.  Well, indeed he
did.  Responsibility if it lies with him.  But if he made these
choices because he was uninformed because they didn't let the
truth out, then I submit to you he is not responsible.
         We accept responsibility for that 9 percent that Kaiser
talked to you about because, yes, I cannot look you in the
eye -- maybe he should have tried the patch, maybe he should
have tried the gum.  We accept no responsibility for the fraud.
         Now let me go back and let's talk about COPD.  Because,
folks, that is the key to their responsibility.  If you don't
find that he had COPD by 1996 when Dr. Schneider said he did, or you don't find that he was addicted to cigarettes, or you don't
find that his addiction caused the COPD, then, indeed, they are
correct, that's the end of the trial.  You never get to reach
the issue of their responsibility.  Case over.
         He needs to be a class member.  COPD, addiction, and
addiction causation.  If any of those are no, you go home and
they are never answerable.  You don't reach their
responsibility.  Indeed, that's why so much emphasis has been
placed on this, because they don't want you to look at what they
did.
         Kaiser put up ten points for them to answer.  They told
you they are not so much as 1 percent responsible, it's
100 percent the fault of Fred Jacobson.  Mr. Kaiser put up there
ten questions for them to answer about what they did; they
didn't address one of them.
         Ladies and Gentlemen, before you decide that it's
100 percent Fred Jacobson's fault, shouldn't they at least
address what they did for 50 years before you decide zero
percent on them?  Wouldn't you like to know their explanation
for what they did for over 50 years before you decide zero for
them and 100 percent for Fred Jacobson?  I submit you should and
you will.
         Mr. Geraghty says there are four key points.  I will
address each of them.  First, Fred Jacobson knew it was
dangerous and addictive.  He did.  We are not here suggesting that Fred Jacobson lived in a cave and didn't know smoking was
bad.  Certainly by the end of the '70s, early '80s he knew
smoking was bad.  He was informed, he was educated.  He knew it
was bad.  Why else would he try to quit?
         Ronnie Jacobson told you he tried to quit repeatedly.
Why else would he try to quit unless you knew it was bad?  If he
wasn't addicted, he would have been successful.
         So in answer to that question, of course, he knew it
was bad for his health.  No one is suggesting otherwise.
         The question is was he free to quit or was he addicted,
because if he is addicted and he can't quit, even though he
wants to, then is it his fault?
         Now, we suggest 9 percent fault.  You know, what Fred
Jacobson is guilty of is he didn't come out of the womb strong
enough.  He should have quit.  They were quick to criticize him.
Made a free choice, he could have quit.  They suggest to you
that he tried to quit repeatedly.
         MR. GERAGHTY:  I would object to the comment on
criticizing.
         THE COURT:  It's overruled.
         MR. FINGER:  Ronnie Jacobson testified that he tried to
quit many times while she was with him over the 17 years.  The
defense points to the notation in the insurance forms where he
said he had quit.  A reasonable -- now, you can believe he quit
or you can believe Ronnie.          A reasonable inference that you can draw, I submit that
you draw, is Fred wasn't telling the truth.  Now, defense
counsel says is he going to lie over a few hundred bucks?  Well,
we don't know that he is going to save a few hundred bucks.  We
know that if it's an insurance form, and they ask are you a
smoker, if the answer is no, the rates are lower.
         Now, we may not like the fact that he wasn't honest on
this form, but not one penny of the money you award is going to
go to Fred Jacobson.  He died 12 years ago with his lungs and
brain rotted out by cancer.
         You don't have to like Fred Jacobson.  Whether or not
he was honest on that form or he was not honest, she does not
miss him less.  She does not love him any less.  And the value
of this case is not diminished by whether or not Fred Jacobson
wasn't up front on that form.
         Did he have COPD?  The answer is of course he had COPD.
Of course he did.  How do we know that?  Because two different
doctors and three different pulmonologists all said he had COPD.
These were five physicians.  We have the medical records of the
three pulmonologists, and we have Dr. Schneider and Dr. Feinberg
all said he had COPD.
         Was he diagnosed with COPD?  The word "diagnosis,"
don't be hung up on that, the word "diagnosis."  Was there a
literal diagnosis of COPD?  The answer was no.  He was being
treated for a big tumor in the middle of his chest.  The COPD was important only insofar as Feinberg needed to know what his
condition was in order to treat him.  The first question you are
going to ask is did he have COPD, and the answer to that
question is yes.
         Now, you may say, well, he could have had asthma.  You
know what?  Maybe he did.  The evidence suggests he did not
because not one doctor gave him so much as an aspirin for
asthma.
         They bring in their doctor from Mississippi that tells
you, oh, it was asthma all along.  Isn't it something that all
of these doctors are treating him presumably it's asthma.  I
guess the doctors down here don't know the difference between
asthma and COPD apparently, of course, and not one of these
doctors are giving him any medication for this asthma that they
claim he had all along.
         He had childhood asthma.  Every indication in every
record is childhood asthma.  They want you to believe that these
episodes later on is the asthma.  And they seize on the term
"asthmatic bronchitis" because it has the word "asthma" in it.
         Do not be mislead.  Asthmatic bronchitis is not
intermittent asthma.  Both Dr. Frazier and Dr. Feinberg told you
what asthmatic bronchitis is.  It's exacerbation of chronic
bronchitis, and it manifest itself like an asthma attack.
Asthmatic is an adjective that describes the type of attack.  He
was not on medication for asthma.          And how do we know he had COPD?  Because asthmatic
bronchitis is an exacerbation of chronic bronchitis which is a
component of COPD that everybody agrees.  Chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease is emphysema and chronic bronchitis.
Asthmatic bronchitis is an exacerbation of chronic bronchitis,
the component.
         Do not be mislead by that term "asthmatic bronchitis."
It doesn't mean he was having an asthma attack.  No witnesses
said that, but it sounds good because the word "asthma" is in
it.
         Dr. Gidel, and I want to focus on that last one.  This
is just an excerpt.  Dr. Gidel says, "Asthmatic bronchitis the
patient has some wheezing, he does have a history of smoking,
and likely has some underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease."
         Now, if asthmatic bronchitis is intermittent asthma, as
they would have you believe, why is he saying that Fred still
has COPD?  Obviously what he is describing is exacerbation of
the COPD.  It can't mean anything else.
         They bring in Dr. Frazier to say Gidel is wrong.  They
are using the wrong test.  If you believe that, fine.  We come
back to the initial '96 report of Schneider.  Schneider's report
in '96 is mild COPD.  Therein lies -- here is the '96 report.
This is the one that Schneider was able to retrieve.  Mild COPD.
         Now, let me deal with the notion that maybe Dr. Schneider has brought up.  He said he was able to retrieve
these records and that the backup documentation, the pulmonary
function tests, were in the computer that crashed; it was lost.
And they make a point in closing argument of consider that.
Consider how those documents aren't there.
         Ladies and Gentlemen, you heard Dr. Schneider.  If you
think that he phonied up these records, and he came into a
federal courthouse and decided to perjure himself about what he
said happened 17 years ago on behalf of the widow of a patient
of 17 years ago, and you think he is going to commit perjury in
a federal courthouse, answer the question no.
         If you think Dr. Schneider was telling the truth about
what he said, that he had COPD there.  And that was confirmed
the following year by Dr. Feinberg, Dr. Krieger, Dr. Hernandez,
Dr. Prager, Dr. Ziffer, and Dr. Gidel.  Prager says emphysema,
Gidel says COPD.  Hernandez in 1997 says, "The present pulmonary
function test reveals a moderate obstructive process."
         They talk to Feinberg, and Feinberg says but he also
had COPD.
         Let me refresh your recollection about what
Dr. Feinberg said.  Defense counsel said no doctor ever said he
had COPD, that we didn't bring in any doctor.
         Here is the question to Feinberg.  "Will you explain
what you mean when you say is contributing to it?"
         This is Dr. Feinberg on video.          "There was obstruction to the upper airways because of
the mass, and that was a contributing factor to what was see on
his initial pulmonary function test.  However, there was also
diffusion capacity markedly reduced which was not secondary to a
mass which was reported on a pulmonary function test assay that
day, and that is consistent with what the conclusion was of the
pulmonary physician that that was moderate obstructive lung
process going on."
         What was he saying?  There was a mass pressing on the
wind pipe.  There was COPD going on as well.  That's
Dr. Feinberg's opinion.  Because the diffusion capacity was
diminished, that's not caused by a mass.  That's caused by
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
         Interestingly, the next test is done by pulmonologist
Prager in October of 1997.  That's the doctor that found
emphysema.  Emphysema and COPD are one and the same.
Dr. Frazier said we use the terms interchangeably.
         What's interesting about that is when Prager diagnoses
emphysema, the mass is gone.  No excuse now.  You see the excuse
before was, well, it's a mass, that's why these results are off.
Feinberg says, no, still COPD.  In '97 the mass is gone, it's in
remission.  What does that pulmonologist say?  Emphysema.  Not
asthma.  Nobody says asthma.  He has childhood asthma.
         Ladies and Gentlemen, I submit to you that
Dr. Schneider, Dr. Feinberg, Dr. Krieger, Dr. Hernandez, Dr. Prager, Dr. Ziffer, and Dr. Gidel are not all making a
mistake, that they are not all overlooking asthma, that they
know the difference between asthma and COPD.
         I submit to you we have satisfied our burden of proof
that he had COPD on or before November 21, 1996.  Those doctors
confirm Schneider's earlier diagnosis.
         Let's go to addiction.  Was he addicted?  You heard the
family talk about addiction.  The flaw in their argument, the
defense argument, was he could quit.  He can quit, therefore, we
want you to conclude if somebody can quit, they are not
addicted.
         In fact, the Surgeon General's report that is in
evidence talks about this.  Assume now Ronnie said he never quit
for any extended period of time, but I'm going to go with their
contention.  I'm going to go with that.  Let's say he quit for
those long periods of time.  Let's go with it.  Evidence is to
the contrary, but let's assume it's true.  What does the Surgeon
General say?
         "Relapse is the principal limiting factor in the
transition from smoking to nonsmoking status."
         We don't have an expert.  We brought you the Surgeon
General of the United States.
         Here is the interesting part:  "Findings and studies of
long-term outcomes suggest that relapse ultimately claims 30 to
40 percent of smokers who stop smoking for one year."          Does that -- let's assume he stopped for a year.  Does
that mean he wasn't addicted?  It means when he starts up again
it's a relapse.  Thirty to 40 percent of people who stop for a
year start again.  It's evidence that it's a relapse of the
original addiction.
         That's the nature of addiction.  You fall off the
wagon.  Sometimes you fall off the wagon a year later.
Sometimes you fall off the wagon 7 years later.
         For instance, Yudkin and his colleagues, this was a
2003 study, found that about one half of the smokers who had
stopped smoking for one year relapsed to smoking within the
subsequent 7 years.  Seven years later you can start smoking
again, and you are still addicted.  It's a relapse.
         So the notion that he started and stopped proves he
wasn't addicted simply isn't the case.  What it proves is it was
relapsing and it's an addiction.  That's the nature of it, and
that's the Surgeon General of the United States.
         I submit to you the answer to question number 2 is was
he addicted to nicotine?  The answer is sure.  Sure, we have
proved that.
         It's interesting they say he smoked for enjoyment,
which is interesting, but he wasn't addicted.  So I think a lot
of people do a lot of things for enjoyment.  Some people enjoy
eating pizza.  You know, someone eats pizza for dinner one
night, and then they eat it a second night and a third night. They are not addicted to pizza, they just enjoy it.
         Let's say they eat pizza for dinner every night for
3 months.  You would think if they are not addicted, they might
get sick of that pizza after 3 months and have a hamburger, if
they are not addicted, if it's just enjoyment.
         At some point it stops being enjoyable.  He smoked a
pack and a half for 40 years.  Out of enjoyment?  If he wasn't
addicted, it was just enjoyment, why didn't he quit?  Why didn't
he get sick of it and take a month or a few months off?  Why
didn't he stop and have a hamburger?  He was addicted.
         Now, if you are addicted to pizza, you will eat it
every night for dinner for 40 years.  You never get sick of it.
So the notion that he -- did he enjoy it?  I'm sure he did.  The
notion that if somebody enjoys an activity that is addictive
proves it is not addictive simply defies common sense.
         You have also heard of people that are addicted to
heroin and they beat it, they overcome the addiction.  They beat
addiction.  Does that mean they were never addicted because they
were able to beat the addiction because they were able to quit?
That's absurd.
         That's what they are suggesting.  The answer to
question number 2 is yes, of course, he was addicted.
         The third question is did the addiction cause the COPD,
and the answer is of course.  What was he addicted to?  The
cigarettes.  What caused the COPD?  Cigarettes.  Did the addiction cause the COPD?  Of course.  The COPD didn't come from
anything other than the cigarettes that he was addicted to.  The
answer to question number 3 is yes.
         Now we get to their responsibility.  Now that he is a
class member, now we get to look at what they did, and now your
focus can turn to them because you have unlocked it.  He is a
class member, you are through the door, and the Engle findings
come into play.
         The judge is going to tell you that the product is
defective, they were negligent, that they conspired to cover up
the truth.  We know from Proctor they did that for 50 years.
         MR. GERAGHTY:  This is all repetitive and not rebuttal.
         THE COURT:  It's true, Mr. Finger.  I can't really
dispute that, so you are going to need to not repeat what
Mr. Kaiser talked about in his opening close.
         MR. FINGER:  Let me go right from my notes.
         THE COURT:  Is that going to improve things?
         MR. FINGER:  Yes.
         THE COURT:  Very well.
         MR. FINGER:  I want to touch on a couple of little
themes.  This case is not about -- and let me go back.  This
case is not what was written down on those forms.  Defense
counsel spent a lot of time showing you the forms.  The question
that you are going to be asked is not did Fred Jacobson note on
any forms that he had COPD?  Did Fred Jacobson note on these forms that he had emphysema?  That's not the question.
         The question very simply is did he have COPD.  Whether
Fred Jacobson wrote it down on a form or not doesn't answer the
question of whether or not he had COPD.  We have the doctors to
say he had COPD whether Fred wrote it down on those forms or
not.
         This case is not about what's on the forms.  It's on
about whether he had COPD.  He only needs a little tiney weeney
bit of COPD.  That question about COPD doesn't say was he
diagnosed with COPD?  Did he have demonstrable COPD?  Just did
he have COPD?  Did he have asthma?  It doesn't matter.  He just
needs a little tiney weeney bit of COPD that answers that
question yes.
         Ronnie Jacobson's testimony, her credibility.  They
suggest Ronnie wasn't upfront with you, she wasn't honest with
you.  Why?  Because she doesn't remember having a conversation
with Fred about warning labels on cigarettes?  Do you really
expect her to sit down, and maybe she should have had a
roundtable and brought some friends to talk about the caution on
the cigarettes.  Who does that?  People don't do that.  Of
course, there was no discussion.
         How is she going to remember a discussion with Fred
about the warning label?  That's not how human beings act.  They
suggest to you that it's the reason she is not being upfront
with you.  If she told you, yes, Ladies and Gentlemen, I specifically remember a conversation, it was at some length Fred
and I spoke for several hours about the warnings on those
cigarettes, that would be preposterous.
         Fred Jacobson is responsible for his choices.  We heard
that over and over again.  He was always in control.  He was
always in control.
         Was he in control when he was 13 in that schoolyard?
Was he in control then?  Did that little 13-year-old-boy -- what
was so cool about smoking?  Was he in control?  Why did he make
that decision?  Was it their marketing, the billions they spent?
Was it the brilliantly conceived and executed strategy conceived
3 years earlier?
         No, Fred Jacobson was not in control.  When he finally
became an adult, when he finally got to the point where he was
in control, it was too late, he was addicted.
         The defense would have you believe that everybody
always knew smoking was bad, it was a free choice.  Everybody
knew.  And they put up the front page of the New York Times, the
big news on the Surgeon General's report.
         Ask yourself this:  If everybody knew since Christopher
Columbus and John Quincy Adams how bad smoking was, why was it
such big news?  Why would it be front page on the New York Times
if everybody had known that for 500 years or several hundred
years?  Christopher Columbus was 1492 he sailed the ocean blue.
If everybody had known since Christopher Columbus, what would be the big news?
         The Surgeon General was telling people what they didn't
know.  Nobody knew how bad it was.  What happened?  They started
pouring millions into this disinformation, you heard from
Proctor, to dispute what the Surgeon General said.  They
ridiculed what he said.
         MR. GERAGHTY:  This is repetitive, Your Honor, and not
rebuttal.
         THE COURT:  It is.
         MR. FINGER:  Why did cigarette consumption increase in
1975?  Proctor said it peaked in 1975.  They talked about
everybody knew.  They talked about Reader's Digest.  That was
spoken about, that was mentioned in their closing argument there
were thousands and thousands of articles.  The evidence was
30 of them were about the hazards of smoking.  We don't even
know that Fred read Reader's Digest.
         They talked about the poll.  Ninety percent, they
addressed this in their closing, 90 percent of the people had
heard that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer.  They had heard
it.
         Well, I dare say you might have heard about a flying
saucer landing in Roswell, New Mexico.  You might have heard
that, doesn't mean you believe it.
         When those people were asked what they believed, only
2 or 3 percent believed it caused cancer.  While they may have heard it, that doesn't mean they believe it.  They were pouring
billions of dollars into this disinformation so the public
wouldn't believe it.
         Comments by Weidberg.  You might recall Alan Weidberg
said you need to quit, and the response was you need to lose
weight.  His daughter said you need to quit, and the response
was don't hock me.
         They would have you believe what that means is he
doesn't want to quit, he doesn't care.  That's not what that
means.  What he is saying is I don't need to be reminded.  You
don't need to remind me I need to quit.  He knows.  That's why
when I asked Weidberg he told you that you need to lose weight,
I said did you need to lose weight, and the answer is yes.
         So when he says you need to lose weight, that's not
because he is not acknowledging the health hazards.  He doesn't
need to be reminded.  He knows that's all that means.
         The caution, 1966.  We are dealing with somebody who is
addicted.  They call it a warning.  In 1966 what was on that
pack is, "Caution:  Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your
health."
         They would have you believe from that point until 1970
when the warning changes everybody is on notice.
         Now, ask yourself this, again, bring your common sense
about human nature to bear:  Someone is addicted to cigarettes,
and they see a caution that says it may be hazardous.  May be. It doesn't say it is.  It says it may be.  What is an addictive
person going to want to believe?  Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.
I think I will have another cigarette.
         Those warnings were worthless, and the Federal Trade
Commission report, which is in evidence, tells you nobody pays
attention to them.  They are ineffective.  That's why they
changed 4 years later, because nobody paid attention to it.
Weidberg's testimony was that after the Surgeon General's report
you couldn't bum a cigarette for a week, then everybody went
right back to it.
         The number of people who quit, 13 million quitters as
of 1970; 30 million Americans between '64 and '90; 55 to
60 million Americans by 2013.  They talk about that in their
closing argument.
         You know what records we don't have?  How many people
have tried to quit and couldn't.  They don't keep those
statistics.
         What else we don't have is we don't know of those
60 million people that quit how many of them are addicted.  Some
of those people quit because they died; Proctor told you that.
They are in the statistics too.  When somebody dies they stop
smoking.
         Now I dare say if somebody quits and they smoke one or
two cigarettes a day or maybe a few cigarettes a week, those are
in there too.  Don't be mislead by that statistic unless you know these 60 million are people that smoked a pack a day like
Fred Jacobson, then you are comparing apples and apples.  Don't
be mislead by those statistics.  Lots of people have quit.  Lots
of people haven't quit.
         Schneider's tentative report.  They made much of the
fact that at one point in his deposition Dr. Schneider said his
conclusion that it was mild COPD was tentative.  What they don't
mention in their closing argument is what else Dr. Schneider
said.  And what he was asked is he was asked, "It would be
speculation for you to tell this jury today in 2013 that you did
anything other than simply make a tentative diagnosis in this
case?"
         "Answer:  I don't know because according to what I
said, I had the results, and that's why I would have said COPD."
         "But today in 2013?"
         "Answer:  I don't have the data."
         "Today you just don't know, isn't that right?"
         "Answer:  Because I don't have the data, but according
to my note I would say he had COPD."
         Mr. Kaiser on redirect of Dr. Schneider asked him this:
"Do you recall later on in the deposition you were asked a
question about whether there was anything tentative about your
diagnosis?"
         "Answer:  I think you asked me that."
         "Question:  What was your answer then?"          "Answer:  Nothing tentative."
         He doesn't have the pulmonary function tests.  All he
can tell you now is I had those results then, at that point it
was COPD.  Is it tentative?  Without those reports that he
doesn't have, he said it was in the computer to look at, that's
the best that he could do.  There was nothing tentative about
that diagnosis of COPD.
         We know it was confirmed by Feinberg and the
pulmonologist a year later, so we know it's right.
         He was not diagnosed with COPD?  It wasn't a problem,
he was asymptomatic.  Somebody can have an illness that doesn't
bother him.  Because he wasn't clinically diagnosed does not
mean he didn't have it.
         People can walk around with the herpes virus, they
don't have an outbreak, but they have got the virus.  They don't
have an outbreak they feel fine, but they have it.
         If the question was did somebody have herpes, the
answer would be yes even if he hasn't had a problem in years
because the virus is there.
         The COPD was there.  Feinberg explained it wasn't
diagnosed clinically.
         I didn't mention on the disability application he
didn't mention COPD.  He wasn't seeking disability benefits for
COPD.  COPD was never a problem.  So why would he indicate he
had COPD on the disability form?  The disability was a big giant tumor in the middle of his chest, not COPD.  How does that prove
that he did not have COPD that he didn't put it on that form?
         THE COURT:  Five minutes.
         MR. FINGER:  Thank you, Your Honor.
         You are not going to get a definition of addiction;
that's true.  You apply your common sense to addiction.  You
have heard the evidence.  We don't need to trot some doctor in
here.  You heard he smoked all the time, that's what he did, you
have the Surgeon General's report.
         They would lead you to believe that we need to bring
you a doctor.  You apply your common sense.  That's what we are
counting on.
         They didn't bring you a doctor to say he doesn't have
it.  They hired somebody from Mississippi to come down here and
say our local doctors are wrong.
         MR. GERAGHTY:  That's repetitive, Your Honor.
         THE COURT:  It's overruled.
         MR. FINGER:  I will go on.
         Maybe Dr. Weiner doesn't know if he is addicted, but
you folks do.
         Let me finish.  Did he rely on their fraud after 1982?
I submit to you he did.  If you are going to hold these
corporations responsible for punitive damages, you must answer
either of these questions, 6 and 7, yes, one or both, if you
want to hold them responsible for punitive damages.  And I submit to you he did rely on it.
         Every time they denied that it was addictive, every
time they got up there and they told the American public that it
didn't cause cancer or the jury is still out, that's the
psychological crutch.  Fred Jacobson maybe his brain told him
that it wasn't true, but in his heart of hearts he wanted to
believe it.  That's human nature.  He wanted to continue
smoking, and he wants to believe it's true.  That's why he
relied on those statements after '82.
         They perjured themselves in front of a Congressional
Committee in 1984.  We have their documents they knew in the
'50s and the '60s nicotine was addictive, their own documents.
They swore under oath before a Congressional Committee it
wasn't, and that was 1994.
         We know that Fred Jacobson was aware of current events,
he read current events.  Now, did he believe those CEOs that
testified?  I don't know.  He is not here to tell us.  You
decide who you want to give the benefit of the doubt to on that.
         MR. GERAGHTY:  I will object, Your Honor.  Argument.
         THE COURT:  It's overruled.
         MR. FINGER:  We talked about free.  You are right.
Fred Jacobson was free to make his choices.
         They are free too, and they were free to tell the
truth.  They were free in 1953 to tell the American public the
truth about their product instead of getting together at the Plaza Hotel and hatching this conspiracy to mislead people.
That's their freedom.  And they have the right to get together
and meet, and they are free to hire Hill & Knowlton, and they
are free to do whatever they wanted.
         You are free to hold them responsible, and you will
return a verdict which speaks the truth.  The word verdict is
from the Latin.  Speak the truth, verdict.  Veritas, truth, dict
from diction.  Verdict speaks the truth.
         I will ask you to answer all of those questions yes
because we have carried our burden of proof.  And let your
verdict shine like a beacon of truth and illuminate their
boardroom and every boardroom that would get together as they
did at the Plaza Hotel, and let them know by your verdict that
you will not stand idly by and let so much as one person's life
be sacrificed on the altar of corporate greed.
