MR. BYRD: Good morning. So this is -- the last
time I could speak to you, obviously, was in opening, and
this will be my last time to speak with you, and I appreciate
your time. I appreciate these two weeks that you've given to
us for your service. And I want to walk you through some
ways that I think you can look at -- you are going to have to
answer some questions on the Verdict Form, and I would like
to talk to you about those and talk to you about what I think
09:08:01
09:08:04
09:08:06
09:08:08
09:08:09
09:08:11
09:08:13
09:08:14
09:08:16
09:08:17
09:08:19
09:08:21
09:08:25
09:08:27
09:08:28
09:08:29
09:08:30
09:08:31
09:08:43
09:08:45
09:08:49
09:08:51
09:08:56
09:09:00
09:09:02
6 the evidence showed.
Just so you know how we will handle this, I'm going
to speak to you for a few minutes and handle some of the
Verdict Form questions, and Ms. London is also going to come
up and speak on a couple matters, on a couple other Verdict
Form questions, and then I'll come back and finish off. So
you'll hear from both of us during the time. But I do want
to thank you for your time. On behalf of Mr. Kerrivan, who
also thanks you for your service this two weeks.
It's an important -- it's an important thing to
perform jury service, and I think you heard that at the very
beginning and through the process we went through in voir
dire to speak the truth, to try to find out and make sure
that we had individuals who this was the right case for them,
that they could put any sort of bias and feelings aside.
We heard different people with different views, and
you were especially selected because you were able to take an
oath and promise that bias is about whether you even believe
in cases like this and stuff, all those types of things we
went over, that you're not that person; that you're going to
go back there into the jury room and make a decision based on
just the evidence that you've heard in this courtroom and
just the law that the judge is going to give you, and you'll
have it in writing.
I urge you when you go through each question to
09:09:04
09:09:05
09:09:09
09:09:11
09:09:14
09:09:18
09:09:20
09:09:23
09:09:27
09:09:30
09:09:34
09:09:38
09:09:41
09:09:44
09:09:48
09:09:53
09:09:55
09:09:59
09:10:05
09:10:08
09:10:11
09:10:14
09:10:17
09:10:21
09:10:21
7 look at those jury instructions. You'll have them in writing
and follow them, because they're important. And if you stick
within those four corners and make sure everybody follows
those instructions. If there's some concern, somebody starts
saying, you know, I just don't think -- I don't even agree
with giving money at all in cases like this, well, you know,
we went over that in voir dire, and everyone said they
understood that they would be willing to give the full amount
of damages and be able to do that. And so remind them "we
need to follow the law and the instructions."
I heard Mr. Davis speak in opening a little bit
about two sides of a coin, you know, you make choices,
personal choices, and the flip side of the coin was personal
responsibilities.
And as you sit here and think about the evidence, I
want you to remember that the law says that we treat
corporations equally. They want to be treated just like
people in courtrooms, and they have that right.
But then that means they have a coin, too, that has
two sides. And with corporate choices that are made by
R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris, there's corporate
responsibility.
So at each point when you -- you are going to have
some questions that deal with how much fault to apply to each
person. And Mr. Davis, I believe, will probably come talk to
09:10:25
09:10:28
09:10:31
09:10:34
09:10:38
09:10:40
09:10:44
09:10:47
09:10:51
09:10:54
09:10:56
09:11:01
09:11:08
09:11:12
09:11:13
09:11:15
09:11:18
09:11:22
09:11:25
09:11:28
09:11:32
09:11:37
09:11:39
09:11:42
09:11:45
8 you about to look at all the choices that Mr. Kerrivan made,
and that this is about Mr. Kerrivan. But I want -- at the
same time, one of the reasons we built this timeline here is
I want you to think about -- as you weigh the evidence, think
about the choices that the companies were making at the same
time in Mr. Kerrivan's life that they're going to want you to
look at the choices he made.
And then furthermore, as we told you, you've got to
step back in history. You've got to put yourself back. We
brought you Dr. Proctor, we brought you Dr. Grunberg to take
us back in time about what the culture was like and what
things were like. Put yourself back in that time and
understand how old was Mr. Kerrivan when he made his
decisions. How powerful were the corporations when they made
their choices?
Now, it's a simple concept, but when I grew up, a
simple lesson, you know, your freedoms stop where they
interfere with somebody else's. And it's kind of this
concept, I think, you know, in America that we're made up --
this country is amazing. We have all type -- they're saying
we all came over on different boats here, but we're in the
same boat now.
And, you know, there is nothing wrong with
R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris putting out a product, it's
legal to sell, advertising, making money. There's nothing
09:11:49
09:11:53
09:11:56
09:12:00
09:12:03
09:12:09
09:12:12
09:12:13
09:12:16
09:12:19
09:12:23
09:12:26
09:12:29
09:12:34
09:12:37
09:12:39
09:12:44
09:12:48
09:12:51
09:12:54
09:12:57
09:13:01
09:13:03
09:13:05
09:13:09
9 inherently wrong with them doing that. But when their rights
to do all those things start interfering and rubbing up
against other people, like Mr. Kerrivan, then decisions have
to be made as a society and lines have to be drawn. And
that's really what you're here to do is be that conscience of
this community to figure out how far do people get to go.
You know, there's been a lot about -- let me go
over a couple of things.
This case, I mean, we didn't come here out of
nowhere. You've heard about the Engle class. Okay? We
talked about this in opening, but it's a case from the
mid-90's, okay, and it went on and on and on. It was a jury
that sat for a very long time to hear a lot of evidence, way
longer than you all did. See all sorts of documents, and
they made certain findings, and they made findings that if we
show Mr. Kerrivan is a member of that class, and we'll get to
those questions in a minute, then they apply. And you have
to apply them, and you can't -- you can't second-guess them
or -- they are applied. They are law, and you have to follow
the law because the judge will tell us that.
So this is -- you are really kind of the concluding
act in this case that has gone on for a long time.
And, yeah, there's been a lot of other cases. You
heard -- you'll hear a lot about how Dr. Proctor has
testified a bunch of times and testifies all over the place.
09:13:13
09:13:18
09:13:23
09:13:27
09:13:35
09:13:42
09:13:48
09:14:01
09:14:04
09:14:07
09:14:11
09:14:15
09:14:18
09:14:21
09:14:24
09:14:29
09:14:32
09:14:34
09:14:37
09:14:41
09:14:43
09:14:48
09:14:53
09:14:55
09:14:58
10 Well, of course.
Mr. Kerrivan didn't choose his place in the line of
when his case came up in this class. If he had been the
first one, they wouldn't have testified more than once.
But, of course, there's been a lot of cases, and
that's how the process works. And this is the concluding
final act of that jury's work. You're doing that. You are
that judge, as Judge Erickson instructed you.
MR. DAVIS: Your Honor, I object to that argument
as a factually and legally inaccurate statement that this
jury is that jury.
THE COURT: All right. The law I think is fairly
plain that this case started off as a class and there were
certain decisions made, and I've instructed you on them.
If Mr. Kerrivan is part of that class, those
findings are binding on you to the extent that I've
instructed you on them. Okay?
This case is a continuation in one sense, and
because -- Mr. Kerrivan is a purported member of the class,
and ultimately one of the decisions you get to make is, is he
in the class or not?
And I think that's what Mr. Byrd was trying to say,
and I don't think that there should be any confusion. Just
to make sure there isn't, that's my comment on it. Okay?
You may proceed.
09:15:01

11 MR. BYRD: Thank you, Your Honor.
I told you in opening, and I don't know if I said
this part in opening, but, you know, the truth of the matter
is that I think everybody comes into these cases and
everybody knows something about cigarettes. I mean,
everybody has had some sort of experience through themselves
or other people with cigarettes and have opinions about
cigarettes.
But I hope, and I think, that you've probably
learned something during these two weeks that you didn't know
before about the cigarette industry, about cigarettes, about
how they're made and about what went on for this 50-year
conspiracy that Dr. Proctor talked about.
I want you to think about what that perhaps means
for Mr. Kerrivan, because if you learn some stuff that you
didn't know, then perhaps that can be telling about what Mr.
Kerrivan knew back during this time.
We said we came here really because we were
assuming for four reasons. I think in opening I had
mentioned those; that, you know, we felt that there were just
some basic obligations that corporations should be able to
follow that aren't too much to ask for.
One was that a manufacturer should tell the truth
about the dangers in its product. That's not a lot to ask.
That's something that in this country we believe is not a lot
09:16:20
09:16:21
09:16:26
09:16:30
09:16:33
09:16:36
09:16:38
09:16:41
09:16:41
09:16:47
09:16:49
09:16:53
09:16:57
09:16:59
09:17:03
09:17:05
09:17:11
09:17:13
09:17:17
09:17:20
09:17:26
09:17:30
09:17:32
09:17:35
09:17:41
12 to ask from corporations.
Another reason we said we had brought -- we brought
this case, because a company should make a product that's as
safe as reasonably possible, and a company should market its
product in a responsible way.
Then the final reason was companies should not take
advantage of children and youth who are not in a place to
make lifelong decisions. Companies shouldn't target those
people, our children, with dangerous products.
Now, I had mentioned -- and to try to kind of put
those things in order, you try to think of -- I mean, it was
a different culture. Cigarettes were so different back then,
and the only thing I've ever -- I can think of to try to
compare it to is today everyone uses cell phones. Everybody
has them. They're all over the place. But, you know, every
now and then you've heard reports, people hear reports, that
cell phones, maybe they cause brain cancer. Okay. But
everybody keeps using them. People have heard reports like
that from time to time, maybe an occasional mention in a
newspaper or something, but everybody keeps using their cell
phones.
Now, what if it turns out that the manufacturers of
those cell phones actually know that the cell phones we're
carrying around and using every day cause brain cancer?
And what if they have all these documents and hide
09:17:45
09:17:47
09:17:51
09:17:54
09:18:00
09:18:02
09:18:05
09:18:11
09:18:16
09:18:22
09:18:28
09:18:32
09:18:35
09:18:37
09:18:42
09:18:47
09:18:50
09:18:55
09:18:58
09:19:00
09:19:02
09:19:04
09:19:10
09:19:14
09:19:18
13 it and they conceal it from their customers? And then what
if, further, people start coming out with these reports and
they step out and say, "It's not true. It's not true. It
doesn't cause brain cancer. Keep using your phones." Market
the product. All the while they know it causes brain cancer.
And then what if you take that a step further and
30, 40 years from now the industry that manufactures cell
phones, finally the news comes out, finally it's proven,
finally outside scientists show these phones we've all been
using are causing brain cancer and the cell phone industry
comes out and says, "But you knew. Hadn't you read it in the
newspaper? Come on."
50 years ago, don't you remember the New York Times
had a story about it? What were you thinking, using our
product? You knew. You shouldn't have entrusted us. Do you
think we were going to tell you the truth?
That's -- you know, and then what if all that time
while the public health community tried to warn people about
cell phones, a massive conspiracy and campaign developed from
the cell phone industry to squelch that knowledge, to
advertise and get out on television and everywhere else and
say, "Don't believe it. It's not true. The science isn't
true. Keep using your phone. It's not a problem."
And then tries to come in and honestly say that,
"You know, those P.R. people, the marketing people we have,
09:19:20
09:19:25
09:19:28
09:19:32
09:19:35
09:19:39
09:19:43
09:19:48
09:19:53
09:19:57
09:20:01
09:20:06
09:20:09
09:20:12
09:20:17
09:20:21
09:20:24
09:20:29
09:20:32
09:20:36
09:20:40
09:20:44
09:20:48
09:20:52
09:20:56
14 you know, really, we just pay them to do nothing. It's not
worth it. We actually spend $250 billion on marketing
campaigns, and you know what? They don't make a difference."
Really? Is that why Super Bowl ads are so
expensive, because they don't work?
I mean, can anybody really remember the commercials
when they were a kid that actually made them go do something?
But don't we acknowledge and understand that it works or they
wouldn't be spending that kind of money on it?
That's a little bit -- that analogy is what you
have to step back and understand, I think, largely happened
here to Mr. Kerrivan and in this case.
Now, the first question you're going to be asked on
the Verdict Form -- well, the first issue you are going to be
dealing with is whether Mr. Kerrivan is a class member. And
that's going to be two questions. I'm going to handle the
first question, and it is whether Mr. Kerrivan was addicted
to cigarettes containing nicotine.
It's Demonstrative 11, Willow.
And I think it's up on the screen, so you can see
it. So that would be the question. Was Kenneth Kerrivan
addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine?
And I'm not going to waste time to show you the
burden of proof. But before you make any decision on any
question on the Verdict Form, please -- please go back to the
09:21:00
09:21:02
09:21:07
09:21:10
09:21:15
09:21:16
09:21:22
09:21:25
09:21:29
09:21:32
09:21:37
09:21:41
09:21:43
09:21:48
09:21:51
09:21:55
09:21:57
09:22:00
09:22:02
09:22:07
09:22:10
09:22:13
09:22:15
09:22:17
09:22:20
15 written instructions that Judge Erickson gives you about what
the burden of proof is, and it's exactly what we've been
saying all along.
Our burden -- this isn't a criminal case. You can
have doubt. If somebody has a little doubt, there's nothing
wrong with that. And you can tell them -- remember, it's
okay to have doubt, because what we have to show -- all we
have to show is, is it more likely true than not, okay? Did
we tip the scales ever so slightly in our favor with the
evidence?
And so that's the burden of proof that you use, and
it's right there in the instructions, and make sure people
apply it.
We don't have to go all the way -- you know, a
football game -- a lot of football going on now. We don't
have to go all the way, 100 yards, 100 percent, to the goal
line. We've got to get to the 50 yard line and push it over.
And that's what we have to do.
And I don't mean to minimize it, okay? I don't
mean to minimize that. We need to meet our burden. But you
have to understand it's what is -- all the evidence you've
heard, no outside bias, what is more likely true than not
from the evidence you heard?
And we brought you Dr. Grunberg, Neil Grunberg.
His credentials are impeccable. He doesn't testify a lot. I
09:22:24
09:22:26
09:22:29
09:22:30
09:22:33
09:22:36
09:22:39
09:22:41
09:22:46
09:22:49
09:22:49
09:22:53
09:22:55

09:23:12

09:23:18
09:23:21
09:23:23
09:23:27
16 think he said he has only testified ten times, ever, in
tobacco and health cases.
He worked with Surgeon General Koop, one of the
most famous Surgeon Generals that people remember. You know
the Amish beard he talked about?
He works with the Department of Defense and advises
them on these very issues.
He wrote -- and I don't have his copy because he
took it back. He wrote the 1988 Surgeon General's Report,
okay? Here's the 2010 and the 2014. He wrote the 1988 one,
the orange one that we looked at.
And just to be clear -- I don't want there to be
any doubt, okay? Mr. Kerrivan -- okay, we stand with the
Surgeon General of the United States. We proudly are with
the Surgeon General, all right? That's our side.
Our side over here in this case, we are proud to
stand with the Surgeon General of the United States from 1964
on. And that's where we are.
And as you look at the evidence and weigh the
evidence, I want you to consider and think about where was
Philip Morris and where was R.J. Reynolds and who did they
stand with and who did they attack?
Dr. Grunberg was a central part of that. You heard
him say, you know, we studied this thing for two years. We
do all this amazing science. Then years later, in the '90s,
09:23:31
09:23:35
09:23:36
09:23:40
09:23:45
09:23:46
09:23:48
09:23:50
09:23:52
09:23:55
09:24:00
09:24:01
09:24:06
09:24:11
09:24:15
09:24:18
09:24:21
09:24:26
09:24:29
09:24:31
09:24:33
09:24:36
09:24:38
09:24:42
09:24:46
17 all these documents come out; and he realizes these guys are
beating us by 20 or 30 years on the information they had.
And Dr. Grunberg told you -- we won't go back
through it, but he showed you -- he drew the brain --
remember? -- and all that stuff, and he explained to you how
nicotine receptors work and how when you're a kid, you're
more vulnerable to this when you're a teenage years because
your brain is still forming and nicotine receptors are
expanding. And he gave you the science. He told you about
-- I mean, I said this in opening, but I hope the evidence
established this and showed its true.
We are created in the most amazing way. I mean, we
have these built-in protection devices, okay, that the
cigarette is engineered to bypass.
We have this -- the blood brain barrier. Do you
remember the Saran Wrap? And it's supposed to keep chemicals
like this from coming out. But when you make free nicotine,
when you change the pH enough to get that free nicotine, it
goes through the blood brain barrier.
And I think Miss London will talk to you more about
how -- the amazing ways our lungs are made, and we talked
about that.
And the cigarette is designed -- and Dr. Grunberg
told you that the nicotine levels are set specifically to
keep people addicted, and they know it. Not too high, not
09:24:51
09:24:54
09:24:58
09:25:02
09:25:06
09:25:09
09:25:13
09:25:16
09:25:20
09:25:23
09:25:26
09:25:28
09:25:33
09:25:41
09:25:45
09:25:49
09:25:52
09:25:55
09:25:58
09:26:00
09:26:02
09:26:05
09:26:05
09:26:10
09:26:14
18 too low, just right.
And Dr. Grunberg told you about how addiction
works. He talked to you about how you determine someone is
addicted. He is the only witness -- there was no witness
that the defense brought into this courtroom to tell you that
Mr. Kerrivan was not addicted.
You actually also heard from Dr. Shah, as well, on
the topic. But Dr. Grunberg really walked you through, and
he gave you the definition -- the only definition you've
gotten from any side was the definition from the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, that it's a chronic relapsing brain
disease, okay? Use -- compulsive use, despite harm.
And Dr. Grunberg told you how he walked through --
he interviewed Mr. Kerrivan. He reviewed all the documents.
He reviewed medical records, by the way. Not only did Dr.
Shah talk about addiction, but Mr. Kerrivan's previous
doctors had written in medical records "nicotine withdrawal,
tobacco abuse." Those are in the records. Are those medical
doctors just making it up? They don't meet the standards of
Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, these medical doctors?
Where was the -- where -- where is the witness from
Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds to explain to you why he
wasn't addicted?
What's more likely true than not? Weigh the actual
evidence you heard.
09:26:21
09:26:23
09:26:26
09:26:29
09:26:33
09:26:36
09:26:38
09:26:41
09:26:44
09:26:48
09:26:52
09:26:56
09:27:03
09:27:05
09:27:08
09:27:12
09:27:17
09:27:21
09:27:26
09:27:30
09:27:34
09:27:39
09:27:41
09:27:45
09:27:50
19 Dr. Grunberg talked about his -- started as a young
kid. Goes -- tolerance -- remember he talked about
tolerance, and he built up from just, you know, a half a pack
a day -- when he was 16 years old, he was smoking a little
under a half a pack or about a half a pack a day, and then it
just continues to grow and grow and grow. He gets to two,
three, four packs a day. He's smoking the lights. Gets up
even higher, which is exactly what Philip Morris and
R.J. Reynolds wanted him to do. Buy a pack, smoke all of it,
put it -- buy another one, smoke that. They don't blame
people for smoking one pack or two packs, do they?
You heard Mr. Heimann say that on the video. He
did exactly what they wanted him to do. He kept building up
his tolerance.
He smoked first thing in the morning when his feet
hit the ground. Dr. Grunberg told you about how important
that was and all throughout the day.
And then they made this big stink in the evidence
about, what happened at the wedding of his daughters -- of
his daughter? That's addiction. You're at your daughter's
wedding. You can't put it down. You're like this with your
daughter and horrified that now we have this fight over this.
I'm not like that, he said. That's addiction. What else is
it?
He quit -- all the times he tried to quit. He
09:27:51
09:27:54
09:27:57
09:28:00
09:28:02
09:28:05
09:28:07
09:28:11
09:28:14
09:28:18
09:28:22
09:28:24
09:28:27
09:28:30
09:28:31
09:28:35
09:28:37
09:28:41
09:28:43
09:28:47

09:29:02
09:29:08
09:29:09
20 tried to quit before Florida, before he made his move to
Florida, so before the COPD, and New Year's resolutions and
after and the gum and the patch and all the various ways.
His medical records show he was trying all the time. He said
he was trying all the time. And what happened? Withdrawal
symptoms: Irritable, anxious, nervous.
"I became kind of a pain that I didn't -- I wasn't
like that. I wasn't that guy, but when I didn't have my
cigarettes, I was that guy. I wasn't myself."
Dr. Grunberg walked you through all of that and
explained. He didn't just say it's more likely right than
wrong that Mr. Kerrivan was addicted. He said, there is no
doubt in my mind. Goal line, all the way, 100 percent, 100
yards on that football field. No doubt in his mind that
Mr. Kerrivan was addicted.
So when you answer that first question, I don't
think there is any doubt. And he talked to you about the
addiction liability of different drugs, 80 percent of people,
especially when you start has a kid, you're more likely to
become addicted. And that's what happened here. That's the
evidence. That's the evidence you consider in answering this
question.
And we submit that the answer is clearly yes by the
preponderance of the evidence.
Now, I will point out one thing. You are not going
09:29:14
09:29:17
09:29:22
09:29:26
09:29:30
09:29:33
09:29:35
09:29:38

09:30:25
09:30:28
09:30:29
21 to have this timeline back with you in the jury room, and so
I've tried to put years and exhibit numbers down, because you
will have the exhibits back there, and I urge you to read
them. Take the time to read them. This is your time. Not a
lot of people have been able to go through these documents.
And Dr. Proctor is like one of the few people -- he
wrote big books about it. He's like one of the few people to
really -- in the world to be able to go through all this
stuff.
And you have this chance. Those are the exhibits
over there that are going to be back in the room, and walk
through some of this.
But one of them that I think is interesting,
Exhibit 94. The lawyers remind us, okay -- the lawyers
remind us we can't defend smoking as free choice if the
person was addicted.
And I want you to think -- and that document is in
the 1980s. I want you to think about the motivation of
Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds on this question of addiction
and what it means when they have to admit addiction.
Now I'm going to turn it over to Miss London
because she's going to handle the next two questions, which
are, did addiction cause the COPD and did all the cigarettes
he smoke contribute to that COPD?
She's going to talk to you for about 15 minutes or
09:30:37
09:30:43
09:30:46
09:30:49

09:31:52
09:31:57
09:32:00
22 so, and then I'm going to come back and finish the rest of
the Verdict Form, okay?
Thank you.


MS. LONDON: Good morning. Again, my name is Sarah
London, and I am very proud to be here representing
Mr. Kerrivan.
As Mr. Byrd said, it's been a long journey for him,
20 years to come here before you and become an Engle class
member.
And I'm going to just carry the torch here for a
little while. And please forgive me if it's a little longer
than 15 minutes. I'll do my best. There's a lot to cover.
I, too, am very, very grateful for your service. I
was sitting here a little closer to you, and I'm so impressed
with your careful attention; and I know you are all paying
very close attention and giving this case the attention it
deserves, and we thank you for that.
It's hard to have a one-sided conversation. So as
I was trying to prepare my remarks, I wanted to anticipate
what I could say that might help you to do your job, to
decide the facts that you have to decide in this case and to
administer justice.
So as Mr. Byrd said, I'm going to focus just on
09:32:03
09:32:05
09:32:09
09:32:11
09:32:12
09:32:19
09:32:23
09:32:26
09:32:27
09:32:30
09:32:34
09:32:35
09:32:39
09:32:42
09:32:45
09:32:49
09:32:52
09:32:56
09:32:59
09:33:00
09:33:04
09:33:08
09:33:12
09:33:16
09:33:18
23 questions two and three on your Verdict Form, whether
Mr. Kerrivan gets into the Engle class and whether these
cigarettes manufactured by Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds
were a cause of his COPD.
Now, I don't want to insult your intelligence, and
I want to respect your time. So please forgive me if what I
say to you sounds obvious; but, frankly, I think when you
weigh all the evidence on these two questions, from what
we've showed you here in the courtroom, the answers really
are obvious.
And that's the word that Dr. Shah actually said. I
thought that was just about right. Remember I asked him on
the stand about these questions, did nicotine addiction cause
the disease? And he paused for a second, and he looked at
me, and he said, it's obvious.
And Dr. Shah, remember, was the doctor that treated
Mr. Kerrivan and still treats Mr. Kerrivan. He doesn't have
a dog in this fight.
All right. So let's start with question two.
Would you mind pulling up question two on the
Verdict Form just to show the jury what that is? There it
is.
All right. Was addiction to cigarettes containing
nicotine a legal cause of Mr. Kerrivan's COPD?
So again, this one with the burden of proof, just
09:33:21
09:33:25
09:33:29
09:33:33
09:33:35
09:33:42
09:33:45
09:33:50
09:33:54
09:33:57
09:33:58
09:34:00
09:34:03
09:34:06
09:34:10
09:34:14
09:34:17
09:34:19
09:34:20
09:34:24
09:34:27
09:34:53
09:34:54
09:34:58
09:35:01
24 more likely right than wrong, was Mr. Kerrivan's addiction a
legal cause?
All right. So here's this term "legal cause." And
you're going to be instructed or you already were instructed
on what that term means, but I want to go over it because
it's very important.
Willow, can you pull up the instruction on legal
cause? I believe it's instruction ten from your preliminary
instructions.
(Discussion off the record.)
MS. LONDON: Can you just put it on the Elmo,
Mr. Byrd?
THE COURT: We'll turn on the Elmo.
MS. LONDON: Your Honor, I think that we may have
an updated version of this instruction on legal cause for
class membership, perhaps.
THE COURT: Well, the instructions I read I have
here -- I didn't really organize anything. I just stuck it
in a file folder, so I have to find it.
MS. LONDON: That's okay. It's the same definition
of legal cause.
THE LAW CLERK: It might be renumbered.
MS. LONDON: Oh, it might be renumbered. Okay.
All right. Go ahead and put that up. Thanks.
Okay. So here's the definition of legal cause.
09:35:04
09:35:08
09:35:09
09:35:12
09:35:15
09:35:18
09:35:19
09:35:22
09:35:33
09:35:37
09:35:40
09:35:42
09:35:51
09:35:54
09:35:56
09:35:59
09:36:06
09:36:08
09:36:17
09:36:19
09:36:21
09:36:22
09:36:25
09:36:27
09:36:30
25 And right there it says "wrongful conduct." But this
definition of legal cause also applies here as to whether
addiction was a legal cause or whether smoking cigarettes was
a legal cause. That definition doesn't change throughout
your whole consideration of the case.
So I want to focus on what this says here.
Oh, thank you.
All right. Wrongful -- a legal cause, something is
a legal cause of someone's injury, including the legal cause
of damages resulting from someone's injury, if it directly
and in a natural and continuous sequence produces or
contributes substantially to producing such injury so that it
can reasonably be said that but for the wrongful conduct or
but for the addiction, the injury would not have occurred.
In order to be regarded as a legal cause of injury,
the condition or conduct need not be the only cause.
Something may be a legal cause of injury even though it
operates in combination with the act of another, some natural
cause or some other cause if the condition or conduct
contributes substantially to producing such injury.
All right. Now, there's lots and lots and lots of
causes here, and you'll have these instructions back there.
Each one of you, I think, will have a copy, so you can look
at it yourself. And I don't mean any disrespect to the
judge, but I think this one is kind of hard to understand.
09:36:41
09:36:43
09:36:47
09:36:50
09:36:53
09:36:56
09:36:59
09:37:00
09:37:03
09:37:08
09:37:11
09:37:14
09:37:18
09:37:22
09:37:26
09:37:29
09:37:33
09:37:37
09:37:40
09:37:43
09:37:46
09:37:51
09:37:53
09:37:56
09:37:59
26 So I want to try to break it down for you and give you some
ways to talk about it with one another.
At the bottom line, for Mr. Kerrivan to get into
the Engle class, we needed to show you that more likely right
than wrong, his addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine
contributed substantially to his COPD.
And what does substantial mean? Now, that word
isn't going to be defined for you in these instructions. So
that's something that we have to think about in our common
usage. What is substantial? Not insubstantial. Made a
difference. Played a role. Real. Actual. Contributed.
So, essentially, did Mr. Kerrivan's addiction to
cigarettes containing nicotine play a role in his COPD?
And this next part is key, right? We don't have to
show that his addiction to the cigarettes was the only cause.
There can be many causes that contribute substantially to an
injury. And that makes sense, right?
Addiction -- there can be many causes for things.
There's not always just one thing that causes one other
thing. And the law recognizes that.
Addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine just
needs to be a cause, a reason, played a role, in his COPD.
And I suggest that actually -- again, I think
Dr. Shah actually gave us the best way to think about that,
again, Dr. Shah, Mr. Kerrivan's treating physician.
09:38:03
09:38:06
09:38:10
09:38:15
09:38:19
09:38:23
09:38:26
09:38:29
09:38:32
09:38:36
09:38:39
09:38:44
09:38:47
09:38:50
09:38:55
09:38:59
09:39:02
09:39:05
09:39:08
09:39:11
09:39:12
09:39:16
09:39:21
09:39:27
09:39:30
27 And here's what he said. He said, nicotine
addiction caused the repeated exposure to the toxins in the
cigarettes. And that exposure to the toxins in the
cigarettes caused the COPD.
So nicotine addiction caused the COPD.
Obvious, right? That's the chain of causation.
And, Willow, I think we have a slide on this.
Oh, I'm sorry. Can we switch from the Elmo?
THE COURTROOM DEPUTY: I did.
MS. LONDON: All right. So this is the A causes B,
B causes C. So then A causes C, right?
So I'm going to start with this first part, how
addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine causes the
repeated exposure to the toxins in cigarettes.
Now, I'm not going to repeat what Mr. Byrd said,
and I know you heard all the evidence about nicotine
addiction, and I know you were paying close attention. But I
just want to pick up a few things.
What does nicotine addiction do? It causes changes
in the brain. It creates those receptors that grow and grow.
It creates a need to have another dose, to fill those
receptors over and over to feel normal.
Remember what Dr. Grunberg said: Nicotine is an
amazing drug. Up when you're down; down when you're up.
It's the most potent drug-delivery device ever engineered,
09:39:33
09:39:36
09:39:40
09:39:44
09:39:47
09:39:51
09:39:58
09:40:08
09:40:10
09:40:17
09:40:20
09:40:24
09:40:29
09:40:32
09:40:35
09:40:37
09:40:40
09:40:43
09:40:44
09:40:49
09:40:54
09:40:57
09:41:01
09:41:05
09:41:09
28 the cigarette.
And the cigarette companies knew this for decades.
They studied it carefully. Remember, we showed you an
exhibit where they were -- it said the pre-learner -- or the
pre-smoker and the learner smoker and then the addicted
smoker. And there's a line for why they smoke or what are
the factors that matter. And it said nicotine and for that
smoker plus, plus, plus.
That's what addiction does. You need that dose of
nicotine. Keep pushing that lever, like Pavlov's dog, to get
that reward. That's what addiction does. It creates a need
for the next dose.
It leaves you unsatisfied.
Now, not only did the cigarette companies know
this, because they researched it, of course, for decades and
honed their research to fully understand why -- what nicotine
addiction is and how it works, but they exploited it to
profit off of it. They used that sophisticated research to
keep the exit gates closed. To not only hook people, but to
keep them hooked, to sustain that addiction.
They engineered literally every aspect of this
cigarette, taking the nicotine -- even genetically
engineering those plants, taking it out and putting it back
in and spraying it on a sheet, setting it at that optimal
level to give that addicted smoker the dose they need to need
09:41:14
09:41:16
09:41:18
09:41:22
09:41:26
09:41:29
09:41:35
09:41:38
09:41:41
09:41:45
09:41:51
09:41:54
09:41:56
09:41:59
09:42:02
09:42:06
09:42:10
09:42:14
09:42:17
09:42:22
09:42:26
09:42:30
09:42:34
09:42:36
09:42:40
29 another dose and another dose and another dose.
How low can we go? Remember that? That's what
they were trying to do. How low can we go to keep our
smokers -- our customers coming back, our repeat business?
They used ammonia and chemicals, changed the pH,
holes in the filter. You heard all this evidence. I'm not
going to go back through all of it. But, boy, does it work.
Boy, did they get repeat business. Boy, does that nicotine
addiction keep somebody hooked for as long -- for a very long
time. And you saw the evidence of how many millions of
people in America got hooked and got sick. That's the power
of nicotine addiction. That's what it does. That's why it
keeps you smoking.
I keep coming back to this, but it really impressed
me. Dr. Shah, he described this also really well, what
nicotine addiction does, right? He treats thousands of
patients with COPD, including Mr. Kerrivan, more than 20
years of experience. And he said, "Look, addiction keeps
people smoking. He's, like, even after doctors tell them to
stop, even when they know it's bad for them, people aren't
stupid. People are educated. Even the smartest, most
educated people that he treats know how bad it is for them,
or have COPD. Why they keep smoking? Nicotine addiction.
That's what it does, it keeps you smoking.
And you saw how nicotine addiction, addiction to
09:42:43
09:42:46
09:42:49
09:42:52
09:42:56

09:43:59
09:44:04
09:44:08
09:44:09
30 cigarettes containing nicotine, affected Mr. Kerrivan. He
needed more cigarettes every day, once he became addicted, to
fill up those nicotine receptors, one, two, three, up to four
packs of cigarettes a day.
Let's just for a moment -- we keep saying packs of
cigarettes a day. But, like, really think about that. Okay?
Three packs of cigarettes a day is 60 cigarettes a day. If
it's ten minutes to smoke a cigarette, we're literally
talking about spending every waking minute smoking a
cigarette. That's what nicotine addiction does. It
continually -- the next dose and all those chemicals that
come right along with it.
When he tried to stop, you heard from him about his
intense cravings, the shakes, the nervousness, when his brain
didn't have what he needed, as an addicted smoker, that's the
way he felt. And that's consistent with, as Dr. Grunberg
told you, with exactly what happens to addicted smokers and
how they feel.
That little voice in his head that said, "Smoke me
smoke me," still in his dreams. Nicotine addiction is
exactly why he kept smoking.
Even up to four -- three, four packs a day after
he's sick, even after his doctors told him to stop over and
over and over again. And, of course, even after he saw his
friends -- his dear friends get sick and die from smoking.
09:44:13
09:44:16
09:44:19
09:44:23
09:44:25

09:44:35
09:44:38
09:44:40
09:44:45
09:44:49
09:44:50
09:44:53

09:45:19
09:45:22
09:45:26
09:45:30
31 So why did Mr. Kerrivan continue to expose himself
to these toxins in cigarettes? Nicotine addiction. That was
the whole reason Dr. Grunberg and the Surgeon General went
out and studied this question. We're putting all this
information out there. We're telling Americans, "Stop.
Don't. It's bad for you." Why do people keep doing this?
Are they dumb? Do they not want to live? Do they just
love the -- do they just love smoking more than they like
their family and their life?
No. Nicotine addiction does something. It
gives -- it creates the need for the next dose, and you smoke
despite harm, and that's exactly what happened here.
And, again, no witness came in here to tell you
anything else, to tell you any other reason caused his
repeated exposure to those cigarettes.
No one came in and said, "Oh, he smoked just for
fun or the addiction played no role at all. You didn't see
that."
As you heard through this trial over and over
again -- and I apologize if this became repetitive, but I
think it's so critical and important for all of our
understanding of this case -- that the Surgeon General of the
United States -- and you heard from the witnesses' mouths, I
believe every doctor that came in here -- that nicotine
addiction is the fundamental reason that people persist in
09:45:35
09:45:40
09:45:44
09:45:48
09:45:50
09:45:54
09:45:57
09:46:02
09:46:04
09:46:05
09:46:09
09:46:12
09:46:14
09:46:20
09:46:25
09:46:28
09:46:31
09:46:35
09:46:35
09:46:38
09:46:41
09:46:44
09:46:48
09:46:51
09:46:53
32 exposing themselves to the toxins in cigarettes, the
fundamental reason.
Even Mr. Gentry, now he agreed it was a fundamental
reason.
And, of course, use your common sense. Why would
the company spend so much money and spend all this time
researching and studying and designing ways to sustain
nicotine addiction, if it didn't do any good, if it didn't
create that repeat business, if it didn't keep people smoking
long after they know it's bad for them? That's why they did
it. That's how they designed the cigarettes. That's how
nicotine addiction works. It causes you to keep smoking.
That's what it is.
So the first part of this chain of causation, yes,
more likely right than wrong and beyond that, we proved to
you that the nicotine addiction was a cause, contributed
substantially to Mr. Kerrivan getting all of those toxins in
the cigarettes that caused his COPD.
Now, the second part is a little easier. It's
about whether the repeated exposure to the toxins in
cigarettes, whether that caused his COPD. And, frankly, as
you know, this part is not even in dispute, really. Even the
doctor that Philip Morris brought to you, he agreed. He said
no question that the exposure to the cigarettes caused his
COPD. Every doctor said that. And, in fact, they were
09:46:58
09:47:01
09:47:03
09:47:06
09:47:06
09:47:09
09:47:12
09:47:15
09:47:20
09:47:23
09:47:26
09:47:28
09:47:31
09:47:32
09:47:36
09:47:40
09:47:43
09:47:48
09:47:49
09:47:57
09:48:01
09:48:04
09:48:10
09:48:14
09:48:16
33 certain.
So let's put that together. As Dr. Shah said,
"It's obvious. The addiction to nicotine, to cigarettes
containing nicotine, that's what substantially contributed
and far more than that, the fundamental reason Mr. Kerrivan
was exposed to so many cigarettes, and that exposure to so
many cigarettes is what caused his COPD."
All right. Now, if in deliberations -- and I echo
absolutely everything that Mr. Byrd said. You do have a very
important job back there as jurors. In addition to sitting
there and listening to all this evidence, you'll have an
opportunity and, in fact, an obligation to go back there and
talk about the evidence and how you feel. You have to
explain to each other how you feel. That's part of your job
in your deliberations.
So if somebody in deliberations says, "You know
what? No one held a gun to his head. I think it's a choice.
And even if he was addicted, he always had the choice to
smoke."
I want you to remind them that, as Dr. Grunberg
told us, again, the world leading expert on this,
addiction -- for a heavily addicted smoker, you really
essentially have almost no free choice. It's the addiction
interfering with your free choice. It interferes with you
acting as a rational person, to take care of yourself.
09:48:19
09:48:19
09:48:23
09:48:28
09:48:31
09:48:33
09:48:38
09:48:40
09:48:44
09:48:50
09:48:52
09:48:53
09:48:56
09:49:00
09:49:03
09:49:04
09:49:07
09:49:12
09:49:15
09:49:16
09:49:20
09:49:27
09:49:30
09:49:34
09:49:37
34 That's how addiction works. It's a brain disease that gets
in the way of you exercising your free choice.
And just briefly, let's talk about this word
choice, right? So a choice is, "Am I going to have tuna
salad or egg salad for lunch? Who am I going to vote for
governor?"
You're not addicted to somebody running for
governor. You're not addicted to egg salad. You can make a
free choice in those circumstances. But for an addicted
smoker, whether to have another cigarette, yeah, that's not a
free choice, right? What's going on in your brain, that's
having an effect on your choices.
It's kind of like when you ring the bell, you don't
have a choice of whether to salivate. That's how it's
working. It's automatic. It's almost automatic in your
brain.
And if you can, pull up what the Surgeon General of
the United States has said about this, just most recently.
This is evidence back there. I believe it's Exhibit 1823.
Where the Surgeon General, when they studied the power of
nicotine addiction, and I don't want to remind you all of the
studies and all that goes into preparing these reports, but
their conclusion was, of course, the reality is that smoking
is not usually a choice. Tobacco use is an addiction, and
nicotine is the primary drug in tobacco that causes
09:49:40
09:49:43
09:49:46
09:49:50
09:49:54
09:49:58
09:49:59
09:50:01
09:50:04
09:50:07
09:50:11
09:50:14
09:50:17
09:50:20
09:50:23
09:50:26
09:50:28
09:50:31
09:50:39
09:50:57
09:50:59
09:51:04
09:51:08
09:51:11
09:51:15
35 addiction. And over time, the brain cells of the smokers are
changed.
You can go back when you're in the jury room and I
encourage you if somebody is saying, "Maybe it's choice," to
go back and look at this and look at what the United States
Surgeon General has said on this very question.
Of course, you didn't hear anything from the other
side. They brought you no witness to tell you otherwise.
You know -- you can take that down. Thank you.
If somebody is really stuck on this idea of choice,
you can remind them that it's fine, it's okay to think that
choice plays a role in why somebody continues to smoke.
That's fine. There can be multiple causes and, in fact, I
have a slide that -- and, by the way, it's just like the
cigarette companies' choices to engineer the product the way
they do, to sustain addiction. That can be a cause. All of
these things can be a cause.
Why don't you pull that up? I'm sorry. Slide two.
All right. This is my best effort at trying to put
this in a way that -- to help explain it.
So you can think a lot of things combined to cause
Mr. Kerrivan's COPD, right? And we've sure put on a lot of
evidence of a number of different things that contributed.
So you can think that you see personal choice there? You can
think that was a cause, that that was something that caused
09:51:17
09:51:21
09:51:21
09:51:24
09:51:28
09:51:31
09:51:33
09:51:35
09:51:37
09:51:44
09:51:48
09:51:52
09:51:56
09:52:00
09:52:03
09:52:07
09:52:11
09:52:12
09:52:22
09:52:26
09:52:31
09:52:35
09:52:39
09:52:41
09:52:45
36 it.
You can think that the conspiracy and the campaign
of doubt and all the things that the industry did to conceal
the truth and hide information from Americans, and
particularly when he was young, you can believe that that's a
cause. I certainly think that's what the evidence will show.
Mr. Byrd will talk more about that. And you can think that
marketing to children and getting them hooked when they were
young, that that was a cause of Mr. Kerrivan continuing to
smoke.
And these filters and these lights, you can think
that's a cause, and I believe the evidence absolutely shows
that, too.
All of these things substantially contribute. They
go into that sort of funnel and come down and work together
in combination.
But, number one, right there, the fundamental
reason that Mr. Kerrivan continues to smoke and got sick:
Nicotine addiction.
So all you need to -- so at the end of the day, as
long as we showed more likely right than wrong, and I believe
we've shown it far beyond that, to the 100 yard line, as Mr.
Byrd said, that more likely right than wrong, the reason --
Mr. Kerrivan's addiction was a reason, the reason, the most
important reason that he's sitting here today.
09:52:47
09:52:48
09:52:51
09:52:53
09:52:57
09:53:00
09:53:03
09:53:06
09:53:08
09:53:11
09:53:13
09:53:15
09:53:19
09:53:19
09:53:22
09:53:25
09:53:26
09:53:29
09:53:34
09:53:35
09:53:39
09:53:42
09:53:47
09:53:52
09:53:58
37 Now, just on this point, and if somebody says,
"Well, I think he could have quit," and I think that will
probably be a big part of the defense that you'll hear.
Certainly, I believe that's why they brought Dr. Brodnan in
was to try to show you, "Well, I think he could have quit."
I'm not entirely sure where he fits in. He seemed
like a very nice doctor, but I'm not entirely sure how much
he offered you in terms of how to answer the questions before
you.
But in any event, see on there, you can see the
failed quit attempts, right, or his inability to quit or even
his lack of trying to quit was a cause. That surely can fit
in there. But I submit to you, of course, as you heard from
Dr. Grunberg, that not quitting, that addiction plays a role
in not quitting, right, and continuing to smoke and not
wanting to go through the pain and discomfort of withdrawal.
All of that plays a role. It all works together.
And it's fine, you can think that failure to quit
is a cause. So long as -- and nicotine addiction is also a
cause. And on the flip side, of course, you could find that
these companies, the fact that they -- if they had come clean
when they knew what they -- when they knew how bad these
products were for them and followed through on their promise
to stop selling them, if they had quit selling them, we
wouldn't be here either, right? Just like if Mr. Kerrivan,
09:54:02
09:54:06
09:54:08
09:54:11
09:54:14
09:54:18
09:54:21
09:54:24
09:54:27
09:54:28
09:54:33
09:54:36
09:54:41
09:54:43
09:54:48
09:54:50
09:54:53
09:54:57
09:55:00
09:55:04
09:55:07
09:55:11
09:55:15
09:55:17
09:55:20
38 of course, had stopped a month later or two months later
after he started, sure, of course, that could be a cause, but
it's not the only cause. And certainly nicotine addiction,
as we showed you, played a big role.
And on this point about quitting, I think this is
really important, and Mr. Byrd did talk about this a bit.
Remember that Mr. Kerrivan tried, did try to quit before he
got COPD. And not only that, as Dr. Brodnan, he admitted on
the stand, if he had quit before he switched to light
cigarettes, we wouldn't be here today, right? So certainly
those light cigarettes, certainly those light cigarettes were
a cause.
And ultimately, though, I want to make sure this is
really clear.
You can take that down. Thank you.
And I'm wrapping up, Mr. Byrd.
I want to make sure this is very clear. These
questions of what Mr. Kerrivan did or didn't do, his choice,
his failures, how hard he tried to quit, you can consider all
of that. And you will have a place on your Verdict Form
where you can express how you feel about how much
responsibility he bears, just like how much responsibility
you think the companies bear. It doesn't belong in this
question, though. This is just a simple chain of causation
question. Mr. Byrd will address that when we talk about
09:55:23
09:55:25
09:55:29
09:55:32
09:55:34
09:55:38
09:55:42
09:55:46
09:55:50
09:55:54
09:55:57
09:56:00
09:56:04
09:56:07
09:56:08
09:56:10
09:56:11
09:56:15
09:56:19
09:56:24
09:56:27
09:56:30
09:56:32
09:56:35
09:56:38
39 comparative fault.
All right. So I submit to you that when you weigh
all the evidence, far more likely right than wrong, far more,
that the answer to question two is yes, and I am just quickly
going to get through question three because I think this one
also is obvious.
If you answer yes to those questions, one and two,
and we finally get Mr. Kerrivan into the Engle class, then as
Mr. Byrd told you, those Engle findings will apply. I'm not
going to repeat anything that he said. I echo it all, but I
know it's strange to rely on what another jury did, but I
have to emphasize this, especially as I talk about the next
question. You have to treat these findings as if you heard
all the evidence and you found them yourself. They are
entitled to that much weight. It's not just law. It's fact,
and it's fact that applies in each and every one of these
questions.
So you'll have to remind that to each other and use
that to answer the next question.
All right. Question three: Please state as to
each defendant whether smoking cigarettes manufactured by
that defendant was a legal cause of Kenneth Kerrivan's COPD.
All right. Now, you're going to need an Engle
finding for this one; and, that is, the Engle jury already
decided that both Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds placed
09:56:40
09:56:41
09:56:46
09:56:49
09:56:52
09:56:56
09:56:57
09:57:02
09:57:07
09:57:10
09:57:12
09:57:16
09:57:20
09:57:25
09:57:27
09:57:31
09:57:34
09:57:34
09:57:38
09:57:39
09:57:45
09:57:48
09:57:51
09:57:53
09:57:56
40 cigarettes on the market that were defective and unreasonably
dangerous. You already have that finding. It's part of
this, and you apply it here. You don't have to decide it.
And there it is again, legal cause, and I'm not
going to go through that again, but make sure you have that
instruction. The same deal. We only have to prove that it
was part of a continuous chain of causation, that it
contributed substantially, and doesn't have to be the only
cause.
Certainly both of these companies' cigarettes can
combine to cause it. And if that's what you find, of course,
more likely right than wrong, the answer is yes.
Now, to be clear, every witness that came to talk
to you -- or, well, let me put it this way. Dr. Grunberg
explained how every single cigarette contributed to
addiction.
Dr. Gravelyn talked about how every single
cigarette contributed to the cumulative exposure of the
disease. Dr. Shah said the same thing.
COPD is a cumulative injury; and as Mr. Byrd
explained to you about the power of the brain and all our
bodies' defenses, you know how each cigarette exposes you to
thousands of chemicals, freezes that cilia, inflames your
airways and gets your body into that -- weakens your defenses
and creates bacteria and all of that phlegm and garbage in
09:57:59
09:58:01
09:58:04
09:58:07
09:58:09
09:58:13
09:58:17
09:58:21
09:58:23
09:58:24
09:58:28
09:58:30
09:58:33
09:58:40
09:58:45
09:58:48
09:58:48
09:58:51
09:58:55
09:58:57
09:59:02
09:59:05
09:59:11
09:59:14
09:59:18
41 your lungs that creates holes and causes what we know is
COPD. Every cigarette plays a role. Every cigarette plays a
role on the path to addiction and on the cumulative injury.
Each one is a dose of both the nicotine and the poison. The
addiction and the poison comes with every dose.
And the defendant has brought you nobody to tell
you anything other than that both of these companies'
cigarettes, that his smoking of these cigarettes was a cause.
And you heard from Mr. Kerrivan on the stand about
what he smoked over the years. And you saw, as I did, that
he didn't remember everything perfectly and that he couldn't
tell you exactly the years he smoked what or exactly in what
order.
And I think there might have been some confusion
about the Camels and was it one pack in his life or a pack a
day for some years, and that's going to be up for you to
decide.
I'll submit to you it would seem a little strange
that he would remember one pack of something he smoked in his
life, like, "Oh, yeah, I only had one box of Wheaties in my
life, and I happen to have that on a picture." You can use
your common sense and, of course, judge his credibility.
Of course in that regard, in terms of judging Mr.
Kerrivan's credibility and all the witnesses, the judge has
instructed you about giving you some guidance for that and
09:59:22
09:59:26
09:59:29
09:59:32
09:59:36
09:59:39

10:00:27
10:00:29
10:00:33
10:00:36
42 whether lapses in memory are on something important or not.
And I will suggest to you as you go back to that jury room
and you talk to each other about the evidence and you look at
the answers that you have to give, that lapses in memory or
things Mr. Kerrivan wasn't so sure about, those aren't the
important details. That's like what color was the Dodge in
the getaway car, right?
On the really key stuff, the really important
things that you need to make your decision, Mr. Kerrivan was
pretty clear. And no witness came in and rebutted anything
he had to say about any of that.
Just -- there are some stipulated facts, and that's
how you'll know that the cigarettes that he smoked, the
Luckys, the Camels, the Marlboros, those were all
manufactured by these defendants and that's stipulated.
That's not in dispute.
So, finally, if somebody in deliberations says,
well, I'm just not sure exactly how much he smoked or I'm
confused about these pack years and whether that causes this,
that or the other thing, I want you to remind them about how
important those early cigarettes were, no matter how long he
smoked them, how critically important they are in the chain
of causation. Those first cigarettes that get you hooked,
those are the path to initiation cigarettes.
Dr. Grunberg said the earliest brands you smoke
10:00:39
10:00:43
10:00:46
10:00:49
10:00:53
10:00:55
10:00:58
10:01:00
10:01:03
10:01:07
10:01:10
10:01:12
10:01:17
10:01:20
10:01:23
10:01:25
10:01:27
10:01:31
10:01:35
10:01:37
10:01:41
10:01:44
10:01:47
10:01:51
10:01:53
43 when you're a teenager, when your brain is vulnerable, very
important. Ninety percent of smokers start before the age of
18. I'm sure Mr. Byrd will talk a lot more about that, and I
know he's anxious to get back up here. I promise you I'm
wrapping up.
And Dr. Gravelyn told us that, too, that those
first cigarettes are so incredibly important to putting you
on the path to disease.
We know those cigarettes mattered to Kenneth
Kerrivan. We know that, but for the cigarettes he smoked 16,
17, 18 years old, we wouldn't be here today. That's legal
cause, folks.
And we know, of course, that those cigarettes
mattered to these companies. You saw the documents. You
know how important it was to capture that youth market. So
if they come up here and say, well, we didn't play any role,
we didn't do anything, that's not what they were saying back
when no one was looking. That was exactly what they wanted,
was to get somebody on the path to addiction, get them going.
Unfortunately, I don't -- there are unfortunate
side effects to that addiction, and they said that in their
documents. But they certainly were trying to capture that
youth market, and they sure did.
So there will be a place on the Verdict Form,
though -- and remind somebody who's concerned about, I don't
10:01:55
10:01:59
10:02:02
10:02:05
10:02:07
10:02:07
10:02:10
10:02:13
10:02:15
10:02:18
10:02:22
10:02:27
10:02:28
10:02:31
10:02:34
10:02:38
10:02:41
10:02:44
10:02:47
10:02:50
10:02:55
10:02:58
10:03:00
10:03:02
10:03:05
44 know how long he smoked this brand or the other, there's a
place on the Verdict Form where you can put a percentage for
each company, right? So this question is only just whether
more likely right than wrong, even a little bit, smoking that
company's cigarettes played a role; and then you can
apportion how much responsibility to each company later on in
the Verdict Form, as Mr. Byrd will tell you.
So I submit to you that at the end of the day, with
all the evidence, the answers to questions both two and
three, straightforward, obvious -- you probably didn't me to
talk that long about that, but the answers to both of those
questions, the evidence has shown, is yes, yes as to both
defendants.
Thank you. I appreciate your time.


MR. BYRD: Thank you, Your Honor.
Let me just spend -- I'm going to try to pick it up
and spend on the remaining questions, but those questions at
the beginning are important because of class membership.
If you find he's a member of the class, one of the
things Miss London referenced is comparative fault. It is a
question that you will deal with. Because if you find he's a
member of the class, then you will -- for the negligence and
strict liability claims, comparative fault applies. They
don't apply to the intentional torts, which I'll talk about
10:03:08
10:03:10
10:03:13
10:03:17
10:03:20
10:03:22
10:03:27
10:03:29
10:03:33
10:03:36
10:03:41
10:03:44
10:03:48
10:03:48
10:03:53
10:03:54
10:03:55
10:03:59
10:04:02
10:04:04
10:04:08
10:04:12
10:04:14
10:04:18
10:04:20
45 later, but to comparative fault, they do.
We don't need to put it on the Verdict Form. It's
where you put the different percentages. It's further down
in the Verdict Form, but I want to address it now.
And, Willow, can we put number one, Demonstrative
one up, please.
So when you compare -- and I think I talked about
this is a little bit. When you compare the fault of each of
the parties, I want you to go back and really understand when
Mr. Kerrivan started smoking and what got him into this in
the first place.
Those first -- he started trying when he was 14
years old and then really started smoking every day by the
time he was 16.
And I think -- do you have Demonstrative one,
Willow?
No. Sorry. This one. (Holding up picture.)
We showed you this picture, okay? This is
11-year-old Kenneth Kerrivan. Here he is. And a couple
years later, he starts smoking.
And by the way, at this same time -- we showed you
documents -- the industry is studying 12, 14-year-olds and no
lower limit. They're studying those people.
And I'm proud to represent Mr. Kerrivan. And I
acknowledge that he's made a decision to own up and take some
10:04:22
10:04:25
10:04:28
10:04:30
10:04:32
10:04:40
10:04:42
10:04:49
10:04:51
10:04:55
10:04:58
10:04:59
10:05:03
10:05:06
10:05:07
10:05:13
10:05:14
10:05:21
10:05:25
10:05:32
10:05:37
10:05:41
10:05:47
10:05:51
10:05:56
46 fault for where he is. And that's -- that's big stuff.
That's big stuff.
And when -- when the jury is going to look and
determine how much fault to apply for the decisions he made,
I want them to think about young Mr. Kerrivan lost his dad,
seven years old. Essentially, lost his mom when he was 12.
MR. DAVIS: Your Honor, I -- there's a pretrial
ruling on this sort of stuff.
THE COURT: We want to be very careful not to make
an appeal to sympathy on that.
MR. BYRD: Sure.
But the point of that is that we showed documents
of what the industry did in peer pressure, understanding peer
pressure and getting people to smoke, and how they gave
images of trying to make people who wanted to grow up to
become adults sooner than they needed to be, those type of
targeting of teenage kids and how they did that, somebody
wanting to get older before their time. When you weigh the
comparative fault of all that, those things get to come into
consideration.
In this jury and in this courtroom -- and in this
courtroom, those things are considered, because at the same
time, the power of Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, the
knowledge that they had, okay, was 100 percent. There wasn't
any doubt that they knew what they were doing, and we showed
10:06:00
10:06:05
10:06:08
10:06:13
10:06:17
10:06:26
10:06:31
10:06:34
10:06:36
10:06:38
10:06:40
10:06:42
10:06:48
10:06:53
10:06:58
10:07:00
10:07:04
10:07:10
10:07:16
10:07:20
10:07:21
10:07:25
10:07:32
10:07:36
10:07:41
47 you the documents that showed that. There was no doubt. And
they did everything they could -- Dr. Proctor told you about
the conspiracy. They did everything they could -- you can
take that down, Willow -- to push his knowledge down to as
little as zero percent, you know, as far down as they could.
They did a campaign of doubt. They went out and lied. They
told everybody. They spent tons of money to go on television
and the newspapers and everywhere else and say it's not true.
And those are the things you have to look at.
Look at the time. Look at the knowledge and power
that the cigarette industry had at the same time that we look
at Mr. Kerrivan's actions.
Sure, sure, there was information out there trying
to warn Mr. Kerrivan. There were public service
announcements. But you saw the evidence. 365 to 1. The
public health authorities spent in a year what the industry
spent in one day. How's that? 365 to 1. How do we weigh
those percentages and how that looks?
And you're going to make up your own mind about
what percentage of fault to give to Mr. Kerrivan and the
companies.
And he has owned up, okay?
Now, Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, we'll wait to
hear from them. We'll see what percentage they suggest you
put on their side of the coin.
10:07:43
10:07:47
10:07:50
10:07:52
10:07:58
10:08:02
10:08:05
10:08:09
10:08:13
10:08:14
10:08:18
10:08:20
10:08:23
10:08:28
10:08:30
10:08:38
10:08:41
10:08:49
10:08:51
10:08:54
10:08:57
10:08:58
10:09:01
10:09:04
10:09:07
48 But for Mr. Kerrivan, I would suggest maybe put the
number where it goes. 16. He starts at 16 every day. How
about 16 percent? He smokes for 20 years. 1985 is the first
year that the warning finally says that it causes emphysema.
That's the first time. He's been smoking all that time
before then with these other warnings.
He smoked for 20 years after '85. Maybe
20 percent. Somewhere. 16 to 20 percent. That's your
decision to make. But when you do that, remember to apply --
to understand his age and where he was and how addiction was
affecting him and his choices.
Unless I just missed something, I don't think there
was any brain disease affecting the choices of Philip Morris
and R.J. Reynolds in their boardroom.
Now, this is where -- Miss London talked about it,
but this is where -- did he try hard to quit, could he quit,
and all that. That has nothing to do with -- please don't
let the defense -- they will make some arguments. Don't let
them try to write questions in the Verdict Form that aren't
there, okay?
You just answer the questions in the Verdict Form.
And you're not going to see a question in the Verdict Form on
did addiction cause disease about whether he tried to quit,
because it's not in the law a question you're supposed to
answer. It has nothing to do with what you're here to do.
10:09:10
10:09:13
10:09:19
10:09:26
10:09:29
10:09:33
10:09:34
10:09:38
10:09:41
10:09:45
10:09:49
10:09:52
10:09:55
10:09:58
10:10:01
10:10:07
10:10:10
10:10:13
10:10:18
10:10:22
10:10:23
10:10:25
10:10:29
10:10:32
10:10:34
49 The only place that whether he tried to quit or how
hard he tried to quit plays a role is in this comparative
fault question.
MR. DAVIS: Your Honor, that's a mistake in the
law.
THE COURT: Let's come here and have a little
conversation.
[#DELETED BENCH CONFERENCE#]
MR. BYRD: So that's comparative fault. And I
suggest the 16 to 20 percent range. How you divide it up
among the defendants will be -- you know, he clearly smoked a
lot more Philip Morris products, the Marlboros and Marlboro
Lights, than he did R.J. Reynolds products. But the reason I
think they're probably equally responsible here, however you
10:15:03
10:15:08
10:15:13
10:15:15
10:15:18
10:15:21
10:15:25
10:15:30
10:15:32
10:15:35
10:15:38
10:15:42
10:15:46
10:15:49
10:15:53
10:15:56
10:15:57
10:15:58
10:15:59
10:16:00
10:16:04
10:16:09
10:16:12
10:16:17
10:16:20
53 divide that up, is that the Lucky Strikes, the Camels are in
his early years, teenage years. Those are the most important
cigarettes in the whole bunch. And if he hadn't started on
the Lucky Strikes in 16, 17, 18 years of age, we wouldn't be
here.
By the way, Dr. Brodnan, who they did bring you, he
said we wouldn't be here if it hadn't been for those lights,
the Marlboro Lights. I want you to think about that, because
there's going to be this year, 1982, that you're asked about.
And I want you to think about those lights that he started
smoking and went on instead of the regular cigarettes.
Willow, can we bring up number six, Demonstrative
number six?
When he's a member of the Engle class -- you are
then going to have -- the other two claims we have are the
intentional torts, the fraudulent concealment and conspiracy,
okay? And there's a few questions that go hand-in-hand with
all of these. So I'm going to kind of address all these
questions on fraudulent concealment and the conspiracy
together, all right?
But the most important thing here to understand is
you have to go back to the Engle findings -- they're written
there for you. They're right here -- and read them, because
when you -- once you get to these questions, he already is a
member of the Engle class. So, therefore, these findings
10:16:24
10:16:28
10:16:33
10:16:37
10:16:42
10:16:45
10:16:48
10:16:51
10:16:53
10:16:56
10:16:59
10:17:02
10:17:10
10:17:10
10:17:12
10:17:15
10:17:18
10:17:20
10:17:24
10:17:25
10:17:26
10:17:30
10:17:32
10:17:36
10:17:39
54 apply. No matter what, they apply.
And you take the finding -- so, therefore, these
are true and you must accept them, plus did it affect
Mr. Kerrivan? And we think the evidence has shown that it
does, and that's how you get to a "yes" on did he justify --
did he rely on statements? Did he rely on these acts and
omissions that the companies engaged in?
Of course, he did. I mean, the FTC reports are
clear. The advertising that happened, for example, was
unavoidable. It was unavoidable to anybody in America. It
was everywhere.
Did he rely -- Yeah, every time he lit up that
cigarette, every time he lights up that cigarette, he's
relying on their conduct and their actions throughout the
years.
And then there's going to be questions before 1982
or after 1982. And the box we submit that you should check
is both before and after. There's a box that says, was it
both before and after '82? Of course, it was. Because we
showed you clearly, and Dr. Proctor showed you, that the
conspiracy started in 1953, and their concealments and
omissions continued all the way up until 1999.
So did it happen before 1982? Of course.
Did it happen after 1982? Of course.
And these findings -- if you look at number four,
10:17:41
10:17:43
10:17:50
10:17:54
10:17:56
10:18:00
10:18:04
10:18:06
10:18:12
10:18:14
10:18:18
10:18:19
10:18:23
10:18:26
10:18:28
10:18:28
10:18:31
10:18:36
10:18:40
10:18:43
10:18:46
10:18:50
10:18:53
10:18:56
10:18:58
55 "The Engle defendants, including R.J. Reynolds and Philip
Morris, concealed or omitted material information not
otherwise known or available, knowing that the material was
false and misleading and failed to disclose a material fact
concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking
or both."
And then number five follows that. It's the
conspiracy. They agreed in concert, right? You can read
that. That's what Dr. Proctor was talking about about the
conspiracy. It started at the Plaza Hotel, and it didn't
stop all the way through -- this evidence we showed you, up
at least until 2000 here, where they finally admit, oh, well,
smoking does finally cause disease. I mean, in 1994 they are
still lying to Congress about it.
And in 1999 they finally admit smoking causes
disease and smoking can be addictive. But you heard from
Mr. Gentry and Mr. Jupe, and you get to weigh what they said
and their credibility, as well, because there are some things
that they are not willing to say.
And you judge the credibility of Mr. Jupe and
Mr. Gentry about whether they're really agreeing with the
Surgeon General anymore or whether they still are fighting
that addiction doesn't really cause disease, because I don't
know what a chain of causation is. I don't really understand
that.
10:19:02
10:19:05
10:19:07
10:19:10
10:19:13
10:19:16
10:19:17
10:19:19
10:19:23
10:19:26
10:19:29
10:19:32
10:19:37
10:19:41
10:19:44
10:19:47
10:19:51
10:19:55
10:19:57
10:20:01
10:20:05
10:20:09
10:20:11
10:20:13
10:20:16
56 So those are the questions on the intentional
torts. We think -- and the instructions. I won't go over
them. They're pretty detailed. Please read the instructions
about how you find that these findings, once they apply,
essentially mean -- plus the evidence you heard about
Mr. Kerrivan, that they are liable.
And Miss London talked to you about, you know, you
can have several causes. We only need to show that it was a
legal cause. And let me give you an example because, you
know, was the -- were their negligence and strict liability a
cause? Of course, it was. But also the fraudulent
concealment and conspiracy were also causes.
You can have several causes, as Miss London said,
to operate together. And I'll give you a little bit of an
analogy. A lot of baseball games going on right now. You
know, let's say a pitcher pitches a no-hitter in a baseball
game, okay? And so his team wins. They win like, you know,
two to nothing. His team wins. And the question is, well,
what was the cause of the win? Who caused the -- what was
the substantial contributing factor?
Well, the pitcher certainly was if he pitched a
no-hitter. Pretty good. But so were his fielders, you know,
the infielders and his team that was helping him to make sure
they got the ground ball and threw the guy out, they caught
the -- to make sure there wasn't a hit.
10:20:17
10:20:23
10:20:26
10:20:29
10:20:34
10:20:37
10:20:39
10:20:42
10:20:46
10:20:49
10:20:52
10:20:54
10:20:57
10:20:59
10:21:03
10:21:08
10:21:13
10:21:17
10:21:21
10:21:24
10:21:25
10:21:28
10:21:34
10:21:37
10:21:41
57 Then what about their hitters? Somebody had to
score the two runs to get the win.
They all worked together. Sure, was the pitcher a
substantial -- was the pitcher a big one? Of course, but so
was the fielding. So was the hitting. Without any of that,
you wouldn't have -- you wouldn't have had the win. They had
to all work together.
It's like batteries you put in a light. Take four
batteries, put it in a light. You take one battery out, it
doesn't work. Okay? But each one of them contributes when
you put them all in to making it work.
And here, that's why we would submit that,
of course, the fraudulent concealment that they engaged in
contributed to Mr. Kerrivan's disease and, of course, their
conspiracy contributed to their disease, just like the
negligence and strict liability they engaged in. So that's
how that works.
Damages. There will be a question on damages.
And, Willow, if we can put up number seven.
This is -- the damages, you will see from the
instructions. It says, "You should consider the following
elements of damage and no other: Plaintiff's bodily injury
and resulting pain and suffering, disability, mental anguish,
inconvenience or loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life
in the past and in the future as a result of his COPD."
10:21:43
10:21:45
10:21:49
10:21:52
10:21:55
10:21:59
10:22:02
10:22:03
10:22:06
10:22:09
10:22:13
10:22:14
10:22:17
10:22:20
10:22:23
10:22:26
10:22:30
10:22:31
10:22:34
10:22:48
10:22:51
10:22:53
10:22:56
10:22:59
10:23:02
58 And I won't go over it, but there's also -- well,
let's look at demonstrative eight as well.
Demonstrative eight here talks about the fact that
compensatory damages are not restricted to actual loss of
time or money. They cover mental and physical aspects,
tangible and intangible.
And the Judge told you this and instructed you
about this, and it's important in answering some of what we
talked about earlier in the case as well. Thus, no evidence
of the value of such intangible things as pain and suffering
has been or need be introduced. Okay?
That's why, you know, it's not an easy thing to set
a number, and I understand that, for the damages that Mr.
Kerrivan has suffered. But that is going to be your hard
work and your job to do.
And I do -- we do have some suggestions of what
that number should be.
You know, if you have an injury and try to
determine what type of monetary damages should go to help --
for what somebody has suffered for so long, I think you would
look at, you know, what they suffered, how long it lasted and
how long it's going to last in the future.
So maybe if somebody had -- you know, had a car
accident or something like that, broke a leg, had to -- you
know, took a couple weeks -- you know, took two or three
10:23:05
10:23:08
10:23:12
10:23:15
10:23:18
10:23:22
10:23:23
10:23:25
10:23:29
10:23:32
10:23:35
10:23:38
10:23:41
10:23:45
10:23:48
10:23:49
10:23:53
10:23:58
10:24:02
10:24:05
10:24:08
10:24:11
10:24:13
10:24:17
10:24:21
59 months or something to get better but then completely
recovered and it's fine, you know, maybe we're talking in the
tens of thousands of dollars for that kind of pain and
suffering and anguish that you went through.
So you look at the level of harm, I think, and the
length of the harm. And then maybe, you know, let's say
somebody has an accident or something happens to them that
hurts them, and now they, you know, have injuries to their
leg or wherever, something that they're never going to
recover. They're going to be disabled for the rest of their
life. That's -- maybe we're starting to get into the
hundreds of thousands or higher type of money and dollar
amount that I think you would ask for for an injury like that
that caused a lot of pain and a lot of suffering and is going
to last a long time.
Maybe you lose a limb, you know, lose your legs or
something like that. You start getting into higher damages
and elements. But when somebody like Mr. Kerrivan, when you
have a disease that is a creeping disease, that, you know,
every puff of the cigarette froze the cilia, each puff
of that froze the cilia and stopped your defenses and slowly
created this problem over time, then you develop your lungs
where you feel like an elephant is sitting on your chest.
You can't breathe out. You can't -- you eventually get
tethered to an oxygen tank, you know, 24/7; nose bleeds and
10:24:25
10:24:27
10:24:30
10:24:33
10:24:36
10:24:39
10:24:43
10:24:45
10:24:51
10:24:53
10:24:56
10:24:59
10:25:02
10:25:05
10:25:08
10:25:09
10:25:13
10:25:16
10:25:20
10:25:26
10:25:31
10:25:35
10:25:39
10:25:43
10:25:49
60 the like; having to take all this medication with side
effects; not able to walk; two-and-a-half hours, two hours, I
think he said, to get ready for court in the morning;
sometimes a shower takes an hour and a half. And then,
frankly, having to look and realize and understand every day,
just -- just every day this could be the last. That's the
last.
Now, we understand, you know, somebody might say,
"Well, I don't think any money is going to make him better,
and he doesn't have much longer to live." That is not in the
instructions of what you should consider. What you need to
consider -- not sympathy. You know, it's too late for
sympathy, by the way. We don't want any sympathy.
Mr. Kerrivan is making the best of his situation,
and he's a fighter, and he wants to keep fighting.
But what you do is you look at the fair and the
just amount. And when I have -- when we have to talk about
the level of harm here that he's been suffering since 1992 or
'3 and on, and what he's looking -- having to do these past
several years and what's going to happen to him in the
future, a very short future that he has left, then I have to
ask in the millions of dollars. That's the kind of harm that
are in the millions of dollars.
And, frankly, you're going to have to set that
number. I would suggest ten million dollars is the right
10:25:56
10:26:00
10:26:08
10:26:11
10:26:17
10:26:21
10:26:24
10:26:25
10:26:28
10:26:30
10:26:35
10:26:37
10:26:40
10:26:43
10:26:45
10:26:49
10:26:51
10:26:55
10:26:59
10:27:03
10:27:05
10:27:09
10:27:12
10:27:13
10:27:15
61 amount. I think that's the fair and just amount.
Now, you may go a little bit less. You know, we
put the -- we figured out every puff. He must have had about
8.4 million puffs of a cigarette. Maybe that's the
appropriate number, because each one of those damaged his
cilia, damaged his lung and slowly over time damaged it.
Maybe it's more like $12 million, and that's your
call. You can go higher than I say or lower, of course, than
I say. And there's no exact science to it, so the judge
said, but we submit $10 million is the appropriate number.
And you don't reduce, by the way, for your
comparative fault because the judge will do that, if
necessary, later. So if, for example, I'm asking for the $10
million, you put the full $10 million in there. He will make
any reductions on your comparative fault later for the
negligence and strict liability claims.
For the intentional tort claims, though, all the
damages will be recovered. Okay?
Now, let me jump over -- so there will be one more
question that you have to ask, and I'm going to cut some of
my remarks short, because I know we took a little time. But
the last question you'll be asked to consider is whether
punitive damages are warranted.
And, Willow, can you put up number nine?
The instruction says, you know, "Punitive damages
10:27:18
10:27:20
10:27:23
10:27:28
10:27:31
10:27:34
10:27:37
10:27:40
10:27:43
10:27:47
10:27:50
10:27:52
10:27:55
10:27:59
10:28:02
10:28:06
10:28:08
10:28:12
10:28:18
10:28:20
10:28:22
10:28:25
10:28:28
10:28:30
10:28:44
62 are warranted on a claim -- punitive damages are warranted on
a claim as punishment to that defendant and as a deterrent to
others. Okay?
The reason for punitive damages is to punish Philip
Morris and R.J. Reynolds. And -- and -- and, you know, we
will come back for another phase for you to set the amount on
that. This is just only to determine whether they are
warranted or not.
I'll let you know that other phase, it lasts like
less than a day. It's quick. It's not like some long thing
that you are going to have to be here for. But they are to
deter these companies and other companies that would engage
in this type of conduct, and that's why I think this case is
essential and important, and I think we've established it.
Willow, if you show them number ten, demonstrative
number ten.
These are the elements that you will look at. I
won't read -- well, let's go through a little bit.
The defendant had actual knowledge of the
wrongfulness of its conduct.
I think the evidence has established that by clear
and convincing evidence.
The defendant had actual knowledge that there was a
high probability of injury or damage to a person in Mr.
Kerrivan's position. Let me talk about that for just a
10:28:47
10:28:52
10:28:55
10:28:57
10:29:01
10:29:06
10:29:08
10:29:10
10:29:11
10:29:13
10:29:17
10:29:20
10:29:23
10:29:27
10:29:29
10:29:33
10:29:37
10:29:39
10:29:42
10:29:44
10:29:46
10:29:48
10:29:49
10:29:51
10:29:54
63 second. When Mr. Kerrivan smokes and he finally gets to the
point where he understands or realizes that, you know, things
can happen from smoking. You know, you can -- something can
happen. You know, Mr. Kerrivan's head is like, "Well, I hope
it won't happen. There's a chance that it won't happen, but
it could happen." That's what he's thinking, or any
individual smoker.
But Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, every morning
when they woke up and they made their choices, they made
their own decisions, that should come with responsibility,
too. They knew with certainty how many people would die as a
result of it. With certainty. It wasn't a question. Maybe
they didn't know which people. But with certainty they knew
the number.
Now, the third one is: "Despite that knowledge,
intentionally pursued the course of wrongful conduct
resulting in Mr. Kerrivan's COPD."
We showed the documents. Dr. Proctor came in here
and told you about all their knowledge. Dr. Grunberg did,
too. The knowledge of addiction and nicotine in setting
levels. Dr. Proctor knew about the knowledge of disease.
And despite that knowledge, did they continue to pursue their
conduct? You bet you. And, in fact, when more dangers and
warnings were coming out, did they -- did they say, like,
"You know what? Let's turn down. Let's dial it back here.
10:29:59
10:30:03
10:30:07
10:30:11
10:30:14
10:30:17
10:30:22
10:30:25
10:30:29
10:30:32
10:30:36
10:30:45
10:30:49
10:30:53
10:30:56
10:30:58
10:31:02
10:31:03
10:31:06
10:31:10
10:31:12
10:31:13
10:31:16
10:31:20
10:31:23
64 We don't need to be pushing this product."
No. They turned up their advertising dollars. It
increased. They went up.
What does that say? If they know -- you know, if
they know about all this stuff is causing all these things
and they're hiding it, what are they doing?
Marketing in the way that they did over those
years, what are they doing still studying children? What is
that?
We think that that meets this prong.
Number four: "The defendants' wrongful conduct
constituted a serious public wrong." I -- I -- I -- I -- I
can think of no other case I could bring in front of you
about a serious public wrong than what we've tried to show
you over these last two weeks of this conspiracy and this --
the conduct of these companies.
You can take that down, Willow.
I had a -- this is a good time to look at the
timeline and see what they did. Okay? This 1982 line that's
important we'll talk about. So the sales of cigarettes start
going down in 1982. Dr. Proctor told you about that. What
did they do?
They start draping themselves in the flag, and I
think you're going to hear some things about in America, we
have choices, and we can make choices. And that's true.
10:31:26
10:31:27
10:31:30
10:31:34
10:31:39
10:31:42
10:31:45
10:31:48
10:31:53
10:31:53
10:31:55
10:31:58
10:32:05
10:32:07
10:32:10
10:32:14
10:32:15
10:32:18
10:32:23
10:32:28
10:32:32
10:32:35
10:32:35
10:32:40
10:32:43
65 That is true. I don't take away from that.
But there's some language and terminology that they
start trying to drape their conduct in, and I want you to
think about it, because here they are, they're going to say
that Mr. Kerrivan, that it's all his fault.
And what are they doing in 1985 when Nicorette gum
is trying to come out? What did Dr. Grunberg say?
How much earlier could cessation aids like that
have hit the market?
You heard Mr. Jupe yesterday. I've seen that video
a few times. I don't think I've caught this before. He
talked about, "Well, maybe one day a pharmaceutical company
should work on that whole brain receptor disease. I'm sure
they would have a good business model for that. That would
be great. They ought to do it."
Really? Because when Dow Chemical decided to start
making Nicorette gum, what did Philip Morris say about it
then? They organized this thing and put pressure -- the only
thing they knew how to do is put pressure on Dow Chemical,
they're going to strip away all their business if they didn't
only target that product to who? Pick people that are
already sick. You can make it, but, listen, only give it to
people that are sick, not the rest of the people trying to
quit. We'll let them have that stuff once it's too late.
That's what they did. That's their conduct.
10:32:45
10:32:47
10:32:51
10:32:53
10:32:56
10:33:01
10:33:06
10:33:09
10:33:12
10:33:13
10:33:16
10:33:18
10:33:21
10:33:25
10:33:27
10:33:29
10:33:32
10:33:34
10:33:40
10:33:44
10:33:47
10:33:50
10:33:53
10:33:56
10:33:59
66 What did they do, the people are trying to quit,
the Great American Smokeout, the American Cancer Society
is -- the American Cancer Society is out there trying to warn
people, and they're ridiculing them. They're out there --
they're ridiculing the American Cancer Society. The same
group that they're coming in here now and trying to tell you
that they put out all these warnings that Mr. Kerrivan should
have heard.
You know, the last people in the world that should
get to come in and hold up the American Cancer Society's
warnings are the people that ridiculed them.
MR. DAVIS: Objection, Your Honor. That goes to
the defense of the case, pretrial ruling.
THE COURT: Sustained.
Go ahead.
MR. DAVIS: Can we get a curative on that, Your
Honor?
MR. BYRD: I can rephrase that.
THE COURT: Just disregard the last sentence.
And then you may rephrase, okay?
MR. BYRD: The companies, Philip Morris and
R.J. Reynolds, okay, ridiculed the people that were trying to
warn people. And then they sent out -- you know, they had --
Mr. Kerrivan, you heard evidence about that, you know, he had
done those programs where he got coupons and all these
10:34:02
10:34:05
10:34:10
10:34:13
10:34:16
10:34:19
10:34:22
10:34:25
10:34:27
10:34:29
10:34:33
10:34:35
10:34:37
10:34:39
10:34:41
10:34:41
10:34:43
10:34:44
10:34:47
10:34:49
10:34:52
10:34:56
10:34:59
10:35:03
10:35:05
67 things, and he got, you know, like, Marlboro gear and stuff
that his daughter was all concerned about, and he was wearing
all this Marlboro stuff, he got that from their coupon
program.
So they have the largest database Dr. Proctor said
of all this. And what are they mailing to their customers?
The Great American Smokers' Kit. You have a right to
continue to smoke. Here's what you should tell these
anti-smokers: "Don't nag me." That's their conduct.
Now, they don't get to just wipe that off the
table. You know, they don't get to, you know -- they have
to -- they can't tell two different stories. Philip Morris
and R.J. Reynolds will today say things cause disease and
cause these problems, but they told a different story when
people weren't looking and throughout Mr. Kerrivan's relevant
time of his smoking history and disease.
They don't get to take those things off the table
and just act like because it happened a long time ago and we
admit it's bad now, that you just take it off the table
because you shouldn't consider it.
No. Today is the day that it's time to be held
accountable for Mr. Kerrivan, for what happened to Mr.
Kerrivan.
Now, I drew a graph at the beginning, and I'm a
horrible drawer, and we'll show this, demonstrative number
10:35:08
10:35:11
10:35:13
10:35:17
10:35:17
10:35:21
10:35:23
10:35:26
10:35:28
10:35:31
10:35:34
10:35:40
10:35:44
10:35:47
10:35:50
10:35:54
10:35:57
10:35:59
10:36:02
10:36:04
10:36:05
10:36:09
10:36:12
10:36:12
10:36:17
68 three.
At the very beginning of this case -- the last
section I'll say here. I'm sorry for going a little bit
long. But I tried to draw this graph, and it was really bad.
I drew a line, and I drew another line.
I told you that, you know, lung cancer and diseases
like COPD just had never happened in the early 1900s. And
then out of the blue, this huge dramatic increase. You can
see this one deals with lung cancer, not the COPD, but it's
the same type of thing. And dramatic increase.
And then the consumption of cigarettes, it's the
other line, the blue line on the left, this 20-year lag.
It's the largest -- diseases like COPD and lung cancer went
from the most rarest -- the rarest form of -- the rarest
thing ever to, like, the number one -- you know, the top five
things that people die from. It's an epidemic like we've
never seen.
I told you at the beginning that we would -- I'd
show you a conspiracy, the likes of which we have never seen.
And I want to be really clear. This -- this chart,
okay, that line there is 400 and -- we heard -- you've heard
the figures. The Surgeon General report, it's in evidence;
but, you know, the latest numbers are 480,000 deaths a year,
premature deaths. More than 20 million people have died
prematurely. There's that one graph that says if it keeps
10:36:20
10:36:20
10:36:22
10:36:26
10:36:30
10:36:32
10:36:35
10:36:39
10:36:42
10:36:45
10:36:49
10:36:52
10:36:56
10:37:01
10:37:03
10:37:10
10:37:13
10:37:14
10:37:17
10:37:21
10:37:26
10:37:31
10:37:35
10:37:40
10:37:43
69 up, five-and-a-half million kids today will die from
cigarette diseases. Okay?
But here's the deal. That line right there, that's
not like -- that's not something like accounting profit line,
you know. Those are people. Those are grandfathers and
grandmothers. They're aunts. They're uncles. They're
mommies. They're daddies. They're sisters. They're
brothers.
And we showed you the evidence. Make no mistake.
The replacement smokers are kids, 90 percent. 90 percent of
their business comes from kids starting to smoke.
One of those kids --
Willow demonstrative one.
-- Kenny Kerrivan. He grew up to make race cars.
He wanted to make race cars. But at the same time, became
one of the cigarette industries greatest customers. Growing
up, older, becoming older before he -- before he should have
been and got hooked on a product that has left him where he
is today.
Are punitive damages warranted to deter that type
of conduct? Yes. And we submit that you put "yes" down, and
we will come back very briefly, it will be less than a day,
to deal with that issue. But it is an important thing to do,
because, you know, Mr. Gentry and Mr. Jupe, who you heard
from, on their leadership teams or whatever they are a part
10:37:46
10:37:51

70 of, you know, they're going to hear or not what this jury
does.
Now, I will come back in rebuttal, and I'll reserve
the rest of my time for that, Your Honor.


MR. BYRD: Your Honor, thank you. May it please
We'll bring up our board.
I'm going to be brief. I know everybody wants to
get to lunch, and there's a lot of things I wish I could say,
but I am going to try to just hit a few things.
And just put it over here. That's fine. We'll see
both of these things. It doesn't have to be up there. Just
right there. That's fine.
These slides were interesting to me because what is
missing from their timeline is any of their own conduct,
Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, you know.
So, oh, here's the PSA of Larry Hagman, which, by
the way, there's no evidence he ever saw anyway in 1982.
What were they doing in 1982? What were they doing in the
early '80s? Where was that on their timeline?
And, you know, this idea that, you know, he never
12:57:35
12:57:37
12:57:40
12:57:42
12:57:45
12:57:46
12:57:48
12:58:01
12:58:01
12:58:03
12:58:04
12:58:06

12:58:40
12:58:44
12:58:48
12:58:52
150 tried to quit, he never tried to quit, he never tried to
quit, did they ever try to quit their conduct? When did that
stop? How hard were they trying to stop this foolish
behavior that we have over here on the evidence?
And if you look at this timeline, if our product
was harmful, we'd stop business tomorrow? They knew their
product was harmful. They didn't stop business.
Do you think the public -- you know, it was big
news. Remember, it was big news, these reports that were
coming out. People were glued to the TV. People were glued
to the reports. It was big news. And what did they say when
they got on the news?
There's nothing in there harmful. If there is,
we'll take it out.
I mean, is the idea that everything they said
wasn't heard by Mr. Kerrivan, but everything that they want
you to think, you know, the other stuff, he did hear, so he
was like the only person in the country that didn't get their
50 years of lying and campaign of doubt and controversy that
they created? The Truth Squad? I mean, the idea that
Mr. Kerrivan is the only guy out there that didn't get any of
this information to try to show doubt? So he didn't try to
quit? There's no evidence he tried to quit before '82?
Well, duh. Isn't that evidence, that he was
believing a lot of what they say? Don't believe it. It
12:58:58
12:59:03
12:59:06
12:59:12
12:59:15

13:00:14
13:00:17
13:00:22
151 hasn't been proven yet. It's not going to happen.
Isn't that evidence to go to establish that they
were fooling him all through '82, through the '80s?
And filtered cigarettes -- we talked about this.
Here they are in 1966 talking about the illusion of
filtration, okay? Here they are in 1964 when they start
developing -- pushing filters and then developing lights
later.
We need -- we must find in the near future answers
which will give smokers a psychological crutch and
self-rationale to continue smoking. That's their secret
documents internally. We have got to find a way to give them
a psychological crutch to keep smoking.
And then what do they say? An important date,
December 1st, 1982. It's Exhibit 72. Look at it. Read it.
And by the way, this concept -- I think you heard Mr. Davis
say, you know, you just check "no" to questions one and two,
and then we'd go home.
You are a better jury than that. It is a Friday
afternoon, and we're going to send you out here on a Friday
afternoon, but you are a better jury than to hear all this
evidence and not go back there and read it and consider it
and take the time that you need to answer these questions and
answer all of them. And I encourage you to do that. I know
that you are a jury that will dedicate that time.

13:01:42
13:01:46
13:01:50
152 Now, this document, 1982, here they are writing
secretly. If the exit and entry gates should ever be -- if
the exit gates were ever opened, we're going to go out of
business overnight?
So what do they do? What do they do after '82?
While all this other stuff is going on in their timeline,
what do they do? They kick it up a notch. They ramp up.
They turn up their advertising. They go after Dow Chemical.
They start mailing out these, you know, American Free -- you
have a right to be an American and keep smoking. They start
doing all that stuff.
Do you think it didn't have -- I mean, is the idea
that it just -- they did all that stuff, and it didn't work
at all, and Mr. Kerrivan was the guy it didn't work on?
The evidence is that it did work on him. He smoked
filters. He went to filters. He smoked lights. And there's
some testimony, by the way, from Dr. Brodnan that they left
out. Dr. Brodnan -- they brought him. They brought this
witness. He didn't have any literature at all to support his
theory about the quitting, by the way, in '82.
There is no question on your Verdict Form about did
he quit when he was 40 years old or not? That's not
something you're going to be asked to do.
But the evidence was -- what Dr. Gravelyn said was,
"You know what, if it hadn't been for the lights, him smoking
13:01:54
13:01:59
13:02:05
13:02:07

13:03:03
13:03:06
13:03:07
13:03:12
153 those lights, we wouldn't be here."
MR. DAVIS: Objection, Your Honor; that is a
complete misstatement of the evidence.
THE COURT: I'm going to remind the jury, as I have
before, that the statements about what the evidence is, is
their ultimate decision to make, and the evidence is what the
jury believes it is. And you should listen carefully to the
arguments of counsel. And that's where I'm going to leave
it, just simply, because it's just important that the jury
understands that argument by its nature is one person's
recollection. And their recollection may well be flawed.
The whole idea behind having ten jurors is that
it's very unlikely that ten people sitting in a room will
have a flawed recollection of the testimony.
You may proceed.
MR. BYRD: I don't think I've ever been flawed
ever. I don't think I've ever made a mistake, Your Honor.
No, I...
You'll remember what the evidence is.
(Laughter.)
MR. BYRD: I'm going to skip over now a few things.
I'm going to look at my notes and try to skip over so we can
get moving and get to your real work.
You know, the information about -- information of
the 1800s and the Reader's Digest and all this information, I
13:03:16
13:03:17
13:03:18
13:03:21
13:03:23
13:03:28
13:03:33
13:03:36
13:03:41
13:03:49
13:03:53
13:03:58
13:04:01
13:04:04
13:04:07
13:04:08
13:04:10
13:04:12
13:04:13
13:04:15
13:04:17
13:04:20
13:04:22
13:04:24
13:04:27
154 think Dr. Proctor and Dr. Grunberg explained to you about
that information that was out there. It wasn't the type of
modern science that was going on inside the industry.
But more importantly, if all this evidence is so
important to Mr. Kerrivan, as Mr. Davis said, were the
C.E.O.'s of Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds just -- they just
missed it? They missed Reader's Digest? They missed
Christopher Columbus? They missed this stuff from the 1800s?
What did they do with that information? If it was so
knowledgeable, what did they do?
Really? Mr. Davis came up here and pointed to the
1988 Surgeon General's report that came out to try to say
that was another opportunity for Mr. Kerrivan to quit and the
warnings? Really?
Do you mean the '88 Surgeon General's report that
Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds and the Tobacco Institute and
all that, the wheels of the conspiracy, all those
organizations, the organizations that bought off the American
Medical Association so that the Surgeon General wouldn't come
out with warnings, that conspiracy?
The one -- they came out -- and we showed you the
news release and the press releases on the day when the '88
report came out. Dr. Grunberg remembered it vividly, said,
"It's scare tactics. How dare you, Surgeon General, say this
is addictive."
13:04:30
13:04:33
13:04:36
13:04:39
13:04:42
13:04:47
13:04:51
13:04:55
13:04:58
13:05:01
13:05:02
13:05:07
13:05:11
13:05:15
13:05:16
13:05:21
13:05:26
13:05:29
13:05:33
13:05:34
13:05:38
13:05:43
13:05:46
13:05:49
13:05:53
155 Then they went on in that report. They went
further. They said, "You know what? You're just trying to
scare kids. This is a bad thing for you to do to kids."
Why do you think in their, marketing when the '88
report came out, that they were so worried about how this
information might affect kids? Because it's 90 percent of
their business. And the exit gates are starting to open and
people are wanting to quit, just like Mr. Kerrivan.
They go to Congress in '94. They still lie.
This idea of Mr. Kerrivan -- I mean, some of these
things that they put on the board, you know, it's like, "I
had a chronic cough from cigarette smoking," you know, a lot
of that. Now, some things, okay, I think -- I'm not going to
say that everything they put up here is inaccurate or
anything. I think they've got some interesting stuff from
the evidence, and I think that's right.
But the idea like "I had chronic coughing going
forward due to cigarette smoking," that comes from his
deposition testimony years later in this past year where he's
looking back going "I had a cough. It was from cigarette
smoking." There wasn't evidence out there that said in 1970
he can remember that that's what he was attributing it to.
There wasn't evidence that it goes on and on and on like
every day he's doing this.
You heard evidence about this Dr. Grunberg could
13:05:54
13:05:57
13:05:59
13:06:02
13:06:06
13:06:09
13:06:13
13:06:18
13:06:20
13:06:26
13:06:32
13:06:34
13:06:38
13:06:41
13:06:44
13:06:46
13:06:48
13:06:51
13:06:54
13:06:57
13:07:01
13:07:05
13:07:08
13:07:12
13:07:13
156 only come up -- and Mr. Davis was very careful to pick his
words -- that he could only give you two specific documented
cases of quitting and that's because the answers to those
questions involved around, yeah, the only documents we have
are the medical records, because that's the only way we
document something. So he pointed to those, where it said
nicotine withdrawal and the patch.
Remember, Dr. Grunberg showed it, and I believe Dr.
Gravelyn did as well, that he was being prescribed medication
secondary to nicotine withdrawal.
So those are the documented cases, but Dr. Grunberg
went on and said he tried to quit several times from his
interview with Mr. Kerrivan and from reading the deposition.
And in the deposition, he said over and over how many times
he tried to quit, and Dr. Grunberg relied on that, too.
But he wanted to just only talk about where can you
really prove it with documentation?
Well, okay, those are the medical records. But
that doesn't mean that's the only quit attempts that he gave
you evidence about.
Incidentally, what did Dr. Brodnan say? They
didn't talk about that part of his testimony, did they? Dr.
Brodnan said, oh, yeah, he tried to quit with the gum. He
tried to quit with acupuncture. He tried to quit with the
nicotine patch, New Year's resolutions. That was Dr.
13:07:17
13:07:19
13:07:24
13:07:29
13:07:31
13:07:35
13:07:38
13:07:41
13:07:44
13:07:48
13:07:50
13:07:53
13:07:55
13:07:59
13:08:01
13:08:04
13:08:07
13:08:09
13:08:11
13:08:14
13:08:14
13:08:21
13:08:24
13:08:27
13:08:31
157 Brodnan. Is that documented enough?
It wasn't just two quit attempts.
Then this idea that he just put them down, the
characterization that Mr. Kerrivan just put them down in 2006
and cold turkey and that he's never had one since. Okay?
Here is a man who takes an hour and a half to take
a shower in his state today, and what he told you was, "When
I finally quit in 2006, it was the hardest thing I have ever
done." That's what he said from the witness stand.
This idea that he just put it down, never craved it
again, you know, never a problem, that's just not true from
the evidence. That's just not what he said.
By the way, you know, when the first warning came
out in 1966, he's what? Twenty-four years old, about?
That's roughly ten years or so. He's already addicted. He's
already addicted by this time.
The filters, I do agree with Ms. Patterson that
that's right. You know, she talked about the filters and the
lights, and those were the Marlboro. That's Philip Morris.
Philip Morris had the filters that he relied on and the
lights and low tars that he relied on, and that's their
product and that's what they did.
R.J. Reynolds also made filter cigarettes and they
also made light cigarettes as well. But the ones that Mr.
Kerrivan smoked on filters and lights and low tars were sure
13:08:35
13:08:36
13:08:38
13:08:41
13:08:45
13:08:50

13:09:58
13:10:01
13:10:04
158 Philip Morris.
I'm passing through stuff.
Oh, this idea of withdrawal, that there was no
other evidence about withdrawal symptoms, do you remember I
had to read the testimony for Dr. Grunberg that they didn't
read from his daughter, who said the times that he tried to
quit, he was irritable? It was horrible. And do you
remember she even went on to say, "I mean, I was finally,
like, dad, you need a cigarette."
What about that? Did that just not make it onto
the chart here, that testimony? That prior deposition
testimony, it just didn't make its way down here.
MR. DAVIS: Your Honor, there should be a limiting
instruction for the nature of that testimony and what it came
in for, given that argument. There was deposition testimony
introduced during -- in cross-examination of Dr. Grunberg.
THE COURT: Let's come over here at side bar.
(Bench conference as follows:)
MR. DAVIS: The objection, Your Honor, is that as
argued, it was as if -- I think it was Donna Fletcher he was
referring to or maybe Karen, the other daughter. I think it
was Donna Fletcher. It was as if she had testified and that
I was asking and that testimony should be disregarded.
The reality, as we discussed, I think, during Dr.
Grunberg, is to the extent there was deposition testimony
13:10:08
13:10:10
13:10:15
13:10:18
13:10:20
13:10:23
13:10:25
13:10:30
13:10:33
13:10:35
13:10:38
13:10:42

13:10:47
13:10:49
13:10:55
13:10:57
13:11:01
13:11:37
13:11:41
13:11:45
13:11:49
13:11:52
13:11:57
13:12:04
159 used during his cross-examination. It was used and admitted
solely for the limited purpose with the witnesses, non-party
witnesses of -- that the jury could use it to evaluate his
opinion. And I'm asking for a limiting instruction just to
remind them. I think you gave them that instruction at the
time that that argument was a disregard of that instruction.
MR. BYRD: No. I was talking about Dr. Grunberg as
I'm making this closing argument. We're talking about Dr.
Grunberg, and they were attacking his opinions he gave. And
I said, "Do you remember I had to read to him that this was
something else?"
I didn't come in here and say, "Donna Fletcher said
this." That's not what I'm saying, and I think it is
completely fair to handle it the way I have when I'm
addressing their attack on Grunberg's opinion. That's how it
came in in the evidence, originally.
MR. DAVIS: I've been where he is, and sometimes
when I'm there, I can't remember what I said either. But
what he said was this is the testimony. This is what she
said about withdrawal. It wasn't tied to Dr. Grunberg, and
it should be -- there should be an instruction.
THE COURT: I'm going to give a very brief
instruction, simply saying that you should remember that the
evidence that Donna Kerrivan gave was not received as
evidence. It was only received as evidence that was relied
13:12:06
13:12:09
13:12:14
13:12:21
13:12:23

13:13:11
13:13:13
13:13:16
13:13:23
160 on from formation of the doctor's opinions.
MR. BYRD: I just think that's a harsh and unfair
instruction.
THE COURT: Why?
MR. BYRD: Because the same instruction wasn't
given when he did his -- in his closing arguments, where he's
talking about all of this stuff and what they relied on and
what people said. I mean, I think you've already given the
instruction and the evidence originally.
It's unfairly -- I'm just playing by the same rules
they are in closing argument, and it's kind of unfair to now
give a limiting instruction.
THE COURT: Okay. I'm going to give a limiting
instruction on everyone and say to the extent that there's
been argument about expert opinions and there have been
references to out-of-court statements that were received for
a limited purpose, the Court simply reminds them that
statements that were received for the sole purpose of support
of expert opinions were not received as facts in evidence,
but only for the limited purpose in forming expert opinions,
which doesn't relate to anyone. Okay?
MR. BYRD: Thank you, Your Honor.

161 morning, there have been a number of references by a number
of lawyers to facts that were received for the limited
purpose of explaining the expert opinions -- opinion.
They're from witnesses that, by and large, never appeared
personally or testified. So those facts are not before the
jury as facts to determine whether they're true or not
because they were received only for the limited purpose of
explaining the expert's opinion.
So I've already instructed you on that before; and
if there's any confusion, that's just important just to bear
in mind that there's a class of evidence that we received
that was only to explain why the experts hold the opinions
they hold. And the mere fact that someone may have argued
them during the course of the last three-and-a-half hours
doesn't mean that you get to decide those facts are true for
any purpose other than the limited purpose of explaining the
expert's opinion.
MR. BYRD: Thank you, Your Honor.
THE COURT: Yes.
MR. BYRD: And let me go through a couple more
things.
You heard from Mr. Heimann in his video that people
are justified in relying -- consumers should be justified in
relying on their statements because cigarette companies give
truthful statements. You heard that testimony. So the
13:14:49
13:14:52
13:14:56
13:15:01
13:15:04
13:15:10
13:15:14
13:15:16
13:15:18
13:15:21
13:15:25
13:15:27
13:15:30
13:15:34
13:15:38
13:15:41
13:15:44
13:15:46
13:15:47
13:15:48
13:15:50
13:15:51
13:15:56
13:16:00
13:16:03
162 companies told you themselves that people should be justified
in relying on what these cigarette companies did.
I heard both counsel -- I'm just going to cut this
short.
You also heard from Dr. Gravelyn that eight to ten
pack years were enough, and you didn't hear anything really
from R.J. Reynolds' counsel on the R.J. Reynolds' brand issue
that, you know, the significance of the fact of what did it
do in contributing to the addiction, those early years, and
how important that is, and I don't think we heard anything to
counter that type of evidence.
You know, one pack -- I mean, a lot of people have
trouble remembering not only in advertisements but the exact
years. I mean, I don't think anybody could sit there and,
like, "I think I ate Fruit Loops in the '50s and then went in
the '60s to the Wheaties cereal."
So not only did Dr. -- I mean, listen to what Mr.
Kerrivan said and you take him at his word.
Judge Erickson has told you how to evaluate that
testimony and whether things are something that are just, you
know -- something that's hard to remember and no big deal or
not a big deal. But I'll put Mr. Kerrivan's credibility up
on the line before Mr. Gentry or Mr. Jupe any day of the
week. And if you want to evaluate that, please do. I
encourage you to do that.
13:16:07
13:16:09
13:16:12
13:16:18
13:16:18
13:16:23
13:16:26
13:16:33
13:16:34
13:16:38
13:16:41
13:16:42
13:16:49
13:16:52
13:16:55
13:16:59
13:17:00
13:17:06
13:17:09
13:17:12

13:17:17
13:17:20
13:17:24
13:17:29
163 But I'll say this: I think it would be a little
bit strange if the one pack, that he supposedly remembers one
pack as an actual pack, that that just happened to also be
the one time he caught on the photo that we show you.
I think he's remembering it because it was more use
than that, and I think that's the only reason he would have
been able to recall it years later.
You know what? They didn't tell you about -- Ms.
Patterson talked about a lot of deposition testimony and
things that he said, you know, about when he was being asked
about his use of Camel. I don't think she addressed -- do
you ever wonder, like, why they were asking him about Camel
in the first place? How they knew to ask him about Camel in
the first place in those questions?
Camel and Lucky Strike. You will see some of the
documents, if you review them; and I don't know the exact
exhibit number. Camel and Lucky Strike made up more than 50
percent of the market in these early years, in the '40s and
'50s. Everybody was smoking them. They were the largest
brands around. It was the most popular brands.
Finally, I heard both counsel say that, "We're not
here to criticize Mr. Kerrivan." And then they say, "But you
do it. You put 100 percent on him, but we're not here to
criticize what he did."
After all, he's a great customer for them.
13:17:29
13:17:33
13:17:36
13:17:38
13:17:42
13:17:46
13:17:49
13:17:51
13:17:53
13:17:56
13:17:59
13:18:07
13:18:11
13:18:15
13:18:16
13:18:19
13:18:22
13:18:27
13:18:31
13:18:33
13:18:35
13:18:41
13:18:50
13:18:55
13:18:56
164 "We're not here to criticize; but you, jury, you do
it for us. Put 100 percent on that line."
And you also heard from Ms. Patterson and Mr.
Davis, you know, this concept of going back -- and I showed
you the picture of young Mr. Kerrivan. This idea -- and they
have gone back in their timeline, and they have gone back in
their arguments to say back before he ever even started
smoking, he knew better. He knew better. He shouldn't have
done it. He knew he shouldn't have done it, and he knew it
was wrong. And I want you to think. What that means is we
are placing blame on a 14 year old, 15 year old, 16 year old.
That's what they want you to do, and I would submit that we
don't do that, not here.
What they said was these are the arguments they
made. Now, you heard the evidence. You've heard the
evidence about his living situation, moving in with his
uncle, his father, his mother. You've heard the evidence
that came in on that, and here's what they took from that
evidence. They said, "Well, you know, he was independent.
He started smoking when he was already out on his own, when
he was supporting himself."
MR. DAVIS: Your Honor, that's beyond the scope of
rebuttal.
MR. BYRD: That's exactly what Ms. Patterson said,
Your Honor.

13:20:17
165 MR. DAVIS: And we're into pretrial-ruling land
here, too.
THE COURT: I am concerned about where we're going
with this. I just want you to be very careful, because I
believe Ms. Patterson did say those words, and you're able to
rebut that. But you have to be very careful about the
Court's previous ruling.
MR. BYRD: She said he was independent before he
ever started smoking. He was out on his own supporting
himself. And that's right, and that's what the evidence was,
about 16 -- 14, 16-year-old Mr. Kerrivan. That's what the
evidence was.
What I'd like you to do is go take a look at
Exhibit 1302, it's the 2012 Surgeon General report and read
those pages about what the industry knew about young people
starting to smoke, how they used it.
Leon del Marco, I don't know who that guy is, but
I'll tell you what. He started smoking for some reason.
They're putting out ads teaching people how to inhale, and
they understand peer pressure, and they use it. If you're
not sure about that, don't take my word for it. Go read
Exhibit 1302, excerpts from the 2012 Surgeon General report
and make your decision about whether the industry was doing
these things intentionally or not, because they understand
that 90 percent of their business comes from this type of age
13:20:19
13:20:22
13:20:23
13:20:26
13:20:29

13:21:40
166 group.
But we don't dispute at all what Miss Patterson
said. You betcha. He was on his own, and he was out
supporting himself at that age.
And, frankly, that's exactly what made him one of
their greatest customers, because that's how they marketed,
and that's what they want. They want people to grow up by
starting to smoke when they're too young.
Thank you. And we'll rest, Your Honor.
