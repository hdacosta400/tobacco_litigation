2           MS. LUTHER:  Thank you, Judge.  By the way,
3       Hardee, I'm impressed that you did not manage to
4       trip over that.  You were making me very
5       nervous.
6           MR. BASS:  Thank you.
7           MS. LUTHER:  Good afternoon again,
8       everybody.  I want to start off by telling you
9       all that we appreciate your service as jurors.
10       We know this hasn't been an easy case.  There
11       was a lot of testimony and evidence presented
12       and a lot of legal instructions to consider and
13       evidence to review.  Many times, today
14       especially, you had to wait as we argued motions
15       and objections.  You were incredibly attentive
16       to all of that, and we thank you very much.
17           Mr. Bass asked you to talk about the
18       consequences to Ms. Westmoreland and
19       Mrs. Lambert and Mr. Westmoreland.  I submit
20       that based on the instructions that you're going
21       to get, that's all you can consider.  In
22       actuality, you've -- you have already considered
23       the consequences to those three people with the
24       award of damages that you gave yesterday.  This
25       phase will focus on the extent to which 4472
1       conduct that you found in Phase I rose to a
2       level necessary to punish Liggett and the number
3       that you feel is appropriate that function.
4       You're going to be asked to evaluate the matters
5       to determine whether Liggett acted in a manner
6       that would satisfy the Court's standard for
7       awarding additional punishment above and beyond
8       the 3.6 million you already awarded them.  Your
9       task in this phase is to determine whether
10       Mrs. Lambert and Mr. Westmoreland are entitled
11       to additional money damages over and above what
12       you've already decided was necessary to he
13       compensate them their loss.
14           In your discretion you can decline to award
15       punitive damages, even though you have
16       determined that Liggett previously engaged in
17       conduct that would warrant them.
18           During the last phase, you heard the concept
19       of causation, and that still applies in this
20       case.  Plaintiff still has to show a connection
21       between the conduct and the choices
22       Ms. Westmoreland made and her lung cancer and
23       death.  The conduct that you found reprehensible
24       enough to warrant the imposition of punitive
25       damages now must be connected to 4473
1       Ms. Westmoreland to justify a punitive award.
2           In addition, the -- you are allowed to take
3       into consideration harm to others in determining
4       whether Liggett's conduct rose to the level of
5       reprehensibility sufficient to determine that
6       there's an entitlement to punitive damages.  You
7       can't take that into consideration as harm to
8       others in this phase of the case.  It's only the
9       harm to Ms. Westmoreland, Mrs. Lambert and
10       Mr. Westmoreland.  That's all we're talking
11       about here.
12           So I want to talk about some of the bad
13       conduct that Mr. Gustafson -- sorry -- Mr. Bass
14       talks about in talking about an award of
15       punitive damages and discuss how none of it
16       could have had an impact on Ms. Westmoreland or
17       her smoking decisions.  In the last phase you
18       heard plaintiffs argue that things would have
19       been different Ms. Westmoreland if the
20       companies had stated back in the day that
21       smoking causes disease and was addictive.  But
22       is that right?  In 1964 the Surgeon General told
23       the world that smoking causes lung cancer, and
24       there have been Surgeon General's reports that
25       have come out on an almost yearly basis 4474
1       thereafter on a whole host of issues relating to
2       smoking and health.
3           We also know that in '64 the Surgeon General
4       told the world that smoking cigarettes was
5       habituating and difficult to quit.  Liggett
6       published the same thing in its nine-volume
7       submission and made similar statements.  We know
8       in 1988 that the Surgeon General changed the
9       prior terminology that smoking was habituating
10       to say that it is now addictive and did an
11       entire report concluding that smoking is
12       addictive.  The Surgeon General reached that
13       conclusion almost 30 years ago and told the
14       world.  Then in the mid 1990s, Liggett, too,
15       agreed that smoking was addictive and made a
16       public announcement to that effect.  That was
17       almost 20 years.  It changed its terminology.
18       Liggett was the first company to do that to
19       state that the Surgeon General's new terminology
20       was correct and that smoking is addictive.
21           And as I showed you before, starting in the
22       mid 1990s Liggett put this voluntary warning
23       Congress does not require on packs of every
24       single one of its cigarettes.  And to this day
25       Liggett is the only company to have this 4475
1       voluntary warning on its packs of cigarettes.
2           We know that despite this change, despite
3       the voluntary warning on the cigarette packs
4       that cigarettes are addictive and the
5       uncontested fact that cigarettes cause disease,
6       it's still legal the companies to
7       manufacture and sell cigarettes in 2014.  Even
8       though there can be no question now that the
9       Federal Government and public health officials
10       know it causes disease and is addictive and had
11       known decades, people still choose to start
12       smoking, to continue smoking and to not quit
13       smoking.
14           Based on the evidence you've seen can you
15       really conclude that Ms. Westmoreland wouldn't
16       have smoked that first cigarette that she stole
17       from her aunt if the tobacco companies had said
18       this in 1965?  Ms. Westmoreland knew it was bad
19       her even back then because she had heard it
20       from people she loved and respected, and she
21       still snitched that first cigarette, and she
22       continued to smoke despite all the warnings she
23       received throughout her life.
24           Another issue that played a prominent role
25       in plaintiff's Phase I case was that 4476
1       companies added stuff to cigarettes to make them
2       more addictive.  Other companies may have added
3       chemicals to their cigarettes to make them more
4       addictive, but the evidence that came in in
5       Phase I from both Dr. Dietz and Edward Horrigan
6       was that Liggett emphatically did not do this.
7       Did Liggett add calcium hydroxide and DAP to
8       Lark at different points in time?  Yes.  Not to
9       make them more addictive but to make a more
10       flavorful and smooth cigarette.  Today Liggett
11       no longer adds these substances to Lark
12       cigarettes because Liggett no longer makes Lark
13       cigarettes.  We no longer own that brand.  You
14       may recall from the stipulated facts that
15       Liggett stopped making Lark in 1998.
16           You've also heard in Phase I that filters
17       are a fraud, that they don't do anything to make
18       a cigarette safer.  We agree there's no such
19       thing as a safe cigarette, but in the '50s,
20       '60s, '70s and even into the '80s the scientists
21       the people who were most interested in trying to
22       deal with any problems with smoking, including
23       people outside the industry, they thought
24       filters were the way to go.  Some of them also
25       thought raising nicotine and lowering tar was 4477
1       the way to go.  It makes sense if you remove the
2       things that are harmful it will reduce the
3       potential harm.  That's what the thinking was.
4       Liggett's efforts on filter design were made in
5       good faith, and as late as 2005, we saw evidence
6       that scientists funded by the Public Health
7       Service still believe charcoal filters may hold
8       hope a way to reduce cancer risks in
9       cigarettes and have advocated more testing.
10           Liggett shouldn't be penalized trying to
11       do the right thing and make its product safer.
12       It shouldn't be discouraged from undertaking
13       those kinds of efforts going forward.  Liggett
14       was a minor player in the Tobacco Institute.
15       There were 12, 15 members of the institute,
16       including farmers and tobacco distributors.
17       There were members of The Tobacco Institute that
18       weren't part of the conspiracy.  To the extent
19       that the industry organizations played some role
20       in your Phase I decision, bear in mind that
21       these companies have made no statements of any
22       kind, let alone statements that sought to create
23       doubt and controversy since 1998.
24           You know that Liggett was a member of the
25       CTR in 1968.  But to the extent that you took 4478
1       issue with Liggett's membership in The Tobacco
2       Institute, you don't need to worry about that
3       anymore.  These entities don't exist.
4           In this phase plaintiff has to prove that
5       Liggett needs to be punished or that Liggett
6       needs to be deterred or kept from taking the
7       same actions going forward that you found in
8       Phase I to have caused harm to Ms. Westmoreland.
9       So far what we've discussed and what you've
10       heard about Liggett has mostly been in the
11       historic context.  Now that you've determined
12       that punitive damages are warranted the way
13       Liggett did business historically, I want to
14       switch gears and talk to you about what Liggett
15       has been doing in the years since
16       Ms. Westmoreland passed away to hopefully
17       persuade you that actually awarding punitive
18       damages in this phase is not warranted or
19       necessary, because the Liggett you heard about
20       from the '50s through the 1990s no longer
21       exists, that there is no need you to send a
22       message to Liggett through a punitive damage
23       award in this case.  The concealment of the
24       past, the campaign to create doubt, that doesn't
25       exist anymore, and at least in Liggett's case it 4479
1       hasn't a very long time.
2           In making a punitive damages determination,
3       Judge Day instructed you that you may consider
4       in mitigation any changes in circumstances or in
5       Liggett's conduct which you find relevant to
6       determining an amount of punitive damages, if
7       any.
8           As you heard in the last phase of the trial,
9       today Liggett is the smallest of the major
10       tobacco companies.  Liggett was the first
11       company to admit that smoking causes lung cancer
12       and other diseases and is addictive.  Since 1997
13       it voluntarily added a warning to all of its
14       cigarette brands telling its smokers that it is
15       addictive, which I've shown you now twice.
16       Today no one who smokes a Liggett brand picks
17       that pack up without being told that smoking is
18       addictive by the company.  Your decision today
19       isn't about whether cigarettes are or should be
20       legal.  It isn't about whether Liggett or the
21       other tobacco companies should be out of
22       business.  You were told on Tuesday, and this
23       hasn't changed this phase, Liggett can not
24       be held liable merely manufacturing
25       cigarettes.  Congress has considered the issue 4480
1       and after much debate has concluded that it is
2       legal to sell cigarettes as long as the warnings
3       they crafted appear on the packs and cartons of
4       cigarettes and ads.  Even Dr. Brady agreed that
5       an adult making an informed choice should be
6       free to make the decision to smoke cigarettes
7       today.  Liggett is doing everything it can to
8       ensure that its customers are getting the
9       information they need to make that informed
10       choice.
11           Judge Day has instructed you that in
12       considering how much to award the plaintiff to
13       punish Liggett, you should consider Liggett's
14       financial resources.  In doing so, you may not
15       award an amount that would financially destroy
16       Liggett.  You've seen plaintiff's demonstrative
17       Exhibit regarding Liggett's financials from
18       2013.  Liggett acknowledges that it has an
19       income and continues to make money.  But its net
20       worth in 2013 was about negative $32 million.
21       Net worth is the measure of a company's assets
22       minus its liabilities.  That is the relevant
23       number to use in considering any award.
24           The other numbers that came in regarding
25       profits and revenues are not numbers that you 4481
1       can use to calculate a punitive award.  Those
2       numbers don't take into consideration things
3       like the expenses involved in running the
4       business, things like materials, taxes.  You saw
5       the asterisk at the bottom of that document that
6       Liggett paid over $400 million in taxes in 2013.
7       So that $900 million number is not a real
8       number, because most -- almost half of that
9       number went to the different governments for
10       taxes.
11           It also included extraordinary expenses and
12       employee salaries.  Revenue and income are all
13       well and good, but those numbers don't inform
14       you of what Liggett can actually afford to pay
15       without being financially destroyed.  The only
16       number that informs that inquiry is the net
17       worth number, which is essentially zero.  As I
18       mentioned, in 2011 they had a positive number of
19       9.528 million.  In 2012, the net worth number
20       was, again, a negative number, negative
21       $2.3 million.  And in this past year it was
22       negative 33 million.
23           Plaintiff talked about sending a message to
24       Liggett and others like Liggett to deter in the
25       future the kind of conduct from Liggett's past 4482
1       that you found warranted punitive damages.
2       Based on what you've just described about the
3       way Liggett has been doing business the last
4       20 years, we submit there's no need to send a
5       message.  We got it decades ago.
6           We respectfully request that you consider
7       these mitigating factors when you return to your
8       deliberations.  Has Plaintiff met her burden?
9       Liggett understood and accepted almost 20 years
10       ago that the conduct of the industry had to
11       change, and Liggett pioneered those changes.  We
12       understand that there were mistakes made over
13       the past 60 years and that change was necessary
14       in the industry, and Liggett took the lead in
15       the 1990s to make those changes.  Whatever you
16       decide to do we ask that you take into
17       consideration all of Liggett's conduct,
18       including some of the good things it's done and
19       continues to do and the positive changes that
20       it's responsible for.
21           Again, I want to thank you your time,
22       your consideration and your service as jurors to
23       the litigants and the Court.
