23           MR. BASS:  May it please the Court, Counsel.
24       And good afternoon members of the jury.  Thank
25       you very much your patience.  This part of 4460
1       the case, as you've seen, although this morning
2       belies that, this part of the case, presentation
3       of evidence, closing arguments is going to be
4       much much quicker than the rest of the trial.
5       And we presented one piece of additional
6       evidence.  And we did so because that's all that
7       matters to the defendants.
8           And just so you all see it again, this is
9       not going back with you all, this is the
10       Consolidated Statement of Operations years ended
11       December 31st, 2013 Liggett Group, LLC and
12       its subsidiaries.  This represents the first
13       number, the revenues.  That represents what
14       Liggett earned in one year.  It's not a
15       compilation of years.  It's one year.  And as
16       Mr. Sales said, it's written in thousands of
17       dollars.  And what that means is you add three
18       zeros to the end of the numbers.  The only
19       numbers that matter to Liggett, revenues,
20       $968,811,000.  Net income only 2013,
21       $55,186,000.
22           We're back one specific purpose.  And
23       the jury instructions tell us that the specific
24       purpose of this part of the trial is, "You will
25       now determine the amount of punitive damages, if 4461
1       any, to be assessed as punishment, punishment to
2       Liggett and as a deterrent to others."  That is
3       the only purpose of this part of the trial.  And
4       by your verdict you have already recognized and
5       decided that the circumstances were such that
6       Liggett deserved to be punished.  And now it's
7       time you all to decide the extent of that
8       punishment.  That's it.
9           And what do we punish them for?  The jury
10       instructions, as the Court, as His Honor read,
11       tell us what we are punishing for.  You may
12       recall that in the first part of the trial you
13       all were allowed to -- and I'm in the way here.
14       I'm sorry.  You all were allowed to assess the
15       reprehensibility and the wrongfulness of
16       Liggett's conduct in determining whether
17       punitive damages were warranted, whether
18       plaintiff was entitled to punitive damages.
19           And that's what this instruction talks
20       about.  While you were allowed to consider harms
21       to other persons who are not parties to this
22       lawsuit in determining whether to assess
23       punitive damages, in this phase of the trial,
24       this shorter more focused specific part of the
25       trial, "any amount of punitive damages you award 4462
1       must be based solely on harm caused to
2       Jayme Westmoreland, to Cydne Lambert and to
3       Aaron Westmoreland."
4           Okay.  And so now we've gone from nine
5       questions in Phase I, right, multiple issues,
6       and we've narrowed it down in this part to one
7       specific thing, punishment, punishment the
8       harms caused to Jayme Westmoreland, to
9       Cydne Lambert and to Aaron Westmoreland.
10           You know because you saw and you heard
11       through the testimony what Cydne and Aaron lost.
12       You know what it was like them to watch
13       their mother, who was everything to them, still
14       is, you know what it was like them to watch
15       her go through what she did.  And that's what
16       this part of the case is about.  It's about
17       their pain watching and enduring the
18       past 20 years and into the future what they
19       lost.  And it's about punishing Liggett --
20       punishing Liggett, rather, what happened to
21       these kids.
22           The jury instructions also tell us some
23       things that you all may consider.  You should
24       consider the following:  One, "The nature,
25       extent --" and this is in making 4463
1       determination, right?  In making the
2       determination of punishment and to deter others.
3       Not to -- not to deter Liggett, right.  It's to
4       punish Liggett and in so doing also send a
5       message to others who might be inclined to act
6       the way that Liggett did.  So it's not to deter
7       Liggett now.  What deterrence do they need for
8       causing the harm that they caused to Cydne and
9       Aaron?  No, it's about punishing Liggett and in
10       so doing, a second consequence is to act as a
11       deterrent to others through your verdict.
12           What do we consider in punishing and acting
13       as a deterrent to others?  We consider, "The
14       nature and extent and degree of misconduct and
15       the related circumstances; the defendant's
16       financial resources.  However, you may not award
17       an amount that would financially destroy the
18       defendant.  And any mitigating evidence
19       presented by defendant.  You may consider in
20       mitigation any changes in circumstances or the
21       defendant's conduct which you find relevant to
22       determining an amount of punitive damages, if
23       any."
24           Now, of course, as the instructions say, it
25       makes sense, right, to talk about the nature, 4464
1       the extent, the degree of misconduct and the
2       related circumstances.  But that's always a good
3       starting point to determine punishment, right?
4       We need to know what the person did or the
5       corporation.  But as you were instructed in
6       Phase I, we treat corporations like people,
7       right?  So you need to know what they did.  But
8       you all know what they did.  You heard all the
9       evidence of the things that they did.  And
10       importantly, though, you got to see through
11       their own words basically the diary of Liggett,
12       right.  You got to see the diary of Liggett,
13       their innermost thoughts when they thought
14       nobody was looking.  So you got to see the
15       nature, the extent and the degree of the
16       misconduct, right.  You know why they did the
17       things that they did.  You know they were -- you
18       know the things they did were on purpose and not
19       an accident, right.  Those are things we think
20       about, right, when we're considering punishment.
21       You know why they did what they did, right.
22       Those are things we think about when considering
23       punishment.  You know what their attitude was
24       while doing it.  Those are things we think about
25       when considering punishment.  Okay.  But you all 4465
1       heard all those things.  And by your verdict in
2       in Phase I you already -- you said, you know
3       what, we think they deserve punishing.  Okay.
4           What's the other thing, though, that we
5       think about when we think about punishment?
6       Well, we think about what are the consequences?
7       What are the consequences of those actions?
8       Right?  Because if somebody does somebody and it
9       hurts somebody or somebodies, you always
10       consider that when considering punishment.
11           And so when you all go in the back, I know
12       you deliberated long and hard yesterday and
13       talked about, number one, the nature, extent and
14       degree of misconduct and the related
15       circumstances.  You all talked about all that.
16       What I'm asking you to talk about are the
17       consequences.  I'm asking you to talk about the
18       harm caused to Jayme Westmoreland, Cydne Lambert
19       and Aaron Westmoreland, because then and only
20       then if you have a full discussion about the
21       consequences to these kids of losing their mom
22       when Cydne was 17 and Aaron was 12, then you
23       will be able to determine what the appropriate
24       punishment is.
25           Think about Aaron, so close to his mother 4466
1       that she taught him how to throw a football,
2       play sports, the things that he still loves to
3       this day, as a 12-year-old.  Think about what
4       that does to a 12-year-old getting ready to go
5       into an awkward stage of his life, losing his
6       mom.  You heard about going to school, the kids,
7       although Aaron recognizes now that they were
8       just kids, right, because doing what kids do,
9       they might not have known any better.  But you
10       know what?  At the time they were still making
11       fun of him, something that he obviously is
12       pained by still to this day.  Those are the
13       consequences that were happening then and that
14       stayed with Aaron now.
15           Think about Cydne, right.  We showed a
16       picture of her mother going to her own prom,
17       right, the things that folks take granted.
18       Cydne's mother didn't even get to meet her first
19       boyfriend.  Those are the things that were
20       stolen from Cydne and Aaron, the things that
21       shouldn't be stolen from anybody, let alone kids
22       that age whose only parent is their mom.
23           Think about all the things -- and you saw
24       it.  You saw the emotion, the realness, the
25       honesty, the rawness of it all 20 years later. 4467
1       Cydne talked about how hopeful they were when
2       the cancer was in remission.  And that's
3       understandable.  But the cruelty of it is, is
4       when you bring in a medical professional like
5       Dr. Paonessa who tells you she never had a
6       chance, she never had a chance because the
7       disease she had was terminal from the beginning.
8       But she aggressively fought it with chemo and
9       radiation.  And it went into remission.  Imagine
10       the happiness and then weeks later, as
11       Dr. Paonessa said, once you start doing the
12       chemo, that type of cancer starts growing right
13       back, and it came back with a vengeance.  And
14       they had to live through that.  Those are the
15       consequences of this defendant's actions.
16       That's what I'm asking you to talk about in the
17       back.
18           Think about the last day of
19       Jayme Westmoreland's life and her kids in that
20       room.  Think about Aaron sleeping in his mom's
21       bed where he probably felt safest in the world,
22       sleeping there through while she was in a
23       portable hospital bed essentially brought in
24       through Hospice, right, helping his mom to the
25       bathroom because she couldn't walk, Cydne doing 4468
1       the same thing.  That's the harm that was caused
2       to these kids, and that's what I'm asking you,
3       we're asking you to talk about in the back when
4       considering punishment, because you know, you
5       heard evidence of what they did, right.  This is
6       now about considering the extent of punishment.
7       And that can only be fully considered, we
8       believe, by thinking about and having discussion
9       about the consequences.
10           Think about then all the things along the
11       way, not only the proms, not only the first
12       boyfriends and girlfriends, the high school
13       graduations, the college, the marriages, the
14       grandkids.  Those are milestones.  But even set
15       aside the important milestones.  Think about the
16       everyday things, the average things.  And I
17       don't say average to mean they don't matter.  I
18       mean the things in everyday life that these two
19       have missed out on.  That's what I want you all
20       to talk about in the back.  And if you do, if
21       you do, we're confident that you're going to
22       come up with a just award, a just award to
23       punish this defendant what -- the harm
24       caused, excuse me, to Aaron and Cydne.
25           And what is a just award?  Well, we look to 4469
1       the instructions again.  Number two tells us we
2       can consider the defendant's financial
3       resources.  However, you may not award an amount
4       that would financially destroy the defendant.
5       But also remember the purpose of punitive
6       damages, right, to punish and to deter others.
7       How do you get Liggett's attention?  How do you
8       do it?  Well, you all know, money, plain and
9       simple.  That's why we showed you one bit of
10       evidence in this particular part of the case,
11       because that's all that matters.  And it's the
12       only thing that's going to get their attention.
13           And so when deciding an amount, which is up
14       to you all as the compensatory verdict was,
15       we're going to suggest an amount, but it's up to
16       you all.  When thinking about an amount and
17       talking about it, remember the instructions,
18       remember the purpose of punitive damages, to
19       punish and in so doing, to punish Liggett in so
20       doing send a message to others who might think
21       of doing the same things.  But how do we get to
22       an amount that's going to make a difference?
23       How do we get to an amount that says, you know
24       what, makes Liggett stop and think and take
25       notice?  Well, we can start with their revenues 4470
1       from last year, $968,811,000.  Do you know that
2       one percent, only one percent of that number is
3       9.68 million, right?  But that's easy, right?
4       For us to get up here and suggest well, one
5       percent, easy figure, 9.68 million, that should
6       be the amount we suggest.  That's easy because
7       you'll look at it and say, you know, one
8       percent.  So the amount we're suggesting is
9       $14.53 million, 14,535,000.  Why?  Because
10       that's 1.5 percent.  And it's also not an even
11       number, right.  And so Liggett sees this number
12       and they say, hmm, I wonder why the jury did
13       what they did.  That's the type of number that's
14       going to make them stop and think and consider
15       their actions and know that what they do has
16       consequences and that people are watching them.
17           So when you go back there, please remember
18       the purpose of punitive damages.  Please talk
19       about the consequences of Liggett's actions.
20       And please remember that Jayme Westmoreland was
21       more than just a smoker of Lark cigarettes.  She
22       was a daughter, a caretaker her sisters.
23       She was a hard worker, and she was the only
24       mother that Cydne and Aaron had.  Thank you very
25       much. 4471


24           MR. SALES:  Thank you, Your Honor.  May I
25       move this so I can use the overhead? 4483
1           THE COURT:  You may.
2           MR. SALES:  I know I will get the hook
3       before I say everything that I would like to
4       say.  And prudence teach, me in particular, that
5       I had better be briefer than I have been from
6       time to time.  So here it is.
7           Let's just start with one of the things that
8       was told to you last, because in these cases in
9       all of the phases you've been given standards
10       the evaluation not only of the evidence but
11       the arguments of the lawyers, and in this phase,
12       in this phase the question is the greater weight
13       of the evidence.  And you've heard that
14       instruction now multiple times.  And there is
15       evidence in the case of what has been described
16       as a negative net worth.  And there is also
17       evidence from last year, because that's the year
18       that we were talking about, that in the year
19       where Liggett's wants a pass in this case
20       because we're dealing with last year's --
21           MS. LUTHER:  Objection, Your Honor.
22           MR. SALES:  Liggett wants to be excused?
23           MS. LUTHER:  I don't think it's appropriate
24       Mr. Sales to be arguing to the Court from
25       here.  If he has something to say, we should 4484
1       approach.
2           THE COURT:  Counsel approach.
3 SIDEBAR CONFERENCE:
4     (The following proceedings were had before the
5     Court outside the presence of the jury:)
6           THE COURT:  Liggett wants a pass?
7           MS. LUTHER:  Yes.
8           THE COURT:  Grounds?
9           MS. LUTHER:  Inflammatory, argumentative.
10           THE COURT:  You're focusing on the 2013
11       figures?
12           MR. SALES:  Yes.
13           THE COURT:  You're saying that's the year
14       they want to take a pass?
15           MR. SALES:  Yes.
16           THE COURT:  I don't find it inflammatory.
17       Maybe a little misleading, but they can be the
18       judge of that.  I'm overruling the objection.
19       You can phrase it as you'd like.  Well, not as
20       you like.  You know what I mean.
21 END OF SIDEBAR CONFERENCE
22     (The following proceedings were had before the
23     Court and jury:)
24           MR. SALES:  It has been suggested to you
25       that after deciding by clear and convincing 4485
1       evidence, a higher standard, that punitive
2       damages ought to be awarded, that zero should be
3       awarded because, according to counsel, as was
4       represented, there is a negative net worth for
5       Liggett.  But the year that we are talking
6       about, which is the last year, just take a look,
7       if you would, please, at the financials.
8       Because in that same year there were
9       extraordinary charges of $88 million, money paid
10       out by the company.  And that's the year for
11       which there is, as has been explained to you,
12       this net worth.
13           And counsel says, if I understand the
14       argument correctly, if we pay $400,000,000 in
15       taxes to the government, we can't pay
16       $14.5 million to the people in this case.
17           MS. LUTHER:  Objection, Your Honor.
18 SIDEBAR CONFERENCE:
19     (The following proceedings were had before the
20     Court outside the presence of the jury:)
21           MS. LUTHER:  That's completely misconstruing
22       the argument that I made.  I was explaining to
23       the jury that that $900,000,000 number wasn't a
24       real number because there were $400,000,000
25       taken out in taxes.  I never suggested that we 4486
1       couldn't afford to pay the number that they
2       suggested.
3           MR. SALES:  Counsel suggested that they
4       would be bankrupt if they had to pay a punitive
5       damage award in the context of her argument
6       about how much they pay in taxes.  Otherwise,
7       why would it be relevant?
8           MS. LUTHER:  I beg to differ.
9           THE COURT:  Well, I didn't take the argument
10       to be that way.  It was clarifying the
11       difference between revenue and net income, I
12       thought.  But I think this is argument.  I think
13       you can characterize it -- the twists of
14       somebody's argument are subject to
15       interpretation, and you're entitled to give your
16       interpretation but do at your peril.
17           MR. SALES:  I think this was entirely fair,
18       which is what I wrote contemporaneously with
19       counsel's argument.
20           THE COURT:  I didn't say it was unfair.  I
21       overruled the objection.
22           MR. SALES:  All right.
23 END OF SIDEBAR CONFERENCE
24     (The following proceedings were had before the
25     Court and jury:) 4487
1           MR. SALES:  Ask yourselves if it makes sense
2       to suggest, because the Court's instruction
3       clearly does say you can not bankrupt this
4       company, and no one is asking you to do so with
5       an award of $14.5 million, a figure which
6       represents, as Mr. Bass told you, 1 1/2 percent.
7       And why have we suggested that figure to you?
8       We have suggested it to you because to say that
9       someone should pay one percent of what they take
10       in a year with respect to the sale of the same
11       product that is the cause of the death of this
12       lady, one percent is not just, because it does
13       not accurately recognize the harm that was done
14       to the three people now at this stage, as you've
15       seen, where the harm can be considered.
16           And, you know, what you were told is, and I
17       wrote it down as counsel said it, because we're
18       in agreement on this, "The consequences to these
19       three people is all you can consider."
20       Counsel's words.  And we agree.  And Mr. Bass
21       reviewed with you a very brief summary of some
22       of the consequences to these two people, to
23       these two good people who have been damaged,
24       damaged by the actions of this defendant and its
25       co-conspirators a lifetime.  Does it mean 4488
1       that they have not been able to get on with
2       their lives?  No one has come in here and said
3       that.  But they carry with them today the sting
4       of what you heard about, the sting of what you
5       heard about having to deal with a mother while
6       you are a child yourself and a teenager of
7       knowing the humiliation that she suffered as a
8       good and honest lady because she could not even
9       take care of the most private things while she
10       was dying.  And that's the verdict by your money
11       award that must speak to the extent of the
12       wrongdoing caused to these people.
13           And do you know we are not here to argue
14       about those things, because we have had an
15       opportunity to argue about what your verdict
16       was, because there's a suggestion that we really
17       did not see from you all yeses to these two
18       questions as to whether or not the lies and the
19       things that were concealed from this lady made a
20       difference.  By your verdict, you told us that
21       they did.  They weren't trivial things.  The
22       things that caused harm in this case, which you
23       have already told us by your verdict were things
24       that included lying, cheating, manipulating
25       people's minds and bodies to the point where in 4489
1       the case of this lady by your verdict, she
2       smoked herself into a cancerous death.  And you
3       know because you have seen the evidence in this
4       case with respect to the calculated way in which
5       this defendant and its co-conspirators knew what
6       would happen -- I'm not talking about those
7       other people, but to Jayme Westmoreland, because
8       she was not, and they had to know that she was
9       not an elaborate or a mouse to be painted upon
10       with tar.  She was one not to be trapped in a
11       cage but a free person to use the products that
12       they wanted her to use by their advertising, by
13       their design and by their manipulation of her
14       mind and body, just like she did.
15           There isn't -- cigarettes don't have any
16       other purpose.  She used this product exactly,
17       this product which, by your verdict, has become
18       identified by your verdict because the Engle
19       findings apply as unreasonably dangerous and
20       defective.  And so here in this Phase II when
21       we're asking you to assess punishment, we ask
22       that you recognize the magnitude of the harm
23       caused by something that was not only
24       unreasonably dangerous but something that was
25       known to be so, to the point that when you 4490
1       thought about Jayme Westmoreland coming down the
2       pike as a child, teenager in the 1960s, you
3       could envision because you were tracking whether
4       or not and to what extent children would take up
5       the habit of cigarettes, you could determine,
6       and, in fact, you could calculate how many of
7       them were going to die, including this lady.
8           And so, you know, no, the plaintiff doesn't
9       agree that by adding a warning label after this
10       lady died that they should be exonerated.  We
11       don't agree.  We don't agree that the lie about
12       addiction is a lie not merely because we're good
13       people, good companies and we will just admit it
14       now, but a period of 60 years -- excuse me,
15       40 or 50 years because the defendant and its
16       co-conspirators recognized, yes, Liggett two
17       years before the others that the jig was up.
18       And, no, we don't accept that just because it
19       has taken 20 years this process to get to
20       this point that that gives an excuse a
21       reduced punishment.
22           The issue is whether or not and to what
23       extent now by greater weight of the evidence
24       they should be punished.  And you know that the
25       amount that's been suggested is not going to 4491
1       bankrupt them because there are very few folk,
2       there are very few companies whom one
3       percent, 1 1/2 percent puts anybody in the
4       poorhouse.  And you know that parties that can
5       take a cash payment charge in an individual year
6       accounting purposes are not going to be put
7       in the poorhouse.
8           And so those reasons we suggest that
9       that is a fair and just figure.  But you in your
10       discretion can exceed that, and you in your
11       discretion, of course, can award less or none at
12       all, as counsel and the Court have told you.
13           But the purposes of the plaintiff, we
14       ask you to think a little bit about
15       Jayme Westmoreland, because counsel says it's
16       just the three people.  And we agree.  And one
17       thing that happened during the closing arguments
18       in Phase I is, I wrote down all of the things
19       that Ms. Luther said about Jayme Westmoreland.
20       One of the three people that she says you have
21       to confine your consideration --
22           MS. LUTHER:  Objection, Your Honor.
23           THE COURT:  Approach.
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
21           MR. SALES:  These are things that the
22       parties agree on when you start talking about
23       what it was that these folks lost and what
24       happened to the one person who's not here that
25       counsel says that you can consider in this 4495
1       phase, one of those three people.  These are
2       things that are not in dispute.  She was
3       intelligent.  She was disciplined.  She was
4       responsible.  She was strong.  She had common
5       sense.  She was determined.  She was not
6       gullible.  She did did what she wanted.  She
7       didn't need help.  And she was not easily led.
8       Those are things that are agreed upon.
9           I'd like to direct your attention to some
10       other things when you consider about the person
11       that was lost, the consequences of the conduct
12       that resulted in your verdict.  She was also
13       described as an anchor her children.  She
14       was a mom, a friend, a rock, a provider, a
15       caregiver.  She was humble, so humble that she
16       was embarrassed when she was in the worst
17       possible state that she could be in.  She was
18       kind.  She was devoted.  She was loyal, so loyal
19       that she took care not only of her children but
20       of every relative who needed to be taken in and
21       who needed the time and the attention of a
22       loving, good, honest, decent person.  She was a
23       caregiver, and she was a hard worker.  You've
24       heard about that.  And those are the
25       consequences of a life lost as a result of 4496
1       things that you found by your verdict that merit
2       punishing.
3           And we urge you, we urge you to confine your
4       verdict to a reasonable amount.  It can exceed
5       certainly the amount that was suggested by
6       Mr. Bass, and certainly it's within your
7       discretion to award less.  But one percent, one
8       percent of something, I want to suggest to you,
9       does not vindicate what you've heard about and
10       seen about in this courtroom, seen in this
11       courtroom and that 1 1/2, it sends the message,
12       it sends the message that this is nontrivial,
13       Liggett.  We know that there's still even a
14       two-percenter a lot of money out there.  And we
15       know that this is a reasonable and just verdict
16       that vindicates this lost.  We ask that you give
17       a verdict that speaks to that that is nontrivial
18       and justifies what we've been talking about in
19       this case.
20           Thank you very much.
