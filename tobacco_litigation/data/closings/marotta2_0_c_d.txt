10           MR. BELASIC:  Thank you, Your Honor, and
11      good morning, counsel, Mr. Marotta.
12           Ladies and gentlemen, I also want to thank
13      you.  Every lawyer in this room, we volunteered
14      for this case.  We weren't called in.
15           When you got your summons in the mail, you
16      were, in effect, drafted, and I thank you for
17      stepping up to the call of duty.  Without your
18      participation, this great principle of
19      democracy called jury trials wouldn't exist.
20           Now, throughout the seven or eight days of
21      evidence in this case and for the overwhelming
22      majority of time that Mr. Alvarez spent
23      speaking, what you've seen is an attempt to
24      retry those findings, the findings that they
25      talk about from that other lawsuit, from Engle, 2664
1      findings on concealment or negligence.
2           But as the judge instructs you in the jury
3      instruction, this case isn't about
4      re-litigating that case.  This case is about
5      Mr. Marotta and why Mr. Marotta died.
6           All of the key questions on the verdict
7      form are about Mr. Marotta, not are tobacco
8      companies bad, not are we mad at tobacco
9      companies.  They're about Mr. Marotta.
10           Now, the judge is going to instruct you as
11      follows:  "The manufacture and advertisement
12      and sale of cigarettes are lawful activities."
13           Everyone knows they are.  It's legal to
14      make them.  It's legal to advertise them.  Even
15      if it makes us mad when we go 50 years back and
16      see an ad that Mr. Marotta never even saw, it's
17      legal to advertise that.
18           The warning labels that are on the packs
19      comply with federal law.  There is no claim in
20      this case that R.J. Reynolds broke the law,
21      that they didn't comply.
22           And after 1969, because of those warnings,
23      cigarette advertising cannot be the subject of
24      any claim that the advertising undermined or
25      neutralized those warnings. 2665
1           Now, why do I mention that?  When we
2      started this case, I put up that date, May 5,
3      1982.  I was the one who talked about it in
4      opening.
5           Now, at the time, you probably wondered,
6      what is it?  It's not somebody's birthday.  Is
7      it a significant moment in tobacco history?
8      No.
9           I told you that that was the date which
10      the law requires, and which Judge Tuter has
11      instructed you, that is the date after which
12      they have to prove that Mr. Marotta saw a
13      statement, that that statement was false, and
14      that he relied upon it, that it caused him, in
15      effect, to develop lung cancer.
16           And I told you, I challenged the
17      plaintiffs, when the first witness took the
18      stand, Dr. Proctor, the historian from
19      California, I told you that he would not say
20      anything, anything about the plaintiff or
21      Mr. Marotta, the smoker, seeing a statement
22      after 1982 and believing it and changing his
23      testimony, and that's exactly what he admitted.
24           That is the cutoff date.  And here it is.
25      This is the verdict form.  You're going to be 2666
1      asked:  Did Phil Marotta rely on a statement by
2      R.J. Reynolds.  The date was after May 5, 1982.
3           The next two questions:  Did Phil Marotta
4      rely to his detriment on an act taken by R.J.
5      Reynolds or in agreement with other companies?
6      And look what the date is.  This is what you
7      have to decide.  Was this act taken after
8      May 5, 1982?
9           Did Phil Marotta rely on these statements
10      after 1982?  This is an easy question for you
11      to answer, and you don't have to believe me.
12      You don't have to believe any tobacco company,
13      because it was their witness.
14           They hired and they paid an expert named
15      Dr. DiFranza, remember him, he was the man from
16      Massachusetts.  They paid him to review, and he
17      said he had reviewed every single deposition,
18      all of the testimony by Phil Marotta, and
19      everyone whose testimony was in this case.
20           I asked him about his opinion, having
21      reviewed everything, was Mr. Marotta somehow
22      tricked?  What did he believe about lung
23      cancer?  And look at what he said.
24           "There isn't any dispute that at that
25      time, based on the tragic death of his parents, 2667
1      that he personally believed that smoking could
2      be -- could cause lung cancer at that point?"
3      He agrees, "Yes.
4           "And that was in the late '70s?
5           "Right."
6           That's their expert.  At the very
7      beginning of his testimony, he says that
8      Mr. Marotta personally believed by the late
9      '70s, that it caused lung cancer.  So of
10      course, your answer has to be no on this
11      question.
12           Now, Dr. Proctor also came up.  Remember
13      what he did.  He testified on a Monday and he
14      talked about a hundred years back, smoking
15      machines, World War I, things before
16      Mr. Marotta was even born.
17           And then on Tuesday, Dr. Proctor got all
18      the way up to the '30s, '40s, and '50s.  Some
19      of that, before Mr. Marotta was even born, but
20      almost all of it before he even started
21      smoking.
22           And then, finally, on his third day of
23      testimony, at ten minutes to 10 in the morning,
24      because I wrote the time down, Dr. Proctor
25      finally, finally got up to 1982.  He wasted 2668
1      your time.
2           The judge is instructing you that the
3      finding here has to be about statements after
4      May 5, 1982.  We didn't have to sit here for
5      three days to hear all the things -- remember
6      what he admitted about the advertisements.
7           He said the lawyers picked out the
8      advertisements.  He said he had been paid one
9      million dollars total to testify in cases
10      brought by lawyers who sue tobacco companies,
11      and he said the lawyers in this case picked out
12      the ads for him.
13           He admitted they were before he started
14      smoking or they were for brands he didn't
15      smoke, and there were only a handful of Winston
16      ads.  You know what, nothing after 1982.
17           I asked him, are you claiming that
18      Mr. Marotta relied after '82?  You saw what he
19      said.  I'm not making any claims about his
20      life.  I'm here to talk about the industry.
21           Well, that's not relevant, because Judge
22      Tutor tells you it's after May 1982 and it has
23      to be something that Mr. Marotta relied on and
24      changed his behavior.
25           I tried to sum it up.  You're not 2669
1      claiming, are you, that any of the information
2      that you've talked about or that you've put up
3      on the screen is proof that Mr. Marotta was
4      influenced by something that a tobacco company
5      said.  And he said, that's correct.
6           And that's for everything that he talked
7      about.  Within five minutes -- after two days
8      on the stand being questioned by plaintiff's
9      lawyers.  Within five minutes, Dr. Proctor
10      said, the lawyers picked out the ads and I'm
11      not claiming that Mr. Marotta saw anything.
12      I'm not claiming it influenced him at all.  And
13      he admits it wasn't proof of that.
14           Now, Mr. Alvarez spent about one minute
15      telling you that he thinks the evidence
16      supports the fact that Mr. Marotta was somehow
17      confused.
18           Here is the rest of the story.  You heard
19      a tremendous amount of evidence about what
20      Mr. Marotta knew.
21           In 1959, they say that was the year he
22      first smoked a cigarette.  In 1959, Harvard did
23      a study and found that 90 percent of junior
24      high students had already heard that smoking
25      causes cancer. 2670
1           In the 1960s, his best friend from school,
2      Mr. Gelfano, said that in the 1960s when they
3      were in school, they were using the terms
4      "cancer sticks" and "nicotine fit," and he said
5      that Mr. Marotta would have known that, that
6      the cigarettes he held in his hand were called,
7      by ordinary people, by young people, "cancer
8      sticks."
9           DeNunzio, his partner, asked him and said
10      that he knew smoking caused cancer as a
11      teenager.  You didn't hear that today.
12      Mr. DeNunzio said that Marotta told him that,
13      when he was a teenager, that he believed
14      smoking could cause cancer.
15           We know that the Surgeon General's report
16      on cancer came out when he was in school.  We
17      know that just right after high school, the
18      pack warnings came out, and we know he ignored
19      those warnings.  We know he ignored those
20      warnings.  He didn't try to quit.
21           We know that in the late '60s and the
22      early '70's, his father died of lung cancer.
23      We know that his mother died of lung cancer.
24      And his own expert says that, because of that
25      event -- remember what Dr. DiFranza said, there 2671
1      is no dispute that he didn't rely on something
2      after 1982.  There is no dispute that
3      Mr. Marotta personally believed that smoking
4      could cause lung cancer.
5           That's the expert that they paid to give
6      you the opinion, to look at everything, and to
7      sum it up.  He agrees with us.
8           You've seen the pack warnings and they try
9      to belittle them throughout, but there is no
10      question that, before 1982, every single pack
11      that Mr. Marotta was smoking contained those
12      warnings.
13           Now, was there any proof at all that
14      Mr. Marotta died because of something that R.J.
15      Reynolds said or that if R.J. Reynolds had not
16      said something, that he would have instantly
17      quit smoking, that he would not have gotten
18      lung cancer?  We know his parents smoked and he
19      copied them.  We know his friends smoked and he
20      followed them.
21           Here is what the witnesses said.  We asked
22      each of these witnesses whether they had any
23      evidence or whether they were claiming that
24      Mr. Marotta relied.
25           Phil Marotta, Junior, the plaintiff, his 2672
1      wife, Marie, Andrea, Jill Marotta, Roberto
2      Pinto, and all of them said there is no
3      evidence he relied.
4           Now, Jill Marotta said that her father
5      told her in the hospital he remembered back
6      when he started smoking and he remembered
7      something about a Santa advertisement.
8           I specifically asked her:  Did he tell
9      you, are you claiming that he relied on that,
10      that somehow that is what caused him to start
11      smoking Winstons?  And she said, no.
12           And she said the same thing for the doctor
13      ad.  And I think you saw when I asked Jill
14      Marotta, no one else in the family had ever
15      heard that story.  She had never shared it with
16      anyone.  No one else in the family ever said
17      that Phil Marotta told them why he started
18      smoking.
19           And you'll have to judge the credibility
20      of that statement.  But even Jill Marotta
21      agreed that her father hadn't relied on a Santa
22      ad or something with doctors and she agreed
23      that she didn't even know if they were from
24      R.J. Reynolds.
25           And of course, their expert, Dr. DiFranza, 2673
1      knew all this and he admitted, there is no
2      reliance.
3           Now, you heard a story about Giacomo
4      DeNunzio, Mr. Marotta's partner, when he
5      testified on the stand and we read his
6      deposition, he was contacted by plaintiff's
7      lawyers, a woman named Laura Damiani, she is
8      one of the lawyers for Mr. Marotta.  She's not
9      here today.  But that's what he testified to.
10           She asked him if he would sign an
11      affidavit.  That's sworn testimony that you
12      write down on a piece of paper.  She asked him
13      if he would sign it.  She called him on the
14      phone.  They mailed the affidavit to him, and,
15      sure enough, he signed it.
16           And what did it say.  He signed an
17      affidavit that said, "Mr. Marotta told me that
18      he relied on some things."  You heard his
19      testimony.  What happened?
20           At deposition, when we got the chance to
21      ask him the questions, he said, under oath, the
22      information in the affidavit that the
23      plaintiff's lawyer mailed him was not true, was
24      not true.
25           That's the only attempt by the plaintiffs 2674
1      to prove that something after 1980 was actually
2      seen, seen by Mr. Marotta, actually believed.
3      And it was based on an affidavit that a lawyer
4      wrote that the witness said wasn't true.
5           DeNunzio said he heard the statement, not
6      Mr. Marotta.  He said he saw a TV show, not
7      Mr. Marotta.  It wasn't R.J. Reynolds.  He said
8      Mr. Marotta had no great reaction to it.
9           And when we asked him, did Mr. Marotta
10      tell you when he first learned or believed that
11      smoking could cause cancer?  He said, since he
12      was a teenager.
13           You're going to have to decide whether you
14      believe his sworn testimony or some piece of
15      paper that one of his lawyers got him to sign.
16           Every witness we ask questions like this:
17      Did Mr. Marotta rely on the Frank Statement?
18      Everyone agrees he did not.
19           CTR, TIRC, the Tobacco Institute
20      statements, no one has any evidence that he
21      even saw this stuff, let alone relied on it.
22           And his own expert agrees that there is no
23      evidence of reliance.  If you believe
24      Dr. Proctor -- you don't even believe me.  You
25      believe Dr. Proctor and you believe 2675
1      Dr. DiFranza, then your answer on these
2      questions -- actually, no, no evidence of
3      reliance, no evidence of reliance.
4           Question eight:  No evidence of reliance.
5      Question nine:  No evidence of reliance.
6           Their experts admit that, and they brought
7      them into court to admit that.
8           You heard some evidence about him smoking
9      marijuana.  Now, who cares if he smoked pot,
10      right.  Well, in a lot of ways, we don't care
11      if he smoked pot at all.
12           But consider this, he smoked marijuana for
13      enjoyment.  Cigarettes weren't the only thing
14      he smoked.  He also smoked pot for several
15      years.
16           But there wasn't any advertising for
17      smoking marijuana.  There wasn't a marijuana
18      institute.  There wasn't a marijuana conspiracy
19      or a marijuana council for research.  He smoked
20      marijuana because he liked it.
21           Now, Dr. Fleiter was asked about
22      marijuana, and he actually said one puff might
23      cause lung cancer.  You remember his extreme
24      views?  He's the doctor who came in that -- the
25      pathologist they picked.  They picked a doctor 2676
1      who said that one puff of a cigarette can cause
2      lung cancer.  Do you see any evidence in the
3      world that that's true?
4           Is that credible based on the evidence and
5      your common sense?  And then he said, well, I
6      guess one puff of marijuana can cause lung
7      cancer, too.  Doesn't make any sense.
8           But the fact that he smoked marijuana for
9      enjoyment proves there's nothing to do with the
10      conspiracy here.  It's a man who lived for the
11      moment.  He did what he enjoyed.  He wasn't
12      being deceived, and he certainly didn't rely.
13           Let's talk about the medical case.  I
14      think you ought to take a look at the death
15      certificate when you go back to the jury room.
16      You can ask for any document.  You can ask for
17      the death certificate.
18           But here it is.  This is the official
19      record of what caused his death, and all it
20      says is lung cancer and then it says spread to
21      the bone.
22           Lung cancer.  You see the place where it
23      says, what is this lung cancer due to?  What is
24      this lung cancer caused by?
25           They left it blank.  They left it blank. 2677
1      That is the official determination of death.
2      Lung cancer, no reason, no cause for the lung
3      cancer.  Take a look at the death certificate
4      when you go back.
5           Now, why did they leave it blank?  Why did
6      they not reach a determination of what caused
7      his lung cancer?  Why didn't they say what kind
8      of lung cancer it is?  Because, notice, it
9      doesn't say the cell types that Dr. Fleiter
10      said or the different cell types that Dr. Villa
11      said.  Why?
12           Well, none of his doctors testified, not
13      one doctor in this trial that actually saw
14      Mr. Marotta came to court, and ask yourself why
15      is that.
16           If it was so obvious that his doctors
17      believed that, wouldn't one of them come in?
18      Couldn't they have found one of them to say it?
19      None of his doctors testified that he was
20      addicted.  And none of his doctors testified
21      that addiction caused his cancer.  None.
22           Now, the medical records themselves also
23      have a complete lack of proof.  There isn't a
24      single medical record in this case that says
25      smoking causes lung cancer.  There is not a 2678
1      single medical record in this case that says
2      addiction causes lung cancer.
3           So I was surprised to hear Mr. Freidin
4      say -- talk to you about a doctor named
5      Dr. Goscin.
6           Have you ever heard of Dr. Goscin until
7      Mr. Freidin mentioned him?  And you can ask for
8      this record as well.  G-O-S-C-I-N.  That's the
9      doctor that Mr. Freidin claimed reached a
10      determination that it was a smoking-related
11      cancer.
12           How can that be?  Because I'm telling you
13      the evidence is none of his doctors, none of
14      his doctors determined that.  Well, one of us
15      is right.  Let's look at the facts.
16           Of course Mr. Freidin didn't show you what
17      he was claiming, did he?  This is the pathology
18      report, Phil Marotta.  Look who signed it,
19      that's the Dr. Goscin.  Dr. Goscin that
20      Mr. Freidin was talking about.
21           Look what he says.  The diagnosis is a
22      needle aspiration biopsy, we know that.  He
23      says, large cell.
24           There isn't anything on this record, see,
25      nothing that says smoking.  Nothing that says 2679
1      smoking is the cause.  And even if it was large
2      cell, does he reach a conclusion of what caused
3      it?  Mr. Freidin told you that this Dr. Goscin
4      had somehow decided it.
5           The facts say that statement just wasn't
6      true.  And you can ask for any medical record,
7      and you won't find any doctor, that's why they
8      didn't come in here, that's why the death
9      certificate is blank.
10           Everyone agrees that he got lung cancer at
11      an extremely unusual age.  Right off the bat,
12      we knew this was an unusual case, and their
13      experts agree.
14           It was so unusual, they did a study on a
15      million men and women, about a hundred thousand
16      of them were male smokers.  They found out
17      about 1,772 died of lung cancer.  Only 31 were
18      men under the age of 50.  Biggest study done,
19      less than 2 percent of the people get lung
20      cancer at such an early age.
21           All the experts agree it was unusual.  But
22      the plaintiff's expert, Dr. Villa, who they
23      brought in, good doctor, a very nice man, he
24      talked about his charity.  He admitted, though,
25      right off the bat, the first thing you think 2680
1      about in a case this young is a family history,
2      a family history, something in their genes.  He
3      said it raised a red flag that something other
4      than smoking was involved.  That's not our
5      expert.  That's their expert who they paid to
6      testify.
7           This was his testimony.  He used this
8      phrase, the family has genetic abnormalities.
9      The family has genetic abnormalities.  That's
10      their expert.  He said that these genetic
11      abnormalities, the family history is very
12      significant, very significant.  Those, again,
13      were his words, their expert.
14           He said it could increase the risk of lung
15      cancer five times even if you smoke, and he had
16      to say that because that's what the Surgeon
17      General has decided.
18           If parents have a history of lung cancer,
19      it's a five-fold increase in the lung cancer
20      risk and look what they say, after cigarette
21      smoking.
22           So what that means is you look at smokers,
23      and smokers have a higher chance of getting
24      cancer.  If they have a family history, it's
25      five times that, five times that of the smoking 2681
1      risk.
2           There wasn't any evidence to dispute this.
3      Five times.  So the risk from smoking is over
4      here.  The risk for family history is five
5      times greater.
6           And Dr. Villa admitted that even if he had
7      never smoked, people with this kind of family
8      history can get lung cancer, and that's why
9      you'll have to decide.  That's why his doctors
10      never found that cancer was caused by smoking.
11           One of his doctors thought, not
12      Mr. Marotta, as Mr. Freidin said, one of his
13      doctors thought it was the family history of
14      asbestosis, because his parents didn't just
15      have lung cancer.  Both his mother and his
16      father had asbestos-related disease.
17           This is his own doctor's record.  Where
18      was this doctor?  Did he come in to testify?
19      No.  They hired people from Philadelphia and a
20      doctor from Miami who had never seen him.
21           This doctor thought asbestos was
22      contributory.  Now, is that why the death
23      certificate is blank?  Is that why there is no
24      official cause of death in the record?  Is that
25      why none of his doctors concluded that smoking 2682
1      had caused his cancer?  That's for you to
2      decide.
3           But everyone agrees that the cell type,
4      whether it's genetics, asbestos, everyone
5      agrees that if he had BAC, it's not caused by
6      smoking.
7           One of the things we learned, that it
8      wasn't just 1 or 2 percent of the population
9      that gets BAC, it's actually up to 20 percent.
10      And how do we know that?
11           Well, the very last questions that
12      Mr. Freidin was asking our expert, he pulled
13      out the study and he showed him a study of BAC.
14      This was picked by the plaintiff's lawyer.
15           And when Dennis got the chance to
16      redirect, to ask some questions, they pointed
17      out that that study said, the American Cancer
18      Society had looked and done a series of
19      investigations on BAC in the late '80s, just a
20      few years before Mr. Marotta got lung cancer,
21      20 percent -- so all of this stuff about the
22      pennies, it's silly.
23           20 percent of lung cancers are BAC.  But
24      no matter what the statistics are, we're not
25      talking about all the pennies.  We're talking 2683
1      about the penny that's Mr. Marotta, that's the
2      penny we're talking about.  His doctors never
3      determined the cause of his cancer.
4           We know it occurs in younger people.
5      Everyone agrees it's out on the periphery of
6      the lung, and that's right where his cancer
7      was, and it can be invasive and spreads early.
8           Why do we say that?  What was the proof?
9      The World Health Organization, the leading
10      experts on classifying these tumors, there's no
11      dispute this was the classification of BAC at
12      the time that Mr. Marotta got his cancer.
13           There is no dispute, this was the
14      classification of BAC at the time that
15      Mr. Marotta got his cancer.
16           And you see the BACs, they're peripherally
17      situated, at the edge of the lung, everyone
18      agrees, and look what they say, BACs tend to
19      spread early, both within and outside the
20      chest.
21           That's the World Health Organization.
22      They don't know the tobacco company.  They're
23      not hired by the lawyers, like their experts
24      were.  That's what the World Health
25      Organization says. 2684
1           Now, right off the bat, the pathologist
2      that they brought in and that was Dr. Fleiter
3      who writes articles and textbooks.  He goes to
4      conferences, no one denies that he's an expert
5      before, but look what he admitted.
6           They only had a small sample.  They only
7      had a tiny fraction of the tumor.  The tumor
8      was about 2 centimeters.  That's about
9      three-quarters inch wide, a little smaller than
10      a golf ball.
11           And the only part of the tumor that they
12      took was a tiny fraction that could fit in a
13      needle.  He admits that.
14           He says that there's something called
15      interobserver variability.  That just means two
16      guys can get it wrong, two women can get it
17      wrong.  People can disagree.
18           Well, how often do they get it wrong?  He
19      said, in 40 percent of the cases, when you do
20      an autopsy, you find out that the cell type
21      that the doctors thought, that the doctors
22      guessed at was wrong.
23           So if I was going to use the coin analogy
24      again, this is what their own expert said.
25      It's almost like flipping a coin, because if 2685
1      you do an autopsy, 40 percent of the time
2      they're wrong.
3           Well, we know it's true, because none of
4      the experts, none of the evidence that they
5      rely on agrees.
6           You saw that one of the records said large
7      cell, but Dr. Fleiter who they hired to come
8      in, he didn't agree.  He said it was a
9      different type of cancer, adeno.  And then
10      Dr. Villa, who certainly has great experience.
11      We don't doubt that.  He has great experience,
12      look what he said.
13           He said, well, I think it's 50 percent
14      large cell.  It could be 25 percent
15      adenocarcinoma and then, right at the end of
16      his testimony, he said I also see some
17      squamous.
18           So none of them agree, Dr. Villa thinks,
19      well, it could be three different kinds of
20      things and everyone agrees, you just had a tiny
21      sample.
22           Their own experts don't agree with each
23      other.  If they can't convince each other, I
24      submit they shouldn't convince you.
25           As you saw from experts on both sides, the 2686
1      issue of whether his cancer is a BAC turns on
2      whether the cells lining these air sacs are
3      cancer.  Dr. Shmookler who's looked at hundreds
4      and thousands of cases of cancer, he's the head
5      of pathology of one of the largest hospitals in
6      the country.  They like to make fun of him and
7      say, oh, he had the nerve to get a skin cancer
8      pathology certification.
9           They don't tell you he was Board-certified
10      as a pathologist for 35 years, both in
11      anatomical pathology and in clinical pathology.
12           Just like Dr. Villa, their expert, he also
13      got a certification in another area.  But he
14      ran one of the biggest hospitals in the
15      country, their pathology department, and saw
16      hundreds of thousands of cases.
17           Here is what Dr. Shmookler showed you from
18      the slides.  On the right -- sorry -- on the
19      left, you have Mr. Marotta's lung.  Everyone
20      agrees, both experts, that's an air sac.  That
21      white space are the air sacs and, here, look,
22      you don't have all these cells and all these
23      unusual cells on the periphery, away from this,
24      but right along the air sacs.  Clustering along
25      the air sacs, you see this. 2687
1           Now, here is a textbook, what both sides
2      agree is a type of stock photo that doctors
3      use.  This is a textbook photo of BAC.  Look at
4      this.  Compare it to this.
5           Notice the size, very similar.  Notice the
6      shape, very similar.  Notice where they're
7      located.  On the air sac.  On the air sac.
8           You know, the plaintiffs' lawyers talked a
9      lot about our guy wrote a textbook.  But this
10      is the textbook and, in the end, you have two
11      experts saying, I think these cancer cells are
12      cancer, I think these cells are just the result
13      of inflammation.
14           You have to decide.  But when you do that,
15      remember, none of the doctors that actually saw
16      him ever reached the conclusion that it was
17      smoking and that's why the death certificate is
18      blank.
19           Here is another textbook photo of what BAC
20      looks like and here is an actual photo of
21      Mr. Marotta's lung and notice the similarities
22      in the pattern, notice the similarities in the
23      size and shape of the cancer cells.
24           Here is an air sac.  It looks like a lake.
25      You can see the cancer cells, again, clustered 2688
1      around the edges.
2           Same thing if you look at the textbook.
3      Now, shouldn't the experts have done some tests
4      that were available.  Shouldn't you at least
5      have the right to hear whether tests were done?
6           We asked Dr. Fleiter:  There are tests
7      today that can determine cell type, were they
8      done?  No.  There are tests that can determine
9      asbestos?  He says they weren't done.
10           There are tests that can determine if
11      cigarette smoking was the cause?  He talked
12      about various tests on genetics.
13           None of these tests were done.  There is
14      no actual test proof.  What they're saying is
15      these doctors who they hire and who they come
16      in can disagree with the death certificate, can
17      give a contrary opinion to every doctor that
18      saw him.
19           That's what they want you to base their
20      proof on.  But they didn't do any of the tests
21      that might have supported that.
22           Dr. Fleiter said he didn't see anything
23      under the microscope that could say that the
24      cancer is a tobacco cancer.  But look what he
25      admitted. 2689
1           He freely admitted, if they had actually
2      gotten the whole tumor instead of just a tiny
3      fraction, it could have been BAC, he admitted
4      that.
5           Remember when they wrote 100 percent
6      certainty on the board?  Well, Dr. Fleiter
7      wasn't 100 percent certain because he said, if
8      we got the rest of the tumor, it could have
9      been BAC.  He said if we got the rest of the
10      tumor, it could have contained asbestos and, of
11      course, he don't do any tests and no one else
12      did to determine whether that's true.
13           The last thing I want to say about the
14      medical evidence is that we called another one
15      of their experts.  Dr. Neal Messinger is a
16      radiologist.  That means it's a doctor who
17      looks at X-rays and CT scans.
18           He was hired by plaintiffs.  You heard the
19      testimony that he met with Laura Damiani, a
20      lawyer for Mr. Marotta again, and Bob Schack.
21      He said they met with him, they brought the
22      reports to him.  Pretty much similar to what
23      they were talking about with Dr. Shmookler.
24           They didn't call him.  So we read his
25      sworn testimony.  This is the plaintiff's 2690
1      expert on X-rays and CTs.  He says he looks at
2      how many X-rays and CTs a day, a hundred, a
3      hundred a day.  He's seen hundreds, who knows,
4      if not thousands of lung cancers.
5           He was asked, can BAC present the way
6      Mr. Marotta's tumor did?  And he was asked,
7      this was a tumor that grew, it blocked that
8      superior vena cava, that vein that they talked
9      about and he said yes, it can.
10           Can BAC grow enough that it blocks this
11      big vein?  And he said yes, I think it could.
12           He also said that BAC can be an aggressive
13      tumor.
14           Well, they didn't call him and you'll see
15      his testimony contradicted - contradicted what
16      Dr. Villa said.
17           So their own radiology expert says it can
18      be BAC.  No doctor ever determined this.
19           Your Honor, is this a good breaking point?
20           THE COURT:  Keep going.
21           MR. BELASIC:  Both sides have talked to
22      you about the burden of proof.  We've already
23      discussed this first part.
24           It's their burden to prove Phil Marotta
25      had a type of lung cancer caused by smoking. 2691
1      It's their burden to prove that their
2      conclusion, which is different than the doctors
3      who saw him, is supported by evidence.
4           Now we have two interlinking issues.  You
5      have to decide if Phil Marotta was addicted,
6      and you have to decide whether addiction was
7      the legal cause of Phil Marotta's death.
8           Now, you heard a lot of talk by
9      Mr. Freidin this morning, about addiction.
10           What you didn't hear very much of is this
11      part:  Was addiction a legal cause of Phil
12      Marotta's death?
13           Well, they brought Dr. DiFranza to the
14      stand and he talked all about addiction, but
15      one thing he didn't testify to was that
16      addiction was a legal cause or addiction was a
17      cause of Mr. Marotta's cancer.
18           Their own expert never said that.  We know
19      that none of the actual doctors who really saw
20      Mr. Marotta reached that conclusion.  We know
21      there are no medical records that say addiction
22      was the cause of the lung cancer.
23           We know the death certificate doesn't even
24      list a cause of cancer.  It doesn't say smoking
25      and, obviously, it doesn't say addiction. 2692
1           You've heard this, that in order for the
2      plaintiffs to prove that addiction caused lung
3      cancer, it has to involve at least three
4      things.  It has to be a direct cause, not
5      indirect.  It has to be continuous, continuous
6      addiction, causation of lung cancer, and it has
7      to be substantial.
8           At the very beginning of this case,
9      Mr. Alvarez said, we want you to know that we
10      take responsibility for Mr. Marotta causing his
11      own injury.  He quickly said it was just
12      partial.
13           But they said that from the very
14      beginning, and if you look at the jury
15      instructions, Judge Tuter instructs you that
16      the plaintiff is legally responsible for
17      causing his injury.
18           You have to decide the percentage, if you
19      reach it.  But let's think about what does that
20      mean.  Why on earth would Phil Marotta, the
21      son, admit that his father was legally
22      responsible for causing his own cancer?
23           Well, first, it has to mean that
24      Mr. Marotta knew that smoking was dangerous.
25      It has to mean that he chose to continue to 2693
1      quit.  Because if Mr. Marotta didn't really
2      know any of the dangers, they would never say
3      he was legally responsible for causing his own
4      injury.  They'd say he's blameless.
5           It has to mean, when they admit this, that
6      Mr. Marotta had the ability to quit.  Because
7      if he didn't have the ability to quit, why on
8      earth would the plaintiff in this case and the
9      lawyers tell you that he caused his own injury,
10      at least in part.  They wouldn't.  He would be
11      blameless if he didn't have the ability to
12      quit.
13           And it has to mean that Mr. Marotta had
14      the ability to quit smoking at a time that
15      would have prevented his death.  Because if he
16      couldn't quit, or if it was too late, then how
17      could they admit that he was legally
18      responsible for causing his injury?
19           That's what they said off the bat and
20      that's what Mr. Marotta said when he took the
21      stand.
22           But that's not what you heard in this
23      trial.  They call experts to say the exact
24      opposite.  They brought an expert, DiFranza,
25      that said, well, no matter how he tried, he 2694
1      couldn't quit.  How can that make sense?
2           They tell you on the one hand, he's
3      legally responsible for causing his own injury,
4      and you heard Judge Tuter's instructions,
5      because he basically didn't try hard enough.
6      You'll read the instruction.
7           And then their expert comes in and says,
8      oh, no, he couldn't quit smoking.  Well, which
9      is it?
10           Their expert says that nicotine addiction
11      controlled Mr. Marotta, that he was caught in
12      some cycle.  He had no choice.  He said there
13      was nothing more he could do.
14           Remember Dr. DiFranza, nothing more he
15      could do.  You have to decide, does that make
16      sense?  You don't get to choose, though,
17      whether they should be bound by their
18      admission.  You don't get to choose that,
19      because Judge Tuter's instruction is clear.
20           The plaintiffs have admitted, and you are
21      required to find that Mr. Marotta caused his
22      own injury.
23           Sure, if you get to the question, you can
24      decide a percentage.  But you are not allowed
25      to say he didn't cause his own injury.  And 2695
1      that means that he was able to quit, and we
2      know that from the experts.  That means that he
3      could have quit and avoided his injury.
4      Otherwise, they would never have admitted it.
5           You'll have to decide why they then called
6      experts to contradict almost everything they
7      said on this issue.
8           Now, we're going to show, and we're going
9      to review some of the evidence, that addiction
10      was not a direct cause of his death and, of
11      course, none of their experts said this.  They
12      didn't even ask -- Dr. DiFranza didn't even
13      testify on that issue.
14           That it wasn't continuous.  There isn't
15      continuous evidence of addiction, let alone
16      that it was caused.  We know his own doctors
17      didn't say this and we know that the plaintiff
18      is admitting, in effect, that Mr. Marotta could
19      have quit and, therefore, he is responsible for
20      his own death.
21           Now, there was a lot of talk about
22      Dr. Benowitz and it's true, he was the
23      plaintiff's expert.  You saw him.  He's no
24      friend of the tobacco industry, obviously.  He
25      talked about the dangers of smoking and he 2696
1      talked about nicotine.
2           But we called him in our case because, as
3      he told you, he has done more research on
4      nicotine than anyone in the world.  He was the
5      scientific editor for the Surgeon General's
6      report on addiction.
7           So the Surgeon General, the doctor with
8      the beard, when he comes out and talks about
9      it, the man he hired, the man who was the top
10      scientist, who wrote the report and who did
11      more research than anyone, that's who we
12      called.
13           Don't let them suggest that, hey, R.J.
14      Reynolds didn't call anyone on addiction.  We
15      called the most qualified person in the
16      country, according to the plaintiffs.
17           We know Mr. Marotta could have avoided his
18      cancer if he had quit.  The Surgeon General
19      tells us.
20           "After ten years of quitting, your risk
21      begins to approach that of one who has never
22      smoked."
23           After ten years of quitting, your risk
24      goes almost all the way down to a person who
25      has never smoked. 2697
1           He got his cancer in 1994.  If he quit in
2      1984, his risk could have gone back to normal.
3      If he quit in the '70s or the '60s or the '50s,
4      all of the times where he never even tried to
5      quit, he could have avoided his injury.
6           I'm not going to say a lot about
7      addiction.  You're going to use your common
8      sense.  The issue here is whether addiction was
9      the cause of his cancer.
10           But Dr. DiFranza came in, and it was a
11      little surprising.  He used this psychiatric
12      manual.  And I asked him, have you ever used it
13      before in your practice?  No, not once.  They
14      brought a guy in who had never used the
15      psychiatric manual.
16           Why?  Well, because he's not a
17      psychiatrist.  He's not licensed to practice as
18      a psychiatrist.  He came in here basically
19      pretending to be a psychiatrist.
20           The very book he used says you can't do
21      that.  It's important that DSM-IV not be
22      applied mechanically by an untrained
23      individual.
24           And he said, you know, the only time I use
25      this DSM-IV is in cases where the tobacco 2698
1      plaintiff lawyers hire me to do it.  He's not
2      qualified on that issue.
3           You'll have to decide why they even tried
4      to do that.
5           But what we do know, because I asked
6      Dr. DiFranza, is that even if there is a
7      diagnosis under this psychiatric manual, it
8      doesn't mean you can't control your behavior.
9           It says, "the fact that an individual
10      meets the criteria for a DSM-IV diagnosis
11      doesn't carry any necessary implication
12      regarding the individual's degree of control
13      over his behavior."
14           You know, I showed that to Dr. DiFranza
15      and he didn't know.  He said -- I asked him,
16      did you even read the book that you relied on?
17      And he said, well, I read the introduction.
18      And then I had to point out that that's exactly
19      where it's from, the introduction.
20           So I don't know what was up.  You have to
21      decide what he was doing when he was making
22      those claims under oath.
23           He said, well, you know, everyone can quit
24      except the heavy smokers.  He made a big deal
25      out of it.  He said in my 32 years, I've never 2699
1      seen a research study that said heavy smokers
2      can quit.  I said, is that really true.
3           I showed him what took me a half hour to
4      find, remember those questions, and he said, I
5      think you're trying to trick me.  I asked him,
6      well, wait a second, you said in 32 years,
7      you've never even seen it.
8           Well, here it is in probably the most
9      obvious source available, the National Cancer
10      Institute and American Cancer Society study.
11      Their expert apparently had never heard of
12      this.
13           They followed a million smokers and of the
14      people who smoked two packs a day or more,
15      54 percent had quit.  Now, look at the period,
16      1959, the exact year that Mr. Marotta smoked
17      his first cigarette, from '59 to '72.
18           That's only about 12 or 13 years.
19      Mr. Marotta smoked for more than 30.  In just
20      12 years, more than half of the people who were
21      heavy smokers, who smoked two packs a day quit.
22           Don't let anyone here tell you that there
23      was evidence that it's impossible to do it
24      because Dr. DiFranza wasn't even aware of the
25      evidence. 2700
1           They can quit.  Half of them quit in just
2      12 years.  We know the government says, and the
3      studies suggest, that everyone can quit
4      smoking.  That's the official position of the
5      experts at the United States Government.  It's
6      not a tobacco company issue.
7           This is what the antismoking experts at
8      the government said, everyone can quit.
9      Dr. Benowitz, he wrote the book.  He literally
10      wrote the Surgeon General's report on
11      addiction.
12           He was the scientific editor and reviewed
13      it.  He said any smoker can quit.  60 million
14      people have quit smoking.  90 percent of the
15      people who quit did it without any help.
16           You know, gum was available.  Nicotine gum
17      was available.  And I suppose if Mr. Marotta
18      really wanted to quit, he would have at least
19      tried it.  And if Mr. Marotta really wanted to
20      quit, he would have taken five minutes and saw
21      his doctor and asked for help.
22           We know he didn't do any of those things.
23      That's not an excuse.  90 percent of these
24      people, 60 million people did it without any
25      help of any kind, including those two pack a 2701
1      day smokers.
2           Dr. Benowitz, he wrote the Surgeon
3      General's report on addiction which said, even
4      if a smoker is addicted, it doesn't mean he
5      couldn't quit.
6           The government says that the people who do
7      quit, are they less addicted, is that the
8      reason that they quit and the addicted people
9      can't?  No, it's not true.
10           The people continue to smoke, they're not
11      more addicted than those who stop.  It's not
12      addiction.  It's the people who make the choice
13      to quit.
14           Now, what about that choice?  Does
15      nicotine stop it?  Dr. Benowitz, done more
16      nicotine research than anyone in the world
17      says, nothing that nicotine does prevents a
18      smoker from understanding that cigarette causes
19      disease.  It doesn't affect your thinking.  It
20      doesn't affect your mental abilities and it
21      definitely doesn't prevent you from
22      understanding all of the warnings, all of the
23      warnings that Mr. Marotta received.
24           He said that within a few weeks of
25      quitting, the number of receptors in the brain 2702
1      are normal and within days or up to a couple of
2      weeks, withdrawal symptoms, like irritability
3      are gone.
4           Sure, we know Mr. Marotta reported that he
5      was irritable, we know he told people that.
6      Someone said he was uncomfortable.  Someone
7      said he was frustrated.  It goes away in a few
8      days and that's the plaintiff's expert.  We
9      called him to the stand, but he was the
10      plaintiff's expert.
11           This is what the American Cancer Society
12      and Dr. Benowitz said are correct.  "Do you
13      have what it takes to stop smoking?"  Three
14      questions and think about whether Mr. Marotta
15      could answer these.  "Do you want to stop
16      smoking?"  They say, well, he did.
17           "Are you willing to make some changes in
18      your routine?"  They say, well, he did.
19           "Are you willing to put up with some
20      uneasy moments after stopping?
21           "If you answer yes to all three questions,
22      you can stop smoking."
23           And Dr. Benowitz who wrote the Surgeon
24      General's report says that's true, that's true.
25      Those three questions. 2703
1           Now, you heard the evidence, Mr. Marotta
2      was not willing to put up with some of the
3      uneasy moments.  He didn't like the
4      irritability and the frustration and, after a
5      few hours, he picked up his cigarette again and
6      then he'd wait another year and he'd quit for a
7      couple of hours, and then he'd wait for lent or
8      New Year's.
9           All of those days in between, he would do
10      nothing to try to quit smoking.  That's what
11      his family members said, a couple of times a
12      year.
13           Dr. Benowitz said there's two keys to
14      quitting.  Motivation, it's obvious.  If you're
15      not motivated, you can't quit.  Persistence
16      means you have to make a serious effort and you
17      need to be persistent.
18           You don't take a year off, like
19      Mr. Marotta did.
20           Now, was he really motivated to quit?
21      Here is what his son said.  Never really tried.
22      I asked him that.  He said, oh, he tried and
23      then I had to pull out his sworn testimony from
24      before the trial -- sworn testimony that the
25      plaintiff said that he was reading during this 2704
1      trial, and his sworn testimony was that his
2      father never really tried.
3           I asked him, you think your father was
4      motivated?  He said he didn't know.
5           Now he's suing and you found out that
6      they're suing for $27 million.  And the lead
7      plaintiff says, under oath, that his father
8      never really tried and that he doesn't even
9      know if his father was motivated to quit, and
10      he wants to be a millionaire nine times over
11      for the choice that he's now second guessing.
12           Marie, Mr. Marotta's wife, said that they
13      stopped for a few hours for lent and New Year's
14      and that that was stupid.  And she said it was
15      just something we did.  It wasn't a plan like
16      you'd make a diet plan and you'd stick to it.
17      It was just something that they did every year
18      and that they knew they really weren't going to
19      quit.  That's why she called it stupid.
20           Now, ask yourself, what did Mr. Marotta do
21      the other 364 days of the year or the other 363
22      days of the year?  There isn't any testimony
23      that he made any effort to cut down on his
24      smoking or to even try to quit.  Once a year,
25      at lent or New Year's, for a few hours. 2705
1           His partner, Mr. DeNunzio said he didn't
2      know if he was motivated or he wanted to quit.
3      These are the people who loved him.  These are
4      the people who knew him best.  It's not some
5      tobacco company doctor.  These are the people
6      who knew him.  These are the people that you
7      could trust to tell the truth about him.
8           They didn't even know if he was motivated.
9      In fact, Andrea Bacener, the youngest daughter,
10      took the stand and said -- she was 17 when her
11      father died.  In all that time, she said she
12      never, never saw her father try to quit
13      smoking.
14           Pretty startling when you consider the
15      claims that they were making in the beginning
16      of this case and how her testimony contradicts
17      that of her brother, Phil, and contradicts that
18      of the testimony of her sister, Jill.
19           Andrea said she never saw her father try
20      to quit.
21           Well, why didn't he try to quit or why
22      wasn't he motivated?  Well, he lived for the
23      moment and we know, everyone agrees, that he
24      told his partner, "don't worry, by the time I
25      get lung cancer, I'll be 80 years old." 2706
1           He knew the risk of lung cancer.  He
2      wasn't relying on something that he never saw,
3      on all of the things that Dr. Proctor said
4      weren't relevant.  He wasn't relying on that.
5      He knew.
6           Well, how persistent were these efforts.
7      I mean, Dr. Benowitz said the scientific
8      definition of a serious attempt to quit smoking
9      is 24 hours.
10           We know that he never made any effort
11      until 1977.  Remember this chart.  I showed it
12      to Dr. DiFranza.  1959, first cigarette.
13           1977, the year daughter Andrea is born.
14      His wife testified that the very first time he
15      ever made any effort to stop smoking was down
16      here around 1977.
17           And I showed this to Dr. DiFranza.
18      Remember how Dr. DiFranza and I disagreed on
19      almost every part of the facts.  He actually
20      claimed the daughters lived with Mr. Marotta
21      after they were divorced and he was dead wrong.
22           He actually claimed that Mr. Marotta and
23      his wife tried to quit together after the
24      1980's.  We had to show him the testimony.  He
25      was wrong again. 2707
1           But what he agreed with is that this is
2      true.  All of these years, from '59 to '77,
3      thousands and thousands of days, Mr. Marotta
4      made no effort to quit smoking.
5           And after that, he stopped a few hours a
6      year, less than once a year in the '80s.
7           I asked Dr. DiFranza -- all of us make New
8      Year's resolutions and a lot of people, it's a
9      diet, I'm going to go on a diet, or maybe the
10      spouse says, honey, I think you need to lose a
11      few pounds and the spouse says, sure, I will.
12           Use your common sense.  If someone went on
13      a diet for a couple of hours New Year's morning
14      and doesn't diet for the rest of the year,
15      would any of us say that person was making a
16      serious commitment to lose weight?
17           If you get on the treadmill or if a friend
18      of yours gets on the treadmill one day out of
19      the year for a short period of time, the other
20      364 days doesn't exercise, would anyone say
21      that they were making a serious commitment to
22      exercise?
23           Would any of you say that they really
24      wanted to lose weight or that they really
25      wanted to exercise?  But that's what 2708
1      Mr. Marotta was doing.
2           But that was his choice.  I'm not second
3      guessing him and neither should you, because
4      the evidence doesn't second guess him.
5           This is what the people who loved him
6      actually said under oath:  A couple of times a
7      year, once a year, a few hours a year.  The
8      rest of the time, no effort at all.  Never told
9      a doctor that he wanted to quit.  Never asked
10      for help.
11           The people who knew him the most didn't
12      even know if he was motivated.
13           That's what his ex-wife said.  We tried to
14      quit a couple of times.  Never went further
15      than a few hours.  It was stupid.  She said it
16      wasn't a real plan.  She said they knew they
17      would be smoking shortly thereafter.
18           Now, in the end, did you see any evidence
19      that Mr. Marotta is different than all the
20      60 million people who quit or all of the heavy
21      smokers who quit?  Because this includes
22      everyone, the people that start at 12, the
23      people that start at 15, the people that smoke
24      two packs a day.
25           The cigarettes that he was smoking wasn't 2709
1      more addictive.  There wasn't any evidence that
2      there was something in his brain.  Certainly he
3      didn't see any different advertising.  We know
4      he didn't see any tobacco company statements,
5      period.  Their own experts say he didn't rely
6      on anything the tobacco company said.
7           Did he smoke more than the smokers that
8      quit?  We saw the evidence, millions of the
9      heavy smokers were quitting.
10           What his partner says is he lived in the
11      moment.  He didn't get serious about quitting.
12      His own son said, under oath, when I showed him
13      his testimony, he never really tried.
14           You have to weigh that evidence and decide
15      whether he should be responsible, like the
16      plaintiffs say, for his own choice to continue
17      smoking and to not try to quit.
18           We know you can, if you make the decision.
19      Look what the Surgeon General said, no one can
20      make you quit and no one can make Mr. Marotta
21      quit.  No one could do it for him.
22           But the Surgeon General says that, even if
23      cigarette smoking is addictive, the individual
24      is still responsible.  Look -- this is Surgeon
25      General Koop, look what he says:  "The 2710
1      individual smoker -- even though cigarette
2      smoking is addictive, it's the individual
3      smoker has to decide whether or not to continue
4      that behavior."
5           They make fun of the common sense notion
6      that smoking is a choice.  How can they?  It's
7      a legal product that people can choose to
8      smoke.  We have a right to sell it.  They have
9      a right to make that choice.
10           And 60 million people choose to quit.
11      They're now second guessing the decisions of
12      this smoker and saying that they should each
13      get a 9 million-dollar check because of what
14      their father -- and I understand.  Everyone in
15      this room is going to face the tragedy of a
16      loved one dying, maybe all of us already have.
17      And we all have sympathy.  No one doesn't have
18      sympathy for Mr. Marotta and for his sisters.
19           But ask yourself, why do they get
20      $9 million because of a decision that the
21      Surgeon General says the smoker is responsible
22      for.
23           Dr. Benowitz wrote that report.  He wrote
24      the Surgeon General's report.  He said, smoking
25      does not cause a smoker to lose the ability to 2711
1      be responsible for their own actions.
2           And they can say, you're a bunch of liars.
3      It's a bunch of conspiracy.  It's fraudulent,
4      et cetera.
5           But you know the truth from his own loved
6      ones, that he knew from back when he was a
7      teenager it could cause cancer.  From his own
8      experts, that nothing a tobacco company said
9      influenced him.
10           We know from their own experts that
11      smokers are still responsible and we know from
12      their own position in this case, he could have
13      quit smoking.  He could have avoided his
14      cancer.  That's why they say he's responsible
15      for causing it and that's what Judge Tuter will
16      instruct you.
17           Your Honor?
18           THE COURT:  You can keep going.
19           MR. BELASIC:  Dr. Koop, they showed his
20      videotapes from back in the '80s and the '90s.
21           Here is what he said in the 2000s.
22      "Ultimately the smoker, you are the one that
23      has control over your behavior.  We know the
24      cigarette won't light itself.  No matter how
25      much you've smoked, the choice is always 2712
1      yours."
2           You know, he didn't say if you smoke two
3      packs a day, you're not responsible for your
4      behavior, like their expert did.  The Surgeon
5      General says, "no matter how much you light up,
6      the choice is always yours."
7           And for those reasons, you should find no
8      on question one.  None of his doctors reached
9      the conclusion that their paid experts say.
10      The death certificate didn't find it.  They
11      told you that Dr. Goscin found it and now we
12      know that that just wasn't true.
13           You should answer no.  Addiction wasn't
14      causing this cancer.  Addiction wasn't forcing
15      him to have no choice.
16           He wasn't tied to the wheel of a car with
17      no brakes.  He wasn't hurdling down a highway
18      with no ability to stop the car, like every
19      movie we've all seen.
20           Every smoker, according to the Surgeon
21      General, every smoker, according to the man who
22      wrote the Surgeon General, has the
23      responsibility and the ability to choose to
24      quit.  He wasn't in a runaway car.  He could
25      get off the highway.  He could stop. 2713
1           Now, they talked about negligence.  Well,
2      we already know, from their own experts and
3      from the testimony of all his loved ones, that
4      he didn't rely on anything a tobacco company
5      said.
6           That's what Dr. DiFranza admitted.  That's
7      what Dr. Proctor admitted.  So nothing a
8      tobacco company said caused his death.
9           What's the negligence?  Well, R.J.
10      Reynolds sold cigarettes that caused cancer,
11      but you cannot find -- Judge Tuter's instructed
12      you, that you cannot find liability based on
13      the fact that smoking is dangerous.
14           R.J. Reynolds agrees, smoking can cause
15      lung cancer.  Smoking can cause those diseases.
16      The government knows that, society knows that,
17      and, yet, cigarettes are still a legal product.
18           And Judge Tuter instructs you, you cannot
19      hold the tobacco companies liable for lawful
20      activity.
21           Well, what's the negligence?  What's the
22      negligence?
23           MR. ALVAREZ:  Objection, Judge, Engle.
24           THE COURT:  Overruled.
25           MR. BELASIC:  Mr. Alvarez didn't give a 2714
1      specific example of negligence.  He kept
2      talking about the same thing.  You said
3      something that was misleading.  That's what he
4      said.
5           But we already know, his experts already
6      said he didn't rely on anything a tobacco
7      company said, and his best friends and the
8      people that loved him say that he knew, as a
9      teenager, it could cause cancer.  He saw his
10      own parents die, and he didn't try to quit
11      smoking.
12           What's the negligence?  Is there any
13      connection between the advertising?  We know
14      that's not true.  Is there something that a
15      tobacco company -- that some tobacco could have
16      done that wasn't advertising or that wasn't a
17      statement?  Where is it?
18           Sure, they could go out of business, and I
19      think that's the suggestion of Dr. Proctor.
20      He's, like, well, don't sell or take all the
21      nicotine out.
22           Look at Judge Tuter's instruction.  It's
23      legal to sell cigarettes, even though they have
24      all the nicotine that's in the plant.  Well,
25      Dr. Benowitz, their expert, admits, actually, 2715
1      when they make the cigarette, there's actually
2      less nicotine than it's in the plant.
3           You can't find negligence on that.  They
4      didn't make a connection between these Engle
5      findings.  I mean -- sometimes I envy the
6      plaintiff's lawyers.  It would be great to come
7      in and say, hey, another court found these
8      things, and you can put up all those statements
9      and they can make you mad.
10           But, in the end, what they have to prove
11      is that something in the Engle findings, some
12      of that conduct actually was the legal cause,
13      the reason that Mr. Marotta died.  And nothing
14      that the tobacco company said had an affect.
15      Their own experts admitted that.
16           We know advertising didn't.  Their own
17      experts admitted it, and they haven't shown an
18      act of negligence that, but for, that if it
19      wouldn't have happened, he wouldn't have gotten
20      cancer, that he would have suddenly quit and
21      avoided it.
22           They never specified that.  It was a
23      failure of proof, and you have to find no.
24           Well, the other question is were the
25      defective and dangerous cigarettes, were the 2716
1      cigarettes, the defect, a legal cause of his
2      lung cancer?
3           Well, they brought Dr. Proctor.  He's not
4      an expert on cigarette defects.  He's a history
5      professor, but they brought him to talk about
6      that.  And he said no cigarette is safe.
7           You can't light tobacco on fire or any
8      other plant and suck smoke into your lungs
9      without exposing yourself to the chemicals that
10      are in the smoke.  He said you can't make a
11      safe cigarette.
12           Where did they show that it's the
13      defective product that caused it?  What defect?
14           Dr. Proctor said there were ingredients,
15      he talked about ingredients, and he admitted,
16      I'm not claiming that any special ingredient
17      caused his cancer.  He says he doesn't know.
18           He's not claiming that Winstons are more
19      dangerous than any other cigarette.  There's no
20      evidence, in this case, that Winstons are any
21      more dangerous than the thousands of other
22      brands that 50 million Americans continue to
23      smoke because the government says they have a
24      right to.  There's no evidence of that.
25           Where is the connection to Mr. Marotta? 2717
1      If you ask yourselves right off the bat, how
2      did the defect cause the cancer, and you know
3      you can't find -- Judge Tuter tells you -- you
4      can't find the companies liable just for
5      selling ordinary cigarettes.
6           Ask yourself, what is this defect?  What
7      was the evidence?  Was there an expert that
8      connected the Engle finding on defect to the
9      smoker?
10           And, of course, that assumes that his
11      smoking was caused by cancer in the first
12      place, and we know all of the reasons why they
13      have failed to prove that.
14           So you should check no on number four.
15           Your Honor, can I ask my remaining time?
16           THE COURT:  You still have 30 minutes.
17           MR. BELASIC:  Okay.  The next question is
18      question five, and that's, what was the
19      percentage of fault?
20           Now, as Mr. Alvarez correctly explained,
21      you find no on these questions, you're not even
22      going to reach this issue, not going to reach
23      this issue, and based on what we discussed and
24      the sworn testimony from their experts, not
25      ours, from their experts, and from the loved 2718
1      ones, the people that knew him and cared about
2      him.
3           We didn't bring in tobacco company hired
4      guns to say, we found something out about what
5      he knew.  These were his family, the people
6      that loved him.  They're the ones that confirm
7      our story.  So you shouldn't even be reaching
8      this issue.
9           But if you do, let's talk about it.  They
10      talk about comparative fault, and Mr. Alvarez
11      says this is the story of a 12-year-old against
12      a giant corporation.  Well, no, it isn't,
13      ladies and gentlemen.
14           He didn't smoke and stop when he was 12.
15      He smoked for 30 years.  He made decisions as
16      an adult.  And he unquestionably made
17      decisions, when he knew, even when he was in
18      school, that it could cause cancer.
19           They want to act like you take one
20      cigarette at 12, and you are never again
21      responsible for your smoking.  And, yet, they
22      said -- I mean, I thought they promised you in
23      opening, we're taking responsibility.  He was a
24      legal cause of his own injury.
25           I mean, imagine if you applied this 2719
1      standard to drinking.  I suppose some of us in
2      this courtroom had a beer before the age of 18.
3      I suppose some of us in this courtroom, you
4      know, had a drink of liquor behind the junior
5      high before the age of 18.
6           Would anyone seriously claim that, from
7      that moment on, you now avoid all
8      responsibility, you are no longer at fault
9      because you weren't 18?  That raises another
10      issue.
11           When he started smoking in New York, it
12      was a crime to sell cigarettes or furnish them
13      to a minor.  Dr. Proctor agreed.  The legal age
14      was 18, and, yet, he smoked anyway.
15           And now they're trying to say he doesn't
16      have any responsibility or what, he only has
17      10 percent.  How on earth did they come up with
18      that number?
19           Well, he only has 10 percent because his
20      first cigarette was at a certain age.  So I
21      guess when he was 18 years old, or 21 or 25, he
22      had no responsibility.  That's their theory.
23           And all I can ask is that you look at all
24      the evidence from the people who loved him, and
25      that you make a fair and open-minded decision 2720
1      based on that evidence, not what some lawyer
2      says.
3           All throughout school, "cancer sticks",
4      "nicotine fit", his best friend said he would
5      have known those terms.  He knew smoking caused
6      cancer when he was a teenager.
7           The Surgeon General's report, these pack
8      warnings, they came out when he was in school
9      or right after school.  Then he sees his
10      parents die, and he doesn't even try to quit.
11      He doesn't even try to quit.
12           He waits until his daughter is born in
13      1977, and that's -- Dr. Proctor admitted that
14      that kind of personal tragedy is one of the
15      most potent sources of awareness of the risk.
16           And Dr. DiFranza, their expert, admitted
17      there's no doubt that, by the time his parents
18      died, he believed smoking could cause lung
19      cancer, and he didn't even try to quit then.
20           I guess he waited until the next New
21      Year's, according to his wife.  He quit for a
22      couple of hours, and she says, at one in the
23      morning, we're smoking again.
24           How can he have only 10 percent
25      responsibility when, in 1966, every single day, 2721
1      every single 10, 15, 20-minute period, he's
2      seeing the health warning?  Is he trying to
3      quit in '66?  No.
4           His wife says almost 20 years, he makes no
5      effort whatsoever to quit.  That's her
6      testimony.
7           In 1970, the warning is even stronger and,
8      again, he makes no effort, according to his
9      wife.
10           Even in '85, when it says smoking causes
11      lung cancer, no effort to quit smoking.  His
12      partner, DeNunzio, his partner, Pinto, say he
13      quit less than once a year.  Those were the men
14      who lived with him for ten straight years.  He
15      quit less than once a year.
16           Now, when they take responsibility and
17      they tell you it was his actions, his failure
18      to make sufficient efforts to quit that caused
19      his death, it doesn't mean that he's 10 percent
20      responsible.
21           Because, according to their theory, he was
22      capable of quitting.  It's not a percentage
23      thing.  You know, if two cars crash and both
24      people are looking out the window, both people
25      are on cell phones or, God forbid, there is a 2722
1      three-car pileup, sure, there's a lot of shared
2      responsibility.  Not everyone is responsible.
3           Those kinds of accidents, where they have
4      multiple causes, that's not an all or nothing.
5      But this case is a simple decision.  Could he
6      quit or not?
7           The plaintiffs say, when they accept
8      responsibility, that he could have quit, and
9      that's a reason that he caused his own cancer.
10           This isn't like those car crashes.  Either
11      he could quit or he didn't.  Mr. Alvarez said
12      in opening, everyone can quit smoking, and
13      that's why we take personal responsibility.
14      You hold him to that promise.  You hold
15      Mr. Marotta to his testimony, that his father
16      was responsible, and review the Surgeon
17      General's evidence, that everyone can quit
18      smoking.
19           They say, well, he's not responsible
20      because he tried so hard.  And Dr. DiFranza
21      says, there wasn't anything else he could do.
22           All I ask you to do is review that
23      testimony in your mind.  The people that loved
24      him said he would fluff me off, he would
25      placate me.  That's what his partner says. 2723
1      Marie says it was stupid.  His son says he
2      never really tried.
3           We're not writing up that evidence.  Those
4      are the people that knew him, and that's what
5      they say under oath.
6           The same testimony that tells you that
7      addiction wasn't the cause of his cancer, even
8      if he was addicted, pick whatever definition
9      you want, you find he was addicted, the same
10      evidence that you reviewed that says addiction
11      really wasn't the cause, his wife, you
12      shouldn't find a percentage of fault here.
13           It's an all or nothing question.  Either
14      he could quit or he didn't.  If he couldn't
15      quit, then they mislead you from the beginning
16      with this testimony.  If he could quit, then
17      the Surgeon General says the smoker is
18      responsible.
19           Notice the Surgeon General didn't say,
20      because of addiction, the tobacco company is
21      responsible.  He said the smoker has to make
22      the choice.
23           Dr. Benowitz, the leading expert in the
24      world on this, says the smoker is responsible.
25      They are the only ones who can quit. 2724
1           No one from R.J. Reynolds could fly to his
2      house, take all the cigarettes out of his house
3      and force him to quit.  His own wife couldn't
4      force him to quit.  His partners who loved him
5      couldn't force him to quit.
6           He had to choose and he had to do more
7      than just a couple of hours a year.  He had to
8      try more than one day out of 365.
9           Now, on question ten, that's damages.
10      You've probably waited throughout the trial to
11      wonder what are they suing for.  You didn't
12      hear it in opening and, obviously, Phil, Jr.
13      and his sisters didn't say how much money they
14      wanted, and now we get the answer.
15           $9 million apiece.  There's no evidence,
16      obviously, in this case, that each of these
17      children deserves to be a millionaire nine
18      times over, because of the choices that they
19      now second guess, the choices that make all of
20      us have sympathy for them.
21           But there's no evidence supporting the
22      9 million.  You've got an arbitrary number
23      pulled out.  The lawyer tells you a number.
24      There is no basis.  Doesn't explain it at all.
25      Immediately says, you can reject it, you could 2725
1      go lower, you could go even higher.
2           But why on earth, why 27 million?  What is
3      this magic number that's being pulled out of a
4      hat here?
5           It defies common sense that the children,
6      no matter how much they love their father, no
7      matter how much they miss him and, of course,
8      they do, we didn't dispute that, it defies
9      common sense that they get to be millionaires
10      nine times over for their father's choices,
11      especially given the testimony that they,
12      themselves, said about whether their father was
13      making serious efforts to quit.
14           Now, they're not asking for medical
15      expenses here or even funeral expenses.
16      They're not claiming economic damages.  They're
17      not saying that their father was giving them
18      money.  It was the other way around.  Phil, Jr.
19      was paying his father rent.
20           They're not claiming lost services, that
21      he was providing anything, he was providing
22      some sort of service.
23           What they're asking for is their own pain
24      and suffering and companionship, and I
25      understand that, but where is the basis for 2726
1      $9 million?  I submit to you it defies common
2      sense.  They've never laid any basis for this.
3           Now, the very last question that you're
4      going to answer is punitive damages.
5           Your Honor, could I ask how much time I
6      have left?
7           THE COURT:  You still have 15 minutes.
8           MR. BELASIC:  15 minutes?
9           THE COURT:  Yes.
10           MR. BELASIC:  This is the last question
11      you're going to answer:  Is the plaintiff
12      entitled to punitive damages under the
13      circumstances of this case?
14           What are punitive damages?  Well, they can
15      only go the plaintiff, Phil Marotta, and to his
16      sisters.  They're not going to go to these
17      organizations.  They're not going to be awarded
18      to a public health agency or a stop smoking
19      clinic.  They're not going to anyone else in
20      the class.
21           So they want $9 million each.  And then if
22      you decide punitives, they're going to ask you
23      for more.
24           We'll have to wait to find out.  I don't
25      think you should even get there.  But 2727
1      $9 million, they say, isn't enough, 9 million
2      apiece.  They want more.
3           Well, what would happen if we pay this?  I
4      mean, is it necessary?  Is it necessary?  You
5      have to decide, is it necessary to deter future
6      bad acts, to deter something, is it necessary
7      to punish?
8           Well, paying that money isn't going to
9      help anyone stop smoking.  It's not going to
10      improve public health.  It certainly won't make
11      cigarettes safer.
12           And when they talk about, well, all these
13      bad things the tobacco company did, and they
14      don't connect them to Mr. Marotta, remember
15      what the judge tells you, those findings don't
16      establish that the plaintiff is entitled to
17      punitive damages.
18           I think it's page 9, but you'll see the
19      instructions on punitive damages and the
20      instructions on these Engle findings.
21           And Judge Tuter commands you that, under
22      the law, you cannot base punitive damages on
23      the findings by that other jury.
24           This evidence has to be clear and
25      convincing.  Their burden of proof on punitives 2728
1      is even greater, and it has to be intentional,
2      that they intentionally did something to kill
3      Phil Marotta.
4           Why would they want to kill their own
5      customers?  Does it make sense?  You can't
6      award punitive damages for harm to others.  All
7      of this talk about youth marketing from 1927, I
8      don't know who they're talking about.
9           I don't know who they're talking about
10      when they show ads for Lucy, Desi and all the
11      ads that their expert admitted, the plaintiff
12      never even saw or that Mr. Marotta never even
13      saw.
14           They're trying to get you, in their
15      argument, to say, well, what about all these
16      other smokers.  But the judge is going to
17      command you, and already has instructed you,
18      you can't award any punitive damages for harm
19      to others.
20           It is only evidence that actually shows
21      that it harmed the plaintiff.  But what is that
22      evidence?  Their experts have already agreed,
23      nothing the tobacco companies said was relied
24      upon by Mr. Marotta, either before 1982 or
25      after. 2729
1           Their experts already said you can't make
2      a safe cigarette, and admitted that R.J.
3      Reynolds tried to.  He said they spent up to a
4      billion dollars to try to make a cigarette that
5      wouldn't burn tobacco.  He said they worked
6      with the National Cancer Institute to try to
7      make safer cigarettes.
8           Would a company that was trying to kill
9      its customers intentionally do that?  Would
10      they bet the company on a safe cigarette?
11      Would they go to the labs and work with the
12      government to redesign?
13           That's the instruction that says the
14      findings aren't relevant to punitives.
15           Now, the purpose of punitives, and you'll
16      see in the instruction, one of the purposes is
17      to deter future misconduct.  You have to
18      decide:  Is there something Reynolds does in
19      the future, that if we award a whole boatload
20      of money on top of the 27 million that they're
21      asking for, that will change the world, change
22      the way R.J. Reynolds will act?
23           Consider this.  It's a different world
24      now.  R.J. Reynolds agrees that smoking causes
25      cancer, agrees that it's addictive.  Nobody 2730
1      disputes that.
2           There aren't any more statements.  CTI,
3      TIRC, TI, they didn't show you anything.  Died
4      off in the '90s.  No one is making those
5      statements.  It's a different world.
6           We've got a warning right on the pack that
7      says lung cancer.  The advertising is
8      restricted.  You know, this kind of agreement
9      to talk about causation or addiction, using
10      these words, it wouldn't even be possible
11      today.
12           All of the companies have agreed that
13      smoking causes these diseases.  And, most
14      importantly, why there is no need to award
15      punitives to deter is -- the tobacco industry
16      is regulated like a utility.  They're regulated
17      like the electric company, and they're
18      regulated by the FDA.
19           "The Food & Drug Administration now has
20      the authority to regulate the manufacturing,
21      marketing and distribution."
22           I got to ask you a simple question.  What
23      else is there?  The FDA controls the
24      manufacturing, how the product is manufactured.
25      The FDA controls marketing.  That means 2731
1      advertising, what you tell consumers.
2           The FDA controls the distribution, how the
3      cigarettes are distributed.  From the beginning
4      of the process, when they make it, to the very
5      end of the process when it hits the store, the
6      FDA has authority.
7           It's a different world.  The government
8      controls the actions, and no amount of money,
9      whether they ask for another 50 million in
10      punitives or whether they just want their
11      9 million each, no amount of money is going to
12      change that.
13           The government is in control of the
14      tobacco companies right now.  Look what it says
15      in the most recent Surgeon General's report.
16      The FDA could also establish product standards
17      for nicotine yields.
18           In other words, the government now
19      actually has the legal authority to say how
20      much nicotine is in the smoke.  That's what
21      they call nicotine yield.
22           Now, no amount of money paid to
23      Mr. Marotta's children can equal the regulation
24      and the control and the safety measures that
25      are already in effect.  The government controls 2732
1      what's in the cigarette.
2           They say, if we look again, "the FDA could
3      also reduce or eliminate other constituents."
4      And I asked Dr. Proctor about this.  You know,
5      the FDA is in charge of all the ingredients
6      now.  They can make any ruling they want.  They
7      can say, hey, if you get vanilla as a flavor,
8      you take it out.  If you got that licorice that
9      he was talking about that makes some cigarettes
10      taste better, you can take it out.
11           He agreed.  They have absolute authority
12      over that.  They can take it out if they make a
13      finding that it's dangerous.
14           And then I asked him, you know what,
15      they've never done it.  And he agreed.
16           The government is in control of the
17      ingredients in cigarettes now.  All that stuff
18      that you heard about that was so bad, and the
19      government hasn't said, change the way you make
20      your cigarettes at all.
21           There's no evidence that the FDA has said
22      take anything out, don't use an additive, but
23      they could if they would.  And they're now
24      regulating the tobacco companies like they
25      would the electric company. 2733
1           Not just reduce, but also eliminate.  They
2      can say take anything out they want to.
3           THE COURT:  Nine minutes, Mr. Belasic.
4           MR. BELASIC:  Now, you heard about this
5      conspiracy, and it seems, at this point, and
6      I'll go over it, but it's a little silly to
7      claim that, at a meeting in a hotel before
8      Mr. Marotta ever started smoking, somehow
9      influenced him, when we know, from their own
10      experts, that Mr. Marotta didn't rely on
11      anything.  Dr. DiFranza and Dr. Proctor told
12      you that.
13           And we know, from the family members, that
14      he didn't rely on anything.
15           I asked Dr. Proctor, I said, you got any
16      proof that this Frank Statement actually
17      tricked smokers?  Has there ever been a survey?
18      He said, well, no.
19           I said, well, what about the one that Hill
20      & Knowlton did?  What about the one that the
21      people that put out the Frank Statement did?
22      He said, he did know that.
23           And what they found was that the Frank
24      Statement scared people into cutting down, and,
25      in some cases, stopping their use of tobacco 2734
1      entirely.
2           And they put it up on the board, and
3      they'll say it's horrible.  They want to get
4      you mad.  Mr. Marotta never read it, and their
5      expert agrees the evidence is that it scared
6      people.
7           He also admitted that the Surgeon General
8      found that way back when there was some health
9      claims, and he said the health claims stopped
10      in the mid '50s, and I thought that was
11      interesting when Dr. Proctor said these health
12      claims stopped in the mid '50s, because that
13      was before Mr. Marotta even started smoking.
14           When he was showing you the more doctors
15      smoke Camels, he said those were advertisements
16      from the '30s and '40s.  And I asked him, but
17      you knew, coming in, that those ads were for a
18      brand that he didn't smoke, those ads were
19      before he started smoking.
20           And I asked him, you knew, when you came
21      in, that those ads were before he was even
22      born.  And he just said, yeah, I knew that, but
23      it's just to show some general things.
24           Then we find out that it's the lawyers
25      that picked those ads, not Dr. Proctor. 2735
1           If you're going to claim that this massive
2      conspiracy changed the landscape of America,
3      you have a legal burden to prove that somebody
4      relied on it, in this case, Mr. Marotta.  We
5      know he didn't.  Their experts admit it.  The
6      family members admit it.
7           But look what the public thought.  Did
8      anyone in the public rely?
9           Only 3 percent -- this is the year he
10      started smoking, 1959.  They did a Roper
11      survey, one of the largest survey groups in the
12      country.
13           Only 3 percent of the people said they'd
14      be most apt to believe the Tobacco Industry
15      Council.  The public wasn't looking for the
16      tobacco companies to tell them whether it was
17      safe to smoke or not.
18           What they were believing was the American
19      Cancer Society, the American Medical
20      Association, the U.S. Department of Health.
21           You bring a fraud case -- and the
22      instructions Judge Tuter will give you -- you
23      have to prove that it has some affect.
24           Their own expert says it didn't.  Their
25      own expert says they didn't believe it. 2736
1           Here is the 1970 Roper study.  Would you
2      believe the tobacco companies?  3 percent.
3      Now, we know that Mr. Marotta isn't even in
4      that 3 percent.
5           But how effective, how horrible is a
6      conspiracy when the amount of sales, the number
7      of people who smoke plummeted.  Remember the
8      chart?  Dr. Proctor put up the chart.
9           It starts way up here.  He says, then the
10      conspiracy begins.  And what happens?  More
11      people smoke?  No.  It drops down to, he said,
12      the lowest level since the 1930s.
13           So during this whole conspiracy, they talk
14      about, right now in America, we have a lower
15      percentage of people smoking than at any time
16      since the 1930s, 80 years ago, almost a century
17      ago.
18           One of the reasons is, as Dr. Proctor
19      admitted, nobody was listening to the tobacco
20      companies.  And the Surgeon General said that
21      when they made health claims, all it did was
22      scare people more.
23           Now, are cigarettes more addictive?  They
24      didn't put any proof.  They put a Surgeon
25      General's report in that said that it had the 2737
1      potential to.  Let's look at the real evidence
2      about smokers.
3           In summary, there's little evidence to
4      suggest that there's an increasing level of
5      addiction.  Now, should we be worried that
6      people today are more addicted, that the
7      cigarettes are somehow different?
8           National Cancer Institute says, no,
9      there's little evidence the new generation of
10      young smokers is more heavily addicted or even
11      less likely to quit.
12           In fact, look what they say below.  "The
13      higher percentage of occasional smokers is a
14      change consistent with less, rather than more
15      addiction."
16           So you go to real life and see how people
17      are smoking today, and the government, not a
18      tobacco company, says cigarettes are less
19      addictive today.
20           I covered this.  Dr. Proctor didn't say
21      there was some defect that you could have
22      removed or that you were negligent in not
23      changing the cigarette, and he specifically
24      said that he wasn't going to claim that
25      anything in Winstons or the brands that 2738
1      Mr. Marotta smoked caused his injury.
2           So what we do know is that when the
3      Surgeon General would look at things like
4      filters, he would actually look at the death
5      rates.  They would actually look at the
6      mortality tables, that the government said,
7      here's how many people smoked, here's the
8      nonsmokers.
9           They would look and they would see, are
10      the people who are smoking filters, are they
11      dying at a higher rate or a lower rate?
12           So this wasn't some speculation.  This was
13      the government is actually looking at, the
14      number of deaths.  And the government
15      repeatedly said that, when they did that, the
16      people who smoked filters had a lower rate of
17      lung cancer.
18           Today's filters produce lower rates of
19      lung cancer.  1989, studies show smoking
20      filtered, lower tar cigarettes, reduces the
21      risk of lung cancer.
22           1990, a lower risk of lung cancer for
23      smokers of filtered cigarettes.
24           So what they do is they show some papers
25      from some ad guys who say, hey, let's talk 2739
1      about filtration.  Filtration is a good way to
2      sell the cigarettes.  But do they actually tell
3      you what the Surgeon General was out there
4      measuring?
5           And when they say, well, slapping a filter
6      on a cigarette is bad.  Look what Dr. Proctor
7      said.  I said, really, is anyone in the country
8      saying you should rip the filter off?  That's
9      the best way to smoke.  Did the Surgeon General
10      say take the filter off?
11           This is what the Surgeon General was
12      saying:  How is this reprehensible, discussing
13      the kind of behavior that Mr. Alvarez, he
14      couldn't believe, how is this the kind of
15      behavior that entitles the Marottas to get even
16      more money than the $27 million?
17           The Surgeon General looked at the real
18      people who smoke and, at least at the time,
19      they were saying that, when you looked at it,
20      the people that smoked filters died at a lower
21      rate.
22           So why was it reprehensible to sell a
23      cigarette with a filter?  They don't say.  And,
24      of course, there's no evidence in this case
25      that Mr. Marotta was saying should I smoke a 2740
1      filter or an unfiltered.  There is no evidence
2      that he chose Winstons for any ad and, in fact,
3      Dr. Proctor admitted the Winston filter, about
4      taste, "Winston tastes good like a cigarette
5      should."
6           It didn't say "Winston's filter makes it
7      safe like a filter should."  They talked about
8      taste.
9           But it doesn't matter because their own
10      experts agree that advertising had no effect on
11      Mr. Marotta.
12           Dr. Proctor admitted that Reynolds'
13      president in 1968, managed his employees, to
14      push the work concerning tobacco and health in
15      cooperation with others and prepare a plan to
16      foster a good relationship with the government.
17           Look what he says.  Does he say, if there
18      is a safer cigarette, let's deep six it and try
19      to kill our customers?  No.
20           He's directing them, if there is a safer
21      cigarette, let's continue and increase our
22      efforts in this program.  Please prepare a plan
23      to carry it out.
24           Is that a company trying to kill its
25      customers?  And their own evidence showed that 2741
1      the companies knew, if they actually could make
2      a cigarette, they could still burn tobacco and
3      be safer.  They had a profit motive to do it.
4           Dr. Proctor admitted they actually worked
5      with the government for about ten years to
6      redesign their cigarettes.
7           Could I ask what my remaining time is?
8           THE COURT:  About three or four minutes.
9           MR. BELASIC:  Okay.
10           There was no dispute on this.  I mean, I
11      asked Dr. Proctor, isn't it unusual that a
12      private company that makes a legal product
13      would be called up by the government and they
14      say we want to change the way you make your
15      profit.  There was no law.  The government had
16      no legal authority.
17           The tobacco companies had a legal right to
18      say, no, we don't care, we're going to make
19      whatever we want.  But they didn't do that.
20           Dr. Proctor agreed, they spent millions of
21      dollars on this program.  They went to the
22      government and they worked hand in hand with
23      the government scientists.
24           I was wrong.  I asked Dr. Proctor if it
25      lasted five years.  He said it was longer.  You 2742
1      can see from the evidence here, it went from
2      1968 to 1977.
3           Everyone, the largest tobacco companies
4      worked with the National Cancer Institute.
5           R.J. Reynolds sent the head of R&D to work
6      on it.  For ten years, they researched, they
7      made every different kind of cigarette -- and
8      remember what Dr. Proctor said.  They looked at
9      cigarettes where they could try to reduce
10      nicotine to see if that was safer.
11           Sometimes people would smoke more and it
12      would be less safe.  They looked at cigarettes
13      that would increase nicotine.  Remember
14      Dr. Proctor said there was a theory that people
15      smoke for nicotine, give them nicotine but not
16      tar.
17           They looked at all kinds of different
18      ingredients.  They looked at different
19      chemicals that maybe could change the way smoke
20      reacts.
21           And Dr. Proctor agreed they did all of
22      those things.  They did that voluntarily with
23      the government.
24           Now, is that the way that a company, is
25      that the way that an industry that wants to 2743
1      kill its customers would act?
2           For a while here in this case, you
3      probably thought it was a battle of who could
4      put up the most magazines and newspaper
5      articles.  And Dr. Proctor admitted that there
6      were thousands of reports in magazines and
7      newspapers that said about the risks of
8      smoking.
9           Was it really secret?  No, it was on the
10      front page.  It was in every magazine.  That's
11      the newspaper where Mr. Marotta lived.
12           Dr. Benowitz said we've known that
13      nicotine has an effect on the body for a
14      hundred years.  For a hundred years, we've
15      known it could be difficult to quit.
16           They were warning about addiction a
17      century ago in this very state, the Florida
18      Department of Health.
19           90 percent of the people, before
20      Mr. Marotta even picked up a cigarette, had
21      heard that smoking could be a cause of cancer.
22           The Surgeon General said that the public
23      had been informed by this mass media coverage.
24      The Harvard study says the very year, this is
25      the year that Mr. Marotta supposedly picked up 2744
1      his first cigarette.
2           95 percent of the high school students had
3      heard, but even down here, the junior high
4      student, 90 percent of them had heard and
5      they're saying it was a secret.
6           When the Surgeon General's report came
7      out, there was massive, massive coverage.  All
8      of these are in evidence, if you want to look
9      at it, massive coverage.
10           The Florida Department of Health said
11      nearly everyone, nearly all Floridians heard
12      about the Surgeon General's report.
13           Mr. Marotta was in high school when that
14      came out.  Now, am I making this up?  How can
15      we say that he knew about it in high school?
16      Well, his best friend said that they were using
17      cancer sticks back then and that Mr. Marotta
18      would have been well aware as far back, he
19      said, as elementary school.  That's
20      Mr. Gelfano.  As far back as potentially
21      elementary school they were doing it.
22           But we knew in high school that the cancer
23      scare was known to -- that's Mr. Marotta.  This
24      is his high school yearbook.  It references the
25      cancer scare.  You can look at his yearbook. 2745
1      It's in evidence.  You can look at the pictures
2      of the prom and the people on the basketball
3      team.
4           But it has this page where they make it
5      clear that the cancer scare was being noticed.
6           And here is the priest in his school where
7      you heard the testimony, smoking was
8      prohibited.
9           Dr. Proctor admitted in poll after poll,
10      that huge majorities of people thought that
11      smoking cigarettes was harmful to their health.
12           But in the end, it doesn't come down to a
13      survey and it doesn't come down to statistics.
14      In the end, R.J. Reynolds made a legal product
15      that's legal even if it causes cancer, that's
16      legal even if it's addictive, that the judge
17      tells you cannot impose liability merely for
18      its sale.
19           And in the end, Mr. Marotta chose to smoke
20      it.  Like millions of people, he made that
21      choice.  You've seen he made a different choice
22      when it came to the efforts to quit.  That his
23      wife, that his loved ones, that his partners
24      say it was a couple of times a year.  His
25      partners say it wasn't even once a year. 2746
1           None of the evidence permits you to second
2      guess his decisions.  You have to evaluate it
3      based on the evidence that you've heard from
4      the people here.
5           Everyone agrees, including their two
6      experts that nothing that R.J. Reynolds said
7      caused him to die.  No one claims that if R.J.
8      Reynolds had said something differently, he
9      would have quit like that and avoided his
10      cancer.
11           And the plaintiff told you from the very
12      beginning in this case, and we know it because
13      it's what the Surgeon General and the top
14      expert in the world says, everyone could quit
15      smoking.  That's Alex Alvarez in opening saying
16      everyone can quit, so we take responsibility.
17      That's the Surgeon General saying that smokers
18      are responsible.  That's the man that put all
19      the science together, Dr. Benowitz, who we had
20      to call to the stand saying that smokers are
21      responsible.
22           It's been a long case.  As I told you,
23      much of the reason for it being long is that
24      the evidence didn't have anything to do with
25      Mr. Marotta. 2747
1           I thank you for attention for every one of
2      those eight days and you should answer "no" to
3      the last final question.
4           Thank you, again, for everything you've
5      done.
