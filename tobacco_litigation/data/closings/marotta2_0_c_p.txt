14           MR. FREIDIN:  Good morning.  On behalf of
15      the Marotta family, and certainly our team and
16      everybody, and all the lawyers on both sides,
17      thank you for being here, for your sacrifice.
18      It's not that often that any of us get a chance
19      to participate in the American system of
20      democracy.
21           We do go vote.  When we vote for president
22      or whatever it is, we are one of millions of
23      votes, and today you sit as part of the
24      function of this democracy, and I can't -- I
25      think, at this point, you recognize the

1      importance of this case and the significance of
2      it.
3           This is a case where, ironically, in the
4      last or second to last witness that R.J.
5      Reynolds put on, Dr. Benowitz, it kind of
6      explains to you or demonstrates what we're
7      dealing with here.
8           The witness they put on mentioned that
9      between 400 and 450,000 people die from
10      cigarette smoking lung cancer cases and
11      cigarette smoking per year.
12           That's not to mention the untold misery
13      and illness and costs associated with that.
14      That came from a witness they put on.
15           There's no dispute about that number, but
16      that just tells you what we're dealing with
17      here and how important this is.
18           Now, there's plenty of room for emotions
19      ranging from sympathy to anger to passion.  I'm
20      going to try to avoid all of that.
21           It's really not something that we want to
22      do.  We could, but what we want to do is try to
23      talk to you about the law and the evidence and
24      common sense.  That's what really counts, and
25      there's a lot, as they say, that people can get

1      worked up over, but your job is to deal with
2      the law and the evidence and common sense, and
3      that's what I want to address.
4           The first thing that you're going to be
5      asked is whether or not -- you're going to have
6      two questions, and I'll talk about them in some
7      detail, and what I'm going to do is just talk
8      about the first two questions, and Mr. Alvarez
9      is going to talk about the next nine, so I'm
10      going to be shorter than him.
11           But those two questions really relate to
12      class membership, as you've heard.  And class
13      membership is basically whether or not the
14      Marottas are entitled to be in the class and
15      whether or not the key in the door opens and
16      they can step in here and have their case heard
17      on the merits.  That's what it's about.
18           Of course, Reynolds' position is that the
19      key doesn't fit and they should not have their
20      case heard on the merits.  It should be stopped
21      right here in the first two questions on class
22      membership.
23           When you think about the class membership
24      issues, roughly, there are two questions.  One
25      is whether or not this is a smoking-related

1      illness and whether or not Mr. Marotta was
2      addicted to smoking.  We know nicotine is in
3      there and we know that nicotine is addictive,
4      and we know lung cancer comes from cigarettes.
5      If those two things are true, they're class
6      members.
7           I think class membership probably should
8      be denied to somebody who hardly ever smoked
9      perhaps.  Should be denied to somebody who has
10      a disease that is not -- I learned a Latin term
11      in this case, sine qua non; meaning the
12      defining or most important tobacco-related or
13      cigarette smoking disease known throughout the
14      world, lung cancer.
15           And so we're dealing with a heavy smoker
16      for a lifetime who gets lung cancer, and the
17      question for you first is:  Does this family
18      belong in the class?  Are they allowed to come
19      into the courtroom and have this case heard on
20      the merits?
21           And that's what I believe the evidence
22      will show quite, quite powerfully, quite
23      simply, and that's what I want to talk to you
24      about in my time.
25           Really, what I want to also start to say,

1      the Marottas have a right to be here.  That
2      really means that they're a member of the
3      class, and I'm going to talk about that.
4           I think we have one that says, what this
5      is not about.  Class membership is not about
6      fault, because fault comes in the later
7      questions.
8           That was a lot that the judge read to you
9      and -- but you can see that the fault questions
10      and the comparative fault and whether somebody
11      should have or -- should have done this or
12      should have not done that is later.
13           So class membership is not about fault.
14      It's also not about choice, which you'll hear I
15      think R.J. Reynolds will say, oh, it's all
16      about choice, but it's not.
17           You will hear from the court or you've
18      heard some of the instructions -- I don't think
19      you've heard the word "choice" in any of the
20      instructions that he gave you.
21           And in particular -- you can talk about
22      choice when you get to the other questions.
23      But in this part, this is a very simple
24      clinical distillation of whether or not the
25      Marottas belong in the class and whether

1      they're entitled to their day in court.
2           Everybody in America is entitled to their
3      day in court.  R.J. Reynolds is entitled to be
4      here and say that he's not -- they're not
5      members of the class.
6           However skimpy I think or anyone might
7      think or whatever, everybody is entitled to be
8      in court.  So let's see if the keys fit and
9      let's see what the evidence was.
10           You had arguments -- we know he died from
11      lung cancer.  There is no dispute about that.
12      But somehow or other, certain things crept into
13      this case.
14           You heard about asbestosis, and I think a
15      reasonable person might think, well, I'm sure
16      when the Reynolds' case comes up, we're going
17      to hear more about asbestosis and asbestos, but
18      really there was nothing.  Dr. Shmookler even
19      testified, no, I didn't see any asbestos on the
20      slides.
21           You heard about family history.  And when
22      you break it down, the only family history is
23      that his parents had lung cancer and they were
24      smokers.
25           So maybe that set the table for this in

1      some way or another, but it's really not
2      relevant.
3           He was an otherwise healthy man.  There is
4      no other disease process here.  He was 46 and
5      he got lung cancer.
6           But the medical records -- and I'm sure
7      you know you would have heard if he had some
8      other underlying disease process, he had
9      nothing.  Until this was discovered, he was in
10      good health.
11           Now, you hear that -- you will hear,
12      perhaps, it's about a choice, but again, as I
13      said, that comes later.
14           But the main defense on number one is,
15      this is BAC.  So let's look at, first of all --
16      when I say choice is not involved, that says --
17      that talks about legal cause.
18           You can read that over a hundred times.
19      You're not going to see the word "choice" in
20      there.  Mr. Alvarez is going to address that
21      part of this in a little more detail than I am.
22           But I'll just say, there is nothing about
23      choice, and I'm going to come back to that when
24      I get to the addiction question.
25           But it says, "Addiction is the legal cause

1      if it directly and in natural continuous
2      sequence produces or contributes substantially
3      to producing the loss, injury, or damage," and
4      there's nothing about someone's choice.
5           So let's go to the next.  This is the law.
6      You heard it a few times from the judge.  We
7      have to prove our case or our part of our case
8      by the greater weight of the evidence, and
9      that's liking to a seesaw or scales of justice,
10      if you can show that, please.
11           We have to prove 51 percent.  You've heard
12      a few times, I think, that we don't have to
13      prove our case beyond a reasonable doubt.
14      That's the criminal thing.  We hear it on the
15      CSI shows and all that.  That's not what a
16      civil case is.
17           It will change in some of the later
18      questions, but I'm not talking about those
19      right now.  Those scales have to tip one way or
20      another.  If they tip even the slightest way in
21      our direction, then we prevail on greater
22      weight of the evidence.
23           The judge will tell you it means the more
24      persuasive and convincing force and effect of
25      the evidence when weighed against the other

1      side's evidence.
2           It means also, and you heard the
3      expression used in the courtroom several times
4      with some of the witnesses, "more likely than
5      not."
6           You can say 51 percent is more likely than
7      not.  But, really, it's basically just a
8      feeling that you have, which is a little
9      stronger.
10           I'm going to go through what I think is
11      the evidence that you've seen and talk about
12      how these scales should be balanced.
13           Let's start with that question.  That's
14      really the question that you're going to be
15      answering, number one:  Was Phil's cancer
16      caused by smoking cigarettes?
17           Let's go to the first thing.  Going in.
18      And these are the things that happened right in
19      front of you.  I didn't pull that big thing
20      over here because it always gets in my way.
21           But this is what I wrote down when I asked
22      Dr. Fleiter about, what are the odds going in
23      statistically of which is more likely, and I
24      thought it was clever to bring out the pennies,
25      I don't know.  There were only two pennies.

1           And really, I couldn't cut one in half, so
2      there's one-and-a-half pennies out of a
3      hundred.  That's the odds that they're telling
4      you favor them.
5           Just on this alone, on these numbers
6      alone, this is way, way, way more than likely,
7      way more than 51 percent.  If no one testified,
8      this would be the odds, 90 percent are smoking
9      related and 1.5 percent are BAC.  Those are
10      overwhelming odds that it's not BAC.  So let's
11      put that on the scale.
12           Now, there's somebody who testified in
13      this case that you didn't meet.  His record is
14      in evidence, Dr. Goscin.
15           Dr. Goscin, you may not remember him
16      because he wasn't here, but he wrote a report,
17      a pathology report when he was taking care
18      of -- looking at these slides and advising the
19      doctors for Phil Marotta when he came in with a
20      terrible disease.
21           And he wrote down that it was, in essence,
22      the kind of cells that are smoking diseases.
23      There is no dispute about that.
24           At that time, he was advising the doctors
25      and he was advising the family and he was

1      advising Phil, who had a fatal disease, what he
2      had, and he wrote down large cell, which is not
3      BAC.
4           That's probably, of all the things I can
5      tell you, if we just used that alone and put in
6      no evidence of experts, hired nobody to come
7      in, that alone would be the most compelling
8      single fact, because he had no ax to grind, he
9      had no interest in any of this, has no idea
10      this is occurring.
11           He wrote it in the context of doing the
12      best medical care for this family and for this
13      man and for the doctors who sent him the
14      slides, and that alone.  But it gets stronger
15      and stronger.
16           So we felt we should bring in a treating
17      doctor, an oncologist.  We brought in
18      Dr. Villa.
19           Dr. Villa, if you recall, was Harvard
20      medical and had six Board-certifications,
21      including oncology and pathology.  He actually
22      not only looks at slides but he treats patients
23      with lung cancer, and he said, I'm 100 percent
24      sure this is smoking related.
25           And I have this which was in his

1      handwriting.  I said, would you step down,
2      please, and write the reasons why you believe
3      this is smoking related.  And this is his
4      handwriting.  I don't have handwriting like
5      this.  You've seen what mine looks like.
6           First, the overwhelming smoking history.
7      I think the next thing it says is a superior
8      vena cava syndrome, which is how, classically,
9      smoking tumors present and BAC does not.
10           He also said -- and then he also said the
11      presentation, radiation therapy, the way it
12      reacted to radiation therapy, the way it
13      reacted to chemotherapy, the fact that he was
14      gone in six to eight months, very atypical for
15      BAC, because the prognosis is much longer.
16           I want to talk about that in a second when
17      we get to that article I was trying to ask
18      Dr. Shmookler about.
19           And metastasis to the brain, BAC does not
20      typically metastasize, and to the bones.
21           So this is Dr. Villa.  Now, you can say,
22      okay, what did the oncologist, clinician for
23      Reynolds say?  I'm trying to remember.
24           Well, I think it's because nobody came in.
25      You wonder why wouldn't they bring in somebody

1      to contest that?
2           MR. BELASIC:  Objection, Your Honor.
3           THE COURT:  Overruled.
4           MR. FREIDIN:  He couldn't find anybody, if
5      they could.
6           So you're being asked to decide this -- we
7      bring in a very highly qualified, Harvard
8      educated, six boarded very, very strong
9      witness, who also said he read the slides and
10      he said they were smoking related.
11           Then we go to Dr. Fleiter.  Dr. Fleiter
12      also said, I'm a hundred percent sure -- now,
13      everybody remembers Dr. Fleiter, because he
14      liked to talk about the animals, this is a
15      giraffe, this is an elephant, this cell is
16      this, and apples.
17           Dr. Fleiter is one of the most renown lung
18      pathologists in the world.  He received slides
19      from all over the world.  He writes and edits
20      and reviews journals from the best journals in
21      the world and is considered one of the world's
22      leading experts at one of the leading
23      institutions in lung pathology in which they
24      teach, Professor Fleiter.
25           He said, I'm 100 percent sure there is no

1      BAC here, none.  Same thing that Dr. Villa
2      said.  Same thing that Dr. Goscin essentially
3      said.  And we start with 90 percent versus
4      1.5 percent.
5           Let's put some of that -- I left out
6      probably the most important thing, which is the
7      common sense of this.  The smoking history is
8      overwhelming.
9           This is somebody who started at 12 years
10      old and smoked until he was 47, 35 years of
11      smoking, one, one-and-a-half, two,
12      two-and-a-half, three, maybe four, who knows,
13      packs a day, nobody really counted except him.
14      And we heard that people tend to underestimate.
15      But we have two to three packs a day he tells
16      his doctors when he goes in for his final
17      assessment.
18           At this point, we know it's at least two
19      to three packs.  That's essentially an
20      overwhelming smoking history with the cancer
21      most highly associated with smoking, lung
22      cancer.
23           That's, by the way, something like 4- to
24      600,000 cigarettes in his lifetime and it's
25      something like 4 to 6 million puffs of nicotine

1      and of tar and the things that come with it.
2      Those are staggering numbers.  That's what we
3      have on this side of the scale.
4           Over here, we have Dr. Shmookler.  You
5      have to wonder a couple of things about
6      Dr. Shmookler, who has not done anything in
7      lung pathology since he was a general
8      pathologist.  He's not written.  He's not
9      taught.  He's not invited to speak.  In the
10      last 13 years, he's not done anything in his
11      field really, and the last time he saw a BAC
12      was at least five years ago.
13           And you have to ask the question why
14      Dr. Shmookler, why not find a lung pathologist.
15      It's odd.  How do they reach out to him.  It's
16      odd that -- these dates come up in terms of the
17      disclosure versus when he saw the slide.
18           So let me move to the next question
19      because I think we can answer that one yes
20      pretty easily.
21           The next question is:  Was Phil Marotta
22      addicted?  And I want to go through those,
23      please.  Let's just -- Robert, if you might,
24      let's put those up.
25           Again, the charge you're going to get is

1      whether there's a straight path between the
2      smoking and the addiction and his death, and I
3      don't think anyone could make any other
4      argument except nicotine was addictive.  He was
5      highly addicted, severely addicted, and you can
6      see the direct chain.
7           Let's go to -- and that's the Surgeon
8      General's view of it.  It's also -- you don't
9      see the word "choice" in either of those
10      diagrams.  You see a straight line between
11      nicotine addiction, the changes, and the lung
12      cancer.
13           (At this time, a video was played for the
14 court and taken down to the best of the court
15 reporter's ability:)
16           "We should also give priority to the one
17      addiction, tobacco addiction, that is killing
18      more than 300,000 Americans each year."
19           (End of video.)
20           MR. FREIDIN:  We have another slide from
21      Dr. Koop.
22           (At this time, a video was played for the
23 court and taken down to the best of the court
24 reporter's ability:)
25           "What you do say to the Tobacco Institute

1      which said in a statement today that smoking is
2      a personal choice which can be stopped if and
3      when a person decides to do so?
4           "Well, ask the 43 million people who smoke
5      in this country whether they can stop if they
6      want to, and you will find that 85 percent of
7      them say, I would like to stop tomorrow but I
8      can't.  Many of them will say, I've tried five
9      times to stop and I can't.  That is addiction."
10           (End of video.)
11           MR. FREIDIN:  There is one more.
12           (At this time, a video was played for the
13 court and taken down to the best of the court
14 reporter's ability:)
15           "I would say it's just as addictive as
16      heroin or cocaine."
17           (End of video.)
18           MR. FREIDIN:  So that's the Surgeon
19      General of the United States based upon
20      scientific evidence.  That's the backdrop of
21      this.
22           We start out with, it resembles cocaine
23      and heroin.  That's something that surprised
24      me, but that's the Surgeon General of the
25      United States.

1           And in this case, we had Dr. DiFranza --
2      and as far as I'm concerned, Dr. Benowitz, who
3      they played, who was our expect originally and
4      they decided to play his deposition, they
5      agreed on everything except one point, which
6      I'll get to in a minute, but here is what they
7      agreed on.
8           Pretty much everybody agrees that between
9      80 and 90 percent of daily smokers are
10      addicted.  Pretty much both of them agreed with
11      that.  The Surgeon General agrees that
12      85 percent are addicted.
13           Now we have Phil Marotta, who is a heavy
14      smoker, and under every single test, the
15      Fagerstrom test, the DSM test, we went through
16      all those, every single test, they both
17      agreed -- Dr. Benowitz didn't agree about
18      Mr. Marotta himself because he didn't involve
19      himself with Mr. Marotta.  Every one of those
20      criteria are the same.  There's no difference.
21           They both agree that it's highly
22      addictive.  They both agree it resembles
23      alcohol, heroin, cocaine.  They both agree that
24      this is something that is extremely powerful
25      and extremely hard to quit.

1           They both agree that a small percentage
2      can quit -- Dr. DiFranza is -- I think that's
3      the one difference, Dr. DiFranza took the
4      position that, I don't think Mr. Marotta could
5      have quit.  He didn't try anymore.  He kept
6      turning on the light switch and it didn't go
7      on, and he didn't continue to turn on the light
8      switch because he couldn't do it.  And perhaps
9      Dr. Benowitz would disagree with that, but they
10      both agree with all the other things.
11           By the way, that's the secret documents
12      from tobacco where they compare nicotine to
13      opiates.  That's not us.  That's their
14      statements.
15           So we put on Dr. DiFranza.  They put on
16      Dr. Benowitz, who basically said almost
17      everything identically to Dr. DiFranza, except
18      the one point about maybe someone can quit or
19      more people can quit.
20           But in every respect, they were identical
21      about the power of addiction from nicotine, and
22      in every single respect, they agreed that it's
23      almost or pretty much most regular and heavy
24      smokers, and they both agreed about the fact
25      that nicotine gets in the brain, especially

1      with children.
2           This was a 12-year-old boy, a boy who was
3      not in a fair fight with nicotine.  That's what
4      it was.  He got hooked on nicotine and, by 15,
5      he was already hooked, and they both agreed
6      that the brain changes permanently.
7           So what's the evidence on the other side
8      when we weigh the scales?  Dr. Benowitz went
9      through all these points.  Every single one of
10      them, number of cigarettes smoked per day.
11           Dr. Benowitz said if you smoke ten
12      cigarettes a day for ten years, you'll be
13      addicted.  Well, Phil Marotta smoked maybe 40
14      or 50 or 60 cigarettes a day for 35 years.
15           Dr. Benowitz said, if you smoke one pack a
16      day for 20 years, you'll be severity addicted.
17      Well, Phil Marotta smoked two to three packs a
18      day for 35 years.
19           He said, how soon after you wake have your
20      first cigarette?  Bam.  First thing in the
21      morning, that's the first thing he did.  If you
22      wake up in the night, bam, every night he's up
23      looking for a smoke.
24           You talk about history of failed quit
25      attempts.  They tried on lent.  They tried on

1      New Year's.  They tried any number of times,
2      probably a lot more than anyone remembered.  He
3      tried gardening.  He tried tea.  He tried yoga.
4      He tried music.  He tried long walks and,
5      finally, prayer.  And none of it worked.
6           And this was at a time when really there
7      were no medications.  That's important.  There
8      was gum.  It was controversial, Dr. DiFranza
9      told you that, during that time period.
10      Concerned about using too much gum and getting
11      addicted to the gum.
12           The bottom line is that we have, on our
13      side, Dr. Benowitz, Dr. DiFranza, and we have
14      all the criteria of the DSM; every single one
15      of them was seven out of seven.  The Fagerstrom
16      test, he scored nine out of ten.  Ten being the
17      highest.
18           One of them was not checked because they
19      couldn't possibly know whether he smoked more
20      in the morning than the afternoon, as I recall.
21      And what's -- and then let's go to the next
22      one.  These are the facts that really underpin
23      all of this.
24           The earlier you start, both Benowitz and
25      DiFranza said, the more impact on your brain,

1      the more addiction, the harder.  The more
2      cigarettes you smoke.  He smoked an enormous
3      amount of cigarettes.  The length of time, the
4      chain smoking.
5           This is 10 -- I'll get to that.  First
6      thing in the morning, middle of the night, he
7      kept extra packs in his car.
8           Remember the hiking in the mountains, you
9      heard that, and gasping for air and they light
10      up, and they realize we're addicted.  And
11      everybody agrees he was addicted.
12           Smoking sections in movies and leaving the
13      restaurants because he has to go smoke or not
14      being able to make it through the movie when
15      they didn't have smoking sections.
16           10 out of 16.  That means that, out of 16
17      waking hours, if you take 10 minutes per
18      cigarette, and you're smoking 60 a day, that's
19      10 hours a day.  What a preoccupation that is,
20      10 hours a day smoking, and their position is
21      he's not addicted.
22           After he was diagnosed with lung cancer,
23      he continued to smoke.  That's another hallmark
24      finding that Dr. Benowitz and what Dr. DiFranza
25      said shows someone is addicted.

1           Again, I said no medications and all the
2      quit attempts.
3           Everybody in the family, the DSM,
4      Dr. DiFranza, and the Fagerstrom test, and I
5      would suggest that Dr. Benowitz, with all his
6      criteria, would tell you the exact same thing
7      because every single one of the criteria he
8      mentioned are the same that Dr. DiFranza
9      mentioned.  He just didn't examine Mr. Marotta.
10           So what did R.J. Reynolds put on, what
11      evidence do they have on the other side of
12      these scales?  Is it 51 percent or is it more
13      like 90?  All we have to do is prove
14      51 percent.  They put on no evidence.
15           Am I out of time?
16           THE COURT:  Two minutes.
17           MR. FREIDIN:  Okay.  One last thing I want
18      to talk about.  It's important -- these
19      statements, I asked Dr. DiFranza about these
20      statements.  I put them up on the screen and I
21      said:  Do you agree with this?
22           "A person could be addicted to cigarettes
23      and eventually quit.  That doesn't mean he
24      wasn't addicted.  You can be addicted to a
25      substance and not try to quit."

1           Basically what that's saying is addiction
2      and the ability to quit are not mutually
3      exclusive.  In other words, whether you quit,
4      could have quit, inability to quit is not the
5      issue of addiction.
6           If it were, then all the millions of
7      former cocaine and heroin addicts have to be
8      pronounced never addicted.  They wouldn't have
9      been addicted.
10           These things are not interrelated, but the
11      defense, I think, is attempting to mix them up.
12           That's the last point I want to make,
13      which is the second question:  Was he addicted
14      and was it A legal cause -- notice the word
15      "A."  We made a big "A" and bolded it because
16      it doesn't have to be the only legal cause.
17           Now I'm going to turn it over to
18      Mr. Alvarez, and I thank you so much for your
19      attention.


20           MR. ALVAREZ:  May it please this honorable
21      court, counsel, counsel.
22           One of the things I talked to you about
23      during opening statement is that this case was
24      about choices.  One of the things that's key in
25      this case is about choices, about good choices

1      and about bad choices.
2           So let's examine some of those choices and
3      when they were made and who made them and under
4      what circumstances they were made, because what
5      we're really dealing with here are the choices
6      that were made by a 12-year-old little boy in
7      Queens, New York who was hanging out in front
8      of a candy store.
9           And how did his life change, what are the
10      two things -- how did R.J. Reynolds and the
11      tobacco industry, how did those two things, how
12      did those two forces collide and change his
13      life forever, and those of his children, how
14      did that happen?
15           And it wasn't by accident.  It was
16      purposely done, intentionally done.  The whole
17      purpose of the tobacco industry and R.J.
18      Reynolds is to get young people smoking.
19      That's what they want.  They want young people
20      to come in and start as young as possible and
21      smoke as much as they want so that they become
22      addicted.  That's their purpose.
23           Look at these documents.  "School days are
24      here and that means big tobacco business for
25      somebody.  Line up the most popular students.

1      Summer school is starting.  Get your young men
2      intensely interested in lining up these
3      students as consumers."
4           "It may be well to consider another aspect
5      of our business, that is, the factors which
6      induce a presmoker or nonsmoker to become a
7      habituated smoker."
8           That was their purpose.  That was their
9      intent.  That's what they wanted and that's
10      what they got.  This was their plan from the
11      beginning, to hook them as young as possible.
12           Here are some more industry documents.
13      This is from the FTC report of 1967.  It says,
14      "Many youngsters consider cigarette smoking to
15      be an acceptable and socially desirable
16      activity.  Because the health dangers of
17      cigarette smoking are not brought home to them
18      in an effective and meaningful way, many
19      teenagers take up the smoking habit.  Once they
20      start, they may never be able to stop."
21           How did that happen?  Did one day Phil
22      Marotta, 12-year-old little boy, just wake up
23      and say, I'm going to smoke today?
24           They created that culture.  They created
25      that world.  They wanted young people to think

1      that smoking is cool so that they could idolize
2      all the people they saw on TV, all the people
3      they saw in the movies, their favorite athlete.
4      They created that for a purpose.
5           And they spent a lot of money doing that
6      from 1940 to 2010 -- 2004, the Surgeon General
7      report says that 250 billion, not million,
8      billion dollars was spent by the tobacco
9      industry on advertising, $250 billion to
10      advertise this product and mainly to young
11      people, because they know, they know that the
12      younger you get them, you got them for life.
13      They know.
14           They created this culture through
15      advertising, TV -- Robert, why don't you play
16      some of these.
17           (At this time, a video was played for the
18 court and taken down to the best of the court
19 reporter's ability:)
20           "There are thousands of doctors, doctors
21      in all parts of the country, in every state of
22      the union, doctors in every branch of medicine
23      are asked:  What cigarette do you smoke,
24      Doctor?  Brand name most was Camel.  Yes,
25      according to the survey, more doctors smoke

1      Camels than any other cigarette.
2           "Do you inhale, then you're better off
3      smoking Philip Morris, and here is how you can
4      prove it.  Light up a Philip Morris, take a
5      puff, get a good mouthful of smoke and slowly
6      let the smoke come directly.
7           "Hang some on your Christmas tree.
8      They're easy to give, so good to get, give
9      Camels.
10           "Go with the smoking, pleasure, with Pall
11      Mall.
12           "Mickey Mantel, what do you say, Mickey?
13      It's not hard to see why most folks enjoy
14      Camels than other brands.
15           "I got a better idea.  Let's take a
16      Winston break.  That's it.  Winston is the one
17      filter cigarette that delivers flavor 20 times
18      a pack.  Winston's got that filter.  Yeah,
19      Fred.
20           "Why don't you settle back, settle back,
21      and have a smoke.
22           "Cigarette manufacturers had something to
23      do with that?
24           "Yeah, I think.
25           "Cigarette manufacturers don't make

1      movies.
2           "But what do you think, that the movie
3      maker just chose Marlboro on his own.
4           "Perhaps the movie maker was a Marlboro
5      smoker."
6           (End of video.)
7           MR. ALVAREZ:  They knew what they were
8      doing.  They knew it.  They knew that cigarette
9      smoking caused cancer and other very serious
10      diseases.  They knew that from the beginning.
11           They knew it as early mid-'50s and they
12      omitted that, they concealed that from the
13      public, and we're going to talk about some of
14      the things that they did purposely,
15      intentionally to hurt Phil Marotta.
16           Look at these documents.  This is their
17      words.  "Carcinogens are found in practically
18      every class of compounds of smoke.  Obviously
19      the amount of evidence accumulated to indict
20      cigarette smoking as a health hazard is
21      overwhelming.  The evidence challenging such an
22      indictment is scant.
23           "Cigarettes have certain unattractive side
24      effects."  They call it a side effect, a side
25      effect.  They cause lung cancer.

1           They knew.  Look at the dates, '61, '62,
2      '63.  We can show you more.  This is what they
3      did.  They created this whole body of science
4      so that scientists would come out and make it
5      seem like they were unbiased, when the whole
6      time they were in their pocket.
7           They bought and paid for these people so
8      that they could continue to sell cigarettes to
9      young people so they could get addicted for the
10      rest of their life, because they didn't care
11      whether they died or not.  They didn't care.
12           This is what they cared about.  "If this
13      committee had not been formed, the cigarette
14      industry by now would have been in a deplorable
15      position.  The TIRC has been a successful
16      defensive operation.  We must in the near
17      future provide some answers which will give
18      smokers a psychological crutch and a
19      self-rationale to continue to smoke.
20           "Obviously the key word is confusion.  Our
21      basic position in the cigarette controversy is
22      subject to the charge and may be subject to a
23      finding that we are making false and misleading
24      statements."
25           They knew it.  That's their own words.

1           "The most important type of story is that
2      that casts doubt on the cause and effect theory
3      of disease and smoking.  Doubt is our product.
4      It is the means of establishing a controversy."
5           This was a plan, a deliberate plan.
6      Before you play that -- the documents show you
7      what they know, which we didn't know, which
8      Phil didn't know, but look at what they were
9      telling the world between 1953 and 1970, and
10      this is a medley of some of those statements.
11           (At this time, a video was played for the
12 court and taken down to the best of the court
13 reporter's ability:)
14           "If it was found by somebody working under
15      the Tobacco Industry Research grant, it would
16      be made public immediately and just as broadly
17      as we could make it, and then efforts would be
18      taken to attempt to remove that substance or
19      substances.
20           "If we do find any that we consider
21      harmful, and so far we have not, we'll remove
22      these from smoke and still retain the pleasure
23      of your favorite cigarette.
24           "We want to be the detective just as much
25      as the Surgeon General, and we'll cooperate in

1      every way.  Well, obviously a filter takes out
2      certain tar and nicotine.  I don't think the
3      industry admits there are any bad elements.  If
4      there are bad elements, through the
5      laboratories, through the Surgeon General,
6      through the AMA, through acts of God and luck,
7      we hope we may find them.  And if they are
8      found, they will be removed.
9           "We do talk to the question of whether or
10      not cigarettes are hazardous.  We do not
11      believe that cigarettes are hazardous.  We
12      don't accept that.  Because when, as, and if
13      any ingredient in cigarette smoke is identified
14      as being injurious to human health, we are
15      confident that we can eliminate that
16      ingredient.
17           "Do you believe that cigarettes are safe?
18      Have they been proven to be safe, Mr. Culman?
19           "I believe they have not been proven to be
20      unsafe."
21           (End of video.)
22           MR. ALVAREZ:  Every one of those
23      statements was false and misleading, and the
24      evidence of their falsehood is in those
25      internal documents.  They knew exactly what

1      they were doing.  They purposely mislead the
2      public and Phil Marotta.  They did it on
3      purpose.
4           Here are some more documents.  "CTR and
5      the industry have publicly and frequently
6      denied what others find as truth.  Let's face
7      it, we are interested in evidence which we
8      believe denies the allegation that cigarette
9      smoking causes cancer.
10           "For nearly 20 years, the industry has
11      employed a single strategy to defend itself on
12      three major fronts; litigation, politics, and
13      public opinion.
14           "While this strategy was brilliantly
15      conceived and executed" -- by the way, that's
16      business for patting yourself on the back.
17      Look, we were smart, we got one over on these
18      people.  Look how brilliant this thing was.
19      Look how brilliant this thing was.
20           "Over the years, helping us win important
21      battles.  It is only fair to say that it is not
22      nor was it intended to be a vehicle for
23      victory."
24           They want victory.  They want to be able
25      to continue this life forever and people smoke

1      forever.
2           "On the contrary, it will always be a
3      holding strategy consisting of creating doubt
4      about the health effect, health charges without
5      actually denying it.
6           "CTR began its organization called the
7      TIRC.  It was set up as an industry shield.
8      Bill Shinn, a lawyer, feels that special
9      projects are the best way that monies are
10      spent.  On these projects, CTR has acted as a
11      front.
12           "Cigarette smoking is more addictive than
13      using heroin, hooking two-thirds of the people
14      who ever smoked."
15           Look at that.  They know.  They know that
16      two-thirds of all their customers are going to
17      get hooked and they compare it to heroin.
18           "We can't defend continued smoking as free
19      choice if the person was addicted."
20           So it's not about choice, and they know
21      that because, if you're truly addicted, it's
22      not about choice.  And their own internal
23      secret documents admit that.
24           They just don't stop.  It's a machine that
25      doesn't stop.  It's a PR machine that doesn't

1      stop.
2           When you have hundreds of millions of
3      dollars to spend on advertising, to spend on
4      getting your message across, that's a very
5      powerful machine, and that's how you shape
6      public awareness.
7           The way you shape the public is by
8      creating the atmosphere and then having people
9      doubt the health effects of smoking, and this
10      is how you do it.  Think about this.
11           If you have an addicted smoker who is
12      truly addicted and he hears two competing
13      messages.  He hears from public health
14      officials that smoking causes cancer and other
15      diseases, he hears that.  And then he hears
16      from the product manufacturer, well, there is a
17      controversy, we're not sure, it hasn't been
18      decided, there's controversy over this.  There
19      is a lot of doubt in whether it's true or not.
20           If the smoker is addicted, which one of
21      those two messages will the addicted smoker
22      accept?  And they knew that, and that's why
23      they created this whole campaign about doubt
24      and confusion.
25           They knew all they had to do is give

1      people, smokers, a crutch, a rationale, a
2      reason to doubt the health officials and then
3      nicotine would do the rest.  They knew it.
4      It's a perfect plan.  It's a perfect plan.
5      It's perfect, except for millions and millions
6      of people, like Phil Marotta, who die.
7           (At this time, a video was played for the
8 court and taken down to the best of the court
9 reporter's ability:)
10           "The cause of lung cancer is, as yet,
11      unknown.  In fact, no one knows what causes
12      lung cancer.
13           "And as far as I'm concerned, the bottom
14      line is that we simply don't know.
15           "The case is still open.  The jury has not
16      come in.
17           "It may not be harmful.  You're not
18      convinced.
19           "It may be or it may not be.  We don't
20      know.
21           "It is not known whether cigarettes cause
22      cancer.  It has not been casually established.
23           "Do cigarettes cause cancer?
24           "I don't know if they do or not.
25           "I'm not in a position to give you a does

1      or does not answer.
2           "We don't know what causes cancer in
3      general right now, so I think that we may find
4      out what causes cancer and we may find out some
5      relationship, which has yet to be proven."
6           (End of video.)
7           MR. ALVAREZ:  That's more evidence of
8      their plan, just keep it out there, keep it
9      going, keep that controversy going, just keep
10      it going because, as long as you keep it going,
11      we know the effects of nicotine will keep
12      people addicted.  And as long as that
13      controversy is out there, the addicted smoker
14      will choose us, will choose us.
15           This is from the Federal Trade Commission
16      report to Congress in '67, "Cigarette smoking
17      is, without question, the greatest single
18      public health problem this nation has ever
19      faced.  The cost to society of cigarette
20      smoking in human terms is staggering.  It is
21      the number one cause of preventable death in
22      the United States" -- the number one cause.
23           The third question that you're going to
24      get on the verdict form is dealing with
25      negligence:  Did they act like a reasonable,

1      prudent manufacturer should act?  Very simple,
2      did they act that way?
3           Well, we know by the Engle findings, if
4      you establish that he's a class member, you
5      have to accept the fact that they've already
6      been found negligent.  They've already been
7      found negligent.
8           The question is:  Was it the legal cause,
9      was it the legal cause.  But for the
10      negligence, but for the carelessness, but for
11      them hooking him when he was 12, would he have
12      smoked for 35 years two to three packs a day
13      and gotten cancer.
14           Would a prudent and reasonable corporation
15      not tell the truth?  By the way, there's 13
16      questions.  We think every single one of them
17      should be yes, every single one should be yes.
18           It's time for good choices and bad
19      choices.  So what is it that they do?  Because
20      the next question has to do with strict
21      liability, has to do with them putting a
22      defective cigarette on the market.
23           The law in this case has been established,
24      if you find he's a class member, these
25      cigarettes that Mr. Marotta smoked were

1      defective, were defective.
2           There's thousands of chemicals in smoke.
3      There's thousands of chemicals.  There's over
4      70 carcinogens, those are cancer-causing
5      agents.
6           If you're a regular smoker, 10 or
7      15 percent of them will get lung cancer, but
8      nearly half of them will die of another
9      smoking-related disease, either COPD, other
10      types of cancer, bladder, esophageal, many,
11      many other cancers.  So half of the people who
12      regularly smoke will die of a smoking-related
13      disease.
14           These are the nicotine documents.
15      "Without the chemical compound" -- this is
16      their documents.  "Without the chemical
17      compound, the cigarette market would collapse."
18           This is a Philip Morris document, "would
19      collapse and we'd all lose our jobs and our
20      consulting fees," because that's what they care
21      about.  That's the only thing -- these guys
22      only care about one thing, and it's not Phil
23      Marotta and it's not the 15-, 16-, or
24      17-year-old kid that starts smoking.  They only
25      care about one thing, and that's their profits.

1      That's all they care about.  That's all they
2      care about.
3           "However, we must never be comfortable
4      selling a product which most of our customers
5      would stop using if they could.  That is to
6      say, if the exit gates from our market would
7      suddenly open, we would be out of business
8      almost overnight."
9           So these guys get it.  These guys are not
10      stupid guys, they're scientists, PhDs, they
11      hire people, they got a lot of money.  They
12      know what to do.
13           They get it.  Listen, if we continue to
14      make this thing addictive, people are going to
15      continue to smoke.  And if we don't make it
16      addictive, guess what, people won't smoke, and
17      I'm going to be out of a job.
18           So would I rather be out of a job or am I
19      going to continue doing what I'm doing and get
20      people hooked and give false and misleading
21      information?
22           "Moreover, nicotine is addictive.  We are
23      in the business of selling nicotine, an
24      addictive drug.  For the typical smoker,
25      nicotine satisfaction is a dominant desire.

1      Therefore, in designing any cigarette product,
2      the dominant specification should be nicotine
3      delivery."
4           These guys get it.  This whole thing
5      about -- this whole thing about, well, if you
6      get a little bit of tobacco from the ground,
7      it's going to have nicotine in it.  Nicotine
8      naturally occurs in tobacco.  Yeah.
9           But they manipulate it, because you could
10      raise or lower the level of nicotine in
11      cigarettes so that you don't make it addictive.
12           "Tobacco product and deliver nicotine, a
13      potent drug with a variety of physiological
14      effects.  Our industry is based upon design,
15      manufacturer, and sale of an attractive dose
16      form of nicotine."
17           There's no dispute.  They're not selling
18      the pleasure.  That's what the market is
19      because what they really want to do is hook
20      them because they know what they're really
21      selling is a drug.
22           And this is the easiest count.  Question
23      four, which is strict liability, I told you at
24      the beginning, that's the easiest one for us to
25      prove, because all I have to prove is that he

1      smoked their product.
2           And it's undisputed, there is no evidence
3      he did not smoke an RJR product.  There's none.
4      He smoked Winstons.  They made Winstons.  There
5      is no issue, okay.  That's the easiest count,
6      the easiest one.
7           And the Engle finding is, if you except
8      that he's a class member, the defendant placed
9      cigarettes on the market that were defective
10      and unreasonably dangerous, and all I have to
11      prove is that, but for him smoking two packs a
12      day for 35 years, he wouldn't have died.
13      That's it.  So that's the easiest one to get
14      past.
15           Strict liability.  If the product is
16      defective, Engle finding says that, you have to
17      accept that.  It's the easiest one to prove.
18           Let me talk to you about apportionment and
19      fault, because this is important.  This is
20      where you get to decide choice.  This is -- not
21      in class membership.  This is where you get to
22      decide choice and fault.
23           State the percentage of responsibility for
24      Phil Marotta's death that you charge to R.J.
25      Reynolds Tobacco Company?  And then it will

1      have a percentage, and then Phil Marotta.
2           This is where you do that analysis, not in
3      class membership.  Class membership is about
4      the science, it's about the medicine, did he
5      have a smoking-related disease, was he
6      addicted, did he meet the classical definition
7      of addiction.
8           When you want to start looking at who
9      should have done what to when and where, this
10      is the question, this is the question.
11           So we accept some responsibility for his
12      smoking.  He could have quit.  He could have
13      tried harder.  Everybody could quit, okay.  But
14      let's put that in context.
15           By the way, you may have an urge to put a
16      zero there under Phil Marotta, and I'm telling
17      you, no, don't do that, because we come in here
18      and say we've admitted some responsibility so,
19      please, don't do that, don't do that.
20           Now, we're accepting responsibility for
21      the negligence claim and the strict liability
22      claim, but not for the fraud, the concealment
23      claim, and not for the conspiracy claim.
24      Because there, they lied and they concealed
25      information and they were in cahoots with other

1      tobacco companies and other organizations who
2      did the very same thing.  So these are not the
3      same.  They're not on the same footing with us
4      on negligence, okay.
5           So let's talk about that.  How do you
6      assess responsibility, because that's what
7      you're doing, who's more responsible?  Well,
8      this is the tobacco companies, R.J. Reynolds,
9      versus a 12-year-old kid.  Put that in
10      perspective.  R.J. Reynolds versus a
11      12-year-old kid.
12           And what did Dr. Benowitz, an expert, who
13      is very well credentialed, who they played in
14      their case, no problem, play him.  What did he
15      say about that?
16           He says, look, here is the thing with
17      adolescents and smoking, they at 12 as a teen,
18      you do not understand the magnitude of the
19      decision that you make to start smoking, you
20      don't understand.  You don't understand that
21      you run a risk of 45 percent that you will die
22      from that decision that you make at 12 years
23      old.
24           And when they start as teens, and he was a
25      preteen because he was 12, they think they can

1      stop.  They think they're going to be able to
2      stop.  That's what Dr. Benowitz said, and
3      that's because their brain is forming.  As an
4      adolescent, your brain starts to continue to
5      develop and form.
6           The other thing he said was, the earlier
7      you start, the more likely you are to be
8      addicted.
9           What else did he say about that?  He said
10      tobacco companies purposely, purposely
11      manipulate the levels of nicotine to keep
12      smokers addicted, and he's not the only one, by
13      the way.  Dr. Proctor, who was the historian,
14      our very first witness who came in, said two
15      things about that.
16           He said, look, they designed this
17      cigarette very carefully.  They did two things
18      to it to make it sellable and to have them keep
19      selling their product in perpetuity, which is
20      the legal word for forever.
21           What do they do?  They made it inhalable.
22      They lowered the pH so they can make it
23      inhalable.  If people just wanted to look cool
24      with a cigarette in their mouth and just put it
25      in their mouth to puff the smoke back out, they

1      could adjust the pH level so that people don't
2      inhale it.  They can do that.
3           But why wouldn't they do that?  Because
4      the only way you get the nicotine into your
5      lungs and into your bloodstream is by inhaling.
6      That's why.
7           So on balance, on balance, what's the
8      percent of negligence, how much of it is his
9      fault, is he responsible for, and how much are
10      they responsible for?
11           How much does a 12-year-old boy who
12      started smoking, who makes a decision to start
13      smoking in front of a candy store in Queens,
14      New York, really know the magnitude of that
15      decision that he makes and how it's going to
16      play for the rest of his life and for his
17      family?
18           And I think it's 90/10, R.J. Reynolds
19      should be 90 percent and Phil Marotta should be
20      10.
21           Let's talk about choices again.  You heard
22      the whole conspiracy story, how it was hatched
23      in 1953, how the heads of all the tobacco
24      companies got into a meeting at the Plaza Hotel
25      in New York City and said, look, we're not

1      going to let this stand.  What we're going to
2      do is we're going to fight this.  We're going
3      to continue to sell our product.  We don't
4      care.
5           And this document to me is the most
6      flagrant, the most -- this is a mirror into
7      their soul, this document is a mirror into
8      their soul.
9           Look what they say, "In validation of some
10      reports in the research department, we do not
11      foresee any difficulty in the event a decision
12      is reached to remove certain reports from
13      research files.
14           "Once it becomes clear that such action is
15      necessary for the successful defense of our
16      present and future suits, we will promptly
17      remove all such reports from our files.  As an
18      alternative to invalidation, we can have the
19      authors rewrite those sections of the report
20      which appear objectionable."Does this look like
21      a corporation who wants to tell the truth, who
22      cares about Phil Marotta, who cares about
23      anybody?
24           And this is a memo right after that
25      meeting.  "It's fortunate for us that

1      cigarettes are a habit they can't break.  Boy,
2      wouldn't it be wonderful if our company was the
3      first to produce a cancer-free cigarette."
4      This is December of 1953.  They went to the
5      year 2000 before they finally admit it.
6           Then they did this whole Frank Statement
7      that they -- hundreds of newspapers all around
8      the United States, 43 million people, viewers,
9      readers, got this, and they told people the
10      exact opposite.
11           "There is no proof that cigarette smoking
12      is one of the causes.  We accept an interest in
13      people's health as a basic responsibility,
14      paramount to every other consideration in our
15      business.  We believe the product we make are
16      not injurious to health."
17           But you got to understand in 1953, the
18      world was a different people.  You say that now
19      about a corporation, after a recall or
20      something, and people would go, I don't know, I
21      don't know if I'm really going to believe you
22      because we're much more aware.  But in 1953,
23      it's not the world we lived in.
24           So let's talk about this filter thing,
25      because these -- you got to give them credit.

1      These guys are sharp.  These guys are smart,
2      very, very, very smart, okay.
3           In 1950, less than 1 percent of all the
4      cigarettes sold in the United States had
5      filters, that's from the FTC report.  In 1975,
6      87 percent of all cigarettes sold in America
7      had filters on it.
8           Why?  Why?  Why did they do that?  Because
9      that fit into their whole scheme about
10      convincing people, if we put a filter on it, it
11      will take out all the bad stuff, when they knew
12      the whole time that it didn't do it.
13           Look at this.  June, 1966, "The illusion
14      of filtration is as important as the fact of
15      filtration."  The FTC -- let's go over here.
16           "In most cases, however, the smoker of a
17      filter cigarette was getting as much or more
18      nicotine and tar as he would have gotten from a
19      regular cigarette.  He had abandoned the
20      regular cigarette, however, on the ground of
21      reduced risk to health.
22           "The belief appears to be widely held that
23      filter cigarettes are less hazardous to health
24      than regular cigarettes, that many of the most
25      popular brands of filter cigarettes contain as

1      much or more tar and nicotine as many brands of
2      non-filter cigarettes."
3           And the Surgeon General report 2010, "By
4      the 21st Century, it was apparent that five
5      decades of evolving cigarette design had not
6      reduced overall disease risk among smokers, and
7      the new designs were used by the tobacco
8      industry as a tool to undermine prevention and
9      cessation efforts."
10           So that was just another tool.  What they
11      did was they said, look, we'll fight this
12      battle with controversy and doubt and then
13      we'll put filters on cigarettes and say, if
14      we're wrong about this, don't worry, the filter
15      will keep you safe, when all along they knew it
16      wasn't true.
17           And you heard from Dr. Proctor why,
18      because it doesn't filter out any of the
19      carcinogens.  In fact, it's worse for you
20      because you end up inhaling more because the
21      filter compresses the smoke and you end up
22      smoking deeper and longer, so you end up
23      getting more carcinogens in your body.
24           Is it a coincidence that the brand that
25      Mr. Marotta smoked, Phil, when he started

1      smoking in 1959, when he was 12 years old, was
2      a filtered cigarette?
3           When he made a choice in 1959 to smoke, he
4      could have chose anything, right, could have
5      chose anything, yet he chose a filtered
6      cigarette.
7           This is about addiction and it's not a
8      free choice.  1967, "There is no indication in
9      any advisement that after a person smokes
10      cigarettes regularly for a while smoking is no
11      longer a matter of choice.  For him, it becomes
12      a matter of need."  That's the FTC report.
13           This is another internal document in 1980,
14      "Cigarette smoking is more addictive than using
15      heroin, hooking two-thirds of the people who
16      ever smoked.  We can't defend continued smoking
17      as a free choice if the person is addicted.
18           "The two factors refuting the argument
19      smoking is a matter of free choice, most
20      smokers start smoking as teenagers and then
21      become addicted."
22           That's the Surgeon General.
23           THE COURT:  Ten minutes.
24           MR. ALVAREZ:  Thank you.
25           So from 1953 to 1994, these guys just

1      continued their whole propaganda machine, it
2      didn't stop.  And the evidence of Phil Marotta,
3      he continued to rely into the 1980s and '90s,
4      Phil trusted Reynolds, he trusted what he was
5      doing, he trusted, he believed.
6           In fact, he told one of his partners,
7      "don't worry about me, I'm not going to get
8      lung cancer until I'm 80."
9           Phil believed his parents died from
10      asbestos, not smoking.  You saw that from the
11      medical records.
12           He rationalized his failures.  He did
13      exactly what Dr. Benowitz -- if you listen --
14      Dr. Benowitz didn't even know anything about
15      Phil Marotta.
16           If you listen to his testimony and you
17      look at the criteria about smokers and how they
18      rationalize, it's Phil Marotta to a T.
19           He smoked filters to keep him safe.  RJR
20      concealed that, understanding about the
21      addiction, and when he started smoking as a
22      child.
23           Phil didn't know that they were
24      manipulating the nicotine levels to keep him
25      addicted.  He didn't know.  No one knew.  They

1      knew.
2           And this is what they do.  These are the
3      statements that they make.  This shows you who
4      they are.
5           (At this time, a video was played for the
6 court and taken down to the best of the court
7 reporter's ability:)
8           "Throughout your tenure with American, it
9      was not only American's position but your
10      position that cigarettes weren't injurious to
11      health; is that accurate?
12           "Through my tenure?
13           "Yes.
14           "Yes, that is so.
15           "That's something American Tobacco wanted
16      the public to believe; is that correct?
17           "Yes.
18           "It's a statement that American Tobacco
19      takes great reliance on?
20           "We issued that statement, yes.
21           "And as far as you're concerned, a person
22      is justified in relying on that statement?
23           "Yes."
24           (End of video.)
25           MR. ALVAREZ:  That's the president of

1      American Tobacco Company and that's part of the
2      RJR Company.
3           "When we say those things, we want smokers
4      to believe it," and he did.  Look at the
5      evidence, this worked on Phil.
6           Phil told -- this is 1989 to '90.  This is
7      where Phil said, look, my dad came up to me and
8      said, don't do drugs, don't drink, and don't
9      smoke, okay, because it's very, very addictive,
10      okay.
11           What he didn't tell him was, it's going to
12      cause cancer and you're going to die.  He never
13      told him that, and you know why he didn't tell
14      him that, because he didn't believe it.  He
15      didn't believe it because he was an addicted
16      smoker and he rationalized.  He did exactly
17      what they wanted him to do.
18           Phil told his daughter when she was at the
19      beach, remember the story, that she was at the
20      beach, and he went off with the sister and she
21      started smoking.  And when they got back, the
22      lady next to them on the beach said to Phil,
23      hey, your daughter was smoking.  Well, that
24      happened in 1985.
25           And these dates are important for a second

1      and I'll tell you why.
2           And he says, don't do that, it's very
3      addictive.  Once you start, you can't stop.
4      It's bad for your teeth.  It's bad for your
5      hair.  It colors your teeth.  He never once
6      said, this caused cancer, you're going to die
7      from that.
8           Marie says, 1985, that she still believed
9      the controversy.  They're both two peas in a
10      pod.  They grew up in the same neighborhood,
11      heard the same things.  They were married for a
12      long time together, and they remained friends
13      afterwards.
14           Phil told his partner, Mr. DeNunzio, about
15      the controversy.  They discussed it.  They
16      talked about it between 1984 and 1987 when they
17      lived together.
18           That is evidence that he knew and he
19      relied on the controversy.  He believed it.
20      That's evidence of it and they wanted him to
21      believe it.  They wanted him to believe it.
22           (At this time, a video was played for the
23 court and taken down to the best of the court
24 reporter's ability:)
25           "American disagrees with the warning

1      doesn't it?
2           "We certainly do.
3           "You don't think they harm smokers so
4      there is no reason to put any warning on?
5           "We believe our product is not injurious
6      to health.
7           "As far as you're concerned, is the
8      Surgeon General simply wrong in concluding that
9      cigarette smoking causes lung cancer?
10           "I would use the term "misguided."
11           "Okay, if he's misguided, then I take it
12      that your opinion is he's wrong?
13           "I was simply trying to be polite about
14      it.
15           "But not being polite about it, in your
16      opinion, he's wrong?
17           "Dead wrong.
18           "Congress is wrong in requiring these
19      warnings, correct?
20           "We do not think they're justified.
21           "So they're wrong?
22           "They're wrong."
23           (End of video.)
24           MR. ALVAREZ:  They're wrong.  As much as
25      they published these warnings, it's on the

1      pack, it's on the pack, they weren't embracing
2      those warnings, telling people don't smoke,
3      this is bad for you.  They were saying the
4      opposite.
5           THE COURT:  Two minutes.
6           MR. ALVAREZ:  I'm going to eat into my...
7           THE COURT:  That's fine.
8           MR. ALVAREZ:  The law in this case is, the
9      Engle finding is that, "they concealed and
10      omitted material information, not otherwise
11      known or available, knowing the material was
12      false and misleading, and they failed to
13      disclose a material fact concerning or proving
14      the health effects and/or addictive nature of
15      smoking cigarettes."
16           And the other Engle finding is that, "They
17      entered into an agreement to conceal and omit
18      information."
19           So these guys -- this is a finding, you
20      have to accept this in this case.  This is the
21      law of this case, if you find he is a class
22      member, okay.  And so those are whatever
23      questions those are, I think they're nine and
24      eight -- eight, nine.
25           So questions six and seven should be yes

1      and yes.  And let me tell you, this 1982 -- you
2      guys are wondering, why is this May 1982.
3           There is no evidence in this case about
4      anything that happened in May of 1982, so don't
5      look for it in the record, but it has legal
6      significance for us.
7           So what we have to prove to you is that,
8      after 1982, he relied on the controversy.  He
9      still believed in the controversy, whether
10      because he kept smoking because of the filter
11      or those statements that you heard, those
12      conversations he had with other people, his
13      family and his friends and his partners, but
14      that's there.  It's in the evidence and the
15      answer to that is yes.
16           And the same thing for the conspiracy
17      count.  Basically the same counts and the
18      answer to both of those are yes.
19           And I call this the hypocrisy of their
20      position because for 50 years they said smoking
21      doesn't cause cancer, we doubt it, there is no
22      science, there is no this, we can't believe.
23      You heard it, you heard it over and over and
24      over again from them, right?  Right, you heard
25      it.

1           But then they come in here to court and
2      what do they do.  No.  No.  Everybody knew.
3      Phil knew.  Everybody knew.  This was -- come
4      on.  Everybody knew.  Think about that for a
5      second.
6           For the first 50 years, while he's
7      smoking, buying their product, he's telling
8      them -- telling him, it's okay.  It hasn't been
9      proven, go ahead.
10           But then they come into court and they
11      say, no, no, no, he should have known.  That's
12      the hypocrisy.  They take a complete 180 degree
13      change in position so they can win a lawsuit.
14           I want to show you this video in a second,
15      but let me prefix it.  This is April 1994.
16      This is seven months before he dies.
17           (At this time, a video was played for the
18 court and taken down to the best of the court
19 reporter's ability:)
20           "Raise your right hand.  Do you swear that
21      the testimony you are about to give is the
22      truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
23      truth?
24           "I do.  I do.
25           "Please consider yourself to be under

1      oath.
2           "Let me begin my questioning in the matter
3      of whether or not nicotine is addictive.  Let
4      me ask you first, and I'd like to just go down
5      the row whether each of you believes that
6      nicotine is not addictive.  I heard virtually
7      all of you touch on it and just yes or no.
8           "Do you believe nicotine is not addictive?
9           "I believe nicotine is not addictive, yes.

12      clearly do not meet the classic definitions of
13      addiction.  There is no intoxication.

15      is short.  If you can just -- I think each of
16      you believes nicotine is not addictive.  We
17      would like to have this for the record.
18           "I don't believe that nicotine or our
19      products are addictive.
20           "I believe nicotine is not addictive.
21           "I believe that nicotine is not addictive.
22           "I believe that nicotine is not addictive.
23           "And I, too, believe that nicotine is not
24      addictive."

1           MR. ALVAREZ:  Seven months before he died,
2      they were still denying it, and they denied it
3      to the entire world, to the American people and
4      Congress.  And they lied, and they knew what
5      they were saying was a lie when they said it.
6           So the last question, by the way, is going
7      to be about punitive damages.  Are we entitled
8      to punitive damages?  This case screams for
9      punitive damages.
10           "Our basic position in the cigarette
11      controversy is subject to the charge and may be
12      subject to a finding that we are making false
13      and misleading statements to promote the sale
14      of cigarettes."
15           So the answer to that last question is
16      yes.
17           Now, here is a photograph of Phil Marotta
18      and his three kids.  To the left of it is the
19      Plaza Hotel, 1953, and to the right of that are
20      the executives going before Congress and lying.
21           What happened?  How has this affected this
22      family?  Because he's not there anymore and one
23      of the questions you're going to be asked is to
24      evaluate damages in this case.
25           And let me tell you there's three

1      separate -- there's three separate claims here.
2      There's three separate individuals; there's
3      Phil and his two sisters, Jill and Andrea, so
4      each one of them has a claim, each one of them.
5      It's not one claim, it's three claims.
6           So what does it mean to lose your parent?
7      Well, it means different things in different
8      parts of your life.  When you're a child and
9      you're growing up, right, you need a parent to
10      protect you, to raise you, to guide you, to
11      nurture you, to teach you, many, many different
12      things that you need a parent for, okay.  He
13      wasn't out of the woods.
14           Your job as a parent -- first of all, your
15      job as a parent is never done, it's never done.
16      Whether you're 17, 20, 24 when your dad dies,
17      okay, you still need your dad.  You still need
18      him for a lot of different things.
19           You may not need them to pack your lunch
20      and drive you to school.  But at 17, losing
21      your dad at 17, at 20, and 24 is too young.
22           And look how they turned out.  Look at
23      these kids, look how they turned out.  One is a
24      successful business owner, two of them are
25      nurses who decided to help people.  The number

1      one rule in nursing is to be a patient
2      advocate, number one rule, to help others, to
3      speak for the patient because they can't
4      speak -- two of them basically went into public
5      service.
6           Did that happen by accident?  All three
7      have college degrees.  Did that happen by
8      accident?
9           They were a product of a loving, caring
10      family environment of which Phil was a part of
11      and he helped nurturing his kids.  And a
12      person's sexuality has nothing to do with what
13      kind of a parent you're going to be.  It
14      doesn't.
15           So there is a certain -- I want you to
16      evaluate, when you're evaluating damages, you
17      go, okay, well, when they were 17, when they're
18      17s and teens and 20s, you know that adds a
19      certain aspect to it, but now they're older, so
20      now it doesn't matter.  Now it's less work,
21      what's the difference?  Now they're in their
22      30s and early 40s.  What's the difference?
23           Now is where it counts.  Let me tell you
24      why.  Because at the core of this case, the
25      damages in this case, it's about family.  It's

1      about family.  No one -- they each got
2      children, all of them, all the kids have kids.
3           No one can understand how much a parent
4      loves his child.  No one can understand that.
5      But think about this.  One of the things that
6      helps you love more is when you watch your
7      child go running to his grandparent and just
8      lunging himself in his arms.  Just watch their
9      eyes, both of them, the child and the
10      grandparents, when that child just squeezes his
11      grandfather.
12           That's what they miss.  That's what's
13      lacking.  That's their loss.  Not only when
14      they were 17, but they still need their father
15      today because that's what they're suffering.
16           Now, you're going to be asked, "Please
17      state the total amount of damages sustained by
18      Phil Marotta, which this is Phil, Jill, Marie
19      Marotta, Andrea Bacener for the loss of their
20      parental companionship, protection, and the
21      pain and suffering as a result of Phil
22      Marotta's lung cancer and death," and each one
23      of them has an award.
24           You can do whatever you want, as long as
25      it's reasonable in light of the evidence.  You

1      guys decide that.
2           I'm going to suggest a number.  You may
3      think it's too low.  You may think it's too
4      high.  You are the judge.  You are the judge.
5           But just think, just think, this is not
6      about losing your father at 17.  This is about
7      a family.  Think about a little pebble that you
8      throw into a pond and that ripple goes out.
9      And every time there's something with your
10      child that you want him there, it's like keep
11      throwing another pebble into that pond and that
12      ripple effect, and they're suffering every day
13      when that happens.
14           So I'm going to suggest a figure, and like
15      I said, you may think it's too low.  You may
16      think it's too high.  It's up to you whatever
17      you think is fair and reasonable.  And we think
18      $9 million for each of the children is fair and
19      reasonable in light of the evidence.
20           Thank you, Your Honor.


12           MR. ALVAREZ:  I'll be brief because I know
13      you are all tired.
14           Mr. Belasic just said that I took
15      responsibility for my client, which we did, and
16      that the Surgeon General says that smokers
17      should take responsibility.
18           But you know who hasn't taken
19      responsibility?  R.J. Reynolds.  They haven't
20      taken responsibility.  They're the only ones in
21      this courtroom that hasn't taken any
22      responsibility.  Zero responsibility for what
23      happened.  In the 50 years, they've never taken
24      responsibility.
25           He showed you this and said, look, no one 2748
1      believed us, no one believed us.  Only
2      3 percent of the people believe the tobacco
3      industry.  That's why they went and bought
4      scientists.  That's why they went and bought
5      the American Medical Association for
6      $10 million.  That's why they did that.
7           Because they knew they had a credibility
8      problem and that's why they spent their
9      millions of dollars influencing these groups of
10      people to get the message out.
11           He said, look, it's not illegal to sell
12      this product, we're allowed to do it.  But you
13      know what the instructions tell you about that?
14      You cannot -- "however, false, misleading or
15      deceitful statements and misrepresentations
16      made as part of the public debate regarding
17      smoking and health issues are not protected
18      free speech."
19           That's the problem.  The problem is that
20      they lied.  That's why they're in court today,
21      because they lied.  They were deceitful.  They
22      gave false and misleading statements about the
23      health effects of smoking.  That's why we're in
24      court today.
25           Put up the Surgeon General.  He said, 2749
1      "there is no evidence that filters were
2      dangerous."  Well, look what the Surgeon
3      General said about that.
4           "By the 21st century, it was apparent that
5      five decades of evolving cigarette design had
6      not reduced the overall risk among smokers and
7      the new designs were used by the tobacco
8      industry as a tool to undermine prevention and
9      cessation efforts."  That's the 2010 Surgeon
10      General report, and that's what they're talking
11      about.
12           They're talking about these low tar
13      filters and all these things that they claim
14      make cigarettes safer and they don't.  They're
15      just gimmicks.
16           They said that Mr. Marotta made no effort
17      to quit.  First of all, that's not true.  He
18      did make efforts.
19           But you know what, that's exactly what
20      they wanted.  They wanted smokers like
21      Mr. Marotta not to quit.  That's exactly what
22      they wanted.  But now they come in here and
23      they criticize him for his quit attempts when
24      all along they don't want him to quit.
25           He said nothing they did, nothing they did 2750
1      caused his death.
2           So this young man wakes up one morning and
3      decides he's going to smoke, for no reason, for
4      no reason.  That's what they want you to
5      believe.  For no reason.  None.
6           Ask yourself this question.  If everyone
7      knew, if it was so pervasive and everybody
8      knew, even kids in high school, if everybody
9      knew, why would they spend millions and
10      millions and millions of dollars on a campaign
11      of doubt, if everybody knew?
12           I mean, these guys were bright.  They're
13      very intelligent and they're scientists,
14      executives, very smart, they know how to make
15      money.  Why would they throw money away like
16      that?  Why would they throw millions of dollars
17      away like that if everyone knew?
18           Now, they said that there was no evidence
19      of post 1982 reliance.  We went over it.  There
20      is.  You heard it.  You heard it.  That's how
21      you get to punitive damages, by answering those
22      questions yes.
23           Now the pathologist, he made a big deal
24      about the pathologist, that he wouldn't come in
25      and testify. 2751
1           The report, Dr. Goscin's report said it's
2      large cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma.
3      90 percent of all large cell carcinoma is
4      caused by smoking.
5           They talked about the BAC, this whole
6      thing about the BAC and they showed you this
7      slide.
8           Well, BAC goes all around the air sacs.
9      This one is Mr. Marotta.  I circled all the
10      areas around the air sac where there is none.
11           He said, oh -- by the way, we don't have
12      to prove that it's BAC, we don't have to prove
13      that.
14           But if they wanted to prove that it was
15      BAC, they had the pathologist, they had the
16      slides, he looked at the slides and said you
17      can do special staining to these slides to find
18      out if there is BAC.
19           Okay, so why don't you do it?  If you want
20      to prove that it was BAC, you want to confirm
21      your diagnosis, then why didn't you stain them
22      and come into court and say, here are the
23      stained slides, that's how I know it's BAC.
24           Talked about the family history.  The
25      family history only makes the smoking more 2752
1      prominent.  The fact that they're predisposed
2      to cancer means that their body is unable to
3      fight off the toxic effects of smoking, which
4      makes smoking even more dangerous, five times
5      more dangerous.
6           They read, they didn't read it, they just
7      said Dr. Messinger, who was the radiologist
8      that we hired, couldn't rule out BAC.  Well,
9      actually, let's see what he actually said
10      because we read it.
11           "Could a BAC that has progressed and
12      spread become more aggressive present this way,
13      Doctor?"
14           "Answer:  I think it is best that a
15      pathologist tell you that.  But I mean, we
16      don't see that many BACs.  And those that I
17      have seen are generally more isolated and not
18      aggressive.  So I think probably it is best.  I
19      mean, theoretically" -- theoretically -- "I
20      would think probably the answer is true, yes,
21      but I don't know that for a fact."
22           You know anything is possible
23      theoretically, but we're not talking about
24      theoretics.  We're talking about probability,
25      the greater weight of the evidence and they 2753
1      didn't prove that.
2           The last thing I want to say, Judge, and
3      I'm wrapping up is, they showed you this slide
4      and they said that Dr. Benowitz said that,
5      within 72 hours of quitting, all the nicotine
6      is gone from the body.
7           That's true, but you know what doesn't go
8      away for months, and sometimes years, are the
9      cravings.  The craving, the desire, that never
10      goes away.
11           On behalf of Phil and the sisters, we want
12      to thank you very much and we'll accept
13      whatever verdict you render.
