5       MR. SCHLESINGER:  May it please the
6 Court, counsel, John, the McCoy clan.  Good
7 morning.
8       Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, good
9 morning.
10       JURORS:  Good morning.
11       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thank you for sitting
12 through this trial.
13       One of the things we tell jurors
14 oftentimes is that many are chosen, but few are
15 called.
16       But, in this case, it's interesting.
17 When we looked over your information, every one
18 of you volunteered.  And, so, unlike some cases
19 in which the jurors begrudgingly submit, and
20 they've got other more important things to do,
21 my recollection was everybody here said, I'm
22 willing to serve, and we -- we thank you for
23 that.  We think that's important, and we
24 appreciate it.
25       I've got a clicker here. So, at this juncture, I call this
2 judgment day, a day of reckoning, a day of
3 reckoning, in part, for what we will prove to
4 you and remind you are reprehensible acts of
5 the tobacco industry, historically, going way
6 back, way back, a company that is an enterprise
7 of death, a company that manufactured --
8 industrially manufactured terrible diseases
9 that killed millions of Americans over many,
10 many decades, even after things like the 1964
11 Surgeon General came out.
12       And I'm going to go back and remind you
13 about those things, and we'll go through it and
14 you'll see what your job is to do.
15       And your job is going to be filling out
16 the questions and answers on a verdict form
17 that's about three or four pages long, which
18 His Honor has not read, he will read at the --
19 read at the close, and I am going to try now to
20 stitch together for you some of the evidence in
21 the way we hope you see it, will you see it our
22 way, and then help you come to the conclusions
23 that you need to -- to make in your
24 deliberative capacity as a juror in the jury
25 room when we turn it over to you. And, you know, the whole idea, what's
2 neat about this American system of justice, is
3 that you all have no dog in the fight.  You
4 have no stake in the outcome.  And, so, trial
5 by jury is one of the best ways to protect the
6 rights and liberties that we hold dear in this
7 country.
8       And while the attorneys are charged with
9 zealously representing the position and the
10 claim of their clients -- that's our role as
11 advocates -- you all get to decide, okay, is
12 this the search for the truth that the
13 Miami-Dade Courthouse has on a plaque
14 emblazoned on every courtroom, "We who labor
15 here seek only truth."
16       That's going to be your job.  And we're
17 going to try to help you work through it based
18 on assembling this data in -- realistically,
19 what does it mean.
20       So let me start by saying this:  Let
21 me -- let me sum it up in a nutshell.  The
22 simple truth in this case is this is an
23 industry, all right?
24       And I said it has been in existence now
25 and conducting a conspiracy, which was determined by the Engle findings, which you'll
2 learn more about -- and I've got an enlargement
3 up there you can read -- that youth targeted as
4 replacement smokers, the dirty little secret of
5 the business, that hides in plain sight, and
6 the fact that, in real terms, in reality, this
7 is nothing but drugs.  That's all this is.
8       Smoking cigarettes is drug -- drug
9 addiction, drug dependence.  For a long time,
10 it was a secret epidemic of drug dependence,
11 because people didn't know, because the tobacco
12 industry played down the role of nicotine.
13       And we'll get into very great detail
14 there, but this is just a nicotine-delivery
15 device.  It's nothing but drugs.
16       It's hard to wrap your mind around it
17 because it looks like a completely normal
18 consumer product.  And I'll show you some
19 similar-looking packages that you can ask, do
20 these look bad?
21       If a child --
22       If a youngster is holding up a pack of
23 Camel -- Camel cigarettes, with a nice little
24 Camel on it, if a child holds this package up
25 and asks his dad -- a five-year-old, a six-year-old, a seven-year-old -- asks his dad,
2 Dad, what is this, and a dutiful parent,
3 discharging his responsibility to guide his son
4 towards the -- down the path of the true and
5 narrow, says, oh, son, that's bad, that's bad,
6 well, the son may respond, but, Dad, it doesn't
7 look bad.
8       I mean, I have toy camels in my
9 collection.  Kids collect toy Camels.  Is a toy
10 Camel bad when you buy safari animals?  Is that
11 bad?
12       Why is this Camel bad?  It's got pretty
13 blue colors.  Why is that bad?  So we'll talk
14 about that.
15       The idea is that these look like normal
16 consumer products.  You can't tell the
17 difference.  It's like that old game we used to
18 play, one of these things is not like the
19 other, one of these things just doesn't belong.
20        A pack of Pall Malls, a color scheme
21 like a Hot Wheels toy car, a color scheme like
22 a -- like a pack of cards, Jolly Ranchers.
23       In other words, it looks like a normal
24 consumer product.  It doesn't look like heroin,
25 it doesn't look like cocaine, isn't illegal, but it's an epidemic of drug addiction that
2 exists in our country because --
3       And when folks say, well, why is this
4 epidemic so difficult to eradicate?  It is
5 because there is a powerful industry that
6 depends upon its perpetuation.
7       And this is historical news going back to
8 the '50s, no doubt, but it bears examination
9 today.  It's not old news.  It's new news.
10       If it wasn't new news, we wouldn't have
11 things like the Surgeon General's report, which
12 comes out every two years, and as recently as
13 2014 -- and this is in evidence -- as recently
14 as 2014 --
15       Oh, and by the way, Dr. Prochaska is
16 referenced in this book.  It comes out as
17 recently as 2014, and it teaches us quite a bit
18 and it explains the tobacco industry's
19 extensive campaign to counteract the forces
20 through marketing and public relations,
21 political influence, and the creation of doubt
22 about the scientific evidence on tobacco is
23 know -- is now well documented through the
24 industry's internal documents.
25       The industry, itself, used its influence to thwart public health action at all levels
2 and fraudulently misled the public on many
3 issues, including whether low-yield cigarettes
4 conveyed less risk to health and whether
5 exposure to secondhand smoke harmed nonsmokers.
6 Undoubtedly, these actions slowed progress in
7 tobacco control.  So --
8       And there's more in here.  That's
9 Page 34.  I want you to be thinking about that,
10 because these are in evidence.  These stand --
11       Right now, this is current, cutting-edge
12 treatment and current cutting-edge analysis.
13 And the focus now, in 2014, 50 years later, is
14 the scientists, the public health researchers,
15 the -- the folks that are protecting us through
16 the federal government public health agencies,
17 they are diving into this amazing archive of
18 prior secret records of the tobacco industry to
19 come to important conclusions about what they
20 did to the citizenry that led to the 20 million
21 deaths even since 1964.
22       Now, that's a big number, it's hard to
23 wrap your mind around, but we'll talk about it
24 in no small detail.
25       So the simple truth is, these are the two things that are so important to understand:
2 All smoking is based on youth, and it's nothing
3 but drug addiction.  That is what smoking is.
4 And we'll go into the detail of it.
5       Now, you know, one of the things we
6 did -- and I must tell you this -- is we went
7 through this trial and we presented a lot of
8 evidence.  And part of the reason is because we
9 don't know how much you need.
10       You know, we say, when you come into this
11 courtroom, I thought I knew.  I knew something
12 about the tobacco companies.  I thought I knew.
13       But I say, now that you've learned some
14 of this and heard the lessons that Dr. Proctor
15 and Dr. Prochaska offered about what the
16 tobacco industry's motives were, and what they
17 were all about, I say, now you know.
18       And it reminds me of an Elton John
19 song -- some of you may know Elton John, or
20 not -- but the Honky Chateau album had a song
21 called Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters.  And there's
22 a line in there where he says, "I thought I
23 knew, but now I know."
24       And I think, for you jurors, hopefully,
25 if you see this our way, if we've stitched this together correctly for you, maybe you'll see
2 this our way and you'll -- you'll think, now I
3 know.
4       Hopefully, we didn't give you too much
5 evidence.  We don't know how much evidence you
6 need, but, hopefully, we didn't give you too
7 much.
8       Now, why?  Why?
9       This is why:  Because back as early as
10 the '60s, and even after the Surgeon General
11 was trying to get the message out, the Surgeon
12 General they belittled and smeared and
13 attacked, they knew cigarette smoke is a drug,
14 but there were dangerous implications to the
15 FDA finding out about that, should that secret
16 get out.
17       We've got the goods on them now.  We have
18 their internal secret industry documents that
19 were never meant to see the light of day.  And
20 we're going to talk about that.
21       The fact is, is that this report here, on
22 Page 105, in no uncertain terms establishes
23 that nicotine addiction is the fundamental
24 reason that tobacco -- that -- that smokers
25 persist in using tobacco products. Page 105.  And this persistent use
2 contributes to many diseases described in this
3 report.
4       That's the concept that addiction causes
5 disease.  Dependence -- it's an interchangeable
6 word.  Dependence causes disease.
7       And one of the things -- and I'm going to
8 go aside real quick, because I've got a great
9 outline here, but I never stay on it because
10 I'm just going to ramble, but I'll get the
11 points across -- is Dr. Agharkar, I heard him
12 the other day, was talking about never having
13 heard of the Fagerstrom.
14       Page 106, okay --
15       The Fagerstrom report is in Page 106 of
16 the nicotine section, and it's regarded as one
17 of the most prominent instruments that the
18 physicians have and use to determine the degree
19 or severity of dependence to smoking, is the
20 nicotine tolerance questionnaire.
21       And that whole questionnaire is laid out
22 here, just like the DSM has got a structured
23 questionnaire that you use to make sure you get
24 the answers right on the DSM, that
25 Dr. Prochaska explained to you we used, and Dr. Agharkar said he knew nothing about it.
2       So we're going to discuss the relative
3 weights, values and merits of the experts in
4 this case.
5       There's even a section here that says:
6 An indice of smoking reinforcement or
7 persistence are related to a high level of
8 addiction.  These indicate a longer duration of
9 smoking, young age of smoking initiation, no
10 previous attempt to stop smoking, and a shorter
11 duration of abstinence during previous attempts
12 to stop smoking.
13       119.  The definitive statement.  This
14 isn't -- this isn't one guy.  There are
15 hundreds of researchers, scientists,
16 biologists, doctors of every ilk, professors
17 from all over the country.
18       You're going to look at this document and
19 you'll see hundreds of physicians nationwide
20 contribute to this highly peer-reviewed, highly
21 vetted, very cautiously stated scientific
22 conclusion, without exaggeration.  They're very
23 cautious.
24       But on Page 119, they say:  Sometimes one
25 big indice of addiction is that you didn't stop or you had short periods of time to stop.
2       Smoking a long time without stopping is
3 an important sign of addiction, just like
4 smoking in the face of harmful consequences.
5       So we heard a lot of statements from the
6 defense, and the defense would say, somebody
7 said it was bad, to her; someone told her it
8 was bad; the family members excoriated her.
9 Mom, come on, we've got to do something about
10 this.
11       But the addict is in denial, and if
12 you're hearing countervailing messages from a
13 tobacco industry, saying, smoke filters, it's
14 not bad, we still need more study, you were
15 demotivating an addict.  It's "operation
16 stumbling block," and it worked.  And we'll go
17 through that.  It worked.  But what is the --
18 what is the --
19       This is addiction causation.  There's
20 several other places where the science says, of
21 course addiction causes disease.  Here's one.
22       And are you going to run that?
23       (The video clip was played and taken down
24 to the best of the reporter's ability as
25 follows:) VOICE:  We should also give priority to
2 the one addiction, tobacco addiction, that is
3 killing more than 300,000 Americans each year.
4       (Video clip concluded.)
5       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Tobacco addiction
6 killing more than 300,000 Americans a year in
7 1988.
8       Now, with our understanding of science
9 and all of the broad panoply of medical
10 diseases that are caused by smoking, it's
11 540,000 American deaths per year.  Two-thirds,
12 one in --
13       Two out of every three persons who smoke
14 for an excessive period of time will die of a
15 tobacco-related disease.  This is a current
16 epidemic that needs to continue to be examined
17 because it is the number one killer in the
18 United States.  One in every five deaths.
19       If you eliminated tobacco, it would be
20 the equivalent of coming up with a vaccine that
21 cured all of -- all of -- one-third of all
22 cancers --
23       MR. FURR:  Objection.
24       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- in this United
25 States. THE COURT:  What's the objection,
2 Counsel?
3       MR. FURR:  To --
4       THE COURT:  Overruled.  This is argument.
5       MR. SCHLESINGER:  And this is on Page 652
6 of the Surgeon General's report, 2010, a
7 revolutionary current exhibit, talking about if
8 the population ceased smoking, this single
9 behavior would be tantamount to a vaccine
10 against one-third of cancer deaths.
11       Can you imagine?  We're spending all of
12 this time to cure cancer, and you know what?
13 We can get one -- rid of one-third of it right
14 now, because of cigarettes.
15       And what did Dr. Proctor's book say?
16 What did Dr. Proctor's book say?
17       The title of it says:  The Golden
18 Holocaust -- a holocaust made of profitable
19 goals -- Origins of the Cigarette Catastrophe
20 and the Case for Abolition.
21       "Abolition" means freedom from
22 enslavement.
23       MR. FURR:  Objection.
24       THE COURT:  Sustained.
25       MR. SCHLESINGER:  In any event -- MR. FURR:  Move to strike the last
2 comment, Your Honor.
3       THE COURT:  Disregard the last comments,
4 ladies and gentlemen.
5       MR. SCHLESINGER:  You can use your common
6 understanding of what the word "abolition"
7 means, but the point is --
8       MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  The
9 objection was sustained.
10       THE COURT:  As to a different word, not
11 to "abolition."
12       Let's go.
13       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.  So, in any
14 event, the --
15       This is an 800-page book.  Had there been
16 anything in there worth contradicting, a
17 skillful attorney would have, from the defense,
18 from the -- Lorillard, and Mr. Furr would have
19 challenged him with something that helped his
20 case.  But not one word in this 800-page book
21 was ever referred to on cross-examination.
22       They're the words of Dr. Proctor.  This
23 book is a revelation.  It's a great
24 contribution to public health and it's very
25 helpful.  So the -- We played the video, right?
2       Let's go to the next one.
3       Anyway, it says there:  Nicotine
4 addiction goes -- leads to lung cancer.  That's
5 in the 2000 Surgeon General's report.  It's in
6 evidence.  You can see it, okay?
7       Did I put the page number up there?
8       I don't see the page number, but it's in
9 evidence.  Now, let's play that.
10       (The video clip was played and taken down
11 to the best of the reporter's ability as
12 follows:)
13       VOICE:  We want to be the detectives just
14 as much as the Surgeon General and the AMA, and
15 we'll cooperate in every way.
16       VOICE:  Well, obviously, a filter takes
17 out certain tar and nicotine.  I don't think
18 the industry admits there are any bad elements.
19 If there are bad elements, through our
20 laboratories, through the Surgeon Generals,
21 through the AMA, through acts of God and luck,
22 we hope we may find them.  And if they are
23 found, they will be removed.
24       VOICE:  We -- we do talk to the question
25 of whether or not cigarettes are hazardous.  We do not believe that cigarettes are hazardous.
2 We don't accept that, because when, as and if
3 any ingredient in cigarette smoke is identified
4 as being injurious to human health, we are
5 confident that we can eliminate that
6 ingredient.
7       VOICE:  Do you believe that cigarettes
8 are safe?  Have they been proven to be safe,
9 Mr. Cullman?
10       VOICE:  I believe they have not been
11 proven to be unsafe.
12         (Video clip concluded.)
13       MR. SCHLESINGER:  These are the chief
14 executive officers going, as Dr. Proctor said,
15 thousands and thousands of times to deny that
16 cigarettes caused harm so that they could keep
17 smokers smoking.
18       And you will see as we go through this,
19 you get a guy like Cullman, and I see that
20 Cheshire Cat grin and that smarmy demeanor, and
21 he says:  If there's any bad elements, they
22 will be removed.
23       And the fact of the matter is, is the
24 worst element is nicotine.
25       So Dr. Prochaska testified about the fact that you can't just look at the smoker.  The
2 problem is, you have to look at the cigarettes
3 flowing down the river from the manufacturers.
4 If there wasn't that flow, it would be -- that
5 would be -- there wouldn't be the problem of
6 nicotine.
7       And he talked about whether Ms. McCoy
8 quitting is a success story, and it's not.
9 But, you know, his concern is, is that there
10 are, even to this day, researchers who are
11 putting evidence into the Society for Research
12 on Nicotine and Tobacco, and confusing whether
13 or not there are permanent --
14       This is the wrong one.
15       MR. GDANSKI:  The next slide.
16       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Wait, hang on.  Let me
17 stay on this one.  I'm sorry.
18       In any event, her point here is, this is
19 a cycle.  There are smokers that come out and
20 die, there are replacement smokers that come
21 in, and she says it's a big business, one of
22 the biggest businesses in the nation.
23       In a case like today --
24       Because they've said this industry's
25 powerful for more nations.  In the jury system we have in this country, you hold great power.
2 You have the ability to speak truth to power.
3       You've heard evidence that it's a
4 powerful industry, and you get to make a
5 determination, on a level playing field -- my
6 client, Mr. McCoy, his family is here, they get
7 to stand toe to toe with the tobacco
8 companies -- and you get to make the decisions
9 as to whether you can speak truth to power; but
10 you hold power that --
11       You may hold more power in this case than
12 you've ever held in your life.  So it's an
13 important and significant opportunity for you
14 to do that.
15       And one of the arrogance of power is that
16 actions can be reprehensible.  Remember the
17 Waxman hearings and the CEOs getting up in '94,
18 when it was no longer really a debate in the
19 public that cigarettes caused cancer and that
20 they were deeply addictive?
21       It was six years after Koop had said,
22 yeah, this is as addictive as heroin and
23 cocaine.  They got up and lied before Congress.
24 That's an arrogance of power to be able to do
25 that.  It wasn't received well by the -- by the public, but it was important to see.
2       So, also, Dr. Prochaska talked about that
3 the changes in the brain are believed to be
4 permanent; and while there is some debate in
5 the field, she perceives that the tobacco
6 industry is hard at work creating ambiguity,
7 because there were tobacco industry people at
8 her conference, trying to submit information,
9 and didn't disclose the fact that they were
10 funded by tobacco.
11       And don't you remember that Dr. Proctor
12 said that was true back even in the '50s and
13 '60s, with the AMA, who they paid $20 million
14 not to appoint and support the 1964 Surgeon
15 General's report?
16       So this was a very strong campaign to
17 counteract the effects of the public health
18 authority.
19       Now, what about our client?  Because you
20 heard --
21       The last you heard was Agharkar.  We'll
22 talk about him.  I mean, he has courtroom
23 experience.  He's not on any staff of any
24 hospital to treat patients.
25       And, believe me, there are such things as psychiatric emergencies.  A real active,
2 practicing psychiatrist, with a boatload of
3 patients who are suffering from such terrible
4 things as depression, they can have suicidal
5 ideation.  If they end up needing a hospital
6 admission, a doctor who's really practicing
7 full-service psychiatry needs a hospital
8 setting to admit patients or go see them.  He
9 admitted he didn't even see them.
10       He admitted the bulk of his work was
11 getting money, testifying in court; and his
12 credential was, I'm a forensic credential
13 [sic], I'm a courtroom expert.
14       But in terms of his actual credentials,
15 telling you what's the -- what it is on tobacco
16 addiction, he had to contradict every single
17 thing out there, including the Surgeon
18 General's report, including Dr. Prochaska, who
19 teaches the addiction psychiatrists how to
20 determine addiction.
21       And, quite frankly, Dr. Prochaska, as you
22 well know, if those were the answers she heard
23 from one of her students, they probably
24 wouldn't get --
25       MR. FURR:  Objection. MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- a very good grade in
2 that class.
3       THE COURT:  Sustained.
4       MR. SCHLESINGER:  So, you know, this is
5 the Tamol document.  This shows, in no
6 uncertain times -- in no uncertain terms, as
7 early as the '60s, that the research at Philip
8 Morris was to make sure that when those light
9 cigarettes were coming in, that they would not
10 remove so much nicotine or lower the light
11 cigarettes to the point where they would lose
12 smokers, they would wean them off nicotine, and
13 they said, in no uncertain terms, we need to
14 make sure we keep the normal smoker hooked.
15 Keep that nicotine so the smoker gets hooked.
16       And Prochaska said the same thing, that
17 hook is pulling you along.  It pulls you along
18 towards addiction, it maintains addiction.
19 They said she was --
20       They said the family said, Mom, what's
21 wrong with you?  Are you blind?
22       Well, I say that's good testimony for us.
23 Yes, that's the nature of the blindness caused
24 by addiction.  The definition of "addiction" is
25 smoking despite the knowledge of harmful consequences.
2       So when you are smoking even though --
3 even when you know -- and she knew more in the
4 '80s -- that it's bad for you, and you continue
5 to smoke, that shows the power of addiction.
6 And Dr. Prochaska explained that to you when
7 she testified that to you.
8       So she's blinded by her innocence, you
9 know?  She was blinded by addiction.
10       But, to the contrary, the tobacco
11 industries eye's were wide open, and what they
12 were pursuing was greed.  They were about
13 making money and making profit, and they didn't
14 care about the health of their customers.  They
15 didn't care what happened to them.  They chose
16 profits over causing addiction, causing harm.
17 That was a profit center.
18       And so it begs the question, if a friend
19 of a friend came to a person on the street and
20 said, hey, I got this great business idea and
21 we're going to make tons of money, people are
22 going to eat this stuff up, some kind of
23 special product, no one is going to be able to
24 get enough of it and we're going to make tons
25 of money, they're going to eat it -- they're not going to be able to stop taking it, but
2 it's going to kill half or two-thirds of the
3 users, would a moral person go into that
4 business --
5       MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.
6       THE COURT:  Sustained.
7       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Would somebody go into
8 that business with a -- with -- as a good-faith
9 basis, would they take that business?
10       Well, this industry did.
11       So Prochaska talked about hooked, and the
12 fact of the matter is, I want to just -- I want
13 to share this with you.  You know, the
14 tobacco -- tobacco companies in this case want
15 to pretend that Glodine McCoy wasn't addicted,
16 all right?
17       But if you don't -- if you don't buy
18 that, they want a fallback position that if she
19 was addicted, it was her choice to continue to
20 smoke long enough to get sick; therefore, it
21 was her choice and not her addiction that
22 caused PVD, heart disease, COPD, lung cancer,
23 and death.
24       But not one piece of evidence was
25 presented by either side that Glodine's addiction was her choice.  You know why?
2 Because nobody chooses addiction.  It's often a
3 terrible side effect of the choice to smoke.
4 Just like some --
5       Just like addiction some people get from
6 prescription pain relievers.  No one chooses
7 that addiction, but it frequently happens as an
8 unintended -- unintended consequence of the use
9 of the drug.
10       The point is that lawful but dangerous
11 drugs can have awful side effects like
12 addiction.  That's why ordinary people often
13 say, about tobacco or prescription pain
14 relievers, be careful, don't get hooked.
15       Why do people say that?  Because
16 addiction is like a fish getting hooked.  The
17 fish chooses to strike the bait and then he
18 gets caught by the hidden hook.  The hook
19 starts pulling the fish along.  The fish starts
20 fighting the hook and tries to get off.
21       Fish that are only hooked through the
22 side of the lip may get away, but those that
23 are hooked deep through the side of the mouth
24 are goners.
25       Fishermen know this.  That's why they use baits and hooks in the first place.  But no
2 fisherman would ever tell you that the fish was
3 caught because the fish chose to get hooked.
4 The fish died because he didn't see the hook in
5 the first place.
6       The teenage Glodine McCoy in 1913 -- in
7 1940, at 13 or 14 years of age, didn't see the
8 hook.  She died in 1997.  The tobacco companies
9 didn't tell their customers that they thought
10 cigarettes were addictive until several years
11 after she died.  Instead --
12       And they repeated it to everybody that
13 could read.  And we know that Glo read a lot,
14 that there was a substantial scientific
15 controversy about whether cigarettes were
16 addictive and harmful, and whether cigarettes
17 could get you hooked.
18       There were no cautionary labels of any
19 kind on a pack of cigarettes until 1966.  And,
20 at that time, it was a caution.  It may be
21 harmful, or, in keeping with the doubt campaign
22 and the campaign of confusion, it may not.
23       She had been smoking for decades.  She
24 was hooked, hooked badly.  She tried to get
25 away, but she couldn't.  And being hooked eventually killed her.
2       Now, the tobacco companies want to tell
3 you, being hooked had nothing to do with the
4 death of Glodine McCoy.  And that's a real fish
5 story for you, and they know it.
6       MR. FURR:  Objection.
7       THE COURT:  Sustained.
8       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Glo --
9       MR. FURR:  Your Honor, can we approach?
10       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Oh, come on.
11       THE COURT:  Counsel, I sustained the
12 objection.  It's --
13       MR. FURR:  I need to approach.
14 at
15 sidebar:)
16       THE COURT:  Yes, sir?
17       MR. FURR:  My objection was sustained to
18 the argument that our defense was a real fish
19 story.  That's an attack upon the defense.  I
20 need to move for mistrial.
21       THE COURT:  Thank you.
22       You wish to be heard?
23       There's no manifest necessity for a
24 mistrial.  The motion is denied.
25      (Sidebar discussion was concluded, and the following was held in open court:)
2       MR. SCHLESINGER:  In any event, Glo chose
3 to smoke at a time when no one knew the real
4 dangers of addiction and the disease inherent
5 in cigarettes.
6       She started as a young teen in 1940.  The
7 advertising and movies that attracted young Glo
8 never mentioned addiction, they never mentioned
9 cancer.  She had been smoking for 25 years
10 before the cigarette packs even said cigarettes
11 might be dangerous to your health.  Twenty-five
12 years.
13       In that amount of time, this -- the hook
14 can set deep.  Glodine McCoy was pulled along
15 by that hook for about 50 years until she
16 finally got off it, after having a heart
17 attack, standing on the precipice of the abyss
18 of death.
19       She tried to fight it, she couldn't get
20 off.  Maybe some of you will think she should
21 have tried harder.  And that's fair, but that
22 is fault.  That is not class membership, that
23 is not addiction.
24       And we have to -- we have to make sure we
25 don't conflate the concepts of fault with the threshold determination as to whether or not
2 she is one of the all Floridians who suffered
3 from these diseases before 1996.
4       So, the cigarette will preempt food in
5 times of scarcity.  I told you about this in
6 opening, I proved it to you during the trial.
7 You heard the testimony of Scott McCoy.
8       And the internal marketing documents knew
9 this and anticipated it back in the '60s.  So
10 the fact is, is that's a sign of addiction.
11       When I say "sine qua non," that is
12 because Claude Teague, senior research
13 scientist, brilliant man, enjoyed a career of
14 over 30 years at the -- at the RJR company,
15 made brilliant statements, you're going to read
16 three of his key documents:  The 1950 Survey of
17 Cancer Research, Nicotine, and its Crucial Role
18 in Cigarette Smoking, and the Important
19 Thoughts of the Youth Market and Capturing the
20 Youth Market.
21       Those documents right there tell you
22 everything you need to know about what the
23 tobacco industry was about.
24       And in one of his documents, he said that
25 nicotine was the "sine qua non," Latin for without which there is nothing.  And that's the
2 truth about the tobacco industry.  That's what
3 they said in that document, Who Ain't for More
4 Money?  Do we want to tout cigarettes as a
5 drug?  They are.
6       But they all say here:  If we lose that
7 tobacco -- if we lose the nicotine in tobacco,
8 we could be out of business almost overnight.
9 We would all lose our jobs and our consulting
10 fees.  Philip Morris and the cigarette market
11 would collapse.  If we reduce and eliminate the
12 cigarette [sic] from our products, we shall
13 eventually liquidate our business.
14       And here is their -- here is their
15 confession:  The lawyers remind us, I'm told --
16       MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.
17       THE COURT:  Sustained.
18       MR. SCHLESINGER:  The lawyers remind us,
19 I'm told, that the entire matter of addiction
20 is the most potent weapon a prosecuting
21 attorney can have in a lung cancer/cigarette
22 case.  We can't defend smoking as free choice
23 if the person was addicted.
24       This is in the '80s, before Koop came out
25 in '88 and said, this is as addictive as heroin and cocaine; but they anticipated it and they
2 knew what impact that would have in their
3 ability to defend these cases.  So this is an
4 important document for you to consider, and
5 it's in evidence.
6       Here's my question:  We're in Florida.  I
7 don't know if the Florida lobster mini-season
8 is already over -- I think it is -- but lobster
9 traps --
10       We talked about hooks, but let's talk
11 about lobster traps.  Cigarette companies
12 engineer their -- their cigarettes to make it
13 as easy as possible to start, as easy as
14 possible for children to start.  That's the
15 basis of the business, the dirty little secret
16 that hides in plain sight.  They make it as
17 hard as possible to quit.  They don't want
18 their customers to quit.
19       My client, Glodine McCoy, may she rest in
20 peace, she was the perfect customer.  She fit
21 their plan to a tee.  She smoked their
22 cigarettes, she smoked their filters, she
23 smoked their lights.
24       Whatever they did to reassure her that
25 she was doing something safer and to undermine her quitting, they did it, and she followed
2 along like so many others like her.  She fit
3 the business plan to a tee.
4       She was a beloved customer, one of
5 millions, except when we got in the courtroom,
6 except when her -- her husband, John McCoy,
7 decided to pursue this legal action --
8       And he's an old man, and we are proud of
9 him for bringing this case --
10       MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.
11       THE COURT:  Sustained.
12       MR. SCHLESINGER:  In any event, the
13 lobster trap is this:  It's really hard to
14 get -- really easy to get in.  There's bait
15 inside, in crawls the lobster.  It's really
16 hard to get out.
17       The question is, why should cigarette
18 smoking be so hard?
19       In the defense of the case, the
20 defendants would have you believe that she
21 smoked enough to cause her peripheral vascular
22 disease, her heart disease, her COPD, her lung
23 cancer and death, but not enough to addict her.
24 That -- that doesn't make any sense.
25       Look at her.  She smoked all the time. She smoked for nicotine all the time.  These
2 are just natural family photos, right?  None of
3 these are staged.  This is just taking pictures
4 of family, okay?
5       All the pictures of the family, so many
6 of them, in every one of them, you see what
7 she's got in her hand?
8       She's got a cigarette.  She was a
9 cigarette smoker.  Smoking 20 cigarettes a day,
10 200 hits of nicotine to the brain a day is
11 because of nicotine addiction.
12       The preponderance of the evidence stands.
13 This is not a criminal case.  You will make a
14 decision by the greater weight of the evidence.
15 On balance, who wins by the preponderance of
16 the evidence.
17       They -- they're going to say this is some
18 evidence, they're going to say this is some
19 evidence, we'll show it, we're going to say
20 we've got some evidence that maybe is more
21 persuasive, more powerful, more reliable, and
22 we're going to say and prove to you that if we
23 tip the scales in our favor, not a criminal
24 case --
25       Raising a doubt does not get them to escape their responsibility.  But when you're
2 asking all the questions, what's more likely,
3 what makes common sense, what is the
4 preponderance, the greater weight of the
5 evidence, better than a coin toss, what's more
6 likely than not probable --
7       It's not absolute, so you can't get stuck
8 on the, well, maybe something else could have
9 happened.  There's going to be lots of maybes.
10 What probably explains this story, that's
11 what's important.
12       Here's what the National Institutes of
13 Drug -- on Drug Abuse, a federal agency --
14       Dr. Agharkar wouldn't recognize it.  I
15 wonder why.  He said that this --
16       This says that addiction is a chronic,
17 relapsing brain disease that is characterized
18 by compulsive drug-seeking and use, despite
19 harmful consequences.
20       All of the times they said that the
21 family said she said "shut up," she said,
22 you -- I think filters are better for me.
23       But, Mom, this could kill you.  Are you
24 blind?
25       All of those things, that's the classic response of the addict in denial, the person
2 looking for a place to live within themselves.
3 They want to believe the message put out by the
4 tobacco companies, it might not be harmful.
5 They want to believe it because that's --
6       If you -- if you give an uncertain
7 message, confusing picture to an addict, you
8 knock the pins under them.  You undermine their
9 ability to forcefully get after quitting.
10       And when she was addicted as a teenage
11 girl, going all the way back to the '40s and
12 the '50s and the '60s, there was nothing about
13 addiction out there that was meaningfully told.
14 To this day, there's nothing that says tobacco
15 smoking is addictive.  That's not going on.
16       Anyway, nicotine is the center of their
17 universe.  And all these documents that are all
18 in evidence talk about, we're in the business
19 of selling nicotine -- this is from the early
20 '60s, that's called the Battelle Hippo --
21 nicotine is addictive, the dominant
22 specifications for our product is nicotine
23 delivery, nicotine is potent, the industry is
24 designed upon the sale of nicotine, even to the
25 point where if you put a hungry rat in a cage and give him a drug, he's going to press that
2 lever and press that lever.
3       And they say, smoking is the lever push,
4 using Skinnerian techniques of operant
5 conditioning, showing how rats get addicted and
6 comparing those rats to the human smoker.
7       Without nicotine, the argument goes,
8 there would be no smoking.  Nobody's ever
9 become a cigarette smoker by smoking cigarettes
10 without nicotine.
11       We got the goods on them.  These were
12 never supposed to see the light of day.  You're
13 seeing them now and you're seeing what they
14 wrote, what they said.  And that is why we're
15 still studying them.
16       In the 2014, it says it's a treasure
17 trove, we're studying and writing research
18 articles all the time.
19       This -- and this is super important:  The
20 cigarette should be conceived not as a product,
21 but as the package.  The product is nicotine.
22 The cigarette is but one of the many layers.
23 Think of the cigarette as a pack of a storage
24 container for a day's supply of nicotine.  And
25 it goes on to say, it's a nicotine-delivery device.
2       You remember what Dr. Prochaska said?
3 This will shoot the nicotine to your brain --
4 this perfectly engineered, down to two decimal
5 places, nicotine-delivery device, precise
6 nicotine -- will shoot the nicotine to your
7 brain faster than an intravenous and hit that
8 brain 200 times a day.
9       So smokers often smoke for the avoidance
10 of withdrawal.  When that cigarette starts
11 wearing off, they get jittery, they get
12 nervous, and it gets to the point where they
13 can't think of nothing else and they've got to
14 have that cigarette.  So some of their free
15 will has been compromised, okay?
16       And very few consumers are aware of the
17 effects of nicotine, its addictive nature, and
18 that it's a poison.  It was always promoted as
19 something that had to do with health.
20       And, again, the Surgeon General's reports
21 that are in, talk about that when you
22 understand tobacco addiction, it helps you
23 understand why the tobacco user continues to
24 use tobacco despite the known health risks.
25       Every one of the defendants' statements -- and there were many, many, many
2 of them -- about what she heard and what she
3 knew, particularly in the '80s when it became
4 more clear and she was more responsive to her
5 children -- plays along with this line:
6 Knowing it's bad for you and smoking anyway is
7 a sign of addiction.
8       Now, addiction in the class membership
9 doesn't matter for class membership.  Addiction
10 may matter for fault, and we'll get to that,
11 but it also says that smoking is not a free
12 choice, because most smokers begin as teenagers
13 and then become addicted.
14       And then the Surgeon General '15,
15 Page 105, it talks about how difficult it is to
16 quit and how, in the United States, the
17 number one drug addiction, out of all drug
18 addictions, far and away is cigarettes.
19       You know, we see things happening with
20 cars and airbags and people being hurt, and you
21 think alcohol deaths or heroin deaths.  They
22 pale in significance to the numbers.  They are
23 a fraction to the numbers of cigarette diseases
24 in this country.  It's an important, ongoing
25 epidemic. Here's legal cause:  In order for
2 addiction to be a legal cause, it doesn't have
3 to be the only cause.  It can be in combination
4 and contribution of other acts.
5       So if she's smoking because she is
6 dependent, if some of the smoking -- if some of
7 that compulsive smoking is being driven by
8 nicotine, which we know it is, but also she's
9 enjoying it or she's not trying hard enough to
10 quit, that means that she's entitled to get the
11 contributing cause instruction to say that
12 smoking is a legal cause.
13       Here, does it contribute substantially?
14 Meaning, did the addiction play an important
15 role?
16       If she wasn't addicted to nicotine, would
17 she have smoked one or more packs per day every
18 day for 50 years?  Hundreds and hundreds of
19 thousands of cigarettes, millions of hits of
20 this nicotine drug, this short-acting nicotine
21 drug to the brain?
22       What's missing from here?  In the class
23 membership definition, you will not see
24 anything that says choice has something to do
25 with -- with class membership.  It's a threshold term.  All Floridians.  Maintain her
2 in the class where she obviously belongs.
3 She's got the requisite predicate evidence to
4 be there.
5       You can make these things as hard as you
6 want or as easy as you want.  The records we
7 showed you and the tobacco addiction in the
8 chart, in two minutes, somebody can easily come
9 to the conclusion, yep, she was obviously
10 addicted, it drove the compulsive smoking, led
11 to disease, she's a class member under Engle.
12       They want to escape their responsibility
13 by keeping her out of --
14       MR. FURR:  Objection.
15       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- the class.
16       THE COURT:  Sustained.
17       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Or if the -- if they
18 kept her out of the class, they would not face
19 responsibility for the --
20       MR. FURR:  Objection.
21       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- the Engle lawsuit
22 findings.
23       THE COURT:  Sustained.
24       Counsel --
25       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.  All right. THE COURT:  -- I sustained the objection.
2       MR. FURR:  Your Honor, same motion as
3 before.
4       THE COURT:  Thank you.  Same ruling as
5 before.  It's denied.
6       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Again, so this is
7 addiction as a concurring cause.  It only has
8 to be a legal cause of disease, it can act in
9 combination with other things.  It's not the
10 all or none.
11       But she was dependent on nicotine in
12 cigarettes, she was addicted, and you will see
13 that whatever the combinations were, taste,
14 flavor, whatever, it still contributes.
15       What did they say?  Did they choose
16 profits over public health?  Did they want
17 smokers to quit?
18       Here are the documents in evidence where
19 they talked about a guy who was coming up with
20 a way to get a chemical that would block the
21 nicotine.
22       And what were they afraid of and why
23 wouldn't they fund his program?  Because it was
24 having some great success.  And this is back in
25 the '70s. Remember, nicotine patches, nicotine gum
2 didn't come out until the '80s.  They slowed
3 the introduction of help to patients.  They
4 didn't care.  They weren't setting up
5 smoking-cessation clinics.
6       They weren't fielding customers who were
7 30 years old, that had started at 14, who said,
8 you know, I want to start a family now, I've
9 been using your products for the last 15 years,
10 I need some help to get off, can you help me?
11 They didn't demonstrate that.
12       They worked just like they did when they
13 boycotted Merrell Dow, who was introducing a
14 smoking-cessation product, the gum.
15       They didn't want people to quit, and they
16 proved it by their actions as documented in
17 their secret records.
18       And, remember, there is an old Chinese
19 proverb:  The palest ink is much more vivid
20 than the brightest memory.
21       So what we've got nails down internally
22 the lies they were telling the public publicly.
23 And he said, if we let this guy come up with a
24 way to block the nicotine, we're in the process
25 of digging our own grave. And the question you've got to ask
2 yourself is, whose graves were they willing to
3 dig but their own?
4       MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.
5       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Now, the program has
6 the potential to do great damage to the
7 industry.  It undermines the public posture.
8 We've taken outsiders, they admit they're
9 lying, they're telling a different story inside
10 than they did outside, and that antagonist
11 could put the tobacco manufacturers out of
12 business.
13       The believability of witnesses.  We'll
14 get into this a little bit real quick.  You
15 need to know that you have the power to decide
16 who to believe.  You have the power to judge
17 the demeanor of the live witnesses.
18       So the folks that testified before you,
19 you get to look them in the eye, you get to
20 take some notes, you get the feel and measure
21 of what they had to say.
22       And who did we bring into the courtroom?
23 Dr. Prochaska.  What a -- what a -- what a
24 well-credentialed, true scientist, working
25 deeply in the program.  She demonstrated the gravitas.
2       We tried to honor this process by
3 bringing to you the world's leaders who are
4 contributing to the cutting-edge research
5 reports, who are dedicating their life to
6 figuring out how can we help people with
7 tobacco addiction.
8       And she's explaining, we've got to look
9 at what the tobacco manufacturers are doing,
10 because the tobacco epidemic is so recalcitrant
11 to elimination, because a powerful industry
12 depends upon its perpetuation.  There is a
13 driving force.  She called it a vector.
14       You know what a vector is.  A vector is
15 that which spreads disease.  A virus, a germ.
16 She described them to a vector.  That's in
17 evidence in this case.
18       So when you consider believability of
19 witnesses, take Prochaska.  Never been in a
20 courtroom before, never came to court to
21 testify, came to do a benefit for the clients
22 and public health.
23       Dr. Mannino, he talked -- he wrote the
24 chapter on chronic obstructive pulmonary
25 disease in the very current Surgeon General's report, a giant in his field, a well-respected
2 authority, not only nationwide, but worldwide,
3 and came before you and was willing to describe
4 and explain and took of his time and came back
5 another weekend to be here with us, and I think
6 that dignifies the proceedings and honors --
7       MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.
8       THE COURT:  Sustained.
9       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Similarly, Dr. Proctor
10 came and testified.  The man has got tremendous
11 credentials.  He is the world's leading
12 researcher on what he says is the origins of
13 the cigarette catastrophe, explaining what
14 happened.  Because those of us who forget
15 history are doomed to repeat it.  And he's laid
16 it out.
17       And it will be studied for decades,
18 because 80 million documents takes a long time
19 to study.  But those witnesses are believable.
20       Now, when it comes to someone who's an
21 expert, how did you get to be an expert?  You
22 get to be an expert because you do something
23 that distinguishes you.  You dedicate your
24 life, you -- you study -- you're scholarly, you
25 contribute to the literature, you write, you teach, you want people to know, you commit
2 yourself on paper to what you've accomplished.
3 You have your colleagues read it for -- for --
4 for veracity and accuracy, so that when it gets
5 into the journals to teach other people, it's
6 accurate.
7       Our experts did that in abundance.  Their
8 experts did it not at all.  And I will submit
9 to you, as we get into more detail in this,
10 that the power you hold is the expert witness
11 instruction which says experts are special and
12 why you may consider their testimony and give
13 it the weights it deserves.
14       If it doesn't meet with the bounds of
15 common sense, if you find that it contradicts
16 everything you saw in this courtroom, you may
17 reject it.  You have that power.
18       So you may say, how could Dr. -- how
19 could Judge Murphy let them say these things --
20       MR. FURR:  Objection.
21       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- in this courtroom?
22 But he let them --
23       THE COURT:  Sustained.
24       Counsel...
25       MR. SCHLESINGER:  The evidence is permitted because you were empowered through
2 the jury instruction to reject it.  And I
3 suggest that you do reject it.
4       Oh, so the strawman.  I'll go back to
5 that.
6       So why --
7       There's a false equivalency here, and I
8 must touch on it very quickly.  The false
9 equivalency is that Dr. Proctor charged a lot
10 of money.
11       He's been drafted into this series of
12 Engle class individual cases that are being
13 tried all up and down this -- this -- this
14 state, and he's pulled all over coming to
15 court.  And he went to Miami.  Remember he went
16 to Miami right after our case?  And I'm pretty
17 sure he's back in Miami.  If we go --
18       When we go to punitive damages with you
19 all, if the timing is right, we'll bring him
20 back in here --
21       MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.
22       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- to talk to you
23 again.
24       THE COURT:  Sustained.
25       MR. SCHLESINGER:  In any event, Dr. -- Dr. Proctor, here's what he did.  Here's
2 how he became an expert.  He built a better
3 mousetrap and the world beat a path to his
4 door.  Remember that saying?
5       If you invent something, if you do
6 something, if you distinguish yourself among
7 the world's experts, and do something no one
8 else has ever done, and that information, that
9 scholarship becomes necessary in a court of law
10 where many cases are going on, you will be
11 sought out, as opposed to going to someone who
12 you call an expert, who has experience coming
13 into courtrooms but doesn't have any specialty
14 in nicotine, nicotine addiction, anything like
15 that.
16       That is not the kind of expert that can
17 match up with an expert who has built the
18 better mousetrap.
19       So it's a -- it's a shifting
20 justification, it's a false equivalency to try
21 to compare Proctor merely because he charged
22 money over time because of all these cases that
23 are -- they're seeking to defy and to --
24       MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.
25       THE COURT:  Sustained.  Counsel -- MR. SCHLESINGER:  I misspoke.  To try --
2       MR. TEPIKIAN:  Your Honor --
3       MR. FURR:  Your Honor, may we approach?
4       MR. SCHLESINGER:  I misspoke, Judge.  I
5 meant to say "try."
6       MR. FURR:  I would like to approach.
7       THE COURT:  Sure.
8 at
9 sidebar:)
10       THE COURT:  Yes, sir?
11       MR. FURR:  I move for mistrial.  Once
12 again, he's basically --
13       He's attacking the defense of this
14 lawsuit.  And also on the cumulative effect of
15 all the attacks that have been made during the
16 course of his closing.
17       THE COURT:  Wish to be heard?
18       MR. SCHLESINGER:  No.
19       THE COURT:  Counsel, just -- you go into
20 the evidence.
21       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.
22       THE COURT:  Don't -- don't go after the
23 defense, all right?
24       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.
25       THE COURT:  Thank you. MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'm going back to the
2 defense's witness.
3       THE COURT:  The objection's sustained.
4       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.  I will.  I'll
5 watch it, Judge.
6       THE COURT:  Thank you.  But there's no
7 manifest necessity for a mistrial.  I sustain
8 the objection.
9      (Sidebar discussion was concluded, and the
10 following was held in open court:)
11       MR. SCHLESINGER:  May I proceed?
12       THE COURT:  Hold on, hold on.  Let
13 everybody get set.
14       All right, Counsel, you may proceed.
15       MR. SCHLESINGER:  In any -- in any event,
16 this is why I use this imagery.  I say, Proctor
17 deserves to be here.  He built a better
18 mousetrap.
19       Here's what is undisputed, because this
20 will be on the verdict form, and I want to show
21 you -- I want to show you that.
22       Not -- not yet.
23       This is going to be on the verdict --
24       This is not on the verdict form.
25       It's undisputed, it's an acknowledgment and admission that Reynolds --
2       MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.
3       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- and Philip Morris
4 admit that cigarettes --
5       MR. FURR:  Objection.
6       Excuse me, sir.
7       MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection.
8       THE COURT:  It's not an admission.
9 Sustained.
10       MR. SCHLESINGER:  It is undisputed that
11 R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris have admitted,
12 through their expert, Dr. Klein, that
13 cigarettes caused Glodine McCoy to get lung
14 cancer and die.  There is no evidence to the
15 contrary.
16       That question is going to be on the
17 verdict form.  There is no evidence to the
18 contrary.  The death certificate says it,
19 Mannino said it, Altschuler said it, all the
20 doctors said it.  Even Dr. Klein admitted it.
21       Now, here's what's interesting:  The very
22 first time you heard in this courtroom from
23 anybody from the defense that there was an
24 acknowledgment and admission --
25       MR. FURR:  Objection. MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- that cigarette
2 smoking --
3       THE COURT:  Excuse me.  Sustained.
4       MR. SCHLESINGER:  In any event, you will
5 see that Dr. Klein acknowledged that Glodine
6 McCoy died from cigarette smoking and lung
7 cancer caused by cigarette smoking.
8       And, so, when you get to that question on
9 the verdict form, did Glodine McCoy's lung
10 cancer cause her death, the only question --
11 the only answer you can check off is "yes."
12       Some of these things, there's competing
13 evidence and you have to hash it out.  There's
14 no competing evidence here.  None.  Not one
15 reference anywhere to anything.  No witness, no
16 expert, no medical testimony.  That's important
17 to remember.
18       So here's the verdict form:  Was Glodine
19 McCoy addicted to cigarettes containing
20 nicotine?  And, if so, was such addiction a
21 legal cause of her chronic obstructive
22 pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease,
23 peripheral vascular disease, and lung cancer?
24       And the answer to every one of those
25 questions is "yes."  Every one of them. Now, there's something you didn't hear
2 that I must touch on real quick here.  There's
3 something you didn't hear.  You're not going to
4 be making any decisions in this case, you're
5 not going to be making any determinations as to
6 some of the issues you heard tried in this
7 case.
8       One of those important issues is, did she
9 have a heart attack --
10       MR. FURR:  Objection.
11       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- before 1990.
12 That -- that is not an issue in this case.
13 That is not for your determination, you will
14 not hear it.  You heard it from counsel in
15 opening statement.  This will be something you
16 are to decide.
17       MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.
18       THE COURT:  Sustained.
19       MR. SCHLESINGER:  The issues in the case,
20 you will see from the instructions and the
21 verdict form, do not ask you to make the
22 determination as to when Glodine McCoy, who had
23 her heart attack, when it was.  We -- the --
24       You're not asked that question.
25       Similarly, you will not be asked the question, you will not have to decide, you will
2 not have to debate, you will not have to weigh
3 evidence, you will not be confronted with the
4 issue of was Glodine McCoy knowledgeably
5 suffering from COPD back before May 5th of
6 1990.
7       Those are not in this case for your
8 determination.  You must remember that.  Don't
9 be confused by it.  Don't be looking for it and
10 writing questions and sending it out saying,
11 where is that question?
12       It's been handled, it's been resolved --
13       MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.
14       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- it's been --
15       THE COURT:  Sustained.
16       Counsel, move on.
17       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.  It's not an
18 issue for your determination.  That's why you
19 see these questions.  And the only questions
20 talk about did she have an addiction which in
21 some way -- a dependence -- contributed to
22 cause --
23       Was it a contributing cause of her lung
24 cancer -- I'm sorry, of her four different
25 diseases; and, ultimately, down here, did it cause her lung cancer.  And we -- and it
2 obviously did.
3       And, then, Dr. Altschuler's testimony
4 verifies it.  You heard it, you took notes, I
5 won't spend time on it, but he said the
6 vascular disease was a consequence of her
7 peripheral -- of her nicotine addiction.
8       Mr. Furr said there would be no proof
9 that cigarettes cause peripheral vascular
10 disease.  There is no proof that cigarettes
11 didn't cause peripheral vascular disease.  All
12 the proof is that cigarettes caused peripheral
13 vascular disease.
14       Both Mannino, an expert we brought in,
15 and Dr. Altschuler, who came here not for
16 money, who came here to help a client, a former
17 patient --
18       MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.
19       MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection.
20       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- for many years
21 later --
22       THE COURT:  Sustained.
23       Counsel...
24       MR. SCHLESINGER:  In any event, this is
25 the testimony they gave.  Same thing with Altschuler saying he was treating her for a
2 heart consequence as a consequence of
3 historical nicotine addiction.
4       So this question says --
5       Can I get this?  Can I have the ELMO,
6 please?
7       This question says:  Was Glodine McCoy
8 addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine;
9 and, if so, was addiction a legal cause of
10 these conditions?
11       That's the question:  Did the nicotine
12 addiction contribute?
13       And you'll see --
14       I need it back, the clicker now, please.
15       So, the wild goose chase.  Everything
16 having to do with pre-May 5th, 1990 --
17       MR. FURR:  Objection.
18       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- is no longer part of
19 the case.
20       THE COURT:  Sustained.
21       MR. SCHLESINGER:  The question you do
22 have to talk about is lung cancer.  And because
23 you will be asked to determine if lung cancer
24 caused -- if her lung cancer manifested before
25 November 21, 1996. It clearly did, because the medical
2 records say, in no uncertain terms, that, on
3 December 6th, '96, which is where the diagnosis
4 was made --
5       Which, yes, December 6th, '96, is after
6 11/21/96.  Yes, it is.  But remember what
7 Mr. Furr said in his opening statement?
8 Statute of lim -- deadlines count; and even if
9 it's one day over or one day before, it counts?
10       Well, one day over, one day before
11 counts.  If she got the symptoms of lung cancer
12 that led to the diagnosis before December 6th,
13 '96, and before November 21, '96, she is also a
14 class member, just by virtue of the lung
15 cancer.  You must remember that.
16       And the evidence and the overwhelming
17 weight of the evidence is, very simply, that
18 the medical record says the symptoms have
19 worsened over the past week, but they have been
20 present for the last month.
21       So December 6th, '96, goes back to at
22 least November 6th, '96, and that precedes
23 11/21/96, and, therefore, that's class --
24 that's a -- that's a disease that appeared in
25 the class period. Now, this is important to remember.  And
2 there's a lot more evidence on it, and we'll
3 talk about it some more.  This is an important
4 thing to remember when you're making this
5 decision, okay?
6       And that is that the condition manifests
7 by showing signs and symptoms of what
8 ultimately led to the diagnosis.
9       So when you go back --
10       When you have a record from afterwards
11 and you go back to what the condition was that
12 led to the diagnosis, that's manifestation
13 under -- under the terms of the law.
14       So this is an easy determination.  She
15 gets that question answered.  Dr. Altschuler
16 confirmed it, Dr. Mannino confirmed it.  And
17 Dr. Mannino went on as far as to say that he
18 was going to explain how he had some x-rays in
19 the chiropractic -- in the chiropractic office.
20 So that's -- that's important.
21       Let me tell you about that real quick.
22 Let me tell you about that.  Let's put this in
23 perspective.
24       This was a woman who had a heart attack,
25 quit smoking, right, was able to finally quit smoking after she had a devastating illness
2 that -- that made her think she was going to
3 die.
4       Then, years go by, and in the fall of
5 1996, she starts feeling poorly.  And while
6 she's feeling poorly, her family is concerned
7 and they treat her at the chiropractic's office
8 for musculoskeletal, because she's got some
9 shoulder pain.
10       Her son talks about around the time of
11 getting the Halloween costumes in the quiet of
12 the car, he noticed she was starting to get
13 hoarse -- hoarse.  She was getting --
14       She was wasting, she was losing weight
15 and getting skinny, and she was looking frail,
16 and the family was concerned.
17       And, at some point, there was a chest
18 x-ray done in that chiropractic office, and
19 somebody saw something -- chiropractors, not
20 radiologists -- and they were worried, ma, you
21 got to see a doctor.
22       And she went to see Dr. Berman, who had
23 replaced Dr. Sherman who had retired, and she
24 went to see Dr. Berman on the initial office
25 visit on November 22nd, '96 -- which is what Dr. Mannino said, from the review of the
2 record -- x-rays in hand, x-rays from the
3 chiropractor's office for days later, x-rays
4 from before November 21.
5       And what did Dr. Berman say when he saw
6 it?  He said, there is a spot on the lung.
7       Now, think about that.  What does it mean
8 in the common parlance of laypeople's
9 understanding when the terminology of a beloved
10 family member is expressed, saying, I see a
11 spot on a lung?
12       Here's what it is:  It's a punch in the
13 gut.  It's the time when time stands still,
14 because everybody knows what it means.  It is
15 terror, it causes panic, it causes the desire
16 in a woman who's already had a
17 cigarette-related disease to want to run away,
18 to escape, to --
19       MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.
20       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- flee.
21       It is completely nat --
22       THE COURT:  What's the objection?
23       Excuse me.
24       MR. FURR:  There is no such evidence in
25 this case. THE COURT:  Overruled.
2       MR. SCHLESINGER:  To deny --
3       THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, you are
4 to rely on your own recollection of the
5 evidence.  This is argument.
6       Proceed.
7       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Is it natural from the
8 sequence of events to imagine the heartache,
9 the fear, the pain of hearing that term, a
10 "spot" on the lung?  What does it mean?
11       Mom, this is something, we have to do
12 something about this.  We can't -- we can't --
13 we can't ignore this.
14       And they go and they see Dr. Berman.  He
15 says, yeah, you got to see a pulmonology
16 doctor, an expert, there's -- this is
17 worrisome.
18       And then what did the family do?  What
19 did all their testimony do?
20       You don't want to hear the other shoe
21 drop.  If this is going to be my last
22 Thanksgiving, let's spend it with the family,
23 if this is what it's going to be.
24       Doesn't that show she knew what was going
25 to happen or could happen?  Maybe you could -- Oh, I hope it isn't that's what it is, I hope
2 it isn't that's what it is.
3       And you get the family together and you
4 gather them in that small apartment.  It's a
5 big family, and you gather them in that small
6 apartment and you have the celebration of life,
7 because it's -- they're afraid it's going to be
8 the last Thanksgiving.  And then they go --
9       After November 22nd, with Dr. Berman --
10 November 28th is Thanksgiving -- December 6th,
11 they see the lung specialist.  And what does
12 his note say?  We'll show it to you.
13       It says you have endobronchial lung
14 cancer, metastatic lung cancer, lung cancer
15 that's spread so much, when I reach into your
16 collarbone, I can feel it, and you're hoarse.
17 That's an invasion into the laryngeal nerve,
18 paralyzing the laryngeal nerve.
19       This is a death sentence.  Our experts
20 testified to it.  It is a prognostically grave
21 sign.  This is the sequence of events that
22 occurred going back into the August, September,
23 October time frame.  And that is why Dr. Labi
24 documented that these symptoms, although they
25 worsened, had been in existence for -- for a month.
2       And what did their doctor say?  You know,
3 we brought you heavyweight witnesses, and they
4 tried to counter -- counterbalance it with a
5 lightweight.  They brought in --
6       MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.
7       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- Dr. Klein.
8       THE COURT:  Sustained.
9       Counsel --
10       MR. TEPIKIAN:  Move to strike.
11       THE COURT:  The jury is to disregard the
12 last comment.
13       MR. SCHLESINGER:  We tried to bring in
14 excellent witnesses.  They counterbalance with
15 a witness who has made no contributions to the
16 literature, has not distinguished himself with
17 books or records or anything that we could read
18 and challenge him on.
19       He doesn't exist in the research, he
20 doesn't exist as a professor in a university.
21 You couldn't find him researching for a great
22 professor anywhere.
23       And -- and what did he say?  Oh, I think
24 the symptoms were there for a week or so.
25       Now, you think about what really happened in human terms during that period of time, in
2 that November time frame, and whether or not
3 that meets with the ring of truth, because I
4 say that -- I submit that I stitched this
5 together to you, and it does.
6       So here's the Engle class period.  What
7 was the defense in the case?
8       Remember back in the olden days, in
9 Hollywood, we had those trampolines in the
10 ground on Hollywood Beach, and you could bounce
11 really high on them.  I mean, woom, on
12 Hollywood Beach, right on the boardwalk, as
13 kids, there were trampolines.
14       If a defense is -- is -- has an agenda, a
15 preexisting agenda, not to analyze the medicine
16 as to what really happened --
17       MR. FURR:  Objection.
18       THE COURT:  Sustained.  Why don't you
19 come sidebar.
20       MR. FURR:  Take it down, please.
21 at
22 sidebar:)
23       MR. SCHLESINGER:  I gave over all these
24 exhibits, Judge.  They were all approved.
25       THE COURT:  Wait until Mr. Furr gets here.
2       MR. SCHLESINGER:  I did everything I
3 could not to have any surprise.
4       THE COURT:  I just don't want you to --
5       You're basically -- it sounds like you're
6 denigrating defense.
7       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Not at all.
8       THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, that's what it
9 sounds like to me.
10       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Not at all.  I'm
11 talking about the concept --
12       THE COURT:  Thank you.  That's why I
13 brought you sidebar, okay?
14       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.
15       THE COURT:  So I don't want --
16       MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'll try --
17       MR. TEPIKIAN:  Your Honor, we'll move for
18 another mistrial based on this.
19       MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is so tame.
20       THE COURT:  Excuse me.
21       MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is so tame.
22       MR. TEPIKIAN:  Are you done?
23       This is absolutely denigrating to the
24 defense of this case in front of this jury and
25 we move for a mistrial. MR. FURR:  And on the cumulative effect
2 of all the denigrations of the defense.
3       THE COURT:  Thank you.  The motion is
4 noted.  It's denied.  There's no manifest
5 necessity for a mistrial.
6       Just take it easy.
7       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, sir.
8      (Sidebar discussion was concluded, and the
9 following was held in open court:)
10       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Tell me when you're all
11 ready.
12       MR. FURR:  I'm ready.
13       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Now, what I think was
14 interesting about this was this:  Remember the
15 exhibit that Dr. Klein put up, and it had a
16 calendar, and in red -- in really big red, it
17 said "end of Engle class period"?  Remember
18 that?  So that his testimony was --
19       He demarcated the end of an Engle class
20 period.  He said, I think it was, you know,
21 December 6th, it was probably there for a week
22 or so.  What does "or so" mean?  He didn't
23 define that.  So he did not change the medical
24 record evidence.
25       And what I talked about, organic records, these are records that existed at the time.
2 Nobody created them to try to make a
3 litigation.  These are just the records of a
4 poor woman with a fatal disease, being treated,
5 family trying to dutifully gather those records
6 up -- thank goodness they had them -- and it
7 proves very clearly that she's within the class
8 period.  It just so happens to prove it.
9 That's just the -- that's just the math.
10 That's just the math of it.
11       So these are the class members.  You
12 know, as a class member, all these -- all these
13 apply, all these diseases apply.  She got the
14 big four.  She got hit with four of them, all
15 from smoking, okay?
16       There's nicotine is addictive, the
17 defendants put cigarettes on the market that
18 are defective and unreasonably dangerous, and
19 smoking causes all these diseases.
20       What is more, there was concealment, an
21 omission of material information that the
22 defendants knew were false, and they disclosed
23 it.  And then they got together, they all
24 agreed to get together to -- to put out this
25 fraud -- because that's what it is, it's a fraudulent concealment -- and they all got
2 together in a conspiracy to hide the health
3 effects from smoking, with the intention that
4 people would rely, and they knew that these
5 material facts were not otherwise known.
6       So when they talk about what Glodine
7 knew, the bigger question is:  What didn't
8 Glodine know?
9       And all the things they concealed from
10 her are what she was relying on, believing in
11 filters, to keep smoking.  And, like I said,
12 the palest ink is more vivid than the brightest
13 memory.
14       They knew and they said, we're going to
15 be charged with -- with making false and
16 misleading statements that promote the sale of
17 cigarettes.  And you know what?  It worked.  It
18 worked great.
19       If you look at those charts of smoking,
20 every time they put out their health
21 reassurance message, up went the cigarette
22 sales.
23       John McCoy talked extensively about the
24 fact that Glo believed that filters would help
25 her and that they were safer.  You heard that testimony from him.  And that was exactly what
2 the tobacco companies were shooting for.  They
3 counted on it.  She fit their plan to a tee.
4 She was the perfect customer.
5       They knew that doubt was their product.
6 They said, doubt is our product.  They said,
7 the most important story is the one that casts
8 doubt.  They said, look for some other factor
9 to explain why the people are getting sick.
10 The key word is "confusion."
11       And what did they give Glodine McCoy?  A
12 psychological crutch and self-rationale to
13 continue smoking.  They put those fake filters
14 on the market.  They were a marketing ploy, a
15 marketing gimmick, they were never meant to
16 work.  They knew what they said was an
17 independent research organization was nothing
18 more than a -- than a holding pattern, a
19 defensive front.
20       And then there's lots of stuff here from
21 the Surgeon General, you'll see, talking about
22 how filters were actually worse, they caused
23 adenocarcinoma.  Page 163 through Page 168.
24 There's major conclusions that explain that
25 clearly. The Surgeon General 2010 said, hey, we
2 figured out they were faking us out -- faking
3 us out.  The designs were used, these filters
4 and lights were used as a tool by the tobacco
5 industry to undermine prevention and cessation
6 efforts.
7       They said, with regard to Kent, a nice
8 jolt of nicotine, and we're going to tell them,
9 here's our triple, quadruple filter, and it's
10 going to remove whatever harmful elements of
11 smoke are there.
12       This is what Glodine McCoy heard, this is
13 what Glodine McCoy counted -- counted on.
14 These Kent cigarettes, the Parliament
15 cigarettes, that's what she was smoking.  They
16 were the health brands.
17       They got the Reader's Digest -- remember,
18 who did anti-smoking ads -- they were an
19 unwitting third party.  Tobacco used them as a
20 catspaw.  They were able to see that they were
21 playing up on the fact that Reader's Digest got
22 duped and mistakenly started saying, use these
23 filters.  If you're going to keep smoking, use
24 filters.  And look what --
25       Sales went from four billion to 38 billion, because they had marketed Kent as a
2 safer cigarette to still instinctive fears.
3       And John McCoy corroborated it.  She
4 started using the filters.  She used the
5 Parliaments, the Kents.  She tried the filter.
6 She thought they were better for her health.
7 That is her relying on these messages.  Those
8 lies contribute.
9       Health protections, scientists smoke, low
10 tar, recessed Parliaments, low-tar Kents, these
11 are the ads she was inundated with.
12       The monograph, I'll let you read it, but
13 Pages 205, 207, and 233, say, in no uncertain
14 terms, Kent was for health, Parliament was for
15 health.
16       Folks were smoking them because they were
17 concerned about their health, they were
18 perceived as being more healthy, and the
19 National Cancer Institute's monograph from
20 2001, Number 13, that's in evidence for you to
21 look at in this case, the final conclusions,
22 Page 233, say, in no uncertain terms, that the
23 filters were used to reassure smokers and that
24 they were deceitful.
25       Now, here's my -- here's my -- there's a --
2       The Judge read a jury instruction about
3 circuitous.  It doesn't have to be a direct
4 statement to Glodine.  It doesn't have to --
5       I don't have to put in Glodine's hand,
6 her sitting in front of a television set
7 watching the Traveling Truth Squad, or Bill
8 Dwyer, or somebody.  It can reach her by
9 circuitous means.
10       And one of the things that Mr. Furr
11 said -- and he's a very -- very bright,
12 formidable, well-spoken attorney, and he does a
13 good job defending his client, and he's -- he's
14 supposed to do that, but he made statements to
15 you in opening statement and in
16 cross-examination with Dr. Proctor, saying,
17 well, you know the government was supporting
18 filters, you know the government was promoting
19 filters.
20       The government was promoting filters as
21 an unwilling dupe.  So if the tobacco companies
22 duped the third parties, the Surgeon General,
23 and whatnot, and those third parties
24 unwillingly passed lies to Glodine McCoy and
25 she relied on what they said, and they had been, in turn, relying on the tobacco
2 companies, tobacco companies don't escape
3 liability by misleading the government.  It
4 just doesn't happen that way.  That's the
5 circle of deceit.
6       So that's a circuitous way.  She didn't
7 rely on us, she relied on the government, but
8 you guys faked the government out.  And it's in
9 no uncertain terms that the reliance doesn't
10 have to be on a direct statement.
11       This is in --
12       You can read this, I won't read it, but a
13 circuitous channel reaching her; meaning, if I
14 use those -- if I have an unwitting third
15 party -- unwitting innocent third party like
16 Reader's Digest or the Surgeon General and it
17 gets to Glodine and that helps her undermine
18 her cessation efforts because she's getting
19 false reassurances --
20       And you can't --
21       If you give an addict some place where
22 they can live in themselves, to believe maybe
23 this is not bad, you're -- you're demotivating
24 him.  It's "operation stumbling block."
25 They're never going to be able to quit. And then what happened ultimately?  In
2 19 --
3       It took until 2008, almost over 40 years.
4 The industry -- the public health authority was
5 fooled by what the tobacco companies did,
6 conned by them.
7       Finally, in 2008, they said, we're not
8 going to say you should smoke -- filters are
9 better, we're not going to put these numbers on
10 the pack anymore, because the -- the tobacco
11 companies can't wrap their misleading tar and
12 nicotine ratings in a cloak of government
13 sponsorship.
14       Simply put, the FTC will not be a
15 smoke -- smoke screen for tobacco companies'
16 shameful marketing practices.
17       And that's exactly what John McCoy said.
18 That news coverage, she would reassure him by
19 saying, I'm being told by the tobacco companies
20 they got their own scientists, they're looking
21 into it, they say, smoke filters, that's what
22 I'm doing.  Those will be better for me.
23       Those statements were legion and they
24 were exactly what tobacco expected.  The Engle
25 findings say they made those misleading statements so smokers could rely, and she was
2 one of millions of smokers who did rely.  She's
3 a typical -- play it, please -- typical generic
4 smoker.
5       (The video clip was played and taken down
6 to the best of the reporter's ability as
7 follows:)
8       VOICE:  ...take the controversy about
9 cigarettes.  In the 91st Congress, a house
10 committee heard testimony from leading experts
11 on smoking and health.  The record shows that
12 many of the country's most respected doctors
13 openly challenged anti-cigarette claims.
14       VOICE:  And I have to disagree with you
15 in that we don't know what causes the ailments
16 that have been attributed to cigarette smoking.
17       VOICE:  Insofar as the correlation
18 between lung cancer and cigarette smoking are
19 concerned, no one knows.  It may, it may not.
20       VOICE:  Cigarette smoking does not cause
21 cancer, yes or no?
22       VOICE:  It is not known whether
23 cigarettes cause cancer.
24       VOICE:  All right, sir.
25       VOICE:  It has not been causally established.
2       VOICE:  Cigarette smoking -- no causal
3 relationship between cigarette smoking and
4 emphysema?
5       VOICE:  Despite all of the research to
6 date, there has been no causal link
7 established.
8       VOICE:  The case is still open.  The jury
9 has not come in.
10       VOICE:  It may not be harmful, you're not
11 convinced?
12       VOICE:  It may be or it may not be.  We
13 don't know.
14       VOICE:  Do cigarettes cause cancer?
15       VOICE:  I don't know if they do or not.
16       VOICE:  I'm not in a position to give you
17 a "does" or "does not" answer.
18       VOICE:  We -- we have looked at the data
19 and the data that we have been able to see has
20 all been statistical data that has not
21 convinced me that smoking causes death.
22       VOICE:  We don't know what causes cancer
23 in general right now, so I -- I think that we
24 may find out what causes cancer and we may find
25 out some relationship which -- which has yet to be proven.
2       (Video clip concluded.)
3       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thousands and
4 thousands, untold thousands of these messages,
5 along with a quarter billion dollars in
6 advertising promoting the message of health
7 reassurance, glamor, youth, all these things
8 were being promoted, all this time, and they
9 want to say, in this courtroom, Glodine knew?
10       If she knew or she was supposed to know,
11 why didn't any of them know?  Why didn't the
12 tobacco executives know?  If everybody knew,
13 why didn't they know?
14       Remember, in the FTC reports, they talk
15 about some beautiful ads, and they say they're
16 spending 365 to one, and they're saying the
17 Surgeon General has no chance against this.
18       The message of this health authority, out
19 to protect the public health, is completely
20 overwhelmed, overwhelmed by the messages of
21 doubt being promoted by tobacco and the
22 pervasive ads and the beauty of the ads.
23       Class membership is not about fault.
24 We'll get to that.  Class membership is not
25 about fault.  It's a simple threshold determination of addiction causing disease.
2 You're going to get to -- a chance to discuss
3 fault.
4       But when we talk about the reliance on
5 the lies, and the fact that she fell into their
6 trap and she was one of the ones that acted in
7 accordance with their business plan that would
8 continually shoot the sales of cigarettes
9 through the roof --
10       Cigarette --
11       Every time they would introduce a filter,
12 cigarette would go up.  Every time they would
13 issue a statement that it isn't going to be bad
14 for you, we're getting to the truth of it,
15 cigarettes would go up.
16       The fact of the matter is, is how do you
17 know it matters to -- to Glodine McCoy?
18       Lies costs lives.  What didn't Glodine
19 McCoy know?  What didn't she know?
20       Did she know that there was a -- a
21 conspiracy formed by these companies, along
22 with these inde -- these -- these research
23 groups, supposedly independent research groups,
24 the TI -- the CTR, the TI, all these different
25 groups that formed a conspiracy to fraudulently conceal the legal effects and addictive nature
2 of smoking?  No.
3       Did she know they were hiring scientists
4 and doctors to mislead the public about the
5 health effects and addictive nature?  No.
6       Did she know they were misleading the
7 Surgeon General, on whom she may have been
8 relying to some extent, and other public health
9 authorities about, go ahead, smoke the filters?
10       Did she know that they were taking --
11 they were embarking upon a plan to smear and
12 belittle the public health authority?
13       They were studying nicotine,
14 manipulating, knowing it was an addictive drug,
15 targeting children, with 90 percent of all
16 smokers start as teenagers.
17       Knowing that cigarettes were killing
18 hundreds of thousands a year, and saying, I'll
19 never agree that smoking cigarettes even kills
20 one person, manipulating the levels of nicotine
21 with great precision and control to maintain
22 the buying -- public buying -- buying
23 cigarettes?
24       Did she know that there were 70
25 causing-cancer agents in every puff of smoke she inhaled, chemicals like arsenic, cyanide,
2 radioactive Polonium, that filtered cigarettes
3 were no safer and actually more dangerous, and
4 that they -- the conspirators were purposefully
5 misleading the public about the safety of
6 filters and lar -- low-tar cigarettes?
7       And what did they say about it?  We're
8 going to keep them smoking with a psychological
9 crutch.
10       They studied the psychology, how do we
11 keep that addict addicted.  An illusion of
12 filtration, a marketing gimmick.
13       And now, here, wrap your minds around
14 this.  Wrap your minds around this.
15 Ninety-nine percent of all cigarettes, to this
16 day, have filters on them.
17       Filters make smoking worse.  They make
18 you have deeper inhalation in the lungs, deeper
19 tumors, adenocarcinoma, and yet we live in the
20 culture they created.  It's all --
21       It's super hard to imagine that filtered
22 cigarettes are actually worse, but the 2014
23 Surgeon General says they are.
24       What is smoking?  This is the surface
25 area of the mouth, right?  That's how much surface area is in the mouth.
2       If you puff a cigar or a pipe, you get
3 some stuff in your mouth.  I guess if you smoke
4 the heck out of it, it could be bad for you,
5 but there's nothing compared to a tennis court,
6 which is the surface area of the lung, which
7 allows for that unbelievably rapid bolus of
8 complete crack -- they called it crack --
9       MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.
10       MR. SCHLESINGER:  They called it --
11       THE COURT:  Overruled.
12       MR. SCHLESINGER:  They called it crack
13 nicotine, freebased nicotine, ammoniated
14 nicotine, molecularly advanced nicotine, to
15 shoot to the brain so fast, no other way to
16 give it to you.  And that surface area of the
17 lung has no taste buds.
18       What about these -- what about these
19 descriptions:  Taste, pleasure, satisfaction,
20 enjoyment?  That's not what cigarette smoking
21 is about.  It's about, do you inhale, deeply
22 inhale.
23       And they invented inhalation, they
24 perfected inhalation.  Get those cigarettes
25 deep in the lungs, shoot that nicotine to the brain, change that brain, a chronic, relapsing
2 compulsive brain disease.  This --
3       I'm not going to go through this again,
4 but you saw the -- you saw the factory, how
5 they add the urea and the ammonia and
6 everything else.  Tobacco --
7       The tobacco industry guys, the Philip
8 Morris guys, they can bring whatever they want
9 here.  They can show you their processing
10 techniques.  They have the right to bring
11 whatever evidence they want to bring.
12       I did not see a demonstration in this
13 courtroom of what the current manufacturing --
14       MR. FURR:  Objection --
15       THE COURT:  Sustained.
16       MR. FURR:  -- Your Honor.
17       MR. SCHLESINGER:  The -- the --
18       This is very important:  They can
19 regul -- we can --
20       This is 1963:  We can regulate, fairly
21 precisely, the nicotine and sugar levels to
22 almost any desired level that management may
23 want.
24       1961, my smoker's a smoker for a long
25 time. Is there something wrong with smoking
2 when -- when, arguably, one of the most
3 beautiful women in the world is sitting at a
4 table, with her Oscar and her cigarette in her
5 holder?
6       I mean, what could be more beautiful than
7 that?  What could be more glamorous than that?
8 Is that conveying a message of -- of -- of
9 danger, talking about truth in advertising?
10       Let me keep going.  More manipulation for
11 inhalability.  Recon tobacco, vent holes,
12 additives, menthol, licorice, bronchodilators,
13 flue-curing and sugars, any one of which could
14 be changed to make this defective product --
15 which it is defective by the Engle standards --
16 safer.
17       Change the inhalation, change the -- the
18 addictiveness of it.  Make an arrangement that
19 nobody under 21 ever gets the cigarettes,
20 because all cigarette smoking --
21       Most cigarette smoking starts before 18.
22 If you don't get them by the time they're 18,
23 they don't start.  You would lose 90 percent of
24 your business, but it would still be a
25 business.  It would still be a profitable business.  But they don't do that.  They want
2 to maximize profits.
3       Play this, please.
4       (The video clip was played and taken down
5 to the best of the reporter's ability as
6 follows:)
7       VOICE:  What cigarette do you smoke?
8 You'll be interested to know how the doctors of
9 America answered that question.
10       Doctors in every branch of medicine were
11 asked:  What cigarette do you smoke?
12       VOICE:  Something wonderful happens when
13 you change to Philip Morris.  You'll feel --
14       VOICE:  Don't miss the fun of smoking,
15 don't miss the fun of smoking, mildness is a
16 pleasure...
17       VOICE:  Do you inhale?  Then you're
18 better off smoking Philip Morris.  And here's
19 how you can prove it.
20       VOICE:  Let's take a Winston break.
21       VOICE:  That's it.  Winston is the one
22 filter cigarette that delivers flavor 20 times
23 a pack.  Winston's got that filter blend.
24       VOICE:  Yeah, Fred.
25       VOICE:  I tell you, Pearl, Winstons is good smoking.  Sure wish you could taste it.
2       VOICE:  I am tasting it, Granny.
3       VOICE:  The dickens, you say.
4       (Video clip concluded.)
5       MR. SCHLESINGER:  So talk about --
6       They're making cigarette smoking look
7 safe and normal, and they're saying, something
8 wonderful happens.  They're never using the
9 truth in advertising that -- to show chronic
10 obstructive pulmonary disease.  They don't
11 advertise that.
12       They don't advertise a man in a
13 wheelchair with -- with an oxygen tank on his
14 nose.  They don't advertise, like, Glodine
15 McCoy laying in a hospital bed, having fluid --
16 bloody fluid full of cancer drawn off her lungs
17 and a chest tube in place in the throes of
18 dying from lung cancer.
19       They don't advertise the truth about
20 tobacco.  They advertise an illusion, a mass
21 illusion that has a powerful effect on
22 influencing folks and behavior and children to
23 take up the act.
24       They don't do truth in advertising.  They
25 could, but they never show ads where somebody is reaching into a dirty ashtray to pull out a
2 cigarette butt.  They don't show those, okay?
3       Now, you know, John McCoy talked about
4 she smoked the -- she smoked her favorite
5 brands, the Camels, the Philip Morris, the ads
6 were everywhere, and he thought those ads
7 definitely had an effect.
8       Play this.
9     (Thereupon, a video clip was played)
10       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Remember, this is just
11 a clip of a clip.  A lot of these videos are in
12 evidence, you may need a player to play them if
13 you want to watch the videos of the tobacco
14 people or the home movies.
15       I know watching other folks' home movies
16 isn't so interesting, but here's a clip from
17 the thing.
18       Now, look what we did.  We stopped and we
19 went up close.  And I want to show you
20 something.
21       Can I get behind you guys for one second?
22       I want to show you something.  Let me go
23 back in time.  I'm going to reach back to 1975
24 and I'm going to pull that magazine out of
25 that -- out of that film, and I'm going to bring it to you live and I'm going to show you
2 something she did see.
3       This is McCall's magazine, 1975.  This is
4 that issue, and this was chockful --
5       MR. TEPIKIAN:  Your Honor, object.  I
6 don't believe this is in evidence.
7       MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is in evidence.
8       THE COURT:  Counsel --
9       You are to rely on your own recollection
10 of what the evidence is.
11       MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's in evidence.
12       This is chockful of ads, and we -- we
13 took -- we took that extra little bit of study,
14 we checked the ad, and just as an example of
15 something that's actually in her hand, not the
16 1941 school book that Mr. Furr couldn't put in
17 his hands and that Mr. Furr didn't quote all
18 the language of, but McCall's.
19       And what was in McCall's?  One, meek but
20 not mild; Raleigh extra mild.  Two, with all
21 the talk about smoking, I decided I'd either
22 quit or smoke True.  And I smoke True.
23       Now, what does that mean?  People are
24 hearing about bad things, tobacco is marketing
25 to you and they're saying, keep on smoking because you can smoke True.  True is a
2 cigarette like a Parliament, a Kent.  It's blue
3 and white, it has the special filter.
4       These are the ads in the magazines.  She
5 was reading them.  This is in evidence.  Find
6 one word in this magazine that says smoking is
7 bad.  Except for the box warnings, find any
8 independent article in this magazine that's
9 saying that it's bad.
10       L&M, the proud smoke.  In every --
11 there's a little Eve in every woman.  To the
12 56 million people who smoke cigarettes --
13       You've got to read this.  I won't read it
14 now, but it's a whole thing about we've heard
15 some things and what are you going to do about
16 it and you're going to keep smoking, you're
17 going to keep smoking Vantage.
18       The health reassurance message.  She was
19 inundated with it, even in 1975.  The magazine
20 is in evidence.  You'll see it.
21       Newport, this is an ad they use to this
22 day.  Some of the more recent ads we put in,
23 you'll see the same ad, all young people,
24 young, fun, healthy, vibrant, they're doing
25 good, alive with pleasure. Now, truth in advertising.  Suffocated to
2 death with emphysema, died a horrible death
3 from lung cancer, died from heart disease,
4 pulmonary vascular disease, bladder cancer.
5 They never advertise the truth of what these
6 products do.  They advertise something that is
7 an illusion, that is not an accurate
8 representation.
9       Saratoga 120s for women.  The longer
10 smoking, longer enjoyment, more smoke, more
11 cigarette, more nicotine.  They're --
12       Look at this.  They're happy, they're
13 sailing, beautiful young woman, good looking
14 young man.  And the joke of the Benson & Hedges
15 used to be, it's so long, the tip would break
16 off.
17       If you had a child and the child is
18 climbing on a ladder to go in a swimming pool
19 and he's going to jump in a pool, and you know
20 the pool is empty, and the pool has a no-diving
21 sign, but the kid isn't paying attention to it
22 or -- and he's going right by it.  Do you stand
23 there and say, go ahead, go ahead, you've been
24 warned; or do you do everything you can in your
25 power to say, stop, don't do this, this is dangerous, something bad's going to come of
2 this?
3       I say that we had all these warnings, but
4 you must keep this in context.  The first
5 warning is a caution.  It may be hazardous to
6 your health, it may not be.
7       And you're going to hear, Glodine should
8 have quit.  And you know what?  We agree.
9 Glodine should have quit.  But you know what?
10 The tobacco industry should have quit, too.
11 They should have quit lying.
12       So Glodine should have quit.  She has
13 human weaknesses, human foibles.  She could
14 have tried harder, she should have tried
15 harder, that will be for your consideration;
16 but when she should have done something, so
17 should they, too.
18       But here's what's important:  In 1966,
19 Glo was smoking for 25 years, without any
20 caution, without anything on a pack.  By 1970,
21 she was a 29-year smoker.  By 1985, she had
22 been smoking for 44 years.  Remember the hook
23 story?  She was deeply addicted.
24       Look at all the things she did to try to
25 quit smoking.  Everything she could.  She listened to her family, she rebutted them, shut
2 up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut
3 up.  I counted it.  Eight times.  Eight times
4 she said "shut up."
5       Now, there's going to be an instruction,
6 sympathy does not guide your verdicts, sympathy
7 or passion or prejudice for our against any
8 party.  And I'm showing you things which are
9 reprehensible acts, they're in the nature of
10 atrocities that --
11       MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.
12       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- deserve
13 condemnation.
14       THE COURT:  Excuse me.  Why don't you
15 come sidebar for a second.
16 at
17 sidebar:)
18       THE COURT:  Yes, sir?
19       MR. TEPIKIAN:  Your Honor, he's using the
20 word "atrocities," and I move for a mistrial
21 and --
22       I move for a mistrial based upon the
23 cumulative nature of all of this.
24       THE COURT:  Thank you.  The objection's
25 noted.  It's overruled.  This is -- this is argument.  I don't have any issue with it.  If
2 he uses the word "atrocities," don't worry
3 about it.
4       Listen, I called you sidebar for one
5 thing.  I don't know where you're going and how
6 long you anticipate --
7       You've got roughly five or so minutes
8 left on your --
9       MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'm just trying to get
10 through this, Judge.
11       THE COURT:  -- on your direct --
12       MR. SCHLESINGER:  If I got to take from
13 the back end, I will, but I'm --
14       You know, these sidebars take away from
15 my time.  I don't think that's --
16       MR. TEPIKIAN:  Can I ask this?  Is there
17 anything displayed on the front of your
18 notebook that is showing to the jury?
19       MR. SCHLESINGER:  No, not at all.  It's
20 blank.
21       THE COURT:  It's a blank page.  Thank
22 you.
23       MR. SCHLESINGER:  I just --
24       I would ask the judge to consider giving
25 me an extra five minutes. THE COURT:  I'm sorry?
2       MR. SCHLESINGER:  I would ask that you
3 give me...
4      (Sidebar discussion was concluded, and the
5 following was held in open court:)
6       MR. SCHLESINGER:  So when you consider
7 the reprehensibility, deserving of censure, we
8 ask you to consider this, to condemn it.  These
9 actions by these companies are in the nature of
10 atrocities.  That's why it's reprehensible.
11 It's things that don't meet with the bounds of
12 human decency.
13       I remember Robert Fulghum wrote a book,
14 Everything I Needed to Learn in -- I Knew in
15 Kindergarten.  Be decent to people, you know?
16       So these are some things she did to try
17 to cut down.  They knew that, fortunately for
18 them, it's a habit they couldn't break.
19       This is Glo -- this is Glo and John.  And
20 I want to just --
21       You know, I want to just talk real quick.
22 You know, look, we -- we were talking about
23 "shut up," "shut up," "shut up."  They used
24 that term a lot.
25       There is an instruction saying, don't make your decision based on sympathy, don't
2 make your decision based on -- made on
3 prejudice.
4       And I want you to recognize that while
5 what we are showing you by the tobacco
6 companies is -- is bad acts, it's bad and we're
7 saying this is reprehensible, deserving of
8 censure, deserving of your condemnation and
9 merits punishment -- that's ultimately what we
10 are here for, for an expression of punishment
11 from the jury, to say in the strongest possible
12 terms, we don't want a company to act this
13 way -- that the -- the other side of the coin
14 is, no prejudice.
15       You don't act from a position of anger;
16 you act from a position of cool, calm,
17 dispassionate, deliberate jury.  This is what
18 I've seen, I analyze it, I know it's wrongful
19 conduct by human and humanity terms.  By the
20 same token, you don't apply prejudice.
21       And all in all, the -- the family is a
22 nice family, the testimony was nice.  They're
23 decent folks.
24       The worst thing I heard was, in the
25 throes of -- MR. FURR:  Objection to counsel's --
2       THE COURT:  Sustained.
3       MR. SCHLESINGER:  In the throes --
4       We heard the word "shut up."  What I'm
5 trying to say to you is this:  You're also not
6 supposed to be affected by prejudice for or
7 against a party.
8       And we don't want you to be -- have a
9 prejudice against the tobacco companies, make a
10 decision based on the facts.  We don't want you
11 to have a prejudice against our client.
12       And if you don't believe that, because
13 the word "shut up" was used, that someone's
14 trying to hurt the character of a client or say
15 she was some sort of person that said "shut up"
16 a lot, that could be prejudicial.
17       So try to set that aside and put it in
18 context with what it really means of an
19 addicted smoker in denial, in pain, trying to
20 find a place to exist and be comfortable, to --
21 to live with themselves.
22       This is -- this is the family.  We heard
23 that this was a romance story.  She was his
24 beauty, right?  He was mesmerized and smitten
25 by her. The durability of this marriage is from a
2 bygone era.  It's so hard to duplicate that in
3 this modern age, but he tried to impart that
4 lesson to his children.  You know, it was a
5 more innocent time.
6       Even the advertisements, what they knew
7 back then, you have to put yourself back in
8 that time.  Folks trusted companies.  If a
9 company said, we're going to do right by you,
10 folks believed them.
11       And, so, even John said, take me back to
12 that time.  They had a nice life.  This is his
13 favorite picture.  Remember he said, take me
14 back to the time.
15       You know, ultimately, we're going to ask
16 you for compensatory damages.  They --
17       If you could take him back to that time,
18 he wouldn't want compensatory damages.
19       MR. FURR:  Objection.
20       THE COURT:  Sustained.
21       MR. SCHLESINGER:  So --
22       MR. FURR:  Move to strike.
23       THE COURT:  Five minutes, Counsel.
24       The jury is to disregard the last
25 comment. MR. SCHLESINGER:  So here's some photos
2 of the McCoy family.  They're in evidence.
3 It's a nice family.  You can see this.
4       You know, Scott testified on how hard it
5 is on his dad, and how he was just -- she just
6 fade -- John said how he just faded away.
7 Scott said how his father aged like ten years,
8 okay?
9       She died in his arms, okay?  He said it
10 was his beautiful wife.  It was devastating,
11 okay?
12       It was disastrous to her.  And when they
13 heard that diagnosis, they -- they didn't know
14 what to do.  So it was just a horrible thing.
15       And he was stoic.  He said, you're
16 bringing it all back now, and he fought back
17 tears.  I thought that was courageous.  He was
18 stoic up there.
19       MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.
20       MR. SCHLESINGER:  And he -- and he held
21 on.
22       You know, I thought of the movie -- and
23 I'm going to do this quick -- I thought of the
24 movie "On Golden Pond."  And I've seen it.  I
25 don't know if you ever saw it, but it's -- It's Henry Fonda and Kate Hepburn, and
2 they're an elderly married couple in love, and
3 there is a scene where he gets lost going to
4 the end of the -- of the path where he lives,
5 and he comes back and he's angry because he got
6 disoriented, and he said to her -- he said to
7 her --
8       He throws down the thing, he says, I got
9 lost, I got a little confused, I didn't know
10 where I was and I came running back here
11 because I wanted to see your pretty face.
12       And Kate Hepburn, who was a great
13 actress -- I mean, and this --
14       I'm going back to his time.  You may not
15 have known her, but she was a great -- a great
16 actress.  She took his face in his [sic] hands,
17 and she looked at him and -- and she reassured
18 him, you know, that she loved him, they had
19 grown old together, and it didn't matter that
20 he was confused and getting a little -- a
21 little befuddled and a little --
22       She said to him, she goes, you are my
23 knight in shining armor.  And that was the
24 climax of the movie.  And it was a powerful
25 moment if you've ever seen the film. And that's how I think about him.  He was
2 her knight in shining armor.  They showed --
3 all the evidence in the case was of a great
4 relationship the whole time.
5       So when you decide on the damages in this
6 case, you should -- and can we get that up? --
7 you should -- you should award an amount of
8 money based on measuring the harm that has
9 occurred to John because the premature loss of
10 his wife over the last 18 years and going into
11 whatever foreseeable future they might have had
12 together.
13       He's 87.  Obviously, the future would not
14 have been that long if she had been here today
15 with him, but he's lost her for 18 years.
16       And I would suggest to you that if you
17 measure the harm, and you tell the family and
18 John, through your verdict, that we place great
19 value on your loss, that you could award as
20 much as $9 million for what he lost in the
21 past, which is a lot of money, 500,000 a year,
22 give or take; you could award three million,
23 you could determine that restorative
24 compensatory damages for the anguish, the loss,
25 are worth three million.  That would total to 12 million.
2       Let me say, I am not giving evidence, I
3 am giving a suggestion.  You may say, that's
4 too much, I want to award less.  It's
5 completely up to you.  These are intangible
6 elements of damages, of love a man had for a
7 wife.  They might not have been rich in money,
8 but they were rich in family.  And they
9 continue to be.
10       And as supportive as he -- as this family
11 is to their patriarch, they said, we're not
12 mom, and you need to be together not only for
13 the good times but for the bad times.
14       And when you lose a child to lung cancer
15 from smoking, and he was stumbling around all
16 along and -- it hurt their children to see him
17 not to have mom there to commiserate.  It's the
18 idea of a marriage and being together through
19 thick and thin, through the hard times, and it
20 means something.  And our --
21       And one of the defenses in the case was,
22 ancestors of John and Gloria [sic] died of
23 tobacco-related illnesses and that should have
24 served as a warning to them.  And now
25 children -- he's lost two children from tobacco-related illnesses, and that should
2 serve as a warning to him.
3       MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.
4       MR. SCHLESINGER:  That was the --
5       THE COURT:  The objection's noted.  It's
6 overruled.
7       Counsel, comment on the evidence.
8       MR. SCHLESINGER:  The evidence in the
9 case from -- from Mr. Furr's questioning was,
10 this -- this should serve as a warning.  And my
11 context is, perhaps they shouldn't get credit
12 for that.
13       If tobacco has caused these deaths,
14 there's an instruction, punitive damages,
15 considering harm to others.  You're going to
16 consider harm to the 20 million that have been
17 killed.  Harm to others, that's how you arrive
18 at whether this kind of conduct deserves to be
19 punished.  And so I think that's important to
20 consider.
21       He's written down the numbers.  We think
22 that when you break up --
23       Are you on comparative now?
24       MR. HAMMER:  No.
25       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.  So now, ultimately, you go to punitive damages, and I'm
2 going to go through this --
3       Oh, and what is it, the survival claim?
4       There's not going --
5       In my opinion, based on the way this case
6 went down --
7       There's a survival claim, meaning what
8 did Glor -- what did Glo suffer, what did
9 Glodine suffer in the event that she didn't die
10 from smoking, but she just suffered for many
11 years?
12       It's in the case.  It's -- it's not going
13 to be -- it's not going to be a decision you
14 make.  This is a death case.  This is a
15 wrongful death case.  There is all the
16 evidence, all the testimony.  Even on both
17 sides, wrongful death, you're not going to get
18 to this question.
19       If you do, Mr. Hammer has suggested
20 five million for what she went through since
21 the time she got sick in '91 with the heart
22 attack, for the six years until she died in
23 late '97, at the age of 70, that that should be
24 five million.
25       You're not going to get there, so please don't be confused by that.  That will not be
2 your consideration because there's no basis to
3 say she didn't die from lung cancer.  They --
4 they can't argue it to you, they don't have any
5 evidence.
6       But going on to this --
7       Can I move on?
8       MR. HAMMER:  Yes.
9       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.  You go to
10 punitives and you have to decide should these
11 companies be punished for what they did.  And
12 you may consider harms suffered by others not
13 parties to the lawsuit in assessing the
14 reprehensibility or wrongfulness of the
15 defendants' acts.
16       Remember they said, this is about Glodine
17 McCoy?  It's about Glodine McCoy and so much
18 more.  It's not just about Glodine McCoy.  It's
19 about the opening -- the major conclusion in
20 the Surgeon General's report that says that
21 20 million people have died from the tobacco
22 epidemic.
23       The century-long epidemic of cigarette
24 smoking -- this is Page 7 -- has caused an
25 enormous public health tragedy since the first Surgeon General's report in 1964.  More than
2 20 million premature deaths can be attributed
3 to cigarette smoking.
4       And who do they lay it on the feet of for
5 the first time ever in a Surgeon General's
6 report in 2014, fresh news?
7       The tobacco epidemic was initiated and
8 has been sustained by the aggressive strategies
9 of the tobacco industry which has deliberately
10 misled the public on the risks of smoking.
11       So, as far as percentages are
12 concerned --
13       Is that ready to go?  Throw that up real
14 quick.
15       As far as percentages are concerned --
16 and I'm skipping a little bit, but when you get
17 to comparative fault --
18       This is -- this is the part that's not
19 addiction; it's comparative fault.
20       Mr. McCoy is not able to see that he
21 thinks his wife did anything wrong, because he
22 thinks she's a victim as an addict.  However,
23 he is willing and we are willing to accept the
24 fair share of blame.
25       If you choose to assign any for the human weaknesses, for the "she could have tried
2 harder" elements that could be a part of this
3 case, if Glodine McCoy could have tried harder,
4 but her human weaknesses were such that she
5 didn't, you can cut up the relative degrees of
6 responsibility so that they add up to a hundred
7 percent, any way you want.
8       We recommend 30 percent for each of the
9 three defendant companies, recognizing now that
10 Lorillard has been subsumed by -- by Reynolds,
11 but because it happened just before the
12 beginning of the case, there's still three
13 defendants, 30 percent, 30 percent, 30 percent
14 against all three co-conspirators all working
15 together to conceal, and 10 percent for
16 Glodine.
17       MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.
18       MR. SCHLESINGER:  That's our
19 recommendation.
20       MR. TEPIKIAN:  We have a motion we'll
21 need to make.
22       We can make it later.  I want to reserve
23 that there is a motion to make.
24       MR. SCHLESINGER:  That's -- that's our
25 recommendation if you decide to find fault for her.
2       I would be honored and I would be in --
3       I would believe the evidence supports a
4 zero --
5       MR. FURR:  Objection.
6       THE COURT:  Sustained.
7       MR. SCHLESINGER:  I feel the evidence
8 could support --
9       MR. FURR:  Objection.
10       THE COURT:  Sustained.
11       MR. SCHLESINGER:  The evidence --
12       THE COURT:  No personal beliefs.
13       MR. SCHLESINGER:  You may decide that the
14 evidence supports a finding of zero for
15 Glodine -- Glodine McCoy, or you may decide the
16 evidence supports a finding for Glodine McCoy
17 of 25 percent, or 35 percent, or 45 percent, or
18 55 percent.
19       You can do whatever you want.  All I did
20 was make a recommendation.  The defendants will
21 say it should be a hundred percent.  So you get
22 the final decision.  All we do is make this
23 recommendation.
24       Now, can I go to the clicker -- go to the
25 clicker, please?  So here's what we've got. Where is that?
2       Okay.  In terms of harm to others --
3       I'm going to do this quick.  It's hard to
4 think about 20 million deaths.  One death is a
5 tragedy, it makes the evening news.  Every time
6 we put on the evening news, we see terrible
7 things happening, our heart goes out to folks,
8 and we read about it, we learn about it, we
9 understand it because it's something happening
10 to a person, a few people, we see it.
11       Twenty million is so big, it's
12 unimaginable.  So I use this to say --
13       MR. FURR:  Objection.
14       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- the numbers numb.
15 The numbers numb.  You see the numbers are
16 huge, but they actually numb.
17       MR. FURR:  Objection.
18       MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is the State --
19       THE COURT:  Overruled.
20       MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is the State of
21 Florida.  There are 20 million people living in
22 the State of Florida.  Take a minute to put in
23 context these large numbers.
24       What if there was nobody in Florida?
25 That's how many people 20 million people are. MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.
2       MR. SCHLESINGER:  That's how many
3 people --
4       THE COURT:  Overruled.
5       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- twenty million
6 people are.
7       I say that America has been used as this
8 industry's ashtray.
9       MR. FURR:  Objection.
10       THE COURT:  Sustained.
11       MR. SCHLESINGER:  They stub out --
12       This is about truth and consequences.
13 And I will tell you what I mean by that.
14       When you engineer your product to cause
15 addiction, there will be consequences.  This is
16 about telling the truth and the consequences
17 the tobacco industry needs to face.
18       When you target children, there will be
19 consequences.  When you lie to the American
20 public, there will be consequences.  When you
21 offer up false solutions such as filters and
22 lights, which do nothing, there will be
23 consequences.  When you commit fraud, there
24 will be consequences.
25       This is about the truth and how they need to tell it, and this is about the consequences
2 and how they need to face them.
3       I talked to you about Surgeon General
4 2014.  That's right on the page, Page 7.  All
5 the -- all the conclusions, we can skip that.
6       You stand at a moment in history.  I
7 mean, you know, more people have climbed Mount
8 Everest --
9       MR. TEPIKIAN:  There is no evidence of
10 this, Your Honor.
11       THE COURT:  Sustained.
12       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Dr. Proctor testified
13 on cross-examination with Mr. Furr about the
14 website, where on the website it says that --
15       Oh, yeah, on the website, it said that
16 what people should do if they're concerned
17 about smoking is quit; nobody under smoking --
18 nobody under 18 should pick up smoking; and
19 children should never smoke; and if you're not
20 a smoker, you shouldn't start.  So if
21 they're --
22       My question is, what business are they
23 in?  If nobody that smoked should start, if
24 children should never start, if this was really
25 true and sincere and everyone who is smoking should quit, it begs the question, what kind of
2 business are they in?
3       Forty million Americans caught in a web
4 of tobacco dependence.  That's Page 5, Surgeon
5 General's report, in evidence.  Glodine was one
6 of them.
7       Here, how about this?  All those
8 brilliant guys -- Claude Teague -- all those
9 scientists, all those researchers, how about if
10 you were curing cancer instead of causing it,
11 you know?
12       And if you have a -- a corporation here
13 that's described as the rights of an
14 individual, I say, very simply, if you are
15 going to be accorded the rights of an
16 individual, you also are faced to meet the
17 burdens of a responsibility of an individual.
18 If you want to be treated like a person, you
19 have to act like a person.  You have to be
20 human.
21       And in what they did, this tobacco
22 company, with the rights of a human, you can
23 find have not acted as being humane.  And that
24 is reprehensible and it justifies punitive
25 damages. Clear and convincing evidence, you should
2 have lacking in confusion, because punitives
3 require more than the preponderance that I
4 showed you.  Punitives require more.  You
5 should not be confused, you should be able to
6 get it, you -- all --
7       And those internal documents, those are
8 damning, those really show we've got the goods
9 on them.
10       So there should be no confusion about the
11 confusion.  There should be no confusion about
12 the confusion.  There's no doubt about the
13 doubt.  They had a confusion campaign, they
14 have it even to this day, according to
15 Dr. Prochaska.  You should protect children.
16 You should not addict them, okay?
17       Even in the '20s, they were getting after
18 prep school kids.  There's Glodine McCoy.  She
19 was a replacement smoker for her parents that
20 died preceding her.  And will her children be
21 replacement smokers for her?
22       We knew from Philip Morris that teenagers
23 were the rapid growing area in tomorrow's
24 success and tomorrow's customers, the base of
25 the business is the high school student, and these are 14 to 24, 12-year-olds.
2       And this is one I must read to you.  We
3 have --
4       This is from Claude Teague, on the youth
5 market, where he says:  We must capture our
6 share of the youth market.  We have
7 deliberately played down the role of nicotine,
8 hence the nonsmoker has little or no knowledge
9 of what satisfactions it may offer him, and no
10 desire to try it.  Instead, we must somehow
11 convince him, with wholly irrational reasons,
12 that he should try smoking in the hope that he
13 will for himself then discover the real
14 satisfactions obtainable.
15       That is cold-blooded.  It's connecting to
16 kids and targeting them and addicting them.
17       And here's where they're talking about
18 12-year-olds and the younger smokers are the
19 only source of replacement smokers.  And you
20 see how they throw that word "adult" in there?
21       Remember the saying, only the guilty flee
22 when no man pursueth?  Remember the art -- the
23 Pittman article, it's in evidence from 1975, we
24 are going to use -- we've used references to
25 "young smokers" and the "youth market," from now on, put that word "young adult" in there.
2       Why was that?  Because this is so
3 incendiary that, even though it's secret, the
4 fear of it getting out, hopefully that would
5 give some cover.
6       Character is how you act when you think
7 nobody is looking.  And if they want to be
8 judged as humans, they should act with human
9 decency, they should be afforded the rights of
10 humans and the responsibilities, and this
11 corporation did not.  And when you decide on
12 punishment, it's, in part, to deter other
13 companies from doing this kind of thing.
14       In here, it's very clear that if you
15 don't get smokers before 18, you don't get
16 smokers.  The Joe Camel cartoon ads, you heard
17 about that, as young as you could get, internal
18 documents.
19       The proof is in the pudding.  These
20 folks -- these folks created a business model,
21 a strategy, it was brilliantly conceived,
22 masterfully executed.
23       My client was caught up in it, as
24 millions of others were, and they -- and -- and
25 she went down the -- the river of that business, a roaring river of cash and profits,
2 until she died.
3       They talked about a crop of prospects in
4 1964, saying the youth haven't picked it up,
5 but they're going to pick it up because the
6 backlog will join with the crop of prospects to
7 produce a healthy increase in the number of new
8 smokers, referring to themselves as healthy.
9       And so what do you do with a crop?  You
10 reap it.  This is Van Gogh.  So what do you do
11 with a crop?  You grow it, you reap it.
12       Just like they talked about rats in a
13 cage, they also refer to their customers as a
14 crop, like a commodity, like we're growing
15 smokers, children.  All tobacco use begins in
16 childhood and adolescence.  If you don't smoke
17 by the time you're 18, most will never take up
18 smoking.
19       And how about this?  This is from the
20 '60s.  And is this a popular business plan?
21       We are thus devoting our business lives
22 to the propagation of lung cancer.  Cigarettes
23 have certain unattractive side effects:  Lung
24 cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and
25 emphysema.  This is in the '60s. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we produced a
2 cancer-free cigarette?  They told the public,
3 let the scientists do the worrying and you go
4 on smoking.
5       Now, the Frank Statement, which we have
6 here, but I'll just do it this way:  Let's look
7 at the promises of this Frank Statement, 1953,
8 promises by the defendant.
9       They said:  We accept an interest in
10 people's health as a basic responsibility
11 paramount to every other consideration in the
12 business.
13       And what does it say in their internal
14 document?  "Who ain't for more money?"
15       So, really, that was the motive.  You
16 could find that was the profit motive, over the
17 lives of people, over children, over the health
18 of the customers, over the health of -- of
19 Americans.
20       We have always and will always cooperate
21 closely with those whose task it is to
22 safeguard the public health.  This is the
23 promise in every newspaper in the country in
24 1953, during the cancer scare, to still quiet
25 fears. And what do they say they're going to do
2 to Wynder and others?  They're going to smear
3 them and belittle them.
4       And we're going to try to smear them.
5 And didn't they do that?  They said they would
6 put out there all kinds of comments that the
7 Surgeon General --
8       They didn't agree with him.  And they
9 even have --
10       I think they had an expert here today
11 that said, I don't agree with the Surgeon
12 General.
13       Now, here, critics have held it
14 responsible for all diseases, for years and
15 years.  One by one, these charges are abandoned
16 for lack of evidence.
17       And what do they say in a document in
18 '53, Claude Teague:  Obviously, the amount of
19 evidence accumulated to indict cigarette
20 smoking as a health hazard is overwhelming.
21 The evidence challenging such an indictment is
22 scant.
23       Here's what they promised in this Frank
24 Statement at the beginning of the conspiracy,
25 when my client had been smoking for 13 years and was already in her 20s:  We will put in
2 charge of this research activity -- this
3 supposed independent research activity -- a man
4 of unimpeachable integrity and national repute.
5       And the guy was on the payroll because it
6 was set up as an industry shield and a front.
7       And what do they say?  Let's face it,
8 we're interested in evidence which we believe
9 denies the allegation that cigarette smoking
10 causes disease.
11       And a promise is a promise.  Could
12 Glodine McCoy rely on this?  If our product is
13 proven to be harmful, we'll stop making it.
14 And that was 11 examples of that from major
15 executives from the cooperation telling the
16 public, we would never make a bad product,
17 we'll stop making it.
18       In this case, when you come to the clear
19 and convincing evidence standard that these
20 folks do -- do richly deserve your censure,
21 richly deserve for you to exact a penalty and
22 punish them and say in the strongest possible
23 terms, we don't want you to do this, you will
24 see there's no doubt about the doubt campaign,
25 okay? They said it themselves, a brilliantly
2 conceived holding -- holding strategy, creating
3 doubt.  And they employed it on a single -- a
4 single strategy to defend itself on major
5 fronts:  Litigation, politics, and public
6 opinion.
7       And what Dr. Proctor says, that was the
8 whole point.  They were making a product that
9 could cause harm, and they were worried that
10 this could bite them in court, and that that
11 was one of the essential pillars of the
12 conspiracy, the man who knows the most, who
13 dedicated years, decades to studying hundreds
14 of thousands of those internal documents.
15       And what do they say they would do when
16 they got information that could show nicotine
17 was addictive?  They bury it.  They did not
18 disclose the information.
19       I'm not going to play this.  I'm not
20 going to play this.  You saw this.
21       The chief executive officers of the major
22 tobacco companies standing up in front of
23 Congress -- you've seen it twice -- and lying,
24 in 1980 -- 1994.  And that is not corporate
25 conduct that is acceptable, it doesn't meet the bounds of human decency, and it costs lives.
2 Lies cost lives.
3       They control the future.  That's the lung
4 cancer and the -- and the product usage line.
5 The yellow one is cigarette smoking going up to
6 600 billion a year.  The red one is the -- the
7 amount of lung cancer, because there was a
8 20-year lag time.  They controlled the future.
9       How different would it have been if they
10 had come clean?  What would have happened?  How
11 would the future have been different?  How
12 would those lines have changed?
13       How would there have been a plummeting of
14 lung cancer and diseases and death if they had
15 said, we're not going to make it inhalable,
16 we're going to lower the nicotine, we're going
17 to take out the sugars, we're not going to lie
18 to the public, we're going to give truth in
19 advertising, we're going to tell you it kills
20 you?
21       We live in the culture they created.  And
22 this -- it's relevant today, it bears
23 continuing examination and scrutiny.
24       And the last slide.
25       And that's why we're here.  The epitaph on the -- on the gravestone that he visits
2 every single week and makes sure that the
3 flowers are fresh, and to keep her memory
4 alive.
5       She is gone and not forgotten, and that
6 is why we are here and that is who we want you
7 to think about in this case.
8       Where's the check mark for punies?  Did I
9 get everything?
10       MR. HAMMER:  Just go through --
11       MR. SCHLESINGER:  This?
12       MR. HAMMER:  Show them that.
13       MR. SCHLESINGER:  So after we talked
14 about the money, which is --
15       It's your decision.  I make a
16 recommendation.  I could have recommended an
17 amount that doesn't meet with what you want.
18 It's up to you.  But, ultimately --
19       Because you remember Mr. Furr said, this
20 is only about Glodine McCoy, not others, but
21 it's about harm to others.  He said it's about
22 Glodine McCoy.  And every question is about
23 Glodine McCoy.
24       This is the question about them.  This is
25 why you saw this evidence.  It's about them, and does this industry -- has it done indecent
2 things to the American public and Glo McCoy.
3       And it says here:  Please state for each
4 defendant below, who you answered Question --
5 "yes" on Questions 6 and 7 that -- that
6 reliance, the false statements, were a
7 contributing cause to her not being able to get
8 off those cigarettes, to fool her and reassure
9 her, whether you find by clear and convincing
10 evidence that punitive damages are warranted
11 against any of the defendants listed below.
12       And there's a check mark, "yes" or "no,"
13 for each of the three defendants in here; and
14 we propose and submit that the right verdict
15 and the verdict that will be the most important
16 part of this case is to work your way through
17 this path to the punishment damages, and check
18 off "yes" for each of these -- each of these
19 defendants.  And when you do --
20       Because you can take as long as you want
21 to, to deliberate this case.  It could be a
22 day, tomorrow.  We're going to be on your time.
23       It's very interesting, you guys wait for
24 us; we're going to turn this over and then
25 we're on your time. But if you say "yes" and we have a
2 punitive damages phase, there's a short phase,
3 a brief phase, it could take as little as a
4 day, and then we submit to you --
5       MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.
6       THE COURT:  Sustained.
7       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- a single question --
8       We submit to you a question as to what is
9 the amount of the penalty that you will exact
10 against the defendants who you found deserve
11 that penalty.
12       On behalf of my clients, on behalf of the
13 family, I thank you.


22           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Can I have the easel, 
23 Judge?  
24           Can you put the Engle finding up on the 
25 board, Danny, and we'll get started? Can't do it?  
2           MR. TEPIKIAN:  There's lower ones, 
3 Danny.  
4           MR. SCHLESINGER:  There you go.  That's 
5 why I didn't do it because I would fall over it 
6 like Chevy Chase, okay, in Saturday Night.
7           All right.  May I start, Judge?  
8           THE COURT:  Please.  
9           MR. SCHLESINGER:  All right.  Thanks, 
10 folks.  
11           All right.  So my time is short, and 
12 this is rebuttal, last word.  So you know, first 
13 thing I want to touch base with you on is this -- 
14 is the thing -- put that on too, okay?  
15           VIDEO TECHNICIAN:  It's on.  
16           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Is it on?  Where is 
17 it?  Nothing.  
18           VIDEO TECHNICIAN:  Nothing?  
19           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Right here:  Reynolds 
20 and Philip Morris concealed or omitted material 
21 information not otherwise known or available.  
22           You can't say that my client knows 
23 something when the fraud count -- remember, they 
24 have been found guilty of fraud and conspiracy in 
25 the Engle case. They can't talk about those internal 
2 documents.  They can't talk about what they did.
3           MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.  
4 It's a misstatement.  
5           THE COURT:  Sustained.  
6           MR. SCHLESINGER:  They did not talk 
7 about the documents, and they are prohibited from 
8 denying what's in the documents.  
9           MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.  
10 It's a misstatement.  
11           THE COURT:  Overruled.  
12           MR. SCHLESINGER:  They are prohibited 
13 from taking exception.  What is not otherwise 
14 known or available means my client could not 
15 possibly know.  Neither could John.  Neither could 
16 Harry Reasoner nor Hammond because in the '60s 
17 they internally knew -- 
18           MR. FURR:  Objection.
19           MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- moreover nicotine 
20 is addictive.
21           MR. FURR:  I'm sorry.  It's improper 
22 argument.  
23           THE COURT:  Overruled.  
24           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Moreover, nicotine is 
25 addictive.  Remember that's that internal Battelle Hippo document you'll see?  
2           They didn't know it was addictive.  They 
3 didn't know all the things that tobacco was 
4 concealing.  
5           So so many unwitting, duped public 
6 health officials, newscasters were saying things, 
7 but that secret of addiction they knew so well, 
8 that they developed so well, that it was the sine 
9 qua non, without which there is nothing, was 
10 unknown to all those people.  
11           So here is what you heard:  Personal 
12 responsibility, personal responsibility, personal 
13 responsibility, and choice.  
14           You will not see that word on the 
15 verdict form.  You will not see that word in the 
16 Engle findings.  
17           You will not see that word anywhere in 
18 any of the jury instructions, but we say:  Yes, 
19 obviously personal responsibility plays a role.  
20 You have to decide whether a human being and their 
21 personal weaknesses or their lack of diligence, 
22 that could have been greater.  She tried so many 
23 times; she could have tried more.  
24           You can consider that, but do you know 
25 who else has responsibility?  And I don't mean to yell.  Corporations.  They have corporate 
2 responsibility.  
3           So if you have personal responsibility 
4 for a person, a corporation has personal 
5 responsibility to talk about what they did.  
6           Does the clicker work, Danny?  
7           VIDEO TECHNICIAN:  Yes.
8           MR. SCHLESINGER:  So now let me show you 
9 something else.  This is something I saved real 
10 quick because I want you to know -- you've got to 
11 blow it up, bro.  
12           Thanks.  
13           Okay.  Remember we talked about lung 
14 cancer?  There's a question on here you have to 
15 touch on about:  Did the lung cancer cause her 
16 death, and did it manifest before November 21, 
17 '96?  
18           That's the only manifestation question 
19 you have, and, remember, they started saying:  We 
20 didn't prove that PVD and heart disease was caused 
21 by smoking.  
22           They argued in the entire case that 
23 heart disease and PVD were caused by smoking.  Now 
24 they're saying that we didn't prove it. 
25           Altschuler said, in no uncertain terms, it was caused.  Here's what really interesting.  
2 Add this to my pile of evidence.  This is 
3 Dr. Sridhar, the world's big -- the hot shot 
4 pulmonary pathologist who was at the University of 
5 Miami.
6           MR. FURR:  Objection.  
7           THE COURT:  Sustained.  
8           MR. SCHLESINGER:  There's evidence that 
9 Sridhar was a well-known pulmonary pathologist.  
10 There's testimony to that effect.  A pulmonary 
11 doctor -- sorry, a pulmonary oncologist, testimony 
12 to that effect.  
13           Look right there.  This is his record, 
14 March 25th, 1997.  Diagnosis:  Microscopic 
15 squamous cell cancer.  History -- History of 
16 Present Illness.  
17           Remember we asked in other records:  How 
18 do you do define that acronym, History of Present 
19 Illness?  The month, day, year.  Symptom onset:  
20 October of 1996.  Pain in the left shoulder.  Saw 
21 the chiropractor.  Saw an x-ray.  It's abnormal.  
22 Went to Dr. Labi.  
23           Okay.  That's an additional evidence.  I 
24 saved it.  I wanted to see if anybody else would 
25 bring it up or anything. I showed you the scales, and the fact of 
2 the matter is that's a huge piece of evidence that 
3 shows before 1996.  That doesn't even say a month 
4 before.  That says October '96, History of Present 
5 Illness, symptom of onset:  October '96.  
6           That is manifestation before November 
7 21, '96, of the symptoms, of the lung cancer, 
8 absolutely.  
9           PVD, 100 percent caused by cigarette 
10 smoking.  All the testimony swore to it.  Mannino 
11 swore to it.  Altschuler swore to it.  During 
12 Dr. Prochaska's -- 
13           MR. FURR:  Excuse me.  Objection.  May 
14 we approach, Your Honor?  
15           THE COURT:  Yes.  
16           MR. FURR:  Take it down, please.  
17     
18 sidebar:) 
19           THE COURT:  Yes, sir.  
20           MR. FURR:  They didn't show us any of 
21 these things.  
22           THE COURT:  They didn't show you the 
23 slide?  
24           MR. SCHLESINGER:  All it is is 
25 testimony, that you said I could show the other person the testimony.  
2           THE COURT:  Excuse me.  Keep it down.  
3           MR. SCHLESINGER:  First of all, the 
4 medical record is a record in evidence.  It's not 
5 a special board.  
6           Second of all, this next slide is 
7 Sridhar's testimony when they misquoted that she 
8 wasn't hooked.  
9           This is the full quote from the page, 
10 and all it is is direct out of the record.  I 
11 pulled it just now because you said I could show 
12 it.
13           THE COURT:  And I said show it to them.  
14 So if you have it, give it to them.  
15           (The sidebar discussion was concluded 
16 and the following was held in open court:) 
17           THE COURT:  Mr. Schlesinger, Counsel, 
18 you may proceed.  Give them a copy of the slide, 
19 please.  
20           Thank you.  Go ahead, sir.
21           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Put it up.  Put it up.  
22           Okay.  What did she say about, was 
23 the -- she said in other testimony:  By the time 
24 you smoke a pack a day, you're hooked.  
25           The Surgeon General's report chapter on nicotine addiction, Page 105, it's all about 
2 nicotine addiction.  That's all this is about.  
3           And she said:  Isn't it true the 
4 earliest you can state that Mrs. McCoy was, in 
5 your opinion, addicted to the nicotine in the 
6 early '60s?  
7           When I say "hooked," I mean you're 
8 caught on that hook, on that fisher, on that line, 
9 and you're being reeled in by the tobacco industry 
10 over time.  Can I say she was addicted by that 
11 time?  No, I can't say for certainty, but she's 
12 got -- they've got that hook into her, and she's 
13 pulled toward and she's tried -- she's doing 
14 different brands and she's trying different 
15 things, and she continues to maintain that use of 
16 nicotine in cigarettes, Parliament, Philip Morris 
17 brand, Kent, Reynolds' brand, Camel.  Kent was 
18 Lorillard, now Reynolds.  Camel.  We gave you 
19 tobacco addiction.  
20           They didn't address that, did they?  An 
21 independent doctor who testified to -- who put a 
22 medical record back in the late '80s that said 
23 tobacco addiction.  
24           Dr. Agharkar, here's an interesting 
25 question, he was asked straight-up by Mr. Furr:  What do you work on, Dr. Agharkar?  
2           And he says:  Alcohol, marijuana, 
3 cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine.  Those are broad 
4 classes, but I think that covers them.
5           And then Mr. Furr had to remind him:  
6 And nicotine, because on his own, he didn't know 
7 he had anything to do with the nicotine because he 
8 doesn't have anything to do with because he 
9 doesn't have any qualifications in nicotine.  
10           And they're quoting to Prochaska for 
11 you?  We brought you a world-class expert.  She 
12 testified that our poor gal was terribly addicted, 
13 and she emphasized that repeatedly.  
14           Same thing with Dr. Klein who --
15           MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.  
16 We don't have this.  We don't it -- I don't 
17 believe we have any of these slides.  
18           MR. SCHLESINGER:  These are just -- this 
19 is testimony from the record that you have that 
20 we're just responding to.  All this is is 
21 testimony.  
22           Can I just rip through it real quick, 
23 Judge?  
24           THE COURT:  Yes, sir.  Go ahead.  
25           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thank you. Anyway, so Dr. Klein agreed she died of 
2 lung cancer, smoking cigarettes caused the lung 
3 cancer, and smoking cigarettes caused the death 
4 and but for the -- but for the lung cancer, she 
5 wouldn't have died.  Lung cancer doesn't develop 
6 overnight.
7           Dr. Sridhar, a world class guy, he's the 
8 one that said October '96 was the onset of the 
9 symptoms.  That's in the record.  
10           There's a lengthy record when she was on 
11 death's door, and they confirmed that her onset of 
12 cancer symptoms began in October in the class 
13 period.  
14           Our lung cancer evidence is filled up 
15 now with that excerpt of March 25th, '97, history 
16 of onset.  You never saw that before.  
17           Now this is the website where they asked 
18 about:  If you don't smoke, you shouldn't start.  
19 Kids shouldn't smoke, and everyone who smokes 
20 should quit.  
21           And it begs the question, what business 
22 are they in?  If they're sincere, what kind of 
23 business is that to be in?
24           This is the ads from Glamour Magazine 
25 today.  Remember Dr. Prochaska said they're still not disclosing their funding interest when they 
2 come to the nicotine conferences on nicotine?  
3           These are the ads today.  American 
4 spirit, 100 percent additive-free.  I mean look 
5 how glamorous these ads are.  
6           Isn't that a health reassurance message?  
7 It's 100 percent tobacco, organic tobacco.  That's 
8 in recent magazines with young people on the 
9 cover.  Inspiration, where a moment becomes a 
10 memory.  Discover the unexpected.  This is in 
11 evidence.  Taste it all.  Moments, imagination, 
12 discovery.  
13           Yeah, there's a warning down there, but 
14 look what the major -- the major demonstration is. 
15           What didn't Glo know?  These are the 
16 things that she did not know.  She didn't know any 
17 of these things.  That's the concealment.  
18           Was it a cause?  Did the filter fraud 
19 contribute?  Did the lights fraud contribute?  Was 
20 it something that was operation stumbling block 
21 and undermines the smoker?  Of course it was.  Of 
22 course it was.  So you can consider all of those 
23 things.  
24           Similarly, on Page 871, these are not 
25 inherently dangerous products.  Cigarettes aren't natural growing from trees.  They are defective by 
2 design.  
3           It has been stated that a cigarette is 
4 also a defective product, meaning not just 
5 dangerous but unreasonably dangerous, killing over 
6 half of its long-time users and addictive by 
7 design, Page 871.  
8           And that's one of the findings of the 
9 Engle findings that had to be proved, and they say 
10 that cigarettes can't be made safe.  Sure, they 
11 can.  Take out the sugar.  Take out the 
12 inhalability.  Lower the pH.  Go back to mouth 
13 puffing. 
14           No one is supposed to be sucking smoke 
15 deep into their lungs.  That's unnatural.  If 
16 ancient man around the campfire leans over and 
17 sucks in smoke from a campfire, what's he going to 
18 do?
19           He's going to choke and cough.  The body 
20 is going to respond to it.  You're not supposed to 
21 engineer cigarettes to inhale them in the lungs to 
22 deliver a drug.  
23           And what does it say on little Page 3 on 
24 SG '10 in evidence?  It says:  The way tobacco is 
25 grown, mixed, processed today has made cigarettes more addictive than ever before.
2           And I read to you from Surgeon General 
3 '14:  More addictive than ever before, more 
4 dangerous than ever before because of the relative 
5 risk, and --
6           MR. TEPIKIAN:  Your Honor, is there -- 
7 is this the time?  
8           THE COURT:  Thank you, Counsel. 
9           Mr. Schlesinger, you've got two minutes.
10           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.  Thank you.  
11           I'll tell you something else.  They 
12 showed you these warnings, and we've got packs of 
13 cigarettes, and our pack of cigarettes -- I need a 
14 pack.  
15           The warnings aren't quite this big.  
16 Okay.  And they're the warnings they want to show 
17 you every single time.  
18           Now think about the logic of this.  If 
19 that defense is correct, if that defense is 
20 correct, every single smoker who would ever claim 
21 to be an Engle class member would always have to 
22 contend with:  But there were warnings on the 
23 pack.  
24           Every single smoker who got sick or who 
25 was in a family would have to contend with the arguments that family members have said:  Stop 
2 smoking.  
3           It's the -- it's the definition of 
4 addiction that drives this.  It's smoking despite 
5 knowing it's bad for you that contributes to this. 
6           I'll tell you what, if every time 
7 somebody went and bought a pack of cigarettes, 
8 when you bought the cigarettes, if it came with 
9 this warning this big and this is what you had to 
10 leave the 7-Eleven with, that might start making a 
11 different impression if this is the kind of 
12 thing -- 
13           MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.
14           MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- they handed out 
15 every single time.
16           MR. TEPIKIAN:  Preemption.  
17           THE COURT:  Overruled.  
18           MR. SCHLESINGER:  But instead, you get a 
19 pack of cigarettes that, in Camel, they so 
20 cleverly advertise it with the cellophane on it, 
21 and the very light gray, depending on the --
22           MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.
23           MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- on the -- on the 
24 light reflection --
25           THE COURT:  Excuse me, Counsel. 1           MR. FURR:  Preemption.  
2           THE COURT:  Sustained.  
3           Let's go, Counsel.  You need to wrap it 
4 up.
5           MR. SCHLESINGER:  All right.  Yes, sir.  
6 Okay.  And that's what I'll do.  
7           This is the last two things I want to 
8 show you.  These are internal documents in 
9 evidence where it said:  Our medical and 
10 scientific witnesses will say whatever we want 
11 them to say, clearly implying, if not stating, 
12 that they lacked credibility and integrity.  
13           This is from their secret files from 
14 1982:  Our medical and scientific witnesses will 
15 say whatever we want them to say clearly implying, 
16 if not stating, that they lacked credibility and 
17 integrity.  
18           And here's another one:  Lest some 
19 lawyer be looking over our shoulder, I do not 
20 concede that even one person dies of a chronic 
21 disease that is caused by cigarette smoking.  
22           You know what they all said.  I'm not 
23 going to play it again, but those men as late as 
24 1994 were still lying to Congress and denying the 
25 harms and denying nicotine was addictive. And Dr. -- 
2           MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  
3 Time.  
4           THE COURT:  Counsel, you need to wrap it 
5 up.  
6           MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'm out of time, 
7 folks.  You all have been super attentive.  I 
8 appreciate it.  I hope that we stitched this the 
9 way -- stitched this together in a way that you 
10 can understand it.  
11           The last thing, I hope we've stitched it 
12 together for you in a way that you can understand 
13 it, that you can see things as they are.  
14           I said that to you in opening, is 
15 wide-eyed and seeing things as they are, 
16 understanding the world we're in.  
17           We did ask for an amount of money.  I 
18 said it's up to you to make that discretion, but 
19 here's one thing you didn't hear:  How much money 
20 for compensation for the loss of a beautiful wife 
21 and a 50-year marriage, how much money did any of 
22 the defendants recommend to you would be fair?  
23 Did they suggest an amount?  Did they say what 
24 they think would be fair?  
25           MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor. 1           THE COURT:  Sustained.  
2           MR. SCHLESINGER:  They did not.  
3           THE COURT:  Counsel, you need to wrap it 
4 up.  
5           MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'm done.  Thank you.
6           MR. TEPIKIAN:  Your Honor, can we 
7 approach briefly?  
8     
9 sidebar:) 
10           THE COURT:  Thank you.  Yes.  
11           MR. TEPIKIAN:  Your Honor, we would ask 
12 that this instruction, we would ask it be read 
13 based upon the closing, the rebuttal 
14 Mr. Schlesinger just gave.  He talked about how 
15 large -- 
16           THE COURT:  We need to excuse one juror 
17 though.  Okay?  
18           You want to be heard?  
19           MR. SCHLESINGER:  I absolutely do.  
20 Judge, I cut out about 15 slides that were in 
21 evidence from Dr. Proctor, testimony in evidence 
22 because they said be careful.  
23           I asked for clarification.  I didn't say 
24 a word about warnings on the front end, but 
25 Mr. Furr went into it extensively, and I didn't say there was anything wrong with the language. 
2           All I talked about was the 
3 noticeability, the size and the noticeability.  
4 FTC says people don't notice them.  He said they 
5 ignore them.  
6           I didn't say the language wasn't good 
7 enough.  I didn't tread on any of that.  I said 
8 virtually nothing -- 
9           THE COURT:  What you said was about the 
10 size of it, and I thought the warnings are 
11 regulated as to the size.  
12           MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'm sorry, Judge.  
13 Regardless of the size, the size of the board they 
14 used -- 
15           THE COURT:  Let's go.  Thank you.  
16           (The sidebar discussion was concluded 
17 and the following was held in open court:)
