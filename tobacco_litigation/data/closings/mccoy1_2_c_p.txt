25 May it please the Court, Counsel, John, good morning.
2              Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, good
3        morning.  Thank you.
4              JURORS:  Good morning.
5 So I told you at the
6        first closing argument in this multiphase trial
7        that sometimes the case takes a really long
8        time in that first phase, because we don't know
9        how much evidence you need.
10              So we put on evidence, and we try to
11        gauge how much is enough.  And except for
12        voir dire -- which you remember, which is the
13        "to see and to say," it's French, "to see and
14        to say" -- except for that going back and forth
15        between you all, we don't really get to hear
16        what you have to say.
17              And so one of the notes that I guess the
18        judge doesn't really expect you to send out is,
19        okay, we've heard enough, stop, we got it.
20        Okay.  So we don't know how much you want.
21              And then to the second phase, we don't
22        know how much you want either, so I put on a
23        lot less evidence.  And I had Proctor sitting
24        out there in the hall.  We just couldn't get
25        him on the witness stand.  But I think you know enough, and we have -- I went back to what
2        Proctor said early in this trial about industry
3        misconduct.  So hopefully, you know, that will
4        be enough for you guys to consider how to go
5        about this particular phase, which is
6        punishment.
7              Now, this is punishment phase, and the
8        only thing that this has to do with is exacting
9        a fine and arriving at an amount of punishment
10        damages, penalty damages.
11              It's not where it's going to, it's where
12        it's coming from.  It's coming from the
13        entities that you found in Phase I in your
14        verdict through clear and convincing evidence
15        warranted punitive damages.  A fine.  It's a
16        penalty.  It's not -- it's supposed to hurt.
17        They're not supposed to like it.
18              But you've made that determination, and
19        you will see that the only decision you're
20        ultimately going to make now is what is an
21        appropriate penalty to inflict upon this
22        industry for many, many years of long-standing
23        intentional misconduct resulting in the death
24        of many people, including my client, using
25        tactics of deceit, using tactics that overwhelmingly put profits ahead of human lives
2        in a way that's different than any other
3        industry.
4              And one of the things that the
5        instructions tell you is not only are you here
6        to punish someone for wrongdoing, someone who
7        richly deserves it.  And while they were not
8        just to the McCoy family, they were not just to
9        them, you will be just to them in your verdict.
10              This is not something that we are asking
11        you to do because you want to do it or because
12        you hold hatred or contempt in your heart.
13              To the contrary, His Honor says don't
14        make the decision because of passion.  And so
15        we want you to be cool, calm, deliberative, and
16        you're not doing it because you want to do it.
17        You're doing it because it's the right thing to
18        do.
19              And we'll take you through some of the
20        evidence.  But it's a broad overview.  One of
21        the things we hear about -- instructions in
22        this case is, the defendants can come forward
23        and they can have some mitigation evidence.
24              "Mitigation" means to lessen, or to show
25        some excuse for why they acted the way they acted.
2              Or in the case of a criminal case in a
3        sentencing phase, somebody may show insanity or
4        that they were brought up and abused as
5        children, and there's an extenuating
6        circumstance to justify lessening the penalty.
7        You can consider that if you think you heard
8        such evidence yesterday.  I will submit, well,
9        I don't think you did.
10              But you're going to see this jury
11        instruct -- this -- this verdict form.  It
12        doesn't have my client's name on it, but the
13        damages pertain to the wrongfulness in this
14        case.  As you heard, there are 3100 cases
15        pending across the state.
16              And there's a saying from The Hobbitt
17        that even the littlest person can change the
18        course of history.
19              So what you can do here today is respect
20        the process, determine what a reasonable fine
21        is, what a proper penalty is for wrongdoing,
22        arrive at that amount, and speak to them
23        through your verdict in the strongest possible
24        terms saying:  We do not want you to do this
25        again. You individually may not be able to
2        effectuate the change.  But like I'd like to
3        say is, you all can throw another rope across
4        Gulliver's chest.  And the work you do with
5        many other juries may prod change.
6              Let's talk about some of the things that
7        need to be done and should be done in this
8        particular case.
9              The Phase I jury instructions, we will
10        very quickly show you, that you are assessing
11        this as a punishment.  This is punitive.  It's
12        somewhere in between a civil wrong and a
13        full-on criminal wrong.  It's in the middle.
14              It's been described as a quasi criminal
15        event to wrongfully and intentionally do these
16        wrongs.
17              They asked, and the -- our Supreme Court
18        expresses that the jurors' expression of moral
19        condemnation is what the basis of punitive
20        damages are.  And you've heard the evidence
21        that makes that determination.
22              Let me give you one brief overview of
23        something I wanted to talk to you about.  The
24        defense will say -- you've heard them say
25        this -- that you're going to hear new evidence. Mr. Furr said you're going to hear new
2        evidence that's going to give you a sense of
3        how things have changed in the company.
4              And I think I told you in opening
5        statement, keep your ear out for the word
6        "change" and see if Dr. Lipowicz and see if
7        Charles Garner actually say that their company
8        changed.
9              And I don't remember hearing them say
10        that.  Change, let's talk about change, real
11        change, and let's contextualize this entity,
12        this tobacco industry.
13              This is corporate wrongdoing, large scale
14        corporate malfeasance that set the template for
15        other types of corporations who might be
16        attempted to do wrong.
17              And you can deter their other companies'
18        conduct by sending a message from a verdict
19        like that saying:  This is not the kind of
20        thing that we agree should be done.
21              But you heard from Drs. Lipowicz and
22        Garner.  You did not hear them say that they
23        had conducted any real change.
24              From what we know, the horrendous things,
25        the diabolical things you found were done in lying to people, putting false filters on
2        cigarettes, reassuring addicts, celebrating
3        that nicotine, targeting youth.  You didn't
4        hear that there was a real change.
5              They did try to say things like, well,
6        the FDA has some regulatory authority over us.
7              But change, let's talk about comparing
8        the entity here.  Those corporate reps were not
9        the chief executives.  You didn't hear from
10        them.  They could bring any witness they want.
11              But real -- here is my saying, for any of
12        us, for human beings, what do we look for to
13        improve or to learn from our mistakes or to
14        find that we've learned a lesson, right?  What
15        do they say?  Real change comes from within.
16              Real change comes from within.
17              It has to be something you find within
18        yourself.  And so if you've transgressed, if a
19        concept of penitence is necessary, it must come
20        from within.  And you can't find it from
21        without.
22              So saying the FDA is going to inspect our
23        plant, and they might -- they have the right to
24        shut our plant down, is not relevant to the key
25        industry foundation of addiction and children, which we'll talk about.  They -- they're not
2        into that.
3              The fact that the FDA is doing something
4        does not mean that they're doing something.
5        We'll talk -- obviously the FDA's had no
6        effect.  I'm going to talk to you about that.
7              And obviously the FDA shutting down a
8        plant -- that's great.  The FDA regulates lots
9        of food organizations, and sometimes, you know,
10        especially in the summers, the E-coli gets in
11        the meat, and they shut down a plant because
12        there's a contamination of a poison that gets
13        into the meat and can sicken people.
14              That's an example of the FDA's regulatory
15        powers that they have over so many industries,
16        but only recently over the tobacco industry.
17              But poison is the point of their product
18        when it comes to tobacco.  We're not talking
19        about a adulterant, like an E-coli germ that
20        could make the consumer of a hamburger get
21        sick.
22              So there's nothing about they can inspect
23        our plant that has anything to do with
24        mitigation or doing something different.
25              Mitigation would come from acknowledgment that the past was prologue and had wrongful
2        conduct that needs to be corrected, and then go
3        to the heart and core of what it is that has
4        been so devastating, so terrible about this is
5        that the business is based on addicting youth.
6        The business is based on nicotine, and the
7        business is based on a complete failure to
8        address or change those issues.
9              And I'll go through some of the items in
10        the Surgeon General '12, which is in evidence.
11        I've said before, these are free.  The
12        government will send you five free copies.
13        They will pay for the postage.
14              And this is not old news, it's current
15        news, it's relevant news.  Otherwise, why would
16        it be that 2010, 2012, and 2014 would all
17        continually reflect upon the ongoing problem of
18        the power of nicotine and the diseases in the
19        body that Surgeon General '10, the blue book,
20        talks about how tobacco harms the body.  An
21        entire chapter on page 105 about the
22        devastating effects of nicotine.
23              Surgeon General '12 is preventing tobacco
24        use among youth.  A current ongoing problem.
25        Not a problem in the past. The past is prologue.  They celebrate the
2        past.  Dr. Teague.  Dr. Teague is gone, but not
3        forgotten.  His legacy lives on.  He put forth
4        the manifesto of how to go about capturing
5        youth.
6              He said in 1972 -- and I'll show you this
7        document.  He said in 1972 -- and this is in
8        evidence.  And I don't know if you guys had a
9        chance to read it back there.
10              And I'm -- you know, "you guys."  My dad
11        is a lawyer for 60 years.  The first time he
12        watched me try a case, he heard me saying "you
13        guys," he's like, "you guys," what kind of --
14        what kind of thing is that?  How you talk to
15        people that way?
16              Nowadays, that's -- language changes,
17        slang changes.  "You all," "you folks," "you
18        good jurors."  When I say "you guys," I mean no
19        disrespect.
20              But Teague -- this guy laid out the
21        manifesto.  He was the brilliant tactician.
22        This document comes from the early '70s, 1972.
23        It's marked Confidential.  It's in evidence.
24        The PT number is 1040.
25              What did Dr. Teague find and what did he say about we must capture our share of the
2        youth market to survive.  That if we don't get
3        the youth, we'll go out of business.  If we
4        don't have nicotine, we'll go out of business.
5              He said that one of the ways to come up
6        with a youth brand was to control the nicotine
7        as an introductory level, you know, get those
8        kids worked up to larger amounts of nicotine
9        until they're fully hooked.
10              And he said:  You could create a useful
11        demonstrable -- slow it down.
12              You could create a useful demonstrable
13        novelty and filter, mouthpieces, package or
14        other aspect of the product system.
15              Now, how prescient, right.  How
16        predictive of the future, and how much did he
17        lay the groundwork that 40 years later, one of
18        the most successful brands particularly
19        appealing to kids is Camel Crush.
20              And Camel Crush -- that slide -- okay.
21        Hands off the button.
22              And Camel Crush is the one that has got
23        the little mint ball, the useful novelty in the
24        filter.  And Camel Crush in the 2012 Surgeon
25        General's Report is a youth brand. It excites the kids.  The kids like to
2        use it.  It's got a little toy you can click,
3        and it pops, just like you click a clicker.
4        Hear it?  You can pop that menthol, and there's
5        that candy ball.  Hear it?  The candy ball
6        inside there.  This is for youth.
7              How have they mitigated?  How have they
8        changed?  They haven't.  It's the same
9        business.
10              And it's the same business that
11        Dr. Teague predicted and predicated on the
12        future, that rush of menthol, that rush of
13        nicotine.
14              Sometimes this thing says thank you for
15        choosing choice.  Nobody chooses nicotine
16        addiction.  But it hooks kids.
17              And that was Doctor -- this is from 2010,
18        when they introduced this product that's been
19        so successful that the Marlboro people, the
20        Philip Morris people have copied it to make it.
21        So one of the things --
22              MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor,
23        there's no evidence of that.
24              THE COURT:  Sustained.
25 One of the things -- TEPIKIAN:  Move to strike.
2              THE COURT:  Excuse me.  There is an
3        objection.  I sustained it.
4 Yes, sir.
5              One of the things that you will see in
6        evidence is that you can consider mitigation.
7        And I'm giving you an example of, is this
8        mitigation.
9              One of the things you'll see in the
10        instructions is, you can consider where some of
11        those guys that are gone, does that relieve
12        them of the right to be punished?
13              However, corporations have immortality.
14        You heard the dates of these corporations going
15        back to the 1800s.  We humans don't.  In the
16        ordinary course of things, corporate officers
17        come and go.  They live out their work life
18        expectancy, they retire, they get the gold
19        watch, they get the pension, they play at the
20        golf club, they get their portrait on the wall.
21              You never heard any evidence that anybody
22        was vilified or excoriated or rejected or
23        punished for not being at the company.  They
24        hand the baton off to the next executive, and
25        the plan stays in place.  The plan stays in place.
2              And that's what I want you to be thinking
3        about as you go through whether or not there's
4        been any meaningful mitigation in this case.
5              Now, we talked about that.  You can
6        consider the nature, extent and degree of
7        misconduct and related circumstances.
8              That means all of the evidence from the
9        prior case.  You were presented with a verdict
10        form.  Is by clear and convincing evidence.
11              Remember, I said no doubt about the
12        doubt.  No illusion about the confusion.
13        Nothing about the dishonesty to fraudulently
14        reassure people of their health, that filters,
15        which were phony, were something that smokers
16        could rely on as a psychological crutch to keep
17        them from smoking.
18              You remember, we even put in a paper
19        where Claude Teague, brilliant guy, invented a
20        special color-changing filter where the dye
21        would react with the warmth, and it would look
22        brown and would have marketing advantages,
23        because people attributed great significance to
24        the look of the filters and make them believe
25        something, something was being taken out. That is deception at a high level of
2        sophistication.  And we know now that all
3        filters are white.  So when you draw on them,
4        they turn brown, folks think something bad is
5        being taken out.
6              And yet the NCI 13 says:  Every
7        cigarette, the light cigarettes, the filtered
8        cigarettes are not only just as bad as every
9        other cigarette, but they're worse.  And the
10        death rates are worse.
11              Dr. Proctor, you'll see it.  We're at the
12        height of death from smoking.  They haven't
13        made a safer cigarette, and they haven't done
14        anything to reduce nicotine, because as I said,
15        that's the center of their universe.
16              And as Dr. Teague said, that is the
17        sine qua non of their business.  Without
18        nicotine, there would be no business.  They
19        would liquidate their business.
20              Here is his document also in evidence,
21        PT04791, Research Planning Memorandum.
22        Confidential.  Never meant to see the light of
23        day.  A treasure trove that whistleblowers and
24        lawsuits shook loose.  This was not voluntary
25        from these guys.  They never wanted this to see the light of day.
2              We have the database of corporate
3        misconduct.  In this country, you stand on
4        equal footing to treat them as people who have
5        the rights of people, responsibilities of
6        people.
7              And you have the ability to say:  We are
8        going to speak truth to power.
9              You heard how powerful Dr. Proctor said
10        the industry was.  However, you can speak truth
11        to power.  You can stand on equal footing with
12        them.  And you can say:  We reject in the
13        strongest possible terms a business built on
14        knowledgeably addicting children, killing folks
15        decades before their time and replacing them --
16              MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor,
17        Williams-State Farm.
18 -- with more children.
19              THE COURT:  Objection noted.  It's
20        overruled.
21              Proceed --
22              MR. TEPIKIAN:  May I have a continuing
23        objection on that, Your Honor, on harm to
24        others?
25              THE COURT:  Well, they are allowed to treat harm for reprehensibility, so it gets in,
2        and there is an instruction on that.  I have
3        instructed the jury on that.
4              He's asking for a continuing objection.
5        Do you have any objection?
6 No.
7              THE COURT:  It's granted.
8 And embarking upon an
9        intentional campaign to entice, attract, and
10        addict our most vulnerable when they are at
11        their most vulnerable.  90 percent is under 18
12        years of age.
13              Kids don't typically -- the vast, vast
14        majority of smoking doesn't occur until after
15        21.  Like I've said, you want to be
16        responsible, really raise the minimum age.  Put
17        them --
18              MR. FURR:  Objection.
19 -- behind the counter
20        at the pharmacy.
21              MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.
22              THE COURT:  Overruled.
23 You can put them on
24        the -- you can have a prescription form.  You
25        can put them at the counter behind the pharmacy.  You can raise the minimum age to 21.
2              If 12, 13, and 14-year-olds are getting
3        cigarettes, because the legal age is 18, just
4        like with drinking, everybody knows if you move
5        the legal age to 21 --
6              MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.
7 -- it makes it harder
8        to move --
9              THE COURT:  Overruled.
10 -- it makes it harder
11        for the young people that are 13, 14, 15, to
12        get the cigarettes.  It's just a good,
13        reasonable approach to making things safer.
14        And yet, you won't see that.
15              But here is what you will see.  And
16        please read it if you've not read it.  Some of
17        it is a little high-tech, but it gets to the
18        point.
19              This is the research planning memorandum.
20        Here is the name of it.  On the nature of the
21        tobacco business and the crucial role of
22        nicotine therein.  It's an RJR confidential.
23        It's a Claude Teague document.
24              It contains what I call the chiller.  The
25        two-stage model:  Attract them -- attract those kids with glamour, with adulthood, with
2        derring-do, with even the threat that it might
3        be harmful.  The warning themselves may be a
4        plus.
5              Dr. Teague said that.  The warnings may
6        help us sell cigarettes.
7              And he said:  We have deliberately played
8        down the role of nicotine, hence the nonsmoker
9        has little or no knowledge of what
10        satisfactions it may offer him and no desire to
11        try.
12              Instead, we must somehow convince him
13        with wholly irrational reasons that he should
14        try smoking in the hope that he will then for
15        himself discover the real -- and this is in
16        quotes -- "satisfactions attainable."
17              And remember, Dr. Proctor talked about
18        satisfaction is one of the code words they use
19        for addiction.
20              So that is just a cold-blooded, direct
21        attempt to get kids addicted to cigarettes.
22              And that has not changed, because the
23        Surgeon General is chock full of data about
24        how, to this day, 2012, 2014, kids are what
25        it's all about. You can have the financial resources of
2        the defendant -- now, look.  The damages in
3        this case, the compensatory damages, the
4        $1.5 million, that was your -- that was in the
5        wisdom of your deliberative process the amount
6        you felt was fair and reasonable to give
7        restoration damages to measure the loss, show
8        through your verdict to John, you place great
9        value on his pain and suffering.
10              But that's not what this part is about.
11        This part is about punishment.  Punishment is
12        different.  It has to bear a reasonable
13        relationship to the one case we're here on.
14              We're not here on all 3,000 cases at
15        once.  We're here on one case.
16              So like I said, you guys will throw a
17        rope across Gulliver's chest, and you will add
18        to the cases that are being handled in Florida
19        your perception of to what degree they should
20        be punished insofar as Glo.
21              So you can consider the harm suffered by
22        others, as His Honor has reminded you, not
23        party to the lawsuit in assessing the
24        reprehensibility of the defendants' acts.
25              So what happened to Glodine, happened to Glodine.  In the '20s, they were saying:  High
2        school days are here.  Let's market to youth.
3        We must capture our share of the youth market.
4        That was when she was born.  A year after she
5        was born, they were laying for her.
6              And sure enough, by 1940, at 13 or 14
7        years of age, she was a smoker.
8              They were getting those kids.  Go to the
9        schools, get the kids.  She was a victim of
10        that exact plan, which continues unabated to
11        this day, although with subtlety, with
12        sophistication, underground, buy one, get one
13        free.
14              What should the tobacco companies be
15        doing?
16              What should the tobacco companies be
17        doing?
18              If they were a responsible, sincere
19        organization that wanted to reduce harm that
20        really cared about having less kids, keep it
21        out of the reach of children.
22              How do you keep something out of the
23        reach of children?  Raise the minimum age.
24              MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.
25              THE COURT:  Overruled. SCHLESINGER:  Acknowledge on your
2        website that you have, in fact, in the past
3        done this, and you won't do it again.
4              MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.
5              THE COURT:  Overruled.
6 Don't make cigarettes
7        that look so enticing and so similar to every
8        other consumer product that a child cannot tell
9        the difference between the color schemes of a
10        Batmobile toy or a deck of cards.
11              It looks normal.  It looks safe.  Keep it
12        out of the reach of children.
13              It can be done.  Hold it out of their
14        reach.  Keep it away from them.  You're not old
15        enough.  Let them know.  Don't make it so
16        addictive that -- don't try to get into the
17        hands of kids.  That's what they should be
18        doing.
19              This company's motto or logo almost
20        seems, if I was being a little facetious, it
21        would be more like:  Kids are us.  That's not
22        what a tobacco entity should be.
23              So you want to be able to keep these
24        things out of the reach of children.
25              Who said that?  I read to you from Bennett LeBow.  I quoted the page.  This is in
2        evidence.  I'll quote the page again.
3              On page 518, the whole page is great.  It
4        talks about LeBow.  He came forward, and he
5        said:  The whole industry markets to children.
6              In that Master Settlement Agreement, he
7        came clean for Liggett, the smallest company.
8        He came clean on that issue.  We're all
9        marketing to children.  We've got to get them
10        for the replacement smokers.
11              You won't see such an acknowledgment on
12        the website.
13              MR. FURR:  Objection.
14 He made amends --
15              THE COURT:  Excuse me, what is the
16        objection?
17              MR. FURR:  The objection is --
18              THE COURT:  Two or three words.
19              MR. FURR:  Failure to admit is improper
20        argument.
21              THE COURT:  He didn't say failure to
22        admit.
23              That objection is overruled.  Proceed.
24 So, in addition, in
25        '97, '98, when he went ahead and made that acknowledgment and said that, and it's in the
2        book and you can read it.
3              And you can also read the Tyler Foote
4        quote on page 517 and 518 which says this, and
5        I'll read it quick, "The cigarette industry has
6        been artfully maintaining that cigarette
7        advertising has nothing to do with total sales.
8        This is complete and utter nonsense.  The
9        industry knows it's nonsense.
10              "I am always amused by the suggestion
11        that advertising, a function that has been
12        shown to increase the consumption of virtually
13        every other product, somehow miraculously fails
14        to work for the tobacco products."
15              So you can read about this.  You can read
16        on page 519 how Joe Camel -- the Joe Camel
17        products were youthening the brand -- I might
18        have a Joe Camel, Camel bucks there -- were
19        youthening the brand.  But the kids are a huge
20        part of this.
21              Don't kill yourself.  I'll keep going.
22              All right.  So warning, smoking is
23        addictive.  Keep it out of the reach of
24        children.  Let folks know, Hey, kids, be
25        careful, you may get hooked.  Hey, kids, let's not let it in your hands.
2              Keep it out of the reach of children.
3              This is the kind of thing you saw where
4        they used to put the Joe Camel, Camel bucks.
5        Back before this was banned, Joe Camel was
6        banned, appealed so much to kids, as
7        Dr. Proctor said, that 3 and 6-year-olds could
8        equally recognize it and associate it to a
9        cigarette as they could Mickey Mouse.  And it
10        was as young as you could get.
11              Can I have the clicker again?
12              Now, look, what do we know in 2014?  Has
13        there been change?  Has there been mitigation?
14        Has there been an explanation or an excuse of
15        why they did it the way they did it or a
16        demonstration they're going to do it
17        differently.  You've not heard that.
18              The century long epidemic of cigarette
19        smoking has caused an enormous public health
20        tragedy.
21              And since the first Surgeon General's
22        Report in 1964, more than 20 million premature
23        deaths can be attributed to cigarette smoking.
24              That's -- as I told you before, the
25        numbers numb.  I showed you the state of Florida and said, imagine nobody is there.  Dry
2        from Key West to Pensacola.  Go by every
3        school, every hamburger stand, every park,
4        every business, every building, and it's
5        completely empty.  20 million people gone.
6              That is such a huge number it's hard to
7        wrap your mind around it.  But it's the truth.
8              The greatest substance abuse drug product
9        in the United States is tobacco.  It's the
10        leading preventable cause of unnecessary death
11        in this country.
12              And the tobacco organizations are
13        sophisticated.  They put up websites yesterday
14        as part of their defense.
15              But if you really look close -- and we
16        don't have time to do it all -- they said:  We
17        agree that cigarette smoking is a leading cause
18        of death in the country.  But all of the public
19        health authorities say cigarette smoking is the
20        leading cause.
21              Now, why does it matter, a "the" or an
22        "a"?  Well, if you say something is a leading
23        cause, it implies there are plenty of other
24        leading causes.  It's not so bad.  But it's the
25        leading cause in the public health community. Far and away the leading cause.  Nothing else
2        comes close.
3              Yet it hides in plain sight.  It's almost
4        as if we just accept it.  So what you've been
5        indoctrinated into is something very special.
6        You have taken a lot of time to do it, and we
7        are appreciative of you taking the time to do
8        it.
9              Additionally, the -- and here is what the
10        real story is.  The tobacco epidemic was
11        initiated and has been sustained by the
12        aggressive strategies of the tobacco industry
13        which has deliberately misled the public on the
14        risks of smoking cigarettes.
15              That is the punishment phase.  That's
16        what you found applied to Glodine McCoy.
17        That's why you found by clear and convincing
18        evidence that these folks should be punished.
19              This is always to me the most important
20        part of the case, because the chance to make a
21        statement that most have not made.
22              You really are doing something that the
23        MSA didn't do.  There's no punishment.  They
24        put no evidence of that up.
25              You get to say to them, this fresh statement by the Surgeon General is recognizing
2        that what is driving this vector of disease,
3        the spread of disease isn't smoking.  It
4        isn't -- it's the people enticing folks to
5        smoke and hooking them.
6              That's what's driving this vector of
7        disease.  And the burden and death and disease
8        from tobacco in the United States which is
9        overwhelmingly caused by cigarettes and
10        combusted tobacco products.
11              Regular cigarettes will rapidly be --
12        rapid elimination of the use will dramatically
13        reduce this burden.
14              That's the point of 2014.  The numbers
15        need to come down.  If they got on board with
16        that and reduced the addiction and eliminated
17        youth access, which they have the power to do,
18        they would run their business from what it is
19        today to maybe as little as 10 percent of what
20        it is today.
21              But as you saw from the financial
22        information that you're allowed to take into
23        consideration, they're making billions.
24        Billions every year.  Tens of millions a day.
25        Hundreds of millions just during the pendency of this case.  And so that is a roaring river
2        of cash.
3              If you ever stood on top of the waterfall
4        at Yellowstone and saw the power of a spring
5        waterfall coming down, that's the roaring river
6        of cash that gives this industry such power.
7        And continues to give this industry power.
8              But wouldn't it be responsible, wouldn't
9        it be a fantastic thing, wouldn't it be what
10        the future holds for increasing and helping
11        public health in this country if they took that
12        bold step and they said -- and the shareholders
13        would have to go run for the exits, no doubt
14        about it.  They're not going to get those
15        chunky dividends, they're not going to make as
16        many profits, but it would still be a
17        profitable business.  Wouldn't that be
18        honorable?
19              And it could be done.  That would be
20        mitigation.  That would be change.  You've
21        heard none of that.
22              So this is from page 20.  I'm not going
23        to go too far, but it does talk about the guilt
24        and all the things that tobacco did to make
25        this trouble, to make this problem; that they misled, they discredited scientific evidence.
2              As Dr. Prochaska said, in the most recent
3        Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco in
4        which she chaired it, she was fielding
5        ambiguity and confusion being put into the
6        science, right now, today, a problem that
7        plagued her of undisclosed Philip Morris-funded
8        scientists trying to get in and subvert and
9        make ambiguity in the research.
10              Where is the change?  Where is the
11        mitigation?
12              You may consider the ongoing nature of
13        these wrongs.
14              What does Katherine [sic] Sebelius say,
15        and what is the legacy, what is the testament
16        that you can leave to honor what happened to
17        Glo McCoy, one of many.  Gone, but not
18        forgotten.  An innocent, generic victim of the
19        scourge of the cigarette century, the tobacco
20        epidemic.
21              That since she died in the last 18 years
22        what we are looking for as a current trajectory
23        is 5.6 million children alive today who were
24        younger than 18 years of age who will die
25        prematurely as a result of smoking. You want to make cigarette smoking -- you
2        want to make cigarette smoking safer, keep it
3        out of the reach of children.
4              Menthol.  You learn about menthol.
5        Menthol initiates youth.  Menthol deepens
6        addiction.  Menthol makes it more difficult to
7        get off of cigarettes.  Keep it out of the
8        reach of children.
9              Glodine was a child.  That plan is still
10        in place 75 years later.  75 years later.  They
11        need to keep it out of the reach of children.
12        That would make it a huge public health
13        benefit.
14              Buying Newport.  Is that transforming
15        tobacco?  Anybody can put a self-serving
16        marketing pack on a website and say we're
17        mitigating, migrating, we're transforming.
18              But you heard these folks testifying here
19        yesterday.  It just didn't meet with the bounds
20        of common sense.  Because the -- the merger
21        happened finality on the Friday we were
22        preselecting you as jurors.
23              And one of the things that Alex
24        Alvarez -- who has been real busy since you all
25        saw him, who came and helped pick the jury -- said:  Hey, there's two different kinds of
2        damages here if you get there.  There's
3        compensatory damages for the wrongful death.
4        The loss of a love, the loss -- the mental
5        anguish, the 18 years he didn't get to spend
6        with his wife that you found should be
7        compensated.  That is restoration damages.
8              But if you go further and you decide
9        there are punishment to be made, the punishment
10        comes from them.  It's designed to hurt them,
11        and it is not the compensation.  It's
12        punishment to them.  It's a different kind of
13        damages.
14              But -- and Alex brought this out, because
15        he wanted it out in the open, because he wanted
16        to test your feelings about it.  He made a very
17        broad conversation.  I've got it quoted, but
18        I'll paraphrase it, where he said:  That
19        money -- the way that money goes is, the judge
20        doesn't say it's going to the American Cancer
21        Society.  The judge doesn't say it's going to
22        the hospital for sick children or to nicotine
23        cessation centers.  It's a punishment, and it
24        ends up going to the McCoy family.
25              Does anybody here have a problem with that?  If that is how His Honor gives you the
2        law, then will you follow that law?
3              Is there anybody troubled by it?  Is
4        there anybody who doesn't think he can do it?
5              So, when you hear the same instructions
6        from Phase I as in this phase about your
7        verdict should not be influenced by passion,
8        prejudice -- passion, prejudice or sympathy for
9        or against any party, it would be prejudicial
10        for somebody to say to you they shouldn't get
11        punishment damages, though, even though they're
12        deserved by this industry for this legacy of
13        death, this enterprise of death.
14              Because the way the law works, it ends up
15        going to John.  We'll talk about that if they
16        bring that up, if they argue it.
17              But keep in mind, that might be an appeal
18        to prejudice, which is excluded from this.
19              By the same token, no passion.  You're
20        going to work from your smarts, from your
21        brains, and you're not going to work from hate.
22        This is not what we're here about.  We're here
23        about punishment, a sentencing phase that's
24        what it's about.
25              So 5.6 million children alive today younger than 18 will die prematurely.  That's a
2        terrible legacy ongoing today.
3              Here are the conspirators.  I showed you
4        this in opening statement.  It's been so
5        long -- it's been so long to try this case, I
6        had to get a second haircut, which I did.
7              I think I saw Mr. Furr got another
8        haircut too.
9              But -- and I'll tell you, I told him when
10        we were deliberating, I said:  I hope you get
11        to use it.
12              Nothing offensive to him.  He does a fine
13        job for his clients.  He's got a difficult
14        case.  He does a fine job.  He's a powerful
15        attorney, and he's going to make his case to
16        you afterwards.
17              But here, these were the conspirator
18        boards.  These are the folks that are
19        supposedly gone, but the natural evolution of a
20        corporation, it goes on with its subsequent
21        people.  Nobody took the baton and kept the
22        business going the same way as always.  Get the
23        kids.  The Surgeon General '12 is full of it.
24              Here is what you need to know:  Lipowicz
25        and Garner were there in the 80s.  They were there in the early '90s.  They were there while
2        the conspiracy was underway.  They were there
3        before the Engle trial took place.  They were
4        there before the lawsuits that led to the
5        Master Settlement Agreement was placed.
6              So a corporation gets the rights of a
7        person.  A corporation is made up of people.
8              Those folks did not come clean.  They
9        toed the party line.  They were part of that
10        conspiracy.
11              So when you say, they're all gone, they
12        are not all gone.  They are guys that were
13        still there during the height of the
14        conspiracy, before Waxman got up and swore to
15        those CEOs, and they lied to the American
16        people.  They lied to Congress.  Which was a
17        huge turning point.
18              Which even though it's been 20 years,
19        it's what taught us what we need to know about
20        how bad this industry made choices devoid of a
21        moral compass.
22              I know I have a business.  It's killing
23        my customers, but I'm making so much money, I'm
24        going to keep doing it.  I'll replace the ones
25        that are dying with children. It doesn't meet with the bounds of human
2        decency.  It's hard to justify.
3              And we don't want other corporations
4        thinking they can do it too.  So when you
5        punish, when you exact a fine, it sends a
6        message to other corporations.
7              You hear things all the time in the
8        country nowadays about global warning.  Is our
9        planet burning to a cinder.  And supposedly
10        99.9 percent of the science says it is, but
11        there's a doubt campaign on that too.
12              MR. FURR:  Objection.  There is no such
13        evidence, Your Honor.
14              THE COURT:  Sustained.
15 Any other corporation
16        that may be using campaigns of doubt could be
17        deterred in part by your small contribution.
18              You can't put these companies out of
19        business, and you would have to award billions
20        of dollars to do it.  We are not asking you to
21        do that.
22              I will ask you for amounts which are in
23        line with the damages you've awarded for the
24        single case, the generic smoker, one of
25        millions. And you will do your part to -- as I
2        said, to throw a rope across Gulliver's chest.
3        Gulliver's Travels, the giant, the Lilliputians
4        staked him down.  That's what I'm talking
5        about.  We all remember that children's story.
6              So here is a guy, Claude Teague, may he
7        rest in peace, lived to the ripe old age of 88
8        years old, beloved at the company, many
9        insights, his legacy lives on.  I talked about
10        him.  Those are this documents that you have in
11        evidence.
12              The crucial role of nicotine, the
13        sine qua non, and the thoughts on capturing the
14        youth market.
15              And how about the novelty of the filter,
16        1972, that 40 years later, sure as God made
17        little green apples, they put that novelty in
18        the filter.  And who presaged it?  He did.
19              Now, this is the novelty in the filter.
20        Right?
21              Well, it's in evidence.  I'm not going to
22        go through it.
23              Now we're going to take some time to talk
24        about the other products, the heat-not-burn,
25        the e-cigarettes, and the snus. Here is the major contradiction.  Here is
2        the problem.  I'll say it in a nutshell, and
3        I'll see how the slides follow along.  I
4        probably won't keep climbing on this, but I'm
5        trying to make a point.
6              Major contradiction on this migration
7        strategy.  That website -- you know Charles
8        Garner has been here for a bunch of other
9        cases.  He was here in this courtroom just a
10        few months ago.
11              This idea of a migration strategy.  They
12        didn't say they changed, but they tried to
13        suggest to you we're a more responsible
14        corporation.  We are in a situation here now
15        where we are moving forward, where we would
16        like all of our customers ultimately to use --
17        non -- non-inhalable, you know, cigarettes.
18        The regular cigarettes.
19              Put a pouch in your mouth, snus, or chew
20        or mint, whatever little nicotine product, that
21        give you the nicotine.  They talked about that.
22              And they also talked about the idea that
23        that was the migration strategy.
24              But the fact of the matter is, it always
25        was a fiction.  It was always an interesting little thing they put on their website, and
2        they could come into courtrooms and make it
3        sound like, you know, the future is unsmokable
4        and new ways of delivering nicotine.
5              Yeah, it begs the question, is one kind
6        of nicotine addiction better than another kind
7        of nicotine addiction.
8              It begs the question, with all the kids
9        that we have today smoking e-cigarettes, do you
10        want to initiate them to nicotine addiction
11        through the noncombustible, the e-cigarettes,
12        will they go on to smoking regular cigarettes?
13        There's huge problems not yet sorted out.
14              But this case really isn't about
15        E-cigarettes.  What it is about is hypocrisy.
16              They haven't had a chance to really
17        change the website and figure out what to do
18        with the inconsistencies that are on the
19        website.
20              You can't say we're transforming and
21        we're going to sell non-smokable cigarettes
22        like snus or e-cigarettes when, in fact, your
23        actions speak louder than words.
24              And what you did was you bought Newport
25        cigarettes, one of the major selling brands that sells 40 million cigarettes a year -- 40
2        billion cigarettes a year, and is one of the
3        top selling brands in the world, and it's a
4        Newport inhalable cigarette.
5              And in the same time -- and we did this
6        with Dr. Lipowicz -- at the same time,
7        Lorillard had the number one brand, the
8        national brand that's on national news
9        advertising, national cigarette advertising,
10        Stephen Dorff.  The number one brand of Blu
11        e-cigarettes.  They disposed of that.
12              They bought the smokeable Newport and
13        disposed of the e-cigarette.
14              What was the excuse?  Well, we like ours
15        better.  Yeah, but yours isn't selling.  Yours
16        doesn't sell a fraction of what Blu
17        e-cigarettes sells.
18              And by the way, we're about buying brands
19        and brand names.  And if yours is so great,
20        great, get the Blu brand name and stick it on
21        your cigarette.
22              But it's a hypocrisy.  Their actions
23        don't match up with their representations.
24              Their growth -- you saw it on the
25        website, and I'll show it to you -- their growth is in the cigarettes, Newport, Camel.
2        That is where the growth is in cigarettes, Pall
3        Mall.  That represents 90 percent of the money
4        they're making.  That's where it's at.
5              So really, what did Charles Garner talk
6        about when I said why aren't you going to
7        e-cigarettes?
8              He goes:  Well, it's going to take time.
9        It's going to take time.
10              That's the greatest excuse in the world,
11        because time is on their side.  It's an old
12        Rolling Stones song, Time is On My Side.  An
13        old Rolling Stones song.
14              Time has worked so well for them for so
15        long.  The internal document has been the
16        holding strategy.  It's never been a vehicle
17        for victory.  It's always been a holding
18        strategy.
19              So, have things changed?  No.  They're
20        still conducting the holding strategy that for
21        all those years, now it's going on today, helps
22        them defend in litigation, politics, public
23        opinion a brilliantly conceived strategy
24        executed over the years to win important
25        battles, and it was never meant to be a vehicle for victory.
2              On the contrary, it has always been a
3        holding strategy, and it continues to be a
4        holding strategy today.  Unchanged.
5        Unrepentant.  Nothing that happened to my
6        client has been changed.
7              I showed you Camel Crush.  I discussed
8        Claude Teague with you.
9              You can see from page 538 on this that
10        there was still lots of stuff being given to
11        kids to appeal to the kids.  538 lays it out.
12        I won't take too much time.  All the studies,
13        Mandalay Lime, cream of mint, unique flavors.
14        These things appeal to adolescents.
15              The Master Settlement Agreement didn't
16        start a thing.
17              And don't forget, they talked about
18        billions going to the Master Settlement
19        Agreement.  $176 billion a year in the Surgeon
20        General's Report -- I'll show it to you -- is
21        what cigarettes cost America in healthcare.
22              And we always talk about healthcare
23        crisis.  And we talked about Obamacare, and we
24        talk about how are we going to pay for all this
25        healthcare. We could get rid of $176 billion a year
2        in healthcare costs from cigarettes if we could
3        meaningfully reduce the use of this addictive
4        drug that's legal, so it's socially believed to
5        be acceptable.
6              One of the things they can't do, they
7        can't vilify industry.
8              In this courtroom, I vilified industry.
9        I showed you the truth of their corporate
10        documents of decades of allowing death in
11        exchange for profits knowledgeably, on purpose,
12        intentionally, gratefully.  Who ain't for more
13        money?
14              However, the way in which that MSA is set
15        up, there is an anti-vilification clause.  When
16        you see the ads, and you see that poor lady on
17        Tobacco Free Florida who has a hole in her
18        throat, and she's putting her teeth in and
19        she's putting her wig on --
20              MR. FURR:  Objection, that is beyond the
21        scope.
22              THE COURT:  Sustained.
23 John testified about
24        seeing that powerful ad about the sick smoker.
25        When you see that smoker -- and it's in evidence -- it focuses on the smoker and the
2        illness that befalls a smoker.
3              It doesn't focus on the important Surgeon
4        General number 2 conclusion as recently as 2014
5        saying:  This epidemic is because of the
6        aggressive strategies of tobacco who
7        deliberately misled the public on the risks of
8        smoking cigarettes.
9              Including my client.
10              So the fact that they can't vilify
11        industry also shows how the MSA doesn't have
12        teeth.  And there's not a dollar out of the MSA
13        that has anything to do with punishment.  And
14        even though it's been billions of dollars, you
15        can infer that those costs have been passed on.
16        And what's more, those --
17              MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.
18              THE COURT:  Overruled.
19 -- those billions of
20        dollars don't represent a fraction of what that
21        $176 billion a year is.
22              If you're paying 4 billion a year -- 2,
23        3, $4 billion a year out of the profits that --
24        the costs that you're passing along, those
25        tobacco companies are still enjoying huge profits.  And it's 4 billion versus
2        176 billion.  It's a drop in the bucket.
3              And it's not about punishment.  There was
4        no acknowledgment or no finding of punishment.
5              It's like someone who has done wrong,
6        like someone who has been convicted of a
7        multiplicity -- a string of crimes:  Bank
8        robbery, liquor store robbery, strongarm
9        felony, a home invasion burglary, a 20-year
10        crime spree, on the loose, gets caught --
11              MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection to the
12        comparison, Your Honor.
13              THE COURT:  Sustained.
14 Someone who is --
15              THE COURT:  Counsel, you're at 45
16        minutes.
17 Yeah.
18              Someone who has done a lot of wrong
19        things and then asks for leniency, saying,
20        Well, I paid all my taxes.  I paid my taxes.
21        Doesn't punish the wrongdoing.
22              So this is from page 112.  It talks about
23        the design of cigarettes making a more
24        addictive, and it mentions ammonia.  Okay?
25              This is -- this is -- that says:  I told you, they are more addictive than ever.  That's
2        in the beginning of the Surgeon General 2014.
3        More addictive than ever.
4              And Surgeon General '12.  And this one
5        is:  They are more deadly than ever.  They are
6        more deadly than ever.
7              The -- this talks about how you get
8        pro-smoking messages out despite the act.
9        Okay?  This is page 600, I'll go past that.
10              This talks about menthol, talks about
11        ammonia, and how the cigarettes are more
12        addicted.  Page 181.  I'll go past that.
13              It talks about -- mentholation improves
14        the taste.  Young smokers smoke menthol
15        cigarettes at a higher percentage than any
16        other age group.  That's today.
17              They told you cigarette smoking has
18        declined, but the fact is the rate of decline
19        of cigarette smoking has stopped.  It's slowed
20        down.
21              Unfortunately, there's still a tremendous
22        amount of kids that are beginning smoking every
23        day who are on a path, a long-term addiction
24        and abuse.  Dr. Prochaska said it was in the
25        thousands. And then these menthol cigarettes are
2        smoked disproportionately among teens, and the
3        menthol is used as a marketing to catch young
4        smokers.  That's page 537, 538 and 600.  They
5        talk about -- and look at this.  The most
6        heavily advertised brands.  The number one
7        brands, and what are they for, Marlboro,
8        Newport and Camel.
9              The gentlemen who represent the companies
10        in this room are the number one smoker --
11        smoking among adolescents, top selections for
12        young people, and they are the three most
13        heavily advertised brands.  Okay.
14              And this says that they have slowed down
15        the reduction in youth.  We're at a crossroads
16        here.  Kids are still smoking.  They are still
17        smoking too much.  They're getting addicted.
18        Five million of them are going to die, because
19        of just the smoking that's been taken up by
20        kids since my client passed away.
21              And it also talks -- and this is very
22        important -- I don't see a page.
23              Have you got the page, Danny?
24              Where the menthol shows greater signs of
25        nicotine dependence, less likely to quit smoking.  Greater addiction.  And it smoke --
2        it increases smoking initiation by youth.  Very
3        important.
4              Proctor talked about it in his testimony,
5        they could take menthol out at any time.  That
6        would save a lot of lives.  That would save a
7        lot of kids from smoking.  They have complete
8        authority to do so.  It's an additive.  They
9        could take it out at any time.
10              The Food and Drug Administration
11        eventually voluntarily, reluctantly got some
12        oversight.  That oversight has been utterly
13        ineffective.  He explained that.  Marlboro
14        explained to you.  Philip Morris explained to
15        you yesterday through Lipowicz, some of the
16        reasons why they say they embrace regulation.
17              One of the reasons he didn't say they
18        embrace regulations, and I want you to infer it
19        is, they dominate over 50 percent of the
20        market --
21              MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.
22        It's not in evidence.
23              THE COURT:  Thank you.
24              Ladies and gentlemen, you are to rely on
25        your own recollection of the evidence. SCHLESINGER:  And they could lock in
2        market dominance and market share in excess of
3        50 percent in this regulatory environment.
4              And that's worked.  They were above
5        50 percent when the act came in.  They continue
6        to be above 50 percent.  That's very important.
7              The FDA grandfathered in the deadliest
8        tobacco products.  The Marlboro today is as
9        deadly as ever produced.
10              The FDA didn't "X" out any of these
11        deadly brands, any of these youth appeal
12        brands, and they grandfathered the worst
13        products that had no significant effect on the
14        public health whatsoever.
15              And you heard all this in the first
16        phase.  You heard defendants say:  Don't punish
17        us, because we're under the FDA.  Don't punish
18        us, because we use Premier and Eclipse, which I
19        showed you has excessive cancer risk, at page
20        18 in this Surgeon General's Report.
21              They said:  Don't punish us.  But they
22        said that.  They said:  You can mitigate so you
23        don't punish us.
24              It's the same exact arguments in this
25        particular phase.  You all know where you want to be.  You have to come to a major conclusion
2        with clear and convincing evidence.
3              But the fact is, is that these cigarettes
4        are just as dangerous.  And the FDA, while
5        theoretically has power, has been flummoxed at
6        every turn.  When they didn't want the graphic
7        warning labels, they instituted a lawsuit and
8        they blocked it.
9              So it's on one hand to say, Oh, yeah,
10        we're under the FDA.
11              But it's the other hand to say, has the
12        FDA done anything?  And they have not.
13              The cigarettes are just as deadly.  This
14        is Charles Garner.  He said, and he
15        acknowledges -- I talked about this -- if we're
16        going to make an application for a modified
17        risk product, we would follow the guidance in
18        this document.
19              And they want you -- they encourage you,
20        if you really want to take the initiative to do
21        bold, innovative product changes that
22        substantially reduce or even eliminate the
23        toxicity or the addictiveness -- I don't think
24        I have that typed right -- that they should do
25        that. And the quote includes addictiveness --
2        I'll find it for rebuttal.
3              But the statement, the guidance given by
4        the FDA that Charles Garner acknowledged as a
5        product steward, he operates under, is the FDA
6        encourages you under the aegis of this act to
7        take bold and initiative steps to develop
8        products which either reduce or eliminate
9        altogether either the toxicity or the
10        addictiveness of cigarette smoking or both.
11        And they've done none of it.
12              What have they done?  They've done none
13        of it.  All these regulations from 2009 -- in
14        the year 2000, we had the MSA.
15              Even nine years later, they still needed
16        oversight.  They've got to pay for their own
17        regulation.
18              What kind of corporation has to put out
19        the money to pay for the cops that are supposed
20        to be enforcing what they're supposed to be
21        doing right?  That doesn't make sense.
22              Here is exactly what the quote says:
23        They encourage you if you really wanted to take
24        the initiative to do bold, innovative product
25        changes that substantially reduce or eliminate altogether either the toxicity or addictiveness
2        or tobacco products or both, right?
3              ANSWER:  Yes.
4              And do you agree with that?
5              ANSWER:  Yes.
6              Now, we also went on to ask him:  Has
7        anybody at Reynolds -- do you have a department
8        or anybody studying nicotine?
9              No.
10              Remember that?  So far with the FDA
11        regulations, not one single regulation has made
12        them not sell one single cigarette any time in
13        the last six years.
14              The FDA, unfortunately, just hasn't had
15        an impact.  They've been flummoxed.  They've
16        been -- they've met face to face the power of
17        industry and had the effect.
18              Let's play it.
19              (The video clip was played and taken down
20              to the best of the reporter's ability as
21              follows:)
22        A.    If we were doing research -- and just to
23 be clear for the jury, it says -- tendency that also
24 addiction or the potential for addiction, so any --
25 any research that we've done trying to understand c6e25af7-2cc5-4bbe-99c3-aefe90a9744b
1 that, we would have to turn that over to the FDA.
2        Q.    And have you done so?
3        A.    No.
4        Q.    Have you turned the information over to
5 the FDA?
6        A.    I'm sorry.  I thought you said have we
7 done any research.  No, we haven't done any research.
8 But we have turned all the information over to the
9 FDA.
10        Q.    Okay. Thank you.
11              Let's go to the second --
12              (Video concluded.)
13 Sometimes the truth
14        slips out.  And why is that?  Because they
15        don't study nicotine.  And why is that?
16        Because it is the center of their universe.
17        And what would reduce harm, that bold
18        initiative recommended by the FDA encouraged
19        them to reduce the addictiveness.  It is the
20        center of their universe.  They're never going
21        to give up the nicotine.
22              Remember Phase I.  We'll go out of
23        business without the nicotine.  It's all based
24        on the nicotine.  Our customers are addicted to
25        nicotine.  We've downplayed the role. It is drug -- the sale of an addictive
2        drug.  That is the business of cigarettes,
3        solely and exclusively.
4              These new regulations will fundamentally
5        change the way we get around them.  They are
6        powerful.  They know how to get around them,
7        and that's what they're going to do.
8              And these excuses are not change.  None
9        of these people have ever been knocked out of
10        this -- out of any sort of work because they
11        did anything that was perceived as wrong.
12              This you have to blow up a little bit, if
13        we can.  Enlarge it.  No?
14              This is page 850.  You'll look at it, of
15        the Surgeon General's Report.  I'll do this
16        real fast.  It shows in the middle here,
17        patterns of tobacco use.  Okay?
18              And in the patterns of tobacco use, you
19        will see that it says right here that the red
20        lines are health damaging influences.  The blue
21        lines are health protective influences.
22              And right here in the middle, it shows
23        the counter-tobacco litigation -- you gotta
24        back it up a little, bro.  Danny.  There you
25        go. The counter-tobacco litigation is helpful
2        and is a pro-health protective influence,
3        because it leads to regulation of tobacco
4        products.
5              But you see here in the red, tobacco
6        industry litigation, and the lines going back
7        towards the regulation of tobacco products?
8        That's a health damaging influence.  As is
9        tobacco industry marketing, as is tobacco
10        industry innovation.  And so there's a tension
11        at all times.
12              But the litigation that you're involved
13        in today can have a salutary effect, a health
14        protective influence on these kinds of
15        proceedings.  It could help people.
16              He admitted right there when the graphic
17        warnings were proposed they opposed it, sued it
18        and blocked it.  It was going to be on the
19        package to provide more information.  They
20        blocked it, because they don't want folks to
21        stop quitting.  They don't want people to be
22        completely informed.
23              That's why they haven't changed.  They
24        haven't mitigated.  They haven't given a
25        legitimate excuse for what they're doing or why they're doing it.
2              The generation, the multigenerational
3        catastrophe that is the death of parents,
4        grandparents, their children and their
5        children, as exemplified by the McCoy family,
6        continues on.
7              And the multigenerational business plan
8        of children and addiction carries on in this
9        courtroom in an industry that needs you to tell
10        them, hey, we reject this in the strongest
11        possible terms.
12              St. Augustine said:  Punishment is
13        justice for the unjust.
14              Garner denied that freebasing nicotine
15        from ammonia makes it more addictive.  We asked
16        him the question.
17              He's flat-out denied the 2010 Surgeon
18        General Report, even after he said he agreed
19        with it.  Even after they tried to tout it as a
20        benefit they cited on their website, and yet he
21        agrees with it.
22              That's not change.  That's not
23        acknowledgment.  That's not making amends.
24              That's not doing what Bennett LeBow did.
25        At least he said something.  He said smoking is addictive on its pack of cigarettes in '97 for
2        the Master Settlement Agreement.  He said:
3        Yeah, the whole industry markets to youth.
4        That's the basis of the business.  They didn't
5        do that.
6              And then what did they do?  This is
7        PT01913 in evidence.  It's the same document
8        that says our experts will say anything we tell
9        them to say.  Clearly implying they lack
10        credibility.
11              It also shows in here -- and I won't take
12        too much time with it -- was they were not --
13        back before the ingredients were compelled to
14        be put out, they were not going to put in the
15        ingredient ammonia.  They were going to keep it
16        out.
17              They had a debate in there, because
18        executives, industry, administration didn't
19        want it.
20              And it says -- the guy they were talking
21        to, he -- they want to say we were the only
22        company with ammonia on our list, and Philip
23        Morris used ammonia in substantially greater
24        quantities.
25              His reaction to my request was hostile and adversary.  He said he would quit before he
2        let us take it off their list in his view
3        because that was just what Health and Human
4        Services was looking for, to exclude it on some
5        technical wordsmithing grounds that would be
6        misleading and dishonest.
7              This is the mindset of entity, to not
8        provide information when you're supposed to be
9        giving the list to the government of what's in
10        it.
11              Because that ammonia was the secret and
12        soul of Marlboro that freebased the nicotine
13        and hooked all those kids and sent Marlboro
14        skyrocketing to be the most successful brand.
15              This is the kind of thinking inside the
16        company that shows folks that are not on the
17        right track, that are doing intentionally
18        wrongful behavior.
19              THE COURT:  You're on an hour, Counsel.
20 I'll take a few from
21        the back end.
22              You know, it's all about replacement
23        smoking.  12-year-olds, replacement smokers.
24              This is the Diane Burrows internal
25        document.  No doubt about it.  They changed the word from "youth" to "young adult" to try to be
2        a little bit tricky, very dishonest.  Deep
3        layers of dishonesty.
4              The candy flavoring attracted smokers.
5        Page 600, you can read that.
6              And what did he say:  We don't advertise
7        to children.  That was 1984.  I showed that to
8        you in opening statement.
9              And what do we know?  In the year 2014,
10        despite everything that the Surgeon General in
11        2012 says, that the industry is still all about
12        attracting youth with their sexy messages:  We
13        don't market to youth.
14              That's Charles Garner yesterday.
15              Is that change?  Is that making amends?
16        It is not.
17              Here is some of the stuff they used to do
18        with Joe Camel, and here is some of the stuff
19        they do today.
20              They call American Spirit organic.
21        100 percent additive free, but it's got menthol
22        in it.
23              Explain to me how you can say something
24        is 100 percent organic with menthol and tell
25        them it's organic, unless you want them to believe it's healthier.  Organic food, it
2        doesn't have genetically modified organisms in
3        it.
4              But how does the menthol get in there if
5        it's additive free?  Look at that.  Is that a
6        young person.  Is that attractive to youth?
7              Inspiration where a moment becomes a
8        memory.  On Glamour magazine with One
9        Direction, the teenybopper boy band.
10              And there was dozens of magazines like
11        this.  Since 2013 through today, you have some
12        fresh magazines in evidence.
13              Look at that.  Discover the unexpected,
14        celebrate the unforgettable.  Taste it all.
15              Sure, there is a warning, but what is the
16        prominent message displayed by that?  Is that
17        black-and-white warning really the attention
18        getting, the attraction that's of that ad.
19              It's a beautiful ad.  It's brilliant
20        advertising.  They are brilliant at imagery.
21        Look at it.  That's beautiful.  Look at that.
22              Does that appeal to youth in the Glamour
23        magazine that has teen viewerships of upwards
24        of 12 million people in some of these
25        magazines? And you've got the moments, the
2        imagination, the discovery.  Look at that.  A
3        costume party with feathers.
4              Those people -- I don't see any wrinkles,
5        and I don't think it's from Botox.  Those are
6        youth.  That is the basis of the business.
7              The packaging, the design appeals to
8        youth, that's page 600.
9              Proctor says:  Of course they advertise
10        them.  That's why they smoke them.
11              And what do they say in opening
12        statement -- what do they say in closing
13        statement in Phase I to try to get you to not
14        even find that you should punish them, that
15        they were reprehensible, that they should face
16        some sort of punishment?
17              Well, they said:  Look at all we did.
18        Premier.  And we spent all this money.
19              And then Mr. Furr said:  I'm going to
20        bring in new evidence in Phase II, I'm going to
21        show you what we've done.  I'm going to bring
22        you new evidence.
23              And he just rehashed the same old
24        evidence that he tried to use to get you not to
25        find that the punishment was necessary through the clear and convincing evidence.
2              But you did, so I think you know where
3        you need to be.  I think you know where you
4        want to be.  176 billion.  A few billion a
5        year.  The MSA for Medicaid recovery, for
6        penalty money.  This is in the book.  This is
7        page 870.  They're paying a drop in the bucket.
8        Page 870.  It's important in Surgeon General
9        2014.
10              These are the documents that show at
11        page 18 that that which he said is safer was
12        determined by the public health authority not
13        to be safer.  To be just as dangerous, if not
14        more so.  And they couldn't say it's safer.
15        They're not allowed to say it's safer.  It
16        causes cancer.  It had toxicants.
17              So I think this part of their defense
18        with the fact that they --
19              MR. FURR:  Objection, personal opinion.
20              THE COURT:  Sustained, Counsel.  No
21        personal opinions.
22 Okay.
23              And then again, same thing here, what
24        they said on their website.  The question, what
25        kind of business are they in if they say:  All smokers should quit.  If you don't smoke, you
2        shouldn't start and youth shouldn't try
3        cigarettes.
4              If you were sincere, what does that say
5        about your business?  The only commonsense,
6        logical final conclusion to determine from that
7        is, you shouldn't be in business.
8              If my business is such that what I'm
9        selling, I'm telling people --
10              MR. FURR:  Objection, that's improper
11        argument.
12              THE COURT:  Sustained.
13 They say don't start.
14        If you're smoking, quit.  And kids should never
15        start.  You answered that question for
16        yourself.  Veni Vidi Vici.  He said the
17        industry was extremely powerful.
18              Prochaska explained that the tobacco
19        industry was funding studies and not disclosing
20        it and infiltrating and creating ambiguity, I
21        talked about that.  Talked about the deaths.
22              Annual cigarette volume.  That's what is
23        going to happen with Reynolds now that they
24        have the Lorillard brand.  That volume is going
25        to go up.  That market share is going to remain a strong number 2 to Philip Morris.
2              But the cigarette deaths haven't changed,
3        and the profits haven't changed.
4              As Dr. Proctor said, they are at the
5        total peak of death now.  Total peak of death
6        now.
7              So when we showed Lipowicz the different
8        cigarettes and which ones were safer and he put
9        them in order, they are no safer.  They all are
10        more deadly, especially with the filters that
11        have never been removed.  Especially with
12        inhalation, with pH that has never been
13        changed.  Lower inhalation that would make a
14        safer cigarette.  None of those things have
15        been done.
16              Glodine McCoy was 26.  The peak of death
17        kept going up.  It keeps going up.
18              Even today at 540,000 people a year in
19        the United States, 20 million since the 1964
20        Surgeon General's Report, they have not had a
21        success in putting forth a safer cigarette.
22              Had they have come clean, had they have
23        told the truth, there would have been a marked
24        drop in disease and death, and it would have
25        helped Glodine McCoy and millions of others. That is the kind of thing when you do
2        that on purpose, you should be punished.
3              Here is their money.  This is what they
4        make every single day.  This is just Reynolds
5        and Lorillard.
6              We don't have specific amounts in for
7        Philip Morris, but you know that together,
8        Reynolds and Lorillard are about 40 percent of
9        the business.  They are over 50 percent of the
10        business, so you can do --
11              MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection.
12 -- the extrapolation --
13              THE COURT:  Sustained.
14 But in any event,
15        $18 million a day is what they're making.
16        That's Reynolds and Lorillard.
17              Even with the lowered cigarette sales
18        board that you saw, going down, down, down,
19        look what doesn't go down.  Profits, 19 million
20        a day.  18 million a day.  18 million a day.
21              7 billion in profits.  That's after they
22        pay off the MSA.  7 billion in 2012, 2013,
23        2014.  Round it up, 6.7 to 6.9 billion.
24              Almost the same thing with Lorillard,
25        $18 billion a day. Here is what I say.  I would like to tell
2        you you should punish these folks and send a
3        very clear message on the order of a billion
4        dollars.  But I can't do it.  There is a limit
5        to the power.  It's got to be tied to Glodine
6        McCoy.  You said a million and a half.
7              I would like to say you should award
8        $100 million, $150 --
9              MR. FURR:  Objection, sustained.
10              THE COURT:  No opinions, Counsel.
11 Okay.
12              I will not ask for that amount.  What I
13        will say is, take from these defendants, punish
14        them, not for the -- for the month of trial
15        that we've been here, 20 million times --
16        20 million a day for any one of them times 30
17        days.  You see that kind of money, that's a lot
18        of money.  Hundreds of millions.
19              However, the amounts you should award and
20        write in on this ought to be -- may I have
21        this -- 15 million each.
22              MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  That's
23        an excessive request.  It violates the ratio.
24              THE COURT:  Thank you, Counsel.
25              Counsel, this is argument. SCHLESINGER:  Yes.
2              Now, remember, there are three defendants
3        in here, three amounts.  And what I say is,
4        again, this is a recommendation, you make the
5        ultimate decision.  That's $45 million total.
6              You can adjust it.  You can award more.
7        You can decide they should be punished more.
8        You can decide they should be punished less.
9        It's up to you.
10              But wherever you go with it, the range
11        should be substantial.  A million and a half
12        compensatory is not an amount with a company
13        that's making $18 million a day --
14              MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  That's
15        sales, not profits.  Misstatement.
16              THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, you are
17        to rely on your own recollection of the
18        evidence.
19 Is not a fair and
20        reasonable amount.  A small amount isn't
21        punishment.
22              You hold -- you hold -- you are at the
23        cutting edge of litigation, because the
24        punishment is not that commonly given against
25        these companies.  It isn't -- FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.
2              MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection.
3              THE COURT:  Sustained.
4 You are at the cutting
5        edge of litigation.  Here is what I say you
6        hold.  You hold a spear.  You are the tip of
7        the spear, the point of litigation.  You're the
8        point of an event.  The state of the art, the
9        cutting edge of lawsuits against tobacco
10        companies that you know are going on here in
11        Florida.
12              You may not run them through with your
13        spear.  You can't impale them and kill them,
14        because you are not permitted to put them out
15        of business, and we are not asking you to.
16              This is Glo McCoy.  One rope across
17        Gulliver's chest.
18              However, you are allowed to nudge them
19        with your spear, to prod them into a direction.
20        And you may draw a little blood, because you're
21        supposed to hurt them, and it's not supposed to
22        feel good.
23              But if you do draw a little blood, it
24        will get their attention and tell them through
25        their verdict that in the strongest terms, we want you to change.
2              And you will be just with them.  This
3        amount, you can adjust upward, downward.  You
4        may decide it should be less.  Whatever you do
5        decide, the lower limit should exceed
6        $10 million.
7              I don't like saying that.  The upper
8        limit should not exceed a total of this amount,
9        but if you give a range and you go below this,
10        please think in terms of a meaningful amount
11        that is a meaningful punishment under the
12        circumstances of this case, should be no lower
13        than 10 to $12-1/2 million.  That should be the
14        bottom.
15              I told you with compensatory damages, you
16        can award anything you want, and you still can.
17        But I think that this amount --
18              MR. FURR:  Objection, personal.
19              THE COURT:  Sustained.
20              Counsel, no personal opinions.
21 Yes.
22              I think the evidence supports, because of
23        their earnings --
24              MR. FURR:  Same objection, Your Honor.
25              THE COURT:  Sustained. SCHLESINGER:  The evidence supports
2        because of the earnings and because of the
3        reprehensibility of their conduct a punitive
4        damage award of up to $15 million per
5        defendant.
6              And I would also urge you, if you do a
7        smaller amount, not to max -- not to go below
8        $10 million in total punitive damages against
9        these companies if you want to give a
10        meaningful statement of rejection of what they
11        have to say.
12              Again, it's completely up to you.
13              Can I have my --
14              Dr. Proctor said the business about
15        making profits and saving lives was not what
16        they're about.
17              It's true.  The profits were more
18        important than the public health.  Newport was
19        a growth brand.  Not blue E-cigs, we talked
20        about that.  That's what they're selling.
21        That's where the business is.  Blue E-cigs,
22        they got rid of.  I told you about that.
23              And here is what Dr. Garner said:  Can
24        you see this is somewhat at odds with the
25        concept of migrating people to nonsmokable products.
2              He said:  Can I promise.
3              And before you do, do you agree it's a
4        little bit at odds.
5              He said:  I think it could feel a little
6        bit odd.
7              And he admitted to the menthol product
8        being the biggest.
9              He says:  I think it could be a little
10        bit odd.
11              And I started this, but where he said,
12        "I'd like to comment," his comment was:  It's
13        going to take time.  It's going to take time.
14              That's why I showed you the holding
15        strategy document.
16              How much time.  Time is On Their Side.
17        That's that Rolling Stones song I mentioned to
18        you.  Time is On Their Side.
19              I told you what kind of business are they
20        in if they want nobody to smoke, and they want
21        everybody to quit.  What kind of business are
22        they in.  This is the simple truth.  I showed
23        this to you before.
24              This is what they said.  We can't defend
25        continued smoking as free choice if the person was addicted.
2              And here is something I think is
3        important.  Lest some lawyer be looking over
4        our shoulder, I do not concede that even one
5        person dies of a chronic disease that is caused
6        by smoking cigarettes.
7              Acknowledgment, making amends, coming
8        clean.  That's what mitigation is.  You've not
9        seen that.
10              The proof is in the pudding.  They're not
11        doing it.  They're selling like they always
12        were.  They haven't changed a bit.  And -- let
13        me look at my notes for one second.
14              I will have a few minutes, about 15 or so
15        minutes to address you on rebuttal.
16              I will tell you that we thank you for
17        your time.  No matter what you decide to do, my
18        clients thank you.
19              John McCoy thanks you for the time, the
20        attention, the effort you've put into this.
21              I wish you really good luck at arriving
22        at a just result in this case.  Thank you.


19 May it please the
20        Court.
21              Thanks, folks.  The last licks, as they
22        say.  I know you've heard more than enough.  I
23        can tell you're ready.  I know you're ready.
24              I recommended an amount of $15 million
25        apiece for all three of the folks.  And, I mean, I'm trying to read body language, and I
2        could see some folks thinking about that.  But
3        I was glad I did.
4              Because when I heard the amount of money
5        that they recommended --
6              MR. FURR:  Objection, counsel's personal
7        opinion.
8              THE COURT:  Sustained.
9 I submit to you that
10        the amount of money they recommended for the
11        punishment that you have already decided that
12        they should be subjected to --
13              MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.
14              THE COURT:  Overruled.
15 It was -- it was --
16        insultingly inadequate --
17              MR. FURR:  Objection.
18 -- to punish.
19              THE COURT:  What is the objection?
20              MR. FURR:  He is attacking defense in the
21        case, Your Honor.
22              THE COURT:  Thank you.
23              This is argument, Counsel.  You put out
24        numbers, he's allowed to put out numbers.
25              Proceed. MR. SCHLESINGER:  Was insultingly
2        inadequate to punish a multi-billion-dollar
3        industry that combined here holds over
4        90 percent of the market, tens of billions of
5        dollars in profits, tens of millions of dollars
6        a day.
7              And we're not asking you to just take
8        away a couple of days of profit to make what
9        they did to Glodine McCoy profoundly
10        unprofitable, and to speak to them in a way
11        that lets them know that.
12              So their numbers are extremely
13        unreasonable, and the great news is you all are
14        going to make the decision.  You all are going
15        to make the decision.
16              But make it so that it is capable of
17        causing some punishment, some kind of pain.
18              And what Mr. Furr talked about, and I
19        want to talk to you about, is that this jury
20        instruction talks about punitive damages being
21        awarded against defendant, based on the conduct
22        that is your finding that the defendants are
23        liable to the plaintiff for -- he said
24        conspiracy, but here is what it says.
25              This is the instruction:  Fraudulent concealment and conspiracy to fraudulently
2        conceal.
3              So they committed fraud.  That's lying,
4        to get people to be faked out to do something.
5        They defrauded my client.  And because you
6        consider harms to others, so many millions of
7        other people -- of other folks.
8              That's an intentional wrongdoing.  It's
9        on purpose.  It resulted in death of a scale
10        that is unimaginable and not equal to anything
11        else that's ever happened in this country.
12              MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Williams-State
13        Farm.
14              THE COURT:  Thank you.
15              Objection noted.  It's overruled.
16 I wish -- I wish that
17        it were true.  I wish that it were true --
18              MR. FURR:  Objection, counsel's personal
19        opinion, Your Honor.
20              THE COURT:  Sustained.
21              Counsel, no personal opinions.
22 -- that they were no
23        longer targeting kids, that they were a changed
24        company.
25              But sadly, their actions speak louder than their words.  They talked about don't
2        punish us because Claude Teague is gone.
3              You're not punishing Claude Teague.
4        You're not punishing Rodgman and Cullman and so
5        many other people that you saw on that board of
6        conspirators.
7              You're punishing the corporation that
8        hired those people for the acts and conducts
9        that they committed while in the course and
10        scope of their employment with the guilty
11        entity; that is, Reynolds, Lorillard and Philip
12        Morris.  That's what's being punished.
13              The absence of prior folks who are now
14        replaced by folks who are ongoing, the
15        continuing business plan of addicting
16        vulnerable children and causing their death
17        with combustible products from smoking, that's
18        what -- and lying about it, and hiding it, and
19        concealing it.
20              Offering up false illusions of hope with
21        phony filters and light cigarettes.  And still
22        doing it to this day, so that these Surgeon
23        Generals -- magazines that are telling us
24        everything that's going on right now are
25        unchanged. In one of the documents -- I don't have
2        time to read, look at page 34 of Surgeon
3        General 2014.  Look at page 34.  Focusing on
4        the industry, of all of the extensive campaign
5        of tobacco to counteract all the forces through
6        marketing, public relation, political
7        influence, creation of doubt about the
8        scientific evidence on tobacco.  And these are
9        now well documented in the internal documents.
10              The industry used its influence to thwart
11        public health action on all levels and
12        fraudulently misled the public on many issues,
13        including that lower yield cigarettes created
14        less risk to health and exposure to secondhand
15        smoke was unharmful to nonsmokers.
16              Undoubtedly, these actions slowed tobacco
17        control.  Meaning, when you block -- when you
18        block smoking cessation, when you block
19        Merrell Dow, decades ago we could have been
20        studying and researching how to help people
21        stop smoking.  We could be reducing the
22        addictiveness.
23              That's what the draft guidance tells
24        Dr. Garner, who finally admitted they want us
25        to reduce the addictiveness. What is your department to reduce
2        addictiveness?  Nobody.  Nothing.  That's
3        already played, that video for you.
4              So it's important to remember that.  And
5        you're going to be -- also, Mr. Tepikian was
6        talking to you about punitive damages, and now
7        they come in here and they say you shouldn't
8        award any punitive damages.  Really?
9              That's -- that's the level in which
10        they've changed, and they've come clean, and
11        they say -- well, here is what he said in his
12        opening statement:  Plaintiff will have an
13        opportunity to put on witnesses.  Reynolds and
14        Lorillard will have an opportunity to put on
15        witnesses.  Philip Morris will.  We'll have
16        additional closing arguments --
17              MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor,
18        reading from my opening statement.
19              THE COURT:  Objection noted.  It's
20        overruled.
21 And then that's when
22        you would consider the amount, referring to
23        punitive damages.
24              He didn't tell you in opening statement
25        that he would suggest that you not award any punitive damages.
2              And talking about the 3100 cases and
3        whether it's 3 billion or 30 billion over what,
4        100 years.  How many of those 3100 cases
5        speculatively are going to result in punitive
6        damages awards that are going to be collected
7        after an appellate process that these folks --
8              MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.
9              THE COURT:  Sustained.
10 -- take to the United
11        States Supreme Court.
12              THE COURT:  I sustained the objection.
13        Move on.
14 It's speculative as to
15        what the outcome of those future cases are
16        going to be.
17              But if you are one who throws a rope
18        across the chest of Gulliver and -- like
19        Gulliver, you throw one more rope across the
20        chest.
21              And if over time, punishment damages do
22        add up to substantial amounts of money, even
23        into the billions, that effectuates change.
24        That tells a company, do something different.
25              If you look at this, this is what you said in the first part of the verdict.  By
2        clear and convincing evidence, are punitive
3        damages warranted against Reynolds, Philip
4        Morris, Lorillard?
5              Now, you didn't go back into that
6        courtroom, and we are honored that you did not,
7        and just say, okay, everybody agrees, let's
8        just check off the boxes and come right back
9        out.
10              You spent three days, you came back over
11        a weekend.  You dedicated yourself to honor
12        this process to participate in one of the most
13        important things you can do.
14              This verdict lasts forever.  It is a
15        lifetime achievement.  It is indelible.  It
16        will be written on the books, and it will stand
17        the testament of time, and it will be a
18        statement that we do not tolerate corporate
19        misconduct.
20              MR. FURR:  Objection.
21              MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection.
22              THE COURT:  Sustained.
23              MR. TEPIKIAN:  Move to strike.
24 It is perfectly
25        appropriate -- THE COURT:  Excuse me.
2              Ladies and gentlemen, please disregard
3        the last comments of counsel.
4              Counsel, you have five minutes.
5 Yes.
6              Change.  When you're considering the
7        amount of punitives, the extent of which
8        circumstances have changed.
9              And I've told you.  And I got up on my --
10        yes, I'll call this my soapbox.  Keep it out of
11        the reach of children.  Keep the Camels out of
12        the reach of children.
13              What are those $10 billion a year in
14        price discounts and price promotions besides
15        the sensual and seductive advertisements in the
16        magazines.  Buy one, get one free.  BOGO.  Why
17        is that?
18              Look in Surgeon General 2012.  Lowering
19        the price makes it easier for youth and
20        children to get the cigarettes.  The price
21        point keeps it out of the reach of children.
22        High prices keeps it out of the reach of
23        children.
24              But like any drug that is being sold,
25        it's that first dose.  And you know those kids, you learned that from Prochaska.  Those first
2        doses begin the process of addiction.  Get the
3        menthol.  Get that first dose in and set that
4        hook.  That is immoral, reprehensible, immoral.
5              MR. FURR:  Objection.
6              THE COURT:  Sustained.
7              MR. FURR:  Move to strike, Your Honor.
8              THE COURT:  Jurors disregard the last
9        comments.
10 It's a reprehensible
11        business plan.  That's what he said.  That's
12        when you consider the amount.  He didn't say
13        we're going to tell you not to offer any money.
14              And then there is what Charles Garner
15        agreed to.  This is what they're supposed to be
16        doing:  Bold, innovative steps to reduce or
17        eliminate the toxicity and the addictiveness of
18        smoking, correct?
19              ANSWER:  Correct, yes.
20              And we're at the peak of death.  They
21        haven't done that at all.  And that's important
22        to consider.
23              So there is no new evidence from the
24        first part of the case when they said don't
25        award punitive damages. And Robert Proctor said everything about
2        this makes it easier for younger smokers.
3              And he didn't say -- he didn't say that
4        those folks were fired.
5              Here's the complete quote:  Because they
6        were not fired, but they did have a public
7        relations debacle.  But there is no evidence
8        that they were ever fired.
9              The evidence was they were gone not too
10        soon after raising their hand and lying to
11        Congress and having a public relations
12        disaster, which gave rise to a lot of what you
13        were seeing here today.
14              And nobody should get credit for taking
15        20 years to delay litigation.  Nobody should
16        get credit by saying we've taken so long --
17              MR. TEPIKIAN:  Objection, Your Honor.
18              THE COURT:  Overruled.
19 -- to bring this case
20        to justice that it no longer matters, that it's
21        irrelevant.
22              There was a juror that said that who was
23        excused.  She said:  She's been dead 20 years,
24        it's irrelevant.  She's not a juror in this
25        case. MR. FURR:  Objection.
2              THE COURT:  Counsel, just talk about the
3        evidence in this case.
4 Okay.
5              The evidence in this case is, 20 years
6        notwithstanding everything these companies are
7        doing the same.  These Surgeon General Reports
8        laid out book and page.
9              And the other thing that Robert Proctor
10        never said was about getting rid of cigarettes
11        is that he said they should be legal.
12              He answered a question that Mr. Furr
13        skillfully put to him about Congress has kept
14        it legal.  The name of his book calls for the
15        case for abolition.  Abolition is the
16        elimination of cigarettes.
17              This is what the Surgeon General 2014
18        says should happen right now.  The burden of
19        death and disease from tobacco use in the
20        United States is overwhelmingly caused by
21        cigarettes and other combusted tobacco
22        products.
23              That's why we bought Newport instead of
24        Blu e-cigarettes to migrate -- that's
25        hypocritical -- and it says right here:  Rapid elimination of their use will dramatically
2        reduce this burden.
3              It's legal.  Cigarettes are legal.  It
4        isn't legal to sell them to children.  It isn't
5        legal to entice children.  Underage smoking is
6        not legal.  Enticing underage smoking is not
7        legal.
8              And the Surgeon General themselves calls
9        for an end gauge strategy to ending the tobacco
10        epidemic in this country and their
11        pronouncement -- and they are conservative, and
12        there are hundreds of scientists and years that
13        go into this publication.
14              Federal government Public Health Service
15        for the benefit of all Americans, you, me,
16        McCoy, the fine lawyers for the tobacco
17        companies, all to be helped by these public
18        health authorities, the Surgeon General, they
19        themselves are saying rapid elimination will
20        dramatically reduce this burden.
21              THE COURT:  Counsel, two minutes.
22 Yes, sir.
23              So we talked about this, and you've seen
24        this, deliberately misleading the public on the
25        risks of smoking.  That's fresh news as of 2014.
2              Unfortunately, the changes have not
3        occurred.  Mitigation in the form of making
4        amends has not occurred.  And this is the
5        attitude they take -- and you remember, I put
6        this up, because you remember when we talked to
7        Dr. Garner, when we talked to Lipowicz -- but
8        especially -- Lipowicz --
9              MR. TEPIKIAN:  Lipowicz.
10 Lipowicz.
11        Dr. Lipowicz, I'll get it right.
12              And Dr. Garner especially was, couldn't
13        get him to acknowledge a single death caused by
14        cigarettes.
15              Even to this day, couldn't get him to
16        just plain straight-up agree without hemming
17        and hawing and dodging that cigarettes cause
18        disease.  Instead, the word "risk."  Risk
19        implies maybe, maybe not.  The doubt campaign.
20        Maybe it does.  Maybe it doesn't.
21              More people have climbed that mountain
22        than have seen a verdict rendered --
23              MR. FURR:  Objection.
24              THE COURT:  Sustained.
25              Counsel, sustained.  You need to wrap it up.
2 And I will, Judge.
3              Today, at this point, it's not where the
4        money is going to.  Nobody is going to talk
5        about whatever charitable intent my client has.
6              The bottom line is that this is about
7        where the money is coming from.
8              And you get to speak to them in the only
9        language they understand, and that is the
10        language of money.
11              And that is the point of just this case
12        is, and this is where this case ends.  Suffice
13        to say, however it gets used by this family, we
14        would suggest it's better used than marketing
15        to kids or buying Reynolds product Newport,
16        buying Newport and saying that that's migrating
17        to nonsmokable products.
18              MR. FURR:  Objection, time, Your Honor.
19              THE COURT:  Excuse me.  Thank you,
20        Counsel.  I'm keeping track.
21              You need to wrap it up, Mr. Schlesinger.
22 This is an opportunity
23        to come to some attempt to protect the next
24        generation from tobacco-induced suffering.
25              And you play an important role in that, right here in Broward County, to contribute in
2        some small way to accomplishing that goal.
3              THE COURT:  Counsel, can I see you
4        sidebar, please.
5              (The following discussion was held at
6              sidebar:)
7              THE COURT:  You need to wrap up.
8 I need 30 seconds and
9        I'm done.  I'm done.
10              THE COURT:  Thank you.
11              (Sidebar discussion concluded, and the
12              following was held in open court:)
13 I would like to read
14        one -- I'm going to read this one brief thing
15        to you, and we're going to call it a morning
16        and turn this over to you completely.
17              George Orwell wrote a book called 1984,
18        and the book was made into a movie with Richard
19        Burton and John Hurt.  I don't know if any of
20        you saw it.
21              1984, some of us had to read it in
22        school.  Gotta tell you the truth, I didn't
23        read it.  But I saw the movie.  And here is the
24        quote I want to read to you.
25              MR. FURR:  Your Honor -- THE COURT:  This is argument, Counsel.
2 Richard Burton's
3        character is standing over John Hurt's
4        character, about to go into him, and he says:
5        Above all -- and above all, we do not allow the
6        dead to rise up against us.  You must stop
7        imagining that posterity will vindicate you,
8        Winston.  Posterity will never hear of you.
9              You will be lifted clean out from the
10        stream of history.  We shall turn you into a
11        gas and pour you into the stratosphere.
12        Nothing will remain of you, not a name in a
13        register, not a memory in a living brain.  You
14        will have been annihilated in the past, as well
15        as in the future.  You will never have existed.
16              And the reason that I want to say to you,
17        that no matter what you do from this point
18        forward, we thank you.
19              And on behalf of John McCoy and the
20        entire McCoy family, we thank you, because you
21        did not let this happen to Glodine McCoy.
22              You registered her name in history, and
23        history will remember her, and that's thanks to
24        you.  And we are honored to be able to present
25        this to you.  Thank you. THE COURT:  Counsel, thank you.
2              Members of the jury, you have now heard
3        all of the evidence, my instructions on the law
4        that you must apply in reaching your verdict,
5        and the closing arguments of the attorneys.
6              You will shortly retire to the jury room
7        to decide this case.
8              As I instructed you previously, during
9        deliberations, you must communicate about the
10        case only with one another and only when all
11        jurors are present in the jury room.
12              You will have in the jury room all of the
13        evidence you have received during the trial.
14              In reaching your decision, do not do any
15        research on your own or as a group.  Do not use
16        dictionaries, the internet or any other
17        reference materials.  Do not investigate the
18        case or conduct any experiments.
19              Do not visit or view the scene of any
20        event involved in this case or look at maps or
21        pictures on the internet.
22              If you happen to pass by the scene, do
23        not stop or investigate.
24              All jurors must see or hear the same
25        evidence at the same time.  Do not listen -- excuse me -- do not read, listen to, or watch
2        any news accounts of this trial.  You are not
3        to communicate with any person outside the jury
4        about this case.
5              Until you have reached a verdict, you
6        must not talk about this case in person or
7        through the telephone, in writing or electronic
8        communication, such as a blog, Twitter, email,
9        text message, or any other means at all.
10              Do not contact anyone to assist you, such
11        as a family accountant, doctor or lawyer.
12              These communication rules apply until I
13        discharge you at the end of the case.
14              If you become aware of any violation of
15        these instructions or any other instruction
16        I've given you in this case, you must tell me
17        by passing a note to the bailiff.
18              Again, ladies and gentlemen, any notes
19        you've taken during the trial may be taken to
20        the jury room for your use during your
21        discussions.
22              Your notes are simply an aid to your own
23        memory.  Neither your notes or the notes of any
24        other juror are binding or conclusive.  Your
25        notes are not a substitute for your own memory or that of other jurors.
2              Instead, your verdict must result from
3        the collective memory and judgment of all
4        jurors based on the evidence and testimony
5        presented during the trial.
6              At the conclusion of the trial, the
7        bailiff will collect all of your notes and
8        immediately destroy them.  No one will ever
9        read your notes.
10              In reaching your verdict, do not let
11        bias, sympathy, prejudice, public opinion or
12        any other sentiment for or against any party to
13        influence your verdict.
14              Your verdict must be based on the
15        evidence that has been received and the law on
16        which I have instructed you.  Reaching a
17        verdict is exclusively your job.  I cannot
18        participate in that decision in any way.
19              And you should not guess what you
20        think -- you should not guess what I think your
21        verdict should be from something that I may
22        have said or done.
23              You should not think that I prefer one
24        verdict over another.
25              Therefore, in reaching your verdict, you should not consider anything that I have said
2        or done, except for my specific instructions to
3        you.
4              Pay careful attention to all the
5        instructions that I gave you, for that is the
6        law that must follow.
7              You will have a copy of my instructions
8        with you when you go to the jury room to
9        deliberate.
10              All of the instructions are important,
11        and you must consider all of them together.
12        There are no other laws that apply to this
13        case, and even if you do not agree with these
14        laws, you must use them in reaching your
15        decision in this case.
16              When you go to the jury room, the first
17        thing you should do is choose a presiding
18        jurors to act as a foreperson during your
19        deliberations.
20              The foreperson again should see that your
21        discussions are orderly and that everyone has a
22        fair chance to be heard.
23              It is your duty to talk with one another
24        in the jury room and to consider the views of
25        all jurors. Each of you must decide the case for
2        yourself, but only after you've considered the
3        evidence with the other members of the jury.
4              You can feel free to change your mind if
5        you are convinced that your position should be
6        different.
7              You should all try to agree, but do not
8        give up your honest beliefs just because others
9        think differently.  Keep an open mind so that
10        you and your fellow jurors can easily share
11        ideas about the case.
12              I will give you a verdict form with
13        questions that you must answer.  I've already
14        instructed you on the law that you are to use
15        in answering these instructions.
16              You must follow my instructions and the
17        form carefully.  You must consider each
18        question separately, although there's only one
19        question.
20              Please answer the questions in the order
21        it appears.  And after you answer the question,
22        the form tells you what to do.
23              Ladies and gentlemen, I will now read the
24        form of verdict for you.  This is the verdict
25        form.  It has, again, the style of the case that's above the line.
2              The style reads as follows:  In the
3        Circuit Court of the 17th Judicial Circuit in
4        and for Broward County, Florida, Complex
5        Litigation Unit, Case Number 08-80000,
6        Division 19, Judge John J. Murphy, III.
7              In Re: Engle Progeny Cases, Tobacco
8        Litigation, Pertains to John McCoy.  Case
9        Number 08-025806.
10              Verdict form.  We the jury return the
11        following verdict.
12              Question 1:  What is the total amount of
13        punitive damages, if any, which you find by the
14        greater weight of the evidence should be
15        assessed against each defendant?
16              And there's three lines here.  It says:
17        R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, and then you
18        fill in the appropriate amount, if any.
19              Then the next line has Philip Morris USA,
20        Inc., and you fill in the appropriate amount,
21        if any.
22              Then Lorillard Tobacco Company, again,
23        fill in the appropriate amount, if any.
24              If you elect not to assess punitive
25        damages against a defendant, you should enter a zero as the amount of damages.
2              And then it goes on, says:  Please sign
3        and date the verdict form, so say we all this
4        blank day of July, 2015.
5              Again, it's signed by the foreperson down
6        here.  The foreperson should print their name
7        there.
8              Ladies and gentlemen, again, your verdict
9        must be unanimous.  That is, your verdict must
10        be agreed to by each of you.
11              When you have agreed on your verdict,
12        your foreperson must write the date and sign at
13        the bottom and return it to the bailiff.
14              If any of you need to communicate with me
15        for any reason, please write down your note or
16        pass it to the bailiff.
17              In your note, do not disclose your vote
18        or split or the reason for the communication.
19              Ladies and gentlemen, the evidence as
20        well as the verdict form will shortly accompany
21        you into the jury room, as well as the lunch
22        that was previously ordered.
23              Just take your notepads with you and your
24        jury instructions.
25              All right.  You may retire to commence your deliberations.  Thank you, ladies and
2        gentlemen.
3              Al.
