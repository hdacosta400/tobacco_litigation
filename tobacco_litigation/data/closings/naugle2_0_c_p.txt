 9             MR. UUSTAL:  The first time Cindy became
10         critically ill was 2009, but she pulled through.
11         She went back to work.  She fought her way
12         through rehab and then went back to work and she
13         lived on her own on oxygen for years.
14             This June she got very sick again.  You
15         heard that Dr. Singer described it as a near
16         fatal event.  But she pulled through and fought
17         through rehab and got home.
18             The day this trial started she went back in
19         the hospital and she was intubated and then she
20         got better.  You heard about that last week.
21         The tube came out.  But on Friday when her
22         brother testified he told you that things had
23         taken a turn for the worse again.  She had to be
24         reintubated.
25             When she got the tube out last week, it

 1         looked like 1999 in June.
 2             This is a deposition you saw that was taken
 3         just a month ago.
 4             (Video clip was played and taken down to the
 5   best of the reporter's ability as follows:)
 6             VOICE:  Nobody has told me I had a life
 7         expectancy of 24.  Who knows.  I'm going to
 8         live.  I'm a fighter, I told you that, one way
 9         or another.
10             (Video clip concluded.)
11             MR. UUSTAL:  She's only 65.  She's always
12         fought off infections before.  But they did have
13         to reintubate her.  And then this Sunday one of
14         the doctors in the medical record recorded the
15         prognosis as terminal.
16             So we have been trying to get you the
17         records as they come in.  We obviously don't get
18         them immediately, but that is the latest record
19         you have.  And based on this, you can -- and you
20         need to disregard the testimony that we
21         presented to you on her future life care needs,
22         her life care plan and the medical treatment
23         that she would need over the next six to ten
24         years should she live that long.
25             Dr. Coopersmith told you that he, you know,

 1         he was doing his best to come up with a number
 2         but that no one really knows.  And that's still
 3         true.  No one knows.  But we have to prove
 4         anything in this case by the greater weight of
 5         the evidence as more likely than not.  And at
 6         this point with the record that says terminal,
 7         you cannot award anything from that life care
 8         plan.  We agree with that.
 9             So why does this trial matter even right now
10         to Cindy?
11             This litigation started almost 20 years ago.
12         The plaintiffs were a group of smokers and they
13         proved that smoking was addictive and that
14         cigarettes were harmful.  It wasn't admitted.
15         It was proved in a court of law.
16             And then after that went all the way to the
17         Supreme Court those group of smokers had to
18         proceed and continue with the case each on their
19         own.  And Cindy did that.  She had her first
20         trial in 2009 that was just her divided into two
21         phases and again she proved -- three week trial,
22         the first trial was a year, you didn't hear any
23         of that evidence.  You're getting findings from
24         these trials.  So you don't have to sit through
25         a year of evidence.  You don't have to sit

 1         through three weeks of evidence.  And those
 2         findings of those prior juries are binding on
 3         you.
 4             And this jury in 2009 in those two phases
 5         found that she was addicted, that the cigarettes
 6         were defective that she smoked and that the
 7         conspiracy that Philip Morris engaged in to
 8         defraud smokers contributed to her emphysema.
 9         That's established.
10             So for that reason what you're deciding in
11         this trial is, one, how that harmed her, what
12         her emphysema has done to her, and two, should a
13         company that engages in an intentional
14         conspiracy, who lies about a deadly addictive
15         drug and that causes untold suffering and harm
16         from those lies, should that be punished?  And
17         Philip Morris has told you in opening statement
18         that in their view the answer to that is no.
19             It was a long path.  It was a long way for
20         anyone to go, but Cindy is a fighter.  And we
21         are so close now to the finish line.  She is
22         going to finish this lawsuit, and she is still
23         going to make a difference in this world.
24             So let me just give you a summary of the
25         evidence.  I'm not going to spend too long on

 1         this because you've already seen the evidence.
 2         I just want to put it together in a
 3         chronological way that you haven't seen it
 4         before.
 5             There was a health scare here.  And I want
 6         to be -- first of all, we do not dispute that
 7         there was plenty of information in the public
 8         about the possible harmful effects of smoking.
 9         That was the whole reason they started the
10         conspiracy was the first health scare.  We don't
11         dispute that at all.  And, in fact, in 2009
12         Cindy admitted that she was also at fault.  She
13         admitted that.  And the jury agreed and found
14         her partially at fault.  She said she should
15         have quit.  But they should have quit lying.
16             So this was in the news.  This was big news
17         about the harmful -- possible harmful effects of
18         smoking.  And so that is why with that health
19         scare the presidents and the CEOs of all the
20         major tobacco companies came together at the
21         Plaza Hotel in New York City for weeks in
22         December 1953.  They stayed through Christmas.
23         There were research directors from the
24         corporations there and the press -- public
25         relations company, because this was a public

 1         relations problem for them.
 2             And so during the course of this weeks of
 3         actually the presidents and CEOs of major
 4         American corporations all meeting together and
 5         their research directors they came up with a
 6         plan.  But the first thing I want to make it
 7         clear, forget about all the scientific articles
 8         in their files, all the tobacco companies
 9         showing the tests they did, showing what they
10         knew about smoking, the -- right there in the
11         Plaza Hotel the public relations firm talked to
12         the executives and the -- specifically the
13         research directors of the cigarette companies.
14         And two of the comments that they recorded tell
15         you what the cigarette companies knew even then
16         on those two issues.  "It's fortunate for us
17         that cigarettes are a habit they can't break."
18         I'm not even going to talk about the fortunate
19         part.  But they knew.  A habit they can't break.
20         They didn't say it's a habit that's hard to
21         break.  A habit they can't break.
22             And two, one of them said, "Boy, wouldn't it
23         be wonderful if our company was the first to
24         produce a cancer-free cigarette."
25             How much money would they make if you can

 1         sell an addictive drug that's no longer deadly?
 2         But the point is they knew that it was harmful.
 3             So what did they decide to do?  And the
 4         whole conspiracy that lasted 50 years was based
 5         on this, reassure the smoker.  Maybe there's a
 6         risk but it's not something to worry about right
 7         now.  You can always worry about later, and it's
 8         so small, it's too infinitesimal to worry about.
 9         Should you eat butter or not eat butter, maybe
10         butter is bad for you, that's what they wanted
11         people to think about cigarettes.  And that was
12         the genius in that time frame.  So they can
13         still come in here and show you -- and it's true
14         there were lots of things in the press about
15         cigarettes being harmful but the genius of what
16         they did was to take that and make people feel
17         is wasn't a giant, it's a small acceptable risk,
18         like eating butter.
19             Too infinitesimal to worry about, that's
20         what they wanted to convince people.  Let the
21         scientists do the worrying for us, that's their
22         business.  And meanwhile let us go on eating,
23         working, playing, smoking, relaxing, and living
24         a good life every day.
25             So as part of the public relations push you

 1         saw they published this Frank Statement.  The
 2         point I want to focus on is the second sentence
 3         that we pulled out.  "We believe the products we
 4         make are not injurious to health."  They had
 5         just said, they had just said -- I'll slow down.
 6         I apologize -- the research directors, boy,
 7         wouldn't it be great if we could produce the
 8         first cancer-free cigarette.  And you've seen
 9         through Dr. Cummings what was in their files.
10             Cindy was seven years old in 1955, a couple
11         years after that meeting in the Plaza Hotel.
12         What does all this matter to her?
13             You do have to take a moment and understand
14         the world she grew up in, okay.  She had already
15         formed an idea of what the world was like.  And
16         she literally saw hundreds of times a day people
17         she respected picking up a cigarette.  How could
18         it be so horrible of a thing to do, so deadly,
19         so crazy, when everywhere around her, her dad,
20         ministers, judges, doctors, everywhere around
21         her people smoking?  And to say that we cannot
22         understand if we didn't live at the time or may
23         even be hard to remember, cigarette advertising
24         was just omnipresent, the largest single
25         advertiser in the country.  And all those

 1         messages she's getting.  And those are
 2         sophisticated advertising messages designed to
 3         appeal to people.  So that's how she's formed.
 4         Yeah, cigarettes, maybe somebody is saying that
 5         something could be wrong, but she's willing --
 6         she's a perfect victim for which they set up for
 7         people like this.
 8             Just a couple of the ads from that -- if we
 9         could show it real quick, Baron.
10             (Video clip was played and taken down to the
11   best of the reporter's ability as follows:)
12             VOICE:  Tens of thousands of doctors,
13         doctors in all parts of the country in every
14         state of the union, doctors in every branch of
15         medicine were asked:  What cigarette do you
16         smoke, Doctor?  Brand named most was Camel.
17         Yes, according to the survey, more doctors smoke
18         Camel.
19             VOICE:  When you change to Philip Morris,
20         you'll feel better.
21             VOICE:  Did you say I'll feel better smoking
22         Philip Morris?
23             VOICE:  Yes, you'll feel better.
24             VOICE:  Lucy.
25             VOICE:  Yes, dear.

 1             VOICE:  Give me a cigarette, will you?
 2             VOICE:  Don't say cigarettes, say
 3         Philip Morris.
 4             VOICE:  Oh, is there any other kind?
 5             VOICE:  Not for you there isn't.  Nothing
 6         but the best for Mr. Ricardo.
 7             You see how easy it is to keep a man happy.
 8         Why not give your husband a carton of
 9         Philip Morris cigarettes.
10             VOICE:  Do you inhale?  Then you're better
11         off smoking Philip Morris, and here's how you
12         can prove it.  Light up a Philip Morris, take a
13         puff, get a good mouthful of smoke and slowly
14         let the smoke come to --
15             VOICE:  I got a better idea.  Let's take a
16         Winston break.
17             VOICE:  That's it, Winston is the one filter
18         cigarette that delivers flavor 20 times a pack.
19         Winston has got that filter blend.
20             VOICE:  Yeah, Fred.
21             VOICE:  I tell ya, Pearl, Winston is good
22         smoking.  Sure wish you could taste it.
23             VOICE:  I am tasting it, Granny.
24             VOICE:  The dickens you say.
25             VOICE:  Benson & Hedges 100s are the new

 1         longer filter cigarettes, three puffs longer,
 2         four puffs longer, maybe five puffs longer than
 3         king size.  Once you get the hang of them.
 4             (Video clip concluded.)
 5             MR. UUSTAL:  So these are all different
 6         cigarette companies and, you know, it's really
 7         impossible to recreate the constant TV
 8         advertising and really give you an idea of what
 9         it was like, but billboards and magazines and
10         everywhere.  And lots of health ads suggesting
11         of doctors and health and why this particular
12         cigarette is better.  And these are all going to
13         be in evidence.  And famous people and movie
14         stars smoking.  And it's just -- the idea was
15         created intentionally that smoking is an
16         acceptable risk, an infinitesimal risk, not that
17         it's proven to be safe.
18             So that carried through until 1964 when
19         again another health scare, the Surgeon General
20         Report.  And, yes, it was covered, it was out
21         there.  It was a lot, that's the whole reason
22         they're doing the conspiracy.
23             So they had to come up with a new plan.
24         They had to change things a little bit.  So at
25         this point -- and by the way, I've tried here in

 1         this presentation to focus on Philip Morris
 2         documents because of the cross of Dr. Cummings
 3         about documents in other tobacco company files.
 4         But they got together, they met, they planned.
 5         It was a conspiracy.  When you engage in a
 6         legal -- when you engage in an illegal
 7         conspiracy, you are responsible for the acts of
 8         all the other conspirators.  If you conspire to
 9         rob a bank, you can't say, well, I wasn't the
10         one digging the tunnel.  If it's in furtherance
11         of the conspiracy you're responsible for all the
12         acts of the conspiracy.
13             So at this point they said, look, we need to
14         get a psychological crutch and a self-rationale
15         to give smokers so they can continue smoking.
16         Study the psychology of the smoker in search of
17         information that could increase corporate
18         profits.  And they stumbled upon the illusion of
19         filtration.
20             See, because this was a time we're putting
21         men into space and science seems like they can
22         solve anything.  How could it not solve the
23         cigarette problem if there is one?
24             And people were willing to believe that.
25         The problem is on the bottom we have the

 1         Philip Morris internal document that's in
 2         evidence that you will see, "Present technology
 3         does not permit the selective filtration of
 4         particulate smoke."
 5             They knew that.  You heard later how the
 6         Surgeon General eventually figured it out, but
 7         they knew it right in 1961.  Still, they're
 8         telling, again and again, you can count on the
 9         cigarette companies to take anything out of your
10         cigarettes if science ever really finds any such
11         hazard in the wonderful tobacco leaf.  Message
12         after message because it works.  They stumbled
13         on that, the illusion of filtration, and it
14         worked.
15             And they say, "The belief appears to be
16         widely held that filtered cigarettes are less
17         hazardous."  It worked.  What they were saying
18         worked, not the filters.
19             Even convinced the government.  And
20         remember, the Surgeon General eventually said,
21         we got fooled.  But at that time they're saying,
22         hey, yeah, smoke a filter.
23             In 2010 the Surgeon General says filters did
24         not create morbidity, immortality, it did not
25         decrease -- I'm sorry, it did not decrease

 1         disease or death.
 2             Used by the tobacco industry as a tool to
 3         undermine prevention, it's not just me saying
 4         it, it's not just the prior juries, Surgeon
 5         General, and unfortunately it took us a long
 6         time to realize what the cigarette manufacturers
 7         already knew.  And you saw documents that said
 8         we just couldn't anticipate how the designers,
 9         the people who designed the cigarettes could
10         figure out ways to make cigarettes more
11         addictive and get around everything we were
12         trying to do, all the time knowing the present
13         technology didn't allow it.
14             So that was the filter.  The filter fraud,
15         as Dr. Cummings called it.
16             And by the way, Dr. Cummings, Dr. Cummings
17         has written parts of Surgeon General Reports,
18         it's been his career, public health.  That
19         yearlong trial he testified twice for free.
20         He's testifying here for free.  Public health is
21         important to him.
22             And there is one single greatest threat to
23         the public health in the United States, and it's
24         in this courtroom right now.  But they come up
25         with -- call it the filter fraud.  But there's a

 1         second strategy, doubt and confusion.  Because
 2         remember they said we just need a self-rationale
 3         to give the smoker an excuse, a psychological
 4         crutch to continue smoking.  Because the
 5         nicotine addict, highly addicted nicotine
 6         addict, and Dr. Cummings explained how there's
 7         different levels of nicotine addiction based on
 8         when you first start smoking and based on your
 9         genetics.  Some people are more susceptible to
10         nicotine addiction than other people.  But the
11         highly addicted nicotine addict, and this is in
12         Philip Morris documents too, will choose
13         nicotine over food in times of starvation.  The
14         brain actually physically changes and the body
15         craves nicotine more than food.  That's why you
16         see, and I'm sure you've seen this, some people
17         who after they've had some horrible
18         smoking-related illness they can't even smoke
19         through their month, they're still smoking
20         through a hole in their throat.  But that's the
21         highly addicted nicotine addict.
22             And all they had to give, certainly the
23         highly addicted, but even people who are less
24         addicted was an excuse, the psychological
25         crutch.  And they figured out how to do it..

 1         doubt is our product, that's what we're going to
 2         sell more of now.  If we sell doubt, don't
 3         worry, we'll sell cigarettes.
 4             The most important type of story, just
 5         remember the Tobacco Institute, Center For
 6         Tobacco Research, these are the fraudulent
 7         organizations, propaganda organizations they set
 8         up in 1953 at the Plaza Hotel which in the year
 9         1998 we killed as --
10             MR. MCCARTER:  Objection, Your Honor, to the
11         "we killed."
12             THE COURT:  Sustained.
13             Stick to the evidence, sir.
14             MR. UUSTAL:  But they're putting stories out
15         in the news and in newspapers, and they say the
16         most important type of story is which gives
17         doubt on the cause-and-effect theory of disease
18         and smoking.
19             Keyword is confusion.  From 1954 to 1998,
20         and I'm using those dates because that was in
21         the Surgeon General Report, they spent a billion
22         dollars on those organizations with that
23         propaganda.  They were sending out monthly
24         propaganda newsletters to a million people.  The
25         influence makers, people in Congress and doctors

 1         and leaders in the community all over the
 2         country.
 3             Just some of the things they were sending
 4         out, oh, smoking is related to -- is linked to
 5         cancer?  Well, March births are linked to
 6         cancer.  These are the type of studies.  They
 7         say, oh, epidemiologically they can prove that
 8         if you're born in March obviously that's not a
 9         cause of lung cancer, just like smoking, it's
10         just a statistical fluke.
11             And then Surgeon General said between 1940
12         and 2005, I have to have those years because
13         that's the number they give us, they spent, the
14         tobacco companies 250 billion dollars on
15         advertising creating a world reinforcing their
16         message.
17             So what does 250 million -- billion, billion
18         dollars buy?  Well, in 1967 we found out.  The
19         government looked into it and it said, "The
20         public is subjected to an endless barrage of
21         radio and television commercials that keep
22         pounding away on a single theme," the theme,
23         part of the conspiracy, "suddenly but
24         effectively the message is delivered that the
25         health hazards of cigarette smoking are

 1         exaggerated and nonexistent."  That's the
 2         conspiracy in a nutshell.
 3             And that message was subtly but effectively
 4         delivered, not just in their billion dollars of
 5         propaganda, but also in their 250 billion
 6         dollars of advertising.  And this is 1967, right
 7         before Cindy started to smoke.
 8             And they make another interesting point.
 9         It's not well known about the addictive nature
10         of smoking.  And it's certainly not communicated
11         in any of these ads.  And if someone is trying
12         to make a decision, a young person, should I try
13         just one cigarette, that's something they have a
14         right to hear.
15             But this is the time, around the time when
16         Cindy tried her first cigarette.  And it's
17         confirmed in their files, okay.  It's not just
18         Dr. Cummings.  It's not just me.  It's not just
19         the government.  They confirmed, "Very few
20         consumers are aware of the effects of nicotine."
21             Actually, I'm not sure if this is a
22         Philip Morris document.  This is Brown and
23         Williamson.  This is not Philip Morris.
24             But the point is, Brown and Williamson, a
25         tobacco company, a conspirator of theirs, is

 1         telling us that the government is right, that
 2         Dr. Cummings is right, "at this time very few
 3         consumers are aware of the effects of nicotine,
 4         it's addictive nature and that nicotine is a
 5         poison."  And that's 1970, two years after Cindy
 6         started smoking.
 7             And Cindy was one of those people.  At this
 8         point in your life had you ever heard of
 9         nicotine?  No.  She never even heard the word.
10             Now, just want to stop here for a second
11         because you've heard evidence on addiction, and
12         the reason you're hearing this evidence is
13         because one of the factors in deciding punitive
14         damages is any other circumstances that you want
15         to consider in whether the defendant should be
16         punished more or less, but it's not to decide
17         whether she was at fault or how much she was at
18         fault.  That's already decided.  It's in the
19         instructions the judge will give you.  The prior
20         jury heard evidence that you did not and you
21         must accept those findings.  And the judge is
22         going to take your verdict and apply those
23         findings about her fault to it.  And she was at
24         fault and she has always admitted that she was
25         at fault.  She should have quit.  But they

 1         should have quit lying.
 2             So the prior jury found the conspiracy was a
 3         cause of her emphysema.
 4             Let me talk about the health -- see, these
 5         weren't warnings when she started smoking.  They
 6         were changed.  Remember, it says "warning"
 7         later.  When she picked up her first cigarette
 8         pack out of a vending machine, first of all, it
 9         wasn't on a poster this big.  Even today -- you
10         can see these are Philip Morris brands that we
11         had yesterday -- those warnings are on there,
12         but they're not huge boards.
13             MR. MCCARTER:  Objection, Your Honor.  Gets
14         into preemption.  Sorry to interrupt, Counsel.
15             It gets into preemption.
16             THE COURT:  I've given you legal
17         instructions on this already, ladies and
18         gentlemen.
19             You may continue, sir.
20             MR. UUSTAL:  So that's the first point, even
21         today.  They showed them to you because they
22         want you to see a giant board.  But she didn't
23         see a giant board.
24             Second thing is it didn't say warning like
25         it does now.  It said something very

 1         interesting, very, very interesting.  "Caution:
 2         Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your
 3         health."
 4             Now whose message is that?  "May be
 5         hazardous to your health."  May be.  May be or
 6         it may not be.
 7             (Video clip was played and taken down to the
 8   best of the reporter's ability as follows:)
 9             VOICE:  Cigarette smoking may be hazardous
10         to your health, it may not be; we just don't
11         know.
12             VOICE:  I don't know, frankly, I think that
13         smoking may be hazardous, it may not be.
14             VOICE:  Smoking may be hazardous, it may not
15         be.  No one, including TV 7, knows for certain.
16             VOICE:  It may be or it may not be, we don't
17         know.
18             VOICE:  I don't know if cigarettes are bad
19         or they're not bad.
20             VOICE:  We don't know what causes the
21         illness that has been attributed to cigarette
22         smoking.
23             VOICE:  I'm saying that the science to date
24         and over 100 million dollars of our industry
25         indicates that there is no causal...

 1             (Video clip concluded.)
 2             MR. UUSTAL:  It may be or it may not be
 3         that's their message, and it's right there on
 4         the cigarette pack.
 5             So did it work?  Yeah.
 6             FTC did a study, 1967, right about the time
 7         that she picked up her first cigarette.  "The
 8         warning label on the cigarette packages has not
 9         succeeded in overcoming the prevalent attitudes
10         that cigarette smoking created and maintained by
11         the cigarette companies through their
12         advertisements, particularly the barrage of
13         commercials on television which portray smoking
14         as harmless and enjoyable, not habit-forming
15         with no hazards to health."
16             It's tough for a tiny little warning label
17         that happens to be consistent with their message
18         and that you wouldn't even look at when you're
19         picking up a cigarette pack to open it, to fight
20         250 billion dollars in advertising and a billion
21         dollars of the most sophisticated propaganda, in
22         this country at least.
23             Again, it's already decided about she was at
24         fault partially, but that's already decided.
25         The issue of fault is not for you.

 1             I want to discuss briefly about how
 2         addiction drives disease.  Social smokers who
 3         through genetic luck or other factors do not
 4         become addicted, they just get way less
 5         exposure.  If you're lucky enough not to be
 6         addicted and you smoke here and there, you
 7         get -- over a lifetime you get so much less
 8         exposure than someone like Cindy who has got to
 9         smoke first thing in the morning, last thing at
10         night.  She wakes in the middle of the night.
11         She can't even sit through a whole movie without
12         getting that nicotine fix.  So she gets so much
13         exposure.  That's how addiction drives disease.
14         Nicotine is one of the most addictive drugs on
15         the face of the planet.  Right now 45 million
16         smokers, way more than half, want to quit.  But
17         in any given year less than 3 percent succeed
18         for a whole year.
19             The illegal drugs that Philip Morris said in
20         response to the 1984 Surgeon General's Report,
21         oh, don't compare us to those illegal drugs.
22         People can quit them, some of them, easier than
23         nicotine.
24             Just talking about Cindy, I mean, was she
25         addicted?  It's already been proven to the other

 1         jury.  You didn't hear all the evidence, but she
 2         was highly addicted.  A person who has to smoke
 3         in the middle of the night if she gets up, can't
 4         sit through a whole movie.  Oh, and she started
 5         to quit in 1970, when the label changed from
 6         May, from their message to "does," she realized
 7         too that she was smoking so much and within two
 8         years smoking so much -- she was smoking that
 9         much within a few weeks, but within two years
10         she decided to try and quit.  And that was a
11         feature of her life up until the time that she
12         got the patch.  And when she got the patch it
13         was completely different.  When she was trying
14         to quit before, she felt like she was crawling
15         out of her skin, but with the patch it wasn't
16         like that.
17             I bring that up because Mr. Jupe -- you
18         heard from Dr. Cummings and Mr. Jupe yesterday
19         about the business with the Nicorette Gum.  And
20         Richard Jupe said, "We had a business dispute
21         with Dow.  Dow Chemical was the producer of
22         Nicorette Gum.  They were saying some things in
23         their communications we didn't agree with.  We
24         were buying from Dow Chemical."
25             That is a very, very important statement.

 1         Let's look at it.
 2             First of all, they were buying from Dow
 3         Chemical.  And you know from Dr. Cummings that
 4         they were able to successfully pressure, they
 5         had leverage over Dow.  Well, Dow sold stuff to
 6         them so they were in a position of leverage if
 7         they wanted to get Dow to do something and Dow
 8         wanted to continue with that relationship.  And
 9         Mr. Jupe said, they were saying some things in
10         one of their communications that we didn't agree
11         with.  Well, you know from the evidence that
12         you've heard and in evidence in the case is The
13         Smoking Cessation Newsletter, which you can read
14         through, you can figure out what the message
15         was, what are the things that we didn't agree
16         with.  And the pamphlets in the doctors' waiting
17         rooms, you don't have a copy of that, but you
18         can look through it because the message that
19         they didn't agree with was quit smoking and use
20         Nicorette to do it.  This is in evidence.
21             Plaintiff's Exhibit 2.
22             And that was when she was trying to quit.
23         And it's, you know -- look, some people might
24         have a problem with a company that sells a
25         deadly addictive drug, but let's put that aside.

 1         Obviously it's much worse to lie about it so you
 2         can make more money and get more people addicted
 3         knowing that more of them are going to die, but
 4         let's put that aside.  How about the people who
 5         want to quit trying to conceal the way that they
 6         can quit?  Is that something that should not be
 7         punished, that they're really going to come in
 8         here and say to you zero?
 9             She was addicted.  The issues here in
10         relation to her and her fault are all decided.
11             So this continued all through the time she
12         was trying to quit.  I've just got a couple of
13         videos from this time period.
14             (Video clip was played and taken down to the
15   best of the reporter's ability as follows:)
16             VOICE:  Earlier this week the RJ Reynolds
17         Tobacco Company took out this ad in a number of
18         major newspapers and magazines calling for an
19         open debate about smoking.  In brief, the ad
20         contends that medical studies would show that
21         cigarette smoking causes disease are ignoring
22         significant evidence to the contrary.
23             VOICE:  Cigarette smoking does not cause
24         cancer, yes or no?
25             VOICE:  It is not known whether cigarettes

 1         cause cancer.  It has not been causally
 2         established.
 3             VOICE:  Cigarette smoking no causal
 4         relationship between cigarette smoking and
 5         emphysema.
 6             VOICE:  Despite all of the research to date,
 7         there has been no causal link established.
 8             VOICE:  No causal relationship between
 9         cigarette smoking and heart disease.
10             VOICE:  No, as a matter of fact, there are
11         studies that while we are accused of being
12         associated with heart disease, there have been
13         studies conducted over 10 years that would say
14         again that science is still puzzled over these
15         forces.
16             (Video clip concluded.)
17             MR. UUSTAL:  So this is the CEO of RJR, one
18         of their co-conspirators.
19             You know what, let me just show you one
20         more.  Let's do the 1994.  This continued all
21         the way through the '90s.
22             By the way, during this whole period they're
23         going to come in and tell you that Cindy knew.
24         Cindy should have known in 1968.  Everybody
25         knew.  But here they are in 1994 saying -- and

 1         it is true, they do come up with the little
 2         twist on the facts and definitions and stuff.
 3         That was in the first document from the
 4         conspiracy called the forwarding memo, which
 5         you'll have in evidence, it specifically talked
 6         about putting little twists on the facts of
 7         science.  And you'll listen to them when they
 8         deny it, because they knew it's true, but
 9         they're denying it in a way, putting a little
10         twist on the facts of science, and that started
11         right in the beginning of the conspiracy.
12             Will you play that.
13             (Video clip was played and taken down to the
14   best of the reporter's ability as follows:)
15             VOICE:  I'd like you to rise, and those who
16         will be testifying as well, I'd like you to
17         rise.
18             If you raise your right hand.  Do you swear
19         that the testimony you're about to give is the
20         truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
21         truth?
22             Please consider yourself to be under oath.
23             VOICE:  Let me begin my questioning on the
24         matter of whether or not nicotine is addictive.
25         Let me ask you first, and I'd like to just go

 1         down the row, whether each of you believes that
 2         nicotine is not addictive.
 3             I heard virtually all of you touch on it.
 4         And just yes or no, do you believe nicotine is
 5         not addictive?
 6             VOICE:  I believe nicotine is not addictive,
 7         yes.
 8             VOICE:  Mr. Johnston.
 9             VOICE:  Congressman, cigarettes and nicotine
10         clearly do not meet the classic definitions of
11         addiction.  There is no intoxications --
12             VOICE:  We'll take that as a no.
13             And, again, time is short if you could
14         just -- I think each of you believe nicotine is
15         not addictive, we just would like to have this
16         for the record.
17             VOICE:  I don't believe that nicotine or our
18         products are addictive.
19             VOICE:  I believe nicotine is not addictive.
20             VOICE:  I believe that nicotine is not
21         addictive.
22             VOICE:  I believe that nicotine is not
23         addictive.
24             VOICE:  And I too believe that nicotine is
25         not addictive.

 1             VOICE:  Mr. Campbell, you were also deposed
 2         and you said, quote, To my knowledge it has not
 3         been proven that cigarette smoking causes
 4         cancer."
 5             This is a rather passive and pleasant
 6         approach, especially in light of the consensus,
 7         not by some, but all of the scientific
 8         community.  Will you ever be convinced, and what
 9         evidence are you waiting for?
10             And let's have the microphone passed over.
11             VOICE:  Yes, I may be convinced.  We don't
12         know what causes cancer in general right now so
13         I think that we may find out what causes cancer
14         and we may find out some relationship which has
15         yet to be proven.
16             (Video clip concluded.)
17             MR. UUSTAL:  So just two points about that.
18         First of all, it's 1994 under oath.  So seems to
19         me it would be difficult for them to say that
20         Cindy should have known before that when their
21         people -- that last guy is the CEO of
22         Philip Morris -- were saying that it's not
23         proven and it's not addictive.
24             The other thing is, that's different than
25         what Mr. Jupe told you their position was back

 1         then.  Remember he said their position in 1994
 2         was just, oh, well, we don't know how it causes
 3         cancer.  That's not what they were saying.  They
 4         didn't say, we don't know how it causes cancer.
 5         They said, it's not proven that it does cause
 6         cancer.  And that is a big difference.
 7             Your Honor, do you know what time I started?
 8             THE COURT:  You began at 9, sir.
 9             MR. UUSTAL:  Thank you.
10             Let's look at the verdict form.
11             So the first question is:  "What is the
12         total amount of medical expenses sustained by
13         Lucinda Naugle in the past?"
14             You have a box of all of her medical bills
15         that we -- not all of her medical bills, the
16         ones related to emphysema, and you've heard
17         testimony on that.  And attached to each bill is
18         the records that if you need to confirm that
19         it's related to emphysema.
20             I have heard no objection during the entire
21         case to any of these bills.  So that's what it
22         is.  That's an easy one.  And I read you the
23         amount, $466,389.66 during the case.
24             Let me just show you a couple of jury
25         instructions that apply to that $466,000.

 1             One of them in your instructions from the
 2         judge is the comparative fault.  And it's just
 3         saying, look, when someone is at -- when a
 4         plaintiff is partially at fault, then the law
 5         sometimes requires reductions based on that
 6         fault.  But that's for the judge.  Okay, you
 7         don't reduce anything in your verdict.  The
 8         judge does that after the case.  So you are not
 9         to reduce that in any way because she was at
10         fault and she admitted it and the jury found her
11         percentage, a prior jury, and the judge will
12         apply that as appropriate under the law to the
13         verdict afterwards.
14             The second thing is, there was a question
15         from a juror and I think a couple of comments
16         during the evidence about insurance or Medicare.
17         So these are the bills, okay, and that's what
18         the law requires you to put on your verdict.  If
19         there's a reason, because of insurance to -- the
20         insurance is not in these, it's been removed
21         from these bills, because that's not the
22         evidence you need to determine for your verdict.
23         The judge will handle that after the trial if
24         there's a reason because of insurance to reduce
25         it, if the insurance companies come in and try

 1         and get part of it, which they're entitled to,
 2         and also for future, although that's not an
 3         issue in this case anymore, there can be part of
 4         it that has to be set aside so that the money
 5         for future medical bills comes from there
 6         instead of Medicare having to pay or something.
 7         It has to come from that fund.
 8             But anyway, that's not -- you don't need to
 9         worry about that and you certainly don't need to
10         reduce it because you think, oh, there may have
11         been insurance.  In fact, you're not allowed to.
12             Let's go back to the medical expenses in the
13         future.  So you heard a lot of testimony on
14         that.  Dr. Coopersmith first came to an opinion
15         on her life expectancy before 2009, and about
16         five years later he was consistent with that
17         before you, based on all the information he had.
18         But he did tell you, there's a very specific
19         question, in reality no one knows.  And that's
20         true now as well.  But you cannot put in your
21         verdict anything on that plan.  Her doctor, as
22         you know, right now says terminal.  So it is
23         unlikely that she's going to leave the hospital.
24             She went in -- so you'll see from the
25         records that her hospitalization in June at

 1         Broward General was for 30 days.  And it was
 2         approximately $200,000.  I think it was a couple
 3         hundred dollars over that.
 4             So she's been in there since Thursday, so a
 5         week and a half ago, and she'll be in there, I
 6         mean, at least some future time.  No one knows,
 7         but you have to base your evidence on the
 8         greater weight of the evidence, so I would
 9         suggest that two weeks of hospitalization.  It's
10         already been -- so it's one day short of two
11         weeks.  So I would say two to three weeks of
12         hospitalization, which is 100 to 150 for that in
13         the future.  And part of it, the expenses have
14         already been incurred but they haven't been
15         billed so that's why that would be in the
16         future.  The past you have there.  And that
17         would be the only thing you can consider.  I
18         want to just make that clear.  Nothing about
19         anything the numbers Dr. Raffa testified to, it
20         turns out that you don't need them.  So I'm
21         sorry we took your time on that, but at the time
22         we thought you did.  You cannot let that affect
23         you at all.  The only issue is now two weeks or
24         three weeks of hospitalization.
25             Now, I want to address an issue that seemed

 1         to come up in the trial and it may come up when
 2         counsel for Philip Morris gives his closing
 3         argument.  The idea that because Cindy didn't
 4         get pulmonary rehabilitation you should somehow,
 5         I'm not even sure, do something with your
 6         verdict, reduce something in your verdict.  I'll
 7         have to wait and see exactly what they say.
 8             But let me just say, the evidence in the
 9         case is that she wasn't going to pulmonary rehab
10         because she was going to work.  And pulmonary
11         rehab for someone who's bedridden -- I mean,
12         what is it?  Dr. Coopersmith told you it's
13         walking on a treadmill, it's learning about
14         nutrition, and it's very helpful for bedridden
15         patients.  And it probably would have been a
16         good thing for her, but by going to work she had
17         to get up, she had to get out of the house, she
18         had to walk to the car, drive, go into work,
19         work and get home.  And Dr. Singer, her treating
20         doctor for many, many, many years, specifically
21         said that is a form of rehab.  And so the idea
22         that not doing the pulmonary rehab might have
23         affected something in this case is just put in
24         your heads as a speculation.
25             But let's look at what the medical testimony

 1         says about that.  First Dr. Singer -- oh, no,
 2         I'm sorry, let me just show what she says about
 3         that.
 4             (Video clip was played and taken down to the
 5   best of the reporter's ability as follows:)
 6             VOICE:  Because we're open from 7 in the
 7         morning until 5:30.  I'm a person who is on
 8         oxygen 24/7.  You're going to make me go to
 9         physical therapy for two hours then make up two
10         more hours of work?  Do you know how many hours
11         of work that is putting on a person with
12         COPD/emphysema, to make that person with
13         emphysema?  People can't believe I'm working
14         every single day.  I get up at 4:30 in the
15         morning.  I get up at 4:30 in the morning to try
16         to get ready, myself ready to get to work every
17         day.  How many people in my -- like me would go
18         to work and get there 7:35 in the morning and
19         work until 5:30?
20             (Video clip concluded.)
21             MR. UUSTAL:  That's better than walking on a
22         treadmill for certain, very, very slow,
23         Dr. Coopersmith told you how it's just very,
24         very slow.
25             What do the doctors say about that, her

 1         doctor, Singer?
 2             (Video clip was played and taken down to the
 3   best of the reporter's ability as follows:)
 4             VOICE:  Well, obviously the fact is she
 5         never went.  She was doing pretty well.  She was
 6         getting up and dressing and going to work.  She
 7         was functioning at a very high level, and
 8         fortunately we kept her out of the hospital a
 9         long time.  So recommending pulmonary rehab
10         would be an additional benefit that obviously I
11         think anyone with emphysema would enjoy, but it
12         was never anything which I thought reflected
13         poorly on her either as a conscientious patient
14         or seriously impeded her treatment or care.
15             (Video clip concluded.)
16             (Video clip was played and taken down to the
17   best of the reporter's ability as follows:)
18             VOICE:  Over the years has Cindy taken her
19         treatment with you very seriously?
20             VOICE:  Oh, very.
21             VOICE:  Have you -- were you ever critical
22         of her for working as opposed to taking the time
23         off to go to pulmonary rehab?
24             VOICE:  No, not in the least.
25             VOICE:  Does she typically make her

 1         scheduled appointments?
 2             VOICE:  Yes.
 3             VOICE:  Has she been overall compliant as a
 4         patient --
 5             VOICE:  Yes, she's a wonderful patient.
 6         She's a model patient.
 7             (Video clip concluded.)
 8             MR. UUSTAL:  Just remember that if you hear
 9         any argument from lawyers.  In fact, let's see
10         the video of the doctor who testified that
11         pulmonary rehab would have changed anything
12         about her medical care.
13             You don't have that one, Baron?
14             MR. PHILLIPS:  Sorry, I don't.
15             MR. UUSTAL:  There is isn't one.  You heard
16         in the evidence they showed Dr. Cummings some
17         notes from the medical evaluation of a doctor
18         they hired to evaluate her, to examine her, did
19         he testify that this pulmonary rehab would have
20         changed anything?  So remember about that --
21             MR. MCCARTER:  Objection, Your Honor.
22             THE COURT:  Sustained.
23             MR. UUSTAL:  Argument of a lawyer is not the
24         same as evidence, the testimony of a doctor.
25             So just a couple of things about, you know,

 1         why, why she wasn't at pulmonary rehab and what
 2         type of person she is.
 3             You heard from a deposition, but her boss,
 4         "She's tough, I'll tell you that."
 5             "She's a really hard worker."
 6             She was on intravenous antibiotics at work.
 7         Intravenous antibiotics and she went to work.
 8             "She was weak, we'd drive her home, but you
 9         can't get her not to come to work.  She's coming
10         to work as long as she can get up and walk."
11             Is that a bad thing?
12             And just the last one, quotes about her
13         being a fighter.  "I don't tell people, I don't
14         talk about it because in some ways I'm very
15         lucky, I can go to work.  I'm very lucky."
16             Second question, total amount of damages for
17         pain and suffering, disability, physical
18         impairment, disfigurement, mental anguish,
19         inconvenience, loss of capacity for the
20         enjoyment of life in the past and in the future.
21             And the jury instruction on this
22         specifically says "You shall consider the
23         following elements," and it includes all of
24         those, pain, suffering, disability, and it goes
25         through each of them.  So I want to talk to you

 1         about -- a little bit about each of them
 2         individually.
 3             But before we -- first of all, let me say,
 4         future, again, future is just limited to what
 5         you think over the next -- the next couple of
 6         weeks.
 7             But let's talk about how you're going to
 8         figure out based on the jury instructions and
 9         the evidence what to put in that line for in the
10         past.
11             This was Cindy at her brother's wedding
12         within a few days or weeks of being diagnosed
13         with emphysema.  She wasn't feeling the physical
14         effects yet.  Early 40s.
15             She's only 65 right now.  And when you see
16         pictures of her, she's only 65.  That's what
17         emphysema did to her.
18             So let's go through quickly the different
19         time periods.
20             '93 to '96, obviously it was a concern for
21         her, but it wasn't physically affecting her.
22             '96 to 2006, that's when she said she
23         couldn't walk the dogs anymore, in '96.  And she
24         was slowly deteriorating, her lungs getting
25         worse and worse each day.  And she was having

 1         trouble breathing.  She was on oxygen
 2         intermittently, part-time she needed oxygen.
 3         She had to carry supplemental oxygen.  And there
 4         were times when she was very bad during that
 5         time period.  Her world was getting smaller and
 6         smaller.  Each of the things that she had
 7         enjoyed one by one she was having to give them
 8         up.
 9             By 2006 she was on full-time oxygen, meaning
10         she was tethered to a machine every second of
11         her life.
12             She had to get up at 4:30 to get to work by
13         7:35.  And she lives five minutes from work, if
14         you remember.  So that's how long -- you know,
15         she's got to get up and walk to the bathroom,
16         then she's got to rest.  Then she's got to brush
17         her teeth.  The action of brushing her teeth,
18         she's got to catch her breath, she's out of
19         breath now.  Her baseline level is out of
20         breath.  So it's like just running a long
21         distance, being out of breath and then trying to
22         do something, adding to that being out of
23         breath, the can't catch your breath, gasping for
24         breath.
25             She had a serious hospitalization in 2009.

 1             2009 to 2013 she got back to full-time
 2         oxygen but being able to live at home, tethered
 3         to a machine at all times.  But by this time she
 4         lost going to her brother's house, family
 5         events.  The last few things that she loved she
 6         had to give up.  And her life was just trying to
 7         get to work, trying to catch a breath.
 8             And then from June 2013 to today she has
 9         been in the hospital, rehab, she got out for a
10         short time, she's had two near fatal events.
11             THE COURT:  You have five minutes, sir.
12             MR. UUSTAL:  Thank you, Your Honor.  I think
13         I'm going to need an extra five.
14             THE COURT:  It's your time.  Use it how you
15         wish.
16             MR. UUSTAL:  Thank you, Your Honor.
17             (Video clip was played and taken down to the
18   best of the reporter's ability as follows:)
19             VOICE:  We also asked you to produce all
20         documents, including photographs or DVDs or
21         videotapes depicting you during vacation or
22         holiday or leisure activities.  Do you have any
23         of those at home?
24             VOICE:  I don't do that anymore.  I just
25         come home -- I go to work, I come home.  I don't

 1         go on holidays.  I don't take trips.  I've never
 2         been on a trip in 20 years.  No, I tell you, I
 3         have no idea the last time I took a trip.  I
 4         don't even go to my brother's house anymore.
 5             VOICE:  Have you taken any vacations since
 6         the last trial or any trips?
 7             THE WITNESS:  No trips, no vacations.
 8             (Video clip concluded.)
 9             MR. UUSTAL:  Just the act of talking you can
10         see she had to take a second to try and catch
11         her breath, lying in bed just talking.  You've
12         heard it described as being a prisoner in her
13         own body, always out of breath, slowly
14         suffocating over the last two decades.  She lost
15         everything that was important to her.  It was
16         literally her life was get out of bed, fight for
17         breath, walk to the bathroom, fight for breath,
18         brush your teeth, fight for breath, all day long
19         fight for breath and hopefully get to work.  And
20         that's it.
21             So when you consider these things over two
22         decades, and the verdict form lists them and the
23         jury instructions says "you shall consider each
24         of them."
25             Obviously something that is minor, say a

 1         minor pain caused by someone else's negligence,
 2         car accident or something that doesn't last very
 3         long is a very minor, deserves a very minor
 4         compensation, maybe nothing, maybe a couple of
 5         hundred bucks.  The more serious the pain the
 6         numbers go up.
 7             And, you know, the law requires compensation
 8         for medical bills and things like that, but the
 9         law also requires compensation for things like
10         this.  Because the law requires you to consider
11         these things, because the law values a person's
12         life, not just their money, and what their life
13         means to them.  And these things affect what
14         their life was, what it is.
15             So as the pain increases -- and Cindy had
16         intermittent pain throughout her life, but it's
17         not a major consideration for you here, but I'm
18         just using it as an example so how you can look
19         at each one of these things.  If it's minor pain
20         and for a short period of time obviously it
21         might be nothing or very small amount.  As the
22         pain increases or the time of the pain
23         increases, the value is -- that's required for
24         compensation is going up.
25             And if it's medium pain over a medium period

 1         of time, maybe you're getting to tens of
 2         thousands of dollars.  If it's an extremely
 3         excruciating pain even over a short period that
 4         could be much more significant.  It could be
 5         something that scars someone for life, and as it
 6         increases in the amount of time you can get into
 7         hundreds of thousands of dollars.  But if you
 8         have something that lasts for decades and is at
 9         the highest end of the scale, can you imagine
10         excruciating pain for two decades, obviously
11         you're talking about the most serious
12         compensation.  And so you're up to the level at
13         that point of the most serious, if you've got
14         the most serious harm over the longest period of
15         time of millions.
16             Pain, it was not a significant factor for
17         her.  But if we look at each of the others,
18         let's start at the bottom, loss of the capacity
19         for the enjoyment of life.  That's what it is.
20         You know, sometimes these don't apply at all,
21         but for some people it's a perfect description.
22         It stole her life, two decades.  And if her
23         life, if you have something that -- I can't
24         imagine something that could take away more, the
25         enjoyment of life and it has lasted her entire

 1         life for two decades, and she's going to die
 2         long before her time.  So for loss of capacity
 3         of enjoyment of life.
 4             Disability, you know, you could be paralyzed
 5         in a wheelchair, that's disability and physical
 6         impairment, but she's right up at that level in
 7         her inability to do things, the most serious
 8         form of disability, and, again, for this
 9         extremely long period of time.  Look, it's
10         not -- you're not allowed to blame anyone that
11         this has taken so long.  You cannot hold that
12         against anybody, but at the same time, this is a
13         very long period of time, and that compensation
14         has to reflect that.
15             So we have at least three things on here,
16         the disability, the suffering and loss of
17         capacity of life that are at the highest end of
18         the spectrum and have occurred over two decades,
19         and so for each of those highest end of the
20         spectrum and that long period of time, for each
21         one of those you need to recognize what she has
22         lost.
23             And for the others I'm not going to suggest
24         a number.  I think you should look at them each
25         individually, but for each one of those, it

 1         cannot be hundreds of thousands of dollars, it
 2         cannot be.  Taking away for two decades
 3         completely the loss of capacity of life.  It's a
 4         little less than that because it occurred over a
 5         period of time.  It cannot be hundreds of
 6         thousands of dollars if a life is worth
 7         anything.  It must be millions to reflect what
 8         her life is worth.
 9             And so I would suggest to you for loss of
10         capacity, disfigurement -- I'm sorry, loss of
11         capacity, disability and suffering, each of
12         those should be at least 2 million dollars.  The
13         rest of them much less.  And disfigurement,
14         none.
15             But you need to consider each one of those.
16             For the future I'm not going to even give
17         you a suggestion.  You need to consider the same
18         factors but over a very short period of time,
19         and I already told you that the time factor is
20         extremely important, so for each of these it's
21         going to have to reflect a much, much, much,
22         much, much smaller number because it's not two
23         decades.  It's a week or two.
24             This is the last question on the verdict
25         form.  "What is the total amount of punitive

 1         damages, if any, that you find should be
 2         assessed against Philip Morris?
 3             The factors that you need to consider, the
 4         nature, extent and degree of the misconduct and
 5         related circumstances, defendant's financial
 6         resources and any other circumstances which may
 7         affect the amount."
 8             So I've gone through what they did
 9         intentionally, fraud.
10             So we've talked about the nature, extent and
11         degree of the misconduct.  The extent was 50
12         years.  Can't be any higher.  The nature was
13         lying about a deadly addictive drug.  Can't be
14         any higher.  And the degree, what it caused was
15         death and suffering, so it can't being any
16         higher.
17             Second one is defendant's financial
18         resources.  You may have wondered why we read
19         that to you, the agreed amount to how much
20         they're making right now.
21             Your Honor, I'm going to need another 5.
22             THE COURT:  Take -- it's your time, however
23         you wish to divide it.
24             MR. UUSTAL:  May have wondered why we put
25         that in, but if you think about it, a punishment

 1         has to reflect that.  That's why the law says
 2         that, must reflect that.
 3             For Cindy, if she gets a speeding ticket
 4         it's two days of her salary, right, it means
 5         something, it's a punishment for her not to
 6         speed.
 7             So if Cindy had done something wrong you
 8         would have to take into account what amount to
 9         punish her.
10             THE COURT:  Sustained.  That's not proper
11         argument.  Sustained.  Focus on the issues
12         before the jury, sir.
13             MR. UUSTAL:  Yes, sir.
14             So in order for this to have any effect, if
15         that's possible, you need to look at their net
16         earnings.
17             So let me just say again what net earnings
18         are.  It's not revenue.  It's profit.  And it's
19         not just profit.  It's the company's revenue
20         minus the cost of the goods sold, it's minus the
21         overhead, minus the payroll, minus the taxes,
22         minus the interest.  It's minus -- it's even
23         taxes.  It's everything.  It's lawyers and
24         litigation and the MSA things they told you
25         about.  And if they have assets, they buy a

 1         corporate jet, bonuses to their CEO, every
 2         single thing that Philip Morris could possibly
 3         need is paid for and then they have that much
 4         money, which is excess and can be kicked up to
 5         their parent company.
 6             MR. MCCARTER:  Objection, Your Honor.
 7             THE COURT:  Sustained.  It's not proper
 8         argument nor is it before you, ladies and
 9         gentlemen.
10             Stick to the evidence, please.
11             MR. UUSTAL:  So there's three interesting
12         things about this.  First of all, from 2011 to
13         2012 to 2013 profits are going up every year.
14         And in 2013 they're on track, because this is
15         through the first six months, to make four and a
16         half billion dollars, not made, that's net
17         earnings, after everything, what's left.
18             So for this year right now they are making
19         $12,300,000 per day extra after advertising and
20         everything, the scientists that they told you
21         about.
22             So what is the proper punishment for lies
23         that cause injury and death?  It's already
24         established that they lied, they committed
25         fraud, they committed conspiracy and it caused

 1         injury and death.  So when you put a number on
 2         that verdict form, it's going to answer that
 3         question.  Lies about an addictive deadly drug,
 4         lies that cause injury and death and untold
 5         suffering, and lies for money.  We didn't get
 6         into this that much but you saw the one document
 7         where Philip Morris they had a decision and they
 8         said, well, we should make the decision this way
 9         if only for the primitive reason of who ain't
10         for more money.
11             Lies for money, who ain't for more money at
12         Philip Morris?
13             So that's the question.  It's already been
14         established that they did this and it's already
15         been established that punitive damages are
16         warranted.  You're being asked the amount.  And,
17         yes, you have the discretion to give an amount
18         that's zero.  For example, if the company didn't
19         have any assets or wasn't making any money,
20         you're not allowed to bankrupt a company.  But
21         in this situation any amount that is not
22         significant is specifically saying there is no
23         proper punishment or there's a very low
24         punishment for this.  And why is that important?
25         Why is that important?  Because first of all, it

 1         effects what Philip Morris does.
 2             In fact, let me just show you, Mr. Jupe
 3         testified yesterday.
 4             "Right after the jury in the yearlong trial
 5         this case arose out of found cigarettes, proved
 6         cigarettes defective and harmful and addictive,
 7         Philip Morris admitted" -- he brought it up.
 8         "Do lawsuits have an impact on us?  Yeah, that's
 9         why they changed."
10             And then the next day, talking -- I'm sorry,
11         at the next question, "Yeah, no question about
12         it, the lawsuits, private suits, big suits like
13         the attorney generals are they a way for us as a
14         company to realize we're out of alignment?
15         Absolutely."
16             So first of all, that number, the number
17         affects what Philip Morris does, but secondly it
18         answers that question for other people.  One of
19         the reasons for punishment when there's
20         something like this is to deter other companies.
21         If other companies look at what the tobacco
22         companies did and say, oh, my God look at how
23         much money they made over this 50-year
24         conspiracy and look how little it cost them in
25         punishment then that encourages other companies

 1         in other industries, banks, Wall Street,
 2         whatever it is.
 3             So for the deterrence the answer to that
 4         question is there -- and Dr. Cummings was asked,
 5         do you think a just verdict is a big verdict in
 6         punitive damages?  And he said yes.  That's the
 7         reason why.  It will affect Philip Morris.
 8             And so I -- this is just for what they
 9         already did, what's already proven.  There must
10         be a punishment, significant punishment for
11         that.  And this is the only place ever that
12         there will be a punishment for what they did and
13         how it affected Cindy.
14             But they are going to say, as Mr. Jupe said,
15         we're a changed company.  And that's the only
16         reason I bring it up.  The punishment is for
17         what they already did.  The only reason I bring
18         up what they're doing now is because, number
19         one, when they say they're a changed company you
20         need to consider what they're doing now, but
21         number two, you can affect what they're doing
22         now.
23             Surgeon General says cigarettes are designed
24         for addiction, designed by people like Mr. Jupe
25         for addiction.  Ways in which you can make

 1         cigarettes more addictive.
 2             They have found a way to freebase the
 3         nicotine.  Cigarettes today deliver more
 4         nicotine and deliver it quicker than ever
 5         before.  That's what they're doing now.  You
 6         know why?  Decrease the exit rates by making it
 7         more addictive, exit rates for the addicted
 8         population and increase the entry rates through
 9         advertising to beginning smokers and designs in
10         the cigarette that help people move from
11         experimental to addicted smokers.
12             That's what they're doing right now, that's
13         what the Surgeon General says, and yet it goes
14         on.
15             The FDA wanted to get these warnings you
16         heard about, 50 percent of the pack front and
17         back, five years ago, in 2009 it came up.  It's
18         going to happen, still hasn't happened.  May
19         never happen.  It's not going to be the FDA.
20         Mr. Jupe told you what changes their behavior,
21         and it's the lawsuits.
22             Right now in the United States they spend 34
23         million a day in marketing, 1200 current and
24         former smokers die prematurely and the nation
25         spends 260 million a day on medical costs, 270

 1         million in lost productivity.  That's what
 2         they're doing today.
 3             Dr. Cummings told you in the 20th century we
 4         lost 100 million people to smoking.  We're on
 5         track to lose a billion souls in the 21st
 6         century because of how they design the
 7         cigarettes today.  So when they say they're a
 8         changed company, you don't even need to consider
 9         this.  They should be punished for what they did
10         in the conspiracy.  They must be punished.  But
11         if they say they're a changed company, you can
12         affect what they're doing today.
13             Thank you.
14             Thank you, Your Honor.
15             THE COURT:  All right, Mr. Uustal, thank
16         you.
17             We'll take our morning break.  I want to
18         restrict your access, if I can, during the
19         breaks now.  So we're going to take a ten-minute
20         recess.  Don't discuss the case.  I ask you to
21         stay in the jury room during the recess this
22         time.
23             MR. UUSTAL:  Your Honor, I apologize.
24         Mr. McPharlin just reminded me.  Can I have 10
25         seconds?

 1             THE COURT:  Of course.
 2             MR. UUSTAL:  I apologize.  This is important
 3         for legal reasons.  I have to suggest an amount.
 4             I would suggest to you the amount on
 5         punitive damages should be two days, two days of
 6         their net earnings, twelve and a half million a
 7         day, so approximately -- it's 12.3, so just
 8         under 25 million dollars.
 9             Thank you.


17             MR. UUSTAL:  It's also the defendant's
18         position that they shouldn't be punished.
19             This is the only courtroom, the only trial
20         ever, anywhere in the world that will punish
21         them for what they did to Cindy Naugle.  Counsel
22         made that very clear.  You have to look at what
23         they did to Cindy Naugle.  So nothing anywhere
24         else will ever punish them for what they did to
25         her.  And it is already established and you must

 1         accept that Cindy reasonably relied to her
 2         detriment on a statement made by Philip Morris
 3         that intentionally concealed material
 4         information and that there was a conspiracy and
 5         a fraud and that it resulted in her emphysema.
 6             If you put anything less than a significant
 7         punishment for Philip Morris on that question,
 8         then you are saying that if a company does that,
 9         any company, a tobacco company, then they will
10         not be -- anyone other than a tobacco company
11         they will not be seriously punished.  And you
12         know why they won't be seriously punished?
13         Because they successfully concealed it for 50
14         years and now it's remote.  Because it's a
15         different company because the litigation took 20
16         years.  Is that the incentive we want to give
17         companies?  You can avoid pun -- they did.  They
18         didn't deny it.
19             Or do we want to give companies an incentive
20         after they intentionally harmed people to hide
21         it, conceal it until it's so old that they can
22         come in and say, it's a different company?
23             Mr. McCarter said that it was false about
24         the Dow newsletter.  Read the Dow newsletter.
25         Yeah, there was one issue, that's how

 1         Philip Morris found out about it.  But there was
 2         only one issue.  It was supposed to go out to
 3         those 500 doctors every month for the next
 4         decade, but it only went out once.  And the
 5         patient pamphlets never went out.
 6             It's not right for a company to take away
 7         the possibility of an addict quitting so they
 8         can make more profits and then come in and say
 9         they shouldn't be punished for it because it was
10         a long time ago.
11             Mr. McCarter suggested -- oh, and by the way
12         they were saying not addictive, never been shown
13         to cause any disease, the whole period of the
14         fraud and then suddenly the Attorney Generals
15         get the confidential documents and the jury
16         verdict in this case finds cigarettes addictive
17         and harmful and suddenly they admit it and they
18         want you to say, oh, they're a changed company?
19         They did it because of the lawsuits and they're
20         only going to change now because of lawsuits
21         like this.
22             Mr. McCarter suggested that Cindy was fine
23         up until this year.  1999 she had a --
24         discharged home with a sitter.  She needed
25         24-hour care at some period in 1999.  She's had

 1         severe COPD since 1996, COPD, severe.  At one
 2         point she had to have live-in help.
 3             There's no doubt, you have medical records,
 4         that she wasn't fine until this year.  This is a
 5         decades long destruction of her life.  She is
 6         going to die 20 years before her time.
 7             MR. MCCARTER:  Objection, Your Honor.
 8             THE COURT:  Legal basis, sir?
 9             MR. MCCARTER:  Has to do with the mortality
10         tables being stricken.
11             THE COURT:  I sustain the objection.
12             MR. UUSTAL:  There is no doubt her suffering
13         over the decades was extreme.  There's no
14         dispute about that.
15             And Mr. McCarter misunderstood me when he
16         heard that I was suggesting 6 million dollars
17         for past pain and suffering, disfigurement,
18         disability, loss of enjoyment for life.  That
19         was only three of those categories.  And I
20         concede the other ones are less, but it is not
21         only 6 million dollars.  That number is a
22         reflection of what her suffering is and what her
23         life was worth.  And I can guarantee you there's
24         no one in this courtroom who would choose what
25         she had to go through for --

 1             MR. MCCARTER:  Objection, Your Honor.
 2             THE COURT:  Sustained.  That's improper
 3         argument.
 4             Ladies and gentlemen, he is not permitted to
 5         do that.  You should disregard those remarks.
 6             MR. UUSTAL:  There's a chart with issues not
 7         in dispute.  It should be called issues that
 8         were proven by the plaintiffs over the last 20
 9         years.
10             I don't want to get into the details of all
11         the lies because there's already a finding, but
12         there's just one I want to show you because it
13         was a document entitled Enough is Enough.  It's
14         in evidence and Mr. McCarter mentioned to you
15         enough is enough.  That's what they were saying,
16         enough is enough about people talking about
17         cigarettes being harmful.  It's PT0729 if you
18         want to find it in evidence.  And back then they
19         were saying there's -- "the fact is there's
20         nothing about smoking or about nicotine in
21         cigarettes that would prevent smokers from
22         quitting."
23             While internal Philip Morris documents knew
24         that "the cigarette will preempt food in terms
25         of scarcity on the smoker's priority list."

 1             Enough is enough.  And the way to stop this,
 2         as Mr. Jupe said, is lawsuits.
 3             Mr. McCarter asked Jim Naugle if he told
 4         Cindy about me because I sue, or I have lawsuits
 5         against tobacco companies.  Mr. Jupe told you
 6         that those lawsuits changed Philip Morris.
 7             MR. MCCARTER:  Objection, Your Honor.  I'm
 8         sorry, counsel.  The reference to Mr. Uustal
 9         being those lawsuits.
10             THE COURT:  Objection is overruled.
11             MR. UUSTAL:  It's not done.  It's not done.
12             The Surgeon General of the United States of
13         America says that they are designing the
14         cigarettes intentionally to maximize addiction.
15         Is that okay?  It's not done.  There's more work
16         to do and you are the ones who are going to do
17         it.  It's not easy for anybody to go through
18         what Cindy did to get where we are today.
19             MR. MCCARTER:  Objection, Your Honor.
20             THE COURT:  I'll permit that.  It's
21         overruled.
22             MR. UUSTAL:  But she did.  And it gives you
23         the opportunity, you the opportunity to do
24         something.  To make it stop, which the Surgeon
25         General, although they have said repeatedly it's

 1         happening, can't.  Which the FDA has not been
 2         able to do.  And you heard that the FDA wanted
 3         cigarette labels that cover half the pack, front
 4         and pack, warning labels, five years ago?
 5         They're not there.  That's what they want.  Just
 6         because the FDA has some theoretical legal power
 7         doesn't mean they can get it done.  And I think
 8         you saw in the evidence all the steps where
 9         people could put up road blocks to actually stop
10         something that the FDA wants from getting done.
11         Mr. Jupe told you what changes them.  Lawsuits.
12             Dr. Cummings spends his life helping people
13         quit smoking.  When he was working at the
14         Roswell Cancer Center and they asked him to take
15         all these documents that were pried out of the
16         companies by the Attorney Generals, he didn't
17         know what was going to come of this.  He
18         testified in the first phase, the yearlong case,
19         twice for free.  And now whenever people try --
20         the case didn't finish it.  It just established
21         the conspiracy and that the cigarettes were
22         harmful and addictive.  When smokers try to move
23         forward, get their medical bills and other
24         things not only does he have to fly in to try
25         and testify to what's in those documents,

 1         Philip Morris gets to depose him.  You heard
 2         from Dr. Coopersmith, in the last three weeks
 3         he's been deposed four times for over 10 hours.
 4         And he called it torture.
 5             It is not wrong for Dr. Cummings to charge
 6         for his time.  The fact that he didn't in a
 7         yearlong trial and the fact that he isn't in
 8         this one shows the significance of those trials.
 9         Lawyers charge for their time, other witnesses
10         did.  It is not wrong.  He is a man who
11         writes -- the Surgeon General asked to write
12         sections of the report.  And in order for
13         Philip Morris to prevail they must convince you
14         that someone who is writing sections of the
15         Surgeon General's Report is lying to you.
16             THE COURT:  You have four minutes, sir.
17             MR. UUSTAL:  Thank you, Your Honor.
18             Mr. Jupe comes in here just like they've
19         done since 1964 and tells you 15 reasons why the
20         Surgeon General is wrong today.  Nothing has
21         changed.
22             They can maximize addiction with how they
23         design cigarettes, the Surgeon General says how
24         they do it.  He can come in here and say, oh,
25         I've never heard -- that doesn't do that.  He

 1         showed you -- this is how they make cigarettes
 2         safer, but I showed you the Surgeon General
 3         saying, this makes cigarettes more addictive,
 4         that's how they freebase the nicotine.  That's
 5         why the Surgeon General says, despite them
 6         saying there's less nicotine in each cigarette,
 7         it's delivered quicker.  And there's more
 8         nicotine delivered than ever before.
 9             The warnings mean no punishment?  This is in
10         evidence, PT2023.  Mr. McCarter suggested there
11         should be no punishment because of the warnings.
12         This is one of the co-conspirators talking about
13         the anti-cigarette lobby, that's what they call
14         the public health authority, "The anticigarette
15         lobby has called the Cigarette Labeling Act a
16         victory for the tobacco industry."  Those
17         warnings.  "One critic entitled her article 'The
18         quiet victory of the cigarette lobby, how it
19         found the best filter yet.'"
20             Congress.
21             I'm running out of time so I can't talk
22         about everything.
23             These rates are staggering, this increase
24         and no one has suggested they're wrong.  These
25         rates show that people in this period when

 1         cigarette designs were different were dying of
 2         emphysema at four times the rate of the
 3         nonsmokers, now it's 22 times the rate.
 4             Last thing.  Mr. McCarter suggests that
 5         compensating Cindy for the destruction of her
 6         life in some number, and I'm just talking about
 7         in terms of the pain, suffering, disfigurement,
 8         disability, every one of those you have to
 9         consider is out -- in some number over 6 million
10         dollars, 7 or 8, is outrageous.
11             I would suggest to you that when someone
12         comes in here and doesn't dispute an intentional
13         act of fraud that you know has caused untold
14         suffering and specifically to Cindy Naugle and
15         suggest they shouldn't be punished for it for
16         any reason whatever, that's outrageous.  And two
17         days, two days to them, which they won't even
18         notice.
19             MR. MCCARTER:  Objection, Your Honor.
20             THE COURT:  Overruled.
21             MR. UUSTAL:  I think that it would be
22         outrageous to have a verdict that doesn't at
23         least suggest to the cigarette companies and all
24         the other companies who are watching this
25         verdict that they can get away by delaying and

 1         concealing for decades.
 2             Thank you for your time.  I know it's been a
 3         difficult case with all the evidence and changes
 4         in it.  Thank you.
