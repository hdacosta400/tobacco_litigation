MS. BAKER-BARNES:
Members of the jury, good
03:15:53
afternoon.
03:15:55
Let me start by thanking each of you again
03:15:56
for your commitment, for your service, for your
03:16:00
attention and for all of your hard work on this
03:16:06
case.
And I'm here to tell you this afternoon
03:16:11
that your work is not done yet, that what you do
03:16:15
here today is important, that what you do here
03:16:23
today makes a difference and will make a
difference, that what you do here today will
send a message.
03:16:27
03:16:32
03:16:36
Now, one of the instructions that you just
03:16:40
got from the Court is that corporations,
including corporations like RJ Reynolds, are
treated like people in the eyes of the law,
03:16:46
03:16:48
03:16:50
should be treated like a person in the eyes of
03:16:55
the law.
And that's true.
Strong people stand up for themselves.
Stronger people stand up for others.
03:16:57
03:17:00
03:17:08
RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company has been standing up
03:17:12
for itself for over 50 years.
And you saw more
03:17:15
of it here in the courtroom today.
And members
03:17:19
of the jury, today you, each and every one of
03:17:24 4582
you, get to stand up for Juanita Thurston.
You
03:17:28
didn't hear her name very much at all in the
testimony here today, but that is what this
phase of the proceedings is about.
It's not
03:17:34
03:17:38
03:17:42
about the new RJ Reynolds.
It's not about what
03:17:47
they're doing now.
It's about Juanita Thurston.
03:17:50
Each of you made the decision last week that
03:17:56
RJ Reynolds' conduct was reprehensible, that the
03:17:59
actions that they took in their campaign of
doubt and denial caused the death of Juanita
03:18:04
03:18:08
Thurston, caused her mother's death.
And you
03:18:12
made the determination that RJ Reynolds should
03:18:16
be punished for that conduct.
That's what this
03:18:19
phase of the proceedings is about, not about
03:18:23
what they're doing now, but what they did to her
03:18:27
mother then.
Could I have the Elmo, please, Baron.
So the instruction that you just received
03:18:31
03:18:35
03:18:46
from the Court about punitive damages, whether
03:18:55
RJ Reynolds -- or what is the amount of money
03:18:58
that RJ Reynolds should be assessed as
03:19:01
punishment for their conduct, as punishment for
03:19:04
causing Juanita Thurston's death.
That's what
03:19:09
we are assessing here today.
And so they should
03:19:12
be treated like people in the eyes of the law.
03:19:16 4583
And here in America for people and for
03:19:20
corporations, we have standards.
We expect, we
03:19:23
demand, we require that people do what's right;
03:19:27
that people admit when they're wrong; that
people accept responsibility, accept
responsibility and are accountable for their
actions.
That's not what you heard in this
courtroom here today.
03:19:32
03:19:36
03:19:40
03:19:43
03:19:48
MR. FURR:
Objection, Your Honor.
Could we
03:19:49
approach?
THE COURT:
Come on up.
(The following discussion was held at
sidebar:)
THE COURT:
What are you objecting to?
MR. FURR:
It's a completely improper
03:19:52
03:19:52
03:19:48
03:19:48
03:19:52
argument.
She cannot argue that we should be
03:19:54
punished for not accepting responsibility for
03:19:58
Juanita Thurston's death.
THE COURT:
Why?
03:20:00
03:20:03
MR. FURR:
Because we're entitled to defend
03:20:05
the lawsuit.
We have no obligation to admit
03:20:08
liability or responsibility.
It's an improper
03:20:10
argument and I move for mistrial.
THE COURT:
I deny the mistrial because I
don't even understand your objection.
03:20:12
03:20:14
03:20:17 4584
MR. FURR:
The objection if you want me to
03:20:18
restate it, RJ Reynolds, like everyone else, has
03:20:19
a First Amendment right to defend lawsuits
03:20:23
brought against it.
And the decision to defend
03:20:25
a lawsuit rather than admit liability cannot be
03:20:29
the basis for imposing liability or punitive
damages.
03:20:32
03:20:35
THE COURT:
So what?
You're right, but so
03:20:35
what?
MR. FURR:
That's what she just argued.
THE COURT:
No, she didn't.
Overruled.
(Sidebar discussion was concluded, and the
following proceedings were held in open court:)
MS. BAKER-BARNES:
May I proceed, Your
Honor?
THE COURT:
Go ahead.
03:20:36
03:20:37
03:20:39
03:20:39
03:20:56
03:20:56
03:20:59
03:20:59
MS. BAKER-BARNES:
Members of the jury, ask
03:21:00
yourself what you heard from the defendant,
RJ Reynolds, today.
How many times during
03:21:01
03:21:02
Juanita Thurston's lifetime did they do what's
03:21:08
right?
Zero.
03:21:11
How many times did they come in here today
03:21:13
and say to you, we acknowledge that addiction is
03:21:16
what caused her mother's death; we admit we were
03:21:19 4585
wrong and we accept it?
MR. FURR:
Objection, Your Honor.
Same
objection I made before.
THE COURT:
Same ruling, overruled.
MS. BAKER-BARNES:
Zero.
How many times did they come in today and
03:21:26
03:21:27
03:21:28
03:21:29
03:21:32
03:21:34
say to Gwen Odom, we accept responsibility for
03:21:36
causing your mother's death?
MR. FURR:
Same objection, Your Honor.
THE COURT:
Same ruling.
Proceed.
MS. BAKER-BARNES:
Zero.
03:21:39
03:21:40
03:21:42
03:21:44
03:21:44
They talked to you about guiding principles
03:21:44
and beliefs, their core values.
All of those
03:21:47
things they talked to you about had nothing to
03:21:52
do with Juanita Thurston, with her life, with
03:21:55
the 25 years that they took away from her and
03:21:57
her mother.
You heard that they've been punished in
03:22:02
03:22:07
lawsuits brought by other people.
Again, this
03:22:10
case is not about other lawsuits.
This case is
03:22:13
not about other people.
This case is about
Juanita Thurston.
03:22:16
03:22:18
They brought you pamphlets and videos about
03:22:25
youth smoking.
Where were those pamphlets and
03:22:29 4586
videos when Juanita Thurston was smoking
03:22:32
cigarettes?
Where was the activism that they
03:22:35
showed you on the witness stand today when
03:22:38
Juanita Thurston was smoking cigarettes?
That's
03:22:41
the conduct that we're talking about today.
03:22:43
That's the conduct that you decided should be
03:22:46
punished.
03:22:50
Today, members of the jury, your message is
03:22:57
important.
The message you send today will tell
03:23:01
the defendants and will tell others that there
03:23:05
are consequences for intentional and wrongful
03:23:11
conduct; that members of the jury, like each and
03:23:14
every one of you, when companies like
03:23:19
RJ Reynolds needlessly take lives, like Juanita
03:23:22
Thurston's life, that there are consequences and
03:23:27
that it's not sufficient to come back and say
03:23:31
now that we're different, because we're talking
03:23:33
about conduct that took a life.
03:23:37
There's a section of your instructions that
03:23:45
you'll see that talks about the reason that
03:23:47
punitive damages are imposed.
And it's not just
03:23:51
punishment to RJ Reynolds, but there's a second
03:23:55
section there.
You will determine the amount of
03:23:58
punitive damages to be assessed as a deterrent
03:24:02
to others.
03:24:05 4587
And that's the message, and that's why it's
03:24:08
important, and that's why what you do here today
03:24:11
makes a difference.
You are sending the message
03:24:14
to companies and people alike that this kind of
03:24:19
conduct will not be tolerated.
What you do here
03:24:22
today is important.
03:24:28
They talked to you about e-cigarettes, SNUS,
03:24:33
Premier --
03:24:38
And was it VASE or VUSE?
I can't remember.
03:24:40
MR. GARCIA:
VUSE.
03:24:45
MS. BAKER-BARNES:
VUSE, products that were
03:24:46
not even around when Juanita Thurston was alive.
03:24:48
You heard Dr. Figlar come in here and tell you
03:24:52
today that VUSE was launched today.
Today is
03:24:55
not about the launch of VUSE.
It's not about
03:24:59
Premier.
It's about Juanita Thurston.
It's
about the actions that they took, the
03:25:02
03:25:07
intentional actions that they took that resulted
03:25:11
in her death.
How many times did you hear them
03:25:14
come in today and acknowledge, our actions
resulted in this woman's death?
MR. FURR:
Same objection, Your Honor.
MS. BAKER-BARNES:
Zero.
THE COURT:
Overruled.
03:25:19
03:25:23
03:25:26
03:25:28
03:25:29
MS. BAKER-BARNES:
Ask yourselves, members
03:25:30 4588
of the jury, they brought in Dr. Figlar, the
03:25:38
vice-president, the face of the company for you
03:25:41
here today, the face of RJ Reynolds, did he come
03:25:43
in and admit and say, you know what, members of
03:25:47
the jury, we marketed to children and we're not
03:25:50
going to do it anymore; we did it in the past?
03:25:52
Did he admit that?
No.
Did he come in and admit to you that
03:25:56
03:25:58
millions have died from addiction to cigarette
03:26:00
smoking?
No.
Did he come in and admit to you that
03:26:02
03:26:03
RJ Reynolds, that we did this, we conspired to
03:26:05
hide the hazards of smoking, we did it and we
03:26:09
acknowledge it?
No.
MR. FURR:
Same objection, Your Honor.
THE COURT:
Come on up here.
(The following discussion was held at
sidebar:)
THE COURT:
Mr. Furr, I know you to be a
03:26:12
03:26:15
03:26:16
03:26:11
03:26:11
brilliant lawyer, but for the life of me I don't
03:26:13
understand your objections.
03:26:15
MR. FURR:
My objection is that the effect
03:26:16
of the argument that counsel is making is that
03:26:19
we should be punished for failing to make
admissions of past wrongdoing and that that
03:26:22
03:26:24 4589
violates our First Amendment rights and due
process.
THE COURT:
This is Phase II, sir.
MR. FURR:
Yes, sir.
03:26:27
03:26:30
03:26:30
03:26:33
THE COURT:
They've already determined that
03:26:33
they should consider whether your client should
03:26:36
be punished for the acts they found in Phase I.
03:26:39
MR. FURR:
I understand that, sir.
THE COURT:
I don't understand your
objection.
MR. FURR:
My objection is she is arguing
03:26:43
03:26:44
03:26:45
03:26:46
that we should be punished for failure to admit
03:26:49
of wrongdoing in the past.
03:26:52
THE COURT:
Overruled.
And the motions for
03:26:53
mistrial that I assumed were inherent in your
03:26:56
renewed objections are also overruled.
MR. FURR:
Thank you, sir.
(Sidebar discussion was concluded, and the
following proceedings were held in open court:)
MS. BAKER-BARNES:
May I proceed, Your
Honor?
THE COURT:
You may.
MS. BAKER-BARNES:
Did Dr. Figlar come in
03:26:59
03:27:01
03:27:18
03:27:18
03:27:21
03:27:21
03:27:22
and admit that the cigarettes they make today
03:27:33
are just as dangerous as any cigarette that was
03:27:33 4590
ever smoked?
Didn't hear it from him.
Did they come in and admit that they
manipulated the chemistry of cigarettes to
create and sustain addiction for years and
years?
Didn't hear it.
03:27:33
03:27:33
03:27:34
03:27:36
03:27:40
Did they ever come in and admit to you that
03:27:42
filters are a fraud?
Didn't hear it.
03:27:44
Today, members of the jury, you get to stand
03:27:48
up for Juanita Thurston.
Today the message that
03:27:53
you send will make a difference.
So how do you do it?
How do you go about
03:27:58
03:28:05
taking the steps to punish the defendant for the
03:28:11
conduct, not for what they're doing today, but
03:28:15
for the conduct that caused the death of her
mother?
03:28:18
03:28:22
You will see in the instructions that one of
03:28:25
the things that you should consider under
03:28:28
subsection 2 is Reynolds' financial resources.
03:28:31
That's not my words.
That's the law.
And
there's a reason that it's the law.
Because
03:28:35
03:28:40
you've seen from the defendant's own conduct and
03:28:44
from their own documents that what matters to
03:28:49
RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company, what gets their
03:28:55
attention is money.
That's why they spent 50
03:28:58
years continuing their conspiracy and continuing
03:29:06 4591
their campaign of doubt and denial.
That's why
03:29:10
they practiced with Dr. Figlar for a year
03:29:16
getting him prepared to come in and testify in
03:29:20
cases like this, not to stand up for others, not
03:29:24
to stand up for Juanita Thurston, but to protect
03:29:27
their money.
That's what gets their attention.
03:29:30
And so the law is that the punishment in a
03:29:35
punitive damages phase of a case, the punishment
03:29:43
has to be material.
It needs to be meaningful.
03:29:46
And so how do you impose a meaningful
03:29:51
punishment on RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company?
How
03:29:54
do you --
03:29:57
MR. FURR:
Objection, Your Honor.
I have to
03:29:58
approach.
I'm sorry.
THE COURT:
All right.
Come on up.
(The following discussion was held at
sidebar:)
03:30:00
03:30:01
03:29:54
03:29:56
THE COURT:
I, again, don't know what your
03:29:56
objection is.
03:29:58
MR. FURR:
Counsel is instructing on the law
03:29:58
outside of the instructions.
She's just told
03:30:01
the jury that the punishment has to be material
03:30:04
and meaningful.
Those terms or those concepts
03:30:06
are nowhere in the instructions given by the
Court.
03:30:09
03:30:12 4592
THE COURT:
What else you got?
MR. FURR:
That's it.
THE COURT:
Overruled.
MR. FURR:
Thank you.
(Sidebar discussion was concluded, and the
following proceedings were held in open court:)
THE COURT:
Objection is overruled.
03:30:12
03:30:14
03:30:15
03:30:31
03:30:31
MS. BAKER-BARNES:
What would a meaningful
03:30:34
punishment be for RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company in
03:30:50
this case?
You have in evidence and you will have in
03:30:52
03:30:55
evidence documents that identify RJ Reynolds,
03:30:57
how much money they made in 2012 and 2013 in net
03:31:04
sales.
Baron, can you just help me out with this
for a minute this?
I'm trying to get the --
VIDEO TECH:
Sure.
Need help.
03:31:10
03:31:11
03:31:13
03:31:17
MS. BAKER-BARNES:
I want them to be able to
03:31:19
see right there.
Thank you, Baron.
You'll see their net sales for 2013, and
03:31:22
03:31:23
03:31:28
this is in billions, 6,728,000,000 in 2013.
And
03:31:31
at the bottom where it's highlighted here, RJR
03:31:40
Tobacco, that's profit, 3,132,000,000.
03:31:44
Now, I did some calculations before I came
03:31:55 4593
here to talk to you today so that you could get
03:31:57
an understanding of exactly what those numbers
03:32:00
mean.
We've been here in trial in 17 days.
In
03:32:03
17 days RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company has made 306
03:32:06
million dollars in cigarette sales just while
03:32:11
we've been in this trial.
That comes down to
03:32:15
about 18 million -- it's a little over 18
million dollars a day, in one day.
What Gwen Odom wouldn't give to have her
03:32:18
03:32:19
03:32:24
mother Juanita Thurston back for just one day to
03:32:30
say good-bye, to tell her all the things that
03:32:39
she didn't get to tell her before she died.
Just one day.
03:32:42
03:32:46
We believe that a meaningful punishment for
03:32:49
RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company in this case, a
03:32:53
punishment that will be heard all the way back
03:32:57
in Winston-Salem, North Carolina is 18 million
03:33:00
dollars.
One day, one day of sales for
RJ Reynolds.
03:33:04
03:33:08
It won't put them out of business.
You'll
03:33:12
get instructions in this case that you can't
bankrupt a company.
It won't bankrupt them.
03:33:17
03:33:20
But it will be reported.
Dr. Figlar will report
03:33:28
it back in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and
03:33:32
the message that you send will be heard loud and
03:33:37 4594
clear.
Now, you may hear in this case:
We've
changed.
What difference would it make to
impose punishment on us in this case?
What
difference would it make in terms of the
information that's given to smokers or the
03:33:40
03:33:42
03:33:52
03:33:54
03:33:58
03:34:00
information that we give to the public health
03:34:03
authorities?
What difference would it make in
03:34:06
this case?
And you may be asked to put a zero
03:34:08
on the line on that verdict form.
You may be
03:34:18
asked not to impose punitive damages in this
03:34:20
case.
Ask yourselves what message will we be
03:34:25
sending if we put a zero on that line?
What
03:34:40
message will we be sending if we put a zero on
03:34:43
that line?
Well, members of the jury, if you want to
send a message that you condone this kind of
conduct, that intentional conduct that takes
lives is acceptable, that it's okay because
03:34:46
03:34:47
03:34:49
03:34:52
03:34:57
you're different now, then put a zero on that
03:35:02
line, because that's the message that you'll be
03:35:06
sending.
You're punishing RJ Reynolds for what
happened to her mother.
This is Gwen Odom's
03:35:09
03:35:13
03:35:17
only day in court.
This is Juanita Thurston's
03:35:20 4595
only chance for justice.
She doesn't get to
come back.
You've heard about cases, other
03:35:25
03:35:28
cases that they've been involved in and other
03:35:31
instances in which they've been sued, but none
03:35:34
of those cases had anything to do with Juanita
03:35:37
Thurston.
Today you get to stand up for her.
03:35:40
We ask that you render a verdict of 18
03:35:50
million dollars to punish RJ Reynolds, and we
03:35:53
ask that you render a verdict of no more than 24
03:35:58
million dollars.
We're asking that you don't --
03:36:03
that you don't render a verdict of more than
03:36:06
that.
We want you to render a verdict that will
03:36:08
send a message, that will not bankrupt the
03:36:11
company, that will not put them out of business.
03:36:15
We want you to send the message that this is
03:36:19
important; that in the United States of America
03:36:22
we demand accountability, in the United States
03:36:27
of America we demand responsibility.
We don't
03:36:34
just stand up for ourselves; we stand up for
03:36:36
others.
And today in Palm Beach County in the
03:36:39
case of Juanita Thurston versus RJ Reynolds
Tobacco Company we stood up for Juanita
Thurston.


MR. GARCIA:
Thank you, Your Honor.
So let me just leave you with some final
04:37:24
04:37:26
04:37:27
04:37:29
04:37:29
04:37:30
04:37:32
thoughts, something to chew on while you're back
04:37:35
there.
How many times did you hear that this
04:37:38
case is about -- go ahead and pass out the
candy.
04:37:41
04:37:46
How many times did you hear that this case
04:37:46
was about Juanita Thurston and only about
04:37:49
Juanita Thurston?
How many times did you hear
04:37:53
that this case was about this time period, what
04:37:57
happened between May 5 of '82 and '87?
It was
04:38:00
drilled into you that this was the specific time
04:38:05
period for the bad conduct and that it had to
04:38:09
relate specifically to Juanita Thurston.
04:38:13
So what did you hear today?
Everything that
04:38:15
you heard today, if you have your jury
04:38:17
instructions, relates to jury instruction number
04:38:20
4, which is the one that talks about the fact
04:38:22
that you can consider mitigating evidence.
Mitigating, the word "mitigating" means to
04:38:24
04:38:26 4635
lessen, so anything that would help you decide
04:38:29
whether punitive damages are either not
04:38:32
warranted or should be reduced.
It's up to you
04:38:34
to decide, right?
04:38:37
But here's what I want you to ask yourself
04:38:40
when you're back there deliberating.
What did
04:38:43
you hear?
You heard that all those guys that
04:38:47
used to be with the company are gone, in fact,
04:38:52
some of them are even dead; that all of these
04:38:56
things that happened in the past are way in the
04:39:02
past.
In essence, what the defense has asked
04:39:06
you to do is to forget the past, forget those
04:39:13
guys that worked at the company, they're not
04:39:18
there anymore.
But here's what's also implicit
04:39:20
in that request.
Implicit in that request is
04:39:27
that you also forget about Gwen's mother
04:39:29
Juanita.
And you can't.
You can't forget about
04:39:34
the past in a case like this.
The past cannot
04:39:37
be forgotten.
And the defense was right, we talked
extensively during jury selection about the
04:39:40
04:39:42
04:39:45
notion that if someone does something bad and
04:39:48
they do right with their punishment by either
04:39:54
paying for the consequences, doing time in jail
04:39:58
or paying restitution, then the slate gets wiped
04:40:01 4636
clean.
And what I suggest to you that when you
04:40:10
were asked to consider all of this evidence that
04:40:12
relates to instruction number 4, what you were
04:40:14
being asked to do is to skip that step that
04:40:17
requires you under the law to consider, as the
04:40:23
first instruction requires you to do,
04:40:28
punishment, punishment to the defendant and as a
04:40:34
deterrent to others, because the amount, the
04:40:36
amount of punitive damages award once assessed
04:40:39
and paid is what wipes the slate clean.
So any effort to suggest to you that you
04:40:45
04:40:51
should forget the past, forget Juanita Thurston
04:40:56
is an intellectually dishonest request.
It is
04:41:01
inconsistent with what we discussed during jury
04:41:07
selection.
And Ms. Barnes gave you a couple of
04:41:14
suggestions as to how you can do it.
Ultimately
04:41:16
it's up to you, but she was very clear, it
should not be more than 24 million, the 24
04:41:19
04:41:21
relates to Juanita's life expectancy from the
04:41:26
time of her death.
Ask yourself in relationship to this
04:41:29
04:41:30
vice-president that came and talked to you about
04:41:34
the company's guiding principles and beliefs
04:41:37
whether those are just words on a website and
04:41:41
whether there's any real substance to it.
You
04:41:47 4637
know what the company's guiding principles and
04:41:49
beliefs were over the 50-year period that
04:41:53
included Juanita Thurston's life.
The company
04:41:55
and the co-conspirators recorded those guiding
04:42:03
principles and beliefs over a period of 50
04:42:07
years.
And this witness got up here today and
04:42:11
tried to avoid being aware of some of them.
04:42:14
At the end of the day what they want you to
04:42:20
do is they want you to forget the past, because
04:42:23
if you do they get to keep their money.
And
04:42:26
Ms. Barnes was correct, that's the only thing
04:42:31
that will get their attention.
04:42:34
Let me just bring your attention to a couple
04:42:35
of items on the financial statement that you'll
04:42:38
have with you.
And so that we're clear, the numbers that
04:42:41
04:42:47
I've circled relate to RJR Tobacco so that when
04:42:49
you see that there's an 8 billion dollar number
04:42:55
that also takes into account some other
04:42:58
entities.
The only numbers that relate to RJR
04:43:02
are the 6.7 billion in revenue for 2013 and the
04:43:05
2.587 billion for profit, okay.
That number at
04:43:09
the bottom there of the 3 billion relates to all
04:43:13
the other entities.
Now, what you will see if you compare it
04:43:17
04:43:19 4638
with 2012 is that the company enjoyed a 49
04:43:22
percent increase in profit from 2012 to 2013.
04:43:25
So despite all of the other evidence that has
04:43:30
nothing to do with Juanita Thurston, all of the
04:43:34
mitigating evidence about all the money they
04:43:37
have to pay for FDA regulation, the exercise in
04:43:40
trying to get you to speculate about what may
04:43:46
happen in other cases, you know, all the other
04:43:52
stuff evidence that has nothing to do with
04:43:55
Juanita Thurston's case.
The numbers speak for
04:43:57
themselves.
The company is successful.
04:44:01
And so let me suggest to you that the number
04:44:02
really does need to resonate in Winston-Salem so
04:44:07
that this company gets the message and so that
04:44:12
this company knows that people like Juanita
Thurston should never, ever be forgotten,
04:44:15
04:44:19
because if they are that would just be wrong.
04:44:24
Thank you.
