          13           MR. GEISE:  May it please the court, Madam
          14 Counsel, Counsel, Mr. Pickett, and ladies and gentlemen of 15 the jury?
          16           Once again, it's the bottom of an inning.  And,
          17 once again, I want to thank you for your service to this
          18 court and to this trial.
          19           I said it before and I'm going to say it again, we
          20 wouldn't have a jury trial without the jurors.  I'm sure
          21 when you came to the courthouse a couple of weeks ago you
          22 weren't sure what was in store for you.
          23           And I know two weeks goes fast for us being
          24 involved in it, but it's probably felt like a very long time
          25 to the nine of you. 61 In that time we went from winter to spring.  When
           2 we started the trial, Tim Tebow was the quarterback for the
           3 Broncos, now he's a quarterback for the Jets.  And while
           4 this has been a long time, we appreciate your service.
           5           For the lawyers, we have to be here.  If any of
           6 you are movie fans, you might remember in Godfather II
           7 there's a scene where a mobster says to Michael Corleone,
           8 This is the business we've chosen.  And for us at counsel
           9 table this is the business we've chosen.
          10           But for you, you got drafted into this.  And there
          11 are a whole range of ways that people can serve this great
          12 country.
          13           If you look, a simple way might be, next month, 14 just pay your taxes.  But then the ultimate price is paid by
          15 those who are laid to rest in Arlington or on the beaches of
          16 Normandy.  And I submit that your jury service is very high
          17 on that list.
          18           So whatever you decide in this trial, whatever
          19 your verdict is over the next day, you can go back to your
          20 family, to your friends, and to your coworkers and you can
          21 tell them what a great civic duty you performed.  So, once
          22 again, on behalf of myself, Mr. Parrish, my client and my
          23 team, we want to thank you.
          24           Now, when we first got together, I told you that
          25 this case was about -- not about other smokers, but about 62 Mr. Pickett, Sr., and specifically about the choices that he
           2 made, not the choices other smokers made.  And as this case
           3 draws to a close, that's what it's still about.
           4           Last week I told you you would hear an avalanche
           5 of testimony that had absolutely nothing to do with
           6 Mr. Pickett, Sr., and you did.
           7           In fact, you've heard a little bit about it today.
           8 And I'm sure in the next half hour for Mr. Wilner, after I
           9 sit down, you'll hear a whole lot more about it.  You'll see
          10 memos that were created in Richmond, Virginia, or in New
          11 York by scientists.
          12           You may see documents that were prepared over in 13 Europe.  You may see an ad for Marlboro featuring Julie
          14 London singing a song, a brand that Mr. Pickett never
          15 smoked.
          16           You may see, again, an ad for Dick Van Dyke for
          17 Kent cigarettes, again, cigarettes Mr. Pickett never smoked.
          18 You may see documents created before Mr. Pickett was ever
          19 born and you may see documents created after Mr. Pickett
          20 passed away.  And you saw that from the witnesses in this
          21 case.
          22           Dr. Burns came to you and he showed you pictures
          23 of lungs taken from veterans in the 1950s.  And he talked
          24 about autopsies in that same decade.  But he didn't show you
          25 any pictures of Mr. Pickett's lungs.  And we know that 63 Mr. Pickett never had an autopsy.
           2           You saw hour after hour after hour of testimony
           3 from Dr. Cummings and Dr. Burns.  And they tried to prove
           4 the things that didn't need to be proven, things that Judge
           5 Hodges had already told you had been resolved in that other
           6 case that Mr. Wilner talked about, things that I told you in
           7 opening statement were not at issue.
           8           Dr. Cummings spent the better part of a day
           9 telling you that cigarette smoking is addictive.  You heard
          10 that from Judge Hodges and you heard that from me on day one
          11 of this trial.  It wasn't an issue then for you to decide 12 and it's not an issue now.
          13           Dr. Burns spent a large part of his testimony
          14 talking to you that smoking causes cancer.  Again, you heard
          15 that from Judge Hodges and you heard that from me on day one
          16 of this trial.  It wasn't an issue then and it's not an
          17 issue now.
          18           And one of the things I also predicted during my
          19 opening statement is that you would hear from plaintiff's
          20 professional witnesses who would tell you half of a story.
          21 And make no mistake about it, Dr. Burns and Dr. Cummings are
          22 professional witnesses.
          23           You saw last week that they were hopscotching from
          24 floors in this courthouse going from trial to trial.  And as
          25 soon as Mr. -- or Dr. Burns was off the stand in our case, 64 he was off to yet another trial to testify.
           2           In fact, it's probably hard for them to keep their
           3 cases straight.  You remember Dr. Cummings.  He started
           4 telling you about an ad, but it was an ad he didn't show
           5 you; it was an ad he showed the jury downstairs.  It's hard
           6 to keep it straight.
           7           The other thing that was hard to keep straight was
           8 Dr. Cummings' answers.  How many times did I have to
           9 confront him with his prior testimony and say, Do you
          10 remember when you were asked this question before?  And do 11 you remember when you gave this answer before?  And, then,
          12 why are you giving me a different answer today?
          13           Mr. Wilner talked about the jury instructions
          14 you're going to see.  And one of the things you're going to
          15 see in the jury instructions is that if there is evidence
          16 that at some other time the witness said something which was
          17 different than the testimony the witness gave before you
          18 during this trial, you can take that into consideration in
          19 weighing that witness' testimony.
          20           I told you that these professional testifiers
          21 would tell you half the story.  And they delivered.  Let me
          22 give you some examples.
          23           You heard from Dr. Cummings about all of the
          24 relapsed smokers from Dr. Cummings' clinic in Buffalo, New
          25 York.  But he failed to mention to you that Mr. Pickett's 65 ex-wife, Kathleen Bryant, successfully quit.  He failed to
           2 mention that Mr. Pickett's brother Leonard successfully
           3 quit.  And he failed to mention that Mr. Pickett's
           4 sister-in-law, Linda, successfully quit.
           5           And maybe most incredibly Dr. Cummings never
           6 mentioned on direct examination that Mr. Pickett, Sr. quit
           7 smoking.
           8           Now, Ronald Reagan had a phrase that became
           9 famous.  He said, Facts are stubborn things.  And apparently 10 those facts were just too stubborn for Dr. Cummings to
          11 bother to mention to you.
          12           You remember when I asked him, why didn't you tell
          13 the jury during your six hours of direct examination that
          14 from your review of the records, Mr. Pickett, Sr. quit?  And
          15 do you remember his response?  Do you remember this?  He
          16 said, I wasn't asked.
          17           Dr. Burns showed you charts and Mr. Wilner was
          18 drawing charts.  And he may not be a good drawer, but he
          19 would certainly beat me in a game of Pictionary.  And he's
          20 drawing charts and he's drawing charts about lung cancer
          21 rates.
          22           And so I asked Dr. Burns:  Dr. Burns, how many of
          23 these people on these charts spent 35 years working in an
          24 auto body shop?  He didn't know.
          25           At the end of one day of testimony, you were 66 played an ad for Winston cigarettes featuring the
           2 Flintstones.  And I'd submit that they put it into evidence
           3 at the end of the day and played it for you without any
           4 context.
           5           And they did that for one reason, to let that
           6 fester overnight, to let that be your final thing you
           7 thought about leaving the courtroom.  And they didn't want
           8 you to know the stubborn facts about that ad. 9           The stubborn facts they didn't tell you -- you had
          10 to wait until the next day.  You had to wait until I had an
          11 opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Cummings.
          12           And when I did, these are the stubborn facts that
          13 came out.  The Flintstones, when it debuted, was an adult
          14 comedy, modeled after the Honeymooners.  And it aired in the
          15 evening, not on Saturday mornings.
          16           And the co-sponsor was Alka-Seltzer, not a
          17 children's product.  And when it debuted Mr. Pickett had
          18 already made the choice to start smoking.  And when it went
          19 to Saturday mornings, Reynolds wasn't an advertiser anymore.
          20           And the final stubborn fact that Dr. Cummings
          21 didn't share with you is that there's absolutely no evidence
          22 that Mr. Pickett, Sr. ever watched the Flintstones or ever
          23 saw that ad.
          24           You also heard a little bit from Mr. Wilner
          25 earlier this afternoon and throughout this trial that 67 Reynolds wasn't trying to make cigarettes less hazardous,
           2 they were trying to make them more addictive.  Really?
           3           Dr. Cummings showed you a lot of memos, a lot of
           4 documents, from bench-level scientists, from ordinary RJR
           5 employees, but Dr. Cummings didn't show you one that I
           6 showed him.
           7           Can we look at the first demonstrative, please? 8           Remember this letter?  1968.  This is a letter
           9 from the president of Reynolds to the top guy in research
          10 and development.
          11           In 1968 the president sends this to the head of
          12 R and D.  And what does he say?  What are these two
          13 paragraphs that Dr. Cummings didn't show you?
          14           Areas of special emphasis.  In cooperation with
          15 others, you should push the work concerning tobacco and
          16 health.  You should prepare a plan to foster any
          17 relationship with government personnel in the quest for
          18 mutual understanding of facts ultimately to gain their
          19 cooperation in proper research of the subject.
          20           And the second paragraph, If there is a safer
          21 cigarette, let's continue and increase our efforts in the
          22 this program.  Please prepare a plan to carry it out.
          23           This is 1968.  This is at the beginning of the
          24 National Cancer Institute's Tobacco Working Group to develop
          25 a safer and less hazardous cigarette.  This memo wasn't 68 prepared to be a trial exhibit.
           2           This is what they were doing in 1968.  And it's a
           3 directive to continue doing it, which means the work had
           4 already started.  And they wanted to increase their efforts
           5 to develop a safer cigarette.
           6           You heard a little bit throughout the trial about 7 how the companies supposedly attacked and smeared the
           8 Surgeon General, but you also heard that the plaintiff
           9 attacked Dr. Hague.  You might remember his name.  He was
          10 the guy who co-edited what was called The Green Monster.
          11 And that was the primary source of information for the 1964
          12 Surgeon General report.
          13           And maybe the final, most cynical smear of all is
          14 showing you internal company research about nicotine, and
          15 suggesting that this shows that research was done to find a
          16 level of nicotine to keep smokers addicted.
          17           Now, I can't lie to you.  I'll grant that some of
          18 the language in some of these memos is just plain stupid.
          19 Dr. Gentry told you yesterday he didn't agree with some of
          20 it and didn't think it represented the policy of the
          21 company.
          22           And I'm sure if we look back, there's probably
          23 something in an e-mail or a text that we write -- that if
          24 you look back after a few months or a few years, you might
          25 not be too proud of. 69 But the stubborn facts about the research, the
           2 facts that we had to put on in cross-examination, or we had
           3 to put on through Dr. Gentry, is:  Why was Reynolds doing
           4 that research on nicotine?  Why?
           5           They were doing it at the urging of the public 6 health authorities, including those in the United States and
           7 those in Britain.
           8           And it was done in conjunction with the National
           9 Cancer Institute and their Tobacco Working Group.  This is
          10 the country's highest and most prestigious scientific
          11 organization.
          12           And it was also research done at the instigation
          13 of the 1981 Surgeon General's report.  And the research was
          14 done to try to find a way to make a less hazardous
          15 cigarette.
          16           Why?  Why did they look at this?  Why did they
          17 look at the nicotine level?  Why did they look at the tar
          18 level?
          19           Because the theory at that time was you want to
          20 get the tar down, because tar contains carcinogens.  Get it
          21 down.  Tar kills.  But keep a medium level of nicotine,
          22 because they wanted people to keep smoking that.  The public
          23 health community thought, If that's why people smoke, let's
          24 keep the level so they smoke this and get less tar.
          25           And on cross-examination Dr. Cummings admitted 70 this.  But why did you have to wait for cross-examination to
           2 hear it?  Why wasn't he just up front with you on this when
           3 he showed you the document?
           4           And the answer is simple.  The answer is to get 5 you mad.  Because if you get mad, you might decide this case
           6 on emotion and feelings, rather than on the facts of this
           7 case and the facts of Mr. Pickett, Sr.
           8           Because if you focus on the facts of Cummings
           9 Pickett, Sr., instead of the facts of Dr. Cummings, the
          10 plaintiff loses.  And this case is about Mr. Pickett, Sr.
          11 It's not about Dr. Cummings.
          12           You remember in opening statement I talked about
          13 the plaintiff has to build a bridge, a bridge based on
          14 evidence, a bridge between anything that Reynolds did or
          15 anything that Reynolds said and a smoking decision made by
          16 Mr. Pickett, Sr.?
          17           For purposes of the verdict form that Mr. Wilner
          18 walked you through, you'll see that this is something --
          19 this is what's in quotes.  This is legal cause.  That's
          20 called reliance.
          21           So when you get to the questions on the verdict
          22 form that talk about reliance, what reliance is, building a
          23 bridge -- wherever it says reliance, it means they have to
          24 build the bridge between the conduct or statement and
          25 Mr. Pickett, Sr. 71 Now, Dr. Cummings told you on cross-examination --
           2 and I want to look down so I get this right.  There is no
           3 way that you can rely on something that you don't see or 4 hear.
           5           There is no way to rely on something that you
           6 don't see or hear.  There is no way to build a bridge
           7 between something you don't see and hear and Mr. Pickett,
           8 Sr.
           9           And in this case, ladies and gentlemen, there is
          10 no evidence, none, that Mr. Pickett, Sr. saw or heard
          11 anything from R.J. Reynolds.
          12           For that matter, there is no evidence that he saw
          13 or heard anything from TIRC, CTR, TI, Brown & Williamson,
          14 the American Tobacco Company.  Nothing.  No evidence.
          15           So they can talk about things that happened.  But
          16 if they don't build that bridge with evidence that the
          17 plaintiff ever saw it or he ever read it or he ever heard
          18 it, then it doesn't matter.  And the plaintiff here cannot
          19 meet his burden of proof with proof of nothing.
          20           Now, in addition to not having any evidence that
          21 Mr. Pickett, Sr. ever saw or heard anything, you also can't
          22 meet your burden of proof with gimmicks.
          23           And you saw a few gimmicks over the last few
          24 weeks.  Now, what am I talking about?  Well, gimmick number
          25 one -- you heard a little bit today and you heard in opening 72 statement that Mr. Wilner said Mr. Pickett, Sr. was partly
           2 at fault for his smoking decisions. 3           Well, you heard that from Mr. Wilner.  But you
           4 know who you didn't hear that from?  You didn't hear that
           5 from the plaintiff.
           6           When Mr. Pickett, Jr. took the witness stand, took
           7 the oath to tell the truth and told you his story,
           8 nowhere -- nowhere did he accept partial responsibility in
           9 this case.
          10           It's a gimmick.  It's a gimmick so you won't hold
          11 Mr. Pickett, Sr. partially responsible, or you won't hold
          12 him responsible at all.  It's a gimmick.
          13           Gimmick number two.  You heard that Gavin Pickett,
          14 Mr. Pickett, Sr.'s brother, testified in his deposition that
          15 he didn't remember any cigarette advertisements.  But then
          16 you also heard from him on the stand that he got called into
          17 the lawyer's office for two hours to look through a book of
          18 ads.  And I think the book's an exhibit.
          19           So, you know, he sits down for a couple of hours,
          20 wink, wink, nod, nod.  You remember this during the trial
          21 when Mr. Parrish was asking these questions.  And
          22 miraculously he shows up at court and says, Yeah, I think I
          23 can remember a couple of these ads now.  Not many.  But I
          24 can remember a couple of them.  Well, that's fine.
          25           But even with his recollection being refreshed, 73 you know what else he said?  He said he couldn't say that 2 his brother ever saw a single one of those ads.
           3           His brother never saw them.  What do they have to
           4 do with this case, with Mr. Pickett's case?
           5           Gimmick number three, Dr. Deshmukh.  Perfectly
           6 charming, perfectly qualified doctor.  If I had an issue
           7 with a family member, I'd probably go see him.  But what was
           8 he doing here?
           9           He barely remembered Mr. Pickett, Sr. from over 16
          10 years ago.  And he testified on the basis of an alleged
          11 chart that no longer exists.  And the documents he had
          12 didn't say a thing about smoking.  Nothing.
          13           So the records don't say anything about smoking.
          14 He doesn't remember the patient.  What's he here to tell you
          15 about?
          16           So because he didn't remember the patient and he
          17 didn't have anything on the documents, what do they do?
          18 They call Dr. Burns.
          19           Dr. Burns used to be a licensed doctor.  He's
          20 since retired.  But he never treated Mr. Pickett.  He never
          21 examined his x-rays.  He never looked at his pathology.  And
          22 he pretty much disregarded 35 years of Mr. Pickett's
          23 occupational exposures.  But he came here and he told you as
          24 a doctor that the cancer was caused by smoking.
          25           One more gimmick.  It happened on Tuesday. 74
           VIII 1 Mr. Wilner was crossing Dr. Hoffman.  And he told you and he
           2 told the court he was going to play an advertisement that
           3 featured a guy working on cars.
           4           Now, I'm sure the reason for doing that is to
           5 point out to you that, look, there's this entitlement with a
           6 guy working in an auto body shop.  Of course this would have
           7 appealed to Mr. Pickett, Sr.  We don't have any evidence
           8 that he ever saw it, but we're just going to put it out
           9 there and maybe you'll think he did.
          10           And he told us all, This is an ad for Winston, the
          11 brand at issue in this case.  So with that fanfare he played
          12 the ad.
          13           Do you remember what it was for?  It wasn't for
          14 Winston.  It was for Marlboro, a brand that Mr. Pickett, Sr.
          15 didn't smoke, a brand that my client didn't make, and a
          16 brand that is not at issue in this case.
          17           In a courtroom the bridges that they need to prove
          18 need to be built by evidence and proof, not by gimmicks.
          19 And remember again Dr. Cummings.  You can't rely on
          20 something you haven't seen or heard.  And here there is no
          21 proof, none, that Mr. Pickett, Sr. saw or heard anything
          22 from my client.  The plaintiff has built a bridge to
          23 nowhere.
          24           Now, I have spent a little more time than I
          25 planned talking about things that have nothing to do with 75
           VIII 1 Mr. Pickett, Sr.
           2           So now I want to talk about what this case is
           3 really about, Mr. Pickett, Sr. and the choices that he made.
           4 And we talk about there are a lot of details in this case.
           5           Well, the choices that Mr. Pickett, Sr. made are
           6 not little details.  They're big details.  And it's a big
           7 part of this case and it's a huge part of the evidence.  And
           8 I want to look at evidence about Mr. Pickett, Sr., not what
           9 was happening globally, not something else.  I want to talk
          10 about evidence about Mr. Pickett, Sr., because that is who
          11 this case is about.
          12           You heard a lot about him.  He seems like a great
          13 guy.  He succeeded.  He was motivated.  He was a hard
          14 worker.  Everybody who testified, the first word out of
          15 their mouth -- how would you define him?  Hard worker,
          16 go-getter.  Everyone.
          17           He left high school to support a new wife and a
          18 son.  He learned a trade at an auto body shop.  Within a
          19 short period of time his ambition drove him to leave working
          20 for others and become his own boss, so he started Pickett
          21 Brothers Body Shop.
          22           Now, he had never ran a business before.  He had
          23 never hired people.  He had never managed people.  He had
          24 never met a payroll.  But he made a plan and he succeeded at
          25 it. 76 VIII
           1           And before long he acquired the reputation of
           2 being the best car painter in the entire city.  His business
           3 continued to thrive.  And soon they moved to a new location.
           4 And thankfully the business continues to thrive today with
           5 Mr. Pickett, Jr. running it.
           6           Now, from the testimony you heard, in everything
           7 that he did, Mr. Pickett, Sr. Thought things through.  He
           8 made a plan and he executed it.  And he executed his plans
           9 successfully.
          10           When the Pickett men went deer hunting -- you
          11 heard they got up in the morning and they each had their
          12 role to play.  You make the breakfast, you get the dogs, you
          13 run the dogs.
          14           They were building a cabin.  They had plans.  They
          15 had an architect.  They worked on it.  They built it.  You
          16 heard that when he decided to build a batting cage, he did
          17 it like that.  His daughter testified that one day there
          18 wasn't a batting cage, the next day there was a batting
          19 cage.
          20           And even when he was diagnosed with lung cancer,
          21 he was clearheaded and he got his affairs in order.  He
          22 wanted to make sure there would be an orderly transfer of
          23 his homes, of his cabins, of his cars, and his business.
          24           He planned for what was going to happen, because
          25 planning for things that he wanted to do was something that    77 came naturally to Mr. Pickett.  It was part of who he was.
           2           Now, another part of who he was was a smoker.  As
           3 his sister-in-law Linda said, it was part of his everyday
           4 life.  And so it was.
           5           We talk about youth marketing.  And Mr. Wilner
           6 talks about it.  I think youth marketing is a very important
           7 concept.  But you've got to ask yourself, What does it have
           8 to do with this case?  Nobody knows when he started to
           9 smoke.  Nobody knows why he started to smoke.  Nobody knows
          10 what his first cigarette was.
          11           So to say it's because of youth marketing, that's
          12 a bridge that goes nowhere.  There's no proof about that
          13 with regard to Mr. Pickett, Sr.  Maybe other people, but not
          14 Mr. Pickett, Sr.
          15           Nobody knows why he chose the brands he chose.
          16 Nobody knows why he wound up smoking Winston for as long as
          17 he did.
          18           Now, incidentally, I believe in opening statement
          19 Mr. Wilner told you that he couldn't prove the answer to any
          20 of these questions.  And, sure enough, as we conclude this
          21 trial, the testimony you heard, they didn't prove that.
          22           But, remember, the plaintiff has the burden of
          23 building the bridge to prove that something Reynolds did
          24 affected Mr. Pickett, Sr.'s smoking decisions.  And he 25 promised you that he couldn't meet that burden, that he 78 couldn't build that bridge, and that promise was kept.  He
           2 didn't meet that burden.  He didn't build that bridge.
           3           Now, did anything Reynolds do or say influence any
           4 of Mr. Pickett, Sr.'s choices?  There is no proof that
           5 anyone in this case knows of.  And no one knows because
           6 there was never any proof of it.  And with no proof, the
           7 plaintiff loses.
           8           Now, while we don't know why Mr. Pickett, Sr.
           9 chose to smoke, we do know that he knew it was a risky
          10 activity.
          11           While the plaintiff called Dr. Cummings to talk
          12 about everything that had nothing to do with Mr. Pickett,
          13 Sr., we called Dr. Hoffman.  And it is Dr. Hoffman, not
          14 Ms. Hoffman.  We called Dr. Hoffman.  And she talked about
          15 things that had everything to do with Mr. Pickett, Sr.
          16           They might want to talk about labs in Richmond and
          17 offices in Winston-Salem.  And we saw one document about
          18 billboards in Maine.  We talked and talked and talked about
          19 the extraordinarily high level of cancer education right
          20 here in Jacksonville, right here in Duval County, including
          21 the Duval County high schools at precisely the time that
          22 Mr. Pickett, Sr. was in school here.
          23           Dr. Hoffman showed you all the sources of 24 information about smoking that were available to
          25 Mr. Pickett, Sr.  Let's look at that slide. 79 And she went through these in a lot of detail.
           2 And Mr. Parrish walked her through them one by one, what the
           3 government does, family and friends, education, pop culture,
           4 mass media, and public health organizations.
           5           Dr. Cummings wanted to talk to you about school
           6 children in Buffalo, New York, at a time that Mr. Pickett
           7 was middle-aged and living in Florida.
           8           But what Dr. Hoffman did is she showed you the
           9 actual schoolbooks that were in the Florida education system
          10 while Mr. Pickett, Sr. was in school.  And I want to look at
          11 these just briefly.
          12           For fourth grade she showed you this, Growing
          13 children never should use any form of tobacco.  Tobacco,
          14 like alcohol, is a narcotic.  It contains a kind of poison
          15 called nicotine.  Boys and girls have no need for harmful
          16 things, such as alcohol and tobacco.
          17           And in fifth grade, Tobacco contains a clear,
          18 water-like poison which is called nicotine.  Part of it is
          19 taken into the lungs with the smoke from the tobacco.
          20 Alcohol and nicotine are poisonous substances called
          21 narcotics.  Heavy smokers do not live so long as those who
          22 do not smoke. 23           And then seventh grade, Many doctors believe that
          24 smoking has an irritating effect on the mouth and throat,
          25 which may lead to respiratory infections, or to mouth and 80 lung cancer.
           2           And, finally, tenth grade.  The tobacco habit is
           3 more likely to be acquired than most other addictions.  It
           4 talks about resins.  And it concludes by saying, The
           5 American Cancer Society has found:  Lung cancer killed seven
           6 times as many cigarette smokers as nonsmokers.
           7           You saw some things with Dr. Cummings from the New
           8 York Times.  Dr. Hoffman showed you articles that ran right
           9 here in Jacksonville just as Mr. Pickett was making the
          10 choice to begin smoking.
          11           Now, the family folklore is that he started about
          12 the time he was 12 or 13.  We don't dispute that.  That was
          13 about in 1955 or 1956.
          14           Well, you saw with Dr. Hoffman in 1954 -- the
          15 classrooms here showed a video.  And it showed the mouse
          16 skin-painting test from 1953.  And it also had this
          17 diagram -- I don't know if you remember -- about when you
          18 smoke what happens to the nicotine.  And it showed it going
          19 straight up to your brain and impacting your brain.  That
          20 was in 1954 right here in Jacksonville, right here in the
          21 schools. 22           And in 1954 the American Cancer Society also found
          23 that smokers developed more lung cancer and more heart
          24 problems than nonsmokers.  And that finding was reported
          25 right here in Jacksonville.  Let's take a look. 81 November 1954.  Men aged 60 to 70, who smoke a
           2 pack of cigarettes or more daily, ran about twice the risk
           3 of dying of heart disease and cancer as nonsmokers.
           4           And there was a follow-up report three years
           5 later.  And, again, it was covered right here in
           6 Jacksonville.  Heavy cigarette smoking speeds death seven to
           7 eight years before your time, a cancer researcher estimated
           8 today.
           9           And, in fact, throughout the 1950s newspaper
          10 articles continued to highlight the risks of smoking right
          11 here in Jacksonville.  We brought another slide.  And you
          12 saw these with Dr. Hoffman.
          13           Smoking and cancer was such a big topic of concern
          14 in Jacksonville that one of the leading cancer researchers
          15 at the time, Dr. Alton Ochsner, came here to praise the
          16 efforts of the Duval County health authorities.
          17           Can we look at the next one?
          18           And this one was even covered in February of 1959
          19 in both of the Jacksonville newspapers at the time.
          20           And what did it say?  Duval County is leading the 21 world in a new preventative attack on lung cancer.
          22 Jacksonville and Duval County should be extremely proud of
          23 its unique cancer education program aimed at teenagers,
          24 1959.
          25           And, indeed, Jacksonville did lay claim to being a 82 world leader in antismoking efforts.  And you saw reports of
           2 the kind of activities that Dr. Ochsner was praising Duval
           3 County for in the 1950s.
           4           Again, cancer was a topic at a forum.  The Cancer
           5 Society had an antismoking campaign, Duval families were in
           6 a cancer study.  And there was a cancer talk by Dr. Ochsner
           7 to start the school drive.  These were all things going on
           8 right here in Jacksonville.
           9           You also saw that there was a who's who of, you
          10 know, tobacco researchers that came to Jacksonville for a
          11 premier of a video.
          12           And all of these activities were going on in
          13 Jacksonville and in the Duval County schools at the same
          14 time that Mr. Pickett, Sr. was in school here.
          15           Yes, he left high school in tenth grade, but not
          16 before the school system was addressed by Dr. Ochsner, not
          17 before this intensive educational effort was undertaken, and
          18 not before he was taught from the schoolbooks that
          19 Dr. Hoffman showed you. 20           And another thing about Dr. Hoffman, she was
          21 pressed more, Well, where did you do your research?  Where
          22 did you go?  My goodness.  She listed places up and down the
          23 state, across the country, all these places where she went
          24 to do her research for this case.
          25           Now, was this message getting across to the 83 public?  Well, Mr. Wilner told you today they got through.
           2 I agree with them on that.  The AMA agreed with them on
           3 that.  The Surgeon General thought so as well.
           4           Let's take a look.  1957, Leroy Burney, Our
           5 position is that we have informed the public through the
           6 excellent coverage of the press, radio, and TV.
           7           And the head of the NCI thought so, too, John
           8 Heller, Newspapers, radio, TV, and other media have done an
           9 excellent job of covering this problem, and a very objective
          10 job.  This is an exceedingly valuable way of informing the
          11 public.
          12           You heard about the landmark 1964 Surgeon
          13 General's report that smoking and lung cancer was first-page
          14 news across the country, including right here in
          15 Jacksonville.
          16           Again, both papers covered it on the front page.
          17 And a year later the Florida Department of Health concluded
          18 that nearly all Floridians had heard about it.  You remember 19 seeing this editorial cartoon with the skull coming out of
          20 the cigarette smoke?  And what did it say?  It said, Nearly
          21 all Floridians have heard about the Surgeon General's report
          22 from the year before.
          23           A year after that, in 1966, the message about
          24 smoking and health was put directly in the hands of smokers,
          25 including Mr. Pickett, Sr., when a warning label began 84 showing up on every cigarette pack.  And a label from 1966
           2 on was on every pack of cigarettes Mr. Pickett, Sr. picked
           3 up.
           4           And in 1968 the head of National Clearinghouse on
           5 Smoking and Health, Daniel Horn, said this, You could stand
           6 on a rooftop and shout smoking is dangerous at the top of
           7 your lungs and you would not be telling anyone anything they
           8 did not already know.
           9           I'd point out this is where Dr. Burns got his
          10 start, working at the National Clearinghouse on Smoking and
          11 Health.
          12           So awareness is widespread.  What do you do in the
          13 face of all that information?  Well, tens of millions of
          14 smokers made the choice to quit.  We saw these with
          15 Dr. Hoffman.
          16           1970, Florida Times-Union, record number kicking
          17 cigarette habit.  And in Time, 1982, Since the '64 report 18 almost 30 million people have managed to give up smoking.
          19 Surprisingly, 95 percent of the people who broke the smoking
          20 habit did so without the help of organized programs.  They
          21 did it cold turkey, did it on their own.
          22           Now, Dr. Cummings tried to tell you that until
          23 clinics like his in Buffalo came around it was really hard
          24 to find help to quit.
          25           Well, that may have been true in Buffalo, but that 85 wasn't true right here in Jacksonville, not where
           2 Mr. Pickett lived.  All you had to do was read the
           3 newspaper.  There was help in quitting frequently.
           4 Quit-smoking clinics, stop-smoking clinics, classes were
           5 offered.
           6           But we're looking at all these publications, we're
           7 looking at these newspapers, we're looking at magazines,
           8 we're looking at all of this.  You can put that aside.
           9           Mr. Pickett, Sr. did not need the newspaper boy or
          10 the mailman to deliver this news to him.  He got this news
          11 delivered to him in the most personal way possible.
          12           His ex-wife told him about the risks and urged him
          13 to quit.  His brother, after he was diagnosed with asbestos,
          14 told him about the risks, asked him to quit, and told him it
          15 would kill him.
          16           His brother Gavin told him about the risks and 17 told him and urged him to quit.  His girlfriends, Beth and
          18 Cindy, urged him, encouraged him to quit smoking.
          19           And one other person told him, too, Mr. Pickett,
          20 Sr. -- or Mr. Pickett, Jr.  He told you that when -- in the
          21 1980s he went to his dad and he told him that smoking is bad
          22 for you, it's not good for you, it's not good for your
          23 grandkids, you need to stop.  And he told you about the
          24 frustration he had that his dad continued to smoke.
          25           Now, when these relatives came one after another 86 and said, Stop smoking, it can kill you, did Mr. Pickett,
           2 Sr. ever argue with them?  Did he ever dispute what they
           3 were saying?  Did he ever say, Nah, it's not going to hurt
           4 me; nah, the tobacco company said something else; nah,
           5 there's an ad out there that makes me think it's cool and
           6 I'm going to keep doing it?  No.  Not at all.
           7           He paid all of them, as Gavin Pickett said, lip
           8 service.  Why?  Because he knew they were right.  And we
           9 showed you all the reasons why he knew they were right.  So
          10 he paid it lip service.
          11           Now, I have a couple of items I want to talk about
          12 with quitting as we start talking about addiction.  And you
          13 saw this insurance application from 1985 where Mr. Pickett,
          14 Sr. said he had not used tobacco in any form in the past 12
          15 months. 16           Now, the plaintiff didn't address this document at
          17 all in their case.  I showed it to you.  Maybe it's just
          18 another one of those stubborn facts.  I don't know.
          19           And Mr. Pickett signed his name to this
          20 application saying it was true and saying the insurance
          21 company could rely on it.  Was it true?  I don't know.
          22           We heard the testimony.  Nobody else said he quit
          23 in 1985.  But his daughter did say that he was honest and he
          24 instilled in everyone he knew integrity.  If he was telling
          25 the truth, he quit in 1985.  If he wasn't telling the truth, 87 he didn't.
           2           But even so, whether he quit in 1985 or not, we
           3 know that Mr. Pickett, Sr. quit smoking after he was
           4 diagnosed with lung cancer.
           5           Both Dr. Burns and Dr. Cummings told you that in
           6 forming their opinions that they concluded that he had
           7 stopped smoking.  And that it was in the medical records.
           8           Now, later, after he was told his condition was
           9 terminal, what did he do?  Mr. Pickett returned to the
          10 things that he enjoyed.
          11           You heard that he returned to Georgia for one
          12 last, long hunting trip with his brother.  And you heard
          13 that he returned to smoking.  And he did both because he
          14 enjoyed doing both of them. 15           So this leads us to the first question on the
          16 verdict form that Mr. Wilner walked you through:  Do you
          17 find from a preponderance of the evidence that Mr. Pickett,
          18 Sr. was addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine?
          19           So let me talk about addiction for a moment.  The
          20 fact that cigarettes contains nicotine has been known for a
          21 long time.  The fact that cigarette smoking can be addictive
          22 has been known for a long time.
          23           Dr. Cummings told you that it's been referred to
          24 as an addiction for over 100 years.  And we saw this Florida
          25 Health Note, too, that over 100 years ago, in 1906 -- the 88 Florida Board of Health said, Today the cigarette is looked
           2 upon by all smokers as the very worst form of tobacco
           3 addiction.
           4           And the 1988 Surgeon General's report, which
           5 Mr. Wilner said is in evidence -- and you can look at it.
           6 If you look at it, it told us that as early as 1942 some
           7 scientists were calling smoking as a means of administering
           8 nicotine.  And that language is very similar to what you saw
           9 in Dr. Teague's memorandum about 30 years after that.
          10           And you saw that Reader's Digest, the most popular
          11 magazine of the day, ran articles about nicotine and
          12 addiction as early as 1935.  And we have the first one up
          13 there. 14           I won't read all of this to you.  But if you look
          15 in the left-hand side, one would not like to think that one
          16 has become such a slave to tobacco that one cannot do
          17 without it.
          18           And Reader's Digest in 1938, in an article called
          19 So You're Going to Stop Smoking, Sooner or later nearly
          20 every cigarette smoker discovers that he is not smoking by
          21 choice but by habit, and that the habit is probably harmful.
          22 Sometimes half-heartedly, sometimes earnestly, he wrestles
          23 with his addiction, but in vain.
          24           In 1941, The cause of most of the trouble, of
          25 course, is nicotine.  No one has ever denied that nicotine 89 is a poison.
           2           And one more in 1950, Nicotine is the essential
           3 ingredient of tobacco.  It is what makes tobacco tobacco and
           4 not just another weed.
           5           Similar language to what you saw in Reynolds'
           6 documents.  These were not secrets locked in R.J. Reynolds'
           7 filing cabinet.  This material was out there, out there for
           8 everyone to see.  And in the situation of these Reader's
           9 Digest articles, out there before Mr. Pickett ever picked up
          10 a cigarette.
          11           So was Mr. Pickett, Sr. addicted to cigarettes
          12 containing nicotine?  Under Dr. Cummings' test, one 13 cigarette a day meets that definition.
          14           And as the finders of fact, that's your call to
          15 make.  But even if you answer yes to that first question on
          16 the verdict form, I would argue that you have to answer no
          17 to the second question.
          18           Question two asked whether from a preponderance of
          19 the evidence Mr. Pickett, Sr.'s addiction to cigarettes
          20 containing nicotine was a legal cause -- and you'll see that
          21 term in there, and it's set off by quotes because it's a big
          22 term, legal cause.  And to answer that you'll have to look
          23 at two separate issues.
          24           First, you'll have to decide whether his lung
          25 cancer was caused by an addiction or was it caused by his 90 choice to smoke.
           2           And, second, you'll have to decide that it was
           3 smoking that caused his lung cancer.  And I submit that the
           4 plaintiff has failed to carry their burden on both of those
           5 issues.
           6           Now, my discussion first about whether addiction
           7 or choice caused lung cancer presumes for the moment that
           8 the lung cancer was related to smoking.  I'll talk about
           9 that evidence second.
          10           But first I want to talk about choice.  And you
          11 heard the word choice thrown around a lot in this courtroom. 12 But it isn't the tobacco industry and it's not me as an
          13 attorney for the tobacco company that labeled smoking as a
          14 personal choice.  It's the Surgeon General of the United
          15 States.  And the Surgeon General said it not once, not
          16 twice, but repeatedly.
          17           Remember what Dr. Cummings called the Surgeon
          18 General?  The gold standard, the highest authority on
          19 smoking and health.
          20           And remember what Mr. Wilner said about the
          21 Surgeon General in his opening statement?  The Surgeon
          22 General tells you the truth.  They are right.
          23           And you saw what the Surgeon General said about
          24 smoking and choice.  Let's take a look at two examples.
          25 1977 and 1978, Cigarette smoking represents a category of 91 health problems that can be called personal choice health
           2 behavior.
           3           And then in 1986, Cigarette smoking is an
           4 addictive behavior and the individual smoker must decide
           5 whether or not to continue that behavior.
           6           After looking at studies, after going through peer
           7 reviews, after talking about it with authorities in the
           8 United States, this is how the Surgeon General referred to
           9 the choice to smoke.  It's a personal choice.
          10           Now, Dr. Cummings doesn't have any patents, but he 11 did invent one term he used for you in this courtroom,
          12 constrained choice.
          13           And he tried to tell you that constrained choice
          14 means that smokers have had a little bit of their freewill
          15 taken away.
          16           Well, did he show you anywhere in the Surgeon
          17 General's reports where they called it constrained choice?
          18 No.  In fact, no authority, other than himself, who is board
          19 certified in nothing, whose licensed in nothing -- he said
          20 he doesn't even have a license to drive in his home state of
          21 South Carolina.
          22           And from what he talked about, his trial schedule
          23 looks like the spring training schedule for the Atlanta
          24 Braves.
          25           Did anyone else, any other authority say smoking 92 is a constrained choice that you heard from in this case?
           2 No.  The Surgeon General called smoking a personal choice
           3 behavior, and did so repeatedly.
           4           Now, you did hear a couple of interesting things
           5 from Dr. Cummings.  First, he said there are some people
           6 that just don't want to quit, and, second, he admitted that
           7 even addicted smokers can quit.
           8           And you heard the statistics, 60 million smokers
           9 have quit smoking.  Now, when the question on the verdict 10 form talks about addiction and what people knew and what
          11 they relied on, don't be misled by a red herring like
          12 nicotine changes the brain.  Why?
          13           Because every one of those 60 million former
          14 smokers -- every one of the millions -- had their brains
          15 changed and they still quit, as did Leonard Pickett,
          16 Kathleen Bryant, Linda Pickett, the 60 million quitters.
          17           And Mr. Pickett's brother, his ex-wife, his
          18 sister-in-law were the same as Mr. Pickett, Sr. in every way
          19 except one.  They made a decision or a plan to quit.  And
          20 they followed through on that decision.  Nobody could make
          21 that decision for Mr. Pickett, Sr.
          22           And you remember Dr. Cummings' booklet, the Smart
          23 Move booklet?  Let's look at what he told people that came
          24 to his stop-smoking clinic.
          25           He had three questions:  Do you want to stop; are 93 you willing to make some changes in your routine; are you
           2 willing to put up with some uneasy moments after stopping?
           3           What does this mean?  It means you must want to
           4 stop.  It means you must be willing to make some changes to
           5 your daily routine.  And it means you must be willing to put
           6 up with some uneasy moments after stopping.  And if you can
           7 answer yes to these questions, you can quit smoking.
           8           And what did the Surgeon General tell people in 9 2010?  This is after the secret documents are out there for
          10 the world to see.
          11           Did that change what the Surgeon General said?
          12 No.  Here's what the Surgeon General said in 2010.  Now is
          13 the time to quit smoking.  No one can make you quit and no
          14 one can do it for you.
          15           We heard about the former Surgeon General
          16 C. Everett Koop.  This is the Surgeon General that first
          17 called smoking addictive in 1988.  This is the guy who
          18 invited Dr. Cummings to his birthday party.  This is the guy
          19 that Mr. Wilner says tells you the truth.  This is the guy
          20 that delivers the gold standard.
          21           And what words does he have for smokers in 2002?
          22 Let's take a look.  Dr. Koop says, No matter how much you
          23 have smoked or how much you like to smoke, the choice to
          24 light up is always yours.
          25           The choice.  Not the constrained choice.  The 94 choice.  And Dr. Koop continues, When you are engaged in
           2 internal warfare with yourself about whether or not to light
           3 up a cigarette, you can fortify yourself by remembering this
           4 important fact, ultimately you are the one who has control
           5 over your behavior.  Ultimately you are the one who has
           6 control over your behavior.
           7           Mr. Pickett, Sr. had control over his behavior and 8 Mr. Pickett Sr. chose to continue to smoke.  And if his
           9 cancer is caused by smoking, it's caused by his choice, his
          10 personal choice to smoke and continue to smoke, not 10
          11 percent, not 50 percent, but 100 percent.
          12           Remember again what Surgeon General Koop said,
          13 Ultimately you are the one who has control over your
          14 behavior.
          15           So you ask, Well, what about these handful of
          16 attempts -- or handful of quitting attempts we heard about?
          17 What about those?
          18           Now, Mr. Pickett, by all accounts, was a man who
          19 set a goal, made a plan, and executed it.  We saw it in his
          20 business, we saw it in his hunting, we saw it in his
          21 affairs.
          22           Did you see any plan to quit smoking ever?  And
          23 what did Mr. Pickett, Jr. say about his dad?  He said, My
          24 dad was the kind of man who would make a plan and stick to
          25 it.  He was the kind of man who took responsibility for his 95 choices and for his actions in his life.
           2           And he said he wasn't sure if he ever saw his
           3 father go maybe five or ten minutes without a cigarette.
           4 Does that sound like a plan to quit smoking?
           5           And what did his brother Gavin say?  He said that
           6 his brother Cummings was strong-willed and aggressive.  But 7 he testified that he only knew of his brother trying to quit
           8 once.  Over four years, once.  And you heard how close they
           9 were.  They were together all the time.  And he tried once.
          10           And on that occasion -- Gavin was honest with us
          11 and he said, You know what, I don't believe he was really
          12 trying to quit at all.  Does that sound like a plan?
          13           Would you call Mr. Pickett, Sr. a go-getter if his
          14 business plan was to go into Pickett Brothers Body Shop five
          15 times over the course of 35 years?  No.
          16           And, finally, Gavin Pickett testified that he
          17 pestered his brother so much about quitting that his brother
          18 moved out of the house.  That was the plan.  Instead of
          19 quitting smoking, he quit Gavin.  But Gavin -- he gave
          20 perhaps the most accurate testimony about these so-called
          21 quit attempts.
          22           Remember what he called them?  Lip service.  His
          23 brother was just giving him lip service.  And that was
          24 Mr. Pickett, Sr.'s plan.
          25           He enjoyed smoking and he didn't want to quit.  So 96 for those that were urging him to quit, he just gave them
           2 lip service.
           3           Now, why is quitting important?  Well, you heard
           4 from Dr. Burns.  Quitting smoking at any age immediately
           5 produces health benefits, immediately. 6           And Dr. Burns told you that if Mr. Pickett, Sr.
           7 had quit smoking in 1964, when the Surgeon General's report
           8 came out, after ten years of publicity here in
           9 Jacksonville -- if he had quit smoking in 1964, he would not
          10 have gotten lung cancer when he did.
          11           And Dr. Burns told you that if Mr. Pickett, Sr.
          12 had quit as late as 1980 he wouldn't have gotten cancer.
          13 1980.  That's about the time that his brother Leonard was
          14 diagnosed with asbestos, stopped smoking, told his brother,
          15 Look, you need to stop smoking; it will kill you.
          16           If Mr. Pickett had made a plan to quit then, he
          17 would not have developed lung cancer when he did.  But
          18 instead he chose to pay them lip service and keep smoking.
          19           Throughout his life Mr. Pickett, Sr. made his
          20 choices.  One of his choices was to choose to smoke and to
          21 choose not to make a plan to quit.  And that's fine.
          22           And if his lung cancer was smoking related, it was
          23 caused by that choice to smoke, not by any addiction to
          24 cigarettes containing nicotine.  Because remember, as
          25 Dr. Koop said, ultimately you are the one who has control 97 over your behavior.
           2           For that reason alone, you should answer no to
           3 question two.  And that ends it, you stop, and everybody
           4 goes home.  But there's a separate reason, an additional 5 reason that you should answer no to question number two.
           6 And you heard it from Mr. Brusick and, to some extent,
           7 Dr. Burns.
           8           The plaintiffs have the burden of proving that
           9 Mr. Pickett, Sr.'s lung cancer was smoking related.  And
          10 they did not and cannot meet that burden in this case.
          11           Mr. Pickett worked for 35 years in an auto body
          12 shop.  And I'm not going to go over all the details of that
          13 again.  And he never stopped being a hands-on owner.
          14           And in that body shop he worked in a sea of
          15 carcinogens.  And we've heard about how times change in the
          16 body shops.
          17           Back then, when he was really hands-on, in the
          18 '60s and '70s, the paint was different.  We've outlawed lead
          19 paint since then.
          20           In the 1990s they took asbestos out.  It used to
          21 be a filler.  Back then safety equipment wasn't around much
          22 and it was ineffective and safety standards were almost
          23 nonexistent.
          24           And it was in that world that Mr. Pickett, Sr.
          25 opened Pickett Brothers Body Shop.  And it was, as 98 Mr. Pickett, Jr. said -- when he started it was a hole in
           2 the wall.
           3           And even in the larger -- the former gas station 4 that now houses the business, there's always been a slop
           5 bucket.  And you may think, Oh, it's a small bucket and so
           6 what.  But this was a slop bucket that they put leftover
           7 paint, leftover lacquer, leftover solvents, and they'd go in
           8 there.  And what do they do?  They evaporate into the air.
           9 And then that air is inhaled.
          10           And Dr. Brusick told you three reasons why
          11 Mr. Pickett's occupation was sufficient to cause his cancer
          12 regardless of his cigarette smoking.
          13           Now, a word about Dr. Brusick.  I know he went on
          14 a long time yesterday about his qualifications.  I was
          15 trying to speed him up a little bit.
          16           But Dr. Brusick is pretty much the godfather of
          17 genetic toxicology.  He wrote the first textbook on the
          18 subject.
          19           And while Mr. Pickett, Sr. was working in a sea of
          20 carcinogens for those 35 years, for four years Dr. Brusick
          21 was researching those carcinogens.  And he told you three
          22 reasons why Mr. Pickett, Sr.'s exposure in his occupation
          23 was sufficient to cause his lung cancer regardless of
          24 cigarette smoking.
          25           First, the occupation of painting has been 99 classified by IARC as a lung cancer to humans, as a cause of
           2 lung cancer. 3           This is what IARC says, There is sufficient
           4 evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of occupational
           5 exposure as a painter.  Occupational exposure as a painter
           6 causes cancers of the lung.
           7           This is not a gimmick.  This is IARC.  And what is
           8 IARC?  What is the "I" in IARC?  It stands for
           9 international.
          10           And what it does is it brings together the
          11 leading, the best, and the brightest in the field of cancer
          12 causation from around the world.
          13           If you look at the IARC monograph that's in
          14 evidence, it's folks from Harvard, folks from Yale, folks
          15 from the National Cancer Institute in the United States, and
          16 their colleagues across the world.  And they come together
          17 and they review everything.  They look at everything.  And
          18 when they did, this was their conclusion.
          19           Now, Dr. Burns admitted a couple of things.  He
          20 admitted that cancers in the workplace do occur.  He
          21 admitted that they are real.  And he admitted that people
          22 die of them.
          23           But then he kind of downplayed the significance of
          24 the IARC finding.  But this finding was the consensus of
          25 scientists throughout the world.  This is a stubborn 100 scientific fact, not just the conclusion of a professional 2 witness who's made more than $2 million testifying in these
           3 cases.
           4           Now -- okay.  What about smoking?  What about
           5 smoking and how it relates to these occupational exposures?
           6 Well, IARC looked at that, too.  First they looked at it in
           7 1989.  Let's take a look.
           8           In 1989 IARC said, Looking at all the studies that
           9 were available at the time, these show a consistent excess
          10 of all cancers at about 20 percent above the national
          11 average and a consistent excess of lung cancers at about 40
          12 percent above the national average.
          13           The available evidence on the prevalence of
          14 smoking in painters, although limited, indicates that an
          15 excess risk for lung cancer of this magnitude cannot be
          16 explained by smoking alone, IARC in 1989.
          17           21 years later they confirmed this when they said,
          18 Nevertheless, when the cohort and case-control studies were
          19 taken together, the Working Group concluded that there is
          20 consistent evidence in humans that occasional exposure as a
          21 painter causes lung and urinary bladder cancer.  It does not
          22 appear that the excess mortality from these cancers is
          23 caused by the principal potential confounder, which is
          24 tobacco smoking.
          25           Both times, in 1989, 2010, IARC controlled for 101
           VIII 1 smoking.  And what they found was that being a painter by
           2 itself increases your risk of lung cancer.  And the longer
           3 you're a painter, the better your chances are of getting
           4 lung cancer because of it.  And Mr. Pickett worked in that
           5 occupation for over three decades.
           6           Now, Dr. Burns tried to quibble with me a little
           7 bit to challenge whether Mr. Pickett was actively working at
           8 the body shop for 30 years or not.
           9           But let's look how Mr. Pickett himself described
          10 what he was doing.  You saw what Dr. Brusick -- the
          11 disability records.  And you might remember I asked
          12 Dr. Burns:  Did you look at his disability records in this
          13 case, these records that talk about how he describes what he
          14 does?
          15           Dr. Burns said, I -- I don't remember if I looked
          16 at those.  Well, Dr. Brusick did look at them.  And in 1995,
          17 how did Mr. Pickett describe his own work?
          18           Well, he said he operated a spray gun, he operated
          19 sanders, he worked with others.  He wrote estimates.  He
          20 operated the frame equipment.  He did electric welding,
          21 acetylin and oxygen torches, and did MIG welding.
          22           That seems pretty hands-on to me for the time that
          23 he wrote it in 1995.  And he didn't do this stuff for a
          24 minute.  He didn't do it for half a shift.  He did it eight
          25 hours a day, five days a week for 35 years.  Now, that's 102
           VIII 1 reason number one, IARC.
           2           Reason number two that Dr. Brusick gave you was
           3 that -- the exposure to auto body painters to several Class
           4 I carcinogens in the workplace.
           5           Now, I had to fight Dr. Burns a little bit on
           6 this, but he finally conceded that, Look, yeah, there's bad
           7 stuff in paint.
           8           And what does IARC tell us about the bad stuff in
           9 paint and body shops?  Let's call the roll.  You remember
          10 when I put these Class I carcinogens up, arsenic, found in
          11 anti-fouling agents, asbestos and filler, in spackling,
          12 chromium and chromium compound in pigments, hydrocarbons,
          13 salts, nickel, pigments, silica in the filler, and talc in
          14 the filler?
          15           This is just a few of the carcinogens that you're
          16 exposed to in this occupation.  It's a sea of carcinogens.
          17 And, by the way, Dr. Burns anchored a lot of his testimony
          18 around the presence of tobacco-specific nitrosamines.  And
          19 you may hear about those when Mr. Wilner rebuts what I'm
          20 saying.
          21           Now, I am not minimizing the carcinogenicity of
          22 tobacco and specifically nitrosamines, but I am just going
          23 to point out that IARC concluded that they're a Class II
          24 carcinogen, not a Group I.
          25           So how do painters get exposed to these 103 VIII
           1 carcinogenic substances?  We went over it yesterday.  And I
           2 apologize if you know this fresh in your head, but IARC
           3 tells us that inhalation is a predominant root of exposure
           4 followed by dermal absorption to a much lesser degree.
           5           Now, I sense that a dermal absorption point --
           6 when I first heard it, it didn't quite sit with me either.
           7           So yesterday I asked Dr. Brusick -- and I said,
           8 Come on, tell me, how does absorption or skin exposure give
           9 you lung cancer?  And he explained that the carcinogens
          10 enter your skin, they get to the skin, they get to your
          11 bloodstream, and from your bloodstream they can go anywhere
          12 in your body and they can get to the lungs.
          13           So then I asked Dr. Brusick, Come on, 40 years as
          14 a genetic toxicologist, are you telling me that that can
          15 cause lung cancer?  And he said yes.
          16           An additional way is if airborne materials, that
          17 you don't necessarily inhale, can land on something, your
          18 food or something.  That's a lesser extent, but it's another
          19 one recognized by IARC.
          20           And you remember this chart that Dr. Brusick
          21 showed you yesterday?  And I don't want to go through it.
          22 But all of these methods of exposure existed in the Pickett
          23 Brothers Body Shop, inhalation, dermal, and ingestion, and
          24 they existed for 35 years.
          25           So now you're going to say, Okay, okay, but what   104 about the safety measures?  Well, for starters, IARC
           2 commented that, you know, these safety measures are really
           3 not all that effective.
           4           And Dr. Brusick took some time and showed you what
           5 modern safety precautions are taken by auto painters to
           6 protect themselves from these hazards.
           7           And you remember the picture of the -- the painter
           8 kind of dressed up like a Ghostbuster in a Hazmat suit?
           9 That's what they do today.
          10           Well, the testimony in this case shows nothing
          11 like that was ever done at the Pickett Brothers Body Shop,
          12 not at -- and that was at a time when the paint was worse.
          13 Sometimes a mask, sometimes not.  No gloves except when he
          14 was welding.  No Hazmat-like suit.
          15           When Mr. Pickett worked there it was a T-shirt and
          16 jeans.  Mr. Pickett sanded and sprayed and stayed in the
          17 carcinogens all day and then he wore them home with him at
          18 night.
          19           Let's talk about ventilation and a way to move
          20 that stuff out.  It's completely missing in the two
          21 facilities.  Other than a fan or a rudimentary thing, it's
          22 completely missing.
          23           Now, Mr. Wilner will more than likely get up and
          24 talk about numbers -- and talk about numbers and relative 25 risks in populations when I sit down. 105 And he'll compare the relative risk of lung cancer
           2 from smoking to the relative risk of lung cancer from
           3 occupational exposure.  But probabilities in populations do
           4 not prove specific causation in individuals.  And they can't
           5 prove what happened to Mr. Pickett, Sr.
           6           And this case isn't about populations.  It's not
           7 about playing the odds.  It's not about rolling the dice.
           8 It's about Mr. Pickett, Sr.
           9           And Dr. Brusick didn't resort to any gimmicks.  He
          10 was up front with you and he said, I cannot conclude whether
          11 occupational exposure or cigarette smoking caused his lung
          12 cancer.
          13           And why not?  He's tested toxicants and
          14 carcinogens for 40 years.  Why can't he?  Well, speaking in
          15 CSI language, there is no fingerprint.  There's no DNA test
          16 that can identify either smoking or occupational exposures
          17 as the cause.
          18           The plaintiff has the burden of proof.  And
          19 Dr. Brusick's testimony as a toxicologist tells you they not
          20 only didn't meet it, but they can't meet it.  It's a
          21 stubborn scientific fact that we just can't know which
          22 carcinogen caused it.
          23           At the end of the day Mr. Pickett's workplace 24 exposure was excessive enough for long enough that had he
          25 never chosen to smoke cigarettes he was still at an 106 increased risk for lung cancer.  This is scientific fact,
           2 not a gimmick.  And it comes from Dr. Brusick and from IARC.
           3           So I'm asking you on question number two, answer
           4 no.  And if you do, that's the end of the trial.  But if you
           5 conclude otherwise -- let me address the other issues.
           6           Questions three, four, five, and six get back to
           7 the bridge.  They require you to find that something that
           8 Reynolds did somehow affected Mr. Pickett's smoking
           9 decisions.
          10           And it isn't automatic.  You don't automatically
          11 build that bridge.  You have to prove it with evidence.  You
          12 have to link the two.
          13           I know there's a finding of negligence.  You have
          14 to link it with Mr. Pickett, Sr.  You have to show that
          15 something Reynolds did had the impact directly on him, not
          16 on others.
          17           And this is where the plaintiff has to build their
          18 bridge.  And they have to build it with proof and they have
          19 to build it with evidence, not conjecture, not speculation,
          20 not Ted Kluszewski.  And they simply did not do it here.
          21           We talked a little bit about legal cause.  Proving
          22 legal cause is a little bit about like the game of dominoes. 23 I don't know if you -- any of you have kids.  I know I've
          24 done it with my kids, where you line up the dominoes, one,
          25 one, one, one, one, one. 107 For legal cause the whole row of dominoes has to
           2 fall after you hit that first domino.  So you hit the first
           3 domino, which hits the second, which hits the third, which
           4 hits the fourth, which hits the fifth.  And it takes you all
           5 the way to the end of the line.
           6           But as you know, if you play dominoes or you do
           7 that, sometimes it doesn't go all the way down there.
           8 Sometimes something happens that stops the line of dominoes.
           9           And here the plaintiff has two problems with that
          10 line of dominoes.  First, go back to Dr. Cummings.  You
          11 can't rely on something that you don't see or hear.
          12           And in this case, because there is no -- and I
          13 mean zero evidence that Mr. Pickett heard or saw anything,
          14 much less relied on anything that Reynolds did -- that first
          15 domino, it doesn't even wiggle.  It doesn't wobble a bit.
          16 And it sure doesn't fall over.  And because of that there's
          17 no legal cause.
          18           Second, let's assume that the wind catches the
          19 first domino and it blows it over and it's going.  The whole
          20 row of dominoes will not blow over.  Why?  Because a few
          21 dominoes are missing. 22           What's in the middle of that chain of dominoes?
          23 Mr. Pickett, Sr.  He represents some of those dominoes.  And
          24 he made personal choices.  He could have made a personal
          25 choice to stop and stop the chain of dominoes. 108 Dr. Burns told you this.  He told you he was
           2 capable of making a plan to quit and capable of implementing
           3 it.  So if Mr. Pickett had wanted to and had made that plan
           4 to stop smoking in 1964 or 1969 or 1980, he could have and
           5 the chain of dominoes would have stopped.
           6           And if that whole chain doesn't fall there is no
           7 legal causation and your answer on each one of those
           8 questions should be no.
           9           Moving ahead in the verdict form, if you get to
          10 question seven, you'll already have decided that Mr. Pickett
          11 was addicted, that addiction causes lung cancer, it was
          12 smoking related, and that Reynolds' conduct was the legal
          13 cause of it.  And if you get that far, you'll have to
          14 allocate responsibility between Reynolds and Mr. Pickett,
          15 Sr.
          16           And I will tell you right now this case is not
          17 about blame.  You will never hear me blame Mr. Pickett, Sr.
          18 This case is about responsibility.  And the concepts are
          19 much different.
          20           You already heard from Mr. Wilner, not 21 Mr. Pickett, that they accept partial responsibility for
          22 Mr. Pickett, Sr.'s choices and his lung cancer.
          23           Well, I say that accepting partial responsibility
          24 is a gimmick.  He wants you to start with splitting faults.
          25 Let's just go in there and split the percentages.  Why? 109 Because it takes the focus off the burden of proof
           2 that they failed to meet.  It's an attempt to bargain away
           3 from their burden.  But what does it mean to accept
           4 responsibility?
           5           Have you ever said I accept partial responsibility
           6 for what I did today?  You're either in or you're out.  And
           7 accepting responsibility means that your own actions are a
           8 legal cause of your death.
           9           Otherwise, what are you accepting responsibility
          10 for?  Again, I come back to the words of C. Everett Koop,
          11 the Surgeon General, the gold standard, the truth.
          12 Ultimately you are the one who has control over your
          13 behavior.  Not 10 percent control, not 50 percent control,
          14 but 100 percent control.
          15           Nobody made Mr. Pickett, Sr.'s decisions for him.
          16 Nobody could decide for him to choose to smoke.  Nobody
          17 could choose for him to continue to smoke.  Nobody could
          18 choose for him to ignore the warnings in the media, in his
          19 family, in his friends, in his loved ones.  Not Ted 20 Kluszewski, not Fred Flintstone, not Gavin Pickett, and not
          21 Mr. Pickett, Jr.
          22           Only Pickett, Sr. could make those choices.  Not
          23 10 percent, not 50 percent, but 100 percent.  So if you get
          24 to that point on the verdict form, I ask you to give him 100
          25 percent of the responsibility that they have accepted, 110 because ultimately he was the one who had control of his
           2 behavior.
           3           Only Mr. Pickett, Sr. could have changed the
           4 course of the events of his life.  And he didn't.  And as
           5 someone who took responsibility for his actions, he should
           6 be held to that responsibility in this courtroom.
           7           Now, if you've found everything I've said to be
           8 unpersuasive and you decide to return a verdict for
           9 Mr. Pickett, you'll have to determine an amount of damages.
          10           And this is hard.  This is really hard.  You can't
          11 put a value on human life.  You can't put a value on missing
          12 a loved one.  We've all dealt with that situation.  We all
          13 feel compassion.  And we all wish him the best.  But
          14 compassion and good wishes are not reasons to exceed your
          15 common sense and good judgment.
          16           And I would suggest that the evidence in this
          17 case -- if you are not persuaded by what I've talked about
          18 so far, the evidence in this case suggests an award in the 19 thousands, not in the millions and not six million.
          20           If you make an award, compensate Mr. Pickett, not
          21 his lawyers, and compensate him based on the evidence you
          22 heard, the evidence that actually relates to Mr. Pickett,
          23 Sr.
          24           And, finally -- and this is really finally for me,
          25 because I don't get a chance to speak again.  If you get all 111 the way to the end of the verdict form you have to make the
           2 decision about punitive damages and whether they're
           3 warranted.
           4           And if we get that far, you will have already
           5 fully compensated Mr. Pickett for his father's death.  And
           6 punitive damages are not about compensation or making
           7 someone whole.  Punitive damages are simply about more
           8 money.
           9           Punitive damages are designed to deter and punish.
          10 And it's not intent.  It's punish for conduct tantamount to
          11 reckless disregard for human life.  And the plaintiff must
          12 meet a higher burden of proof for that.  It's called clear
          13 and convincing evidence.
          14           So does Reynolds -- or should Reynolds be
          15 punished?  First of all, you know, we called Dr. Gentry.
          16 And he was on the stand.  He's a vice president at Reynolds.
          17 He spent his career there working on cigarettes. 18           And this was Mr. Wilner's A Few Good Men moment,
          19 right?  There he is.  There's our guy.  There's our guy who
          20 designs cigarettes, R.J. Reynolds, sitting right there.
          21 Here's your chance.  Hit him with all those documents you
          22 talked to Dr. Cummings about, hit him with all the documents
          23 he's probably going to read to you when I sit down, hit him
          24 with it now, here's your moment, everybody's waiting.  How
          25 many documents did he show him?  One.  One from the company. 112 That's the time to walk up to the witness and
           2 man-up.  If you have questions for R.J. Reynolds, he's your
           3 guy.  Ask him.  Don't punt.  Don't ask him about one
           4 document, ask him about the other ones.  Let him put it in
           5 context.  That is your chance.
           6           But what did we hear from Dr. Gentry?  Dr. Gentry
           7 showed you what Reynolds did, how Reynolds manned-up in the
           8 '50s and the '60s and the '70s and '80s and the '90s,
           9 everything that they have tried to do, everything they've
          10 worked on on the science, on smoking and health, how they've
          11 worked with the public health community, how they've tried
          12 to address these issues, and he talked about them.
          13           And I want to look at just an overview.  The 1950s
          14 they start reviewing literature.  That's when it starts
          15 coming out.  Immediately they set up a research and
          16 development department.  They start to identify smoke 17 constituents.
          18           You heard about this from Dr. Gentry.  You heard
          19 how hard it is, how it was expensive, how they had to invent
          20 and build the machines to do it because the science didn't
          21 exist, so Reynolds came up with it.
          22           And not only that, but you heard that Reynolds
          23 alone has identified almost half of the constituents in
          24 smoking.
          25           In the 1960s they get information to the Surgeon 113 General that said, Work on biological research.  They're
           2 doing selective reduction.  They're doing general reduction.
           3 They're working with the NCI Tobacco Working Group.
           4           Now, I want to jump ahead.  And the other thing in
           5 the 1960s -- in 1968 we saw that letter from before, from
           6 the president to the head scientist.  What did it say?  Work
           7 with the government, work out a plan, try to find a safer
           8 cigarette.
           9           In the 1970s, they continued selective reduction,
          10 they continued general reduction, they continue with the NCI
          11 Working Group, they did more Ames testing.  And that's when
          12 they start working on the low-tar and medium-nicotine
          13 cigarettes.  And then they go to the 1980s.  They're still
          14 working on that.  They had a new in-house lab.  Why?
          15 Because they were working on the Premier and the Premier 16 monograph that you saw.
          17           And let's look quickly at, I think, slide 39.
          18           Dr. Gentry told you about Premier.  It may look
          19 like a cigarette.  But how much research went into trying to
          20 do this?  How much research?
          21           They worked on it for years to try to come up with
          22 something that they thought would be better from a public
          23 health standpoint for the public.
          24           And then in the 1990s they go to Eclipse.  Premier
          25 failed in the marketplace, so they work on Eclipse. 114 Can we go to Demonstrative 40, please?
           2           In the '90s they go to Eclipse.  And I want to
           3 talk about Eclipse briefly.  And then I'll go back to the
           4 tobacco-specific nitrosamines.
           5           But in Eclipse Dr. Gentry told you about the
           6 reductions in the compounds that they were able to
           7 accomplish with Eclipse.
           8           Can we look at those, please?
           9           Look at these reductions.  Across-the-board
          10 dramatic reductions, especially benzo(a)pyrene, NNN, and
          11 NNK, huge, huge reductions.
          12           And we talk about the tobacco-curing discovery.
          13 Well, people want to know, What about these tobacco-specific
          14 nitrosamines?  So Reynolds was working on it.  Reynolds was 15 studying it.
          16           And what did they do?  They figured out, Hey,
          17 there's a way to do this by the way that we do the heat
          18 exchange on the farms.  They didn't keep it secret.  They
          19 went and told the public.  And they converted all the barns
          20 for the farmers, provided it free for the farmers.
          21           Now, what are the results of this?  Dr. Gentry
          22 showed you.  Over the course of time what happened to
          23 Winston cigarettes?  Dramatic reductions in tar, dramatic
          24 reductions in nicotine.  Cancer-causing tar, much lower.
          25 Addicting nicotine, much lower. 115 And there was a suggestion that Reynolds kept its
           2 science secret.  But Dr. Gentry showed you -- or talked to
           3 you about dozens and dozens of patents.
           4           Mr. Wilner said Reynolds did not try to make it
           5 nonaddictive.  Dr. Gentry told you that Reynolds made
           6 cigarettes with no nicotine or very low levels of nicotine
           7 and offered them to the public.  That's trying.  That's
           8 responding to the public health community.  That's trying.
           9           Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a record of
          10 wanton conduct and disregard for human life.  This is a
          11 record of trying to lower the risk of an inherently risky
          12 but always lawful product.
          13           Mr. Wilner talked a little bit about finances and 14 costs.  You heard yesterday the government makes more money
          15 on a pack than Reynolds does, through taxes for the state
          16 and federal government.
          17           The government can take cigarettes off the market.
          18 We can't.  They are legal.  So that's not a question here,
          19 whether they're legal or not.  That's not an issue on the
          20 verdict form.
          21           And with regard to all these changes, Dr. Gentry
          22 showed you yesterday -- again, you had to wait for the whole
          23 story and the NCI Monograph 13, that for lung cancer, which
          24 this case is about, the National Cancer Institute said that
          25 these changes did result in lower lung-cancer risks. 116 Were there some successes?  Yes.  Were there some
           2 failures?  Yes.  But they tried.  And trying to lower the
           3 risks of an inherently risky but legal product should not be
           4 punished.
           5           Mr. Pickett, Sr. made choices throughout his life.
           6 He chose his lifestyle.  He chose his occupation.  And he
           7 made a choice to smoke.  And we should respect that choice
           8 to smoke.  And he made that choice to continue smoking.  He
           9 made it every day when he opened a pack and lit a cigarette.
          10           He made it for 29 years after the warning labels
          11 were on the side of the packs.  And he made a choice to
          12 continue to smoke in the face of news reports about the 13 risks and in the face of warnings from his friends and
          14 family that it would kill him.  We should respect that
          15 choice as well.
          16           Mr. Pickett, Sr. was not a victim.  Mr. Pickett,
          17 Sr. was not a prisoner, as Mr. Wilner said.  He lived his
          18 life the way he wanted.
          19           He did what he wanted when he wanted to.  Don't
          20 make him a victim in this lawsuit.  As I said, this is the
          21 only and last chance I get to speak with you, because the
          22 plaintiff has the burden of proof.  Mr. Wilner gets a
          23 rebuttal.
          24           I don't get a chance to respond to him.  So I
          25 would ask you, one of you, to be my advocate when you go 117 back in the jury room.  You've seen throughout this trial
           2 how I've tried to respond through witnesses or argument to
           3 show you the other half of the story.
           4           If there's something that's covered in the next
           5 half hour, I ask you to think, What was the evidence on it;
           6 what would the response be?  And answer him as you think I
           7 would.
           8           Ladies and gentlemen, it's been my great pleasure
           9 to try this case in front of you.  You have been incredibly
          10 attentive.  You have been on time.  You have paid attention
          11 and sat there and taken notes.  You've been a terrific jury. 12 From the bottom of my heart on behalf of myself, my team,
          13 and my client, thank you.
