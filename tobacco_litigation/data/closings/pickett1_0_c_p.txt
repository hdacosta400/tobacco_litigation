           7           MR. WILNER:  May it please the court? 8           This is -- this is the time that we have to spend
           9 with you.  And I -- I'm in cords here, so forgive me.
          10           I have an hour to address you now.  And after that
          11 counsel for R.J. Reynolds will have an hour and a half.  And
          12 then I'll have another half hour.
          13           If you see me trying to speak so fast that you
          14 can't understand, I'm trying to get in a lot to say, but
          15 I'll -- I promise to slow down.
          16           And I want to thank you, members of the jury --
          17 you know, we're in a United States District Court, which is
          18 a very powerful place to be.  And you are in a very powerful
          19 position right now.
          20           And it's not without, you know, taking you away
          21 from your lives and doing that -- we understand all that --
          22 and having to sit here and listen, but perhaps it's been
          23 interesting.  We hope it has.  You know, it's certainly
          24 important.  And I'm going to talk to you in a little bit of
          25 just how important.  28 But the thanks go first, heartfelt.
           2           This is a terrific place to be.  It's a unique
           3 place.  And to have the services in this great country of
           4 the people we have here to organize this courtroom -- and
           5 the judge is on the bench, to be here to conduct these
           6 proceedings -- I mean, when you think about it, it's 7 really -- it's almost overwhelming.
           8           Remember, we have three branches of government in
           9 this country.  And no one is more powerful than the other.
          10 We have the President and the executive.  People think
          11 that's very important.  And it is.  We have the Congress.
          12 They make the laws.  Very important.  We also have the
          13 courts.  And the courts are very unique.
          14           Because, unlike Congress, which we elect, the
          15 courts depend on people we select from the community.  And
          16 for the time that they are selected, they are as powerful as
          17 the Congress and as powerful as the President, really,
          18 because this is the U.S. District Court.  And it's a
          19 wonderful and a powerful place to be.
          20           Well, I started off -- what was it, two weeks --
          21 and I drew a line on this chart.  And I apologize for being
          22 a truly lousy artist.  I mean, one of the worst.  I really
          23 apologize for that, but that's me.
          24           And I drew a line.  I said this was an American
          25 tragedy of, like, unfathomable consequence.  And, yet -- and  29 it's the epidemic of lung cancer in the 20th century,
           2 starting from almost nothing.
           3           And I said, Why is it that though everybody has
           4 heard that smoking is bad -- I mean, and we've never said
           5 otherwise.  Let me just digress there. 6           Never came up here and said that people did not
           7 know that smoking was bad for them, and even caused cancer.
           8 That's -- there was no question -- luckily, that got
           9 through.  And I'm not arguing that it -- really, any -- we
          10 don't know exactly how much Mr. Pickett knew at one time or
          11 another.  But that's not really what I'm talking about.
          12           This is a tragedy.  And, yet -- although we know
          13 cigarettes are dangerous, we don't -- this is not really on
          14 people's minds.  It's really -- this has really not been as
          15 important as it is -- as it is to the people who died, and
          16 as it is to all of us.
          17           And so as I move on, I'm going to discuss what
          18 could -- what should have happened here, and why Reynolds is
          19 responsible.  And when I say responsible, I mean, it's --
          20 I'm not saying that Reynolds did -- alone did everything,
          21 and I'm not trying to get out of any responsibility that
          22 Mr. Pickett had for smoking, because we know you shouldn't
          23 smoke.
          24           Having said that, I'm here to tell you that
          25 Reynolds played a substantial role in this acceleration in  30 this epidemic because it didn't come from nothing, it didn't
           2 come from the air, it didn't even come -- to make a joke --
           3 from a paint puff.  It came from one thing alone.  And that
           4 was cigarettes. 5           So how did this case start?  It's very -- it
           6 really is fascinating, what we heard.  And, you know, we
           7 heard from a lot of witnesses.
           8           And I want to jump forward and say -- we have
           9 tried -- tried, tried, and tried to bring you the best that
          10 there was.
          11           And we brought you Dr. Cummings, who wrote -- who
          12 has been a public health official, a public health
          13 professional for years, and has played a role in writing the
          14 Surgeon General reports.  That is nationally --
          15 internationally important.  That's how important.  That's
          16 how important we think this case is.
          17           That's -- we brought you Dr. Cummings.  We brought
          18 you Dr. Burns, who is a medical doctor, who is a senior
          19 editor of many of these Surgeon General reports.
          20           And we brought you, also, kind of the gold
          21 standard, the cream of the crop -- oops -- cream of the
          22 crop, and we brought you the reports themselves.  And
          23 they're actually going to be in evidence for you to read.
          24           So you say, Well, Mr. Wilner, we don't have time
          25 to read that.  And I know that.  But you'll recognize -- and  31 I'll point out some passages that we did read, that we are
           2 ready to go, and there's more -- and let me tell you, first,
           3 in -- we stand behind everything in there, warts and all. 4           I mean, who knows?  You might find a word in there
           5 and say, Oh, Mr. Wilner didn't tell us that.  Well, sure.
           6 And I -- here's another thing.
           7           I'm -- we are not trying this case on one tiny
           8 detail or another.  I mean, there may be a hundred details.
           9 Perhaps counsel for Reynolds will pull out one thing or pull
          10 out another and say, See, see that, see that word -- we're
          11 not.
          12           We are trying to try this case on the -- on the
          13 big picture, the historical magnitude of what happened here,
          14 and as it affected Mr. Pickett.
          15           But this is -- this is the sum of all things.
          16 This is -- this is all these reports.  These are all these
          17 data.  And they're all consistent.  I mean, somebody's right
          18 here and somebody's wrong.
          19           We stand behind the public health officials and
          20 the public health professionals of this country and
          21 internationally.  That's -- we take our stand there.
          22           I mean, they were here in person.  And the books,
          23 which have never been -- never been criticized -- I mean,
          24 they are -- they represent the finest scientific thought.
          25 And we're here to tell you that's our -- that's us.  That is  32 us.
           2           If you don't like it -- I don't mean you.  But if 3 someone doesn't like it, that's fine.  Then maybe they're
           4 not with us.  We can't make everybody with us, but -- but
           5 this is what we stand behind.
           6           And when you go back to deliberate, you will
           7 actually have all this evidence here.  We like to call it
           8 evidence here, documentary evidence.
           9           And the Surgeon General reports are important.
          10 And I'm going to point out a couple of things to read.
          11 You'll also have a bunch of other stuff, including many, but
          12 by no means all, of the actual formerly secret documents
          13 that went into many of these Surgeon General reports after
          14 2000 when they became available.
          15           So you'll be able to read those and look at them
          16 and say -- and you'll start reading them and you'll go,
          17 Well, it's long, technical, difficult -- we can't do
          18 anything about that.  The documents are what they are.
          19           They were -- they were exposed not too long ago.
          20 In exposing these documents -- and in this trial, my -- my
          21 contention is here, we -- we've exposed Reynolds for what it
          22 is.  We've exposed them.
          23           I mean -- and Dr. Gentry came on from Reynolds
          24 and -- incredibly, he -- he was kind of dismissive.  And he
          25 said, Well, the Surgeon General reports, they -- oh, our  33 leadership team, they -- oh, I never really made a 2 presentation.
           3           Reynolds, huge cigarette company, making four --
           4 four billion packages a year that they know are going to
           5 kill one-third of the people -- here is the latest
           6 scientific work on why and how it kills, through addiction,
           7 the combination of addiction and carcinogens multiplied
           8 together.  Here it is.
           9           And he says, Well, we don't really follow that.
          10 We just -- we don't quite -- we're not in the public health
          11 community.
          12           What they are in, of course, is -- is, as belied
          13 by their -- by the documents we have unearthed from the '50s
          14 and '60s, is that their scientists in their labs did figure
          15 out the key to addiction, and were able to design their
          16 cigarette.
          17           Why did they do it?  And another principle we
          18 stand behind, as well as public health, follow the money.
          19 There's one thing a corporation does, it does it for profit.
          20           It was absolutely in their best interest to try
          21 and make a cigarette that did not cause cancer.  We agree,
          22 as long as they could keep people buying them.
          23           So when Dr. Gentry got up here and said, We tried,
          24 we took this out, I agree, fine, I'm not blaming him for
          25 that.  34
           VIII 1           But, see, the one thing that they could never
           2 address, because it's the end of their business -- not the
           3 end -- it's the end of the size of their business maybe --
           4 is addiction.  They could never address addiction, because
           5 once -- once you turn it off -- and to quote from
           6 Claude Teague in the famous document that you will read from
           7 1982, the Nordine study, if the exit gate from our market
           8 were ever opened, then we'd be out of business almost
           9 overnight.
          10           The exit gate, the cure for addiction -- the cure
          11 for addiction.  If you lift the gate -- what a metaphor.
          12 Their users are inside the gate.  They're in prison.
          13 They're in prison.
          14           And Claude Teague is saying, We're in a rough
          15 place, Reynolds.  Because if somebody finds a cure and let's
          16 them out of prison, what's going to happen to our sales?
          17           This is the core of what I'm trying to say this
          18 whole trial.  We follow the money.  The money has driven the
          19 sale -- sorry, the sales have driven the money.  The
          20 addiction has driven the sales.  The addiction has driven
          21 the death.  It's a tight circle.
          22           And it is the tragedy of the 20th century.  And
          23 I'm going to -- I'm up here telling you -- I'm up here
          24 saying, that the way to stop this -- and I'm going to ask
          25 you -- we're going to talk about that, the way to stop  35
           VIII 1 this -- it appears to be true, according to Dr. Gentry, that
           2 they're not going to stop.
           3           It appears to be true that they are not even
           4 addressing the addiction, except to make sure that their
           5 cigarettes are addicting.
           6           It appears to be true that they have no -- they
           7 have no interest in listening to the -- to the science, the
           8 modern science of addiction.
           9           It appears to be true that what they want to do is
          10 stay in the old science where addiction was thought to be
          11 just a matter of willpower.  It just was, Just quit.
          12           And, see, they like that, because then they can
          13 just tell their customers, Well, if you don't quit, I'm
          14 sorry.  Well, you didn't quit, your fault.
          15           We engineered it, we did it to you, we know about
          16 it, we designed a product in a way -- and if you read the
          17 Surgeon General report it says it, it says it from the
          18 Surgeon General.  It says their design of the product has
          19 increased addiction.
          20           So Reynolds would love to be back in the old days
          21 when addiction was not understood.  Yes, there were
          22 newspaper articles from -- or something from 1900 that said
          23 addiction.  But that's not science.  That's just popular
          24 use.
          25           And there was -- people did use a word sometimes  36 VIII
           1 to mean habit.  And who knows what people say.  But
           2 science -- science, the science was up until recently -- and
           3 I'm going to give you the document trail, where it was --
           4 where they did the work over in -- in England and they
           5 passed it down, came over here.
           6           It said -- it was technical work but it meant
           7 cigarettes were not just addictive, they were physically
           8 addictive.  Didn't give it to the Surgeon General.  The
           9 Surgeon General writes in '64, you'll have this, It's a
          10 habit.  Why is it a habit?  It's mental.  They called it
          11 psychic, if you remember.  Mental.  Not physical.
          12           Well, that's wrong.  And I said, I'll stand by the
          13 Surgeon General.  Yeah, they got it right later.  But they
          14 didn't know about that.  Reynolds had that information.
          15 Didn't turn it over.  Okay.
          16           They want to stay there.  They will give us --
          17 they will tell us, Oh, addiction -- oh, yes, it's addictive.
          18 But, really, what they want to say is, Anybody can quit, so
          19 don't really bother us about it.  We sell it.  We're like
          20 the -- you know, the cruise ship that just turned over, you
          21 know, in the dark of night in the cold water.  People fell
          22 out, jumped out.  Some swam for it and made it, some swam
          23 for it and couldn't make it.  Some couldn't swim.
          24           Reynolds is the cruise ship that just threw
          25 everybody in the water.  And they want to say, oh, you   37 couldn't quit?  Well, tough luck, you died, wasn't our
           2 fault.  Wait a minute.  What put them in the water?  How did
           3 they get there?
           4           They got there because you sold them a product
           5 that you knew would addict them, and then you went and said,
           6 Uh, you didn't try; you didn't try enough; why didn't you
           7 swim harder?  Why didn't you swim -- I know -- maybe you
           8 couldn't see where you were swimming, maybe you didn't know
           9 which way -- oh, that's your fault.  You should have swam
          10 harder.  You should have known what direction to swim.
          11           And, you know, the tragedy is if you are a
          12 powerful man, like Mr. Pickett was, powerful man, started
          13 his own business, came up from very little, had -- had the
          14 greatest kid in the world, you know -- greatest kid in the
          15 world, Oliver Pickett, Jr., the greatest daughter in the
          16 world, Cindy Voss, never had an obstacle, according to what
          17 we heard, never had an obstacle that this guy couldn't
          18 handle.  He was a tough guy.  He was a good guy.  He was
          19 kind but he was tough.
          20           He was -- this -- he could do -- his force of
          21 will -- and you know Reynolds even wants to say that, they
          22 wanted to pump it up, oh -- I agree.  One thing I agree
          23 with, wonderful man, cut down, 52.  At 20 -- you'll have the
          24 mortality tables to look at, 27 years of life yet to go, 25 according to the mortality table, 27.  That's a lot.  And 27  38 to the best friend in the world, you know, that's a lot.
           2 That's a lot.
           3           Anyway, here was a tough guy.  And we're going to
           4 hear -- and we'll discuss it to some degree.  You've heard
           5 it.  And, you know, I'm not going to be able to recite all
           6 the testimony.  It's been two weeks.  But did he try to
           7 quit?  Oh, absolutely.
           8           Does everyone remember every day that he tried to
           9 quit?  Of course not.  Were there times when probably using
          10 our normal judgment of how people act, he was so sick of
          11 being -- of being controlled on something that he couldn't
          12 beat, humiliated -- every time -- if he had to tell somebody
          13 I tried to quit again and I failed, I tried to quit this
          14 morning and I smoked by the afternoon.  I tried to quit --
          15 last night I said I wouldn't do it and this morning I smoked
          16 again -- how horrible you feel if you are a person who is
          17 used to doing what you've set your mind to do.  How
          18 humiliating.
          19           It's like you're a great swimmer and you're in the
          20 water and you don't know where to go, you're thrown off the
          21 cruise ship and nobody said there's land and you hate -- you
          22 hate to admit it.  And, worse, the people around you are
          23 hating you for ruining your health.  They're hating you. 24 They're frustrated.
          25           And we need to understand how -- how this works.  39 And, you know, there was a time -- there was a time in the
           2 old days -- the old days, where alcohol, for example, as an
           3 addiction -- and it is a terrible addiction, doesn't affect
           4 everyone who drinks by any means, but it's a terrible
           5 addiction for the people who are addicted.
           6           And we used to want to just kill these people,
           7 stop drinking, stop drinking.  You know, there's something
           8 wrong with you, you're not trying hard enough, you -- just
           9 stop it.
          10           And over time -- and that's not to say that we
          11 don't still do that, but over time we've begun to realize
          12 that, wait a minute, you're dealing with something inside
          13 the person.
          14           Many of these people who are addicted to alcohol
          15 fight this all their lives, not because they're bad people
          16 or because they're not trying but because there's something
          17 in their genes or something that has caused them to be that
          18 way and they hate it, they hate themselves for being that
          19 way.  And it takes -- it's a struggle.
          20           Many of them keep going in for counseling and a
          21 certain drug that might help and so forth and out and in and
          22 out and in and some beat it, some don't. 23           That's alcohol.  Not saying it's exactly the same.
          24 I'm not -- I'm not trying to push this -- push one, you
          25 know, simile too far.  I'm just saying it's our attitude  40 towards addiction.
           2           And, unfortunately, in the nicotine context --
           3 probably because when you smoke you don't fall over -- well,
           4 yeah, you know, you do one day but you don't fall over that
           5 day, you could smoke most of your life until you get a
           6 horrible, horrible cough or a horrible visit to an
           7 oncologist who says, sorry, there's nothing you can do.
           8           I mean, that's -- at least with alcohol you kind
           9 of know, you know, you're falling over, you can't drive, you
          10 lose your job.  Not with tobacco.  With cigarettes it's
          11 insidious, because you can be smoking and you know -- you're
          12 like in a car going over the side of a cliff, I want to
          13 stop, but you -- but you can still keep working.
          14           So you say one more cigarette I'll just feel
          15 better, you know, I'll feel better.  If I can just have one
          16 more, then I'll try to quit.  Is it human weakness?  Yes.
          17 Are we all affected?  Perhaps.  Are some people able to quit
          18 and others can't?  Yes.
          19           Claude Teague says many but not most are able to
          20 quit.  We agree with that.  1982, Reynolds.  Many, but not
          21 most are able -- said most would like to.  Many but not most 22 are able.
          23           They admitted that in a document they never
          24 thought we would see.  And they're right.  And that is the
          25 modern science.  If we look at the modern science, that's  41 the modern science.
           2           It's not a character weakness.  It's not something
           3 that you just can try harder.  How do you get over it?
           4           Well, we talked earlier when Dr. Cummings was on
           5 about different drugs, about a Nicorette patch, about gum --
           6 sorry, Nicorette gum, a patch.
           7           How is it that all of that came out -- came about
           8 relatively late, like the late '80s, some of it in the '90s,
           9 some of it Mr. Pickett never saw?
          10           Reynolds has stayed in the age before the modern
          11 treatment of addiction.  It wants to blame Mr. Pickett for
          12 not getting out of the water and being able to swim to
          13 shore.
          14           And, you know what, we're happy -- I'll show you
          15 on the verdict form, if you blame Mr. Pickett, also, for
          16 being a kid who experimented to his death with cigarettes.
          17 They also want to blame him for that as a 13-year-old kid.
          18 And they want to say, Oh, look, the American Cancer Society
          19 told him not to smoke, and, you know what, we're not -- we
          20 don't disagree with that.  There was plenty of stuff out 21 there.
          22           It wasn't all perfectly as clear as Ms. Hoffman
          23 said it was, but, sure, we all heard it, of one kind or
          24 another, in one ear we heard it.
          25           What did we hear in the other ear that she did not  42 want to talk about?  250 billion dollars worth of -- you
           2 should smoke.  It's the -- that your heroes smoked.  The
           3 baseball players smoked.  The boxers smoked.  The people on
           4 the street that you see smoked.  The cool guys smoked in the
           5 movies.
           6           It's so obvious in presenting to the young mind
           7 when they get out of school -- okay.  They've heard lots of
           8 things at school.  And, again, I'm not trying to get out of
           9 it.  Blame him some if you want.  But let's look at the
          10 whole picture.
          11           So he's in school and he listens to the teacher
          12 and the teacher says eat your vegetables and don't smoke.
          13 Fine.  He goes home.  What's he see?  Nothing but television
          14 ads for smoking.
          15           Now, how -- how are you supposed to reconcile that
          16 as a -- as a 12-year-old?  How does that even make any sense
          17 to you?  Your teacher says, don't smoke, eat your
          18 vegetables, fine, but then Ted Kluszewski, the strongest
          19 baseball player in the country, yeah, I like them, I love 20 them.  What are you supposed to think as a 12-year-old?  You
          21 think, well, if they're good enough for him, look at what he
          22 can do.
          23           Yeah, I'll eat my vegetables.  Yeah, I'm just
          24 going to try them.  And you know, the funny thing is, they
          25 try it.  It's cool.  It's a cool thing.  And you know they  43 get hooked.  And no one knows which -- how many will get
           2 hooked.  But a lot.  And some of them will struggle for
           3 their whole lives and many will die.  That's -- that's what
           4 it is.  That's the reality of it.
           5           And the promotion to the youth is a pediatric
           6 disease and it's Reynolds' fault for doing it.  It's all
           7 their fault.  That's 100 percent their fault.  They had no
           8 business marketing and they -- to youth.  And most of their
           9 markets is to youth.  Why?  Because adults don't start to
          10 smoke.  If they haven't started by your late -- by your
          11 mid -- late teens or early 20s, you're just not -- they just
          12 don't even care, just so few people start.
          13           You start early.  It's a pediatric disease.  And
          14 there's another Surgeon General report that came out a week
          15 and a half ago.
          16           It's the 2012 Surgeon General report and it is
          17 marked as Exhibit 1302.  And it is all about how the tobacco
          18 companies got to the youth, children, teenagers, and how 19 they designed their product and their marketing to get to
          20 kids, started.
          21           And when they started, they would make them into
          22 valuable assets, lifelong smokers who bought a pack a day
          23 driven by their addiction until they die.
          24           Well, I digressed for about a half an hour before
          25 I even started with what I wanted to tell you.  But I'll go  44 back.
           2           I'm right about a half an hour, right?  It's a
           3 good time for a two-second pause.
           4           Okay.  Let's -- having said what I was going to
           5 try and say, I'll try to -- try to discuss what it is you'll
           6 be asked to do.  And then we'll go from there.
           7           So at the -- as soon as these closing remarks are
           8 done, His Honor will address you with instructions.  And the
           9 instructions will give you the law.  And anything I say
          10 about what I feel the instructions will be or how to
          11 understand them, that's me, but His Honor is the law in this
          12 courtroom.
          13           And anything I say that is -- that is incorrect,
          14 it would be a mistake.  I wouldn't try to do it, but
          15 absolutely it is -- it is -- His Honor's instructions are
          16 your binding instructions.
          17           So before I tell you -- we discuss these 18 instructions, I'll go back one step.  And that is here.
          19 This case started a long time ago.
          20           And there's testimony about it from Oliver
          21 Pickett, Jr., Tadpole Pickett.  And he said that his father
          22 had gone -- had been diagnosed with lung cancer in 1996.
          23 And he came -- came into my office.  This was a long time
          24 ago.
          25           And according to his son he said, I feel like  45 they've added something to cigarettes that made me smoke
           2 them, to keep me smoking them.  I feel they've added
           3 something.
           4           Here was a man -- a strong man who was unable, to
           5 the humiliation and the consternation of everyone around
           6 him -- many people didn't smoke, including his son and his
           7 brother Gavin.
           8           And, incidentally, his brother Gavin challenged
           9 anything these witnesses said.  I mean, this is warts and
          10 all.
          11           If we had scripted anything, we would have
          12 scripted it different, I mean Gavin said, Oh, I don't even
          13 think he tried, you know, tried to quit.
          14           I mean, if we had scripted it, we would have said,
          15 Oh, he tried in the morning, tried in the afternoon.  That's
          16 how warts -- that's true testimony.  And it teaches us to 17 learn, because you could see Gavin crying inside for how
          18 much he was frustrated with his brother, because his brother
          19 at that time certainly was knowing this was a horrible thing
          20 that he was into, and the one thing in his life that he had
          21 not been able to break.  That was the digression.
          22           So let's go to -- you will be given -- or you will
          23 be addressed by His Honor and given instructions.  Some of
          24 these instructions are in what we call legalese, which means
          25 they're hard to understand, and others are very clear.  And  46 we'll do the best we can.
           2           And then I want to put up the verdict form, which
           3 is what you will be asked to sign, asked to agree on.  You
           4 have to all agree and sign.  So I would like to go through
           5 with it -- go through this.  And maybe we can put it up.
           6           MR. LANTINBERG:  We've got it up.  I have it.
           7           MR. WILNER:  It's up?  Oh, well, I'm glad somebody
           8 is faster than I am.
           9           So this -- this says:  Do you find -- this is the
          10 first question:  Do you find from a preponderance of the
          11 evidence that Mr. Pickett, Sr. was addicted to cigarettes
          12 containing nicotine; yes or no?
          13           Reynolds has put up no witness at all to contrast
          14 that.  There's been nobody here who said that this is not a
          15 pattern of addiction. 16           And if the argument is, Well, you couldn't quit,
          17 that has nothing to do with it.  Addicted people quit and
          18 addicted people don't quit.  It has nothing to do with it.
          19           Once you throw them in the water, you can't then
          20 go back and say, Oh, yeah, I threw you in the water, but you
          21 should have swam harder.  Well, he swam pretty darn hard.
          22           A preponderance of the evidence, what does that
          23 mean?  It just means that you have to have more evidence on
          24 one side than the other.  It doesn't mean absolute proof.
          25           It's like the guy for the body shop said, We can't  47 find the molecule.  That's not what the law requires.
           2 It's -- it's reasonable -- it's preponderance, meaning
           3 what's more likely than not.  So this is a no-brainer, we
           4 feel, because there has been nobody to come in who said
           5 otherwise.
           6           Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence
           7 that Mr. Pickett's addiction to cigarettes containing
           8 nicotine was a legal cause of his lung cancer and death?
           9           Well, I mean, sure.  What else?  Mr. Pickett's own
          10 body?  Yes.  How is it not?  I think Reynolds will say, Oh,
          11 well, it wasn't the addiction; it was Mr. Pickett smoking.
          12 Well, okay.  Why did he smoke?  Well, he smoked for a lot of
          13 reasons, maybe.  Maybe he liked the image at first.
          14           But if anyone thinks that Mr. Pickett was not 15 addicted and driven to smoke day by day, then no one in the
          16 world is addicted, because this was the most classic pattern
          17 in the world.  So the answer seems to be pretty clear yes.
          18           Next, if you -- oops.
          19           MR. LANTINBERG:  I'm sorry.
          20           MR. WILNER:  If you answered yes to this question,
          21 proceed to question three.  Now, here's where it gets
          22 interesting.
          23           If you answered yes to those first two questions,
          24 Mr. Pickett then joins what's called the Engle class.
          25           Now, one of the things that we're here -- well,  48 one of the interesting things about being here is we don't
           2 have to -- or you do not have to decide in and of itself
           3 whether cigarettes, including Winston, are defective.
           4           You don't have to decide whether Reynolds was
           5 negligent.  Why?  Because that has been decided in a class
           6 that was tried earlier.
           7           Remember I said Mr. Pickett came in in 1996 and
           8 said, you know, Something's in these cigarettes, well, it's
           9 taken to now to get this class through the courts.  That's
          10 just the way it is.
          11           And if you answer yes, the classes of all people
          12 in Florida who have died or been -- been injured by
          13 addiction to cigarettes -- so if that's the case -- and this 14 is the clearest case, I'd submit to you, imaginable that
          15 this is the case of addiction -- then he is now part of this
          16 class, he is brought into the class.
          17           Once he's brought into the class, then what the
          18 class decided -- what the jury and the class decided is then
          19 binding, and that includes cigarettes are defective, the
          20 companies, including Reynolds, were negligent, and they
          21 conspired to conceal the truth.
          22           And His Honor will read these to you.  They're
          23 binding.  Some of you're thinking, Well, how do I find
          24 cigarettes are defective?  It's already been done.  It's
          25 part of this class.  Once he's in the class, he gets the  49 benefit of these findings.
           2           So you say to me, Well, Mr. Wilner, why did you
           3 put on all this evidence if it's already been done?  That's
           4 a good question.  And you'll see when we get further on the
           5 verdict why I did it.
           6           So let's go a little further.  Do you find from a
           7 preponderance of the evidence that negligence on the part of
           8 the defendant was a legal cause?  Well, you'll be asked to
           9 assume that there was negligence, because that's part of the
          10 class finding.  And whether it's on the part -- whether it
          11 was a legal cause.
          12           So you'll be asked what -- you'll have to refer to 13 the instructions to define legal cause.  Okay?  So what is a
          14 legal cause?
          15           Well, His Honor will tell you, if I get it
          16 straight here, that a legal cause -- in order to prove that
          17 addiction to smoking cigarettes containing nicotine was a
          18 legal cause of the decedent's death or in order to prove
          19 that negligence was the legal cause, using the word legal
          20 cause as a term, the plaintiff must prove that such
          21 addiction or such negligence directly and in natural
          22 continuous sequence produced or contributed substantially to
          23 producing such death, so it can be reasonably said that but
          24 for the addiction the death would not have occurred, or in
          25 the case of negligence -- but for the negligence, the death  50 would not have occurred.  In order to be regarded as a legal
           2 cause of death, addiction, or negligence, need not be the
           3 only cause.
           4           So the key to legal cause is that there are always
           5 other causes.  They all can combine.  All this is is a
           6 statement that it need not be the only cause.
           7           Addiction -- or we've actually gone on to the next
           8 instruction about the negligence -- may be a legal cause of
           9 death even though it operates in combination with the act of
          10 another, some natural cause, or some other cause, if the
          11 addiction contributes substantially to producing the death, 12 or if the negligence contributes substantially.
          13           First you'll be asked about addiction being a
          14 legal cause and then negligence being a legal cause.  So if
          15 the negligence contributes substantially, then it's a legal
          16 cause.
          17           Sorry for the legalese, but legal cause is defined
          18 by these instructions as a substantial factor.  Not the only
          19 factor, just a substantial factor.
          20           Okay.  Let's go back to the verdict.
          21           So how about -- so number three:  Was their
          22 negligence a substantial factor?  Well, their negligence
          23 was.  And we've talked about it and talked about it.
          24           First it was getting the children to smoke.  Then
          25 it was designing the product to be addictive and keeping  51 people addicted.
           2           And many of these side things we've talked about,
           3 including the infiltration of the AMA and not -- not giving
           4 straight answers to the public health community, hiding
           5 things from the Surgeon General, that's all part of that
           6 negligence, all combining -- not one thing in particular,
           7 all combining.
           8           Number four:  Do you find from a preponderance of
           9 the evidence that the defendant's placement of cigarettes on
          10 the market that were defective -- the way that's phrased is 11 you are to assume that those cigarettes were defective.
          12 So -- oops.  Is that the right one?
          13           MR. LANTINBERG:  It's from the jury instructions.
          14           MR. WILNER:  Well, go ahead and put the verdict
          15 back on.
          16           Okay.  Do you find from a preponderance of the
          17 evidence that the defendant's placement of cigarettes on the
          18 market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous was a
          19 legal cause of the death?
          20           Well, this seems to be pretty much a given if you
          21 answered the first part, that addiction to cigarettes
          22 containing nicotine was a legal cause of the death, which
          23 seems obvious.
          24           So if -- if you answered that and you're given
          25 that the cigarettes were defective, then the only  52 question -- then there is no more question.  It really has
           2 dissolved into the same question.
           3           Why are we here?  Because there are a lot of
           4 formalities in court.  And we'd suggest to you there isn't
           5 any other way to understand it.  That is just:  Do you find
           6 that the -- that the placement of the cigarettes on the
           7 market -- well, yeah.
           8           I mean, without the cigarettes on the market, you
           9 don't have the -- the addiction, you don't have the disease, 10 and you don't have the death.
          11           So, sure, once -- once you've found that this is
          12 part of a class, then this -- then question number four is
          13 automatic, we suggest.  There is no really other way to --
          14 all right.  No other way to understand it.
          15           Number five -- and I won't go over this in too
          16 much detail.  This is whether concealment or omission of
          17 material information concerning the health effects or the
          18 addictive nature -- you can decide that for yourself,
          19 whether knowledge of whether it's really physically
          20 addictive would have really saved him.  That's something you
          21 can decide.
          22           I mean, number four is a given.  Number five, you
          23 know, I think it's pretty clear, but you can discuss it.
          24           Number six:  Do you find a preponderance of the
          25 evidence -- from a preponderance that he relied to his  53 detriment on an act taken in further of the agreement to
           2 conceal or omit concerning health effects or addictive
           3 nature of cigarettes?
           4           Well, we haven't talked a whole lot about it.
           5 You'll see from the documents and from reading the Surgeon
           6 General's report that there was a concerted effort here to
           7 keep this information.
           8           We're not arguing ignorance of cancer.  I'm never 9 going to do that, because everyone here knows that
          10 cigarettes cause cancer.
          11           As to whether the knowledge that addiction was a
          12 serious brain disease that could be treated medically,
          13 maybe, but at least you'd have to try, that you shouldn't be
          14 just blaming yourself all the time and getting frustrated,
          15 whether that would have made a difference -- we suggest it
          16 would.
          17           Based -- now, this -- this is -- is another
          18 interesting part.  Now, assuming that you answer those --
          19 one of those questions yes -- and I would suggest number
          20 four really doesn't have any other answer -- based on a
          21 preponderance of the evidence -- what percentage of fault
          22 was a legal cause of death of Oliver Pickett do you allocate
          23 to each of the parties?  And these have to add up to 100
          24 percent.  And here -- the first thing I said is no one is
          25 blameless.  And Oliver Pickett isn't either.  54 And if he should have done something else, if he
           2 should have been able to quit and couldn't, if he shouldn't
           3 have started smoking, because some of us didn't, you know,
           4 we didn't happen to have those inputs, whatever -- but
           5 whatever you think he did wrong, you put a percentage there.
           6 We'll live with it.
           7           I would suggest the percentage is no greater than 8 20 percent.  But if you feel it is, that's where you put it.
           9 If you want to blame Oliver Pickett for his death, that's
          10 where you put the percentage.  That's all I can tell you.
          11           You have to compare it with what Reynolds did.
          12 And what Reynolds did was a lot.  It was a lot.  It was --
          13 it was premeditated lots.
          14           So you put that percentage.  And don't be
          15 confused.  If you really go in there and you really are
          16 thinking this is -- Oliver Pickett has to be responsible,
          17 then this is where you put it.
          18           Next.  This is the -- based on the preponderance
          19 of the evidence, what amount of damages do you find, if any,
          20 with respect to the following elements?
          21           Next.  Oliver Pickett's loss of companionship,
          22 protection, and his mental pain and suffering as a result of
          23 his father -- that is -- we would say that's 27 years of
          24 losing your best friend, 240,000 hours.  It's a serious
          25 thing.  55 How much?  You know what, there's no way to tell
           2 you that.  You use your humanity, use your experience, use
           3 your judgment.  It's 27 years lost, and watching a horrible,
           4 horrible event of the strongest man dying a horrible death.
           5 So put a price on it.  We would say not more than
           6 $6 million.  Anything more might be excessive.  But I'm 7 serious about that.
           8           Next, Cindy Lee Voss -- I'm sorry, Cindy Lee Voss'
           9 loss of companionship -- the daughter, Cindy Lee.  She's
          10 been here.  She testified.  They tried to make it seem like
          11 she didn't know her father very well.  Okay.
          12           I don't need to discuss it.  This is humanity.
          13 And it's -- and whatever's right, do what's right, that's
          14 all.  Don't do too much.  Don't do not enough.  Do what's
          15 right.
          16           But number nine is really the one I wanted to talk
          17 about for about three minutes here, because this -- this
          18 case is two cases.  One is the one above.  It's Mr. Pickett.
          19 It's Tadpole Pickett.  It's Cindy Lee Voss.  It's their
          20 personal story.  And it's a tragedy.  That's the first case.
          21           Question number nine is the second case.  In that
          22 question you are empowered to tell the world -- more than
          23 that, tell Reynolds' management why -- if you feel that this
          24 is not the right conduct for an American corporation to be
          25 doing what it did for these number of years, this is how you  56 answer that question, because what we've tried to do is
           2 we've tried to bring to you the resources of the public
           3 health community.
           4           We've tried to deputize you for a short time to be
           5 agents of the public health community, to test your 6 knowledge.  You now know more about the history of this.
           7 You now know more about what happened than almost any group
           8 of people, because you have been to graduate school and
           9 postgraduate school on the history -- the horrible history
          10 that led up to the greatest epidemic that we've seen.
          11           Now, the Surgeon General cannot award damages
          12 against Reynolds.  That doesn't exist.  So the Surgeon
          13 General of the United States, public health service, is part
          14 of the executive branch.
          15           They don't have the power to actually go to
          16 Reynolds and have something come into their leadership
          17 meeting -- the next meeting that says, Wait a minute, we
          18 can't have business as usual anymore, can't do it.
          19           That power rests with you.  Isn't that odd how
          20 that -- maybe that's really a wonderful thing.  The power
          21 comes from the U.S. District Court to you.  The power comes
          22 from you having seen and having access to the real story.
          23 And this is the real story.
          24           The power doesn't come to people who haven't been
          25 in that situation, people off the street who don't know what  57 really happened.  They may have lots of opinions.  Who
           2 knows?  Who cares?
           3           And maybe you had opinions before you walked in.
           4 But this is different.  This isn't about an idle opinion. 5 This is for real.  This stuff is life and death.  And
           6 although I've joked about my dog-eared copies of stuff,
           7 it -- it's life and death to people.  The word to get out is
           8 critical.  And in number nine you have a chance to get the
           9 word out.  You can send Reynolds a message.
          10           Now, what happens if you say yes?  If you say yes,
          11 then in -- we have a brief -- we have a pause in these
          12 proceedings and we, at a -- at a soon -- immediately after,
          13 we address the amount.
          14           You don't actually have to put an amount.  You
          15 just put a yes or a no.  And you'll be given the instruction
          16 that determines whether you should give punitive damages --
          17 award punitive damages.  And His Honor will give it to you.
          18 I'm not going to try to repeat it.
          19           My boiling this down is this, did Reynolds do --
          20 in designing this cigarette to be addictive, in barraging
          21 the young people in this country with image after image
          22 telling them to smoke, in not being straight with the
          23 Surgeon General, not giving the Surgeon General all of their
          24 research and perpetuated old science about addiction, did
          25 Reynolds do that by accident?  58 And, if so, you would fill the top part of the
           2 verdict form -- we expect you would award damages to
           3 Mr. Pickett.  But if it's by accident, it's not punitive. 4           But -- it's a big but -- if this was done
           5 intentionally -- if it was intentional, then that has to be
           6 yes.  And that is my -- that's my boiling down of what
           7 you'll hear.  If it was something that Reynolds did for
           8 profit, then we would say it's only one answer.
           9           After your -- after question nine you sign and
          10 date your verdict.  And, you know, we go on about our
          11 business, and you do.
          12           Oliver Tadpole Pickett and Cindy Voss, they can't
          13 come back.  This is -- this is it for them.  Reynolds will
          14 have a meeting.  They will have a meeting.  They will have a
          15 meeting.  The next leadership counsel that Dr. Gentry is on,
          16 he'll walk in -- won't be carrying this, we hope -- we
          17 think -- and the question will be at that next meeting:  How
          18 did that case go?
          19           It's up to you to supply the answer.  And if you
          20 want them to say, Oh, it went fine, it went fine, we didn't
          21 have any trouble, let's go ahead and keep that machine
          22 rolling, let's go keep putting the Winstons out there with
          23 their -- with their fake little holes there, let's go --
          24 let's go -- keep putting the flavorants in there to addict
          25 the kids, let's keep going, we're making money, that's one  59 answer.  That's your answer.
           2           But if you'd like them to say something else, if 3 you'd like them to look down and say, Whoa, what's going on,
           4 what's going on here, and say, you know what's going on, the
           5 truth is finally coming out, finally you've been exposed.
           6 Now what are you going to do about it?
           7           Thank you.


          13           MR. WILNER:  May it please the court?
          14           Well, we've now heard from Reynolds.  And
          15 apparently they are not repentant, apparently.
          16           MR. GEISE:  Your Honor, I object.  That's in
          17 violation of a pretrial order and is an improper closing
          18 reference.
          19           THE COURT:  Well, I'm uncertain.
          20           Watch your remarks, Mr. Wilner.  Go ahead with
          21 your argument.
          22           MR. WILNER:  By that I mean have they taken an
          23 ounce of responsibility?
          24           MR. GEISE:  And that's directly in violation of
          25 the pretrial ruling.  119 MR. WILNER:  I can't imagine, Your Honor.  He
           2 talked about our responsibility.
           3           THE COURT:  I'll presently overrule that
           4 objection.  Let me hear your argument, Mr. Wilner.  Go
           5 ahead.
           6           MR. WILNER:  Reynolds seems to think that it had
           7 no role in -- in this.  They seem to want to argue that they
           8 were not really there or they didn't do anything.
           9           And so what we heard was there's no connection
          10 between what Reynolds did and what happened to Mr. Pickett.
          11 And I was challenged to say, what's the bridge?
          12           Well, I don't care, really, what Reynolds said,
          13 because what they told other people and what they did in
          14 secret were two different things.
          15           But the bridge is right here.  Mr. Pickett, every
          16 day, twice through -- all of these, held them to his lips,
          17 lighted them, and inhaled the smoke that Reynolds had tested
          18 very carefully.
          19           And when he did that, he activated these vent
          20 holes and changed the chemistry of that smoke, which they
          21 had very carefully calculated.
          22           He -- as he smoked, the smoke that they had very
          23 carefully calculated how it would be delivered through deep
          24 inhalation into his lungs, went in there.  It caused 25 reactions that went to his brain.  And chronically, over a 120 long period of time, it developed his receptors, the
           2 receptors increased in number, and he became addicted.
           3           Now, is it just us saying that?  No.  In fact,
           4 there -- there was a challenge, I think, to Dr. Burns, who
           5 said that he was addicted and his addiction caused his
           6 disease.  And there was a challenge to Dr. Cummings, a great
           7 public health professional.
           8           So let's take a look just for a moment at the
           9 medical records, which are Joint Exhibit 246, because they
          10 were -- they have been overlooked.  Number one -- we'll show
          11 them one at a time real quick.
          12           You know, it's our belief in this case that
          13 listening to Reynolds' arguments is sometimes like being in
          14 a fun house mirror or something.
          15           I mean, it isn't -- it's just twisted.  It's not
          16 reality.  This is reality over here:  Left upper lung mass,
          17 very suspicious -- it's poorly focused.  I wonder if we can
          18 focus that.  Thanks.
          19           Very suspicious for bronchogenic carcinoma.
          20 That's the cancer that killed him.  Number two, nicotine
          21 addiction, right along beside it.  Why would the doctor say
          22 that?  It's obvious.  It's obvious.  Of course that's the
          23 cause of this epidemic.  Left lung mass, same thing, 24 nicotine addiction.
          25           Next.  The patient was discharged with NicoDerm 121 patch.  What was the date of this?  '95.  He was discharged
           2 with a patch to cure his addiction.  It didn't cure it.
           3           Tough.  But so addicted he was that, after
           4 diagnosing with cancer, they sent him home with a patch.
           5 Now, do you think he wanted it?  Of course he didn't.  I'll
           6 show you another one.
           7           Next.  Oh, this is the medical record from '95.
           8 Two-packs-a-day smoker for 40 years.  So there's no question
           9 about this.  If he's not an addicted smoker, there are no
          10 addicted smokers, we're back in the fun house mirror of
          11 Reynolds.
          12           Next.  This is interesting.  On the first -- on
          13 the 20th of January, number-one month, 1996 -- this is
          14 during the course of his treatment and after he was told
          15 that there would be no future -- call from patient
          16 requesting patches to quit smoking.
          17           So this poor man, who now had no longer a future,
          18 still wanted to try and get the monkey off his back and get
          19 out of the prison that he was in.
          20           So what is this talk that he quit or -- I mean, he
          21 might have quit at times and relapsed.  We know that.  But
          22 in 1996, with cancer in his body -- and this -- this 23 demolishes Reynolds' idea, Oh, he just loved it so much he
          24 just decided to forget it.  Really?
          25           Called again.  Called from home, you know.  And 122 it's unclear whether he was told beforehand about the
           2 ability to get a patch and what to do about it.
           3           Reynolds keeps blaming Oliver Pickett for not
           4 having a plan.  What plan did they offer?  What was the
           5 plan?  A patch?  That didn't come along until later.
           6           You see, all of that is the old way of thinking
           7 about addiction, where you just threw them down and walked
           8 away.  It works for some.  But for the other 60 million
           9 people who are, I would say, heavily addicted, or sometimes
          10 hopelessly addicted, it doesn't work.
          11           What's to determine whether you're one of the
          12 people who is lucky enough that you could break it?  Nobody
          13 knows that.  But we do know that for no fault of your own
          14 you're in the prison.  A lot of people are.
          15           In fact, most of the smokers today would like to
          16 quit.  To echo Claude Teague again, Many, but not most, are
          17 able to do so.
          18           Would you put up the young lady -- the young man
          19 and the young lady?  Okay.  So Reynolds says, Look, we
          20 don't -- we can't prove which advertisements might have
          21 affected his young impressionable mind.  And that's right. 22           It's part of this distorted view of reality
          23 that -- that anyone would ever know which individual
          24 advertisements would be seen on what day.  No one knows
          25 that. 123 But when you pour these things out there by the --
           2 by the millions and then you wonder, Does it work, well, why
           3 would you spend billions of dollars if it didn't work?  So
           4 how is this -- what is this about?
           5           Here is a gentleman on a beach with a young lady.
           6 Winston tastes good, like a cigarette should.  It doesn't
           7 say anything that cigarettes are good, bad, or indifferent
           8 in words.
           9           A picture, as we have -- as the advertising
          10 industry in this country has learned for years, a picture
          11 like this is worth all the words in the world.
          12           And this is just a still picture.  Can you imagine
          13 how powerful a -- a television commercial actually showing
          14 the people?
          15           Now, how many young kids -- and maybe Mr. Pickett.
          16 We don't know about this one.  There's so many of them --
          17 kept this image in their mind -- it was burned in their
          18 mind, the idea that smoking was cool, that we'd get the
          19 girl, that we'd be there on the beach?  We would be on the
          20 beach.  We would be lighting her cigarette.  Everything 21 would be good.
          22           But, you know, inside this package there was an
          23 early death lurking.  How horrible.  This was the scene of
          24 life, enjoy life, have another cigarette.
          25           And you'll see the ads here.  There's Santa Clause 124 giving out cigarettes, Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, so much fun.
           2 So much.  It would be fun -- it would be fun if one-third of
           3 the people who bought these were not dead from it.  Then it
           4 would be a real riot.
           5           So how is it that Reynolds can sit here -- can
           6 stand here and say that the American Cancer Society -- oh,
           7 it had a film.  It did.  How great.  And Reader's Digest --
           8 and, by God, so happy that Reader's Digest existed or else
           9 the curve of death would be even higher.
          10           But, no, there are -- yeah, it was there.  And we
          11 hope Oliver Pickett saw it.  Except if he turned out to be
          12 one of these people who was so addicted that he couldn't
          13 stop, as apparently he was, it just made him more unhappy
          14 with himself.  But look back at this.
          15           So an impressionable mind -- you know, Winston
          16 flavor gets a big hand everywhere.  This is just really,
          17 really nice, really fun.  And this was the way of life.
          18           This was reality in 1950 -- this is 1957.  It
          19 wasn't reality in the sense that there were really people on 20 the beach -- maybe there were.  But it was reality in that
          21 you couldn't walk outside without seeing things like this,
          22 every other billboard, every other magazine full of them,
          23 your television full of them.
          24           Now, am I saying that this is a bad thing to
          25 advertise?  Well, yes.  Because if you believe that Reynolds 125 knew in 1957 what they're claiming the plaintiffs and
           2 everyone else seemed to have known, what the American Cancer
           3 Society was trying to get the message out -- this was right
           4 around the time of CPS-I, one of the largest studies in
           5 history.  And they had shown a huge increase in lung cancer.
           6 And that's available to Reynolds.
           7           In 1952 you saw -- and, incidentally, I was
           8 challenged for not cross-examining Dr. Gentry enough.  Well,
           9 we're kind of limited here.  Dr. Gentry had the opportunity
          10 to bring out whatever documents he wanted with his own
          11 attorneys.
          12           But, remember, there was also the question of
          13 Dr. Cook, who was on tape -- or on video.  And he discussed
          14 a lot of the corporate history.  A lot of it was very
          15 interesting.
          16           And there was also Mr. Heimann who denied
          17 everything.  So if you really want to see what reality was
          18 for the cigarette companies, it was Mr. Heimann in 19- -- 19 who was president of American, now part of Reynolds, in 1980
          20 who just said, No, nothing's true, nothing's true, the
          21 Surgeon General is dead wrong.  That's really what they did.
          22           And if you want to hear -- want to see another
          23 interesting point from Reynolds -- and I'm going to get to
          24 this nonsense in a minute.  But the way that -- that they
          25 have always twisted reality -- look at Exhibit No. 450. 126 And you will see as late as 1979 that they were
           2 coming out with a whole list of anti Surgeon General pseudo
           3 science, junk science articles, saying, Well, you can't
           4 really prove it, it's not 100 percent, you don't know -- and
           5 it's a lot of -- a lot of what we heard here from their old
           6 friend, Dr. Brusick, who used to work in their -- for them
           7 doing their work, who said, Oh, you can't prove it because
           8 you don't know which molecule hits you.  So I'll get back to
           9 that in a minute.
          10           But so here they go from the early '50s with
          11 knowledge aforethought, knowing that they want kids to
          12 smoke, going after them as hard as they can.
          13           And we totally agree that the Cancer Society was
          14 there whispering in one ear.  Only there was loud music
          15 playing in the other.  Some people could hear this more than
          16 they heard that.  Some heard that more than they heard this.
          17           You know, how did they gauge their success?  By 18 the amount of people that they got to smoke.  Because that
          19 was their sell.  And now they want to say, Well, we were
          20 successful.  But that wasn't -- that was all his fault, the
          21 fact that we were very good at marketing this product.
          22           So -- several things.  Now, Reynolds now says, Oh,
          23 it was the body shop.  And I want -- let me take a moment to
          24 address that, because, of all the distortions we've heard,
          25 that's a big one. 127 The body shop -- well, no one denied that there
           2 were potential carcinogens in the body shop.  Let's go over
           3 this one more time.
           4           This IARC is charged with identifying any cancer.
           5 And we're 100 percent behind it.  And so is Dr. Burns,
           6 public health professional, 100 percent.
           7           How much cancer is in body shops?  Good question.
           8 Well, you don't just go through and list what might be
           9 there, because you don't know the concentrations or how it's
          10 used and everything else.
          11           So the way you do it -- one of the big branches of
          12 science to determine this causation issue is epidemiology.
          13 So you go through and you count hundreds of thousands of
          14 people who have been in body shops, some of them all their
          15 lives, some of them not all their lives, some of them wore
          16 the masks all the time, some of them didn't, some of them 17 sanded, some of them didn't.
          18           When you get 100,000 people, you have covered all
          19 the possibilities.  And then you see what the lung cancer
          20 rate is.  And the highest they got was about 1.4 over the
          21 background rate of 35, which turned out to be something
          22 like -- depending on which calculation, 49 or 70 -- we went
          23 back and forth, but not more than 70 out of 100,000 per
          24 year, compared to 829 -- 70 versus 829 for the cigarettes.
          25           For some reason Dr. Brusick just didn't want to 128 get there, just didn't want to think about that.  And one of
           2 the reasons was I don't think he was familiar with it.
           3           But Reynolds confuses -- by mentioning CSI
           4 confuses what we're here for.  This isn't a criminal case.
           5 We're not charged with beyond a reasonable doubt or beyond
           6 all possible doubt.  No one knows what molecule hit -- was
           7 hit by what.  We know that this happens -- 829 per 100,000
           8 per year dying of lung cancer who are in Mr. Pickett's
           9 smoking group.
          10           We know that 40, maybe -- or 30 or 49 or even 70
          11 painters who don't smoke might get lung cancer.  And 35 of
          12 those would be people who got it anyway from no exposure.
          13           And, in fact, ultimately the reasoning was
          14 exposed, and that was even the people in this -- in this
          15 group here, the 35 -- he couldn't say.  And he couldn't say 16 because no one can go back and look and see microscopically
          17 which cell mutated first.  If you had to, there could be no
          18 cases like this.  There could be no case at all, because
          19 nobody can go back.
          20           So, really, that's what he was saying.  The rest
          21 of it is just pump-up.  No, we don't know that.  But we know
          22 this.  We know -- we don't know which cell.  We know what
          23 happened in the end.  We know what happened in the end
          24 because it happens all the time.
          25           We know what's most probable.  We know what the 129 preponderance -- that's a word of probability.  We know what
           2 preponderance means.  And preponderance means -- not this,
           3 not trying theoretically to find that.  This is what
           4 preponderance means.  That's preponderance.  This is tiny.
           5           And even if they both somehow interacted, what
           6 if -- what if that happened?  What if one bullet came -- all
           7 these smoking bullets came, 850, with a power of 850?  And
           8 with a power of 40 maybe some -- maybe there was one.  I
           9 don't care.  You'll be told that if two or more things
          10 combine, that's just concurrent cause.  That's not -- that's
          11 fine.  We're -- we're -- that's -- we are not required to
          12 prove no other cause could possibly play a role.  We've
          13 never been able -- never been required to prove that.
          14           So that's -- that is the typical kind of 15 distortion that the -- that you will see -- if you review
          16 these documents from a cigarette industry, you'll see more
          17 and more of it.
          18           Dr. Gentry went on and said, The Tobacco Working
          19 Group, that's my defense.  The Tobacco Working Group,
          20 remember, was never told what Reynolds knew about why people
          21 smoke.
          22           And what Reynolds knew -- and I'm going to go
          23 through a few documents my last few minutes.  What Reynolds
          24 knew was that cigarette smoking was addictive at the
          25 physical level. 130 What they did about it wasn't tell the Tobacco
           2 Working Group that the only way to bring this cancer rate
           3 under control -- it wasn't -- it wasn't going to work just
           4 putting on -- just trying to take out one thing or another.
           5 The only way to do it -- there's only -- this is the
           6 equation, addiction times carcinogens equals disease.
           7 Addiction causes persistent use.  Carcinogens combined with
           8 persistent use, one-third of your people die.
           9           What do you do about it?  Well, I guess if you'd
          10 take out the carcinogens that would be great.  But you
          11 can't.  Can't.  It's burning.  Or you could make a super
          12 cigarette that doesn't burn.  Fine.  It was never available
          13 to Mr. Pickett, ever. 14           Or you can take out the addiction, in which case,
          15 like a campfire, you're not around it enough to cause
          16 cancer.  Great solution.  Great for Mr. Pickett.  Great for
          17 the world.  Guess who it's not great for.  Reynolds.
          18 Because without persistent use, you don't get your money.
          19           And if there's one thing we want to try and
          20 express, it's that addiction is driving disease and
          21 addiction is driving profits for R.J. Reynolds.
          22           And that's the central -- if there's one central
          23 point, regardless of all the details, that's the point.  It
          24 is that Reynolds has resisted and continues to resist the
          25 whole idea of addiction. 131 They -- they give lip service to it, to use their
           2 term, but they don't take it seriously except in their
           3 design.
           4           Now, here's what I urge you to read.  Reality
           5 again.  The Surgeon General 2010 is Exhibit 237.  And
           6 cigarette design is one of the chapters.  We read from it a
           7 great deal of time.
           8           How much?
           9           (Counsel confer.)
          10           MR. WILNER:  We read through it for quite a bit.
          11 It's page 15 to 17.  And it talks about cigarette design
          12 changes over the years.  And it is exactly opposite to what 13 Dr. Gentry said.  It couldn't be more different.
          14           So the last paragraph -- and I won't put it up
          15 because it takes time.  Other changes in the past 50 years,
          16 changes in design, have included efforts that potentially
          17 have made cigarettes more addictive through the use of
          18 flavors, chemical treatments to alter the smell and
          19 appearance of cigarette smoke, methods to mask noxious
          20 sensory effects, and control of the nicotine dose.
          21           These approaches included new types of filters,
          22 tobacco blends, and ingredients, cigarette ventilation,
          23 controlled pH, and efforts to reduce various volatile
          24 organic compounds in tobacco and smoke.  These product
          25 modifications have the potential to increase the risk of 132 addiction by contributing to increased risk of initiating
           2 use of the product.
           3           Well, how about that?  That's kids.  Initiating
           4 use.  So the design was there to increase the likelihood
           5 that people would initiate use.  Okay?
           6           Increase ease of smoke inhalation.  What is that?
           7 We know what inhalation -- deeper inhalation does two
           8 things.  One -- both of them terrible.  One, it promotes
           9 addiction, because the deeper you inhale the more blood --
          10 air surface there is, the quicker it goes to the brain.
          11 Response from the brain, you're addicted.  What does deep 12 inhalation do also?  Adenocarcinoma.
          13           We've heard that.  It's in the Surgeon General's
          14 report just a little before this one.  You can read it.  It
          15 actually says, Deeper inhalation produces adenocarcinoma.
          16           Number three, Increase -- decrease noxiousness and
          17 possibly increase brain and nicotine exposure.  That's that
          18 free nicotine that you get when you design your cigarette to
          19 deliver the kick that you want it to deliver.
          20           And I can -- I can't read the whole thing.  But if
          21 you read page 15 to 17 -- it's not us.  It's not me.  It's
          22 the latest Surgeon General.
          23           And one more thing.  We heard, Oh, the Surgeon
          24 General says that it's choice, whatever that means.  It's
          25 always -- there's always some choice involved in everything. 133 But that does not mean that there is no addiction.
           2           So in the chapter on nicotine addiction, what does
           3 the Surgeon General say, page 105 of the Surgeon General's
           4 report of 2010?  Page 105.  You will have it.
           5           Here's what it says, Nicotine addiction is the
           6 fundamental reason that individuals persist in using tobacco
           7 products.  And this persistent tobacco use contributes to
           8 the many diseases described in this report.
           9           Now, is that what Reynolds said?  No.  They
          10 said -- they would like to say, Oh, people's choice to smoke 11 is the fundamental reason that individuals persist in using
          12 tobacco products.  That's their argument.  But that's not
          13 modern science.
          14           Modern science is, Nicotine addiction is the
          15 fundamental reason, because we now understand, later than we
          16 should, that it is a brain disease and that it is driving --
          17 it is driving people to take the next cigarette.
          18           And if we look at Mr. Pickett's history, do we
          19 have a real question?  On his deathbed he's asking for a
          20 patch, on his deathbed.
          21           If that's not a man in prison, who has been in
          22 prison -- and can you imagine his feeling at that time and
          23 what the people around him are seeing, a man who is in
          24 control of everything except that, a man who could do
          25 everything but get out of jail, this one prison that they 134 knew about, and that they coldly calculated in 1982 by
           2 saying -- by calling it the exit gate, our customers are
           3 behind the exit gate?
           4           And if it gets open, we go out of business.  So
           5 what do we do?  We close it.  We keep it closed.  How do we
           6 keep it closed?  All these changes, all these design things
           7 that we just talked about.
           8           Now, if you feel that that is the wrong response
           9 and that a different response would be proper, if you feel 10 that instead of talking about getting carcinogens out that
          11 you couldn't do, or designing a cigarette that no one
          12 bought, some kind of a Premier that was not even available,
          13 that the secret to controlling this epidemic -- and, in
          14 fact, here it is again on page 105 on nicotine addiction,
          15 the 2010, Tobacco addiction remains a substantial problem in
          16 the United States and worldwide.
          17           They say, Any efforts -- any efforts to reduce
          18 tobacco-related disease must take into account the addiction
          19 potential of a tobacco product.
          20           And so if you feel that Reynolds has not taken
          21 into account properly, that they have not gone ahead with a
          22 design that minimizes addiction, but instead have been very
          23 happy to make their profits off the highly addictive Winston
          24 cigarettes that kill one-third of the people, they need to
          25 be told that. 135 And this district court can tell them -- just like
           2 the FDA can tell them, just like the government can tell
           3 them, this district court can do it.  And few people have
           4 had the background that you have to allow that message to
           5 occur.
           6           So if you feel that it's proper and the right
           7 thing to do, to give Reynolds the message that this is
           8 not -- you cannot continue to do business in this way, this 9 is not a good thing, these must evolve into nonaddictive
          10 products that do not further addict our children and do not
          11 further put one-third of the people who use them behind the
          12 gates -- behind the prison of the exit gate, then we suggest
          13 it's that question nine that says, yes, we -- we want to
          14 send a message.
          15           Thank you.
