 3                     CLOSING ARGUMENT
 4             MR. BIERSTEKER:  Thank you, your Honor.
 5             May it please the Court, Counsel,
 6        Mrs. Piendle.  And good morning, barely, ladies
 7        and gentlemen of the jury.  I don't know how I
 8        drew the short straw, I'm going to go about two
 9        hours, we're going to be hungry, I'm sorry, 10        that's the schedule.
11             We're coming to the end of a long process,
12        and before I discuss the evidence and the
13        issues in this case, I want to thank you on
14        behalf of myself, Liza Kessler, John
15        Wiederhold, Will Farrell, and especially on
16        behalf of R.J. Reynolds.
17             We've kept you here a long time.  We've
18        kept you here late many days.  You have endured
19        inconvenience, and some of you have had some
20        personal hardships, and you've all interrupted
21        your personal lives.
22             You've paid careful attention and, in
23        fact, you've taken notes, many notes, and
24        you've asked thoughtful questions.  So all of
25        that shows just how hard you've been

 1        concentrating and thinking as the evidence came
 2        in.  You have fulfilled your civic duty and
 3        played an essential role in ensuring that our
 4        system of justice is just.  And make no mistake
 5        about it, R.J. Reynolds is interested in
 6        justice too.
 7             You have our gratitude, you have our
 8        respect, and now the hard part comes for you.
 9        You must be fair, impartial, and dispassionate
10        judges of the facts.  You must put aside your
11        emotions and your sympathy, and you've got to
12        all -- I mean, we all feel some sympathy for
13        Mrs. Piendle, who wouldn't, who wouldn't, but
14        you have to put that aside, and you have to be
15        dispassionate and you have to decide this case
16        based upon the evidence in accordance with the
17        law that the Court has given you.
18             All right.  I told you in my opening
19        statement that this trial was all about
20        Mr. Piendle and the choices that he made, and I
21        told you that there was four groups of issues.
22             If I could have the next slide, please.
23             Class membership, findings and legal
24        cause, I referred to that as the bridge,
25        responsibility, and damages.

 1             And I'm going to talk to you in my closing
 2        argument this morning and early this afternoon
 3        about the choices that Mr. Piendle made and how
 4        they relate to these four groups of issues.
 5             But before I begin, I want you to keep two
 6        things in mind.  First, as the Court has
 7        instructed you, the plaintiff bears the burden
 8        of proof on her claims.  She has to prove her
 9        case by the greater weight of the evidence, and
10        when it comes to punitive damages, she must
11        meet an even higher burden of proof, clear and
12        convincing evidence.
13             And the Court has defined those terms in
14        the instructions that you-all have and you can
15        take back to the jury room with you, but I want
16        to say this, they mean that plaintiff, not
17        Reynolds, not Philip Morris, has to carry the
18        burden of proof on each and every one of the
19        claims that she has presented for you.  And the
20        plaintiff basically starts at zero, in the 21        basement, and she's got to build her case brick
22        by brick, step by step, and she's got to carry
23        you with her the whole way until there's a
24        greater weight of the evidence, and for
25        punitive damages, she's got to take you even

 1        higher to clear and convincing evidence.
 2             Second observation I want to make before I
 3        discuss the issues, and that's this.  The
 4        Court's instructions, and I know they're hard
 5        to read, they're even hard for lawyers, but the
 6        Court's instructions are a road map to filling
 7        out the verdict form.
 8             Mr. Barnhart went through that form
 9        probably in about two minutes and just was
10        checking boxes, left, right and center.  That's
11        not the way to do it.  You have to follow the
12        law that her Honor has given you, and the
13        instructions are that law.
14             So from time to time, even though it's not
15        like reading a novel, I'm going to put up
16        pieces of the instructions up on the screen or
17        over here on the boards for you to look at as
18        we discuss the issues in this case.  But that's
19        your road map.  You can't fill out the verdict
20        form without following the road map.
21             Okay.  So now let's turn to the evidence
22        and let's talk about the issues.  And the first
23        question on the verdict form, was Charles
24        Piendle addicted to cigarettes containing
25        nicotine, and if so, was such addiction a legal

 1        cause of his lung cancer and death?
 2             It has, as we discussed in voir dire,
 3        basically -- there's two questions.  One is
 4        addiction, that's underlined there, and that's
 5        the first one I'm going to talk about, and the
 6        second was legal cause, and I'm going to talk
 7        about that next.
 8             All right.  So was Mr. Piendle addicted?
 9        The Court didn't define addiction for you in
10        those instructions.  You can read them all day
11        and you won't find it.  And you're going to
12        have to decide what it means.
13             And when Mrs. Piendle was on the stand, I
14        confronted her with interrogatory responses,
15        those signed answers to written questions that
16        she gave when this case was being prepared, and
17        her position was that addiction is a medical
18        issue, which should be a medical diagnosis.
19        Addiction is a medical diagnosis, I'm not
20        qualified to say whether the smoker was
21        addicted, medical records, medical records,
22        doctors will have to say, the doctors, all the
23        way through.
24             And we agree, addiction must be medically
25        diagnosed.  That's the standard that I would

 1        adopt.  That's the standard that the plaintiff
 2        adopted.
 3             And what's the evidence been?  Let's talk
 4        about what the plaintiff presented, because
 5        after all, the plaintiff has the burden of 6        proof.  And as you heard from Dr. Benowitz when
 7        he was on the stand, there's something called
 8        the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Roman
 9        numeral IV, from the American Association of
10        the -- the American Psychiatric Association,
11        the APA, and it is the test that is used by
12        psychiatrists and psychologists to actually
13        diagnose addiction medically.
14             The Fagerstrom test that you heard about
15        during the course of the trial, and that was
16        dwelled on a little bit by Mr. Barnhart in his
17        closing, is not, is not, I repeat, a medical
18        diagnosis of addiction.
19             The Fagerstrom test just assumes that
20        everybody who takes the test is addicted.  You
21        can be a never smoker and you are still
22        dependent under that test.  And Dr. Benowitz
23        testified it is not a test for diagnosis as
24        that term is medically understood.
25             Okay.  So plaintiff offered no medical

 1        diagnosis that Mr. Piendle was addicted.
 2             And as I mentioned, plaintiff, when she
 3        was up on the stand, as Mr. Barnhart said,
 4        filled out the Fagerstrom test at trial, even
 5        though she admitted she didn't know if
 6        Mr. Piendle was addicted at any time that she
 7        knew him.
 8             But again, the Fagerstrom test is not a
 9        medical diagnosis of addiction, even if
10        plaintiff and Ms. Baker-Barnes had put on
11        doctors' coats, it doesn't change it, that's
12        not what the test is for.
13             And speaking of the Fagerstrom test, how
14        could Mrs. Piendle know which cigarette
15        Mr. Piendle would hate to give up most?  How
16        would she really know that he smoked four
17        cigarettes in the morning?  Remember, she
18        didn't even notice that he quit for two days.
19             Plaintiff also called three experts and
20        paid each of them a lot of money to review the
21        medical records and the depositions and other
22        materials in this case, but none of them
23        offered the medical diagnosis of addiction.
24             First, there was Dr. Cummings.  Of course,
25        he couldn't give medical diagnosis, he's not a

 1        doctor.  He didn't apply to Mr. Piendle the
 2        DSM-IV criteria that psychiatrists and
 3        psychologists use every day to diagnose
 4        addiction.  He just gave you a nonmedical
 5        assessment, it was a rule of thumb, and it was
 6        a nonmedical rule of thumb.  And it was, you
 7        smoke a hundred cigarettes in your lifetime and
 8        you're smoking daily, voil√†, you're addicted.
 9             And frankly, Dr. Cummings, the health
10        educator, was a little bit out of his league on
11        this subject.  I noticed that some of you in
12        your questioning picked up on this.  And it had
13        to do with the permanent changes in the brain.
14             And if you'll remember, Dr. Benowitz has
15        published all those peer-reviewed articles and
16        he's done a lot of research on nicotine, and he 17        clearly testified that within a few weeks after
18        quitting, the nicotine receptors in the brain
19        go back to normal.
20             And then it was one of your questions,
21        because you noticed a discrepancy with what
22        Dr. Cummings said, and he said, well, the
23        number of receptors don't change, talking about
24        after he quit, and once he developed more
25        receptors for nicotine, that is one of the

 1        reasons it's so easy to fall back into smoking
 2        again.
 3             Now, ask yourselves, who do you trust
 4        more?  I think the answer is pretty obvious.
 5             So that was Dr. Cummings, but who, by the
 6        way, I don't think ever testified, search your
 7        memories, that he had anything do with the 1999
 8        Surgeon General's report, notwithstanding the
 9        demonstrative that Mr. Barnhart put up.
10             In any event, that's Dr. Cummings.  Let's
11        talk about Dr. Burns.  Dr. Burns is a medical
12        doctor, but Dr. Burns also never diagnosed
13        Mr. Piendle as addicted medically under the
14        DSM-IV criteria.  Instead, he talked about
15        compulsive use of and you've lost the ability
16        to freely choose the next use of the substance.
17        Another rule of thumb, without any evidence
18        from Dr. Burns, that it is used to diagnose
19        addiction medically, none, he never said that.
20             And in cross-examination, I asked him
21        about his medical practice.  And you may
22        recall, I asked him about his own patients.
23        And he said, you know, if a patient comes to me
24        and says, I'm not addicted, I tell them
25        basically, put them down for a month, come back

 1        and see me, and if you're not smoking, you're
 2        probably not addicted.
 3             Ladies and gentlemen, that's Mr. Piendle.
 4             All right.  Let's talk about Dr. Benowitz.
 5        He's the guy who's done a ton of research on
 6        nicotine in the brain, he's also a medical
 7        doctor.  He actually talked about the DSM-IV
 8        criteria during the course of his testimony
 9        before you.  But here's the curious part.
10        Plaintiff never asked Dr. Benowitz at trial to
11        actually use the DSM-IV criteria to medically
12        diagnose Mr. Piendle as addicted.  He too just
13        gave a rule of thumb, and there it is.  Five
14        cigarettes a day, probably addicted.  That was
15        his answer.  And again, no testimony that is
16        sufficient to constitute a medical diagnosis of
17        addiction.
18             So not one of plaintiff's experts came
19        before you and said Mr. Piendle medically was
20        addicted.  And for that reason, and because the
21        plaintiff bears the burden of proof, remember
22        that, the defense didn't call an expert to come
23        in and apply the DSM-IV criteria to
24        Mr. Piendle.
25             And interestingly, nor did any of

 1        Mr. Piendle's doctors diagnose Mr. Piendle as 2        addicted.  Nor did any of his doctors treat
 3        Mr. Piendle as addicted.  You heard that
 4        testimony.  And interestingly, Mr. Piendle
 5        never said he was addicted either.
 6             So in short, plaintiff did not carry her
 7        burden of showing that Mr. Piendle was addicted
 8        under the very standard that the plaintiff and
 9        her legal counsel in this case adopted at the
10        beginning of the case.
11             But let's say, contrary to the position of
12        both plaintiff and the defense, you decide to
13        use some nonmedical rule of thumb instead of
14        the medical definition of addiction.  Let's say
15        you also conclude that under some nonmedical
16        rule of thumb, Mr. Piendle was addicted.  Then
17        what?
18             Well, then you get to the second threshold
19        issue, and that was, was any addiction --
20             Next slide, please, Will.
21             -- a legal cause of his lung cancer and
22        death?
23             And I want to spend just a minute before
24        we get into discussing addiction in this
25        connection talking to you about legal cause.

 1        It's a very important issue, it comes up when
 2        we talk about the bridge between the findings
 3        and the companies, and it's all over the
 4        Court's instructions.  So I just want to touch
 5        on it briefly.
 6             And remember the legal definition.  Cause
 7        means --
 8             If I could have the next demonstrative,
 9        please, Will.
10             -- basically contributes substantially,
11        contributes substantially, and then it's
12        defined so that it can be reasonably said that
13        but for the addiction to cigarettes -- this
14        language appears time after time, not always
15        addiction, it depends upon negligence or
16        defect, but it appears all the time --
17        contributes substantially so it can be said
18        that but for the addiction to cigarettes
19        containing nicotine, the death would not have
20        occurred.  But for.
21             Now, the words "contributes substantially"
22        appear several times during the course of
23        instructions.  It's defined the first time it's
24        used in connection with every issue as a
25        but-for cause.  It's not always redefined when

 1        it's used the next time, but it means the same
 2        thing, but-for cause.  That's what plaintiff
 3        has to prove, and that's true for each and
 4        every one of the issues for causation, it's
 5        important, and it's important to every issue in
 6        the case.  Again, look at the instructions.
 7        That's what it means.
 8             All right.  So let's turn to the evidence
 9        now and on whether addiction was a legal cause
10        of Mr. Piendle's death.  The evidence was that
11        Mr. Piendle chose to smoke, chose to start
12        smoking.  Nobody disputes that.  He chose to 13        continue smoking.
14             And even though he could quit -- again,
15        not an issue, everybody agrees he could quit.
16        He chose not do so until 1989, and then he made
17        up his mind and he quit.  And here is the
18        important part, there is no evidence that it
19        was hard for him to quit, notwithstanding what
20        Mr. Barnhart said in his closing.  Search your
21        memories, that evidence isn't there.
22             What happened was Mr. Piendle put them
23        down and he never picked them up again.  He
24        quit cold turkey in 1989.  He didn't need help,
25        he didn't ask for help, he didn't get help, he

 1        just did it.  And significantly, when
 2        Mr. Piendle quit in 1989, he didn't have the
 3        withdrawal symptoms that truly addicted smokers
 4        sometimes experience.
 5             Next demonstrative, please, Will.
 6             And these are the, quote/unquote, awful
 7        withdrawal symptoms that Mr. Barnhart was
 8        talking about.  I have to tell you, compared to
 9        alcohol and heroin, these are not awful.  He
10        had no trouble sleeping, no anxiety, no
11        difficulty concentrating, no evidence he had
12        weight gain or ate more.  No headaches, sore or
13        dry throat.  There was no evidence of any of
14        that, the classic withdrawal symptoms.
15             And Mr. Cabral, his best friend, said he
16        didn't notice anything different about him.
17        Ms. Worobel, his other best friend, never said
18        that he seemed different.  His brother,
19        Mr. Edward Piendle, said he didn't notice
20        anything different about him, except he was
21        always chewing on those toothpicks.
22             The only withdrawal symptom that anybody
23        ever suggested he might have had when he quit
24        smoking was that he was a little moody.
25        Mrs. Piendle said that.  Mrs. Piendle didn't

 1        say he was moody because he snapped at her.
 2        She didn't say that he was moody because he
 3        lost his temper over the little things in life.
 4        She said he was moody because he talked to her
 5        less.  That's it.  That was the basis for
 6        saying Mr. Piendle was moody.
 7             Well, he couldn't have been that moody.
 8        Again, Mrs. Piendle didn't notice he quit
 9        smoking for almost two days.  And as you
10        learned from Dr. Benowitz, the withdrawal
11        effects that somebody has whenever they quit
12        basically are the strongest in the first week
13        after they quit.
14             And you know what, there's other reasons
15        that might explain why Mr. Piendle was talking
16        to Mrs. Piendle less after he first quit
17        smoking.  Now, let's talk about those.  There
18        are really two.  First, Mrs. Piendle, as you
19        heard, was upset with Mr. Piendle for quitting.
20        It was something that she thought they should
21        do it together, and she was a little mad at him
22        that he went off and did it on his own.  Now,
23        your common sense should tell you that if 24        somebody is upset with somebody else, they
25        might not talk to them as much.

 1             Second, Mrs. Piendle told us, hey, you
 2        know, in 1989 I wasn't ready to quit and,
 3        indeed, she didn't even try.  She was still
 4        smoking two packs of cigarettes a day at that
 5        time.  And Mr. Piendle, at least at first when
 6        he first quit, would leave the room when she
 7        lit up in front of him.  No wonder he was
 8        talking to her less.  He wasn't in the room
 9        much of the time.
10             All right.  That's 1989.  What about
11        before 1989?  Initially, Mr. Piendle didn't
12        smoke where smoking isn't allowed.  He was able
13        to refrain from smoking without a problem or a
14        complaint.
15             For example --
16             The next slide, please.
17             -- he didn't smoke at church.  He didn't
18        complain about not being able to smoke at
19        church.  He didn't leave church in the middle
20        of service to go and smoke a cigarette.  Same
21        thing for the movies.  No complaints, no
22        problem not smoking during movies.  Didn't
23        leave movies in the middle of them to go sneak
24        a cigarette.
25             He didn't smoke in bed.  You heard about

 1        that, except possibly after his meal that he
 2        had every evening.  He didn't get out of bed to
 3        smoke in the middle of the night.  He didn't
 4        rush through meals to smoke.  You heard all
 5        that.  You also heard that he did not have his
 6        first cigarette in the morning in bed.
 7             There's been kind of confusing testimony,
 8        but Alan Cannizzio, who you heard by
 9        deposition, he didn't come here, Mrs. Piendle's
10        son, basically said it was disgusting if
11        somebody would smoke while they're eating.  And
12        his testimony was Mr. Piendle smoked after
13        breakfast when he was having his coffee.
14        Again, the evidence is a little fuzzy, but that
15        was about the clearest testimony you had.
16             And there's been no evidence that
17        Mr. Piendle tried to quit in the 1950s or '60s
18        when, according to Dr. Benowitz, it would have
19        been easier for him.  Remember, Dr. Benowitz
20        says, the longer you smoke, the more withdrawal
21        symptoms you'll have, at least as a general
22        rule.
23             Okay.  And, sure, plaintiff didn't do so
24        in closing, but during the course of the trial
25        talked a fair amount about those New Year's

 1        resolutions, as if they were evidence that
 2        quitting smoking was hard for Mr. Piendle.
 3             But you heard Dr. Burns talk about
 4        cognitive dissonance, and basically smokers
 5        enjoy smoking on the one hand, they know it's
 6        bad for them on the other hand, and they're
 7        conflicted.  They're conflicted.
 8             Ask yourself:  Did Mr. Piendle really want 9        to quit smoking before 1989?  What's the
10        evidence that you heard during the course of
11        this trial?  Remember, those New Year's
12        resolutions weren't all that memorable to
13        Mrs. Piendle.  She really wasn't sure how many
14        there were, and she couldn't tell us in what
15        years they occurred.
16             She even said different things about
17        whether they actually quit or whether they just
18        tried to cut down.
19             The next demonstrative, please, Will.
20        There you go.
21             On direct examination, Mrs. Piendle left
22        you with the impression that for those New
23        Year's resolutions, she and Mr. Piendle would
24        smoke their last cigarette, last one in the
25        pack, and then actually stop smoking cigarettes

 1        altogether for a day or a day and a half.  But
 2        on cross-examination, Mrs. Piendle admitted
 3        that the New Year's resolutions in the 1970s
 4        and the '80s were attempts to cut back and to
 5        limit the number of cigarettes they would
 6        smoke, with the idea that they might quit
 7        smoking altogether.
 8             Little unclear whether they actually quit,
 9        but this much we do know -- this much we do
10        know, the evidence was crystal clear that the
11        Piendles weren't doing any of the things that
12        you would expect somebody who was truly
13        committed to smoking -- to quitting smoking
14        that they would do.
15             So -- and, again, you heard this, didn't
16        throw away the ashtrays, didn't throw away the
17        lighters, never went to a doctor or a smoking
18        cessation clinic, no hypnosis, no prescription
19        of any kind.  And, yes, nicotine gum was
20        probably the predominant prescription available
21        at any time.  And they never told their friends
22        and family they were trying because they didn't
23        want to be embarrassed if they didn't make it.
24        In short, the Piendles truly were hedging their
25        bets.

 1             Could you really say that they were
 2        committed -- that Mr. Piendle was committed to
 3        smoking in connection with any of those New
 4        Year's resolutions?
 5             And I would say submit that Mr. Piendle
 6        was in control of his smoking based upon the
 7        evidence you heard, and it was not the other
 8        way around.  And that's consistent with
 9        everything that we were told about him by all
10        of his family members and friends who came here
11        to testify and who knew him the best.
12             They said he was strong-willed.  He wasn't
13        a weak man.  Only Mr. Barnhart said that in his
14        opening.  Nobody else did.  He was decisive.
15        The Marines and all the other Marines who came
16        after him were wusses.  He was a straight and
17        narrow kind of guy.  It's all consistent with
18        what Plaintiff's expert, Dr. Benowitz said.
19             If we could have the next slide.  Next one 20        after this.  Too many.  Never mind.
21             Also consistent with what Dr. Benowitz
22        said, and you'll remember he said, addiction is
23        really, you know, a control issue.  Do you have
24        control of use of the drugs?  That means, if
25        you want to stop, you can stop.  If you want to

 1        smoke fewer, you can smoke fewer.  Mr. Piendle
 2        had that control.  That's what the evidence has
 3        been, and nobody has told you otherwise.  He
 4        could quit.  No addiction prevented him from
 5        quitting, and he could have quit sooner than he
 6        did.
 7             Plaintiff, in short, has not proven that
 8        any addiction so controlled Mr. Piendle that it
 9        was a but-for cause of his continued smoking
10        and his lung cancer.  The evidence was that
11        he -- just as he started to smoke, basically to
12        fit in, he decided to quit after many of his
13        friends and family members had quit smoking.
14             Mrs. Piendle testified that a number of
15        folks they knew had quit smoking and had urged
16        Mr. Piendle to quit.  That included his sister,
17        Christy Verrelli, and his good friend -- maybe
18        his best friend, Lucille Worobel.  There's
19        another reality here that Tracy Piendle
20        addressed when she was on the stand.
21             Mr. Piendle was approaching 50.  In 1989,
22        he was 48 years old.  That's one year older
23        than his father was when he died of a heart
24        attack in 1966.  His dad, I think, was 47, and
25        in connection with that, Mr. Piendle made some

 1        lifestyle changes.  He started to go to the
 2        gym.  He quit smoking.  Those were some of
 3        them.
 4             I submit to you that Plaintiff does not
 5        carry her burden of proving class membership,
 6        no.  There was no proof that Mr. Piendle was
 7        addicted, if that term is used medically, a
 8        standard that the plaintiff herself has adopted
 9        in this case.  There was no proof that any
10        addiction was a but-for cause -- but-for legal
11        cause of Mr. Piendle's continued smoking and
12        lung cancer.  And because Plaintiff hasn't met
13        that burden, I would ask that you check "no" on
14        the -- in answer to the first question on the
15        verdict form.
16             Okay.  I'll switch gears a little bit.
17        Let's say you disagree with me.  It's always a
18        possibility, I know.  And you find that
19        Mr. Piendle was a member of the class and then
20        you have more issues to decide.  The Court has
21        instructed you on certain findings made by the
22        class action jury in the Engle case.
23             And remember the Court's instruction that
24        you saw in voir dire, and you have heard twice,
25        I think, since then.  It's on the board.  It's

 1        what Mr. Kelly referred to as the rest of the
 2        story during voir dire, and, indeed, it is.
 3        And the Court has specifically instructed you
 4        that the findings do not mean that the 5        plaintiff is entitled to prevail in this case,
 6        you've got to have more.  She has got to prove
 7        more.
 8             And what you are going to be asked to do
 9        if you get this far, is to take the findings,
10        apply the evidence you have heard, and decide
11        if Plaintiff has met her burden again -- it's
12        still her burden -- of proving that the breach
13        of those duties, the misconduct by the
14        defendants, was a legal cause of Mr. Piendle's
15        smoking and ultimately his death from lung
16        cancer.
17             And again, I just want to come back to
18        legal cause.  You'll see this repeatedly in the
19        instructions.  It is not enough.  I repeat.  It
20        is not enough that Plaintiff proved that any
21        addiction caused Mr. Piendle's lung cancer and
22        death.  That's not enough.  Rather, Plaintiff
23        must also show -- I have a series of slides
24        here, and they all say the same thing -- must
25        also show that the conduct of the defendants,

 1        whether it's negligence --
 2             Next one, please.
 3             -- whether it's defect, whether it's
 4        concealment or agreement to conceal, that still
 5        has to show legal cause but for, but for the
 6        conduct that was negligence, but for the
 7        defect, but for the concealment, but for the
 8        agreement to conceal, Mr. Piendle would not
 9        have continued smoking and would not have
10        gotten lung cancer.  And legal cause still
11        means the same thing, substantially contributes
12        but for, every time you see it.
13             So Plaintiff had to build that causal
14        bridge that I talked about before.  She had to
15        link the generic findings on one shoulder to
16        Mr. Piendle on the other, and show that there
17        was but-for causation in between them.  She has
18        to show that the conduct, what -- for example,
19        what Reynolds and Philip Morris did or said or
20        did not say or did not do was a but-for legal
21        cause of Mr. Piendle's smoking and lung cancer,
22        and I submit that she did not build that
23        bridge.
24             Now, the Engle jury that made these
25        generic findings that you have seen and that

 1        we're going to talk about, didn't know anything
 2        about Mr. Piendle.  They didn't know when he
 3        started smoking, they didn't know what he
 4        smoked, they didn't know why he smoked, they
 5        didn't know whether he quit, didn't know how he
 6        quit or what he knew about the health risks of
 7        smoking.  That's your job.  Your job is to look
 8        at this evidence and decide whether or not the
 9        plaintiff built the bridge.
10             Now, before we talk about each of the
11        individual findings, I want to talk a little
12        bit about Mr. Piendle and the choices he made,
13        because it would be easy for you to forget
14        during Mr. Barnhart's closing that this case is
15        all about Mr. Piendle. 16             You heard a lot of talk about statistics
17        and American public, but not a lot about
18        Mr. Piendle and not a lot related to the core
19        issue in this case, which is was that bridge
20        built.  So let me talk a little bit about
21        Mr. Piendle and the choices he made, and let's
22        make no mistake about it, they were choices.
23             Basically, three of them, although each of
24        them is multiple; the choice to start smoking,
25        the choice to become a regular smoker, the

 1        choice to continue smoking until 1989.
 2             Let's talk about each of those, just
 3        briefly.  The choice to start.  We don't know
 4        the precise date on which Mr. Piendle started
 5        smoking.  The earliest evidence that he first
 6        smoked came from Mr. Cabral, and he said that
 7        Mr. Piendle smoked when Mr. Piendle was in the
 8        eighth or ninth grade.  Remember, Mr. Cabral
 9        was one year behind him.
10             However, if you go look at the medical
11        records -- and you should do this.  They're in
12        evidence.  Plaintiff put up some excerpts.  And
13        let's see what Mr. Piendle told his doctors.
14        Smoking at age 16 to 48.  And that was the
15        legal age in Connecticut, when he was growing
16        up.  That would have put him at -- I don't
17        know -- freshman, sophomore year, probably
18        sophomore year of high school in 1957.
19             And one of the -- one of the exhibits
20        that -- I just pulled it out of the medical
21        records, was Plaintiff had all those two packs
22        a day references up here.  But if you go and
23        actually look at the medal records, and I urge
24        you to do this when you deliberate, you'll come
25        across this one which says, "Patient smoked one

 1        half pack per day."  Different things at
 2        different times.
 3             All right.  Everybody agrees that
 4        Mr. Piendle started smoking, and he
 5        experimented for social reasons.  His parents
 6        smoked.  You heard all about that.  His best
 7        friend, Mr. Cabral; his other best friend,
 8        Ms. Worobel smoked.  His other friend smoked.
 9        The older kids smoked.  He wanted to fit in.
10             There's no evidence, however, that he
11        started smoking because of tobacco advertising.
12        One of the brands that he smoked with
13        Mr. Cabral early on was Lucky Strikes, and
14        there was no evidence that Lucky Strikes'
15        advertising at the time Mr. Piendle smoked
16        Lucky Strikes in mid-1950s targeted kids.  You
17        saw this ad during my cross-examination of
18        Dr. Cummings.
19             And after he started smoking, Mr. Piendle
20        had another choice to make, and that was
21        whether to become a regular smoker.  It is a
22        choice that every smoker must make.  None of
23        Plaintiff's experts told you that Mr. Piendle
24        became addicted the day he smoked his first
25        cigarette, and there's certainly no evidence
6949 1        that anyone, including the defendants, forced
 2        him to continue.  He had the ability to decide
 3        whether or not he wanted to do that.
 4             You also heard that he smoked once in a
 5        while and socially in high school.  Dr. Burns
 6        testified, based upon his review of the
 7        materials in this case, that Mr. Piendle became
 8        a regular smoker somewhere between the age of
 9        16 and 25 between 1957 and 1966.
10             Now, you saw the textbooks approved for
11        use in the Connecticut schools that Dr. Norrell
12        showed you.  And I just want to take a little
13        detail here.  Plaintiffs kind of picked on
14        Dr. Norrell, noting how much he had been paid.
15        But he clearly does his homework.  You saw
16        boxes and boxes of reliance materials that were
17        just for this case.  The total he had been paid
18        represents the work he did over the course of
19        16 years.
20             While Dr. Norrell has testified in --
21        approximately 15 different times, that pales in
22        comparison to the amount of times that
23        plaintiff's experts have testified.
24             As I recall, and you can go back and
25        consult your notes, Dr. Burns has testified

 1        over 140 times; Dr. Cummings, I believe,
 2        testified over 50 times; and Dr. Benowitz, over
 3        30.
 4             But returning to Dr. Norrell, it's true,
 5        he couldn't put a specific textbook in
 6        Mr. Piendle's hands when he was in school, but
 7        he gave a powerful summary of the information
 8        that was available to Mr. Piendle when he was
 9        in high school.  Mr. Piendle, no doubt, had
10        heard on the news or read in the media stories
11        linking smoking to lung cancer, and we know
12        that by the time Mr. Piendle was in high
13        school, he was calling his cigarettes cancer
14        sticks and coffin nails.
15             Now, Plaintiff had Mr. Edward Piendle
16        testify that coffin nails was used because
17        cigarettes looked like a nail, not because they
18        had any association with death.  It was as if
19        the coffin part was accidental.  Then they had
20        Mr. Cabral come in, and he talked about cancer
21        sticks.  And he said, nah, it was just a
22        nickname without any meaning.  It was as if
23        they call cigarettes Sam.
24             And one of your questions followed up on
25        that and asked Mr. Cabral, hey, Mr. Cabral, did

 1        you ever discuss with Mr. Piendle cancer
 2        sticks?  And you know what, you really didn't
 3        get a straight answer from Mr. Cabral.
 4             They had Dr. Burns come in and talk about
 5        the use of slang expressions.  Remember, the
 6        coronary on a stick, which was the deep-fried
 7        butter that they served at the San Diego County
 8        Fair.  We talked about that.
 9             And Dr. Burns said the phrase did not
10        communicate a risk to heart health that was
11        internalized by the very people who were taking 12        the coronary on a stick and shoving it into
13        their mouths and using that phrase.
14             Really, guys?  Use your common sense.  Is
15        any of this credible, particularly against the
16        background, the backdrop of the broader
17        information and environment that was described
18        you by Dr. Norrell?
19             Moreover, there was zero evidence that
20        Mr. Piendle thought, hey, this will never
21        happen to me.  There was no evidence that he
22        had internalized what he plainly knew, smoking
23        causes lung cancer and death.  Even Plaintiff's
24        argument -- even plaintiff's argument that
25        Mr. Piendle didn't think it would happen to

 1        him, admits an understanding of what "it" was,
 2        and "it" was smoking causes illness.
 3             There's some additional points to keep in
 4        mind.  Statistically, it's true, 85 to
 5        90 percent of lifelong smokers don't get lung
 6        cancer.  That's the debate.  You heard that.
 7        Listen to the Court's instructions and review
 8        them back in the jury room.  You won't find any
 9        instructions that the defendant's had a legal
10        obligation to convince every single individual
11        smoker in the United States to internalize the
12        information that they already had.
13             What could the tobacco industry or these
14        defendants have done to convince Mr. Piendle
15        personally to apply what he already knew,
16        smoking causes cancer and death, to himself,
17        specifically?  And is there any evidence in
18        this case that his reaction would have been any
19        different than it was decades later when his
20        daughter came to him and said, Dad, smoking
21        causes lung cancer, showed him the warning on
22        the back, and he shooed her away.
23             Would his reaction have been any different
24        when his best friend, at least one of his best
25        friends, Lucille Worobel, came up to him and

 1        urged him to quit smoking and he said, I know,
 2        I know?  Or would it have been any different
 3        than his response likely was to his doctors?
 4        There's no evidence of that.
 5             You know, and even Dr. Burns --
 6             If I could have the demonstrative, please,
 7        26.
 8             -- even Dr. Burns basically says, I have
 9        every expectation that Mr. Piendle was aware of
10        information that indicated that smoking was bad
11        for him.  Dr. Benowitz admitted that even
12        today, even today, with all of the information
13        and understanding that we all have about
14        cigarette smoking, there will be people who
15        start smoking.  Some of them will be kids, some
16        of them won't be, but people still start.
17             There was no evidence from anybody that
18        Mr. Piendle decided to become a regular smoker
19        out of ignorance that smoking causes cancer and
20        death.  It just wasn't there.  There was no
21        evidence that he chose to become a regular
22        smoker because of cigarette advertising.  There 23        was no evidence that he chose to become a
24        regular smoker because of any statement from
25        R.J. Reynolds, from Philip Morris, The Tobacco

 1        Institute, or anybody else associated with the
 2        tobacco industry, much less that he relied upon
 3        it.  There was no testimony to that effect.
 4             Okay.  Let me talk about his last choice,
 5        and that was the choice to continue smoking.
 6        It was a choice that he made multiple times,
 7        each day, for years.  The choice to take the
 8        next cigarette out of the pack, to light it,
 9        and to continue smoking, instead of at least
10        trying to quit.
11             You heard all the experts say that just
12        because somebody might be addicted doesn't mean
13        that they can quit smoking.  Everybody can quit
14        smoking.  There's not really a serious dispute
15        about that in this case.  Quitting is a
16        question of motivation and commitment, even if
17        it takes more than one try.
18             So let's talk about the 1960s and the
19        choice to continue smoking then.  In the 1960s,
20        as you know, the 1964 Surgeon General's report
21        came out.  There were warnings on every pack of
22        cigarettes starting in 1966, "Caution:
23        Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your
24        health."
25             And Mrs. Piendle testified she was sure

 1        that Mr. Piendle saw that warning.  She was
 2        sure about it.  And Mr. Piendle ignored the
 3        information that was available to him about the
 4        health risks and addictiveness of smoking in
 5        the 1960s.
 6             And why do I say "ignore"?  Because
 7        there's no evidence he even tried to quit once
 8        during that entire decade.
 9             Let's talk about the 1970s and '80s.  In
10        the 1970s and '80s, Mr. Piendle continued to
11        smoke, despite the Surgeon General's warnings
12        on every pack, and the warnings were in -- in
13        every advertisement, every ad starting in 1972.
14        These are warnings, 1970, 1985, "Surgeon
15        General has determined that smoking is
16        dangerous to your health."
17             And then from 1985 to the present, these
18        rotating warnings, specific warnings about lung
19        cancer, specific warnings that say, "If you
20        quit smoking, it greatly reduces risk to your
21        health."  And the Court has instructed you that
22        there is no dispute in this case that
23        defendants put that warning on every one of
24        their packs starting in 1966, all the way
25        through to the present.

 1             Now -- and as I said, Tracy Piendle
 2        testified she showed her dad those warnings
 3        when she was -- when she was at home and a
 4        young girl and told him cigarettes cause
 5        cancer.  Again, he shooed her away.
 6             And Mrs. Piendle said, you know, if there
 7        was any doubt in my mind that Mr. Piendle 8        hadn't read the warning or that Mr. Piendle
 9        didn't believe that smoking was dangerous to
10        health, she would have told him, but she never
11        did, because she didn't have that doubt.  He
12        knew.  All of the evidence shows that he knew
13        in the 1970s and '80s.
14             And what is Plaintiff's response?  What is
15        Plaintiff's response?  It's to ignore all the
16        specific information that we know about
17        Mr. Piendle, the individual.  It is to lump him
18        into a statistical age cohort and to argue that
19        he must have liked -- he must have acted like
20        average people his age, or to talk about -- I
21        wrote the phrase down.  I can barely read my
22        writing.  But I think Mr. Barnhart used the
23        phrase "subconscious reliance."  I don't even
24        know what that is. "Subconscious reliance."
25        And neither of those attempts work.

 1             When Mr. Piendle started smoking, he was
 2        among the 35 to 40 percent of age cohorts who,
 3        based on the Adult Use of Tobacco Survey that
 4        you heard about, that began smoking before he
 5        turned 18, not the 70 percent that Dr. Cummings
 6        tried to claim.
 7             Mr. Piendle really wasn't an average man.
 8        He was the star athlete in high school, and
 9        then starting in early adulthood, he suffered
10        from debilitating Crohn's disease and then
11        later on arthritis, hearing loss, dizziness,
12        and so forth.  He wasn't average in his brand
13        loyalty or his brand selections.  After all,
14        Mrs. Piendle largely chose the brands that they
15        smoked.
16             And statistics can't really prove the
17        facts in this case related to Mr. Piendle.  And
18        I think there's a very telling example.  If
19        statistics decided this case, Mr. Piendle never
20        got lung cancer.  After all, as I said before,
21        the evidence said that 85 to 90 percent of
22        smokers don't get lung cancer.  If you want to
23        decided the case on statistics, let's go home
24        right now, because he never had lung cancer.
25             In short, specific evidence about

 1        Mr. Piendle, not data from age cohorts or
 2        anything else, should carry more weight when
 3        you go back into that jury room and start
 4        deliberating than anything about age cohorts,
 5        anything about subconscious reliance.  Look at
 6        the facts that relate to Mr. Piendle.  This
 7        case is for him.  It is about him.  It is about
 8        him.
 9             Okay.  Now, I want to talk about the
10        specific findings that you are to apply.  I
11        want to discuss the burden Plaintiff has to
12        show about legal cause as to each and every one
13        of them.  I want to talk about whether they
14        built that bridge.  I want to start with
15        design.
16             If I could have the next slide, please.
17             Okay.  Here's the finding on design.
18        Defendants R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and 19        Philip Morris USA, Inc., placed cigarettes on
20        the market that were defective and unreasonably
21        dangerous, and, you know what, that finding
22        doesn't help you very much.  Let me tell you
23        why.
24             It doesn't say what the defect was.  It
25        doesn't say that any of the brands that

 1        Mr. Piendle specifically smoked were defective
 2        at all.  It doesn't say when the defendants
 3        placed defective cigarettes on the market.
 4             And if I could have the next
 5        demonstrative.
 6             And as her Honor has instructed, and you
 7        will see in the instructions that you have with
 8        you, the findings establish only what they
 9        expressly state.  You may not speculate -- you
10        must not speculate or guess as to the basis of
11        findings.
12             Now, you heard repeatedly during the
13        course of this trial there's no such thing as a
14        safe cigarette, and I'm certainly not about to
15        tell you otherwise.  There's also not a single
16        conventional cigarette that burns tobacco that
17        isn't capable of causing lung cancer.  They all
18        can.
19             But what is the evidence that Plaintiff
20        produced that showed that the Reynolds and the
21        Philip Morris cigarettes that Mr. Piendle
22        smoked had a defect that was a legal but-for
23        cause of his death?
24             Well, first, they got Dr. Cummings to come
25        in, and he said, you know, the only cigarettes

 1        that were reasonable to market were those that
 2        were nicotine free.  But there were
 3        nicotine-free cigarettes on the market,
 4        including brands manufactured by Philip Morris.
 5        The Next brand, the Benson and Hedges DeNic.
 6             And as the Surgeon General observed in
 7        1964, and several witnesses testified, next to
 8        nobody bought the Philip Morris denicotinized
 9        cigarettes or any other cigarette that didn't
10        have nicotine.
11             And here is the important part:  There is
12        no evidence whatever that Mr. Piendle would
13        have avoided his lung cancer if only the
14        defendants in this case made nicotine-free
15        cigarettes.  Philip Morris did, other companies
16        did, too, and Mr. Piendle didn't smoke them
17        ever.  Ever.
18             Let's say that Reynolds and Philip Morris
19        had made only nicotine-free cigarettes, the
20        only cigarettes they made.  What then?  Does
21        anybody here seriously doubt that Mr. Piendle
22        would have gone and smoked cigarettes with
23        nicotine made by a competitor?
24             As Dr. Figlar testified, cigarettes with
25        nicotine all have the potential to addict.  But

 1        they're legal products.  And defendants didn't
 2        have a legal obligation to go out of business,
 3        no matter how much that would have pleased 4        Dr. Cummings, the general in the war on
 5        tobacco, and the only witness who came before
 6        you and testified that cigarettes should be
 7        banned, the only one.
 8             Well, next, Plaintiff had Dr. Cummings say
 9        that Defendants alternatively should not have
10        made any conventional cigarettes at all, and
11        instead, they should have made pure
12        nicotine-delivery devices, something that
13        delivers only nicotine and nothing else.  But
14        again, conventional cigarettes --
15             Excuse me, let me get some water.
16             -- conventional cigarettes are legal, and
17        Mr. Piendle never used any of the pure nicotine
18        alternatives that were available to him, such
19        as nicotine gum, even when he was trying to
20        quit, and I think there is absolutely no
21        evidence to support the notion that if there
22        had been pure nicotine things on the market, he
23        would have used them as a long term means to
24        get nicotine.  I don't think he would have done
25        that and I don't think there's any evidence to

 1        support that.
 2             And when Reynolds did invent the cigarette
 3        that heated instead of burned tobacco, yielding
 4        nicotine, but none of the conventional tar, the
 5        Food and Drug Administration threatened to make
 6        it available only by prescription, and there's
 7        been no evidence that Mr. Piendle would have
 8        bought that product either, that was starting
 9        in 1988.
10             So that leaves us with the conventional
11        cigarettes, and they are inherently dangerous.
12        No one disputes that.  And they are and always
13        have been legal products.
14             The evidence is that starting in the 1950s
15        and continuing all the way through 1989 when
16        Mr. Piendle quit and beyond, the public health
17        community encouraged smokers to switch from
18        higher to lower tar in nicotine cigarettes and
19        encouraged cigarette manufacturers, like
20        Reynolds, to make them, and Reynolds and Philip
21        Morris responded.
22             As Dr. Figlar demonstrated graphically,
23        literally with his demonstratives, they
24        steadily lowered the tar and nicotine yield of
25        their existing products and they made new

 1        products available as the technology approved,
 2        such as the 1 milligram Carlton and Now
 3        cigarettes.
 4             Did they have the capacity to make a
 5        1 milligram tar cigarette from 1950?  Sure.
 6        You could have put on a super-duper filter, but
 7        nobody would have bought it.  The trick was
 8        with these incremental designs improvements
 9        over time.  They tried to make a 1 milligram
10        tar cigarette that would be acceptable to
11        smokers.  Because if you make even a safe
12        cigarette, which is impossible, but if you make
13        even a safe cigarette and nobody buys it, you
14        really haven't done any good. 15             And I have to respond to what was said by
16        Mr. Barnhart, that Dr. Figlar said that all
17        cigarettes were equally risky.  He never said
18        that, he never said that.  In fact, he
19        specifically was asked, do you think it's a
20        good idea to have throwback cigarettes that go
21        back to the 1950s without filters?  And he
22        said, no, I certainly wouldn't recommend that.
23             And if you'll remember Dr. Benowitz, when
24        he was on the stand, testified that the
25        ultralow-tar cigarettes are, indeed, less

 1        hazardous.  Not safe, but less hazardous than
 2        the others.
 3             All right.  But Mr. and Mrs. Piendle
 4        bought their cigarettes based largely on taste
 5        and sometimes price, but not safety.  And the
 6        testimony has been that they never smoked, as
 7        their regular brand, any of the lowest tar and
 8        nicotine cigarettes on the market, that the
 9        public health community was advising smokers to
10        smoke and that the defendants made.  They never
11        even smoked the lowest tar and nicotine styles
12        of the regular brands they did smoke.  There
13        was no Winston Light or Winston Ultra Lights,
14        it was the regular Winston.  And Dr. Benowitz,
15        as I said, testified those Ultra Lights were
16        less hazardous.
17             There are also claims that the defendants
18        manipulated nicotine in order to keep smokers
19        hooked.  And there were three claims that were
20        made, and I just want to briefly touch on them,
21        I think they were all put to rest.
22             First, Dr. Cummings said the pH was
23        manipulated to increase free nicotine in
24        cigarette smoke.  Dr. Figlar came in and he
25        presented data to you about the pH of cigarette

 1        smoke from Reynolds' products specifically and
 2        commercial products generally, and it was
 3        always below that 6.5 pH level.
 4             Below that level, the
 5        Henderson-Hasselbalch curve, remember that
 6        curve that you saw on a demonstrative from the
 7        Surgeon General's report, that Dr. Cummings
 8        couldn't identify even when I told him the
 9        name, that curve showed that there's little or
10        no free nicotine in cigarette smoke below the
11        6.5 pH, and all of the cigarettes were below
12        it.
13             In any event, in any event, even if there
14        were some evidence that the smoke pH had
15        increased, which there was not, which there was
16        not, Dr. Cummings testified on
17        cross-examination that it is only a theory that
18        increasing smoke pH increases addictiveness.
19             Second, you heard Dr. Cummings talk about
20        tar to nicotine ratios.  What he admitted on
21        cross, on cross-examination, and as Dr. Figlar
22        testified, that altering tar to nicotine ratios
23        was something that was first proposed by the
24        public health community, including Dr. Russell
25        in the United Kingdom and the National Cancer 6966
 1        Institute's less hazardous cigarette program,
 2        and it was proposed as a way to potentially
 3        develop a safer cigarette.
 4             And the idea was -- remember, it's the tar
 5        in cigarettes that cause disease.  So if you
 6        could increase nicotine relative to tar, you
 7        would allow smokers to smoke for nicotine and
 8        get less tar and presumably less risk.
 9             And as Dr. Figlar testified, Reynolds at
10        least tried, for many years in the laboratory,
11        to work on this idea, but it never incorporated
12        the idea into commercial cigarettes because the
13        smoke was out of balance, it was too harsh, and
14        consumers wouldn't accept it.
15             Third, Dr. Cummings testified that
16        reconstituted tobacco was utilized to control
17        nicotine dosing.
18             Gosh, as Dr. Figlar explained,
19        reconstituted tobacco was developed and used in
20        commercial cigarettes for three reasons:  One,
21        you could use the whole tobacco plant, you save
22        some money.  Two, reconstituted tobacco
23        delivers less tar and less nicotine than the
24        regular leaf does.  And three, the smoke from
25        reconstituted tobacco, as tested by the

 1        National Cancer Institute and the less
 2        hazardous cigarette program, gives you less
 3        tumors on the backs of mice than smoke that
 4        comes from leaves.  Those were the reasons, and
 5        Dr. Figlar emphatically said reconstituted
 6        tobacco sheath is not used to control nicotine
 7        dosing.
 8             Dr. Burns came in and talked about dark
 9        tobacco, and said, gosh, dark tobacco as used
10        in cigars and pipe tobacco might be safer than
11        the American blend, but then there were two
12        important points made on the cross-examination
13        by Mr. Kelly; the first was that the scientific
14        evidence shows that cigarettes, not cigars, not
15        pipes, but cigarettes made with the dark
16        tobacco are more dangerous than those made from
17        the American blend.  And second, Dr. Burns knew
18        this all along, even while he testified
19        otherwise on direct.
20             You know, one of the things that I found
21        curious, and I actually didn't make a note of
22        this before today, but plaintiffs actually put
23        up again that document from the 1950s that
24        somebody at Reynolds proposed putting something
25        in filters to make them change colors when they

 1        smoked so that people could see it, and from
 2        the get-go, everybody has said that that was an
 3        idea that was never pursued.
 4             So why do we keep seeing it?  I mean, am I
 5        going to tell you that every memo that any
 6        R.J. Reynolds' employee ever wrote, and there's
 7        been thousands of them over the years, there's
 8        60 million documents, was a good idea?  No, of
 9        course not.  Some of those ideas were stupid,
10        that was one of them.  But they keep showing it 11        even though they know it was never done, it was
12        never done.
13             All right.  So where is the proof that the
14        cigarettes that Mr. Piendle smoked as his
15        regular brands had a defect, something the
16        defendants could have fixed as opposed to being
17        inherent risks to the product that was a
18        but-for or a legal cause of Mr. Piendle's lung
19        cancer?
20             I submit there wasn't any.  Tobacco
21        products are dangerous by nature, not by
22        design, and, indeed, the defendants' design
23        efforts, as described to you at some length by
24        Dr. Figlar, were all aimed at reducing the
25        risks of smoking.  It's a hard thing to do, you

 1        can't make it safe, but that was the objective.
 2             There was something curious that
 3        Mr. Barnhart, I thought I heard, maybe I
 4        misheard it, but I thought he said that all the
 5        design modifications were enforced by law.  I
 6        don't know of a single design modification that
 7        was enforced by law on cigarettes.  Reynolds,
 8        Philip Morris, the other cigarette
 9        manufacturers all went about this following the
10        suggestions of the public health community, not
11        because they were compelled to do so, but
12        because they wanted to reduce the risks.
13             Think about it, why would a company that
14        makes consumer products want to kill the
15        consumers?  That's just nutty.  The objective
16        was to reduce risk.
17             All right.  Let's go the next finding.
18        Negligence.  Defendants' R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
19        Company and Philip Morris USA, Inc., were
20        negligent, that's what the finding says.
21        Again, I don't think it helps you very much.
22        You can't go beyond it, you can't speculate as
23        to what it means, the Court has told you that,
24        and it doesn't tell you what the defendants did
25        that was negligent.  It doesn't tell you when

 1        the negligent act or acts occurred.  And what
 2        was plaintiff's proof that any negligent act by
 3        R.J. Reynolds or Philip Morris was a legal
 4        but-for cause of Mr. Piendle's lung cancer and
 5        death?
 6             Well, plaintiff talked a lot about
 7        advertising and even made claims that the
 8        defendants were targeting marketing at
 9        Mr. Piendle when he was an adolescent.
10             But let's pull up the Court's instruction.
11        And this is what the jury instructions say, in
12        part, on advertising.  You may not find
13        liability based on the mere fact that the
14        defendants have advertised their product.  You
15        may not hold the defendants liable because of
16        who may have found their cigarette advertising
17        or promotion to be appealing no matter how sexy
18        or glamorous or anything else.  The only way
19        they get there is false, misleading, or
20        deceitful statements in advertising.
21             Let's talk about that.  Plaintiff had 22        Dr. Cummings come in and testify that tobacco
23        ads were false and misleading because they
24        don't show sick or dead smokers, and that's
25        nonsense.  Advertising that shows happy and

 1        attractive people is not false or misleading or
 2        deceitful.
 3             Plaintiff claimed that the early filters
 4        didn't filter very much, but the 1950's data
 5        from the page of the exhibit that Mr. Scarola
 6        didn't give to Dr. Figlar when he was on
 7        cross-examination, but that I gave to him on
 8        redirect, as well as Dr. Figlar's
 9        apples-to-apples analysis of tar and nicotine
10        yields over time show that improvements were
11        made to the early filters very rapidly.  I
12        could stop right here.  Advertising cannot be a
13        basis of liability in this case.  But I'm not
14        going to.
15             Plaintiff claimed repeatedly that the
16        defendants marketed to youth, you've seen some
17        of those documents, and no matter what you
18        thought when you came in here for jury service,
19        no matter what you thought before you got here,
20        you have to put it aside and focus on the
21        evidence.  So let's talk about what that
22        evidence was.
23             Okay.  The first exhibit that you've seen
24        a couple of times was this 1984 memo from Diane
25        Burrows of my client, R.J. Reynolds, and it

 1        talks about younger adult smokers.  And the
 2        phrase "younger adult smokers" appears in this
 3        memo about 200 times, and every single time
 4        that it is defined, it isn't always, but every
 5        single time it's defined, it's defined as age
 6        18 to 24, 18 to 24.
 7             Dr. Cummings was undeferred by that fact,
 8        and he would have you believe that the document
 9        was all about targeting youth because it
10        included, as an appendix, a table from the U.S.
11        Government survey of adults over the age 21,
12        the very same Adult Use of Tobacco Survey that
13        you've seen a couple of times during the course
14        of this trial and that Dr. Riddel testified
15        about in which adults were asked when they
16        started to smoke.  That's it.
17             The next document.
18             This was Dr. Teague's thoughts on brands
19        for the youth market.  It was made -- it was
20        authored in 1973, Mr. Piendle was 32, it was
21        written by Dr. Teague, who did not design
22        cigarettes, who was not in the marketing
23        department, and who you found out only in the
24        defense case begins this very memo by saying,
25        "At the outset, it should be said that we are

 1        presently, and I believe unfairly, constrained
 2        from directly promoting cigarettes to the youth
 3        market, that is to those in the approximately
 4        21-year-old and under age group."
 5             So the memo starts out by recognizing that
 6        what he's proposing is against the company's 7        policy.  As you also heard from Dr. Figlar,
 8        there's no evidence that Dr. Teague's proposal,
 9        which was against the company's policy at the
10        time, was ever acted upon.
11             Finally, we have this document from
12        Dr. Colby, it too was written in 1973 when
13        Mr. Piendle -- excuse me, '71 -- '73 when
14        Mr. Piendle was 32.  There, again, you heard
15        from Dr. Figlar, based upon his review not only
16        of the internal research and development
17        documents, but also on its products that this
18        was ever followed up on.  No throwback
19        cigarettes in the 1950s.  In fact, you can see
20        that in the tar and nicotine yield data you
21        saw.
22             And if the defendants were marketing their
23        products to underage smokers, where are the
24        marketing plans identifying underage smokers as
25        a target?  Where are the focus group tests that

 1        would have been done with the product or with
 2        the ads?  I mean, do you think the companies
 3        put out ads in a product without ever testing
 4        it on the target market?  Where was that
 5        evidence?  You didn't see it.  You didn't see
 6        it.
 7             All right.  Dr. Cummings and Mr. Barnhart,
 8        too, spiced it up in playing Winston ads that
 9        ran during the Flintstones TV show.
10        Mr. Scarola, as you recall, didn't ask
11        Mr. Cummings about the ad, he just played it.
12        And you had to wait for my cross-examination of
13        Dr. Cummings, when he admitted, he admitted
14        that when those advertisements ran, Mr. Piendle
15        was an adult and the Flintstones was an adult
16        comedy, it was modeled on The Honeymooners.
17             Mr. Barnhart, I think, misspoke during his
18        closing earlier today when he said it was a kid
19        show.  It was not, it was an adult comedy that
20        ran at 8:30 at night.  And when the Flintstones
21        did move to Saturday mornings, Reynolds dropped
22        its sponsorship.  You also heard today and
23        again during trial ads from R.J. Reynolds
24        advertising Winston on the Beverly Hillbillies.
25        But again, Dr. Cummings, on direct examination,

 1        didn't share with you the fact that Reynolds
 2        dropped its sponsorship of the Beverly
 3        Hillbillies in 1967 when Mr. Piendle was 26,
 4        after audience survey show that high levels of
 5        minors were watching the show, and he only
 6        admitted that on cross.
 7             Reynolds, moreover, stopped advertising
 8        Winston on that show two years before
 9        Mr. Piendle even started smoking Winstons in
10        1969 at age 28, and the only reason he started
11        smoking Winstons was because Mrs. Piendle got
12        him to do it.  Okay.  That was her brand.
13             Finally, and you saw this again today,
14        Dr. Cummings talked in his -- in my
15        cross-examination about creating controversy,
16        and one of the controversies he created were
17        the 1990 letters to the Willis Elementary 18        School principal where Dr. Cummings, remember,
19        went in and lectured to the students, talked to
20        them about trademark violations, talked to them
21        about the tobacco industry's position, got them
22        to write letters, and Reynolds responded.
23             Was that a really smart thing to do?
24        Yeah.  What does it have to do with
25        Mr. Piendle?  I mean, it really wasn't.

 1             Where was the evidence that any of the
 2        cigarettes that Mr. Piendle smoked before 1957
 3        when he was 16, remember that was the legal age
 4        to smoke in Connecticut at the time, were
 5        marketed to youth?  There wasn't any.  None.
 6             Moreover, where was the evidence that
 7        Mr. Piendle smoked because of any ad?
 8        Dr. Cummings, of course, came in here and
 9        testified about the ubiquitous influence of
10        marketing on Mr. Piendle's age cohort.  And he
11        really didn't have a good answer from one of
12        you about the influences on Mr. Piendle's age
13        cohort that didn't decide to smoke, didn't
14        really answer that question.  Of course,
15        everybody is exposed to advertising.
16        Advertising doesn't explain why somebody starts
17        or doesn't start smoking.
18             And then Dr. Cummings had little or
19        nothing to say about Mr. Piendle as an
20        individual.  I specifically asked him on
21        cross-examination if he could identify any
22        specific advertisement that Mr. Piendle saw,
23        read, or heard.  Answer, no.  Nor could he
24        identify any advertising that Mr. Piendle
25        relied on in deciding to continue to smoke.

 1        Nobody did.  Nobody testified that Mr. Piendle
 2        started or continued to smoke because of any
 3        cigarette ad.  To the contrary, let's look at
 4        what people actually had to say about
 5        Mr. Piendle.
 6             His brother, Mr. Edward Piendle, didn't
 7        think his brother relied on anything in
 8        particular when he decided to start smoking or
 9        to continue smoking.  Lucille Worobel never
10        paid much attention to cigarette commercials in
11        the 1980s.  Mr. Cabral, Mr. Piendle didn't make
12        his decisions about smoking because of the
13        Marlboro Man.  Nobody said ads were important
14        to him.  And, indeed, if Mr. Cabral -- if
15        Mr. Piendle experimented with smoking because
16        of the Marlboro billboard, why did he
17        experiment with Lucky Strikes or Pall Mall
18        instead of Marlboro?
19             Now, there's Mrs. Piendle.  She testified
20        she didn't know why Mr. Piendle smoked Marlboro
21        cigarettes.  She admitted that Mr. Piendle
22        never mentioned any specific advertisement for
23        any cigarette ad and she testified that
24        Mr. Piendle never blamed his lung cancer on a
25        cigarette advertising.

 1             And ask yourselves this, if Mr. Piendle
 2        was a hapless victim of advertising, as 3        plaintiff's would apparently have you believe,
 4        what was he doing smoking a woman's cigarette,
 5        like Virginia Slims?  If advertising was so
 6        important to him, wouldn't that have rubbed
 7        against the grain?
 8             All right.  Plaintiff also displayed A
 9        Frank Statement, and we're still on negligence,
10        and they talk about cooperation with the public
11        health authorities, and they pointed to the
12        statement where the tobacco industry said, we
13        always have and always will cooperate with
14        basically the guardians of public health.
15             And I'll talk about the not proven
16        statements later when we get concealment, I
17        want to spend some time on that.  But there's
18        been no evidence that Mr. Piendle ever saw the
19        Frank Statement.
20             I want to talk about how many newspapers
21        that ran --
22             THE CLERK:  Counselor, one hour.
23             MR. BIERSTEKER:  One hour.  Goodness
24        gracious, I'm going to have to talk faster.
25             They talked about all the newspapers it

 1        appeared in, but it ran for one day and one day
 2        only, on January 1st, 1954, when Mr. Piendle
 3        was 13 years old, and there was no evidence
 4        that any of his smoking decisions were based on
 5        anything in the Frank Statement or on any
 6        cooperation or lack of cooperation with the
 7        public health authorities.
 8             And I've got more I'd like to say, but let
 9        me just skip to the bottom line.  There was
10        plenty of evidence that apart from the not
11        proven statements, let's put those aside and
12        we'll deal with them later, apart from the not
13        proven and not addictive statements that the
14        tobacco industry cooperated with public health
15        authorities.  They cooperated in important
16        ways.  They cooperated in the design of their
17        cigarettes, both in response to the suggestions
18        of the public health community and as part of
19        the National Cancer Institute's Less Hazardous
20        Cigarette Program.  They cooperated by
21        publishing research and making presentations at
22        scientific meetings.  They cooperated by
23        funding independent scientific research through
24        CTR grants.
25             Remember when Dr. Cummings was on the

 1        stand, I think it was Dr. Cummings, talking
 2        about the Nobel Prize Laureate -- Nobel
 3        Laureates would receive grant funding and were
 4        free to publish in peer-reviewed literature,
 5        talked about the thousands of articles that
 6        appeared, talked about how hundreds of them
 7        have been cited in the Surgeon General's
 8        reports.
 9             So let's turn to concealment.  There are
10        two findings, they're long, I'm not going to
11        read them to you, but I'll show them on the
12        screen.  There is the first one, concealment,
13        and the next one, agreed to conceal. 14             Now, during this trial, plaintiff
15        cherrypicked from the 60 million pages or so of
16        internal tobacco industry documents that are
17        publicly available, documents from the
18        defendants, from other tobacco companies,
19        documents from The Tobacco Institute and
20        Council for Tobacco Research, neither which
21        exist anymore, and they called experts to come
22        in and testify about them.  And Mr. Barnhart
23        spent a fair amount of time on concealment in
24        his closing, that's about all he talked about.
25             It's critically important for you to keep

 1        in mind that this case is still about
 2        Mr. Piendle.  Remember, that's why we're here.
 3        And that means you must determine what all of
 4        those documents had to do with Mr. Piendle's
 5        choices about smoking, where is the bridge?
 6        Where is the bridge?
 7             The Court has instructed you on the law as
 8        it relates to that question.  The Court has
 9        instructed you that the law requires that
10        plaintiff prove that Mr. Piendle relied, to his
11        detriment, on a failure to disclose in a
12        statement the information that the plaintiff
13        argues was concealed and not otherwise known.
14        Plaintiff has the burden to show all of that,
15        that the concealment of that information also
16        was a legal cause of Mr. Piendle's death and
17        lung cancer, and that's a tall order, it's a
18        tall order.
19             Ask yourselves this, I said this in
20        opening and I'll say it again:  Does it make
21        any sense to say that what Mr. Piendle already
22        knew about the health risks of smoking, going
23        all the way back to high school, cancer sticks
24        and coffin nails, didn't matter, the warnings
25        didn't matter to him.  What he must have read

 1        in newspapers and seen on TV from the public
 2        health authorities, that didn't matter.  What
 3        the Surgeon General said didn't matter.  What
 4        his friends and family said didn't matter.  But
 5        it would have made all the difference in the
 6        world if Reynolds or Philip Morris had said,
 7        hey, Mr. Piendle, you've got a 10 to 15 percent
 8        chance of dying from lung cancer if you smoke
 9        for a long time.  Does that make any sense?
10             Does it make any sense that the tobacco
11        industry's denials that nicotine was addictive,
12        which occurred in 1988, that's when the Surgeon
13        General changed the definition, we're going to
14        talk about that, in 1988, not before, that
15        those denials had anything to do with
16        Mr. Piendle's lung cancer?  No, there's no
17        bridge.
18             All right.  Let's talk about the internal
19        documents that relate to the question of
20        addiction.  And I'm not going to go through all
21        the documents, I can't, I'm running out of time
22        as it is.  What I want to do instead is I want
23        to review the evidence that will enable you to
24        evaluate those documents when you deliberate, 25        and then I want to talk about one example, and

 1        it's an example that plaintiff's focused on
 2        repeatedly.  And there are five basic points I
 3        want to talk about.
 4             Next slide, please, Will.
 5             It's long been known it's hard to quit.
 6        Dr. Burns told you that it's long been known
 7        that it's hard to quit, it goes back to the
 8        days of Columbus.  Dr. Cummings told you that
 9        once somebody starts smoking, it's been
10        well-known to the public, not just scientists,
11        that it could be hard to quit even before
12        Mr. Piendle started smoking in the 1950s.
13        Dr. Norrell testified about the use of slang,
14        he talked about songs, he talked about school
15        textbooks, all this drove home the point that
16        once you start, it can be hard to the general
17        public.
18             And remember that plaintiff introduced no
19        evidence at all that the defendants in this
20        case ever denied that fact, it can be hard to
21        quit.  Dr. Cummings tried.  He said that one
22        industry document said otherwise.  I can tell
23        you right now, it was Plaintiff's Exhibit 2510,
24        it was the press release that was issued in
25        connection with the 1988 Surgeon General's

 1        report.  And when you go back and deliberate,
 2        review it, read it, it makes factually correct
 3        observations, millions of folks have quit,
 4        95 percent without any assistance and so forth.
 5             But as they used to say in the Dutch dairy
 6        farming community, I grew up in Wisconsin, you
 7        can read that document until the cows come home
 8        and you will never find a statement denying
 9        that it can be hard to quit, it's just not
10        there.
11             In fact, the only person who said at this
12        trial that it can be easy to quit was
13        Dr. Cummings in his Smart Moves brochure that
14        we asked him about during his examination.  And
15        remember Dr. Riddel, she showed you the data
16        from the government's Adult Use of Tobacco
17        Surveys that show that two-thirds of male
18        former smokers --
19             We have the slide, Will?
20             Yeah, two thirds of male former smokers
21        reported, you add up these two numbers, it's
22        about two-thirds, said it was fairly or very
23        easy to quit, but the point is and remains, it
24        was no secret that smoking can be hard to quit.
25             Second, second point I want you to keep in

 1        mind when you look at these documents.  Second
 2        point is, as Dr. Cummings testified, people
 3        tend to use the word "addiction," "dependence,"
 4        "habit," and "habituation" interchangeably.
 5        Even Dr. Cummings, a Ph.D. scientist, admits
 6        that he did just that.  So it should not be
 7        surprising when you go through millions, tens
 8        of millions of pages of internal company
 9        documents, you will be able to find examples 10        where the author used the word "addiction" or
11        "addictive," but that doesn't mean that the
12        author meant anything other than it's hard to
13        quit or that the author knew something
14        different than everyone else.
15             Third point, Dr. Benowitz.  Dr. Benowitz
16        told you that scientists have long known about
17        the pharmacological properties of nicotine,
18        including on the central nervous system.  It's
19        something that has been studied since the early
20        1900s, for decades before Mr. Piendle started
21        to smoke.  In fact, as you will recall, the
22        tobacco industry collected and summarized
23        publications on the effects of nicotine on the
24        body and the Green Monster, and that was one of
25        the books that was used to help prepare the

 1        1964 Surgeon General's report.  And there's
 2        been no evidence that defendants ever denied
 3        that nicotine has effects on the brain.  Again,
 4        not a secret that nicotine has pharmacological
 5        effects, including on the brain and, indeed, it
 6        was discussed in the 1964 Surgeon General's
 7        report.
 8             The fourth point to keep in mind as you
 9        look at the documents, it has long been known
10        that tobacco contains nicotine and that people
11        smoke for nicotine, long been known.  And, in
12        fact, Dr. Benowitz told you that scientists and
13        the public at large have known for over 100
14        years that tobacco has nicotine in it.  And as
15        the 1964 Surgeon General's report observed,
16        nobody smoked cigarettes that don't have
17        nicotine, commonly known, not a secret.
18             Fifth, I want to talk about this.  The
19        whole dispute about whether to label nicotine
20        and addiction as opposed to a habit was about
21        definitions and labels.  As Dr. Benowitz
22        admitted, it came about when the Surgeon
23        General adopted a different definition of
24        addiction in 1988, a year before Mr. Piendle
25        quit.  The definition had changed.  No longer

 1        was there a need for intoxication, no longer
 2        was there a need for severe or life-threatening
 3        withdrawal, and then they also dropped the
 4        requirement for antisocial behavior and, voila,
 5        smoking and even caffeine became an addiction
 6        just like heroin and alcohol.  It wasn't a
 7        change in science, Dr. Benowitz told you this.
 8             Put up the next slide.
 9             Okay.  He said, basically, under the 1964
10        Surgeon General's definition, if you apply it
11        to what science knows today, today, about
12        nicotine and smoking, smoking is still a habit.
13        And if you flip it around and you take the 1988
14        Surgeon General's report's definition and apply
15        it to what science knew back in 1964, smoking
16        would have been an addiction.  The tobacco
17        industry, including these defendants, were
18        unhappy about getting lumped together with
19        heroin and alcohol.  That's understandable, I
20        think. 21             So starting in 1988, the tobacco industry
22        publicly denied that smoking was addictive,
23        citing as my client did, even tried to do in
24        those 1994 Congressional hearings, the real
25        differences between nicotine and other drugs

 1        like heroin in terms of intoxication and
 2        withdrawal effects.
 3             But here is the main one, as Dr. Cummings
 4        admitted on cross-examination, the label
 5        doesn't really matter.  What matters is the
 6        behavior, and that never changed.
 7             Okay.  So I want you to keep those points
 8        in mind and I want to talk about just one
 9        document that you've seen several times now.
10        It was the document written in 1972 by
11        Dr. Teague and it concerned nicotine and
12        smoking.  The plaintiffs made it sound as if
13        Dr. Teague had secret information about
14        nicotine that was otherwise unknown.
15             I want you to take a close look at what
16        Dr. Teague said and when he said it, and
17        compare it to what was said in the 1964 Surgeon
18        General's report about the role of nicotine and
19        smoking.
20             Dr. Teague says, "Tobacco products
21        uniquely contain and deliver nicotine, a potent
22        drug with a variety of physiological effects."
23        1972.
24             Surgeon General, eight years earlier.  A
25        published document.  "The habitual use of

 1        tobacco was related primarily to psychological
 2        and social drives reinforced and perpetuated by
 3        the pharmacologic actions of nicotine on the
 4        central nervous system."
 5             And take a look at a 1942 paper by Lennox
 6        Johnston.  Johnston had the exact same theory
 7        30 years before Dr. Teague wrote his memo, his
 8        think piece.  Dr. Teague:  "Thus, tobacco is in
 9        essence a vehicle for delivery of nicotine,
10        designed to deliver the nicotine in a generally
11        acceptable and attractive form."
12             What did you learn about Dr. Johnston in
13        1942?  Smoking was essentially a means of
14        administering nicotine, just as opium is a
15        means of administering morphine.  1942, 30
16        years before Dr. Teague wrote his think piece.
17        And Dr. Johnston was far from the first to
18        write about the compulsive use of nicotine and
19        to draw the analogy to smoking opium.
20             Next slide.
21             This was the Surgeon General's report in
22        evidence in 1988.  As early as the 1920s and
23        '30s, some investigators were concluding that
24        nicotine was responsible for the compulsive use
25        of tobacco products.  That theory appeared not

 1        only in scientific publications, but in the
 2        popular press as well, long before Dr. Teague
 3        ever picked up his pen and wrote this paper.
 4             Next slide, please.
 5             Reader's Digest, 1938.  He wrestles with 6        his addiction.
 7             Okay.  Let's return to Mr. Piendle.
 8        That's our focus, that's where our attention
 9        belongs.  The earliest public statement by the
10        tobacco industry denying that smoking is
11        addictive that is in evidence in this case is
12        from 1988.  That's not surprising because
13        that's when the Surgeon General changed the
14        definition.
15             By that time, Mr. Piendle knew how easy or
16        hard it was for him to quit smoking personally
17        because of New Year's resolutions that he and
18        Mrs. Piendle made in '70s and '80s.
19             What difference, the tobacco industry
20        denying that smoking was addicting, what
21        difference would that have made to Mr. Piendle?
22        He already knew.  He already knew based on his
23        own personal experience trying to quit, and
24        there was zero evidence, zero evidence that
25        Mr. Piendle's choices about his smoking would

 1        have been different if only the tobacco
 2        industry had said, gosh, quitting smoking can
 3        be hard, which Mr. Piendle must have known, and
 4        there is no evidence that he never tried to
 5        change his behavior in 1964 when the Surgeon
 6        General said it was a habit, or that he tried
 7        to change his smoking behavior in 1988 when the
 8        Surgeon General said it was an addiction, no
 9        evidence of that whatsoever.
10             Let's turn to the last concealment issue,
11        the last bridge issue involving the findings,
12        and that's smoking and disease.  And I'm sorry,
13        it's getting late.  I'm trying to go as fast as
14        I can.
15             The last bridge issue, the not proven
16        statements relating to smoking and disease.
17        And I'd like to start again by setting a little
18        context, and after that you'll again focus on
19        Mr. Piendle specifically, as we all must,
20        because again, this case is about him.
21             First, as admitted by Dr. Burns, there
22        really was a dispute among scientists,
23        notwithstanding the available evidence about
24        whether smoking could be said to cause lung
25        cancer before 1964.  It wasn't a dispute about

 1        what the evidence was.  By the mid-1950s,
 2        scientists, public health authorities, the
 3        tobacco industry all knew that smokers got more
 4        lung cancer than nonsmokers in the studies that
 5        had been published.  They all knew that
 6        cigarette smoke contained trace levels measured
 7        at the level of billionths of a gram of
 8        carcinogens, no secret, it was in Reader's
 9        Digest.  And they all knew that mice painted
10        with tobacco smoke condensate developed tumors.
11        It was in LIFE Magazine.  Everybody knew that.
12             But there still was a dispute about what
13        evidence was sufficient to establish cause,
14        whether you also needed an animal model based
15        upon inhalation of cigarette smoke, or you
16        needed a mechanism.  And that's because those 17        are the traditional means of proving cause that
18        medicine and science was accustomed to because
19        they focused on infectious diseases where you
20        can identify the bacteria.
21             And that's what the argument was about.
22        And it might seem silly to us today, but it
23        wasn't back in the 1950s and early 1960s.
24        There was a genuine dispute then.
25             And that's an important reason -- next

 1        demonstrative, please, that's 265.  That's why
 2        we had a Surgeon General's report.  "Few
 3        medical questions have stirred such public
 4        interest and created more scientific debate
 5        than the tobacco health controversy.  The
 6        interrelationships of smoking and health
 7        undoubtedly are complex, the subject does not
 8        lend itself to easy answers."
 9             There was a debate, the report says so.
10        And if you have any doubt about what it was
11        about, let's go to the next slide.
12             Various means and conceptions of the term
13        "cause" were discussed vigorously at a number
14        of meetings of the committee and its
15        subcommittee.  The guys who were writing the
16        1964 report, and I think they were all guys
17        back in 1964, discussed vigorously what they
18        meant by cause.  They were still arguing about
19        it.
20             And even after 1964, as you know and as
21        you've heard, doctors oftentimes did not
22        understand the epidemiological evidence or get
23        on the anti-smoking bandwagon.  In fact, I
24        think Dr. Burns said on cross-examination that
25        the American Medical Association didn't get

 1        fully onboard until the late 1960s.
 2             And you also heard Dr. Burns testify that
 3        his former boss, Surgeon General Julius
 4        Richmond, said he would have no criticism of
 5        anybody who said it had not been proven whether
 6        cigarette smoking caused disease before 1964.
 7             So, for example, in 1954 in the Frank
 8        Statement, the tobacco industry said, "We don't
 9        believe our products are injurious to health."
10             You know what, that's also what the chief
11        executive officers were saying to
12        Hill & Knowlton.  Here's what they told them a
13        couple of weeks before the Frank Statement was
14        published.  This is the internal document.
15        "The industry is strongly convinced that there
16        is no sound scientific basis for the charges
17        that have been made."
18             What they were saying internally they
19        believed was consistent with what they were
20        saying in the Frank Statement in 1953 and in
21        1954.
22             Plaintiff talked a lot about a document
23        from my client in 1953 by Claude Teague.
24             Next slide please, Will.
25             You know, this was a review of the

 1        published literature.  I thought I heard 2        Mr. Barnhart say that this was not public
 3        knowledge.  All the entire basis, if we go back
 4        and look at this exhibit in evidence, every
 5        single source that he cites, and he was pretty
 6        thorough about having citations, is from
 7        published literature.  And there is no
 8        conclusion, as you saw, I think, on
 9        cross-examination of Dr. Burns --
10             Next exhibit.
11             -- that Dr. Teague concluded that smoking
12        causes lung cancer, to the contrary.  He said,
13        "In spite of observation, research, and
14        theorizing for the past 200 years, the cause of
15        spontaneous human cancer is still unknown."
16             Next exhibit that you've seen.  You've
17        seen this one too.  Exhibit 269, please, Will.
18             This was the document entitled "Critical
19        and Objective Appraisal."  It is in evidence.
20        It's clearly a draft when you look at it.  You
21        can see on this excerpt handwritten edits that
22        they're all over the document.
23             And plaintiff a couple of times had read
24        the sentence that immediately precedes it,
25        which basically says the amount of evidence to

 1        indict cigarette smoking is overwhelming and
 2        the evidence on the other side of the coin is
 3        scant.
 4             But what they didn't read to you is,
 5        "However, the evidence from epidemiological,
 6        pathological, biological, and chemical studies
 7        supporting the proposition that lung cancer is
 8        caused by or associated with cigarette smoking
 9        is parallelled by similar evidence supporting
10        the proposition that lung cancer is caused by
11        or associated with air pollutants.  In some
12        cases the evidence seems to be stronger in
13        support of cigarette smoke as a causative or
14        associated factor, in other instances the
15        evidence seems to be stronger in the support of
16        air pollutants as a causative or associated
17        factor."
18             It doesn't sound to me like Dr. Rodgman
19        had it all figured out in 1962, and is it -- it
20        shouldn't come as any great surprise to any of
21        us that in 1962 there are documents in the
22        files of the tobacco industry that talk about
23        smoking and health.  After all, the 1964
24        Surgeon General's report was coming out very
25        shortly.

 1             Okay.  What about after 1964?  Well, the
 2        tobacco industry still refused to accept the
 3        epidemiologic evidence as sufficient, and it
 4        stubbornly clung to the mechanism animal model
 5        school of thought, and they did that for too
 6        long, for far too long.
 7             After 1964, however, that smoking causes
 8        lung cancer and other diseases was hardly a
 9        secret, and the not-proven statements and
10        concealment of the tobacco industry were the
11        subject of ridicule more than they were
12        reliance. 13             And what difference did any of this make
14        to Mr. Piendle?  And plaintiff essentially ran
15        away from this issue and instead she chose to
16        talk once again about Mr. Piendle's birth
17        cohort.  And you saw statistics and you heard
18        testimony about that.
19             And again, we're not here to try a case
20        about Mr. Piendle's birth cohort, we're here
21        for Mr. Piendle.  Nonetheless, I want to take
22        just a few minutes to talk about some of the
23        statistics, and I want to focus on the period
24        from 1964 to 1974.
25             Why do I chose to focus there?  1964 is

 1        the year in which the Surgeon General attempted
 2        to end the genuine scientific dispute about
 3        whether smoking caused lung cancer.  Before
 4        that, again, there was a genuine dispute, the
 5        tobacco company had pretty good company,
 6        including the scientists at the National Cancer
 7        Institute and the American Medical Association.
 8             Why did I pick 1974 as the ending?
 9        Because as you might remember, Dr. Burns
10        testified that if Mr. Piendle had quit smoking
11        before 1975, he likely, from a statistical
12        standpoint, would have avoided his lung cancer.
13             Okay.  Now, ordinary people were ahead of
14        the scientists, Dr. Burns admitted that, and
15        Dr. Norrell showed you that, even before 1964,
16        there is plenty of evidence that they thought
17        smoking was harmful and addictive.  Indeed, in
18        1957, the Surgeon General thought no warning
19        was necessary on the cigarettes because the
20        media had done such an excellent job in
21        covering the emerging science.
22             You heard from Dr. Reynolds.  She was here
23        testifying for the very first time ever as an
24        expert witness, and she explained that in 1960,
25        half of the American public believed that

 1        smoking caused lung cancer, even though the
 2        scientists were still arguing about it and the
 3        first Surgeon General's report wouldn't come
 4        out for another four years in 1964.
 5             Now, it's true that the point estimates,
 6        the precise estimate given for the belief
 7        levels of smokers compared to the public as a
 8        whole were lower, but Dr. Riddel explained that
 9        she couldn't say that the estimates for smokers
10        and the public as a whole were really different
11        numbers statistically because of the increased
12        sampling error when you start splitting up the
13        size of the sample.
14             The point is that by 1964, the information
15        available to the public, including
16        Mr. Piendle's cohort, about the health risks of
17        smoking was overwhelming, as Dr. Norrell
18        testified.
19             And you may recall, the AMA in 1965, 1966,
20        don't hold me to the year, basically said no
21        warning is necessary on cigarette packs because
22        everybody knows.  We got the quote from
23        Dr. Horn a little later in the 1960s.  And you 24        heard several times, you could shout from the
25        rooftop, cigarette smoking is dangerous, and

 1        you wouldn't be telling anybody anything they
 2        didn't already know.
 3             So what was the net effect, the net effect
 4        of all of the information that was out there in
 5        1964, including advertisements, including
 6        tobacco industry not-proven statements, what
 7        was the net effect on the public's awareness
 8        and belief?
 9             Dr. Riddel told you.  She went to the 1964
10        Adult Use of Tobacco Survey --
11             If we could have demonstrative 245, Will.
12              -- and 81 percent of adults were aware
13        that the Surgeon General's report concluded in
14        1964 that smoking causes lung cancer.
15             Let's look at belief.
16             Next demonstrative, 246, please.
17             Again, from the Adult Use of Tobacco
18        Survey, the government survey, the gold
19        standard, 82 percent thought smoking was
20        harmful in 1964.  I don't have a number to show
21        you on lung cancer because that question wasn't
22        asked in that year.
23             Okay.  In 1966, we talked about the
24        warnings, they changed.  Dr. Riddel told you
25        93 percent of smokers saw them, and

 1        Mrs. Piendle said that Mr. Piendle must have
 2        seen them too.
 3             In 1970, the warning changed.  Smoking is
 4        dangerous to your health.  And what about the
 5        ads that plaintiff would have you believe
 6        turned everybody into a hapless victim?  Well,
 7        in 1971, they disappeared from radio and
 8        television, and a year later, in 1972, the
 9        remaining print ads all started carrying
10        warnings.
11             By 1974, the information environment
12        identified by Dr. Norrell was incredibly rich
13        and it was dominated, dominated by the message
14        from the public health community.
15             And again, what was the net effect on the
16        public's belief of all this information,
17        including tobacco company ads and tobacco
18        company not-proven statements?  And again,
19        Dr. Riddel showed you.  I don't have a survey
20        from 1974.  We got one from '75.
21             Demonstrative 246, please.  Is this it?
22             And 90 percent of the folks then believed
23        that smoking was harmful.
24             If we look at the Gallup poll from 1977.
25        Again, there's no survey in '74, '75, and '76,

 1        so I can't show you those.  But Gallup in 1977.
 2        81 percent of the people believed that smoking
 3        was a cause of lung cancer.
 4             In short, the statistical evidence shows
 5        that despite what the tobacco industry said or
 6        did not say, the clear message from a host of
 7        sources had gotten through loud and clear to
 8        the American public by 1974. 9             Okay.  Let's talk about what plaintiff has
10        tried to avoid.  The evidence regarding the
11        effect of all this on Mr. Piendle, not on his
12        birth cohort, and not just from 1964 to 1974.
13        And let's look at what Mrs. Piendle told you in
14        her testimony here in court.
15             If I could have demonstrative -- here you
16        go.
17             She couldn't say for sure what caused
18        Mr. Piendle to smoke.  She didn't know if there
19        was anything R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company or
20        Philip Morris could have told Mr. Piendle that
21        would have caused him not to smoke.  She can't
22        say what caused Mr. Piendle to continue smoking
23        before the time that he became addicted.  She
24        doesn't know if anything R.J. Reynolds or
25        Philip Morris said or did made Mr. Piendle

 1        continue smoking after he became addicted.
 2             There's more.  She doesn't know if there's
 3        anything R.J. Reynolds or Philip Morris could
 4        have said or done that would have made
 5        Mr. Piendle stop smoking any sooner than he
 6        did.  She doesn't know if there's anything
 7        R.J. Reynolds or Philip Morris could have said
 8        or done differently that would have avoided
 9        Mr. Piendle's lung cancer.  And even if
10        R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris never made a
11        single cigarette, she didn't know if
12        Mr. Piendle would have avoided his lung cancer
13        and death.  That's pretty powerful evidence, I
14        submit, and it's specific to Mr. Piendle.
15        There's no bridge, no bridge.
16             All right.  Third major issue.  I've got
17        to move along.  Third major issue is fault,
18        responsibility.  You only get this far if you
19        find that plaintiff has proven, has built that
20        bridge between the defendant's conduct and
21        Mr. Piendle's lung cancer, but-for clause, if
22        you find that, you get to responsibility of
23        fault.  And you saw the verdict form.  It asked
24        you to allocate fault as among Mr. Piendle,
25        Reynolds and Philip Morris.

 1             I want to talk about that now.  Again,
 2        nobody forced Mr. Piendle to start smoking in
 3        the eighth or ninth grade.  Nobody forced him
 4        to smoke socially or once in a while.  When he
 5        was in high school, he knew that cigarettes
 6        caused cancer and death, cancer sticks, coffin
 7        nails.  Nobody forced him to continue smoking
 8        after he graduated from high school, all the
 9        way up until 1989.
10             Smokers, even addicted smokers, as you
11        know, had the ability to quit.  The basic fact
12        is unchallenged, and all of the experts agree,
13        here is just one example in the interest of
14        time from Dr. Cummings.
15             You have -- 270, please.
16             He was physically capable of quitting
17        smoking for good during any year that he smoked
18        from the 1950s all the way through 1988, true?
19        Sure.  Sure.  And the fact that it can be hard 20        for some, a fact that Dr. Benowitz has said has
21        been well-known for over a hundred years,
22        doesn't alter the fact that smokers have the
23        ability to quit.
24             Mr. Piendle had that ability.  You don't
25        have to draw theoretical inferences to reach

 1        that conclusion, because we know he did quit in
 2        1989.
 3             You know also some statistics, 60 million
 4        smokers have quit, 95 percent without any
 5        assistance, more former smokers alive today
 6        than current smokers.  And the vast majority of
 7        those former smokers, under the rules of thumb
 8        that plaintiff would have you believe is
 9        sufficient to define addiction in this case,
10        almost all of them are probably addicted under
11        those rules of thumb.
12             THE CLERK:  Counselor, 30 minutes.
13             MR. BIERSTEKER:  Thank you.
14             So let me start with a simple concept,
15        with the ability to quit smoking comes a
16        responsibility to quit.  Pretty simple and I
17        think true.  There was nothing magical about
18        1989.  There was nothing special or unique
19        about how Mr. Piendle quit smoking in 1989.  He
20        quit cold turkey.  Could have done that
21        anytime.
22             And next demonstrative, 252, please.
23             Mrs. Piendle agreed, there wasn't anything
24        new about the health risks of smoking that
25        Mr. Piendle learned in 1989 that he didn't know

 1        before.
 2             And next slide, please.
 3             Mrs. Piendle had no reason to believe that
 4        Mr. Piendle could not have quit smoking sooner
 5        than he did, and she doesn't know why he didn't
 6        quit smoking sooner.  Mr. Piendle bears
 7        responsibility for not quitting smoking sooner
 8        than he did, as well as for having started
 9        smoking, and as well as for having chosen to
10        become a regular smoker.
11             The fact that he died of lung cancer is
12        tragic, I'm not going to tell you otherwise,
13        but it doesn't lessen his responsibility.
14        Dr. Burns agreed that just because somebody may
15        be addicted to nicotine does not relieve them
16        of responsibility for their own choices.  They
17        have to make a decision to quit.  Dr. Cummings,
18        smokers are fully responsible for making the
19        decision to quit.  And you heard about the
20        Surgeon General's report, smoking is a personal
21        choice of behavior.
22             And Mrs. Piendle admitted, during
23        cross-examination, that Mr. Piendle's decision
24        to start smoking was his decision, that he
25        decided for himself to become a regular smoker,

 1        and ultimately he was an adult, he could make
 2        his own decisions.  And based upon what you
 3        know about Mr. Piendle, the evidence suggests
 4        that he would agree, he was not the kind of man 5        who sought to avoid responsibility for his
 6        actions, the evidence was that he accepted full
 7        responsibility for his choices in life, and we
 8        know that from Mrs. Piendle.  He never blamed
 9        anyone else for his choices, it would have been
10        uncharacteristic of him to do so.
11             We talked about how he never blamed his
12        lung cancer on cigarette advertising.  He never
13        blamed the tobacco companies for not having
14        warnings on cigarette packs earlier than 1966.
15        He never blamed tobacco companies for his lung
16        cancer because they didn't give him more
17        information about the health risks of smoking
18        or addictiveness.  He never blamed the tobacco
19        companies for his lung cancer for any reason.
20             Indeed, Mr. Piendle had the best chance to
21        avoid his lung cancer, he had plenty of
22        opportunities.  Don't start smoking, don't
23        become a regular smoker, quit any time before
24        1975.  And if he had seized any one of those
25        opportunities, we would not be here today.

 1             He has the greatest responsibility for
 2        failing to do so, and he should bear the
 3        greatest allocation for fault in this case.
 4             I submit that unlike Mr. Barnhart's
 5        suggestion of 5 to 10 percent, Mr. Piendle
 6        bears at least 70 percent of the responsibility
 7        for what happened.  That's just a simple
 8        acknowledgment of personal responsibilities
 9        that we all bear for the choices we make in
10        life, especially when we are aware, as
11        Mr. Piendle was from the very beginning, of the
12        risks of smoking cancer sticks and coffin
13        nails.
14             Let me discuss the responsibility of the
15        defendants, especially my client R.J. Reynolds.
16        And at the outset I will say, I do not think
17        plaintiff has built that bridge, I don't think
18        you get here.  And if you agree, you won't
19        consider the responsibility of the companies.
20        But if you do get this far, there are some
21        things I want you to consider.
22             The defendants' cigarettes are inherently
23        dangerous.  They cannot be made safe, can't be
24        done.  They are still legal products, always
25        have been.  Defendants tried hard, starting in

 1        the 1950s, to reduce the risks of smoking by
 2        responding to the suggestions of the public
 3        health community, by lowing tar and nicotine
 4        yields, and pursuing other reasonable
 5        suggestions.  And well before 1975, the dangers
 6        of legal cigarettes were plastered with
 7        warnings on every pack and in every ad.
 8             Now, in her life with Mr. Piendle,
 9        Mrs. Piendle, as you saw from the quote --
10             Let's put it up again, 248, please, Will.
11              -- he was an adult, he could make his own
12        decisions, and as consequence, there's no
13        evidence that she ever warned him because she
14        had no doubt that he already knew.  We know
15        that she never asked him to quit, we know that 16        she selected the cigarette brands, we know that
17        throughout their marriage she bought the
18        cigarettes, we know that she continued to
19        smoke, which no doubt made it harder for him to
20        quit.
21             He was an adult, he could make his own
22        decisions, exactly right, exactly right.  And
23        as a consequence, the defense responsibility
24        should be zero or very small, precisely the
25        position the plaintiff takes with respect to

 1        her life with her husband.
 2             All right.  But if you do allocate
 3        responsibility to the defendants, I think you
 4        should keep in mind the evidence concerning
 5        Mr. Piendle's smoking history.  And I want to
 6        do this as quickly as I possibly can.
 7             Okay.  In the 1950s, yeah, we know that he
 8        smoked some Lucky Strikes, maybe some Pall
 9        Mall.  There was talk that when he was still in
10        high school, before he graduated, he smoked
11        cigarettes in a red pack, could have been
12        Winstons, might have been Marlboros, who knows.
13             From 1959, when he graduated high school,
14        all the way up through 1967, because remember,
15        he didn't meet Mrs. Piendle until 1968, no one
16        really knows what brands he was smoking as his
17        regular brand.  Nobody who testified saw him
18        often enough in that period to know.  There is
19        no evidence that he was smoking a brand that
20        was manufactured by either of the defendants in
21        this case, and it would be unfair and contrary
22        to the evidence -- remember, that's what you
23        have to decide this case on, in accordance with
24        the law -- contrary to the evidence to assign
25        responsibility to Reynolds or Philip Morris for

 1        any of Mr. Piendle's smoking during that
 2        period.
 3             Okay.  Mrs. Piendle meets him in 1968.  At
 4        that time, Mr. Piendle is smoking Marlboros, a
 5        brand made by Philip Morris, but there is no
 6        evidence about how long he had been smoking it.
 7             In 1969, Mrs. Piendle influences
 8        Mr. Piendle to switch to Winston cigarettes,
 9        which he smokes until 1974.
10             Keep in mind what I said earlier,
11        Dr. Burns testified if Mr. Piendle had quit
12        smoking before 1975, just about the time he
13        switches to Raleigh cigarettes, which were made
14        by my client, he more likely than not would
15        have avoided his lung cancer from smoking.
16             So in fairness, if you find that the
17        defendant should share responsibility with
18        Mr. Piendle for his smoking, I would suggest
19        that it might be appropriate to focus on his
20        smoking after 1974.
21             In 1979, he switched to Doral, again, a
22        Reynolds product, which he smoked until 1985,
23        and then in 1985, a switch again from Doral to
24        Merit cigarettes, a brand made by Philip
25        Morris.
7012 1             So if you look at the brand history in
 2        this period from 1975 to 1989, it's roughly
 3        two-thirds Reynolds, one-third Philip Morris.
 4             Okay.  Damages.  Two kinds of damages.
 5        There are compensatory damages and punitive
 6        damages.  Compensatory damages, as you have
 7        heard, and nobody really disagrees, are meant
 8        to compensate the plaintiff in this case for
 9        her injury.  And to determine the amount of
10        damages, compensatory damages to be awarded,
11        you should consider what the plaintiff has lost
12        and you should compensate her for that loss if
13        you get this far.
14             The determination that you will make will
15        fully compensate her for that loss.  That's why
16        the law provided to you by the Court calls
17        these damages compensatory damages.  So if you
18        deliberate and decide to award compensatory
19        damages, the amount that you award will be the
20        amount that you all agree is necessary to make
21        the plaintiff whole.
22             If you decide she has met her burden, you
23        must decide how much money it will take to do
24        that.  It's our legal system's way.  And that's
25        a hard task.  This is perhaps the most

 1        difficult area of this case for you to separate
 2        from your emotions --
 3             If we can have the demonstrative, please,
 4        Will.
 5             -- from reason.
 6             The Court -- let's talk about that.  Do
 7        not let sympathy influence your decision.  It
 8        must be based on the evidence that had been
 9        received and the law on which the Court has
10        instructed you.  Your duty is to be just and
11        fair.  And, again, Reynolds is just as much
12        interested in justice as Mrs. Piendle is.
13             So as the Court has instructed you, and
14        you will see when you go to your road map,
15        compensatory damages are only to compensate
16        Mrs. Piendle for her loss of companionship,
17        starting at the time her husband passed away,
18        and the pain and suffering that accompanies
19        that loss.
20             Under the law you are not allowed, as
21        Mr. Barnhart I think said, to consider the pain
22        and suffering and loss of any other witness who
23        testified here, no matter how genuine and how
24        deep that loss is.  You can't consider Tracy
25        Piendle, you can't consider Mr. Edward Piendle,

 1        the sole focus is on Mrs. Piendle.
 2             And, again, the sole focus when it comes
 3        to Mrs. Piendle is for her loss of
 4        companionship and the accompanying pain and
 5        suffering.
 6             So there's a couple of things I want you
 7        to keep in mind as you think about what would
 8        be fair.  I think first you should keep in mind
 9        the nature of the relationship between Mr. and
10        Mrs. Piendle prior to his death.  As of 1975,
11        Mr. Piendle was 100 percent disabled due to his 12        Crohn's disease.  He received VA disability
13        benefits, and Mrs. Piendle continues to receive
14        a pension from the VA.  He spent his time at
15        home, and Mrs. Piendle worked for 25 years as a
16        nurse, provided support and services for both
17        of them.  And even when they were home at the
18        same time, they spent time apart.  You heard
19        the testimony from Mrs. Piendle, he was kind of
20        a sports nut, she didn't like sports.  So, when
21        they watched TV, they would do it in separate
22        rooms.  She'd watch her programs.  He'd watched
23        his.
24             Mr. Piendle also worked in the garage with
25        his woodworking.  Mr. Piendle's physical

 1        condition, the Crohn's disease, the arthritis
 2        that prompted their move down to Florida in
 3        1980 impacted the quality of their life
 4        together, and it would have continued to do so
 5        as they got older.
 6             Now, Mrs. Piendle is asking you to award
 7        money for her loss of companionship after
 8        Mr. Piendle's death in 1996.  That means you
 9        also need to consider her life after 1996.  She
10        continued to work for eight years after
11        Mr. Piendle died in the same nursing job she
12        had for 17 years before his death.
13             She owned her own business, the lawn
14        business for a while, and she invested in real
15        estate.  She started dating about a year after
16        Mr. Piendle passed away, using online dating
17        services, and she had a ten-year relationship
18        with a man named Jorge Rodriguez, who she met
19        in 1998, and that's the picture, you may
20        recall, from Christmas.
21             Now, you heard a little about
22        Mr. Rodriguez, or Jorge, during this trial, and
23        I want to talk about that.
24             If we could have defense demonstrative
25        250, Will.

 1             Okay.  Let's talk about it.  I think this
 2        is confusing, kind of confusing me, and I knew
 3        the background.
 4             Mrs. Piendle was deposed in June of 2009,
 5        and she was asked whether she had any serious
 6        relationships, and she didn't mention
 7        Mr. Rodriguez.  She also didn't mention him
 8        when she corrected her deposition transcript in
 9        October of 2009.  In the meantime, defense had
10        deposed Tracy Piendle, and she was asked about
11        any serious relationships her mom may have had
12        since her father's death.
13             And Tracy Piendle --
14             MR. SCAROLA:  I'm sorry, your Honor, but I
15        must object.  That was not part of the
16        evidence.  There was no such question asked of
17        Tracy Piendle.
18             MR. BIERSTEKER:  Well, it was.  Tracy
19        Piendle, not Mrs. Piendle, told about
20        Mr. Rodriguez.
21             Now, after Tracy Piendle's deposition, we
22        sent Mrs. Piendle written Interrogatories, 23        those questions, and the questions followed up
24        and asked about Jorge.  The interrogatory
25        responses are in evidence.  You will have them

 1        in the jury room.
 2             Defendants had to ask those questions,
 3        and -- these written questions, because
 4        Mrs. Piendle didn't tell us in her deposition
 5        or when she corrected her deposition about the
 6        relationship with Jorge.  So in December 2009,
 7        she signed her Answers to those questions, and
 8        in May 2010 she amended the Answers to provide
 9        a more accurate picture about her relationship
10        with Jorge.
11             Now, let's talk about what happened at
12        trial.  At trial, Mrs. Piendle admitted on
13        cross-examination by Mr. Henk that she didn't
14        mention Jorge in her deposition.  And then
15        Plaintiff's counsel did a redirect examination
16        of Mrs. Piendle, knowing that the defendants
17        wouldn't be able to ask any more questions, and
18        they made it sound as though Mrs. Piendle had
19        been forthcoming about the relationship with
20        Jorge all along, pointing to those very
21        interrogatory responses, but not telling you
22        the chronological sequence or the background.
23             And I don't really know a nice way to say
24        what I'm about to say, so I'm just going to say
25        it:  That testimony was misleading.

 1             So the defense was forced to call
 2        Mrs. Piendle back to the stand in our case, so
 3        that you could hear the rest of the story, and
 4        that prompted Mrs. Piendle to testify that her
 5        relationship with Jorge wasn't serious because
 6        it wasn't committed.
 7             If we could have Defense Exhibit -- I
 8        think it's 255.
 9             Now -- "well, I wasn't really ready to
10        settle down again and have a committed
11        relationship."
12             Really?  This was a ten-year relationship,
13        four years of which involved romantic activity.
14             Next demonstrative, please, Will, 255A.
15             And this is the interrogatory response.
16             Again, you've got it.  But if this
17        relationship wasn't committed, why did
18        Mrs. Piendle break it off because Jorge wanted
19        to date another person?  I don't know.  It
20        sounds pretty committed to me to see just one
21        person for four years.
22             Tracy, when she testified before you, said
23        it was a serious relationship, said it was one
24        that her mother was unlikely to forget.
25             Tracy said that Mrs. Piendle and Jorge

 1        lived together for four years, which
 2        Mrs. Piendle denies.  And you know what, I
 3        don't really care whether Jorge's mail was
 4        delivered to the same house as Mrs. Piendle's
 5        or not.  A relationship was serious enough that
 6        Tracy testified that Jorge had become like a
 7        grandfather to her daughter. 8             Now, this evidence plainly goes to the
 9        quality of Mrs. Piendle's life after the death
10        of Mr. Piendle.  It is a sign that she was
11        moving on starting in 1998.  But it's more than
12        that.  It's more than that.  It goes to the
13        credibility of Mrs. Piendle.
14             Part of your job as judges of the facts is
15        to assess the credibility of witnesses.
16             If I could have demonstrative 275.  There
17        it is.
18             You can look at the frankness or lack of
19        frankness of the witness, any interest the
20        witness may have in the outcome of the case,
21        the reasonableness of the testimony of the
22        witness considered in light of all of the
23        evidence.
24             You can reject all or part of the witness'
25        testimony and ask yourself, why did

 1        Mrs. Piendle say "no" in June 2009 in her
 2        deposition?  Why didn't she mention Jorge?  Why
 3        did she and her counsel try to make it seem
 4        like she had been forthcoming about Jorge all
 5        along.
 6             And I submit there's no answers to those
 7        questions that doesn't raise significant
 8        questions or issues about the credibility of
 9        Mrs. Piendle.  You must consider that.  I heard
10        Ms. Baker-Barnes up here suggesting that maybe
11        $23 million was what they wanted.  She said a
12        million dollars a year, at least for each and
13        every one of those years.  She was up here on
14        the stand portraying her marriage to
15        Mr. Piendle as essentially perfect, the yin and
16        yang.  Remember that?  Never mind the one-year
17        separation, never mind the divorce filing,
18        never mind that she said she was attracted to
19        Mr. Piendle initially, in part, because he was
20        older and secure in life.
21             THE CLERK:  Counselor, ten minutes.
22             MR. BIERSTEKER:  Thank you.
23             Finally, Mrs. Piendle testified she was
24        engaged to a man named Jerry Medina in 19 --
25        2005.  That's another serious commitment.

 1        That's another sign that someone is moving on
 2        with their life.  Time, in short, has helped to
 3        heal, as one would hope it would,
 4        Mrs. Piendle's loss of companionship.  The
 5        evidence has shown you that she's gone through
 6        that healing process following her husband's
 7        death 14 years ago.
 8             Based on the evidence, let me suggest some
 9        numbers.  It's understandable and reasonable
10        that the first year after Mr. Piendle's death
11        was probably the most difficult for
12        Mrs. Piendle.  Should you decide to award any
13        compensatory damages to Mrs. Piendle, a fair
14        amount of compensation for that year that you
15        should consider would be $150,000 that first
16        year.
17             Mrs. Piendle began dating after
18        Mr. Piendle passed away and met Jorge Rodriguez 19        shortly thereafter.  She had a long-term close
20        relationship with him, four years of which
21        involved romantic activity.  If Tracy is right,
22        they lived together.  It was a serious
23        commitment on her part.  Her romantic
24        relationship with Jorge came to an end, but
25        shortly thereafter she met and became engaged

 1        to Jerry Medina in 2005, and that was an even
 2        greater commitment on her part.
 3             So this was a roughly ten-year period,
 4        from the time Mrs. Piendle began dating in
 5        1997, and the end of her engagement in
 6        approximately 2007 to Mr. Medina.  The healing
 7        process continued.  I think a fair amount of
 8        compensation for that ten-year period would be
 9        approximately $75,000 a year for ten years,
10        totaling three-quarters of a million.
11             And finally, plaintiff introduced evidence
12        about the joint life expectancy of Mr. and
13        Mrs. Piendle.  It would have gone to 2019, 23
14        years after his death in 1996.  You had the
15        opportunity to hear about her -- the events in
16        her life after the last 14 years since
17        Mr. Piendle passed away, and from that you have
18        an insight about what will occur for the last
19        nine years of that 23-year period, from now
20        until 2019.
21             So let's talk about the 12 years starting
22        in 2007, nine of which remain.  Starting three
23        years ago in 2007, roughly after the engagement
24        ended with Mr. Medina, until 2009, the healing
25        process for Mrs. Piendle will continue.  She

 1        will continue to enjoy life, as she did with
 2        Jorge, Jerry, her friends and her family.
 3             She will still have the opportunity to
 4        travel, visit friends and relatives and live a
 5        full and complete life.  For this remaining 12
 6        year of joint life expectancy from 2007 to
 7        2019, a fair amount of compensation for
 8        Mrs. Piendle should be approximately $50,000
 9        for each and every one of those years.
10             Now, if you add up everything I have
11        suggested, I think it comes out to about
12        $1.5 million.  That's a significant sum.  I ask
13        that you consider it.
14             All right.  Punitive damages.  I'm in the
15        home stretch.  As you already heard, punitive
16        damages serve two purposes, punishment and
17        deterrence.  Punitive damages are not to
18        compensate Mrs. Piendle.  The compensatory
19        damages are for that.  But she, not the
20        American Cancer Society or anybody else, would
21        receive any punitive damages that you award in
22        order to punish and deter the defendants.
23             As the Court has explained in the
24        instructions, punitive damages cannot be
25        imposed for conduct that was not a legal cause

 1        of Mr. Piendle's death.  I'm going to say it
 2        again.  You cannot award punitive damages based
 3        upon what you think was bad behavior in the 4        air.  The conduct for which punitive damages,
 5        if any, should be awarded for conduct, if any,
 6        that you find was a legal cause of
 7        Mr. Piendle's death.
 8             So just to pick an example, if you find
 9        that concealment was not a legal but-for cause
10        of Mr. Piendle's continued smoking and lung
11        cancer, there can be no punitive damages for
12        concealment.
13             Okay.  You must focus on that conduct, and
14        you have to focus on the character of the
15        conduct.  Defendants are liable for punitive
16        damages only if Plaintiff additionally proves
17        that the conduct was so great, gross and
18        flagrant as to amount to reckless disregard,
19        conscious indifference.  You saw that slide
20        when Mr. Barnhart was up here.
21             Remember that here plaintiff's burden of
22        proof is much higher than for the other issues
23        in the case.  It's clear and convincing
24        evidence, again defined in the jury
25        instructions.  There is no absolute or

 1        automatic right to punitive damages.  Plaintiff
 2        has to meet that higher burden.
 3             And let's talk about that.  Has she done
 4        it?  I don't think it will surprise you, I
 5        suggest the answer is no.
 6             Let's talk about it.  We've already
 7        discussed that plaintiff has not proven legal
 8        cause.  I'm not going to repeat all that, but I
 9        want to -- want you to remember Mrs. Piendle's
10        key admissions on this subject.
11             Give it a minute, Will.  Next slide,
12        please.
13             Let's talk about the character of my
14        client's conduct, R.J. Reynolds.  Let's talk
15        about the first one, design.  Reynolds'
16        cigarette design efforts were responsive to the
17        suggestions of the public health community.
18        Dr. Figlar must have said that two dozen times
19        when he was on the stand, and that includes
20        efforts to reduce tar and nicotine.
21             Isn't it true that you agree in 1997 --
22             Wait.  What's that?
23             Wrong slide.  Wrong slide.
24             As Dr. Burns testified --
25             That was right.  I'm sorry.  I'm getting

 1        hungry.  That's a sign that I've been up here
 2        too long.
 3             As Dr. Burns testified, he thought in 1997
 4        that it had been proven beyond a reasonable
 5        doubt that low-tar cigarettes reduce risk of
 6        lung cancer.  I mean, you can't look back with
 7        the benefit 20-20 hindsight.  You heard how
 8        Dr. Burns and some other members of the public
 9        health community today don't think that lower
10        tar or filtered cigarettes matter.
11             That's not the environment.  We keep
12        hearing it -- well, take it back to the time
13        when Mr. Piendle was in the 1950s.  Well, take
14        the defense back, too, and the public health 15        community's clear and consistent message
16        throughout the time that Mr. Piendle was alive
17        was that the lower tar and nicotine cigarettes
18        were less hazardous.  That is true, as
19        Dr. Burns is testifying here, even after
20        Mr. Piendle was deceased.  Were they safe?  No.
21        But less hazardous.  That's what we thought.
22             All right.  Advertising.  Cigarettes are a
23        legal product.  They are legal to manufacture,
24        they are legal to advertise, they are legal to
25        sell, and, oh, by the way, R.J. Reynolds

 1        doesn't sell directly to consumers, for the
 2        most part.  Their sales are to retailers and
 3        wholesalers.
 4             You're not here to decide whether it's
 5        legal or illegal to sell cigarettes or whether
 6        Reynolds should be punished for doing so.  Our
 7        society decided a long time ago that it's legal
 8        to sell and advertise and manufacture
 9        cigarettes, and that is a decision we continue
10        to adhere to.
11             Congress, the Surgeon General, and the
12        public health community have also made the
13        decision to let the public know about the
14        health risks of smoking and to let every adult
15        decide for herself or himself whether to smoke,
16        just us as Mr. Piendle did.  And advertising
17        was one way in which Reynolds and other
18        cigarette manufacturers competed for market
19        share.  That's not gross or flagrant or
20        reckless conduct.  It's competition.
21             THE CLERK:  Counsel.
22             MR. BIERSTEKER:  How many minutes?
23             THE CLERK:  Three.
24             MR. BIERSTEKER:  Shoot.  I may have to
25        steal a couple of minutes of my colleague's

 1        time, if he'll allow me.
 2             Let's talk about concealment.  We talked
 3        about that, a genuine scientific dispute up
 4        until at least 1964.  The tobacco industry's
 5        position was one that was shared by others,
 6        including the American Medical Association, the
 7        National Cancer Institute, and scientists at
 8        other institutions.
 9             After 1964, the fact that smoking caused
10        lung cancer and other diseases was hardly a
11        secret.  The vast majority of people, including
12        Mr. Piendle, knew and believed otherwise and
13        the industry's stubborn adherence to the not
14        proving point increasingly became a source of
15        ridicule.
16             Denials of addiction started in 1988.
17        They were understandable.  I don't know what
18        they had to do with Mr. Piendle.  And all this
19        occurred against the backdrop of publications
20        of scientific research, innovations and design,
21        presentations to government authorities,
22        cooperation with the National Cancer Institute,
23        and so forth.  Plaintiffs did not prove, by
24        clear and convincing evidence, that punishment
25        is warranted. 7029
 1             Let's talk about the second function of
 2        punitive damages, deterrence.  Since 1998,
 3        there are 60 million pages of tobacco industry
 4        documents that have been made public, and the
 5        number grows daily.  As new documents written
 6        now, it added.  Concealment cannot occur.
 7             There is also no need to deter the
 8        defendants from making statements to the
 9        general public denying that smoking causes
10        disease or is addictive.  For ten years, the
11        defendants' web sites have publicly stated that
12        smoking causes disease, including lung cancer
13        and is addictive.
14             You should also know Tobacco Institute and
15        the Council for Tobacco Research are gone since
16        1998.  The people that authored many of the
17        documents you've seen, Claude Teague, Frank
18        Colby, Murray Senkus, Alan Rodgman, and my
19        client are gone.
20             MR. SCAROLA:  I'm sorry, your Honor.  I
21        don't believe there's any evidence in the
22        record with regard to those matters.  Nor is
23        that good conduct allegation appropriate
24        argument for this stage of the proceedings.
25             THE COURT:  Okay.  I'll sustain as to the

 1        first basis.
 2             MR. BIERSTEKER:  All right.
 3             Let's talk about what Dr. Figlar told you
 4        about Reynolds, his consistent efforts to
 5        reduce the inherent risks of conventional
 6        tobacco-burning cigarettes; about Premier and
 7        Eclipse, the tobacco-heating cigarettes; about
 8        encouraging smokers who will not quit to switch
 9        to smokeless tobacco products, such as Camel
10        Snus that Mr. Scarola put on the ELMO.
11             The smokeless tobacco products that, as
12        Dr. Figlar told you, pose lesser health risks,
13        including a lesser risk of oral cancer than
14        conventional cigarettes; about Niconovum, whose
15        products, if approved by the FDA, will help
16        smokers quit.  Reynolds, of course, is still a
17        tobacco company.  That's legal.
18             But given what you have heard, given its
19        decades long pursuit of reduced-harm products,
20        reduced-harm cigarettes; given its
21        encouragement to those who choose to use
22        tobacco products to migrate to reduced-risk
23        smokeless ones; given the plans to provide
24        assistance through Niconovum to those who want
25        to quit; given the position on the company's

 1        website for ten years that smoking causes
 2        disease and is addictive, I propose there is no
 3        reason to impose punitive damages to deter
 4        R.J. Reynolds from the kind of conduct that
 5        occurred decades ago.
 6             All right.  I got literally one minute.  I
 7        don't know what Mr. Scarola or whomever else is
 8        going to do the rebuttal case for plaintiff is
 9        going to say.  And I don't get another chance
10        to talk to you.  This is it.  I can see that 11        you're all disappointed.
12             But do me a favor, as you listen to
13        Mr. Scarola, please think about what I might
14        have said in response, based upon the evidence
15        you've heard and the instructions on the law
16        that the Court has given you.
17             And let me close where I began:  Thanks
18        for listening.  I know it s been a little bit
19        of a long haul this morning, and you're not
20        done yet.
21             I thank you for being fair, for being
22        impartial, for being dispassionate judges of
23        the facts and deciding this case on the
24        evidence and the law.
25             And on behalf of Reynolds and everybody on

 1        the defense side, and, I'm sure, Plaintiffs,
 2        too, thank you truly for your service.  We
 3        appreciate it.  Thanks.
 4             THE COURT:  You're not done yet, but you
 5        get a break.  So we will have our lunch break
 6        now, a little bit late.  I apologize.  We'll be
 7        in recess until 3:00 o'clock.  So we'll be in
 8        recess for an hour and ten minutes.
 9             Please leave your notepads on your chair.
10        Please remember the very important instruction
11        not to begin discussing the case with either
12        yourselves or anyone else.  You're not to have
13        any contact with anyone associated with the
14        case, not to review any media or listen to any
15        media, should you exposed to it, about the case
16        over the break, and we'll see you back at
17        3:00 o'clock.  Thank you very much.


 8                     CLOSING ARGUMENT
 9             MR. KELLY:  Thank you, your Honor.  I want
10        to make sure your computer is working.
11             THE COURT:  Okay.  Start over again.
12             MR. KELLY:  Take two.
13             THE COURT:  Please give your attention to
14        Philip Morris' closing argument.
15             MR. KELLY:  May it please the Court.
16        Thank you, your Honor, and counsel and
17        Mrs. Piendle.
18             Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.  So
19        good to be able to look you in the eyes for a
20        change rather than pass you in the hallway
21        looking at my feet, so I'm going to take full
22        advantage of that this afternoon.
23             I have, according to our clerk, Gina,
24        58.3 minutes to talk to you this afternoon.  So
25        I'm going to get right to it.  I think if I'm

 1        going to talk half as long as everybody else,
 2        I'll get twice as much attention.
 3             MR. SCAROLA:  Is that the way it works?
 4             MR. KELLY:  I want to thank you for that
 5        attention right at the beginning on behalf of
 6        my client, Philip Morris, my partner, Mr. Henk,
 7        and I appreciate your patience, and thank you
 8        in advance for the rest of the afternoon paying
 9        attention.
10             The plaintiff's lawyers in this case,
11        Mrs. Piendle's lawyers in this case, have
12        suggested to you that you award against Philip
13        Morris an enormous amount of money because
14        Mr. Piendle smoked, on occasion, Philip Morris
15        products during his 30 years of smoking.
16             On behalf of Philip Morris, our response
17        is that we have, that is, Philip Morris has no
18        legal responsibility under the evidence you've
19        been presented and the law you've been given to
20        pay Mrs. Piendle any money whatsoever for the
21        cigarettes that her husband smoked made by
22        Philip Morris over the course of his smoking
23        history.
24             Let me tell you why.  There's nothing that
25        Philip Morris did or didn't do that caused

 1        Mr. Piendle to start smoking, No. 1.  There's
 2        nothing that Philip Morris did or didn't do,
 3        other than sell cigarettes, which I'll talk
 4        about later.  There's nothing that Philip
 5        Morris did or didn't do that caused Mr. Piendle 6        to continue smoking those Philip Morris
 7        cigarettes; and thirdly, there's nothing that
 8        Philip Morris did or didn't do that prevented
 9        Mr. Piendle from quitting smoking.
10             When Charlie Piendle smoked his first
11        cigarette sometime in the 1950s, the Marlboro
12        cowboy had not yet been born.  When Mr. Piendle
13        smoked his first cigarettes in the 1950s, they
14        were still selling cigarettes one at a time at
15        the corner store.  When Mr. Piendle started
16        smoking, his family didn't have a television
17        set.  Those are some of the facts in the
18        evidence that you've been given.
19             So much of what you've been told about
20        Mr. Piendle is based upon the memories that his
21        friends and family have, and those memories
22        date back some 50 years or more, and you are
23        being asked, in large part, to base some of
24        your decisions in this case on memories that go
25        back 50 years.  Well, memories fade over time.

 1        Gaps in recollection grow over time.
 2             You may think back just in this case, it's
 3        just over a month ago when voir dire took
 4        place, upstairs in the big courtroom, and some
 5        of the things that were said to you about this
 6        case then, if you stop and think about it, may
 7        not be that clear right now, may have started
 8        to fade.  Things that were said in opening
 9        statement, Mr. Barnhart's representation that
10        Mr. Piendle started smoking and continued
11        smoking because he was weak until he finally
12        became strong in 1989.  Some of you may
13        remember that and others may have to search
14        your notes, and that's just 30 days ago.
15             Well, imagine, then, the difficulty of
16        remembering things that happened not 30 days
17        ago, but 30 years ago, and to be precise about
18        things that happened 50 years ago.  So as you
19        consider the evidence of things that happened a
20        long time ago, not just with respect to
21        Mr. Piendle, but with respect to many of these
22        documents and events that happened in the '50s
23        and '60s that you've seen, authored by
24        witnesses who are long since dead or left the
25        company, that attempting to figure out not only

 1        what happened a long time ago, but why it
 2        happened a long time ago is a very hard thing
 3        to do.  And so you're going to have to figure
 4        out when you go into the jury room how much
 5        weight on the scales of justice distant
 6        memories are going to have.
 7             Let me give you just one example from one
 8        of the first witnesses in the case, Mr. Cabral,
 9        Babe Cabral.  You may remember that some 40 or
10        50 years ago, he remembered a Marlboro cowboy
11        ad in his neighborhood.  Now, there's no doubt
12        that at some time there probably was a Marlboro
13        cowboy ad in his neighborhood.  There's also no
14        doubt that the Marlboro cowboy and Marlboro
15        country campaign didn't start until 1962.
16        1962, Charlie Piendle was 21 years old, he was 17        in the Marines.
18             Now, it could be that Mr. Cabral was
19        remembering some other ad involving a man and a
20        Marlboro, that's all possible, but I do
21        remember one of the questions he was asked was,
22        isn't it hard to remember back then?  And you
23        may remember that he sighed and said, yeah,
24        it's a long time ago, and requiring Mr. Cabral
25        to remember whether it was 52 years ago or 58

 1        years ago or 56 years ago, I think is asking
 2        too much of anybody's memory, trying to go back
 3        into their childhood, especially when most of
 4        those witnesses wouldn't have thought anything
 5        about Charlie Piendle's smoking until a couple
 6        of years ago when this lawsuit was brought.
 7             Nobody followed Charlie Piendle around
 8        with a notepad, making notes of his awareness
 9        and knowledge and beliefs about smoking, making
10        notes about his interest in smoking, why he
11        smoked, why he quit, why he didn't quit.
12        Nobody's following him around and making notes
13        about what actually he believed or said at the
14        time.  There's a lot of memories that you're
15        being asked to rely upon from times gone by.
16             Okay.  Let me address the substance of the
17        claims against Philip Morris, and what I'd like
18        you to do as I move through the substance of
19        the claims against Philip Morris is to
20        remember, and bear this in mind, that if Philip
21        Morris did not exist, if Philip Morris had
22        never existed, and there never were any
23        cigarettes with the brand names of Marlboro or
24        Merit or Virginia Slims, the overwhelming
25        weight of the evidence is that Mr. Piendle

 1        would have smoked other available cigarettes,
 2        if Philip Morris brands never existed.
 3             Remember that when he started smoking,
 4        Charlie's father rolled his own cigarettes when
 5        he wasn't smoking nonfiltered, Charlie's mother
 6        smoked menthols, his friends, including his
 7        closest friends also smoked, but none of them
 8        smoked Marlboros.
 9             There's some testimony that he may have
10        smoked Marlboros on occasion in high school,
11        but there's no testimony that if Marlboro were
12        not available, then he would have quit smoking
13        rather than smoke another available brand.
14             If Philip Morris, in December of 1953,
15        when they came out of the Plaza Motel, decided
16        to shut the company down, fire all the
17        employees, cancel all the contracts with the
18        farmers and the wholesalers and the truckers
19        and let all the employees go, is there any
20        evidence, from what you know about Charlie
21        Piendle, what you have been told about Charlie
22        Piendle by the plaintiffs, that would lead you
23        to believe he would never have started smoking
24        or would have stopped?
25             Now, all the testimony from the plaintiffs

 1        is exactly the opposite.  There's no evidence 2        in the record that Philip Morris' marketing
 3        targeted young Charlie Piendle.  The only
 4        evidence of any male ad is from 1956 or 1957
 5        where there's the really angry smoker in the
 6        ad, and there's no indication that Charlie
 7        Piendle ever saw that.
 8             You'll recall that that was at the time
 9        when Marlboro was transitioning from a lady's
10        brand to a man's brand, and still six years
11        before Marlboro country came into being and the
12        Marlboro cowboy rode across the west in
13        Marlboro country.
14             You were shown the Julie London TV
15        commercial.  Now, Julie London -- and you
16        weren't told when it was run, except it was run
17        in the '50s, whether that was for the ladies or
18        the men, I don't know, I certainly liked the
19        ad, and in the 1950s, I'm sure my dad liked the
20        ad, but I don't believe any adolescent liked
21        the ad.
22             And, Will, can we have the first slide?
23             And you don't have to take my word for it,
24        this is the plaintiff's expert, Dr. Cummings.
25        "It is your opinion that the Julie London ad

 1        singing the Marlboro song in the darkened bar
 2        in the 1950s was an attempt to appeal to
 3        underage smokers?"
 4             Answer:  "I wouldn't say that, no."
 5             Did Mr. Piendle's family even have a
 6        television in the 1950s?  This is his brother's
 7        testimony, remember his brother is 11 years
 8        younger.  So in the '50s, this is what he
 9        recalled, "We didn't have television.  The only
10        thing on the radio were those shows our parents
11        listened to, except once in a while, I listened
12        to Floyd Patterson fights with my father."
13             Those were the only ads you were shown
14        from Philip Morris before Mr. Piendle left for
15        the Marines and pretty much disappears from the
16        evidence until about 1968.
17             The instructions you have is that the
18        defendants have a right to advertise and they
19        cannot be liable unless there's something
20        false, misleading, or deceitful in their
21        statements.  There's nothing false, misleading,
22        or deceitful in any of the ads you've seen from
23        Philip Morris that are in the 1950s, either the
24        tattoo man or the Julie London ad, and there's
25        no connection whatsoever to Mr. Piendle.

 1             So point No. 1, there's nothing that
 2        Philip Morris did or didn't do that was a legal
 3        cause of Mr. Piendle's beginning to smoke.  If
 4        Philip Morris isn't responsible for Mr. Piendle
 5        beginning to smoke, then where is the evidence
 6        along the way of any wrongful conduct on the
 7        part of Philip Morris that is connected to
 8        Mr. Piendle smoking?
 9             I submit that there is a complete absence
10        of any evidence connecting Philip Morris and
11        Mr. Piendle in any wrongful conduct on the part
12        of Philip Morris. 13             Let's review Mr. Piendle's smoking history
14        with respect -- specifically to Philip Morris.
15        His friend, Babe Cabral.  They didn't smoke
16        Marlboro when growing up.  He thinks
17        Mr. Piendle smoked Marlboro in the '70s.
18             His brother remembers seeing Mr. Piendle
19        with Marlboro during visits once or twice a
20        year in the '70s.
21             His daughter, who was born in 1970,
22        remembered the Marlboro when living in
23        Connecticut in the '70s, of course, she would
24        have been less than 10.  So she deferred to her
25        mother, admits her mother would have a better

 1        recollection of the brands Mr. Piendle smoked.
 2             His sister, Christy, seems to recall a red
 3        pack that could have been Marlboro or another,
 4        sometime in high school, and his best friend
 5        with whom he smoked in high school has no
 6        memory of Marlboro.
 7             And then his wife, Mrs. Piendle.  When she
 8        met Mr. Piendle in 1968, he was smoking
 9        Marlboro.  Within the year, he switched to her
10        brand.  Throughout their married life,
11        Mrs. Piendle bought the cigarettes they smoked.
12        So from 1969 on, Mrs. Piendle bought the
13        cigarettes.  She never bought Marlboro.
14        There's testimony that Mrs. Piendle bought
15        Merit in 1985 to 1989, and I'm going to talk
16        about that separately in a minute.  There's
17        testimony that Mrs. Piendle bought Virginia
18        Slims and Mr. Piendle had a Virginia Slim from
19        time to time, but when and how much is nowhere
20        to be found in the record.
21             One thing that is certain is that from
22        1968 on, when Mrs. Piendle can, for the first
23        time, identify Marlboro smoking for that year,
24        there would have been warnings on the packs of
25        Marlboros he smoked, just like on every pack of

 1        cigarette after 1966.
 2             Counsel, on opening of the closing,
 3        Mr. Barnhart, mentioned brand loyalty, made a
 4        big point about brand loyalty.  I think it's an
 5        important point too, because in one respect,
 6        Mr. Piendle is very unique.  In many respects
 7        he's unique, but as a smoker, he's unique in
 8        this respect.  He apparently had no brand
 9        loyalty whatsoever.  There isn't any history
10        that he has, over his 30 years, where he has
11        latched onto a particular brand of cigarette
12        and smokes that cigarette exclusively.  Among
13        the brands that he smoked were Camel, Lucky
14        Strikes, Pall Mall, Winston, Marlboro, Carlton,
15        Salem, Raleigh, Doral, Merit, Virginia Slims,
16        Tareyton, Viceroy, and Capri.
17             So the suggestion that he had a connection
18        to a particular brand because of advertising or
19        marketing of that brand is not supported in
20        this evidence that the plaintiffs presented to
21        you.  He did not smoke certainly any of the
22        Philip Morris brands with any regularity.  It
23        didn't appear that he smoked any brands with 24        any regularity or loyalty over the course of
25        his smoking history.

 1             So let's go back to the 1950s.  And assume
 2        that Mr. Piendle walks into the corner store in
 3        Connecticut when he's 16 and legal age, and he
 4        can buy cigarettes at 16 in Connecticut back
 5        then, and he goes up to the counter and he asks
 6        the clerk if he can have a pack of Marlboro,
 7        and the clerk says, I'm sorry, sir, I don't
 8        know what you're talking about, Philip Morris
 9        doesn't exist.
10             If Philip Morris didn't exist in the '50s,
11        would Mr. Piendle, based upon what you know
12        about Mr. Piendle from the evidence the
13        plaintiff's gave you, say, thank you very much,
14        I'm going to quit smoking, or would he say, I
15        think I'll take another brand?
16             In the '60s, in the '70s, in the '80s,
17        throughout his entire smoking history, on those
18        occasions when he would have a Marlboro, and
19        there were occasions when people saw him
20        smoking Marlboro, if Marlboro weren't there,
21        would he have quit smoking or would he have
22        smoked another available brand of cigarettes?
23             If he had never smoked Marlboro and just
24        smoked other brands, is there any evidence in
25        the record that those other brands would have

 1        been somewhat safer somehow?  Was there
 2        anything unique or unusual about Marlboro that
 3        made Marlboros somehow more dangerous or less
 4        safe than other brands?
 5             Well, here's what the plaintiffs told you
 6        on that point.  Are all commercial cigarettes
 7        equally dangerous?  Dr. Burns, yes;
 8        Dr. Benowitz, yes; and Dr. Cummings yes.
 9             If he had never smoked Marlboros, if
10        Marlboros never existed and he chose other
11        available cigarettes, would those other
12        cigarettes have been less addicting than
13        Marlboros, or did Marlboro have some special or
14        unique feature that made Marlboros somehow more
15        addicting than other brands?
16             Again, the plaintiffs provided you with
17        this information.  Are all commercial
18        cigarettes equally addictive?  Dr. Burns, yes;
19        Dr. Benowitz, yes; and Dr. Cummings, yes.
20             From my demonstratives, probably too much
21        of an eye test for you to see, but I have got
22        the trial transcript citations down at the
23        bottom.
24             The point that I'm making is a point that
25        all the lawyers you heard from so far have

 1        made, and that is, how do you apply the concept
 2        of legal cause to the evidence that you've been
 3        provided?  Legal cause is what defines legal
 4        responsibility in this case.  Legal cause is
 5        that principle of law by which some wrongful
 6        conduct or some product that may have caused
 7        harm is connected to legal responsibility to
 8        pay for that harm. 9             And it's defined very specifically in the
10        instructions, and I think we remember 30 days
11        ago, we may have had a discussion about the
12        need to understand the definitions, whether
13        it's a definition of addiction or now a
14        definition of legal cause before you try and
15        reach a conclusion about whether legal cause
16        exists.
17             So legal cause has a portion of the
18        instruction that repeats itself throughout the
19        instructions.  So in this blank spot you might
20        see addiction or negligence, for example, and
21        then the definition of legal cause.
22             So let's say negligence is a legal cause
23        of loss, injury, or damage if it directly and
24        in natural and continuous sequence produces or
25        contributes substantially to producing such

 1        loss, injury, or damage such that it can
 2        reasonably be said that but for the negligence,
 3        the loss, injury, or damage would not have
 4        occurred.  That's a mouthful, and it might take
 5        a while to understand it, so I've broken it
 6        down a little bit.
 7             A is a legal cause of B if it directly and
 8        in natural and continuous sequence produces or
 9        contributes substantially to producing B, such
10        that it can reasonably be said that but for A,
11        B would not have occurred.
12             All right.  We're getting maybe a little
13        bit more simplified.  But for cause in the
14        chain of causation, A is in the chain of
15        causation leading to B.  The question for legal
16        cause is, if A goes away, does B go away?  If A
17        goes away and B goes away, then A was a but-for
18        cause of B.  If A goes away and B does not go
19        away, then A is not a but-for cause of B.
20             Let me give you an example.  I've got to
21        be at work at 9:00 o'clock in the morning, so I
22        get up and I shower and I have breakfast and I
23        read the paper and I go to the train station
24        and I get on the train on the Marlboro car, and
25        I ride to work and I get to work at 8:30, half

 1        an hour early.
 2             The question is, is getting on the
 3        Marlboro car a legal cause of my getting to
 4        work early?  Well, the answer to that question,
 5        you take A away and see what happens.  Well, I
 6        got up, showered, breakfast, paper, went to the
 7        train station, didn't get on the Marlboro car,
 8        got on the other cigarette car on the train,
 9        arrives at the train station the same time, I
10        arrive at work at exactly the same time.
11             So if there's another cigarette car
12        available for me to take on that train, the
13        fact that I took the Marlboro car is not a
14        but-for cause of my getting to work at 8:30.
15             All right.  Let's bring it back to this
16        case.  Mr. Piendle got on the cigarette train
17        in the 1950s, and from time to time got on --
18        got on or got in the Marlboro car on that
19        train.  He didn't stay in there very long.  He 20        got in a lot of other cigarette cars on that
21        train over the course of his 30-year history.
22             Is getting on that Marlboro car or getting
23        in that Marlboro car on the occasions he did a
24        but-for cause of his getting lung cancer, or if
25        Marlboro didn't exist, if Marlboro and Philip

 1        Morris never existed, would B still have
 2        happened, would he still have smoked, would he
 3        just have chosen other cigarettes, or would he
 4        have quit because he couldn't get Marlboro?
 5             All the evidence you have in the case
 6        suggests that he would have selected one of the
 7        many other brands he was wanting to smoke.
 8        There's no indication that if Philip Morris
 9        brands weren't there, he would have stopped
10        smoking.
11             Marlboro cigarettes are not a legal cause
12        of Mr. Piendle's death because they can be
13        removed from the chain of causation, and the
14        result wouldn't change at all.  Legal cause
15        requires but-for causation, and the evidence
16        just won't support the conclusion that but for
17        smoking Marlboros, Mr. Piendle would have been
18        just fine.
19             Did any of the plaintiff's experts,
20        Dr. Burns, Dr. Cummings or Dr. Benowitz,
21        testify that smoking Marlboro on the occasions
22        he did was a substantial contributing factor
23        and a but-for legal cause of Mr. Piendle's lung
24        cancer?
25             Check your notes for those three

 1        witnesses, but I'll tell you what I think
 2        you're going to find, they did not.
 3             Mrs. Piendle's witnesses never attempted
 4        to tie the Marlboro smoking as a legal cause of
 5        Mr. Piendle's lung cancer.  In fact, the only
 6        witness who was asked a question that was
 7        somewhat similar was Dr. Benowitz, and I asked
 8        Dr. Benowitz this question.
 9             "All right.  Now, in 1964, if Philip
10        Morris and Reynolds had removed from the market
11        all of their cigarette products, were there
12        other cigarette products remaining?"
13             Answer:  "Yes."
14             Question:  "Were those cigarette products
15        that remained in the absence of Philip Morris
16        and Reynolds products addicting?"
17             "Yes."
18             "Just as addicting as Philip Morris and
19        Reynolds products in your view?"
20             Answer:  "Yes."
21             And I told you I was going to talk to you
22        very briefly about Merit.  Whether or not Merit
23        is a legal cause is also dependent upon not
24        anything the defendants said, but what
25        Dr. Burns said.  You will remember Dr. Burns

 1        said that the lung cancer was caused by a
 2        long-term exposure to cigarette smoking, and
 3        that to have avoided getting lung cancer,
 4        Mr. Piendle would have had to have stopped 5        smoking in 1974.
 6             By 1985, by 1985, when -- I'm sorry, 1984,
 7        when Mrs. Piendle bought Merits for the two of
 8        them, Dr. Burns indicated that Mr. Piendle had
 9        gone beyond the point of no return for his lung
10        cancer.
11             And so when you look at the chain of
12        causation and you see the Merits way down the
13        end of the chain of causation, toward the end
14        of the 30 years, Dr. Burns' testimony indicates
15        that if you take out all of the Merit smoking
16        from '84 on, Mr. Piendle's lung cancer still
17        occurs, and that is the information provided by
18        the plaintiffs that you put into the legal
19        cause standard to try and assess whether the
20        smoking of Philip Morris products are a legal
21        cause of Mr. Piendle's lung cancer.
22             There's also some testimony about Virginia
23        Slims, but there isn't any evidence of how much
24        or when sufficient to allow you to determine
25        whether it's a legal cause of the lung cancer,

 1        where it fits into the chain of causation at
 2        all.
 3             And that's the plaintiff's burden to
 4        establish, legal cause is the plaintiff's
 5        burden to establish.  None of what I've talked
 6        about so far does the defendants have any
 7        burden to establish.  These are all elements
 8        the plaintiff has to establish.
 9             All right.  New topic.  Plaintiffs made
10        claims about Philip Morris and the claim that
11        Philip Morris concealed information from the
12        public health community.  And I'm going to
13        start this discussion, if I could, with one of
14        the jurors' questions to Dr. Cummings after he
15        finished his entire day and a half or so of
16        testimony.  "What responsibility do you believe
17        the public health community or U.S. government
18        agencies have to smokers of the '50s and '60's,
19        and if so, what?"
20             And Dr. Cummings said, well, their
21        responsibility was to support research, the
22        smoking, and basically put out information that
23        they had based on that research and regulate
24        the -- based on the findings from that
25        research, as was made public to them as to the

 1        actions that would affect the public health's
 2        health.  And then he said the job of the
 3        government is to protect the government's
 4        health.
 5             When you go through the evidence, please
 6        remember that the public health community
 7        consists of a lot of different people and
 8        organizations, and over time it is not
 9        particularly clear that all those
10        organizations, all those members of the public
11        health community agreed with each other about
12        what was the best way to protect the public's
13        health.  And certainly what they think today is
14        different than what they thought back in the
15        '50s, '60s and '70s. 16             So when you talk about -- when you assess
17        and talk together about assessing the Philip
18        Morris conduct with respect to the public
19        health organizations, please remember what the
20        public health organizations were saying at the
21        time the conduct was going on and not at a
22        later time.
23             Here's some examples.  With respect to
24        denicotinized products, Dr. Cummings supports
25        it, the Council for Tobacco-Free Kids called it

 1        the most dangerous product on the market, and
 2        the Tobacco Working Group thought rather than
 3        denicotinizing cigarettes, the nicotine should
 4        be increased.  You may remember that from the
 5        NCI Tobacco Working Group testimony.
 6             Should cigarettes be banned?  Dr. Cummings
 7        says sure, and the companies should be driven
 8        out of business, but the Surgeon General and
 9        Dr. Burns recognize that society accepts
10        smoking as a legal adult personal health
11        choice.
12             This may have surprised some of you.  With
13        respect to whether smoking causes an increase
14        in lung cancer risks for women, Dr. Cummings
15        says the health risks were established by 1958.
16        Dr. Burns, check your notes, says there was
17        confusion up until the Surgeon General's report
18        in 1980.  Two members of the public health
19        community coming up with completely different
20        opinions.
21             Back to the '50s.  Dr. Burns agreed that
22        the public health community in the '50s was
23        promoting the development and marketing of
24        low-tar and nicotine cigarettes.  Dr. Wynder
25        had recommended that -- in 1957, that in the

 1        '60s, tar and nicotine levels should be reduced
 2        by 40 percent.
 3             And you saw that indeed they were.  And
 4        that was what was supposed to be done back in
 5        the '50s and '60s, that's what the companies
 6        did in response to the public health
 7        community's urging them to do so to protect the
 8        public health.
 9             Then plaintiff claimed that Philip Morris
10        concealed from the public health community the
11        fact that people who switched to a lower tar
12        and nicotine cigarette may smoke differently or
13        smoke more cigarettes.  Please remember, the
14        1979 Surgeon General's report in which the
15        Surgeon General noted that the preponderance of
16        the scientific evidence continues, as in 1966,
17        to suggest that cigarettes with lower tar and
18        nicotine are less hazardous.  It has become
19        clear in the years since, however, that in
20        presenting this information to the public, they
21        should be warned that in shifting to a less
22        hazardous cigarette, they may, in fact,
23        increase their hazard if they begin smoking
24        more cigarettes or inhaling more deeply.
25             So the Surgeon General of the public
7063 1        health community was not uninformed about this
 2        issue in 1979 or in 1966.  In 1981, the point
 3        was reinforced once again.
 4             The plaintiff claims that Philip Morris
 5        knew and concealed from the public health
 6        community the fact that the smoking machines
 7        that measured the tar and nicotine yields don't
 8        smoke like people smoke.  Philip Morris knew
 9        that, but didn't tell the public health
10        community.
11             Here is a letter to the FTC concerning
12        smoking machines in which the government is
13        informed, the OGG method, one of the methods
14        for measuring tar and nicotine, does not and
15        cannot measure these many variations in human
16        smoking habits.  It does not measure
17        particulate matter or nicotine in the smoke
18        generated while the cigarette is not being
19        puffed.  It does not measure all the
20        particulate matter or nicotine in any
21        cigarette, but only that in the smoke drawn in
22        the standardized machine smoking according to
23        the prescribed method.  These basic
24        standardizations are well-understood by all
25        technologists in talking about any testing

 1        method.  And Philip Morris is one of the
 2        signatories on that letter.
 3             We talked a little bit about the National
 4        Cancer Institute's Tobacco Working Group, 1968
 5        to 1978, which recommended design changes for a
 6        less hazardous cigarette, including
 7        reconstituted tobacco, expanded tobacco, porous
 8        paper, ventilation on the filter, improved
 9        filters, all of which were incorporated in
10        Philip Morris brands through the '60s, the
11        '70s, and '80s, and throughout that time period
12        and into the '80s -- throughout the '80s, the
13        tar and nicotine levels were driven downward
14        for the products that were made available.
15             THE CLERK:  Counselor, 20 minutes.
16             MR. KELLY:  I'm sorry?  20, thank you.
17             And there's no design improvement that has
18        been identified by any of the witnesses,
19        Dr. Burns, Dr. Cummings, Dr. Benowitz, that was
20        not incorporated into a product by Philip
21        Morris.
22             We'll talk a little bit about the
23        denicotinized cigarettes that Philip Morris
24        designed, manufactured, marketed.
25        Dr. Benowitz, Dr. Cummings talked a lot about

 1        it.  Put them on the market, nobody smoked
 2        them.  They went into storage for years.
 3        Dr. Benowitz needed some low-nicotine
 4        cigarettes for his research, asked Philip
 5        Morris for them, and they provided them to him,
 6        no strings attached.
 7             That's -- I don't think that can be
 8        characterized as not cooperating with the
 9        public health community, especially somebody
10        like Dr. Benowitz, a noted researcher in the
11        field of nicotine research. 12             Let me talk a little bit about some of the
13        documents you've been shown.  This is a 1961
14        Dr. Wakeham document that had the carcinogens
15        listed that had been reported in literature.
16        You were told that Philip Morris did not
17        provide the Surgeon General's committee with a
18        list of carcinogens that were contained in this
19        document.  That's why we had Dr. Farone's
20        videotape testimony provided to you in our
21        case, to establish that, yes, indeed, a list of
22        carcinogens consisting of almost 99 percent of
23        all the carcinogens they were aware of, or that
24        were known, was provided to the Surgeon
25        General's committee by Philip Morris.

 1             There's a claim that Philip Morris
 2        concealed information about nicotine, and I'm
 3        going to go through this very quickly, without
 4        speaking too fast, I hope, but in summary form.
 5             In 1972 -- actually, in 1969, document in
 6        evidence, Philip Morris' research chief asked
 7        the Board of Directors for funding to do
 8        scientific research into why people smoke.
 9             By 1972, the seminar in the Caribbean
10        organized by the tobacco industry inviting
11        all -- inviting independent scientists and
12        researchers, many of whom wrote with
13        Dr. Benowitz on future papers, attended the
14        seminar in 1972.  The papers presented there
15        were compiled in a book edited by Dr. Dunn of
16        Philip Morris, and which were the subject of
17        his speech in October of '72 and his newspaper
18        interview in October of '72 containing the
19        latest research on nicotine and its effect not
20        only on the biology, but the psychology of
21        smokers.  Articles in there that Dr. Benowitz
22        found helpful when he began his research in
23        1975.
24             The reason I bring that up is that this is
25        the absolute opposite of concealment, going to

 1        a seminar, publishing a book, giving a speech,
 2        and giving interviews.
 3             Plaintiffs have the burden to prove that
 4        Mr. Piendle relied on some statement from
 5        Philip Morris that was somehow concealed and
 6        would have made a difference if it had been
 7        removed from the chain of causation.
 8             Mr. Barnhart admitted in his closing, we
 9        can't prove that Mr. Piendle relied on any
10        particular statement.
11             Well, if that's the case, and I think that
12        is the case, then he cannot meet Mrs. Piendle's
13        burden of proof to establish that Mr. Piendle
14        relied on a statement containing information
15        that had been concealed.  I mean, we got that
16        admission in -- it came directly from
17        Mr. Barnhart, I don't dispute it, there is no
18        evidence that Mr. Piendle relied on anything
19        that Philip Morris said throughout his smoking
20        history, certainly not when he began, nothing
21        in 1968, and after that, there's not even any
22        indication that he was smoking Philip Morris 23        products on a regular basis.
24             A word on the punitive damages claim.  The
25        plaintiffs have to establish by clear and

 1        convincing evidence.  And I was listening to
 2        her Honor as she read the instruction, and it
 3        is a very powerful and significant instruction
 4        when clear and convincing is defined.  It's
 5        evidence that is precise, explicit, lacking in
 6        confusion, and of such weight that it produces
 7        a firm belief or conviction without hesitation,
 8        without hesitation.
 9             The evidence that the plaintiffs were
10        going to show you to convince you that Philip
11        Morris had some liability in this case was
12        based upon the testimony from a Dr. Farone that
13        Mr. Barnhart -- who Mr. Barnhart identified in
14        his opening statement.  Dr. Farone was a former
15        executive with the company who was going to
16        come in and testify in the plaintiff's case by
17        videotape of the various alleged misdeeds the
18        plaintiffs would be relying upon to prove
19        punitive damages and liability in this case.
20             Dr. Farone never testified in the
21        plaintiff's case.  When we brought him in our
22        case --
23             MR. SCAROLA:  Excuse me, your Honor, I'm
24        sorry.  It is entirely improper for counsel to
25        say what our intention was in calling

 1        Dr. Farone.  There simply is no evidence of
 2        that, and we didn't need to call Dr. Farone
 3        because the defense called them.
 4             MR. KELLY:  That's --
 5             MR. SCAROLA:  I would ask the Court to
 6        instruct the jury to disregard those comments.
 7             THE COURT:  I'll sustain the objection as
 8        far as suggesting an intention on plaintiff's
 9        part.
10             MR. KELLY:  Let me restate it then.
11             In plaintiff's opening statement, you were
12        introduced to Dr. Farone, an executive from
13        Philip Morris, who was to be called in the
14        plaintiff's case, according to plaintiff's
15        opening statement.  He was not called in
16        plaintiff's case, he was called in the defense
17        case to proven an allegation -- to disprove an
18        allegation the plaintiffs made about submitting
19        information to the Surgeon General.
20             He did not provide any detail about his
21        time at Philip Morris with respect to the
22        individuals he worked with, the documents he
23        was involved with, the programs he was involved
24        with, Philip Morris' intentions or activities
25        with respect to the cigarettes that he worked

 1        on, nothing, absolutely nothing.
 2             All you are left with with respect to
 3        Philip Morris are documents from which snippets
 4        of catchy phrases have been taken and put on
 5        the scales.  You look at those scales that
 6        Mr. Barnhart made use of in his opening, and
 7        I'd like you to do this.  If plaintiff wants to 8        put all the little snippets and the catchy
 9        phrases from those documents on their side of
10        the scale, then I think you ought to put in the
11        entire document, the rest of the story, the
12        document that puts those little snippets into
13        context on the other side, and you would see
14        that the full documentation completely
15        outweighs the little snippets.
16             When all is said and done with respect to
17        whatever Philip Morris cigarettes you find that
18        Mr. Piendle may have smoked, the basic claim is
19        that Philip Morris manufactured and sold them
20        and Mr. Piendle smoked them.  The law is the
21        manufacture and sale of cigarettes is a lawful
22        activity; therefore, her Honor instructs you
23        that the defendants cannot be held liable
24        merely for manufacturing, selling, or
25        advertising cigarettes.

 1             Gina, about how much time do I have?
 2             THE CLERK:  Ten minutes.
 3             MR. KELLY:  All right.  Perfect.  Thank
 4        you.
 5             Now, I'm sure in the rebuttal closing that
 6        the plaintiff has, that they'll spend a lot of
 7        time on the punitive damages aspect of the case
 8        and not very much time on the compensatory
 9        claim of Mrs. Piendle.  The compensatory claim
10        of Mrs. Piendle doesn't have a lot of evidence
11        that the plaintiffs put in that they can spend
12        much time talking with you about.  It's the
13        compensatory claim by Mrs. Piendle for the loss
14        of her husband's companionship and the pain and
15        suffering that accompanies that loss, that is
16        the basis of the money claim in this case by
17        Mrs. Piendle.
18             Now, you're not going to get to this issue
19        if you find that the legal cause hurdles have
20        not been overcome.  But let me talk a little
21        bit about the claim for compensatory damages.
22        Plaintiff has the burden of proof on this issue
23        as well.  This is -- this is kind of a unique
24        issue for the plaintiff, because unlike the
25        other claims in the case where you can -- you

 1        can call in documents from a website, for
 2        example, for this particular claim of
 3        Mrs. Piendle's loss of companionship,
 4        Mrs. Piendle and her family have pretty much
 5        all the evidence that's available.
 6             What's happened over the last 14 years,
 7        14 years of holidays and birthdays and
 8        vacations, family gatherings, the defendants
 9        don't have any of that information.
10        Mrs. Piendle has all that information.  Her
11        family has that information.  Her daughter has
12        that information.
13             So this is an issue in which the
14        plaintiffs have the burden of proof and all the
15        evidence.  You have to ask yourself whether
16        when you were presented with the plaintiff's
17        case on this issue, you were shown all the
18        pieces of the puzzle that makes up 19        Mrs. Piendle's life over the last 14 years.
20             When the plaintiffs were done with their
21        case, did you know really anything at all about
22        Mrs. Piendle's life over the last 14 years, or
23        did you have to wait for the defendants to try
24        and put before you evidence that is of a very
25        difficult nature to inquire about, it's a very

 1        personal area for Mrs. Piendle, but -- but it's
 2        the claim that's being made that requires the
 3        evidence.
 4             Mrs. Piendle is making a claim, the
 5        defendants aren't, but the defendants have an
 6        obligation to bring the evidence before you if
 7        we can, hopefully in a respectful, dignified
 8        way.  I hope that's the case.  I hope that's
 9        how you took it.  But the burden of proof is on
10        Mrs. Piendle.
11             One of the jurors asked the question at
12        the conclusion of her testimony:  "How has your
13        lifestyle been affected by Charlie's death?"
14             And Mrs. Piendle answered:  "I have -- I
15        don't have any best friend anymore."
16             I'm sorry to repeat this, Ms. Piendle.
17             "My daughter used to call us yin and yang.
18        I don't have -- I don't have any more of my
19        yang anymore.  It's very lonely.  I don't know
20        how else to explain.  It's not same."
21             I don't believe there's any doubt that
22        that is all true, just as I -- I don't think
23        there's any doubt that all this is true as
24        well.  And this comes from the family and it --
25        it starts -- it is more piece of the puzzle, if

 1        you will, that the family had available to
 2        bring to you that we obtained and provided,
 3        things like when Mrs. Piendle began dating, her
 4        four-year relationship with Mr. Rodriguez, and
 5        the testimony from her daughter is that they
 6        lived together.  That's what her daughter said.
 7        We presented that to you.
 8             Her engagement to Mr. Medina, the end of
 9        the engagement, her continuing friendship with
10        Mr. Rodriguez.  I'm not suggesting that this is
11        the complete picture of the -- of the puzzle
12        over the last 14 years, but it's what we have
13        available to provide you for your
14        consideration.
15             So when you consider, if you get to this
16        point in your deliberations of how to value the
17        loss of companionship, I think if you take what
18        Mrs. Piendle provided and you take what
19        Mrs. Piendle and her family provided over the
20        last 14 years, I think it's reasonable to
21        conclude that, respectfully, the loss of
22        companionship and the loss from the loss of
23        companionship, the pain and suffering from that
24        loss is greater initially, and then begins to
25        diminish over time as other aspects of her life

 1        begin to partially fill that void, and that we
 2        see over time that actually occurring.
 3             So the figures that Mr. Biersteker 4        provided you, I think, are consistent with the
 5        evidence provided over time, certainly over the
 6        last 14 years.  There's no precision to the
 7        numbers he provided, but the sense and the
 8        logic of those numbers is consistent with what
 9        the evidence is.
10             And so I would suggest to you that
11        following that method, more damages would be
12        allocated soon after, in 1996 and 1997, but as
13        relationships begin to grow, the amount is
14        lessened.
15             Now, whether it's a million or a million
16        and a half over all of this time, I couldn't be
17        that precise.  But those numbers reflect the
18        reality that we've been provided in this case,
19        the evidence concerning what's been
20        Mrs. Piendle's life from 1996 up to the present
21        time.
22             Let me talk just a little bit about
23        apportionment.
24             THE CLERK:  Counsel, two minutes.
25             MR. KELLY:  Thank you very much.

 1             As Dr. Benowitz said, addiction is all
 2        about the loss of control, and the loss of
 3        control can only be assessed when someone
 4        attempts to exert control.  The only time
 5        Mr. Piendle actually exerted control, as he's
 6        capable of doing, was in 1989.  And when you
 7        look at the consequence of his exerting control
 8        and the lack of any physical withdrawal
 9        symptoms, the lack of any relapse over the
10        balance of his life, the extent to which he was
11        in control becomes apparent, and there's no
12        explanation from the plaintiffs as to why he
13        could not have exercised that control before
14        1989, 1988, 1987, except that he did not want
15        to.
16             Mr. Piendle, in his late '40s started
17        riding motorcycles, started going to the gym,
18        started changing his life.  One of the things
19        he did was quit smoking because he wanted to.
20        That's the kind of person he was.  Nothing the
21        defendants did and nothing Philip Morris did
22        prevented him from quitting anytime sooner.  It
23        was his responsibility.
24             Counsel admits a partial responsibility.
25        I think if you asked Charlie Piendle who's

 1        responsible for your smoking, and who's
 2        responsible for your quitting, Charlie Piendle
 3        would say, I am.  I'm a hundred percent
 4        responsible.  Who else?
 5             Now, Plaintiffs have the burden of proof
 6        in this case, so Plaintiffs get one more
 7        opportunity to try and convince you on all the
 8        issues that they're required to convince you on
 9        under the burden of proof.
10             One thing I want you to remember is that
11        no matter how impassioned or emotional or loud
12        closing argument becomes, that you as jurors
13        must remain detached, unemotional, objective.
14        The lady justice is blind.  She's blind to 15        emotion and she's blind to passion.  She's also
16        deaf to volume, but she hears the value that's
17        in there.
18             So please bear that in mind as you hear
19        the rebuttal argument.  We don't get a chance
20        to rebut the rebuttal, as hard as that will be,
21        but we do have the evidence you've seen, the
22        evidence you've received.  We have the law that
23        her Honor has given you.  We have your
24        unemotional, fair, objective assessment that
25        you'll begin tomorrow morning, next door, and

 1        that's enough for us.
 2             So I thank you very much this afternoon
 3        for your attention and your patience and your
 4        attention and patience over the last month
 5        we've been together.  Thank you very much.
 6             Thank you, your Honor.
