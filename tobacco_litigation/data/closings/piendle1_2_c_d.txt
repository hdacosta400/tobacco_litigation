14             MR. BIERSTEKER:  Thank you, your Honor.
15        May it please the Court, Counsel, Mrs. Piendle,
16        and, good morning, ladies and gentlemen of the
17        jury.
18             I want you to know initially that your
19        verdict in Phase I, the question of punitive
20        damages in this case, are all things that my
21        client takes very seriously.  That's the reason
22        that I brought my only witness, Mr. Tom~Adams,
23        here.  As counsel referred to, he is the chief
24        financial officer of Reynolds American.
25        Reynolds American is the parent company that

 1        owns the defendant in this case, R.J. Reynolds
 2        Tobacco Company.
 3             As Mr. Adams testified, specifically, the
 4        Piendle case itself has been discussed by the
 5        top management of Reynolds American, and as he
 6        also told you, he understands, respects, and
 7        accepts your verdict from Phase I.
 8             Now, you've already awarded compensatory
 9        damages in this case, and those are meant to
10        compensate Mrs. Piendle fully for the damages
11        that she sustained.  In other words, you looked
12        at her loss of companionship and the
13        accompanying pain and suffering, and you
14        compensated her for that loss.  You have made
15        her whole.
16             Punitive damages are different, and
17        they're different, I think, in four different
18        ways that I want to talk to you about this
19        morning.
20             First, punitive damages have nothing to do
21        with compensating Mrs. Piendle for her loss. 22        Punitive damages, instead, are an award of cash
23        over and above the amount that you determine
24        fully compensated Mrs. Piendle.  Every dollar
25        that you award to the plaintiff in punitive

 1        damages is over and above the amount that you
 2        determine fully compensates her.
 3             The second thing that I'd like you to keep
 4        in mind while you deliberate is to whom you may
 5        award punitive damages.  It is Mrs. Piendle,
 6        even though she's been fully compensated.
 7             MR. SCAROLA:  Excuse me.  Pardon me,
 8        your Honor.  That is entirely unsupported by
 9        the evidence, and there's nothing in the law in
10        that regard.  It is absolutely an irrelevant
11        consideration.
12             THE COURT:  Okay.  Overruled, consistent
13        with the Court's prior ruling.
14             MR. BIERSTEKER:  Thank you, your Honor.
15             You can only award punitive damages to
16        Mrs. Piendle, not to the American Cancer
17        Society or to the American Lung Association or
18        another organization.
19             The third thing that I'd like you to keep
20        in mind while you deliberate is that you
21        decided punitive damages in this case were
22        warranted because defendants placed on the
23        market defective and unreasonably dangerous
24        products.
25             You can impose punitive damages only for

 1        that conduct and nothing else.  You may not
 2        impose punitive damages for negligence; you may
 3        not impose punitive damages for concealment;
 4        you may not impose punitive damages because the
 5        companies agreed to conceal the other Engle
 6        findings.
 7             Again, the Court's instructions are your
 8        road map to filling out the verdict form.  You
 9        must follow the Court's instructions on the
10        law.  I know it's hard.  I know it takes time.
11        It did last time.  I suspect it might take some
12        time this time.
13             But as the Court already instructed you,
14        you may only award punitive damages against a
15        defendant for the defective and unreasonably
16        dangerous cigarettes placed on the market by
17        that defendant that you found were a legal
18        cause of Mr. Piendle's death.
19             The same is true of the evidence and the
20        findings that you heard about in Phase I.  As
21        the Court has already instructed you --
22             The next one, please, Will.  Thank you.
23             -- you may only consider evidence in the
24        first phase of the trial, including the Engle
25        findings, that relates to the defective and

 1        unreasonably dangerous cigarettes placed on the
 2        market by each defendant that you found were a
 3        legal cause of Mr. Piendle's death.
 4             Fourth, last point I want to keep in
 5        mind -- and I'm going to spend some time
 6        talking about this -- punitive damages serve  7        two purposes, deterrents and punishment.  And
 8        so I want to talk at some length about that in
 9        the remainder of time that I have available to
10        me, and I want to do that in the context of the
11        conduct that you found warranted the imposition
12        of punitive damages, the unreasonably dangerous
13        and defective cigarettes.
14             So let's start with deterrents, the first
15        purpose.  The question here is, is there a need
16        to deter R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in the
17        future from putting dangerous and --
18        unreasonably dangerous and defective products
19        on the market?  And I think a good place to
20        start is the fact that no cigarette is safe.
21        You've heard that.
22             They put up the testimony, for example, of
23        Dr. Figlar, who has said, well, every product
24        smoked by Mr. Piendle is unsafe.  Well, that's
25        true.  They can't be made safe, but that

 1        doesn't mean that they're unreasonably
 2        dangerous and defective.
 3             Sorry about that.
 4             All conventional cigarettes, as you know,
 5        are capable of causing lung cancer and have the
 6        potential to addict.  Again, that doesn't mean
 7        they're defective.  Cigarettes are not
 8        defective and unreasonably dangerous, just
 9        because they have inherent risks you can't do
10        anything about.  Rather, a defect is something
11        that Reynolds was capable of fixing and didn't
12        while still having a product that's acceptable
13        to consumers.
14             Okay.  I don't want to dwell on the
15        ancient past, but I do want to touch on it.
16        Mr. Barnhart was up here, and he said
17        R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company -- and I assume
18        by extension Philip~Morris -- couldn't care
19        less about unreasonably dangerous and defective
20        products.  So let's talk about that just
21        briefly with respect to the past, and then
22        we'll turn to the future.
23             The evidence has been that R.J. Reynolds
24        Tobacco Company established its
25        Research~& Development Department in the early

 1        1950s.  American Tobacco, which became part of
 2        Reynolds in 2004, as you heard, had its R & D
 3        Department even earlier, back in 1911.
 4             Reynolds was the first to publish the
 5        identities of between one-half and one-third of
 6        known constituents in cigarette smoke.  They
 7        rapidly reduced tar and nicotine yields, as
 8        urged by the public health community,
 9        throughout the time that Mr. Piendle smoked.
10        In fact, throughout the entire time he was
11        alive.
12             And you recall the public health
13        committee, Dr. Wynder, in the mid-1950s saying
14        reduce tar and nicotine by 40 percent, and that
15        Reynolds had actually accomplished that on a
16        sales-weighted average basis sometime in the
17        1960s. 18             Selective reduction.  You've heard about
19        how the company had selectively reduced harmful
20        constituents in cigarette smoke, including
21        phenols, cilia stats, and the tobacco-specific
22        nitrosamines.  Remember the heat exchangers in
23        the barns of farmers, that Reynolds encouraged
24        and got farmers to use.
25             They pursued, sometimes successfully and

 1        sometimes unsuccessfully, other reasonable
 2        suggestions by the public health community
 3        about how to make a safer cigarette, for
 4        example, changing tar and nicotine ratio or
 5        increasing smoke pH.
 6             And Mr. Barnhart said when he was up here,
 7        golly, would the world have been different if
 8        tobacco companies had only cooperated with the
 9        government with respect to the nature and the
10        design of their products?  He seems to have
11        forgotten that for ten years they did precisely
12        that with the National Cancer Institute less
13        hazardous cigarette program.  And did that
14        result in a safe cigarette?  No, because it
15        can't be done.
16             You also heard testimony that my client
17        researched nicotine analogues in the 1980s with
18        the thought that it might have the same
19        pharmacological effects as naturally occurring
20        nicotine, but be less addictive.  Again, it
21        didn't pan out.
22             You heard from Drs. Cummings and Figlar
23        that the individual cigarette companies pursued
24        product development efforts independently.  And
25        they did, they are competitors.  But they

 1        collectively financed basic medical and
 2        scientific research on the diseases associated
 3        with smoking through the American Medical
 4        Association and other institutions, including
 5        the Council for Tobacco Research, and you heard
 6        the testimony that the recipients of that
 7        funding included Nobel prizewinners, resulted
 8        in thousands of publications in the
 9        peer-reviewed literature and included 6- or 700
10        articles cited by the Surgeon General.
11             Now, Mr. Scarola, in his closing last time
12        out, and introduced into evidence in this
13        phase, a 1969 document from my client that he
14        argued showed destruction or alteration of
15        research and development reports.  I didn't get
16        a chance to stand up and talk to you after he
17        showed that to you last time out, so I just
18        wanted to briefly touch on it as part of the
19        ancient past.
20             If I could have the last sentence of that
21        exhibit.
22             "We are awaiting a decision as to the
23        action to be taken with respect to the reports
24        in question."  And the truth is that plaintiff
25        presented no evidence that the reports were

 1        actually destroyed as a result of this
 2        memorandum.  Dr. Figlar testified he didn't see  3        any evidence to that effect, and you heard from
 4        Dr. Cummings that there are 60 million pages of
 5        internal company tobacco documents available to
 6        the public today.
 7             But whether or not this memo explains the
 8        fact, as Dr. Figlar testified, that there are
 9        some reports from the 1980s that cannot be
10        located today, which Dr. Figlar doubted, is not
11        my point.  My main point is this, because we're
12        talking about deterrents, it cannot happen
13        again.
14             As you heard, new documents are constantly
15        being added to the publicly available websites
16        of internal company documents, including
17        documents that were recently written, not just
18        those from decades ago.
19             Another point, as Dr. Adams -- I mean,
20        Mr. Adams and Dr. Lipowicz explained, starting
21        in June of last year, research and development
22        documents are getting produced to the FDA.  Not
23        going to happen again.
24             You know, I heard Mr. Barnhart talk about,
25        you know, the Plaza Hotel and denials.  I don't

 1        think that's really related to unreasonably
 2        dangerous and defective cigarettes, but you saw
 3        the website excerpts from my client where it
 4        does say that smoking is the leading
 5        preventable cause of death, where it says that
 6        nicotine and tobacco products are addictive.
 7             Once upon a time, you saw a document from
 8        Claude Teague that said, oh, my goodness, if
 9        people quit, we could go out of business, and
10        now the website says the first thing smokers
11        should do is quit.
12             You also know that Tobacco Institute and
13        CTR are gone, at least since 1988, and that
14        many of the people who authored the exhibits
15        upon which plaintiff's case depends in this
16        case, Claude Teague, gone; Frank Colby, gone;
17        Murray Senkus, gone; Alan Rodgman, gone.
18             You heard in this case in Phase II
19        testimony from Mr. Heimann, the CEO of American
20        Tobacco Company, he quit there in 1980, he
21        never worked for Reynolds.  He's been gone for
22        over 30 years.
23             But I really want to focus with that brief
24        overview on the past on the present.  And so
25        let's talk about research and development

 1        efforts, product development initiatives in the
 2        recent past, about the Premier story, about
 3        Eclipse, about Snus, about Niconovum.
 4             But first, what is the guiding philosophy
 5        that guides Reynolds' research and development
 6        efforts in the 21st Century, and you heard that
 7        from Mr. Adams, and it's harm reduction.  What
 8        did he mean by that?  He meant don't make it
 9        worse, make it better where you can, and
10        encourage the use of lower risk products, all
11        of which is occurring against the backdrop of
12        FDA regulation of tobacco products, including
13        design and, among other things, Reynolds must 14        produce health-related documents, we just
15        talked about that, obtain FDA preapproval for
16        new products, the FDA has the ability to impose
17        requirements on tar and nicotine yields and the
18        yields of other harmful components, and the
19        companies have to report a list of ingredients,
20        as well as harmful constituents, and you also
21        heard about how at least additives have been
22        disclosed to the Department of Health and Human
23        Services since 1986, I believe.
24             Okay.  I want to talk about a couple of
25        specific examples of Reynolds' research and

 1        development efforts with respect to cigarette
 2        design in the recent past and continuing today.
 3             I want to start with Premier.  It was the
 4        first tobacco-heating cigarette.  There were
 5        dramatic reductions in harmful constituents.
 6        For example, benzo(a)pyrene is essentially
 7        gone.  This is a standard, as you recall,
 8        standard light cigarette made by the University
 9        of Kentucky, used for research purposes 9.2,
10        with Premier, it was 8/100, much, much smaller,
11        virtually gone.  It was a virtually no tar
12        cigarette, is what it was, and it was all about
13        health and safety.
14             Now, if they only in test markets.  People
15        didn't buy it, bunch of reasons, hard to light,
16        didn't burn down, you heard that from
17        Dr. Figlar.  We also heard about the
18        government's threat to make it available only
19        by prescription.
20             But Reynolds didn't give up on
21        tobacco-heating technology.  It developed a
22        second generation product called Eclipse, and
23        it was all about health and safety.  Eclipse
24        was first marketed in 1996.  As Dr. Figlar
25        testified, the company continued to improve it,

 1        it's still on the market today, it's available
 2        not just on the Internet, as I think
 3        Dr. Cummings incorrectly suggested, but also in
 4        stores like 7-Eleven, including here in
 5        Florida.
 6             And you heard Mr. Adams, Reynolds loses
 7        money on every pack of Eclipse cigarettes it
 8        sells, it's not about money.  You heard
 9        Mr. Adams, Eclipse has a very small market
10        share, it's not just about market share.
11        Reynolds believes in its potential, it's all
12        about health and safety.
13             Let's talk about Snus.  Reynolds advises
14        smokers who are concerned about their health to
15        quit.  That's the first thing they tell them.
16        You heard that from Mr. Adams.  For adults who
17        cannot or will not quit, Reynolds acknowledges
18        that no tobacco has been shown to be safe.
19        Again, there's no such thing as a safe tobacco
20        product, it cannot be done.  But the company
21        also encourages adults who are cigarette
22        smokers who will not or cannot quit tobacco
23        products to switch from cigarettes to lower
24        risk products.  And to that end, Reynolds has 25        developed and marketed Snus, you saw the little

 1        can up on the screen a number of times, as well
 2        as dissolvables, both of them are smokeless
 3        tobacco products.
 4             For instance, you heard from Dr. Figlar
 5        that the epidemiology with respect to Snus
 6        shows that it has a much lower risk of disease
 7        than cigarettes, including a lower risk of oral
 8        cancer.  And you heard Dr. Figlar testify that
 9        from a scientific perspective, Snus has been
10        shown to be considerably safer than smoking.
11             Reynolds, as you learned from Mr. Adams,
12        believes in this approach, it communicates to
13        the public that migrating to smoke-free
14        products could achieve significant reductions
15        in harm.  And Reynolds is engaged in an ongoing
16        dialogue with public health community about
17        this strategy and other topics, the
18        stakeholders.
19             Briefly, Niconovum.  Dr. Figlar and
20        Mr. Adams also told you about the new ownership
21        interest in Niconovum.  That's the Swedish
22        nicotine replacement therapy company.  It's
23        another commitment to harm reduction.  If given
24        FDA approval, these nicotine replacement
25        products will be available to smokers in the

 1        United States who desire to use those products
 2        to quit smoking or as an alternative to any
 3        tobacco product, if they wanted to continue to
 4        use it for nicotine.
 5             So as you have seen the present
 6        R.J. Reynolds, for a long time now, is
 7        committed to producing cigarettes under its
 8        harm reduction strategy, recognizing that they
 9        cannot succeed in making any cigarette safe;
10        encouraging those who will not or cannot quit,
11        to switch to reduced risk smokeless tobacco
12        products; to helping those who need nicotine
13        replacement or want nicotine replacement
14        therapy to quit through Niconovum, and they're
15        doing all of this under the jurisdiction of the
16        FDA.
17             Mr. Barnhart, I think, said in his closing
18        just a few minutes ago that this is your
19        opportunity to put an end to misconduct.  And I
20        would suggest to you that the evidence, at
21        least with respect to conduct that is pertinent
22        to punitive damages in this case, unreasonably
23        dangerous and defective cigarettes, is not
24        something that needs deterrents.
25             Let's talk about punishment, and I saved

 1        that topic for last because it inevitably
 2        involves money.  It's about how much more
 3        money, if any, you are going to award
 4        Mrs. Piendle.
 5             So let's talk about money.  And
 6        Mr. Barnhart said it's the American way, it's
 7        got nothing against profits.  You heard about
 8        profits from time to time.  And I guess the
 9        starting point is I agree with him, that you 10        cannot punish Reynolds merely for selling
11        cigarettes or for making a profit.  That's not
12        what this is about.
13             Cigarettes with nicotine, as your Honor
14        instructed you in Phase I, are a legal product.
15        That's what she told you, and still true.
16        Cigarettes with nicotine are lawful to
17        manufacture and lawful to sell.  And as you
18        heard, it wasn't always so.  Remember, the
19        State of Florida, you heard from Dr. Norrell,
20        and other states in this country once banned
21        the sale of cigarettes back in the early part
22        of the 1900s, but we, as a society, decided
23        that we're going to make cigarettes legal
24        despite the fact that they're dangerous, and
25        the way we're going to do deal with it is

 1        through government regulation, taxation,
 2        warnings, and other forms of regulation.  And
 3        again, no cigarette is safe.  They're all
 4        capable of causing lung cancer, and if they
 5        have nicotine, they all have the potential to
 6        addict.
 7             Reynolds can't be punished for selling a
 8        product with an inherent risks that cannot be
 9        eliminated and that would still be acceptable
10        to consumers.
11             What do I mean by that?  Now, again, this
12        is one of the things that Mr. Scarola put up on
13        the board after I sat down last time around,
14        and said what if they'd only sold the safest
15        products?
16             Well, companies don't have an obligation
17        to sell only the safest products, and let me
18        explain.  No car manufacturer sells only the
19        safest products.  If they did, we'd all be
20        driving Volvos or Hummers.  Maybe a tank that
21        goes 10 miles an hour tops.
22             But the truth is, some drivers prefer
23        economy, so there are Mini Coopers out there,
24        probably not as safe, they're small, get
25        crushed.  Some drivers prefer speed and style,

 1        give them a sports car, not the safest product
 2        on the road.  Others, like Mr. Piendle, liked
 3        motorcycles, certainly not the safest means of
 4        transportation available.  The same is true
 5        with fast food, McDonald's sells salads and
 6        McDonald's sells Big Macs and fries.  And the
 7        same is true of cigarettes.  Some people prefer
 8        unfiltered cigarettes, they do.  Not as safe,
 9        in our view, in Reynolds' view, as you heard
10        from Dr. Figlar and heard from Dr. Lipowicz, as
11        filtered cigarettes, Dr. Burns might have a
12        different view, but some people like unfiltered
13        cigarettes.
14             Most smokers still prefer the conventional
15        tobacco burning cigarettes over smokeless
16        products or tobacco-heating cigarettes are
17        available.  And as you heard with respect to
18        nicotine-free products, next to nobody ever
19        bought them.  They were all commercial failures
20        and, importantly, the Piendles never smoked the 21        brands that were on the market that, according
22        to Dr. Benowitz and Dr. Cummings, were safer
23        than the brands that they chose.
24             Okay.  Second, let's talk a little bit
25        about financial resources.  My client is not

 1        here to plead poverty, as Mr. Adams explained.
 2        In 2009, the company's net income was
 3        $930 million, and that's a lot of money.
 4             THE CLERK:  Ten minutes left.
 5             MR. BIERSTEKER:  Thank you.
 6             But plaintiff suggested it was maybe even
 7        a little bit more and they put up on the screen
 8        here today in closing, the 6- to $7 billion in
 9        net worth, ignoring what Mr. Adams said was the
10        context, and namely, that's the nearly
11        $8 billion of goodwill.  Goodwill does not
12        represent a tangible asset that can be sold for
13        cash.
14             Now, at the close of plaintiff's case, and
15        I'm not sure how Mr. Scarola, I assume, when he
16        stands up in rebuttal is going to use this, but
17        they played an excerpt or read an excerpt from
18        the deposition of Mr. Heimann and he joked
19        about how short it was.  And I kind of wanted
20        to address that.  Again, I don't know how he's
21        going to use it, but I suspect it might relate
22        to Mr. Adams' testimony.  So let me just start
23        and briefly comment on that.
24             Mr. Heimann was not a C.P.A., he was not
25        the chief financial officer of any company like

 1        Mr. Adams is.  Mr. Heimann retired as the chief
 2        executive officer of American Tobacco Company,
 3        not Reynolds, back in 1980, and he testified in
 4        1986 that, in theory, I think this is a pretty
 5        good paraphrase, in theory, shareholders'
 6        equity is the net amount of money that would be
 7        left after a company's assets are liquidated
 8        and the debts are paid.
 9             I would submit that his general theory
10        teaches us absolutely nothing about the
11        financial condition today of R.J. Reynolds with
12        its multibillion dollars of goodwill that
13        cannot be sold for cash.
14             Third point is this, no punitive damages
15        award in this case would be just a drop in the
16        bucket to my client, which is what I think
17        Mr. Barnhart was suggesting.
18             Why is that?  Let me explain.  Plaintiffs
19        in this case is one of thousands of smokers in
20        the families in Florida who are part of the
21        Engle class.  That means that thousands of
22        other Floridians can come into court, just as
23        Mrs. Piendle has --
24             MR. SCAROLA:  Pardon me, your Honor.  That
25        is clearly outside the evidence in this case

 1        and it is outside any instruction on the law
 2        and, if necessary, I would like to approach the
 3        bench with regard to this matter.
 4             THE COURT:  Counsel approach.
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
16        held within the presence of the jury:) 17             MR. BIERSTEKER:  As I said, the other
18        members of the Engle class had the same
19        opportunity that Mrs. Piendle has exercised
20        here to bring a case for both compensatory and
21        for punitive damages, and as you heard from the
22        experts who came in and testified about how
23        they had testified in other cases in Florida,
24        there are other such cases.  Each of those
25        individuals, just like Mrs. Piendle, has the

 1        opportunity to get both compensatory and
 2        punitive damages, nor is litigation against my
 3        client confined to the Engle cases.
 4             You heard from experts like Dr. Cummings,
 5        who had traveled around the country testifying
 6        in tobacco cases, including cases brought by
 7        the states in the 1990s, which were settled, as
 8        you heard, and for which defendants pay
 9        substantial sums each year into perpetuity.
10             The bottom line is this, you have the
11        discretion not to award punitive damages.
12        These are the Court's instructions.  In fact, I
13        think the first sentence appears in two of the
14        different instructions.  And as in Phase I, the
15        plaintiff in this phase has the burden of
16        proving the amount, if any, of punitive
17        damages.  And again, that means she starts in
18        the basement, has got to carry it with her all
19        the way up and establish by the greater weight
20        of the evidence the amount of punitive damages,
21        if any, that should be awarded.
22             So ask yourselves, in light of the
23        evidence, whether you should award any punitive
24        damages, and if you think you should do so,
25        please be thinking about the amount that would

 1        be reasonable.  And I think that the numbers,
 2        although not couched by Mr. Barnhart as a
 3        suggested amount of punitive damages, that he
 4        put up on the board are unreasonable, and let
 5        me explain to you why.
 6             I think they are unreasonable given that
 7        cigarettes are legal, even though they are
 8        dangerous; given that cigarettes are dangerous
 9        by nature, not by design in the efforts that
10        these companies and Reynolds, in particular,
11        has made to try to reduce those risks; given my
12        client's current conduct, as described by
13        Mr. Adams and Dr. Figlar; given that any award
14        of punitive damages in this case would be above
15        and beyond the compensatory damages that you
16        have already awarded and that you have decided
17        have made Mrs. Piendle whole; given that this
18        is but one of many cases pending against
19        Reynolds or cases that could --
20             MR. SCAROLA:  Same objection, your Honor.
21             MR. BIERSTEKER:  -- be brought by other
22        members --
23             MR. SCAROLA:  Same objection, your Honor.
24             THE COURT:  Overruled.
25             MR. BIERSTEKER:  -- that could be brought

 1        by other members of the Engle class concerning  2        actions taken decades ago by people who are no
 3        longer with R.J. Reynolds; given that each and
 4        every one of the Engle class members has the
 5        same opportunity to seek compensatory and
 6        punitive damages in cases just like this one;
 7        and given the substantial settlement payments
 8        made to the states each year that will last for
 9        forever.
10             MR. SCAROLA:  Pardon me, your Honor.
11        There is no evidence whatsoever regarding any
12        substantial amount ever paid to anyone by these
13        defendants or any other tobacco company.
14             THE COURT:  I'll sustain.  I'll allow you
15        to reference to the extent that it's on the
16        financial or through the testimony.
17             MR. BIERSTEKER:  When you get back to the
18        jury room, take a look at, and maybe counsel
19        for Philip Morris will bring this out, but if
20        you look at the financial statements admitted
21        into evidence for Philip Morris, one of the
22        line items is the state settlement payments
23        that they made last year.
24             Given all of that, I suggest that the
25        evidence in this case does not warrant the

 1        imposition of punitive damages, but I realize
 2        you might disagree with me, it's happened
 3        before, and if you do, let me suggest an
 4        amount.
 5             It is just my suggestion, but here it is,
 6        $900,000.  And let me explain why I think that
 7        amount is reasonable.  It's not an
 8        insubstantial amount of money.  Awarding
 9        another $900,000 against my client,
10        R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, means that it
11        would owe $2 million, half of the $4 million in
12        compensatory damages that you awarded, and
13        $900,000 is $100,000 for each year,
14        approximately nine years, from the time that
15        Mr. Piendle likely started smoking in about
16        1957 on a regular basis up until 1966 when the
17        packs carried the warnings, and that includes
18        two years after the Surgeon General's report in
19        1964.  So if you decide that an award of
20        punitive damages other than zero is appropriate
21        in this case, I ask that you consider the
22        amount that I have suggested when you
23        deliberate.
24             Let me start where I think we began this
25        case about a month and a half ago and, yes, in

 1        some ways, it seems longer ago than that.
 2             THE CLERK:  Three minutes.
 3             MR. BIERSTEKER:  Thank you.
 4             Thank you on behalf of Reynolds, as well
 5        as myself, Liza Kessler, John Wiederhold, and
 6        Will Farrell, who has been laboring back there
 7        in the back this entire time.
 8             We know you spent a lot of time listening
 9        to evidence and we know you spent a lot of time
10        carefully considering your verdict in Phase I.
11        We are confident that you will do the same
12        thing as you deliberate in the final phase of 13        this case, there's no Phase III.
14             We know it isn't easy to serve as a juror
15        in any case.  We know that for some of you in
16        particular, it has been an outright hardship to
17        have served for this long in this case, and as
18        Mr. Barnhart said, rest assured that everybody
19        here in this courtroom deeply appreciates your
20        service.
21             So thank you, I appreciate your attention,
22        and I have confidence that you will be just to
23        my client.  Thank you.


14        CLOSING ARGUMENT
24             MR. KELLY:  Thank you, your Honor.
25             Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,

 1        welcome back.  I'll be talking to you for about
 2        30 more minutes.  It's the last time I'll have
 3        a chance to talk directly to you, big sigh of
 4        relief, I'm sure, until after the case is over.
 5             May it please the Court and Mrs. Piendle,
 6        Counsel.
 7             When we received your verdict a week or so
 8        ago, we studied it very hard.  We took a long
 9        look at what you found and what you didn't find
10        to try and understand, without talking to you
11        about the reasoning for your verdict, what you
12        were trying to tell us by that verdict, so that
13        when we get to this phase, we could understand
14        what information might be relevant to you to
15        make your determinations in this phase.
16             We had to do that kind of under the same
17        rules that you were operating under when you
18        looked at the findings, that they said what
19        they said, they didn't say more than they said,
20        and we couldn't guess or speculate about what
21        it was that you found in your verdict.
22             So with that caveat, let me show you what
23        I think, from your verdict form that you gave
24        us earlier, you were trying to tell us,
25        something more than that.

 1             Will, how are we doing?
 2             MR. FARRELL:  There you go.  3             MR. KELLY:  Thank you, Will.
 4             All right.  What your verdict told us,
 5        that the unreasonably dangerous and defective
 6        cigarettes did harm Mr. Piendle; that negligent
 7        conduct by the defendants did not harm
 8        Mr. Piendle; that concealment or omission of
 9        material information did not harm Mr. Piendle;
10        and that an agreement to conceal or omit
11        material information did not harm Mr. Piendle;
12        that the punitive conduct was based on placing
13        unreasonably dangerous and defective cigarettes
14        on the market; punitive conduct was not based
15        on negligent conduct, concealment, or omission
16        of material information, an agreement to
17        conceal or omit material information.
18             So your verdict told us that punitive
19        damages could only be considered in this phase
20        for placing unreasonably dangerous and
21        defective cigarettes on the market.  That's
22        what we were able to take from the verdict form
23        of Phase I of this case.
24             Plaintiff has argued to you as if you have
25        already decided to award punitive damages in

 1        this case.  The first phase determined only
 2        what conduct harmed Mr. Piendle and whether
 3        that conduct was bad enough to satisfy the
 4        criteria for punitive liability.  It is in this
 5        phase of the case when you determine whether or
 6        not any amount of punitive damages should be
 7        awarded based upon what you found in the
 8        earlier phase.
 9             In this phase, you will determine whether
10        there is a need for punishment and deterrents.
11        In this phase, you will determine whether
12        awarding Mrs. Piendle more money is necessary
13        under the law her Honor has given you.
14             You do not have to award any punitive
15        damages at all unless plaintiff has met her
16        burden of proof to persuade you that punitive
17        damages in 2010 are necessary for punishment
18        and deterrents for things that happened some
19        time ago, perhaps, a long time ago, and the
20        plaintiff has the burden of proof, once again.
21        Plaintiff bears the burden of proving the
22        amount, if any, of punitive damages.
23             Another instruction you will be following
24        in the jury room, you are to decide the amount
25        of punitive damages, if any, to be assessed as

 1        punishment and as a deterrent to others.
 2        That's what this phase of the case involves.
 3             You may, in your discretion, decline to
 4        assess punitive damages.  You may assess
 5        punitive damages against one defendant and not
 6        the other, or against more than one defendant.
 7        Punitive damages may be assessed against
 8        different defendants in different amounts, all
 9        based upon the evidence that you've been
10        provided not only in the first phase, which is
11        going to be limited, as her Honor has
12        instructed you, but the evidence you received
13        in this phase. 14             I want to make -- I'm not going to make
15        much mention of what you already decided,
16        because you already decided it.
17             But in Mr. Barnhart's opening statement,
18        he spent all his time talking about the
19        evidence that you've already reviewed and based
20        your decision on and, once again, he made
21        significant misrepresentations about the
22        documents related to Philip Morris.  And I want
23        to touch upon that very briefly because counsel
24        has mushed together the documents that you've
25        seen and has not separated them out as to the

 1        various defendants.
 2             There were two documents he talked about
 3        with respect to Philip Morris.  One was
 4        Mr. Johnston's report in 1966 of a survey that
 5        he had done of various cigarettes on the market
 6        that had marketed themselves then as health
 7        cigarettes.  And he found -- if you read the
 8        whole document, he found in his survey that the
 9        effective filtration cigarettes had no
10        differentiated filter.  They were all white.
11        They looked just like unfiltered cigarettes.
12             He found in the survey that was available
13        that the cigarettes that had a differentiated
14        filter, like a brown filter, were less
15        effective than the other cigarettes.  He
16        concluded, based upon the survey, that the
17        un -- the less effective cigarettes with the
18        filter, that you could see, sold more than the
19        effective cigarettes, on which you couldn't
20        differentiate a filter.
21             He concluded, and it's in the report, that
22        the public consumers thought the illusion of
23        filtration was more important than the fact of
24        filtration.  So when he gave his recommendation
25        as a demographer and a surveyor in that report,

 1        he said, "It's not only as important" -- "It's
 2        not only important to have an effective
 3        filtration cigarette, but the illusion
 4        filtration must be as important if you want to
 5        sell it, because that's what people buy."
 6             And the suggestion, back in 1966, that
 7        that was some fraud, is a complete
 8        mischaracterization and misrepresentation of
 9        that document.  It's taking that phrase out of
10        context.  It's a beautiful phrase for
11        plaintiff's counsel to use, but it's completely
12        out of context if you read that document.
13             And the second one, Dr. Dunn.  Dr. Dunn's
14        report in 1972 is the basis for the book that
15        was published, "Smoking Motives and
16        Incentives," that Dr. Benowitz relied upon when
17        he started researching in this area.  It is
18        completely irresponsible to suggest that the
19        company's knowledge of nicotine was hidden from
20        the public when it was actually publicized by
21        Dr. Dunn's book.  That's all I'm going to say
22        about it.  I'm going back to Phase II.
23             In Phase II, the plaintiff's evidence in
24        this case consisted entirely of money numbers. 25             Philip Morris presented to you in Phase II

 1        evidence, from Dr. Lipowicz, of the FDA Tobacco
 2        Control Act, of the MSA and the FSA, of the
 3        acceptance of the Institute of Medicine's
 4        recommendations concerning regulations of the
 5        voluntary acts of the company, and of
 6        Dr. Lipowicz's own works.
 7             Plaintiff has not met her burden of proof
 8        to establish that punitive damages in any
 9        amount should be awarded because in this case,
10        once again, you're using the scales of justice,
11        the same scales of justice you used for
12        Phase I, and you're putting the evidence that
13        you've received in this phase of the case on
14        the scales to balance, to see whether or not
15        there's a need today, in 2010, to punish the
16        company.
17             Mrs. Piendle has the burden of proof to
18        establish that it's necessary to serve the
19        purpose of punitive damages to award her more
20        money, not for compensation, but for the
21        purposes of punitive damages.  It needs to be
22        done in 2010 for some proper purpose today.
23             I want to note that although the Engle
24        class action has been a part of this case at
25        some earlier time and has been referenced over

 1        the course of this case, Mrs. Piendle's case is
 2        an individual case.
 3             You're being asked to award money to
 4        Mrs. Piendle, not to other members of the
 5        class.  They have the right to bring their own
 6        action for compensatory or punitive damages.
 7        So although you've heard reference to a class
 8        action, I'd like you to remember that this
 9        phase of the case and the earlier phase is only
10        about Mrs. Piendle and Mr. Piendle and not the
11        other members of the class.
12             You've been told about harm to other
13        people.  You are going to be instructed, you
14        have been instructed, and I know you'll follow
15        this instruction:  In determining the amount of
16        punitive damages, if any, you may not seek to
17        punish a defendant for any harms suffered by
18        any persons other than Charles Piendle.
19             Now, the evidence that you will be
20        considering in this phase of the case is
21        substantially less than the evidence you
22        considered in Phase I because of your findings.
23        You may only consider evidence from the first
24        phase of the trial, including the Engle
25        findings, that relates to the defective and

 1        unreasonably dangerous cigarettes placed on the
 2        market by each defendant that you found were a
 3        legal cause of Mr. Piendle's death.
 4             In the first phase of this trial, you
 5        found that defective and unreasonably dangerous
 6        cigarettes placed on the market by each
 7        defendant were a legal cause of Mr. Piendle's
 8        death.  Consequently, you may only award
 9        punitive damages against the defendant for the 10        defective and unreasonably dangerous cigarettes
11        placed on the market by the defendant that you
12        found were a legal cause of Mr. Piendle's
13        death.  Those are the instructions you're bound
14        by and you're guided by in your deliberations.
15             What they mean is that the time limit for
16        the conduct you can consider punishing for
17        stops whenever it is that you found dangerous
18        and defective cigarettes to have caused
19        Mr. Piendle's death.  It can be no later than
20        1989 when he stopped smoking.  It could be some
21        earlier time.  I don't know what you decided,
22        but it could be no later than 1989.  So we're
23        dealing with conduct of the defendant that is
24        no more recent than 20 years ago.
25             I'm going to be talking about time in my

 1        argument to you.  Plaintiff's counsel didn't
 2        talk about time at all, but time is a very
 3        important element of this case, in this phase,
 4        because it's 2010 now.
 5             Just to put this in perspective, the
 6        earliest conduct that you could consider for
 7        punishment happened more than 20 years ago,
 8        about the time that a young Ph.D. scientist
 9        from Cal Berkeley joined Philip~Morris as a new
10        employee.  That's how long ago it was.  And
11        we're going to talk about the importance of
12        time with the evidence that you've been given
13        as we move through closing argument.
14             Another finding you made, what your
15        verdict told us, and that's an apportionment of
16        fault.  And you apportioned the fault among the
17        defendants, among Mr. Piendle.  And I'm taking
18        from that finding of apportionment of fault
19        that you determined, after hearing all the
20        evidence in Phase I, that smoking is a shared
21        responsibility, a shared responsibility, some
22        responsibility on the defendant manufacturers
23        and others on the smoker.
24             I raise that point because as far back as
25        1966, our society decided that using a

 1        dangerous product was an adult's choice, having
 2        been provided a warning, and that's what
 3        society decided and at that time, that's what
 4        Philip Morris decided.
 5             They could have chose to move out of the
 6        cigarette business and not put a warning on,
 7        but they decided to continue to sell cigarettes
 8        under the new restriction that it had to have a
 9        warning label in 1966, '69, '85.  Every time
10        Congress changed it, they decided to continue
11        selling cigarettes, as society permitted, as
12        long as you met the regulations and
13        restrictions.
14             There's some aspects of your verdict that
15        leave us uncertain, if I could say that.  What
16        your verdict did not tell us:  Your verdict
17        does not tell us when the defective and
18        unreasonably dangerous cigarettes were placed
19        on the market, nor does your verdict tell us
20        how the cigarettes were unreasonably dangerous 21        or defective.
22             So as I -- as I move into my discussion of
23        the evidence in Phase II, I'm a little bit in
24        the dark about the precise circumstances as to
25        the timing and exactly what you found to have

 1        been wrong with the cigarettes sometime in the
 2        past, when Mr. Piendle smoked them.
 3             We're now in Phase II, and we're
 4        addressing the issue of whether that wrongful
 5        conduct that you determined happened at least
 6        20 years ago should subject the current company
 7        to punishment today.
 8             So I'd like you to think of it as if
 9        you're standing here, August 2010, and what you
10        did in Phase I is you looked back in time, as
11        far back as the 1950s, to see whether or not
12        wrongful conduct harmed Mr. Piendle, and you
13        determined it did and you assessed that
14        conduct, and you found it met one of the
15        criteria or more of punitive liability.
16             And now, you're in 2010, and you look at
17        the company today, and you have to make an
18        assessment, as to this phase of the case,
19        whether it's necessary today to punish the
20        company in 2010 for what the company had done
21        sometime in the past, so that it won't do it
22        sometime in the future.  So that's why the
23        timing of these events and the significance of
24        the current restrictions and regulations are
25        important factors, I would submit, in

 1        determining whether punishment is necessary
 2        today for what happened in the past.
 3             I'd like to make this observation, because
 4        it's very rare when you're shown these
 5        documents and given this evidence that you're
 6        actually told what the dates are or given them
 7        in chronological order.  And even in
 8        plaintiff's closing, you have a document in
 9        '66, and one in '82 and then back to '72, and
10        then back to the '50s and then back to the
11        '80s.
12             Things don't happen in real life like
13        that.  They happen chronologically.  That's how
14        life works.  It's a timeline.  Certain things
15        happen before others, and others happen after
16        certain things.  Keeping those in perspective
17        is absolutely critical to this phase of the
18        case because it's all new to you.
19             A month ago you didn't know very much
20        about 50 years' worth of cigarette industry
21        activity or the government's activity or public
22        health activity, but now you do, and you've had
23        it all provided to you in a very compressed
24        time period.  And so it's hard to take that
25        accordion and stretch it back out to what it

 1        really was, and that's what you need to do when
 2        you consider whether it's necessary today to
 3        punish for things that happened a long time
 4        ago.
 5             You've been told about conduct that  6        happened in the '50s and the '60s and the '70s
 7        and the '80s, and you may feel that it's
 8        absolutely necessary, if we were in the '50s or
 9        '60s or '70s or '80s to step in and put a stop
10        to certain conduct you found to be wrongful.
11             One of the things -- of all the powerful
12        things that this Court can do, one of the
13        things it can't do is turn back the hands of
14        time.  This Court cannot put us all in a time
15        machine and take us back to the '50s or '60s so
16        that we can take action according to what you
17        found in the evidence.  That's just not
18        possible.  As much as, in looking at the
19        evidence, you may have felt it should have
20        happened in 2010, that's not possible to do and
21        that's not part of your responsibility, to go
22        back in time.
23             Counsel may claim you're not really going
24        back in time because the company's name is the
25        same today as it was back then.  The conduct

 1        that you found wrongful is conduct to Philip
 2        Morris USA, and the defendant in this case that
 3        I'm representing is Philip Morris USA, same
 4        name, same company.  So it's okay in 2010 to
 5        punish a company because it's the same company
 6        that has the same name.  I want you to think
 7        about that for a second.
 8             My name is Frank Kelly.  I'm the third.  I
 9        have the same name as my father.  I have the
10        same name as my grandfather, Frank Patrick
11        Kelly.  We have the same name, but we're not
12        the same people.
13             Philip Morris USA has the same name on the
14        building.  The individuals who work at Philip
15        Morris who engaged in the conduct that you
16        found to be wrongful are generations removed
17        from the employees that work there today.
18             I'm not suggesting that individuals who
19        engage in wrongful conduct should not be
20        punished, if appropriate, under the facts of
21        the law.  What I'm suggesting is that the
22        individuals counsel is asking you to punish are
23        not the same people, not the same individuals,
24        not in the same position of the individuals you
25        found to have engaged in wrongful conduct.

 1             You may feel, after Mr. Barnhart's closing
 2        or certainly after Mr. Scarola's closing, they
 3        get you-all riled up and passionate and want
 4        you to -- make you feel like you're going to
 5        get up out of here and you're going to go up to
 6        Richmond, Virginia and you're going to bang on
 7        the door of Philip Morris USA and say, I want
 8        to see Dr. Wakeham, I've got a message to send
 9        to Dr. Wakeham or Mr. Weissman or Mr. Cullman
10        or his brother Mr. Cullman or Dr. Dunn, I want
11        to talk to them about things that happened 30
12        and 40 years ago.
13             And you would be told, I'm sorry, they
14        don't work here anymore, they haven't worked
15        here in a long time.
16             THE CLERK:  Counselor, nine minutes. 17             MR. KELLY:  Thank you.
18             You may be introduced to somebody like
19        Dr. Lipowicz, who does work there, who is a
20        senior scientist, and you could talk to him
21        about your concerns about what you found
22        happened a long time ago, but what message
23        would that be sending today, in 2010?
24             I'm not suggesting that you treat
25        companies or corporations any differently than

 1        you would an individual.  The instructions and
 2        the law require you to treat them exactly the
 3        same, and just like any other family
 4        organization that changes from generation to
 5        generation so, too, do companies and
 6        corporations change from generation to
 7        generation.  You found that other individuals
 8        in the company engaged in wrongful conduct.
 9        The issue now is whether the current employees
10        in the company should be punished for that
11        historical bad conduct that you determined.
12             MR. SCAROLA:  Excuse me, your Honor,
13        that's absolutely improper argument.  There's
14        no issue with regard to the punishment of
15        employees.  I would ask the Court to instruct
16        the jury to disregard that argument.
17             MR. KELLY:  We rephrase that, your Honor.
18             The company today, with its current
19        employees, as opposed to the company previously
20        with the employees whom you determined engaged
21        in wrongful conduct.
22             Let me touch upon another issue that came
23        up during the evidence over the last couple of
24        days, and that is that selling cigarettes today
25        is somehow punishable, wrong, improper,

 1        illegal.  It's none of those things.  Selling
 2        cigarettes today, in compliance with the
 3        regulations and restrictions, is entirely
 4        permissible.
 5             I'm going to talk a little bit about the
 6        current company activities in a minute.  I
 7        wanted to remind you of the Institute of
 8        Medicine in 2001.  As a point of evidence, I'll
 9        be talking about a little bit more right now.
10             Gina, how much more time I have?
11             THE CLERK:  Six minutes.
12             MR. KELLY:  Thank you very much.  Six
13        minutes to go.
14             It may take my six minutes to explain this
15        chart to you.  This is a timeline.  And this is
16        the timeline that I would ask you to keep in
17        mind as you look at the evidence and assess
18        whether it's necessary today, in 2010, to
19        punish the company for things that happened
20        some long time ago.
21             The various activities here, that you'll
22        remember from the evidence, happened
23        historically.  Mr. Piendle started smoking in
24        the '50s.  He stopped in 1989.  1964, the
25        Surgeon General's report came out, and over the

 1        course of time, since 1966 to the present time,  2        various restrictions requiring warning labels,
 3        restricting advertising and marketing,
 4        restricting where smoking could happen have
 5        come into being up to the present time.
 6             1995, you'll recall the We Card program
 7        was voluntarily instituted.  1997, Philip
 8        Morris voluntarily took the position that "We
 9        are going to let the public health community
10        speak as the one single voice on smoking and
11        health issues from now on."
12             That's before the 1998 MSA.  In 1998, the
13        MSA was entered into, agreed to, imposing
14        significant restrictions on the company into
15        the future, up to the present time.  You'll see
16        from the evidence of the financial records,
17        page 71, that the settlement payments in 19 --
18        I'm sorry, in 2009, just in 2009, for the MSA
19        were $3.6 billion to the states.
20             The website, you saw information about.
21             Voluntarily removing ads from magazines in
22        2000 and then in 2005, you heard the testimony
23        on.
24             In 2001, accepting as the basic principles
25        of the Research and Development and Engineering

 1        Department, the recommendations of the
 2        Institute of Medicine concerning the
 3        development of reduced-exposure products.
 4             You will recall that one of the
 5        consultants to that publication was
 6        Dr. Benowitz, that the company contributed to
 7        the research that went into that publication,
 8        and they were adopted in 2001, not required to
 9        be adopted, but they adopted them in 2001.
10             Dr. Lipowicz told you how it affected
11        their research and development from that time
12        present, when the FDA came into being.  And
13        today, with the FDA regulating every aspect of
14        the cigarette business, most importantly, for
15        your purposes, perhaps, the design of the
16        cigarette itself, that you determined at some
17        point in the past was dangerous and defective
18        and harmed Mr. Piendle, every aspect of
19        cigarette design today, from the tobacco that
20        goes into the cigarette, to the types of
21        filters, to the paper, to the ingredients, to
22        the additives, everything that you can consider
23        making up a cigarette today is under the
24        authority of the --
25             THE CLERK:  Counselor, three minutes.

 1             MR. KELLY:  Thank you, Gina.
 2             -- of the Food and Drug Administration to
 3        set criteria for what's acceptable.
 4             That's in addition to the 50 Attorneys
 5        General who have imposed restrictions on the
 6        company for -- over the last ten years.  So
 7        counsel has the burden of proof to establish to
 8        you, to persuade you that somehow some aspect
 9        of the design of cigarettes has escaped 50
10        Attorney Generals and the federal government,
11        so that it's necessary today to impose punitive
12        damages on the company to prevent it from doing 13        something it did in the past.
14             The evidence is going to indicate that all
15        the evidence you were given in Phase I that was
16        characterized by counsel as wrongful could not
17        be done again today, cannot be done again today
18        because of these restrictions, and there's no
19        need to award Mrs. Piendle any more money than
20        that which you've awarded her for full and
21        complete compensation to prevent something from
22        happening today that happened a long time ago.
23             Now, I've got two lines here for -- along
24        the timeline.  The blue line is society's
25        timeline.  The green line is Philip Morris.

 1             You'll see that around 1964 Philip Morris
 2        began to separate out along the path set by
 3        society, with respect to smoking and health
 4        issues.  I think that's what you've determined
 5        already.
 6             I can't be specific about what you found,
 7        but I am inferring that from your verdict.  And
 8        that despite all the efforts over time to
 9        design cigarettes that were less hazardous, in
10        response to what the public health community
11        requested and recommended, certain issues,
12        important issues, the company did not align
13        itself with, with society.
14             Like a stubborn mule, you may think, it
15        refused to accept where society was going until
16        1997, 1998, when the 50 Attorneys General came
17        down upon the company and whacked it on the
18        rump with the MSA and got it moving in a new
19        direction, caused it to change its path, and it
20        did change its path and began to align with
21        society's expectations for smoking and health
22        issues.
23             From that time on, the evidence is
24        undisputed.  The company, like a mule who's
25        been whacked on the rump, has changed direction

 1        and conformed with society's expectations, and
 2        there's no indication now that for some act in
 3        the past it's necessary to chase that mule down
 4        through history and whack it on the rump again
 5        on behalf of Mrs. Piendle.
 6             Here is where the company is now, parallel
 7        and aligned with where society expects it to be
 8        for a company that sells cigarettes.  Whacking
 9        it again, and again, and again, is not
10        necessary.  Punishment without a purpose should
11        not be permitted in this court.  Punishment
12        without a purpose isn't justice.  It's just
13        revenge.  Punishment without deterrents is not
14        necessary.  If you're another mule -- strike
15        that.  Not you.
16             If there are other mules who are watching
17        what's happening to this mule and they see that
18        it gets whacked on the rump here and then
19        changes its direction to align itself with
20        society for a ten-year period, more than a
21        ten-year period, and then -- and then it gets
22        hit again for something that happened a long
23        time ago, what message does that send?  Is that 24        the message you want to send to other
25        companies?  That if you align yourself with

 1        society, even if you're forced to, if you do
 2        it, and you do voluntarily some additional --
 3        make some additional efforts, that you're still
 4        going to be subject to being punished for
 5        things that happened a long time ago.
 6             I don't think that's justice.  I don't
 7        think it's deterrence.  I just think it's more
 8        money for Mrs. Piendle, and I don't think
 9        that's what this phase of the case is about.
10             I think I'm about out of time, your Honor.
11             So thank you very much for your attention,
12        ladies and gentlemen.  I really appreciate the
13        time that you've spent over these six weeks
14        together.  On behalf of Mr. Henk and also
15        Dr. Lipowicz, who I asked just to stick around
16        so that he could -- he could see this part of
17        the case and be here for your deliberations,
18        thank you very much for your attention.
19             That's all I have, your Honor.  Thank you.
