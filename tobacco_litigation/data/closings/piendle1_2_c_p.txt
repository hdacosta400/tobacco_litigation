24   CLOSING ARGUMENT
11             MR. SCAROLA:  Thank you.  May it please
12        the Court, Counsel, Liz, and ladies and
13        gentlemen of the jury.
14             One of my favorite novels is a book by
15        John Irving called "A Prayer for Owen Meany."
16        And the theme, the central theme of that book
17        is there are no coincidences.  And I couldn't
18        help but thinking about that theme as I thought
19        about the responsibilities that have been
20        collectively assumed by you, particularly in
21        this phase of this case.
22             It is no coincidence that you received the
23        summons for jury service that you received when
24        you received them.  It is no coincidence that
25        you were randomly selected downstairs in the

 1        jury room to report upstairs for selection in
 2        this case.  It is no coincidence that you took
 3        the seats in the ceremonial courtroom that you
 4        took and the positions that you took them,
 5        again, having been randomly placed in those
 6        seats, and it is certainly no coincidence at
 7        all that it is the six of you who have been
 8        chosen as the conscience of this community to
 9        deal with issues relating to this historic
10        lawsuit.  You are substantially --
11             MR. HENK:  Your Honor, I'm sorry, this
12        wasn't covered by the continuing objection.
13        It's not a historic lawsuit.  To treat any
14        lawsuit any differently than any other --
15             MR. BARNHART:  That's a speaking
16        objection.
17             THE COURT:  I'm going to overrule the
18        objection. 19             MR. SCAROLA:  You are of varying ages, you
20        are male and female, you are ethnically and
21        racially diverse.  You are a cross-section of
22        melting pot America, and there could not be a
23        better group than those of you who sit in these
24        seats to make the decision that you will be
25        called upon to make in this historic case.

 1             You have more power than princes and
 2        presidents.  You have greater strength than
 3        sovereigns and Senators --
 4             MR. KELLY:  I'm going to object, your
 5        Honor, as improper argument appealing to the
 6        sympathies and emotions of the jury.
 7             MR. SCAROLA:  Your Honor, it is not an
 8        appeal to sympathy, it is a recognition of the
 9        reality of the power that the law imposes on
10        the jury system in this country.  It is
11        entirely appropriate.
12             THE COURT:  I'll overrule the objection.
13             MR. SCAROLA:  You have the authority to do
14        in this lawsuit what the Canadian Ministry of
15        National Health and Welfare, what the American
16        Medical Association, what the American Lung
17        Association, what the American Heart
18        Association, what the American Cancer Society,
19        what the American College of Chest Physicians,
20        the American College for Thoracic Surgery, the
21        American Public Health Association, the U.S.
22        Veteran's Administration, the British Ministry
23        of Health, and the Surgeon General of the
24        United States have been unable to do today.
25        For all of those years and through to today,

 1        you have the authority, the ability, and the
 2        power to accomplish what they have not and what
 3        the FDA has yet to accomplish as well.
 4             Now, there are some things that you can't
 5        do.  You can't change what's already happened.
 6        Nothing you have done, nothing you can do will
 7        bring back Charlie Piendle.  We can imagine, as
 8        Liz does so often, what life would be like if
 9        Charlie were still here, but we can't change
10        yesterday.  You can imagine what life will be
11        like tomorrow and you can change it because you
12        have the power to change it.
13             You can imagine what it would be like when
14        the folks in the boardroom in Richmond,
15        Virginia, and Winston-Salem, North Carolina
16        receive the telephone call or get the e-mail or
17        are called into the conference rooms so they
18        can watch on Court TV as your verdict is read
19        live.
20             You can imagine what it will be like when
21        the members of the board of directors --
22             MR. HENK:  Objection, your Honor.  This
23        trial is not on Court TV.
24             THE COURT:  I'm going to sustain as to any
25        reference to Court TV.

 1             MR. SCAROLA:  You can imagine what it will
 2        be like when the morning after your verdict,
 3        the members of the board of directors in  4        New York or Atlanta or L.A. or Chicago or
 5        Washington, D.C. open up their morning paper
 6        and read about what a jury in West Palm Beach,
 7        Florida did.
 8             MR. KELLY:  Objection, your Honor.  It's
 9        improper argument appealing to the sympathies
10        of the jury.
11             THE COURT:  Sustain the objection.
12             MR. SCAROLA:  Will there be a collective
13        sigh of relief that the machine that is
14        producing -- that produced, during 2009, with
15        no evidence that it has diminished in any
16        respect at all, a profit of $7,980,820 every
17        day for Philip Morris, the machine which, for
18        R.J. Reynolds, has produced and presumably
19        continues to produce $2,465,753.42 every day,
20        will continue to pump out that profit without
21        any fear of any interruption in the future, or
22        imagine, if you will, when they open the
23        newspaper, when they get the telephone call,
24        when they read the e-mail, they find out that a
25        jury in West Palm Beach, Florida said, we're

 1        not going to stand for this anymore.
 2             MR. KELLY:  Objection, your Honor, that's
 3        still improper argument, appealing to the
 4        improper sympathies of the jury for unspecified
 5        conduct.
 6             THE COURT:  I'm going to sustain the
 7        objection.
 8             MR. SCAROLA:  Your Honor, on what basis,
 9        so that I know and not violate the Court's
10        order?  This is absolutely a proper argument
11        with regard to --
12             MR. KELLY:  May we approach?
13             THE COURT:  Yes.
14             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were
15        held out of the presence of the jury:)
16             THE COURT:  The reference to what others
17        around the country or others around the town
18        would think about this.  I mean, if it's --
19             MR. SCAROLA:  Talking about the board of
20        directors of these corporations, I made it very
21        clear in my comments, I'll make it very clear
22        again.  Okay?
23             MR. KELLY:  Excuse me.  He has not
24        specified what the conduct is the jury is
25        supposed to be punishing the defendants for.

 1             MR. SCAROLA:  I fully intend to get to
 2        that.  I can't do it all in one sentence.
 3             MR. KELLY:  We gave you case law earlier
 4        on Phase I, these are appeals to sympathy to
 5        the jury under the law.  He's trying to rev
 6        them up.  The objection should be sustained.
 7        He should be talking about evidence and not the
 8        power of the jury.
 9             MR. SCAROLA:  Punished.
10             THE COURT:  You're entitled to talk about
11        that.  I misunderstood.  The objection I
12        sustained was sending a message to others.  If
13        it's directed to those in the company, then
14        that would be permissible. 15             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was
16        concluded and the following proceedings were
17        held within the presence of the jury:)
18             MR. SCAROLA:  May I proceed, your Honor?
19             THE COURT:  Yes.
20             MR. SCAROLA:  You have the ability and you
21        have the power to send a message to every
22        member of the board of directors of these
23        companies to let them know that we don't need
24        to wait for the FDA, we don't want to wait for
25        the FDA, we're tired of waiting for the FDA.

 1        This isn't the government's job, it's our job,
 2        the government of the people, we the people,
 3        and we're going to do it.  So that next time
 4        some representative of one of these
 5        corporations stands up there and says, these
 6        cigarettes, these are safer than these
 7        cigarettes, there won't be these cigarettes
 8        there anymore.
 9             MR. KELLY:  Objection, your Honor.
10             I'm sorry, Counselor.
11             That is improper argument, beyond the
12        scope of this phase of the case.
13             MR. SCAROLA:  We're talking about
14        defective products, your Honor.  We're
15        talking -- may I proceed?
16             THE COURT:  I'll overrule, but limit your
17        comments to the defective nature of the
18        products.
19             MR. SCAROLA:  This corporation came in in
20        this phase of the proceeding and said, these
21        cigarettes are safer than these cigarettes.
22        Well, if you know that these cigarettes are not
23        as safe as these cigarettes, if you understand
24        that, stop making those cigarettes.  Do --
25             MR. HENK:  Objection, your Honor.  I'm

 1        sorry.
 2             MR. BARNHART:  Your Honor, how many
 3        times -- how many lawyers get to object from
 4        one side?
 5             MR. KELLY:  May we approach, your Honor?
 6             THE COURT:  You may approach.
 7             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were
 8        held out of the presence of the jury:)
 9             MR. KELLY:  This is absolutely --
10             THE COURT:  Let's have one counsel on any
11        one issue, one counsel should make the
12        objection.
13             MR. KELLY:  It is absolutely improper to
14        suggest to the jury that they have the power to
15        prevent a company from selling cigarettes today
16        that are fully within the regulations and
17        restrictions that have been imposed by the
18        government.  That is absolutely improper.
19             THE COURT:  Okay.  Response.
20             MR. BIERSTEKER:  I would only add that it
21        is not illegal to sell cigarettes at varying
22        levels of risk.
23             MR. SCAROLA:  They have a right to sell
24        cigarettes.  They have no right to sell
25        defective cigarettes.  This jury may very well 8184
 1        conclude, may very well have already concluded
 2        that failing to sell the safest cigarettes
 3        possible, just like failing to produce the
 4        safest car that can be manufactured, based upon
 5        the current state of science is the source of
 6        liability.
 7             THE COURT:  I will allow you to argue that
 8        they, you know, have the right to sell
 9        defective cigarettes, but it would be improper
10        to suggest to the jury that it is an unlawful
11        activity, which is something they shouldn't be
12        engaging in.  I think it's coming close to
13        that.
14             MR. BARNHART:  You cannot have a tag team.
15             THE COURT:  We spoke about that.
16             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was
17        concluded and the following proceedings were
18        held within the presence of the jury:)
19             MR. SCAROLA:  The manufacture and sale of
20        cigarettes is a lawful activity.  The
21        defendants cannot be held liable merely for
22        manufacturing, selling, designing, advertising
23        cigarettes.  But they can be and they have been
24        held liable by you, ladies and gentlemen of
25        this jury, exercising the power that you have,

 1        they can be held liable for placing on the
 2        market defective cigarettes, unreasonably
 3        dangerous cigarettes.  And they can and you
 4        have found they should be punished for placing
 5        defective and unreasonably dangerous cigarettes
 6        on the market in reckless disregard of the
 7        health, the safety, and the welfare of the
 8        general public.  They can and they should be
 9        punished for that.
10             And while counsel suggests to you that
11        somehow there remains some issue about that,
12        here is your verdict.  Here is the truth you
13        have already spoken.  Under the circumstances
14        of this case, state whether you find by clear
15        and convincing evidence that punitive damages
16        are warranted against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
17        Company and Philip Morris USA, Inc., and you
18        have found by clear and convincing evidence
19        that, indeed, punitive damages are warranted.
20             So we're here to talk about what's the
21        appropriate amount of those punitive damages,
22        and what does the defense tell you?  Don't
23        punish us because.  Don't punish us because we
24        successfully concealed our wrongdoing for half
25        a century.

 1             MR. BIERSTEKER:  Objection, your Honor.
 2        This is not a basis for punitive damages in
 3        this phase of the case.
 4             MR. SCAROLA:  It is fair comment on the
 5        argument that has been made by these defendants
 6        that since so much time has passed, they don't
 7        need to be punished.
 8             MR. KELLY:  May I approach and put my
 9        objection on the record?  This is not what we
10        argued. 11             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were
12        held out of the presence of the jury:)
13             MR. KELLY:  He put concealment up there.
14             THE COURT:  I was going to sustain the
15        objection and have that removed.  Just flip it
16        down at the top part.
17             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was
18        concluded and the following proceedings were
19        held within the presence of the jury:)
20             MR. SCAROLA:  Don't punish us because we
21        were able to get away with our wrongdoing for
22        half a century.
23             MR. KELLY:  Same objection, your Honor.
24        That is the concealment claim the jury did not
25        find harm --

 1             THE COURT:  I sustained as to the
 2        concealment claim.
 3             MR. SCAROLA:  Don't punish us because too
 4        much time has passed since we killed Charlie
 5        Piendle.  We shouldn't be held responsible
 6        anymore, too much time has passed.  Don't
 7        punish us because we've been forced to take all
 8        sorts of corrective action.  Don't punish us
 9        because we have, quote, voluntarily taken other
10        corrective action.  You assured us you would
11        use your common sense.
12             Does the drug dealer --
13             MR. KELLY:  Objection, your Honor, may we
14        approach?
15             THE COURT:  Yes.
16             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were
17        held out of the presence of the jury:)
18             MR. KELLY:  You had issued an order.
19             THE COURT:  Is this in reference to
20        criminal --
21             MR. KELLY:  No, comparative analogies were
22        going to be made.
23             THE COURT:  Let me ask the question.  Is
24        that what this --
25             MR. SCAROLA:  The statement will be, does

 1        the drug dealer escape punishment because he
 2        voluntary checks himself into a rehab facility?
 3        These defendants are dealing drugs, they admit
 4        they're dealing drugs.
 5             THE COURT:  I'm going to sustain the
 6        objection.  I believe it will inflame the jury.
 7             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was
 8        concluded and the following proceedings were
 9        held within the presence of the jury:)
10             MR. SCAROLA:  Does an individual escape
11        punishment because he voluntarily checks
12        himself into a rehab facility?  Your Honor, I'm
13        in rehab, don't hold me responsible for what I
14        did wrong.  The, quote, voluntary measures on
15        the part of the tobacco industry that you have
16        seen, that's the tobacco industry equivalent of
17        checking themselves into rehab.
18             How many smokers do you think go to the
19        R.J. Reynolds or Philip Morris website for
20        health information?  Who do you think gets to
21        see that website?  You, you, and you and you 22        and you and you.
23             MR. KELLY:  Your Honor, that's improper.
24             MR. BARNHART:  That's a speaking
25        objection, your Honor.

 1             MR. KELLY:  It's a Golden Rule violation.
 2             MR. BARNHART:  That's not even close.
 3             THE COURT:  I'll overrule that objection.
 4             MR. SCAROLA:  The website was mandated by
 5        settlement.  Its content was designed to be
 6        used in litigation by the same --
 7             MR. BIERSTEKER:  Objection, your Honor.
 8             MR. KELLY:  Objection.
 9             THE COURT:  Just a minute.  I will sustain
10        that objection.
11             MR. SCAROLA:  I suggest that a reasonable
12        inference is, that these tobacco companies, who
13        told you there are all sorts of other lawsuits
14        pending against them, have designed their
15        websites specifically for purposes of knowing
16        that they were going to use it in an attempt to
17        defend themselves against being justly punished
18        for their misconduct.
19             MR. KELLY:  Improper argument, outside the
20        scope of the evidence, your Honor.
21             THE COURT:  I'll sustain.  I'll allow only
22        as to if it was mandated by the settlement,
23        that's what's permissible to be argued.
24        Otherwise, sustained.
25             MR. SCAROLA:  Ask yourselves, ask

 1        yourselves, who is really sought to be
 2        influenced by the content of those websites.
 3        Do they really have some effect on the general
 4        public?  Ask yourselves if the marketing
 5        magicians who were capable of selling death and
 6        destruction in an addictive package --
 7             MR. KELLY:  Objection, your Honor.
 8             MR. SCAROLA:  -- to hundreds of
 9        thousands --
10             MR. KELLY:  Objection, your Honor.
11        There's no -- may I approach, your Honor, so I
12        don't have a speaking objection?
13             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were
14        held out of the presence of the jury:)
15             MR. KELLY:  "The marketing magicians,"
16        your Honor, there is no element of this case
17        that involves concealment, trickery, or deceit.
18             THE COURT:  What was going to be said?
19             MR. SCAROLA:  What was going to be said is
20        that the marketing magicians who were able to
21        sell these cigarettes to the general public
22        certainly are capable of making a better effort
23        of communicating the problems associated with
24        the defects in these cigarettes if they truly
25        wanted to do so.

 1             MR. KELLY:  Calling them magicians
 2        suggests deceit, trickery, and fraud.
 3             THE COURT:  Sustained as to the
 4        description of magician.
 5             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was
 6        concluded and the following proceedings were  7        held within the presence of the jury:)
 8             MR. SCAROLA:  If these marketing experts
 9        who were successful in selling death and
10        destruction to hundreds of thousands and
11        millions of consumers, death and destruction in
12        an addictive package, really wanted to get the
13        message out about how dangerous their defective
14        product is, do any of you think that they would
15        have limited their efforts to some website
16        page?
17             If it were really their intention to
18        communicate to people that they should no
19        longer smoke, while they continue to satisfy
20        consumers' desires, while their No. 1 priority
21        continues to be consumer acceptability with a
22        total disregard of consumer safety, except to
23        the extent, I suggest to you, that it may serve
24        their interest to keep the profit machine
25        operating, couldn't they have done a better

 1        job, and can't you, by your verdict,
 2        communicate to them that they must do a better
 3        job.  They must.
 4             If you're going to continue to exercise
 5        the lawful privilege of selling cigarettes and
 6        deriving a profit from it any longer, you must
 7        do a better job.
 8             By your verdict, you can tell them that.
 9        You have the power to communicate that message
10        to them in this historic case.  They talk about
11        all the other cases that are pending, but did
12        you hear word one about their ever having
13        compensated a single smoker --
14             MR. KELLY:  Objection, your Honor.  That's
15        completely improper argument to the jury.
16             THE COURT:  Sustain the objection.
17             MR. SCAROLA:  Well, you think about what
18        you did and what you didn't hear about any
19        other claim that may have been made or may be
20        made --
21             MR. KELLY:  Your Honor, that is requesting
22        the jury to speculate about things they haven't
23        heard.  That's completely improper.
24             THE COURT:  Sustain the objection.
25             MR. SCAROLA:  Respectfully, your Honor, I

 1        believe it's appropriate comment in response
 2        to --
 3             THE COURT:  Counsel can approach.
 4             MR. SCAROLA:  Thank you.
 5             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were
 6        held out of the presence of the jury:)
 7             THE COURT:  I did not allow the defense to
 8        get into payments and settlements and so that
 9        is the reason.
10             MR. SCAROLA:  They talked about thousands
11        of other cases pending.
12             THE COURT:  I allowed them to say on
13        claims other class member and potential to
14        bring other suits.  I didn't allow them to get
15        into payments.  That's why I am not allowing
16        plaintiff.
17             MR. KELLY:  It is a fact that there are 18        payments made, there are settlements made every
19        day.
20             THE COURT:  That's why I'm not allowing
21        it.  I didn't allow the defense to do it.
22             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was
23        concluded and the following proceedings were
24        held within the presence of the jury:)
25             MR. SCAROLA:  They tell you that we are a

 1        different company and we have learned our
 2        lesson.  Since 1998 or 1999 or 2000, we are a
 3        different company and we have learned our
 4        lesson.
 5             Dr. Figlar was asked:  "Did you have
 6        presented to you requests for admissions,
 7        responses to requests for admissions filed in
 8        the Izzarelli case, remember that was the 2004,
 9        the 2004 request for admissions?  One of the
10        things that R.J. Reynolds was asked to admit
11        was smoking cigarettes can be a substantial
12        factor in bringing about cancer in humans."
13             "Now, the answer to that request, you have
14        told the ladies and gentlemen of the jury
15        should very clearly have been yes, because
16        R.J. Reynolds knows and admits that smoking
17        cigarettes can be a substantial factor in
18        bringing about cancer in humans, correct?"
19             Answer:  "A clarification of the question.
20        Yes, April of 2004.  In April of 2004,
21        R.J. Reynolds was supposed to be admitting that
22        smoking cigarettes can be a substantial factor
23        in bringing about cancer in humans, right?"
24             THE CLERK:  Counselor, five minutes.
25             MR. SCAROLA:  Thank you very much.

 1             And what do we learn?
 2             "This is the answer that R.J. Reynolds
 3        filed.  Reynolds answered that statement by
 4        saying it didn't know whether smoking
 5        cigarettes was a substantial factor in bringing
 6        about cancer in humans as late as April of
 7        2004, right?"
 8             "Yeah, that's what it says.  That's what
 9        it says."
10             Is this a changed company or is it the
11        same company with the same priorities?  Profit
12        over safety.  Deception over truth.  Marketing
13        means more than people's lives.  But you, you
14        have the ability to make a difference.
15             Now, I put these up and I will tell you,
16        as Greg has told you, we can't, we will not
17        tell you what the right answer is, because
18        that's your power.  You have the collective
19        ability, as a cross-section of community,
20        chosen to represent this community from varying
21        ages, from varying backgrounds, ethnically and
22        racially diverse, to speak for us all and we
23        won't interfere with the exercise of that
24        judgment.  But, remember, the purpose of
25        punitive damage is to punish and to deter.

 1             Defense counsel wants to know what does it
 2        communicate to other donkeys or mules?  We're  3        not talking about communicating to other
 4        donkeys or mules.  We're talking about
 5        communicating to corporate America.  And do we
 6        want to send a message to corporate America
 7        that if you're able to get away with your
 8        misconduct long enough, you will not be
 9        punished when you get caught?
10             Do we want to send a message to corporate
11        America that you can recklessly disregard the
12        safety of consumers, today, by continuing to
13        sell products that you know are more dangerous
14        than other products --
15             MR. KELLY:  Objection, your Honor.  There
16        is no evidence that there was any finding in
17        this case, after 1989, with respect to any
18        defective or dangerous product.  That is
19        improper argument.
20             THE COURT:  Well, consistent with the
21        prior ruling, I'll sustain.
22             MR. SCAROLA:  I think the prior ruling
23        allowed me to make that argument, your Honor --
24             MR. BARNHART:  I did, too.
25             MR. SCAROLA:  -- respectfully.

 1             THE COURT:  Well, it's consistent with
 2        what Mr. Barnhart in his part of the closing.
 3             MR. SCAROLA:  I'm confused.  I'm sorry.
 4        But I'll move on.
 5             THE COURT:  Okay.
 6             MR. SCAROLA:  But I'll move on.
 7             If you conclude in your deliberations that
 8        there is conduct to be corrected, that was
 9        going on in the early 1950s, in the '60s, in
10        the '70s, in the '80s, that continued to go on
11        in the '90s and in this 21st Century, you have
12        the power, the ability, and the strength in
13        this historic case to make a difference,
14        without waiting for another Surgeon General's
15        report or the Canadian Ministry of Health or
16        the European Ministry of Health or the British
17        Ministry of Health or anybody else, you have
18        the ability to say no, now.  Stop now.  No
19        more, from this point forward.
20             Gina, do I have any time left at all?
21             THE CLERK:  Less than a minute.
22             MR. SCAROLA:  Pardon me?
23             THE CLERK:  Less than a minute.
24             MR. SCAROLA:  Less than a minute.
25             Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank


24                    CLOSING ARGUMENT
20             MR. BARNHART:  Folks, on August 18, 2010,
21        nobody thought we would be here hearing another
22        closing argument in this case, but we are, and
23        everybody owes you-all a hearty thank you.  We
24        do, the defense does, the Court does.  Thank
25        you.

 1             You have done your job well.  You have
 2        paid attention, you have poured over the
 3        evidence, you have seriously diligently
 4        considered the law, you've considered the
 5        facts, and you've done yourselves proud.  So
 6        what are we here to do?
 7             Today, we're here to decide how much, how
 8        much, these defendants should be punished, and
 9        how do you do that and how do we do that?  You
10        stand here just like you have.  You take the
11        law that you've used, you take the facts that
12        you've heard from the beginning of the trial
13        until yesterday afternoon, and you follow what
14        you've been doing all along.
15             Because today you sit as the members of
16        society, you stand in the shoes of the State of
17        Florida and the United States of America, and
18        you have the ability today to put an end to
19        conduct that is reprehensible, conduct that we
20        won't stand for, conduct that we should not
21        stand for.  And so that in this courtroom,
22        after all this time, you, not Judge Rosenberg,
23        certainly not us, have the ability to right a
24        terrible wrong and to make sure that this
25        doesn't happen again, to the extent that you

 1        can.  2             All right.  So how do you do that?  Well,
 3        first of all, in this Phase II, this punitive
 4        damages case, we go back to the jury
 5        instructions as you've done again and again and
 6        again.
 7             If you would, please.
 8             You started with these jury instructions,
 9        and the jury instructions were --
10             Christine, I don't want to bang you, but I
11        don't know if they can see without moving that.
12             The conduct that you reviewed, you had to
13        find that Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds were
14        guilty of one of the four or two of the four or
15        three of the four or all of the four, and you
16        found that by clear and convincing evidence,
17        and what was it?  A reckless disregard --
18             Can you see?  Mr. Tad-Y?
19             You can't, can you?
20             JUROR TAD-Y:  It's all right.
21             MR. BARNHART:  Christine, could you move
22        just a bit?
23             THE COURT REPORTER:  Sure.
24             MR. BARNHART:  We have a technical
25        problem.  Could you give me an extra minute on

 1        that because --
 2             THE CLERK:  It's stopped.
 3             MR. BARNHART:  Okay, thanks.
 4             By having to move that, I want everybody
 5        to be able to see this.
 6             You found a reckless disregard of human
 7        life or the safety of persons exposed to the
 8        conduct, or that there was an entire lack of
 9        care, that the defendants have been consciously
10        indifferent to the consequences, or that they
11        recklessly disregarded the safety and welfare
12        of the public.
13             Who is the public?  You and me.
14             MR. KELLY:  Objection, your Honor.  That
15        violates the Golden Rule.
16             MR. BARNHART:  No, your Honor.  The
17        violation of the public is the public trust is
18        clearly a member of the --
19             MR. KELLY:  That's improper argument.
20             THE COURT:  Okay.  I'll sustain.  I'll
21        allow you to just reference the language of the
22        instruction.
23             MR. BARNHART:  So what that means is that
24        the public is the general populous.  The
25        conduct showed a reckless indifference to the

 1        rights of others as to be equivalent to an
 2        intentional violation of those rights, one or
 3        two or three or four, and those are the things
 4        you found by clear and convincing evidence.
 5             If you could, please.
 6             But we have different jury instructions
 7        now.  But to go back, I don't know if you get
 8        your jury verdict back or not, but here's what
 9        you found.  Was Charles Piendle addicted to
10        cigarettes containing nicotine, and if so, was
11        the addiction a legal cause of his lung cancer
12        and death?  And you found yes. 13             Number 2, were the defective and
14        unreasonably dangerous cigarettes placed on the
15        market by R.J. Reynolds a legal cause of
16        Charles Piendle's death?  And you found yes.
17             Were the defective and unreasonably
18        dangerous cigarettes placed on the market by
19        Philip Morris a legal cause of Charles
20        Piendle's death?  And you found yes.
21             And then, to get where we are today, you
22        answered these questions.  Under the
23        circumstances of this case, state whether you
24        find by clear and convincing evidence that
25        punitive damages are warranted against

 1        R.J. Reynolds, and you answered yes.
 2             Under the circumstances of this case,
 3        state whether you find by clear and convincing
 4        evidence that punitive damages are warranted
 5        against Philip Morris, and you answered yes.
 6             So there are some more jury instructions
 7        that will help you do your job, just like the
 8        other jury instructions helped you do this job.
 9             If we could, okay.
10             So these jury instructions will be
11        guidelines.  They'll be polestars for you to
12        accumulate the evidence, put it together, and
13        come up with a fair result, and a result that
14        measures all of the conduct, measures all of
15        the harm, and does right.  Okay.
16             First, the nature, extent, and degree of
17        misconduct and the related circumstances.  So
18        let's talk about that.  What does that mean?
19             Well, the nature of the conduct, let's
20        parse it out and be logical.  What kind of
21        conduct was it?  Was it serious conduct, was it
22        not so bad?  Did it involve danger to people or
23        did it just involve money?  Did it -- did the
24        conduct put lives in jeopardy or did it just
25        inconvenience people?  Did it hurt things or

 1        people?  Did people get hurt?  And the worst
 2        thing, did people die?
 3             And that's how we measure the nature of
 4        the conduct.  Was it serious, was it just
 5        money, was it people, was it health, did they
 6        get hurt, and did people die, and you found --
 7             MR. HENK:  Your Honor, objection.  I'm
 8        sorry to interrupt.  Objection.  Your Court's
 9        instruction No. 3 directs the jury that they
10        cannot punish for harm suffered by other
11        people, and counsel is suggesting right now
12        that they can.
13             MR. BARNHART:  You found under the
14        evidence --
15             THE COURT:  Just one moment.  That is an
16        accurate statement of the instructions, so
17        argument should be consistent with the
18        instruction.
19             MR. HENK:  Thank you.
20             MR. BARNHART:  Thank you.
21             You found under the evidence that Charles
22        Piendle died because of the action of Philip
23        Morris and R.J. Reynolds.  All right.  So did 24        people die?  More than 400,000 people a year
25        died because of the actions of these

 1        defendants.
 2             MR. HENK:  I'm sorry, your Honor.
 3             MR. BARNHART:  But we are here to
 4        determine --
 5             MR. HENK:  I'm sorry, Mr. Barnhart.  This
 6        is the same issue that I just mentioned.
 7             MR. BARNHART:  No, your Honor.
 8             MR. HENK:  May we approach, your Honor?
 9             THE COURT:  I'm going to overrule.  The
10        Court is permitting the statement that counsel
11        just made, but I think counsel was in the
12        middle of a sentence that he was going to
13        conclude by specifically identifying
14        Mr. Piendle.
15             MR. BARNHART:  Exactly, your Honor.
16             THE COURT:  So overruled and allow counsel
17        to continue.
18             MR. HENK:  May I have a continuing
19        objection so I don't have to interrupt?
20             THE COURT:  You may.
21             MR. BARNHART:  So did people die?  I mean,
22        we found from the evidence that more than
23        400,000 people a year die.  But in this case,
24        we have to limit the finding to the death of
25        Charles Piendle.  So you can consider injury to

 1        the people at large, but this case is about the
 2        death of Charles Piendle, and there is a
 3        difference.
 4             Okay.  So what is the second category?
 5        It's the extent of the misconduct.  How long
 6        did it go on, was it a one-time affair, was it
 7        one bad act, or was it many?  And was it one
 8        bad act over one year or many bad acts over a
 9        week or a day or a month, or was it many bad
10        acts over many years?
11             Now, in this case, you heard that the bad
12        act went over 50 years, but by the instructions
13        of the Court --
14             MR. HENK:  I'm sorry, your Honor.
15             MR. BARNHART:  -- we're ending the bad act
16        consideration at 1989, which is the year in
17        which Charles Piendle was able to quit smoking.
18             THE COURT:  Okay.  Just a moment.  Was
19        there --
20             MR. HENK:  I think with the clarification,
21        because of your Honor's instructions two and
22        five, Mr. Piendle quit smoking in 1989.
23             THE COURT:  Okay.  And counsel said that.
24             MR. BARNHART:  Thank you for pointing that
25        out.  I certainly appreciate that.

 1             All right.  And then the degree of
 2        misconduct.  So we covered the nature of the
 3        misconduct, the extent of the misconduct, and
 4        the degree of the misconduct.  Was it willful
 5        or was it just a bad mistake?  Was it just
 6        gross negligence?  Was it driving drunk through
 7        a school zone once?  Or was it intentional, was
 8        it deliberate, was it a well-executed strategy?  9        And you know under the evidence that it was.
10        How do we know that?  Because they said it was.
11             It was their strategy, and that was a
12        strategy that was designed for years, not just
13        for a day, not for a week, not for a month, for
14        years.  And did they do it well?  Oh, did they
15        do it well.  They doggone did it well.  They
16        did it well for years and years and years and
17        they congratulated themselves on how
18        beautifully it was designed and executed.
19             So the degree of misconduct, was it
20        willful?  You bet it was, there's no doubt
21        about that.  How many people were affected or
22        hurt by the conduct?  Well, was it just one or
23        was it many?  Was it designed for one or was it
24        designed for many?
25             Millions of people were affected.  In this

 1        case, we're dealing with Charles Piendle, but
 2        millions of Charlie Piendles, millions of
 3        Charlie Piendles and their families were
 4        affected every day, every month, every year,
 5        for years and years and years and years, and
 6        that goes to the degree of misconduct.  And
 7        when you consider punishment, we consider the
 8        extent, the nature, and the degree of the
 9        misconduct.
10             So then that brings us to another
11        consideration, was it just an employee, just
12        one of thousands who happened to do these bad
13        things or did it involve management?  Was it
14        one person, was it a little group, was it a
15        team, or was it the highest levels of the
16        corporation?
17             And there's something in -- in the law of
18        this state and there's something in the common
19        decency of the way in which Americans do
20        business that, yes, there is nothing wrong with
21        making a profit.  That is the American way.
22        You should be able to make a profit, you should
23        be able to pay people, and outcompeting the
24        other side is fine, that's how we do things, we
25        compete.  What is not fine is when you do it

 1        under the table, when you do it wrong, when you
 2        do it unethically, when you try to hurt
 3        somebody.  That is not the American way, that
 4        is not acceptable, and that's the kind of
 5        conduct that needs to be punished.
 6             There are many fine corporations in this
 7        world, many fine corporations in the United
 8        States, and many fine businessmen and business
 9        people, but you cannot, as a business strategy,
10        try to hurt people, you cannot care less
11        whether what you sell addicts people and kills
12        them, you cannot do that.
13             All right.  So is it just an employee or
14        did it involve management?  Well, in this case,
15        we know from the evidence you saw it involved
16        the highest levels.  You saw CEOs testify.  You
17        saw memos back and forth from the heads of the
18        research department, from senior scientists
19        back and forth, and you saw executive vice 20        presidents, CEOs, everybody was in on it.
21        Well, maybe not everybody, probably not the
22        delivery boy, but the high level people were in
23        on it.  And that's something you need to take
24        into account.
25             Was it a corporate culture?  Did they

 1        inculcate it in their being for years?  Was
 2        that the way they presented it?  How did they
 3        react to other people?  Not just customers, how
 4        did they react to, in this case, the medical
 5        community?  The scientific community?  The
 6        government?  Did they react in an honorable way
 7        or a dishonorable way?  And that goes into the
 8        calculus of punishment.
 9             Finally, related circumstances.  What did
10        they do when they found out about something bad
11        or something dangerous?  In this case, what did
12        they do when they found out about cancer?  What
13        did they do when they found out about
14        addiction?
15             Well, now that was the crossroads, wasn't
16        it?  That was the time when they crossed the
17        Rubicon.  They could have done something about
18        that, but instead, they met at a fancy hotel in
19        New York City, in secret.
20             Now, did they care about antitrust?  Of
21        course not.
22             MR. BIERSTEKER:  Objection, Williams,
23        your Honor.
24             THE COURT:  Just a minute.  What is the
25        objection?

 1             MR. BIERSTEKER:  Objection, Williams/State
 2        Farm.  This is not a finding that we're here
 3        on.
 4             THE COURT:  I'll sustain the objection.
 5             MR. BARNHART:  All right.  Did they do --
 6        what did they do?  Did they cooperate with
 7        medical leaders?  Did they work with the
 8        scientific community?  Did they work with the
 9        Surgeon General?  No.  They made a decision.
10        And what was that decision?  You know the
11        answer as well as I do.  That decision was to
12        fight, to deny --
13             MR. BIERSTEKER:  Same objection,
14        your Honor.
15             MR. BARNHART:  -- to obfuscate --
16             MR. BIERSTEKER:  Same objection.
17             MR. BARNHART:  Not at all, your Honor.
18        This is appropriate to reprehensibility of the
19        conduct involved.  It has to do with the
20        products they sold, the defective products.
21             THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, focus on that
22        issue.
23             MR. BARNHART:  All right.
24             So they knew at this point that the
25        products they were making were defective and

 1        hazardous.  They knew from their own research
 2        that they caused cancer and that they were
 3        addictive, that's what they knew.
 4             So with that knowledge, what did they do?  5        Nothing, other than continue to practice
 6        business to make money.
 7             Did they make changes or did they attempt
 8        to fool people with filters?  Because remember
 9        back in the early 1950s, they had that cancer
10        scare, and we're going to see the evidence in
11        just a moment.  We had the cancer scare, sales
12        plummeted, and what did they do?  They changed
13        from nonfiltered cigarettes to filtered
14        cigarettes and gave the impression to the
15        American people that these were safer, because
16        they knew Americans thought they were safer.
17             And were they safer?
18             MR. HENK:  Again, your Honor --
19             MR. BARNHART:  No, they knew that.
20             MR. HENK:  I'm sorry to interrupt.  I'll
21        ask for a continuing objection so I don't have
22        to, but this is not the conduct that the jury
23        found there to be liability for punitive
24        damages for.
25             THE COURT:  Overruled.

 1             MR. HENK:  May I have a continuing
 2        objection?
 3             THE COURT:  Yes.
 4             MR. HENK:  Thank you.
 5             MR. BARNHART:  So if we could go to the
 6        next -- there we are.
 7             So the next issue really is you include
 8        these related circumstances, nature, and
 9        extent, and this all goes to the degree of
10        punishment, whether the wrongful conduct was
11        motivated by unreasonable financial gain, did
12        they do it for money, and whether the
13        unreasonably dangerous nature of the conduct,
14        together with the high likelihood of the injury
15        resulting from the conduct was actually known
16        by these defendants.
17             Okay.  A(i), did they do it for the money?
18        Of course, they did.  That's replete through
19        all their records.  Money was the driving
20        force.
21             And you saw that in every memorandum that
22        they had where that discussed money.  Market
23        share, market share, market share.  Let's get
24        our market share.  Let's keep our market share.
25             And you heard Dr. Figlar two weeks ago,

 1        our No. 1 consideration, according to
 2        Dr. Figlar in this trial, is that our products,
 3        our consumer -- excuse me, is that our products
 4        be consumer acceptable.  I mean, this is 2010,
 5        not that their products be safe, not that their
 6        products be nondefective, not that their
 7        products comport with acceptable -- acceptable
 8        standards of products, no.  Our No. 1
 9        consideration is that our products be consumer
10        acceptable.
11             And what does that mean?  They sell.  They
12        sell, they make money.  Okay.
13             And then A-II, did they actually know that
14        there was a high likelihood of injury?
15             I mean, is this something that they just 16        so negligently let go?  Did they hide their
17        heads, or did they actually know that there was
18        a high likelihood of injury?
19             Well, we know the answer to that, and they
20        did, too, in the 1950s and thereafter.
21             So what's the evidence?
22             If we could, let's go to the Batelle memo.
23             Okay.  This was the implications.  This is
24        early on, 1963, before the Surgeon General's
25        report came out, which was 1964.  That's the

 1        one that linked smoking with cancer.  And what
 2        do we have, what did they know, 1963,
 3        "moreover, nicotine is addictive." 1963.
 4             "We are then in the business of selling
 5        nicotine."  And they were right.  See, they
 6        weren't expecting this to be in a courtroom.
 7        They were writing it from one -- one leader to
 8        the other.
 9             "We're in the business of selling
10        nicotine, an addictive drug."  And they were
11        right about that.
12             "Effective in the release of stress
13        mechanisms."  And they're right about that.
14        But guess what, "Cigarettes have certain
15        unattractive side effects."
16             Don't you like that language?  It's
17        unattractive.  Indifference.
18             What is it?  What are the unattractive
19        side effects?  They cause or predispose to lung
20        cancer.  Well, that is an unattractive side
21        effect.  Because our product is addictive and
22        it causes people to get lung cancer.  That's
23        not all.  Our product contributes to certain
24        cardiovascular disorders, heart attacks.  They
25        may very well be truly causative -- may well be

 1        truly causative in emphysema and so on.  1963.
 2             Okay.  Now, I don't have time to go
 3        through these, but you remember in the 1950s,
 4        the documents we had, the Teague document,
 5        where we went through the -- had the
 6        bibliography and he went through all the cancer
 7        records, cancer, cancer, cancer, tumors,
 8        tumors, tumors.  That's what they knew in
 9        1950s.
10             Now, we come to this Nordine study.  1982.
11        What did they say there?
12             Can you go back for a moment?  One slide
13        back, if you could.
14             Again, most of those who have smoked for
15        any significant length of time -- for any
16        significant time would like to stop if they
17        can.  However, this is again talking about the
18        mindset.
19             "We cannot ever be comfortable selling a
20        product, which most of our customers would stop
21        using if they could."  We can't be comfortable
22        selling our product when most of our customers
23        would stop using the darn thing if we could.
24             That's to say, "If the exit gate from the
25        market should suddenly open, we could be out of
8093  1        business almost other night."  In other words,
 2        the exit gate is if people could quit.  If the
 3        exit gate were open and people could quit and
 4        they want to quit, we would be out of business
 5        overnight.  That's their concern, their
 6        business.
 7             So what do we need to do?  And then they
 8        go through this, if this occurs, we could go
 9        out of business.  Of course, they could
10        diversify.  They could find a way to eliminate
11        the desire of smokers to quit smoking, to stop
12        smoking.  Interesting.  Don't make them safer.
13        Help people quit, to stop the desire to quit,
14        or if we could find other products which are
15        unlike cigarettes.
16             All right.  Let's go to the next one.
17             All righty.  Then that brings us to 1972,
18        where there's a research planning memo on the
19        nature of the tobacco business and the role of
20        nicotine.
21             THE CLERK:  Counsel, 20 minutes.
22             MR. BARNHART:  Twenty, thank you.
23             We have deliberately played down the role
24        of nicotine; hence, the nonsmoker has little or
25        no knowledge of the satisfaction.  That's the

 1        nicotine.
 2             Let's move on on this one.
 3             Mr. Dunn.  Mr. Dunn from Philip Morris:
 4        "Think of the cigarette pack as a storage
 5        container for a day's supply of nicotine."
 6        Clinical, almost a pharmacologist.  "It's
 7        portable.  Its contents are accessible.  Think
 8        of the cigarette as a dispenser for a dose unit
 9        of nicotine."
10             All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to the
11        next one.
12             So going back to the jury instructions,
13        did they actually know?  Did they actually know
14        what their product did and that it caused harm?
15             Well, then we come to filtration because,
16        you see, that's what they added.  That's what
17        makes these products even more defective.
18             They knew they were addictive, they knew
19        they caused cancer, and they come up with this
20        illusion of filtration.
21             And let's go to the Roper study.  This is
22        in the '50s.  Remember the cancer scare again?
23        People were concerned.  There were articles in
24        Reader's Digest.  So what do we do about this?
25             No, I don't think so.  There we go.

 1             1953, "The primary stated reasons for
 2        smokers for being interested in smoking" --
 3        wait.
 4             "The primary stated reasons for smoking or
 5        being interested in smoking filter tips are
 6        reasons of health.  This is true among smokers
 7        of all brands of filter tip and among smokers
 8        of both sexes."
 9             So what did they know in 1953 of the
10        cancer scare?  Remember that big graph?  Before
11        1953, 99 percent of the cigarettes smoked were 12        nonfiltered.  After that it takes off to the
13        point where it's almost all cigarettes smoked,
14        by 1989, were filters.  All the cigarettes
15        smoked by Charles Piendle were filtered.
16             And why?  The primary stated reasons are
17        health.  So did it work?  No.
18             What did the special report from Philip
19        Morris show?  It showed an illusion of
20        filtration.
21             Mere reduction in nicotine -- and TPM is
22        tar -- would be -- to merely reduce nicotine
23        and tar delivered by conventional methods of
24        filtration is not a sufficient basis for
25        starting a new cigarette.  Don't just lower tar

 1        and nicotine, that's not good enough, because
 2        it would court disaster.
 3             What kind of disaster?  Business disaster.
 4             The illusion of filtration -- the illusion
 5        to whom?  Smokers.  It's safe -- is as
 6        important as the fact of filtration.  Let them
 7        feel that they're healthy.  We're putting these
 8        clean white filters on, and they get dirty when
 9        you smoke.  The illusion of filtration.  We're
10        actually protecting our health when we smoke
11        them.  Therefore, any injury should be by a
12        radically different method of filtration, but
13        need not be any more effective.
14             What does that mean?  They're completely
15        ineffective.  We could have a radically
16        different filter, but it need not be any more
17        effective.  Why?  Because the illusion of
18        filters is as important as having the filter
19        itself.  Make them feel that they're smoking
20        something more healthy.
21             Okay.  So what does that do -- let's go to
22        next one if we could.
23             1961, just so we know, so that there's no
24        issue about that, "All too often the smoker who
25        switches to a hi-fi cigarette, high-filter

 1        cigarette, winds up smoking more units in order
 2        to provide himself with the same delivery he
 3        had before.  In short, I don't believe the
 4        smoking pattern has changed."
 5             He's right.  That's compensation.  You
 6        heard about that all the way through this
 7        trial.  When you have the filter, the smoker
 8        smokes more, inhales more deeply and gets his
 9        or her fix of nicotine and tar.  That's what
10        they do.  That's what they knew way back in
11        1961, 50 years ago.  Dr. Lipowicz, or Lipowicz,
12        was here yesterday.  They buy in now to the
13        Surgeon General, but not him.  He says, "I
14        think that high-filter cigarettes are safe."
15        That's what he said.
16             THE CLERK:  Counselor, 25 minutes.
17             MR. BARNHART:  How much?  25, did you say,
18        Gina?
19             THE CLERK:  Uh-huh.
20             MR. BARNHART:  The cancer, what did they
21        know?  The evidence to indict -- I'll just show
22        this very quickly -- was overwhelming on 23        cancer.  The amount of evidence accumulated to
24        indict cigarette smoke, overwhelming.  The
25        evidence challenging the indictment, scant.

 1             So what does that show?
 2             There might have been some changes to
 3        these.
 4             So what did Dr. Figlar say?  Dr. Figlar,
 5        "Every cigarette Charlie Piendle smoked was
 6        unsafe, every one, from the time he started as
 7        a 12-year-old until the time he quit as
 8        49-year-old was unsafe, and he only smoked
 9        filters."
10             And that's what you-all found.  It's
11        defective.  It's unreasonably dangerous.
12             All right.  So that brings us to the
13        punitive damage phase, and that's why we're
14        here.  We had a short trial on that.  Our case
15        took about 20 minutes, 30, maybe.
16             We played the deposition of the CEO,
17        Mr. Heimann, in 1986.  He gave the parting
18        line, "The Surgeon General is dead wrong."
19             We brought in financials, which we'll talk
20        about in a minute.  And the defense had their
21        good company witness.  "We are a good company.
22        We have seen the light.  We have come to a
23        realization that we were wrong."  That's why
24        they're here.
25             Mr. Adams is CFO of an RJR subsidiary, not

 1        even RJR.  He makes $3.66 million a year; he's
 2        a stakeholder, and his stock, he says, is worth
 3        a lot of money.  And, guess what?  How his
 4        company does and the impact of lawsuits affects
 5        not only the bottom line of the company, but
 6        his bottom line.
 7             And his -- he also said that the net worth
 8        of his company is more than $6 billion.  He's a
 9        CFO.  He doesn't remember how much it was, even
10        from a year ago.  A CFO doesn't remember, but
11        it's more than 6 billion, probably not as much
12        as 7 billion, but that's his testimony.
13             Okay.  Dr. Lipowicz.
14             Could you bring that Philip Morris 2010
15        exhibit up, if you would.  We're going to move
16        to the one before that.
17             He had -- if you remember, he had that
18        nice, beautiful chart of all the things they
19        had done.  They had 14 improved --
20             There it is, right there.
21             Mr. Sales asking questions about it.
22        There were 14 things that they did that showed
23        what a good company they were, what a good
24        company they were, warnings on packs, no ads,
25        no sponsored concerts.  Then we find out in

 1        cross-examination that they were forced to do
 2        it, except for four of them.
 3             Only four out of 14 were voluntary.  The
 4        rest were done by force, by law, or by a
 5        lawsuit, by Attorneys General from around the
 6        country.  That's their good company.  By force.
 7        And that's what they understand is force.  8             Then what else did he say?  This guy --
 9        this doctor worked for 22 years for
10        Philip Morris, and no product he ever worked on
11        ever worked.  Did you hear that?  His smokeless
12        tobacco thing looked like you were smoking a
13        cell phone.  No wonder it didn't work.
14             He says, "Well, now, yes" -- remember that
15        question about addiction, "Well, yes, it's
16        addictive now," but then he quarreled with the
17        definition of addiction.  Well, they had no
18        quarrel in the 1950s and the 1960s and the
19        1970s, when they're writing each other memos.
20             MR. KELLY:  Objection, your Honor.  That
21        misstates the evidence with respect to those
22        memos.  That is not a fair comment, and we can
23        approach on that, your Honor, if you want us
24        to.
25             MR. BARNHART:  It is indeed.

 1             THE COURT:  I'll sustain the objection.
 2             MR. BARNHART:  So what happens is, he
 3        joins the company in 1988.  In 1994, the CFO --
 4        CEO, rather, of his company, as well as others,
 5        stood there, raised his right hand and swore to
 6        tell the truth and swore his company's
 7        cigarettes were not addictive.
 8             MR. HENK:  Objection, your Honor.
 9        Mr. Barnhart said he was going to limit the
10        conduct through 1989 when Mr. Piendle quit
11        smoking.  This could not have had any impact on
12        Mr. Piendle.
13             THE COURT:  Well, I've allowed this to
14        come in, this screen.
15             And are you playing the video?
16             MR. BARNHART:  We will, just about right
17        now.
18             THE COURT:  So overruled.
19             MR. BARNHART:  And they say it causes --
20        smoking causes cancer now, but not for over 50
21        years.  And we have a quick --
22             How much time do I have, Gina?
23             THE CLERK:  Thirty minutes.
24             MR. BARNHART:  I'm going to skip the
25        video.

 1             You can use that, Jack.
 2             He believes low-tar cigarettes are safer
 3        and that yet they sell more -- let's talk about
 4        that for a minute.  He says -- he got up here
 5        and says, "I believe that low-tar cigarettes
 6        are more safe than high-tar cigarettes."
 7             Remember that?  That was just yesterday.
 8        And yet they sell high-tar cigarettes, knowing
 9        they're hazardous, knowing that they kill
10        people.
11             What if -- what if, in the 1950s, instead
12        of trying to fight, they came clean with the
13        Surgeon General and they came clean with the
14        medical establishment and they came clean with
15        the government?
16             MR. KELLY:  Objection, your~Honor.  That
17        is not part of what the jury found harmed
18        Mr. Piendle. 19             MR. BARNHART:  It is indeed.
20             MR. KELLY:  That violates your
21        instructions, your Honor.
22             MR. BARNHART:  It has directly --
23             MR. BIERSTEKER:  Objection.
24             MR. BARNHART:  It's directly to do with
25        defective cigarettes.

 1             THE COURT:  I'm going to sustain.  Limit
 2        your comments to the defective . . .
 3             MR. BARNHART:  All right.
 4             If they had addressed the defects in their
 5        cigarettes in the 1950s, and if they had done
 6        it hand in glove with the government, things
 7        would be a whole lot different.
 8             All right.  So how do you effectively
 9        punish two multimillion dollar companies?
10        Right?  Well, you determine under the law an
11        amount to punish, to deter --
12             MR. KELLY:  Your Honor, that violates your
13        instructions directly.
14             MR. BARNHART:  It does not.
15             THE COURT:  With respect to any reference
16        to the value of the company, be specific based
17        on the evidence.
18             MR. BARNHART:  Yes.  Yes, your Honor.
19             You've heard the evidence as to how
20        much --
21             MR. KELLY:  The objection is sustained,
22        your Honor?
23             THE COURT:  The objection is sustained.
24             MR. BARNHART:  You've heard the evidence
25        as to how much the net worth of one was and how

 1        much they made.  You have the financial
 2        statement.  Thank goodness that we have an
 3        accounting professor and financial analyst.
 4             You guys know a lot more about reading
 5        financial statements than we do.
 6             You're going to determine an amount to
 7        punish, to deter, but not destroy, and the
 8        amount should fit the resources of the
 9        wrongdoer.
10             Let me give you an example.  If I do
11        something terrible, just terrible, and I've
12        done it for a long time, but I have $1,000 in
13        the bank, if you take 1 percent of my assets,
14        that's $10.  That may not be enough of a
15        punishment.  If you take 10 percent of my
16        assets, that's $100, and I would feel that.
17        But if, on the other hand, we have another
18        person who is a wrongdoer and they have a
19        million dollars in the bank, 1 percent of their
20        assets is, what, $1,000, or less?
21             You guys help me out with the math.
22             10 percent would be $100,000.  And what
23        happens is, to make an effective punishment,
24        the punishment has to fit the wrongdoing.  It
25        has to fit the assets of the wrongdoer, and

 1        that's what you have to decide.
 2             So there are some financial calculations
 3        that we did.  4             If you would.
 5             All right.  So what do we know from the
 6        evidence?  We know from the CFO that
 7        R.J. Reynolds has at least a $6 billion net
 8        worth.  10 percent of that net worth is
 9        600 million; 5 percent is 300 million;
10        1 percent is 60 million; a half a percent is
11        30 million.
12             All right.  This is up to you.  I'm not
13        going to suggest to you how much, but you need
14        to make the punishment fit the assets of the
15        wrongdoers, based on what they did.
16             And what do we know from their financial
17        records?  They're net after-tax profit is
18        not -- about $900 million.  If you divide that
19        by 365 days in a year, that equals about
20        $2.46 million a day, times 26 days of trial,
21        which I just used this in an illustration.  It
22        seems like longer, doesn't it?
23             So that would be just for the profit they
24        made, the net profit they made after taxes,
25        during this trial, is $64 million.  So there's

 1        another way to look at it.
 2             Mr. Adams' annual compensation is
 3        $3.67 million.
 4             MR. HENK:  Your Honor, we addressed this
 5        before Mr. Barnhart started.  He wasn't
 6        supposed to say that was during this trial,
 7        that amount of money --
 8             THE COURT:  It needs to be reflected as
 9        the time frame that it actually relates to.  I
10        think it was 2009, it was an average.
11             MR. BARNHART:  Right.  This is their net
12        annual after-tax profit for 2009.  Mr. Adams'
13        annual compensation, he just testified, was
14        3.67 -- $3.66 million.  And if you, by
15        illustration, were to multiply that by the 23
16        years of which Charles Piendle's life was
17        shortened, that would be $84 million.  If you
18        took 27 1/2 percent, which you did, that would
19        be $23 million or less than four-tenths of
20        1 percent of their net worth.
21             So look, that's for you and you and you
22        and you to decide.  But those are
23        illustrations.
24             And let's go on to the next one.
25             Philip~Morris is a bigger company, so the

 1        numbers are bigger.  Their net annual after-tax
 2        profit, 2.9 million.  I went through the same
 3        analysis.
 4             MR. KELLY:  Your Honor, that's a
 5        misstatement of the evidence.  There was no
 6        testimony concerning the comparative size of
 7        the two companies by any measure.
 8             MR. BARNHART:  I think the jury can figure
 9        it out by looking at the numbers.
10             THE COURT:  Well, I'll sustain the
11        objection, and let the evidence speak as to
12        that issue.
13             MR. BARNHART:  You can look at the
14        evidence and the numbers yourself. 15             So divided by 365 days, it works out to
16        about $7.98 million a day in after-tax profit.
17        Again, looking at the 2009 figures, you can do
18        the math on that and you can look at it.  That
19        would be about $207 million, and, again, just
20        based on 2009 figures.
21             There is -- Philip~Morris is owned by
22        Altria.  Looking at the figures, the financial
23        statements you'll have in evidence for 2009, if
24        you look carefully, you can see that dividends
25        were passed by Philip~Morris to Altria, just in

 1        this one year, 2009, and that was about a
 2        little less than $3.5 billion.
 3             And again, if you take 10 percent of that,
 4        it's about 350 million.  If you take 5 percent,
 5        it's 175~million.  If you take 1 percent, it's
 6        35 million.  The last is just to show the
 7        relative value of those, and you can see that
 8        from the records themselves.
 9             All right.  So what does that mean?  You
10        need to decide a punishment which will fit.
11        You need to decide, based upon the worth of
12        these corporations, based upon the money they
13        have, the money they make, what kind of award,
14        what kind of punishment will make them stop,
15        will punish them and deter them from making bad
16        acts again.  And it varies.  If they were poor,
17        it would be one, it would be one thing.
18             MR. HENK:  Objection, your Honor.
19             MR. BARNHART:  If they were middle class,
20        it would be another.
21             MR. HENK:  Objection, your Honor.
22             MR. BARNHART:  You have to go based upon
23        the evidence.
24             THE COURT:  Just one moment.  There's an
25        objection.

 1             MR. HENK:  Your Honor, Mr. Barnhart is
 2        now, with this up on the screen, suggesting
 3        that the jury should use the numbers they're
 4        seeing to award punitive damages.  That would
 5        be unconstitutional.  It has to bear
 6        reasonable --
 7             MR. SCAROLA:  Pardon me, your Honor.  This
 8        is an improper speaking objection.
 9             THE COURT:  I'm going to overrule the
10        objection.
11             MR. BARNHART:  All right.  So let me come
12        back to this.  I didn't suggest a number for
13        you, but I gave you the figures for you to do
14        it yourself.  Some of those numbers are way too
15        high.  You need to decide, and you need to
16        decide based on your common sense.
17             And what do you do?  Your verdict, when
18        you go back there, should stand for what's
19        right.  Should stand for what's right.  You
20        should let them know, Philip~Morris, RJR, that
21        on this day, in this courtroom, a jury in
22        Florida decided that we won't tolerate this
23        kind of conduct anymore.  We won't stand for
24        it, and if you do it, if you do it, you're
25        going to be punished. 8110
 1             And the extent of that punishment is up to
 2        you.  Thank you very much.
