PLAINTIFFS' CLOSING ARGUMENTS
MS. BARNETT:  Good morning.
In a little while, you'll go back in the deliberation
room and you'll have three jobs.  One is to answer the
questions that are on the verdict form.  Second is to make
sure that everybody on the jury follows the law as the
judge instructs you on what the law is.  And then third is,
before you answer any questions on the verdict form, you'll
need to explain to each other why you feel the way you
feel.
So for the next 30 minutes, I'm going talk to you.  I'm
going to reserve hopefully 15 minutes.  For the next
30 minutes, I'd like to talk to you about some ways to do
that.
As you recall, remember, we're suing the cigarette
companies for three reasons.  The first reason is they
     7
 1
violated the simple safety rule that a manufacturer can
 2
never lie about a danger it knows about in its product.
 3
And even those men from the cigarette companies who came on
 4
those videotaped depositions we showed you, even they
 5
agreed a manufacturer cannot lie.  
 6
And let's look at what Mr. Colby said.  Let's look up
 7
on the screen.
 8
 9
Can we put that on the screen?
Mr. Colby said an individual -- cigarette companies
have a duty to be truthful and a duty to not mislead the
public.
And let's look at what Mr. Jupe said of Philip Morris.
Individuals are entitled to know the truth about any
product they buy.  
But the cigarette companies violated that rule.  They
lied about the fact that cigarettes cause cancer.  They
lied about the fact that cigarettes were addictive.  They
lied about the fact that the light cigarettes, the low tar
cigarettes weren't any safer.  They lied about the fact
that filters weren't safer.  And they lied about the fact
that the low nicotine cigarettes, so-called low nicotine
cigarettes, didn't actually give any less nicotine at all,
they were just as addictive.  
The proof of this, the proof of all of this comes
straight from the cigarette companies' own records.  They
     8
 1
should have simply told the truth.
 2
And the second reason we're suing the cigarette
 3
companies is because they violated the safety rule that a
 4
manufacturer can't hide a danger it knows about in its
 5
product.  And we know from seeing their records that the
 6
cigarette companies studied addiction and then they
 7
secretly rigged those cigarettes to make them as addictive
 8
as possible and as hard to quit as possible.  And the proof
 9
of this came from the records.  They never should have
secretly rigged cigarettes for addiction.
And the third reason we're suing the cigarette
companies is because they refused to provide full and fair
compensation for what they did so we were forced to bring
them to trial.  
And remember what those men on those videotapes said.
These are both statements from the '90s.  Let's look at
Mr. Kornegay.  He said there's nothing wrong with what
cigarettes companies have done.  
And what about Mr. Brookes?  They don't intend to
change the way they do business, nothing needs changing.
There's no activity in the last 25 years that's
inappropriate.
So I want to talk to you about the instructions and the
verdict form.  And I'll start first with the instructions
that the judge is going to give you.  Ms. London is going
     9
 1
to hold these up, but you'll get a copy these when you go
 2
back to deliberate.  
 3
And the instruction on page 8 is an important
 4
instruction.  And it says -- 
 5
 6
Can you make that bigger because I can't read that.
It says that we have the burden of proving our claims
 7
by a preponderance of the evidence, and it explains that.
 8
A preponderance of the evidence simply means an amount of
 9
evidence that is enough to persuade you that the
plaintiffs' claim is more likely true than not true.  It's
what we've been talking about all along, more likely right
than wrong.  You can have doubt.  You can have doubts on
both sides, but at the end of the day when you weigh them
out, if you find that we're more likely right than wrong
even by just a little bit, then the law says you must
decide that question in our favor.  
So if during deliberations someone says, "I'm just not
sure.  I'm not sure.  I have some doubts about this,"
remember, you don't have to be certain.  You don't have to
be sure.  You can have doubts.  The question is, is it more
likely right than wrong.  And even just by a slightly
amount if it's more likely right than wrong that we're
right, then you need to answer that question in our favor.
And that's right there on page 8 of the instructions.
So let's look at the verdict form.  These are the
    10
 1
questions you'll have to answer.
 2
Question number 1:  Was Carol LaSard addicted to
 3
cigarettes?
 4
And Dr. Burns and Dr. Cummings both concluded that
 5
Carol LaSard was addicted.  They spent decades researching
 6
and publishing and studying in the field -- 
 7
 8
Can you take that down now?  
-- and working with addicted smokers trying to warn
 9
them, trying to help them quit.
And they both explained that what they used -- their
definition they used to determine whether she was addicted
is the very same one published by the United States Surgeon
General and published by the National Institute for Drug
Abuse.  And it's the one they use when they teach doctors
and when they write about this and when they work with
people on trying to help them quit, simply this:  The
chronic relapse in brain disease characterized by
compulsive use despite harmful consequences.  
And they explained how -- Dr. Cummings explained how it
is that smoking cigarettes, it gets into your lungs and
goes to your brain and causes those changes to the
structures in your brain, how it is that nicotine addiction
in cigarettes causes a chronic relapsing brain disease.
And he and Dr. Burns both explained from their
different perspectives how they were able to conclude
    11
 1
confidently that Carol LaSard smoked compulsively and that
 2
she smoked despite harmful consequences and that's how she
 3
met the definition of being addicted.  
 4
And you heard from her family that she smoked
 5
compulsively despite harmful consequences, one and a half
 6
to two packs a day, year after year, for more than
 7
40 years.  She had to smoke first thing in the morning
 8
before she got out of her bed.  She had to leave family
 9
gatherings, including playing with her grandkids, to go
outside and smoke.  
And when she struggled with COPD, having difficulty
breathing, she still smoked.  And when she was dying of
cancer and wasting away at the hospice, she's still
smoking.  That's the picture of addiction.  That's not
somebody smoking just because they like it and think it's
fun.
And remember what the doctors wrote in her medical
record.  Do you remember it said she has been unable to
quit.  And Carol's doctors -- not only were Dr. Burns and
Dr. Cummings clear and firm about this.  Carol LaSard's own
doctors, the ones who saw her, who treated her and who laid
hands on her, who helped her struggle with her COPD, who
gave her the nicotine patch and treated her for her cancer,
they also found the same thing:  She was addicted.  And
back in '96, they wrote that in her medical records,
    12
 1
"Addiction, tobacco abuse."
 2
And in the face of all that evidence, the cigarette
 3
companies brought to you Dr. Samuel who disagrees with the
 4
family who thought she was addicted, he disagrees with
 5
Dr. Burns and Dr. Cummings, and he disagrees with Carol
 6
LaSard's own treating doctors.  
 7
And again, he's never researched or studied or
 8
published anything on any kind of addiction, much less on
 9
nicotine addiction.  And sure, he has four board
certifications which is quite an accomplishment, but none
of them are in addiction medicine or in addiction
psychiatry.  
And he told us that 45 to 50 percent of his time isn't
treating patients, it's doing this forensic work with
lawyers and lawsuits.  And then at the time that he's
actually treating patients, he said less than one percent
of those patients were specifically to treat nicotine
dependence.  And it makes sense because people don't go to
a psychiatrist to stop smoking, to try to help themselves
get over addiction to cigarettes.
And that book he used, he said it was old, the data was
out of date, the research was old, and the criteria are
being changed, there's a new one coming out next month in
May.  
There's no --
    13
 1
 2
 3
MR. GEISE:  Objection, Your Honor, relevance.
THE COURT:  Overruled.
MS. BARNETT:  -- comparison to his qualifications
 4
versus the training and experience and knowledge and work
 5
in the field of Dr. Cummings and Dr. Burns.  And there's no
 6
comparison of his knowledge of Carol LaSard and her
 7
behavior compared to her treating doctors who knew her and
 8
who wrote that in her medical record.
 9
So the answer to question 1:  Is it more likely right
than wrong than Carol LaSard was addicted?  The answer to
that question is yes.
Let's look at the second question.  Was Carol LaSard's
addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine a legal cause
of her lung cancer and death?  There is what it looks like
(indicating).  
And the important thing in the question is whether it
was a legal cause, not was it the only legal cause.  And to
understand that, you need to look at instruction 11 -- I'm
sorry, the instructions on page 11 in your instruction book
in back of you, and it's kind of a long one.
And can you make that a little bigger, please,
Ms. London.
It says this:  In order to prove that addiction to
smoking cigarettes containing nicotine was a legal cause of
Carol LaSard's death, the plaintiff must prove that such
    14
 1
addiction directly and in natural and continuous sequence
 2
produced or contributed substantially to producing such
 3
death so that it can be reasonably said that but for the
 4
addiction the death would not have occurred.
 5
In order to be regarded as a legal cause of death,
 6
addiction need not be the only cause.  Addiction may be a
 7
legal cause of death even though it operates in combination
 8
with the act of another, some natural cause or some other
 9
cause if the addiction contributes substantially to
producing such death.  
So it's important.  As I said, this instruction says
addiction doesn't need to be the only cause of her lung
cancer and death.  It just must be a cause.
So if you decide that you think either addiction was
the only cause of her marked compulsive smoking, her lung
cancer and death or that was one of many causes that
contributed to her lung cancer and death, you must find for
us and say, yes, it's more likely right than wrong the
addiction was a cause of her lung cancer and death.
So if in deliberations someone says, "I think Carol's
at fault here, too," or, "I think someone else is at fault
here, too, and so I can't answer this question," remind
them that the question is not whether addiction was the
only cause, the question is only whether addiction was one
of the causes, a cause.  
    15
 1
And we'll talk about what to do with the other possible
 2
causes of her lung cancer and death in a minute later on in
 3
the verdict form.
 4
Now, Dr. Cummings explained how people who become
 5
addicted, their brains become wired for nicotine, they
 6
crave nicotine in their body, the need for nicotine to fill
 7
those extra nicotine receptors that they've grown that make
 8
someone smoke compulsively year after year after year, day
 9
after day, decade after decade, just like Carol LaSard did.  
And Dr. Cummings and Dr. Burns explained clearly and
firmly that addiction is what led Carol LaSard to smoke
these defendants' cigarettes compulsively for all those
decades.
And Dr. Burns explained to us, he showed us those
slides about cancer.  Do you remember those?  And he
explained to us that that's what it takes, the compulsive
smoking day after day, year after year, decade after decade
to slowly break down the body's defenses.  It doesn't
happen if you just smoke on the weekends or every once in a
while, something like that.  It's addiction that causes the
lung cancer.  
And Dr. Burns showed you his conclusion that it's
addiction that causes the lung cancer.  It's not just his.
It's published in the 2010 Surgeon General's report.  It's
Exhibit 237.  It will be back there with you.  It says
    16
 1
addiction is the fundamental reason that people persist in
 2
using tobacco products, and that's what causes these
 3
diseases.  
 4
And if you remember that Mr. Gentry, on the video, he
 5
even said "a fundamental reason."  He wouldn't say "the
 6
fundamental reason."  But it's the reason people smoke.
 7
It's the reason she smoked.  It's how she got the lung
 8
cancer.  
 9
So is it more likely right than wrong that addiction
was one of the causes of her lung cancer and death?  The
answer to that question is yes.
So if you answered yes to those questions, you pull out
your sheet of the Engle findings which will be page 12 of
your instructions.  We'll talk about them.  But let me just
show it to you so you can see what it looks like.
If you answered yes to those questions, these are the
Engle findings from that prior trial that you've heard
about and the judge will instruct you about, they apply
here, they're the law, and they cannot be questioned.  And
we'll read through them in a minute.  
But question 3 is the next question on the verdict form
which says:  Please state as to each defendant whether
smoking cigarettes manufactured by the defendant -- 
I cannot read that, it's so small.  
-- were a legal cause of Carol LaSard's lung cancer and
    17
 1
death.  And the answers to those are yes and yes.  There's
 2
absolutely no dispute that the brands Carol LaSard smoked
 3
are manufactured by Philip Morris and by RJR, who's here.
 4
Do you remember American Tobacco, Brown and Williamson, and
 5
RJR all are now part of one company, RJR.  
 6
You'll see in the stipulations, the judge will read
 7
them to you, pages 6 and 7 of your instructions, set out
 8
exactly the brands she smoked and that these are the folks
 9
who made them.
And Dr. Burns explained to you, it's perfectly clear,
Philip Morris's cigarettes caused her lung cancer and
death.  And the Reynolds cigarettes and American and Brown
and Williamson cigarettes caused Carol LaSard's lung cancer
and death.  Not one witness came in here and told you
anything different.  So the answer to question 3 -- 
Can we put up question 3 again?  Wow.
-- is yes and yes.
Now, I want to talk about questions 4 and 5 together
because they really go together.  And those are:  Please
state as to each defendant whether Carol LaSard relied to
her detriment on the defendant's concealment or omission of
material information concerning the health effects or
addictive nature of smoking cigarettes and, if so, whether
it was a legal cause of Carol LaSard's lung cancer and
death.
    18
 1
And there's some follow-up questions I'll talk about in
 2
a minute.  But let's look at question 5.  
 3
Can you just cover up the other so we can just look at
 4
the question, please.
 5
Please state as to each defendant whether Carol LaSard
 6
relied to her detriment on the defendant's agreement to
 7
conceal or omit material information regarding the health
 8
effects or addictive nature of smoking cigarettes, and if
 9
so, whether it was a legal cause of Carol LaSard's lung
cancer and death.
Now, there is a lot in there.  That's a big long
question.  But here is what you don't have to decide.
Can you put back up those Engle findings, page 12,
Engle finding number 4.  
The Engle defendants, which includes these
defendants -- whoa -- concealed or omitted material
information not otherwise known or available knowing the
material was false or misleading and failed to disclose a
material fact concerning the health effects or addictive
nature of smoking cigarettes or both.  
And number 5, the Engle defendants agreed to conceal --
agreed to conceal or omit information regarding the health
effects of cigarettes or their addictive nature with the
intention that smokers in the public would rely on this
information to their detriment.
    19
 1
These two findings are the law and they cannot be
 2
questioned in this case.  And it's important.  It says what
 3
the defendants concealed and what they agreed to conceal
 4
and omit was not already known, was not available.
 5
So if in deliberation somebody says, "Look, the
 6
information they had, that information was out there, she
 7
knew it.  She -- her doctors told her to quit, her husband
 8
and daughters told her quit.  She had family members die of
 9
cancer.  She knew it was bad for her," remind them it
cannot be questioned.  It's already been found as a matter
of absolute law of this case that what was concealed and
omitted was not otherwise known or available.  That's the
law.  It's right here on page 12 in the jury instructions
you will have.  
And so if in deliberations someone forgets and someone
says, "Well, look, that wasn't a secret, that wasn't a
mystery," remind them, just show them page 12.  Right here
is the finding:  What they hid was not known or available.
And remember, too, nobody knew that the filters and
that the light and the low tar cigarettes were not any
safer.  And nobody knew that those little nicotine
cigarettes were just as addictive at regular cigarettes.
The only question for you is whether it's more likely right
than wrong the omission of those things was a cause of her
lung cancer and death, and that's the legal cause question
    20
 1
again.  And I want to look here, it's on page 14 of your
 2
jury instructions.  It explains again what a legal cause
 3
means.  And it's important.  It's "a" legal cause, not
 4
"the" legal cause.
 5
Page 14 says:  In order to be regarded as a legal cause
 6
of death, wrongful conduct need not be the only cause.
 7
Wrongful conduct may be a legal cause of death even though
 8
it operates in combination with the act of another, some
 9
natural cause or some other cause of a wrongful conduct --
sorry -- if the wrongful -- if the wrongful conduct
contributes substantially to producing the death.
So again, if you decide that the wrongful conduct, the
omissions and the concealment, lies and untruth were the
only cause of her lung cancer and death, or if you decide
that was part of the whole picture and it was one of the
causes, one of the many causes of her lung cancer and
death, either way you must find for us and answer yes.
And there's two ways we have heard about in this
courtroom that these omissions caused her lung cancer and
death.  The first has to do with omission of cancer.
Dr. Burns showed us the cigarette companies knew Americans
were starting to quit smoking because they were worried
about cancer because all these reports came out, and the
cigarettes companies made a choice.  They made a choice to
hide the truth, to lie about it, to hire these people to
    21
 1
create this fake controversy, this debate, the "Can we have
 2
an open debate?"  There was no scientific debate.  And they
 3
also decided to market these low tar light cigarettes as
 4
safer, to keep people keep smoking, to intercept people who
 5
were worried.
 6
Dr. Burns showed us how these lies worked, not just --
 7
not just on Carol LaSard, but on the entire generation of
 8
the girls and women who were born when she was born and
 9
started to smoke when she started to smoke.  That's what
that -- that's what that red line was.
And he -- and what does the cigarette company man have
the say on these videos?  Dr. Heimann -- I'm sorry.
Mr. Heimann said was not what they intended.  Cigarette
companies intend for customers to rely on their
advertising.  It's our promise to the customer.  
And what about Mr. Schindler about whether it worked?
He said, "Yes, we spent" -- oh, I'm sorry -- "We spent
$100 million on advertising to get people to switch."  They
know they worked.  
And by the way, I know it was hard to sit here and
watch those videos, and I'm sorry we put you through that.
It was long because we had the parts that we wanted to show
you, and in all fairness we included the parts the
cigarette companies wanted to see, too.  But we had to show
those videos because we were afraid that the cigarette
    22
 1
companies might not bring a single witness here to answer
 2
our questions about what they did.  So that's why we played
 3
those videos.
 4
 5
 6
MR. REILLY:  Objection, Your Honor.
THE COURT:  Overruled.
MS. BARNETT:  Dr. Burns concluded, yes, more
 7
likely right than wrong that the omissions and concealment
 8
about cancer were a cause, a cause, one of the causes of
 9
her lung cancer and death.  
And we heard it directly from Cheryl, Carol LaSard's
daughter, and Cheryl's ex-husband who said Carol LaSard
smoked those low tar cigarettes because she thought they
were safer, they were supposed to be safer.  And in fact,
even Dr. Samuel admitted that, if you remember.
So that's how we know the concealment about cancer was
a cause and that's enough right there to answer those
questions 4 and 5, yes and yes.
But there's more.  Because we heard from Dr. Cummings,
too.  And he said the second way the omission and
concealment caused and substantially contributed, that was
the lies and hiding and concealment about addiction.  He
explained how they secretly rigged those cigarettes for
addiction to make them as hard to quit as possible and
never told anybody what they were doing and how they sold
those low nicotine, supposedly low nicotine, cigarettes as
    23
 1
something that had less nicotine when they knew that they
 2
were just as addictive and didn't give any less nicotine.
 3
Dr. Cummings explained how he concluded, yes, the part
 4
he talked about is more likely right than wrong, the
 5
concealment and omissions about addiction of the nature of
 6
cigarettes including these so-called low nicotine
 7
cigarettes were a cause of her smoking and -- and -- and
 8
other -- smoking which is what caused her lung cancer and
 9
death.  
We know it not just from Dr. Cummings, but again, from
Cheryl Searcy's ex-husband, Jim.  He came in here and
testified she used those low nicotine cigarettes because
she thought they would give her less nicotine, it would
help her quit and wean and cut back.
So either way if you find that it's more likely right
than wrong that the omissions about cancer were a cause of
her death, or if the omissions about the addictiveness were
a cause of her death, or the both, and even if you find
that there were other things also including Carol's actions
that were a cause of her death, you must answer that
question yes -- those two questions yes and yes.
And remember, they totally worked together on this,
which is one of the Engle findings.  But you remember all
those "we don't knows, it may be, it may not be"?  They had
the same script.  They all gave the same message.
    24
 1
And in response, by the way, to all of that evidence
 2
that we showed you, where the cigarette companies could
 3
call any witness that they wanted to to explain what they
 4
did or to show you that they were showing you something
 5
wrong or incomplete or that we -- you know, there was other
 6
information, they didn't call anybody.  They just said,
 7
"Well, people have known since the 1900s that smoking is
 8
bad for you and that it can be hard to quit."
 9
They pointed to Readers Digest and efforts by the
Surgeon General and others before.  No kidding.  We already
knew about that from Dr. Burns who explained it's exactly
that, it's these reports of cancer, it's this information
coming out.  That's why the cigarette companies had to work
so hard.  That's exactly why they did it.
But also other people tried to warn Carol LaSard and
get this information out.  It doesn't help the cigarette
companies escape responsibility in this case because it's
already been determined in those Engle findings on page 12:
What was hidden and concealed was not known or otherwise
available.
And again, nobody knew filters and low tar cigarettes
were not any safer.  Nobody outside the cigarette companies
and certainly Carol LaSard didn't know that those low
nicotine cigarettes weren't low nicotine at all, they gave
us much more nicotine to sustain addiction.
    25
 1
Dr. Burns and Dr. Cummings were clear on how they
 2
concluded that these concealments were a cause.  You heard
 3
it directly from her family and also even from Dr. Samuel.
 4
She smoked low tar, low nicotine.  And she smoked those
 5
filtered cigarettes.  They were sold as being safer.  And
 6
she smoked the low nicotine cigarettes that were sold as
 7
having less nicotine to help her quit.  And those are the
 8
cigarettes that killed her.
 9
So the answers to questions 4 and 5, more likely right
than wrong did the concealment of the omissions and their
agreement to do it together, were they a cause of her
death?  Yes.
Now, the is a second question on those 4 and 5, and
this should be pretty easy.  Did she rely on omissions that
occurred before '82 and after '82?  
And let's just look at the timeline.  Right?  They lied
about cigarettes causing cancer before '82 and after '82.
They sold cigarettes as being safer and having lower tar,
the ones that Carol LaSard smoked, before '82 and after '82
and they never stopped.  And the filters, too, before '82
and after '82, they never stopped and they never told the
truth and they sold -- they -- they rigged the cigarettes
to make them as addictive as possible before '82, after
'82, they never stopped.  And they sold those low nicotine
cigarettes that were supposed to have less nicotine to help
    26
 1
you get off before '82 and after '82, and they never
 2
stopped.
 3
So the answer to those questions on part C there, both
 4
before and after May of 1982.
 5
And you have a separate question for RJR and a separate
 6
question for Philip Morris.  There's no evidence that one
 7
of them stopped and the other one kept going on.  They were
 8
right in those things together the whole way through.
 9
That's why we took all the time to show you each step of
the way along that timeline.
Next on your verdict form you'll see a place to write
percentage of responsibility the cigarette companies had
and that Carol had for her death.  That's question number
6.
And here what's important to know.  Every person and
every company has a responsibility to use -- 
You can take that down.
-- to use reasonable care to protect themselves from
harm and to protect other people from harm that's not
necessary.  And if you don't, you're responsible for the
harm you could have avoided for yourself and for others.
This case is different.  The very thing that the
cigarette companies did took away her ability to exercise
care and to avoid harm.  We already know the cigarette
companies made defective and unreasonably dangerous
    27
 1
cigarettes, because that's in those Engle findings on
 2
page 12, and finding number 3.
 3
And I know this is an awful lot of information, but
 4
you'll have those instructions back there with you so you
 5
can look back at these things.
 6
The cigarettes were defective and unreasonably
 7
dangerous.  And we know that those defective cigarettes
 8
killed her.  And like any manufacturer, they're responsible
 9
for the harm that their product causes.  
What did Dr. Gentry -- sorry -- Mr. Gentry admit in
that videotape?  He said cigarette companies had the
ultimate responsibility.  
And what about Colby?  He said cigarette companies have
a duty to know the truth -- sorry -- to know about the
health risks or health problems associated with their
cigarettes.  
And finally Brookes:  A manufacturer has an obligation
to test products and know they are safe.
But this is worse than just a case where a manufacturer
made a defective product that was unreasonably dangerous
and kill somebody, which would be bad enough.  It's worse
because the cigarette companies made a choice to lie and
hide those dangers and did it to keep Carol LaSard and
millions of Americans smoking, to keep them addicted.
We saw from their records that cigarette companies
    28
 1
had -- what did they have?  100 percent of the knowledge,
 2
100 percent of the knowledge their cigarettes caused
 3
cancer, their filters caused cancer, their light and low
 4
tars weren't any safer, the low nicotines weren't any lower
 5
in nicotine.  And they did everything they could to keep
 6
Carol LaSard's knowledge and keep everybody's knowledge,
 7
including the Surgeon General's, as close to zero as
 8
possible, to keep her smoking.
 9
And we saw that the cigarette companies had a
100 percent of the power and control over how they designed
those cigarettes.  100 percent.  And they made a calculated
business decision to make those cigarettes as addictive as
possible, as hard to quit as possible to suppress her
control and to wire her brain and body for addiction, to
strengthen and nurture and grow the power of addiction over
her, set her up for failure when she tried to quit, keep
the exit door for her closed and to turn her as much as
possible into a lab rat or dog who kept pressing the lever
for nicotine.
You saw that in their own documents.  And as I said,
unlike the cigarette companies, listen, we agree, you
should look at her responsibility, too.  You should.
Unlike the cigarette companies, we've shown you a timeline
that has both sides of the story.
And one way of looking at it, this is just one way to
    29
 1
look at it in terms of coming up with a percent.  You could
 2
start at 50-50:  They made a defective and unreasonably
 3
dangerous product, and she smoked them.  And if they were
 4
on equal footing, equal knowledge, power of control, 50-50
 5
would be one way of looking at it.  But as I said, it's
 6
worse because they didn't just sell defective products that
 7
killed her.  They lied about it and they hid it.  
 8
So if you look at 50 percent to start off with, with
 9
Carol LaSard and divide that up with the basically 50 years
she smoked, that's about 10 percent, right, for every 10
years she smoked.
And if you look, the first 20 years from about here to
here (indicating), there's no warning on the pack.  There's
nothing.  You can't be at fault for using a product that
doesn't even say "may be hazardous to your health."  But
the cigarette companies knew.  They knew the products
killed, and they sold them out there.  
So that whole 20 percent should go over to the
cigarette company and bring them to 70 percent for those
20 years she smoked when there was no warning on the pack.  
And then what about the last 30 years?  There's no
question by then there's information on the packs.  First
it says it may be hazardous.  Then it says it is proven to
be dangerous.
And I remember Mr. Reilly said in his opening, he said
    30
 1
the cigarette companies clung too long to the notion that
 2
smoking hadn't been proven to cause lung cancer.  And maybe
 3
they did cling to that too long, and maybe Carol LaSard
 4
clung to that notion too long, too.  That's certainly what
 5
the cigarette companies wanted her to do.  
 6
But she moved to filters, which they say are safer.  By
 7
the early '70s she's trying to quit.  She tried to cold
 8
turkey, nicotine gum, nicotine patches.  She moved to
 9
lights.  You can't see that.  The light, the low tar.  She
moves to those things to try to quit.  She's trying to do
the right thing here.
And what were the cigarette companies doing during that
whole time?  They were doing everything they could to keep
her smoking.  
Now, could she have tried harder?  Of course.  Of
course she could have tried harder.  Every addict can try
harder.  But at least she tried to quit.  The cigarette
companies never tried to tell the truth, never once, or
give her a chance.
Carol LaSard, in those years, was reaching out for
help.  She didn't have a death wish.  And when she reached
out for help, the cigarette companies put in her hand a
pack of cigarettes that they said had lower tar and would
be safer and a pack of cigarettes that they said had lower
nicotine and would help her break her addiction, cigarettes
    31
 1
they knew were just as addictive and just as deadly.  
 2
The measures, whether she used reasonable care to avoid
 3
harm, and the cigarette companies have to prove this to you
 4
how much -- how much fault should be on her.  And you'll
 5
see, you saw, she's just like -- she's just like all the
 6
other women born when she was born who started smoking when
 7
she started smoking, struggling, trying to quit, not having
 8
much success.  And all they proved about that was, well,
 9
that's slightly less than half the women, 48.7, I can't
remember the percent, the majority didn't smoke.
But let's look at the other side.  How reasonable were
the cigarette companies' efforts to avoid harm?  Well, they
didn't have any efforts to avoid harm to others.  They were
doing everything they could to keep those women smoking,
rigging cigarettes to make them as addictive as possible,
as hard to quit as possible knowing it would kill her.  
And how do you divide up that last 30 years is up to
you to determine based on what you think the cigarette
companies have proved.  But if you divide it up just
equally, 10 percent to her, 10 percent to Philip Morris,
10 percent to Reynolds, that would give you a total of
10 percent fault on Carol LaSard and 90 percent fault on
them, on the two cigarettes companies.  But whatever
everyone agrees you think the cigarette companies have
proved, you should write that down on this line.
    32
 1
But remember, the cigarette companies are 100-percent
 2
responsible for their lies and their concealment and their
 3
conspiracy.  Those are separate questions on the verdict
 4
form.
 5
Now question 7 is how much money the verdict should
 6 be.  And look at the instructions on page 19 that say --
 7 pardon me -- you should assess the amount you find to be
 8 full, just and reasonable compensation.  To figure that out,
 9 you take only one thing into account, the level of harms and
10 losses the cigarette companies caused, nothing else.
11 Everything else is outside the box.  
So, for example, sympathy, of course you feel
13 sympathy.  You can't raise the verdict because you feel
14 sympathy.  Nor could you lower a verdict because, for
15 instance, that money can't bring Carol LaSard back to her
16 family or that's just too much money for one person.
17 They're lots of outside reasons, and jurors have to avoid
18 them all.  
So if a jury uses an outside reason that's not about
20 what's fair, reasonable and just compensation, what are the
21 harms and losses, remind them that's an outside reason and
22 show them page 19 of this instruction.
The answer to question 7, the value of the harms and
24 losses, you need to look at how bad the harm was and how
25 long the harm was and the loss.
    33
 1
Let me give you an example of measuring how bad the
 2 harm was.  If someone causes your mother to have a bad
 3 sprained ankle, you might have to take care of her, you
 4 might have to run some errands for her, you might have to --
 5 you'd be worried about her because you see her in pain, but
 6 that wouldn't be -- you know, there would be some money to
 7 make up for that loss, but not much.  And it would be not
 8 too bad.  It would be very, very low in the scale.  Kind of
 9 the case where I'd have to ask for a verdict in the
10 thousands of dollars maybe.
You move up to the scale and introduce worse, say her
12 whole leg was crushed and she has to have painful surgery,
13 be it a cast, going to physical therapy.  And you're with
14 your mom working with her, through those things with her and
15 worried about her.  That would be more.  That would be more
16 like a midlevel harm and the kind of case where I'd have to
17 ask for a verdict in the hundreds of thousand of dollars
18 maybe.
But let's go up the scale to high.  What happens when
20 you watch your mother suffer a slow, painful death?  There's
21 nothing you can do.  You can't stop it.  You have to watch
22 her be confused, slowly lose her mind, watch her body waste
23 away.  Well, that's the worst kind of harm, the highest
24 level type of case, the kind of case where I have to ask for
25 a verdict in the millions.
    34
 1
And you can do the same thing looking at how long the
 2 harm was.  If you lost your mother for a few days, it
 3 wouldn't be bad, it would be low on scale.  If you lost her
 4 for a few years, that would be more like a midlevel harm,
 5 maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars.  But what happens
 6 when they take away your mom for good, your last 20 years
 7 together?  Well, that's the highest level of type of harm.
 8 And this is that type of case.
 9
We heard from her family and from the medical records
10 how Carol LaSard died.  And we heard how her daughter stood
11 right by her and tried to make her last months as best as
12 she could make them.  We heard from family how special Carol
13 LaSard was.  She and her daughter had the kind of
14 relationship that mothers and daughters dream of, wish they
15 had, loving, lifelong, very close relationship.
And instead of enjoying their golden years together of
17 retirement and trips and all the small special moments at
18 the end of life, in the last 20 years, instead of that
19 Cheryl's left with the final memories of her mom as a shell
20 of the woman that she was, weak and dying in a hospice,
21 still need to be wheeled outside with a turban on her head,
22 shaking in the cold, wheeled out for her addiction to
23 nicotine.  
I told you based on a significant loss, I would have
25 to ask for a significant verdict.  When you consider what
    35
 1 happened to this family, I think it's more likely right than
 2 wrong the verdict should be $6 million.  But it could be
 3 less or more.  You're the ones to decide depending on what
 4 you think is more likely right than wrong, a fair and just
 5 amount for this loss.
 6
Now, the final question is question 8, whether by
 7 clear and convincing evidence punitive damages are
 8 warranted.
 9
First, we're going to look very quickly on page 21 and
10 22 of the instructions have a ton of words, but what you're
11 looking at are:  Were the acts -- 
No, no, down lower.
-- were they intentional?  Were they in reckless
14 disregard of human life?  Were they wantonly and recklessly
15 disregarding the safety and welfare of the public?  Did they
16 accommodate consciously indifferent to the consequences and
17 was it an intentional violation?  And we know absolutely
18 their acts were intentional.  We know from their documents.
19 They speak loud and clear.  No witness disputed it.  
And you'll see -- I'm not going to show it now, but we
21 looked at it before -- Engle finding number 5, what they did
22 was with the intent that people relied on it.  Everything
23 they did was knowing, intentional, for profit.  It was
24 premeditated.  
And the cigarettes knew exactly that they had
    36
 1 engineered the cigarettes to make them hard to quit and
 2 intercept people with lies and with gimmicks to keep them
 3 smoking.  Oh, yeah, slow down any product like Nicorette gum
 4 that might come and help you quit.
 5
Were they reckless?  Did they disregard the
 6 consequences?  Oh, yeah.  Sure as I'm standing here today,
 7 they knew that their cigarettes would kill 400,000 Americans
 8 every year.  That's somebody in America every minute and a
 9 half dies from smoking, 40 to 50 percent of their customers,
10 just from using their product the way it's expected to be
11 used.
Now, if you look at instruction 21, and quickly and
13 last, punitive damages are for punishment of the defendants
14 and to deter others.  They are important.  They are not just
15 to punish, but they are deter, to tell every cigarette
16 manufacturer and every company in this country that you
17 cannot lie about dangers in your products.  You can never
18 hide dangers in your products.
We need you to be plain and clear, every cigarette
20 companies are watching what you say here, every other
21 company is watching what you say here.  America needs you to
22 be plain and clear.  You guys have the power right here,
23 right now, you have the power to tell these companies no,
24 you can never lie about dangers you know about in your
25 product, you just can't do it, you can never hide dangers
    37
 1 you know about in your products, you can't do it, not here
 2 in this community, we won't allow it.
 3
And so when you're deciding if punitive damages are
 4 warranted, the answer to that is yes and yes.
 5
 6
 7
 8
And thank you very much.

MS. BARNETT:  I know you're tired of hearing from
 8
lawyers, so I'm going to try to be brief.  
 9
Look, it's fine to defend yourself when you have done
nothing wrong, but when you have done something wrong,
you're supposed to stand up and admit it.  That's what we
all learned as children.  And what you have seen here from
these cigarette companies is they have refused to accept
responsibility every step of way, in the '50s when they
figured out that cigarettes caused cancer, during Carol
Lasard's entire lifetime they avoided responsibility,
refused to take it when she died.  In the 15 years while
this case, these claims have been pending, they have
refused to accept any responsibility at all, and instead
they just try to distract you with things like alcohol.
How many times did those lawyers just now talk about her
drinking?  What does it have to do with the question on
your verdict form?  Is that just an effort to distract you?
And the timeline they put up that had divorces and
coughs and everything but what the cigarette companies did
    66
 1
and the choices they made.  You can't let them take their
 2
act and their behavior off the table.  They were up here
 3
for 45 minutes, and they said nothing about what they did,
 4
and then attacked Dr. Burns and Dr. Cummings, even though
 5
they have worked for decades with the Surgeon General and
 6
with the National Cancer Institute, and Dr. Cummings
 7
donates half of what he's paid to cancer prevention. 
 8
And they point to their expert, who said he spends 45
 9
to 50 percent of his time on cases with lawyers, and just
two cases for the cigarette companies were more than
25 percent of his revenues, which they didn't account for
those revenues last year.  
And they kept saying, just answer these questions no,
and you get to go home.
Well, I appreciate how hard you've worked and how much
attention you've paid.  And you're not that kind of jury
who's just going to answer no so you can go home a little
earlier on Monday.
They -- not our cigarettes?  Not our cigarettes was one
of their arguments that was just made, it was somebody
else's cigarettes that caused her cancer and her lung
disease and her death.  
If that were true, the cigarette companies surely would
have brought you an expert to come in here and say, oh, no,
it wasn't Philip Morris' cigarettes that caused her lung
    67
 1
cancer and death.  
 2
Dr. Burns was clear about that.  Every one of the
 3
cigarettes she smoked year after year after year
 4
contributed and caused, and you'll see in the stipulations
 5
that Virginia Slims and Benson & Hedges cigarettes, for
 6
instance, that Jim Searcy saw her smoking in the early '70s
 7
were made by Philip Morris.  
 8
And then, oh, she had all the information.  Remember,
 9
they argued that in the Engle trial.  They argued that
everybody knew everything, and they lost.
MR. REILLY:  I object, Your Honor.
MS. BARNETT::  Finally, in this case --
MR. REILLY:  I object, Your Honor.
THE COURT:  Overruled.
MS. BARNETT:  Finally, in this case, which we
showed you, and it's on page 12 under Engle findings, when
they did was concealed, was not known, and it was not
available.  Sure, some things were noted and available.
What they did was not.  That's a finding as a matter of law
that applies in this case.
And then filters are safer?  If there was a witness who
would come in here and tell you that filters actually were
safer, believe me, they would have brought you a witness in
here to say that.  
And I want to show you, just very quickly because I'm
    68
 1
going to run out of time, exhibit -- the Surgeon General's
 2
report.  Dr. Burns was clear about this, and the Surgeon
 3
General's report was clear about it, and you have seen it,
 4
and I don't want to read it to you because I'm going to run
 5
out of time, they haven't reduced the disease risk at all.
 6
All right?  
 7
Now, they keep saying her choice, her decision.  They
 8
made choices too.  Don't forget about those.
 9
You can take that down.
Why did they make those choices to reduce cigarettes?
Why?  To make it hard to quit.  Why did they decide to sell
them as low nicotine and low tar?  To get people who were
trying to quit, so they would use it and think it was
safer.  So they would use it and think that they could cut
back that way and wean off.
And did they know, by the way, that addicting people to
cigarettes meant they didn't have the same kind of free
choice?  They did.  We showed you Exhibit 94.  Let me just
show you that briefly.
The lawyers remind us, we can't defend a case, we
cannot defend a case on free choice if the person was
addicted.  And didn't the lawyers just stand up here and
try to defend their case on free choice?
I want to say one more couple of things.
What the lawyers say in this courtroom is not evidence.
    69
 1
And I just listened to -- you've got notes, you took notes,
 2
you heard the testimony.  I felt like some of what they
 3
were saying, maybe I was in a different trial.  I kept
 4
turning over to Ms. London and saying, did that happen?
 5
Did they say that?  
 6
This thing about her saying over and over, this is my
 7
life, my body.  Didn't she say, I'm trying to quit?  I'm
 8
smoking these low-tar cigarettes because they're better?
 9
I'm smoking these low-nicotine cigarettes because they'll
help me quit.  
Didn't the doctor -- the doctors didn't write in the
medical records, we told her to quit, and she said, it's my
life, my body, I'm not doing it.  It says in the medical
records, she's been unable to quit.
Don't just take cherry-picked things about testimony.
This is about the airplanes and the church and because I
didn't hear any of that come in in this.  Look back at your
notes.  
And the same for the law.  What the lawyers say is not
what the law is in this case.  And legal cause, the judge
will instruct you.
Mr. Reilly just stood up here and said, we have to
prove that she was an involuntary smoker.  
Now, that -- you will not see that in the instructions.
That is not what we have to prove.  I was very careful to
    70
 1
show you what the instructions say, that addiction was one
 2
of the causes.  So it doesn't have to be the only cause,
 3
and it certainly doesn't have to be that she was
 4
involuntary.  What would that be, somebody in a coma?  I
 5
mean, an involuntary smoker?
 6
 7
You will have the instructions and you can read them.  
And I want to close on this point.  Mr. Reilly kept
 8
saying in his opening, were the cigarette companies in the
 9
mirror of the Carol Lasard, were they in the mirror looking
at her?  
No, they weren't in her mirror.  They were off in their
big labs with their scientists and researchers studying
nicotine addiction and hiding that truth.  Reading the
cigarettes to make it hard, impossible for her to quit.
Making the false debate, this whole controversy that they
knew wasn't really a controversy, selling light cigarettes
and the low-nicotine cigarettes just as she was reaching
for help.  Selling them knowing people were trying to quit,
and they could keep them a little longer if they could just
sell them something they thought was safer and would help
them quit.  
So I thank you very much for your time and for your
attention.  The judge will give you the instructions, and
you have got your notes about what evidence you've heard.
Thank you.
