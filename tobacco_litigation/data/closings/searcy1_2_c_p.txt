PLAINTIFF'S CLOSING ARGUMENT ON PUNITIVE DAMAGES PHASE 
MS. BARNETT:  Good afternoon.
And I am told I need that so the court reporter can
hear me, so I'm going to drag it up here.  So sorry about
that.
First of all, thank you so much for your time, for your
attention, for your note-taking.  It's so important that we
have citizens like you who are willing to sit and listen
and bear with us as we try to tell you what you need to
hear about.  And if it wasn't for people like you, folks
like Cheryl would never have a chance to stand up, be able
to stand up and tell their story and ask to be heard.  
So thank you very much.  And she's very appreciative,
deeply appreciative that you respected and recognize the
loss that she suffered and that you have compensated her
and ordered the defendants to compensate her for her loss.  
   140
 1
But now we're at the part of case where you get to
 2
decide how much it will take to punish these defendants for
 3
what they did, and to deter any other company, any
 4
cigarette company, these cigarette companies, any company
 5
from ever doing anything like this again.
 6
It's in the instructions that are much shorter the
 7
judge will read you this time.  Punitive damages are to
 8
punish and to deter.  You will be asked to decide how much
 9
money will it take to punish them for what they did.  And
to deter other cigarette companies and other companies from
ever doing anything like this.  
And you've already heard all of the evidence and you
know exactly what they did and why they did it.  So I won't
go back over that.  But if you give them a low amount here,
that won't punish them, it won't deter anybody else.
And you just heard that evidence we had put on about
the net worth.  And, yes, Philip Morris' net worth of
$3 billion, Reynold's $6 billion.  And we're not here to
bankrupt anybody.  The law wouldn't allow us to do that.
There's one thing you take into account in punitive damages
is their financial resources.  That's why it has to be in
two separate phases.  
But I respectfully submit this to you, the amount you
award should have some relationship to the harm they caused
this family, the harm they caused Ms. Searcy.  And in fact,
   141
 1
that Judge's instructions will say that you have to limit
 2
it to looking at what damage was caused to her when you
 3
decide what to punish them for.  You're also looking at not
 4
just punishment but deterrence.
 5
I would submit respectfully that an amount five times
 6
of what the damage they did, five times would be
 7
punishment.  That would be $40 million.  Five times the
 8
$6 million.  That would make the -- make up for the harms
 9
and losses.  And now we need to punish them.  You could go
higher.  We don't want you to.  We want to be reasonable
here.  Nobody wants a runaway jury.  Cheryl doesn't want to
be unreasonable.  She just wants closure here at this
point.
And complete justice means a sufficient amount to send
a message to the cigarette companies these lawyers work
for.  Send them a message that they need to change what
they're doing.  They need to change it for good.  They need
to pay attention, come down here when somebody has a
lawsuit about what they did.  Please, under no
circumstances, send a message that what they did was okay.
The cigarette companies are watching what you do here.
Other cigarette companies are watching what you do here.
Every manufacturer hears what you do.  The purpose is to
punish and to deter and make sure that every manufacturer
of any product knows it is not okay ever to lie about a
   142
 1
danger you know about in your product, and it is not okay
 2
ever to hide dangers that you know about in your products,
 3
not here in this community.  We will not allow it.

Thank you.
And Your Honor, I hope to reserve a few minutes.


PLAINTIFF'S REBUTTAL ARGUMENT IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES PHASE 
MS. BARNETT:  I'm going to be the last lawyer to
torture you guys here.
You just heard what cigarette companies who spent a
   151
 1
whole week not talking about anything they did now get up
 2
here and ask you for a hall pass, for a pass on all their
 3
conduct and all the evidence we heard.  Yet again, they
 4
don't want to talk about what they did.  
 5
They want to say -- you heard them for a week, you
 6
know, we heard in the 1950s they wouldn't take
 7
responsibility.  When Carol LaSard died, they wouldn't take
 8
responsibility.  For 15 years while this case was pending,
 9
these claims were pending, they wouldn't take
responsibility.  And in this trial, they were trying to
avoid responsibility.
Now, now they finally admit, "Well, maybe, we don't
know, but maybe we did something wrong."  You know what?
They only did that because you held them responsible.  They
didn't say anything about any of that or what they were
doing until you came back with your verdict and said, no,
this is not okay.  And they can't just get a hall pass.  
For instance, they said the people are all gone.  
And by the way, I've got a couple of slides that I want
to -- that I have time to put up on that screen.
Mr. Jupe, he's still there.  He's still there.  He's
the guy who said individuals are entitled to know the truth
about any products they buy.  That guy, Mr. Gentry, the
companies are responsible.  Those people are absolutely
still there at Reynolds and Philip Morris.  
   152
 1
And what they said is, "Well, the FDA regulating us."
 2
True.  Now, they didn't say they agreed to that or they
 3
welcomed the FDA in.  And there's no proof that they're
 4
cooperating with the FDA, which would be a huge change from
 5
the way they worked with the Surgeon General's office.  
 6
But now they say, "Oh, well, the FDA is here so you
 7
shouldn't punish us or deter us."  Giving them a hall pass.
 8
Or "Mr. Teague and those people are dead."  Here's the
 9
problem.  Did they return any of the profits they made from
all those years when they did all those things?  No.  Not a
one.
MR. REILLY:  I object, Your Honor.  There is no
return of profits provision anywhere in this litigation.
THE COURT:  All right.  Go ahead.
MS. BARNETT:  Had they spent any of the money they
made during all those years that now they say, "Oh, they're
gone, don't worry about that."  Did they spend any of that
money to help people quit?  To help spread the word, the
truth?  To help people understand the dangers of all their
cigarettes?  They didn't.  
And they said, "Well, now we have a website.  Now we
have admitted that smoking is addictive and that it causes
cancer."  Did they do that voluntarily?  You heard it from
the witness stand.  They did not.  No.  They don't get a
pass because they were dragged kicking and screaming into
   153
 1
telling the truth when they had to turn over all their
 2
documents.  
 3
And by the way, that comment about their documents on
 4
the web, we heard about the reports that were destroyed,
 5
too, and buried.  So we don't have all their documents.
 6
But the fact that they were forced to turn them over and
 7
put on their website, that they admit these things now
 8
years after she died, that doesn't give them a pass on
 9
responsibility.  
Think of it this way.  If your child blew up the
neighbor's mailbox, of course you have to start with paying
for the mailbox.  But you wouldn't just pay for the
mailbox, you would punish them to make sure that the lesson
was learned and that it was learned for good.
By the way, same for the low tar, low nicotine.  "Well,
we can't sell this anymore."  But not because they
voluntarily agreed not to sell them.  In fact, just earlier
today Mr. Reilly stood here and tried to tell you those
things were safer and reduced the risk.  They're not
selling them because they're not allowed to do it.  But
that doesn't mean they don't need to be punished and they
don't need to be deterred and other companies don't need to
be deterred.
Last thing -- well, remember Mr. Brookes who said in
the '90s, not a million years ago, "We don't intend to
   154
 1
change the way we conduct the business.  There's nothing we
 2
did wrong."  And that Mr. Kornegay said the same thing, the
 3
briar patch guy.
 4
Mr. Reilly only read you one of the things here.  I'm
 5
sorry.  I don't have it on the screen.  You remember him.
 6
"We didn't do nothing wrong."  He goes to the briar patch,
 7
he doesn't know what stuck him.
 8
Now, Mr. Reilly just read you one of three things
 9
you're supposed to consider.  So let me just make sure you
have the other two.
Sure.  Is there mitigating behavior?  What mitigating
behavior have we seen?  "I'm sorry because I got caught.
And I'm not doing it anymore because they won't let me."
That's not mitigating behavior and the need for punishment
deterrence.  
Number two, defendants' financial resources.  And now
you know my secret, I can't do math.  So I said 40 million,
I was thinking that was 6 times 5.  I was thinking that was
twice the 20 years that Carol LaSard had left to live.  But
it could be five times, six times, seven times.  I just ask
that you not go over $40 million.  And it could be less,
it's whatever you think is right to punish and to deter.
And the only thing they understand is when somebody else
holds them accountable.  
But the other thing is this that he didn't read to you,
   155
 1
the judge will.  You're to consider the nature, extent, and
 2
degree of their misconduct.  And there is nothing they said
 3
to you just now at all that changes any of that.
 4
Thank you very, very much for your attention and your
 5
patience with us.  And I thank you.  This is -- our system
 6
is an amazing system.  Our ordinary citizens can come to
 7
court and can listen and can hold people responsible and
 8
accountable for what choices they make.
 9
Thank you.
