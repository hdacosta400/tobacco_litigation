CLOSING STATEMENT
MR. FURR: Please the Court, counsel.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
MR. GDANSKI: Judge, may I approach for
THE COURT: For what purpose? No. We
THE COURT: All right. Let's go, get There's only one possible place to start
Day after day after day of generic
2 and that's to thank you by being so patient for
3 these past five weeks, but I want to look a little
4 closer at why you've had to be so patient. This
5 case took way too long to try, and it took too
6 long to try because you have listened to weeks of
7 evidence that had nothing to do with Mr. Shulman.
9 testimony, and Mr. Schlesinger said something very
10 interesting this morning. He said: We don't have
11 to re-prove the Engle findings, and I agree with
12 him, they don't have to re-prove the Engle
13 findings.
They have to show how those findings
15 relate to Mr. Shulman. Instead of doing that,
16 they spent day after day after day re-proving
17 those findings.
MR. SCHLESINGER: Judge, I object. That
19 attacks the plaintiff's case. They say you can't
20 attack what the defendant did. You can't attack
21 what the plaintiff did, saying we took too long to
22 try the case, and I object to that and move to
23 strike it, that it's our fault. I object to
24 that.
THE COURT: I'll sustain it with regard FURR: There's been day --
THE COURT: And I'll ask the jury to
MR. FURR: There's been day after day
Because this is a case about
1 to the time period but not as to the evidence that
2 was put on by them.
5 disregard that -- the issue regarding the
6 timing.
8 after day of generic evidence that did not relate
9 to Mr. Shulman, and that's what's consumed so much
10 of the time we spent here in trial.
12 Mr. Shulman.
17 refocus on what this case is really about. This
18 is a case about the choices that Mr. Shulman made
19 about cigarette smoking and who is responsible for
20 the choices that he made.
22 plaintiffs have proven to you that the defendants
23 did something wrong that is a legal cause of
24 Mr. Shulman's injury.
It's not working.
Can I go back to my first slide, please?
Okay. Sorry about that.
This is a case about Mr. Shulman. Let's
It's all about Mr. Shulman. It's not a
This is also a case about whether the No wonder she wants nothing to do with a
1 generic case. It's not a case about other
2 plaintiffs. It's not even a case about
3 Mrs. Shulman. You've heard she's making no claim
4 in this case.
Now you did hear from Mrs. Shulman, and
6 we're going to look at her testimony, but what you
7 heard Mrs. Shulman tell you was that beginning in
8 the 1930s, she was telling Mr. Shulman that
9 smoking was dangerous, bad for his health, and
10 addictive.
12 lawsuit based upon a claim --
14 strike. Objection. Move to strike, Judge. I'll
15 stand. There's no evidence of that and that's not
16 appropriate. He said that in opening. I
17 objected. You struck it. He's saying it again in
18 closing. No one ever said that. It's just -- I
19 object and I move to strike, with all due respect.
THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection.
21 The jury should disregard the comment regarding
22 the nonparty.
24 testimony. You know that she knows that she
25 warned Mr. Shulman in the 1930s, and you know that
MR. SCHLESINGER: Excuse me, move to
MR. FURR: Mrs. Shulman, you heard her Now the plaintiff has the burden to
MR. SCHLESINGER: Objection, Judge.
MR. FURR: Your Honor, you sustained my
1 she's made no claim in this lawsuit, and you can
2 figure out why.
4 prove their case. They have the burden. Doubts
5 are not revolved in Mr. Shulman's favor.
7 Objection. You said I couldn't talk about that.
8 They absolutely are resolved in his favor. If
9 we're going to have a debate about it, we can
10 debate; otherwise, it shouldn't come in.
12 objection to that.
14 can't make the argument either.
16 argument.
I need this on, please, Baron.
THE COURT: Okay. I'll sustain the
19 objection regarding the reference to doubts.
22 that was on during Mr. Schlesinger's.
24 please.
The jury should disregard it.
MR. FURR: I just need the monitor on
MR. SCHLESINGER: Put it on for him,
MR. FURR: Hope this doesn't count
MR. SCHLESINGER: That's right. So he
MR. FURR: I'm making the opposite SCHLESINGER: No, give him the other
And hold his time. I agree. This is my
Thanks, Baron.
MR. FURR: I'll start talking again
Is that okay?
THE COURT: All right. That's fine.
I'll try to use the time we have.
Okay. They have the burden to prove
1 against my time, Your Honor.
3 one. I need him.
5 glitch, not his.
8 while they work on it. Maybe they'll get it done
9 by the time I need my next slide.
14 Mr. Shulman's claims with evidence, with evidence,
15 not with lawyer rhetoric, not with argument, not
16 by trying to generate anger, not by trying to
17 generate sympathy.
20 Hopefully they'll get this stuff fixed.
22 primarily, a case that Mr. -- you even heard
23 Mr. Schlesinger argue this morning that
24 Mr. Shulman was a typical smoker, that he was like
25 all the other smokers exposed to the same things,
It's the evidence that matters.
I'll keep talking for a minute.
What you saw was a generic case But Mr. Shulman is not a generic smoker.
1 believed the same things, and affected the same
2 way.
4 He's simply not. You know enough about
5 Mr. Shulman now to know that, and I want to start
6 by saying, I hope that you believe we've treated
7 Mr. Shulman with dignity and respect throughout
8 these proceedings.
I have nothing bad to say about him. I
10 hope I never said anything that you thought I was
11 trying to say something bad about him. Nothing
12 bad to say. He's a brilliant man. He's a
13 successful man, strong man, tough man.
15 he was a highly informed man, one of the most
16 early and best-informed smokers you could ever
17 imagine.
And now I do need my slides, Your Honor.
MR. GDANSKI: Give him this one. Just
20 turn it. We'll figure it out on the lunch break.
21 I'll look up here. It's all good.
Can you see that, Jeff?
MR. FURR: Yeah, thank you very much.
24 Thank you very much.
But most importantly for our purposes,
Okay. I want to spend a few minutes of You heard it again during closing
1 what we have left this morning. I want to begin
2 comparing for you the generic case that was put on
3 by the plaintiffs to the actual facts of
4 Mr. Shulman's case, because it's the facts of
5 Mr. Shulman's case that really matter, and I want
6 to start by looking at -- you heard this many,
7 many times during the trial.
9 argument, this argument that smoking was
10 normalized, that everybody was doing it, and that
11 nobody thinks there was anything wrong with it.
Plaintiff's generic case, everyone
13 smoked everywhere and smoking was normalized.
14 That's what you heard, but you know that's not
15 Mr. Shulman's case.
17 opposite, that his parents didn't want him
18 smoking, that his mother was antismoking, that his
19 siblings, both sisters and his brother didn't
20 smoke.
He got punished many times in high
22 school for smoking. He told you about that.
Mrs. Shulman, of course once he met
24 Mrs. Shulman, she was against his smoking, her
25 parents were against his smoking. He went to work
Mr. Shulman's case was exactly the 1 at Watertown Arsenal and got reprimanded for
2 smoking and also the next place, I can't remember
3 the name of it that he went to during the war, the
4 other place where he was working on assisting in
5 developing machinery for the war, he got
6 reprimanded.
Everywhere Mr. Shulman went, he got
8 reprimanded and was told not to smoke, and, in
9 fact, rather than smoking because it was
10 normalized and okay, Mr. Shulman told you that he
11 joined the group of kids that were smoking because
12 it was frowned upon and they were doing it
13 in defiance of social norms.
15 environment, what was normal in his family,
16 friends, school, and workplace, smoking was not
17 normalized. It was disapproved of.
19 this morning about concealment, about the
20 concealment of information regarding the dangers
21 and addictive properties of smoking.
23 who basically said: It's a falsification of
24 history to say that people knew that smoking was
25 dangerous and addictive in the 1930s.
Plaintiff's generic case was Dr. Proctor
So when you look close at his micro
Lots of information -- lots of argument That's what Dr. Proctor said to you.
Let's look at what Mr. Shulman's case
A. Yes.
Q. And when you told Mr. Shulman that
(Video clip played as follows:)
Q. Going back to when you were dating
2 But you know by virtue of having seen this
3 evidence, that's not Mr. Shulman's case.
5 is. Mrs. Shulman did come and testify, and here's
6 what she said to you.
9 Mr. Shulman, you told him that cigarette smoking
10 was not good for him then?
13 cigarette smoking was not good for him, you meant
14 that it was unhealthy?
17 Mr. Shulman, you told him that you thought he was
18 addicted to cigarettes?
21 Mr. Shulman, you told him that you thought he was
22 addicted to cigarettes?
25 cigarettes were unhealthy for him and that you
A. Yes.
Q. And going back to when you were dating
A. Say that again, please.
Q. Going back to when you were dating
A. Yes.
Q. And when you told Mr. Shulman that A. No.
Is there any way we can improve the
(Video clip played as follows:)
1 thought he was addicted, he didn't try to argue
2 with you, did he?
(Video clip concluded.)
Mrs. Shulman, from the time they were
6 dating, she was telling him it was bad for him,
7 that it was unhealthy for him, that he was
8 becoming addicted and he never disputed anything
9 she said.
11 sound quality?
But it didn't stop there. You heard
13 Mr. Shulman testify. Remember, we're comparing
14 this plaintiff's generic case.
Q. You told Mr. Hammer that you thought
17 that you were addicted to and were hooked on
18 cigarettes in the 1940s, right?
21 smoked, all the people around you, your family
22 members were warning you that you should quit
23 smoking because it was bad for your health,
24 weren't they?
A. Yes.
Q. Sir, from the 1940s on, while you
A. Yes, that's true. (Video clip concluded.)
In the 1940s, Mr. Shulman believed he
3 was addicted and his family members were warning
4 him that smoking was bad for his health, and he
5 was very forthcoming in admitting that on
6 cross-examination.
And, you know, when you take a step back
8 from this and remember that the claim in this case
9 is that the concealment that smoking is dangerous
10 and that smoking is addictive was a cause of
11 Mr. Shulman's injuries, you now know everything
12 you need to know to reject that claim.
You know that he had been told in the
14 '30s by his wife, that he never argued with her
15 about it as Mr. Shulman just told you, at the time
16 he began smoking he thought he was addicted.
You can't conceal something from
18 somebody who already knows it. If somebody
19 already knows it you can't harm them by attempting
20 to conceal it from them.
22 1940s, he believed he was addicted and that
23 everybody was telling him, his family members and
24 everybody around him was telling him that smoking
25 was bad for him.
And Mr. Shulman just told us that in the You simply can't harm somebody by
Let's look closer. There was a lot of
Nicotine in cigarettes hijacks the brain
Addicted smokers cannot quit.
Addicted smokers continue to smoke until
2 concealing information from them if they already
3 know it.
5 discussion in this case about addiction. Here was
6 plaintiff's generic case on addiction.
8 and produces a powerful pressure on a person to
9 smoke over and over again.
12 they develop a smoking-related disease.
14 case because you know this is Mr. Shulman's case.
15 When his daughter-in-law, Yvonne, challenged
16 Mr. Shulman to quit, he took the cigarette out of
17 his mouth, threw it down and never smoked again.
18 No medication needed, no counseling needed, no
19 help from any other family member. He made up his
20 mind, took it out of his mouth, threw it down and
21 never smoked again.
And as you now know given the concession
23 by Mr. Schlesinger this morning, Mr. Shulman quit
24 smoking 40 years ago. 40 years ago, in 1975 he
25 quit smoking.
But you know that's not Mr. Shulman's You also know that he quit 20 years
Let's look at the next issue. Let's
And you know that that was the only
2 occasion that he had ever gone even 24 hours
3 without a cigarette since he began smoking, and he
4 could have quit anytime that he chose to.
6 before he was diagnosed with bladder cancer, and
7 because you know when he switched to filtered
8 cigarettes in 1960, you know that -- that was 35
9 years before his bladder cancer was diagnosed, 35
10 years.
12 look at plaintiff's generic case on advertising.
13 Here is the advertisements he's put in front of
14 you. Advertisements depicting men and women
15 enjoying cigarettes together, advertising making
16 smoking look glamorous and fun.
These were the ads they showed you for
18 Lucky Strike, men and women having a good time,
19 smiling, enjoying cigarettes together.
21 case. Mr. Shulman's case was the opposite.
22 First, you know because he told us that the only
23 reason he began smoking was to be part of the
24 defiant gang that he was hanging out with.
25 Advertising had nothing to do with that.
But you know that's not Mr. Shulman's They weren't enjoying cigarettes
But you also heard that not only did
She wanted no part of it. Do these
Second, you know that from the 1930s on,
2 Mrs. Shulman constantly warned Mr. Shulman and
3 asked him to quit. She told him she hated his
4 smoking. He told you she was on his case all the
5 time.
7 together like this generic advertising campaign.
8 His smoking was a point of dissension in their
9 marriage.
11 Mrs. Shulman hate smoking, you heard Dr. Seidman
12 explain that by 1943, around the time of the birth
13 of their first son, Bruce Shulman, who is departed
14 now, by that time, Mrs. Shulman had put her foot
15 down and refused to buy him cigarettes anymore.
17 pictures depict the Shulman family? Is this how
18 the Shulman family thought about smoking?
20 opening statement and throughout this trial, you
21 heard smokers try and try and try and try and they
22 quit and relapse and relapse because they can't
23 get the monkey off their back.
25 Addicted smokers suffer severe and painful
Let's talk about this relapse issue. In
Plaintiff's generic case, Dr. Seidman: The woman who shared his life, who lived
1 withdrawal. Relapse is a hallmark of addiction.
That's what Dr. Seidman told you, but
3 you know that's not Mr. Shulman's case.
Dr. Seidman also told you that
5 Mrs. Shulman did not see Mr. Shulman suffer any
6 withdrawal symptoms.
8 with him, who shared their bed together at night
9 for 73 years never saw Mr. Shulman have a
10 withdrawal symptom, never saw it.
And you now know, they've admitted it
12 now, we'll talk about it a little bit more, but
13 Mr. Shulman never smoked again after the mid
14 1970s, and as Harvey told you, when Mr. Shulman
15 quit, he never looked back.
17 smoker who relapsed.
19 plaintiff's generic case on advertising -- excuse
20 me, on smoking and disease because here's the case
21 plaintiffs put on. In fact, you saw a version of
22 it. We took it down. You saw another version
23 today of this chart correlating cigarette
24 consumption with lung cancer.
This was the sort of -- this was the
Mr. Shulman was simply not an addicted
I want to talk to you next about Lung cancer rates rise, but what does
1 string that tied together all of Dr. Proctor's
2 testimony. During Mr. Gdanski's examination of
3 Dr. Proctor, they went back and back and back to
4 this chart to demonstrate how lung cancer rates
5 rise with cigarette consumption.
7 that have to do with Mr. Shulman's case? This is
8 not a lung cancer case. He had bladder cancer,
9 and on cross-examination, you saw how I
10 cross-examined Dr. Proctor, and he admitted that:
11 Bladder cancer rates remain steady. The bladder
12 cancer rates did not change. No matter how many
13 people smoked and how much they smoked, it was a
14 straight line.
16 that was because the influence that controlled the
17 incidence of bladder cancer over the years was not
18 the amount of smoking that was being done, it was
19 occupational exposures, occupational exposures.
20 That's what Dr. Proctor told you.
22 more. Dr. Proctor testified for seven days, seven
23 days of generic testimony, untied in any way to
24 Mr. Shulman.
And, yes, Dr. Proctor has been paid over
And Dr. Proctor explained to you that
Let's talk about Dr. Proctor a little On my cross-examination, he admitted 27
And what he did with that information is
(Video clip played as follows:)
Q. You don't know anything about what
A. Yes. You said it better than I could,
1 $3 million to provide this generic testimony in
2 Engle litigation.
4 different times that he knows nothing about
5 Mr. Shulman, and then I asked him this question to
6 try to sort of tie it all up together.
9 Mr. Shulman knew, when he knew it, and what he did
10 with any information he acquired about the dangers
11 of smoking, right?
13 and I tried to say it 12 times, but you put it all
14 in one basket.
17 Dr. Proctor, but the bottom line is what
18 Mr. Shulman knew, when he knew it.
20 what this case is all about because unlike this
21 generic case, when you get your verdict -- you
22 have your verdict form. I forgot. You already
23 have it.
When you study it a little bit closer,
25 and we'll look closer as we go along today, when
(Video clip concluded.)
I appreciate the compliment from plaintiffs cannot prove
What we spent a long time during this
1 you study it closer, you will see that every
2 question on that verdict form either has
3 Mr. Shulman's name in it, or it relates to
4 Mr. Shulman because it's related to a question
5 that had his name in it. It's all about
6 Mr. Shulman.
8 Mr. Shulman's case with generic evidence. He's
9 not a generic smoker.
11 trial doing is looking at tobacco company
12 documents that have nothing to do with
13 Mr. Shulman.
And you heard that the tobacco companies
15 have been in business for a long time, that there
16 are -- Dr. Proctor told you there are over 80
17 million pages of those documents.
And I will tell you straightforward, I'm
19 not here to defend some of the statements in those
20 documents. Some of the statements in those
21 documents were bad. They were stupid. They were
22 offensive. They were rotten stuff.
No one is going to try to defend some of
24 those statements, but that's not the question you
25 have before you. That case has already been What you're here to try is how that
In fact, you have this in your -- you
1 tried. The class action about tobacco company
2 conduct in general has already been tried.
4 conduct relates to Mr. Shulman.
6 have this in your jury instruction. Engle
7 findings: These findings do not establish any
8 defendant is liable to plaintiff in this case, nor
9 do they establish whether plaintiff was injured by
10 defendants' conduct, nor to the degree, if any, to
11 which defendants' conduct was a legal cause of
12 plaintiff's injury.
Those are the questions that you're here
14 to answer. When you see your verdict form, you'll
15 see it's all about whether we -- whether the
16 defendants are liable to Mr. Shulman, whether he
17 was injured by our conduct and whether the conduct
18 was a legal cause of his injury.
20 those questions. So while the findings have a
21 role in this lawsuit as you have been instructed
22 on by the Court, they do not advance the ball very
23 much. That's what you're here to do.
25 break in a couple minutes, so I don't know,
The Engle findings don't answer any of
THE COURT: We're probably going to Mrs. Shulman was warning him. Her
You heard his daughter-in-laws got
1 whenever you're -- a good breaking point is.
MR. FURR: Yes, sir. Thank you.
I want to go back to something I showed
4 you in opening statement. In opening statement,
5 we began talking about how Mr. Shulman was
6 bombarded with information from the time he began
7 smoking.
9 parents were against his smoking. His co-workers
10 were urging him to stop.
He was lucky to have that dentist that
12 was treating both him and Harvey and telling them
13 both about the dangers of smoking. Harvey would
14 go home and tell Mr. Shulman about it.
16 involved. Dr. Seidman explained to you how his
17 sons began warning him in the 1960s, and that's
18 just Mr. Shulman's specific warnings.
Mr. Shulman also of course, as a member
20 of our society, was exposed to all the information
21 contained in these red boxes and was living in the
22 same information environment as others and
23 obtaining the warnings about the dangers of
24 smoking just like everybody else.
What I'm going to do now with the time Then we'll talk about what he did with
And we'll start with this, with
1 we have left, I'm going to start just sort of
2 going around this circle a little bit, reminding
3 you on what the evidence was about Mr. Shulman and
4 what he knew and when he knew it.
6 it, because we're going to keep coming back to
7 that theme.
9 Dr. Proctor. Dr. Proctor is going to -- as
10 Dr. Proctor testified, that by not the 1960s, as
11 Mr. Schlesinger suggested to you today, but by the
12 1950s, the American public was being bombarded
13 with information about the dangers of smoking.
16 that there were literally thousands of scientific
17 articles about the dangers of smoking?
19 '30s and '40s, and they accelerate in the '50s,
20 and by the late '60s, there's already many
21 thousands of articles.
24 all the way back to the 18th century.
Q. It began in the '30s and '40s, right?
A. Sure. I mean there's some -- they go
Q. And, sir, wouldn't you agree that beyond
(Video clip played as follows:)
Q. During those decades, would you agree
A. Yes. Yeah, they really begin in the A. That's right. Yeah, it's big news.
(Video clip concluded.)
By the 1950s, the message was
And let's back up a little bit.
(Video clip played as follows:)
Q. Although you tried to hide your smoking
1 the scientific -- the thousands of articles
2 published in the scientific literature, that there
3 are many times that number of stories published in
4 the popular press about the dangers of smoking?
8 everywhere.
10 Mr. Shulman knew from the time he first tried a
11 cigarette that he shouldn't be smoking.
14 from your parents, they found out about it, didn't
15 they?
18 really got after you, didn't they?
21 cigarettes, weren't they?
A. Yes, they were.
25 point?
A. Yes, they did.
Q. And when they found out about it, they
A. Yes, they did.
Q. They were very upset about you smoking

MR. FURR: Anytime, Your Honor. I'm
THE COURT: All right. Let's go ahead

All right. Ladies and gentlemen of the

CLOSING STATEMENT, CONTINUING
MR. FURR: One of the things we did
4 during lunch was we got some new speakers.
5 Obviously, the sound quality was not very good
6 before lunch.
8 glitch we might have is that some of the videos
9 were recorded at a little bit different volume
10 than others.
When Mr. Shulman and I were having our
12 very quiet conversation, when we play that, we'll
13 try to turn that down so it's not too loud in your
14 face, but if it's too loud, please just let us
15 know. Okay?
17 talking about how the generic case that plaintiffs
18 put on simply does not fit Mr. Shulman's case.
One of the things we talked about was
20 how, unlike their generic case where smoking was
21 normalized and everybody smoked, in Mr. Shulman's
22 group, nobody smoked. It was disapproved of. And
23 we talked about all the people who were urging him
24 to quit from the beginning.
When we broke this morning, we were
We then talked about how in plaintiff's
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
Of course, we know in Mr. Shulman's
1 generic case, nobody knew anything about the
2 dangers of smoking.
4 case, he was extraordinarily well informed, and he
5 was informed at a very, very early time beginning
6 in the 1930s. And he was informed constantly and
7 consistently with clear, graphic warnings from
8 then on.
And then we talked briefly about the
10 sources of warnings that Mr. Shulman got. We
11 talked about his circle, acquaintances, family,
12 friends, dentist, relationships. We talked about
13 how he would have been exposed to the public
14 health message.
16 beginning to review with you some of the specific
17 evidence that came in this case.
And, again, I'd ask that as you listen
19 to this, you keep in mind those questions that I
20 posed to you earlier: What did he know? When did
21 he know it? And what did he do with that
22 information?
24 you listen to our review of the evidence, I
25 believe that will be of assistance to you when you
If you keep those questions in mind as
And we got to the point where I was
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
Those are the questions that deal with
(Video clip played as follows:)
Q. And from the time you began dating her
1 go to answer Questions 4 and 5 on your verdict
2 form.
4 the issue of concealment and agreement to conceal.
Okay. We were up to this. We were up
6 to beginning to talk about what the evidence was
7 with respect to how Mrs. Shulman warned
8 Mr. Shulman.
11 in the 1930s, Ethel had asked you to stop smoking,
12 right?
15 stop smoking, right?
18 case constantly, right?
A. She was what?
Q. She was on your case, right?
A. Yes.
24 smoking beginning in the 1930s and constantly on.
A. Correct.
Q. I think you said that she was on your
A. Yes.
Q. In fact, she asked you constantly to
(Video clip concluded.)
Mrs. Shulman was after him to stop
So now let's go to -- that was before
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
(Video clip played as follows:)
1 they were married. So now we'll go to how that
2 pattern continued after they were married. They
3 were married in 1941, you might recall.
Q. Now after you got married, Mrs. Shulman
6 kept getting after you about your smoking, right?
A. Constantly.
Q. Throughout your 73-year-old marriage,
9 from the time that you were a smoker, she was
10 constantly after you, right?
14 in 1975, he was constantly after her, but that
15 wasn't the only people talking to him.
17 testimony about how Harvey would go to Dr. Jacobs,
18 their dentist, who gave him very clear, very
19 specific warnings about the dangers of smoking.
20 And he would go home and talk to his father about
21 those warnings.
Q. This requires some more testimony, sir.
24 Will you please turn to Page 73, Lines 7 through
25 10?
(Video clip concluded.)
From the time he met her until he quit
You might recall his son, Harvey's,
A. Yes.
(Video clip played as follows:)
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
You were asked the following question
A. That's what it says here.
Q. Okay.
ANSWER: Every time I saw Dr. Jacobs.
Did I read that correctly, sir?
A. Yes.
Q. And you had the same conversation with
2 and you gave the following answer:
QUESTION: And how many times did you
4 talk to your father about Dr. Jacobs talking to
5 you about not smoking?
10 your father about every six months, correct?
15 specific over time.
18 the health risks relating to smoking after you
19 quit smoking in the 1960s?
22 conversations with your father about this topic?
A. Yes.
Q. And you would talk to your father about
25 things -- about the health risks of smoking such
(Video clip concluded.)
And then those conversations got more
(Video clip played as follows:)
Q. And you also talked to your father about
A. Yes.
Q. You actually had a passionate
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
A. Yes.
(Video clip concluded.)
You might remember that Harvey did
A. Yes.
Q. And you also talked to your father about
1 as the fact that smoking causes cancer, correct?
4 the fact that smoking could cause heart disease
5 and stroke and things like that, correct?
9 follow in his dad's footsteps with his love of
10 aviation. He wanted to be a pilot.
He became involved in the process, and
12 Harvey recognized early on that his smoking was
13 inconsistent with the state that he needed his
14 health to be in to be a pilot.
16 as -- he had only smoked for a couple years, late
17 teens, early 20s, and after that he began warning
18 his dad very specifically about the types of
19 diseases that Mr. Shulman has claimed in this case
20 that he didn't know about, cancer and
21 cardiovascular disease.
And then of course, Mr. Shulman, as
23 we've talked about from opening statement on,
24 Mr. Shulman, he's obviously a very intelligent,
25 aware man, plugged in, consumer of information,
And so he stopped smoking, and then
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
1 decision-maker, accustomed to gathering large
2 amounts of information, making decisions about how
3 to run his business.
And one of the things he did during the
5 course of his life is he read. He liked to read
6 the newspaper, and he specifically recalls reports
7 about the 1964 Surgeon General's report.
(Video clip played as follows:)
Q. Sir, you remember hearing about the
10 Surgeon General's report in 1964, don't you?
A. Oh, yes, I do.
Q. And you recall at that point in time the
13 Surgeon General made remarks about smoking being
14 bad, right?
18 about the consequences of smoking.
22 talked about the content of what you breathe in
23 when you smoke a cigarette, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And he --
A. I don't know if he said that. He talked
Q. The consequences of smoking?
A. Yeah.
Q. Okay. And the Surgeon General also
A. I think so, yes.
Q. You also recall there being stories in
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
(Video clip concluded.)
Didn't stop there either. Two years
1 the newspapers about the 1964 Surgeon General's
2 report, right?
A. Yes.
6 after that of course the first caution label went
7 on the packages, and Mr. Shulman remembers the
8 caution labels and warning labels on the packages.
9 Not only did he personally see them, but his sons
10 would talk to him about those labels.
You might remember Harvey's testimony.
12 He said when that label first went on in 1966, he
13 took it to his father and said: See, I told you
14 so. I told you so, and here's Mr. Shulman's
15 recollection.
18 you learned about the warnings, that caution
19 warning coming on the cigarette packs?
22 even pointing that out to you?
24 me constantly about it.
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And do you remember your sons
(Video clip played as follows:)
Q. Now did there come a point in time when
A. I don't remember when, but they warned
(Video clip concluded.)
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
His sons warned him constantly about it.
I'll show you one more video that has to
3 deal with this idea that smoking had been
4 normalized within his group and that everybody was
5 smoking, everybody approved of it.
7 friend, the pharmacy owner, Mr. Shulman told us
8 that he told -- he was always after him to stop
9 and that he was disgusted with Mr. Shulman for
10 continuing to smoke, and this was very early on
11 when he began running his Clean Brite janitorial
12 company.
15 the Wall Street Journal, didn't you?
A. I don't know -- I don't know if I read
17 it at that time, but I did read the Wall Street
18 Journal.
22 listen to the radio or read newspapers, you would
23 see stories about the horrors of smoking,
24 correct?
A.
Q. And you read the Boston Globe, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And when you would watch television or
(Video clip played as follows:)
Q. Are you read national newspapers like
You'll remember that Mr. Shulman's
Yes.
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
(Video clip concluded.)
Wrong clip. I got ahead of myself.
3 That was the clip where Mr. Shulman specifically
4 remembers reading stories about the horrors of
5 smoking, which of course was the title of the 1959
6 Reader's Digest article.
And now we'll take a look at the clip
8 that I meant to look at before where his friend
9 was after him all the time to stop smoking.
Q. What did you do?
A. So I called this man and asked would he
13 open the store, I need a package of cigarettes,
14 and that was a disaster.
17 I called him at 10:00 at night.
19 with me for smoking cigarettes in the first place.
20 He always told me he -- even though he sold
21 cigarettes in his store, he told me -- he was a
22 friend of mine: Stop, stop, stop. That's all I
23 heard from him.
Q. Why is that?
A. First of all, he was very upset because
(Video clip concluded.)
One of the arguments made to you this
(Video clip played as follows:)
The second thing is he was disgusted
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
(Video clip played as follows:)
Q. Mr. Shulman, the stories you saw are
A. Yeah, it did.
(Video clip concluded.)
Scared the hell out of him. Does that
1 morning was that although Mr. Shulman heard all of
2 this information, he didn't accept it. He
3 rejected it. He didn't believe it. He was
4 confused, but here's what Mr. Shulman told you.
7 about the health consequences of smoking, in your
8 words, scared the hell out of you, right?
12 sound like someone who is confused when they
13 stopped or doesn't believe the information? Of
14 course not.
He understood it. He incorporated it
16 into his understanding of smoking and it scared
17 the hell out of him.
19 He knew that smoking could be addictive and
20 dangerous to your health.
22 that question also, from the 1930s on and
23 throughout his life, his marriage to Ethel, his
24 life with his family, his life in this world with
25 warnings on the side of packages, stories in the
When did he know it? We just answered
So what did he know from the 1930s on?
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
But what did he do with that
Unlike what Mr. Schlesinger argued to
1 media. He always knew, and it scared him.
3 information? He kept smoking. He kept smoking.
Against that background, I want to turn
5 to talking with you about the specific verdict
6 form questions that you are here to answer.
7 Because we are in a court of law, you have rules
8 to follow. There are specific issues to answer on
9 your verdict form.
11 you this morning, this is not a moral referendum.
12 It's not a question of whether or not you think
13 the tobacco industry conducted itself morally or
14 not. It's simply not the issue.
The issue is the specific legal claims
16 that have been made. The first question on your
17 verdict form reads like this: Was Robert Shulman
18 addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine, and,
19 if so, was such addiction a legal cause of his
20 bladder cancer, coronary artery disease, chronic
21 obstructive pulmonary disease?
23 of when the disease manifested and whether
24 Mr. Shulman was a resident of Florida at that
25 time.
The second question deals with the issue
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
Those two questions, taken together, are
So I have taken those two questions and
2 the class membership questions. When you answer
3 those two questions, you will be determining
4 whether or not the plaintiff has proven to you,
5 because it's their burden to do so, that
6 Mr. Shulman was a member of the Engle class.
8 tried to combine them for you to break out the
9 component parts, because although it's a single
10 sentence, embedded within that sentence are
11 actually several different subquestions that you
12 have to answer to answer the overall question.
14 hurdles because it's plaintiff's burden to prove
15 all these things to you. They have to prove that
16 Mr. Shulman met the Florida residency requirement.
18 subject with you during his closing argument. I
19 won't address that any more.
21 plaintiff must prove that cigarette smoking was a
22 legal cause of Mr. Shulman's Engle-qualifying
23 disease; in other words, medical causation. They
24 have to prove to you that, in fact, smoking
25 cigarettes was the medical cause of his disease.
And it's like this. I depicted these as
Mr. Brenner is going to address that
But then they have to prove that then finally, separate and apart
And I'm going to talk about each of
They next have to prove to you that he
2 was addicted to nicotine in cigarettes. That's
3 the addiction requirement that they have to prove.
5 from whether he was addicted or not, they have to
6 prove to you that addiction was the legal cause of
7 his qualifying disease.
9 those diseases with some specificity, but before I
10 even get to that, there is an issue in this case
11 that, in essence, answers all of those questions
12 for you without having to look at anything else,
13 and that's this: Throughout the plaintiff's case,
14 they fought like crazy about the day, the year
15 that Mr. Shulman stopped smoking.
17 evidence from Harvey, saying that Mr. Shulman quit
18 in the 1990s. Mr. Shulman himself testified that
19 he quit in 1995 when he was diagnosed.
21 who worked this answer into everything I asked
22 him, no matter what I asked him, if I said what
23 time of day is it, he'd say: Mr. Shulman quit in
24 the 1980s.
And Dr. Seidman, their addiction expert,
He was so committed to trying to prove
You'll recall that they offered you
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
MR. FURR: That's exactly what happened,
MR. SCHLESINGER: Your Honor, objection.
THE COURT: All right. I'll sustain the
MR. SCHLESINGER: Objection, Your Honor.
1 that fact, I mean we had to get his testimony
2 struck. He couldn't remember the questions I was
3 asking him.
5 Objection, Judge. Move to strike.
7 Your Honor.
9 Move to strike. We have to get his testimony.
10 It's the evidence that's in. It's not the
11 evidence that's out.
13 objection as to the reference to the striking of
14 testimony. You can refer to the testimony that is
15 in, not the testimony that is out.
The jury should disregard it.
MR. FURR: You saw Dr. Seidman, an
18 evasive, unresponsive witness who worked into
19 every answer: He quit in the 1980s.
21 was introduced on that issue, and today,
22 Mr. Schlesinger conceded that Mr. Shulman quit in
23 the 1970s, around 1975.
25 the evidence. The evidence is overwhelming that
But then what happened? The evidence
Why? You know the answer. You've heard
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
So after fighting like crazy during
It doesn't matter anyway. It doesn't
And as I'm about to demonstrate to you,
1 Mr. Shulman quit in the 1970s.
3 trial, conceding it today, what did you hear next?
5 matter. It doesn't matter.
If it didn't matter, why would they have
7 fought so much about this issue? It does matter.
8 It is actually the threshold defining issue for
9 class membership.
11 this is the one that answers all the questions,
12 because the science of medicine is that if
13 Mr. Shulman quit in 1975, the plaintiffs cannot
14 meet their burden of proof by a preponderance of
15 the evidence to demonstrate that he got a
16 smoking-related disease 20 years later, and that's
17 because, and I'm going to review this evidence
18 with you, when you quit, your risk starts
19 declining.
21 smoking. If you're not sick and you get you sick,
22 the likelihood of getting sick goes down
23 immediately and continues going down with each
24 year that you're a nonsmoker, and we'll look at
25 that.
That's why doctors tell you to quit
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
The first thing we had were the medical
But I'm going to show you, as quickly as
2 I can, what the evidence was with respect to when
3 Mr. Shulman quit.
5 records. And, you know, today Mr. Schlesinger
6 also said: We embrace every statement in the
7 organic medical records that were created in the
8 process of Mr. Shulman seeking and being given
9 treatment. We embrace and accept every statement
10 in those records.
Over 20 different records that were
12 introduced to you and read, I cross-examined
13 Dr. Seidman on these, over 20 different records
14 indicate that Mr. Shulman quit in the mid 1970s.
Multiple different providers, different
16 locations, over time, different numbers, so it's
17 not just a matter of one person copying down the
18 record of another. These were records created
19 pursuant to Mr. Shulman providing the information
20 to these providers as he went to get healthcare
21 over time.
And no matter how you do -- what number
23 he provided, when you do the math, if it's 2002,
24 you do the math, you're back in 1970. If it's
25 1995, you do the math, take 20 years off, you're
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
The organic medical records created in
1 back in 1975.
3 the process of obtaining treatment without any eye
4 towards this litigation all converge on the mid
5 1970s with a few outliers that apparently
6 plaintiffs have abandoned because they recognize
7 that those 2015 records that they pointed out to
8 you, those were created in the context of
9 Mr. Shulman sadly going to the Memory and Wellness
10 Center because his memory was fading.
12 which those two 2015 records were generated that
13 the plaintiffs abandoned this morning in their
14 argument.
16 wasn't just the records. Mr. Shulman's own
17 witnesses put the nail on the coffin on this
18 issue.
20 review of the case, Mr. Shulman quit between 1975
21 and 1980. That's their expert.
But maybe the most important witness on
23 this was Dr. Bernsley. This was the doctor that
24 treated Mr. Shulman. This was the doctor who
25 looked him in the eye, asked him questions, and
Dr. Soloway indicated based upon his
And that was the circumstance under
But it wasn't just the records. It he told us that based upon his
Now I'm going to look at one more clip
1 recorded information in the process of providing
2 him urology treatment post-surgically, beginning
3 about 2000, I believe it was.
5 discussions with Mr. Shulman, that he concluded
6 that Mr. Shulman quit smoking in 1972.
8 with you because a question was asked this morning
9 as to why we didn't bring Dr. Hoge.
There were a couple reasons why we did
11 not bring Dr. Hoge, the addiction psychiatrist.
12 But one of the reasons was that the evidence that
13 you would have heard from Dr. Hoge was introduced
14 through cross-examination of either the
15 plaintiff's experts or of Mr. Shulman himself.
17 Mr. Shulman gave a compulsory medical examination
18 interview to Dr. Hoge.
20 each day, a very thorough interview conducted by a
21 clinician, not by the lawyers, by a clinician,
22 Dr. Hoge who asked Mr. Shulman questions. And we
23 played this during Mr. Shulman's
24 cross-examination.
I'm going to show it to you again. It's
As you heard during the trial,
It was over two days, a couple hours
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
It took that long to get the whole story
1 a little bit long. It's three or four minutes. I
2 apologize for that.
4 out, but as you listen to this, I'd ask you to
5 listen to this dialogue and ask yourself three
6 questions.
One question is: When did he quit? And
8 the key to that question in the dialogue you hear
9 will be where he lived when he quit.
11 quit? And the third question will be: Did he
12 ever relapse after he quit?
17 started talking to you about these bad things that
18 had happened --
ANSWER: Yeah.
QUESTION: -- in her family. Someone
21 had -- someone in her family had died. Was it
22 from cancer?
ANSWER: Yeah, her father.
QUESTION: Father died from cancer?
ANSWER: Yeah.
Here is Mr. Shulman's testimony.
(Video clip played as follows:)
The second question will be: How did he
Q. On Page 22, Line 1:
QUESTION: All right. And so she
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
Now just so -- again, so I'm clear, did
ANSWER: No.
QUESTION: Many times?
ANSWER: Many times, but it was never
2 she talk to you -- was this one time that she
3 grabbed you at home?
7 so -- never so intense other times, but this time,
8 this particular time, it was. It rattled --
9 really rattled my brain.
QUESTION: Okay. And it -- it -- it --
11 the -- what she told me was so hard to compute in
12 my mind and so devastating that she challenged me
13 to throw the cigarettes away which I had. I was
14 smoking at the time.
16 were talking to her?
19 challenged you to quit right there?
23 my mouth. I remember this vividly. Took the
24 cigarette out of my mouth and started to think --
25 and I loved this girl, and I wanted to please her.
ANSWER: Yeah.
QUESTION: And what did you do?
ANSWER: Um, I took the cigarette out of
QUESTION: You were smoking while you
ANSWER: Yeah.
QUESTION: And then she -- she
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
So I took my cigarettes, threw them
QUESTION: Was this at your home?
ANSWER: Yeah, at my home.
QUESTION: And where were you living at
2 into -- into the waste basket, and I told her I
3 would never smoke again.
7 this time?
ANSWER: Winthrop, Massachusetts.
QUESTION: This is when you lived in
10 Winthrop. Okay. So you threw them away right
11 there while you were talking to her?
14 that, sir? Didn't you just -- did you never --
15 did you ever have another cigarette?
20 turkey? You know what I mean when I say "cold
21 turkey"?
24 me, cold turkey just means you stop.
ANSWER: No.
QUESTION: Never had another one?
ANSWER: Never had another one.
QUESTION: Just went cold -- cold
ANSWER: Yeah, she asked me to.
QUESTION: And then what happened after
ANSWER: No.
QUESTION: Cold turkey means -- excuse
ANSWER: Yes.
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
So this is -- this is a current memory
QUESTION: That's what you did?
ANSWER: Yeah.
QUESTION: Didn't taper them down?
ANSWER: No.
QUESTION: And you never had one again?
ANSWER: Right.
QUESTION: And you mentioned in the
8 course of telling me this that you had a vivid
9 memory.
11 of yours?
14 me.
18 was in the 1980s?
24 that I read Mr. Shulman's transcript correctly
25 because obviously it was a little difficult for
ANSWER: I'm not certain.
Did I read that correctly, Counselor?
MR. HAMMER: Yes, sir.
(Video clip concluded.)
You might recall Mr. Hammer stipulated
ANSWER: It is, yeah.
QUESTION: Okay. Very clear -- excuse
QUESTION: Okay.
ANSWER: Very clear.
QUESTION: How certain are you that it
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
But what you heard was that Mr. Shulman
Second, you heard where he lived when he
1 Mr. Shulman, using a magnifying glass, for him to
2 follow along quite that rapidly.
4 has a clear, vivid memory of how he quit. Took
5 them out if his mouth, threw them in the trash
6 can, didn't need counseling, didn't need nicotine
7 replacement therapy, didn't have to do anything,
8 cold turkey.
10 did it. He lived in Winthrop. And as I'm about
11 to remind you the real estate records that we
12 have, as well as Mr. Shulman's testimony,
13 demonstrate unequivocally that Mr. Shulman last
14 lived in Winthrop in 1979 or the early 1980s,
15 perhaps, when he stayed in an apartment for a
16 couple months.
And, finally, you just heard Mr. Shulman

19 never smoked again, and he never relapsed after
20 that night.
22 evidence. It demonstrates -- because you might
23 remember also that you heard that, not only in his
24 deposition, which we also played for you -- we
25 won't do that again now -- Mr. Shulman was very
The real estate record will be in
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
As I said, the evidence is overwhelming
1 specific that he quit when they lived at One
2 Grovers Avenue in Winthrop, Massachusetts, which
3 the real estate records demonstrate that they sold
4 in 1979. So he quit in 1979 at the latest.
6 that Mr. Shulman quit in the mid 1970s. The
7 organic medical records that Mr. Schlesinger
8 embraces and does not reject anything in them
9 demonstrate that unequivocally.
11 Mr. Shulman's testimony that we just looked at as
12 to where his conversation with Yvonne took place,
13 his expert, his treater, the evidence all congeals
14 in one direction, that he quit in the mid 1970s.
16 where I'm at time-wise?

23 it.
MR. FURR: Well, thank you very much.
Okay. Why is it so important when he
THE COURT: You're about 52 minutes into
The sale of the real estate in 1979,
MR. FURR: Your Honor, may I inquire
THE COURT: You are --
MR. SCHLESINGER: An hour and 45
MR. FURR: I thought it was about 35
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
1 quit? Why did the plaintiffs fight so hard about
2 when he quit?
Why did we go through those mental
4 gymnastics about when he quit? Why did the
5 plaintiffs offer you evidence, maybe he quit in
6 the '70s. Well, maybe it was '80s. No, we think
7 it was the '90s. Why did we go through that
8 drill?
Because when you quit smoking, your risk
10 of developing a smoking-related disease begins to
11 drop, and here's the evidence that you heard from
12 qualified medical doctors in this case.
14 her later, the occupational medicine specialist
15 who devotes her career to helping people with
16 occupational diseases, including bladder cancer,
17 testified that your risk returns to baseline
18 approximately 20 years after cessation.
She explained to you what that means is
20 approximately 20 years, give or take, your risk is
21 back to the same as someone who never smoked, who
22 never -- with respect to developing bladder cancer
23 from cigarette smoking.
25 the way, the only pulmonologist you heard from, a
Dr. McGregor, and we'll talk more about
Dr. Farber, the pulmonologist who, by
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
I wrote 10 years here. That's a
1 gentleman in his mid 70s, long distinguished
2 career, has treated, he told you, thousands and
3 thousands of people with COPD, told you that
4 smokers do not develop COPD caused by smoking 20
5 years after they quit smoking. Never seen it.
6 Doesn't happen.
Dr. Dan, we'll stop there. Dr. Dan, the
8 cardiologist -- the only cardiologist that you saw
9 who has treated, again, thousands of cases of
10 cardiovascular disease, of CAD, told you that your
11 risk returns to baseline approximately 10 --
13 mistake. As I recall the testimony, it was 10 to
14 15 years. I want to be fair about that.
-- 10 to 15 years after cessation.
That's why when Mr. Shulman quit is the
17 defining issue in the case, because the evidence
18 demonstrates overwhelmingly that he quit at a time
19 where the declining risk from that disease, the
20 way his body would have healed itself over those
21 20 years, as he got farther and farther and
22 farther away from his exposure to cigarette smoke,
23 his risk dropped and dropped and dropped until it
24 was that of a never-smoker for developing those
25 diseases from cigarette smoking.
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
That's why plaintiffs can't prove any of
We'll start with bladder cancer. Both
There are other explanations as to why
2 these diseases, none of them. But there's a lot
3 more.
5 he might have developed these diseases for some of
6 them and for others, whether he ever even had the
7 disease.
So I'm not going to stop there. I'm
9 going to walk through with you what some of the
10 other medical issues are and the evidence that you
11 heard.
13 Dr. Soloway and Dr. Bernsley, taken together,
14 testified that there are other known risk factors
15 for bladder cancer, including smoking. Of course
16 smoking is one. Nobody is hiding that. But they
17 told you the chemical exposures, age, race, and
18 gender are all risk factors for developing bladder
19 cancer.
Then Dr. Proctor, we looked at this in
21 one context. Let's look at this in another. On
22 my cross-examination of Dr. Proctor where they
23 spent all this time talking about how lung cancer
24 incidence changes with the amount of cigarettes
25 bought and smoked, bladder cancer doesn't change.
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
Dr. Proctor went further. On
Dr. Proctor told you that it's driven by
1 Bladder cancer doesn't change.
It's a straight line. This blue line is
3 how many cigarettes are sold, and you see that as
4 the blue line goes up and up and up, the bladder
5 cancer rate stays the same. It's not driven by
6 smoking.
8 occupational exposures, occupational exposures.
10 cross-examination, he told you that there are
11 plants -- there have been studies where there are
12 plants where 19 out of 20 workers got bladder
13 cancer as a result of exposure to chemical
14 carcinogens in the workplace.
That's their expert, Dr. Proctor.
Now, again, continuing with the organic
17 medical records that were created in the process
18 of Mr. Shulman seeking medical treatment, which
19 Mr. Schlesinger embraces as accurate and does not
20 back off of any of them.
We have Dr. Benedetto, the oncologist's
22 record that addresses what types of occupational
23 exposures that Mr. Shulman might have had based on
24 the history that Mr. Shulman gave.
12-20-95, this was -- you might recall they told you they sought out
As above, he has extensive exposure to
1 the context. Mr. Shulman had had his surgery.
2 There was an issue as to whether or not he should
3 also have chemotherapy as a follow-up treatment of
4 his bladder cancer.
6 Dr. Benedetto, the University of Miami, because of
7 his knowledge and his expertise in this area, and
8 this is the history that Dr. Benedetto took from
9 Mr. Shulman.
11 cleaning compounds both as a janitor and a
12 mechanic.
14 for many years with exposure to a number of
15 solvents.
17 expert. This is what he does, and their witnesses
18 told you he was an expert. Dr. Soloway said:
19 He's a very well respected oncologist.
21 oncologist.
23 He took these histories because occupational
24 exposure is something meaningful that you have to
25 evaluate when you're treating somebody who has had
He was an engine mechanic and janitor
Dr. Benedetto is no hack. He's an
Dr. Bernsley said he is a superb
Then why did he take these histories?
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
1 bladder cancer because of course, if they've had
2 occupational exposures that are causing their
3 bladder cancer, the first thing you want to do is
4 get them to stop those occupational exposures,
5 remove them from the cause. That's why they take
6 these histories.
But we went further than that. We
8 brought you Dr. McGregor, Dr. McGregor, who
9 provided the Forensic Files moment of this trial,
10 the moment when you watch Forensic Files where
11 they use the science to tie together the physical
12 evidence.
14 that there are tests called audiograms where they
15 test somebody's ability to hear different
16 frequencies of sound.
18 explained to you that there are characteristic
19 profiles of audiograms that are rated to
20 particular types of exposures.
22 work done in the occupational context, there are
23 audiograms for the -- that demonstrate how
24 someone's hearing decreases if they've been
25 exposed to solvents.
Do you remember she explained to you
And they graph those out, and she
And because there's been so much of this
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
She then graphed Mr. Shulman's hearing
Mr. Shulman's audiogram demonstrated
And this is what she showed you. She
2 showed you -- on the right hand, you see -- not
3 related to Mr. Shulman. You see blue is normal
4 here. The orange is the pattern of hearing loss
5 that you get when you are exposed to certain types
6 of toxins and solvents.
8 loss against that pattern, and as you can see,
9 they parallel each other. The shape is the same.
11 that he had a hearing loss that matches the type
12 of hearing loss that you get from occ- -- from
13 exposure to solvents.
15 type of exposure. That exposure leads to this
16 loss of memory.
18 now, just so you know.
MR. FURR: Thank you very much.
Now I would have thought there would be
21 no confusion about this. No one is claiming that
22 hearing loss causes cancer.
And if anybody suggests to you that
24 Dr. McGregor stood up here and told you that
25 hearing loss causes cancer, you know that's not
It's almost like a fingerprint for that
THE COURT: Counsel, you're at an hour we asked Dr. Soloway and
1 true.
What she did was explain that exposure
3 to certain substances results in a characteristic
4 pattern of hearing loss, and that's one way -- you
5 can look somebody with hearing loss and project
6 backwards in time and project what it is they
7 might have been exposed to. That's what this tool
8 is used for.
10 Dr. Bernsley, the plaintiff's experts, whether or
11 not occupational exposures caused Mr. Shulman's
12 bladder cancer, because, remember, the plaintiffs
13 have the burden of proof here.
They have to prove "but for" causation,
15 that but for the smoking, the disease would never
16 have resulted.
18 treater whether occupational exposures played a
19 role in his bladder cancer and here's what they
20 told you.
22 facts to rule out the possibility that
23 Mr. Shulman's occupational exposures were a
24 substantial cause for his bladder cancer.
Dr. Soloway: I don't have enough of the
So we asked their expert and their
Dr. Bernsley told you he: Cannot rule
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
Even their own experts cannot exclude
And then a very interesting question was
1 out that occupational exposures were contributing
2 causes of Mr. Shulman's bladder cancer.
4 occupational exposures as the cause of
5 Mr. Shulman's bladder cancer.
7 asked of Dr. Soloway, and that's this, he was
8 asked: Now, sir, when you looked through
9 Mr. Shulman's records, you did not see any record
10 that one of Mr. Shulman's doctors said that
11 smoking caused Mr. Shulman's bladder cancer,
12 correct?
15 smoking caused his bladder cancer. Smoking wasn't
16 even part of the picture for Mr. Shulman in 1995.
He had stopped smoking 20 years earlier,
18 in 1975. So of course the doctors in 1995 aren't
19 going to say it's caused by smoking. He quit too
20 long ago. He quit too long ago, so none of these
21 treaters ever, never said that smoking was the
22 cause. It was too long in history, too far back.
Okay. There's another question on your
24 verdict form, Question 3 -- I don't think I'm
25 doing that next. Let me see.
ANSWER: Correct.
Of course no one concluded that his
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
We also asked the plaintiff's experts
Even the plaintiff's experts admit that
Okay. Yeah, I should do this first.
We also asked -- you know, I showed you
3 the declining risk statements from Dr. Soloway,
4 Dr. Dan -- excuse me, from Dr. Dan, Dr. Farber,
5 and Dr. McGregor about how your risk goes down
6 over time.
8 about that. And we had to cross-examine on them,
9 but here is what they admitted.
11 the risk of developing bladder cancer declines
12 when someone stops smoking and that the longer a
13 person goes without smoking, the lower their
14 chance of bladder cancer.
16 plaintiff's experts made.
There is another issue here, not only do
18 the plaintiffs have to prove to you that addiction
19 to nicotine in cigarettes caused his diseases, but
20 they have to prove to you that the products made
21 by each defendant were a legal cause of disease.
You'll see this product use causation
23 instruction in your instructions when you read
24 them that reads: The next issue you must
25 determine is whether cigarettes manufactured and
Those are the concessions that the so you're going to have to examine
1 sold by each defendant was a legal cause of injury
2 to the plaintiff.
4 the brand history and what you know to be the
5 brand history to determine whether or not the
6 cigarettes made by RJ Reynolds or Philip Morris or
7 Liggett were a legal cause.
9 the brand history was for the RJ Reynolds'
10 cigarettes. The other lawyers will talk about the
11 cigarettes manufactured by their company.
13 what you know. And I take all this from that
14 beautifully written sheet on the side where I
15 attempted to track Mr. Shulman's answers for you,
16 but you know that Mr. Shulman stopped smoking
17 cigarettes made by RJ Reynolds at least 35 years,
18 35 years before he developed bladder cancer.
20 evidence that after 20 years, the risk of
21 developing bladder cancer from smoking declines to
22 baseline. Forget 20 years. Forget 30 years. He
23 stopped smoking Reynolds' cigarettes in 1960.
25 he smoked from Reynolds were unfiltered
How do we know? The only products that
So I would just simply remind you what
But with respect to RJ Reynolds, here's
Now, remember, we just showed you the
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
1 cigarettes. He never smoked a Reynolds' filtered
2 cigarette. The evidence is absolutely clear on
3 that.
Mr. Shulman tells us that he switched to
5 filtered cigarettes in 1960. 1995 disease. 1960
6 quit Reynolds' products, 35 years later, 35 years
7 between the time that he smoked Reynolds' products
8 and the time that he developed bladder cancer.
And you also saw that Mr. Shulman, we
10 don't really know how much he smoked of Reynolds'
11 products even when he was smoking them because
12 obviously he said on multiple occasions that Lucky
13 Strike was a regular brand of his from the mid
14 1940s until 1960.
On cross-examination, he admitted he
16 really didn't know how much. And perhaps most
17 importantly, he admitted that even when he was
18 smoking Lucky Strike, that he would always buy
19 something cheaper if it was available.
Mr. Shulman had a remarkable business
21 career, but like most people, his career started
22 off slow. He worked hard. He made something of
23 himself. Changed his life as he went forward in
24 time.
But in the early years when he was
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
So when you get to this Question 3, I
1 starting out his career, he has kids in the house,
2 he would always buy whatever was cheapest. Always
3 buy whatever was cheapest. So we don't know even
4 those years how much he smoked Lucky Strike versus
5 another cheaper brand on sale.
7 submit to you that the evidence demonstrates
8 unequivocally that his smoking of RJ Reynolds'
9 cigarettes 35 years before his bladder cancer
10 could not have been a cause of his disease.
I'm going to go to the coronary -- the
12 evidence with respect to coronary artery disease.
13 And I'll start this way: Where was plaintiff's
14 cardiology expert?
They bring before you a claim for CAD,
16 for coronary artery disease, for which they are
17 asking you to award him millions of dollars in
18 combination with the other diseases, and they do
19 not bring to a cardiologist. Nobody. Instead
20 they have a urologist, Dr. Soloway, testify about
21 cardiology.
23 would find common ground on something. I too
24 encourage you to look at the last instruction in
25 your packet called the believability of witnesses
And I knew that Mr. Schlesinger and I
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
1 that tells you that you may reject expert
2 testimony.
And I put experts in quotes here because
4 I submit to you that if there's any testimony you
5 want to object, it's when someone testifies
6 outside their specialty. When a urologist comes
7 in here and tries to become a courtroom
8 cardiologist, that's a good time to reject that
9 testimony.
But we brought you the cardiologist,
11 Dr. Dan. You know that he treated thousands of
12 CAD patients during the course of his life and
13 that Mr. Shulman first presented with CAD in 2003,
14 2003.
Twenty-eight years after he had stopped
16 smoking in 1975 was when Mr. Shulman underwent, I
17 believe it was the quadruple bypass surgery that
18 he had, 28 years later.
So we explored with Dr. Dan, what are
20 the causes of coronary artery disease, and how
21 does it affect your risk of developing coronary
22 artery disease from smoking when you stop smoking?
24 explained to you that Mr. Shulman had multiple
25 significant risk factors for coronary artery
And here was the testimony: He
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
You know, as Mr. Schlesinger explained
He's lived a long life, outlived his
1 disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high
2 cholesterol, age, gender.
4 to you, Mr. Shulman does have the gift of
5 longevity.
7 expectation, outlived all his peers, but along the
8 way, as many, many people do, we all know as
9 people get older, they acquire one after another
10 medical problem.
And that's what happened to Mr. Shulman
12 during the years as he was going through his 70s
13 and early 80s and approaching that age of 83, he
14 was accumulating multiple medical problems that
15 are known to be causes of coronary artery disease,
16 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol.
2003, quadruple bypass, how does that
18 relate to quitting smoking in 1975? Dr. Dan
19 explained to you that his -- Mr. Shulman's risk of
20 developing CAD from smoking started decreasing as
21 soon as he quit and it fell to baseline. Here I
22 got it right fortunately, fell to baseline within
23 10 to 15 years after he quit smoking.
25 1990 at the latest, 15 years after 1975,
Put it altogether. That means that by
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
COPD. COPD, another instance in which I
1 Mr. Shulman's risk of developing coronary artery
2 disease from his cigarette smoking would have
3 returned to baseline.
5 submit you should read that believability of
6 witness instruction and consider whether or not to
7 reject the only expert testimony plaintiff's
8 brought to you on COPD.
Who brought you their COPD testimony, a
10 pulmonologist? No, they didn't bring one. They
11 didn't bring a pulmonologist. Instead,
12 Dr. Soloway, the urologist, also provided their
13 only testimony on COPD.
15 the very, very important opinion that you got from
16 Dr. Dan was that Mr. Shulman would have developed
17 coronary artery disease even if he had never
18 smoked.
20 cardiologist that you have before you in this
21 case.
23 again, in quotes, that plaintiffs brought, and,
24 look, obviously he spent a lot of time in urology.
Mr. -- Dr. Soloway testified at length
I should back up because the final --
That's the only opinion from a
Dr. Soloway, the only expert that, I submit this is another opportunity
1 about what he's done in urology, but, but how did
2 he prepare to testify about pulmonology in this
3 case, about COPD?
He told us he Googled it. He Googled it
5 and studied it. You know, Google is a good source
6 for lots of information. I mean, most of us use
7 it for a variety of sources, but that's not how
8 you become an expert and come in and offer
9 testimony in a courtroom.
11 that you might want to consider rejecting that
12 testimony.
14 did bring -- we brought to you Dr. Farber, a
15 gentleman in his 70s, a long distinguished career,
16 treated tens of thousands of COPD patients, and
17 here's what Dr. Farber told you.
He told you that Mr. Shulman had never
19 been treated for COPD, never. Imagine that. The
20 claim is that Mr. Shulman developed COPD in 1995.
And here we are in 2015, and Mr. Shulman
22 has never been treated for COPD? Dr. Farber
23 explained to you that Mr. Shulman has no symptoms
24 of COPD.
We did bring to you a pulmonologist. We
Dr. Farber explained to you that the that you heard from the deposition
Plaintiff's claim in this case about
1 doctors who treated Mr. Shulman never worked him
2 up, never worked him up for COPD.
4 testimony that Mr. Shulman didn't even know or
5 think that he had COPD.
Look at the medical records. I'll go
7 through these very quickly. Dr. Farber reviewed
8 with you because -- let me back up.
10 COPD is based upon two, two medical records from
11 1995 stemming from an oncology report, neither of
12 which was the result of a COPD workup or pulmonary
13 function testing.
15 ice that they base their whole case on about COPD.
Look at what happened subsequent to the
17 creation of those records. When Mr. Shulman was
18 having his -- getting ready to have his bladder
19 cancer surgery in the anesthesia questionnaire, he
20 checked off that he had no problems breathing. He
21 continued to do that.
23 he never had shortness of breath, that he had no
24 treatment for COPD, that he sometimes -- in some
25 of those forms, they'd be written out, and he
You'll see throughout these records that
That's the narrow, thin read, the thin
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
So what did Dr. Farber explain to you?
You have them breathe into that
1 would be asked: Do you have shortness of breath?
2 Do you have emphysema? He checked "no" every
3 time. Denies emphysema. Denies COPD.
All those records are in there. The
5 point being that in the decades following those
6 two offhand recordations of COPD in the medical
7 records, you never see it again. You never see it
8 again.
10 You don't have to guess as to whether or not
11 somebody has COPD. All you have to do is
12 administer a pulmonary function test.
14 apparatus, take the biggest breath they can,
15 breathe it out as fast as they can. The doctors
16 measure all that and they compare it to standards.
And they can determine whether or not
18 you have obstructive lung disease that rises to
19 the level of being COPD based upon how you
20 compared to others of the same gender and age.
22 Dr. Farber told us. Mr. Shulman's single
23 pulmonary function test that we have, the results
24 from that test were normal, normal for men of
25 Mr. Shulman's age.
That's how you diagnose it. Here's what Dr. Farber told you that based upon
It might stop getting worse, but it
2 having treated thousands of patients and
3 interpreted thousands and thousands of PFTs, that
4 Mr. Shulman did not have COPD now, And that means
5 he could never have had COPD because when you get
6 COPD, it doesn't go away.
The decrease in lung function remains
8 with you for the rest of your life. It's not a
9 disease that can be cured. It doesn't go away.
10 If you have it, it stays with you for the rest of
11 your life.
13 doesn't go away. And so if he did have it in 2015
14 when he did that PFT, he could never have had it.
So I'm going to suggest to you that when
16 you go to your -- oh, another important point.
17 Another important point.
19 notwithstanding those results in the 2015 PFT,
20 which plaintiffs cross-examined him on at length,
21 at length, about whether or not those are
22 consistent with COPD or not, Dr. Farber explained
23 to you that the internist, the doctor who was
24 taking care of Mr. Shulman day-to-day, the man
25 charged with laying his hands on him, listening to
Dr. Farber also explained to you that --
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
It never happened. The COPD diagnosis
1 his heart, listening to his lungs and interpreting
2 the results, has never diagnosed Mr. Shulman with
3 COPD and has never treated Mr. Shulman for COPD
4 even after that PFT test.
6 was -- is one that doesn't exist outside this
7 courtroom. It just doesn't exist.
So the plaintiff has failed to prove to
9 you that Mr. Shulman had any of the diseases that
10 he claims to have had caused by his addiction to
11 nicotine in cigarettes.
13 question, Question 1, for each of those diseases,
14 right there, you put a "no" because he did not
15 prove it was caused by smoking.
17 your verdict form that in between the questions,
18 there are instructions.
20 sometimes. We do the best we can with them, but
21 those instructions tell you that if you say "no"
22 to all the subparts of Question 1, you sign your
23 verdict form, and that's the end of this trial.
25 address as part of the class membership is not
The second -- the second issue I want to
When you get to your verdict form
And when you put a "no" -- you'll see on
They're not that easy to follow
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
If I get click happy, I'll get lost and
1 medical. We just addressed medical causation, but
2 you might remember that --
Alecia, is there any way that you can
4 bring up that first hurdle, the first chart with
5 the four hurdles, and let me have that back for
6 just a moment, and then we'll go back to this.
8 we'll never find it.
10 introduce this issue of class membership. What I
11 neglected to tell you here was that the plaintiffs
12 have to prove each of these things to you.
13 Proving one of them is not enough. Two of them is
14 not enough. Three is not enough.
16 these things with you, then your answer has to be
17 a no, and the case is over.
We just got done addressing the medical
19 causation, the very first issue. Mr. Brenner is
20 going to address Florida residency.
I'm now going to talk with you, and I'll
22 do this at the same time to get this done a little
23 faster.
25 plaintiffs have proven to you that even if
I'm going to talk to you about whether
Okay. Here was the diagram I used to
If they fail on proving anything of
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
Okay. Alecia, I will probably -- thank
All right. So the next two hurdles are
So I'm going to suggest to you that one
1 cigarettes were a medical cause of his disease,
2 have they proven to you that addiction to nicotine
3 was a legal cause of his disease, so we'll look at
4 that evidence.
6 you.
8 addiction and addiction/causation. Kind of odd
9 concepts, addiction/causation. Probably not
10 something that you thought about very much before
11 this trial.
13 of the ways to think about this question is
14 whether plaintiffs have proven to you that
15 Mr. Shulman was an involuntary smoker that was
16 unable to quit smoking, an involuntary smoker who
17 was able to quit smoking.
19 addiction caused the disease.
Let's look at what the evidence says.
21 We'll back up a little bit. And, again, I told
22 you we did not bring Dr. Hoge because we didn't
23 need to because we got out of their witnesses all
24 of the evidence that you needed to make your
25 decision on cross-examination.
Okay. If they prove that to you, maybe
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
Between Dr. Seidman and
2 Dr. Henningfield, here is what you now know
3 through the cross-examination of these two
4 individuals. We know that the DSM-5 is the
5 official diagnostic approach of the American
6 Psychiatric Association for diagnosing addiction.
You further know that the DSM-5 explains
8 that 50 percent of daily smokers are not addicted.
9 So if someone is a daily smoker, it's literally
10 the toss of a coin as to whether they are addicted
11 or not.
Dr. Seidman told you that's not enough.
13 You can't make a decision on whether someone is an
14 addicted smoker based on whether they smoke daily.
15 It's a toss of a coin. You just can't do it.
Dr. Seidman also explained to you that
17 smokers smoke for reasons other than addiction,
18 for reasons other than addiction.
20 you several times that, would he ever have smoked
21 that much if he weren't addicted? Well, let's
22 look at what Dr. Seidman says about that issue
23 when he is outside the courtroom and writing books
24 for other doctors to read for them to help their
25 patients quit smoking.
I mean, the argument has been made to
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
Dr. Seidman told you, quote: It is used
2 as a tension reducer in anxiety-provoking
3 situations. It is also pleasurable for many
4 people, and this pleasure is reinforced when
5 smoking accompanies activities such as a meal,
6 coffee, or sex.
That's what Dr. Seidman tells you
8 outside the courtroom. You can use your own
9 recollection and compare that with the testimony
10 he gave here in the courtroom.
Now something very interesting happened
12 during this trial with respect to addiction, and
13 that is plaintiffs have spent a lot of time
14 looking at old documents, eliciting testimony from
15 their witnesses within the courtroom, trying to
16 prove to you that smoking is not a choice, that
17 smoking is not a choice.
19 Cigarettes don't light themselves and jump in your
20 mouth. Nobody holds a gun to a smoker's head and
21 forces them to smoke. It's a personal choice that
22 people make, and outside the courtroom,
23 Dr. Seidman agrees.
25 cross-examination of an Internet online site that
Of course smoking is a choice.
We played a video during his
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
(Video clip played as follows:)
MR. SEIDMAN: Urges and cravings to
1 he has put up to help smokers quit. And as you
2 listen to this very brief clip -- I'd ask you to
3 listen carefully -- you will hear Dr. Seidman use
4 the word "choice" three times in about less than
5 one minute to describe what cigarette smoking is
6 all about.
9 smoke are not choices. However, the action you
10 take in response to the urges and cravings is a
11 choice.
The cigarette has no magical power
13 except which you give it. When not acted on,
14 urges to smoke, no matter how powerful, occur less
15 often and become easier to ignore.
By not acting on the urge to smoke, you
17 choose voluntarily to protect your body and your
18 health. You choose not to act on the urge to
19 smoke because you truly believe this will make
20 life better.
23 uses the word "choice."
25 a choice. You can choose not to smoke. You can
(Video clip concluded.)
Three times in 45 seconds, Dr. Seidman
How you respond to urges and cravings is
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
Okay. Let's look at what else
1 choose to protect your health, or you can choose
2 to gain the benefit of whatever it is you get out
3 of smoking. That's a choice that people make.
And yet inside the courtroom, plaintiffs
5 do everything they can to disassociate themselves
6 with the concept that there's choice involved in
7 smoking.
9 Dr. Seidman said, because he spent a lot of time
10 telling you what a hard core group of patients he
11 has, patients that have failed elsewhere, who
12 can't quit, who have all kinds of severely
13 addicted problems with smoking.
15 says: Oh, yeah, at least 60 percent of my
16 patients quit, 60 percent of my patients quit.
18 smokers that they can't quit? Do you ever tell
19 smokers they can't quit?
And here's what they -- here's what he
21 said: It's their decision. It's their decision.
22 Sometimes they might decide to smoke or not.
23 Sometimes they might decide to smoke or not.
25 courtroom. It's their decision. It's a choice
That's what Dr. Seidman says outside the
And then I cross-examined him, and he
And I asked him: Do you ever tell
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
1 that people make. And you saw on the video, the
2 cigarette does not have any magical power over you
3 other than what you choose to give it, as
4 Dr. Seidman just explained.
Let's focus back on Mr. Shulman and ask
6 yourself: Was Mr. Shulman some type of gullible,
7 impressionable, weak-minded individual that was
8 unable to make decisions for himself, unable to
9 interpret information, unable to control his
10 impulses? Was he -- have some kind of an
11 addiction personality? Was he any of those
12 things?
Here's what you know about Mr. Shulman:
14 He was brilliant. One word, brilliant. He taught
15 himself how to fly airplanes at the age of 14.
17 He taught himself how to build radios and TVs. He
18 told us that amusing anecdote of how everybody in
19 the neighborhood thought it was so funny to hear a
20 young Jewish child reciting mass in Latin.
He taught himself how to speak French
22 and Italian. He built businesses with thousands
23 of employees, and most saliently, for our
24 purposes, he quit smoking by taking the cigarette
25 out of his mouth, throwing it on the ground, and
He taught himself how to break horses.
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
Harvey told us: We used to go up and
Mr. Shulman lived a big life. He made
1 looking at Yvonne and saying: I'll never smoke
2 again. He was a very capable man.
But Dr. -- Mr. Shulman made his choices.
4 He chose how to live. Here's what Harvey told us
5 about what type of man Mr. Shulman was.
That's a picture of Harvey and
7 Mr. Shulman beside the plane.
9 turn it upside-down and laugh, get it totally out
10 of control, and we used to laugh, and he would fly
11 and practice landings in it.
13 his choices. He chose to fly. He chose to do
14 aero stunts. He chose to ride his motorcycle and
15 drive his boats and go skiing and everything else
16 he wanted to do.
18 the benefits of doing those things, and he made
19 his own choices, and he did the same thing about
20 cigarettes.
There was nothing special about the way
22 Mr. Shulman quit, no counseling, no medication, no
23 treatment of any kind. He just decided: I'm
24 committed to quitting, looked Yvonne in the eye,
25 gave her the commitment, and that's what he did,
He weighed those choices and then risked
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
As Dr. Proctor explained to you, by
1 and he could have done it at any time.
And what we know is that while he was
3 continuing to smoke, millions and millions and
4 millions of Americans made the other decision, and
5 that was to quit.
7 1965, one year after the Surgeon General -- excuse
8 me, after the Surgeon General's report came out,
9 17 million Americans that smoked had quit.
Now here's an interesting statistic.
11 You've heard over and over -- you've been shown
12 that FTC report over and over from 1966 that says
13 that warnings aren't effective.
Of course, only two years -- it was only
15 right after the warnings going into effect, didn't
16 have time to measure the warning yet, but look at
17 what happened between 1966 and 1970. In the
18 four-year span after the warnings went in effect,
19 13 million people quit.
21 heaviest rate of quitting before or since in the
22 United States ever.
24 FTC report, that the warnings weren't effective
25 when millions of smokers were running for the door
And yet you're being told, based on some
Dr. Proctor told you this was the
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
You know that Mr. Shulman was not an
1 in fear of their lives, as Dr. Proctor explained
2 to you.
So to sum up this class membership issue,
4 you know that the plaintiff failed to prove to you
5 that Mr. Shulman even had a disease caused by
6 smoking.
8 involuntary addicted smoker. He quit. He quit 40
9 years ago, the first time he went 24 hours without
10 a cigarette and he never relapsed.
And you've been told -- the evidence has
12 demonstrated absolutely clearly that Mr. Shulman,
13 like everything else in his life, Mr. Shulman was
14 a master of his life. There's no doubt about
15 that.
Mr. Shulman smoked when he wanted to
17 smoke, and Mr. Shulman quit when he wanted to
18 quit, and the plaintiffs have not been able to
19 prove to you that Mr. Shulman has a disease that
20 was caused by his addiction to smoking.
And so when you go to your verdict form,
22 I suggest that, although one X is enough, one X is
23 enough, one X, you go home, for each disease.
25 should be three X's on each disease line on the
All the evidence in the case that there
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
No medical causation, no addiction, no
I'm going to go to Questions 4 and 5 on
1 verdict form, not literally. When you put one
2 down, that's all you have to do when you fill it
3 out, but for three different reasons there should
4 be an X on that verdict form, for bladder cancer,
5 CAD, and COPD.
7 addiction/causation, and later Mr. Brenner is
8 going to talk with you about whether or not
9 plaintiffs have even fulfilled their residency
10 requirement, but I'll leave that to him.
12 your verdict form, the concealment question,
13 whether Mr. Shulman developed a smoking-related
14 disease because the dangers and addictive
15 properties of smoking were concealed from him.
17 on fraud and concealment in your instructions:
18 The issue for your determination on plaintiff's
19 fraudulent concealment claim is as to each
20 defendant, whether plaintiff reasonably relied to
21 his detriment on any statement made by each
22 defendant that intentionally omitted material
23 information concerning the health effects or
24 addictive nature of smoking cigarettes, and if so,
25 whether such reliance was a legal cause of injury
Here's the instruction that you will see
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
Plaintiffs have taken on the burden of
The trouble is, and I alluded to this
And you'll have a subsequent instruction
1 to Mr. Shulman.
3 that defines for you material information. It
4 says: Material information is information that is
5 of such importance that the plaintiff would not
6 have acted as he did but for the concealment or
7 omission of information.
9 trying to prove to you that the concealment or
10 agreement to conceal of material information has
11 been linked to Mr. Shulman's Engle qualifying
12 disease.
14 early on, you cannot injure somebody by concealing
15 information from them that they already know.
If they already know it, you can't
17 conceal it from them.
19 specifically. This is a very interesting part of
20 the case.
22 Mr. Shulman developed bladder cancer because the
23 defendants had information about bladder cancer
24 that they concealed from Mr. Shulman.
So I asked Dr. Proctor about it: Did it
Let's talk about bladder cancer
The plaintiffs are claiming that
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
(Video clip played as follows:)
Q. With respect to bladder cancer and
A. That's correct, yeah.
(Video clip ended.)
The companies didn't have any
1 happen? Did the defendants conceal information
2 about bladder cancer?
5 smoking evolving to bladder cancer, none of these
6 tobacco companies had any information that the
7 public health community didn't already have,
8 correct?

MR. FURR: Welcome back, ladies and
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
The plaintiffs have claimed that
2 Mr. Shulman developed bladder cancer because
3 information about the dangers of smoking were
4 concealed from him, but as Dr. Proctor just told
5 you, the -- the tobacco companies didn't have any
6 information about bladder cancer that wasn't
7 already possessed by the public health.
And you saw Dr. Proctor up here seven
9 days, seven days of generic testimony, and not
10 only did he not talk about Mr. Shulman, he didn't
11 talk about bladder cancer.
Seven days of generic testimony, and
13 Dr. Proctor did not discuss one tobacco company
14 document that mentions bladder cancer. He did not
15 show you a single statement about bladder cancer
16 by a tobacco company spokesperson.
18 anybody denying that smoking causes bladder
19 cancer, and as a result, on the evidentiary record
20 that you have before you, there is zero evidence
21 that Mr. Shulman relied on tobacco company
22 statements about bladder cancer. It's just not
23 there.
25 the evidence put on for you.
He didn't show you a single statement by
Inexplicably, it simply wasn't part of
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
More broadly, I want to look at this
2 issue a little more closely about whether
3 Mr. Shulman developed any smoking-related disease
4 because the dangers and addictive properties of
5 smoking weren't known to him.
I'm not going to review what we've
7 already looked at, but I will remind you what
8 Dr. Proctor's testimony was about how prevalent
9 and powerful and impactful the evidence was in the
10 mid 1950s.
Dr. Proctor told you that the health
12 news scared millions of people into quitting in
13 the early 1950s, that they were fleeing from
14 cigarettes, fearing for their lives, fearing for
15 their lives. People started fearing for their
16 lives. Scared millions of people.
18 smoking, started cutting down, quitting, and he
19 told me on cross-examination that quitting was
20 driven by people's fears and concerns about the
21 dangers of smoking.
23 that Mr. Shulman got the message.
25 specifically. You have an instruction in your
I want to talk to you about the warnings
The message was out there, and you know
Millions of people quit, started you heard that Congress determined
1 package about the warning labels that appeared on
2 packages of cigarettes.
And you will see in that instruction
4 that, notwithstanding all the sideways attacks
5 that have been made on what the warning labels
6 said after 1969, you will see that, as a matter of
7 law, the defendants had no obligation to place any
8 additional warnings in their packages and
9 advertisements. That's federal law. Those
10 warnings were sufficient as a matter of law and
11 cannot be challenged.
13 the size, the location, the language of the
14 warning. You were shown the warnings that
15 Mr. Shulman would have been exposed to when he was
16 smoking: Caution: Cigarette smoking may be
17 hazardous to your health, and: Warning, the
18 Surgeon General has determined that cigarette
19 smoking is dangerous to your health.
21 every package of cigarettes that Mr. Shulman would
22 have picked up after 1966 had one of these
23 warnings. Every advertisement that he was seeing
24 after 1971 had one of these warnings.
And as Dr. Proctor freely conceded,
And Mr. Shulman told us that he saw
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
(Video clip played as follows:)
A. Please try to understand me, okay, I was
A. I don't remember when, but they were on
Q. Okay. And what did you do when you
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And do you remember your sons
1 those warnings, and this is how he felt about
2 them.
Q. Did there come a point in time when you
5 learned about the warnings, that -- that caution
6 warning coming on the cigarette packs?
9 even pointing that out to you?
11 me constantly about it.
13 started hearing about caution -- you remember the
14 caution label said: Caution: It may be hazardous
15 to your health. What did you think when you heard
16 that?
18 at a point in my life where I thought nothing
19 could hurt me, nothing. There wasn't anything
20 damaging, so I defied the warning and so forth,
21 and I think that -- that's what happened.
24 Mr. Hammer. You could probably tell by listening
25 to the voice who asked that question.
(Video clip concluded.)
That was testimony elicited by with respect to the warnings,
He's not being criticized for that
In other words, he decided to smoke
2 Mr. Shulman did say he didn't see them. He didn't
3 say he didn't understand them. He didn't say he
4 didn't believe them.
He said at that stage in his life, as a
6 46-year-old healthy man, he simply didn't believe
7 that anything could hurt him. Nothing could hurt
8 him, so he took his chances and continued smoking.
9 And as he said it, as he was trying to explain, he
10 said: I defied the law.
12 notwithstanding the warning that he was given. He
13 had every right to make that choice.
15 choice, but if that choice and the consequences of
16 that choice are his responsibility, because
17 responsibility for your choices is what comes with
18 freedom of choice in this country.
I showed this to you once before. It
20 was back when we didn't have too good of sound
21 quality going on before lunch, so I'm going to
22 show you one clip again.
24 you think about Questions 4 and 5 on your verdict
25 form, about whether Mr. Shulman was hurt and
And, again, I submit to you that when
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
(Video clip played.)
A. Yes, that's true.
Here is what the evidence was.
(Video clip concluded.)
MR. FURR: That's true, and he said
1 developed disease because he didn't know that
2 smoking was dangerous or addictive, you don't have
3 to look any farther than this single question and
4 answer that Mr. Shulman gave us.
Q. So from the 1940s on, while you smoked,
7 all the people around you, your family members,
8 were warning you that you should quit smoking
9 because it was bad for your health, weren't they?
13 that's true from the 1940s on.
15 evidence with respect to Mr. Shulman relying on
16 statements made by tobacco companies or by
17 organizations that represented tobacco companies?
19 Mr. Shulman never heard or relied upon The Frank
20 Statement or a CTR statement or a TIRC statement
21 or a Tobacco Institute statement or TI, Tobacco
22 Institute, press release or tobacco industry White
23 Papers or tobacco industry interviews or
24 statements or tobacco company statements about
25 smoking and health or tobacco company statements
On the other hand, what was plaintiff's
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
That's the list of all the conduct that
1 about smoking and addiction.
3 Dr. Proctor spent seven days talking with you
4 about as part -- as the activities of the tobacco
5 companies.
But they never linked it. They never
7 connected it to Mr. Shulman's injury. They had
8 the conduct. They had Mr. Shulman's injury. They
9 never provided you the chain-links in between to
10 link up that conduct with Mr. Shulman's injuries.
11 It's just not in the record before you.
The record before you is very clear that
13 Mr. Shulman knew that smoking was dangerous in the
14 '30s. Think about that. I mean, we're talking
15 about 75 years ago. 75 years ago, Mr. Shulman
16 knew that smoking -- 85 -- I'm sorry. I got the
17 math wrong.
85 years ago, he knew that -- addicted
19 in the '30s. He warned his sons that smoking was
20 dangerous and addictive.
And all these times that his son or his
22 wife would confront him with information about the
23 dangers and addictive properties of cigarettes, he
24 never disputed any of that. He never disputed any
25 of that.
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
You simply cannot injure someone by
They did not provide to you the evidence
That's your concealment question.
Okay. The next question is whether
2 concealing information from them that they already
3 know and believe.
5 to link up the Engle findings with an Engle
6 qualifying disease, and, therefore, when you go to
7 the verdict form, the answer to Question 4 -- this
8 should be for all the companies -- there should be
9 a "no" for each of the companies on Question 4.
12 Mr. Shulman was injured by an agreement to
13 conceal, an agreement to conceal.
15 he wasn't injured by concealment, then some
16 abstract agreement to conceal could not have been
17 the cause of his injury.
If the concealment did not injure him,
19 the agreement to conceal could not have injured
20 him. That's the first point.
22 case that plaintiffs attempted to put before you,
23 because during his -- during his closing,
24 Mr. Schlesinger said that there was an Engle
25 finding about an agreement to conceal information
And it's probably pretty obvious, but if
But let's look a little closer at the
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
Moreover, the Court's instructions
Please, when you get back to the jury
1 related to the marketing of filtered cigarettes,
2 the marketing of filtered cigarettes.
4 room, look at your instructions. Look at the
5 Engle findings. I promise you there is no Engle
6 finding about the marketing of filtered
7 cigarettes. It's simply not there.
9 define the findings. The Court tells you what the
10 findings are.
The lawyers continue can't tell you what
12 the findings were. We -- we can't read the minds
13 of the Engle jurors. The finding -- the findings
14 mean only what they say and say what they mean.
15 That's the law.
17 with respect to filtered cigarettes.
19 that the tobacco companies never said that
20 filtered cigarettes were safe or safer, never said
21 it.
You can look at all those ads that you
23 have in evidence. You will not find a filtered
24 cigarette advertisements saying that filtered
25 cigarettes are safe or any safer.
Now but there's more about this issue
First is Dr. Proctor freely admitted
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
Notwithstanding that we're all sitting
Moreover, the filtered cigarettes and the
2 ads after 1971 always carried exactly the same
3 health warnings as all other cigarettes, as all
4 other cigarettes.
Now with respect to this agreement to
6 conceal, here's what the evidence was again from
7 Dr. Proctor.
9 here this table together in this lawsuit, RJ
10 Reynolds, Philip Morris, and Liggett are
11 competitors, there's nothing they like better than
12 taking customers from each other. They're
13 business competitors.
15 told you that Reynolds, Philip Morris, and Liggett
16 never conspired to market filtered cigarettes,
17 never conspired to market filtered cigarettes
18 because that was a competitive activity. They
19 weren't working together on their marketing plans.
21 customers with their marketing plans. No
22 conspiracy.
24 respect to whether RJ Reynolds made fraudulent
25 statements about filtered cigarettes in his
Most importantly, though, Dr. Proctor
They were trying to take each other's
And finally, Dr. Proctor admitted with
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
And, finally, with respect to RJ
He stopped smoking Lucky Strikes in
1 advertisements, he admitted in cross-examination
2 that he had seen internal documents in RJ Reynolds
3 indicating that the scientists at Reynolds
4 believed that filtered cigarettes were better for
5 health.
7 Reynolds, whom I represent, again, Mr. Shulman
8 never smoked a filtered cigarette made by RJ
9 Reynolds.
11 1960 -- before 1960, he told us, when he switched
12 to filtered cigarettes.
14 ladies and gentlemen, that the only possible
15 answer for RJ Reynolds on Question 5 has to be a
16 no. It just simply has to be a no.
Now I am obligated to discuss some other
18 issues with you that I don't think you should ever
19 reach.
21 defense on class membership, but if you reach
22 these issues, I'm obligated to discuss with you
23 that if you ever get here, some thoughts about how
24 you might consider the issues of how to allocate
25 fault and damages. So I'm briefly going to
So when you go to Question 5, I submit,
There should be a verdict for the
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
The first thing to understand, you will
1 address those.
3 see this in the instructions, is that the
4 assignment of fault relates only to actions that
5 were a legal cause of Mr. Shulman's diseases.
No matter what you might think about
7 some of the actions of the tobacco companies and
8 how wrong headed and bad you may think those
9 actions were, if those actions have not been
10 linked up to Mr. Shulman's disease, they cannot be
11 considered by you as a matter of law when you
12 determine what amount of fault to assign to the
13 companies.
Same principle stated another way, the
15 defendants cannot be assigned fault for actions
16 that were not a legal cause of Mr. Shulman's
17 disease.
19 this instruction earlier, the Engle findings
20 themselves do not establish, do not establish that
21 the defendants are at fault for Mr. Shulman's
22 disease.
24 proof. The Engle findings don't do that job for
25 them.
That's what they had to do here with the
And finally, you will see, we looked at
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
For example, this morning
How did he prove that? He just pulled
Next, there is no presumption that the
2 defendants were at fault. The defendants' fault
3 starts at zero. The plaintiff has the burden to
4 prove to you each percentage point of fault, each
5 percentage point of fault.
7 Mr. Schlesinger suggested to you that RJ Reynolds
8 was 35 percent at fault.
10 that number out of the air. They've have to prove
11 to you one percent, two percent, three percent.
12 They have to prove that to you.
14 this, my time is short. You know if there's one
15 fact in this case, you know that Mr. Shulman knew
16 smoking was addictive and knew smoking was
17 dangerous and he knew it very early going all the
18 way back to the 1930s.
20 comparative fault question, this is the way it
21 should be looked at: The only legal cause of any
22 smoking-related disease that Mr. Shulman got, if
23 you think he got one, was his choice to smoke in
24 the face of consistent, repeated warnings --
And we've talked already, I won't review
So I suggest that when you get to this
MR. SCHLESINGER: Objection, Judge. I
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
THE COURT: Uh-huh.
(The following discussion was held
1 apologize. May I approach?
4 sidebar:)
MR. SCHLESINGER: I'm sorry, Judge, but
6 that's -- that's inserting, it's conflating class
7 membership and comparative -- and comparative
8 fault, which is exactly what you said not to do.
It violates the instructions. It's not
10 closing argument. It's conflating fault and class
11 membership.
13 he said.
15 objection.
18 court:)
MR. FURR: May I proceed, Your Honor?
THE COURT: Yes.
MR. FURR: As I was saying, if you find
22 that Mr. Shulman had a smoking-related disease and
23 if you get to this question, the only legal cause
24 of any smoking-related disease was his choice to
25 smoke in the face of consistent, repeated warnings
THE COURT: Um, overruled.
(The sidebar discussion was concluded
If you read it, you'll see. Read what
MR. FURR: I don't even understand the
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
Said differently, if he had a
Let's talk about damages. The most
1 that started in the 1930s and continued throughout
2 his marriage to Mrs. Shulman.
4 smoking-related disease, only Mr. Shulman could
5 have made the choice to stop smoking, as
6 Dr. Seidman told you during his testimony. Only
7 the smoker can make the choice to stop. No one
8 can make it for him.
10 important principle in damages in your instruction
11 is this: Any damages must be fair and just in
12 light of the evidence, fair and just in light of
13 the evidence.
15 to you each and every dollar of damage, each and
16 every dollar of damage.
18 about the evidence before you with respect to even
19 if you believe, if you determine that bladder
20 cancer, COPD, and CAD that Mr. Shulman had were
21 all caused by smoking, even if you find that, I
22 want to talk with you with what the evidence is
23 about how that affected Mr. Shulman.
And I'm not disparaging Mr. Shulman in
25 any way or trying to minimize the impact of those
Again, plaintiff has the burden to prove
I want to talk with you a little bit
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
The first fact, with respect to bladder
COPD, Dr. Farber, Mr. Shulman has never
1 diseases on him. I'm simply going to review the
2 facts before you to remind you of what the facts
3 are.
5 cancer from Dr. Soloway and Dr. Bernsley,
6 Mr. Shulman's cancer was cured in 1995, 20 years
7 ago. He's never had a recurrence.
Effectively one can say he is cured and
9 Dr. Bernsley said: I am impressed with how well
10 he is doing.
12 been treated for COPD. Mr. Shulman has never
13 taken any medications for COPD. Mr. Shulman had
14 no symptoms of COPD.
And during -- during this trial, not at
16 the beginning of trial, but during the trial, you
17 saw Mr. Shulman begin appearing in the courtroom
18 with an oxygen tank.
20 that, but what you did not get, what the
21 plaintiffs did not bring to you was any
22 explanation as to why he has that oxygen tank.
They had the opportunity to put on an
24 expert witness, or even Mr. Shulman, to explain
25 when he acquired that oxygen, how he acquired that
And I'm not being critical of him for I'm not criticizing him for having
1 oxygen, why he was using it, what symptoms it was
2 being used to treat, whether it was related to any
3 smoking-related disease. They didn't put that in
4 front of you.
6 that tank, not in any way, but the presence of
7 that tank means nothing for your deliberations
8 because you were not given any information about
9 any of those issues related to that tank.
Let's look at CAD. Here's what Dr. Dan
11 told you about his CAD. Mr. Shulman never had any
12 symptoms of coronary artery disease before 2003.
13 He had successful bypass surgery in 2003, and he
14 has not had a heart attack or restenosis or
15 surgical intervention since 2003.
17 revealing facts in this case with respect to how
18 his disease has affected Mr. Shulman was this
19 medical record from Dr. Bernsley that's in
20 evidence.
22 his medical problems -- he's going to see a
23 urologist.
The doctor asked him: Tell me how bad
25 your problems are on a scale of one to ten with
On November 1st, 2002, Mr. Shulman rated
And perhaps maybe one of the most
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
I don't have time to go through them
1 ten being the most severe, circle the number that
2 best describes the problem.
Mr. Shulman circled one. Just the
4 facts. That's how he described his medical
5 problems to his doctor outside of litigation.
But you saw a lot of medical records
7 that we cross-examined Dr. Bernsley and
8 Dr. Soloway on.
10 all, but from 1995 to 2014, what you consistently
11 see is Mr. Shulman is doing well, he appears well,
12 he's healing well, he's extremely well overall,
13 he's doing very well for his age of 91, he's doing
14 extremely well.
16 one thing we can all agree on is Mr. Shulman is
17 extraordinary for a 94-year-old man and a
18 94-year-old man who is going to turn 95 next week.
19 He's done extraordinarily well in his life.
21 asked you for $8 million, $8 million, and then in
22 the same breath, Mr. Schlesinger said: Or maybe
23 $500,000, maybe $500,000. That would be okay too.
24 $8 million or maybe $500,000.
And perhaps Dr. Soloway did say it best,
Notwithstanding that, the plaintiffs
Their request for $8 million defies
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
Last issue, if you get to this issue, as
The bottom line is that nobody should be
1 common sense. It just defies common sense. No
2 basis for it in the record, especially when you
3 retract it in the same breath: $500,000 would be
4 okay too.
6 rewarded even $500,000 for choosing to smoke for
7 over 40 years while your wife and children and
8 friends and coworkers and everybody in your life
9 was telling you: Stop, stop, stop, and protect
10 your health.
12 I think you know, the last issue on the verdict
13 form is plaintiffs have asked you to find that
14 they are entitled to come back next week and have
15 another mini trial that will last two to three
16 days.
18 three more days, and ask you to award them
19 punitive damages over and above, over and above
20 what you decide compensates Mr. Shulman, if you
21 decide to compensate him.
23 trial. So I've got to talk about that.
The first thing you need to know is that
25 the last question has a different burden of proof.
They want to come back next week, two to
They want to come back and have another
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
1 It's called clear and convincing evidence.
And it's evidence that's precise,
3 explicit, lacking confusion and of such weight
4 that it produces a firm belief of conviction,
5 without hesitation.
In other words, the highest burden you
7 can have in a civil trial. They have to prove to
8 you a higher burden in order to bring you back
9 here next week.
Just a couple things for you to think
11 about, I'm not going to go through these in any
12 detail, although I will talk about this one.
The other instruction you're going to
14 see is that the Engle -- in determining whether
15 punitive damages may be warranted, that's that
16 final question, you may not consider in any way
17 the findings regarding defendants' conduct from
18 the prior lawsuit.
20 considered by you when determining whether or not
21 to award punitive damages.
23 this very quickly, with respect to the question of
24 not compensation.
Dr. Proctor, I'm going to go through
So the Engle findings cannot be
But what did -- on top of that, the
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
He told you about the Council for
But you heard that the Council for
1 defendants need to be punished with a civil fine,
2 Dr. Proctor told you that the defendants spent a
3 fortune making 50 to 100 different modifications
4 of cigarettes to try to make them less hazardous.
6 Tobacco Research. They call it leakage. They
7 call it leakage.
9 Tobacco researched funded and published thousands
10 and thousands of high quality studies, including
11 by researchers that became Nobel prize winners and
12 that they funded research concluding that smoking
13 causes addiction, COPD, and lung cancer.
With respect to Reynolds, Dr. Proctor
15 talked to you about the Premier cigarette, the
16 heat but not burn technology. Reynolds spent a
17 billion dollars, a billion dollars trying to make
18 a safer cigarette from the early 18- -- 1980s to
19 1990s. Dr. Proctor admitted less risky for lung
20 cancer, but consumers rejected it.
And interestingly, Dr. Seidman told you
22 that, in fact, Reynolds had spent $40 million to
23 buy a company that manufactures nicotine gum
24 that's used to help smokers quit. Reynolds is
25 trying to help smokers quit, and they want you to
4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
I would like to be Robert Duval, but I'm
1 come back and punish us.
You've also been told that the FDA has
3 regulatory power over the tobacco industry since
4 2009 and that -- and I'm not wistful about this.
6 not wistful about this, as Mr. Schlesinger
7 suggested to you.
The tobacco-burning cigarette market is
9 in a period of collapse, as Dr. Proctor told you.
Smoking prevalence is dropping. It
11 dropped two percent just last year, and that's
12 among adults. It's dropping even faster among
13 youth.
15 plummeted since 1997, down 66 percent since that
16 time, that smoking has been denormalized among
17 youth. Smoking is not cool. It's not glamorous.
18 It's not sexy among youth. It's stigmatized.
The tobacco issue is under control,
20 under the FDA control. Smoking has been
21 denormalized. Smoking rates are dropping to the
22 floor.
There's simply no need for punishment in
24 this case even if you get to that question. None
25 of us need to come back next week for another
Dr. Proctor told you that it has I'll just remind you of a couple
1 three-day trial.
I have two minutes. Okay.
Okay. Sometimes, after all this, it
4 comes down to something pretty simple, and the
5 simple truth is that smoking is, and has always
6 been, viewed as a choice that each of us as an
7 adult in this great country gets to decide for
8 ourselves, and then take personal responsibility
9 for that choice.
11 things. So the question here, of course, is that
12 when you get to Question 8, for all the reasons I
13 just stated, the answer here is no, and whatever
14 the rest of your verdict is, we all get to go home
15 for Thanksgiving next week. If you say "yes,"
16 we'll see you next week.
18 of, really, what do you boil all -- this case all
19 the way down to?
You saw this from "See It Now", one of
21 the prominent cancer researchers in 1955. He got
22 it right. He got it right.

4b55aaf6-32fa-4997-8403-9dc6a7f69111
Here is Dr. Hammond reporting on the
VOICE: It is now established, in my
1 Murrow. Tonight the first of two reports on
2 cigarettes and lung cancer.

5 study of the smoking habits of American men.
7 results of the first two years.
9 opinion, beyond a reasonable doubt, that cigarette
10 smoking greatly increases the probability of
11 developing lung cancer.
In my opinion, people should be warned
13 of the dangers, and they are being warned. What
14 they then want to do, whether they wish to smoke
15 or not, is their own business.
18 It's their own business.
20 out. You saw a clip of Harry Reasoner discussing
21 the release of that report.
24 Smoking and Health, the findings of the Surgeon
25 General's Committee.
(Video clip concluded.)
1955, they get to make their choice.
(Video clip played as follows:)
VOICE: This is a CBS News Extra on
1964, Surgeon General's report comes

VOICE: Almost from the moment that
Cigarette smoking is a significant cause
2 cigarettes were introduced, they were attacked,
3 but the attacks took a new turn ten years ago and
4 culminated in today's report by the Surgeon
5 General's committee.
This, in summary, is what the committee
7 says: Cigarette smoking is a major cause of lung
8 cancer in men, and data on women smokers points
9 the same way.
11 of cancer of the larynx and probably the most
12 important cause of chronic bronchitis.
14 other lung diseases.
16 rate from heart disease, although it's not proven
17 that smoking is the cause.
19 committee says there is no evidence they do any
20 good, but it didn't exclude the possibility that
21 an effective filter might be developed.
In short, the committee says: If you
23 smoke cigarettes, you increase your chances of
24 dying early. The sooner you start, the more you
25 smoke, the more you inhale, the worse your chances
Male smokers have a much higher death
Cigarette smoking may be related to

8 may depend on it.
This is Harry Reasoner. Good night.
(Video clip concluded.)
Choice and personal responsibility, two
12 principles that fit hand in glove with Mr. Shulman
13 and the way he lived his life and what he taught
14 his family.
Here's what Harvey told us. Harvey told
16 us that Mr. Shulman was a controlled, independent
17 man who believed in responsibility, and he taught
18 his sons responsibility.
Ladies and gentlemen, you've been very
20 patient with me today. It's been an honor and a
21 privilege to try this case before you.
23 you've given us.
The only thing we ask of you is that
25 when you go back there to deliberate, you apply
I appreciate all the attentiveness


CLOSING STATEMENT
MR. BRENNER: Five weeks. It's our we started this trial. The plaintiff
And I know I don't speak for just any --
1 livelihoods. And you guys do it as a service, a
2 service to your community and your sense of civic
3 duty.
5 just my client, I speak for all the defendants.
6 I'm sure I speak for the plaintiff and his counsel
7 as well, just -- just a simple thank you. Your
8 commitment has been -- has been fantastic.
10 had two really lengthy witnesses. And one was
11 Dr. Proctor.
13 I'm going to talk a little bit about Mr.
14 --Dr. Proctor.
16 going to get into a whole tit for tat with
17 Dr. Proctor about things he said, but I will touch
18 a little bit about them.
But his whole testimony was every smoker
20 is the same, right, because what he does, and you
21 saw it, is he makes sure that he never knows
22 anything about the smoker.
24 that didn't work so well. So now he makes sure he
25 knows nothing about the smoker so whatever you ask
And Mr. Furr talked a lot about him.
But I promised you in opening I wasn't
He used to do it, and then he realized just think about that when you
1 him about why his opinion doesn't apply to, in
2 this case, Mr. Shulman, he says: I don't know.
3 So why does he do that?
Why -- the man makes literally millions
5 of dollars, literally millions of dollars, and he
6 doesn't do the simple step to see if what he's
7 talking about has any connection to the plaintiff
8 in the case.
10 evaluate Dr. Proctor's testimony and how it fits
11 into the case.
But Dr. Seidman, I didn't think I'd
13 start off my closing with -- agreeing with the
14 plaintiff's expert, but I do. This was -- he
15 comes in here and this was one of his first
16 answers, one of the first things he told you.
18 All smokers are not alike. Some are like apples,
19 and some are like oranges.
21 time with you talking about, is how does all this
22 fit in with Mr. Shulman?
24 The plaintiff has made sure you know about the
25 generic case about smokers in general and the
You know all about the generic smoker.
He says: Not all smokers -- he says:
And your job, as Mr. Furr spent some 1 tobacco companies.
But your job, as Mr. Furr pointed out,
3 is to go through the verdict form and figure out
4 if any of it applies to Mr. Shulman. And Mr. Furr
5 explained it really doesn't. It really doesn't.
6 He is an extraordinary man for lots of reasons.
Mr. Furr told you I am going to cover
8 the issue of residency, so let's get into that
9 first.
11 please, Mr. Witt -- oh, we have a change in
12 clicking.
15 first of all, this is a question on the verdict
16 form. I think you all still have your copies.
It's fair to say that the plaintiff's
18 treatment of this issue in their closing argument
19 was -- was one of dismissiveness, as if it doesn't
20 exist.
22 promised to essentially mock whatever I say later.
But for an issue that doesn't really
24 exist, it's the second question on the verdict
25 form. It is absolutely part of the Engle class
Okay. Thank you.
All right. So it's fair to say that --
So you can bring up the next slide,
In fact, I think Mr. Schlesinger The Engle class is specifically limited
And you are going to have to decide what
1 membership definition.
3 to Florida residents, no doubt about it. Mr.
4 Schlesinger showed it to you.
6 that means here for Mr. Shulman, but we spent a
7 lot of time litigating an issue that the plaintiff
8 says doesn't matter. And what do I mean by that?
9 Think about the testimony of both Harvey Shulman
10 and his father.
12 The condo we bought in 1983 was a permanent
13 residency.
Kept saying it. Any -- it was almost
15 any -- it was a permanent resident. We meant to
16 be a permanent resident.
19 bit.
21 please.
This is the timeline of Robert Shulman,
23 of Mr. Shulman's life. No dispute here. Here's
24 what he is.
They could not get that out fast enough.
Okay. Let's talk about that a little
They could not say it enough to you:
You can bring up the next timeline,
The Shulmans, Mr. and Mrs. Shulman, are we're going to talk about that home,
1 lifelong New Englanders. Okay? They were born in
2 the Boston area. They lived there exclusively
3 from 1920, in the case of Mr. Shulman, until 1979.
5 successful man. And in 1979, he sells his house
6 in Boston, in Winthrop, and at the same time, he
7 buys a home in Maine.
9 but remember when we talked about the home, how
10 the plaintiffs kept insisting that I call it a
11 cabin as if to indicate to you that it was really
12 this little cabin?
Well, they buy -- and we'll talk about
14 what it really is, but they buy the home in Maine
15 because they want to be near their son, Harvey.
16 Harvey also has a home in Maine.
18 an apartment, first in Winthrop and then in a town
19 called Malden, I think he said, in the Boston
20 area. He's still working at the time. They're
21 still in New England, no doubt about it. And
22 they're going back and forth between New
23 England and -- I mean, excuse me, between Maine
24 and Boston.
And in '79, although Mr. Shulman keeps
He builds up a business, a very
In 1983 or shortly before, Harvey buys a -- and for the next 14 years, no
1 place in Florida. Harvey tells you he becomes a
2 snowbird. Okay. No doubt about it. Harvey gets
3 a snowbirding place.
You're from Palm Beach County. You know
5 what snowbirds are. And Mr. Shulman and his wife
6 first come to stay with Harvey a couple times, and
7 then they buy a condominium, a one-bedroom
8 condominium in Lighthouse Point.
10 question about it, they have, whatever it is, the
11 one-bedroom condo in Lighthouse Point and they
12 have the cabin or home in Maine. No one is
13 disputing that.
15 the question for you is, during this period,
16 right?
If the -- if the question was: Did the
18 Shulmans own some property in Florida since 1983,
19 no one would be asking you the question on the
20 verdict form. No one is disputing that. That's
21 not the question.
23 time --
25 approach?
And the class cutoff period is 1996. So
Here is the question: During this
MR. HAMMER: Objection. Can we THE COURT: Stop the time when they
(The following discussion was held
MR. HAMMER: Judge, the fact that --
The defense is disputing that. That is
2 approach up here.
4 sidebar:)
6 what Mr. Brenner just said is, no one is disputing
7 that.
9 why it's an issue. If it was a simple issue of
10 they bought a home down here, they had -- they
11 were snowbirds, they could --
13 the words "no one is disputing."
15 said -- he's telling you what I'm disputing. I'm
16 not disputing that they bought a place in
17 Lighthouse Point in 1983.
There is nothing to strike. This is a
19 nonsense objection. There is nothing to strike.
21 disputing that -- what did you say exactly?
MR. BRENNER: I said: No one is
23 disputing they bought a place in Lighthouse Point
24 in 1983. I don't understand the objection.
THE COURT: What's wrong with that? Are
THE COURT: Well, I could just strike
MR. BRENNER: No, no, no. No, no. I
THE COURT: The fact that no one is They're claiming Mr. Shulman is not a
THE COURT: If the question was --
1 they disputing that they bought one in 1983?
MR. HAMMER: No. No. What the -- what
3 Mr. Brenner said is: The plaintiffs are making a
4 big deal about this residency. This is their
5 defense, residency. They're claiming that
6 Mr. Shulman is not a resident.
8 resident. It's usually not even an issue in these
9 cases. They're making it the issue.
11 here's what he said: If the question was: Did
12 the Shulmans own some property in Florida since
13 1983, no one would be asking you the question on
14 the verdict form. No one is disputing that.
16 the objection, Your Honor.
THE COURT: It's not that they owned --
18 so he's just saying no one is disputing that they
19 owned property in Florida since 1983.
21 for this objection. It's disruptive.
THE COURT: That's a correct
23 statement --
MR. HAMMER: Judge, the fact is --
THE COURT: -- isn't it?
MR. BRENNER: Right. I don't understand
MR. BRENNER: Right. There's no basis THE COURT: No, no. All they're saying
MR. HAMMER: That is accurate.
MR. BRENNER: Wait. Just so Mr. Hammer
MR. BRENNER: Yes.
MR. HAMMER: The fact is if it wasn't an
3 issue -- it's only an issue because the defense is
4 creating that issue. So to put the burden on the
5 plaintiffs that they're creating this issue is
6 inaccurate.
8 is that no one is disputing that they owned a
9 condo since 1983. Isn't that an accurate fact?
12 knows --
16 that are really nonsensical.
18 want to come up again. I don't want to come up
19 again.
21 inappropriate. It's part of their proof of being
22 a class member.
25 court:)
THE COURT: So that's overruled.
That's overruled.
Let's try to avoid these are objections
MR. BRENNER: Excuse me though. I don't
Just so Mr. Hammer knows, it's not
THE COURT: All right. Let's go.
(The sidebar discussion was concluded MR. BRENNER: As I was saying, no one
MR. SCHLESINGER: Objection, Judge.
MR. BRENNER: Your Honor, may we
No one disputes through the entire time
2 disputes these basic facts. No one disputes that
3 Mr. and Mrs. Shulman bought a one-bedroom condo in
4 1983 in Florida.
6 that they're snowbirds during this time.
So the question you have to ask -- and
8 no one disputes that this entire time they have a
9 house in Maine.
Okay? Those are the facts.
So the question you're going to have to
12 ask at the end of the day is: Were they residents
13 of Maine who liked to come and spend some time in
14 the winter in Florida or were they residents of
15 Florida who liked to spend some time in the summer
16 in Maine?
18 Move to strike. That's not -- that's not a legal
19 question at all.
21 approach?
24 just see the last question.
MR. SCHLESINGER: There's no such --
THE COURT: Hang on a second. Let me
Overruled. MR. BRENNER: Okay. So that's what
2 you're going to have to ask, and interestingly --
ARE you okay? Yes?
Okay. Interestingly, you got some --
5 one of you, at the conclusion of Mr. Shulman's
6 testimony, asked the key question -- because how
7 do you answer that question?
You answer that question -- one of the
9 ways you answer that question is: Where does --
10 where does a guy like Mr. Shulman live?
You know about his whole life. Is he a
12 guy that's going to live in a little condo? Is he
13 going to live -- what makes sense?
And someone asked -- I don't know who.
15 Someone asked: What was the size of the house in
16 Maine, or the cabin in Maine, and what was the
17 size of the Florida condo, in 1997, when these
18 transactions take place?
20 Mr. Shulman said the one-bedroom condo was 1500
21 square feet. That's what he said. I don't have
22 the records on the condo. I can't say. That's
23 what -- that's his memory of it.
If that's consistent with what you-all
25 know about one-bedroom condos in communities that
Great question. Great question. We can look at what Harvey said about
On the home in Maine, or the cabin in
1 dot the landscape of Broward and Palm Beach
2 County, that's for your determination.
4 it. Harvey described it as a very small
5 one-bedroom condo.
7 Maine, Mr. Shulman said -- he said it was 15 feet
8 by 18 to 20 feet.
So, at the maximum, he says the thing in
10 Maine is 300 total square feet. That's what he's
11 telling you. That's what he tell -- that's what
12 he remembered, 300 square feet.
14 remembers. A lot of what I'm going to tell you
15 today, I think we need to look at the actual
16 records.
Mr. Shulman, as you -- as counsel has
18 already brought out, medical records are brought
19 out, he -- he's having memory loss, but let's look
20 at what the records say, because they're in
21 evidence, about the cabin in Maine.
24 The cabin in Maine, according to Mr. Shulman, is
25 on a lake big enough for him to fly, land, take
Next slide.
The cabin in Maine is on 2.39 acres.
I don't think Mr. Shulman really it's a lake big enough that you can
1 off his own -- I call it a puddle jumper, sea
2 plane. I think puddle jumper is a wrong word.
4 take off and land a plane. It's on 2.4 acres,
5 2.39 acres.
Let's go to the next one.
This was -- if you recall, I brought it
8 up. I was constantly being told: Don't call it a
9 cabin. Don't call it a cabin. Don't call it a
10 cabin. Don't call it a cabin -- I mean: Don't
11 call it a house. It's a cabin. It's a cabin.
12 It's a cabin.
This is what Mr. Shulman told us. He
14 actually remodeled it. We talked about it. He
15 remodeled it with his son. It was not a cabin.
16 Okay. It just wasn't.
18 lifelong New Englanders. Okay.
21 so I want to be totally up front with you.
This is a picture of the home, but it's
23 taken in 2004. Okay. I cannot tell you what it
24 looked like exactly in 1997. This is a picture of
25 the home in 2004.
Next.
Okay. This is the best record we have,
They loved this place. They are Mr. Shulman -- Mr. Shulman said: We
Again, if I could, I would. If I could
There was a remodel in 2002. I cannot
2 tell you what happened in that remodel. I don't
3 know. I can only tell you the evidence we have.
4 It's 2004. There's a picture of it. The square
5 footage of it in 2004 is 5,700 -- just under 5,700
6 square feet.
8 tell you exactly what it was like in 1997, I
9 would. I can't. This was not a little cabin in
10 Maine. This was the Shulmans' home.
12 couldn't even get there until July 4th ever.
You'll see the medical records in
14 evidence. They were there plenty before July 4th
15 every year, every single year, because they split
16 their time. And you have to answer that question:
17 Which one was their permanent home?
And let's go back to the timeline.
The other thing we know is that at least
20 the Shulmans, when did -- they sell their home in
21 Maine. At that point, they decide that the
22 one-bedroom condo is not something they can live
23 in year-round, and they buy the house they live in
24 now, the house in Delray Beach.
And we did ask Mr. Shulman about this, you sell the house in Maine, the
Yeah, I remember that. We just had to
And this is the question you're going to
Well, you then decide that you're going
1 what his thoughts were about what happened in 1997
2 when they left Maine, and let's just walk through
3 that real quick.
5 remodeled cabin. This is me asking questions, I
6 believe.
8 to purchase a new home in Florida. Do you
9 remember that? This is in 1997.
11 make Florida our permanent home.
13 have to answer because if they don't become
14 permanent residents of Florida until 1997, then
15 the Engle class is not for them.
18 lives -- Mr. Shulman is 77 -- actually he's
19 probably 76, about to turn 77, that's the first
20 time in their lives that the Shulmans spend
21 year-round in Florida. Those are the facts.
Now let me give you one more fact.
23 Another thing you may look at other than the size
24 of the home or things like that is, how did the
25 Shulmans feel about Florida?
Just the next slide, please.
And in 1997, for the first time in their 1
Mr. Shulman told you in '83 they were
2 committed. Florida was the place they wanted to
3 be, right? 1983, Florida was their home. They
4 loved it here. This is where they wanted to be.
Well, in 1995, Mr. Shulman is diagnosed
6 with bladder cancer, we know that, in Maine, and
7 we've heard about this record a bunch of times.
8 After his surgery, he's then being evaluated for
9 potential chemotherapy.
And what happened is, is that it is in
11 the fall period -- the surgery was in August --
12 into the October period. And he's meeting with
13 the doctors in Maine about his chemo- -- the
14 potential chemotherapy.
16 usually goes down to Florida. So he's talking to
17 the doctors about where he should start
18 chemotherapy. He ends up not getting
19 chemotherapy.
And I just want you to see one other
21 record. This is Mr. Shulman with his doctors
22 talking about Florida, having to go down a little
23 earlier. They're talking about the transfer of
24 care, and Mr. Shulman says he hates Florida.
25 Okay?
But he knows that in the winter, he Let's go back to the verdict form
There's a second part of this where it
So you have to determine, in the class
2 period, if Mr. Shulman was someone who lived in
3 Florida and just spent some time in Maine or lived
4 in Maine and spent time in Florida. And that will
5 be for you to decide.
7 question on the next slide, please.
9 starts, where the disease manifests. Did it
10 manifest when he was in Florida, when he was a
11 resident of it? I think it's subsumed in the
12 first question, but just in case anyone is
13 wondering where are the diseases that he's
14 claiming, where was he when he got them, we can
15 just pick through that very quickly.
Next slide.
This is 6-20-95. This says hematuria.
18 That's blood in the urine. He's in Maine. This
19 is what ultimately -- you can go to the next
20 slide.
22 in his urine. This leads ultimately to his
23 bladder cancer.
25 Medical Center.
This is the next month. Noticed blood
You can go to the next slide. Maine This ultimately leads to his bladder
This is after he already has bladder
2 cancer diagnosis. No question about that.
Now the plaintiff has tried to address
4 this issue of the blood in the urine first being
5 perhaps found in Florida.
Can you go to the next slide?
And let me tell you what they're relying
8 on. I just want you to have all the facts. This
9 is December 1995.
11 cancer. This is when he's come down to
12 Dr. Benedetto. This is the chemotherapy
13 evaluation.
And Dr. Benedetto says that a year and a
15 half prior, he had had blood in the urine and was
16 told it was related to bicycle riding, nothing to
17 do with bladder cancer. At least that's what
18 everyone thought at the time.
20 when he had blood in the urine. We know it's a
21 year and a half before Christmastime, December
22 1995, which would take you to June of 1994.
24 Shulmans' life between 1983 and 1987, they're
25 summering in Maine, and you'll see that in the
And, in fact, we don't know where he was
If it was like every other year in the 1 medical records.
We just don't have the '94 medical
3 records, through no fault of the plaintiff,
4 through no fault of the defendant. It doesn't
5 exist.
I can't tell you where it was. I can
7 tell you where he was. I can just tell you that
8 it had to do with bicycle riding, at least that's
9 what they thought at the time, and that at least a
10 month would work out that he is in Maine at the
11 time.
14 you, you know the defense position is Mr. Shulman
15 never had COPD, but the -- the plaintiff keeps
16 going to this record that says he had COPD.
17 That's also in Maine.
19 he did have it, the first time he -- he -- he says
20 he learned about it would have been in Maine.
23 Maine.
The next record.
Coronary artery disease, again we think
The next record.
You know that -- as Mr. Furr said to
We don't believe he ever had COPD. If
The next record, please.
And he says that, he says he's told in they showed some records where
Next question [sic].
October 1995, also in Maine.
So that -- that's the evidence you're
1 the record is pretty clear he gets it in 2003, but
2 they showed, Dr. Wohlgelernter -- Wohlgelernter --
3 I should say Dr. Dan.
5 there's -- here it's a question as to CAD from
6 1995, again, also in Maine.
10 going to have on the issue of residency and,
11 again, it comes down to really what were the
12 Shulmans?
Maine residents who liked to escape the
14 winter and come to Florida or vice versa, Florida
15 residents who liked to escape the winter --
16 Florida residents who liked to escape the summer
17 and go to Maine.
19 Florida.
21 I -- I suggest to you that when you get to
22 Question 2 on your verdict form, because of these
23 facts -- which I said to you, the facts are
24 undisputed. You just have to determine what to do
25 with them.
No one likes to escape the winter in
Okay. That's on the issue of residency. I suggest to you that Mr. Shulman has
Now I just have to say one more thing
The purpose of the Engle class, in
2 now proven to you that he was a resident of
3 Florida at the time his disease manifested, either
4 the bladder cancer, coronary artery disease, or
5 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
7 about this, and Mr. Schlesinger essentially called
8 this defense a technicality.
Okay. As Mr. Furr said to you, we have
10 both -- we have full faith that you will go back
11 and follow the instructions and follow the law --
12 follow the law.
14 you. It is not a technicality. It is what the
15 Florida courts have determined is what the purpose
16 of the Engle class is for.
18 addition to the other elements Mr. Furr talked
19 about, is for Florida residents. No one -- no one
20 disputes that. So it's not a technicality.
22 the plaintiff's proof, which they have not been
23 able to prove in this case.
25 bit about Dr. Proctor because Mr. Schlesinger
It is -- it is a -- it is an element of
And where the facts take you, they take
Okay. Let me segue into just a little 1 brought up a couple things. Dr. Proctor said a
2 few things that were -- and I just want to give
3 you an example of each -- that were misleading,
4 false, and irrelevant.
I'm going to give you an example just to
6 show you how clearly these things are. The first
7 one is misleading, and Mr. Schlesinger did this --
8 brought the same testimony up. Don't bring the
9 testimony up.
Mr. Schlesinger said in his closing that
11 ammonia made cigarettes more addictive, and that's
12 what Dr. Proctor said. They were all over that.
13 It's free-basing. It's potency. It's kick.
It sounds really bad. It does sound
15 really bad if that -- like the ammonia makes it
16 this -- this super-addictive thing.
18 and then we just asked Dr. Proctor the simple
19 question.
Let's go.
This is -- and you saw impeachment.
22 What this is, just so you can understand the
23 slide, this is me reading back to Dr. Proctor his
24 testimony from either a prior deposition or a
25 prior trial.
So we -- we listened to six days of it, he was asked: When you say more
And then what I said to him: Did I
Okay. And I got through reading the
That's correct. In fact, if you added
2 potent, talking about ammonia, you are not saying
3 more addictive, right?
5 ammonia to a traditional cigarette, it would
6 actually make it less addictive.
8 answer. So adding ammonia, not only does it not
9 make it more addictive, as plaintiff suggested to
10 you, it actually makes it less addictive.
12 read that correctly? Instead of just saying yes,
13 he said: Yeah, that's exactly what I just said,
14 as if he had been saying that for six days. As if
15 the message about ammonia is he was trying to tell
16 you for six days: You've got to know about this
17 ammonia thing. It's really great to put it in, it
18 makes it less addictive, as if that was the
19 message he was communicating to the jury.
These folks should be applauded for
21 adding ammonia to their cigarettes because it
22 makes it less addictive.
So when he gets caught, he says: Yeah,
24 that's what I've been saying all long. If you add
25 it to a cigarette, it would actually make it less that's another place where
Second, let's give an example of false
This is from 1965, and it's a -- a
Let's go to the next document.
Mr. Schlesinger bought up this document.
1 addictive, or it could make it less addictive.
3 Dr. Proctor's testimony is entirely misleading and
4 inappropriate. Why is he doing that?
6 testimony. And Dr. Proctor knows all this,
7 because when you got -- when you cross-examine
8 him, he usually admits it.
11 He brought it up in his closing argument. He
12 said -- I forgot if he called him Mr. Tamol or
13 Dr. Tamol or what he called him.
15 document from -- it appears from a -- one page
16 from a lab notebook from a Philip Morris employee.
And this was the smoking gun. It says
18 that: We're only going to make enough cigarettes
19 to keep smokers hooked.
21 you all about that. Yeah, this is terrible,
22 they're only making -- they're only going to make
23 cigarettes with enough nicotine to cig- -- keep
24 smokers hooked.
But Dr. Proctor knows what's coming when
And Dr. Proctor, you know, he's telling I said: You believe that the next
1 he says that.
Let's go to the next page.
He knows that Philip Morris made three
4 separate brands of cigarettes that not only did
5 not have enough nicotine to keep smokers hooked,
6 he, himself, describes it not only as -- I said
7 they're less addictive. He corrects me.
9 cigarette -- there was three brands, this was just
10 one of them -- which was one of the brands you
11 said was certainly less addictive than traditional
12 cigarettes, correct?
14 addictive. I would say it's nonaddictive. It
15 could not create or sustain addiction. Too low --
16 too little nicotine in the rod.
Exactly the opposite of the document he
18 shared with you and that plaintiff shared with you
19 in closing today, exact opposite.
The document -- they say it says: We'll
21 never do it, some guy writing in a notebook. And,
22 in fact, they did do it. My client did do it.
Okay. The next thing is that -- I don't
24 even remember this. It was like 6:15 at night on
25 like the sixth or seventh day of Dr. Proctor's
And he says: It's not only less 1 testimony, and the plaintiff triumphantly reopened
2 his testimony to examine him about the issue of
3 light cigarettes, as if we hadn't heard of
4 Dr. Proctor.
So this is in the irrelevant category.
Mr. Shulman, in his entire life, never
7 smoked a light cigarette. From 6:30 until like 8
8 at night, we talked about light cigarettes with
9 Dr. Proctor for something Mr. Shulman never
10 smoked, ever, not Philip Morris products, not
11 Reynolds' products, not Liggett products, none of
12 them. Never smoked a light cigarette.
14 recall, Dr. Proctor's proof of this -- remember
15 his big thing was light cigarettes deliver the
16 same tar as regular cigarettes.
18 that was he had seen one study in a Philip Morris
19 document that said: If five machines smoked a
20 cigarette three -- and they switched from a
21 regular to a light, three will deliver the same
22 amount of tar or something. That was the whole
23 proof.
And then I showed him one with the same
25 exact study but with 200, and he said: You know,
That was his claim, and his proof of
In fact, this was the one, if you So, again, I'm not going to -- I'm not
And the next issue I want to talk about
1 I think the one with five is probably more
2 reliable, because it agrees with him.
4 going to -- to bore you going through those
5 studies again, but, again, that's an example of
6 Dr. Proctor giving you completely irrelevant
7 testimony.
9 just a little bit is -- is filtered cigarettes,
10 and Mr. Furr covered it a little bit. Plaintiff
11 seems to be taking the position here that -- and
12 they even call it -- they call it the filter
13 fraud.
15 is here. Let's first go to the -- the
16 instruction. Mr. Furr showed this to you, or part
17 of it to you. I'm snowing you, I think, the
18 third -- the third paragraph.
20 paragraph that the plaintiff showed that talks
21 about it being in combination with another cause.
22 So there's another paragraph below here, and
23 there's one in between.
25 the tobacco companies didn't tell Mr. Shulman
But what the plaintiff is saying is that
Well, let's talk about what their claim
And, by the way, there's another there is no claim, but I just want to
1 something about a filtered cigarette that caused
2 him to act differently essentially.
This is what they have to prove. They
4 have to prove there was a statement made. First
5 of all, you -- no one disputes -- Mr. Furr showed
6 it to you.
There's never been a statement that
8 filtered cigarettes are safe or safer from the
9 tobacco companies, never, never. Not one that
10 Mr. Shulman heard, just never.
12 talk to you -- remember when Dr. Proctor said
13 about filtered cigarettes? I just want to apply
14 it to Mr. Shulman.
Here's what he said about filtered
16 cigarettes. One, people only switch to them
17 because they think they're safer, or primarily
18 switch to them because they think they're safer.
19 That's one thing he said.
21 instead of quitting. They mean to quit and then
22 they switched to a filtered cigarette. They're
23 intercepted. Three, when they switch, they smoke
24 more. And four, when they switch, they smoke
25 differently.
He said, two, people switch to them Let's just look at the other things that
He switched to please Mrs. Shulman. She
None of those apply to Mr. Shulman.
Let's go to the next slide, please.
3 There's two more, please. The next one, please.
Mr. Shulman did say on the stand that he
5 switched because he thought they were safer. That
6 was one of the things that the plaintiff asked
7 him, and he did say.
9 we -- we had to bring out through Dr. Seidman
10 through Mr. Shulman's previous testimony.
12 was always on his case, so he said: You know
13 what, honey, I'll switch to a filtered cigarette.
14 He wanted her to stop nagging.
16 from turning yellow, prevent his teeth from
17 turning yellow, to soften the smoke, to remove the
18 hint of bitterness from the smoke.
Those are the -- the -- the nonhealth
20 reasons that Mr. Shulman, not what he said here,
21 but what he had said previously about his switch.
But let's go to the next slide.
First of all, someone asked this, I
24 believe -- someone asked about: Did Marlboro
25 filtered cigarettes have the same warning label as
He thought it would prevent his fingers They say people didn't know it was
We asked Mr. Shulman: Were you
1 other cigarettes?
Yes.
All cigarettes have the same warning
4 label, mandated by the government, changed in
5 1966, 1970, 1985, all the same. Filtered
6 cigarettes, unfiltered cigarettes, all the same.
8 dangerous. As soon as they knew it was dangerous,
9 they switched. Mr. Shulman knew it was dangerous
10 since the '30s.
12 intercepted? Were you about to quit when he
13 switched to filtered? He said: No, I had no
14 intention of quitting. No intention of quitting
15 was his testimony.
17 increase the amount of cigarettes he smoked when
18 he switched to filters. Dr. Seidman said he did
19 -- remember this was the one where he said: Oh,
20 yeah, he was at two packs. He went way above two
21 packs, and then he showed him Mr. Shulman's sworn
22 deposition where he never changed at all the
23 amount he smoked.
25 Look at the medical records. You'll never find
And you can look at the medical records.
Dr. Seidman -- Mr. Shulman did not This whole story of Dr. Filter --
I said: You've seen no evidence,
1 that he went to -- way above two packs. He's a
2 pack to pack and a quarter, maybe pack and a half
3 a day smoker until the recent -- very recent 2015
4 records from the Memory Center, and he did not
5 change the way he smoked cigarettes.
7 Dr. Proctor -- Dr. Filter -- Dr. Proctor said
8 about inhaling deeper and all this stuff, and I
9 asked Mr. Shulman: You've seen no evidence of
10 that? He said it on direct.
12 Dr. Seidman, if he ever did that -- if Mr. Shulman
13 ever did that? And what did he say? He said:
14 Well, I extrapolated that he did. And I said:
15 Does that mean because some people do, you assume
16 Mr. Shulman did? And he said: Yeah, exactly.
18 filtered cigarettes have no connection to
19 Mr. Shulman's case.
21 little bit about Marlboro cigarettes. Philip
22 Morris makes Marlboro cigarettes. You saw that
23 Mr. Schlesinger said that the two main brands that
24 Mr. Shulman smoked were Lucky Strike and Marlboro,
25 and Philip Morris makes Marlboro.
So all these things they told you about
I want to switch gears and just talk a remember, they told you --
Then Mr. Shulman, when I asked a little
So we -- let's go to the next page.
That's the ads that they're relying on
2 Mr. Shulman said: Yeah, I switched to Marlboro
3 because the ads, they -- they basically screamed
4 safety to me. I said: Okay. Let's look at the
5 ads. Look at the ads you showed.
8 that said filters are safer.
10 bit about it --
You can go to the next slide.
I asked him: There was nothing in the
13 ad -- words or statements in the ad that caused
14 you to buy Marlboro cigarettes? He said he
15 couldn't answer.
17 cowboy?
19 Mr. Shulman used to break horses? Interesting
20 guy, a pilot and breaking horses, you know, run
21 the gamut.
And he said: Yeah, that's what
23 attracted me was the cowboy on the horse.
25 Country?
I said: You liked the picture of the
Remember this whole story that
And I said: You remember Marlboro Yes.
You remember: Come to where the flavor
Now, Mr. Shulman did say -- and I'd like
Yes.
So, again, this is a case of shoehorning
3 is?
6 Mr. Shulman into Dr. Proctor's story.
7 Dr. Proctor's story said filters -- advertising
8 about filters said they were safer or connoted
9 safety. These are the ads --
Go back one slide, please.
These are the ads that Mr. Shulman told
12 us attracted him to Marlboro cigarettes. You'll
13 have to make a judgment whether that ad calls out
14 saying filters are safer.
16 to give you the evidence as best I can.
Mr. Shulman did say on direct
18 examination that he switched to Marlboros in 1960.
19 That's what he said. And on cross-examination,
20 I --
23 approximation -- this was from his deposition.
24 Can you even approximate when you started smoking
25 Marlboros? Again, this is before we get into --
You can bring up, I guess, two more now.
I asked him: Can you give me an THE CLERK: Counsel, 30 minutes has gone
MR. BRENNER: And I asked if he
Now Harvey, younger man, has a
1 to trial. He says: No, I can't. And I said: Do
2 you even recall how old your children were when
3 you started smoking Marlboros? He says: No, I
4 can't.
6 by.
8 remembers whether they were still living in the
9 house at the time he started smoking Marlboros,
10 and he says no.
12 completely different memory about Marlboro
13 cigarettes.
16 home until 1972, and Harvey, by his own
17 description, I have no reason to doubt he was
18 very, very close with his father. I have no
19 reason to doubt it, but pilots -- seem to be a
20 very loving family.
I think the evidence is clear that they
22 were a loving family and are a loving family. I
23 think the evidence is clear on that. No one
24 disputes that.
And we can go to the next slide, please.
We asked Harvey because Harvey lived at
So we asked Harvey about when his dad We asked him if his father ever told him
MR. SCHLESINGER: Excuse me, Judge. I
We know today -- I think we've gone for
1 started smoking Marlboro cigarettes. He said:
2 The first time was after I moved out of the house
3 in 1972.
5 why he smoked Marlboro.
No.
And we asked him: Do you know whether
8 Marlboro was ever even his primary brand, and he
9 said, no, he doesn't know.
11 a while, but today it seems now everyone has
12 agreed Mr. Shulman quit smoking in 1975. So at
13 most, Mr. Shulman smoked Marlboro cigarettes for
14 three years.
Now Mr. Furr showed you verdict form
16 Question Number 3 about product use, and let me
17 just say the following: I don't believe any of
18 the defendants' products caused any --
20 let it go, but what he believes --
22 reference -- the jury should disregard the
23 reference to whatever Mr. Brenner believes or
24 doesn't believe. That is -- that is of no
25 bearing, and the jury should completely disregard
THE COURT: Sustained. Sustained. The if you get to that question, I would
MR. BRENNER: Thank you, Your Honor.
It is the defendants' position that none
1 it and it is stricken from the record.
4 of Liggett -- that the smoking of Liggett
5 cigarettes, the smoking of Reynolds' cigarettes,
6 the smoking of Philip Morris cigarettes, you know,
7 we don't -- the defense position is that none of
8 those -- none of the smoking caused the disease
9 that Mr. Shulman is claiming.
But I will tell you that there's only
11 two to three years of Marlboro smoking, period.
13 suggest that you can't answer yes for Philip
14 Morris cigarettes because that was the cigarette
15 he claimed he smoked from Philip Morris.
17 with you is -- is damages.
20 early in his closing -- he's actually pretty up
21 front about it. He, at first, said: Look, this
22 is -- essentially what we're here for is to get to
23 punitive damages, but then he said, as far as
24 compensatory damages, he even said: We're not
25 here for the money.
Okay. The last topic I want to cover
If you can go to -- that's good.
Mr. Schlesinger said yesterday very Now I don't know how he got to that
Well, asking for $8 million is a funny
2 way of expressing that. $8 million is a lot of
3 money. Think of it as 80 years of $100,000 a
4 year.
6 number. He just said it. In fact, as Mr. Furr
7 said, he also said $500,000.
I just want to address a couple of the
9 issues of damages, the concrete issues that the
10 plaintiff asked for. One was medical bills.
They had Mr. Shulman on the stand. They
12 put a big binder, remember, and they said: Did we
13 meet with you last night and you went through all
14 these bills and they add up to $393,000? And he
15 said: Yes.
All right. Folks, I can tell you this,
17 the medical bills are going to go back. They're
18 going to be less than that big binder.
20 look at those, and you find what is actually
21 related to -- assuming he had all the diseases
22 he's claiming, you look for the bills that are
23 related to bladder cancer.
You look for the bills that are related
25 to coronary artery disease, and you look for the
And even within those, you look -- you There, I think you'll find none.
You look at those and you find if you
You'll make a determination whether that
1 bills that are related to COPD.
3 Bladder cancer and CAD -- he definitely had CAD in
4 2003, no doubt about it.
6 think it was fair to have Mr. Shulman testify that
7 he went through each of those bills and came up
8 with $393,000.
10 was a fair thing to do by the plaintiffs.
Mr. Shulman had trouble reading a
12 deposition page. He's 94 years old. He had
13 trouble reading a medical record on the screen.
Who thinks he combed through these?
The second thing that Mr. Schlesinger
16 brought up, they said that one of the issues of
17 damages -- and, by the way, I agree with Mr. Furr.
19 find out -- you find -- in all other claims,
20 there's no question that Mr. Shulman, if you find
21 that he bladder cancer caused by an addiction to
22 cigarettes, that he meets all the other
23 requirements.
25 There's no doubt. I'm not saying that, but what
If you find for the plaintiff and you
He definitely has had some damage. They put -- they said that --
You can -- go to the next slide, please.
They said that he was so depressed --
1 I'm addressing is what they put forward as the
2 concrete examples of it.
6 and this was Harvey's testimony, and
7 Mr. Schlesinger put it up. His slide is a lot
8 nicer than mine.
Harvey says that he literally sat in a
10 chair for two years and didn't talk. That's what
11 he says. Bladder surgery in 1995. The man sat in
12 a chair for two years and didn't talk.
14 hopscotching back between Maine and Florida during
15 those times. You'll see that in medical records,
16 but let's just look at one medical record.
Seven weeks after Mr. Shulman's surgery.
18 He has good days and bad days. Of course he does.
19 Of course he does. I am not saying that every day
20 was a great day for Mr. Shulman. But what I'm
21 saying is the evidence doesn't support this claim
22 that he was sitting for two years unable to talk
23 and hopelessly depressed.
25 October 1995, after his surgery -- he's able to
Well, first of all, we know he's
On good days, like yesterday -- this is The second claim plaintiff made through
1 walk two miles on the flat surfaces and is quite
2 active and feels well. He does not have overt
3 signs of depression and he's quite verbal about
4 this.
So, again, there are medical records.
6 They brought the medical record that said he was
7 depressed. No doubt. Both exist, but let's not
8 say that for two years he sat on a chair and
9 didn't speak.
11 Mr. Shulman is that the bike riding claim.
12 Remember that? He couldn't ride a bike. So he
13 said he absolutely could never ride a bike after
14 his surgery.
17 showed him this record and said: Well, it seems
18 odd that you couldn't ride a bike since six years
19 after or seven -- yeah, six years after your
20 bladder cancer you're telling your doctors you're
21 riding 10 to 20 miles a day and you are there for
22 a biking injury. Clearly, you were biking, sir.
And what Mr. Shulman said was that that
24 was -- he actually said he'd tried twice. That
25 was the second time and he fell off and that was
And go to the next record.
And then Mr. Furr, on cross-examination, let's go to the next slide.
So this is two years later. He's biking
1 it. No more biking for Mr. Shulman.
And, again, I -- you know, I am not
3 saying that Mr. Shulman sat on that stand and
4 intentionally told you something that wasn't true.
5 I'm not saying that. I just -- as I said before,
6 I think the medical records that are taken at the
7 time need to be looked at to see what actually
8 happens.
11 and exercising daily.
17 Here's a guy that kept going. He just did. He
18 just did. He should be commended for that.
The next thing that plaintiff told you
20 was that Mr. Shulman absolutely could never fly
21 again because of his surgery.
Let me stop for a second. No doubt the
23 man's passion was flying. No doubt about it. He
24 loved it. He did it his entire life. He -- he
25 passed it on to his son, and I believe his son
Next -- next record.
Again, exercising and biking.
Next record.
Exercising daily and biking.
You're going to see his medical records. 1 testified that he retired as a pilot. Family
2 passion, loved flying.
But it was interesting, Mr. Shulman was
4 very specific about dates on flying, although the
5 suggestion was he stopped flying because of the
6 surgery, Mr. Shulman kept saying: I flew for 68
7 years. I flew for 68 years. I flew for 68 years.
Well, if he flew for 68 years, there's
9 no way he stopped flying in 1995 because he would
10 have been seven when he started. That would mean
11 he started in 1927. Mr. Shulman, a remarkable
12 man, started flying really young. He did not
13 start flying at seven years old.
15 that's true. I don't know if he has his times
16 mixed up. I don't know if he was flying for 68
17 years, but I do know we have a medical record,
18 which we went through with you, that shows that
19 Mr. Shulman, before his surgery, having nothing to
20 do with his bladder cancer surgery, had stopped
21 flying.
That's what he told his doctors, and we
23 got in a whole -- there was -- a very interesting
24 thing happened in this trial. When I pointed out
25 this record that said he was too careless, it was
I don't know if -- I don't know if Mr. Shulman was telling his doctors he
1 as if I was accusing him of being too careless.
2 Nothing could be further from the truth.
4 was too careless to fly. It would not be shocking
5 if a 74-year-old man decided it was time to stop
6 flying airplanes. Would not be shocking.
So I am not saying Mr. Shulman was too
8 careless. Mr. Shulman, to his credit, knew when
9 it was time to stop flying airplanes, but it had
10 nothing to do with his bladder cancer.
As Mr. Schlesinger said, they embrace
12 every word in every medical record, and this is
13 just what the facts are.
16 covered it a little bit and I just want to go
17 through a little bit more of what -- what we're
18 doing here.
20 standard to get regular damages, compensatory
21 damages is preponderance of the evidence, the
22 standard for punitive damages is clear and
23 convincing evidence.
25 explicit, lacking in confusion, and of such weight
Let me go to the one last issue.
This is punitive damages, and Mr. Furr
One, it's a higher standard, whereas the
And the evidence must be precise, so --
THE CLERK: Counsel, 40 minutes.
MR. BRENNER: Thank you.
This whole issue about doubt that we've
1 that it produces a firm belief or conviction
2 without hesitation about the matter at issue.
7 had some argument about during the closings,
8 doubt -- if there's any doubt, you cannot possibly
9 meet the punitive damage standard.
You can't consider the Engle findings.
11 The plaintiff has shown you the Engle findings.
12 They do apply if you find he's a class member to
13 his other claims.
15 his punitive damage claim. So you can throw those
16 findings out. Even if you found he's a class
17 member, you must not consider them at all.
19 trial, and as we pointed out the evidence at
20 trial, the conduct evidence you heard at trial,
21 had nothing to do with Mr. Shulman.
Dr. Proctor's evidence, admittedly, had
23 nothing to do with Mr. Shulman, made no effort to
24 connect the dots.
You can't punish a defendant, any of the
They do not apply, everyone agrees, to
You can only consider the evidence at there's another sentence to that
So I don't know how many times at
MR. HAMMER: Judge, can we approach?

2 other than the plaintiff. And there's another
3 part of that instruction that says you can
4 consider it if that same harm -- if the same
5 product that harmed the plaintiff harmed others,
6 you can consider it on another factor for
7 reprehensibility.
9 instruction, I want you guys to know what's there,
10 but no matter what, you can't punish a defendant
11 for harm suffered by anyone else other than the
12 plaintiff.

16 But what I read into the record --
18 that Mr. Gdanski suggested, and we put it in
19 there: In deciding if punitive damages are
20 warranted, you may not seek to punish the
21 defendant for any harms suffered by any individual
22 other than the plaintiff. However, you may
23 consider evidence of harm to nonparties if the
24 conduct that harmed --
MR. BRENNER: I even -- I even did them
THE COURT: I mean, this was language
MR. SCHLESINGER: But he -- MR. BRENNER: That's what I just said.

MR. BRENNER: Sustained or overruled?
THE COURT: I mean overruled.
MR. BRENNER: Overruled.
(The sidebar discussion was concluded
You may not punish any defendant for any
MR. BRENNER: As I -- you can bring the
No matter how many times the plaintiff -- and Mr. -- and Mr. Furr said that
1 in rebuttal, we probably heard it 50 times in the
2 trial, you can't punish any of these defendants
3 for harms to others.
5 there will be another phase. You've heard about
6 that. And, look, the -- the bottom line for
7 Philip Morris, but I believe this -- not I
8 believe. It's true for all the defendants.
9 Nothing any of these defendants did or didn't do
10 changed Mr. Shulman's actions. He was his own
11 man.
13 on the verdict form, you should check "no" for
14 Philip Morris, Question Number 8.
16 where I started, which is to say thank you, thank
17 you for your attention today, but more importantly
18 just for the whole trial. You guys have been
19 great and we'll anxiously await your verdict.
20 Thank you.


CLOSING STATEMENT
MS. RUIZ: Thank you.
Good late afternoon, everyone. We're
1 talking, then start the clock again.
6 almost there. I've just got a couple of things to
7 comment on this afternoon.
9 going to try not to repeat what others have
10 already told you.
12 attention that you've paid to this case. You've
13 been incredibly patient.
So when this trial began, I told you a
15 little bit about my client. I told you a little
16 bit about Mr. Shulman and his smoking. We're at
17 the end of trial.
Mr. Furr and Mr. Brenner again did an
19 excellent job of explaining to you why plaintiff
20 did not meet his burden against any of these
21 defendants on all of his claims.
23 plaintiff's burden to prove his claims against
24 each defendant. So I need to cover what the
25 evidence was with respect to Liggett.
But please remember that it is what did the evidence show? Nothing
We all have sympathy for Mr. Shulman.
2 He's 95 years old. But that does not mean that
3 Liggett is responsible because Mr. Shulman barely
4 smoked its cigarettes, never as a primary brand.
When you consider the evidence in this
6 case, please use your natural reason and your
7 common sense. You didn't check that at the door
8 when you got here, and I ask that you use that
9 when you evaluate the testimony of the witnesses
10 that came here today.
12 that Liggett did influenced Mr. Shulman's
13 decisions or his behavior. You heard about his
14 smoking.
16 Strikes and Marlboro throughout his life.
He told you he smoked some other brands
18 but when he did smoke those other brands, why did
19 he do it? It was because of price.
He told you that Liggett's Chesterfield
21 and Lark brands -- those are the only two Liggett
22 brands that you heard about from him.
He told you those were never his primary
24 brands. He didn't smoke any cigarettes because of
25 anything Liggett did.
He told you that he smoked mostly Lucky So, as I said, plaintiff has the burden
Plaintiff must prove causation as to
Liggett advertising certainly didn't
2 make Mr. Shulman go out and buy Lucky Strike or
3 Marlboro cigarettes.
5 of proving that Liggett cigarettes caused
6 Mr. Shulman's illness.
8 each defendant -- I can't stress that enough -- by
9 the greater weight of the evidence.
Here's the jury instruction. He
11 basically has to prove that but for smoking
12 Liggett's cigarettes, he would not have gotten
13 sick.
15 his illnesses are smoking-related, but to the
16 extent that you find that they are, Liggett's
17 cigarettes didn't cause them.
Ask yourself when you get back there
19 when you look at the evidence: Did his use of
20 Chesterfield or Lark cigarettes make a difference
21 in Mr. Shulman's outcome?
23 Dr. Soloway, told you the answer is no. I asked
24 him: On your opinion on causation of
25 Mr. Shulman's bladder cancer, would that opinion
Now they all covered why we don't think
One of the plaintiff's own experts, Because Mr. Shulman did not meet his
Beyond that, there is no evidence that
1 change if he had smoked five years less? He
2 agreed. No one came here and told you that
3 Mr. Shulman smoked any amount of Liggett brand
4 cigarettes, let alone five years.
6 burden to prove that Liggett cigarettes caused his
7 illnesses, if you get to Question 3 on the verdict
8 form, the answer for Liggett has to be no.
10 Liggett did or said or failed to do or say
11 anything that affected Mr. Shulman or his smoking
12 decisions in any way.
14 case about the tobacco companies and their
15 conduct, what they did, what they didn't do.
17 Liggett? The evidence showed that Liggett was a
18 responsible tobacco company that took its own
19 path.
21 culminating with the 1964 Surgeon General's
22 report, there was a lot of scientific evidence
23 coming out concerning the risk of cigarette smoke.
25 studies was that Wynder-Graham study. You saw the
You saw evidence that in the 1950s and
You heard a lot of arguments in this

1 Life Magazine that had the coverage of the mouse
2 skin painting studies.
4 information? 1950s, you heard about this from
5 plaintiff's own witness, Dr. Proctor, Liggett did
6 not attend that Plaza Hotel meeting that Dr.
7 Proctor told you was the start of this -- of the
8 agreement to conceal. Liggett didn't have
9 anything to do with the Frank statement. I think
10 they brought a big old board with the Frank
11 statement. When you look at that document,
12 Liggett's name is nowhere on that document.
14 Liggett responded to this new information by
15 taking an independent path.
This is one of plaintiff's exhibits.
17 It's the -- what I call the trip report. It's
18 Plaintiff's 3289. It's authored by British
19 scientists who visited the United States.
21 Liggett felt that the problem was sufficiently
22 serious to justify large-scale investment by the
23 company directly in experimental research on smoke
24 and cancer.
Liggett didn't join the TIRC. Instead,
Here's what they report about Liggett.
They report that Liggett has already Arthur D. Little was a preeminent
Liggett invested enormous resources in a

5 biological testing program with its consultant,
6 Arthur D. Little.
8 scientific consulting firm, and together, Liggett
9 and ADL set out to do two things.
They wanted to replicate the mouse skin
11 painting studies and they wanted to see what, if
12 anything, was causing the problems that were being
13 reported.
15 companies shared their research with the public,
16 ultimately turning over the results of their
17 research to the Surgeon General's committee in
18 April of 1963, before the Surgeon General's report
19 came out.
21 paper that I talked about with Dr. Proctor.
22 That's Liggett's nine-volume submission. It's in
23 evidence, Liggett 231.
There's ten years of research in that
25 document that Liggett turned over to the Surgeon

3 praised Liggett and ADL for the quality of the
4 work and the amount of ground that they covered.
Just a couple of documents. I show you
6 this. This is Liggett's 219. This is the
7 assistant Surgeon General writing to Dr. Kensler
8 at Arthur D. Little: We feel that simple
9 acknowledgement of the receipt of nine volumes

22 Hainer on behalf of the committee for their
23 comprehensive and well-organized presentation as

This is Liggett Exhibit 2398. These are
The chairman thanks Drs. Kensler and 1
2 of Agriculture. This is Liggett 6965, also in
3 evidence.
The chief of the tobacco laboratory to
5 the government said this: The report contains a
6 wealth of information, especially with regard to
7 the biological responses of animal systems to
8 cigarette smoke.
They go on to report: In view of the
10 voluminous amount of material contained in the
11 report, it would be impossible to record here the
12 many findings obtained in the ten-year period of
13 productive collaboration.
15 you -- this is the one document related to Liggett
16 that's in evidence.
18 document that you're going to see back there that
19 has anything to do with Liggett.
21 that there are biologically active materials
22 present in cigarette tobacco that are cancer
23 causing, cancer promoting, poisonous, stimulating,
24 pleasurable, and flavorful.
He told you that Liggett didn't share,
Other than some ads, this is the only
So Dr. Proctor came here. He showed
Here's a memo from the U.S. Department
I invite you to look at Liggett's 1 nine-volume submission. Again, it's 231. There's
2 a lot of information in there. It's over 700
3 pages.
I'm not going to go through all of them
5 today, but I'm going to show you a coup- -- just a
6 couple pages so you get an idea of what's in
7 there.
If you look on Volume I, Page 3, you'll
9 see that Liggett researchers concluded -- and this
10 is what they sent to the Surgeon General's
11 committee -- that there was an association between
12 cigarette smoking and overall death rates. They
13 go on to tell the committee that the effect
14 increases with the amount smoked.
16 committee what it found with regard to filters.
17 Liggett never said that filters were safe.
19 filtered smoke is just as (or almost as)
20 carcinogenic as that from unfiltered smoke.
22 evidence.
Here in Volume III of the submission is
24 a Table of Contents. It lists the materials that
25 have been suggested as possible carcinogens in the
Liggett also told the Surgeon General's
Instead, they said: Condensate from
This is Liggett Exhibit 2398, also in They go on to say that: Nicotine is a
1 human lung. It lists seven items.
Liggett shared the results of its own
3 mouse skin painting studies and showed that they
4 had produced carcinomas.
Nicotine, Liggett also reported about
6 nicotine in the submission. Here they say: The
7 action of nicotine on the central nervous system
8 is complex, and varies with the dose administered.
9 There is little doubt that nicotine is a potent
10 central nervous system stimulant.
12 highly active pharmacologic agent in tobacco. The
13 pleasurable effects of nicotine are the reasons
14 why people smoke tobacco instead of something
15 else. Nicotine is a potent stimulant of various
16 chemoreceptors and one of the most potent central
17 nervous system arousal agents known.
Clearly this information was concealed
19 by Liggett from the public health officials whose
20 job it was to protect the health of the country.
Even with this information, the public
22 health community didn't come out and say that
23 nicotine was addictive until 1988. That's when
24 they changed the definition. We've gone through
25 that. you see, contrary to what Dr. Proctor
Liggett did belong to the Council for
2 told you, Liggett's researchers showed the
3 committee that painting tar on mouse backs caused
4 tumors.
They identified components of cigarette
6 smoke that are poisonous such as arsenic, carbon
7 monoxide. They talked about how nicotine is the
8 reason people smoke and that's it's stimulating,
9 pleasurable and flavorful. Liggett was not hiding
10 the ball.
Now you heard a lot during this trial
12 about various industry organizations. You heard
13 that Liggett was not a member of the Tobacco
14 Industry Research Committee.
16 Tobacco Research from about March 1964 until
17 January 1968.
19 minor player, at best, with insignificant
20 financial contributions.
You heard Liggett's contribution to the
22 CTR was .3 percent. That's less than half of one
23 percent.
So ask yourself, what documents did you
25 see from Liggett directing anybody at any of these
Dr. Proctor told you that Liggett was a please ask yourself when you go back
None.
There's no evidence of Liggett hiding
1 organizations to do anything?
4 the ball. There's no evidence of Liggett keeping
5 secrets, and, again, the only one you're going to
6 see about Liggett in evidence is the document that
7 I just showed you.
9 there: Where is the evidence that Liggett is
10 involved in concealing information? I submit to
11 you that there is none, but, of course, there's a
12 crucial test for evaluating these claims.
14 tobacco company or group, including Liggett, play
15 any role in Mr. Shulman's decisions to start or
16 continue smoking. The short answer is, is that
17 there isn't any evidence that they did.
19 warnings on the packs and they didn't make a
20 difference to Mr. Shulman.
22 nothing would have made a difference. Mr. Shulman
23 never identified anything that he saw from
24 Liggett, and there's nothing that he would have
25 relied upon from Liggett that would have changed
Did any of these statements from any
We know from 1966 on, there were
The overwhelming evidence is that He showed us a large number of ads going
1 his mind about anything.
But despite all of this, Dr. Proctor
3 came here, talked to you about advertising and
4 movies. It's up to you to decide whether
5 Dr. Proctor had his own agenda. He's not a fan of
6 cigarettes. He's an advocate for the abolition of
7 cigarettes. That's his choice, but that is
8 something you get to consider when you're
9 evaluating his testimony.
11 for 70 years. Some were Liggett ads. Some were
12 ads for products that have nothing to do with this
13 case, but none of the Liggett ads made a
14 difference to Mr. Shulman, had anything to do with
15 the facts of this case.
Mr. Shulman told you that to the extent
17 he smoked Liggett cigarettes, it was because they
18 were cheaper, not because of advertising.
19 Obviously, the goal of advertising is to sell a
20 product. Everybody does it. That's not something
21 unique to the tobacco industry. It's not evidence
22 of wrongdoing.
You heard a lot during this case about
24 youth marketing. Remember that Dr. Proctor told
25 you that he had no evidence of Liggett marketing The last thing I want to mention,
They must be based on Liggett's conduct
As you heard, the burden is on plaintiff
Because plaintiff didn't meet his burden
1 to youth, so please remember that when you
2 consider this issue.
4 of proving that he relied on any Liggett
5 statements or omissions or Liggett's participation
6 in any agreement to conceal, we don't think you
7 should get this far, but if you do, the answer for
8 Liggett should certainly be "no."
10 punitive damages, and Mr. Brenner and Mr. Furr
11 touched on it. Punitive damages are intended to
12 punish a defendant for wrongful conduct.
14 and how Liggett's conduct impacted Mr. Shulman.
16 to prove by clear and convincing evidence that
17 he's entitled to punitive damages.
There's no basis for awarding punitive
19 damages here. We don't think you should even get
20 there, but if you do -- and this is my only
21 opportunity to talk to you about this, so I've got
22 to mention it.
24 whether there's -- if there's any evidence of
25 wrongful conduct by Liggett that caused damage to
If you do get there, you need to decide You heard about Liggett's research in
Liggett was the first company to put
1 Mr. Shulman and whether it's necessary to send a
2 message to Liggett or to punish Liggett for the
3 way it's currently doing business.
Based on everything that I've just
5 discussed with you, punitive damages against
6 Liggett are not appropriate.
8 the '50s. Dr. Proctor told you that was an honest
9 response to the mouse skin painting studies.
Even after the warnings were on the
11 packs in the 1960s, Liggett continued to do
12 research.
14 voluntary warnings on its cigarette packs. Today,
15 of course, Liggett is the smallest of the major
16 tobacco companies. It has about two percent of
17 the market. There is no need to punish Liggett.
So I ask, please use your intelligence
19 and your common sense when you're looking at the
20 evidence in this case.
22 is no support for plaintiff's claim for money
23 damages or punishment against Liggett.
Thank you.
