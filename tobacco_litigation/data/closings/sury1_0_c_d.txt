 6            Judge Boyer, Ms. Shamp, Ms. Bryan, Dr. Sury, 7       members of the jury, good morning.
 8            When we first met a few weeks ago over in the
 9       other courthouse, we talked a little bit about jury
10       service, your role as jurors and how important that
11       is to our system.  And one of the things that I
12       mentioned was how much I had enjoyed being on a jury
13       a few times back where I live and how much I hoped
14       that you would enjoy it, too.
15            And let me start by saying a couple things.
16       First, I hope you have enjoyed it.  And, second, I'd
17       like to thank you and all of our group -- we work
18       very hard -- and I'd like to thank you for all of
19       your time, all of your attention and particularly
20       all of your patience.
21            This is the last time I get to talk to you.
22       Ms. Shamp gets to talk to you twice, once as she has
23       already done and then once after Dave Woods and I
24       get to talk to you now.
25            And the reason Ms. Shamp gets to talk to you

 1       twice is really important to keep in mind.  And it
 2       doesn't mean that Judge Boyer likes her more than he
 3       likes Mr. Woods and me.  The reason Ms. Shamp gets
 4       to talk twice is because the plaintiff, her client,
 5       has the burden of proof.  He has the burden of proof
 6       on each and every issue that you're going to decide
 7       in this case.  And I ask that you keep that in mind.
 8       That's why she gets to talk twice.
 9            And the other thing that I think is significant
10       about the fact that Ms. Shamp gets to address you
11       twice, both first and last, is because she will get
12       the opportunity to respond to everything Mr. Woods
13       and I have to say to you.  She gets the opportunity
14       to respond to everything Mr. Woods and I get to show
15       to you.  And so I ask you to keep that in mind.  She
16       gets the last word.
17            Please focus on what she says in response to
18       what Dave and I say and have shown to you.  And in
19       particular, try to focus on what Ms. Shamp does not
20       say in response to what we've said to you, because
21       I'm thinking that on a whole lot of issues she's not
22       going to have much, if anything, to say.
23            Let me talk about this case, the issues you're
24       going to have to decide.  And first let's start with
25       the name of the case.  The name is Sury versus

 1       R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and Lorillard Tobacco
 2       Company.
 3            This case involves Bill Sury.  It involves
 4       nobody else.  It's not about Dr. Proctor's typical
 5       smoker.  It's not about Dr. Goldberg's generic
 6       smoker.  This is not a referendum on cigarettes.
 7       It's not a referendum on the tobacco companies.
 8       It's not a referendum on Dr. Frazier's view that 9       people should not have a choice to buy cigarettes.
10       They have that choice.
11            This case is about Bill Sury.  And I start with
12       that point now the same way I started with my
13       opening statement.  And what I suggested to you then
14       was that the plaintiffs were going to show you a
15       whole lot of things having nothing to do with Bill
16       Sury; they were going to show you hours and hours,
17       days and days of videotaped depositions of our
18       company employees having nothing to do with Bill
19       Sury; that they were going to bring you a number of
20       witnesses, Burns, Proctor, Goldberg, all with
21       opinions having nothing to do with Bill Sury; and
22       that they would show you document after document
23       after document having nothing to do with Bill Sury.
24       And that's what's happened here.
25            I checked my calendar last night.  We started

 1       to present the proof to you, when you actually got
 2       over here and we started to present the proof to
 3       you, on November 3rd.  We went almost two weeks --
 4       two weeks -- until November 16th, Wednesday,
 5       November 16th, before we heard anything from the
 6       plaintiffs about Bill Sury, when they finally called
 7       his son, Robert Sury, to testify about his father.
 8            The plaintiff here didn't bring you much other
 9       information about Bill Sury.  Not one of his
10       friends, virtually nothing about his job, and
11       virtually nothing about his illness.  And that's
12       telling, because all of that is really, really
13       important information in this case.
14            And because all that information is so
15       important in this case, we brought you all of the
16       information we could about Bill Sury and his smoking
17       and his illness and in particular what Bill Sury
18       knew about the risks of smoking.
19            What we know about Bill Sury is he grew up in
20       New Jersey.  He went to a high school, not a prep
21       school.  He started in the mailroom at Prudential
22       Life Insurance Company.  He went in the Army in
23       1941, stationed mostly in Hawaii, and he rose
24       through the ranks.  Important, he rose through the
25       ranks.  He started as a technician third class.  He

 1       rose to become a first lieutenant in the United
 2       States Army.
 3            He was highly decorated.  He returned.  During
 4       the war he got married to Kay, and back to the
 5       Prudential Life Insurance Company after the war.
 6       And once again Bill Sury rose again and again
 7       through the ranks.  He had one or two promotions in
 8       New Jersey, and he be- -- came into the accounting
 9       department and then he got an appointment into the
10       underwriting department. 11            And then he chose to move down here to
12       Jacksonville.  And you heard it.  He moved up and up
13       and up through the ranks.  Dr. Sury said it.  He
14       received a number of promotions within the
15       underwriting department.  He advanced to the
16       position of underwriting consultant.
17            He was in the insurance profession.  He was a
18       professional underwriter.  He had a professional
19       job.  He did not have a low-level job.  How could
20       he, with all those promotions?  He was on a
21       first-name basis with the company president, John
22       Buchanan.
23            Now, we talked about underwriting, and the
24       reason for that is pretty clear.  Because of all the
25       businesses in this economy, it's the life insurance

 1       companies who are going to have the best grasp on
 2       life expectancies.
 3            And why is that?  Well, you heard it from
 4       Dr. Riddel.  The longer somebody lives, the less
 5       they're going to have to pay out.  The shorter
 6       somebody lives, the more they're going to have to
 7       pay out.  It's their business to know about the
 8       risks of smoking and how long people are going to
 9       live.
10            And to demonstrate this rather basic fact, we
11       showed you that just as the first news of this
12       health hazard was breaking, we saw the insurance
13       companies starting to analyze the additional risks
14       of smoking.  They were one of the first, of course.
15       It was their business to know that.
16            And by the '50s we saw in the press, including
17       Newsweek, which Bill Sury read -- he certainly knew
18       about this in his business, but just to show you
19       that he actually -- there was actually something in
20       Newsweek, we showed that to you, too, in 1954,
21       reporting on the plans of the life insurance
22       companies to start charging higher rates for
23       smokers.
24            And the companies only got to that point
25       because they had been researching this issue for a

 1       lot longer before that, long before Bill Sury
 2       brought his son Robert down to his office and showed
 3       him how he would calculate the lower rates he could
 4       charge for non-smokers.
 5            Now, that's a big problem for the plaintiffs in
 6       this case.  And they tried to diminish Dr. Sury's
 7       knowledge of the risks by showing you this chart
 8       here.
 9            Insurance.  Underwriter, not actuary.  Well,
10       first of all, we didn't suggest he was an actuary.
11       An actuary is a person who actually prepares the
12       rates.  We told you Bill Sury was an underwriter, 13       and we told you that when I made my opening
14       statement and when Mr. Woods made his opening
15       statement.  It was Dr. Goldberg who thought he was
16       an actuary.  But it really doesn't matter whether
17       actuary or underwriter; they know the risks.
18            And then she also shows you here that -- in the
19       bullpen.  I think she means bullpen, not an
20       executive.  You know, a lot of executives work in
21       the bullpen.  Yes, he was in the bullpen.  He was an
22       executive.  He rose and rose and rose through the
23       ranks.  I'm not quite sure why they use the bullpen.
24       Maybe to diminish his knowledge.  I don't know.  But
25       the fact of the matter is he calculated the rates.

 1       He calculated the rates.
 2            And then they said Prudential didn't have
 3       differential rates until somewhere -- they didn't
 4       have differential rates.  So what?  Didn't have
 5       differential rates.  Doesn't matter.  It was a
 6       debate within the industry.  And they're not saying
 7       they don't have differential rates now.  They're
 8       saying at some point, according to Dr. Sury's
 9       testimony, they didn't have differential -- I'm not
10       quite sure what that means, the significance of
11       that, not having differential rates, because he told
12       you his dad knew of the -- well, he didn't say that,
13       but he told you that his dad would look to see if
14       somebody was a smoker.  He looked at that.  And he
15       used that factor in calculating the rates that the
16       person applying for insurance would get.
17            And Ms. Shamp just sat down, and before that
18       she used the fact that we were bringing you innuendo
19       to suggest there were differential rates.  We
20       weren't bringing you innuendo.  Brought Dr. Sury to
21       say that they charge less for non-smokers.
22            And remember Dr. Goldberg?  We showed you the
23       1954 document describing the Newsweek article
24       reporting on the fact that the life insurance
25       companies were considering charging lower rates for

 1       non-smokers.  That was not innuendo.  It was the
 2       testimony of Dr. Goldberg and the testimony of --
 3       excuse me -- Dr. Goldberg and Dr. Sury.
 4            If you are in the life insurance industry, you
 5       have a particular knowledge of the risks of smoking.
 6       The facts of this case show that Bill Sury knew the
 7       risks of smoking for a very long time.
 8            He knew it in two ways.  Number one, all the
 9       things we showed you, back to Christopher Columbus,
10       evils of smoking, John Quincy Adams, addictive
11       nature of tobacco, the fact that cigarettes were
12       banned in 14 states in the 1900s, including Florida,
13       to the days of World War II, when cigarettes were
14       referred to as coffin nails. 15            We saw that in the film, Frank Sinatra film,
16       From Here to Eternity, set in Pearl Harbor,
17       ironically set in Pearl Harbor, where Bill Sury
18       served.  Before the Pearl Harbor bombing Frank
19       Sinatra is calling them coffin nails, nails, just as
20       Bill Sury was having his first cigarette.
21            Bill Sury knew that cigarettes were bad for
22       him.  You heard Hal Rush.  Everybody knew.  It was
23       just common knowledge.  Bill Sury knew even more
24       about the risks of smoking than the average
25       American.  Second way, of course, his job.  Even

 1       Dr. Goldberg agreed with that.
 2            Dr. Goldberg admitted that compared to his
 3       generic smoker, Bill Sury would be more sensitive to
 4       the risks of smoking because of his job, and because
 5       of his job the risks of smoking would be more
 6       salient and more vivid to him.
 7            But at this point let me take just a little
 8       time out and reflect a little bit on what's going on
 9       here and what the case is all about.  And let me
10       start with a reality check.
11            Why is it that we spend so much time on this
12       issue of everybody knew?  Why have we taken so much
13       time to prove what appears to be the obvious, the
14       obvious fact that everybody's known for a long time
15       about the risks?  You know, why do we go on and on
16       about this, maybe even boring you with all the
17       information we brought to you on the awareness of
18       the risks?
19            It's because the plaintiffs in this case have
20       come into court trying to avoid this fact, trying to
21       avoid the fact that people have known for a long
22       time that cigarettes were bad for you, trying to
23       deny that Bill Sury knew the risks.
24            You heard Ms. Shamp in her opening statement.
25       She didn't say it today, but I think she said it --

 1       I know she said it in opening statement, that in the
 2       1940s and 1950s it was a different era, she said,
 3       and it was the time when Frank Sinatra was singing.
 4       Remember that?  The time, she said, that nobody knew
 5       that cigarette smoking was dangerous.
 6            Just not so.  The same Frank Sinatra who she
 7       said was singing is also at the same time calling
 8       them nails.
 9            The plaintiff here denies that Bill Sury knew
10       that cigarettes were bad for him back when he
11       started smoking, 1941, and that he remained unaware
12       of the risks or confused until he heard in 1964,
13       supposedly was shocked.  And we'll talk about that.
14       Heard in 1964 from the Surgeon General that
15       cigarettes were harmful; he was shocked.  We'll talk
16       about that. 17            You know, do you really believe that Bill Sury
18       and everybody else did not know that cigarettes were
19       bad for them before the Surgeon General's report?
20            Do you really believe the testimony of the son,
21       Dr. Sury, the two of them were sitting in their
22       chairs in front of the family TV, Dr. Sury being
23       seven years old, by the way, but old enough to
24       remember his dad was shocked.  And, you know,
25       shocked at what news?  He wasn't shocked.  No one

 1       was shocked.
 2            The next day we showed you a lot of newspaper
 3       reports, lots of newspaper reports, on the reaction
 4       to the Surgeon General's Report.  And they said that
 5       the Surgeon General wasn't really telling people
 6       anything they didn't know.
 7            And just to make that clear, can we have
 8       Demonstrative 2, please?
 9            1964.  This was when the Surgeon General's
10       report came out.  Bill Sury was supposedly shocked.
11       The journal of the American Medical Association
12       said, "The health hazards have been well publicized
13       for more than ten years and are common knowledge."
14            Let me focus on that word, "common knowledge."
15       You heard Hal Rush come here into court yesterday,
16       and I asked him, you know, "How old are you" when he
17       started smoking -- or -- yeah, he was a little kid,
18       well before Bill Sury started to smoke.  And I asked
19       him, "Hal, when you were growing up, did you know
20       that cigarettes were harmful, bad for you?"
21            He said, "Yes."
22            And I said, "Well, how do you know?"
23            He said, "Well, it was just common knowledge."
24            And if you asked a historian how they would
25       define "common knowledge," what they would say is

 1       that common knowledge is something that you know but
 2       you don't even know where you heard it from.  It's
 3       just common; in the woodwork, I guess.
 4            And we have spent so much time putting these
 5       graphics up on the board about all of the Reader's
 6       Digest articles going back to the '20s and all of
 7       the statements of the -- in the papers and John
 8       Quincy Adams, Christopher -- all of that.  And why
 9       do we do that?  It's because those are graphic
10       reminders, something that was really happening, and
11       we could put it up on a slide and show it to you to
12       try to prove that.  But the real thing is that it
13       was just common knowledge.  Everybody knew.
14            And now with that, let me turn to the specific
15       questions you'll be asked to answer in this case.
16            And the first is a question -- let me show you
17       the verdict form which you will take back and which
18       Ms. Shamp showed to you. 19            And it has a lot of questions on it.  It has a
20       progression of questions on it, and it starts with
21       the first.  And the first question is -- the
22       question:  "Was William Sury addicted to cigarettes
23       causing [sic] nicotine, and if so, was cigarette
24       smoking because of such addiction a legal cause of
25       his lung cancer?"

 1            And I'm going to get to that in just a minute,
 2       but this is the first question.  And it's a
 3       progression.  If you answer "Yes" to the first
 4       question, you will go on to the others, or to some
 5       of the others, and then you'll go on if you answer
 6       "Yes" to them too.  If you answer "No," which we
 7       think you should, we will be done.  The case will be
 8       over.  We all go home.
 9            And so this first question, "Was William Sury
10       addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine, and, if
11       so, was cigarette smoking because of such addiction
12       a legal cause of his lung cancer?"  That's the
13       question.  It is one big question.  But it has three
14       facets, each of which you should consider.  And on
15       each of these facets the plaintiffs have the burden
16       of proof.
17            So the first facet is, "Was Bill Sury addicted
18       to cigarettes containing nicotine," or in laymen's
19       language, "Was Bill Sury a nicotine addict?"
20            You've heard the evidence on this question.
21       Dr. Frazier, for the plaintiff, says yes, he was; he
22       was addicted.  Dr. Giakas says no.
23            Well, how do they differ?  They both used that
24       same diagnostic test, the DSM-IV, but they disagreed
25       for two different reasons.  I'm going to go through

 1       them right now.
 2            First reason is Dr. Frazier marches through
 3       each of the elements listed for consideration, and
 4       she checked them off.  She checked them off one at a
 5       time, and Ms. Shamp did today, check, check, check,
 6       double-check, and says, "Hey, he was addicted."
 7            Dr. Giakas, though, pointed out something
 8       different and something that Ms. -- Dr. Frazier did
 9       not mention.  Before you get to those, you've got to
10       look at the first issue, which is whether there is
11       an overall loss of control.  Remember that?  We
12       talked a lot about that with Dr. Giakas.  Did Bill
13       Sury have an overall loss of control?  That's what
14       they must show to you.
15            And that's why Ms. Shamp got up and said right
16       in the beginning -- and I wrote it down -- she says,
17       "Nicotine controls the behavior."  Let's think about
18       that.  Nicotine controls the behavior.  That's what
19       she says.  That's what they've got to prove with
20       respect to Bill Sury. 21            And so the question, did Bill Sury ever suffer
22       this loss of control?  There's no evidence that Bill
23       Sury suffered a loss of control.
24            And you also heard from Dr. Giakas that of the
25       millions of former smokers, 50 percent were

 1       addicted, 50 percent not.  So 50 percent of former
 2       smokers, they can quit.  And he told you about that,
 3       and he told you that Bill Sury was not among the
 4       50 percent of smokers who was addicted.
 5            Now, Ms. Shamp put up a slide and it said that
 6       Dr. Giakas didn't know what he was talking about,
 7       said that Dr. Giakas was not credentialed.  Not
 8       credentialed.  I'm not sure what that means.  But
 9       anyway, he's not credentialed.
10            Dr. Giakas has treated 500 to 600 addicted
11       smokers.  How many did Dr. Frazier?  She tried to
12       suggest that she had done it a lot.  You may
13       remember Mr. Latham impeached her right away on
14       that.  She tried to suggest to you it was a lot,
15       remember.
16            One of his first questions was, "Haven't you
17       said repeatedly in the past, Dr. Frazier, that you
18       have just treated a few, a few?"  And she had to
19       admit she's just treated a few addicted smokers.
20            And then there was something else about the
21       1998 Surgeon General's Report he supposedly hadn't
22       read.  Well, he had read it.  She just got confused.
23       He was shown the 2010 one, just came out.  He said
24       he didn't -- hadn't read that, and when he did read
25       it, he didn't agree with certain things in there.

 1            Just because it's a Surgeon General's report,
 2       you don't have to agree with it.  But the fact of
 3       the matter is Dr. Giakas is highly credentialed to
 4       give you the opinion that you heard today, and
 5       that's why we brought him in here, in view of those
 6       credentials.
 7            Now, the second reason Dr. Frazier and
 8       Dr. Giakas disagree, even if there was a loss of
 9       control, then you get to the next part and you go
10       through the tick marks that Ms. Shamp went through.
11            And Dr. Giakas says, "Okay.  Even if you get to
12       that point, I don't think he met the necessary
13       criteria for a diagnosis of a nicotine addict."
14            And so here I want to spend just a little bit
15       of time on this important first question looking at
16       the evidence she relied upon.  Because, remember, an
17       expert can only have an opinion based upon the
18       evidence in the case.  So let's look at what she
19       relied upon.
20            What did she rely upon?  There were very,
21       very -- no medical records before 1994.  No other
22       written records. 23            Did she rely on any observations from anyone
24       who doesn't stand to gain?  Maybe a little bit, I
25       think.  Maybe a little bit from Hal or Yancey.  I

 1       can't remember that.
 2            But what she relied upon, virtually all of the
 3       evidence that she relies on to say that Bill Sury
 4       was addicted comes from Dr. Sury.  And I suggest to
 5       you what Dr. Sury told you about his dad's addiction
 6       was either a little inflated or just maybe wrong.
 7       And let's walk through it.
 8            You heard about the quit attempts.  Water
 9       filters was a big quit attempt.  Remember that,
10       water filters?  Water filter's not a quit attempt.
11       It's just a different way of smoking a cigarette.
12            He gave up cigarettes for Lent.  Lent.  You
13       know, somebody who gives up something for Lent, it
14       means that they're going to start up when Easter
15       comes around.  That's not a serious quit attempt.
16            The other supposed quit attempts before the
17       1980s -- the 1990s, when he apparently went to the
18       patch, what about those quit attempts from 1955 all
19       the way up to 19- -- I don't think there were any.
20       No one else saw him trying to quit.
21            Think of that.  Neither of his friends who
22       played golf with him for almost 20 years ever saw
23       one indication he was trying to quit.  The only
24       person who said he was trying to quit is the
25       plaintiff, Dr. Sury.

 1            And then we get to this statement about how
 2       hard he was trying to quit.  Maybe he wasn't trying
 3       to quit hard or he was finding it hard to quit in
 4       1991 or so when the nicotine patch comes and
 5       Dr. Sury says he used that.
 6            Well, that story Dr. Sury said was a little
 7       hard to keep up with.  Remember, I went through the
 8       depositions with him.  In the first deposition
 9       Dr. Sury says he never prescribed the patch for his
10       dad.  The patch was only available in 1990 -- excuse
11       me -- over the counter later.  In 1991 you had to
12       have a prescription.  He said he never prescribed it
13       for him, never.  He was quite sure of that fact.
14            And then a couple months ago, getting ready for
15       the trial here, testimony changed.  And now he does
16       recall prescribing the patch.  Now he recalls
17       prescribing the patch, but no records.  Once again,
18       no records.  Now he thinks he had his nurse call it
19       in to a pharmacy, but can't remember the name of the
20       pharmacy, so no records from the pharmacy to confirm
21       that.
22            And I'll add to a little lack of clarity here.
23       Now Dr. Sury can't remember if he prescribed the
24       patch ten times or if he prescribed the patch a 25       hundred times.  No idea how many prescriptions.  And

 1       this was his father.
 2            And then we had this issue that Mr. Woods
 3       talked about him with when he cross-examined
 4       Mr. Sury.  And this is really significant, so I'm
 5       going to spend a little time on it.
 6            How did Dr. Frazier get to all those tick marks
 7       that Ms. Shamp showed you?  Well, a lot of it was on
 8       the fact that he had -- Bill Sury supposedly had
 9       these withdrawal symptoms.
10            Remember what she talked about?  Well, he was
11       irritable.  He had anxiety.  He was restless.
12       Insomnia.  Anger.  Anger.
13            Now, where did all those descriptors come from?
14       They came from one person, and that was Bob --
15       Robert Sury.  They didn't come from Hal Rush, they
16       didn't come from Yancey Montgomery, who saw him
17       every week for 20 years, or even from his brother,
18       Dan Sury.
19            The -- these descriptors, these indicia of
20       withdrawal symptoms, came from Dr. Sury.  You heard
21       it.  They came from his Internet research on the
22       descriptors getting ready before his deposition.
23            Now, that, ladies and gentlemen, is pretty much
24       the sum and substance of Dr. Frazier's opinion.  And
25       I don't think there is much substance there.

 1            Nevertheless, Ms. Shamp put up something on the
 2       board in front of you that I want to focus on.  She
 3       said Bill Sury was hooked -- and her word,
 4       "hooked" -- in the military.  That was just not on
 5       their argument, it was not just on misleading
 6       argument, it was inaccurate argument.  He may have
 7       started smoking in the military, but he was not
 8       addicted then or at any time.
 9            Remember something else she put up on the
10       board.  "Smoked 30 years heavily."  Or a pack a day.
11       I'm sorry.  "Pack a day smoker for 30 years."
12            When did the 30 years start?  You saw it up on
13       the board.  According to them, it supposedly started
14       in 1964.  All those numbers Ms. Bryan put up on the
15       board started in 1964.  There is no evidence in this
16       case he was hooked in the military, and there is no
17       evidence that he was hooked or addicted at any time.
18            So I'm done with the first facet on Question 1.
19       Was he addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine?
20       The answer is no.
21            Now let's get to the second facet.  See that
22       word up there?  "Was cigarette smoking because of
23       such addiction a legal cause of his lung cancer?"
24       That goes to the issue was it a legal cause.
25            In other words, assuming Bill Sury was
4563 1       addicted, was addiction a legal cause?  In other
 2       words, did he smoke because of the addiction, his
 3       supposed addiction to nicotine, or rather just
 4       because he wanted to smoke cigarettes, enjoyed
 5       cigarette smoking and wanted to make his own
 6       decision?
 7            And this question addresses Bill Sury's
 8       willpower, his determination, and that's why we
 9       spent so much time on that issue with you.
10            Could he have wanted to quit if he -- could he
11       have quit if he wanted to quit?  Let's look at
12       whether he really did want to quit.
13            Big question.  Did he want to quit?  Who says
14       he wanted to quit?  Again, only Dr. Sury.  Only
15       Dr. Sury.  He says he did not seem to enjoy it, that
16       he just seemed to smoke automatically, whatever that
17       means.
18            He gave no one else the sense that he smoked
19       automatically.  And his friends, smokers themselves,
20       didn't say that.  According to them, Yancey, he
21       appeared to enjoy it.
22            His friends saw no evidence he wanted to quit.
23       Both Hal and Yancey were smokers.  Yancey said he
24       smoked like a train.  Both of them quit.  Both of
25       them told Bill Sury that they had quit and how they

 1       had quit, and that they encouraged him to quit.  But
 2       no -- none of them recall any indication from Bill
 3       Sury that he wanted to quit.
 4            Now, I thought about this, and I thought, well,
 5       maybe it's because his son said he was a private
 6       person.  Maybe -- maybe he just didn't tell people.
 7            Let's think about that.  He plays golf with
 8       these guys all the time.  After they quit,
 9       encouraging him to quit, and he would never once
10       say, "You know, I might try that.  I might try
11       quitting.  I don't like smoking.  I might try
12       quitting"?  Not once.  Think of that.  20 years, and
13       not once an indication that he was thinking of
14       quitting or, by the way, even cutting back.
15            Then secondly on this second facet -- it gets
16       more complicated -- even if he was addicted, could
17       he have quit if he wanted to quit?  Of course he
18       could have quit if he had wanted to quit.  He didn't
19       want to quit.
20            And if he had wanted to quit, he could have
21       quit.  You've heard every expert come into this
22       court, Dr. Burns, Dr. Proctor, Dr. Giakas, even
23       Dr. Frazier.  You heard it from the Surgeon General,
24       the public health authorities.  If you want to quit,
25       you can quit.  60 million people have quit.  There

 1       are more former smokers today than there are current
 2       smokers. 3            And Bill Sury was one of the ones who could
 4       have quit if he had wanted to quit.  He was
 5       successful in everything he set his mind to, in the
 6       Army, in his marriage, in his family, in his
 7       business, and on the golf course.  Even his son
 8       acknowledged that he had been able to accomplish
 9       everything he set his mind to, except maybe not
10       going to college.
11            He was focused.  Bill Sury was determined.  If
12       he wanted to quit smoking, he could have quit
13       smoking.  And when he wanted to quit smoking, he did
14       quit smoking.
15            He wanted to quit -- he did quit smoking --
16       first time he wanted to quit, he got a cough.  It
17       started to affect his health.  A cough.  And that
18       was all the motivation Bill Sury needed to quit.
19            This demonstrates pretty clearly that when Bill
20       Sury was motivated, he was able to quit, despite any
21       addiction.  Addiction was not the legal cause of
22       Bill Sury's illness.  He could have quit.
23            And because of that, those two things, he
24       didn't want to quit, and if he had wanted to, he
25       could have.  They can't satisfy the second prong --

 1       excuse me, the second facet, I should call it,
 2       because I called it a facet before.
 3            Now, to the third, the last facet, and that has
 4       to do with being the legal cause of his lung cancer.
 5       That gets into all the medical proof, all the
 6       medical proof.  What caused his illness?
 7            Now, that's really not my area.  Mr. Latham
 8       talked a lot about that, and Mr. Woods will talk a
 9       lot about that, and how the plaintiff did not carry
10       his burden on this issue.
11            And, as Mr. Woods will tell you, we simply do
12       not have enough information to determine whether
13       smoking was the cause of his illness.  And the
14       reason for that is we don't have the records.
15       They're gone.  Records are gone.  Records are
16       discarded.  Tests weren't done.
17            And that is why we stress that point a lot.  A
18       lot.  And the Judge gave you an instruction on that
19       point.  And I want to make it clear on this thing.
20       We're not saying that Dr. Sury destroyed documents.
21       We're not tak- -- blaming him for the fact that the
22       documents aren't there from Dr. Grochmal or
23       Dr. Marks or Dr. Gaddis.  We're not blaming him.
24            The reason we're making a point of this is to
25       focus on the fact that because the records are gone

 1       and the tests were not done prevents Dr. Sury from
 2       carrying his burden of proof on this third facet of
 3       Question 1, that the cancer was caused by smoking.
 4            So let me come back now that I've gone through 5       all the facets of the first question.
 6            Was Bill Sury addicted -- William Sury addicted
 7       to cigarettes containing nicotine, and, if so, was
 8       cigarette smoking because of such addiction a legal
 9       cause?  One question, three facets.  Got to prove
10       it, all three.  He didn't prove any of them.  Didn't
11       prove he was addicted, didn't prove he couldn't
12       quit, and they did not prove that his death was
13       caused by smoking.  The answer should be "No."
14            And if you answer is "No" on that, and I
15       suggest it should be, then we're done.  But if you
16       don't agree with me, you agree with Ms. Shamp on
17       that, and if you answer "Yes" to Question 1, then we
18       go on.  Then we get to Questions 2 through 5.
19            Those are the Engle finding ones, as Ms. Shamp
20       told you about, findings that the industry was
21       fraudulent, concealed, negligent.  Only if you get
22       to -- past Question 1 do those findings come into
23       play, and now they come into play because we're
24       there and talking about if you answered "Yes" to
25       Question 1.

 1            But as to each one, as the Judge instructed
 2       you, you are going to have to make the decision as
 3       to whether these factors, those Engle finding
 4       factors, were the legal cause of Bill Sury's death.
 5       And this issue, whether these things caused Bill
 6       Sury's death, depends on whether it was the conduct
 7       of the tobacco companies that caused him to smoke,
 8       the things we said and things we didn't say, or
 9       whether, as we have suggested, that Bill Sury would
10       have started smoking and would have continued
11       smoking because he wanted to start to smoke and he
12       wanted to continue to smoke, regardless of anything
13       we did or said or didn't say or didn't do.
14            And as we've shown you and proved to you, I
15       hope, it's been known for decades, it's common
16       knowledge, that cigarettes were harmful.  It has
17       been understood and embraced that they're harmful
18       and dangerous even before the first studies started
19       to appear.
20            I'll go back to this data point again.  I
21       started to show you that.  Reader's Digest article,
22       1924.  Way back when, they knew.  Demonstrative 4.
23            Look at all those articles starting back in
24       1924.  That's what leads to the common knowledge,
25       '24.  Cigarette smoking was dangerous.

 1            Dr. Riddel came here last week to show you the
 2       public opinion polls from way back when, very early
 3       on, well before Bill Sury supposedly was hooked.  By
 4       July of 1954 -- can we have Demonstrative 5?  Let's
 5       look at this Gallup poll -- 90 percent of people
 6       knew or had heard that lung cancer was related to 7       cigarette smoking.  As Dr. Riddel stated, the
 8       awareness was overwhelming.
 9            Now, I want to get to something that we just
10       heard about in Ms. Shamp's closing argument, the
11       Roper polls.  Remember, she put up the Roper poll.
12       And remember, when I opened on this case, we
13       talked -- I talked about right up front the fact
14       that they would give you maybe half the truth but
15       not the whole truth and that they would pull things
16       out of context and wouldn't give you the whole
17       context.  And we saw that when she relied on the
18       Roper poll.  So when she said that, I went and got
19       the Roper poll that she was referring to.
20            Here's what she didn't tell you.  Here's what
21       else the Roper poll says.  And you'll have this back
22       in the jury room.  Don't take my word for it.
23       You'll see it in the jury room.  It's Plaintiff's
24       Exhibit 289.  289.
25            Page 6, over three-quarters of the respondents

 1       think it is at least possibly true that cigarette
 2       smoking is dangerous, with half thinking definitely
 3       or probably true.  This is way back when.
 4            Almost half think that smoking is definitely or
 5       probably a cause of illness.
 6            On specific diseases, the public, by a fairly
 7       large margin, thinks that heart trouble -- not just
 8       cancer -- heart trouble, high blood pressure,
 9       emphysema are more common among smokers than
10       non-smokers.
11            Goes on.  Gets better.  Anti-smoking
12       advertisements and publicity have received
13       widespread attention.
14            Gets better.  Anti-smoking publicity appears to
15       be having some real effects on the smoking public.
16            This, by the way, too, a document from our
17       files.
18            Page 17, almost half of the respondents think
19       it is definitely or probably true that cigarettes
20       are a cause of smokers having more illnesses.
21            And then Page 23.  Here's the results of the
22       poll.  How many people total out of the general
23       public said smoking isn't hazardous?  Please look at
24       this, Page 23 of Exhibit 289.  6 percent for the
25       Roper poll she talked about.

 1            And how many said it was either hazardous --
 2       oh, excuse me -- heavy smoking is hazardous,
 3       47 percent.  Smoking any amount is hazardous,
 4       42 percent.  5 percent didn't know.
 5            What does that amount up to?  It amounts up to
 6       89 percent, almost exactly what George Gallup found,
 7       which was 90 percent.
 8            And the Roper polls go on.  Because, remember, 9       she talked about the campaign of information, the
10       lies, how she went to school and said a four-letter
11       word and really got in trouble, people believed what
12       we were saying.  Well, there's another Roper poll.
13            She showed you the front page of this.  She
14       didn't show you what it said.  And this is
15       Plaintiff's Exhibit 217.
16            And if you go to Page 31, Roper asked, "Hey, if
17       anybody denies and says there's no connection
18       between lung cancer and cigarette smoking, which are
19       you least likely to believe?"
20            Least likely to believe by a factor of ten was
21       the Tobacco Industry Research Council.  How many
22       people would believe the tobacco industry?  In here
23       they said that, 3 percent.  And she wants you to
24       believe that Bill Sury is in the 3 percent.
25            And one of the other things Dr. Riddel said was

 1       that people don't only know it is dangerous; they
 2       think it is more dangerous than it really is.  And
 3       she went through those polls, too, those studies,
 4       one by Viscusi, a guy who had been retained by
 5       the -- or funded at least by the tobacco companies,
 6       and one by Slovic on the other side, plaintiff's
 7       expert.  Found the same thing.  People think it is
 8       twice as harmful as it really is.  The fact of the
 9       matter is people know it's a risky behavior.
10            And the recent studies show that people will
11       choose to smoke regardless of the amount of
12       information that they receive.  Information or lack
13       of information or disinformation has been proven
14       time and time again in real studies and real big
15       studies not to matter.
16            Dr. Riddel talked to you about the commit
17       studies -- do you remember that? -- where they
18       tested whether more information about smoking and
19       better information, more salient information, would
20       make any difference in whether people quit.  Answer?
21       No.
22            Think about that.  The studies show that
23       information on smoking doesn't matter.  Information
24       matters sometimes if people don't know.  But if they
25       do know, information isn't going to matter.

 1            And we talked about -- she talked about that
 2       Hutchinson study, too, that huge thing called the
 3       gold standard sponsored by the National Cancer
 4       Institute, reported on in the National Cancer
 5       Institute journal, 15-year study of the effect of
 6       information and more information and more
 7       information.  And what did it show?  Did it matter?
 8       The answer was no.  No matter how much information
 9       they get, they're going to start to smoke, they're
10       going to continue to smoke. 11            These studies are a shot to the heart of the
12       plaintiff's case, because the plaintiff's case
13       hinged their -- the plaintiffs hinged their claim
14       upon the fact that information put out there by the
15       tobacco companies caused people to start to smoke
16       and continue to smoke.  The fact of the matter is
17       that studies show time and time again it makes no
18       difference.  Doesn't matter.
19            And now let's focus on this for a minute.
20       Dr. Riddel spent some time talking about Hutchinson.
21       She spent time talking about commit.  And then we
22       get a chance -- Ms. Shamp had a chance to
23       cross-examine on those studies to see if she could
24       pull the shot to the heart out of the heart.
25            Nothing.  She asked nothing.  Ms. Shamp asked

 1       nothing about either of those studies.  She asked
 2       nothing about them since they simply devastate this
 3       suggestion, this allegation that we told him
 4       something that he relied upon.  There's no proof of
 5       that.  And in fact the proof is to the contrary.
 6       Nothing would have made a difference.  So she just
 7       ignored them.
 8            Instead, what the plaintiff tries to do is
 9       convince you that Bill Sury smoked because of what
10       the tobacco industry did.  And to do that, they
11       bring you nothing that has to do with studies.  They
12       don't bring you studies.  What they brought you was
13       opinions of Dr. Burns, Dr. Goldberg, Dr. Proctor.
14       Opinions.  They're opinions.  No studies.  We'll get
15       to the studies in a minute, to the extent we already
16       haven't.
17            Bringing these opinions to try to suggest to
18       you that people were deceived and Bill Sury was
19       deceived, would have acted differently as a result.
20       And I want to get to the opinions of those witnesses
21       and to tell you my view of their opinions and to
22       point out the lack of studies that they relied upon,
23       the lack of hard evidence.  But before I do that, I
24       want to spend just a couple minutes talking about
25       witness credibility.

 1            You will have an instruction -- or you do have
 2       an instruction on Page 6 of your instructions.  The
 3       Judge has instructed you -- and I encourage you to
 4       look at that -- given you some little guideposts on
 5       how you might as jurors evaluate the believability
 6       and credibility of the witnesses who have come
 7       before you.
 8            And he's told you, and you have it in your
 9       packet there, look at their -- you should take a
10       look at their demeanor, frankness, their knowledge
11       of facts, the reasonableness of their opinion, their
12       ability to remember whether -- what they have said, 13       to be consistent, and any interest of the witness in
14       the outcome of the case.
15            Let's start with demeanor.  An excellent way, I
16       have always thought, to judge in a court case the
17       credibility of the witness is to evaluate two
18       things.  One, how do they act on direct examination
19       when the person paying them or their client is
20       testifying?  And then see if that demeanor changes
21       in any way during cross-examination.  Are they
22       helpful and cooperative to their own side and then
23       difficult with the cross-examining witness [sic]?
24       Because if so, why are they like that?
25            And the suggestion is if they are like that --

 1       my suggestion to you is if they are like that, they
 2       have something to hide or that they don't like to
 3       discuss.  And that's what we saw.
 4            With Dr. Proctor and Dr. Goldberg, I suggest to
 5       you that on a number of times they tried to evade my
 6       questions and Mr. Woods' questions.  Remember, they
 7       would often try to rephrase the question and they
 8       would give a nonresponsive answer or a non-response.
 9            Remember, I wanted to talk with Dr. Proctor
10       about cigarette filters and how the public health
11       community had for years and years and years
12       encouraged us to put filters on cigarettes so people
13       would die less.  And I wanted to talk about the
14       public health community saying that people had died
15       less because of filters.
16            He did not want to talk about that.  In
17       response to every question I asked, he focused on
18       compensation, which I will get to later, the concept
19       of you puff more.  So maybe it's not as safe.  He
20       didn't want to talk about it.  He didn't want to let
21       me talk about it to inform you about the public
22       health community and what they were saying about
23       soft filters, put them on there.
24            Dr. Goldberg.  I admit I like to talk about
25       studies.  I like to talk about the advertising

 1       studies.  And I wanted to talk about them with
 2       Dr. Goldberg so I could tell you about what they
 3       really show.
 4            But Dr. Goldberg didn't want to talk about the
 5       studies.  He wanted to talk about the consensus
 6       reports.  I'd ask him a question.  He'd say, "No,
 7       the consensus reports say something differently."
 8       I'd ask him a question.  He'd say, "The consensus
 9       reports say something differently."  Finally,
10       remember, I said, "Dr. Goldberg, please.  We'll get
11       to your consensus reports.  Could you just tell me
12       about this study?"
13            How many times did it take Dr. Goldberg to give
14       a definition, a simple definition, of the word 15       "generic"?  He didn't want to give it.  "Please tell
16       me generic."  "Please tell me generic."  "Please
17       tell me" -- "No, I'll give you an example.  I won't
18       give you a definition."
19            It's a word he uses in every case, "generic,"
20       and he won't define it?
21            Contrast the evasiveness of those two witnesses
22       with the candor and forthrightness of Dr. Riddel,
23       Dr. Giakas and Dr. Stonesifer.  If they didn't know
24       something, they'd tell you, "I don't know
25       something."  They would answer the question. That's

 1       demeanor.
 2            Let's talk about reasonableness.  You know,
 3       just because a witness comes in and says something
 4       to you doesn't mean you have to accept it.  Of
 5       course you don't.  You're the finders of fact.
 6       You're the finders of credibility.  Let's look at
 7       the reasonableness.  You get to judge the
 8       reasonableness of these people's opinions.
 9            Filters.  Let's talk about filters and
10       Dr. Proctor.
11            We show Dr. Proctor and you all of the studies
12       by Drs. Doll, Russell, Jarvik, men who were titans
13       in this field.  Richard Doll was knighted by the
14       queen of England for his work on filters.  There's
15       not many people who get knighted.  He did.
16            All of his work showing the benefits of filters
17       and published, as Dr. Proctor admitted, in the most
18       prestigious journals, peer-reviewed journals, in the
19       world that showed that filters, what we were doing
20       with filters and low tar was a good thing.
21            What did Dr. Proctor say about those?  Do you
22       remember?  Every one, he said they were flawed.
23       Doll study, flawed.  Jarvik study, flawed.
24            Was there one study, by the way, he brought in
25       that said these studies were flawed?  No.  He just

 1       said they were flawed.  Is that reasonable?
 2            Dr. Goldberg.  Let's check out the
 3       reasonableness of his opinions.
 4            He told you that cigarette advertising caused
 5       Bill Sury to start to smoke.  Didn't know Bill Sury,
 6       but he said, "I know it caused Bill Sury to smoke.
 7       Everybody is affected, directly or indirectly, by
 8       advertising.  Cigarette advertising caused Bill Sury
 9       to start to smoke.  I know."
10            Okay, Dr. Goldberg.  I asked him whether
11       advertising caused Bill Sury to buy a car.  What did
12       he say?  And I hope you remember it.  I do.  I wrote
13       it down.  He didn't know the answer to that
14       question.  Why?  He didn't know anything about Bill
15       Sury.
16            And what about Dr. G's opinion on alcohol 17       advertising, beer advertising, wine advertising?
18       Well, that's different.  That sort of advertising
19       doesn't cause people to drink.  But cigarette
20       advertising causes people to smoke.  Is that
21       reasonable?
22            Let's look at the frankness, third thing you
23       should consider, frankness of the witness, or lack
24       of frankness.
25            The asterisk.  Remember -- this is a small

 1       point, but remember the last little thing with
 2       Dr. Proctor, the one about the asterisk?  I showed
 3       him, as I was trying to show him all during
 4       cross-examination, about the benefit of filters.
 5       And he didn't like all these things the Surgeon
 6       General said about the benefits of filters because
 7       it undercut his opinion that cigarette filters are
 8       no good.
 9            So then he saw this little asterisk pointing to
10       a footnote in the passage from the Surgeon General's
11       report.  He says, "Aha, there's an asterisk.  The
12       Surgeon General is referring to the problem of
13       compensation."
14            So then after Ms. Bryan finished all her
15       questions, the Judge, I believe, let me ask one
16       more, "Just one more.  I've got one more question."
17            The question was:  "Okay, Dr. Proctor.  Tell me
18       about the asterisk.  Anything there about
19       compensation?"
20            Answer:  "No."
21            Dr. Goldberg, on the issue of frankness.
22       Project 16.  Do you remember Project 16?  I do.  On
23       cross-examination I talked to Dr. Goldberg, and I
24       spent a lot of time on this because it's a very
25       important point, all the steps an advertiser will

 1       take in designing an ad campaign for a target
 2       market.  I wanted to show that there were no
 3       documents in Reynolds' files that there would have
 4       been if we were supposedly targeting youth like he
 5       asserted.
 6            So we went through focus groups.  "Oh, yeah,
 7       there'd be documents about the target market to show
 8       the age of the focus group."
 9            Okay.  Theme testing.  "Oh, yeah, there would
10       be documents in the files showing the age group of
11       the people who were theme tested," which you would
12       do in every advertising campaign, copy test the same
13       thing.
14            Whether it's age group, ethnic group,
15       particularly gender, you will test that group.  You
16       will bring them into a room.  "What do you think of
17       these concepts?  What do you think of these ads?
18       What do you think of these commercials?"  And there 19       are records of who was in that target group.  Of
20       course there are.  And he admitted that.  It's a
21       critical point, because if we were targeting kids,
22       our files would have those things in the documents.
23            And so at the end of all that I asked
24       Dr. Goldberg to acknowledge that if we were
25       targeting youth, those documents would exist, and

 1       that they did not exist.  And then we have an "aha"
 2       moment in the trial.  Remember that?  Dr. Goldberg
 3       says, "Aha."  His "aha" moment in the trial;
 4       Project 16.
 5            "Never heard of it.  What's that?"
 6            He says, "Oh, that's the study on
 7       16-year-olds."
 8            And talk about how he makes things up.  I hope
 9       you remember that.  At first he says, "You know, I
10       don't know if it was Reynolds or not."  That is a
11       quote.  And then he said, "I believe it's Reynolds,"
12       another quote.  And then he got so -- more certain
13       and he said, "It was Reynolds."  Okay.  We go from
14       "don't know" all the way to "I know."
15            Okay.  So then we had a break, and
16       Mr. Richardson, who is a whiz with the computer,
17       went to the Web to find out about this Document 16,
18       Project 16.  And we found it.  Had seen it and found
19       it (phonetic).
20            Who had done Project 16?  It wasn't Reynolds.
21       It wasn't any company even in the United States.  It
22       was Imperial Tobacco, Limited, of Canada.
23            That made no never-mind to Dr. Goldberg.  He
24       just made something else up.  "Okay.  They're a
25       subsidiary.  Imperial is a subsidiary now of

 1       Reynolds."
 2            And I said, "How do you know that?"
 3            And he said, "I'm from Canada."
 4            Dr. Goldberg's penchant to embellish a little
 5       bit should become apparent when I point this out.
 6       You may not have noticed it when the Judge
 7       instructed you on this.  And you'll have it.
 8       Page 18.
 9            The Judge instructed you on who Reynolds is.
10       It's an important point.  Reynolds has acquired some
11       companies over time.  What it acquired is the
12       American Tobacco Company, and it acquired the
13       Brown & Williamson tobacco company.  And he said
14       accordingly RJR Tobacco is liable for American and
15       for Brown & Williamson.  Now so we're liable.  But
16       those are the only two.  You didn't hear a word from
17       the Judge about Imperial.
18            Another factor, witness credibility factor, is
19       the ability of the witness to remember the facts
20       he's already testified to, does he change his 21       testimony.
22            Here again we see that with Dr. Goldberg.
23       Remember that article that I mentioned earlier about
24       the higher rates for smokers in 1954?  He saw this
25       memo.  Ms. Shamp showed it to him, this memo.  It

 1       says, "Hey, Newsweek is talking about these higher
 2       rates for smokers."  And that's what he said in his
 3       direct, higher rates for smokers.
 4            Then we get to cross.  Testimony changed.
 5       Remember that?  Then he said, "Oh, yeah, it says
 6       rate changes.  I think that must have to do with
 7       interest rate calculations or something."  I don't
 8       know what he said.  But, in any event, he just
 9       changed his testimony.  He didn't bat an eyelash.
10            And at the break I looked back and I thought,
11       "Geez, I was sure he said that."  He did say it.
12            And I showed it to him and I said, "Geez, isn't
13       this inconsistent?"  Didn't matter to him.  He
14       just -- "Perhaps."  That's what he said, "Perhaps."
15            And how about the story about the conference
16       that he went to or didn't go to, the learn how to be
17       a witness against the tobacco companies conference?
18       First he said he was in attendance.  Then he said he
19       didn't go.
20            Okay.  He didn't go.  Why?  He had a conflict.
21            Okay.  What was the conflict?  He had a class.
22            Then Mr. Woods got up and said, "Wait a minute.
23       You don't teach on Saturday, do you?"
24            "No."
25            "Well, this conference was held on Saturday,

 1       wasn't it?"
 2            "Oh."  That didn't matter to him, either.  He
 3       goes on.  Remember what he said then?  "I must have
 4       had football tickets."
 5            I hope you looked when it was up on the board
 6       to see when that conference was held.  It was held
 7       in April.  Penn State does not play football in
 8       April.
 9            Knowledge of the facts.  Now, I talked to you
10       about the importance of studies, the importance of
11       hard evidence.  We brought you studies and hard
12       evidence.  The expert's knowledge of the facts is
13       something the Judge has indicated that is important
14       for you to consider, or you should consider or you
15       can consider.  And let's look at the knowledge of
16       the facts.
17            Dr. Proctor, historian on smoking and smoking
18       regulation, had not seen or been provided with
19       thousands of documents from the files of the federal
20       government now available, 24 government agencies
21       that produced those documents, available.
22            Dr. Goldberg had not looked at the seminal 23       studies on the effect of advertising upon smoking
24       and youth smoking.  He had never heard of the
25       principal study cited by the Surgeon General,

 1       Conrad, Flay and Hill.  Never even heard of it.  An
 2       important study, because Conrad, Flay and Hill
 3       showed that kids start smoking for a variety of
 4       reasons, and not once do they mention advertising.
 5            But, you know, that didn't matter to him, by
 6       the way.  He said, "Oh, I see that chart up on the
 7       board" -- I don't know if we have it.  We can take
 8       that down.  But it has all these studies, and you
 9       can see it's in the 1994 Surgeon General's Report,
10       and it shows all the things that cause kids to start
11       smoking, and advertising isn't there.
12            So, again, no never-mind to Dr. Goldberg.  All
13       he says is, "Well, they didn't look at advertising."
14       And then I showed him Conrad, Flay and Hill,
15       Page 1722.  Yes, they have looked at advertising.
16       It was just not a predictor.
17            He hadn't looked at it.  He made things up
18       about it.  He doesn't know the studies.
19            He did not know about the seminal study by the
20       Council of Economic Advisors on advertising and its
21       effect upon smoking rates.  He never -- he hadn't
22       heard of it, and he did not even know who the
23       Council of Economic Advisors was.
24            The fact of the matter is the plaintiffs kept
25       the experts away from a lot of facts that are really

 1       important in this case, people's understanding of
 2       smoking, their understanding of the risks, the fact
 3       about the effects of advertising, the facts about
 4       Bill Sury.  Plaintiffs did not want to disclose any
 5       of that information to their plaintiffs -- to their
 6       experts.
 7            And one other point on this issue of disclosing
 8       facts.  It's a point that rankles me.  It's a point
 9       that maybe might rankle you.  The point is
10       disclosure.  The point is disclosure of bias and
11       conflict of interest.
12            Remember the testimony of Dr. Riddel.  During
13       cross-examination by Ms. Shamp, she pointed out to
14       Dr. Riddel that this Viscusi study that Dr. Riddel
15       told you about had -- hey, it had been funded by my
16       law firm, made a big point of that, and she made a
17       big point of it during her closing argument today.
18            And we heard this other thing about Paula
19       Noble, who works for Mr. Woods' firm, that he had
20       given her or printed out certain things that
21       Dr. Riddel had relied upon, like it's a big deal.
22            There's no secret, by the way, about all of
23       that.  It's been fully known for a long time that my
24       firm funded the Viscusi work. 25            And how is it known?  It's disclosed right in

 1       Viscusi's work.  It's no secret.  The fact of the
 2       matter is the tobacco industry, when they're doing
 3       this stuff, are defendants out there, are fully
 4       disclosing exactly what the funding is.
 5            And with respect to this issue of we gave them
 6       certain things, we didn't give them other things,
 7       no.  We gave Dr. Riddel -- and she testified to
 8       it -- everything in her field of expertise, which is
 9       risk perception.  And they showed her marketing
10       documents, said, "Aha, you didn't look at these."
11       That's not in her area.  We gave her everything in
12       her area.
13            And there's a big difference here, because the
14       plaintiffs have not.  You saw up on the board there
15       when they go to this -- Dr. G goes -- Dr. Goldberg
16       goes to these expert witness schools, anti-tobacco
17       schools.  They had one thing up there called, you
18       know, like this, "Case in a Box" or "Trial in a
19       Box."
20            They go there, the plaintiffs' lawyers go to
21       these things, and somebody comes and says, "Here's
22       how you do a trial.  Here's the witnesses you hire.
23       And, by the way, here are the documents to use."
24       They provide their experts with just the documents
25       that help them, even if they are outside of their

 1       field of expertise.
 2            And you heard the proof here.  It was pretty
 3       clear.  How could Dr. Goldberg not have known about
 4       Conrad, Flay and Hill or the Council of Economic
 5       Advisors?
 6            The tobacco industry has disclosed when we fund
 7       things.  You saw it again in the funding, I believe,
 8       of the Viscusi work, which was -- point at George
 9       Allen, head of The Tobacco Institute, fully
10       disclosed.  The green monster thing that we talked
11       about, fully disclosed.
12            But what about the studies that the plaintiffs
13       rely upon?  Slovic.  Remember, they put up Slovic.
14       Not that it helps them.  They put up Slovic.
15       Slovic, the plaintiff's expert, never discloses the
16       fact he's a plaintiff's expert.
17            Surgeon General's reports we heard so much
18       about.  NCI Monograph 19, the consensus report
19       Dr. Goldberg talked about.  Was there any
20       disclosure -- I tried to make that point -- any
21       disclosure in those reports that the editors,
22       reviewers, contributors, many of them received money
23       from the plaintiffs?  There was no disclosure by
24       them of the fact that they are funding the work that
25       they actually then relied upon.  No disclosure in
4590 1       any of those reports or from Dr. Goldberg or Burns.
 2            Dr. Goldberg and Burns are frequent testifiers
 3       against the industry.  They're both -- Burns is in
 4       the million dollar club.  Goldberg's about there.
 5       These witnesses are out there writing these
 6       consensus reports damning the tobacco industry with
 7       absolutely no disclosure that they were receiving
 8       money to testify against the companies, a practice
 9       that even Dr. Proctor called unethical.
10            And let's take just one deeper little look into
11       the circularity of reasoning we saw in the case.
12            Can we start with a wine cooler on this one,
13       Tammy?  I mean the wine cooler article.
14            Okay.  Let's follow this one.  Dr. Goldberg in
15       1992 writes an article.  He concludes that
16       advertising has no effect upon teenage smoking.
17       "Research in assessing the link between cigarette
18       advertising and teenage smoking has generated
19       equally inconclusive results."
20            In 1992 he looks at the literature, two
21       articles.  He says, "Cigarette advertising has no
22       effect upon cigarette smoking."
23            And then he goes to plaintiffs' witness school.
24       And then Dr. Goldberg gets hired and he starts to
25       get hundreds of thousands of dollars to testify

 1       against the industry.  And then he gets to help
 2       write these consensus reports.
 3            Who asked him to help write the consensus
 4       reports?  Other people who are getting money to
 5       testify against the industry.
 6            And then Dr. Goldberg comes into court to say
 7       and base his opinion upon the things that these guys
 8       just wrote.  And that's why I focus, ladies and
 9       gentlemen, so much upon the studies.
10            And I'll get to that when I get to
11       Dr. Goldberg's opinion, because I'm going to have to
12       stop in just a minute and take a break because the
13       Judge asked me to.
14            I could go on, Your Honor, but I think this is
15       a good time.
16            THE COURT:  Okay.
17            MR. WILLIAMS:  No.  One minute.  I'm not done.
18            THE COURT:  Okay.
19            MR. WILLIAMS:  Goldberg comes into court
20       relying upon these studies done by people who
21       testify against the industry with no disclosure and
22       says they're consensus reports.
23            And that's why I focus on the studies.  I want
24       you to and I'm going to direct you and show you --
25       I'm sorry; I'm not going to direct you -- show you

 1       how you can look at those studies and make your own
 2       conclusion on these issues.  Because Dr. Goldberg 3       didn't look at the studies and he just presented you
 4       with these consensus reports.
 5            And who is it a consensus of?  It's a consensus
 6       of people who are taking money to testify against
 7       the industry with no disclosure of their bias.
 8            Final thing on the credibility of witnesses.
 9       You can look at the thing -- the instruction the
10       Judge gave you.  Do they have -- do these witnesses
11       who come before you have an interest in the outcome
12       of the case?
13            Obviously Dr. Sury does here, but so did
14       Dr. Proctor and Dr. Goldberg and Dr. Burns.  Their
15       testifying represents a huge percentage of their
16       income, a million -- a million dollars almost for
17       two of them, over a million for another, a hundred
18       thousand dollars for Proctor just sitting in that
19       chair there, and $75,000 for Dr. Goldberg, a lot of
20       money they are making to deliver their testimony in
21       a way that helps the plaintiff against the tobacco
22       industry, who these individuals also dislike.
23            I'm going to suggest to you, and then we're
24       going to stop in a minute, and then when I come back
25       I am going to go through their actual opinions.  I'm

 1       going to suggest to you that those opinions are
 2       based upon their dislike of the tobacco companies
 3       and not upon any studies or any accurate
 4       information.  These witnesses will say anything,
 5       most anything, to hurt the tobacco industries even
 6       if it is inaccurate.
 7            Now is a good time, Your Honor.
[#DELETED RECESS#]
13             MR. WILLIAMS:  Thank you, Your Honor.
14             I spent a little time before lunch going
15        through the factors that the judge has suggested to
16        you, you might consider in weighing the credibility
17        and believability of the witnesses that's appeared
18        before you.
19             And I'm going to get to the opinions of those
20        witnesses now and to the testimony of those
21        witnesses now, but I wanted to ask you to hold one
22        thing in mind, I'm going to suggest to you that the
23        witnesses we brought to you, the expert witnesses
24        first, Dr. Giakas and Dr. Stonesifer, and
25        Dr. Riddel, I would suggest, they are honest

 1        people.  They were knowledgeable people.
 2             They were candid with you when they told you
 3        what they knew, and they would acknowledge when
 4        they didn't know something, and they did not
 5        venture outside of their area of expertise.  And
 6        the fact witnesses that we brought to you,
 7        Ms. Montgomery and Hal Rush were equally truthful
 8        and candid, I believe, with you.  But those were
 9        our witnesses.
10             I will leave it to Ms. Shamp to discuss the
11        candor of her witnesses when she gets up again.
12        She did not say much, if anything, about her expert
13        witnesses.  Dr. Goldberg, I didn't hear her mention
14        of.  And Dr. Proctor, maybe she'll try to defend
15        their testimony when she returns to talk to you.
16             But my suggestion is that the credibility of
17        our witnesses were significant and the credibility
18        of their witnesses was not.  And I mention that
19        because the credibility of the witnesses that we
20        bring in front of you speak volumes about the
21        overall credibility of the case that we bring in 22        front of you, and Ms. Shamp does as well.
23             Let me run through the opinions of the expert
24        witnesses that they brought you.  Dr. Proctor came
25        to you at the beginning of the case with four

 1        opinions.
 2             Can we have that?
 3             MS. SHAMP:  What number?
 4             MR. WILLIAMS:  Those are the four opinions.
 5        "By the 1950s, the tobacco industry knew that
 6        cigarettes caused cancer, but choose not to tell
 7        the public."  We addressed that opinion head on.
 8        We showed you through scientific study after
 9        scientific study and we took you through those
10        studies to confront this allegation.
11             And I think perhaps the most telling thing
12        about that, and I try to tee this into what
13        Ms. Shamp wrote on the board the very first day,
14        you can see it over there, this issue of fraud by
15        concealment, talking about concealment of facts
16        that were not otherwise known.
17             And we spent some time with that.  And after
18        some fencing with Dr. Proctor, I think he finally
19        admitted -- I know he finally admitted that he
20        could not point to one scientific fact that was
21        known to the tobacco companies and was unknown to
22        the outside world.  There was no concealment of
23        facts that were not otherwise known.  And he
24        conceded that so many of the facts that the outside
25        world knew had been told to them and published by

 1        the tobacco industry.
 2             And during our statement, we took you through
 3        all the statements of the eminent scientists in
 4        this area all tracking the state of the scientific
 5        literature on smoking and health.
 6             We took you year through year through year
 7        from the early 1950s, when Wynder first did his
 8        mouse painting experiments, up through 1964, and we
 9        showed you that until the early 1960s at the
10        release of that report by the British Royal College
11        of Physicians and then the Surgeon General's
12        Report, that there was an open, back then, an open
13        and very, very candid about the link between
14        smoking and cancer.
15             And even Dr. Proctor conceded that this
16        debate, open and valid debate, lasted into the
17        mid-1950s.  Why do we focus on that and why was
18        that so important?
19             Well, it was important because when
20        Dr. Goldberg got up.  It was important because what
21        Dr. Goldberg was telling you, he was showing you
22        all those things from the files of Hill & Knowlton,
23        the PR firm that had been hired.  He was focusing 24        on those and faulting us for this debate, these
25        issues that we were putting out there, the

 1        statements we were making about cigarettes.  He was
 2        faulting us because we clung to positions that
 3        would later be proven wrong.
 4             But the fact of the matter is at the time
 5        those statements were made, through the mid-1950s,
 6        there was significant doubt, even according to
 7        Dr. Proctor, significant doubt within the
 8        scientific community.  You know, a lot of it.
 9             You know, just like cell phone industry today,
10        you know, there is doubt.  Allegations often get
11        raised about an industry's product, and even
12        Goldberg admitted it was commonplace for industries
13        to defend themselves.  There's nothing wrong with
14        that.
15             Maybe the tobacco industry defended themselves
16        too long.  I do not deny that.  Mr. Woods does not
17        deny it.  The industry does not deny it after 1964,
18        when the Surgeon General's Report came out.  The
19        companies may have held their position too long.
20             But the question is:  Does it really matter in
21        this case so many, many years later?  It doesn't,
22        because after '64, there was widespread
23        understanding and belief that cigarettes were
24        harmful.
25             Again, Mary Riddel showed you the polls.  We

 1        saw the polls from the Roper Organization,
 2        overwhelming majorities of people believed it.  No
 3        one was deceived.  No one started to smoke because
 4        of anything we said or we didn't say.
 5             Ms. Shamp made the point, she points to the
 6        findings and she says, "The findings are the
 7        findings.  The findings say concealment.  They
 8        can't deny the findings," and she's right.  You
 9        cannot deny that concealment if you get to this
10        point.
11             But, by the same token, the plaintiffs can't
12        show that it had any effect on Bill Sury.
13        Bill Sury isn't here so he can't say it didn't have
14        any effect on him, but we can point to other
15        indications that it had no effect on very many
16        people at all.
17             And, again, I go back to the Roper poll where
18        they asked, "Do you believe what the tobacco
19        industry spokesmen are saying?"  How many people?
20        What percent of people believe?  3 percent.
21             They cannot show that any statement had an
22        effect upon Bill Sury.  Ms. Shamp opened with the
23        statement that they -- she said this:  They told
24        him things that he believed.  Well, first, I don't
25        think he believed anything that he might have 4604
 1        heard.  But secondly, there's no evidence in this
 2        case that the industry told Bill Sury anything,
 3        that he saw anything.
 4             They point to this tobacco -- excuse me,
 5        tomato ad put out about tomatoes.  Hundred years
 6        ago tomatoes were poison.  And you heard Dr. Sury
 7        say to you, "My dad and I looked at this together."
 8        And this -- this is their only evidence that
 9        Dr. Sury -- excuse me, Bill Sury saw anything
10        supposedly denying the knowledge.  This is it.  And
11        it's significant, and I raise it because the
12        tobacco industry did not even put this out.  It was
13        put out by the tobacco farmers.
14             Thus they can do, there's no evidence that
15        Bill Sury saw anything that was said by Reynolds,
16        by Lorillard, by the industry, by The Tobacco
17        Institute, Hill & Knowlton.  There's none of it.
18        She tried, but it's not there.
19             And now I'd like to talk about Dr. Proctor's
20        second opinion.  That's the opinion that the
21        tobacco industry has known for decades that
22        nicotine was addictive but chose not to tell the
23        public.
24             Let's talk about addiction because,
25        apparently, the findings address concept of

 1        addiction.  What does that mean?  I want to start
 2        with the word, the term, the phrase, the descriptor
 3        "addicted."  What does that mean?  And was the
 4        industry -- and this is important -- was the
 5        industry trying to hide something about this
 6        concept of addiction?
 7             And that's why we went through the history of
 8        the word.  You heard the evidence.  For years and
 9        decades, the scientific community agreed that
10        nicotine was not addictive.  Surgeon General said
11        that in 1964 and he said it again and again and
12        again.  It was habit, not addictive.
13             And that was because the definition of
14        addiction that everybody was living by for so long
15        was that it had to be intoxicating, and nicotine
16        was not intoxicating.
17             But then what we saw is in the early,
18        mid-1980s, the number of anti-smoking activists,
19        including people who make money testifying against
20        the company, started to push for a new definition.
21             They wanted to drop this intoxicating thing so
22        that nicotine, along with coffee, by the way, would
23        be classified now as addictive.  And why did they
24        want to do that?  Well, let me go to
25        Demonstrative 9, if we could.

 1             You saw the notes of this Seminole conference 2        in 1986 of a government agency, NIDA.  The NIDA,
 3        that's National Institute on Drug Abuse, had a
 4        working meeting where they convened it specifically
 5        to discuss trying to change the definition of
 6        addiction.  And what were their reasons?
 7             This is an exhibit that will be back in the
 8        jury room with you.  I encourage you to look at it
 9        if you have any questions about this issue of
10        addiction.
11             They wanted to change it, and they say it
12        right here:  "It is because policymakers do not
13        base their decisions on reason, rationality and the
14        weight of the evidence.  We should use the word
15        'addiction' for its visceral effect on the public
16        and the pressure on lawmakers that will result."
17             They wanted to change it -- this suggests --
18        not for any scientific reason, but for the visceral
19        effect on the public and to put pressures on
20        lawmakers, anti-tobacco pressure on lawmakers.
21             And why?  Because if they got cigarettes
22        classified as addictive, maybe they could get the
23        government to ban cigarettes, which is what they
24        wanted to do.
25             And they also wanted the word changed for

 1        another reason.  It has a lot of resonance here, I
 2        suggest, in these tobacco trials.  They wanted to
 3        use this, quote, emotion-laden word because it
 4        forces the nonsmoking public to have more
 5        compassion for smokers and to invest in their
 6        treatment.
 7             They wanted to do it to turn these people
 8        addicted, addicted, for sympathy reasons.  And in
 9        part, I think sympathy for the plaintiffs in court.
10        That's why we have the word "addictive" now linked
11        to cigarettes.
12             And even Dr. Proctor acknowledged here that
13        this change was motivated, at least in part, by
14        political reasons.  And so then the Surgeon General
15        two years later changes the definition.
16             We say the Surgeon General changed the
17        definition, and that's right.  In the 1988 report,
18        the Surgeon General says nicotine is addictive.
19        But if you got one of those Surgeon General reports
20        back there, look to see if it's just his report,
21        and if not, just who else's report it is.  Because
22        there is testimony on this from Dr. Proctor.
23             That report shows clearly that the senior
24        scientific editor was a man named Neal Benowitz, an
25        individual who makes a lot of money testifying

 1        against the industry.
 2             In any event, Dr. Benowitz, working through
 3        the Surgeon General and the other people who went 4        to this political conference, got the definition
 5        changed and now, voila, nicotine is now an
 6        addictive substance.
 7             And I make that point for another reason too,
 8        because when our chief executive officers were
 9        subpoenaed to come up to Capital Hill in 1994, they
10        were brought up there to ask about addiction
11        because they continued to say, "We do not believe
12        in this new definition.  We do not believe that our
13        products should properly be classified as
14        addictive."
15             And you saw them.  They all got up on the
16        stand.  They're sworn.  There's pictures of them
17        broadcast all over the world.  And they are asked,
18        each one of them:  Do you believe nicotine is
19        addictive?  And they said no.  And they were
20        pilloried by that, for that.
21             And Ms. Shamp showed you the video clip
22        showing them that they -- and suggesting that they
23        were not telling the truth.  And even Dr. Sury got
24        up and made the additional comment.  I'm not sure
25        why, but he made the additional comment that his

 1        father was mad because these tobacco company
 2        executives were, quote, in Dr. Sury's words, lying
 3        under oath.
 4             Well, they didn't show you the rest of those
 5        video clips.  They didn't show you when our chief
 6        executive officers got up there in the beginning
 7        and went through precisely why they did not think
 8        it was addictive.
 9             They weren't taking issue with some
10        established scientific fact.  They were simply
11        pointing out that they disagreed with this rather
12        political change in the definition.
13             We showed you the full video of our president,
14        Jim Johnson, testifying why he thought that this
15        was an ill-advised change.  And Lorillard's
16        president and each of the other presidents said
17        exactly the same thing.  They said why.  They
18        didn't agree with the new definition.  You know
19        what, at that time, the World Health Organization
20        didn't agree with it either.
21             We're basing our position up there on the
22        established definition and one that was still
23        recognized around the world.  What we were doing
24        was taking issue with the politicized new
25        definition.

 1             And then with respect to the rest of the
 2        opinion that Dr. Proctor brought you that we chose
 3        not to tell the public that cigarettes were
 4        addictive, nicotine was addictive, there's no
 5        evidence that the public did not know. 6             And we've gone back and showed you all of
 7        that, from John Quincy Adams up through Lady
 8        Nicotine, a Tex Williams' song about smoking the
 9        cigarette and "I'll kill the son of a gun that got
10        me hooked in the first degree."  People had known
11        that.  There was nothing there hidden.  People knew
12        it.  This whole issue about addiction is a
13        political issue to try to create sympathy.
14             Third opinion, Dr. Proctor.  Dr. Proctor says
15        that cigarettes are no less harmful than -- excuse
16        me, filtered cigarettes are no less harmful than
17        unfiltered, that we just didn't tell the public.
18        We chose -- we knew they were less harmful.  We
19        choose not to tell the public.
20             Well, what's wrong with that one?  We disagree
21        with the entirety of the proposition.  We told you
22        why:  Filtered cigarettes are less harmful.  Just
23        think about it.  How can they not be less harmful
24        when you put a filter on the tip of an unfiltered
25        cigarettes?

 1             It's not just us telling you that.  It's every
 2        scientist we brought to you through the articles.
 3        All of the scientists, Doll and Russell and all of
 4        that, every one of them agreed that filtered
 5        cigarettes were less harmful, low-tar cigarettes
 6        were less harmful and saved lives.
 7             The Surgeon General said, "They're less
 8        harmful.  They save lives."  All the scientists.
 9        It's only -- who disagrees with that?  Did you see
10        one study disagreeing with that?  From Burns?
11        Proctor?  No.  Goldberg?  They disagreed, but they
12        did not, again, present you with one study.  It's
13        just their opinion.
14             All they would say is that, "Well, the studies
15        are flawed because people take harder hits, and
16        when the people did these flawed studies, they
17        didn't know about compensation."
18             And so, once again, we had to bring you the
19        snippets, the chapters, whatever, in the work of
20        NAH, Russell and Doll and Jarvik that talk about
21        their understanding that there was this
22        compensation.
23             People might smoke a little harder on a
24        filtered cigarette or a low-tar cigarette or have
25        more of them, but that it's still safer.  Even

 1        despite the fact they do that, the studies show
 2        they're still safer.
 3             Dr. Proctor, you don't want to talk about
 4        compensation all the time, and he said they knew
 5        more about it than the scientific community, and
 6        there's no evidence of that.  He presented you
 7        none. 8             And by the way, this has nothing to do, once
 9        again, with Bill Sury.  There's no evidence that
10        Bill Sury ever compensated.
11             And now, let me get you to Dr. Proctor's last
12        opinion.  Still, by the way, having nothing to do
13        with Bill Sury, and I remind you that I wrote this
14        up here -- well, can we go to the ELMO, please,
15        because I'm working off a different one.
16             All of these opinions I've asked them do any
17        of these opinions have anything to do with this
18        case, with Bill Sury at least, and the answer was
19        no, no, no and no, none of it.
20             But here's the last opinion.  It's the most
21        interesting one, I think, in terms of Dr. Proctor:
22        Smoke and mirrors worked.  Again, no evidence that
23        a single person started to smoke because of any of
24        this supposed smoke and mirrors.
25             And the best proof on this came from

 1        Dr. Proctor himself.  Remember, I asked him about
 2        studies, once again, studies.  One study, one
 3        peer-reviewed study that shows that smoke and
 4        mirrors worked.
 5             And I wrote this on the board.  I didn't write
 6        it with a big enough magic marker.  I apologize.
 7        But I'll read it to you now.  Dr. Proctor says no
 8        peer-reviewed study publication concluded that any
 9        statement of the tobacco industry influenced
10        anyone's belief whether cigarettes are dangerous.
11        I wrote that on the board.  He said, "That's
12        right."
13             Number two, No study showing any tobacco
14        industry statement influenced anyone's decision to
15        smoke.  I wrote that on the board.  He said,
16        "That's right too.  I can't think of one."  No
17        study that any ad campaign influenced anyone's
18        decision to smoke.  He said, "That's right.  I
19        can't think of one."
20             As I was walking away, he said, "By the way,
21        oh, I'm sure I think there might be one."  You
22        think for a minute that if he knew of one he
23        wouldn't have presented you with it?  Of course
24        not.  He's been asked this.  He was asked this six
25        months ago, "Can you remember any study?"  No.

 1             And you don't think he would have looked for
 2        one?  He comes in here six months later, again
 3        Dr. Proctor, any statement, any study?  "I can't
 4        think of one.  There is none.  No studies."
 5             Nobody was mislead.  Nobody was deceived.  The
 6        word has been out there since the 1950s.  Yes,
 7        Ms. Shamp is right, we put the thing on the board.
 8        You can -- Dr. Horn, "You know, you can shout it
 9        from the rooftops.  Nobody else will hear.  Nobody 10        will get any additional information."
11             It's not just Dr. Horn.  How about Dr. Heller.
12        Can we go to him?
13             1957, seven years before the Surgeon General's
14        Report:  "Newspapers, radio, TV have done an
15        excellent job covering this problem, and an
16        objective job.  It's an exceedingly valuable way of
17        informing the public."
18             Now, in my opening statement -- maybe we can
19        go back to the ELMO -- I took you through -- I had
20        my own slide on Dr. Proctor's testimony, and I put
21        it up on the board and I'll show it to you again.
22             Three holes in his testimony.  First, smokers
23        were not deceived about the real hazards of
24        cigarettes.  We proved that.  Second -- not even
25        our burden to prove it, we proved it.

 1             Second, smokers did not start to smoke or
 2        continue to smoke because of anything that the
 3        tobacco companies said or did.  Again, not our
 4        burden to prove the negative, by the way, but I
 5        think we proved it.  Not our burden to prove the
 6        first one, the negative, but I think we proved it.
 7        And they certainly didn't come close to disproving
 8        that.
 9             Third, Bill Sury was not deceived.  He knew
10        the risks of smoking.  I think we've proved that
11        too.
12             Have the plaintiffs presented you any
13        information to suggest that Bill Sury was somehow
14        deceived, particularly given his job?  No evidence
15        he was deceived, just like there's -- just like
16        Hal Rush who told it like it is.  Since he was a
17        boy, he knew that smoking was dangerous.  It's
18        common sense.
19             And particularly with Bill Sury, because even
20        as much as the public knew, he knew more.  He knew
21        precisely the risks.  He saw it every day.  He
22        worked with it.  Given his background as an
23        underwriter, the health risks, as Dr. Goldberg
24        said, would be more salient and certainly more
25        vivid.

 1             Even Dr. Proctor could not deny this.  Even
 2        Dr. Proctor's response to my question said, well,
 3        he admitted, as he had to, that despite his
 4        opinion, he did have to acknowledge that some
 5        people were aware of the risks and were not
 6        deceived.  And if anyone was aware, it was
 7        Bill Sury.
 8             Dr. Burns, Dr. Burns was the expert that came
 9        to you on videotape.  He talked about a lot of his
10        credentials on direct examination.  And on
11        cross-examination you learned one of his 12        credentials was testifying against the tobacco
13        industries over and over and over.
14             He on cross -- on direct tried to paint this
15        picture of deceit and obstruction beginning back
16        with the Plaza Hotel.  Remember that?  The Plaza
17        Hotel, the Frank Statement.  There's nothing secret
18        about this, nothing.
19             The Government was invited to attend.  It was
20        reported in the New York Times.  The Frank
21        Statement, nobody heard that, nobody saw that, and
22        there's no evidence that Bill Sury saw it.  It ran
23        one day.
24             On direct examination, Dr. Burns was quite
25        critical of a lot of the research that was

 1        sponsored by us, by CTR and TIRC.  It wasn't until
 2        cross-examination that we had to bring out the
 3        point that that research was done by many
 4        distinguished scientists, top universities,
 5        co-funded, by the way, with the National Cancer
 6        Institute, published in many peer-reviewed
 7        journals.  And even the findings that were hurtful
 8        to us back then were published.  And this research
 9        was cited in many, many Surgeon General's Reports.
10             Dr. Burns talked about the vital information
11        about smoking and health being concealed, but it
12        wasn't until cross-examination that he acknowledged
13        that more people know that smoking causes disease
14        than know the name of the president of the
15        United States.  And that notwithstanding anybody's
16        addiction, smokers can quit and they're reasonable
17        for their own behavior.
18             Dr. Goldberg, his opinions.  Let me start with
19        the obvious here.  Dr. Goldberg came and talked to
20        you about advertising.  I'll get there in a minute
21        as to why Dr. Goldberg came, but let me start by
22        saying, no evidence that Bill Sury started to smoke
23        because of advertising.  We'll go through his
24        opinions any ways, but let me start with that.
25             You know, we talked a lot about his wine

 1        cooler article and how he had this transformation
 2        once he started to get paid.  And now he thinks
 3        that cigarette advertising causes people to smoke.
 4        And not just some people, all people are influenced
 5        directly or indirectly by advertising, according to
 6        Dr. Goldberg.
 7             Dr. Goldberg did not like my insinuation when
 8        I suggested that going to plaintiff's witness
 9        school and getting paid might have had something to
10        do with the change in his opinion.
11             And so he told us, "Well, you know, I wrote
12        that article back in '92 and that was before '94,
13        and in '94 it was still sort of on the fence." 14        Remember, he said that the Surgeon General wasn't
15        quite sure, looked like maybe, maybe not, maybe,
16        maybe, maybe not advertising caused people to start
17        to smoke.
18             But then he said, "But the '94 report, of
19        course, was before all these other studies came
20        out, and now it is crystal clear, everybody agrees,
21        everybody."
22             Well, once again, Dr. Goldberg, I suggest,
23        doesn't really know the studies because he said all
24        these studies were laid out in the Monograph 19
25        that he wrote.  I think he wrote it, but I don't

 1        think he read the studies if he said that now it is
 2        clear when it wasn't in 1994.
 3             Can we go to Demonstrative 13?  Can you
 4        highlight where we can highlight there?
 5             These are the studies he talked about.  You'll
 6        have Monograph 19 back in the jury room, if you
 7        want to look at it.  And what this shows are all
 8        the studies of tobacco advertising and consumption
 9        as of 2008.
10             And you can go through these, these before '94
11        and after.  And I've highlighted the ones that are
12        after.  And the unhighlighted ones are before.  And
13        you can see over in the right-hand column the major
14        conclusions.  It will say, for example, up here,
15        the Hamilton study, no effect of advertising.
16        Schmalensee, no effect.  McGinnis, small positive.
17        Grabowski no effect.  Schneider, no effect.  And
18        then a small positive.  And then it goes on and on
19        and on.
20             You can do the math.  You count up the number
21        of studies that show no effect as opposed to
22        positive effect before 1994, you will see that it
23        was inclusive before 1994.  And then if you do the
24        next part of that exercise with respect to after
25        '94, you'll see the same thing, half and half.

 1             The fact of the matter is that the studies
 2        were inclusive before '94 and they are still
 3        inconclusive.  And I think that just shows that
 4        Dr. Goldberg hasn't looked at those studies.
 5             He cannot cite you to one study.  All he can
 6        tell you is the conclusions of the authors of
 7        Monograph 19 for people who testified for the
 8        plaintiff.
 9             He'd never heard of Conrad, Flay & Hill.  He'd
10        never heard of CEA, Council of Economic Advisers.
11        He had no interest -- remember, I kept asking him,
12        all these reports by the economists, the Federal
13        Trade Commission who study this day in and day out.
14        FTC regulates advertising in this country, and
15        they've looked a lot at cigarette advertising just 16        to see if it has an effect.  Their conclusions he
17        didn't even bother to look at.  And in fact, he
18        says, "I don't have any interest in looking at
19        those conclusions."
20             And in this regard, let me come back one last
21        time to Monograph 19.  There's a study here that is
22        actually talked about in the text of Monograph 19.
23        It's this one down here called Andrews and Frank,
24        91.  And Andrews and Frank actually does find a
25        positive effect.

 1             What is that positive effect?  Is the effect
 2        of advertising so strong that, like Dr. Goldberg
 3        said, everybody is starting smoke?  No.  The effect
 4        is very small, 6 percent.  6 percent, that most
 5        advertising had a 6 percent effect.
 6             And the question was:  Was Bill Sury part of
 7        that 6 percent?  Of course he wasn't.  I don't
 8        think Bill Sury was affected by advertising.
 9        There's no evidence in this case that he started to
10        smoke or continued to smoke because of advertising.
11             So here's the question:  If advertising has no
12        effect on people starting to smoke or it doesn't
13        have much of an effect -- because even all those
14        studies will show, most are inclusive.  Some show a
15        little -- why do companies advertise?
16             And here we discuss this, I hope it's no
17        surprise, why are they advertising for brand share?
18        Keep their smokers loyal and to attract switchers.
19        People are using some other brand, want to make
20        them use your brand.  Every company does that.  Car
21        companies, toothpaste companies, everybody.
22             People don't start to brush their teeth.  They
23        don't start to buy gasoline when they wouldn't have
24        bought gasoline because of advertising.  They
25        choose Exxon or they choose the Citgo down the

 1        street because of advertising.
 2             Brand choice was the only effect that it
 3        had -- excuse me, that advertising had upon
 4        Bill Sury.  And we saw that here.  He switched to
 5        Tarrington for a short period of time because he
 6        liked the ads, the I'd-rather-fight-than-switch
 7        ads.
 8             And then we saw that he was smoking some other
 9        brand, and he switched to Raleighs in order to get
10        the coupons to get his son a clock.
11             Dr. Goldberg had some other statistic to try
12        to suggest to you that we were advertising for
13        reasons unrelated to brand share.  His numbers just
14        didn't add up.
15             The fact of the matter is that Dr. Goldberg is
16        somewhat out of touch with the way advertising
17        affects people.  He thinks that it is this great 18        powerful force that causes people to buy things
19        that they would otherwise not want to buy.
20             And I think we heard why he thinks that.  He
21        thinks that smokers start to smoke because
22        smokers -- all smokers, he thinks, are dumber than
23        pidgeons.
24             Well, you know, all this talk about
25        advertising and grand share and these advertising

 1        studies, it's sort of interesting, at least for me.
 2        But what does any of this advertising issues have
 3        to do with Bill Sury?  Nothing.  Absolutely
 4        nothing.  Squadoosh.  It doesn't have a thing to do
 5        because there's no evidence that Bill Sury started
 6        to smoke because of advertising or continued to
 7        smoke.
 8             In my opening statement, once again, I tried
 9        to forecast what I was going to try to show you
10        about all of the testimony we heard from, from
11        Dr. Goldberg.
12             And here's what I put on the board:  First,
13        tobacco company advertising is not unique.  We
14        spent hours listening to Dr. Goldberg go through
15        all our ads and say, "Oh, gosh, they're suggesting
16        people give cigarettes for Christmas.  Oh, they're
17        suggesting fun.  Oh, they're suggesting refreshing.
18        Oh, they're using sports figures.  Oh, oh, oh."
19             What was the point of that?  What's the point
20        of that?  He admitted, tobacco company advertising
21        is not unique, all companies use the same type of
22        techniques.  And then I said, "You know, I'm going
23        to show you that the reason companies advertise is
24        for brand share," and I think we showed that to
25        you.

 1             And number three, Bill Sury did not start to
 2        smoke because of advertising.  And, again, we've
 3        been sitting here for almost three weeks, not one
 4        suggestion that Bill Sury started to smoke because
 5        of advertising.
 6             He might have bought a pack of Tarringtons.
 7        He might have switched to Raleighs because of
 8        advertising, but that was a switch.  He didn't
 9        start to smoke.  He didn't not quit because of
10        advertising.
11             So why did Dr. Goldberg come?  He came here
12        for one reason, because he had another part of his
13        testimony here.  He came here to try to make you
14        mad.
15             And how did he try to do it?  He tried to
16        convince you that our companies were out there and
17        are out there targeting youth.  That is an
18        incendiary allegation.  It strikes at everybody's
19        heart.  We shouldn't be doing that and Dr. Goldberg 20        comes in to say we are doing it.
21             How did he try to do that?  He tried to do
22        that by showing you a bunch of documents from the
23        files of the companies that he says show youth
24        marketing, or youth targeting.
25             Actually, it wasn't a bunch of documents.  It

 1        was seven, seven documents from a 90-year period.
 2        He ignores all the other types of documents I was
 3        talking about.  He ignores all the other documents
 4        in our files.  Seven documents.
 5             And then he goes on from those seven to take
 6        them remarkably out of context.  Let me start with
 7        Diane Burrows.  This is the Diane Burrows report.
 8        He says it shows Reynolds was targeting kids.
 9             How does he do it?  He points to one appendix
10        way at the back and up at the top it says, "Youth
11        adult market," or something like that.  And then
12        underneath it in the appendix it has some
13        government data showing age ranges 12 all the way
14        to 25 and up, and because it said "youth market" or
15        "youth, young adult" at the top, he says, "That's
16        how they defined it."
17             I took him through reference after reference
18        after reference.  I hope you remember that.  Kept
19        going through them.  Diane Burrows, right in the
20        introduction, what does she say?  Young adult
21        market.  How does she define it?  18 to 24.  "Oh,
22        yeah, that's where she defines it there."  We went
23        to the next page.  "Oh, yeah, that's how she
24        defines it there."  We went all the way up through
25        it.

 1             We got about eight, nine references and he
 2        says, "Oh, you haven't been doing the other part of
 3        it.  You haven't been saying" -- "you've missed all
 4        these things."  And remember this?  I said, "Okay,"
 5        because I know it doesn't say.  I said, "Okay.  Go
 6        back, Dr. Goldberg.  You tell me where it says it
 7        defines it."
 8             And he read something that was totally
 9        irrelevant, and he was instructed to answer the
10        question by the judge and he finally had to admit
11        she doesn't say it.  She doesn't say it.  She's
12        talking about 18 to 24, which is an adult market.
13             How about this school days memo, 1927?  One
14        reference, he says, prep schools.  Which, of
15        course, he said prep school and of course that
16        means it goes all the way down to middle school.  I
17        don't know where he gets that.
18             But in any event, he ignored everything else
19        in that document.  He ignored the direction to --
20        marketing to who?  Men and women.  He ignored the
21        fact that they should just be marketing to smokers. 22        He ignored the fact that they should just be trying
23        to market to smokers who are smoking smokes of
24        other companies.  He ignored all that.
25             Claude Teague, we heard a lot about

 1        Claude Teague, didn't we?  He told you a lot about
 2        Claude Teague.  Here's what Claude Teague says in
 3        his 1973 draft memo:  "We should not in any way
 4        influence nonsmokers to start smoking."  And then
 5        he talks about young adults as being 21.
 6        Dr. Goldberg ignored that.
 7             That Tatham Laird document, Demonstrative 15.
 8        They're talking about a new brand.  The brand could
 9        not be positioned against youth.  There is
10        reference after reference after reference in our
11        files saying the same thing, all of which he
12        ignores.  He ignores those references, even in the
13        same documents he cites.
14             And now we get to the other document,
15        Hilton Head, where it does say 14 to 24.  It does.
16        But you know what, Dr. Goldberg hadn't done his
17        research on that one either because what were the
18        four campaigns that we were talking about in there?
19        What were the campaigns that were discussed there?
20        In other words, what were we intending to do?  What
21        did we do?  Proof's in the pudding.
22             Can we look at the next demonstrative.
23             Four of these, the Winston Candid Campaign.
24        That's not youth marketing.  There's nobody there
25        under the age of 30.  Look at this guy up here

 1        (indicating), you know, he looks about 50.
 2        Dr. Goldberg thought he was 30.  But in any event,
 3        nobody under 30.  And he couldn't say that that ad
 4        had any particular appeal to kids.
 5             And the next one, refresh, he said no
 6        particular appeal to kids.  He said, "Oh, kids
 7        would like to swim."  But so would adults too.  No
 8        particular appeal.
 9             Went to the next one; denim.  Now, here, he
10        did say -- at first he said, "Well, I don't think
11        there's any particular appeal to denim."  Then he
12        said, "Well, you know, maybe kids like blue jeans
13        better than adults."  Well, come on.  There's no
14        proof of that.  There's no proof this is targeting
15        kids.
16             And finally, the last one there, we have the
17        Meet the Turk.  This guy, I think he said he was,
18        you know, 30, 35, and he could not find one thing
19        in that ad that had a particular appeal to youth.
20        Those ads are not targeted to youth.
21             And let me ask you just one more thing about
22        youth marketing:  What does it have to do with
23        Bill Sury?  Bill Sury did not start to smoke before 24        he was 18.  No evidence he started smoking because
25        of advertising.  No evidence he started to smoke

 1        because of kid.
 2             The only reason he came here, Dr. Goldberg
 3        came here, once again, is to try to get you mad
 4        because of this youth marketing issue, and it just
 5        has no applicability here, or anywhere.
 6             I want to put two numbers up on the board.
 7        And the numbers are six out of 100 -- I'm not
 8        having good luck up here.
 9             Six out of 100.  I was going to put 10 out of
10        100 because of the polls, but -- because of this
11        Roper poll that they showed, I'll use another
12        number which was in that Roper poll, 11 out of a
13        100.  6 percent and 11 percent.  And the reason I
14        put those there is because of the 6 percent effect
15        that advertising might have and the 11 percent of
16        people who did not recognize back in 1970, at
17        least, that smoking was not harmful.
18             And what the plaintiffs are trying to do here
19        is to show you that Bill Sury was one of the six
20        out of 100 and one of the 11 out of a hundred that
21        could possibly have been affected by advertising or
22        could possibly have been affected by something the
23        tobacco companies said or did.
24             Plaintiffs want to convince you that he was in
25        those very small percentages because they need to,

 1        to prevail in this case.  How do they try to do it?
 2        By ignoring all the evidence in the case.  By
 3        ignoring the fact that Bill Sury was an intelligent
 4        man; he was an insurance underwriter.  By ignoring
 5        the fact he called them coffin nails.  By ignoring
 6        the fact that he and his friends laughed at the
 7        warnings because they were so unnecessary.  By
 8        ignoring the fact that Bill Sury and his friends
 9        growing up knew that smoking was dangerous.
10             And plaintiffs want you to ignore another
11        thing about Bill Sury; that he was a successful guy
12        with a successful career.  They want you to think
13        something else about Bill Sury -- he's no longer
14        here to tell you otherwise, and they want you to
15        think he was not a success; that he was not a
16        professional; that he did not have a distinguished
17        career.  You heard his son try and say that.
18             You heard his son try and say, and did say --
19        did say that, "My father had a low-level job."
20        That was no slip of the tongue; he said it twice.
21        Bill Sury raised his son, provided for him, sent
22        him to college, medical school.  Bill Sury was a
23        true gentleman.  He was a wonderful man.  He was a
24        good father.  He didn't complain.
25             You heard Hal Rush yesterday talk about how 4631
 1        they used to drive together in the golf cart until
 2        Hal drove he and Bill into the lake, and I asked
 3        him about, "Hey, what was Bill Sury's reaction to
 4        that?  What did he say?  Did he complain?"
 5             "No, he didn't complain."
 6             "Did he blame you?"
 7             "Nope."
 8             He was a successful insurance professional.  A
 9        very intelligent man.  He was a professional.  He
10        was an executive.
11             And he didn't blame anybody.  Bill Sury, you
12        heard through Ms. Shamp, accepts his responsibility
13        for smoking.  But this case is not brought by
14        Bill Sury.  It is brought by his son who seeks to
15        recover from his dad's illness.  We understand
16        that.  That's the way things seem to work out in
17        Florida for people who smoke and chose to smoke.
18             And you heard about why.  They had this thing
19        called the Engle case, the Engle option here.  They
20        have the Engle option to sue the tobacco companies.
21        You heard Dan Sury, the brother.  Played his
22        deposition just a little bit.  You heard him say
23        his nephew -- his nephew called him and said he had
24        found a window, a window, as he called it, to bring
25        this lawsuit.  The law says he could bring a

 1        lawsuit.
 2             And maybe there's some cases out there where
 3        the plaintiff really was confused about smoking,
 4        but not here.
 5             MS. SHAMP:  Objection, Your Honor.  I think
 6        he's going into whether --
 7             THE COURT:  Excuse me.
 8             MS. SHAMP:  I think he's going into something
 9        we discussed, Your Honor, in motion in limine.
10             MR. WILLIAMS:  No, Your Honor.  I'm not.
11             THE COURT:  Come to sidebar.
12             (A sidebar conference was held outside the
13   hearing of the jury as follows:)
14             MS. SHAMP:  I loath to object to somebody's
15        closing argument, Your Honor, but he started going
16        into whether it was appropriate for this plaintiff
17        to bring this case.  And then he started off with
18        saying Bill Sury doesn't blame anybody.
19             So I think this line of argument that he is
20        talking about whether it's appropriate to bring
21        this lawsuit.  And this is a lawsuit that he has
22        the right to bring.  It's not appropriate argument
23        for him to argue that this is an inappropriate
24        lawsuit or that William Sury wouldn't have wanted
25        to bring the lawsuit.

 1             MR. WILLIAMS:  I'm not arguing that, 2        Your Honor.  I'm -- I said it was appropriate for
 3        him to bring it, and I said he could bring it.  He
 4        found this window to bring it.  That's all.
 5             MS. SHAMP:  He found something called "the
 6        window" and then he said --
 7             MR. WILLIAMS:  Your Honor, may I -- we tried
 8        to keep the window out.  They wanted it in.  They
 9        wanted it in to show -- look, I am not going to go
10        into any issue that Bill Sury would not have
11        brought this lawsuit.  I understand that order and
12        I'm done with this area.  I'm simply --
13             MS. SHAMP:  He said -- the last thing out of
14        his mouth before I objected was there might be some
15        cases, indicating that there's some cases that have
16        merit under Engle and some cases that don't.  And
17        that's where I think he's allowed to go.
18             THE COURT:  Are you going any farther?
19             MR. WILLIAMS:  No.
20             THE COURT:  Okay.
21             (The sidebar conference was concluded, and the
22   following proceedings were held in open court:)
23             MR. WILLIAMS:  There might be some cases out
24        there where people are confused.  They were
25        confused.  There might be some people within that

 1        11 percent, but not Bill Sury.
 2             And so I suggest to you that when you get to
 3        the verdict form, the questions that relate to
 4        whether or not these Engle findings and the things
 5        in the Engle findings were the legal cause of
 6        Bill Sury's death, the answer is no.  The conduct
 7        of the tobacco company was not the legal cause of
 8        Bill Sury's death.
 9             As I said before, these questions are a
10        progression.  Get through one, you go two through
11        five.  And then if you go two through five
12        answering yes, then you get to Number 6.
13             This one right here, you can see, is
14        comparative fault.  If you find the tobacco
15        companies had some responsibility here, then you
16        have to decide how much.  How much we had, my
17        client Reynolds.  How much Mr. Woods' client
18        Lorillard had.  And also how much -- of course, you
19        see there is a spot here for Bill Sury, William
20        Sury.
21             There's no question here that Bill Sury
22        accepts responsibility.  You heard Ms. Shamp say,
23        "Well, okay, he accepts responsibility for all of
24        his smoking and failure to quit and what have you,
25        but only 10 to 20 percent."

 1             In view of the overwhelming evidence in this
 2        case, if there is responsibility, Bill Sury should
 3        accept all of it.  It was their evidence that gets 4        you there, frankly.
 5             During the testimony of David Burns, you heard
 6        the Surgeon General's view on whose decision it is
 7        to quit.  Who did he say?  It's the smokers'.  He
 8        told you who is responsible for quitting.  What did
 9        he say?  He said it's the smoker.  What Burns said,
10        I repeat, "Smokers are responsible for their own
11        behavior.  It's their responsibility to quit."
12             And why is quitting even more important in
13        this case?  We didn't hear an awful lot about it,
14        but it's something called declining risk.
15        Dr. Burns testified about it, and let me go back to
16        it.
17             Because if Bill Sury quit a number of years
18        ago, his risks of getting lung cancer would have
19        gone down significantly.  Dr. Burns said after
20        15 years of quitting, so that would have been, for
21        Bill Sury, in 1980, 16 years after the
22        Surgeon General's report.  After 15 years, his risk
23        of death would have gone down by 80 percent.  20,
24        25 years later, 90 percent of the risk is gone.
25             Think about that:  If Bill Sury had quit when

 1        Hal and Yancey quit, the risk of death would have
 2        been down way, way down.  Bill Sury is not this
 3        10 percent responsible or this 20 percent
 4        responsible.  Bill Sury is responsible entirely for
 5        his own decision.
 6             But even, again, if you do not assess all of
 7        the responsibility, you're going to have to make a
 8        decision with respect to Lorillard and Reynolds.
 9        What responsibility do they have?  And that issue
10        depends on the amount he smoked of our brands, and
11        for how long.  The brands he smoked and for how
12        long.
13             And this is another reason that we continue to
14        push the issue to you on the burden of proof
15        because we had a failure of proof, once again, from
16        the plaintiff on that issue.  We don't know enough
17        about what brands Bill Sury smoked or for how long.
18             We know he started smoking, because we saw the
19        pictures of him with a cigarette, in the 1940s.  We
20        don't know what the cigarette brand was.  His
21        brother said he thought he was smoking Raleighs
22        once when he visited him in the Army, but after
23        that, there's this big dead space.  We don't know.
24        That was back in the war.
25             And we know from Dr. Sury's testimony that up

 1        until 1961 or '2 he was smoking some other brand.
 2        We simply have almost 20 years of smoking history
 3        unknown.  We don't know who it is.  It could have
 4        been another company.  We don't know.  They failed
 5        to prove that to you for those 20 years. 6             Then we get up to the 1960s, so he smoked
 7        Raleighs for six -- six months to a year, and then
 8        he switched, said he switched to Kents.  He says
 9        couple years.  Yancey Montgomery said something
10        else, little longer.
11             And then we heard some Doral in there.  We
12        heard L&M, which is not even our product.  We heard
13        Dorals.  We don't know how much.  He says -- I
14        don't know what he said, back in the '60s or
15        something.  Yancey Montgomery said no, just a few
16        Dorals in the '80s.  And frankly, I think Yancey
17        would know better.  Why?  Because he's playing golf
18        with him every week, and they're putting their
19        smokes right in the golf cart.  He's going to be
20        able to see what he's smoking and sharing.
21             We don't know about Dorals.  We don't know how
22        many, how much, when.  Dr. Sury says, well, from
23        the '90s to '95 he was smoking Dorals, and he would
24        know that and, yes.
25             But the fact of the matter is we don't know

 1        enough.  We know he did smoke some of our product.
 2        We know he smoked some of Mr. Woods' product.  We
 3        don't know for how long in any of these
 4        circumstances.  We don't know how much, how many
 5        years.  It's a failure of proof.
 6             And so for that reason as well, I would
 7        suggest 100 percent allocation, in part for simply
 8        the failure to bring the proof to Mr. Sury.
 9             And then after Question 6, we get to
10        Question 7.  What were the damages sustained by
11        Robert Sury?  And let's look at what this is.  For
12        his loss of his parental companionship, instruction
13        and guidance and for his pain and suffering.
14             Now, let me start that by saying that if there
15        are any damages awarded in this case, these damages
16        are not awarded for the pain and suffering for any
17        loss of Bill Sury, even though he was a smoker.
18        That's the way it works.
19             They're awarded to Robert Sury.  Robert Sury
20        must show you the loss of the companionship,
21        instruction and guidance.  And, you know, sometimes
22        there is a loss for instruction and guidance, but
23        not here because when Bill Sury died, Dr. Sury was,
24        I believe, 46 years old.  41, 46.  41.  I'm sorry
25        he was 41 years old.

 1             He was already through medical school.  He
 2        already had a medical practice.  There's no
 3        evidence of any loss of instruction or guidance.
 4        Companionship, they lived together, but instruction
 5        and guidance, no.  And pain and suffering, this is
 6        Robert Sury's pain and suffering, not his dad's.
 7             And let me talk a little bit about something 8        that Ms. Shamp will certainly talk to you about,
 9        which is his loss of life.  She will show you these
10        government tables.  They're called the life
11        expectancy tables.
12             And she will show you that at 78, somebody
13        who's 78 who died in 1995 would have an additional
14        life expectancy of seven years.  In other words, if
15        you get to 78, odds are you're going to get about
16        to 85.  That's the average.  So seven years, okay.
17             And that's one way to look at it.  But another
18        way to look at it is to go back and look at
19        Bill Sury's life because he was born in 1919, and
20        you will also see the life expectancy table for
21        somebody born in 1919.
22             And believe it or not, in 1919, the life
23        expectancy for somebody born in that year, a man,
24        was about 55 years.  It's hard to believe, but
25        that's what it was in 1919.  Bill Sury outlived

 1        that by more than 20 years.  He had a good life.
 2        He would have had a happy life.  He had a full
 3        life.
 4             And then if you get through that question --
 5        and, again, we hope you stop at Number 1.  If you
 6        get through that question, you get to the question,
 7        Number 8, at the end, which is punitive damages.
 8        Let me talk about that.
 9             If you get all the way through the verdict
10        form, yes, yes, to all of that, you're going to
11        have to decide what punitive damages are warranted.
12        You know, plaintiffs always make this claim.  They
13        always sue -- they get to -- for compensatory
14        damages and for punitives.  It goes hand and hand.
15        We don't like to get up here and talk about
16        punitive damages, of course, but we have to because
17        they get to claim that, punitive damages.
18             What the judge will instruct you on punitive
19        damages is a few things.  And please bear these in
20        mind if you get that far.  Punitive damages are not
21        about compensation to Dr. Sury here.  They're not
22        about making anybody whole for any loss.  What
23        they're about is about even more money.
24             These punitive damages are designed to, what's
25        called punish and deter the defendants, to punish

 1        and deter them for reckless disregard of human
 2        life.  And with punitive damages, the plaintiff
 3        must meet an even higher standard.  It's not just
 4        one of these greater weights of the evidence.  It's
 5        the much greater weight of the evidence called
 6        clear and convincing evidence.
 7             And I'm obviously here to say that this case
 8        has nothing to do with punitive damages.  But apart
 9        from everything I've said before, there's no need, 10        there's no reason here to punish Reynolds or
11        Lorillard.
12             You've heard about the efforts of the tobacco
13        industry to try to make cigarettes safer.  They're
14        a harmful product.  Everybody knows that.  We have
15        tried to make them safer.  And we've been trying it
16        for decades and decades.  Since 1950s when it was
17        first realized that they were harmful, we've tried,
18        if you heard about it, remove harmful chemicals
19        from them called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
20        Dr. Figlar talked about that.
21             We've cooperated all we can with the federal
22        government at Tobacco Working Group trying to make
23        a safer cigarette, trying to develop a less
24        hazardous cigarette.
25             And a lot of that was this low tar effort,

 1        which was encouraged by the federal government and
 2        we did it, and that's when we made low-tar
 3        cigarettes in part.  We thought it was good too.
 4        Why did we do that?  We did that for one reason:
 5        To reduce the risk for smokers who still chose to
 6        smoke.
 7             With respect to Reynolds -- I'm very proud of
 8        this.  You heard from Dr. Figlar, and even
 9        Dr. Proctor admitted it, this revolutionary
10        breakthrough that Reynolds is coming up with, at
11        first it was called Premiere, now it's called
12        Eclipse.  It's this cigarette that doesn't burn
13        tobacco.  It heats it.
14             I talked to Dr. Proctor about that, and even
15        Dr. Proctor, no friend of the industry, said that
16        smoking Eclipse would cause significantly fewer
17        deaths.
18             Quite recently Reynolds -- you heard about
19        this nitrosamine.  Reynolds had found that one of
20        the ways that the farmers were curing tobacco was
21        actually increase the amount of something called
22        nitrosamines into the tobacco.
23             So they came up with a new way.  Reynolds came
24        up with a new way to cure tobacco for the farmers.
25        And they have gone out all over the country,

 1        wherever tobacco is grown, to tell them how to do
 2        that.
 3             In every decade since the 1950s, R.J. Reynolds
 4        has been working to make its product safer.
 5        Perhaps we waited too long acknowledging that
 6        smoking caused lung cancer, but our record in
 7        trying to make cigarettes is safer is hardly a
 8        record of reckless disregard of health.
 9             You also saw in the testimony of Dr. Figlar
10        something else that Reynolds is doing today about
11        smoking and lung cancer.  You saw the websites, the 12        educational programs with respect to smoking and
13        lung cancer and addiction and relying on public
14        health authorities.
15             You got the quit line up there.  Can you
16        imagine that, you know, a company trying to get
17        people to quit and not to use their products?  It's
18        not a record that requires punishment for
19        deterrents.
20             So if you get that far, and I hope you don't,
21        I hope you find that punitive damages are not
22        warranted.
23             I'm about done.  But before I finish, I want
24        to remind you of one thing.  Remember when we were
25        over in voir dire, jury selection over in the other

 1        courthouse, I asked the question right at the end
 2        of all the questions I got to ask, and I asked you
 3        and I asked everybody in the room one question.
 4             I said, look, even if the evidence shows that
 5        Bill Sury wasn't addicted, or even if the evidence
 6        shows that he could have quit, that it wasn't the
 7        legal cause, and even if we show you that cancer
 8        wasn't caused by smoking or they failed to show it,
 9        and even if there's no evidence that Bill Sury
10        smoked because of anything the tobacco companies
11        did or said, and I put all that out there, I asked
12        you, I asked the whole group if you could decide
13        the case on those facts and just those facts, that
14        you could decide the case and not be swayed because
15        of some sympathy for Robert Sury here or to find
16        for Robert Sury just because he had brought the
17        case.  I asked that question and I put it out to
18        everybody.
19             And I don't know if you remember this, two
20        people raised their hand and said, "Why?"  And, of
21        course, because of that, they were not selected to
22        sit on this jury.
23             But I mention that because none of you raised
24        your hands.  And all of you agreed, I believe, to
25        decide this case just on the basis of the evidence

 1        that we presented here and nothing else, and
 2        certainly not on any sympathy.
 3             So I ask you when you remember to please
 4        remember that when you go to the jury room.  You
 5        agreed that you would decide the case just on the
 6        basis of the facts presented.
 7             I'm done.  Let me leave you with this:
 8        Bill Sury made choices throughout his life.  He
 9        made a choice to smoke.  He made a choice to
10        continue to smoke.  He made a choice not to quit.
11        It was a choice not to quit.
12             He made a choice to disregard the warnings of
13        his friends and his family.  He made a choice to 14        disregard the warnings on the pack.  Bill Sury
15        lived the way he wanted to live his life.
16        Bill Sury chose to smoke cigarettes on his own
17        freewill.  Smoking was Bill Sury's choice and
18        smoking was Bill Sury's responsibility.
19             Again, let me thank you for your service.  Let
20        me thank you for your attention, your patience, and
21        I hope you enjoy it.


12            MR. WOODS:  Thank you, Your Honor.
13            Good afternoon, everyone.  You remember me,
14       David Woods, for Lorillard.
15            This case is about Bill Sury.  The plaintiff's
16       counsel, Ms. Shamp, said this case is also about the
17       tobacco companies, and I don't disagree with that.
18       We're obviously here.  You've seen documents from
19       R.J. Reynolds, from Lorillard.  We've have done our
20       best as the trial has gone on to try to put those
21       documents in context, try to explain what we can.
22       To the extent that there is no good explanation,
23       sometimes there's no good explanation.
24            But what I want to do now is walk through the
25       evidence, especially as it relates to Lorillard, and

 1       talk to you about what I think the evidence has
 2       shown in this case.
 3            You'll remember this slide from when I started,
 4       and that's, what does this have to do with Bill
 5       Sury?  You've heard that a lot now.  You hear it
 6       over and over and over.  But it's important, because
 7       the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to prove
 8       that if either company did something that it caused
 9       either Bill Sury to start smoking, to continue to
10       smoke, or not to smoke, or not to quit earlier.
11            And we do pretrial discovery before the trial
12       starts, and so we have a pretty good idea of who is
13       coming and what they're going to say, what witnesses
14       and what they're going to say.  And you've seen Dr.
15       Proctor and you've seen Dr. Goldberg, you've seen
16       Kristy Leung, who was the Lorillard marketing
17       representative.  You've seen Ed Robinson, who was
18       the Lorillard company scientist.  You saw Dr. Burns,
19       who was on video.  And you notice that -- and the
20       reason why I put this up in opening is I think that
21       you probably noticed that those videos especially
22       were taken in other cases, and the idea is you play
23       them in this case really without regard to who the
24       particular smoker is, what brands they smoked, when
25       they smoked them, when they started, and when they

 1       quit.
 2            And so, for example, with Kristy Leung you saw 3       all sorts of advertisements and documents and other
 4       things relating to Old Gold, relating to Newport,
 5       relating to True.  All brands that Dr. Sury
 6       confirmed his dad never smoked.
 7            And so the question is what does that have to
 8       do in this case about Bill Sury.  You've obviously
 9       seen Kent ads, and the testimony in this case is
10       that Mr. Sury smoked Kent for a time.  Was it two
11       years like Dr. Sury says, or was it longer?  You're
12       the jury.  I'll put that in your hands.  I think Mr.
13       Williams agrees we'll put that in your hands in
14       terms of who proved what.
15            But at the end of the day it is still
16       plaintiff's burden to prove that anything that you
17       saw caused Bill Sury to smoke or caused Bill Sury to
18       not quit sooner than he did.
19            Now, youth smoking.  There was a lot of time
20       spent in this case on youth smoking, but the
21       evidence is clear that Mr. Sury started smoking when
22       he was 21 years old, in 1941.  And so like Mr.
23       Williams said, there may be cases out there where
24       some young person started smoking, was affected by
25       advertisements, didn't know the health risks, got

 1       addicted and was unable to quit, but that's not this
 2       case.  That's not Bill Sury.
 3            Bill Sury, when he smoked Kent he was over 45
 4       years old, sometime in the mid 1960's is the
 5       testimony.  He was married, he was a father, he had
 6       been a life insurance underwriter for ten years.
 7            You know, I want to talk a little bit about
 8       this underwriter thing.  I don't know what an
 9       underwriter does.  I don't know if an underwriter is
10       an executive or if it's not an executive.
11       Respectfully, I'm not sure if that this case is
12       about whether Bill Sury was an executive or not an
13       executive.
14            What we do know is that he worked for
15       Prudential Insurance Company.  We know that the job
16       of an insurance company, and from what we understand
17       the job of an underwriter is, is to look at peoples
18       individual risks and determine whether that might
19       affect their longevity, how long they're going to
20       live.
21            And we know from Dr. Sury's testimony that one
22       of the things that Mr. Sury looked at when he was
23       doing that was whether somebody smoked.  And you
24       recall when Mr. Williams mentioned this that Dr.
25       Goldberg agreed that for an underwriter that that

 1       type of information, awareness of the health risks
 2       of smoking, would be more salient, would be more
 3       vivid.
 4            And so to the extent that there is relevance in 5       this case that Mr. Sury was an underwriter, that's
 6       what it is.  Whether he was an executive or not an
 7       executive to me doesn't matter.
 8            But again, youth smoking I would submit to you
 9       really in some other case maybe, in this case it's
10       not relevant.
11            Nicotine.  You saw and you heard -- in Ms.
12       Shamp's opening statement she read some documents
13       talking about minimum levels of nicotine and spiking
14       nicotine, that type of thing, and I tried to explain
15       in opening and then I tried to bring evidence during
16       trial during on cross-examination with Dr. Proctor
17       and also through the Lorillard Company's scientist
18       Ed Robinson, which I'm going to talk to in a minute.
19            But before we get there, I mean, let's talk
20       about nicotine.  There is no secret that nicotine is
21       in cigarettes.  There is no secret that one of the
22       reasons why people smoke is because there is
23       nicotine in tobacco.  Nicotine is naturally in
24       tobacco.  Tobacco companies don't put nicotine in
25       tobacco.  Mother Nature puts nicotine in tobacco.

 1            One of the reasons, like I said, that people
 2       smoke is because of nicotine.  Is it the fundamental
 3       reason?  I don't know.  Is it fundamental for
 4       somebody and maybe not fundamental for another?  I
 5       don't know.  But it's one of the reasons why people
 6       smoke, and that's not a secret.
 7            Now, cigarettes can be addictive.  No doubt
 8       about it.  We also know that even addicted smokers
 9       can quit.  And I'm not saying it's easy for
10       everybody.  I'm not saying that some people --
11       particularly if you're addicted it may take multiple
12       times.  But I think that really comes down to
13       motivation.  And when I say motivation I don't mean
14       lack of willpower, you didn't try hard enough.  It's
15       whether you truly in your heart of hearts whether
16       you want to be a nonsmoker, whether you want to
17       be -- more than you want to be a smoker.
18            But anyway, nicotine is naturally in tobacco.
19       There is actually more tobacco in the leaf -- we
20       talked about that -- in the ground when it comes out
21       than in a commercial cigarette.
22            Nicotine levels -- you may have seen I spent a
23       lot of time pulling up nicotine -- tar and nicotine
24       level charts.  You remember the Reader's Digest from
25       1957, then the Reader's Digest from 1958 that shows

 1       that tar and nicotine levels have gone down.  So the
 2       importance of that is that it's not -- there is no
 3       magic level of nicotine.  There is no magic point,
 4       whatever, that if you have that much nicotine that's
 5       how you addict people.
 6            And that's just common sense, if you think 7       about it, because somebody can smoke a half pack a
 8       day of an ultra light cigarette and they're going to
 9       get x-amount of nicotine.  Now, they may be
10       addicted.  Somebody else may smoke two packs a day
11       of unfiltered cigarettes.  They're going to get a
12       lot more nicotine.  They may be just as addicted as
13       somebody who smokes and gets very, very much less
14       nicotine.
15            No witness came in here to say more nicotine
16       equals more addictive, or less nicotine means less
17       addicted.  If that was the case then on average,
18       since nicotine levels have gone down over time,
19       theoretically cigarettes would be less addictive
20       today than they were 50 years ago.  And I don't
21       think any scientists believe that.  I don't believe
22       that.  So there is no magic dose of nicotine.
23            But again the nicotine manipulation.  You
24       recall we spent a lot of time talking with Dr.
25       Proctor, and you may have missed it with the Ed

 1       Robinson video, the Lorillard Company's scientist,
 2       because frankly they're not the most exciting things
 3       to watch.  But even within there Dr. Robinson and
 4       Dr. Proctor basically agreed when it came to the
 5       Tobacco Working Group.  Again, you remember I used
 6       this document with Dr. Proctor, National Cancer
 7       Institute, it's from 1976.
 8            When you go back -- when you go back to the
 9       jury room, if you're concerned about whether
10       Lorillard or anybody else manipulated nicotine in
11       cigarettes, please search out the Lorillard nicotine
12       documents and read them and read them.  Read them
13       front to back.  And then also read this, and this is
14       Trial Exhibit 354, and you'll seen Gio Gory from the
15       National Cancer Institute, Brown & Williamson,
16       filter manufacturers, and you'll remember Dr. Tso
17       from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, you'll
18       remember he was the one who actually in that
19       document had the idea of adding nicotine to
20       cigarettes.  And again, the idea was if tar is the
21       bad thing, but people are going to smoke for
22       nicotine, if you can drop the tar, but you can keep
23       the nicotine where it is, then maybe, maybe that
24       will make it less hazardous.  And scientists at the
25       time thought it was a good thing.

 1            At the end of the day it didn't work.  It never
 2       resulted in a commercial product.  For whatever
 3       reason people didn't like the taste, didn't like
 4       cigarettes with lower tar and medium nicotine.  So
 5       at the end of the day -- I mean, I guess this is
 6       relevant as to Lorillard and as to Bill Sury and
 7       Kent in this case, no Kent cigarette ever had low
 8       tar medium nicotine, for better or worse. 9            So again you remember this from opening.  I
10       tried to boil down what I think this case is about:
11       Control, causation, and responsibility.
12            Control.  Who ultimately -- sort of a buck
13       stops here.  Who ultimately was in control of Mr.
14       Sury's decision to smoke, his decision to pick up
15       that first cigarette, his decision to continue
16       buying cigarettes, and then his decision ultimately
17       to quit in 1995 when he did quit.
18            Causation.  You'll remember there are two parts
19       to the causation.  One is medical causation.  And
20       we're going to talk about that in a little bit.  But
21       the other one is legal cause.  Legal cause:  The
22       idea that it's the plaintiff's burden to prove that
23       something that either R.J. Reynolds or Lorillard
24       Tobacco Company did to cause Bill Sury to do
25       something that he would not otherwise have done.

 1       And we'll talk about this as we walk through the
 2       verdict form.  But the idea here is -- it's called
 3       the but for cause in law school, and it's in the
 4       instructions.  And the concept is that but for
 5       something that Lorillard did he would have done
 6       something differently.  And if the plaintiff's don't
 7       prove that -- if he would have smoked if Lorillard
 8       were not even in the picture, then there is no but
 9       for causation, because he would have smoked anyway.
10            Responsibility.  That's really -- that's the
11       when it's all said and done who ultimately is
12       responsible?  Who was in the best position, the
13       tobacco company, who has -- like it or not, society
14       has decided with warnings on the packs companies can
15       continue to sell and, with restrictions, advertise
16       the product.  And so we can't be punished, we can't
17       be held liable merely for selling the product.
18            So at the end of the day the question is who is
19       in the best position ultimately to decide whether or
20       not to use the product.
21            So control.  Let's talk about that first.  You
22       remember -- you'll see I'm recycling a lot of my
23       slides from the opening.  I think this is clear.  I
24       think everybody agrees.  I think plaintiff agrees, I
25       think Reynolds agrees, and I know Lorillard agrees

 1       that Bill Sury, Mr. Sury, was an intelligent,
 2       hardworking and successful person.  Whether he was
 3       an executive or whether he was not an executive, it
 4       doesn't matter, he was an intelligent, hardworking,
 5       and successful.  The witnesses told you that.  Every
 6       fact witness that came in here from his son, Dr.
 7       Sury, to his two golfing buddies, to his younger
 8       brother, who you heard by deposition read to you
 9       that he was intelligent, that he was well read, and
10       frankly that he was a good guy.  No doubt about 11       that.  No doubt about that at all.
12            You'll remember the timeline that I showed you
13       in opening.  I just want to bring it out here for
14       some reminders on dates.  But again it shows -- and
15       Mr. Williams walked through some of this already, so
16       I'm not going to repeat it.  But his time in the
17       Army, moved his way up from enlisted to officer.
18       Started out in the mailroom at Prudential.
19            I mean, Mr. Sury was born in 1919.  He was ten
20       years old when the stock market crashed.  He is not
21       somebody who had anything handed to him.  He got to
22       where he was by working hard, working hard in the
23       military, working hard at Prudential.  He got
24       himself, frankly, from the mailroom in 1939 to the
25       point where he is golfing every Saturday with other

 1       successful businessmen.  I guess, Yancey Montgomery
 2       and Hal Rush probably were executives.  But, you
 3       know, at the end of the day I think we all agree
 4       that's pretty impressive.
 5            We also know that Mr. Sury was an informed
 6       adult smoker.  We have already talked about the fact
 7       that he was an adult before he ever first picked up
 8       a cigarette, probably 21 years old, either right in
 9       the military or right before the military.  Again
10       when he started smoking Kent he was 45 years old at
11       least, somewhere in there.  And Dr. Sury is
12       testifying from memory, from when he was fairly
13       young, but he recalls sometime in the mid 1960's.
14       Ms. Shamp said right after the Surgeon General's
15       report.  I don't know if that's right or not, but
16       it's sometime in the mid 1960's.
17            Nobody came in here, no fact witness was able
18       to come in here and tell you why did Bill Sury
19       choose Kent.  Over any other brand out there why did
20       he choose Kent?
21            Now, we know that Dr. Goldberg -- and we've
22       heard through Ms. Shamp it was because of the
23       advertising.  It was because of the advertising that
24       was done in the 1950's, that greatest health
25       protection in cigarette history.  Well, you'll

 1       remember it was sort of my big aha moment, and it
 2       was the -- this picture.  And this picture I would
 3       submit proves that those advertisements, the
 4       greatest health protection advertisements -- you saw
 5       one of those in Ms. Shamp's closing.  You also saw,
 6       I think it was the voice of wisdom ad.  All of those
 7       ads were before 1955.
 8            You'll remember in 1955 were the new FTC
 9       advertising guides that said no more health claims
10       in advertising.  Then you remember Dr. Goldberg went
11       out and pulled the document out of his trunk and
12       said, aha, here's late '55 and you've got the FTC 13       yelling at you for your advertisements.  I think we
14       explained that, well, that was because the
15       advertisement ran before the FTC guides went into
16       effect.
17            But be it as it may, those advertisements
18       stopped in 1955.  I think you'll probably see the ad
19       for more scientists and educators smoked Kent, which
20       ran in 1960.  But if you'll recall, Lorillard
21       started clearing its advertising through the FTC in
22       1958.  And so to the extent that those ads ran, they
23       were approved by the FTC, for right or wrong, better
24       or worse.
25            And that's assuming that Mr. Sury even saw any

 1       of them.  And there was no evidence that he did.
 2       But even assuming that he did.
 3            But again back to the picture.  You'll recall
 4       this is from 1956.  This is Mr. Sury, and this is
 5       the young future Dr. Sury.  And it's hard to tell,
 6       but you can -- that's obviously the white part of
 7       the cigarette, that's a cork tip.  If you've seen,
 8       some brands have white tipping paper around them,
 9       some have cork tip.  And you'll recall Dr. Goldberg
10       agreed Kent always had -- and if you see more ads
11       after I sit down and Ms. Shamp gets back up you'll
12       notice it always had a white filter, white paper
13       around the filter.  So that's the best evidence I
14       can bring you that those ads did not make Mr. Sury
15       start smoking Kent.
16            Now, at some point, and I think there is no
17       dispute, he did start smoking Kent.  He started
18       smoking Kent sometime in the mid 1960's.
19            Now, I'll put this one up.  These have some of
20       the facts from after 1960, but first I'm going to
21       put this up.  And this another one of those you saw
22       for maybe ten seconds with Kristy Leung, and -- but
23       it's important, because what this shows is here's
24       1952.  Kent was not on the market before 1952.  And
25       you see, if you can read this -- I apologize if you

 1       can't -- this is when it comes in.  It says:
 2       Protection, the health protection ads '52 to 1954.
 3       The voice of wisdom ad, 1955.
 4            And you see that in 1954 Kent brand here
 5       actually drops.  Those advertisements weren't
 6       causing people to smoke Kent.  It actually started
 7       to drop.  Then in 1956 and 1957 what happened?  You
 8       remember the Reader's Digest articles, the Reader's
 9       Digest articles that did the test on Kent and found
10       that Kent was the best filter out there.
11            So there is a big difference between an
12       advertiser saying we're the greatest health
13       protection in cigarette history, market share goes
14       down.  Independent third party running independent 15       tests on tar and nicotine levels, it shot up.  That
16       shows you the power of independent -- independent
17       analysis and what independent people say, because
18       people believe independent sources.
19            So again after that, Kent now I think in 2010,
20       let's see, it's 0.0.  The last time it's even 0.1 is
21       2004.  So think about that when you're thinking
22       about effectiveness of Kent advertising.
23            Now, again, Mr. Sury was an adult informed
24       smoker.  The risks were known.  But I think Mr.
25       Williams read the last one here to you.  But, you

 1       know, Dr. Hammond from 1955, 1957 U.S. Surgeon
 2       General, 1957 U.S. National Cancer Institute, all
 3       agree.  Now, Dr. Goldberg came in, and Dr. Goldberg
 4       said the industry advertising, the wallpaper, and
 5       everything Hill & Knowlton was doing, and whatever
 6       the tobacco companies were saying, that watered down
 7       the message, that confused people, that completely
 8       drowned out the public health message.
 9            Well, that's what he says in 2011, but if you
10       would have asked these public health officials back
11       in the 1950's they would have disagreed with him.
12            Likewise, you remember this.  This was with Dr.
13       Riddel.  Ms. Shamp has used some polls that were
14       done for the Tobacco Institute, and I think they
15       were found in Philip Morris files.  You saw that Dr.
16       Riddel wasn't very impressed with them, but they're
17       in evidence.  By all means, go back and read the
18       entire things, the entire polls, and see if they're
19       inconsistent with what we have here.
20            1954, 70 percent of people think smoking is
21       harmful.  Climbs up to 85 percent, 91 percent, 96
22       percent.  And these are polls done -- the AUTS,
23       Adult Use of Tobacco Survey.  Remember, those are
24       polls that are done by the federal government.
25            So again, control.  Who was in control?  Who

 1       was in the best position to affect whether Mr. Sury
 2       started to smoke, or if he decided when to quit
 3       smoking?
 4            Everybody has decided at one point in their
 5       mind -- or one point in time whether they're going
 6       to be a smoker or not.  Everybody is offered a
 7       cigarette at one point, and you either try it or you
 8       don't try it.  And it's a personal decision that
 9       everybody makes.  Mr. Sury also had control over his
10       brand choice.
11            And you'll remember you were shown all sorts of
12       articles about the public health community and what
13       they were telling smokers, telling them to quit,
14       quit smoking, but if you're not going to quit
15       smoking then at least switch to lower tar.
16            Well, Ms. Shamp said Mr. Sury looked at these 17       in choosing what brands he was going to pick.  Well,
18       you see here it says you can buy as much as 34
19       milligrams of tar or as little as 2.  Kent is right
20       in the middle.  So if somebody is going and their
21       goal is to find the lowest tar and nicotine, it's
22       not Kent.  Kent was right there about with Marlboro.
23       Advantage is lower, Carlton is lower.  There's a lot
24       more lower, but I wanted to put the bigger brand
25       names up there.

 1            So at the end of the day again it's no doubt
 2       Mr. Sury was a great guy.  Yancey Montgomery said
 3       that he enjoyed smoking, from what he could observe
 4       it looked like Mr. Sury enjoyed smoking.
 5            Dr. Sury talked about how when his dad would
 6       come home from work -- I think Ms. Shamp even
 7       mentioned that in her closing -- he would sit down,
 8       relax, put his feet up, you know, have a hi-ball,
 9       bourbon and water, have a cigarette, talk to his
10       wife as she made dinner.  All of Bill Sury's friends
11       smoke.  His entire foursome smoked.
12            Now, Ms. Shamp tried -- it seems like she's
13       portraying that as, oh, he smoked everywhere, so he
14       must have been addicted.  But the fact of the matter
15       is that's what he did, it was part of his lifestyle.
16       He got together with friends and they joked around,
17       they golfed, and they played pooled or they played
18       cards after golfing, and they'd smoke.  And there is
19       nothing wrong with that.
20            But, you know, something else that you may have
21       noticed is that every fact witness who testified in
22       this case was at one point a smoker, but quit.
23       Every one of them.  Daniel Sury, Bill Sury's younger
24       brother, he quit in 1959.  He had smoked for about
25       ten years one pack a day.  He quit cold turkey when

 1       he started having kids.  Dr. Sury, you know, you
 2       recall he read the warnings to his father, but then
 3       he started smoking.  You know, he didn't smoke that
 4       much and didn't smoke very long, but even he quit
 5       smoking.  Hal Rush, you heard his testimony
 6       yesterday.  Seems like it was a week ago.  But you
 7       recall that he -- he went and his father who was a
 8       smoker was in an oxygen tent in the hospital, and he
 9       recalls his father reaching out to try to get his
10       package of cigarettes, and he says that's it, I'm
11       stopping.  That's motivation.
12            And it wasn't easy for Hal Rush.  Was Hal Rush
13       addicted?  He may very well may have been.  But
14       again it's motivation, and it's not willpower, it's
15       motivation, it's telling yourself I'm going to try.
16       I'm going to try like Hal Rush did.  I'm going to
17       try hypnosis.
18            Hypnosis didn't work for him, so he went to 19       this nicotine withdrawal clinic that was down the
20       road, down San Jose Boulevard, and they stuck
21       apparently needles in his eyes and ears and nose,
22       and that was it for him and he stopped smoking.
23            Yancey Montgomery, two or three pack a day
24       smoker.  He quit smoking because he started having
25       heart problems; smoked one last cigarette, quit cold

 1       turkey.
 2            But there's another one.  Mr. Sury.  Mr. Sury
 3       quit.  He quit six months before he was diagnosed.
 4       This wasn't one of those situations where somebody
 5       gets diagnosed with lung cancer and it's basically a
 6       death sentence so they've got to quit.  He quit
 7       really before he started having any symptoms of his
 8       lung cancer, six months before.  He quit when he
 9       started getting a cough, and when he quit his cough
10       went away, and he stayed quit.  Again motivation is
11       the key.  You've seen these stats before.  I'm not
12       going to keep quoting them to you.
13            Dr. Frazier.  You'll recall that was
14       plaintiff's expert.  I guess she wasn't a
15       psychiatrist, but she was their addiction expert,
16       and even she agreed that the smoker -- it's
17       motivation -- the smoker has to want to quit.
18            We talked in opening about if you want your
19       spouse to go on a diet, or your spouse wants you to
20       go on a diet, or you want your kids to get straight
21       A's, well, they have -- motivation has to come from
22       within.
23            And the question is, is there evidence of Mr.
24       Sury being motivated.  And again I'm not being
25       critical.  I'm not saying he didn't try hard enough,

 1       he wasn't -- he didn't have the willpower.  But ask
 2       yourself, if he would have wanted -- truly wanted to
 3       quit smoking wouldn't he have -- for example, with
 4       friends and family, when Hal Rush came back, and
 5       every Saturday they're in the golf cart together,
 6       you would think that at least once he would say,
 7       hey, Hal, tell me about that nicotine withdrawal
 8       clinic you went to.  I'm tired of smoking.  I don't
 9       want to smoke anymore.  Tell me about that.  He
10       never did.
11            Same thing with Yancey Montgomery.  If they
12       were sitting around shooting pool or playing cards.
13       No conversations, no indication that he wanted to
14       quit.
15            Now, there is also no dispute Dr. Sury wanted
16       his dad to quit smoking.  No doubt about that.  But
17       that's again you wanting something to do it.  Unless
18       they have internalized it and unless they want to do
19       it they're not going to make the changes that are
20       going to be required, because for some people it can 21       be hard to quit.
22            Stop smoking clinics.  In 1982 Mr. Sury retired
23       from Prudential.  At that point he's no longer going
24       in to work, he's no longer subject to the daily
25       grind and the stress of work.  If he wanted to quit

 1       smoking, if he was motivated to quit smoking, he had
 2       every resource available to him.  He had the
 3       resources to go to stop smoking clinics, presumably
 4       he had a doctor, he could have gone to his doctor
 5       and sought help.  He could have -- Dr. Sury
 6       recommended, hey, Dad, why don't you go to hypnosis.
 7       His dad didn't go.
 8            And again I'm not being critical, but it's --
 9       if the question is whether Mr. Sury wanted to quit,
10       if you look at the objective evidence, the objective
11       evidence shows no motivation to quit until the 90's
12       when he did quit.  And apparently he used the patch,
13       and it took him a while, but ultimately he was able
14       to quit, and there is no reason that if he would
15       have been motivated that he couldn't have quit
16       earlier.
17            And why is quitting important?  Mr. Williams
18       walked you through this already.  I have a graphic
19       of it.  You saw this during opening.  But the point
20       here is 15 years of not smoking.  So that would be
21       roughly 1980.  So about the time when Mr. Sury
22       retired.  If he would have quit smoking about the
23       time he retired his risk of smoking would have
24       dropped by 80 percent.
25            Okay.  That's a good segue into causation.  In

 1       a case like this involving a smoker who ends up with
 2       a mass in their lung and the question is is that a
 3       lung cancer that's caused by smoking.  And the key
 4       here is when you say lung cancer it is sort of a
 5       misnomer, because a cancer in the lung is lung
 6       cancer, but the lung cancer can start somewhere
 7       else.  It can start in the pancreas, it can start
 8       anywhere else, and we'll get to the relevance of
 9       that in a minute.
10            But walking in -- walking into this lawsuit
11       before you heard any evidence what would you have
12       expected to see?  Medical records, death
13       certificates, x-rays, radiology, all these things.
14       You would have expected to see -- you would have
15       expected to see a treating physician or some expert
16       walk in with a load of medical records and show you
17       x-rays and CT's, and here it is, you can see it
18       here.  You see that there is nothing else, no other
19       tumors in the liver, or pancreas, or anything like
20       that.
21            We don't have that here.  The records were
22       destroyed.  We're not saying Dr. Sury destroyed the 23       records.  The records were destroyed.  We tried our
24       best, and I'm sure plaintiff's counsel tried their
25       best to get the records, but they're just not here.

 1            All we have are two medical records, one which
 2       is the pathology report which you've seen, the other
 3       is basically another pathology report which I think
 4       says about the same thing.  Then we have the death
 5       certificate, but we know that the death certificate
 6       has errors in it.
 7            But most importantly we have pathology.  We
 8       have the actual slides of Mr. Sury's tumor that
 9       experts can look at, pathologists can look at to see
10       what it looks like.  Does this look like something
11       that started in the lung?  Does this look like
12       something that may be metastasized to the lung?
13            Okay.  So what is plaintiff's evidence on
14       medical causation?  Their first witness was Dr. Alan
15       Marks.  He's the one that filled out the death
16       certificate.  And he agreed -- he was not the one
17       who treated Mr. Sury.  The one who treated Mr.
18       Sury -- if you recall, the last person, the last
19       video that we played in our case, Dr. Gaddis, the
20       one who basically said, I don't have any records, I
21       don't have any recollection of this person, and I
22       can't tell you what caused his lung cancer, that was
23       Mr. Sury's treating oncologist.  That was the person
24       who treated his cancer, and he had no recollection
25       of him.

 1            Dr. Alan Marks was Dr. Gaddis' medical partner.
 2       Dr. Gaddis was apparently out of the office that
 3       day.  They got the call.  He had never met Bill
 4       Sury, he'd never treated Bill Sury.  He did not
 5       review the pathology.  He said, I assume I looked,
 6       because that was his practice, at the records, maybe
 7       five pages of records for five minutes.
 8            And we know there are errors on the death
 9       certificate.  We know that it says that there was
10       five or six months from diagnosis to death, and we
11       know that that's wrong because it's 15 or 16 months.
12       We know that it says squamous cell ling cancer, and
13       we know that's wrong, because the pathology
14       report -- the only thing we have about the
15       pathology -- says undifferentiated, or poorly
16       differentiated carcinoma with squamous cell
17       features, which does not mean squamous cell
18       carcinoma.  And I'll get to the importance of that
19       in a minute.
20            Who was the second expert that opined on
21       causation?  It was actually Dr. Sury's personal
22       physician.  He was the one who actually -- when Mr.
23       Sury started getting weak Dr. Sury took him in, did
24       a chest x-ray, apparently Dr. Grochmal recalled from 25       14 years ago the size of the tumor that was on this

 1       x-ray.  But again he didn't treat Mr. Sury's cancer.
 2       He saw that and felt is was suspicious and he sent
 3       him to a pathologist to get diagnosed for lung
 4       cancer, because that's what pathologists do.  He's
 5       not a pathologist, he's not an oncologist.
 6            Again with these videos it's hard to tell, but
 7       after he said, well, it's my opinion that this is a
 8       primary lung cancer that started in the lung and it
 9       was caused by smoking, immediately after that he
10       admitted that he's not an expert in carcinogenesis,
11       which is an expert in cancer causation.
12            So we brought you Dr. Stonesifer, and Dr.
13       Stonesifer said Bill Sury had adenocarcinoma, not
14       squamous cell carcinoma.  Ms. Shamp sort of called
15       into question his credentials.  Dr. Stonesifer has
16       been a pathologist for 26 years.  He's board
17       certified, he was the former hospital chief of
18       staff.  He showed you what he saw, the signet cell
19       rings and the other features to show that it was
20       adenocarcinoma, it was not squamous cell carcinoma.
21            And the importance there is adenocarcinoma can
22       start in a lot of different places, in the stomach,
23       in the pancreas, in the colon, GI tract, prostate.
24       Those are all adenocarcinomas.
25            And the lung, more than -- just because you

 1       have a tumor in your lung doesn't mean that it
 2       started there.  And in fact the research shows that
 3       more than half of the cancers that end up in the
 4       lung started somewhere else.
 5            The problem is we didn't have the medical
 6       records.  We didn't have other CT scans, we didn't
 7       have anything else to go back and figure it out.
 8       All we had were one or two medical records and a --
 9       and a death certificate that we know is faulty.
10            But again, the pathology, other than two
11       medical records, other than a death certificate that
12       we know is wrong, the most critical evidence in this
13       case of what caused Mr. Sury's cancer, what type of
14       tumor it was, was the pathology.
15            Wouldn't you have expected plaintiff's counsel
16       to bring in a pathologist?  They took Dr.
17       Stonesifer's deposition.  They knew he was going to
18       come in and say it was adenocarcinoma.  Why didn't
19       they call a pathologist?  Ask yourself that.  Well,
20       they may say because it's a red herring because both
21       of them are linked to smoking.  But again
22       adenocarcinomas start in a lot of different places
23       and they spread to the lung.
24            The burden of proof is on the plaintiff, and
25       they did not even bring a pathologist.
4679 1            Okay.  Responsibility.  Who -- who was in the
 2       best position?  Who is responsible?  You know, in
 3       this country -- we talked about the greatest
 4       generation in opening statements.  We talked about
 5       how -- I think I said Dan Rather, but I think it's
 6       actually Tom Brokaw who coined it the greatest
 7       generation.
 8            You know, Mr. Sury, like I said, born in 1919.
 9       I mean, he saw the entire cold war beginning and
10       end.  He saw the fall of the Soviet Union in his
11       lifetime, lived through the depression.  He was a
12       member of the greatest generation.
13            Well, who was another member of the greatest
14       generation?  Harry Reasoner.  Here's what he had to
15       say.
16            (Video clip played and interpreted by the
17       reporter as follows.)
18            In this kind of a country it comes down to you,
19       whether you like it or not.  No one is going to
20       forbid an adult to smoke, and it is now quite clear
21       that no one is going to tell him it's good for him
22       either.  The decision is his.  The decision and the
23       health that may depend on it.  This is Harry
24       Reasoner.  Goodnight.
25            (Video clip concluded.)

 1            And that pretty well sums it up.  That's how
 2       the greatest generation looked at this issue.  No
 3       one is going to tell you you can't smoke.  It's your
 4       choice to smoke, but smoking comes with health
 5       risks.
 6            Now I want to walk through the verdict form a
 7       little bit.  Mr. Williams did it some, but I wanted
 8       to put these slides up here.
 9            We have spoken about this first question.  If
10       you answer no to the first question then you're
11       done.  If you answer yes then you go on.  So let's
12       look at the first question first.
13            The first question actually has three different
14       parts like Mr. Williams told you.  This is the first
15       part.  Basically it's was Mr. Sury addicted.  And in
16       this case you had Dr. Giakas on the one hand, you
17       had Dr. Frazier on the other hand, and you have
18       common sense.  I'm sure you have opinions on whether
19       you believe he was addicted or not addicted, and so
20       I'm going to leave it with you.
21            Let's go to the second part of the first
22       question, because even if Mr. Sury is addicted --
23       again we know even addicted smokers can quit
24       smoking.  So the question is, if so, if he was
25       addicted was cigarette smoking because of such

 1       addiction a legal cause.  So the question there is,
 2       this idea of legal cause, and you'll see in the 3       instruction that legal cause requires a direct
 4       connection, a substantial impact.  Direct
 5       connection, substantial impact.
 6            Now, when you think about this you also need to
 7       think about the fact that plaintiff, plaintiff
 8       counsel has admitted responsibility in this case.
 9       Admitted some responsibility.  And you need to think
10       about what that means.  That means -- it has to mean
11       that Mr. Sury was aware of the health risks and that
12       he was able to quit smoking earlier than he did,
13       because otherwise, if Mr. Sury was not aware of the
14       health risks of smoking, or if he was not able to
15       quit early enough to avoid his illness then why
16       admit any fault whatsoever?
17            If he was too addicted to quit and unable to
18       quit, if he was ignorant of the health risks, then
19       why would he be at fault at all?  So the fact that
20       they're admitting that tells you that he has
21       responsibility, he was aware, and he could have quit
22       earlier.
23            Now, direct connection and substantial impact.
24       What does that mean?  That means that the plaintiff
25       has to prove that Mr. Sury's addiction was so

 1       strong, that it was so powerful that it basically
 2       overcame his freewill.  Basically overcame his
 3       freewill.  He could not stop earlier.  If he could
 4       have stopped earlier then there is no legal cause.
 5            Okay.  Let's go on to the third part, basically
 6       medical causation.  If you find that plaintiff did
 7       not meet their burden of proof on medical causation
 8       because of the lack of the medical records,
 9       questions about the pathology, then the answer is
10       no.
11            So again three-part question.  There's three
12       parts to this.  Plaintiff has the burden on each
13       part.  Each of these words has meaning.  You can
14       tell this is carefully crafted.  Each word has
15       meaning.  Plaintiff has to prove all three parts.
16       So plaintiff has to convince each of you on each of
17       the three parts.
18            If any of you disagree with any one part, if
19       any of you disagree with any one part, or if all --
20       if you disagree, but for different reasons, maybe
21       two of you think, I don't think he was addicted,
22       maybe two of you think, I think he probably was
23       addicted, but, you know, I think he could have quit,
24       and I think he could have quit earlier, and two
25       others might think, you know, I don't think they met

 1       their burden of proof on medical causation,
 2       that's -- that's no.  You don't all have to agree
 3       for the same reason.
 4            Now, we would submit and suggest that the 5       answer here is no.  And just shorthand it and let
 6       you know where I'm going, for a defense verdict it's
 7       essentially no to everything.  You don't necessarily
 8       have to get there, but all the questions for the
 9       plaintiff are yes, all the answers for the
10       defendants are no.
11            We believe you should check no to question 1.
12       That would end the lawsuit right now.
13            Now, if you check yes you're not done.  If you
14       check yes then you go on to questions 2 through 6,
15       which are liability, legal liability.
16            You heard the negligence and strict liability,
17       and that's questions 2 and 3, whether Lorillard --
18       and I put Lorillard up here.  Obviously there is one
19       for Reynolds as well.  And obviously you need to
20       weigh evidence differently against both companies.
21       There's two different boxes to check, and you weigh
22       the evidence separately for both companies.  And
23       this is where the findings come into play that the
24       judge read you and that Ms. Shamp has read you a few
25       times.

 1            But you understand that the findings do not
 2       establish liability.  The findings were generic
 3       findings.  This is Bill Sury's case.  And the
 4       plaintiff still has the burden to prove whether
 5       Lorillard's negligence was a legal cause of Mr.
 6       Sury's death.  And again it's the same legal cause.
 7       It's direct and substantial.  Was Lorillard's
 8       negligence a direct and substantial cause of William
 9       Sury's death?
10            So when you think about this think about press
11       releases.  You remember the press release that Ms.
12       Shamp read to you.  I suspect you're going to see
13       more tobacco company public statements in her next
14       section, her next portion.  Ask yourself, did Mr.
15       Sury hear those?  Did Mr. -- did anybody hear those?
16       I mean, if it's a press release, press releases
17       don't necessarily mean that they get published and
18       picked up by anyone.  If you have a Tobacco
19       Institute pamphlet there's no evidence that Mr. Sury
20       was on the Tobacco Institute mailing list to get
21       those things.  Ask yourself, is there evidence that
22       he ever saw it, that he ever did anything after
23       reading it that made him not quit earlier or make
24       him not stop smoking.  And if you find the answer is
25       no, the answer is no on question 2.

 1            Question 3 I'm going to skip over because it's
 2       the same concept, but it's whether the defective and
 3       unreasonably dangerous cigarettes were a legal
 4       cause.  And there again I think you have been
 5       instructed that you can't hold the companies liable
 6       for the mere sale of cigarettes.  You have to link 7       up -- plaintiff's counsel has to link up a defect to
 8       the injury.
 9            Okay.  So let's go on.  4 and 5 really are
10       together, and with 4 and 5 if you check no, even if
11       you check yes for 2 and 3, if you check no for 4 and
12       5 then there should be no punitive damages because
13       the judge instructed you that you cannot get
14       punitive damages just on the negligence and the
15       strict liability questions.
16            But again fraudulent concealment, these two,
17       concealment and conspiracy really go together.
18       Again legal cause.  Legal cause is a requirement for
19       each of these elements in the verdict form.  And
20       again this -- and you'll see in the instructions,
21       this requires reliance.  This requires reliance,
22       reasonable reliance on behalf of Mr. Sury.
23            So again, did he see it?  Was he looking for
24       information from the Tobacco Institute or the
25       Council for Tobacco Research, or Lorillard,

 1       Reynolds, or any other tobacco company for
 2       information that he needed before he was going to
 3       decide, okay, I'm going to quit?  And if your answer
 4       is no -- if your answer is no, then the answer is no
 5       here, because there is no reliance.  If he's not
 6       relying on information from the companies, waiting
 7       for information from the companies to make his
 8       decision about smoking the answer here is no.
 9            Okay.  Let's move on comparative fault.  We
10       would submit that you should not ever -- you should
11       get here.  Either you answer no to question 1 or you
12       answer no to questions 2 through 6 -- 2 through 5.
13       But if you get to question 6 on comparative fault,
14       again legal cause.  Plaintiff has already admitted
15       responsibility, admits that he was aware and that he
16       could quit.
17            Plaintiff starts off -- because the burden of
18       proof is on the plaintiff, plaintiff starts off with
19       100 percent of the fault.  So even if you answered
20       yes to everything above, you still get comparative
21       fault, and plaintiff has to prove each and every
22       percent that they want to move from them to the
23       defense.  And again you have separate lines for R.J.
24       Reynolds and separate lines for Lorillard Tobacco.
25            Mr. Williams mentioned maybe one way you can

 1       think about that is unclear smoking history, or
 2       things like that.  I'm sure there are a number of
 3       different ways you can look at it.  If you get there
 4       I leave it in your sound discretion on how you
 5       define -- or how you divide up the fault among the
 6       three.  You're the jury.  That's your sound
 7       discretion.  I would submit to you that 100 percent
 8       fault to William Sury. 9            And I'll say this.  I don't like fault.  I
10       don't think Mr. Sury was at fault for smoking.
11       Okay.  Understand that.  Comparative fault is how
12       it's termed under the law.  But I mean if you want
13       to look at this in terms of responsibility and who
14       is responsible, that's the same thing.  But I don't
15       want you to walk out of here thinking that I'm
16       blaming Mr. Sury for smoking.  I think that was his
17       choice.  I think that's a choice that we all have.
18       I think in this country we have freedom of choice,
19       and freedom of choice brings responsibility.  And I
20       think the greatest generation believed in that.  But
21       at the end of the day again this is your decision.
22            Okay.  Damages.  And again understand we're not
23       -- this isn't about valuing Mr. Sury's life, Bill
24       Sury's life.  That's not what this is about.
25       Frankly, that's impossible to do.  But what you need

 1       to understand here are the damages being sought.  So
 2       for example, they're not seeking damages for lost
 3       medical expenses, what they had to pay for medical,
 4       what they had to pay for funeral expenses, and
 5       things like that, lost wages.  That's not being
 6       sought here.  The only thing being sought is the
 7       loss of parental companionship, instruction and
 8       guidance, and for any pain and suffering Dr. Sury
 9       may have felt due to the loss of his father.  It's
10       not any pain and suffering that Mr. Bill Sury may
11       have felt.  It's what Dr. Sury felt.
12            And again you remember even back in voir dire
13       and then I think in the judge's instructions here
14       the only thing you can consider, the only evidence
15       you can consider is when Dr. Sury was on the stand
16       and when he was testifying about the losses that he
17       felt with his father's death, that's -- that's the
18       evidence, that's what you have to -- that's what you
19       would have to consider, and really nothing else.
20            Now, I expect after I sit down that Ms. Shamp
21       is going to get up and she is going to ask for a lot
22       of money.  I would expect that she's going to ask
23       for maybe a million dollars.  She may ask for
24       multiple millions.  I don't know.  We believe that
25       the damages -- again, burden of proof is on the

 1       plaintiff.  We believe that the damages should be
 2       zero.
 3            Look, I understand that a lot of you may not
 4       agree with that.  So let me suggest to you that if
 5       Ms. Shamp stands up and she asks for damages in this
 6       case on this record in the millions of dollars, I
 7       would suggest to you that a more fair and reasonable
 8       amount would be in the thousands.  I mean, not like
 9       five or six thousands, but not the millions, in the
10       thousands.  I think that would be fair, I think that 11       would be reasonable.
12            Again, I don't think you should get here.  This
13       is a hard subject to talk about, but on this record
14       respectfully I think the damages are not in the
15       millions, they're in the thousands.
16            Let's move to question 8, punitive damages.
17       And I suspect that Ms. Shamp is going to spend a
18       fair amount of time of her remaining time on
19       punitive damages.  But what you need to know about
20       punitive damages are that you cannot use the
21       findings on punitive damages.  So those findings,
22       they're completely irrelevant when it comes to
23       punitive damages.  Punitive damages have to be
24       proved, and the burden is on the plaintiff to prove
25       them based on only what you saw in the courtroom

 1       from the plaintiff and from the defense in terms of
 2       entitlement.  And you'll see here the burden, by
 3       clear and convincing evidence it's a higher burden.
 4       It's not the criminal burden, it's not beyond a
 5       reasonable doubt, but it's a higher burden than --
 6       and I think you're going to have the instructions
 7       back with you and you'll be able to see that.
 8            But basically punitive damages requires
 9       reckless disregard to life, conscious indifference
10       to smokers.  Reckless disregard or conscious
11       indifference.
12            Now, I think Mr. Williams stood up -- and we
13       agree that these companies are not perfect.  Did
14       they hold on to some ideas too long?  In 20/20
15       hindsight, probably.  Did people have some stupid
16       ideas in documents in the past?  Probably.  But at
17       the end of the day did it have an impact, was it a
18       legal cause, did it cause Mr. Sury to smoke or to
19       not quit earlier?
20            I want you to consider some of the things that
21       were in evidence.  Again this was Ed Robinson, the
22       Lorillard Company's scientist, in his deposition
23       some of this may have just gone right by you because
24       it's a pretty dry presentation.  You can tell he's
25       not an expert witness, his job is to do science.

 1       But again some of the things that Lorillard has done
 2       over the years I would submit to you do not amount
 3       to conscious indifference, reckless disregard.
 4            You've heard about the Tobacco Working Group.
 5       One of their key members was Lorillard's Dr. Spears.
 6       Now, I'm sure you're probably going to see some
 7       documents from Dr. Spears where he was critical of
 8       the Council for Tobacco Research.  And that was his
 9       opinion, but it is what it is.  But he did good work
10       with the Tobacco Working Group trying to come up
11       with a less hazardous cigarette.
12            Going back to the 1940's Lorillard was doing 13       cooperative research with Ohio State University to
14       try to research what was in tobacco smoke.  The 50's
15       and 60's, you remember Dr. Wynder, Dr. Wynder of
16       Wynder and Graham, the mouse skin painting studies,
17       also did epidemiology studies.  Lorillard actually
18       worked with Wynder and Hoffman, Dietrich Hoffman,
19       another public health researcher, actually would
20       work with them to give them tar from their
21       cigarettes so that they could go do research.  They
22       were trying to do research again to come up with a
23       less hazardous cigarette.
24            You've seen the '63 Lorillard submission to the
25       Surgeon General's advisory committee dealing with

 1       cigarette filtration.  And then even today Lorillard
 2       is working with the Institute of Medicine.  And the
 3       Institute of Medicine Lorillard is working with on
 4       potentially reduced exposure products.
 5            Mr. Williams was talking about the Eclipse
 6       product that heats rather than burns tobacco.
 7       That's an example.  They call PREP, potentially
 8       reduced exposure products.
 9            Again, the company was not perfect.  People
10       aren't perfect.  Companies aren't perfect.  But I
11       submit to you on this record you have no nicotine
12       manipulation, trying -- not perfect, but trying to
13       do the right thing, trying to come up with a less
14       hazardous cigarette, shows that there was not
15       conscious indifference to smokers.
16            Now, I'm about to sit down, and as you know,
17       Ms. Shamp, who's smiling pretty big, she gets to go
18       last, and so obviously we can't respond to what she
19       has to say.  All I ask of you is if you see a
20       document, and if it really bothers you, we can't
21       respond to it, if you want to write it down, if you
22       want to go back and look at it, please read the
23       whole thing before you make any judgments about it.
24       Ask yourself -- somebody -- maybe somebody back in
25       the -- back in the jury room after it's all said and

 1       done be -- play the devil's advocate, what would Mr.
 2       Williams or what would I have said in response to
 3       what Ms. Shamp is saying, because we'll sit down, we
 4       can't say anything.
 5            I really do thank you for your attention, you
 6       guys.  You've been on time, you've been incredibly
 7       attentive, you know, even through videos that aren't
 8       the most exciting thing to watch.
 9            The case boils down to this.  Was Bill Sury
10       robbed of has freewill by nicotine?  I mean, was he
11       a victim of the tobacco companies?  Or was he
12       intelligent, hardworking, successful, a man who made
13       his own decisions, a man who accepted the
14       consequences of his decisions?  Because really 15       that's what I think the case boils down to.
16            Ms. Shamp is going next, and thank you for your
17       time.
