14            Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen.  First, I
15       want to thank you for your attention.  I know you've
16       been paying close attention and there's been a lot
17       of evidence in this case and I see that you've been
18       taking notes and I appreciate that.
19            This is my closing argument so let me begin as
20       I began in my opening argument, let me take you
21       back.  This is a case about Bill Sury.  You have
22       heard the evidence now.  You know Bill Sury was a
23       good man.  He was married for 50 years to a girl he
24       met on a beach in Florida.  In 1941 he went to war
25       when our country did and served in the Pacific.

 1       When he came home after he'd married his wife, he
 2       went to work for the Prudential where he worked for
 3       36 years starting in the mailroom and eventually
 4       becoming an underwriter.
 5            He moved to Jacksonville, Florida, and had a
 6       son whom he raised with compassion and gentleness
 7       who became a doctor.  He was a man who said,
 8       Goodness gracious when he hit a bad shot on the golf
 9       course.  He was an usher in his church.  He was a
10       good man.  And he smoked.
11            We know that he started smoking sometime before
12       he was 21 years old.  We know that he went into the
13       military and smoked while he was in the military.
14       We know that he smoked in the '40s, in the '50s, in
15       the '60s, in the '70s and the '80s.  And we know
16       that in the 1990s he was able to finally quit
17       smoking with the help of a patch.
18            Ladies and Gentlemen, this case is about Bill
19       Sury.  In 1996 he was diagnosed with lung cancer.
20       He battled it.  It finally spread to his brain, and
21       in May of 1997 he died of that lung cancer.
22            This case is about Bill Sury but it's also
23       about the companies -- I'm sorry -- that made the
24       cigarettes that he smoked decade after decade.  It's
25       about those companies and what they told him and

 1       what they didn't tell him.  It's about what they
 2       knew, what they disclosed, what they did.  Their
 3       stories are intertwined, inexplicably intertwined,
 4       inexplicably intertwined, and it's the story of 5       both.
 6            Now, this is my closing argument and I'm not
 7       going to spend my time retelling you all of the
 8       evidence that you've heard over the last three
 9       weeks.  I don't want to do that.  And I've been
10       thinking how can I present this evidence to you in
11       my closing argument in a way that makes sense.  And
12       I think the best way and the way I've decided to do
13       it is to actually look at the things that you're
14       going to be called upon to decide in the verdict
15       form.  And the judge told you about those today.
16            The first issue that you're going to be asked
17       to decide and the judge just discussed it with you
18       was whether Bill Sury is a member of the Engle
19       class.  It's called class membership.  And it's very
20       simple and straightforward in this case.  The judge
21       has instructed you, and you'll have those
22       instructions, of what it takes to be a member of the
23       Engle class.
24            To prove William Sury was a member of the Engle
25       class, plaintiff must prove by a greater weight of

 1       the evidence that William Sury was addicted to
 2       cigarettes containing nicotine, and, if so, that
 3       cigarette smoking because of such addiction was a
 4       legal cause of his lung cancer.
 5            If he's a member of the Engle class, he's
 6       entitled to the benefits of all of these Engle
 7       findings that the judge just instructed you about.
 8       So we'll talk about those in a minute but let's turn
 9       right now to talking about what's going to be the
10       very first question on the verdict form, which is
11       the class membership question.
12            Question number 1 on the verdict form that
13       you'll have with you, it looks just like this, is:
14       Was William Sury addicted to cigarettes containing
15       nicotine --
16            I'm sorry, I have a person down.
17            MS. BRYAN:  There was a power boost.
18            MS. SHAMP:  Just one moment.  I'm sorry.  Thank
19       you.
20            Was William Sury addicted to cigarettes
21       containing nicotine, and, if so, was cigarette
22       smoking because of such addiction a legal cause of
23       his cancer?
24            So how I'm going to start today is to talk to
25       you about what the evidence is with respect to that

 1       issue.
 2            Now, first, I want to talk a moment about
 3       burden of proof because what it says in here is that
 4       plaintiff must prove by a greater weight of the
 5       evidence -- and that's called the burden of proof,
 6       and what it means is simply as it sounds, the 7       greater weight must be on the side that you decide
 8       for.  And since we're in a courtroom I like to use
 9       the scales of justice.  If you put all the evidence
10       on one side of the issue on this side of scales and
11       the evidence in the other, you have to decide where
12       the weight is.  It's not a criminal case, it doesn't
13       have to be beyond a reasonable doubt, but simply the
14       greater weight of the evidence.  Where does the
15       greater weight of the evidence fall.
16            So let's talk about what the evidence is with
17       respect to the issue of addiction.
18            What did we learn about nicotine and addiction?
19       Most of it is absolutely undisputed in this case.
20       What we learned is that nicotine is addictive.
21       Every witness who came in here testified as to that.
22       All the documents that we put in said that.
23       Nicotine is addictive.  There's no question about
24       that.
25            And nicotine changes the brain.  And you'll

 1       remember Dr. Frazier talking about how it changes
 2       the brain and how it releases -- nicotine releases
 3       dopamine into the brain and then that dopamine
 4       changes the control center of the brain.  I thought
 5       this was a fascinating piece of testimony because
 6       lots of things we do release dopamine.  We eat, it
 7       releases dopamine; we do something pleasurable, we
 8       play golf, it releases dopamine.  But those things
 9       don't change our brain the way a drug does.  And
10       nicotine changes the control center of the brain.
11            And you'll remember she put up this slide and
12       she talked about how they can actually look through
13       PET scans at the nicotine action on the control
14       center of the brain.  And nicotine actually hi-jacks
15       the brain into thinking that that substance is
16       important for survival because the control center of
17       the brain controls those things we do in order to
18       survive, and that's why somebody who is addicted --
19       who is addicted is unable to do the things they nor-
20       -- you can normally do, like control the behavior in
21       the same way because that drive is not just a matter
22       of what you want to do or choose to do, it's a brain
23       chemistry that is compelling you to do this.
24            This is not disputed, Ladies and Gentlemen,
25       that nicotine does this to the brain.  And you'll

 1       have with you the 1988 Surgeon General's Report
 2       which talks about this.  It actually talks about
 3       they believe there might be a genetic component to
 4       it.  This is an -- undisputed that nicotine makes an
 5       actual physical change in the brain.
 6            We also know that 40 percent of smokers try and
 7       quit every single year, but only 2 to 3 percent are
 8       successful.  This is a strong addiction.  This is 9       not disputed by anybody in this case.  You'll
10       remember Dr. Burns came in and testified about that.
11       And you'll also remember it's in the Surgeon
12       General's Report in 1988.  40 percent try to quit
13       every year but only 2 to 3 percent are successful.
14       It is a strong addiction, as Dr. Frazier said,
15       similar to heroin and cocaine in the way it affects
16       the brain and causes that draw.
17            We also know that the longer you smoke and the
18       more you smoke, the greater the likelihood is of
19       being addicted.  That's undisputed and that's in the
20       Surgeon General's report, too.  People who smoke
21       longer, people who smoke more over years, over
22       decades, have a stronger addiction and they're more
23       likely to be addicted.
24            We also learned -- I thought this was a
25       fascinating part of the evidence -- that addicted

 1       smokers need a specific dose of nicotine every day
 2       and that's why -- and I always wondered this, why is
 3       it that when you ask somebody how much they smoke,
 4       they generally can tell you what they smoke every
 5       day.  I smoke a pack a day, a pack and a half a day,
 6       two packs a day, a half a pack a day.  We learn
 7       that's because the dosage is a dosage of nicotine
 8       that they need to get in order to satisfy the
 9       nicotine receptors in their brain every day.  We've
10       got a slide about that, y'all remember Dr. Frazier
11       talking about how when you smoke the nicotine, it
12       fills up these nicotine receptors in the brain and
13       that tells you, Okay, I'm satiated now and as time
14       goes by, after you've stopped smoking, those
15       nicotinic receptors get empty and the brain tells
16       you to fill them up again, and that's why there's a
17       specific dose every day that people smoke.
18            So the next question.  Was Bill Sury addicted?
19       What is the evidence we have of that?  We know how
20       much he smoked.  He smoked a pack and a half every
21       day for over 30 years, every day.  That's not
22       disputed.  The amount he smoked, a pack and a half a
23       day every day for 30 years, and we have that from
24       his son, Dr. Sury, who testified.  We also have it
25       from his golfing buddies about how much he smoked.

 1       He smoked a lot.
 2            We also know how often he smoked, his smoking
 3       habits.  He smoked first thing in the morning, as
 4       soon as he got up.  You'll remember that testimony,
 5       he had a bathrobe on and he'd come out of room, his
 6       bedroom with a cigarette in his mouth.  First thing
 7       in the morning as soon as he got up he smoked.
 8            We know he smoked throughout the day.  He
 9       smoked in his office, we saw the picture of him at
10       his desk with his ashtray next to him, you'll 11       remember the testimony from Rob Sury when he would
12       go see him as a child that he smoked there in the
13       bullpen and then all the co-workers around him
14       smoked.  He smoked throughout the day.
15            We also know that he smoked in the evening when
16       he came home, sat in his easy chair, watching
17       television.
18            We even know that he smoked at night.  That he
19       sometimes would wake up from his sleep and smoke.
20       Remember the testimony from Rob Sury when they would
21       go on vacations and they would be staying in the
22       same room in the hotel and he could see the light
23       from the end of the cigarette of his dad waking up
24       in the middle of the night to have a cigarette.
25            We also know he smoked on the golf course.

 1       You'll remember Nancy Montgomery testified he smoked
 2       a cigarette every hole and then he would smoke more
 3       af- -- during lunch and more when they played pool
 4       afterwards.  So we have evidence of how much he
 5       smoked over how long a time.
 6            We also know that he made multiple attempts to
 7       quit smoking.  You'll remember the testimony from
 8       Dr. Sury that he would make a New Year's resolution
 9       to put it down and then he would go around the house
10       and throw away all the ashtrays and throw away the
11       cigarettes and he wanted to stop then and put
12       everything out of his mind but wasn't able to
13       succeed.
14            And I thought it was a poignant story that Dr.
15       Sury told when he remembered as a child going out to
16       the garage and seeing his father who had attempted
17       to stop in the corner of the garage smoking
18       cigarettes.
19            And we also know that he was finally able to
20       quit in 1995 but only with the help of the patch.
21       And we know the patch wasn't available in -- until
22       1991, the end of 1991, and he started using it in
23       1992.  So we know that the patch, which gives him a
24       dose of nicotine, was what he needed in order to cut
25       down and finally be able to stop.

 1            So we have this evidence as to how Bill Sury
 2       smoked and that he was addicted.
 3            So we called to the stand Dr. Sandra Frazier to
 4       talk about what this means with respect to
 5       addiction.  And you'll remember Dr. Frazier who came
 6       in and testified, and Dr. Frazier was an addiction
 7       specialist.  You'll remember, she had board
 8       certification in addiction medicine.  It was her
 9       specialty.  And she worked at an addiction clinic
10       and she helped other healthcare providers deal with
11       their substance abuse problems.  She is an addiction
12       specialist.  And she testified that Bill Sury was 13       addicted.
14            And her testimony was based on the amount he
15       smoked, how he smoked, first thing in the morning,
16       during the day, and her knowledge of nicotine
17       dependence and brain structure, she said there was
18       absolutely no question in her mind that Bill Sury
19       was addicted to cigarettes.
20            And she also showed us the interesting tool she
21       used, which was the DSM-IV, and you'll remember her
22       talking about that and it's a gray book that we put
23       up there and she said there's seven things, seven
24       criteria, and if you meet three of the seven, then
25       you can be diagnosed as addicted.  She said he met

 1       six of the seven criteria, that's why I've got
 2       checks up here.
 3            You'll remember the criteria of tolerance
 4       meaning that over time when he first started he
 5       couldn't have smoked a pack and a half a day because
 6       that's actually a toxic amount.  So he met the
 7       criterion of tolerance, meaning he adapted and was
 8       able to smoke a pack and a half.
 9            He had withdrawal symptoms or he smoked in
10       order to avoid withdrawal symptoms.  And that
11       testimony came about him smoking first thing in the
12       morning, that that's a characteristic of someone
13       who's fighting off that withdrawal system by having
14       your cigarette as soon as you wake up.  And you
15       remember she said that most smokers will tell you
16       that feels the best to them because it satisfies
17       those receptors in the brain?
18            That he smoked for longer period than he
19       intended.  And she talked about his quit attempts
20       with that one.  That he made efforts to control his
21       smoking but was unable to.
22            Now, this one is the -- the -- I think, the
23       easiest to check off there and that is time spent.
24       And the criterion is is that if you spend a lot of
25       time in either trying to get the substance or using

 1       the substance, then you meet that criteria.  And
 2       you'll remember her talking about that if you take,
 3       I think she said, 7 to 10 minutes to smoke a
 4       cigarette and you multiply that by 30 cigarettes a
 5       day, that's 270 minutes, which is four hours that he
 6       spent, that much time, 270 minutes, every day
 7       smoking.  So he clearly met the time spent category
 8       in there.
 9            Now, she said there wasn't information about
10       reduced activities because back then when he was
11       smoking you could do it just about everywhere.  You
12       could smoke at your office.  You could smoke in
13       theatres.  You could smoke on airplanes.
14            But she also said he met the seventh criteria, 15       which is continued use, despite knowledge that it
16       might be causing you some physical disturbances.
17            Now, the reason I actually put double checks up
18       here is because you'll remember Dr. Giakas, the
19       defendants' addiction expert, he testified that, in
20       fact, Bill Sury met number 1 and number 2.  Even his
21       testimony is that he met number 1 and number 2.  But
22       Dr. Giakas said that he wasn't addicted because he
23       didn't meet any of the others.
24            Dr. Giakas testified that he didn't meet the
25       time spent one, that using over four hours a day, in

 1       his mind, didn't meet the time spent.
 2            We think the evidence is very clear that Bill
 3       Sury met the DSM-IV and that he was addicted to
 4       cigarettes.
 5            Now, I talked about the greater weight, so
 6       let's talk for a minute about what the defendant put
 7       up and the defendants are going to argue to you, I
 8       suspect, that Bill Sury wasn't addicted to
 9       cigarettes.  I believe the defendants are going to
10       argue that he smoked, not because of nicotine, not
11       to get nicotine, but simply because he wanted to or
12       he liked it.
13            And what did they bring you?  They brought you
14       Dr. Giakas to put on the other side of the scale the
15       things I just talked about.
16            Dr. Giakas is not an addiction specialist.
17       He's not worked in an addiction clinic.  He's what I
18       would call a run-of-the-mill psychiatrist.  I think
19       he said his specialty was actually in geriatrics.
20       He has no specialty in addiction.
21            And I found it almost shocking that when we
22       asked him if he had read the Surgeon General's
23       Report of 1988, which is the report on nicotine and
24       addiction, that he had not even read it.
25            He's not studied addiction, he's not read about

 1       addiction, he's not written about addiction, he
 2       doesn't have a degree in addiction but he came in
 3       and told you that Robert Sury -- I mean, that Bill
 4       Sury was not addicted to nicotine.
 5            But what did he base that on?  There it is.  I
 6       think maybe we have a faulty cord there.
 7            But what did he base that on?  He based it on
 8       one thing, you'll remember his very first slide that
 9       Dr. Giakas put up, and he said he based the fact he
10       wasn't addicted because he was able to quit.  He
11       said, I believe he controlled -- he could control
12       his smoking behavior because in 1995 he was able to
13       quit and so my opinion he could have quit anytime
14       because he quit in 1995.
15            Now, I want to talk for a minute about that
16       because not one witness in this case, including 17       Dr. Giakas, has said that an addicted smoker cannot
18       quit.  Nobody has said that.  Everybody agrees that
19       addicted smokers can quit and they do quit every
20       day.  Just because somebody quit, does not mean that
21       they're not addicted.
22            Think about his testimony.  His testimony is,
23       If you quit, and we know millions have, you're not
24       addicted, right, because you can control your
25       smoking decision.  So if you quit, you're not

 1       addicted.
 2            But if you don't quit, like he did in the '60s
 3       and '70s, well, you aren't addicted, you just didn't
 4       want to.  He tries to have it both ways.  He tries
 5       to say that, Well, if you don't quit, you're not
 6       addicted because you just didn't -- you weren't
 7       motivated enough and if you do quit, then,
 8       obviously, you can quit so you weren't addicted.
 9       According to Dr. Giakas nobody's addicted to
10       nicotine.  Under Dr. Giakas's theory, no one is
11       addicted.
12            And if you remember we asked him, What do you
13       base this on that he smoked for some reason other
14       than nicotine?  Ms. Bryan asked him that question.
15       Why, if he smoked a pack and a half a day every day
16       for 30 years, wouldn't it make more sense if he
17       wasn't addicted and he wasn't smoking for nicotine
18       that he'd smoke five one day, ten one day, two packs
19       one day?  He gave -- the only thing he said --
20       whoops.  The only thing he said was that he thought
21       people smoked for other reasons like -- and I
22       thought maybe it was even silly what he said.  He
23       said, Because they like the smell of it, because
24       they like the way their hand goes back and forth to
25       their mouth, maybe there is somebody who smokes for

 1       those reasons, but what basis does he have to come
 2       and give you testimony here in this courtroom that
 3       that's why Bill Sury smoked?  None.  That's pure
 4       speculation as to any reason other than nicotine.
 5            But, Ladies and Gentlemen, we don't have to
 6       rely upon either Dr. Frazier or Dr. Giakas because
 7       the Surgeon General of the United States of America
 8       has talked to us about it and you'll have that with
 9       you.
10            Now, I'm going to say right now that when I
11       talk about documents, these go back into the jury
12       room with you and just because they're up here on
13       the board doesn't mean they actually don't exist
14       physically, and you'll have them in the jury room.
15       And we have notebooks with tabs on them, I'm told,
16       and the tabs will let you find where the document
17       is.
18            This is P-487 and you'll have that document 19       back there with you.
20            And what the Surgeon General of the United
21       States says is that nicotine addiction is the
22       fundamental reason that individuals persist in using
23       tobacco products.
24            We don't even have to rely on that.  The
25       defendants, themselves, have talked about this very

 1       issue over and over in the documents that you'll
 2       have back with you.  I won't do all of them but I
 3       will read some of them to you.
 4            This is from P-302, and it says the tobacco
 5       industry may be thought of as a specialized, highly
 6       ritualized, and stylized segment of the
 7       pharmaceutical industry.  Tobacco products uniquely
 8       contain and deliver nicotine, a potent drug, with a
 9       variety of psychological effects.  Happily for the
10       tobacco industry, nicotine is both habituating and
11       unique in its physiological actions.
12            P-285.  It must be assumed that nicotine is the
13       sine qua non.  I might have this up on the slide.
14       This is the one that says it was a potent drug.
15       Nicotine is the sine qua non.  That means -- it's
16       Latin, it means without which it's nothing; without
17       which it's nothing.  And their own documents say it
18       must be assumed that nicotine is the sine qua non of
19       smoking.
20            An RJR document, 301, In theory and probably in
21       fact a given smoker on a given day has a fixed
22       per-hour, per-day requirement for nicotine.  I
23       believe that for the typical smoker nicotine
24       satisfaction is the dominant desire as opposed to
25       flavor or other satisfaction; therefore, it is the

 1       primary reason smokers smoke.  These are their own
 2       documents.
 3            Lorillard document P-881, Undoubtedly nicotine
 4       serves the primary role in cigarette smoking.
 5            Lorillard document.  Tobacco scientists know
 6       that physiological satisfaction is almost totally
 7       related to nicotine intake.
 8            They know that nicotine is addictive, it's a
 9       powerful drug, and a person that smokes a pack and a
10       half a day for 30 years is addicted.
11            We believe that the greater weight -- the far
12       greater weight of the evidence in this case shows
13       that Bill Sury was addicted.
14            But that's not the only part of question 1.
15       Question 1 has two parts.  So I'm going to go to the
16       second part now.
17            Was William Sury addicted to cigarettes
18       containing nicotine and, if so, was cigarette
19       smoking because of such addiction a legal cause of
20       his death? 21            So let's talk about that.  We brought in four
22       pieces of evidence that prove not only that smoking
23       caused his lung cancer but that he died as a result
24       of the lung cancer caused by smoking.  We brought to
25       you Dr. Alan Marks.  And you'll remember Dr. Marks

 1       is the doctor who signed his death certificate.  And
 2       you'll have the death certificate with you in the
 3       jury room.  It's P-1, our very first document, the
 4       death certificate.  And the death certificate says
 5       that he died as a result of squamous cell cancer of
 6       the lung to the brain, primary in the lung.
 7            And you'll remember Dr. Marks' testimony.  It
 8       was very short, he only testified, I think, 20 or 30
 9       minutes, it was very short testimony, but he said
10       that he died as a result of lung cancer, that lung
11       cancer was the primary, and that his lung cancer
12       came from smoking cigarettes.  That was his
13       testimony.
14            We also brought you Dr. Richard Grochmal.  Now,
15       Dr. Richard Grochmal was important for a different
16       reason because Dr. Grochmal, you'll remember, he was
17       the primary doctor.  He was the doctor that Bill
18       Sury first went in to see when he was weak and he
19       had gotten weak on the golf course.  And what
20       Dr. Grochmal did, he testified, is he did a chest
21       x-ray and that he found a mass and he testified that
22       he found one lung mass, he suspected by the look of
23       it that it might be malignant and it might be
24       cancer, he found it in his lung and he sent him to a
25       pathologist -- I mean, sent him to get a biopsy.

 1            There was a biopsy done of the lung tissue
 2       which said it was cancerous and then he was treated
 3       for that cancer of the lung.  So we brought you the
 4       death certificate and we also brought you the
 5       pathology report.  And this is the report that says
 6       he has cancer of the lung.
 7            You'll remember that when Dr. -- when
 8       Dr. Grochmal testified, he said it was a large
 9       tumor.  He said it was four-by-six centimeters and
10       that's in inches, I believe, about an
11       inch-and-a-half-by-two-and-a-half inches.  That's a
12       large tumor in the lung.  And that's important
13       because as Dr. Sury told you, they told him then it
14       was inoperable.  They couldn't operate to try and
15       save him, to try and save him.  It was at that point
16       inoperable.  So they gave him radiation treatment
17       but they didn't operate.  And that helped.  The
18       testimony was that it helped but then it eventually
19       spread to his brain.
20            We believe that is sufficient evidence to find
21       he died from lung cancer as a result of smoking, two
22       witnesses, both -- the one who signed the death 23       certificate who said smoking caused this lung cancer
24       and the doctor who diagnosed him, to send him to --
25       got a chest x-ray and saw this chest x-ray showed a

 1       mass, and got the pathology.  Both of them said that
 2       he had lung cancer as a result of smoking.  Two
 3       doctors who came in who, one, saw him, and the other
 4       who saw the medical records.
 5            You'll remember Dr. Marks said he looked at the
 6       medical records when he was making out the death
 7       certificate.  He looked at the medical records he
 8       had in front of him.
 9            Now, the defendants are going to come in and
10       argue that he didn't die from lung cancer.  And they
11       brought to you Dr. Stonesifer.  I like
12       Dr. Stonesifer, but they brought in Dr. Stonesifer
13       who gave a very interesting lecture about
14       adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma and
15       had the pictures.  You'll remember, he talked about
16       the water bottle being a sweat gland.  That's a
17       complete red herring to anything you have to
18       decide -- everybody doesn't use the word red
19       herring, but it means something to throw you off the
20       scent.  It's something that doesn't have anything to
21       do with anything.
22            He said he thought it was the adenocarcinoma
23       instead of squamous cell carcinoma.  I guess that's
24       something pathologists might disagree about, whether
25       it was a squamous or whether it was adeno.  And he

 1       looked at the things, and he was very knowledgeable
 2       about it, I don't deny, maybe it had some
 3       adenocarcinoma features about it but so what?
 4       Because when Ms. Bryan got up to cross-examine him,
 5       he said both adeno and squamous cell were lung
 6       cancers, squamous cell and adenocarcinoma are both
 7       lung cancers, okay?
 8            Okay.  Both adeno and squamous cell can be
 9       primary lung cancers.  Okay.  She asked him the
10       third question, Can both adeno and squamous cell be
11       caused by smoking?  Yes, they both are.  The fact
12       that it was adeno versus squamous cell carcinoma
13       makes absolutely no difference in this case.  It's
14       lung cancer caused by smoking.
15            Now, I think the suggestion that they were
16       trying to make was that it could not -- it might
17       have come from somewhere else in his body and it not
18       be a lung cancer but be a spread, a spread from
19       somewhere else in his body, right?  And we know that
20       can happen.  You can have a cancer in your stomach
21       or in your kidney or your pancreas and it can spread
22       to your lung or your brain or somewhere else.  So he
23       was trying to suggest that this wasn't a primary
24       tumor as both Dr. Marks said and Dr. Grochmal said 25       but it came from somewhere else.

 1            Well, Dr. Stonesifer, as he testified, said, I
 2       can't tell if it was primary to the lung or
 3       somewhere else just looking at this little bitty
 4       slide because that's all he had.  That's all he had
 5       to testify about was the little slide.
 6            And we don't deny that if you hand somebody a
 7       slide, that you might not be able to tell by looking
 8       at that slide whether it was cancer starting in the
 9       lung or starting somewhere else.  But we have a lot
10       more in this case other than that little slide that
11       Dr. Grochmal had and Dr. Marks had.
12            First, we know that the tissue that he sampled
13       came from the lung.  We know that from the pathology
14       report that this was lung tissue that was brought
15       up.  Now, when you look at the slide, you might not
16       be able to tell that, it might look all the same,
17       but we know because we have the pathology report
18       that it is lung tissue.
19            We also know that there was no other tumor
20       anywhere else in his body.  There's not one shred of
21       evidence in this case that he had any other tumor
22       anywhere else in his body, none.
23            And we know importantly that this was diagnosed
24       and treated as a primary lung tumor.  And you'll
25       remember it was important and we talked about that

 1       nowadays they're much more careful about
 2       distinguishing between an adeno and a squamous cell.
 3       Ms. Bryan went into that with the witness.  Because
 4       treatment has changed over the 14 years.  And now
 5       you actually treat the adeno a little differently
 6       than you treat squamous cell so now they're more
 7       careful.  But in 1995 they weren't that careful in
 8       distinguishing between the two because the treatment
 9       would be the same.
10            But what they were careful about in 1994 -- I
11       mean, 1997, was knowing that it was the primary
12       tumor because that is treated differently and so the
13       doctors diagnosed it as the primary.
14            And what do we know about what they did to
15       diagnose it as the primary?  Well, one, we know that
16       Dr. Grochmal looked at the chest x-ray and there
17       were no other tumors anywhere on that.
18            We know that Dr. Grochmal examined his patient
19       because he said that he did.
20            But we also know from Dr. Stonesifer, which I
21       didn't pick up on until the testimony yesterday,
22       that there are actually bone marrow slides.
23       Somebody actually -- you remember that testimony?
24       He said 17 slides total but only 10 or so of them
25       are from the lung and the others are from bone
4506 1       marrow.  They were searching in this man's body for
 2       other tumors.  They looked in the bones.  They
 3       looked other places.  There was no other tumor and
 4       there's no evidence in this case that there was any
 5       other tumor.
 6            But even more importantly we know from the time
 7       of diagnosis, which was in January of 1996, he lived
 8       for another year and a half, and no other tumor ever
 9       showed up.  If this came from somewhere else, if he
10       had stomach cancer or some other kind, at some point
11       in that year and a half it would have shown up.
12            The only tumor he had was the lung cancer that
13       eventually spread to his brain.  No other tumor, no
14       other cancer.  The argument that this was something
15       other than a primary is red herring that they are
16       trying to throw in now.  It has nothing to do with
17       the facts of this case which you got from two
18       doctors who swore under oath.
19            But perhaps the most important thing here is
20       not what Dr. Stonesifer said but what Dr. Stonesifer
21       didn't say.  Dr. Stonesifer did not say that this
22       wasn't the primary tumor.  He never said this -- he
23       could have, I guess.  They could have brought in
24       somebody that said, In fact, this is actually a
25       stomach cancer, he did not say that.  All he said

 1       was, Based on this slide, I can't be certain it's a
 2       primary.  He didn't say it was a stomach cancer.  He
 3       didn't.  So any argument that they make that this
 4       was not the primary tumor is a pure red herring.
 5            You have the evidence and the far greater
 6       weight of the evidence that this was a primary lung
 7       tumor caused by cigarette smoking.
 8            And I want to talk just one minute about -- to
 9       remind you about some testimony we heard a long time
10       ago from Dr. Burns about how cigarette smoking
11       causes lung cancer.  You'll remember these slides
12       early in the case, how the smoke actually paralyzes
13       the cilia that cleans out the lungs and that then
14       the carcinogens in the smoke can land on the lung
15       tissue and start to cause damage, start to cause
16       changes in the structure of the cells, themselves.
17       Those eventually turn into metaplasia as he
18       described it and eventually a carcinoma of the lung.
19       You heard that testimony as to how it causes lung
20       cancer.
21            But you also heard him say that 85 to 95
22       percent of lung cancers are caused by smoking
23       cigarettes and almost all lung cancers in smokers
24       are caused by smoking.
25            We believe the evidence is overwhelming that

 1       Mr. Sury was addicted to cigarettes and that -- that
 2       smoking cigarettes caused his lung cancer and that 3       the answer to question number 1 is yes.
 4            So now I'll move to question number 2 on the
 5       verdict form.
 6            Well, first, so once it's determined that Bill
 7       Sury was a member of the class, then, as the judge
 8       has instructed you, plaintiff is entitled to the
 9       benefits of the Engle findings.  So, now, these are
10       findings that the judge instructed you you must
11       accept as true:  Smoking cigarettes causes lung
12       cancer.  Nicotine in cigarettes is addictive.  The
13       defendants placed cigarettes on the market that were
14       defective and unreasonably dangerous.
15            Fraud by concealment.  That all defendants
16       concealed or omitted material information not
17       otherwise known or available knowing that the
18       material was false or misleading, or failed to
19       disclose a material fact concerning the health
20       effects or addictive nature of smoking cigarettes or
21       both.  That's already been determined that they
22       concealed or omitted important information.
23            And that they conspired.  That all defendants
24       agreed to conceal or omit information regarding the
25       health effects of cigarettes or their addictive

 1       nature or both with the intention, intending that
 2       smokers would rely upon that information to their
 3       detriment.  All of the defendants were negligent.
 4            And the judge has instructed you.  You'll have
 5       these instructions back with you.  These findings
 6       may not be denied by the defendants.  They may not
 7       be questioned by the defendants.  They must carry
 8       the same weight they would have if you had
 9       determined them yourselves.
10            So let's move forward and talk about the
11       verdict form with respect to what the next questions
12       are with the benefit of the Engle findings.
13            Question 2 is negligence, whether the
14       negligence was a legal cause of death.
15            And question 3, as the judge has instructed
16       you, strict liability, whether the defective and
17       unreasonably dangerous cigarettes were a legal cause
18       of William Sury's death.  These questions are easy
19       and they go together.
20            If you find that smoking cigarettes caused his
21       death, then the question -- the answer to question 3
22       and the answer to question 2 is yes, because that's
23       already been established that they were negligent
24       and that they placed defective cigarettes on the
25       market.  So if you find, as you did with respect to

 1       finding 1, that smoking cigarettes caused his death,
 2       then the answer to both question 2 and question 3 is
 3       yes.  Those are easy if you find that he died of
 4       smoking cigarettes as a result -- of lung cancer as 5       a result of smoking cigarettes.
 6            Let's turn to questions 4 and 5.  And question
 7       4 and 5, I think, is where the defendants are going
 8       to argue most strenuously and you've heard a lot of
 9       testimony in the trial about and, that is, whether
10       what Reynolds -- you have two questions, one for
11       Reynolds and one for Lorillard, Whether their
12       concealment or omission of material fact was a legal
13       cause of William Sury's death.
14            Now, they obviously can't dispute this part.
15       They can't dispute that they concealed or omitted
16       material information.  The judge instructed you
17       about that.  And they can't dispute that the
18       material information that they withheld was not
19       otherwise known, that they withheld information that
20       the public did not know.  They cannot dispute that.
21       They will but the judge has instructed you that they
22       cannot dispute or question that part of the
23       findings.
24            So what is RJR and Lorillard's defense to this?
25       I call it the everybody knew and Bill Sury knew.

 1            Well, there's a couple problems with their
 2       defense.  Now, I want to mention, first, here that
 3       this is not about comparative fault.  This isn't
 4       about whether Bill Sury has some responsibility.  We
 5       get to that question later on.  This question is
 6       about whether they have any responsibility because
 7       they denied under question 4 that they have any
 8       responsibility at all because basically what they
 9       argue is it didn't matter if we lied, it doesn't
10       matter what we said, it doesn't matter what we did,
11       because it didn't cause Bill Sury to keep smoking
12       because he already knew.  That's their argument.
13            Now, importantly, we don't have to prove that
14       they're lying, that their fraudulent concealment was
15       the only cause of his death.  We've admitted he
16       bears some responsibility.  All we have to prove is
17       it was a cause, a contributing factor.
18            Now, as I said, they've got two problems with
19       their argument.  The first problem with everybody
20       knew is the Engle findings because the Engle
21       findings tell you that it was not otherwise known.
22       But the other problem with their argument is they're
23       going to stand up and say everybody knew smoking was
24       bad for you, everybody knew smoking was hazardous.
25       But what they didn't know is that there were known

 1       carcinogens in cigarettes that they identified from
 2       the early 1950s.
 3            What they didn't know, but they knew, was that
 4       smoking filters didn't make a difference because
 5       people compensated by smoking them deeper, you'll
 6       remember that testimony.  And what they didn't know 7       was the addictive nature of the cigarettes, that it
 8       was an addictive drug.
 9            So let's talk first about the everybody knew
10       defense and you know this defense, they're going to
11       stand up here and talk about it.  They'll even put
12       up that Dan Horn quote again where he said, If you
13       shout it from the rooftops -- remember that quote
14       they put up?  If you shout it from the rooftops, you
15       wouldn't be telling anybody they didn't know --
16       anything they didn't know and so it's Dr. Reynolds'
17       (sic) testimony, it's the Newsweek articles that
18       they keep putting in, it's the New York Times
19       articles.  So I want to talk about this, Ladies and
20       Gentlemen, a piece at a time.  I want to talk about
21       what they said.
22            I want to talk about what they knew and I want
23       to talk about it in the 1950s first, what they knew.
24       You're going to have with you the Teague memo, which
25       is Exhibit P-161 and in the Teague memo it says

 1       that, The studies indicate smoking causes lung
 2       cancer in the 1950s.  And what they said, they
 3       submitted the Frank Statement, which is P-175, which
 4       says, There's no proof that cigarette smoking is a
 5       cause of lung cancer.
 6            But, third, in the '50s what did people think?
 7       You will have with you the document I used with
 8       Dr. Riddell, P-217, and what it shows is people
 9       thought in the 1950s -- this is a study that was
10       done in 1959, there was surprisingly little concern
11       in the 1950s about the health aspects of cigarettes.
12            What happened in the 1960s?  In the 1960s they
13       knew.  You'll have two very important documents,
14       which are P-203 and P-233, which talk about the
15       carcinogens in their smoke, that they knew there was
16       17 known carcinogens in their smoke, 17
17       cancer-causing agents.
18            The Rodgman memo says that, We know that the
19       overwhelming evidence indicts cigarette smoking as a
20       cause of lung cancer.  You will have these documents
21       back there that they knew.
22            But what did they say?  Ready?
23            This is in 1964.  Well, this is what he said.
24       He said that, If we -- you'll remember his
25       testimony, you'll remember, and you will actually

 1       have this clip back in the jury room with you so you
 2       can play it, and what he says is, If there's
 3       anything found in cigarettes that's harmful, and we
 4       don't think there is, we'll take it out.  That's
 5       what he said in 1964 when sitting in the files of
 6       R. J. Reynolds are their documents saying that we
 7       know that 17 known carcinogens in our smoke.
 8            And he stands up there and says to the American 9       people, If we find anything in there, we'll take it
10       out.
11            But what were people thinking in the 1960s?
12       What did people think after the Surgeon General's
13       report came out?  Well, we brought you a study and
14       the study shows that among smokers, which Bill Sury
15       was at that time, the question was asked, Do smokers
16       live as long as -- smokers don't live as long as
17       others because they smoke?  Only 12 percent said
18       yes.  Only 12 percent thought that smokers didn't
19       live as long because they smoked in the -- I think
20       this is 1968.  And 61 percent said that they don't
21       believe that smokers don't live as long or they
22       don't know.
23            In the 1970s, what they knew.  In 1979 a
24       Surgeon General's Report came out.  This is P-351,
25       which you'll have back with you, where it says --

 1       this document is significant for another reason.  It
 2       demolishes the claims made by cigarette
 3       manufacturers and a few others 15 years ago and
 4       today, that the scientific evidence is sketchy, that
 5       no link between smoking and lung cancer was proven.
 6       Those claims, empty then, are utterly vacuous now.
 7       1979 they clearly knew that smoking caused lung
 8       cancer.
 9            But what did they say.  This is one of my
10       favorite documents, this is P-298.  This is a press
11       release from the Tobacco Institute.  In pursuing
12       their press conference science, some government
13       officials maintain that cigarette smoking is the
14       number one public health problem.  We believe that
15       the number one problem is the extent to which these
16       officials knowingly mislead the American public.
17            But what did people think?  We've shown you
18       evidence, again, from document P-931, that the
19       overall saliency, meaning the importance to the
20       American public, of the cigarette issue comparing
21       cigarette and health is low.
22            Even in the 1980s, Ladies and Gentlemen, what
23       they were saying --
24            A VOICE:  We're plugged in.  I don't know.
25            THE COURT:  Let me tell you this.  We're going

 1       to need to take a break anyway.
 2            MS. SHAMP:  I might be stepping on something.
 3            THE COURT:  Ms. Shamp, I'm going to take --
 4            MS. SHAMP:  Okay.
 5            THE COURT:  -- a ten-minute break, just a
 6       ten-minute break.  You can go into the jury room and
 7       you can use the facilities or what have you and
 8       we'll come on back at 20 minutes after 10.
[#DELETED RECESS#]
 7            MS. SHAMP:  Thank you, Your Honor.
 8            Let me first say I apologize.  It was actually
 9       me stepping on something down there, so I think
10       we've prevented that for now.
11            I think where I was was we were in the 1980s.
12       We talked about what they knew, what they said, what
13       people knew from the '50s, '60s, '70s.  What about
14       1980?
15            (A video clip was played and transcribed by the
16   court reporter to the best of her ability as follows:)
17            UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  "...does not cause
18       cancer, yes or no?"
19            UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  "It is not known whether
20       cigarettes cause cancer."
21            UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  "All right, sir."
22            UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  "It has not been
23       causally established."
24            (The video clip was ended.)
25            MS. SHAMP:  In 1980 on purpose they were

 1       telling the American people a lie.  Their own
 2       documents dispute that.  And on purpose they were
 3       telling the American people that smoking did not
 4       cause cancer.
 5            But what did people know in 1980?  Even as late
 6       as 1980, we have -- we brought you P-932, which is a
 7       study that The Tobacco Institute did in 1980.  And,
 8       ladies and gentlemen, even as late as 1980 -- and
 9       you'll remember what they said, that non-smokers and
10       smokers thought differently about it.  But in 1980,
11       smokers, only one-third, only 33 percent of them,
12       believed that smokers died sooner as a result of
13       smoking.  Two-thirds of them didn't believe it even
14       then.
15            Now, I want to talk to you about the evidence
16       they brought in on the subject of everybody knew.
17       And most of what Dr. Riddel said I did not agree
18       with.  But there was one thing she said that I
19       caught, and I thought it was interesting.
20            You know how they put up throughout this trial
21       all those Newsweek articles, those Reader's Digest
22       articles, all of those things which were supposed to
23       convince you that everybody knew smoking was bad for
24       you, in the '50s, in the '60s.  In every one of 25       those articles Dr. Ridell said -- in every one of

 1       them there would be a statement by the tobacco
 2       industry.
 3            And she put up this.  I didn't.  But in every
 4       one of them there'd be a statement by the tobacco
 5       industry that says, "It's not true.  Hasn't been
 6       proven.  It's not the last word."
 7            And it worked.  Not everybody, but some people
 8       believed what the tobacco companies were saying.
 9            Let's talk about the quality of evidence they
10       brought you with respect to this notion that
11       everybody knew that smoking was hazardous.
12            They brought you Dr. Ridell.  You all remember
13       her.  She's an agricultural economist.  Her degree
14       was in agricultural economy.  You remember that.
15       She'd never written anything about tobacco until the
16       tobacco industry contacted her.
17            But where did she get her information?  All of
18       the information that she testified about there was
19       handed to her by the lawyers.
20            You'll remember when she talked about the
21       Gallup polls.  And my first question out of my mouth
22       was who was Paula Noble, I think her name was.  It
23       was a Shook Hardy -- Shook Hardy, a law firm -- that
24       was a Shook Hardy research assistant.  On all those
25       Gallup polls, they were printed out by the lawyers

 1       and given to her.
 2            I asked her where she got the Newsweek articles
 3       that she relied upon, all of those articles.  She
 4       couldn't find them in her library -- remember
 5       that? -- so Shook Hardy gave them to her.
 6            And remember the study that she relied upon?  A
 7       study that was funded by Jones Day, the law firm
 8       Mr. Williams works for.
 9            All of the information that she stood up there,
10       an agricultural economist, told you about was handed
11       to her by their lawyers.  She wasn't an expert.
12       She's not got independent information to bring to
13       you.
14            But most telling was that when I showed her
15       these three studies that I just talked to you about,
16       these three studies which were done for The Tobacco
17       Institute, which were titled "A Study of Public
18       Attitudes Toward Cigarette Smoking," "A Study of
19       Attitudes Toward Cigarette Smoking," she said she'd
20       never seen them and she didn't rely on them.  They
21       were unrelied on.
22            Does that sound like an expert, who only looks
23       at what the lawyers give them, who doesn't go out
24       and do independent looking to try to find out what
25       was happening, and who's done absolutely no research
4526 1       in the area or writing in the area until she's
 2       contacted and paid by the tobacco companies?
 3            But it really begs the question.  Because the
 4       question is whether anything they did kept Bill Sury
 5       smoking, even a little bit longer.  It's the cause
 6       question.  Are those lies they told important?  If
 7       they kept them smoking even a little bit longer.
 8       And, ladies and gentlemen, they want you to say no.
 9       They want you to say, "All our lies don't matter,
10       because everybody knew."
11            They want you -- they put up here every witness
12       and asked them, "Was he an intelligent man?"  Why
13       would they ask them whether Bill Sury was an
14       intelligent man?  Because they want you to believe
15       that, "As many lies as we told him, he was too
16       intelligent to believe them."
17            I call this the big brother defense.  When I
18       was a -- I have three big brothers, and when I was a
19       kid, a little girl, one of my brothers told me the
20       meaning of a four-letter word, but he told me wrong.
21       And that day when I went to school and I repeated it
22       and got in trouble and went to the principal's
23       office, my mother called us both into the living
24       room.
25            And my brother was like, "Mom, she should have

 1       known better.  She should have known it wasn't the
 2       truth."
 3            And my mother looked at my brother and said,
 4       "Shame on you.  Shame on you for blaming her for
 5       believing you."
 6            And that's stuck with me all these years.  It's
 7       about integrity.
 8            Their defense is that Bill Sury shouldn't have
 9       believed their lies.  This is important for them.
10       It's an important defense they spent a lot of time
11       on.  They spent a lot of time on it because what
12       they're telling you is, "It doesn't matter if we
13       lied, because it didn't cause him to smoke more
14       cigarettes."  What they're trying to tell you is,
15       "So what?  So what if we lied?  So what if we told
16       the American public in 1980 that we don't know that
17       smoking causes cancer?  So what?  Because if it
18       didn't cause Bill Sury to keep smoking, it makes no
19       difference."
20            And frankly, ladies and gentlemen, that's a
21       hard burden for us.  It's a hard burden for us
22       because Bill Sury's no longer here.  He's dead.  And
23       anything he might have said to somebody else is
24       hearsay.  We can't bring it in.
25            It's a hard burden for us to prove that their

 1       lies were a cause of him continuing to smoke.  But
 2       fortunately in this case we can do it.  We can prove 3       that their lies made a difference, and we've got
 4       evidence to prove it.
 5            In 1964 we have evidence to show -- Mr. Sury
 6       testified -- Dr. Sury said that when his parents saw
 7       the 1964 Surgeon General's Report, they were
 8       shocked.  They were shocked by what they were
 9       seeing.  That at that point they didn't know that.
10       That they didn't know.
11            So we have that evidence, that 1964 they were
12       shocked.  And then we have evidence that he switched
13       to Kent.  You remember that.  He'd been smoking
14       Raleighs before that, and in the mid '60s he
15       switched to Kent.
16            And you'll remember testimony about what Kent
17       was saying -- what Lorillard was saying about Kent
18       cigarettes.
19            "You can see the proof of Kent's health
20       protection."  This was in the 1950s.
21            "Your voice of wisdom says, 'Smoke Kent.'"
22       Your voice of wisdom's telling you.
23            1960.  "All over America, more scientists and
24       educators smoke Kent with the Micronite filter."
25            What -- they were saying that their cigarettes

 1       were safer.  He switched to Kent.  And he was
 2       smoking Kent.
 3            And even though you have with you -- you
 4       remember the trunk document that Mr. -- that
 5       Dr. Goldberg pulled out of the trunk.  And this is
 6       P-930 where it says in here that they need to stop
 7       saying that.
 8            And you'll remember the Kent document.  All of
 9       us are aware Kent was marketed as a safer cigarette.
10       This is proof that their actions did cause him to
11       keep smoking.  Rather than quitting, he switched to
12       Kent, the safer cigarette.
13            What else do we have?  What other proof do we
14       have?
15            We have the 1969 tomato ad.  You remember what
16       Dr. Sury talked about as a child.  He was 13 years
17       old, sitting at the kitchen table, and his dad saw
18       this ad and showed it to him.
19            Just enough to create doubt.  That's what they
20       were trying to do.  Just enough to keep him smoking
21       a little bit longer.
22            Now, this was put out by The Tobacco
23       Associates, Inc., which are the growers, which, as
24       you'll remember, were part of the Frank Statement,
25       were part of the group that initially came up and

 1       hired Hill & Knowlton to put out this effort of
 2       disinformation.  And this was part of their efforts.
 3       And we know Bill Sury saw it.
 4            But you don't have to take our word for it. 5       They themselves have told you that doubt is their
 6       product.  This is a document, P-486, and you'll have
 7       it back in the jury room with you, when they say,
 8       "This is what we're selling, ladies and gentlemen.
 9       We're selling doubt.  Doubt is our product, since it
10       is the best means of competing with the body of fact
11       that exists in the mind of the general public.  It
12       is also the means of establishing a controversy."
13            It did make a difference.  They were selling
14       doubt.  Bill Sury bought it and kept smoking.
15            We also know that Bill Sury looked at the tar
16       charts.  Dr. Sury testified that he and his dad
17       together were looking at the charts in there to try
18       and figure out what was the least dangerous
19       cigarette.  And we know at that same time that they
20       knew it wasn't safer, that they knew that smokers --
21       just because that thing said lower tar, that smokers
22       would smoke more to get the nicotine and have the
23       same amount of tar in their lungs.
24            Bill Sury didn't know that, and he looked at
25       the tar charts and he switched to Doral.

 1            Ladies and gentlemen, it's not a lot of
 2       evidence that we've got, but it's enough.  It's
 3       enough to keep them from winning the big brother
 4       defense.  It's enough to keep them from arguing that
 5       their lies don't matter.  Because in this case we
 6       know that they matter.  We have the proof that it
 7       did cause him to keep smoking.
 8            And as we said -- we'll talk about comparative
 9       fault later.  And we don't have to prove on
10       Questions 4 and 5 that it was the only cause, but if
11       their lies were a contributing cause or just a part
12       of it, you should check "Yes" on 4 and 5.
13            Now, they're going to make a big deal and they
14       have made a big deal throughout this case about the
15       fact that Bill Sury was in the insurance business
16       and he was an underwriter.  But what's the evidence
17       about that issue and is it really, really relevant
18       to the question?
19            What we know -- what we know is that he was an
20       underwriter, not an actuary.  And the Judge actually
21       cleared that up when there was a mistake.  He was an
22       underwriter, not an actuary.  He didn't set
23       actuarial tables.  We know he was in the bullpen,
24       not an executive.  And we know from Dr. Sury's
25       testimony that Prudential didn't set differential

 1       rates for smokers.
 2            What they have brought you is innuendo
 3       suggesting -- I thought it was really interesting.
 4       They tried to get that insurance evidence in all the
 5       time.  The Judge sustained objections.  They tried
 6       to get it in with Dr. Goldberg -- 7            MR. WOODS:  Objection, Your Honor.
 8            MR. WILLIAMS:  Objection.
 9            MR. LATHAM:  Objection, Your Honor.
10            THE COURT:  Excuse me.
11            MR. WOODS:  Sidebar about this.
12            THE COURT:  Let me just say something.
13            Sustained.
14            Ladies and gentlemen, you do not consider
15       anytime I object or -- I mean, anytime I sustain or
16       overrule an objection.  You just consider the
17       evidence that comes before you.
18            Thank you.
19            MS. SHAMP:  They didn't bring in any evidence
20       about insurance rates.  They didn't bring in any
21       evidence from anybody.  Just innuendo, just
22       supposition that Bill Sury had any greater knowledge
23       because he was in the insurance business.
24            And they could have brought in that evidence.
25       They could have brought in somebody who would have

 1       sat up on the stand and given insurance testimony
 2       and said, "Now, we knew back then insurance rates
 3       were set differently" -- they didn't bring in
 4       anything.  They want to bring it in through
 5       innuendo.  But the innuendo proves that in fact he's
 6       looking at the tomato ad in 1969.
 7            The only evidence they have is from Dr. Sury,
 8       when he was a child, when he was 13 years old, going
 9       in and looking at his dad's books.  And you'll
10       remember what he said about that, that in his dad's
11       books that there were optional points that could be
12       awarded for clean living, for somebody who didn't
13       smoke, didn't drink; that clean living you could
14       give an extra bonus point for.
15            That's the only evidence in this case that Bill
16       Sury knew the risks.  And that's up against what our
17       testimony -- the actual testimony of what he did,
18       how he expressed shock, how he switched to Kents,
19       and how he looked at the tar charts and to select a
20       cigarette that was lower in tar.
21            One thing I'm going to ask you to do is when
22       Mr. Williams is up here talking, ask yourself, "Is
23       that the big brother defense?  Is that the defense
24       that our lies don't matter because Bill Sury was
25       intelligent and he should have known?"

 1            We think the evidence shows they shouldn't get
 2       away with the big brother defense, that the weight
 3       of evidence, that the greater weight of the evidence
 4       shows that Question Number 4, whether RJR's
 5       fraudulent concealment or omission of a material
 6       fact about the health effects or addictive nature of
 7       smoking cigarettes was a legal cause of William
 8       Sury's death for both RJR and for Lorillard.  We 9       think the answer to those questions is "Yes."  And
10       that's an important answer for this case, because if
11       you check "No" on those answers, then it means their
12       lies don't matter.
13            Fraudulent concealment, conspiracy, is the same
14       question.  It's just whether they did it together.
15       And the Engle findings show that they did do it
16       together.  So if you check "Yes" on 4, you should
17       check "Yes" on 5 as well, that they conspired
18       together to conceal material information about the
19       health effects and addictive nature of smoking
20       cigarettes.
21            Next I want to turn to comparative fault.  And
22       this is an important piece in this case, because we
23       told you from day one that we accepted some
24       responsibility for Bill Sury not quitting earlier,
25       and from day one they have denied any responsibility

 1       or any fault for any of their actions.
 2            But what the jury instructions tell you is it
 3       is a comparison that you need to look at.  Compare
 4       the fault of Bill Sury against the fault of
 5       Lorillard and RJR.  And we think you have enormous
 6       evidence to do that.  You're going to have notebooks
 7       and notebooks of documents.
 8            And I know I showed you just a few of the
 9       documents about -- when I went through the '50s and
10       '60s and '70s.  You know there were lots of them.
11       And you'll have them back in there, and I encourage
12       you to look through them.  It's document after
13       document where they knew the effects, where they
14       were telling people -- they were issuing press
15       releases, where they were killing stories about the
16       health consequences and they were trying to
17       influence various news outlets not to put the
18       information out.  Lots of evidence out there.
19            But what I'm going to ask you to do on this
20       comparative fault is to compare Lorillard's and
21       RJR's fault against that of Bill Sury's.
22            So what do we know about what Lorillard and RJR
23       did?  Well, according to the Engle findings, they
24       concealed or omitted -- this is the Engle findings,
25       something you can't question -- with the intention

 1       that smokers would rely -- and that's important
 2       because it shows not only bad conduct but
 3       intentional bad conduct, that they did it on
 4       purpose.  But not only that, it's that smokers would
 5       rely to their detriment.
 6            In other words, the Engle jury found not only
 7       that they fraudulently covered up and concealed and
 8       omitted information, but that they did it in order
 9       to make smokers believe them.
10            They're going to come in and say, "Well, none 11       of them did.  Bill Sury didn't believe us."  But the
12       Engle jury found that they did it with the intention
13       that the smokers would rely on it.  And we think the
14       evidence in this case shows that that intention was
15       carried out, that in fact Bill Sury did rely on it.
16            Also the evidence that they manipulated the
17       level of nicotine in order to keep people addicted.
18       And we showed you a lot of documents about that.
19       They're in the 800 series, the P-800 series, where
20       they were adding nicotine at certain points in order
21       to keep the target dose of nicotine a certain way.
22       Intentional conduct to manipulate the level of
23       nicotine in order to keep smokers addicted.
24            We need to compare that to Bill Sury.  We've
25       admitted he should have stopped smoking sooner and

 1       he didn't.
 2            But what is the evidence?  One, the way he was
 3       able to stop finally was with the help of the patch.
 4       And it wasn't even available until 1992 -- 1991,
 5       beginning of 1992.
 6            We know that he got hooked while he was in the
 7       military serving our country and that he got
 8       cigarettes in his rations.
 9            We know that every year 40 percent of smokers
10       try to quit, but only 2 to 3 are successful.
11            So, yeah, we accept some responsibility for
12       Bill Sury not being able to be in that 2 to 3
13       percent.  It's a tough call.  It's a tough stand.
14       But we accept some responsibility for him not being
15       in that 2 to 3 percent.
16            But goodness knows, it wasn't intentional.
17       Goodness knows, when compared to the conduct of what
18       they did, it comes nowhere close.
19            We believe he should hold some responsibility,
20       but we believe the lion's share should fall on RJR
21       and Lorillard.  Not just because of the impact of
22       it, but because of the intentional nature of it; his
23       conduct in not stopping sooner compared to the
24       intentional conduct of what they did.
25            You'll have Question Number 6 where you'll have

 1       to allocate the fault, the percentage of fault that
 2       was a legal cause of William Sury's death that you
 3       charge to RJR, Lorillard and William Sury.  And,
 4       ladies and gentlemen, we're going to put that in
 5       your hands.  You assess the apportionment that you
 6       think is right.  We suggest to you that Bill Sury
 7       should be charged between 10 and 20 percent, in that
 8       range, and that Lorillard and RJR are responsible
 9       for 40 to 45 percent.
10            Whatever you put has to add up to a hundred.
11       Whatever you say would be the appropriate amount,
12       we'll accept.  And as we said from the beginning, we 13       accept some responsibility.  The defendants have
14       accepted none.
15            Now, the last two things I want to talk
16       about -- it says "end" up there, which means I'm
17       almost done.
18            The last two things I want to talk about are
19       the last two things on the verdict form.  And one is
20       damages.  And you're going to be called upon to
21       assert -- to put in a blank how much damage the
22       plaintiff is entitled to as a result of his death.
23            And you have with you the mortality tables
24       which are Plaintiff's Exhibit 11, and these
25       mortality tables show that at the time of Bill

 1       Sury's death he had a life expectancy -- he should
 2       have lived a normal life expectancy, if he had not
 3       died, of an additional 8.9 years.  You have to look
 4       it up in these tables based on his age and his race
 5       and his gender, but it's 8.9 years, so 9 years
 6       basically.  He had nine years left to live.
 7            And the testimony in the case is that he loved
 8       life, that he was healthy, that he enjoyed golfing,
 9       that he enjoyed spending time with his son, and that
10       he had no other major illnesses until he was
11       diagnosed with lung cancer.  The testimony is that
12       he and his son had a very close relationship.  They
13       lived together.
14            And I'll talk more about this later.  I should
15       have mentioned this at the beginning, but the way
16       this process works is that I get to speak first and
17       then Mr. Williams speaks and Mr. Woods speaks, and I
18       get to come back again at the end and sum up.  And
19       so when I do that, I'm going to talk a little more
20       about that damages, talk a little bit more about
21       what we're going to ask you for with respect to
22       that.
23            And I'm also going to talk to you about the
24       last question on the verdict form, which is the
25       punitive damages.  And what punitive damages are is

 1       an award based -- and the Judge has already
 2       instructed you about that, but it's an award based
 3       on the conduct of the defendant.
 4            We believe this case has ample evidence that
 5       the jury should award a punitive damage award.  And
 6       I'm going to talk in length about the reasons for
 7       that when I have an opportunity to get back up after
 8       they talk.
 9            But right now I'm going to sit down and let
10       them talk, and then I'll be able to come back and
11       speak with you.
12            I appreciate your attention.  Thank you.


14            MS. SHAMP:  Thank you, Your Honor.
15            One of the very first things that John Williams
16       said was that Ms. Shamp might not respond to
17       everything I said, and if she doesn't then think
18       about what she didn't respond to.  And they've
19       talked for over 3 and-a-half hours, so I'm not going
20       to respond to everything that he said.  I'm just
21       going to hit a few of the important points, and then
22       I'm going to talk a little bit about punitive
23       damages and about damages.
24            I think David Woods acknowledged this, but Mr.
25       Williams didn't, and that is that this case isn't

 1       just about Bill Sury, but it's about them as well,
 2       and their conduct.  And you've seen very little from
 3       them.  And when you go back in the jury room you're
 4       going to have very few documents that they admitted
 5       in evidence that are their documents, that are
 6       documents from Lorillard or from R.J. Reynolds.
 7       Those all came in from me.
 8            Just a quick point.  He said that he advanced
 9       up at Prudential, and I was thinking about that
10       trying to remember the testimony along with Ms.
11       Bryan.  We were trying to remember it together, but
12       we didn't have to, because Mr. Woods put it on a
13       board that Mr. Sury actually advanced to underwriter
14       in 1959, and he never got another promotion after
15       that until he retired in 1982.  So his promotion up
16       the ladder was all the way up until 1959 when he
17       became an underwriter, and he was in the bullpen.
18       But up until 1959 he stayed in the same job from 19       1959 until 1982.
20            They mentioned everybody, this common
21       knowledge, and what Hal Rush said about it was
22       common knowledge back when we were a kid that
23       smoking was hazardous.  Well, if you remember what
24       the testimony was about that, Dan Sury talked about
25       it as well, and he said, yeah, we knew smoking was

 1       bad for us because it would make us short of breath,
 2       we couldn't play as much football maybe, not that we
 3       knew that there were known carcinogens in there or
 4       that we knew that it caused lung cancer.
 5            And again throughout Mr. Williams' and Mr.
 6       Woods' arguments they continued to do what the judge
 7       has instructed you they cannot do, and that is
 8       question the Engle findings that they --
 9            MR. WOODS:  Objection, Your Honor.
10            MR. WILLIAMS:  Objection, Your Honor.  We have
11       not.  May we approach?
12            THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, this is
13       argument.
14            And the instructions, let's talk about the
15       instructions that I have read to them.
16            MS. SHAMP:  Right, Your Honor.
17            THE COURT:  Thank you.
18            MS. SHAMP:  They continue to question the Engle
19       findings, and the Engle findings, ladies and
20       gentlemen, are binding upon you.  They are binding
21       upon you, and thus the argument -- now, we've got it
22       over there, it was up on the board, and that is that
23       they withheld material information that was not
24       otherwise known.
25            So despite all the Reader's Digest ads and all

 1       the Newsweek and all the Times magazine articles
 2       they put in, the Engle findings, which bind you,
 3       tell you that the information they withheld was not
 4       otherwise known, and that's because they withheld
 5       not the sort of in the air kind of I think smoking
 6       is bad for you, but they withheld specific
 7       information about their product, about carcinogens
 8       in their product, and about the addictive nature of
 9       their product.  There are specific things about
10       their product that they withheld that were not
11       otherwise known.
12            He started with the Frank Sinatra thing again,
13       and he said that, you know, this was in the time
14       when Frank Sinatra was singing, and he did that From
15       Here to Eternity clip.
16            Do you think that Frank Sinatra knew that
17       cigarettes caused lung cancer?  Frank Sinatra was
18       actually on the ads for the cigarettes.  So was Dick
19       Van Dyke.
20            And the other thing they want you to try and 21       believe is that they engaged in this elaborate
22       public relations campaign which we put on evidence
23       about.  They hired the best public relations firm in
24       the city of New York, Hill & Knowlton, Madison
25       Avenue top of the line.  They hired them to put out

 1       this message.  But what they want to stand here and
 2       tell to believe is that that wasn't really
 3       important, nobody was listening to us, we didn't
 4       care, everybody already knew.  They engaged in this
 5       elaborate scheme and put out these booklets, A
 6       Scientific Perspective on the Cigarette Controversy.
 7       These will all be in evidence with you.  P182.  The
 8       Smoking Controversy, A Perspective, a 1978 document,
 9       which is P347.  Smoking and Health, a Continuing
10       Controversy, from the Tobacco Institute, which is
11       P348.
12            They want you to believe that they spent all
13       the money, that these were actually sent -- you'll
14       actually have the document that shows how many
15       copies of those were made.  200,000 copies were
16       made.  But they want you to believe, and he's going
17       to stand up here and tell you, that didn't make any
18       difference, nobody read those things, nobody cared
19       about them, everybody knew.
20            But I have one -- but they were trying to sell
21       doubt.  That's what they were trying to sell.  All
22       along they were trying to sell doubt.  I showed you
23       the Doubt is Our Product document.  But I want to
24       point you to document 168, which is a memorandum
25       that they said, because what they were trying to

 1       tell people was, we want to instill this question in
 2       them so that they will keep smoking.  And they
 3       write:  There is only one problem, confidence; and
 4       how to establish it, public assurance; and how to
 5       create it.  It is perhaps long interim when
 6       scientific -- in this perhaps long interim when
 7       scientific doubts must remain, and most important
 8       how to free Americans from the guilty fear that is
 9       going to arise deep in their biological depth
10       regardless of any poo-pooing logic every time they
11       light a cigarette.
12            They were trying to sell doubt.  Now, I think
13       they tried to suggest -- and I might jump around a
14       bit because I'm trying to address the points he
15       said.
16            They were trying to suggest I think about the
17       patch.  Well, Dr. Giakas himself said when Mr. Sury
18       stopped he was using the patch, based on the
19       brother's testimony, Dan Sury, that William Sury had
20       used the patch.  They talk about whether we said it
21       was 30 years back, when it was longer than that.
22            The reason we used the 30 year timeframe -- I 23       want to make that very clear -- is that was the
24       first time that Robert Sury was old enough to watch
25       his father smoke, and that was in 1964.  So the 30

 1       year pack and-a-half a day history that we talk
 2       about is only because that's when Robert Sury was
 3       able to testify about the amount and the length of
 4       time he was smoking.  But we know he was smoking
 5       long before that, because we have pictures of him
 6       smoking on the beach in 1941, not just one pictures,
 7       and you'll have those pictures back with you, but
 8       many pictures, and we have all the pictures of him
 9       smoking in the military as well.  But I wanted to
10       clear that up, because the 30 years is just based
11       upon when Robert Sury was old enough to observe his
12       father smoking.
13            They want to frame the question, ladies and
14       gentlemen, as whether or not -- and I wrote it down.
15       The question was whether he wanted to quit, whether
16       he was in control.  That's not the question that's
17       on the verdict form.  The question on the verdict
18       form is whether he was addicted to cigarettes.  And
19       I went through all of that evidence before, but
20       that's the question you're going to be asked to
21       decide, not whether he wanted to quit or whether he
22       could have quit.  The question on the verdict form
23       is whether he was addicted to the nicotine in
24       cigarettes.
25            They talk about Hal Rush and Yancey Montgomery

 1       who came in here, but you'll remember that both of
 2       them said that he very well could have been trying
 3       to quit and they not known it.  Both of them said
 4       that.
 5            Now, they've asked you to look at the polls in
 6       depth, and I say, please do.  Look at these polls.
 7       They're going back there.  Because I think it's very
 8       interesting for you to know that the polls that I
 9       put in and that I asked you about you'll have back
10       in evidence.  The Gallup polls that they have talked
11       about aren't back in evidence with you.  These are
12       the polls that you're going to have back in
13       evidence.
14            And I want to point out -- he read to you from
15       the Gallup poll, and I want to point out on page
16       31 -- because he said that in the Gallup poll it
17       said everybody knew that smoking was hazardous.
18       What it said on page 31 is:  While cigarettes are
19       regarded as bad for you to a greater extent than
20       other products we asked about, there is a striking
21       little concern about the health aspects.
22            Then the second point was:  What concern there
23       is in the health scare seemed largely directed at
24       the avoidance of throat irritation. 25            That's what the poll says that they knew in

 1       1959, what the public was aware of in 1959.  Not
 2       lung cancer, but throat irritation, when we know
 3       that the Rodgman memo in 1956 showed that there's 17
 4       known carcinogens in their cigarette smoke and that
 5       they didn't tell anybody about that.
 6            They want to make a lot about this issue of
 7       studies.  I think John Williams went on and on about
 8       studies, and he actually talked about the Hutchinson
 9       study.  And I was surprised he was talking about the
10       Hutchinson study.  You remember him saying about the
11       Hutchinson study and there was this one study and
12       that what we want to talk about are these consensus
13       documents?  The Hutchinson study is not in evidence.
14       You won't have the Hutchinson study when you go
15       back.  What you will have are the Surgeon General
16       reports.  You will have the consensus documents, not
17       the one study written by one or two authors.  The
18       studies that are written by the consensus of the
19       American scientific community when they put together
20       the Surgeon General's report.
21            He also talked about Project 16.  And you
22       remember him talking about that.  But you'll also
23       remember on Goldberg's direct -- and Project 16 was
24       whether that study was done by R.J. Reynolds which
25       targeted 16 year old children.  But you'll remember

 1       -- and you'll have this document, the '94 Surgeon
 2       General's report.  And on page 175 it talks about --
 3       you can look on page 175, the youth target study 87,
 4       which was an R.J. Reynolds study.  The youth target
 5       study, where they looked at the effects of cigarette
 6       advertising on subjects from the ages of 15 to 24
 7       that R.J. Reynolds did.
 8            Well, the other thing I think both Mr. Woods
 9       and Mr. Williams made a big deal about, and that was
10       that filters are -- and I believe they actually said
11       this, that filters are actually safer for you.  That
12       is not the evidence in the case.  In fact, the
13       evidence in the case is quite the contrary.  The
14       evidence in the case is that filters actually have
15       had no difference on safety.  And you have that in
16       the 2010 Surgeon General's report.
17            Right.  The 2010 Surgeon General's report says
18       it right here on page 37:  Unfortunately with the
19       accrual and evaluation of additional data the
20       evidence today does not demonstrate that efforts to
21       lower nicotine measured -- lower machined measured
22       tar and nicotine yields actually decrease the health
23       risks of smoking, primarily because these changes
24       did not reduce smokers actual exposure to tobacco
25       toxicants.  Indeed to the extent that filters and
4706 1       other efforts to reduce machined measured tar and
 2       nicotine reduced smokers' health concerns and
 3       thereby delayed quitting and/or increased cigarette
 4       use they may have contributed to overall increase in
 5       cigarette-caused mortality.
 6            It also says that:  The tobacco industry
 7       documents, many of which are available on the legacy
 8       documents library, clearly demonstrate that at least
 9       by the mid 70's the tobacco industry well understood
10       the importance of creating health reassurance
11       messages in order to alleviate health concerns, and
12       the one important method of doing so was claims of
13       low deliveries of tar.  For example, in 1977 the
14       British American Company marketing report concluded
15       that all work in this area should be directed toward
16       providing consumer reassurance.
17            It says that the tobacco industry knew -- and
18       you can read this on page 175 -- that the lower tar
19       and nicotine cigarettes did not produce any health
20       benefits, and that the tobacco industry knew that,
21       because they knew that people compensated.
22            I think he -- Mr. Williams maybe misspoke.  He
23       also said that nobody saw The Frank Statement.
24       That's what he said, he said nobody saw The Frank
25       Statement, which was published in every newspaper in

 1       a city of more than 50,000 residents.  It was
 2       published in every single newspaper during that day.
 3            Now, the FTC reports that he talked about, they
 4       are actually in evidence in this case, and they will
 5       show you that in '94 the tobacco industry was
 6       spending 4 billion dollars a year on advertising,
 7       but the value, the total value of people who were
 8       switching from one to another was only 650 million.
 9       And so the '94 study, and the '94 Surgeon General's
10       report, and Monograph 19 talk about that marketing
11       and advertising does in fact increase tobacco use.
12       It does, and the industry well knows it, and that's
13       why they spend the money.  They don't spend that
14       kind of money just to get people to switch from one
15       brand to another brand.
16            The testimony in the case about Dorals, Dr.
17       Sury testified that his father smoked Dorals from
18       about 1969, '70 all the way until his death, and he
19       also smoked Kent.
20            I think Mr. Williams must have misread the
21       national life statistics table, which you'll have
22       back.  He said it was seven years.  But if you look
23       very clearly, you have to look at a white male who
24       was 77 years old at the time, and if you look across
25       there it's 8.9 years that he had left to live, not

 1       seven.
 2            And Mr. Woods said there at the end of his 3       presentation that Mr. Sury never picked up a
 4       cigarette before 1941.  There is no evidence of
 5       that.  In fact, what we do know is that by 1941 he
 6       was already smoking.  We don't know when he started,
 7       but he was already smoking by that time, and the
 8       evidence in this case from every witness is,
 9       including the Surgeon General's report, is that
10       almost all smokers, 85 to 90 percent, start in their
11       teens.
12            Now, the Kent ads that were also interesting.
13       Mr. Woods talked about how those Kent ads had to be
14       stopped in 1955 because the FTC put a stop to it and
15       wouldn't let them use those health protection ads.
16       We showed you ones that went not only to 1960 but
17       '64, through that time, because they still were
18       advertising their micronite filter all the way
19       through the 60's.  You'll remember, you'll have it
20       back there, the P21's are the ads, but there's the
21       Bob Cousy ad, remember the basketball player, and
22       that's a '64 ad, and the science ad I showed in the
23       first part of my opening, the 1960 ad.
24            You'll also have document 367, which is the FTC
25       report, and Mr. Woods touched on it.  But the FTC

 1       report -- what the FTC report said, and you'll
 2       remember we put this in evidence, is that the
 3       tobacco industry spends in one day in advertising
 4       what the public health community spends in an entire
 5       year.  In one day they spend what they spend in an
 6       entire year.  And Dr. Goldberg testified I think
 7       accurately that the public health message was
 8       overwhelmed by the cigarette advertising message.
 9            You also have document 343 back with you, and
10       this you'll remember was in evidence, this is a 1978
11       document which says in it:  Very few consumers are
12       aware of the effects of nicotine, its addictive
13       nature, and that nicotine is a poison.
14            The tobacco industry itself is telling them
15       they don't know, people don't know the addictive
16       nature of cigarettes.  And that's exhibit 343.
17            Finally I want to talk a little bit more about
18       the -- Mr. Woods mentioned that we didn't bring a
19       pathologist in.  We brought in two doctors who gave
20       unequivocal testimony that this was a primary lung
21       cancer caused by smoking.  They brought in on the
22       other side a pathologist who only looked at the
23       slides and who said not that this wasn't a primary
24       tumor, only that based on this he couldn't tell.
25            So now after I've talked about that I want to

 1       move to a little bit about damages.  Ladies and
 2       gentlemen, I think there's a whole host of reasons
 3       in this case that plaintiffs are entitled to an
 4       award of punitive damages for the defendants' 5       conduct.  And punitive damages, as the judge has
 6       already instructed you in his instructions, and it's
 7       at the back of the page, punitive damages are
 8       warranted if you find by clear and convincing
 9       evidence.  And then the instructions give four
10       different reasons, and I want to focus on number 3
11       of those reasons.
12            Number 3.  The conduct showed an entire lack of
13       care that R.J. Reynolds and Lorillard must have
14       wantonly or recklessly disregarded the safety or
15       welfare of the public.
16            So what is the evidence that R.J. Reynolds and
17       Lorillard disregarded the safety and welfare of the
18       public?  That's what I want to focus on.
19            First, marketing to kids.  The evidence is
20       overwhelming that both Lorillard and R.J. Reynolds
21       have marketed to youth.  You have seen those
22       documents, and there are many of them, not just the
23       seven.  I'm going to focus on a few of them.  First
24       I want to focus on the '94 Surgeon General's report.
25       There is an entire chapter which talks about the

 1       marketing of cigarettes to kids by the tobacco
 2       companies.  Part of it is what I just read.  This
 3       document says they're marketing to children.  Right.
 4       But we don't have to listen to them, because we have
 5       their own documents.  Their document, which I showed
 6       you, document 309, plaintiff's 309, which says --
 7       and I commend you to read the entire document,
 8       because the entire document is talking about how to
 9       prey upon the weakness of adolescents by creating a
10       brand that kids will want to smoke.  This entire
11       document talks about that, and frankly it's
12       reprehensible.
13            What it says here is:  A new brand aimed at the
14       young -- he's talking about how to make this brand
15       appealable -- should not in any way be promoted as a
16       health brand, and perhaps should carry some implied
17       risk.  In this sense the warning label on the
18       package may be a plus.
19            It talks about how children during this period,
20       adolescents, are insecure, and so they need to
21       market their product to try and capitalize on their
22       insecurity and make them have a greater sense of
23       self image.  This is a very damaging document for
24       them, and it talks about the teens that they promote
25       to.

 1            Also a Lorillard document -- and I just picked
 2       a few out, ladies and gentlemen.  There are lots of
 3       them back there.  But the Lorillard document from
 4       '78 says:  The base of our business is the high
 5       school student.  And that's document -- that's
 6       August 30, 1978, the Curtis Judge document. 7            The Hilton Head document.  This was to the
 8       board of directors.  This is not just a low -- this
 9       is a presentation to the board of directors of R.J.
10       Reynolds, which was done at Hilton Head in 1974,
11       where they talk about how we're going to market to
12       14 year olds.  Then it also talks about they're
13       going to insert additional ads in magazines like
14       Sports Illustrated, Playboy, and Mist, magazines
15       that they know there's a youth readership of.  This
16       is document 316.
17            There is lots of youth marketing documents.
18       You'll have them all back.  And the Surgeon
19       General's report.
20            The fundamental fact is that the tobacco
21       industry knows it, and it's in the Surgeon General's
22       report, is they have to get replacement smokers.
23       And they call them replacement smokers in some of
24       the documents we put up in front of you.  Smokers
25       die and smokers quit, and the place they get

 1       replacement smokers is kids, and they know it, and
 2       they target their targeting efforts at kids.
 3            The second reason we believe we're entitled to
 4       punitive damages, because of their reprehensible
 5       conduct, is the manipulation of nicotine in their
 6       cigarettes.  And you'll have many documents, and
 7       they start -- I've written down a list of them:
 8       Documents 862, 871, 872, 874, and all of them talk
 9       about how they were trying to control the level of
10       nicotine in their products.
11            Experiments have indicated that free nicotine
12       can be added at almost any place in the
13       manufacturing process.  An investigation into
14       increasing the nicotine content of our present type
15       of reconstituted tobacco has been made.  Nicotine
16       was added to all three batches of the slurry.  This
17       is called the nicotine enrichment project.
18            And then my favorite, which is document 874,
19       which says:  In any case, information we gain on the
20       mechanism nicotine activity may be useful in
21       determining how to adjust the physiological impact
22       in our cigarettes.
23            That's what they wanted to do, to adjust the
24       physiological impact of their cigarettes, to adjust
25       the nicotine level to keep people addicted.

 1            The third reason we think we're entitled to
 2       punitive damages is that the only time the cigarette
 3       manufacturers have ever put warnings on their
 4       products, that they ever communicated warnings was
 5       when they were forced to.  You'll remember the
 6       testimony from Lorillard's corporate reps, you'll
 7       remember the testimony from R.J. Reynolds, when the
 8       warnings were proposed they opposed them.  Contrast 9       that to what you see today amongst manufacturers of
10       products.  It happened just this weekend I noticed
11       with a toy, that there was a concern that a toy on
12       the shelf might cause a choking hazard.  And the
13       first thing that Matel does is pull the toy off the
14       shelf.  They don't wait for the government to force
15       them, they don't go to committee hearings, they pull
16       the things off the shelf.
17            Whenever there is a problem with a food
18       substance the manufacturers pull those things.  The
19       manufacturers take those toys off the shelf.
20            Compare that to what happened in this case,
21       where the manufacturers of cigarettes fought the
22       warnings every time and at every step of the
23       process.
24            But the fourth and probably the most important
25       reason that we punitive damages should be awarded in

 1       this case is that it is still happening today.  They
 2       haven't changed.  It's still happening today in this
 3       courtroom.
 4            MR. WILLIAMS:  Objection, Your Honor.
 5            MR. WOODS:  Approach, please.
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
18            THE COURT:  Okay.  Ladies and gentlemen, please
19       disregard the last statement.  Nothing that has
20       happened in this courtroom is a basis for punitive
21       damages.  You are to only consider the evidence that
22       has been presented in this courtroom.
23            You may proceed.
24            MS. SHAMP:  Thank you.  I want to talk for a
25       moment about addiction.  I want to talk for a moment

 1       about what Dr. Giakas said about addiction.  What
 2       Mr. Williams said in his openings and closing.  He
 3       said -- and I wrote it down -- that Bill Sury could
 4       have quit any time he wanted to, that he just didn't
 5       want to bad enough, that he smoked because he wanted
 6       to, not because he was addicted.  And I wrote down
 7       this because it struck me in the very first day of
 8       trial in opening statements where David Woods said
 9       the choice to smoke was like grabbing low fat
10       dressing out of the refrigerator.  Remember him
11       saying that?  It evinces not only a misunderstanding
12       about addiction, but we know they know about
13       addiction, because what they wanted to tell people
14       was you could pick it up and put it down any time
15       you want.  Pick it up, put it down.  Pick it up, put
16       it down.  Put the ads on.  It's a happy thing to do.
17       Pick it up, put it down.  It's like grabbing low fat
18       dressing out of the refrigerator.  Pick it up, put
19       it down.
20            But what Dr. Giakas said on the stand, it was
21       just a matter of him wanting to.  Just a matter of
22       him wanting to.  Shows a deep misunderstanding of 23       addiction that I think is intentional.
24            I think it's intentional because we have a
25       document.  It's document 363.  And I want you to

 1       read it when you get back, because it's a document
 2       from 1980.  What it says is:  I'm told that the
 3       entire matter of addiction is the most potent weapon
 4       a prosecuting attorney can have in a lung cancer
 5       cigarette case.  We can't defend continued smoking
 6       as free choice if the person was addicted.
 7            That's their own document.  They cannot defend
 8       this as free choice.  And they know they can't,
 9       because Bill Sury was addicted.  Document 363.
10            I also want to talk for a moment about Mary
11       Ridell's testimony, because what Mary Ridell said
12       was that campaigns to try to keep kids from smoking
13       were not important, should not even be done because
14       kids make, I believe she talked about, rational
15       informed choices.
16            Pick it up, put it down.  That's what they're
17       telling you.  That's what they were telling kids.
18       Pick it up, put it down.
19            Finally I want to talk for just a minute about
20       damages.  That's the question that you'll have on
21       the jury form.  Now, this is the hard part, and I
22       will tell you at the front I'm no better with coming
23       up with what the right number is than you are.  I've
24       thought about it, I've talked with Dr. Sury about
25       it, thought hard about what I would ask you for and

 1       what the evidence would support, and what we know
 2       about Bill Sury.  He was a good man who loved life
 3       and who had nine years left to live.  Not the nine
 4       years -- nine years in his retirement time when he
 5       was still -- if you'll remember he was still playing
 6       golf, walking on the beach with his son.  Nine years
 7       of life taken from him.  What's that worth?
 8            You know, it's funny.  There's been some
 9       disagreement in this case about whether Mr. Sury was
10       a successful man in terms of his business.  But
11       there is no disagreement that Mr. Sury was a
12       successful man.  He was a successful man because of
13       the family he had, he was a successful man because
14       of the life he had.  His life and the life he shared
15       with his son was valued.
16            So I am going to ask you for millions of
17       dollars.  I am going to ask you for five million
18       dollars, and even number, for Bill Sury's life.
19            Now, you might be sitting there saying, now,
20       where did Ms. Shamp get that number?  Did she pull
21       it out of her hair, pull it out of the air?  And the
22       answer is --
23            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may we approach?
24       Sorry. 25            THE COURT:  Yes.

 1            (Sidebar conference outside the hearing of the
 2       jury.)
 3            THE COURT:  This is my third tobacco trial, and
 4       it always seems I get more sidebars in the last 20
 5       minutes of the trial than any other time.  But go
 6       ahead.
 7            MR. WOODS:  I apologize, Your Honor, but she
 8       just asked for five million dollars for Bill Sury's
 9       life.  She can't ask --
10            THE COURT:  Well, she said that and then there
11       was a pause.
12            I think you need to make it clear, Ms. Shamp,
13       unless you want me to make it clear.
14            MS. SHAMP:  I think I --
15            THE COURT:  No, you didn't.
16            MS. SHAMP:  I'm sorry.
17            THE COURT:  I heard what he said, and you said
18       five million dollars for Mr. Sury's life.  There was
19       no objection for a while, and then you said I may
20       have pulled that out of the air or hair, and so then
21       there was an objection.
22            I want you to clear it up, and if you don't
23       clear it up well enough then I'll clear it up that
24       it is not for his life, it is for the wrongful death
25       issues on the verdict form.

 1            MS. SHAMP:  I understand.
 2            THE COURT:  And the motion -- unless it wasn't
 3       clear earlier, the motion for mistrial on the last
 4       time we were up here is denied, and as it relates to
 5       the curative instruction I gave, I was happy to have
 6       considered other curative instructions, but the
 7       defense chose not to give one, saying it was
 8       impossible.  Thank you.
 9            (Following sidebar.)
10            MS. SHAMP:  Let me make it clear.  We're asking
11       for five million dollars for the companionship that
12       Robert Sury lost as a result of losing his father.
13       The testimony is clear that they had a close
14       relationship, and that -- you'll have the mortality
15       tables, that he had nine years left to live.
16            But as I said, that is a decision within the
17       sound discretion of the jury to make the
18       determination.  And I am no better at the
19       determination than the six of you combined talking
20       together about what the right number is or ought to
21       be under those scenarios.  But we believe that five
22       million dollars for the loss is a fair number to ask
23       you for.
24            I want to thank you again on behalf of myself
25       and my team, Leslie Bryan, my co-counsel, Ragan
4733 1       Ferguson, Tiffany McCain, and also on behalf of our
 2       client Dr. Robert Sury.  We thank you for your
 3       service in this case, because that's what it is.
 4            And the judge talked to you about that at the
 5       very beginning, that this was service.  And I
 6       thought it was interesting that the case fell over
 7       Veterans Day and we had Veterans Day in it, and that
 8       this service that you're providing is the only
 9       service that would be more important than service to
10       your country at war.
11            Let me make it clear that the service that
12       you're providing today is not to me or my team or
13       even to Dr. Sury, but to this country and your
14       community.  The word verdict means to speak the
15       truth, ver for veritos, veritble, means truth, and
16       dic like in dictaphone means to speak.  We're
17       asking you for a verdict in this case that speaks
18       the truth.  We're asking you for a verdict that says
19       that what they said and the lies they told are
20       important and did have a cause.  We're asking you
21       for a verdict that says the plaintiff is entitled to
22       punitive damages, and we're asking for a verdict
23       that awards damages for the death and for the loss
24       that Robert Sury has suffered as a result of his
25       father's death.  I thank you.

 1            THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, as I told you
 2       before I have some other instructions to give you.
 3       It's going to take me a few minutes to set up all
 4       that we need to do, because when I complete these
 5       instructions you're going to go and deliberate.  So
 6       what I'm going to do is organize some things so that
 7       I can put -- I'm going to ask you to go out, but
 8       while you're doing that I'm going to organize so I
 9       can put all those documents and other evidence and
10       things you've seen in the courtroom in a method so
11       that I can get it into the jury room when you come
12       back out.  I'm going to give a copy of the
13       instructions that you read with me earlier.  I'm
14       going to put a set of those in the jury room.  The
15       instructions I'm about to give you, I'm going to put
16       those in the jury room, but I'm going to also put
17       them on your chair so you can read those
18       instructions along with me, and then the verdict
19       form that you'll utilize I'm going to put that in
20       the jury room.  So as we organize this it's just
21       going to take several minutes to organize.  So I'm
22       going to ask that you go into the jury room while we
23       organize transferring all that stuff.  Thank you.
