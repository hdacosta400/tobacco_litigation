9                     CLOSING ARGUMENT
10           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Thank you, Your Honor.
11           Yesterday you sent a loud and clear message to
12      R.J. Reynolds.  I've spoken to the folks at Winston
13      Salem and R.J. Reynolds and they have heard your
14      verdict.  And they respect it just like everyone.
15           MR. SHIELDS:  Your Honor, there's no evidence
16      of this and that's improper argument.
17           THE COURT:  Sustained.
18           MR. HOHNBAUM:  We respect your verdict.
19           We're now on to another phase of the case.
20      The punitive damage phase.  And just like in the
21      first phase at the end of these argument you're
22      going to hear from the judge about what the law is,
23      what the instructions are that will guide you in
24      making the decision about what you should do from
25      this point forward. 3711
1           Those instructions are going to say that you
2      may, in your discretion, decline to asses punitive
3      damages.  And one of the reasons that's the case is
4      because you have heard additional evidence
5      yesterday and today that may affect your decision
6      about whether or not punitive damages are warranted
7      in this case.
8           So one instruction that you're going to get
9      from the court is you may decline to award punitive
10      damages."
11           It's also important to understand that the
12      punitive damages can only be awarded to Helen
13      Taylor.  And the flip side of that is how punitive
14      damages cannot be awarded to public health
15      agencies, smoking cessation clinics, charities,
16      other smokers.  Any amount of money that you award
17      for punitive damages goes directly to Helen Taylor.
18           Also important to understand that punitive
19      damages you asses would be addition to the
20      compensatory damages you have previously awarded.
21      And by your verdict yesterday you have fully
22      compensated Helen Taylor for her injuries.  That's
23      what you did by your verdict yesterday.
24           We're going to talk a little bit about this
25      concept, but this is the key to the punitive 3712
1      damages phase in this case.  And it is the
2      challenge for a jury that has heard lots of
3      evidence, some of which has nothing to do with
4      Ms. Taylor.
5           You may not consider conduct that has no
6      connection to the conduct that injured Ms. Taylor.
7      That's challenging because of the evidence you've
8      heard in this case, some of which no doubt made you
9      angry and was wrong-headed.  But the conduct that's
10      at issue in this phase of the case, what the law
11      requires of you, is that you consider only that
12      conduct that caused injury to Ms. Taylor.
13           R.J. Reynolds or any defendant that's going
14      through a punitive damages phase of a case can only
15      be punished for, in this case, concealing
16      information and agreeing to conceal information
17      that was a legal cause of Ms. Taylor's COPD and
18      PVD.
19           It's not harm to other smokers.  It's not for
20      any defect in cigarettes.  You heard Mr. Shields
21      talk a little bit about that.  You heard him talk
22      about harm to other smokers.  It's -- those things
23      are irrelevant to your consideration of punitive
24      damages in this case.  And it's not for R.J.
25      Reynolds negligence.  Those are improper 3713
1      considerations for punitive damages in this case.
2           This emphasizes the point that what has to
3      happened here and what the law requires is that the
4      harm be -- the conduct of Reynolds actually have
5      harmed Ms. Taylor.  And that requires you to not
6      consider the Engle findings.
7           So you come into Phase II and the Engle
8      findings are in Phase I, and then you cannot
9      consider the Engle findings as it relates to your
10      determination for punitive damages.  And the
11      challenge here is that you have heard lots of
12      information, but you must put blinders on, as
13      difficult as that may be, you must put blinders on
14      to any conduct that did not harm Helen Taylor.
15           We were not back in the jury room with you, so
16      we don't know what information you found that was
17      concealed that would have made a difference to
18      Helen Taylor and but for her knowing that
19      information she would have quit sooner or otherwise
20      avoided the her injuries.  That's the conduct that
21      you have to tie your punitive damages award to and
22      nothing else.
23           Obviously, you cannot punish R.J. Reynolds for
24      a being a large company.  As the judge instructed
25      you in the earlier phase of the case, corporations 3714
1      and individuals are the same in the eyes of the
2      law.  They both are entitled to the same fair and
3      impartial consideration by the same legal standard.
4      So corporations and individuals, under the law,
5      must be treated the same.
6           And of course you can't punish R.J. Reynolds
7      simply for manufacturing and selling cigarettes.
8      We talked in voir dire about the fact that R.J.
9      Reynolds acknowledges that it sells a product.
10      That it's dangerous and that it's addictive and
11      that it causes disease.  And each one of you said
12      you would not hold that against R.J. Reynolds and
13      you can't hold that against R.J. Reynolds in this
14      phase of the case for simply manufacturing and
15      selling cigarettes.
16           What we know from the first phase of the case
17      is that all cigarettes that burn tobacco are
18      dangerous and addictive.  All cigarettes are.
19           MR. SHIELDS:  Your Honor, I object as he's
20      rearguing Phase I.  This doesn't have anything to
21      do with --
22           THE COURT:  Sustained.
23           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Cigarettes are a legal product.
24      All warning labels after 1969 --
25           MR. SHIELDS:  Same objection, Your Honor. 3715
1           THE COURT:  Sustained.
2           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Your Honor, may we approach.
3      You.
4           (A sidebar conference was held outside the
5 hearing of the jury.)
6           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Your instructions that you
7      you're going to be reading to the jury say that you
8      will decide this case, the law here, and as I have
9      previously instructed you.  So this is just from
10      your instruction, so was the other point.  So was
11      the point about corporations being treated like
12      individuals.  Those are all instructions from the
13      first phase and they have equal applicability here.
14      That's all I'm doing.
15           THE COURT:  Okay.  I suspect we're going to
16      get something from him coming back the next way.
17      I'm thinking just let it all hang out to use an old
18      adage.  Even the young fellow got that.  He's good.
19      That's what I'm thinking.  I'm thinking I'll just
20      overrule every objection from here.
21           MR. SHIELDS:  Let him reargue again it.
22           MR. HOHNBAUM:  With all due respect, it's just
23      referring to instruction from Phase I.  It's not
24      much argument.  It's just telling you -- reminding
25      what your instructions were in Phase I.  It's 3716
1      venturing off the -- it's hardly venturing off the
2      script.
3           THE COURT:  The point of this should be
4      mitigation and finances to me.  But I ain't trying
5      the case.  I'm just watching and thankful to be
6      able to do it.  Proud to be here with you fellows
7      and watch you all work.  So overruled.
8           (Sidebar ends.)
9           MR. HOHNBAUM:  So as I was saying, all warning
10      labels after 1969 complied with federal law.
11      That's the instruction that you got previously.
12      R.J. Reynolds had no legal obligation to make any
13      additional warnings after 1969.
14           Now, let's be clear about something.
15      Mr. Shields gets the last word and he's going to
16      come up here and suggest to you that somehow I'm
17      disputing what happened in Phase I or that in some
18      ways I'm undermining or trying to undermine your
19      verdict.  That is not the case.
20           My job is to do the best job I can to explain
21      to you how the legal -- the law -- what is the law
22      is in this case and what facts you should be
23      considering as you determine whether to award
24      punitive damages and in what amount.  Phase I is
25      Phase I.  It's over.  And I'm not disputing your 3717
1      verdict or how you arrived at that verdict.
2           Let's talk about mitigating evidence.  It is
3      evidence which may demonstrate that a reduced
4      amount of punitive damages should be imposed
5      against R.J. Reynolds.  That's what the instruction
6      you will receive from the court is.  Mitigating
7      evidence is part of this phase of the case.
8           Now, Mr. Shields made a point about The
9      Tobacco Institute is gone.  The Council for Tobacco
10      Research is gone.  The Tobacco Industry Research
11      Committee is gone, and he suggested to you -- no,
12      he didn't suggest to you, he told you that somehow
13      Reynolds had to agree to that.
14           Well, of course, that wasn't the case.  There
15      was a lawsuit and there was a resolution of that
16      lawsuit.  And as part of the resolution of that
17      lawsuit this is what came out of that.  So it was,
18      in fact, voluntary, it was an agreement.  The
19      notion that somehow we were hiding something from
20      you, as if Mr. Shields -- we don't know what
21      Mr. Shields knows and he's going to come up and
22      cross examine Dr. Figlar about that very thing,
23      that's of course not the case.  Right?
24           This is what came out of the Master Settlement
25      Agreement and that agreement was a settlement 3718
1      agreement.  The notion that it's not important for
2      you to understand that some of the individuals that
3      you heard from, in the first phase of the case,
4      have absolutely nothing to do with the company now
5      is part of what you should consider.
6           If these folks were still involved in the
7      company and still running the company, still had
8      any sort of role in the company that would be
9      important for you to consider.
10           Instead, you should consider that those folks
11      are gone and, in fact, there is new ownership at
12      R.J. Reynolds.  There's new executives and new
13      scientists.  The company that you found liable in
14      this case for conduct to Ms. Taylor is not the same
15      company as today.
16           And the question you should be asking
17      yourself -- well, one of the questions you should
18      be asking yourself when you go back to the jury
19      room, are punitive damages needed to prevent
20      Reynolds from concealing and agreeing to conceal
21      information in 2014?  Are they needed to deter
22      Reynolds from doing that?
23           Dr. Burns testified that conspiracy ended in
24      1999.  That's their own evidence on that point.
25      Reynolds, today, if you go to your website and 3719
1      otherwise, informs smokers about the health risks
2      and dangerous of smoking.
3           I spent some time with Dr. Figlar going over
4      the website and the discussion of reduced-risk
5      products and cessation aids.  So I want to just
6      highlight a couple of the points from the website
7      that we saw with Dr. Figlar.
8           Reynolds tells smokers today that cigarette
9      smoking is a leading cause of preventable deaths in
10      the United States and lists several diseases that
11      it causes.  It tells consumers and smokers that
12      quitting cigarettes significantly reduces the risk
13      for serious disease.  It tells consumers and
14      smokers to rely on the conclusions of the U.S.
15      Surgeon General, not that Reynolds agrees with
16      everything the government says about its product or
17      its industry, but it points the consumers to the
18      Surgeon General and it, says, "That should be the
19      source for your information."
20           It also lists the ingredients in cigarettes so
21      if anybody has any concerns or issues with
22      particular ingredients they can go to the website,
23      click on the brand of cigarette that they smoke and
24      find out every single ingredient that's related to
25      do that cigarette. 3720
1           Reynolds makes it clear that no tobacco
2      product has been shown to be safe and without
3      risks.
4           Reynolds also informs smokers about the
5      availability of reduced-risk products and cessation
6      aids.  That's part of what we went over with
7      Dr. Figlar.  As part of what it informs customers
8      to do is says, look, the best thing for you to do
9      is to quit.  That's the best thing for you to do.
10           But if you continue to use tobacco, think
11      about using other products that pose less risk than
12      cigarettes.  And this was the chart that we showed
13      Dr. Figlar.  This is what the company is involved
14      in.  It's moving folks from cigarettes to
15      smoke-less tobacco, Snus, to nicotine products like
16      VUSE, the electronic cigarette, all of which
17      reduces the risk of health effects.
18           And nobody -- Mr. Shields had an opportunity
19      to put on whatever evidence he wanted in Phase II.
20      He put on an economist.  That's who he put on.  He
21      didn't put on any other evidence about what's
22      happening with the company now, or some issue with
23      how the company is managing itself as it relates to
24      this migration strategy.  He asked questions of
25      Dr. Figlar and that's all he did with respect to 3721
1      this issue.
2           These are the products, right, that Reynolds
3      has.  You've got combustible, you've got
4      cigarettes, and then you've got the Premiere and
5      Eclipse, which is the heat-not-burn, that's what
6      Dr. Figlar testified about, the most danger is the
7      combustible nature of cigarettes that causes the
8      smoke.  Then you've got heat-not-burn technology,
9      and then you have smoke free, that's the Snus,
10      that's the electronic cigarette, and then you have
11      nicotine replacement, right?  They're in the
12      business also of helping customers quit smoking.
13           Now, of course, the only thing that's no risk
14      is stopping and that's what Reynolds says on its
15      website.  If you're concerned about the health
16      risks you should quit.
17           This is a little bit one of those cases where
18      situations where you do your best to do something
19      and here, Reynolds spent 30 years and over a
20      billion dollars trying to develop a cigarette that
21      was safer.  And that is the Premiere and the
22      Eclipse.
23           And you heard Mr. Shields question that effort
24      and question the efficacy of the research that was
25      done with respect to those products. 3722
1           Reynolds worked to develop these products
2      since the 1980s.  And it's clear, you didn't hear
3      Mr. Shields question, that Premiere was safer than
4      a conventional cigarette.  And after developing
5      that product, Reynolds put it out in the
6      marketplace and it was a failure.
7           And so what did it do, it went back to the
8      drawing board and worked on the Eclipse brand.
9      It's been available since 1996, still available
10      nationally and in Florida and Reynolds loses money
11      on every pack, but it's committed to this product
12      because it thinks it has promise for the future.
13           If Mr. Shields wanted to put up evidence to
14      tell you that this cigarette, the Eclipse brand,
15      was not safer than cigarettes he could have done
16      so.  He didn't.
17           The evidence is, in fact, it was safer.  And
18      of course Dr. Figlar talked about Snus, which is,
19      again, part of its migration strategy.  There's no
20      question that Snus is less harmful than traditional
21      cigarettes.  So if somebody is still interested in
22      tobacco products as part of the migration strategy
23      the idea is, okay here is another product.  They
24      spent $50 million to develop that product.  Went
25      over to Sweden where the cancer rates are much 3723
1      lower and the levels of oral cancer are much lower.
2           Snus dramatically lowers smoking-related
3      disease, and it carries the warning that smoke-less
4      tobacco is addictive.  It's informing its customers
5      this is not a risk-free product.  It's a reduced
6      risk product.  But there are still risks associated
7      with Snus.
8           And then, of course, we talked about
9      electronic cigarettes.  $250 million to bring VUSE
10      to market.  It delivers a nicotine aerosol.  No
11      tobacco is burned and no tobacco smoke.
12           And what does Reynolds do voluntarily today
13      with respect to the VUSE cigarette?  It contains an
14      extensive barning, a voluntary warning label
15      highlighting and alerting customers to potential
16      risks associated with that product as well.
17           And Reynolds informed smokers about nicotine
18      replacement therapy.  We talked about the product
19      that they have on the market that -- and make
20      accessible to consumers, nicotine replacement
21      therapy, to help people quit smoking.
22           So the question is:  Are punitive damages
23      needed to prevent Reynolds from concealing
24      information in 2014?  No.  They can't be anymore
25      transparent than they are now.  Go to their 3724
1      website.
2           Did Mr. Shields present any evidence to you,
3      any facts, not innuendo, not suggestion, did he
4      present any facts to you that Reynolds is not being
5      transparent today?  The fact of the matter, it is
6      and that's evident by their website among other
7      things.
8           Your punitive damage instruction "Mitigating
9      evidence is evidence which may demonstrate that a
10      reduced amount of punitive damages should be
11      imposed against R.J. Reynolds."  What the company
12      is doing today, how the company is structured, what
13      it's strategy is, how transparent it is, all of
14      that goes to the consideration of the amount of
15      punitive damages and the mitigating evidence you
16      should consider when you're determining the amount
17      of punitive damages to award in this case.
18            We talked about the Master Settlement
19      Agreement.  The payments to Florida under the
20      Master Settlement Agreement have been $2 billion.
21      The Master Settlement Agreement has -- requires
22      Reynolds to pay 2 to $3 billion per year to every
23      participate in that agreement forever.  Forever.
24           Over 120 cases have been tried in Engle
25      litigation.  The total money paid to date for 3725
1      punitive damages in those cases is $100 billion.
2      That's the amount of money that's already been
3      paid.
4           And this is a challenge.  The judge is going
5      to instruct you that you are not to be swayed from
6      the performance of your duty by prejudice or
7      sympathy for or against any party.  We're at a
8      phase of the case where that's a challenge to not
9      be swayed by prejudice or sympathy but to base your
10      decision on the facts that you've heard.
11           Let's talk about the punitive damages award.
12      If you'll recall on the verdict form there was a
13      comparative fault allocation.  And you had
14      42 percent for Ms. Taylor and 58 percent for R.J.
15      Reynolds.  That does not apply to the compensatory
16      award.  Ms. Taylor will receive, under your award,
17      the entire $4,478,654.92.  100 percent of it.
18           Now, Ms. Taylor acknowledged that her failure
19      to quit sooner was a legal cause of her COPD and
20      PVD.  And you found that Ms. Taylor to be
21      42 percent at fault for causing her injuries.  That
22      amount is 1.88103507.
23           MR. SHIELDS:  Totally improper argument
24      regarding punitive damages.
25           MR. HOHNBAUM:  It's the amount, Your Honor. 3726
1           THE COURT:  Sustained.
2           MR. HOHNBAUM:  May we approach?
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
23           MR. HOHNBAUM:  If you think that punitive
24      damages are warranted after hearing the evidence,
25      let me suggest to you an appropriate way to look at 3729
1      that.  In Mr. Shields' closing arguments he asked
2      for $5 million for pain and suffering.  If you were
3      to award Ms. Taylor this 521,000-dollar award, you
4      will have compensated her to the full $5 million
5      that Mr. Shields requested as pain and suffering.
6      You may not award --
7           MR. SHIELDS:  Object, improper argument.
8           THE COURT:  Well, you'll get to explain the
9      math of that, I suppose, because those numbers
10      wouldn't add up, the way you look at it.
11           MR. HOHNBAUM:  You may not award an amount
12      that would financially destroy R.J. Reynolds.  That
13      will be the instruction and the instructions that
14      the judge reads to you.  Punitive damages are not
15      needed to make Reynolds stop concealing information
16      or agreeing to conceal information.  All of the
17      information is out there in the public today and
18      Reynolds is sharing that information on its own
19      website.
20           And Mr. Shields mentioned, Well, what message
21      are you sending with a punitive damages verdict in
22      this case?  I want to look at it from the flip side
23      of the coin.  Here you have a company that has
24      turned the corner, that is doing the right thing,
25      that is informing its customers about the dangerous 3730
1      of its product.
2           It's doing all of those thing, what would a
3      punitive damages award send to other companies who
4      also are doing the right thing, who have turned the
5      corner, who have changed how they do business?
6      What would the message be?  The message would be
7      you will be punished over and over and over and
8      over again.
9           That's the message you would be sending by
10      punitive damages award in this case.  When somebody
11      has turned the corner and is doing the right thing,
12      they deserve a fresh start and that's the situation
13      we're in here.
14           So are punitive damages needed in this case?
15      Are they needed to make Reynolds stop concealing
16      information?  No.  They are as transparent as they
17      possibly can be.
18           Would a punitive award improve public health?
19      No.  The money goes to Helen Taylor.
20           Would a punitive damages award make people
21      more aware of the dangers of smoking?  No.  There
22      could be no doubt that people are fully informed
23      about the dangers of smoking.
24           Would a punitive award stop people from
25      beginning to smoke?  No. 3731
1           Would a punitive damages award cause more
2      people to stop smoking?  No.
3           Would a punitive award make Reynolds more
4      transparent?  How could it be more transparent than
5      it is today?
6           While Mr. Shields gets the last word, the
7      facts are what matters, not innuendo and not
8      suggestion.  And would punitive damages -- under
9      the facts of this case, would a punitive damages
10      award serve any valid purpose?  And the answer to
11      that question is no.
12           Thank you for your attention and your
13      patience.
