24                     CLOSING ARGUMENT
25           MR. SHIELDS:  Good morning. 3700
1           This phase of the trial is about the amount of
2      money to be awarded for punitive damages.  It is
3      not about whether punitive damages are warranted.
4      You already decided that.  You already completed
5      your verdict form in Phase I saying punitive
6      damages are warranted, but you would hardly know
7      that from Reynolds' response in this Phase II.
8           They didn't talk anything about amount, but in
9      effect tried to reargue the same positions they had
10      in Phase I, as if you had not already decided the
11      issue.
12           The court will instruct you that the purpose
13      of punitive damages is to punish and to deter, and
14      it's not just to deter Reynolds.  It's to deter
15      others as well.
16           There is no ability to punish and deter in a
17      civil case like this other than the award of money
18      damages.  It's not like a criminal case in which
19      some other form of punishment could be done.
20           The amount of money damages for punitive
21      damages should be what is necessary to meet the
22      goal of punishment and deterrence.  I have a few
23      remarks.  I'm not going to take a lot of your time.
24      We've spent three weeks doing this and I think
25      we're where we need to be in terms of 3701
1      understanding.  But there are a few things I do
2      want to talk about really briefly.
3           As I indicated, this is about money.  This is
4      about the amount of punitive damages necessary to
5      punish and deter them.
6           The court will instruct you on the factors to
7      consider in awarding punitive damages and among
8      those instructions is that you should consider the
9      financial resources as well as any mitigating
10      evidence.
11           You're also to consider the nature, extent and
12      degree of misconduct and related circumstances.
13      But that's what the whole first phase was about.
14      That's what all the evidence we put on for over two
15      weeks was about.  That's already been dealt with.
16      So we're now dealing with financial resources and
17      whether there's any mitigating evidence.
18           We offered the evidence about what their
19      financial resources were.  Ratner testified from
20      their financial records about how able they were to
21      pay punitive damages.  And what he told you was
22      that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company is worth at
23      least $25 billion.  It has an operating revenue
24      last year in excess of $8 billion, and a net profit
25      in excess of $3 billion. 3702
1           As a result of its incredibly lucrative
2      operations, it has paid its shareholders over
3      $1 billion in dividends for many years and still
4      made that amount of money.
5           What did R.J. Reynolds say in response to
6      that?  Virtually nothing.  They put on a corporate
7      representative who didn't even mention their
8      financial resources, who did not even discuss their
9      ability to pay punitive damages.
10           What amount of money is necessary to deter
11      them?  What amount of money is necessary to punish
12      them?  Of course that's your decision in your light
13      and your conscious.  But -- and Mr. Ratner told you
14      that they are able to pay out a billion dollars
15      without making a dent in their operations, without
16      making any possible effect on their operations and
17      their business.
18           But of course the whole point of punitive
19      damages is to make a dent in their operation.  The
20      whole point of punitive damages is to get their
21      attention and punish and deter them and the court
22      will instruct you on what that means.
23           Now, I'm going to talk a little bit later
24      about what figure we would think appropriate.  But
25      before I do that, let me talk a little bit more 3703
1      about Reynolds response in this Phase II.
2           It repeated the same arguments that you heard
3      for over two weeks.  It continues to act as if the
4      issue is about whether, as Mr. Hohnbaum said in
5      voir dire, they have "zero responsibility" and that
6      he repeated in his closing argument in Phase I that
7      there should be zero responsibility.  But we're
8      past that.
9           What they did was put on Dr. Figlar to testify
10      and to try and justify their conduct.  He didn't
11      come here on the main case to testify to you.  He
12      didn't come here on the main case to respond to all
13      of those documents that we showed you.  Instead, he
14      came in this phase after you've already decided the
15      issue.
16           But think about what he testified.  Did he
17      deny that they had targeted kids over the years?
18      No.
19           Did he deny that they had designed their
20      cigarettes to create and sustain addiction?  Not
21      really.
22           He talked all around it but never really
23      addressed that issue.  He said, oh, we don't add
24      nicotine.  But he never addressed whether they
25      blended nicotine to make sure it was sufficient to 3704
1      cause addiction.  He never addressed all the other
2      chemicals they add to make it inhalable so that it
3      causes addiction.  He never dealt with the
4      fundamental issue of whether they engineered and
5      designed their cigarettes to be addictive.
6           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Your Honor, objection.
7           May we approach?
8           THE COURT:  Sure.
9           (A sidebar conference was held outside the
10 hearing of the jury.)
11           MR. HOHNBAUM:  This argument has nothing to do
12      with punitive damages.  The concealment is the
13      issue and the concealment as Ms. Taylor is the
14      issue.  He can't give punitive damages for
15      negligent design or the design of the cigarette or
16      any of these issues.  It's not an appropriate topic
17      for awarding punitive damages and that's all he's
18      doing.
19           MR. SHIELDS:  All that goes to the concealment
20      claim as they concealed the fact they engineered
21      and designed their cigarettes to be addictive.
22      They concealed the fact they're targeting kids.
23           THE COURT:  He's saying -- it's not relevant
24      to punitive damages.
25           MR. SHIELDS:  I would have agreed except that 3705
1      you agreed with their argument that that first
2      thing allowed them to try and relitigate what was
3      Phase I.  All of Dr. Figlar's testimony dealt with
4      being responsible.  He's denying they did anything
5      wrong.  He was asserting they cooperated.  The
6      whole point of all of that is to say that the
7      misconduct was justified.
8           MR. HOHNBAUM:  That's pretty mushy annals
9      under the circumstances.
10           THE COURT:  In my mind, it could kind of lead
11      into -- touch on mitigation, but it is a stretch.
12           MR. HOHNBAUM:  The confusion inherent in that
13      is obvious.
14           THE COURT:  I understand.  I guess, with that
15      in mind, be careful.
16           MR. SHIELDS:  I'll move on.
17           (The sidebar conference ended and proceedings
18 took place in open court as follows:)
19           MR. SHIELDS:  Finally, Dr. Figlar did not
20      really discuss the whole conspiracy that they
21      entered into in 1953 and carried to forward.
22           What he did talk about is that they had
23      changed, in that the same people weren't there.  Of
24      course the same people aren't there some 40, 50
25      years later from when they first started.  But that 3706
1      doesn't mean the conduct has changed.  And there's
2      evidence of that from my cross-examination of him.
3           Think about the Eclipse cigarette.  The same
4      sort of thing that was done years and years ago,
5      the assertion that it's less hazardous, using ads
6      to try and sell it when, in fact, the data doesn't
7      support it with the result that the Surgeon
8      General's report, this consensus document that is
9      required by federal law to state out the consensus
10      of scientific opinion after reviewing all of the
11      evidence concluded that their advertising of
12      Eclipse was improper, that it asserted there was a
13      reduction in risk, an 80 percent reduction of
14      carcinogens when the data simply did not support
15      that and simply wasn't, true.  And as a result, you
16      had examples like the state of Vermont suing them
17      for consumer fraud and finding them responsible for
18      consumer fraud.
19           So the assertion that everything has changed,
20      that the people aren't the same isn't quite,
21      correct.
22           You also saw a little bit of the same pattern
23      that occurred over the years and that is a lot of
24      half truths and misleading suggestions without --
25           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor. 3707
1      Improper argument.
2           THE COURT:  Overruled.
3           MR. SHIELDS:  -- without really denying the
4      substance of it.
5           Think about the whole thing you were told on
6      direct by Dr. Figlar.  He said, oh, the TIRC
7      doesn't exist anymore.  The Tobacco Institute
8      doesn't exist anymore.  We got all of these
9      documents available on our website.  The whole
10      implication of that to you is that they had done
11      that voluntarily, that things were not like that
12      anymore.
13           What he didn't tell you was that the Attorney
14      General of the state of Florida, and the attorneys
15      generals of 47 other states sued them for fraud and
16      concealment and sought to recover the Medicaid
17      expenses.  And as part of the resolution of that
18      lawsuit brought against them they had to agree to
19      disband TIRC.  They had to agree --
20           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.  That
21      misstates the evidence dramatically.
22           THE COURT:  Overruled.  It's argument.
23           MR. SHIELDS:  They had to agree to disband The
24      Tobacco Institute.  And all of that voluntary
25      production of documents is because the state of 3708
1      Minnesota, in its lawsuit against them, required
2      them to produce the documents and make them
3      available publically.  Hardly had that impression
4      from listening to Dr. Figlar.
5           Now, it is likely that you will hear that this
6      is only about Helen Taylor and not about everyone
7      else and we certainly agree.  Of course that's
8      true.  You're not here to punish them for the
9      injury to everyone else.  There are other claims
10      for that.  And we agree.  It must be related to
11      Helen Taylor.  But all the things we told you in
12      Phase I about their misconduct applied directly to
13      Helen Taylor.
14           The fact that she was targeted and started as
15      a teen, that she was part of a culture of
16      acceptance of smoking from their advertising and
17      concealment.  The fact that she became addicted and
18      then struggled for years to try and quit that
19      addiction.
20           What amount of money will deter such conduct
21      in the future?  Well, if we were talking about all
22      of the wrong, the $440,000 that per year in the
23      United States --
24           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.  That's
25      exactly what we talked about. 3709
1           THE COURT:  Sustained.
2           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Move to strike that, Your
3      Honor.
4           THE COURT:  Go ahead, Mr. Shields.
5           MR. SHIELDS:  We're not talking about an
6      amount of money that would punish them for the
7      totality of their wrong.  We're talking about the
8      amount of money that will punish them for what they
9      did to Helen Taylor and that will deter them and
10      others like them for doing such conduct in the
11      future.
12           There's no magic formula for that.  I wish
13      there were, but there isn't.  It's a matter of what
14      you think, in your light and conscious, is an
15      appropriate amount.
16           I suggest to you that while it might justify
17      vast sums of money, you should not award punitive
18      damages that exceed $20 million.  I suggest that
19      figure to you because that I think that is a
20      reasonable figure in relationship to the amount
21      awarded in compensatory damages and would be
22      appropriately legally under the circumstances here.
23      It's of course your decision.  That figure is less
24      than a multiple of five times the amount of
25      compensatory damages and would certainly be 3710
1      appropriate under these circumstances.
2           I will probably have more to say after
3      Mr. Hohnbaum makes his comments.  But simply
4      conclude, again, by thanking you for your time and
5      attention and I will keep my concluding remarks, I
6      hope, to a minimum as well.


17                     CLOSING ARGUMENT
18           MR. SHIELDS:  If you indulge me just for a few
19      more minutes.  I don't have a lot to say, but I do
20      have some aids to give you.  Mr. Hohnbaum begins
21      his argument by saying we heard the message.  And
22      then he proceeds to talk as if they haven't heard a
23      thing by making the same arguments that they made
24      throughout this case about zero responsibility,
25      that they're doing the right thing. 3732
1           You're going to have to deal with the fact
2      that they continue to make those assertions in the
3      face of all the evidence.  The easy way to deal
4      with it is not to say, well, do I believe
5      Mr. Shields?  Do I believe Mr. Hohnbaum?
6           Take a look at Exhibit 799.  You have it.  It
7      is the 2014 Surgeon General's Report, issued just
8      last January.  By federal law, it's required to set
9      out the consensus of scientific opinion.  It's
10      required to go through this elaborate process to
11      make sure that every word of it is truthful,
12      correct, and complete.  If you look at the
13      beginning of it, the page --
14           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.  That
15      mischaracterizes the Surgeon General's report --
16           THE COURT:  Overruled.
17           MR. HOHNBAUM:  -- dramatically.
18           MR. SHIELDS:  If you don't believe that
19      statement, take a look what the report says about
20      how it is developed and what process it goes
21      through to be created and how it ensures the
22      accuracy and completeness of everything that's said
23      in it and look at the pages and the pages and of
24      experts in their field that put this report
25      together.  And then take a look at the first 3733
1      chapter.
2           The first chapter summarizes what they've done
3      over the years and what they're doing today.  The
4      first chapter talks about whether they're doing the
5      right thing today.  The first chapter talks about
6      whether they're totally transparent.  Read it.
7           Look particularly at pages 18 and 19 and see
8      the history that's given about their conduct.  And
9      then make a decision:  You believe me or do you
10      believe him.
11           You also have Plaintiff's Exhibit 487, the
12      2010 Surgeon General's Report.  The 2010 Surgeon
13      General's Report has an extensive discussion of
14      these novel products that they, quote, are
15      migrating to that are safer and that they're doing
16      the right thing.  And take a look at the pages
17      starting in Chapter 2 on new cigarette products,
18      cigarette-like products, and the evaluation of
19      those products, particularly looking at page 19 of
20      the report in which the Surgeon General panel
21      concludes that these products are dangerous.
22           They are dangerous and damaging because they
23      can lead to people continuing to smoke who would
24      otherwise quit.  They're dangerous because they
25      interfere with cessation efforts.  They are 3734
1      dangerous because -- as I suggested in my
2      cross-examination of Dr. Figlar, they are designed
3      to be used in places where people can't smoke so
4      they can continue to smoke.
5           So that the 19-year-old, the 18-year-old that
6      goes to class is addicted to cigarettes can take
7      that Snus and put it in his gum and use it for his
8      class and avoid his withdrawal symptoms of nicotine
9      until he can get out of class and start smoking
10      again.
11           The public health community has been clear,
12      these products aren't doing the right thing.
13      They're nothing more than what we've seen for
14      decades.  And that is a designed product to keep
15      people smoking, to sell more cigarettes, to make
16      more money.  And you want to decide those issues,
17      read what the experts say in those two documents,
18      not what the lawyers claim in this courtroom.
19           You're ultimately going to have to decide what
20      does it take to make these people do what is right?
21      What does it take to punish them?  What does it
22      take to deter them?  You read these documents
23      obviously they haven't gotten the message yet.  The
24      only way to get the message to them is in case
25      after case in which say enough is enough, we're 3735
1      going to punish you for your conduct, we're going
2      to deter you from trying to do it more, we're going
3      to deter the other companies like you from
4      continuing this conduct.
5           That's the point of Phase II, that's the point
6      of punitive damages.  So I urge you to exercise
7      your authority to send that message to them,
8      exercise your authority to say we don't think
9      you're doing the right thing.  We think you need to
10      do something quite different than that.  And to do
11      it in terms that make sense of this case.
12           I suggest to you again an appropriate award
13      would be a 20 million-dollar punitive damages
14      award.
15           Thank you again for your time and attention.
16      Thank you again for your hard work.  It's almost
17      over with.  It's been a full three weeks, I know.
18      We hoped it would be shorter.  I'm sorry that we
19      didn't get it done sooner.  We do so much
20      appreciate your service.  Thank you.
