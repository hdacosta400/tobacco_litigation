21 mr. kaczynski: thank you, your honor. may it 22 please the court, counsel, ms. alexander, ladies 23 and gentlemen. finally winding down. i want to 24 join my colleagues here in thanking you for your 25 service, thanking you for your attention. 1 i said it before and, again, i know it sounds 2 trite, but the system could not survive without 3 you. we could not do this without you. 4 in terms of ways that you can serve your 5 country, there is a whole range. i mean, it starts 6 with something as simple and as easy as paying 7 your taxes, and ranges all the way to those who 8 lie in state in arlington and other places like 9 that around the country. 10 and your service is on the upper end of that 11 scale and whatever you decide, whatever the 12 verdict, you will be able to go back to friends, 13 family, co-workers and tell them that you helped 14 make the system work because you did. and we 15 appreciate that. 16 just about two weeks ago i told you this case 17 was about john paul alexander and the choices he 18 made, and two weeks later it still is. two weeks 19 ago i told you you would see a picture of a strong man 20 who stood in between addiction and injury. a man 21 who never complained about his smoking. a man who 22 never said he wanted to quit. a man who was in 23 control of where he smoked and where he did not. a 24 man who never tried to quit before he was 25 diagnosed. and when he was diagnosed with copd he 1 quit when he tried the first time. 2 two weeks later almost, with the proof in, you 3 still saw a picture of a strong man who never 4 complained about his smoking, who never said he 5 wanted to quit, who was in control of where he 6 smoked and where he did not, who never tried to 7 quit before he was diagnosed. 8 now, from pretrial to trial, testimony about 9 how -- whether he actually quit changed a little 10 bit. in front of you under oath in that chair 11 mrs. alexander said her husband never quit. 12 before trial under oath she said he did. she said 13 he had no withdrawal symptoms. said he was the 14 same man before and after he quit. 15 and you heard that pretrial deposition 16 testimony under oath yesterday when ms. brower was 17 playing the part of ms. alexander in the jury box. 18 now, you are the judge of facts and you will have 19 to decide what the true facts are. but, you know, 20 we can take a look at the medical records. 21 the medical records say he quit. they say he 22 quit back in -- the 1998 record says he quit. the 23 1997 record says he quit. says, smoking, no. and 24 if you look up in the corner, i was going to come 25 back to this later, it is the reporter, the person 1 who reported that information was his daughter 2 clara. 3 in court here under oath jeanette said he quit 4 -- i'm sorry, one more medical record, stopped 5 smoking two years ago. smoking, and the one on 6 the right, smoking, no. and by the way, if you 7 look down at the lower right-hand corner, able to 8 read, yes. 9 and then his daughter jeanette under oath here 10 in that chair said that there was a time she 11 remembered that she did not see him smoking 12 anymore. 13 under oath here his daughter clara said that 14 he never quit but, of course, clara, as i pointed 15 out a moment ago on the medical record, was the 16 reporter to the doctor -- or the nurse who filled 17 out the form saying that he quit a month and a 18 half ago back in 1997. 19 so you are the judge of facts. you will have to 20 figure out where the truth lies. 21 two weeks ago i told you you would be inundated 22 with company documents and testimony had 23 everything to do with the companies and nothing to 24 do with mr. alexander. 25 two weeks later with the proof in, the 1 plaintiffs have made a valiant attempt to retry 2 the first engle case. to re-prove generic company 3 conduct, to prove the case of some anonymous 4 plaintiff, a generic smoker -- not 5 mr. alexander -- a generic smoker who, unlike 6 mr. alexander, cared about and followed the 7 activities of the tobacco industry research 8 committee and council for tobacco research and 9 tobacco institute. 10 a generic smoker who, unlike mr. alexander, 11 like a lemming to the sea, looked at cigarette 12 ads, studied them like a marketing student and 13 then ran off as he was programmed to do by the 14 product. 15 and two weeks later, and you heard it again 16 this afternoon, two weeks later they proved a 17 thoroughly unremarkable marketing proposition that 18 manufacturers segment their markets and compete 19 with each other for brand share within those 20 market segments. 21 one of those market segments is now, and as we 22 saw in ebony, has been since at least the '60s, 23 the african american market. the evidence, of 24 course, was -- and you saw from the surgeon 25 general, tobacco companies did not create that 1 market. the 1950s marked the introduction of 2 menthol cigarettes, although a greater proportion 3 of african americans now smoke mentholated 4 cigarettes compared with members of other 5 racial/ethnic groups. no evidence exists that the 6 menthol market was initially conceived as having 7 any special appeal to african americans or other 8 racial/ethnic groups. 9 and they have not shown you one illegal or 10 improper activity, marketing activity, in 11 connection with marketing to that market segment. 12 and dr. kyriakoudes told you that on the 13 witness stand. for the period of time you were 14 running through, it was lawful to run print 15 advertising for the tobacco companies, right? 16 oh, yes. 17 lawful to sponsor concerts, correct? 18 yes. 19 lawful to sponsor racing events, correct? 20 yes. 21 lawful to use billboard advertising, correct? 22 yes. 23 lawful to use point of sale advertising, 24 correct? 25 yes. 1 lawful to do transit advertising, correct? 2 yes. 3 we heard -- we saw a document here that says 4 they got advertising in liquor store. that is 5 lawful, too. 6 so all you heard was that the cigarette 7 companies, like companies all across the country, 8 segment their market, compete in the market 9 segment using lawful means of advertising. 10 and that is true, it is marketing 101, even if 11 the product is cigarettes and even if the market 12 is african americans. 13 you heard back in the testimony of 14 dr. kyriakoudes that kools attempt to upgrade its 15 brand, was somehow made to sound sinister. well, 16 again, marketing 101. 17 remember when k-mart was trying to upgrade its 18 image by introducing a jacqueline smith role -- 19 excuse me, line of clothing? so what. so what if 20 they used concerts, coupons, or smiling models, or 21 billboards. that is not wrongful conduct. that is 22 marketing 101. and even dr. kyriakoudes, 23 plaintiff's expert, admitted it. 24 so two weeks after we started, what have they 25 not done? well, they have not done what their 1 expert witnesses said that they were not going to 2 do, and that was to try the case of john paul 3 alexander, to try the gainesville, florida 4 portion of the trial. 5 dr. burns, of course, was the first witness. 6 he was on generic videotape. he had nothing to 7 say about mr. alexander or any other individual. 8 but the folks that did appear, we had dr. proctor, 9 and right off the bat, dr. proctor said he is not 10 here to be the biographer of mr. alexander. he 11 done no research into his life and he is not here 12 to tell you the, the jury, what he read or did not 13 read, what he saw or did not see, anything specific 14 to him. 15 so dr. proctor disclaimed wanting to talk 16 about the case of john paul alexander. 17 dr. kyriakoudes, same thing. he often 18 testifies that he is not the historian of the 19 individual smoker. he says, i'm not any 20 particular plaintiff's biographer. he is been 21 asked basically to render a judgment on 22 individuals at a particular point in time and he 23 does not do it, and he did not do it here. he was 24 not the biographer of mr. alexander. he was not 25 here to tell us what he saw, what he saw or did not 1 see, things of that nature. he said no, i'm not 2 here, and i have not in the course of my testimony. 3 so the experts did not make out their case of 4 john paul alexander. and no family or friends 5 stepped in to fill the void. 6 no family member or friend says that 7 mr. alexander ever heard of the tobacco research 8 -- industry research committee. no family or 9 friend ever said he heard of the council for 10 tobacco research. 11 no family or friend said that he heard of the 12 frank statement. no family or friend said that he 13 argued with them when they told him to quit 14 because it was bad for his health or that it might 15 kill him. 16 no family or friend said that he was the kind 17 of individual who would be influenced by 18 advertising. in fact, right here in court right 19 in front of you his daughter jeanette said the 20 exact opposite. was your father the type of 21 person who was generally influenced by 22 advertising? 23 i could not say that. 24 you would say no to that question? 25 i would say no to that. 1 and dr. werner who reviewed all the 2 depositions taken in this case came to the same 3 conclusion. did you see any evidence in the 4 depositions that he was, in fact, influenced by 5 advertising and marketing with respect to why he 6 started smoking? 7 there was no evidence of that. 8 then she said nobody testified to that, that 9 it influenced his decision to smoke or to not quit 10 sooner. 11 when your experts do not make out your case and 12 your fact witnesses do not make out your case, you 13 have no case. you cannot meet your burden of proof 14 without proof. you cannot meet the greater weight 15 of the evidence without evidence. 16 you cannot tip the scales of justice with 17 nothing and you cannot replace evidence and proof 18 and trying to tip the scales of justice with 19 things like the frank statement that never ran in 20 gainesville. mr. alexander could not have seen it. 21 pamphlets sent out to doctors and politicians, 22 when mr. alexander was neither. 23 you cannot replace evidence and proof with 24 press releases that never appeared in the 25 gainesville sun or with ads for kool that were run 1 while he was smoking pall mall or with the 2 flintstones ads for winston which ran when he was 3 30 years old and he was smoking salems. none of 4 that has anything to do with him. 5 and you cannot replace proof and evidence by 6 rhetoric that is just solely designed to get you 7 mad at my client, or by showing you -- you saw one 8 here -- those forecasting documents from the '70s 9 and '80s and suggesting, as has been done, they 10 were used to market the teens. 11 but even dr. kyriakoudes had to admit that 12 there were legitimate purposes to things like 13 that, legitimate purposes to know why 14 do 17 14 year olds were smoking. 15 so the ability to forecast future usage is 16 important to a product manufacturer? 17 yes, i mean, they are in the business of 18 selling their product and if they predict what 19 they are going to sell, it helps efficiency. 20 well, it also helps predict the size of the 21 work force, right? 22 yes. 23 how much manufacturing capacity they are going 24 to need? 25 yes. 1 the allocation of the manufacturing plant of 2 different products -- different products that they 3 manufacture? 4 yes. 5 so knowing future trends is very important? 6 yes. 7 i told you you would see some stupid documents and 8 company files, and you did. and a lot of them, 9 even dr. proctor had to admit that they went 10 nowhere. 11 in opening i told you, remember we talked 12 about the suggestion box, you would see some noble 13 ideas, the low-tar and medium/nicotine cigarette, 14 even things like that, documents like that, there 15 was some stupid language, and you saw it. 16 but stupid ideas and stupid language do not 17 substitute for the greater weight of the evidence. 18 and all of that, the frank statement, the 19 pamphlets, the press releases, the internal memos 20 from reynolds, the internal memos from philip 21 morris. 22 and by the way, you will hear an instruction 23 from the judge, or you heard it, it is actually in 24 your packet, that tells you the circumstances 25 under which you could consider evidence that is 1 introduced by companies -- about companies other 2 than reynolds. it has to be in furtherance of the 3 conspiracy. 4 when philip morris was trying to figure out 5 how to better market philip morris products, i 6 would argue to you that is not in furtherance of 7 any conspiracy. it is in furtherance of the 8 special interest of philip morris. but you saw a 9 lot of those. 10 and i raised this question two weeks ago for 11 the frank statement, the press releases, the 12 pamphlets, all that stuff. what has this got to 13 do with john paul alexander? because that is why 14 we are here. that is why we are here. 15 this is not a generic class action like the 16 first engle trial. this is not a congressional 17 hearing where you are making judgments in a vacuum. 18 this case is about john paul alexander. and 19 neither their experts nor their fact witnesses 20 have connected anything that reynolds did to him. 21 we talked about those railroad tracks back in 22 the opening and the railroad that runs from 23 jacksonville to miami. when it passes through 24 this place that used to be called hogtown, the 25 tracks do not meet. 1 they have not proven that anything r.j. 2 reynolds did affected mr. alexander. they have 3 not proven that anything r.j. reynolds did was a 4 legal cause as to finding in the instructions of 5 his injury. 6 now, the first question you are going to have 7 to answer on the verdict form when you retire to 8 deliberate is whether mr. alexander was addicted 9 to cigarettes containing nicotine, and if he was, 10 whether addiction caused his injury or whether 11 his injury was caused by his choice to smoke and 12 to continue to smoke. 13 the issue is not whether smoking caused copd. 14 it did. that is resolved, as you heard. the issue 15 is whether addiction caused his injury. 16 now, as the proof came in, you learned a 17 little bit about the concept of addiction. you 18 learned that the notion that quitting smoking 19 could be difficult has been around for a long, 20 long time. 21 you learned from the plaintiff's first 22 witness, dr. burns, that it is been known for over 23 100 years that smoking could be difficult to quit. 24 the terms like nicotine fiend, nicotine fit have 25 been a part of our culture for a long, long time. 1 you heard that the state of florida first 2 called smoking -- cigarette smoking an addiction 3 back in 1906. and the instruction that you were 4 read about concealment, as you will see in the 5 instructions you were given to take back to the 6 jury room, the information concealed has to be 7 something that was not otherwise available. 8 was the fact that cigarette smoking was 9 addictive otherwise available? here it is. from 10 florida in 1906. 11 in the 1930s and 1940s we showed you reader's 12 digest articles that talked about quitting and 13 addiction and nicotine. 14 and when in 1988 the surgeon general 15 officially labeled smoking addictive was above the 16 full coverage right here in gainesville. 17 you saw the clip, you saw it many times during 18 this case, of the waxman committee hearings in 19 1994. and the then ceo of r.j. reynolds, james 20 johnston, was asked the question whether smoking 21 was addictive. 22 and he was cut off in his answer, and that is 23 so important. you will have that in evidence. you 24 can play back. listen to what he was starting to 25 say. he was starting to say cigarettes are not 1 intoxicating. cigarettes -- you do not develop a 2 level of tolerance. 3 what he was trying to do was to disagree with 4 the '88 surgeon general's report to be sure, but 5 he was embracing the '64 surgeon general's report; 6 the report that called it a habit. the report 7 that set out criteria under which smoking was not 8 addictive. 9 it is one thing to call him old-fashioned or 10 maybe not adopting the principles or the standards 11 that the surgeon general changed in order to call 12 smoking addictive, but you cannot call him a liar 13 because he was adhering to the '64 report 14 standard. and that is what he was cut off trying 15 to say. 16 the newspaper articles, and you saw a bunch of 17 them, and magazine articles began to pop up about 18 smoking and disease in the '40s and the '50s and 19 the '60s, '70s and '80s, there would be articles 20 about smoking cessation clinics. articles right 21 here in gainesville. 22 in the '80s and the '90s you saw the articles 23 about publicity for the great american smokeout 24 and the activities around town for the great 25 american smokeout. 1 why are these important? doctors have quoted 2 it. 3 even if you assume that mr. alexander could not 4 read or had minimal reading ability, all this is 5 going on around him, all this is going on around 6 him in a town he is lived in for decades. you 7 could not help but know this. 8 you also heard in this case that addiction 9 does not provide an excuse or a reason to avoid 10 personal responsibility. and you heard it, from 11 no less of an authority, dr. burns who said, and 12 even if they are addicted the smokers are still 13 responsible for their own smoking behavior, 14 correct? 15 that is correct. the fact that someone is 16 addicted is a barrier to behavioral change, but it 17 does not free them from responsibility for their 18 own behavior. 19 and dr. werner told you that she would never 20 tell any patient that that patient did not have 21 the ability to stop smoking. and that is because, 22 as you heard, from the very first days of this 23 case, that the word choice, as much as people 24 would like to say that it is a word of the tobacco 25 industry or mine, is the word of the surgeon 1 general, 1977. cigarette smoking represents a 2 category of health problems that can be called 3 personal choice health behavior. 4 a few years later he said it again. a 5 personal choice behavior. was that a mistake, 6 too? take a look again. 7 even while calling smoking an addictive 8 behavior, the surgeon general said the individual 9 smoker must decide whether or not to continue that 10 behavior. the words of the surgeon general. not 11 mine. personal choice and personal 12 responsibility. 13 it is a concept as old as the garden of eden. 14 a concept exercised every day mr. alexander 15 reached for a pack and took out a cigarette; he 16 exercised when he lit the cigarette. it is a 17 choice he exercised when he inhaled the cigarette. 18 and it is a choice that he had for every time he 19 looked at that pack, for like 30 years, and saw a 20 warning label that told him it was a choice. but 21 it was not a choice without consequence. personal 22 choice did not come with that risk. 23 now, when deciding whether mr. alexander's a 24 class member, you have to decide whether addiction 25 caused his injury or whether his choice to smoke 1 caused his injury. 2 and you may remember from opening statement, i 3 had a little diagram to sort of illustrate this. 4 we have got addiction on the left. we have got his 5 copd or emphysema on the right and we have got 6 mr. alexander standing between them. 7 now, the plaintiffs in this case would take 8 the middle box out, and it would be that simple. 9 addiction, copd. in their regime addiction ends 10 free choice. addiction makes you a non-factor in 11 basic decisions about your own life. addiction 12 makes you a victim of forces beyond your control. 13 nicotine. 14 injury's inevitable. it is just a matter of 15 time and injury absolves you of responsibility for 16 your choices. 17 but that formulation overlooked the fact that 18 addiction does not directly cause injury. and i 19 want you, again, when you get back in the jury 20 room, read the definition of legal cause. 21 addiction does not directly cause injury. it is 22 not a virus. it is not like hiv, aids or hpv or 23 the flu. 24 in between addiction and injury is a person. 25 a "you", a "me". in this case a "john paul 1 alexander". and that person does have free will. 2 and that person does have the ability to make 3 choices. even in this age of victimhood that 4 person bears responsibility for their actions. 5 not ten percent or twenty percent, but one hundred percent, 6 because as i told you in injury selection, the 7 party to this lawsuit best position to prevent 8 harm to mr. alexander was mr. alexander. the 9 party to this lawsuit best position to stand 10 between addiction and injury is mr. alexander. 11 we learned a great deal about mr. alexander in 12 this trial. and we learned that notwithstanding 13 his limited education, he was an intelligent man, 14 a bright man, a man who learned a trade and got 15 very good at it. he could read well enough to get 16 a driver's license. he could read well enough to 17 do bills at the service station. 18 mrs. alexander said he was a full-grown man 19 who knew right from wrong and who could and did 20 decide to smoke. and we learned that he could and 21 did control his smoking. she told us that he 22 would not smoke at pta meetings when he went with 23 her. he sat through them, did not need a 24 cigarette. and went to school plays, he sat 25 through them. did not need a cigarette. 1 at her request he drove her to church and 2 did not smoke in the car because she did not want to 3 smell like tobacco smoke when she got to church. 4 whatever reason, he did decide to smoke around 5 his daughter clara who was asthmatic even when she 6 was having asthma attacks. he never tried to 7 quit. 8 dr. werner for the plaintiffs reviewed the 9 record and concluded that he did not try to quit. 10 nobody at trial ever contradicted that. dr. 11 werner found that he actually did quit in 1997. 12 no evidence he tried before and the medical 13 records reflect the fact that in '97 he did. 14 and let us take a look, again, at those medical 15 records. first one, quit. family reports he 16 quit. stopped two years ago. quit smoking, no. 17 able to read, yes. 18 and you heard the deposition testimony read 19 yesterday where ms. brower played mrs. alexander 20 said that he quit. he was a strong man who kept 21 up on current events. 22 you heard yesterday from the deposition 23 testimony that he would watch walter cronkite and 24 the evening news at least from the 1960s on with 25 his wife beside him. 1 so what we have is a man who controlled his 2 smoking, who never wanted to quit before 1996, who 3 never tried to quit before 1996, and was 4 successful when he did, and suffered no withdrawal 5 symptoms whatsoever. 6 and he never complained about his smoking 7 because it was just a part of his life. it was 8 just a part of his life. it was a part of his 9 life that he resisted being told to change. when 10 people told him that they wanted him to quit 11 smoking, like his wife, for example, he told them 12 to mind their own business. he told his daughter, 13 i'm grown. i mean, i do not have to do what i 14 do not want to do. 15 and whether or not you agree with dr. werner 16 that he was addicted or with dr. myers that he 17 was not, the end result is the same. mr. alexander 18 made a choice to smoke every day. it was a 19 choice. surgeon general's word, not mine. that 20 he could have changed every day, but he chose not 21 to. 22 it is a choice for which even today nobody 23 wants to seem to take responsibility for anything. 24 even today he should be held responsible for that 25 choice. nothing and nobody controlled 1 mr. alexander's choices except mr. alexander. 2 nobody and nothing could stand between 3 addiction and injury except mr. alexander. do not 4 let them take him out of that equation because 5 this case is -- and was and is about john paul 6 alexander and the choices that he made. 7 we go through the verdict form, that first box 8 whether his injury was caused by an addiction to 9 cigarettes containing nicotine, you should check 10 no. 11 now, there was an issue -- at the beginning of 12 the case i told you there was an issue of statute 13 of limitations. and you are going to have to 14 decide, one of the questions -- and it is true the 15 defense bears the burden of proof on this one -- 16 you are going to have to decide whether 17 mr. alexander could, by the exercise of due 18 diligence, have discovered his smoking related 19 copd before 1990? 20 mr. smith: objection, your honor. may we 21 approach? 22 (a sidebar conference was held outside the 23 hearing of the jury as follows:) 24 mr. smith: that is a misstatement of the law. 25 it does not say "could". it says "should" and 1 that -- i let him go on opening because they 2 had not been instructed. they have been instructed 3 now and that is a misstatement of the law. the 4 instruction is that he "should" not "could". 5 there is a huge difference and they have been 6 instructed and that is misleading. 7 mr. kaczynski: i'll repeat it, judge. 8 the court: just correct it. 9 mr. kaczynski: okay. 10 (the sidebar conference was concluded, and the 11 following proceedings were held in open court in 12 the presence of the jury:) 13 mr. kaczynski: the issue you are going to be 14 asked to decide on the statute of limitations is 15 whether, in the exercise of due diligence, 16 mr. alexander should have discovered is smoking -- 17 copd smoking related before 1990. 18 this is a little bit tough to piece together 19 because we have been giving you pieces of evidence. 20 a lot of pieces came in yesterday. pieces of 21 evidence that have to -- that form like a puzzle 22 and as judges of the facts you are going to have to 23 decide whether that puzzle fits together. 24 and the puzzle pieces come from different 25 sources. they come from -- and these are 1 essentially the three questions: 2 did he have copd before may 5th, 1990? 3 did he know, or should he have known, that he 4 had an injury? 5 did he know his symptoms were related to his 6 smoking? 7 let us take those one at a time. 8 did he have copd before may 5th, 1990? this 9 is easy. everybody says he did. everybody says 10 he did. you heard from dr. feingold that copd 11 goes from mild to moderate to severe over a period 12 of decades. it does not happen over night. 13 he showed up in his sixth decade of life in 14 his 50s with clinically significant emphysema. 15 and if dr. feingold had examined mr. alexander 16 back in the '80s he would have diagnosed him with 17 copd. 18 dr. truncale says all of the above, and he had 19 symptoms that he should have known about back in 20 the 1980s. 21 now, these are decades prior to 1990, the 22 decades that we do not have medical records. 23 nobody's fault. they are just not around. 24 but when we do start to have medical records, 25 what do we see? well, we see that he showed up 1 and was diagnosed with severe copd in 1996. 2 again, it does not happen overnight. 3 dr. feingold admits he had copd in the '80s. 4 he would have diagnosed him in the '80s as far 5 back as 1986. he agrees he would have diagnosed 6 him using pulmonary function tests and radiology 7 and these tools, these diagnostic tools were 8 available at the time. 9 41, please. 10 also, this is the right age to develop copd. 11 the fifth -- the sixth decade of life, which 12 mr. alexander was in the 1980s. 13 dr. truncale said it was symptomatic. and 14 here's an interesting record where he spells out 15 clearly that he had a medical history, a past 16 medical history of emphysema. past medical 17 history of emphysema, according to his family and 18 reported by his daughter. 19 and we know that daughter was jeanette. 20 now, in this courtroom, she said her father 21 never had any medical problems prior to his stroke 22 in 1996. 23 on this medical record from 1996 she said he 24 had a history of hypertension, a history of 25 emphysema and if you look in the lower right-hand 1 corner, the highlighted sob, shortness of breath, 2 back in 1996. family members knew he had a 3 history of copd and he must have as well. 4 now, should he have known he had copd? this 5 is an important question and, again, there are 6 three pieces -- there are three sources to the 7 pieces of the puzzle: medical records, testimony 8 of the family, and testimony of the friends in 9 this trial. 10 let us take a look. 11 well, let us check one, okay. 12 let us take a look. now the issue is not, by 13 the way, whether mr. alexander could diagnose 14 himself with a stethoscope to his chest. whether 15 -- the question is whether his condition was 16 severe enough for him to see a doctor. 17 now, here's where the puzzle pieces begin to 18 fit. you heard of the deposition testimony 19 yesterday, where ms. brower played mrs. alexander, 20 that mr. alexander stopped working at his service 21 station, she said, when he took sick and was told 22 that he had emphysema. 23 everybody's memory, of course, controls, but 24 she sat on the stand and said those three things. 25 he stopped work at a service station when he took 1 sick, when he was diagnosed with emphysema. 2 put that puzzle piece together with his social 3 security records and what do they show? 4 well, first of all, what you do not see, by the 5 way, is any work at all in 1988. but then you see 6 the last work he did at the service station is 7 1989, and there are no social security records 8 after that. 9 so if you put mrs. alexander's testimony 10 together with the social security records, you 11 have him leaving the service station in 1999 -- or 12 excuse me, 1989 and then mrs. alexander follows 13 in, because he was diagnosed with emphysema. the 14 whole puzzle begins to fit. 15 after that he worked at home. you heard 16 testimony -- you were shown deposition testimony 17 from some of his friends, and i have no doubt that 18 every one of his friends was sincere in telling -- 19 giving the testimony that they gave. they 20 remember these things as happening in the 1990s. 21 we have seen what memories can do. but the 22 social security record cannot be wrong. it cannot 23 be wrong. it is not subject to lapse of memory. 24 it is not fallible. 25 it says the last time he worked for an 3079 1 employer was 1989. and it jives with the 2 testimony of mrs. alexander. 3 so, again, why would he work at home? 4 dr. truncale filled that in. by this point he 5 likely had moderate copd, moderate emphysema and 6 he just could not take the work at the service 7 station, but continued to work on cars but at a 8 slower rate and at home. 9 that is -- those are a couple of puzzle pieces 10 and they are both consistent with what the 11 addiction expert said, because both addiction 12 experts, dr. werner and dr. myers, agreed that 13 mr. alexander met the dsm number 7 criteria, which 14 i'm going to show you in a minute, from the 1980s. 15 they said that in the 1980s he had a cough, he 16 had shortness of breath, and he had hoarseness. 17 and that these things were significant enough that 18 he would have known he had them and would have 19 known they were related to cigarette smoking. 20 just take a look at what the dsm actually 21 says. dsm 7, which both addiction experts, 22 plaintiff's and defendant's, said that 23 mr. alexander met, said that substance use, if 24 you are smoking, is continued, despite knowledge 25 of having a persistent or recurrent physical or 1 psychological problem that is likely to have been 2 caused or exacerbated by the substance. 3 in other words, whatever he had was pretty 4 significant. whatever he had was pretty 5 significant, and he continued to smoke in spite of 6 it. 7 and dwell on that for a minute. 8 independently, the expert in gainesville and the 9 expert in providence, rhode island working for 10 different sides with diametrically opposed 11 interests in the lawsuit, looking though at the 12 same materials, came to the same conclusion; that 13 based upon the symptoms they saw reported in the 14 medical records and the depositions, he had 15 knowledge of a persistent physical problem caused 16 by smoking in the 1980s which jives with the 17 social security record that says that is when he 18 stopped working, which jives with mrs. alexander's 19 testimony that said he stopped working because he 20 was sick and was diagnosed with emphysema. 21 now, given all this, should mr. alexander have 22 gone to a doctor? 23 drs. myers and werner, medical doctors, both 24 thought so. and what would have happened if he 25 did? 1 well, this is what dr. feingold said. 2 dr. feingold said back in the '80s, if a person 3 goes to see a family practitioner in the 1980s 4 they would have been told to stop smoking by most 5 family practitioners. that was his practice and 6 that was the standard of care for florida 7 physicians. 8 so under any test, any test, mr. alexander 9 would have known, would have had severe symptoms 10 that would have been diagnosed as emphysema and he 11 would have been told had he gone to a doctor they 12 were caused by smoking. but he would not have to 13 go to a doctor to know they were caused by 14 smoking. look at what was being played all across 15 the country. 16 ("smoker's cough? see a doctor" video played 17 for the injury.) 18 mr. kaczynski: did he know he had an injury 19 back in the 1980s? 20 check, yes. 21 and the final piece of the puzzle, did he know 22 they were related to his smoking? 23 well, first of all, the warning label on the 24 pack said it would have been. second of all, he 25 was told by various members of his family and 1 friends, all throughout the entire time he smoked, 2 that smoking was not good for him because it was 3 making him cough, just killing him. 4 but, again, looking at the evidence, dr. myers 5 and dr. werner says that he met the dsm criteria; 6 that is, these things: cough, shortness of breath 7 and hoarseness were significant and should have 8 had knowledge of those problems caused by smoking. 9 dr. myers testified that these required -- 10 this dsm-iv, criteria 7, does not require a doctor 11 to tell you that you have got them. it is just that 12 you know you have got them. 13 and with all this, the evidence fits together. 14 the evidence fits together. 15 the testimony of mrs. alexander, the social 16 security record, the expert's testimony, it all 17 fits together. and common sense tells you it fits 18 together. 19 so in the end, check all three boxes. 20 and when you get to the verdict form, the 21 question number 6, check yes. mr. alexander 22 should have known that he had emphysema caused by 23 smoking. 24 now, if you find him to be a class member, we 25 get past the statute of limitations and if we get 1 past the addiction issue, you are going to have to 2 find that something wrong that r.j. reynolds did 3 affected his choices. you are going to have to 4 find legal cause. 5 in other words, but for r.j. reynolds' 6 conduct, mr. alexander would not have been 7 injured. 8 now, because they made a run at re-trying the 9 engle case, the plaintiffs really kind of ignored 10 trying the alexander case and they did not make 11 out a case of legal case. in fact, most of the 12 so-called evidence that you saw, and you saw, 13 again, some of it this afternoon, falls into one 14 of three categories: untrue, unproven or 15 unrelated to mr. alexander. 16 but before we review the evidence, i want to 17 take a little detour and talk about the people who 18 provided it. and that brings us to dr. proctor. 19 dr. proctor was the plaintiff's main witness 20 who testified for almost two days. you recall 21 that he told us proudly that he is not a 22 dispassionate scholar relating events to the jury. 23 he told us he was rooting for the plaintiff to 24 win. of course he was rooting for the plaintiff 25 to win. 1 dr. proctor's the expert you recall who 2 routinely trashes people who disagrees with him 3 and it does not matter who they are, whether it was 4 a historic figure like dr. wynder. dr. wynder 5 favored filters. dr. proctor said -- we will talk 6 about this in a minute -- they were gimmicks so he 7 trashed him. he said he was taking tobacco money. 8 dr. russell, the scientist of the addiction 9 expert from great brittain, who wrote in the 10 british medical journal, lancet, and wanted to 11 advocate a low-tar and medium/nicotine cigarette. 12 dr. proctor said he was taking cigarette money. 13 he was corrupt. not just wrong, but corrupt. 14 the american medical association for saying 15 they did not think a warning label was necessary 16 because everybody knew the risks of smoking way 17 back in 1964. he trashed the ama and said they 18 took tobacco money. not just wrong, but corrupt. 19 and he never offered any evidence to prove it. 20 he never proved dr. wynder took money. he never 21 proved dr. russell took money, and he did not 22 exactly explain to you what the ama situation was 23 all about. not just wrong, but corrupt. 24 and if you are a historian for the defense, 25 like dr. stueck, not only do you get smeared, you 1 get smeared in print. he charged people like 2 dr. stueck of engaging in historical malpractice, 3 being a black mark on the profession, and being 4 easily seduced by money. 5 in one article he smeared 40 distinguished 6 historians without a second thought. and, in 7 fact, in his article and in this courtroom one of 8 those historians was dr. steven ambrose. who is 9 he? he was a bit of a giant in the historical 10 profession. we heard that he was personally 11 selected by president eisenhower to be his 12 biographer. this is the man who founded the d-day 13 museum in new orleans to honor our soldiers. 14 he is the author of the book band of brothers which 15 led to the mini series, was advisor to the mini 16 series. was advisor to tom hanks on saving 17 private ryan. this man was not beyond the reach 18 of dr. proctor. 19 if you disagree with dr. robert neal proctor 20 at stanford, look out. it is kind of ironic that 21 the man who sat there and talked about how the 22 tobacco industry had plans to smear researchers 23 which, by the way, you never saw any evidence of, 24 to smear researchers engaged in exactly that same 25 behavior in print, repeatedly, and in this 1 courtroom under oath. 2 and finally, you heard about his little 3 adventure regarding the university of florida. 4 and no matter how self-righteous he defended that 5 conduct, in fact, he was proud of it, what he 6 really tried to do was to intimidate four graduate 7 students trying to work their way through college. 8 what were they doing that was so horrible? 9 they were researching newspapers for historians 10 for the defense in one of these cases. collecting 11 newspaper articles. 12 so he finds out that they are doing it. he 13 gets their names from dr. kyriakoudes. he gets on 14 the internet, looks up their faculty advisor, 15 finds someone he met at a conference who was from 16 the university of florida, and e-mails them and 17 says, hey, you know this is going on, and by the 18 way, to my e-mail, let me attach these two 19 articles in which he smears all the historians who 20 work for the tobacco industry. 21 when nothing happened after he let the florida 22 professor know about it, he told her to bring it 23 up at a faculty meeting. when he was told that 24 there was a florida sunshine law that might govern 25 his e-mails with the florida professor, he deleted 1 them, which, again, is kind of ironic, a man 2 covering his tracks deleting e-mails. ironic 3 behavior for a man who came to you to talk about 4 concealment. 5 now, as it turns out, the university of 6 florida history department did not need any help 7 running their own department. they did not need 8 any help from dr. proctor invading the students' 9 privacy, researching the name of that faculty 10 advisor or telling the faculty how to run the 11 department because they had it under control all 12 the time. 13 one of the faculty advisors knew, was fully 14 informed, and did not care, correct? 15 i think that is right. 16 picking on colleges students working their way 17 through college. real profile and encouraging. 18 so why was this a big deal? why did they make 19 a big deal out of this? 20 because dr. proctor, on so many issues, so 21 many things in this case, asks you to take a lot 22 on faith, on his word. he often makes statements 23 unsupported by the evidence. he often makes 24 statements that were contradicted by the evidence. 25 i'm going to take a look at a few. too often 1 they gave -- we gave you proof, they gave you 2 proctor. and i'm suggesting that anything this 3 man said should be taken with a grain of salt. 4 what am i talking about? you even saw this 5 one this afternoon. dr. chin lee of r.j. reynolds 6 wanted to do ames testing back in 1978. he is told 7 legal says, no. 8 and then dr. proctor moved on. what he wanted 9 you to think was the testing was not done and the 10 legal department is running the r&d department. 11 they are running the science, and no mutagenicity 12 testing, which is what he was asking to do, was 13 done. 14 what dr. proctor knew all along but did not 15 want to tell you was that it was done. legal was 16 overruled. and if you take a look at the dates, 17 this is a 1983 memo from the same dr. chin lee to 18 dr. rodgman who originally told them what legal 19 had said -- go to the next one -- the r&d 20 department of r.j. reynolds has been engaged in 21 mutagenicity testing of cigarette smoke condensate 22 and tobacco additives by the ames salmonella 23 microsome method since 1978. 24 since the date of the first memo that 25 dr. proctor showed you, they were doing ames 1 testing in '78, '79, '80, '80, '80, '82, '83. 2 every year. and you saw evidence that they were 3 going to do it in the future. so the ames testing 4 was done. 5 dr. proctor would not want you to know that. 6 again, ironic that a man came here to talk 7 about concealment concealed this fact from you. 8 under what kind of evidence did he provide 9 here? it would be classified as untrue. 10 now, dr. proctor called filters a gimmick, a 11 myth. here's his testimony. a gimmick. and if 12 you look down at the bottom, he calls it a myth. 13 well, did you see a single scientific study 14 offered in support of that? did you see a surgeon 15 general's report that said filters did not work? 16 did you see a surgeon general's report that said 17 filters do not lower lung cancer rates? 18 he did not show you anything. he wanted you to 19 take it on faith; take it on the word of 20 dr. robert neal proctor. 21 well, what did we show you? we showed you 22 surgeon general reports from 1975 to 1990 that do 23 not say that filters were a gimmick. they all say 24 filter tipped cigarettes lower lung cancer rates. 25 filter cigarettes work. 1 that is not what you heard from dr. proctor. 2 you saw one staff report from a congressional 3 committee written by politicians in 1957. you saw 4 that over and over again. whatever the case was 5 in 1957, by the time we were all around to the 6 '70s the surgeon general is consistent, consistent 7 in saying filters were a benefit. 8 and remember dr. russell? what did he say? 9 he said it is unlikely that any single measure has 10 saved more lives or done more to reduce smoking 11 related disease than to switch from plane to 12 filter tipped cigarettes which began in the late 13 1950s and continued throughout the 1960s. 14 we gave you proof. they gave you proctor. 15 dr. proctor called ctr research distraction 16 research. conceded it was good research by good 17 scientists published in good journals, but 18 unrelated to smoking and health. 19 we showed you otherwise. articles dealing 20 with addiction. articles dealing with coronary 21 artery disease. articles dealing with 22 bronchogenic carcinoma, pulmonary, which is lung 23 cancer, pulmonary cancer, clearly related to 24 smoking and health. 25 and do not take my word for it, because -- next 1 one -- this is just one, we showed you a bunch, 2 cited by the surgeon general of the united states, 3 ctr supported research. 4 and as you heard in the testimony, this 5 happened about 600 times. clearly related to 6 smoking and health. not distraction research. 7 we gave you proof. they gave you proctor. 8 dr. proctor told you that the cigarette 9 industry had a huge information campaign, that got 10 its messages from newspapers all around the 11 country. and the best you got from him is this: 12 plaintiff's exhibit 26, which if you look real 13 carefully, consists of five new york newspapers 14 and one boston newspaper. 15 he did not show you -- in fact, no plaintiff's 16 witness showed you a single issue of the 17 gainesville sun. not one. and there is a reason 18 for that. they did not show you a single issue of 19 the gainesville sun with an article slanted 20 towards the industry. 21 we put 44 issues of the gainesville sun into 22 evidence. read them. look at them and see what 23 they say about the power and effect of this 24 information. 25 the message that came through from those 1 articles is that smoking causes disease, smoking 2 could be hard to quit, and help is available if 3 you want to quit. 4 when you look at the instruction on 5 concealment, it says that the information 6 concealed must not be otherwise available to 7 mr. alexander; otherwise available in the 8 gainesville sun. smoking causes disease, smoking 9 could be hard to quit, and it is addictive above 10 the full front page, and of all ads for clinics 11 and the great american smoke out, this information 12 was clearly otherwise available. 13 but more to the point, the massive information 14 campaign, apparently never made it to alachua 15 county. 16 dr. proctor said that r.j. reynolds concealed 17 this internal work on the chemistry of tobacco, 18 but he did not show you anything that should have 19 been disclosed that was not. 20 we showed you sites -- and this is just one 21 surgeon general's report. we showed you sites of 22 all these articles written by reynolds' scientists 23 that appeared in print. these are all that are 24 just in one surgeon general's report. 25 he showed you some memos that suggested 1 reynolds was designed to ad campaigns to appeal to 2 14 year olds. you saw those documents again this 3 afternoon. 4 but the plaintiffs never showed you the ads. 5 we did. 6 take a look at this one. the first memo you 7 were shown at one of the hilton head 8 presentations, these are the ads that ran after t 9 it. which ad do you think is going to drive the 10 14 year old to the candy store to get a pack of 11 cigarettes and smoke until he stops being sick to 12 become a regular smoker? 13 the guy in the middle who looks like an 14 undertaker or the guy with the -- holding his 15 chest in the upper left-hand corner? this is what 16 supposedly was going to appeal to 14 year olds. 17 look at the next one. 18 these are the ones that ran after the document 19 in the 1980s. you could use your own judgment 20 whether or not these appeal to 14 year olds. 21 we showed you the ads. we gave you the proof. 22 they just gave you dr. proctor's opinion. 23 now, i told you in opening finally that you 24 would see ideas that were a little bit like 25 suggestions in a suggestion box, ideas that never 1 went anywhere but made trial exhibits or going to 2 be trial exhibits forever. you saw some of them 3 here. you saw some of them this afternoon. 4 there was a proposal for a -- you saw the 5 specially filter -- treated filtertip that would 6 change color. one of claude teague's earliest 7 memos. it went nowhere. dr. proctor admitted it 8 went nowhere. 9 the proposal for a youth brand with tar levels 10 going back to the levels of the 1950s. never went 11 anywhere. 12 even the idea of the low-tar, medium/nicotine 13 cigarette that dr. proctor had to admit was 14 actually motivated by the ideas of people like the 15 national cancer institute, the surgeon general, 16 dr. russell and the tobacco working group. 17 and by the way, lest you forget that that 18 project had a noble goal, not one to addict 19 people. 20 look at dr. russell's article in the british 21 medical journal. besides having low-tar and co 22 yield, the least harmful cigarettes for heavy 23 smokers may be those with a high, rather than low 24 nicotine yield. 25 remember, the reason was people smoke for the 1 nicotine but it is the tar that gives them disease. 2 and if you bring the nicotine down -- if you bring 3 the tar down, you bring the nicotine down, too. 4 the idea was to maintain the nicotine but lower 5 the tar so you would get less of the harmful 6 ingredients of smoke. that was the goal behind 7 them. not to addict people, but in the end this 8 idea went nowhere. it could not produce a 9 commercially acceptable cigarette. 10 but it was the defense that had to point that 11 out. in so many cases with the stupid ideas, 12 dr. proctor was content to lay out the document 13 and move on, leaving it for you to assume that 14 happened. again, it did not happen. 15 the man liked to use the word misleading. he 16 did a fair amount of misleading. and he told you 17 things that were unproven. in the end he would 18 present a case that was unrelated to 19 mr. alexander. 20 as i said earlier, the plaintiff has to 21 establish legal cause. they must prove that r.j. 22 reynolds did something wrong that affected 23 mr. alexander's choices. in other words, but for 24 r.j. reynolds conduct mr. alexander would not have 25 been injured. 1 now, i've got a diagram for this as well. the 2 conduct -- call it negligence, call it 3 concealment, call it product defect -- must have 4 caused, must have affected mr. alexander's choices 5 and that leads to copd. 6 but for the conduct, but for those things, 7 mr. alexander would have made different choices. 8 the conduct has to be why he started or continued 9 to smoke. 10 and like addiction, he is in the middle. he is 11 in the middle. the man with the choices is in the 12 middle. 13 so you have to ask yourself, is the reason he 14 started to smoke any conduct of r.j. reynolds? is 15 the reason he started to smoke -- continued to 16 smoke due to any conduct of r.j. reynolds? 17 and if r.j. reynolds had not done things, 18 would he have started to smoke, would he have 19 continued to smoke? 20 well, we know r.j. reynolds had nothing to do 21 with him starting to smoke, because we know his 22 first encounter with tobacco, we know from his 23 sister rosa lee, that his first encounter with 24 tobacco came when his father gave him tobacco to 25 chew when they were very, very young. 1 did r.j. reynolds do anything wrong to cause 2 mr. alexander to continue to smoke? 3 again, there is no evidence of that. there is 4 no evidence he saw the frank statement or heard of 5 ctr. there is no evidence he ever saw a pamphlet 6 or a statement from the tobacco institute or ctr. 7 there is no evidence he showed any interest 8 whatsoever in anything any tobacco company, 9 including r.j. reynolds tobacco company, said. 10 everything that dr. proctor said on the 11 witness stand and talked about has nothing to do, 12 nothing to do with mr. alexander. 13 i posed this question in the beginning and 14 it is true today: dr. proctor's testimony, all of 15 it, what has this got to do with john paul 16 alexander? 17 the answer is, nothing. 18 so exit dr. proctor and dr. kyriakoudes, the 19 historian turned advertising experts, and even 20 here they come up empty. 21 what you heard this afternoon was 22 mr. alexander happened to be an african american 23 smoker which at some point switched to menthol. 24 that is the fact. that is the proof. 25 there is no evidence of exactly when he did and 1 there is no evidence at all of why he did. for 2 that reason alone, they cannot meet the burden of 3 proof without proof. and you should reject any 4 argument based on marketing. 5 but what you are being asked to do -- what the 6 judge's instructions tell you you cannot do is to 7 substitute speculation for proof. 8 the plaintiff's best case here is that 9 mr. alexander was smoking a non-menthol product, 10 he saw an ad for menthol and he switched. now, 11 that is built on argument. that is not built on 12 proof. he could have switched because a friend 13 switched. he could have switched because he tried 14 one and he liked it. there is no evidence he 15 switched because of ads. none. dozens of 16 possibilities. 17 but even if it was true, it results in a 18 defense verdict, and here's why. you already saw 19 the surgeon general said that tobacco companies 20 did not create the menthol market. and it is true. 21 the companies could plead guilty to having pursued 22 and competed in the african american segment of 23 the market. 24 but as we saw in our scroll from ebony, so did 25 the navy, so did mcdonalds, so did burger king, so 1 did liquor, so did cars, so did beer, so did life 2 insurance. everybody was competing for a segment 3 of that market. and it is true that the companies 4 used a variety of ways to market there. well, 5 things like the kool jazz festival. 6 but as that whole litany i went through with 7 dr. kyriakoudes says, there is nothing wrong with 8 that; that is not wrongful conduct. it is 9 legitimate marketing tools. 10 so if mr. alexander saw an ad on the tv or in 11 a magazine laying around the service station or on 12 a billboard on the road or on a poster in a liquor 13 store -- and bear in mind, there is no evidence 14 that any of that happened, but if it did, and he 15 switched to a menthol cigarette as a result, your 16 response should be, so what; so what. 17 the conduct that affects his choices must be 18 wrongful and there is nothing wrongful about 19 lawfully marketing. 20 and dr. kyriakoudes told you everything that 21 you heard about was lawful. 22 it is not wrongful to try to improve your 23 brand image. it is not wrongful to try to take 24 market share from a competitor. it is not 25 wrongful to market to ethnic media -- in ethnic 1 media like ebony. 2 as a matter of fact, you saw the 1988 surgeon 3 general's report that it was ebony that was 4 pursuing the companies to advertise in it. not 5 the other way around. 6 this is marketing 101, and it bears 7 repeating. marketing 101 does not become 8 unlawfully just because the product is cigarettes 9 and just because the market is african americans. 10 so if we go back to our diagram, the chains 11 busted. they have identified no wrongful conduct 12 that caused mr. alexander to start smoking or to 13 continue to smoke. they have identified no wrongful 14 conduct that was the legal cause of his injury. 15 you have the instructions with you. you can 16 read it, but that chain is busted and the 17 plaintiff cannot bridge the gap. 18 now, if everything i've said thus far is un 19 persuasive, we are going to get to the issue of 20 damages. we will get to the issue of damages. and 21 you have -- if you decide to return a verdict in 22 favor of mrs. alexander, you will have to decide on 23 an amount of damages. this is hard. it is hard to 24 put a value on life. human life is precious from 25 the wound to the grave. 1 mr. avera asked for $2 million pain and 2 suffering and $1 million for the future. $3 3 million is a lot of money even today. 4 now, you have got a jury instruction there that 5 says whatever award you make is supposed to be 6 fair and just in light of the evidence that you have 7 heard in this case regarding mrs. alexander's loss 8 of mr. alexander. 9 you heard some talk about how much sports 10 figures make or what expert billing rates are. 11 that is not in the jury instructions. the jury 12 instruction is what is fair and just according to 13 the evidence in this case. 14 so my question is what evidence did you hear 15 in this case? and the answer is you heard 16 precious little. 17 did you hear what kind of a father 18 mr. alexander was? if we heard that testimony, i 19 missed it. 20 apart from being a provider and a driver, did 21 we hear what kind of husband mr. alexander was? 22 if the testimony was there, i missed that, too. 23 did we hear what he did to his family? we 24 did not hear that testimony. 25 he had three daughters but we only heard from 1 two. in fact, we called one of the two. what did 2 you hear? you heard the life expectancy, the 3 joint life expectancy, i believe this is correct, 4 is eight years. 5 you saw his social security earning records. 6 those -- that is evidence in the case, and that 7 may be the only evidence you have to help you with 8 this issue. 9 and i would suggest that the evidence suggests 10 an award in the thousands, not in the millions, if 11 you should feel necessary to make an award in this 12 case. 13 if you make an award, compensate 14 mrs. alexander, not the lawyers. compensate her 15 based on the evidence you heard. not the 16 arguments you hear. 17 and finally, and it really is finally for me 18 because i do not get to speak again, if you go all 19 the way through the verdict form to the last 20 question, and you have found against my client on 21 either the conspiracy or concealment, you have to 22 decide whether punitive damages are warranted. 23 and if we get that far, if we get to punitive 24 damages, you will have already completely 25 compensated mrs. alexander for her loss with 1 whatever figure you arrive at. 2 punitive damages are not about compensation or 3 making someone whole. punitive damages are about 4 more money. punitive damage is designed to punish 5 and deter, punish for conduct tantamount to being 6 a reckless disregard for human life, and as you 7 heard, the plaintiff must meet a higher level of 8 proof; clear and convincing evidence. 9 and i'm obviously here to argue that they have 10 proven no such thing. punish r.j. reynolds? you 11 heard testimony in the 1950s. you saw a document 12 from the 1950s that r.j. reynolds tried to take 13 the harmful substances out of cigarettes. 14 as you see, the very last paragraph there, 120 15 separate experiments using half a million 16 cigarettes. they were trying to get 17 benzo{a}pyrene and that family of chemicals out of 18 their cigarettes. 19 now, you heard from mr. avera, well, they told 20 people keep smoking, we are working on it. well, 21 they were working on it. you got to understand, 22 you heard that when we were talking about claude 23 teague about how he started at reynolds as a bench 24 chemist, never became a vice president, but when 25 we were talking about dr. proctor, we heard that 1 dr. teague came to r.j. reynolds after serving in 2 europe in world war ii. this was the greatest 3 generation. this was the world war ii generation. 4 they had just let nazi germany imperil japan. 5 presented with a problem like this, is it 6 unremarkable that they decided if there is 7 something wrong with cigarettes, we are capable of 8 fixing it? and this is one of the efforts they 9 made to fix it. in the 1950s. 10 in the 1960s, we had r.j. reynolds trying to 11 cooperate with the federal government. now, 12 you have heard about these documents that these 13 documents were all written, they were never 14 expected to see the light of date and this is what 15 people were really thinking. 16 well, this one is too. as you heard, it is 17 from the head of r&d, from the president of the 18 company, and what does he say? in cooperation 19 with others you should push the work concerning 20 tobacco and health. you should prepare a plan to 21 foster any relationship with government personnel 22 in the quest for mutual understanding of facts 23 ultimately to gain their cooperation and proper 24 research of the subject. 25 2. again, written while nobody's looking. if 1 there is a safer cigarette, let us continue and 2 increase our efforts on this program. please 3 prepare a plan to carry it out. 4 this document was prepared, as you can see, on 5 the top in 1968. this was at the outset of the 6 tobacco working group. 7 let us go to the next one. 8 tobacco working group is something dr. proctor 9 was asked about. again about '68, nine or ten 10 years. it was under the aegis of the national 11 cancer institute. members of the public health 12 community were members, the tobacco institute, the 13 federal government and the national cancer 14 institute. this was a joint effort that went on 15 for nine years trying to develop a less hazardous 16 cigarette. r.j. reynolds fully participated in 17 that. 18 and one of those efforts -- the next one, 19 please -- one of those efforts, this is the 20 minutes of one of the meetings, one of those 21 efforts was to come up with a high -- low-tar 22 medium/nicotine cigarette. and there is the 23 document where the group says this is something 24 that we should go after. this is something that is 25 promising. r.j. reynolds cooperated in trying to 1 reduce the risk of smoking for those who would not 2 quit. 3 you saw some recites in the surgeon general's 4 report of r.j. reynolds' scientists. there were 5 others. r.j. reynolds' scientists published 6 articles in the science of tobacco, and as we saw, 7 they wound up being cited sometimes by the surgeon 8 general. 9 in the 1980s r.j. reynolds made a 10 revolutionary break through with something called 11 premiere. i asked dr. proctor about it. it was a 12 prototype cigarette that would heat rather than 13 burn tobacco. if you do not burn tobacco you do not 14 produce benzo{a}pyrene. test marketed. consumers 15 did not like it and it went nowhere. but it 16 lowered many of the constituents in cigarettes 17 that were associated with various diseases and 18 carcinogenesis. effort in the 1980s. 19 now, the purpose of punitive damages is to 20 deter future misconduct. you have heard that r.j. 21 reynolds admits that smoking causes disease, 22 including one in this case. you have heard that 23 r.j. reynolds admits that smoking is addictive. 24 you saw the reynolds website as it currently 25 exists. 1 and the days that dr. proctor talked about, 2 but never showed us, examples of sliming, he said, 3 public health authorities. here you have the 4 tobacco company with links on its website telling 5 and telling its customers that they should rely on 6 the conclusions of the u.s. surgeon general, the 7 centers for disease control and other public 8 health and medical officials when making decisions 9 regarding smoking. and if they need to know what 10 that advice is, there are links on its website to 11 all those -- all those sources you see there, 12 including several surgeon general's report, the 13 national cancer institute, the american cancer 14 society and the american heart association. 15 and you heard that reynolds has a database, a 16 document database of all the litigation; documents 17 such as you saw in this case. 18 when this case is over and you are freed from 19 the obligation that judge hulslander pulled on you 20 not to do outside research, when this case is 21 over, you can log on, anybody with the internet, 22 anybody with a computer, and you could read all 23 about anything you want to read about. claude 24 teague, alan rodgman, philip morris, anybody. 25 it is all publicly available on the r.j. reynolds 1 website. no secrets. rjr.com. 2 is this a reckless disregard for human life? 3 is this clear and convincing evidence? 4 i'd argue to you that this record is not one 5 that warrants money damages above and beyond 6 compensatory. punitive damages, i would suggest 7 to you, should not be available in this case. 8 mr. alexander was, by all accounts, a smart 9 man; a smart man who made choices throughout his 10 life. some of those choices were related to 11 smoking. 12 the choice to smoke was made in another era 13 and a time and a place lost to history. he 14 started with chewing tobacco given to him by his 15 parents and he continued to smoke, and made a 16 decision to continue to smoke every time he lit up 17 a cigarette. and he made that decision for 30 18 years while a warning label cautioned him against 19 the risks of what he was about to do. 20 we should respect those choices. 21 mr. alexander was not a victim during his life. 22 i'd ask you not to make him a victim after his 23 death. 24 now, this is only chance i get to speak to 25 you. the plaintiff has the burden of proof so 1 they get a chance at rebuttal. i have no idea 2 what mr. smith's going to say. but because i 3 cannot respond to him, i would ask one of you to be 4 my advocate in the jury room and respond as i 5 might so we can have everything on the table, 6 everything aired as you decide to make your very 7 important decisions as the finders of fact in this 8 case. 9 once again, thank you for your service. thank 10 you in advance for your work and deliberation in 11 arriving at a verdict. and i guess once we get 12 done here, it is going to be lunch time. thanks a 13 lot.
