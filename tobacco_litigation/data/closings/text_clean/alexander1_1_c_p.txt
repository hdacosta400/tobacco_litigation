1 mr. smith: good afternoon. 2 first of all, let me say on behalf of 3 everybody, ms. earline alexander, everyone else 4 who is participated in this case, thank you for your 5 jury service. 6 second of all, i want to tell you that i've 7 been doing this a long time and this is the first 8 time in which i can say a jury has literally lived 9 climactically through an entire year in four days. 10 monday was summer and today is winter. between them 11 we had spring and fall. it has been cold in here 12 and you have hot in here and in between, and you 13 have been attentive and you have listened carefully, 14 and everyone on both sides appreciates it 15 dramatically. 16 a little over a week ago i stood before you and 17 i told you what this case would be about, that we would 18 really be turning the light on some things that all 19 of you have learned in the last few weeks that most 20 americans do not know, and that is what really went on 21 in the tobacco industry for the last 50 years. 22 but before i go to that, i want to go back and 23 kind of go to where we started, and that is to 24 explain, as the court has just instructed you, this 25 is what is known as an engle progeny case. and by 1 now you all know that term in a way you never knew 2 when you came into this courtroom. 3 and an engle progeny case means that, as it 4 relates to mrs. alexander, we have to determine, the 5 first thing, whether or not her husband, john paul 6 alexander, is a member of the engle class. and if 7 he is a member of the engle class, as you have been 8 instructed and we will go over again, then certain 9 things cover him and apply to his case and answer a 10 great number of questions in this case. 11 the court: mr. smith, let me ask you -- can 12 you see past the -- 13 a juror: no, your honor. 14 the court: they cannot see you. 15 mr. smith: they cannot? 16 the court: if you want them to see that, you 17 go to move that. 18 mr. smith: yeah. i'll move this this way, 19 then. i was trying to keep it on the other side. 20 all right. how is that? better? 21 okay. thank you. 22 the court: go ahead. 23 mr. smith: so what do we have to do to 24 establish the engle class? well, there are several 25 things we told you in the beginning that you would have 1 to decide, and they are really not going to have to 2 be decided now. 3 first of all, it is been stipulated that he was 4 a resident and citizen. it has also been stipulated 5 that r.j. reynolds is -- produces the only product 6 that harmed him in this case. 7 cigarettes contain nicotine. you remember that 8 stipulation. and that brown & williamson, american 9 tobacco, all the brands that you have heard about, the 10 brands that caused his death, or the brands that 11 caused harm, if harm was caused, as the stipulation 12 would be, were all r.j. reynolds'. so that is not 13 before you. 14 and, finally, that he died of copd caused by 15 smoking. that is not in question. their expert and 16 our expert and the stipulation has been that that is 17 all been taken care of. 18 so we really are down to just one additional 19 qualification to put him in to the protections and 20 to give him the benefit of that class that was 21 established by the florida supreme court based on a 22 trial that was conducted many years ago, and that is 23 was he addicted to cigarettes. because if he was 24 addicted, we do not have to prove that nicotine is 25 addictive. because if he was addicted, we know that 1 nicotine is addictive because it is stipulated to and 2 it is been ruled upon. 3 so what do we have to prove? that he was 4 addicted. and how do we do that? well, first of 5 all, i told you and the court has already instructed 6 you that your greatest tool is your common sense and 7 experience. 8 this is a man who the evidence shows in this 9 case, pretty much uncontroverted evidence, that 10 sometime before he was 13, when we know he was 11 smoking, and as early as eight, that we know when he 12 was talking to his daughter in the later months, the 13 last years of his life, he said, i've been smoking 14 since i was eight years old. 15 but we know that between eight and 13 years old 16 in raiford, florida, this was a man who started 17 smoking cigarettes. we know that by the time he was 18 14 years old he was a regular smoker, and we know 19 that from the testimony of mattie davis, who was 20 then his -- when he was 16 and she was 16 they got 21 married in raiford. 22 we know that he smoked without ever ceasing 23 smoking from what would have been 1941 or '42 until 24 sometime after 1996. those facts are not in 25 controversy. 1 we know from medical records and we know from 2 the testimony of the witnesses who put it together 3 that he smoked an average of -- i think one of 4 the -- one of them says one-and-a-half to three 5 packs; one of them says two packs. he is got 6 testimony of people saying he smoked one-and-a-half 7 packs. 8 we know that he was, quote, a heavy smoker. we 9 know that not because of the evidence we have 10 contended; we know that their expert, their doctor, 11 when asked by mr. avera, was he a heavy smoker, 12 said, yes, he was a heavy smoker. we know that. 13 we know that he had a habit of smoking and it 14 pretty well followed. he smoked when he first got 15 up in the morning. there was testimony from his 16 daughter jeanette that when he would get up and go 17 to the bathroom in the morning, he would get a 18 cigarette. 19 we know that he smoked at his breakfast table. 20 we know that he smoked when he went to work because 21 we have people who have known him and worked with 22 him in the past. we know that he smoked all day, 23 and we know that he smoked when he came home at 24 night. 25 we know from the evidence in this case that he 1 oftentimes lit one cigarette from the cigarette he 2 was just finishing smoking. we know that when he 3 got home at night he smoked. we know the ashtrays 4 in the house remained full. we know that he smoked 5 until he went to bed now. 6 we know he smoked in the house; we know he 7 smoked in the car. we know he smoked at breakfast; 8 we know he smoked at night. we know that, in fact, 9 and it is uncontroverted, that he got up during the 10 night and would smoke a cigarette. that is how much 11 this man smoked. 12 i submit to you that we will probably never 13 see -- the medical records show that he had a 14 60-plus pack year of smoking, pack years meaning 15 that is a measure that they give for smokers. that is 16 an incredible number. but the truth of the case -- 17 of the matter is that he actually probably had 18 something more like a 90- to 100-pack year smoking 19 history in his life, a number we probably will never 20 see again. 21 we know that he was, in fact, in 1996 -- had a 22 stroke. in 1996 when he went to the hospital he saw 23 two doctors, first in -- i think the first was one 24 at the end of december; he later sees one in early 25 january, dr. connor and dr. melvin. 1 and you remember what was put up on the board 2 before you. and i want you to remember this, folks. 3 at that time there was not any litigation, there 4 was not any class being discussed, there was not any 5 membership being discussed. this were -- these were 6 two doctors who were analyzing and diagnosing their 7 patient. and they diagnosed their patient under the 8 international code 305.1, which both sides have 9 agreed was nicotine dependence. 10 so before anybody had a lawyer and started 11 talking about a lawsuit, the medical treatment and 12 medical history -- your common sense would show you 13 a man smoked that long was nicotine-dependent. but, 14 more importantly, the doctors who treated him at the 15 time said he was nicotine-dependent. 16 we know that we produced expert testimony from 17 dr. tonia werner. and dr. werner opined to you 18 that, yes, he was cigarette-addicted; yes, it does 19 not mean he loses all control; but it is -- as 20 dr. burns said in the first testimony that was 21 played to you, it is, in fact, something that makes 22 it untrue to say that someone is now smoking of 23 their own free will. that is untrue according to 24 dr. burns and untrue according to tonia werner, in 25 the sense that you can stop, but it is a barrier to 1 that ever happening. 2 we know that even after he was treated and told 3 by a doctor, according to his daughter, that, if you 4 do not quit smoking, it is going to kill you. he went 5 home and he took his doral cigarettes and put them 6 up, and we know that even after he had been on a 7 respirator she caught him smoking, because he 8 continued to smoke even when facing death. 9 we know all that. that is the case for 10 addiction. 11 and what is their response to that? they bring 12 in one expert who says, i do not believe he is 13 addicted. this is an expert, dr. myers -- i want 14 you to remember the following. this is an expert 15 who, 22 years after the surgeon general of the 16 united states defined for this nation what addiction 17 was, he still does not agree with it. 18 this is an expert who gave an opinion that is 19 inconsistent with the position taken by his current 20 hospital group that he works for and inconsistent 21 with the prior university that he worked for. 22 this is a man who said -- and i -- i want you 23 to know i'm going to give the facts as i remember 24 them, but you remember them yourselves, but i know 25 you will remember this. this is a man who said he 1 did not consider a chain smoker or a heavy smoker 2 somebody who smoked, you know, two packs a day. he 3 was not even willing to say that a person would be 4 addicted, when he was asked by mr. avera, well, what 5 if they smoked six packs a day? 6 well, they could be. not necessarily. 7 ladies and gentlemen, the weight of the 8 evidence, based on your common sense, the medical 9 history of the patient, what you have observed and 10 what you have heard from the witnesses, is that this 11 was a man who is been smoking for more than 60 years 12 at the time he became ill and even then could not 13 stop. that is an addiction. under the dsm criteria 14 he was addicted. that is the finding. that is the 15 finding, we submit, you must make. 16 now, if that happens and when that happens, we 17 then go the engle criteria. the engle criteria, 18 which has been explained to you, but i want to go 19 over a couple of them -- 20 blow them up, just, please. 21 the first one you know, chronic obstructive 22 pulmonary disease. that is all he had. that is what 23 killed him. nobody questions it. 24 that nicotine in cigarettes is addictive, we 25 know that. even without that instruction, you have 1 heard evidence of that and nobody controverts it 2 today. although that is today. we will show in a few 3 minutes that for 50 years they knew it was addictive 4 and they denied it, even under oath to the united 5 states congress as late as 1994, that r.j. reynolds 6 and the other tobacco conspirators denied what they 7 knew was the truth. 8 number 3, that the defendants placed cigarettes 9 on the market that were defective and unreasonably 10 dangerous. now, for us to prevail, what we have to 11 show is that the fact that they put a cigarette on 12 the market that was defective -- defective? we 13 do not know the manner, as someone's suggested. yes, 14 what we do know is it is been found it was defective 15 and unreasonably dangerous. 16 because of engle, we do not have to prove the 17 defect, but you heard from dr. proctor early that 18 there were thousands of carcinogens that have been 19 identified. there have been -- there is rayfield 20 activity that is been identified. there is tar 21 that is been known about in levels which we know 22 cause cancer and other lung-related diseases, and we 23 know that they have never -- really never 24 effectively been removed. 25 we know that filters were a fraud. we know 1 that light cigarettes were actually a boon because 2 you got the benefit of selling the light cigarette 3 with the nicotine so that people would actually 4 consume more nicotine -- more cigarettes to get more 5 nicotine. and we know that low-tar cigarettes have 6 not proven to be more safe as it relates especially 7 to copd. those facts are known. 8 now, someone said, well, what do you mean by 9 defective and unreasonably dangerous? what about -- 10 well, let me give you an example. if you are driving 11 down the road and the brakes do not work, your car 12 has got a defect. it is unreasonably dangerous. and 13 nobody would question if somebody put the brake in 14 or if they knew that the brake was put in wrong or 15 that they knew the brake did not work or they knew 16 the speedometer -- excuse me, the accelerator stuck, 17 it would be defective and dangerous. 18 the defective and dangerous cigarette killed 19 him. and how do we know that? because their own 20 expert says he died of copd caused by smoking. it is 21 what was in the smoke that caused the copd that 22 killed him. 23 that the -- that the defendants concealed or 24 omitted material information not otherwise known or 25 made -- or available, knowing that the material was 1 false or misleading, or failed to disclose a 2 material fact concerning the health effects or 3 addictive nature. 4 we will get to those. i'll remind you of some of 5 the false and misleading things they have done. but 6 remember this. you have heard the instruction. 7 they are going to get up and say, but you have got to 8 show that that is what -- what you have to show is 9 that if he had knowledge, it was less than they had. 10 and if their concealment of information was less 11 than what he -- what was concealed and what he knew 12 was less than what they concealed and what they 13 knew, if he did not know of the material information 14 and they did, then that is causation. 15 that the defendants agreed to conceal or omit 16 information regarding the health effects of 17 cigarettes or their addictive nature with the 18 intention that smokers and the public would rely on 19 this information to their detriment. 20 the supreme court has found that if he is a 21 member of this class, you may now apply the law that 22 says they did it and they intended to do it for the 23 purpose of making sure that people would rely on the 24 information to their detriment, that they misled the 25 public and they intended for the public to be 1 misled, and that people just like john paul 2 alexander, and we will show you john paul alexander, 3 were victims of that concealment. 4 and, again, the question you will read and was 5 read to you is: did he have less information than 6 they had? and of course he did. 7 that all of the defendants sold and supplied 8 cigarettes that were defective. in this case it is 9 only rjr that matters. and that all of the 10 defendants were negligent. 11 they were negligent in how they produced the 12 cigarette. they were negligent in what they did not 13 disclose. it has been determined they were 14 negligent. 15 and if you find that that negligence, failing 16 to disclose information, failing to improve the 17 cigarette, failing -- whatever that negligence was, 18 if that negligence was a cause of a defective 19 cigarette, was a cause of the danger, was a cause of 20 misleading, then that is a cause of his injury. 21 ladies and gentlemen, i want to go very briefly 22 back and remind you of some of the things that i 23 think are important. but before i go there, very 24 quickly, we have an issue in this case called the 25 statute of limitations. 1 now, the difference on the statute of 2 limitations is, they are saying, okay. smoking 3 killed him, and -- smoking killed him, our 4 cigarettes killed him and caused copd, but he knew 5 or he should have known that -- and, by the way, 6 it is not going to be -- read the instruction given. 7 it says that he knew he had copd or he reasonably 8 should have known -- not could have known, should 9 have known -- he had copd caused by smoking. 10 now, that is an interesting argument for them to 11 make, because, remember, in 1990 r.j. reynolds was 12 still denying publicly that copd was caused by 13 cigarette smoking. but they want you to think that 14 this man, who their own expert says -- their own 15 expert yesterday says did not know about copd or 16 emphysema or chronic bronchitis till sometime 17 in '96, because how would he have otherwise known 18 it? 19 we are talking about a man who maybe had a 20 fifth-grade education, maybe read at a third-grade 21 level, who was diagnosed as unable to read, at least 22 on one of his times being put in the hospital. they 23 say that that man should have known that he had 24 copd, even though they -- there is nothing to suggest 25 that he knew what copd or emphysema or chronic 1 bronchitis even was. 2 they say, yeah, but he had a cough. well, 3 according to the witnesses he is had a cough on and 4 off throughout his life for some -- from the 1950s, 5 and according to the expert testimony that you heard 6 in the beginning about "of all people who have a 7 cough, only twenty percent ever develop a lung disease." 8 so, consequently, that would not have told him that 9 there was any change in his life. 10 but let us go to what the facts are that we know 11 as to the condition he was in according to the 12 evidence in this case. 13 go to fayson, please. 14 you heard from mr. fayson. this is 15 mr. fayson's testimony. 16 "how often did you work -- how often did you 17 work with him, fix cars, in the '90s?" 18 "about three days a week sometimes. sometimes 19 he just came to pick me up at home." 20 "and, once again, how did you get 21 transportation to the job?" 22 "down to the job?" 23 "yeah." 24 "mr. paul took me." 25 "and earlier than the '90s had you at times 1 worked with him?" 2 "earlier -- early in the '90s?" 3 "earlier than the 1990s." 4 "he taught me how to fix cars. that is it. you 5 know, something wrong with my car, i could ask him." 6 "did you observe him smoke cigarettes?" 7 "yes." 8 "did you happen to know the brand?" 9 "salem." 10 "okay. do you know how much he smoked?" 11 go to the next section, please, and then cut 12 down to here. 13 "now, was he able to do the work fixing cars in 14 the '90s?" 15 "well, until he got sick about '95, as i know 16 of." 17 "before that did you ever notice him not being 18 able to do his job?" 19 "no." 20 "did he ever complain to you that he was sick?" 21 "no." 22 "did he ever say anything about being sick?" 23 "no." 24 go to mr. hines, please. 25 you heard from jack hines. now, these are not 1 people are not family. they are not -- these are 2 people that were his friends a long time ago or his 3 co-workers. 4 "did he ever complain to you" -- you know, 5 mr. hines is the one they say, well, he noticed he 6 was short of breath one time at the back fence. 7 that is their evidence. 8 "did he ever complain to you about being short 9 of breath?" 10 "no, sir." 11 "when he would work, how would you describe the 12 kind of work he was doing?" 13 "he was working on sometimes engines and 14 tune-ups, a timing change. he kept working 15 tirelessly. he always worked." 16 "and do you recall visiting him, seeing him 17 working on cars, after 1990?" 18 "yes, sir." 19 "how would you describe his energy level?" 20 go to the next section. 21 "were you able to watch him do work from time 22 to time?" 23 "yes." 24 "and were you able to talk with him and watch 25 him walk and talk from time to time?" 1 "yes, sir." 2 "even in the early '90s, how would you describe 3 that he appeared in terms of his energy?" 4 answer: "he had high energy." 5 go to mr. carnegie, please. 6 "when you saw him after you had returned from 7 the military, other than adjusting for age, how did 8 his health appear to you?" 9 "i'd say he was very ill -- very well, but he 10 had slowed down a little bit. he was not moving as 11 fast. he slowed down." 12 "it had been 20-something years by then, 13 right?" 14 "yes." 15 go on. 16 "did you ever observe -- do you remember 17 observing him at any time you saw him coughing?" 18 "somewhere -- it was back during the time when 19 i got back. he was with duncan back there in the 20 house. he had a cough and his voice had changed a 21 little bit." 22 "did you notice him in any other way being 23 ill?" 24 "no." 25 "did you notice it affected his ability to do 1 work?" 2 "no, it did not." 3 "did he ever comment to you that he was not 4 feeling well?" 5 "no." 6 now, since that is the evidence you have in 7 front of you, that in the 1990s he was working, but 8 we have their expert, who if you remember yesterday 9 when i read his testimony, their expert, 10 dr. stueck -- 11 depo, please. 12 dr. stueck, when he was preparing his 13 testimony, he called him -- this is his -- what he 14 said. 15 "in the past i think you have" -- question -- 16 "actually have" -- well, before i do that, sorry. i 17 left a thought. 18 "on mr. carnegie, the fact that he -- 'he' 19 meaning john alexander -- was quite successful as a 20 mechanic, what importance was that to you?" 21 "by quite successful i mean successful in the 22 expectations we would have for someone doing 23 that" -- 24 go on. 25 -- "kind of work. well, he was a person of 1 some intelligence, some -- he was put in somewhat of 2 a managerial position. he was a person of some 3 responsibility." 4 i'll go down. 5 "he essen- -- yeah, i think that if you combine 6 what carnegie says to the fact that after he left 7 his last job with the service station he essentially 8 opened up his own business in his yard, which was 9 auto mechanic, it shows considerable well-skilled, 10 initiative, you know, entrepreneurial, i suppose, 11 ambition. 12 "part of my reaction to the carnegie deposition 13 was in combination with the other information about 14 his, in effect, having his own business there in, 15 what was it, the late '80s or the early '90s about 16 his home." 17 we know that he worked for -- one of the last 18 gas stations he worked for in the late '80s was 19 napoleon filer. we asked mr. filer, "did he ever 20 complain about being sick?" 21 "no." 22 "how did he work?" 23 "energetic, high energy." 24 "did you ever know him to be sick and unable to 25 do a job?" 1 "no." 2 what did mr. filer say about him? mr. filer 3 said, "i did not know he was sick until i learned he 4 was sick after i went by to see him. i never knew 5 he was sick." 6 that is the evidence in this case. and on that, 7 when no one was around him -- you know, think about 8 it. r.j. reynolds has taken everybody's deposition 9 they could find, every family member they could 10 find, anything they could find. and you know what? 11 they never got the silver bullet. 12 not one person has ever said that man, before 13 1996 said, i do not feel well. we know we have the 14 records in 1996. you will note they want you to 15 speculate, well, yeah, but there is some -- some 16 history of copd. 17 nothing that we know of. we never found it. 18 we do know this, that no one has ever said, 19 certainly before 1990, that this man was sick, 20 looked sick, acted sick or said he was sick. it is a 21 false issue. and it is their burden of proof on that 22 issue. 23 i want to go very quickly to some other issues 24 in the case. first of all, i want to talk about -- 25 we talked about, and you heard dr. proctor and you 1 saw dr. proctor and you heard dr. kyriakoudes. 2 you have heard it at length about 1953, tobacco was in 3 a panic, they had a meeting in new york, and here's 4 what they said. 5 37, please. 6 they got with the research directors -- 7 go to the next page, please. 8 they got to the research directors, and what is 9 the first thing the first research directors -- of 10 the four research directors they interviewed for 11 hill & knowlton, the top pr firm, they said -- one 12 of the men said, "it is fortunate for us that 13 cigarettes are a habit they cannot break." that is 14 the first thing said after they got together. 15 what do we know happened next? well, we know 16 that they started coming up with reasons -- 17 go to the next highlighted section, please. 18 go to the next -- next document, i think 39, 19 please. 20 video tech operator: 39? 21 mr. smith: 39. 22 we know this. we know that in february of 23 1953 -- go to the highlighted section. 24 in february of 1953 claude teague -- and, by 25 the way, he was not a man, as it was suggested, with 1 a typewriter and a file and an idea. he was a man 2 that, if you remember the documents, he rose to some 3 level towards vice president. we know this, that he 4 was with the company for some 30 years, because 5 we have got documentation of him -- of his 6 communications and research over a 30-year period of 7 time. and we know that -- even before they met in 8 1953, we know that they knew there was an 9 etiological likelihood of lung cancer caused by 10 cigarettes. that is before they got together. 11 that is before the wynder report really had hit the 12 news. 13 go to the next document, please, number... 14 oh, i want to switch gears for just one second. 15 i want to go back and talk about something else 16 about the tobacco companies. 17 we know that their strategy was, from 1953 on, 18 to create a false controversy, to create a sense of 19 doubt. and we know from the experts, dr. stueck, 20 and we even know from the expert dr. truncale that 21 they had people in the 1980s, they had people in the 22 1990s saying things that they were not -- that 23 were not true. 24 now, what do we know they were about? well, 25 let us talk a little bit about the issue of -- 1 go to number 40, please. 2 number 40. this is one of the first things 3 they came up with. this is literally a couple days 4 after the meeting. this is just an example of many, 5 many that we put in and many that were heard in 6 engle. this is an example. claude teague, in one 7 of his first jobs, ideas is, well, i've got an idea. 8 have you noticed when people look at cigarette 9 filter tips, if it turns colors they tend to think 10 it filters out things? "while the use of such color 11 change material would probably have little or no 12 effect on the actual efficiency of the filter tip 13 material, the advertising and sales advantages are 14 obvious." 15 that is what their thinking was right away. and 16 how do we know that the filter tip was false? 17 because we know that in 1957 there were hearings in 18 front of the united states congress resulting in the 19 1958 false advertising document that you have in 20 here in which the united states congress said they 21 have been making false health claims for years, and 22 on the filter tip they are -- americans are buying 23 into this and it is a false claim. and they 24 actually criticized the ftc for not being more 25 aggressive. 3007 1 i asked dr. stueck, do not they -- did not they 2 even have, before 1957, a long history of false and 3 misleading advertising? 4 and their expert said, yes, based on what he 5 had observed, they did have a long history of making 6 false health claims about their product. 7 go to the next document, which is number 92, 8 please. 9 and it worked. what happened? 1957 -- 1956, 10 sales went up. they went up all the way through 11 1964 without a bleep. they increased at record 12 levels. and why? because they advertised and they 13 targeted their advertising. 14 and what were the companies back then? lucky 15 strike, camel, pall mall. those were the three that 16 were the most advertised. those were the three that 17 led in sales. and those were the three that were 18 smoked by mr. alexander. 19 but we know some other things that came out 20 during that time period. we know that they lied 21 about addiction. 22 go to document number 136, please. 23 1959, a study, 1959, by philip morris, 24 internal -- one of the co-conspirators in this case, 25 as you know. 1 next page, please. 2 study on the reasons people smoke. addiction. 3 their words. 4 then jumped up and said, well, what -- let us go 5 to a philip morris document, 1959, document 6 number 138. 7 go to the highlighted section, please. 8 what did mr. rodgman for r.j. reynolds say, 9 1959? "the physiological requirements of the smoker 10 with respect to nicotine can be met by the 11 application of the optimum amount of nicotine to the 12 extracted tobacco." 13 163, please. 14 next highlighted section, please. 15 this is tobacco. this is a brown & williamson 16 document. this is in 1961. "smoking demonstrably 17 is a habit based on a combination of psychological 18 and physiological pleasure, and it also has strong 19 indications of being an addiction. it differs in 20 important features from addiction to other alkaloid 21 drugs, but yet there are sufficient similarities to 22 justify stating that smokers are nicotine addicts." 23 next -- and go to 4- -- to 489, please. 24 years later, a study for rjr, "realistically, 25 if our company is to survive and prosper over the 1 long term, we must get our share of the youth 2 market." 3 and guess what? they wanted to tailor a 4 cigarette to the youth market. 5 next highlighted section. 6 "in contrast, once that learning period is 7 over, the physical effects become of overriding 8 importance and desirability to the confirmed smoker 9 and the psychological effects, except the 10 tension-relieving effects, largely wane." 11 in other words, they start smoking for the 12 psychology of it, but we get them hooked on the 13 physiology of it and then we have them. 14 and what did they say? all of these years they 15 know -- 16 go to -- i think it is 538, please. 17 538. this is a document much later. question 18 comes up. man writes a letter, said, i'm 19 particularly interested in knowing if nicotine has 20 any habit-forming properties. 21 and what is the answer? 22 go to the next section, please. 23 next section, please. 24 alan rodman, rjr. "the two questions" -- this 25 is about nicotine addiction -- "are answerable, but 1 briefly, i doubt whether we at rjr want to be on the 2 record with the answers." 3 that is what the american people were getting 4 from tobacco companies. 5 and how long did they keep it up? 6 go to 976, please. 7 how long, after all they knew? 1994, united 8 states congress. after all the addiction materials 9 that you have seen in the internal documents that they 10 never released to the public, this is what they 11 still said: 12 (videotape was played:) 13 representative wyden: "let me begin my 14 questioning on the matter of whether or not nicotine 15 is addictive. let me ask you first, and i'd like to 16 go down the row, whether each of you believes that 17 nicotine is not addictive. i heard virtually all of 18 you touch on it. just yes or no. 19 "do you believe nicotine is not addictive." 20 mr. campbell: "i believe nicotine is not 21 addictive, yes." 22 representative wyden: "mr. johnston?" 23 mr. j. johnston: "mr. congressman, cigarettes 24 and nicotine clearly do not meet the classic 25 definitions of addiction. there is no 1 intoxication." 2 representative wyden: "we will take that as a 3 'no.' and, again, time is short. if you can 4 just -- i think each of you believe is nicotine is 5 not addictive. we just would like to have" -- 6 (videotape was stopped.) 7 mr. smith: and every one of them said it. you 8 heard it. no. after all the documents going back 9 at least to 1959, they still could not tell the truth 10 to the american public about the addiction to their 11 product. 12 and you know we know -- we know that the tirc 13 was a public relations gesture -- 14 215, please. 15 we know that the tirc was a public relations 16 gesture because, well, this strictly private and 17 confidential document -- 18 go to the next page, please. 19 "the tirc cannot, in my opinion, provide the 20 vehicle for such research. it was conceived as a 21 public relations gesture, however undefiled the 22 scientific advisory board and its grants may be." 23 this is a year before the '64 surgeon general's 24 report. 25 "it has functioned as a public relations 1 operation. however -- moreover, its organization, 2 certainly in its present form, does not allow the 3 breadth of research -- cancer, emphysema, et 4 cetera -- essential to the protection of" -- not the 5 american public -- "the tobacco industry." 6 go to the next section, please. 7 next section, please. 8 and then -- back. right there. 9 and then they say, you know, good things, bad 10 things. there is a problem. moreover, nicotine is 11 addictive. then they say, then there are some side 12 problems, and i think they have certain unattractive 13 side effects. they may true -- well be truly 14 causative in emphysema, et cetera. 15 what they know, they knew it in 1963, before 16 the first surgeon general's report. they knew it 17 may truly well be a cause of emphysema. 18 in 1984 the surgeon general issued a copd 19 surgeon general's report. it said absolutely copd 20 was caused by smoking. and what did the industry 21 say? well, their -- their president got on and 22 said, and the industry said through their documents, 23 which we had dr. stueck read -- we had dr. stueck 24 read it, and he said it is misleading when they said 25 that copd had not yet been confirmed. it had long 1 been confirmed, but they continued to deny it. 2 the only time they did not want to deny the link 3 would be, well, now, when they want to say, we were 4 denying it in the '80s, but mr. alexander should 5 have known. 6 we know that they targeted kids. 7 go to 474, please. top of the page, please. 8 we know they targeted children. we know that 9 they let -- that they -- 10 518, please. 11 1975. "our paramount objective in '75 is to 12 reestablish our share of the marketing growth." you 13 saw the documents when they were worried about 14 marlboro taking their share of the 14-to-20-year-old 15 market. that was in '75, '76 and '77. we know that 16 they let their legal department override their 17 scientists. 18 611, please. 19 you remember this. doctor -- they wanted to do 20 research. legal said, no, we cannot do research. we 21 asked what is mutagenicity? mutagenicity's the study 22 of cancer. 23 go to 612, please. 24 so the doctor, he -- he, frankly, wanted to do 25 the research. what happened? "in accordance with 1 legal's wishes -- wishes and reasons, permission to 2 examine the mutagenicity of smoke condensate 3 fractions and denicotinized tobacco smoke condensate 4 is refused." 5 legal ran the research department. 6 go to 1322, please. 7 and this is my favorite. this is their -- 8 their in-house counsel writing to their general 9 counsel about their new head of research. now, you 10 remember they said, but we did the mutagenicity 11 studies. 12 well, wait a second. in 1982 dr. demarco had a 13 meeting with the in-house counsel, who is writing his 14 boss, the general counsel, mr. witt. 15 drop down, please. 16 "during his law department orientation he said 17 that he thinks it is essential for r&d to work on the 18 development of a less mutagenic cigarette." 19 but they come back and they say, we cannot do 20 that, because that would mean we were admitting -- 21 by saying that we were working on a less mutagenic, 22 we would be admitting that there was a mutagen, and we 23 cannot do that. 24 "he seemed to" -- "he seemed to understand our 25 concern, but refused it -- to accept it as a 1 rationale for not doing what he felt we had an 2 obligation to do as a responsible manufacturer." 3 next section, please. 4 "during his orientation he stated he wanted to 5 spend more time talking to us about the 6 state of the art on cancer. he said that in his 7 view the state of the art has developed over the 8 past 20 years to the point where he thought our 9 legal defense was or near perilously close to 10 obsolete." 11 that means that he knew as early as -- 12 certainly since '62, but by '82 they knew that their 13 position on the harmfulness of their cigarettes was 14 obsolete. 15 but did it change? no. 16 next section, please. 17 and then my favorite. and i want you to 18 remember this as tobacco talks about experts they have 19 presented again. 20 "he also said, though i cannot recall exact 21 words, that our medical scientific witnesses will 22 say whatever we want them to say, clearly implying, 23 if not stating, that they lack credibility and 24 integrity." 25 that is one lawyer to another lawyer in a memo 1 they thought we would never see. 2 we know that they also targeted african 3 american smokers. we know that they targeted them 4 for menthol cigarettes. we know they targeted them 5 for menthol cigarettes in the following way. 6 599, please. go to the highlighted section, 7 please. 8 salem was in competition with kool. and what 9 were they in competition for? they were about the 10 menthol brand. 11 next highlight, please. 12 black market, market importance. "the black 13 market comprises 9.6 percent of total volume." they 14 were talking about targeting the black market. 15 go to the next section, please. 16 they are talking about salem and kool fighting 17 for market share. 18 next section, please. 19 and then they were talking -- 20 go on to the next section, please. 21 and how did that battle go forward? 22 644, please. 23 video tech operator: there is no 644. 24 mr. smith: i'm sorry. 1349, please. 25 the black menthol cigarette market. "kool's 1 success in the black market started in the mid-'60s, 2 was responsible for the brand, eventually catching 3 up with then passing salem in volume share in 1972." 4 you heard the testimony. menthol cigarettes 5 were aimed at black smokers. they marketed to black 6 smokers who did not read well. they did it by going 7 into grocery stores, gas stations, liquor stores. 8 go to the next section, please. 9 that is where they saw the growth. "of 10 particular significance is the fact that salem's 11 black market growth between '76 and '78 came largely 12 from its lights spin-off." 13 next section, please. 14 next section, please. 15 they identified the market they were after, 16 functionally illiterate african americans. 17 next section, please. 18 they function -- they said, we know that they 19 buy in small groceries, service stations, liquor 20 stores and vending machines, and they devised a 21 strategy -- next section, please -- to go after that 22 market, and they said, we know menthol cigarettes 23 are more popular with blacks than the general 24 smoking public. 25 next section, please. 1 more than a fifth of all -- of all black 2 adults, fifty percent of black smokers, smoke menthol 3 cigarettes. 4 next section, please. 5 and why did they -- did they sell black -- and 6 what was part of their message? "before the 7 introduction of lights, black menthol smokers to a 8 greater degree than their white counterparts 9 believed menthol cigarettes were less hazardous, 10 irritating, than other cigarettes." 11 as a matter of fact, that is why they thought 12 they were doing so well. and they marketed to them, 13 and guess what? j.p. alexander switched in the mid- 14 to late '60s to what? menthol cigarettes. he 15 continued to smoke menthol cigarettes during the 16 entire period in which they targeted people who 17 absolutely met his demographic. 18 and they targeted them knowing that part of the 19 belief was that they assumed that they were less 20 hazardous or irritating. but, in fact, the real 21 effect was, as we know -- and this we have heard from 22 the evidence -- that they caused significant health 23 problems. 24 you know, very quickly, i'd like to go to 697. 25 this is one of my favorite documents. i hope you will 1 remember it. 2 next section, please. 3 this is a -- one of the tobacco institute 4 people talking to another guy in the tobacco 5 institute, and he realized he missed a meeting where 6 they started talking about how addictive -- the 7 addictive nature of their product. and he said, 8 "but i do not think the questions i now raise are 9 academic." shook hardy. that was the law firm 10 representing tobacco in those days. "i am told that 11 the entire matter of addiction is the most potent 12 weapon of a prosecuting -- a prosecuting attorney 13 can have in a lung cancer cigarette case. we cannot 14 defend smoking as free choice if the person was 15 addicted." 16 that is what is the tobacco institute was saying 17 to the tobacco institute. but today they will stand 18 here, a challenge. they will stand here today and 19 say, it is free choice, free will -- 20 mr. kaczynski: objection, your honor. 21 mr. smith: -- addiction does not matter. 22 mr. kaczynski: may we approach? 23 (a sidebar conference was held outside the 24 hearing of the jury as follows:) 25 mr. kaczynski: your honor, i object to any 1 inference, and it was more than an inference, to my 2 client's defense of these cases as part of something 3 continuing toward us saying it is free choice at this 4 point. my argument is that this is just a 5 continuation of what those documents show. it is 6 improper. 7 mr. smith: i do not think it is improper. 8 mr. kaczynski: it is grossly improper. and i'm 9 not moving for a mistrial now, but if it continues i 10 will. 11 mr. smith: it is not improper. all i'm 12 saying -- 13 the court: i understand your contention is 14 it is improper because of what? 15 mr. kaczynski: because what he is saying that 16 in defense of this case it was mr. alexander's 17 choice to smoke is part and parcel of some 18 conspiracy that takes them back into these documents 19 that the defense of this case is somehow tortious. 20 mr. smith: i disagree with that. 21 the court: defense of the case is somehow 22 tortious? 23 mr. smith: i have not charged that, but i have 24 said that is what they knew back then and that is 25 what they will say now, even now. 1 mr. kaczynski: then i rest my case. 2 mr. smith: it is not inappropriate. 3 the court: i do not think it is inappropriate, 4 mr. kaczynski. 5 mr. kaczynski: okay, your honor. 6 (the sidebar conference was concluded, and the 7 following proceedings were held:) 8 the court: mr. smith, you have consumed 40 9 minutes. i do not know if you want -- 10 mr. smith: i've got five more minutes of my 11 part, and then i'll be turning it over to my 12 partner. 13 i want to go to -- well, i'm going to leave out 14 the verdict form part, because time passes so fast. 15 you know, i want to tell you that perhaps the 16 best measure of how truthful r.j. reynolds has been 17 with the american people -- now, we know this. we 18 know that -- anne browder got on and said, we do not 19 pay for movie placement. you saw the contracts 20 for -- we just picked one, sylvester stallone. we 21 know that they came off of television in 1971 22 because they did not like the access problem they had 23 because of the fairness doctrine. we know that they 24 doubled their advertising and promotion budget after 25 they went on television, that they became the 1 greatest point of purchaser -- marketer in the 2 history of the world. we know that. 3 we know, and it is uncontroverted, that, 4 actually, it even affected john paul alexander in 5 one way. do you remember mr. carnegie saying, you 6 know, i do remember something. they used to bring 7 these posters by. and i put a poster up and this 8 guy had this hat and he had this cigarette, and i 9 used to say, that is why you smoke, because you look 10 like that guy, and he thought that guy looked cool. 11 remember that? that is the testimony of 12 mr. carnegie. that is what happened everywhere. you 13 do not have to read well to see an image and for that 14 image to work with you. 15 go to 8- -- 688, please. 16 we know under 688 in 1980 the then president, 17 mr. horrigan, was getting a memo. he was real 18 worried because they were losing their market share 19 of those critical 14-to-17-year-olds. marlboro man 20 was beating them. 21 but when he was asked on television, on 22 nightline -- 23 820, please. 24 when he was asked about whether or not they 25 supported cigarette smoking by minors, this is what 1 he says: 2 (videotape was played:) 3 ted koppel: "joining us live now from station 4 wfmy in winston-salem, north carolina, is edward 5 horrigan, jr., chairman of the board of the 6 r.j. reynolds tobacco company. 7 "cigarette smoking does not cause cancer, yes 8 or no?" 9 mr. horrigan: "it is not known whether 10 cigarettes cause cancer." 11 ted koppel: "all right, sir." 12 mr. horrigan: "it has not been causally 13 established." 14 ted koppel: "cigarette smoking -- no causal 15 relationship between cigarette smoking and 16 emphysema?" 17 mr. horrigan: "despite all of the research to 18 date, there has been no causal link established." 19 ted koppel: "well, i admire your honesty for 20 telling me that you do not smoke, but what i'm 21 asking, though, i guess, is let us give your 22 position the benefit of the doubt for a moment and 23 say that there is still some doubt. and i must say 24 that successive surgeons general for the past 25 20 years would disagree with that, but let us do 1 that. if there is doubt, should we not be leading 2 our children in the direction of not smoking?" 3 mr. horrigan: "yes. in fact, as far as we -- 4 when i say yes, the cigarette industry's position is 5 that young people should not smoke. and" -- 6 (videotape was stopped.) 7 mr. smith: stop. 8 but they were worried about that 9 14-to-17-year-old market share they were losing. 10 that is how honest they have been with the american 11 people. 12 and by the way, did you hear him say in 1984 on 13 national tv it is not been linked to emphysema? but 14 they charge that this man should have known in the 15 1980s. 16 ladies and gentlemen, my time runs short. i'm 17 going to turn this over to my partner. but i want 18 you to remember this, that they have spent 50 years 19 lying about addiction, lying about the hazardousness 20 of smoking, lying about every disease. 21 they have opposed every surgeon general's report, 22 every one. you have heard them. you watched them. 23 every time the ftc would come out with a report, 24 including a report that said -- and remember the ftc 25 report. that is document 758. how many tens of 1 millions of people in the '80s still did not know how 2 dangerous cigarette smoking was? how many tens of 3 millions of people into the '80s did not understand 4 that chronic bronchitis and emphysema were caused 5 almost exclusively by cigarette smoking? and 34 to 6 39 percent of the people had no idea that they would 7 cause any cases of chronic bronchitis or emphysema. 8 ladies and gentlemen, this is a conspiracy. it 9 was done intentionally. they had the knowledge. 10 they could have done other things. they could have 11 made a safer product, but it would not give them the 12 profit they wanted. they could have stopped the 13 production and come up with something that would 14 have worked for them, but it would have cost them 15 profit. 16 they could have told the truth to the american 17 people, but it would have cost them profit. so they 18 lied. 19 and this man was in that class of people that 20 was hurt because of what they did, the way they 21 created the cigarette, how they marketed the 22 cigarette, how they pushed their cigarette, and what 23 it did to him in a horrible death that he suffered. 24 my partner will talk about the damages that 25 have been suffered in this case. 1 thank you, your honor. 2 mr. avera: earline alexander was born in the 3 beginning of the great depression. she is 82 years 4 old today. she has no education. she has never 5 seen the inside of a classroom her entire life and 6 has never seen the inside of a courthouse, much less 7 a courtroom, since stepping into this building last 8 week. she is worked her entire life. she has very 9 little but her worth and her integrity. 10 she has not lied to american families about the 11 dangers of smoking. she has not, on the one hand, 12 spent hundreds of millions of dollars marketing and 13 advertising to american families to smoke a 14 cigarette the tobacco industry knew would kill its 15 customers, all at the same time they were whispering 16 out the other side of their mouth, just keep 17 smoking. just keep smoking, folks. if there is 18 anything harmful in it, we will take it out. trust us 19 on that. we will take it out. 20 she has not smeared or belittled reputable 21 scientists and medical doctors in their field of 22 specialty whose only endeavor was to seek out the 23 truth and the relationship between smoking and 24 diseases, emphysema, copd, lung cancer, many others. 25 she has never sought to create a controversy 1 where really none existed. she has only tried to do 2 what is right in her life, work hard, pay her bills, 3 doing what is right, knowing the difference between 4 right and wrong. 5 doing what is right is a claim that 6 r.j. reynolds corporation will never be able to 7 utter, think or place on a piece of paper because of 8 its conduct during the last half of the 20th 9 century. 10 earline alexander has only worked hard and was 11 there to be the caring wife for paul alexander 12 during those last three years when he so desperately 13 needed comfort and attention, when copd slowly 14 robbed him of his breath and took his life, during 15 those three years when he needed her for better or 16 for worse, the words have meant something to earline 17 alexander. 18 paul alexander was simply a customer of 19 r.j. reynolds. he was taken from earline by copd, a 20 horrible disease, practically unheard of at the 21 beginning of the 20th century, a disease which 22 r.j. reynolds denied was the cause -- was caused by 23 cigarette smoking until the end of the 20th century, 24 notwithstanding everything mr. smith just showed you 25 on that board. 1 she watched her husband recover from a stroke 2 in 1996 and slowly over time decline, dying from a 3 disease that neither of them had ever heard of 4 before 1996 and had certainly never heard of in the 5 1980s. 6 what should move us to action in matters like 7 this is human dignity. we, as a society, ladies and 8 gentlemen, lose dignity if we are willing to 9 tolerate the intolerable. 10 manufacturing a nicotine delivery system in an 11 unreasonable, dangerous and defective manner and 12 giving it to american families, to adolescents, and 13 denying that there is any relationship between that 14 product and diseases that rob those customers, those 15 victims, of their dignity is evil and morally 16 corrupt. 17 mrs. alexander was there when john paul 18 alexander took sick in 1996. when he slowly could 19 not breathe, she was there for him when she would 20 come home from work. other family was there when 21 she was not. she gave him her best to give him 22 comfort when he could not breathe. 23 during his last months she cleaned him when he 24 soiled himself, he could not toilet himself; fed him 25 when he could not feed himself; and watched his 1 ability to breathe ebb slowly away. 2 paul was one, just one, of almost half a 3 million -- half a million -- try to get that out -- 4 half a million americans each year that die from 5 smoking-related diseases. 6 smoking-related diseases are the number-one -- 7 is the number-one killer of americans today and has 8 been for decades. 9 paul is gone. earline is left. she is never 10 really asked much -- for much in her life. maybe 11 there has not been much justice in a life that 12 does not have an education. but hopefully, 13 hopefully, mrs. alexander will learn a lesson during 14 these two weeks, and that lesson is, is that a jury 15 will come together, citizens from her community, and 16 decide the conduct that cannot be tolerated, will 17 not be tolerated, in this community. 18 she will learn that a jury will come together 19 and hear the evidence and decide that they will not 20 tolerate an industry that makes a product such as 21 the one that r.j. reynolds makes, bring experts to 22 trial and look you in the eye and deny the obvious. 23 and she will watch you measure her loss. and 24 how should you do that? our system, ladies and 25 gentlemen, can only allow for money damages. we 1 abandoned an eye for an eye a long, long time ago. 2 one measure may be what r.j. reynolds is 3 willing to pay an expert witness, 4-, $500 an hour, 4 not an atypical amount. there were other experts in 5 this case for the plaintiff as well who were paid 6 that much or more. but experts that looked you in 7 the eye and said such things as, i do not really know 8 what you mean when you use the phrase "heavy 9 smoker." i do not agree with the statistics in the 10 dsm, the same manual that i'm using to determine 11 that john paul alexander was not addicted. 12 experts who would look you in the eye and tell 13 you that their own employer was wrong about the 14 addictive qualities of nicotine. an expert that 15 would disagree with the surgeon general, c. everett 16 koop, of the united states; disagree with his own 17 employer, jane proffer at brown university; disagree 18 with the university of south florida, its training 19 materials that are used to train children about 20 tobacco prevention; look you in the eye and tell you 21 that just because somebody smokes two to three packs 22 a day does not mean they are a chain smoker, it is 23 going to take something more than that, four or five 24 packs a day, and even then somebody who smokes four 25 or five packs a day is not necessarily addicted to 1 nicotine. 2 a measure could be the price we place on 3 inanimate objects. might be very simple to hear 4 experts testify about the value of a painting or of 5 a gem. one expert says it is worth this many million 6 dollars; another expert says, no, it is this many 7 million dollars. but that is an inanimate object. 8 a measure might be the millions we will pay to a 9 professional athlete whose really only skill is to 10 be able to bounce, hit or dribble a ball, and, yet, 11 we are willing to pay them millions of dollars a year 12 to do that. 13 a measure may be the hundreds of millions that 14 r.j. reynolds and the tobacco industry spent over 15 the years to market to american families and to 16 advertise, all the while whispering to them, just 17 keep smoking. if there is anything bad in it, we will 18 take it out for you. 19 ladies and gentlemen, in measuring those 20 damages, it is only -- for whatever reason, we, as a 21 society, do not blink at the values of those 22 inanimate objects and we do not blink at the values 23 of professional athletes who make millions of 24 dollars in one year, and we do not blink at the 25 hundreds of millions that a corporation like 1 r.j. reynolds makes while marketing and advertising 2 something that was not the truth. but we throw our 3 hands up in shock and surprise when we suggest that 4 what earline alexander saw in those last three years 5 of her husband's life is worth a couple million 6 dollars. 7 human suffering has value, and all we can do in 8 this case is to apply money damages. compensatory 9 damages are to fix those things that can be fixed, 10 pay for harm that is been caused, make up for those 11 things that cannot be fixed. and 50 years of lies 12 cannot be fixed. losing paul cannot be fixed. 13 mr. kaczynski told you something in his opening 14 statement, that this case was about really one 15 thing, and that was giving mrs. alexander money. 16 true compensatory damages, her suffering and 17 watching her husband go through what he went through 18 and her being there with him are a significant part 19 of this case. but as the evidence was laid out 20 before you over the last two weeks and you saw that 21 which almost all americans have not seen, it may 22 have occurred to some of you that it was more about 23 their money, the money they were going to make over 24 50 years by not being honest with american families, 25 by creating controversy where there was none, by 1 whispering to american families and adolescents, 2 just keep smoking. just keep smoking. and if 3 there is something bad in it, we will take it out. 4 i know that r.j. reynolds wants to decide this 5 case on choices. i'm going to talk to you for just 6 a couple of minutes about choices. i want to get to 7 the choices part of the verdict form. 8 this is the verdict form which you will see and 9 these are the questions. before i talk about fault 10 and choices, i want to catch us up on the verdict 11 form. 12 the first question has to do with addiction. 13 and this is the question that determines whether 14 mr. alexander is a member of the engle class or not. 15 folks, everybody, you will recall, was agreeable 16 and we all started out even on that scale and 17 whoever tipped the scales in their favor would 18 prevail. and everybody agreed that was acceptable, 19 and everyone agreed that they did not require any 20 greater burden of proof than that. this one. 21 that is our burden. we take that. 22 mr. smith has gone through the evidence 23 somewhat. you were here. you listened to the 24 defendant's expert, dr. myers. you listened to the 25 plaintiff's expert, dr. werner. i'm just going to 1 ask you folks to apply your common sense in what you 2 heard from those two experts, because you, as the 3 trier of facts, are free to believe or disbelieve 4 anything an expert tells you. 5 i'm going to submit to you we are going to tip 6 those scales. i'm going to submit to you after the 7 cross-examination of dr. myers was done we had 8 slammed those scales up in our favor on the issue of 9 addiction. you should answer yes, because i suggest 10 it requires that, on question number 1. 11 mr. smith has gone over the causation issues, 12 and these, 2, 3, 4, 5, they all have to do with john 13 paul alexander doing exactly what the tobacco 14 industry wanted him to do during the decades that he 15 smoked. 16 they wanted him to smoke. they did not want him 17 to quit. they wanted him to keep going to those 18 stores and buying those cigarettes over all those 19 decades, all the while whispering, by creating that 20 controversy, now, folks, there is no direct 21 relationship here. there is no proof here. just 22 keep smoking them. we will take it out, the bad 23 stuff, if we ever find out what it is. 24 on 2, 3, those questions should be answered 25 yes. 1 4, was r.j. reynolds tobacco company's 2 concealment or omission of material information 3 about the health effects or addictive nature of 4 smoking cigarettes or both a legal cause of john 5 paul alexander's death? the answer to that question 6 must be yes. 7 you have seen the evidence for yourselves. many 8 of you may have come to this courthouse questioning 9 whether the tobacco companies had really been 10 completely up front with the american public over 11 all those decades. but now you know more. now you 12 know more than the folks who have not sat through 13 the evidence in a case such as this and have heard 14 what they did from the 1950s until the end of the 15 century. 16 number 5, was r.j. reynolds tobacco company's 17 agreement with others to conceal or omit information 18 regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their 19 addictive nature a legal cause of john paul 20 alexander's death? the answer to that question, 21 ladies and gentlemen, in weighing those scales, is 22 clearly yes. 23 how could it not be? you have just seen the 24 internal documents where they absolutely refuse to 25 admit that which they should have been admitting to 1 american families. 2 no one from the tobacco industry, and certainly 3 not from r.j. reynolds, ever stepped up and said, 4 folks, we want you to use our product, but there are 5 a couple things you have got to know. first, i want 6 you to know they are addictive. they are addictive. 7 we have known they were addictive from the 1950s. we 8 want you to know that. two, they can kill you. 9 but, no. they created controversy. they 10 belittled and besmirched respected scientists who 11 were only seeking the truth. and they found it and 12 had found it by the late 1950s. as dr. proctor told 13 you, there was no longer any controversy. 14 6, mr. smith has addressed that question. i'm 15 not going to rehash that. but 6 is the statute of 16 limitations defense. that one should be answered 17 no. you cannot find from this evidence that john 18 paul alexander knew or should have known before 19 may 5, 1990, that he had chronic obstructive 20 pulmonary disease and that there was a reasonable 21 possibility that his smoking caused copd when -- 22 when he had never heard of the disease, when he would 23 never heard of emphysema, and it was at the same 24 time that the tobacco industry was telling americans 25 that there was no correlation, no proof that smoking 1 caused copd. 2 that argument should shock the conscience, that 3 at the same time they expected a gentleman who went 4 to school in the segregated schools of union county 5 in the 1930s, perhaps through the fifth grade, 6 probably could not read, but if he could, very 7 little, should have known that which r.j. reynolds 8 was denying in may of 1990. 9 that is a no. if it is yes, the case is over. 10 earline leaves this courtroom. answering yes would 11 not be justice. 12 number 7, that is going to be a question you 13 folks will debate. the total has to be a hundred 14 percent. that has to do with choices that i told 15 you that i was going to talk about. 16 it has always been argument that it is the 17 plaintiff's choice to smoke. it is not really a free 18 choice when a child in the 1930s, late 1930s, early 19 1940s, decided to smoke. that was the culture then. 20 most people, most adults, by far, did smoke during 21 that period of time. there is no information there 22 for a child to make that judgment. 23 over subsequent decades r.j. reynolds will tell 24 you that it was mr. alexander's decision to continue 25 to smoke during those same decades when they denied 1 that nicotine was addictive. 2 no one on behalf of the plaintiff has ever 3 looked any of you folks in the eye and said that 4 mr. paul alexander had absolutely no control over 5 his behavior. it would not make any common sense to 6 say that. he did. at the same time that dr. myers 7 was telling you that he had complete control of his 8 smoking behavior, the very next thing that was on 9 that screen was the surgeon general's statement that 10 we know that addictive drugs, including nicotine, 11 they do affect one's control. 12 that is what happened in paul alexander's case 13 and in millions of other americans' cases. when 14 they tell you the statistic 55 percent of 15 americans -- 45 percent of americans quit long-term, 16 that means that 55 percent are never able to quit 17 after repeated quit attempts, and those that do quit 18 long-term, typically six to seven quit attempts, 19 many of them using help, patches, gum and the like. 20 the easiest way to address fault here, ladies 21 and gentlemen, is what is the information that the 22 two sides had available to them? did r.j. reynolds 23 have five times more information than paul alexander 24 about cigarettes, about nicotine addiction? did 25 they have ten times more information, 50 times more 1 information? and did r.j. reynolds not tell the 2 truth to american families about all those issues? 3 the tobacco industry and r.j. reynolds are very 4 uncomfortable with having to deal with their 5 choices. they would like it to be completely the 6 smoker's choice. and you will have to consider 7 those choices by paul alexander. 8 when an 82-year-old woman comes into court 9 courageously and says, folks, using my common sense, 10 i'm going to tell you that my husband shared some of 11 the fault here, but only partially, then it is time 12 for the folks that made their choices in the 13 corporate board rooms to step up and take 14 responsibility, as well. 15 i'm going to suggest to you that because paul 16 alexander's choices came about as a result of human 17 frailty, his decision to smoke, his inability to 18 stop, no quit attempts until there at the very end, 19 that is human frailty, ladies and gentlemen. 20 their decisions? you just saw the documents. 21 they did not care about american families. they 22 cared about the tobacco industry. that is avarice. 23 that is greed. that is evil. that is a completely 24 different kind of choice. and for making those 25 choices, you should place eighty percent of the 1 responsibility with r.j. reynolds. they had at 2 least four times the amount of information that john 3 paul alexander did. 4 place a challenge to the company, because they 5 will step up and they will say this is a hundred 6 percent mr. alexander's fault. they will not 7 acknowledge one percent of fault. they will place a 8 hundred percent of the fault in the lap of earline 9 alexander and at the foot of the grave of paul 10 alexander and take no responsibility for their 11 choices and their decisions. 12 as to damages, ladies and gentlemen, 13 mrs. alexander's life has been rich in some ways and 14 not in others. you cannot bring paul back. we know 15 that. this is one of those things where there is 16 been a harm and they must pay for the harms that 17 they have caused. there is nothing that the money 18 damages will fix. 19 you are to be guided by your own life 20 experiences in what is fair and just in light of the 21 evidence and what rings true with respect to your 22 common sense. 23 i'm going to suggest to you the sum of 24 $2 million in past pain and suffering suffered by 25 earline alexander and $1 million in future, for a 1 total of $3 million. you are, of course, free to 2 award more or less based on your evaluation, your 3 life experience, your common sense and what is fair 4 and just. 5 if you answer questions -- either question 4 or 6 5 yes, then you answer question 9: under the 7 circumstances of this case, state whether punitive 8 damages are warranted against r.j. reynolds tobacco 9 company. 10 his honor, judge hulslander, read to you the 11 instructions. the standard here, as you know, is a 12 little bit higher than the compensatory damages. it 13 is clear and convincing evidence. 14 what must you find to award punitive damages in 15 these circumstances? let us find out. 16 one, the conduct causing damage to 17 mr. alexander was so grossly flagrant as to show a 18 reckless disregard for human life or the safety of 19 persons exposed to the effects of such conduct. 20 can anyone seriously argue that what they did 21 over five decades was not in reckless disregard of 22 human life? 23 two, the conduct showed an entire lack of care, 24 that r.j. reynolds must have been consciously 25 indifferent to the consequences. 1 folks, just so we are clear, if we are not 2 already, during the entire time that they are 3 whispering out the side of their mouth, folks, 4 just keep smoking, and creating controversy, and 5 attacking scientists and calling the american cancer 6 society and the federal government, accusing them of 7 misleading the american public, they knew. they 8 knew they were killing americans with their product. 9 this has been a corporate conspiracy unheard of 10 in american history, and hopefully it will never 11 have been heard of again. and now accountability is 12 being sought out in rooms such as this. this is 13 where folks like you get to say enough is enough. 14 this is where you, ladies and gentlemen, can find 15 that punitive damages are warranted. 16 4, the conduct showed such reckless 17 indifference to the rights of others as to be 18 equivalent to an intentional violation of these 19 rights. 20 folks, to say that what this corporation did 21 was permissible, was okay, would be to condone their 22 conduct. and punitive damages are to punish them 23 but also to deter others who may be inclined to act 24 similarly. 25 the evidence, not just by clear and convincing 1 evidence, but beyond and to the exclusion of all 2 reasonable doubt, that criminal law standard, the 3 highest we have, clearly shows that punitive damages 4 are warranted against r.j. reynolds. saying 5 anything other than that would be to condone their 6 conduct. 7 and we know this in our society. we know we 8 want there to be more accountability, number two -- 9 number one, and number two, that if folks do what 10 they did and there is no accountability, there is no 11 incentive for them to stop it. 12 do the right thing. confirm that in our 13 society this conduct will not be tolerated. show 14 earline alexander that by her life of working hard 15 that even she can come into this courtroom and be on 16 evil -- even footing with a corporation. tell them 17 they did not do the right thing. tell them they 18 did not know right from wrong, or, if they did, they 19 intentionally harmed american families. tell them 20 by your verdict enough is enough. 21 thank you. 16 mr. smith: thank you. 17 i think sometimes the best response to 18 everything is pretty quick anyway, so i'm going to 19 be pretty quick about this. 20 number one, they have the burden of proof on 21 the statute of limitations and they have not 22 proven the smoking gun. not once in a lifetime 23 did anybody, all the people they talked to, ever 24 say -- hear him say, i do not feel well, i'm sick, 25 i cannot do my work. they did not produce a day he 1 ever missed work. 2 now, what they did produce is a 1989 that he 3 quit working for the gas station. actually by 4 then he was driving, if you remember, he was 5 actually driving a wrecker truck the last year 6 that he got social security. he did not get social 7 security when he was working for cash. 8 their own expert acknowledged, he showed them, 9 entrepreneurial ambition. we have three, if not 10 four eye witnesses to him working on cars in the 11 1990s. that is the end of that issue. 12 they recognize, their own person, that with 13 that kind of physical exertion he could not do if 14 he was suffering from copd. he had no idea what 15 copd was. 16 and then they go to mrs. alexander and they 17 say, well, she said that he got emphysema. 18 mrs. alexander said she learned that at the 19 doctor's office. her daughter told you that she 20 never went to the doctor's office except with him 21 when he went after he had his stroke. 22 now, mrs. alexander is 82, almost 83 years 23 old. and you have seen the instruction on memory. 24 mrs. alexander did not remember her birthday. 25 mrs. alexander does get confused. she has not had 1 an easy life. that does not mean she is not 2 entitled to justice. 3 and the fact that after three days and 500 4 pages of depositions they got her confused in 5 select passages. you be the judge of that. 6 please go to 883, please. this ought to say 7 it all. 8 they say we told the truth. this is what they 9 said in the '80s. 10 (plaintiff's exhibit 883, video played for the 11 jury.) 12 mr. smith: he was wrong. and a half a 13 million people a year are dead. now, this is not 14 any evidence that either side did not know about. 15 this is what was being said during the life, this 16 was the position of the tobacco company's. 17 you know, go to 941, please. 18 i like what dr. kyriakoudes said and i hope 19 you will abide by it. you do not have to believe 20 this. believe their documents. 21 go to the first highlighted section, please. 22 1964. chronic bronchitis, what do they do? 23 they deny it. 24 go to the next section. 25 they say everybody knew. this is 1989. 1 despite the growing level of public knowledge, a 2 substantial number of americans are still 3 uninformed about and do not believe the health 4 risks of smoking. these gaps in knowledge or 5 beliefs are more evident when one considers the 6 proportion of adults who do not acknowledge 7 certain health risks rather than the portion who 8 do. 9 go to the next section, please. 10 although empirical evidence is sparse, tobacco 11 industry activities in the form of advertising and 12 promotion, public relations and lobbying may 13 interfere with public beliefs and personalized 14 acceptance of the health risks of smoking. 15 next section, please. 16 and what do we know? african americans 17 particularly were slow to respond to the drop in 18 smoking. 19 next section, please. go down and what does 20 this show? 21 right here. the least educated were 12 times 22 more likely to be reticent in stopping smoking. 23 and why? because they were more exposed to 24 advertising and less exposed to the ability to get 25 better information. and they say, well, he is 1 never shown that he relied on a single ad. you 2 heard mr. carnegie say we used to joke about the 3 ad that he taught me how to put up. there were 4 lots of them. i put them up, and one of them he 5 talked about how it impressed him. 6 go to 248 please. 248. 7 this is it. this is what the whole case is 8 really about. 1964. they are really glad. you 9 know why? the propaganda blast was tremendous and 10 the penetration was widespread. but i have the 11 feeling that the public reaction was not as severe 12 nor did it have the emotional depth i might have 13 feared. 14 go down to the bottom, please. 15 and this is what it was all about for them in 16 1964 and every day after that. we must in the 17 near future provide some answers which will give 18 smokers a psychological crutch and a 19 self-rationale to continue smoking. 20 that is why we have the controversy and the 21 debate when their own experts say by the 1970s, 22 the 1980s, the science was settled, but not with 23 edward horrigan, president of r.j. reynolds, in 24 1984 when they started a new white paper campaign 25 about can we have an honest debate. 1 they have got a lot of nerve to come in here and 2 talk about who knew right from wrong. 3 they knew in '59 it was addictive. they knew 4 in the '80s it was addictive and they never agreed 5 with it. 6 you know, they say, well, he has not shown the 7 addiction. well, let us get it straight. we know 8 that he smoked for 60 years. we know he smoked 9 every day. we know he smoked literally, according 10 to napoleon filer, i never knew him to go an hour 11 without smoking. we know that about him. 12 we know he got up in the night. we know it 13 was the first thing in the morning. we know that 14 about him. and they want you to believe that he 15 smoked two, three, up to three-and-a-half packs a 16 day for 60 years and he was not nicotine 17 dependent. 18 well, let us say, okay, both experts have their 19 agenda, set them aside. it is their burden of 20 proof. go back to the doctors who treated him in 21 the hospital, both drs. toner and bellman, and 22 what did they say? he is nicotine dependent, and 23 you are common sense tells you that. 24 they say, well, that is not what led to his 25 injury. wait a minute. let us go back. you know, 1 they have wonderful scripts. i congratulate them 2 on this. as a matter of fact, when i say script, 3 i mean the word because when they brought in their 4 expert, dr. stueck, you realize literally it was 5 just a rescripting of things that i put on the 6 board that he had used before the last time they 7 had a historian. you remember that. 8 but their script up here with the chains and 9 all this. let me tell you about the chain. 10 addiction kept him smoking. and that is all i have 11 to do in this case is because smoking led to copd 12 and it killed him, and that is not in debate. 13 they say we did not tell you about the family. 14 well, we brought jeanette in. we brought 15 mrs. alexander before you and, you know, you are 16 right, she is not learned. she is easily confused. 17 she is had a tough life. but there is an awful lot 18 to be said in very few words when shy tried to 19 describe what she went through with her husband 20 there at the end. 21 i want you to remember that because that is 22 evidence of the kind of pain she feels and felt 23 for what she saw and what she watched. and there 24 are some evidence -- there is some evidence that is 25 been brought in, mostly through their own 1 depositions that they brought up. 2 they say, well, they did not tell us what kind 3 of father he was. well, i think they elicited he 4 kept a roof over his kids' head. they said, well, 5 they did not tell you about that. they brought 6 that up. 7 he went to school plays. they brought that 8 up. 9 he went to church programs. they brought that 10 up. 11 they brought up that what happened when he was 12 at home -- when you would get home late, 13 mrs. alexander? well, usually he was in there 14 playing with the kids. they brought that up. 15 mrs. alexander does not come in here asking you 16 for sympathy. she comes in here asking you for 17 justice because she sits without ever having gone 18 to school, with age advanced in this courtroom, 19 she sits with the same dignity in this system that 20 r.j. reynolds. 21 but i go back to what my partner said, when 22 you want to talk about comparative fault, i'll 23 tell you what to use as a measure. comparative 24 knowledge. go to that. who knew and who knew 25 when and who knew why? how long did they know it 1 was addictive? how long did they know it was 2 carcinogenic? 3 and they come back and have the nerve to say, 4 well, yeah, we tried to fix it. wait a minute. 5 remember the letter that we put in evidence when 6 the guy said do not we have a little horns of a 7 dilemma here? because we are saying at one point 8 that we are looking to get rid of the bad stuff but 9 on the other hand we are telling there is nothing 10 bad in it. 11 that was always their dilemma because they 12 could not say it was less mutagenic because then 13 they would have to admit that it is mutagenic. that is 14 the dilemma for them, so they never came clean. 15 they never told the truth. 16 and i do not know how much. nobody does. that 17 will be up to you. but i know this: you watched 18 and you heard about the description of what copd 19 does to someone. the description was you start 20 off like you have a snorkel and then you have a 21 straw and then someone's pinching the straw. 22 first you start walking less. then you cannot walk 23 at all. then you start talking less and then you 24 cannot talk at all. then you live on a hose 25 stretched to your nose and you try to stay at home 1 until they bring in hospice. that is the facts of 2 this case. 3 the court: you are out of time, mr. smith. 4 mr. smith: ladies and gentlemen, i thank you 5 on behalf of ms. alexander. i appreciate your 6 justice.
