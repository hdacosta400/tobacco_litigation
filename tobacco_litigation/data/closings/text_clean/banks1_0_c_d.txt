25 case. mr. furr: may it please the court? 2 ms. banks, katrina, counsel. 3 good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 4 boy, have i been anxious to get up and have 5 a chance to talk to you. but i've got to 6 start -- i'd like to jump in, but let me say one 7 or two things preliminary first. 8 first, we have got to thank you for your 9 service, and most importantly, i want to thank 10 you for your patience, because you sure have had 11 to be patient. this case should have taken 12 about three or four days to try; instead we have 13 spent almost two weeks here, and the reason is 14 you spent day after day listening to evidence 15 and witnesses that have nothing to do with the 16 issues that you are here to decide, as the 17 verdict form will demonstrate, once you actually 18 see what you are here to decide. 19 this morning you listened to an hour and a 20 half closing argument that was designed to make 21 you angry and to distract you from the issues 22 that you are actually here to decide, designed to 23 make you angry -- 24 mr. schlesinger: judge, i object. they 25 cannot derogate the plaintiff's case in this courtroom. 2 the court: overruled. 3 you can continue, sir. 4 mr. furr: -- designed to make you angry at 5 the tobacco companies so you will overlook the 6 plaintiff's complete inability to prove their 7 claims in this case. because this is a case 8 about george banks. it is not about generic 9 smokers. it is not about all smokers. it is not 10 about any other smoker. 11 so let us refocus on what the issues will be 12 here for you to decide, what the evidence is and 13 what the legal instructions are, so that you 14 have a roadmap. and i'm going to start with the 15 first question, not the eighteenth question. 16 i'm going to start in the beginning where you 17 all will have to start. 18 but let us remind ourselves, the case is 19 about mr. banks. the clearest, easiest way to 20 see it is about mr. banks is you are going to get 21 a verdict form that the court read to you and 22 that is going to be your verdict. you fill out 23 this form. i've highlighted them, you will see 24 this, there are 18 questions; 17 of them have 25 the name of george banks in the question. in several of those questions his name appears more 2 than once. this is a case about mr. banks. 3 it is a long verdict form, there are lots of 4 questions, but there are actually only a few 5 issues that just repeat themself throughout the 6 verdict form. so what i'm going to do is focus 7 on those issues and try to give you a roadmap as 8 to how those issues appear sequentially in 9 different parts of the verdict form. 10 but i want to be clear about something. 11 there has been a complete failure by the 12 plaintiffs to meet their burden of proof. they 13 have to prove their claims to you and they 14 have not been able to do it. 15 let us talk about what was done. 16 you all probably know what a red herring is. 17 a red herring, that is a figure of expression. a 18 red herring is something that is designed to 19 distract you and to mislead you away from the 20 real issues in the case and then take your eye 21 off the ball and get you looking somewhere else 22 as opposed to what you are supposed to be doing. 23 i submit, ladies and gentlemen, that what 24 was done during the last two weeks is the 25 plaintiffs have poured a barrel of red herrings in the courtroom that will not help you decide 2 the case about george banks. and i could talk 3 for a long time about it, but it is going to 4 distract us from what we are doing so i'm going 5 to try to do this briefly, because i think it is 6 important to understand a few things. because 7 the red herrings that the plaintiffs poured in 8 the courtroom really fall into three categories. 9 for each of those categories we need to take a 10 step back and look at, what was the actual 11 evidence on this issue and what did it have to 12 do with mr. banks, because your inquiry should 13 always come back to what does this evidence have 14 to do with mr. banks. that should be your 15 yardstick for every piece of evidence you look 16 at you say, what does this have to do with 17 mr. banks. 18 the red herrings go into three general 19 categories: addiction design, youth marketing 20 and generic evidence. 21 mr. schlesinger: objection, take that down 22 for a second. your honor, can i approach? 23 the court: yes, you can approach, sir. 24 (the following discussion was held at 25 sidebar:) the court: what is your objection? 2 mr. schlesinger: i object to them 3 denigrating the offense in this case. they are 4 so intensively arguing to your honor that we may 5 not run down the defense or attack the 6 defendants for defending the case. now they are 7 attacking the plaintiff for bringing the case. 8 and every one of those issues is instructed by 9 your honor. you let all that evidence in and 10 that is not argument, that is attacking the 11 plaintiff's case. and if they are going to say 12 we cannot attack them, then they cannot attack us. 13 the court: you can attack the evidence just 14 like they can attack the evidence. 15 mr. schlesinger: i agree, but that is not 16 what he is doing. he told the jury that we waste 17 the court's time, we took too long to do the 18 case and that our case is a red herring; that is 19 attacking the -- 20 mr. furr: i'll rephrase it from attacking. 21 the court: you will rephrase and you can 22 cover it in rebuttal. 23 (sidebar discussion was concluded, and the 24 following proceedings were held in open court:) 25 mr. furr: may i proceed, your honor? the court: you may, sir. 2 mr. furr: what i'm focusing on, ladies and 3 gentlemen, is the evidence before you and 4 whether it is helpful or not or whether it is a 5 red herring that causes you to take your eye off 6 the evidence that does help you decide the 7 issues in the case. 8 there are three general barrels these red 9 herrings fit into. 10 one is this idea of addiction design. i'll 11 tell you all what i mean by that in just a 12 minute. 13 second, youth marketing. 14 and third, this concept of using generic 15 evidence to prove mr. banks' case. we will look 16 at that and we will look at the facts real quickly 17 and then what it has to do with this case. 18 addiction design, what i mean by that is 19 you have heard over and over throughout the case 20 that tobacco companies do something to design 21 the cigarette to make it more addictive. 22 there is been suggestions that they use 23 additives to make it more addictive. there is 24 been suggestion that they have done something to 25 the nicotine to make it more inhalable and that makes it more addictive. and suggestions that 2 they have done something to make the nicotine pass 3 through the blood and get to the brain faster in 4 an attempt to make it more addictive. 5 let us look at what the evidence actually was 6 as opposed to the arguments that were made. and 7 we will use their own witnesses because their own 8 witnesses disprove all of these things. 9 you remember dr. proctor, the historian from 10 from california, and dr. difranza, the internal 11 medicine doctor from massachusetts. 12 first both of them told you that cigarettes 13 are dangerous and addictive by nature. tobacco 14 companies do not make them dangerous and 15 addictive. if you burn a leaf it has all the 16 same carcinogens in it as a cigarette does. it 17 has even more nicotine in it than ultimately the 18 cigarette does. that is the nature of the 19 product. 20 when you think about this claim that the 21 tobacco companies did something to make 22 cigarettes more addictive, if that were the case 23 then some cigarettes should be more addictive 24 than other cigarettes. common sense. 25 here's what dr. proctor admitted to you. filtered full-flavored, light low-tar and 2 additive-free cigarettes are equally addictive. 3 he told you that additive-free cigarettes are 4 equally addictive as cigarettes with additives. 5 it cannot be the additives that makes it 6 addictive. 7 this whole issue of inhalability -- excuse 8 me, roll-your-owns. you know, they keep reading 9 things to you saying today's cigarettes are more 10 addictive than ever were before, but listen to 11 what their own expert said. roll-your-own 12 cigarettes and cigarettes from the 1800s are 13 just as dangerous and addictive as manufactured 14 cigarettes, cigarettes from the 1800s. 15 if that is the case, which their own expert 16 admitted under cross-examination, then all these 17 theories about what is been done to make 18 cigarettes more addictive fall down. they have 19 had no effect. their own experts admit that. 20 they have also told you that cigarettes cannot 21 be made safe. this morning there was an 22 argument made to you about here's what the 23 tobacco companies should do: they should do x, 24 should do y, should do z to make their 25 cigarettes safe. dr. proctor told you they cannot be made safe and the only safe cigarette 2 is the one that is not lit. that is their own 3 expert. 4 what else did their experts tell you? 5 inhalability, throughout the case you have 6 heard that the tobacco companies did something 7 to make the smoke inhalable and that is what 8 caused cigarettes to be dangerous. well, that is 9 not what their expert said. their experts told 10 you that cigarettes have always been inhalable. 11 dr. proctor told you that back in the 1800s 12 people studying tobacco recognized that 13 cigarettes were more dangerous than other forms 14 of tobacco because they were inhalable, nature 15 of the product. 16 dr. difranza shot down both of their 17 theories about cigarette design and addiction. 18 he told you first that the inhalability of 19 cigarettes is not what causes them to be 20 addictive. and he explained to you that chewing 21 tobacco is addictive too. therefore, it is not 22 the inhalability. 23 dr. difranza also told you that the speed in 24 which nicotine is inhaled and goes to the brain 25 has nothing to do with making smoking addictive. and, again, he used the common-sense explanation 2 that chewing tobacco is addictive too. 3 their experts rejected both of those 4 theories. 5 let us turn to youth marketing. you have seen 6 this trial. you have seen plaintiffs attempt to 7 insert the word "kids" and "children" into this 8 case -- 9 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor. 10 mr. furr: -- over and over. 11 the court: overruled. 12 mr. furr: over and over. we objected and 13 it is been sustained. in fact -- 14 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor. 15 the court: do not comment on the evidence 16 that is been sustained, mr. furr. sustained. 17 mr. furr: let us look at what the court told 18 you. judge tuter told you on february 13th -- 19 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor. 20 mr. skwrao: ladies and gentlemen -- 21 mr. schlesinger: take that down. your 22 honor, your instruction -- 23 mr. furr: take it down. take it down. 24 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor. 25 that is not an appropriate use of the record. the court: what is the legal basis of your 2 objection, please, mr. schlesinger? 3 mr. schlesinger: it is not the jury 4 instruction. it is not argument. it is not 5 evidence. 6 the court: what was that, mr. furr? 7 mr. furr: the curative instruction you gave 8 the jury, a transcript slide of your 9 instruction, your honor. 10 the court: let me see it. 11 you can use it. overruled. 12 mr. furr: cliff, if counsel or anyone ask 13 you to take it down, do not wait for me to take 14 it down. as soon as an officer of the court 15 asks you to, okay? 16 video tech: okay. 17 mr. furr: all right, ladies and gentlemen. 18 you might recall judge tuter clearing things up 19 for us when he told you, "ladies and gentlemen, 20 this case is not about kids or children. it is 21 not about kids or children. it is about 22 mr. banks and the two defendants that they have 23 sued." 24 let us look at youth marketing a little 25 closer and why it is a red herring. first of all, there is zero evidence that mr. banks 2 started smoking because of advertising. who 3 told you that mr. banks started smoking because 4 of advertising? no one. no one. it is entirely 5 speculation. 6 second, the medical records, and 7 mr. schlesinger candidly admitted this in his 8 closing this morning, the medical records 9 indicated that mr. banks started smoking when he 10 was about 24 years old. now, their expert said 11 maybe it was a year or two before because he 12 might have had -- he might have started at a 13 lower amount of smoking before he got to a pack, 14 but the experts, even on cross-examination his 15 expert said, might have been a year or two 16 before. clearly an adult when he started. 17 there is zero credible evidence that 18 mr. banks started smoking as a youth. there is 19 just not any. 20 but i'm going to be comprehensive and we are 21 going to talk about the evidence they do have 22 and talk about what it means. you all might not 23 even remember this. but yesterday afternoon on 24 the cross-examination of dr. hoge at the 25 eleventh hour the plaintiffs asked dr. hoge: did not mrs. banks say that he started smoking as 2 a youth? now, she never told you that. she 3 did not testify about when he started. and 4 there is a good reason for that. because you 5 heard the redirect that mr. keehfus did of 6 dr. hoge and dr. hoge told you what mrs. banks 7 actually said in her sworn deposition testimony. 8 here's what she said. she was asked, "did 9 you ever ask him when he started smoking?" 10 and her answer was no. 11 "did you ever have any discussions about his 12 smoking before you two met? 13 "no. 14 "do you have any knowledge of when he 15 started smoking. 16 "no." 17 that was all that you heard from her 2012 18 sworn deposition testimony that she gave before 19 she got sick. and she is sick and we all feel 20 sorry for her and it may have affected her 21 memory. and nobody's criticizing her for that. 22 but that is why we keep bringing to you the 23 evidence from her deposition that she gave 24 before she got sick. that is why we spent so 25 much time showing you what she said when she was in better shape and her memory was in better 2 shape. 3 generic evidence. you know, you keep 4 hearing this theory, he was a generic smoker, he 5 was a generic smoker. he was not. he was an 6 individual whose biography whose personal story 7 are the facts you need to decide this case. 8 what kind of evidence was brought to you? 9 dr. proctor from california came. we had some 10 fun talking to him. it is obvious he and i have 11 talked about these issues before, but it is 12 important what he told you. remember, he is been 13 paid almost 2 million dollars to testify against 14 tobacco companies. and yet he came here and 15 provided to you only generic evidence. he 16 did not know when mr. banks started smoking, what 17 cigarettes he smoked. he did not even know what 18 disease -- he came here and said he did not know 19 what disease he had, but then i reminded him 20 that in fact he knew it was esophageal cancer -- 21 and that is important, we will get to that in a 22 moment -- and he told you that he did not review 23 the deposition and he did not review medical 24 records. 25 i mean, dr. proctor, with all due respect, he sort of willfully chose not to learn the 2 facts of the case. because what he also told 3 you is that -- you remember what his testimony 4 was about; his testimony was about the tobacco 5 company's conduct, and he said they advertised 6 and they hid the truth and they confused people 7 about the dangers of smoking. i'm not here to 8 debate all those issues in the abstract. that 9 was the class action. we are not here to 10 challenge the class action findings. what we are 11 here to do, what your tasked to do is to figure 12 out how those findings apply to mr. george 13 banks. 14 here's what dr. proctor told you. he knows 15 of no evidence that mr. banks started smoking 16 because of advertising. he knows of no evidence 17 that mr. banks relied on statements by any 18 tobacco company. and he knows of no evidence 19 that mr. banks was ever confused about the 20 dangers of smoking. and you know that the 21 reason he does not know of any evidence is 22 because there is none. there is no evidence of 23 any of those things. you did not hear it during 24 the trial. you did not hear it this morning. 25 instead the plaintiffs spent the whole case reproving the engle findings. the general 2 findings at the class action where really what 3 they spent the majority of their case on. they 4 do not have to reprove those findings. you heard 5 the instruction this morning, they do not have to 6 be proven, they cannot be challenged. 7 now, they have some limitations how they can 8 be used. they cannot be used to determine class 9 membership. they cannot be used to determine 10 whether punitive damages should be awarded. 11 mr. schlesinger: objection. 12 the court: once again, ladies and 13 gentlemen, i instructed you on that. if the 14 lawyers say anything that disagrees with my 15 instructions always follow my instructions. 16 you may proceed. 17 mr. furr: they cannot be used to determine 18 legal causation and they do not prove anything 19 about whether the tobacco companies are liable 20 to mr. banks, that is why you are here. 21 but why did they spend their whole time 22 reproving those cases and taking two weeks to do 23 it? here's the answer. because they have the 24 burden to prove their case to you, but they have 25 no evidence about mr. banks. they have no evidence about mr. banks. 2 and i'm going to go right back to where we 3 started in opening statement, because there is a 4 huge gap in this case. nobody knows anything 5 about mr. banks before 1970 when he is 57 years 6 old. he lived virtually a complete life. he 7 was on the verge of retirement when mrs. banks 8 met him. 9 here's what we know. well, let us look at it 10 from this perspective. think back before this 11 case started. had you asked yourself: what do 12 we know before the case starts about mr. banks' 13 smoking from 1914 to 1970, i think your answer 14 would have had to be nothing. you would not have 15 known anything. what do you know at the end of 16 this case after you have heard all the evidence 17 that the plaintiffs have? same thing, you do not 18 know anything about his smoking between 1914 and 19 1970. and there is a reason for that. 20 nobody ever saw mr. banks smoking before the 21 1970s. now, i acknowledge the medical records 22 take his smoking back to '38. i'm not 23 challenging what the medical records say about 24 when he might have begun smoking. but the point 25 is, there is no eyewitness that can tell you why he started or what he started smoking or who he 2 smoked with or how much he smoked or anything 3 like that. there is no witness who saw what 4 brand he smoked before 1970. 5 here's a case where the plaintiffs are 6 alleging they should be awarded, it sounds like 7 they are really only asking for $500,000 now, you 8 heard millions during voir dire, but in any 9 event, they are asking you for a large sum of 10 money to be awarded against rj reynolds and 11 philip morris, but no one knows whose cigarettes 12 mr. banks smoked before 1970. could have been 13 another company's, could have been 14 roll-your-own, no one knows. 15 here's what we do know. here's what we do 16 know, though, in a case where the plaintiffs are 17 asking for a large sum of money from rj reynolds 18 and philip morris we know that every pack of 19 rj reynolds' cigarettes and philip morris' 20 cigarettes that anyone ever saw mr. banks 21 smoking carried a warning, carried a warning 22 that said, "the surgeon general has determined 23 that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your 24 health." 25 think about this. one of the basic claims in this case, and it is throughout your verdict 2 form and i'll show them to you in just a few 3 minutes, is that mr. banks died because he 4 did not know that smoking was dangerous because 5 rj reynolds and philip morris concealed that 6 from him. that is a claim. 7 how can that be? every pack of our 8 cigarettes that anybody can testify to that he 9 ever smoked had this warning on the side of the 10 packs. and we are going to talk about what 11 mr. lampe said about this warning and, more 12 importantly, what yvonne said about this warning 13 to george. 14 and by the way, i have to refer to yvonne 15 and katrina during the course of my closing. 16 it is kind of a little awkward because they are in 17 the courtroom and they are human and they are 18 there. and i do not mean any disrespect to them 19 and i'm not trying to be rude to them, but we 20 have to talk about the evidence that they gave, 21 that is why i'm talking about them. i mean no 22 disrespect to these ladies who are sitting right 23 here to my right. 24 what else do we know? you know, the claim 25 in this case is that mr. banks was a compulsive chain-smoking nicotine addict. that is the basic 2 claim. they are claiming that because he was a 3 compulsive chain-smoking nicotine addict that 4 they should be given money. 5 who ever saw mr. banks smoke a cigarette in 6 his entire life other than the two ladies that 7 are here asking you for money? nobody. not his 8 best friend, not his acquaintance that he 9 borrowed money from, not his landlady who he 10 lived above for somewhere between three and five 11 years. nobody ever saw him smoke a cigarette. 12 again, i'm not questioning he was a smoker, 13 that is not the point. but was he a compulsive 14 chain-smoking nicotine addict? if that is the 15 case, why did nobody else ever see him smoke? 16 how many neutral witnesses did the 17 plaintiffs bring you? how many witnesses did 18 they bring to you who either they were not paying 19 for their testimony or who were not here seeking 20 money? zero. 21 the only body that brought you neutral 22 witnesses were the defendants. and you know who 23 they are, roosevelt hall -- 24 mr. schlesinger: your honor, i object. may 25 i approach, please? the court: yes, sir. 2 (the following discussion was held at 3 sidebar:) 4 the court: what is it now? 5 mr. schlesinger: you cannot say you are 6 paying for testimony, judge. 7 the court: sustain the objection. 8 mr. schlesinger: can i get a curative? 9 (sidebar discussion was concluded, and the 10 following proceedings were held in open court:) 11 the court: ladies and gentlemen, the 12 testimony about paying for testimony is 13 sustained. you are to disregard the remark. 14 go ahead, mr. furr. 15 mr. furr: and i apologize. i said that the 16 wrong way. witnesses who are being compensated 17 for their time testifying. did not mean to 18 disparage them in any way, just a shorthand to 19 things. 20 but i do not want to lose this point. the 21 only body who brought you any witness who did not 22 have some skin in this game were the defendants. 23 so as we go through and we are trying to 24 reconcile competing views of what the facts 25 were, one of the sources you can always turn to are neutral witnesses who do not have a stake in 2 how this case comes out. 3 on page 3 of your instructions there is a 4 believability of witnesses instructions and 5 you will see that one of the things you can 6 evaluate is whether the witness had an interest 7 in the case, because of course an interest in 8 the case may influence the way you testify. 9 that is in your instructions. 10 the evidence demonstrates a very telling 11 moment in the case was dr. difranza's testimony. 12 you might remember dr. difranza has testified he 13 told you first time he testified against the 14 tobacco companies were 25 years ago. he is been 15 doing this for a long time. 16 and what did he tell you about this case? 17 he was asked "and you have never had another 18 case where you had less information about the 19 smoker from the period of his birth until age 20 60, right? 21 "right." 22 there is just a complete failure of proof 23 because the plaintiffs do not have the facts they 24 need to prove their claims to you. 25 let us organize ourselves around the legal issues so that as we look at the evidence we can 2 work through how that evidence applies to the 3 case, because there are three fundamental sets 4 of issues. i told you you have got 18 verdict 5 questions. it sounds awful. 6 but you can group those verdict questions 7 around three fundamental issues; the first is 8 whether he was a class member. they failed to 9 prove that to you. 10 the second is whether mr. banks died because 11 he did not know that smoking was dangerous after 12 may 5th, 1982 because of something the 13 defendants did. that question actually appears 14 about three times on your verdict form. we will 15 look at that. 16 finally, this issue that mr. schlesinger 17 raised with you this morning, and that is whether 18 yvonne and katrina are entitled to money damages 19 for the loss of mr. banks, and that primarily 20 deals with really what the nature of the family 21 relationship was. we talked to you about that 22 in voir dire. you have heard evidence. and 23 mr. schlesinger acknowledged that that is 24 important for you to consider. so we are going 25 to work our way through that and remind ourselves of what those facts were. 2 class membership. first, plaintiffs have 3 the burden of proof of class membership, first 4 thing to understand. there are basically three 5 components of class membership. first, the 6 plaintiffs have to prove to you, and i'll deal 7 with esophageal cancer and emphysema separately, 8 although they are basically the same except for 9 the first element. 10 the plaintiffs have to prove to you that 11 mr. banks died from esophageal cancer caused by 12 smoking, that is number one. 13 second, they have to prove to you that 14 mr. banks was addicted to nicotine. 15 and finally, and this is a separate piece of 16 proof they have to offer to you, that addiction 17 to nicotine was a legal cause of george banks' 18 death. 19 the important thing to understand here is 20 these are like three boxes that they have to 21 check off. if they miss any one of them he is 22 not a member of the class. so they have got three 23 different burdens they have to carry even to 24 establish that he was a class member. and we are 25 looking at each of these three separately to parse them out so you can evaluate what the 2 evidence actually was. 3 and we will start at the beginning with 4 esophageal cancer. 5 first part of class membership, on the 6 esophageal cancer claim, they have to prove that 7 he died from esophageal cancer caused by 8 smoking. 9 well, what was the evidence? dr. difranza, 10 first medical witness in the case, told you that 11 mr. banks had at least four risk factors that 12 could have been related to his esophageal 13 cancer. he told you that gender and age are 14 important risk factors. if you are a male and 15 you are over 50 years old your chance goes up, 16 that is life, that is how things are. he also 17 told you that alcohol and cigarettes are the 18 largest risk factors for esophageal cancer. 19 dr. traube, the other medical witness, 20 agreed with that. 21 alcohol. let us talk about what was said 22 about alcohol, because it is actually the key to 23 understanding the case. it is the key to 24 understanding both medical causation and 25 addiction causation, because really this case is in fact more about alcohol than it is about 2 tobacco when you understand the facts of the 3 case. 4 dr. proctor, dr. traube, both witnesses 5 called by the plaintiff. on cross-examination 6 here's what they both told you, that alcohol is 7 a major cause of esophageal cancer and the more 8 you drink and the longer you drink the greater 9 your risk is. 10 then we asked dr. proctor this question, i 11 asked him, "would you agree that about 70 12 percent of the esophageal cancer cases are 13 attributable to alcohol consumption? 14 he said, "ballpark, i agree with that." 15 ballpark, i agree with that. 16 think about what that means. 75 percent? 17 that means 3 out of 4. so if you have four 18 cases of esophageal cancer before you and 19 nothing more, dr. proctor has conceded that 3 20 out of those 4 cases would be attributable to 21 alcohol consumption. 22 smoking cigarettes can cause esophageal 23 cancer also. nobody disputes that. but there is 24 a very important concept to understand, and it is 25 pretty common sense. why do doctors tell people that they should quit smoking? because when you 2 quit smoking, your risk of developing a disease 3 goes down. and the longer you quit, the longer 4 it is been since you quit the lower your risk is. 5 so in evaluating whether smoking was a cause 6 of the esophageal cancer it is important to 7 understand how long after he quit smoking that 8 that esophogeal cancer developed and what does 9 the science tell us about what his risk from his 10 cigarette smoking would have been by the time 11 his esophageal cancer developed. 12 and dr. difranza told you what that evidence 13 is. he said based on the surgeon general that 14 within five years of quitting, five years, your 15 chance of cancer of the throat, mouth and 16 esophagus is cut in half, is cut in half. 17 another way of saying it is cut in half, 18 another way of saying it is is that in five 19 years after you quit it is more likely than not 20 that you will not develop cancer from that 21 exposure, because it is a fifty percent level, more 22 likely than not you will not develop. 23 so we need to look at mr. banks' smoking 24 when he quit and when the cancer developed. 25 because after five years, after he quit smoking, dr. difranza told us that his risk would have 2 been cut in half from smoking. 3 what do we know? we know from the medical 4 records, they are very clear, that he quit two 5 years prior to the 1990 admission. you all 6 remember when he fell down, hurt his hand, went 7 in, gave a history multiple times. both the 8 admitting nurse and the anesthesia nurse -- 9 anesthesia doctor who did a probing interview 10 because they are getting ready to administer the 11 man anesthesia, they need to know what is going 12 on with him so they know what drugs to give him 13 and how much to give him, both of them had found 14 out he had quit in 1988. 15 yvonne and katrina came in here and told you 16 he never quit. they came in and told you he 17 never quit. but their experts did not agree with 18 them. their experts, who read the depositions, 19 and our expert, who read the depositions, looked 20 at the medical records, considered all the 21 evidence in the case, all three experts who 22 testified on this issue rejected that testimony. 23 dr. difranza, dr. traube, the plaintiff's 24 experts, both told you that they believe based 25 on the totality of evidence in this case that mr. banks quit in 1988. and dr. hoge told you 2 the same thing. 3 and, frankly, the truth is ms. banks told 4 you the same thing if you look at her deposition 5 testimony and not her trial testimony. you 6 know, in trial ms. banks told you that he only 7 quit when they put him in a casket. but you 8 might remember during cross-examination she 9 acknowledged that in 1988 -- excuse me, she 10 acknowledged in her deposition, she said that 11 she did not know whether he smoked after 1988. 12 so really when you go back to when her 13 memory was better, she did not know either. 14 there is just no credible evidence that he smoked 15 after 1988. 16 he quit not five years but eight years 17 before he developed esophageal cancer. in 1996 18 he had been quit since 1988. so as the 19 witnesses explained to you, the longer you quit 20 the lower your risk was. his risk would have 21 been decreased by more than fifty percent from the 22 smoking by the time he developed esophageal 23 cancer. so what causes esophageal cancer? what 24 did he continue to do during those intervening 25 eight years that we all know is a major risk factor and causes 75 percent of the esophageal 2 cancer? you heard this morning mr. schlesinger 3 told you that mr. banks was a problem drinker 4 and they acknowledged that. so did all the 5 experts. the experts said he was a problem 6 drinker. mr. schlesinger said he was a problem 7 drinker. all of the medical records that you are 8 going to have and be able to look through them 9 all you want say that he was a problem drinker, 10 that he was a heavy user of alcohol, that he had 11 substance abuse and alcohol abuse. and by the 12 way, the substance abuse is etoh, it is not any 13 other substance. but the medical records say he 14 was a heavy drinker. 15 and remember who wrote these. these are the 16 folks who were taking care of him, who asked him 17 about his smoking -- excuse me, about his 18 drinking and who used their professional 19 judgment to determine what significance that was 20 for him. his own doctors thought he was a 21 problem drinker. 22 the neutral witnesses told us that he had 23 been drinking for a long time. remember 24 diedrich lampe, his best friend, ms. banks told 25 you, his best friend, knew him since the '40s all the way through the '80s, even kept checking 2 on him as he got older, because he was fond of 3 him, told you that even back in the '40s when 4 was working for diedrich and his father and both 5 at work at jacksonville liquors and in their 6 home that sometimes mr. banks drank more than he 7 should and he would not make it to work. 8 by the way, i'm not doing a character 9 assassination, as was suggested this morning. 10 we are just talking about the evidence as it 11 relates to the issues you have to decide, 12 medical causation and addiction causation. 13 roosevelt hall, mr. banks' acquaintance, 14 told you that he saw him about 150 times between 15 1965 and 1977 and mr. hall told you that he 16 observed -- would tease mr. banks about being 17 under the weather and that most of the time he 18 saw him, most of the time he saw him mr. banks 19 had been drinking. 20 and then helen hall norman, his landlady, 21 the dates were a little confusing, but the best 22 way to piece them all together, because it looks 23 like she was his landlady from 1980 to 1985. so 24 she was his landlady both when katrina and 25 yvonne were still living in jacksonville and after they moved to miami. what did ms. hall 2 tell us? that she saw mr. banks intoxicated, 3 that he would drink with his roommate melvin 4 austin and that when she saw him coming and 5 going, remember, she lived right below him in 6 the same building, and she said she could see 7 him coming and going as he approached the 8 building, when she would see him coming and going 9 that he looked like he had been drinking. 10 then we had another episode where -- you 11 know, the fact of the matter is yvonne also told 12 you that he was a frequent drinker. let us look 13 at what happened during this trial. during this 14 trial in front of you yvonne testified that i 15 never saw him drink. i never saw him drinking. 16 but as dr. traube explained to you, the 17 plaintiff's expert explained to you that the 18 february 1996 medical record says that mr. banks 19 drank beer, liquor and wine very frequently, and 20 it says, wife gave info. wife gave info. 21 that is what dr. traube told you. so that was -- 22 i'm not picking on ms. banks in any way. that 23 was 18 years ago, 18 years ago. 24 but we have a medical record from 18 years 25 ago where mrs. banks told the health care providers that he was a very frequent drinker. 2 i want to talk about what dr. traube told 3 you. because you might remember dr. traube, the 4 doctor who came down here from new york. what 5 you might remember was that dr. traube was also 6 a lawyer, that he was not a practicing lawyer, 7 but he would been through law school. 8 well, you saw him testify and you get to 9 evaluate his demeanor and how he handled 10 cross-examination, because you saw, basically 11 dr. traube knew all the tricks. 12 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor. 13 the court: sustained. not proper argument. 14 sustained. 15 mr. furr: dr. traube would not admit that 16 anything was authoritative. he would not admit 17 that any source was authoritative and thus he 18 avoided being cross-examined. but what 19 happened? frankly, in the end he broke, in the 20 end he broke. and let us look at his series of 21 admissions that he made that taken together 22 completely demonstrate that it was the alcohol 23 that was the only legal cause of mr. banks' 24 esophageal cancer. 25 the first thing he told us on cross-examination was that "mr. banks' alcohol 2 use enormously," his word, "enormously increased 3 his risk of developing esophageal cancer." 4 then he broke a little more and he candidly 5 admitted that the alcohol consumption was a 6 cause, a cause of mr. banks' esophageal cancer. 7 that is the plaintiff's medical doctor that 8 they brought to you. 9 he also told you that had mr. banks quit 10 drinking when he quit smoking he would have 11 decreased his risk of esophageal cancer by 50 12 percent, fifty percent. but then he went further, 13 he went further. the final, the final admission 14 that dr. traube made is that if mr. banks had 15 stopped drinking when he stopped smoking he 16 could have avoided esophageal cancer, he could 17 have avoided esophageal cancer. 18 now, you will see when you read your 19 instructions, page 4 of your instructions 20 there is a lengthy instruction about causation. 21 and here's the part i want to focus on. this is 22 class membership instruction. in the third 23 paragraph down you will see that -- this language, 24 "but for the addiction to cigarettes containing 25 nicotine, such as emphysema, esophageal cancer, the death would not have occurred. [sic] 2 little abstract, but the point is it is 3 but/for causation, but/for causation. 4 and by this admission dr. traube has 5 admitted there is no but/for causation for 6 nicotine addiction, that it was his drinking 7 that was the cause of his esophageal cancer. 8 the other theory that you heard during the 9 case, and i want to talk about all the theories 10 you heard. you heard, well, maybe it was some 11 synergistic reaction between smoking and 12 drinking. 13 mr. schlesinger: your honor, can i 14 approach, please? 15 the court: yes, sir. 16 (the following discussion was held at 17 sidebar:) 18 mr. schlesinger: with all due respect, you 19 cannot put up testimony without giving a page and 20 line. we are in the middle of a trial with the 21 trial transcript. 22 the court: it is overruled, sir. the jury 23 can remember it, disregard it, whatever they 24 want to do. overruled. 25 (sidebar discussion was concluded, and the united reporting, inc. 954-525-2221 0dbf17df-fc10-4733-840d-3f3c4a4ca47d 1 following proceedings were held in open court:) 2 mr. furr: final theory you heard about 3 causation was that, well, maybe it is synergy, 4 maybe it is alcohol and tobacco acting together. 5 well, in order to act together they both have to 6 be present at the same time. 7 you know, you have heard he quit smoking in 8 1988, developed his disease in 1996. so for the 9 last eight years there could not have been any 10 type of synergy because he was not smoking any 11 longer. but he continued to drink, and it 12 actually looks like his drinking accelerated. 13 and the evidence demonstrates that the only 14 cause of his esophageal cancer was his 15 problematic abuse of alcohol consumption. 16 now, let us think about what the evidence was 17 even further. the treatment records, the 18 medical records do not say that smoking caused 19 his cancer. the autopsy does not say that 20 smoking caused his cancer. the death 21 certificate does not say that smoking caused his 22 cancer. in the process of providing care none 23 of the records say that smoking caused his 24 cancer. the only record that says anything 25 about smoking caused his cancer was this record that was created at mrs. banks' request two 2 months after his death. and if you look at this 3 letter you will see that mrs. banks requested a 4 doctor to send her a letter that smoking caused 5 his cancer and you will have to decide why this 6 letter was requested. 7 let us talk about the emphysema. you know, 8 this is the easiest issue in the case by far, 9 because the emphysema was a complete nonissue in 10 this case. dr. difranza told you that he was of 11 the opinion that mr. banks might not have even 12 noticed that he had emphysema. 13 dr. traube told you that mr. banks did not 14 complain of symptoms, that none of the treaters 15 that took care of him saw his symptoms, that it 16 did not affect him in any substantial way. 17 could i have the elmo, please. 18 thank you, baron. 19 your first two questions are class 20 membership. ladies and gentlemen, i'm going to 21 suggest to you that even before we get to 22 addiction and addiction causation that the 23 plaintiff's proof has failed on both of those. 24 and if you agree, no, your foreman goes to the 25 back of this verdict form, signs it and we all go home. 2 back to the monitor, please, baron. thank 3 you. 4 but that is not all the plaintiffs have to do 5 to prove he is a class member. they have to 6 prove that mr. banks was addicted to nicotine, 7 that mr. banks was addicted to nicotine. so 8 let us look at what the evidence was on that 9 issue. because really the only thing that was 10 proven to you is that mr. banks was a smoker, 11 that for some period of time he was being 12 observed smoking a pack a day. the question for 13 you is, is that enough for the plaintiffs to 14 satisfy their burden? 15 their own witnesses told you it is not. they 16 told you that not all smokers are addicted and 17 that the latest, greatest best -- did i hit 18 something, cliff? 19 -- the latest, greatest best available 20 information is that about fifty percent of regular 21 smokers are not addicted. 22 you were told that people smoke for other 23 reasons. i mean, it was belittled this morning 24 but both of these witnesses, dr. difranza and 25 dr. hoge, told you that people smoke for enjoyment, pleasure, relaxation, concentration 2 enhancement. it is a habit for some people. 3 it is a habit for some people. 4 so let us look closer to see whether 5 mr. banks fits in the fifty percent category of 6 addicted smokers or whether he fits in the other 7 category of nonaddicted smokers. again, let us 8 look at what the neutral fact witnesses told us. 9 mr. lampe, his best friend, never saw him smoke 10 a cigarette in over 40 years. they worked 11 together. mr. lampe visited him, checked on 12 him. they worked side by side, shoulder to 13 shoulder, riding in the same truck together 14 moving that equipment for a couple months at a 15 time in the 1940s. he never saw him smoke a 16 cigarette. he never smelled smoke on mr. banks 17 or in his apartment. he never saw him bum a 18 cigarette. 19 mr. hall saw him 150 times when he would 20 come see mr. hall. never saw him with a 21 cigarette, never saw him smoke a cigarette, 22 never smelled cigarettes on him. 23 ms. north, his landlady, of all the times, 24 she told you she saw him every three or four 25 days, that he would be coming and going, going up and down the steps. she would see him every month 2 when he would come down to pay his rent, never 3 saw him smoke. if he is an addicted smoker 4 smoking compulsively, as a nicotine addict, how 5 could it be that every neutral witness in the 6 case never saw him smoke? how can that be? 7 both experts in the case, dr. difranza and 8 dr. hoge, admitted to you that mr. banks could 9 control his smoking. they both told you he 10 was not a chain smoker, that he did things like 11 he always went outside to smoke, he would not 12 smoke around katrina, he would not smoke in 13 church or meals, places that he was supposed to 14 not smoke he was able to control himself. he 15 was not somebody who was controlled by nicotine. 16 he controlled his smoking. 17 let us go to the medical records. no doctor 18 who ever treated mr. banks while he was alive 19 diagnosed him with addiction to cigarettes or 20 nicotine. there is no medical record that says 21 that mr. banks was addicted to cigarettes with 22 nicotine or abusing tobacco. he was never 23 diagnosed as addicted to cigarettes before this 24 lawsuit. eighteen years after his death is the 25 first time that anybody had ever diagnosed him as abusing -- or excuse me, as a nicotine 2 addict, which you know that his treaters were 3 sensitive to issues of dependence and abuse and 4 addiction because they documented in the medical 5 records that he was abusing alcohol. so it is 6 not like they missed this issue. they knew the 7 significance of evaluating addiction issues for 8 their patients as they treated him. they 9 identified that he was an alcohol addict or 10 abusing alcohol, but there is not a single 11 notation that he had any problems with nicotine. 12 finally we brought you dr. hoge. you know, 13 this is a case where the plaintiffs are asking 14 for significant amounts of money. it is your 15 decision as to what being addicted to nicotine 16 means. my suggestion to you is that at a 17 minimum it should mean that a smoker meets 18 medical diagnostic criteria that are used by 19 health care providers to diagnose whether 20 someone is addicted to nicotine. 21 and dr. hoge just yesterday walked through 22 his careful, elaborate analysis of whether 23 mr. banks met the medical diagnostic criteria 24 embodied in the dsm-5, the text that 25 psychiatrists use and psychologists use to diagnose people. 2 he told you the first problem is the 3 threshold requirement. mr. banks had no 4 significant clinical impairment. there just was 5 no evidence that smoking was interfering with 6 mr. banks' life. you can imagine a smoker who 7 hated it, who tried everything they could do to 8 quit, who was tormented by their smoking, 9 tortured by it, who talked about it, who thought 10 about it, who was obsessed with it, who was 11 driven crazy by their inability to quit. that is 12 not mr. banks. there was none of that evidence 13 for mr. banks. 14 dr. hoge told you, as we just discussed, he 15 controlled his smoking and there is no evidence 16 whatsoever of compulsive smoking. no evidence 17 of compulsive smoking. 18 so i suggest to you, ladies and gentlemen, 19 that on the second prong of class membership, 20 whether mr. banks was addicted, that is another 21 independent reason -- can i have the elmo, 22 please, baron -- another independent reason of 23 why mr. banks is not a member of the engle 24 class. 25 now, remember there only has to be one x on the no side for any of these three things the 2 plaintiffs have to prove. they did not prove any 3 of them, so they failed three different times. 4 thank you, baron. if i could go back to the 5 projector. 6 third, the plaintiffs have to prove that 7 addiction to nicotine was a legal cause of 8 mr. banks' death. it is kind of a strange 9 concept. how could addiction to nicotine be a 10 legal cause? submit to you there is only one way 11 that addiction could be a legal cause of 12 somebody's disease and death, and that is if the 13 addiction prevented that person from being able 14 to quit in time to avoid their disease, if the 15 addiction was so strong that it compelled 16 somebody to continue using the substance and it 17 rendered them unable to quit and ultimately 18 caused their disease. 19 mr. schlesinger: judge, i object. violates 20 preclusive findings, not the law, not the 21 instructions. 22 the court: again, ladies and gentlemen, all 23 of this is set out in the instructions and 24 you will follow the instructions as i've given 25 them to you in those instructions. you may continue, sir. 2 mr. furr: so i'm suggesting to you that the 3 question you can ask yourself is, was he 4 rendered unable to quit and avoid his disease? 5 well, you know that is just not the case. 6 let us remind ourselves generally about how 7 smokers quit then we will look at mr. banks. and 8 i'm going to use only the surgeon general's 9 quitting statistics, not somebody else's, not 10 the tobacco companies', but the surgeon 11 general's quitting statistics. 12 dr. proctor told you about all of this. by 13 1965 17.6 million americans had quit, before the 14 first warning went on the pack, they quit 15 because of the information about the dangers of 16 smoking, dr. proctor told you. 17 in the 15 years between '64 when we had the 18 surgeon general's report and '79, 30 million 19 more quit, 2 million a year on average, about 5 20 or 6,000 people a day. 21 and today we know that about 60 million 22 people have quit, a much larger number than 23 number of people who currently smoke. 24 well, okay, were these quitters light 25 smokers? were they nonaddicted smokers? next logical question. it is a fair question. here's 2 the evidence. dr. difranza and dr. cummings, 3 who you may not remember, he was a video that 4 you saw early on, and dr. hoge all told you the 5 same thing; of the 60 million americans who 6 quit, ninety percent of them they thought would have 7 been addicted. dr. hoge told you the new 8 statistics are fifty percent, but dr. difranza said 9 ninety percent would have been addicted, 90 to 95 10 percent quit cold turkey. being addicted does 11 not compel you to smoke yourself to death. it 12 just does not. dr. hoge told you an addiction 13 diagnosis is not a person. there is more to a 14 person than a diagnosis. there is that person's 15 decision-making, their willpower, the choices 16 that they make. 17 dr. proctor told you that in fact heavy 18 smokers quit. from the '70s on dr. proctor told 19 you that the average smoker who quit smoked more 20 than a pack a day, more than a pack a day, so 21 it is the heavy smokers who can quit. 22 one of the ways you can evaluate this, 23 because, you know, during the trial it was 24 depicted to you that smoking is a horrific thing 25 to try to quit and it is torture for people, and i'm not disputing that it can be hard for some 2 people, but let us look at what the plaintiff's 3 experts say outside the courtroom, outside the 4 courtroom. 5 dr. cummings. "and when smokers come to 6 your stop-smoking clinic, you tell them that the 7 success rate for quitting among people who 8 really want to quit and stick to it is a hundred 9 percent, right?" 10 "answer: yes, i do say that in my 11 literature." 12 dr. cummings wrote a stop-smoking guide for 13 the american cancer society. "do you have what 14 it takes to stop smoking? there is no magic cure 15 that can help you stop smoking. take this short 16 quiz. find out if you have what it takes. do 17 you want to stop smoking? are you motivated? 18 are you willing to make some changes in your 19 daily routine? are you willing to put up with 20 some uneasy moments after stopping? 21 "if you can answer yes to all three 22 questions you can stop smoking." 23 again, what is said outside courtroom. 24 dr. difranza outside the courtroom. "and 25 you certainly would never tell one of your patients that they cannot quit smoking? 2 "answer: i would not." 3 so now let us turn to mr. banks and this 4 final component of class membership, this issue 5 of addiction causation. suggest to you that 6 here's the way to think about it. was mr. banks 7 compelled to smoke so that he was unable to quit 8 and prevent his death, or was he a problem 9 drinker who did not quit smoking before 1988 10 because he chose to drink and smoke daily? 11 it is an either/or. it really cannot be both. 12 well, you have heard the plaintiffs have 13 admitted that "mr. banks' acts or omissions 14 relating to the frequency and duration of these 15 efforts to quit smoking were a legal cause of 16 his death." 17 were a legal cause of death. 18 you will see it that in the instructions. you 19 heard it this morning when mr. schlesinger told 20 you we take responsibility. 21 let us take a step back, because you are 22 allowed to draw inferences from the evidence. 23 you are allowed to consider, what does this 24 really mean? and as you think through what this 25 admission really means, i'm going to suggest to you that it means this. it means it is 2 implicitly an admission that mr. banks knew that 3 smoking was dangerous but continued to smoke. 4 because why would someone ever admit on behalf 5 of their family member that they were a cause of 6 their own death if they did not know? if they 7 did not know you would not say they were a cause. 8 second, it means that he had the ability to 9 quit smoking, the ability to quit smoking 10 earlier. because if he was hopelessly addicted 11 and unable to quit why would you ever admit that 12 he was a cause of his own death? 13 finally, that admission implicitly means 14 that he had the ability to quit smoking at a 15 time that would have prevented his death. 16 because the admission is that he was a cause of 17 his own death. that admission would never be 18 made if they did not believe that he could have 19 quit in time to prevent his own death. 20 important piece of information for you to 21 consider, not just the literal words, but the 22 inferences, what actually underlies that 23 admission, so you can think through what does 24 that mean for the issue you have to decide in 25 this case? well, let us zero in on mr. banks, because 2 that is where we should be. could he quit? of 3 course he could. we know because he did quit. 4 we know because he did quit. we know with 100 5 percent certainty that he could quit. he quit 6 in 1988. 7 dr. hoge explained to you that being 8 addicted to nicotine does not mean -- simply 9 does not mean that a person loses the ability to 10 control their smoking. and he told you that 11 based upon all the evidence nicotine addiction 12 was not a cause of mr. banks' esophageal cancer. 13 if it was not nicotine addiction, what was going 14 on? you know the answer to that question. 15 alcohol causes a loss of control. dr. difranza, 16 dr. traube, dr. hoge all told you that alcohol 17 use lowers inhibitions -- everybody knows 18 that -- reduces willpower and makes it more 19 difficult to quit smoking. that is why he did not 20 quit before 1988. although clearly when he was 21 drinking, he demonstrated he still had the 22 ability to quit. 60 million smokers quit. 23 why did not mr. banks quit earlier? why 24 did not he quit smoking earlier? were the 25 cigarettes he was smoking more addictive than other cigarettes? no evidence of that 2 whatsoever. 3 was his brain affected differently than 4 smokers who quit? no evidence of that. 5 was he exposed to advertising different than 6 the smokers who quit? no evidence of that. 7 was he exposed to tobacco company statements 8 different than other smokers? no evidence. 9 did he smoke more or longer than smokers who 10 quit? no. you just saw that the average 11 quitter smoked a pack a day. 12 what was the difference between him and 13 other people who quit sooner -- because he did 14 quit, but who quit sooner? because he was a 15 problem drinker. his problem drinking was a 16 barrier to him quitting smoking. 17 the court: one hour, sir. 18 mr. furr: thank you very much, your honor. 19 why did not he quit? he did not do the types 20 of things that people need to do -- that people 21 do when they want to quit. he did not -- you 22 know, you were told that motivation and 23 persistence is the key to quitting, you have to 24 want to quit, you have to try to quit. that is 25 how people accomplish most things in life, including quitting smoking. you were told he 2 did not do any of the things that people do. he 3 did not ask for help. he did not go to the 4 doctor. he did not even throw away his 5 cigarettes. he did not go to any clinic. he 6 did not go a single day without smoking. there is 7 simply no evidence that he was motivated to 8 quitting smoking and persistent in his efforts 9 to quit smoking. 10 if this were a case where the smoker had 11 tried to quit 30, 40 times and went through just 12 an awful time every time you would have a different 13 case before you, but that is just not what you 14 have, and mrs. banks told us that. 15 here's what she was asked: "ma'am, this 16 first time he tried to quit smoking he actually 17 stopped smoking for less than an hour; is that 18 correct? 19 "answer, yes. 20 "question: okay, ma'am. when you were 21 living in miami from 1983 to 1992, you do not 22 have any knowledge about mr. banks trying to 23 quit smoking, do you? 24 "answer: did not i just tell you that he 25 tried to quit smoking once? "yes, ma'am, you did. 2 "well then, you got the answer." 3 mrs. banks, one time for one hour in a 4 50-year period of smoking and the claim is that 5 his smoking -- nicotine compelled him to smoke 6 and left him unable to quit in time to avoid the 7 disease? it does not make any sense. one hour 8 in 50 years? 9 i'm going to suggest to you that the third 10 prong of class membership the plaintiffs also 11 failed to prove to you, and that is this idea of 12 addiction causation. there is no evidence that 13 he had an inability to quit smoking in time to 14 prevent his death, if the smoking was even a 15 cause of his disease. 16 could i have the elmo. thank you. 17 so, ladies and gentlemen, there is actually 18 three reasons why class membership fails in this 19 case, three independent reasons. there only has 20 to be one for esophageal cancer and emphysema, 21 but there are three on each of them. and if 22 that is what you find based on your evidence and 23 analysis then you go to the last page, sign and 24 date your verdict form and we all go home. 25 but of course i'm obligated to discuss all the other issues in the case with you so that is 2 what i'm going to do. 3 i want to go through this concealment issue, 4 this issue of whether mr. banks died because he 5 did not know that smoking was dangerous. you are 6 actually going to see that it disappears in 7 verdict form questions 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13 8 and 14. 9 like i said, we can group these questions 10 together. it is the same analysis for all of 11 them. you have concealment questions related to 12 both esophageal cancer and emphysema. you have 13 concealment questions related to both 14 concealment and agreement to conceal. there 15 ended up being eight different concealment 16 questions. they all really boil down to the 17 same thing, and that is whether the plaintiffs 18 have proven to you, have they proven to you that 19 mr. banks died because he did not know that 20 smoking was dangerous because that information 21 was concealed from him by the tobacco companies. 22 and there is a very important instruction for 23 you to look at in that regard. 24 on page 11 of your instructions in the third 25 paragraph you will see the last sentence of the third paragraph on page 11 says this, "however, 2 george banks cannot be found to have reasonably 3 relied upon his statement if he knew it was 4 false or its falsity was obvious to him or that 5 the fact allegedly concealed was already known 6 to him." already known to him. 7 what is all that mean? it means you cannot 8 conceal something from somebody who already 9 knows it. pretty common sense. if you already 10 know something no one can conceal it from you, 11 it is already information that you have. 12 so we need to look quickly at what was known 13 about the dangers of smoking in general and what 14 mr. banks knew to determine whether, in fact, 15 his failure to understand that smoking can be 16 dangerous was a legal cause of his death. 17 the question becomes: was the dangers of 18 smoking a secret? if it was a secret and people 19 did not know about it that would be an important 20 thing to know. you know that is not true. i'm 21 going to have to go a little faster than i would 22 like to through this, but you know that tv, 23 radio, newspaper, magazines, public health 24 authorities, doctors, churches, schools all were 25 important sources of information about the dangers of smoking beginning back in the 1800s. 2 and dr. proctor told you just that. i will not 3 go through this busy slide but he told you that 4 beginning in the 1800s it was widely discussed 5 that smoking is bad for you, contains nicotine, 6 that school textbooks from the 1800s warned 7 people that smoking could shorten their life and 8 addiction was being discussed. 9 florida health notes 1906, though eight 10 years before mr. banks is born, "today the 11 cigarette is looked upon by all smokers as the 12 very worst form of tobacco addiction. it is 13 generally inhaled." generally inhaled. 14 and i had not planned on doing this, but i 15 think there is an issue i need to address. 16 can we have the elmo again, please? 17 this morning mr. schlesinger told me that i 18 hurt his ego during opening statement. i did not 19 mean to do that. he also suggested to you that 20 i misled you. surely did not mean to do that and 21 i did not do that. 22 please write this exhibit number down, aws 23 000054, 54. 24 i told you that the surgeon general of the 25 united states had written a document in 1915 that said that cigarette smoking can be 2 addictive. here it is. 3 first, this is from the united states public 4 health service, the branch of the government 5 that publish surgeon general's reports. 6 the health of garment workers by a doctor 7 who is the surgeon from the u.s. public health 8 service, prepared by direction of the surgeon 9 general. in 1915. 10 if you turn to page 28 of this document, you 11 will see this sentence, "it seems that cigarette 12 smoking is by far the most popular form of 13 tobacco addiction among male garment workers." 14 and as if that were not enough, we 15 cross-examined dr. proctor on this very subject. 16 he was asked, "sir, you were asked the question 17 and gave the answer: '1915 the surgeon general 18 of the united states took the position that 19 smoking is addictive, right? 20 "and your answer was 'yes.' correct? 21 "yes." 22 complete sideshow, has nothing to do with 23 any important issue in this case, but i just 24 wanted to make sure the record was clear about 25 whether anything has been misrepresented to you all by me during my opening statement. 2 could i go back to the projector, please. 3 okay. i got a little click happy. do not 4 have much time to go through all these general 5 things. you have heard all this. it was in 6 textbooks in the 1920s. dr. proctor told you 7 that beginning in the 1950s people began 8 quitting in large numbers. why? because the 9 major reason was the fear created about smoking 10 and their health, right? 11 mr. banks would have been about 40 years old 12 in 1954, 40 years old. 13 public health authorities of the day, 1957, 14 mr. banks is 43 years old, the surgeon general, 15 dr. heller both testified in congress that just 16 like we have been discussing, the public had been 17 informed through radio, television, tv, 18 newspaper, the public was being told what was 19 going on, people got to make choices, the 20 information was out there, they heard they made 21 their own choices. 22 in 1964 the surgeon general's report came 23 out. front page news. this is the newspaper 24 that mr. banks read. "cigarette smoking held 25 grave hazard to health in the u.s. heavy cigarette smoking is the principal cause of 2 cancer of the lungs and the larynx and the 3 health hazard so grave as to call for remedial 4 action." 5 the information was everywhere, radio, tv, 6 newspapers, magazine covers. you saw all that. 7 you saw the press conference. the message 8 was everywhere. 9 florida public health organization the very 10 next year said, "nearly all floridians have 11 heard about this." 12 and soon after that the warning label went 13 on. 14 1966 the first warning label went on the 15 packages of cigarettes. 16 dr. daniel horne, the public health 17 authority responsible for distributing 18 information about the dangers of smoking in the 19 1960s said this, and i'm going to read it 20 because it just speaks volumes. "you could 21 stand on the rooftop and shout 'smoking is 22 dangerous at the top of your lungs' and you 23 would not be telling anyone anything they did 24 not already know." 25 how could mr. banks miss the message? take a step back from this, ask yourself, 2 search your minds, there has not been one single 3 piece of evidence, not one piece of testimony, 4 not one document, nothing, no one has ever said 5 that mr. banks did not know that smoking was 6 dangerous. that is the claim before you, that he 7 died because he did not know it. 8 who said he did not know? yvonne did not say 9 that. katrina did not say that. it is not in the 10 medical records. there is a complete absence of 11 proof. not one witness ever uttered a syllable 12 to the effect that mr. banks did not know that 13 smoking was dangerous. 14 instead what were we told? 15 yvonne told you that he might have had 16 limited education but he kept up with current 17 events, he watched the news, he read the 18 newspapers. and more importantly, yvonne made 19 sure that he knew. she made sure that he knew 20 that smoking was dangerous. here's what she 21 told us: while living in jacksonville before 22 1982, she told him about articles that she saw 23 about smoking in her magazines. she told him 24 about things that she had seen on tv about 25 smoking, including anti-smoking commercials, including anti-smoking commercials. 2 i was going to show you one. in the 3 interest of time i'm going to skip past it. 4 you remember the type of public health 5 service announcement being played. you saw it 6 during dr. proctor's examination, things like 7 the american cancer society talked about 8 warnings and how quitting benefits your health. 9 the information was everywhere. yvonne saw it. 10 she told george about it. 11 and then maybe one of the most important 12 pieces of evidence in the case. 1970 this 13 warning label went on the package of cigarettes. 14 no dispute, also no dispute that it is accurate 15 as a matter of federal law. "warning: the 16 surgeon general has determined that cigarette 17 smoking is dangerous to your health." is 18 dangerous to your health. 19 a seminal piece of evidence in this case 20 because of what happened after this warning went 21 on packages. 22 first, did people about it in general know 23 [sic]? 24 well, let us look at what diedrich lampe, 25 mr. banks' best friend, told you. mr. lampe knew him from the '40s to the '80s. mr. lampe 2 told me that he quit smoking when the dangers 3 came out and he said something, maybe it is a 4 little bit crude, maybe it is a little bit 5 insensitive, but this was mr. lampe's testimony 6 and this was a common guy speaking about what 7 was commonly known about the dangers of smoking 8 by virtue of that warning being on the pack. 9 mr. lampe told you, warnings were printed 10 all over the pack. it was obvious that smoking 11 is harmful to your health. when he was asked 12 whether he knew smoking was harmful, he said, 13 i'm not a mental paraplegic. 14 now, what did he mean by that? again, it is 15 a little insensitive and crude, but this was his 16 words. he meant that it was obvious to anyone. 17 it is on the side of the package. how could you 18 not know it? 19 and certainly mr. banks could not have known 20 it, because mrs. banks told you that when she 21 saw the warning label that the surgeon general 22 had determined that cigarette smoking is 23 dangerous to your health, when she first saw it 24 she brought the label to the attention of 25 mr. banks. she warned him to heed that warning. and what else did she tell you? she told 2 you that he knew it was not good for him. she 3 told you that she explained to him that smoking 4 was not healthy for him, that he would be 5 healthier for him if he quit. healthier for him 6 if he quit while she was in jacksonville. 7 and then ultimately the single most powerful 8 piece of evidence in the whole case was this 9 testimony by mrs. banks. 10 "he knew it was not good for him." 11 "he knew it was not good for him." 12 all of the verdict form questions related to 13 concealment, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12 -- let me make 14 sure i got the numbers right. 15 could i have the elmo again. 16 starting with 4, i will not read it all to you, 17 but 4, 5, 6, 7, and then again related to the 18 emphysema 11, 12, 13 and 14 all essentially ask 19 you the same question, whether he died because 20 he did not know that smoking was dangerous to 21 him, especially, and this is critically 22 important, the issue is whether he knew after 23 1982, after 1982. and you just saw, you just 24 saw that the warnings that he was provided all 25 occurred in the 1970s by mrs. banks, by mrs. banks. only one possible answer to those 2 questions related to concealment. 3 may i ask where i'm at on time, your honor? 4 the court: you have about 12 minutes. 5 mr. furr: 12 minutes. would mr. heise be 6 able to give me some of his time? 7 (laughter.) 8 mr. furr: not that i'm pressuring you. 9 mr. heise: just putting me on the spot. 10 the court: i'll give you a little bit more 11 time and i'll give mr. schlesinger a little bit 12 more time on rebuttal to be fair to both sides. 13 mr. furr: thank you. 14 another question, do not know whether you get 15 here or not, obviously no class membership you 16 do not get here. 17 there is a question about allocation of 18 fault, allocation of fault. a few important 19 things to understand. you know, it was 20 suggested to you that at a minimum the tobacco 21 companies' fault should be more than mr. banks'. 22 i guess the argument was that the request to you 23 at least assign the tobacco companies 51 percent 24 and mr. banks only 49 percent. 25 let us talk about what this allocation of fault really is, but this appears at questions 3 2 and 10, 3 and 10 of your verdict form. some 3 very important things to know. 4 baron, could i go back to the projector. 5 this question of fault is not a -- questions 6 3 and 10 are not a generalized comparison of 7 conduct. it is not a comparison of who was 8 better, mr. banks or the tobacco companies. 9 that is not the legal issue before you. this 10 assignment of fault deals with a specific legal 11 concept, and that is, the assignment of fault 12 relates only to actions that were a legal cause 13 of george banks' death, a legal cause of his 14 death. 15 and rj reynolds and philip morris can only 16 be assigned fault for actions -- excuse me, 17 cannot be assigned fault for actions that were 18 not a legal cause of his death. so it is a very 19 narrow focused inquiry. first thing to 20 understand, not a generalized comparison of 21 conduct, has to be conduct that was a cause of 22 the death. 23 second point, it is sort of a natural human 24 inclination to say, okay, well, let us start at 25 50/50 and adjust from there. that is not how it works, because the plaintiffs have the burden of 2 proof. they have already admitted to you that 3 mr. banks was a cause of his own death. your 4 instructions will tell you you have to assign 5 fault to mr. banks if you get to this question. 6 but they have to prove fault by the tobacco 7 companies. the tobacco companies start at zero. 8 they have to prove with evidence every single 9 percentage point of fault that you are going to 10 assign the tobacco companies if you assign them 11 any at all. that is the plaintiff's burden of 12 proof. 13 mr. schlesinger: judge, i object. there is 14 no burden of proof on fault. the engle findings 15 preclude that. that is an incorrect statement 16 of law. 17 the court: ladies and gentlemen, the law is 18 set forth in these instructions, and if the law 19 differs from what the lawyers argue you will 20 follow the instructions as set forth by me. 21 thank you. 22 you may proceed. 23 mr. furr: thank you. 24 please examine the instructions very 25 carefully. please examine them very carefully. they are your roadmap on how to decide this case. 2 let us look at what the evidence shows us. 3 when you compare conduct that was a cause of 4 mr. banks' death, let us look at what the 5 evidence shows you about mr. banks' role. 6 the court: can you show it to them, too, 7 please? 8 mr. furr: sure. 9 there is already an admission that he is the 10 legal cause of his own death. we know from 11 their own experts they have admitted that his -- 12 by the way, that legal cause was due to his 13 failure to quit smoking sooner. that is the 14 plaintiff's admission. 15 mr. schlesinger: judge, i object. your 16 honor, there is no such admission in the case. 17 your honor read the -- 18 the court: all right, mr. schlesinger. 19 ladies and gentlemen, you have been instructed on 20 what the law is in this case. if the lawyers 21 arguments differ from the law, please follow the 22 law as set forth in these instructions. 23 you may proceed, sir. 24 mr. furr: you see that this admission is 25 based on his failure to quit smoking. you also know that daily drinking caused his esophageal 2 cancer, that he knew that smoking was dangerous, 3 every pack of cigarettes that he smoked ever 4 from rj reynolds and philip morris carried that 5 warning, every pack. did he smoke other 6 company's packs before the warning? we do not 7 know. the only evidence is that every pack it 8 appears. 9 what did the defendants do? what evidence 10 did they offer you to connect mr. banks' death 11 to what they did other than selling a legal 12 product that caused his disease and can be 13 addictive which is legal to sell as long as it 14 carries that federally-mandated warning? that is 15 the only evidence you have. 16 they have not linked in any way mr. banks' 17 death to some act by the defendants other than 18 selling cigarettes, which cannot be the basis 19 for liability. 20 his drinking. here's what dr. traube told 21 you about his drinking. "sir, as a physician, 22 you are of the opinion that if a patient drinks 23 it is the patient's choice and the patient is 24 responsible for their drinking, correct? 25 "yes. "sir, today you acknowledge that his 2 consumption of alcohol played a role in the 3 development of mr. banks' esophageal cancer, 4 correct? 5 "answer: yes." 6 could i have the elmo, please. 7 ladies and gentlemen, if you get -- could i 8 have the elmo, please. 9 if you get to this question on 3 and 10, 10 ladies and gentlemen, respectfully, i will 11 suggest to you there is no evidence that the 12 tobacco companies did something wrongfully that 13 was a cause of his death. and if you get to 14 allocating fault the evidence demonstrates that 15 that should be the allocation. 16 if you get to question 10 it is the same 17 analysis. the evidence demonstrates that that, 18 that should be the allocation of fault if you 19 get to these questions. 20 need to talk to you about damages. in case 21 you get to this issue we have got to talk a little 22 bit about damages. first thing to remember is 23 the legal principle you see in your instructions 24 are that any damages must be fair and just in 25 light of the evidence, in light of the evidence. what evidence is relevant to damages in this 2 case? as mr. schlesinger explained to you this 3 morning, it is the nature of the family 4 relationship and what that loss meant, given the 5 nature of the family relationship. and although 6 it was uncomfortable at times and we had to 7 cross-examine yvonne and katrina on what are 8 normally private matters that do not belong in 9 the public, when you come to court and you make 10 a claim for the loss of someone, those issues 11 become something that has to be asked about for 12 the jury so that the jury has the evidence that 13 they need to make decisions. that is why those 14 questions were asked. 15 and mr. schlesinger acknowledged to you this 16 morning that that is a reasonable thing for you 17 to consider when you evaluate damages. 18 so let us remind ourselves of the damage 19 issues in the case. 20 i have to go back to the projector, please. 21 it is important to understand what the two 22 claims are. there is a claim for loss of the 23 relationship for yvonne and katrina. they have 24 separate items and you will see they have 25 separate different instructions, but basically it is for loss of mr. banks, his companionship, 2 protection, guidance, things like that, that is 3 one set of damage claims. 4 the second set of damage claims is for 5 mr. banks' claim for emphysema. and that 6 involves the pain and suffering that they have 7 attempted to claim that mr. banks incurred as a 8 result of his emphysema and their loss as a 9 result of his emphysema. i'll say it first, 10 we will dispense of these emphysema claims 11 quickly. 12 there is no evidence, zero evidence that 13 there were any damages caused by emphysema. as 14 dr. difranza told you, there was no shortness of 15 breath. there was no cough. he probably did not 16 even know he had it. it was incidental. 17 his primary finding on autopsy, he was never 18 treated for it, he was never diagnosed with it 19 during his life. it is a nonevent. 20 if you happen to get there, respectfully 21 there is zero damages either for mr. banks or 22 katrina or yvonne related to emphysema. there is 23 just not anything there. you have not heard a 24 shred of evidence that emphysema affected his 25 life or their lives, none. so let us focus on esophageal cancer. and, 2 again, the only way to do this is to discuss 3 what the evidence was with respect to what their 4 relationship was, because their claim for 5 $500,000, i guess it is now, is based upon their 6 claim that his smoking caused them to lose their 7 relationship. 8 here's what we know. it is important, i 9 think, to bracket that relationship about when 10 it existed and when it did not exist. 11 we know that between 1914 and 1970 12 mrs. banks did not know mr. banks. so he was 57 13 years old before she ever meets him. 14 we know that from the time they met until 15 the time yvonne and katrina moved to miami 16 mr. banks always kept a separate apartment, 17 always kept a separate apartment. 18 we know that from 1983 on for the rest of 19 his life mr. banks always lived alone while they 20 were in miami. and we know that when we 21 cross-examined yvonne and katrina they pretty 22 candidly admit that they saw him two or three 23 times a year for two to three days at a time, 24 and so, you know, somewhere between a few days a 25 year and nine days a year. that was the extent of the relationship for the last 13 years of his 2 life. 3 what else do we know? let us talk about the 4 beginning of the relationship. ms. yvonne told 5 us that she was not sure she wanted to marry 6 mr. banks. she told us that after they got 7 married they kept the marriage a secret. why 8 would they keep the marriage a secret? she also 9 told you he always kept a separate apartment but 10 she told me she does not really remember how 11 often he stayed in his apartment versus how 12 often he stayed with her and katrina. so we 13 asked other people what they knew about the time 14 that mr. banks spent with yvonne and katrina. 15 mr. banks' best friend, diedrich lampe, told you 16 that he never met yvonne banks. how can your 17 best friend never meet your wife? 18 he also told you that he did not stay with 19 her a lot, he did not stay with her a lot. 20 roosevelt hall saw mr. banks between '65 and 21 '77, did not know he was married, never saw him 22 with a woman, said he was always alone. 23 his landlady from 1980 to 1985 did not know 24 he was married, never saw a woman or child go to 25 his apartment. she did say he did not take care of himself and she said he looked and acted like 2 a homeless person. and when asked what she 3 meant by that, she said, he had nowhere to go, 4 he did not have people to go to, he did not have 5 people to go to. neutral witness. no stake in 6 this lawsuit one way or another. no reason to 7 believe she is slanting her testimony in any way. 8 what happened next? well, we know that when 9 it got to 1983 yvonne and katrina left mr. banks 10 in jacksonville and moved to miami. mr. banks 11 was 69 years old, 69 years old. he had been 12 retired since 1975 or '6, so seven or eight 13 years. and we know that they never asked him to 14 move to miami with him. 15 what happened after they got to miami? did 16 they maintain a close, loving relationship? did 17 mrs. banks know the things that a wife knows 18 about her husband if she is in constant 19 communication with him and continues to be 20 involved in a close loving relationship? 21 here's what mrs. banks told us. she did not 22 know who his friends were. 23 she did not know who he spent time with. 24 she did not know that he had a roommate. she 25 did not know how he occupied his time. she did not know that he was a problem drinker. she 2 did not know when he went to the hospital. and 3 she told me that she did not know he had lost 4 weight and he was unable to take care of 5 himself. 6 you have to evaluate what the nature of the 7 relationship reallly was using your common sense 8 and good judgment for a wife not to know those 9 things about her husband, who she described to 10 you all as the love of her life. 11 katrina gave you an explanation as to why 12 they moved to miami and left him in 13 jacksonville. she told you that his life was in 14 jacksonville, odd jobs and friends, that he said 15 he never wanted to come to miami and that he 16 did not like miami, he liked jacksonville. 17 you have to evaluate whether this testimony 18 makes any sense, whether that is really how 19 families work. 20 let me suggest there are more questions in 21 this case than answers about what was actually 22 going on. 23 ask yourself these questions: why would 24 yvonne and katrina leave george in favor of 25 going to stay with her side of the family that they did not know well in yvonne's case or had 2 never met in katrina's case? 3 why would mr. banks stay behind to, quote, 4 work when he was 69 years old and has been 5 retired for seven years? 6 why would yvonne and katrina set up another 7 house in miami when mr. banks had been unable to 8 pay for their house in jacksonville? 9 more questions you might want to ask 10 yourself. why would yvonne move 350 miles away 11 and leave the love of her life to live alone 12 doing odd jobs and yard work? 13 does that make any sense? 14 katrina gave you an explanation that they 15 stayed because she liked school. and you have 16 to ask yourself, why would a 9-year-old girl 17 want to leave her father because she liked the 18 way she was being taught in one school versus 19 the other? 20 and why would mr. banks choose to live as a 21 loner, which is the way mrs. hall and roosevelt 22 hall described him, as a loner in jacksonville 23 instead of joining his wife and daughter in 24 miami? 25 you have to ask yourself those questions as you consider this relationship. 2 but let us look a little bit further and ask 3 yourself what was going on? you saw that when 4 mr. banks was admitted to the hospital in 1990 5 when he fell and broke his hand he was asked to 6 identify the person to be notified in case of 7 emergency. he did not identify yvonne or 8 katrina. he identified his landlady, his 9 landlady. 10 further he was asked, and this document is 11 in evidence, the medical records are in 12 evidence, you can look at them all you want. he 13 was asked to identify the person who should 14 receive his belongings, who should receive his 15 belongings in case something happened to him and 16 he died when he was in hospital. he identified 17 his landlady, not yvonne, not katrina. 18 what was really going on in the 19 relationship? something else happened i think 20 is important for you to consider. you were told 21 about letters from mr. banks to katrina. you are 22 going to have those letters and you can look at 23 them. but there is a couple things that jump out 24 from those letters that you will have to consider 25 what these facts mean with respect to what was going on in mr. banks' life vis-ŕ-vis his life 2 versus yvonne's life. 3 these were letters that katrina got. 4 they are in evidence. when you look at the 5 birthday card you will see that the birthday 6 card is written in a different handwriting than 7 mr. banks'. the one on the right appears to be 8 mr. banks' handwriting. the birthday card is 9 written in a script that appears to be a woman's 10 handwriting. and you will see on that birthday 11 card that, quote, cat sends her love. cat sends 12 her love. 13 in the next letter written by mr. banks 14 you will see ms. kats brother is in miami and 15 maybe you can contact him for something. so the 16 question is, who is this ms. kat that is writing 17 letters for mr. banks and who is sending her 18 love to katrina, sending her love, obviously 19 suggesting an existing relationship where they 20 knew each other, knew of each other and were 21 fond of each other. she is sending her love to 22 katrina 23 and when we asked katrina who she was, 24 katrina told you it did not interest me to know 25 what her full name was, it did not interest me to know what her full name was. 2 you have to sort through these facts and ask 3 yourself what was going on, what was going on 4 here where another woman was writing these 5 letters for mr. banks and sending her love to 6 katrina. 7 just a couple more things on this issue. 8 when mr. banks showed up in the hospital in 9 february of '96, the medical records say he was 10 in awful shape. he was disheveled. he had 11 massive wasting and weight loss, failure to 12 thrive, unable to keep himself. his teeth were 13 almost falling out. that is what the doctors and 14 nurses observed. yvonne told you that she 15 did not know he had lost weight prior to the 16 hospital. katrina told you that she did not 17 remember he lost any weight and she did not 18 remember any problems with dental hygiene. how 19 close were they? how often were they seeing 20 him? what was the nature of the relationship 21 that they would not know these things? 22 let us talk about this weight loss, because 23 katrina told you all that weight loss occurred 24 in the last week of his life. let us look at how 25 much weight loss he actually had and you can evaluate what to do with that testimony. 2 we have a baseline medical record from 3 september 20th, 1990 that shows mr. banks is 4 five eleven, 160. when he goes into the 5 hospital in 1996 you will see that he weighed 6 108 pounds, 108 pounds. a five eleven man, 108 7 pounds? he was emaciated. as the medical 8 records said, he had massive wasting and weight 9 loss. he had a 50 pound weight loss, and you are 10 being told that that happened over the course of 11 a week. 12 what happened further when he went in the 13 hospital? he started in methodist hospital. 14 yvonne and katrina said they came and spent some 15 time with with him. then he was moved to the 16 va, and here's what katrina told us happened in 17 the last two weeks of his life. he was 18 transferred to the lake city va on february 29th 19 and that they spent one night in the va with him 20 and then they both returned to tallahassee, 21 about 100 miles away. keep in mind that katrina 22 was 23, 24 years old at this time. she was in 23 graduate school. why did yvonne have to go back 24 to tallahassee with katrina as opposed to 25 staying with mr. banks? katrina is 23, 24 years old. 2 they told you that they received a call from 3 the hospital on march 12th telling them that 4 they should come soon but that they never went 5 back. bottom line is, you know, i do not want us 6 to go off track. he spent the last two weeks of 7 his life alone in the hospital and died as an 8 81-year-old man who had been left alone and 9 unable to take care of himself and lost 50 10 pounds and showed up five eleven 108 pounds. 11 and they are requesting that you award them 12 $500,000 or more for the loss of mr. banks. 13 the court: you are just over your 14 expiration. 15 mr. furr: yes, sir, thank you very much. 16 i'll finish in 10 minutes or less, if that 17 please the court. 18 the court: go ahead, sir. 19 mr. furr: the last topic i want to go to is 20 this issue of punitive damages. 21 it was really almost all that 22 mr. schlesinger talked about this morning. they 23 told you that mr. banks was a conduit, a conduit 24 that they were using to try to get to punitive 25 damages. the holy grail of punitive damages has been what this case has been about from the 2 plaintiff's perspective from the beginning. 3 that is what the case has been about, that is how 4 it was argued to you. 5 let us look at what the law is on punitive 6 damages. by the way, if you find that he did 7 not die from concealment you never get to 8 punitive damages. you see in your instructions 9 you never get to question 18. but if you do you 10 need to understand what you are really being 11 asked, because in addition to the $500,000 or 12 more that you are being asked to award, you are 13 being asked to award them more money unrelated 14 to any loss. more money, that is what this case 15 has been about. 16 couple important principles to understand. 17 can only be awarded for concealment that was a 18 legal cause of his death. they can only go to 19 yvonne and katrina. they can only go to yvonne 20 and katrina. and that they are in addition to 21 damages that you are being requested to fully 22 compensate them. they want you to fully 23 compensate them and then they want to come back 24 on monday and ask you for more money. that is 25 what this claim is about, pure and simple. because it is such an extraordinary claim 2 you are being asked to give them money unrelated 3 to their losses, more money, even after you have 4 made them whole, if you would happen to do so. 5 as mr. schlesinger told you, the highest 6 possible burden of proof in civil law, clear and 7 convincing evidence. they have to prove to you 8 that they are entitled to punitive damages based 9 upon your review of the evidence without 10 hesitation. 11 on page 26 of your instructions you will see 12 the punitive damages burden of proof, clear and 13 convincing, "in contrast, clear and convincing 14 evidence is evidence that is precise, explicit, 15 lacking in confusion and of such weight that it 16 produces a firm belief or conviction without 17 hesitation about the matter at issue." that is 18 the burden they have taken on to come back here on 19 monday and ask you for more money. 20 and it is only related to concealment. so 21 let us look at what the evidence was. we will go 22 through this quickly. important to remember 23 that the engle findings, you will see in your 24 instructions, cannot be used. 25 mr. schlesinger: objection. the court: overruled. 2 mr. furr: the engle findings cannot be 3 considered in any way. 4 the court: this is all set forth in the 5 legal instruction. 6 mr. schlesinger: it is not in the 7 instruction, your honor. may i approach, 8 please? this is not in the instructions. 9 the court: if it is not in the instructions 10 then the jury will disregard the remarks by 11 counsel. 12 mr. furr: you will see that the engle 13 findings do not establish that yvonne and 14 katrina are entitled to punitive damages. 15 mr. schlesinger: your honor, could we have 16 this corrected so it is not left confused? 17 mr. furr: your honor, please. 18 the court: it is corrected. if it is in the 19 legal instructions, that is what they will follow. 20 if it is not, then they will not follow it. okay, 21 that is corrected. 22 go ahead, sir. 23 mr. furr: this question, should the 24 defendants be punished, should they be punished, 25 based on concealment? a big part of what you were told about at ctr as an arm of concealment. 2 well, there is another side to the story. ctr 3 did some very important work on behalf of the 4 tobacco companies and the plaintiff's witnesses 5 admit it. 6 tobacco companies gave ctr 350 million 7 dollars to fund research. they funded thousands 8 of scientists who wrote thousands of articles. 9 you were told they were distraction research but 10 then dr. proctor admitted over 600 times these 11 surgeon general books that they have read from 12 so many times, over 600 times they cited ctr, 13 ctr-sponsored research. nobel prize winners 14 were sponsored. it was prestigious universities 15 all over the country. 16 dr. cummings told you that when scientists 17 were given ctr money they were given complete 18 scientific freedom. you were shown this article 19 by knapp. it is in evidence. 1963, ctr funded 20 research that concluded that heavy cigarette 21 smokers thus appear to be true addicts, true 22 addicts. 23 tobacco company money. you were told about 24 larson, haag and silvette by dr. cummings. he 25 said he disagreed with some of the conclusions in larson, haag and silvette, but you were told, 2 remember he called it the green monster? he 3 said it was a compilation of all the research 4 that had ever been done funded by ctr money and 5 that it was cited on and relied on, it was cited 6 by and relied on surgeon general 1964 in that 7 famous 1964 report. 8 you heard about premier and eclipse. you are 9 entitled to look at mitigating evidence, that is 10 evidence that goes the other way. mitigating 11 evidence is evidence that suggests that punitive 12 damages are not needed. 13 what did dr. proctor tell you? he told you 14 about two very novel cigarettes that rj reynolds 15 developed called premier and eclipse. he told 16 you they spent a billion dollars, that they were 17 commercial failures because of the poor taste, 18 but he told you they were less carcinogenic 19 cigarettes, less carcinogenic cigarettes. 20 what else can a tobacco company do and stay 21 in business? they can put a warning on the 22 pack. they can try to develop less dangerous 23 products. that is what reynolds did. 24 dr. proctor told you that both philip morris 25 and reynolds tried hard to reduce nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, two 2 categories of chemicals that are thought to be 3 very important with respect to tobacco 4 carcinogenesis. 5 and finally, mitigating evidence, you are 6 being asked to punish them for concealment. are 7 they concealing? 8 this is the only evidence you have of 9 current day. the website that the plaintiffs 10 put into evidence yesterday, rj reynolds' 11 website states: "rj reynolds tobacco company 12 believes that individuals should rely on the 13 conclusions of the u.s. surgeon general, the 14 centers for disease control and other public 15 health officials when making decisions regarding 16 smoking." 17 and to make it easier for people to access 18 that information they actually provide links to 19 surgeon general's report and other public health 20 reports right there so the smoker can click and 21 get the information from the authorities that 22 they have used throughout this trial. 23 ladies and gentlemen, if you get to question 24 18, if you get to question 18, whatever else 25 you have done, i submit the answer to that question should be no, we can all go home, the 2 case is over. if you say yes, we will come back 3 next monday or whenever that day is so that we 4 can have a second phase and more evidence. 5 let me wind up. wind up with three more 6 things. this case is actually pretty simple. 7 you knew everything you needed to know to decide 8 this case before you ever walked in here in some 9 ways. and these things have always been known. 10 let us go back to 1955. dr. hammond, one of 11 the early researchers who was studying -- doing 12 the epidemiology studies and reporting to the 13 public about the danger of smoking, let us look 14 at how smoking has always been viewed throughout 15 time. 16 dr. hammond, 1955. 17 (video clip was played and taken down to the 18 best of the reporter's ability as follows:) 19 voice: in my opinion people should be 20 warned of the dangers and they are being warned. 21 what they then want to do, whether they wish to 22 smoke or not is their own business. 23 (video clip concluded.) 24 mr. furr: people had the information, they 25 get to make their own choice. harry reasoner 1964 when the surgeon 2 general's report was released. 3 (video clip was played and taken down to the 4 best of the reporter's ability as follows:) 5 voice: in this kind of a country it comes 6 down to you whether you like it or not. no one 7 is going to forbid an adult to smoke and it is 8 now quite clear that no one is going to tell him 9 it is good for him either. the decision is his, 10 the decision and the health that may depend on 11 it. 12 (video clip concluded.) 13 mr. furr: people have information, they 14 make their own choices, that is the way it is 15 always been. 16 one final thing to look at. i selected this 17 because i do not think that anyone could ever 18 say it better. dr. koop, we have seen him several 19 times, the surgeon general in 1988, was the 20 surgeon general responsible for the report that 21 concluded that smoking was addictive. as you 22 heard during the cross of dr. proctor, dr. koop 23 maintained a website where he provided advice to 24 smokers about smoking. and here's what dr. koop 25 had to say about smokers 14 years after the 1988 surgeon general's report. 2 "the choice to light up is always yours." 3 "ultimately you are the one that has control 4 over your behavior. the cigarette is not going 5 to light itself and jump into your mouth." 6 this is the surgeon general responsible for 7 the report that found that smoking is addictive. 8 it does not change anything. people still make 9 choices, and in our society we have to take 10 responsibility for those choices. 11 i've talked too long. thank you very much 12 for your attention throughout the trial and 13 today. i appreciate it very much. and i ask 14 you to return a complete verdict in favor of 15 rj reynolds and philip morris. thank you. 21 mr. heise: good afternoon. 22 it is my pleasure to be here finally, have 23 the opportunity to talk with you. i know you 24 all have not forgotten about me sitting over 25 there in the corner, although occasionally sometimes i'm forgotten. 2 you know my name is mark heise. you know i 3 represent philip morris. you know i'm going to 4 be brief and you know if i'm standing up here 5 we are getting towards the end and that is true 6 again today. 7 so about two weeks ago we got together and i 8 told you at that time i was going to give you a 9 preview of the evidence, what we expected based 10 upon discovery and depositions that have taken 11 place. in fact, that is what has happened here. 12 and we went through that evidence carefully. 13 and i've sat here and listened carefully as 14 mr. furr went through the presentation. and to 15 put everyone's mind at ease, i'm not going to 16 repeat what he said. i'm going to do what i've 17 done throughout this trial and that is to focus 18 on additional reasons to find in favor of 19 philip morris. 20 but to be clear, i completely agree with 21 what mr. furr said and what he said applies with 22 equal force to philip morris. 23 and one thing i probably should have said to 24 start this off with is i've been watching and 25 noting that all of you have been taking notes during all of this, paying attention, being 2 diligent, upholding your service as jurors. and 3 as the other lawyers did, i want to thank you 4 because it is an important part of the american 5 fabric and society for the service you are 6 giving. we deeply appreciate that on all sides. 7 as i said, one of the key issues i've 8 focused on throughout this trial, you saw it 9 from my questioning of witnesses, is how long 10 did george banks smoke marlboro cigarettes. 11 and the evidence that came in the trial was 12 exactly how i thought it was going to come in 13 based upon the prior sworn testimony. but there 14 was one instance of evidence that came in that 15 was completely different than what we heard at 16 trial. and because of that difference i need to 17 take a few moments to walk through with you the 18 evidence that we got before trial and the 19 evidence that you heard here today. because i 20 think it will put in focus for you the 21 additional reason why philip morris is not 22 liable in this case. 23 what i did is i prepared a brief timeline 24 here to highlight for you the evidence. 25 this is before trial you know on february 17th, 2012 ms. banks swore under oath when she 2 answered interrogatories. and i had it on a 3 flip chart, but i put it on the big screen here. 4 those are the five brands of cigarettes that she 5 put down in her answers to interrogatories. 6 camels, chesterfield, lucky strike, pall mall 7 and bugler. 8 as you see, chesterfield was the go-to brand 9 whenever camels were out. and you heard that 10 chesterfield is no longer in this case, because 11 they are a small company and they are just suing 12 the two big companies. 13 you also see on this list bugler. what you 14 do not see is marlboro, one of the most popular 15 brands, a brand somebody would not forget. and 16 what i think is important, and mr. furr 17 emphasized this, is that these are the sworn 18 answers given before ms. banks got sick and 19 before her memory failed. this is what she knew 20 at a time when she was feeling well and did not 21 have any memory issues. 22 these five brands, and as you know, i've 23 said it every time i've stood up, none of them 24 are marlboro. 25 you know from the testimony you heard on the witness stand that she went to a lawyer's 2 office, sat there, looked over, she wrote out 3 her answers and had them typed up. and you 4 heard on the witness stand when she got these 5 she had all the time in the world to answer 6 them. it is not a situation like this where 7 you have got people looking at you and you feel a 8 little stressed and you are hurrying through 9 them. she had whatever time she needed. she 10 made sure to look over them very carefully as 11 she testified. 12 "and after the answers were typed up, you 13 looked at them very carefully to make sure they 14 were accurate? 15 "right." 16 and then importantly for your purposes the 17 last question and answer. 18 "and you knew it was important to give 19 complete and accurate information when you gave 20 those written answers, right? 21 "that is right." 22 so that is what she knew at that time and 23 there was never once a supplemental to these 24 answers in writing, not once. 25 then continuing on, what happened before trial ms. banks' deposition was taken. and in 2 that situation, because you heard a lot of her 3 deposition testimony because it was read to her 4 to remind her what she said, these two things 5 were told by her at her deposition. 6 on page 205, "and how long did he try the 7 marlboros?" 8 and this is when defense lawyers were asking 9 her questions. 10 "he tried it a while, tried it. he tried it 11 a while and went back. i do not know. and went 12 back to chesterfield and camels, chesterfield 13 and camels. but camel was his main brand. 14 "did i read that correctly? 15 "i guess you did. 16 "i see. okay. 17 "no problem. 18 "tried it for a little while." 19 then when her own lawyer was asking her 20 questions at the deposition as you can see she 21 was asked by her own lawyers asking about this 22 for a little while. 23 "do you know if he smoked these marlboros 24 for a little while, more than a week? your 25 lawyer asked you questions. "more than a week, yes. 2 "do you know if it was more or less than two 3 weeks? 4 "it was about two weeks that he smoked 5 them." 6 so that is what i told you the evidence would 7 be and that is what she said. 8 as you know we took the deposition of 9 katrina banks as well. and what did she tell 10 you at deposition? you heard three different 11 portions of her deposition were read to you when 12 she testified. all three times she said, when 13 the store was out of camel he would get marlboro 14 or pall mall. pall mall of course is another 15 unfiltered brand. 16 so when the store was out of camel that is 17 when he would try the marlboro or the pall mall. 18 you have to think about that, how often is a 19 store going to be out of one of the leading 20 selling brands of cigarettes, the camel 21 cigarettes? that is like a store running out of 22 pepsi or coke. it is not something that happens 23 all the time. 24 and of course she never mentioned his go-to 25 brand, the chesterfields, in her deposition. she mentioned these other brands including 2 marlboro. 3 so then you heard -- we took the deposition 4 of dr. difranza and i explained to you in the 5 opening what i expected his testimony to be 6 based upon his review of the entire record, all 7 the medical records, all of the depositions, not 8 just the three excerpts where ms. katrina banks 9 said he only did it when the store was out of 10 camel. he read her entire deposition, he read 11 all of yvonne banks deposition, he concluded it 12 was as little as one week, perhaps up to two 13 months. and that was the state of the record 14 when we got here to trial. 15 so what happens when we get to trial? 16 this is before we get here and here is when 17 we get here. we know the written answers to 18 interrogatories did not change. those are the 19 only five brands listed under oath in writing. 20 dr. difranza came in based, again, on his 21 whole review of everything and he says one week 22 to two months. and, specifically, what i want 23 to alert you to is he told us, "you read the 24 daughter katrina's deposition, right? 25 "right. "and from there, based on your review of 2 everything you gave yourself as little as a week 3 or as much as two months." 4 so he said exactly what we expected him to 5 say because that was the state of the record. 6 then of course we all know dr. traube came 7 in and told everybody in the courtroom five 8 years is not enough smoking. and i'm going to 9 talk about that in more detail in a minute. 10 then you heard yvonne banks go on the 11 witness stand. and really it did not change much 12 of what she said. i had to remind her of what 13 she said before, before she had the memory 14 problems. and she agreed that he tried them for 15 two weeks then he went back to the camels and 16 the chesterfields, so that stayed the same. 17 but the one thing that changed was katrina 18 banks' testimony. for the first time ever we 19 hear that mr. banks smoked marlboro for a very 20 long time. now, why would somebody do that? we 21 all know why. because dr. traube said five pack 22 years is not enough. five years of smoking a 23 pack a day of cigarettes is not enough to cause 24 esophageal cancer, it is not enough to cause 25 emphysema or copd. so when all the testimony was it was a week or two weeks or two months, 2 that was the end of it for marlboros. but 3 suddenly we got this new statement that it was 4 for a very long period, almost 20 years. 5 she had the opportunity to correct anything 6 that she said was wrong in her deposition. you 7 saw the errata sheet that the doctor had filled 8 out. he was very careful to review his 9 deposition. there was no such errata sheet. 10 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor. 11 the court: legal basis. 12 mr. schlesinger: cannot comment -- not in 13 evidence. 14 the court: sustained. 15 you can only refer to things that are in 16 evidence, sir. 17 mr. heise: so what did katrina banks tell 18 us? 19 she now remembers for the first time ever 20 that when she is two or three years old she is got 21 this distinct memory of her father smoking 22 marlboros. she remembers that almost 40 years 23 later. and she said that he smoked marlboros 24 all the way through 1992. that is four years 25 after mr. banks himself said he stopped smoking, because we saw the medical records. 2 mr. banks told his doctors, i stopped 3 smoking two years ago in 1988, but she happens 4 to now in this court remember for the first time 5 ever he smoked it until 1992. that is also four 6 years after their very own expert said, 7 plaintiff's expert, his conclusion that he 8 stopped smoking in 1988. 9 so one of the instructions you are going to 10 be given in this case is you have to determine 11 credibility. who is it that you believe? and 12 you are asked by the court to follow this 13 instruction and to look, does the witness have 14 any interest in the outcome of the case? are 15 they looking for money? do they have the means 16 and the opportunity to know the facts? do they 17 live in the same city? is their testimony 18 reasonable? is it reasonable that somebody 19 could remember 40 years ago when they were two 20 years old what their father smoked, what brand? 21 is it reasonable to go from no marlboros, based 22 on the answers to interrogatories, to almost 20 23 years of smoking marlboros? 24 you have to decide what is believable and 25 what is not. when you do, you will be presented with the verdict form. you are going to be asked 2 to go through all 18 questions. you will be asked 3 to go through them in order. you do not start 4 with 18, you start with 1. 5 and mr. furr went through very carefully 6 questions 1 and 2 about class membership, that is 7 where he put the three xs because there is three 8 independent reasons why you should answer no to 9 all those questions. i do not have anything to 10 add to what mr. furr said other than to again 11 remind you that we agree with what he said and 12 that it applies equally to philip morris as it 13 does to reynolds. 14 so the next question, and it is actually 15 questions 3 and 10 on the verdict form. you will 16 see question 3 and there is a similar one for 17 question 10, it talks about the percentage of 18 fault that was a legal cause of george banks' 19 esophageal cancer and death and number 10 talks 20 about emphysema. but it is the exact same 21 question. 22 mr. furr outlined for you why it is that 23 mr. banks is one hundred percent responsible and that 24 the other two are zero percent. but i suggest 25 to you there is an additional reason as to philip morris why philip morris has to be zero 2 percent. and that is the medical testimony that 3 you heard in this case. 4 the doctors came in and they told you what 5 you probably knew from your common sense, that 6 smoking two weeks of any cigarette is not enough 7 to cause disease, but the amount of marlboro 8 cigarettes that mr. banks smoked is not the 9 legal cause of any of his injuries. and that is 10 why this question is divided up between 11 philip morris, reynolds and george banks. so 12 that is an additional reason why you would put a 13 zero for philip morris. 14 and what i would put up -- it is probably the 15 only time in history this has ever been done. 16 i'm going to put up my entire cross-examination 17 of dr. traube, their expert. 18 baron, can you flip it back, please. thank 19 you. 20 this is my entire cross-examination. i 21 asked him two questions. 22 "you would agree that if someone smoked a 23 pack a day for five years or less that is not 24 enough smoking to cause esophageal cancer, 25 right? "correct. 2 "and, likewise, if someone smokes a pack a 3 day for five years or less, that is not enough to 4 cause copd or emphysema?" 5 he says what you already knew. there is no 6 evidence that he smoked more than a week, two 7 weeks or two months. there is certainly no 8 credible evidence that he smoked a pack a day of 9 marlboros for five years or more than five 10 years. because their other doctor, 11 dr. difranza, said it takes much more than five 12 years. and that is an additional reason why 13 philip morris would be zero percent. 14 mr. furr went over the other portions of the 15 verdict form, the concealment and the agreement 16 to conceal. again, i'm not going to belabor the 17 same points he did. everything applies to 18 philip morris, but i will make two additional 19 points, one is there is a jury instruction that is 20 important for your consideration on this. 21 baron, if i could have the elmo, please. 22 and this jury instruction is the legal 23 product instruction. and what it says is, "the 24 manufacture, advertisement and sale of 25 cigarettes are lawful activities, therefore, i," the court, "instructs you that defendants cannot 2 be held liable merely for manufacturing, selling 3 or advertising cigarettes." 4 why do i bring that to you? because what 5 have you been told george banks saw? you were 6 told there was some marlboro ad sometime in the 7 1970s or '80s that nobody can identify whether 8 it was in a magazine or a billboard or any of 9 that. but that is all you have been given with one 10 other important fact. that ad wherever it was 11 had the surgeon general's warning on it. but 12 this is an additional reason why philip morris 13 is not responsible under the agreement to 14 conceal or the concealment is because all you have 15 been pointed to is this advertisement for 16 marlboro. 17 and he is tried the marlboro for two weeks 18 and then he went back to what he wanted. he 19 did not like them. it is not the legal cause of 20 any of his injuries under these claims for 21 concealment or an agreement to conceal. 22 and so then you have the question of 23 damages. mr. furr covered that at length. i'm 24 not going to get into that any further. but 25 then it concludes with punitive damages. and i want to make an observation here. as i said, i 2 agree with mr. furr, but what mr. schlesinger 3 told you in opening is exactly what happened 4 again in closing. he told you that this is 5 about a generic smoker. this case is not about 6 a generic smoker, it is about george banks. and 7 that is important when you are considering the 8 evidence and when you are looking at answering 9 these questions, particularly this issue of 10 punitive damages. 11 because, as you were instructed by the 12 court, for punitive damages, "punitive damages 13 are warranted against a defendant if you find by 14 clear and convincing," that heightened standard, 15 "that the defendant was guilty of intentional 16 misconduct which was a substantial cause of 17 mr. banks' injuries and death." 18 so what is the first thing you heard about 19 today? menthol. you know from the evidence in 20 this case george banks never tried a menthol 21 cigarette in his life, but they spend their 22 first 5 or 10 minutes talking about menthol. it 23 has to be intentional misconduct which was a 24 substantial cause of mr. banks' injury. and on 25 that score all you have heard about is this marlboro ad. advertisement is not intentional 2 misconduct, it is trying to get people to buy 3 your product. as you saw from the jury 4 instruction, advertising is entirely legal and 5 we cannot be held responsible or liable for 6 that. 7 the other thing you heard a lot from the -- 8 mr. schlesinger on was the nicotine, that that is 9 the evil in the cigarettes. and remember when 10 dr. proctor was on the stand one of the 11 questions i asked him was to tell this jury, 12 philip morris tried to get nicotine out of 13 tobacco. they bought the company sanka that 14 took the caffeine out of coffee beans. and they 15 thought, what a great idea, we can take the 16 nicotine out of tobacco. and they marketed 17 that. they put it in stores. they tried to 18 sell it and nobody bought it. it was a big 19 flop. they made the effort to do exactly what 20 is being suggested here, that is not conduct 21 that should be punished in any way or any form. 22 so let me say it is been about two weeks and 23 about the length of time that mr. banks smoked 24 the marlboro cigarettes. it was not enough to 25 cause him any disease. it is not enough for him to be a member of this class. ask you to fill 2 out the verdict form as mr. furr went through it 3 with you and find in favor of philip morris and 4 rj reynolds on all counts, but in particular for 5 the reasons that i outlined for you with 6 philip morris. 7 and i will end where i started by thanking 8 you very much for your service. i do appreciate 9 all the time and attention you have given all of 10 us. thank you very much.
