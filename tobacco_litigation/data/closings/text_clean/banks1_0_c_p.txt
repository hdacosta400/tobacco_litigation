5 mr. schlesinger: may it please the 6 court, counsel, ladies and gentlemen of the 7 jury. thank you. 8 so we are a little bit ahead of schedule. 9 this was a long trial by general standards. 10 some of us have been in shorter ones and much 11 longer ones. some of you -- 12 i cannot even remember, quite frankly, if 13 any of you have ever been a juror before that 14 deliberated to verdict; but today you will have 15 that opportunity. 16 and as i told you at the beginning of 17 this case, this is an important case. it 18 involves serious matters. and i'm kind of -- 19 i'm going to try to address them with the 20 respect, dignity and gravity that i think they 21 deserve. 22 i want to cite to you a simple rule that 23 i think is an overarching theme that should 24 carry through, a principle to help us 25 understand some of this. and what i would say is that a 2 manufacturer is never allowed to needlessly 3 endanger the public. and if they do, and, as a 4 result, somebody is hurt, the manufacturer is 5 responsible for the harm. 6 if the manufacturer does this wrongful 7 conduct on purpose and intentionally, then such 8 conduct warrants sanctions and penalties by a 9 jury of that company's peers. 10 a manufacturer is never allowed to 11 conceal a danger they would -- they know about 12 in their product, because concealing dangers 13 needlessly endanger the public. a general 14 principle. 15 and let us talk about the story of this 16 case a little bit comprehensively. one of the 17 jury instructions that you will hear is that a 18 company is entitled to be treated with the 19 rights of a person. 20 and that is fair, because, in this 21 country, we try to treat all -- all people and 22 fictional corporate entities as equal under the 23 law; but when you have the rights of a person, 24 you also have the obligations of a person. 25 and i told you what this case was going to be about, and i'm going to come back to the 2 theme of what this case is about. 3 this case is about an opportunity, 4 through george banks and his family, a smoker, 5 who was clearly a class member by every 6 definition of the word -- and i will get into 7 that -- to express, as part of our community, 8 moral condemnation -- 9 mr. furr: objection, your honor. 10 mr. schlesinger: -- to a company -- 11 mr. furr: objection, your honor. 12 the court: the objection's overruled. 13 go ahead, mr. schlesinger. 14 mr. furr: i make a motion, your honor. 15 the court: your motion's denied, sir. 16 overruled. 17 mr. schlesinger: the punishment, the 18 nature of punishment, the nature of a fine, 19 this is the tool that we have at our disposal 20 in what is known as a quasi-criminal context. 21 this case is not the beginning. it is 22 far along. this matter has been going on for 23 decades. we are at a point in time here where 24 we have moved very far through a process, all 25 established by the findings of the prior engle jury. 2 you are an engle progeny jury. you are 3 the children of engle. and you have the right, 4 the responsibility, the obligation and the 5 duty, as his honor will instruct you, to take 6 the findings, the supreme court-approved fault 7 findings, against the wrongful conduct of 8 this -- of these companies. 9 and they are represented here by the 10 attorneys. and they may be nice guys, but they 11 are not r.j. reynolds and they are not philip 12 morris. 13 they can call any witness they want. 14 they did not call a corporate representative 15 from the company. you did not hear anybody -- 16 mr. heise: objection, your honor. 17 mr. schlesinger: they -- 18 mr. heise: objection. 19 the court: overruled. 20 mr. schlesinger: they -- 21 you are entitled to hear from whoever 22 witnesses you want. 23 you heard from the family that are 24 survivors of george banks. you are also 25 entitled to hear from a corporate representative, a corporate executive, to come 2 down -- 3 mr. heise: objection, your honor. this 4 is part of a motion in limine pretrial. 5 the court: the objection's overruled. 6 go ahead, sir. 7 mr. schlesinger: and -- and you are 8 entitled to hear from them and look them in the 9 eye and hear what they have to say about this. 10 but here's what we know. and this is 11 without a doubt. and i ask you, embrace these 12 findings, because some of the -- some of the 13 ways to look at it is you have found these 14 findings yourself. you embrace them as if 15 they -- you found them yourselves. 16 and his honor will say they are the law, 17 you must apply them, you have no choice. and 18 that is fine, but they are also true. they are 19 facts, they are law. 20 this is an industry represented here by 21 the two biggest manufacturers, r.j. reynolds 22 and philip morris, who are culpable for, at 23 fault, right now, for fraud, conspiracy, 24 marketing and selling and -- 25 mr. heise: objection. this is misstating the law. 2 the court: okay. again, ladies and 3 gentlemen, the instructions are as i read them. 4 if the lawyers say something contrary to the 5 instructions, always follow the instructions. 6 you may proceed, sir. 7 mr. schlesinger: fraud, defrauding the 8 american public as to the known dangers -- 9 "fraud" means being dishonest on purpose. 10 "conspiracy," to gather together with all of 11 the other members of their -- of their 12 industry, including the center for tobacco 13 research and the tobacco industry research 14 council, that mr. heimann changed the name of 15 so it would sound less industry friendly, and 16 the tobacco institute. and the traveling truth 17 squad. and the college of tobacco knowledge. 18 those entities, the ctr, the ti, the 19 tirc, all of the major manufacturers, including 20 all of those gobbled up by rjr -- brown & 21 williamson, american tobacco company -- they 22 are all culpable in a conspiracy to deny the 23 truth about the health effects of tobacco, to 24 sustain their business over the rights and the 25 safety of their customers. that is a starting point. and that is why i say -- 2 and i will show you how to get to where 3 we want to be, because we have come so far. we 4 have come so far, because we are at a point 5 where fault has been established. we will show 6 how it applies to one smoker -- 7 mr. furr: objection, your honor. that is 8 a misstatement of the law, your honor. 9 the court: all right. again, ladies and 10 gentlemen, the legal instructions as -- as -- 11 they are as how i read them, okay? 12 if the lawyers say something that 13 conflicts with the legal instructions, always 14 follow the legal instructions. 15 go ahead, mr. schlesinger. 16 mr. schlesinger: yes. 17 fault findings have been established. we 18 will show how a single smoker, george banks, a 19 little man, not a -- not a giant man, somebody 20 that you could squash under the foot of a 21 corporate entity, we are going to talk about 22 him, and i'm going to empower you, because 23 today you have power. 24 the power you have today is more power 25 than you may ever hold again in your life; and especially with george banks, and especially 2 with some of the things they said about him and 3 the picture they tried to portray of this 4 gentleman. 5 and i will acknowledge the weaknesses, 6 but the picture they portrayed of this 7 gentleman -- 8 what a powerful message. what a powerful 9 voice from a jury it will be if you say to this 10 company, you cannot do this, not even to george 11 banks, not even to the weak and the vulnerable 12 and the post -- the folks that are most easily 13 preyed upon. 14 mr. furr: your honor, i object to this. 15 the court: i sustain the objection. 16 ladies and gentlemen, that is not an issue 17 in this case, and i sustain the objection. 18 mr. furr: i move for a motion -- 19 i make a motion, your honor. 20 the court: your motion's denied. 21 it is improper argument -- 22 mr. schlesinger: in -- 23 the court: -- so disregard the comments. 24 keep going, mr. schlesinger. 25 mr. schlesinger: i apologize, judge. in an era where a gentleman was born in 2 1914, and his life parallelled the existence, 3 the implementation and the initiation of a 4 product that came to define the 20th century, 5 the cigarette century, that was epidemic 6 proportions of deaths caused by a product that 7 was deadly and dangerous, known to be so, 8 discovered by people like claude teague in the 9 '50s; and rather than make the right choice, 10 the moral choice, the decent choice, the human 11 choice, they lost their way. their moral 12 compass did not direct them in the right 13 direction. they went off the rails. 14 they said, our clients are dying. too 15 bad. we are making money. 16 they did not care. 17 we will lie. we will lie to the american 18 public, we will deceive, we will give people an 19 illusion of safety with filters, we will 20 provide them with a psychological crutch to 21 keep smoking, we will undermine everything 22 about what it is that we will need to do to 23 keep our business rolling. that is -- 24 that is what the proofs of the engle 25 findings establish. that is where we are when we have come this far. and i say to you that -- 2 if you remember the iwo jima memorial, 3 the famous picture taken when the men were 4 raising the flag in iwo jima, in world war ii, 5 and they were raising the flag, they had fought 6 a battle against overwhelming odds, and a flag 7 was partially raised; and the symbol there is 8 freedom and achieving monumental victory over 9 great odds. 10 and what is the point of this? the 11 symbolism is we are pushing the flag up, but 12 it is not all the way up. 13 and what i suggest to you is, today, in 14 part, you get to be the people that finalize 15 planting that flag in a vertical position to 16 say, we validate these engle findings. we 17 apply them to the banks family, to the loss of 18 this one man, this generic smoker, he who is 19 typical of so many of the people that happen to 20 be in the state of florida that are this engle 21 progeny. 22 1913, the camel was invented, 1914. 23 1914, 100 years ago. we are talking about a day 24 of reckoning. we are talking about an 25 accounting for past misdeeds. that is why we are here. that is why this is important. 2 we are going back in time. we are looking 3 at corporate conduct that set the -- the sad 4 standard for corporate misbehavior in our 5 country for a century; and when you punish 6 them, you are punishing them not only for 7 george banks, but for the harm they did to 8 others -- 9 mr. furr: objection, your honor. 10 mr. schlesinger: -- and you are -- 11 mr. furr: your honor, that is a flat 12 misstatement of the law. 13 the court: ladies and gentlemen, i 14 explained that in the jury instructions. if my 15 jury instructions differ from the lawyers' 16 statements, you will always follow the jury 17 instructions. 18 mr. furr: and i move for a motion based 19 on that. i make a motion. 20 the court: denied, sir. 21 proceed, mr. schlesinger. 22 mr. schlesinger: you will hear the 23 instruction. you are allowed to learn about 24 reprehensibility. 25 reprehensibility has to do with harm to -- entitlement -- not -- 2 excuse me. i lost -- i lose my train of 3 thought. i'll get back on track. 4 look, the law is going to show you very 5 simply -- 6 question 8, put question 8 up, please. 7 this is the question i want you to know. this 8 is where we are going. this is the goal that 9 i'm trying to show you how to get there. i'm 10 going to show you the roadmap of how to get 11 there. 12 and the question is going to be: under 13 the circumstances, are punitive damages 14 warranted? 15 and all of the evidence of what we call 16 reprehensibility, wrongfulness, indecent 17 behavior, amoral conduct, these things all are 18 driven by the actions of the tobacco companies 19 over the decades, through the conspiracy, 20 through the fraud, through the selling of an 21 unreasonably dangerous, defective, addictive 22 product, far more dangerous than it needs to 23 be, that captures people, constrains their 24 choice -- 25 mr. furr: excuse me, your honor. your honor, i object. punitive damages are not 2 available for selling a defective product. 3 the court: overruled. 4 mr. furr: it is a misstatement of law. 5 the court: the law is set out in the 6 legal instructions. 7 ladies and gentlemen, you will follow those 8 legal instructions as i've instructed you. 9 you may proceed, sir. 10 mr. schlesinger: for the harm to george 11 banks and others. twenty million people have 12 died. we are going to talk about that. 13 look here, you will see. this is the 14 question. it is question 18, not 8, because we 15 have a lot of questions. 16 but this is the question: state whether 17 by -- you find by clear and convincing evidence 18 that punitive damages are warranted against 19 each defendant under the circumstances of this 20 case. philip morris, "yes"; r.j. reynolds 21 tobacco company, "yes." 22 and then we have to come back monday. 23 and that is all i want. i want you to -- 24 i want to try to stitch together why we 25 have to be here on monday, because you are going to check those boxes off "yes," and we can 2 resolve the matter of punitive damages in an 3 amount that you think will be appropriate to 4 punish them for the harm they have done to george 5 banks and others, and to -- 6 mr. furr: objection, your honor. 7 mr. schlesinger: -- deter -- 8 mr. furr: punitive damages are not 9 available for harm -- 10 the court: overruled. 11 mr. furr: -- to others. 12 the court: overruled. 13 you will follow the legal instructions, 14 ladies and gentlemen. 15 mr. schlesinger: -- and to deter future 16 conduct. 17 j.r.r. tolkien, the fellowship of the 18 ring, said that even the smallest person can 19 change the course of the future. 20 i notice j.r.r. is just a rearrangement 21 of rjr, like reynolds. 22 but even the smallest person can change 23 the course of the future. and that is the kind 24 of thing i want you to be thinking about as we 25 go through this, because i say this is a day of reckoning, a chance to make an accounting for 2 past misdeeds, for a man whose life parallelled 3 the rise of the camel cigarette. 4 it was inevitable that their lives would 5 be intertwined. he fell into a use of a 6 product that was dangerous during a period of 7 time where nobody knew, nobody understood it. 8 they -- 9 there was no common knowledge amongst the 10 public before the '60s. it was not appreciated 11 how dangerous it was. and folks by the 12 millions, the majority of americans, the 13 majority of american men, smoked. they 14 believed it was fine. doctors were smoking and 15 telling you -- 16 they were using doctors in 17 advertisements. it is a man from a different 18 era. you must place that into context so you 19 recognize no matter how it came to be that an 20 official public pronouncement finally, in the 21 '60s, let folks know this is causing cancer, 22 however well that was disseminated, and however 23 well it was countered by the tobacco companies 24 to confuse them and the folks going forward as 25 to the dangers, that confusion campaign went on for decades. 2 but prior to the '60s, george banks 3 smoked in at least the '30s, maybe even the 4 '20s, but at least the '30s, '40s, '50s and 5 '60s, for decades. 6 and you know the adolescent brain -- you 7 heard evidence that most people smoke in 8 adolescence. you heard evidence that george 9 started in adolescence. most people are 10 addicted in adolescence. it is an addiction of 11 youth. children -- not -- 12 young people who -- young -- 13 mr. furr: objection, your honor. 14 mr. schlesinger: i -- i misspoke, and i 15 changed it. 16 mr. heise: we filed a motion -- 17 mr. schlesinger: young people, youth -- 18 the court: overruled. 19 mr. schlesinger: -- do not know what 20 they are getting themselves into. their 21 frontal lobes are not -- are not well 22 established. they do not know what the future 23 holds. they cannot make important, long-range 24 planning decisions. 25 all the statistics we heard are, people that are young, that start smoking cigarettes, 2 they do not think they are going to be smoking in 3 five years. 4 and it is the pediatric brain, so -- so 5 exquisitely sensitive to the -- to the 6 application of nicotine that is what starts the 7 process. and nicotine addiction is not a free 8 choice, and we will talk about that. the -- 9 this question, you need to figure out how 10 to get there, and we need to show you the 11 evidence that gets you there. so let us -- 12 let us start doing that now. 13 i want to show you some of the -- some of 14 the documents that are pertinent to this, 15 because you had not seen some of the original 16 documents. you have not seen some of these 17 documents. 18 i want to start with tamol, and then i 19 want to go to crop, okay? i'm going to -- 20 there is a lot of documents in evidence 21 that are internal documents. they talk about 22 such things as, we know we are a highly 23 stylized segment of the pharmaceutical 24 industry. 25 now they are under the fda. that is the food and drug administration. 2 we know that they are selling an 3 addictive drug, and nothing else. they say, 4 do not think of the cigarette as the product; 5 the cigarette is but a package. the product is 6 the nicotine in the smoke. that is what they 7 knew since the '60s. 8 they said, moreover, nicotine is 9 addictive. they knew that. they said it had 10 unattractive side effects. they said that we 11 are in the business of selling nicotine; and if 12 we did not have nicotine, our entire industry 13 would collapse. 14 now, human beings, decent human beings -- 15 like robert fulghum's book, everything i 16 needed to learn, i learned in kindergarten, is, 17 you know, tell people you are sorry if you do 18 something wrong; do not -- do not be -- you know, 19 be decent to people. do not hurt people. 20 and no matter how you cut it, no matter 21 what you want to say about my client, george 22 banks, his human imperfections, no matter how 23 you cut it, what they did was on purpose; and 24 at the end of this, i say to you, no matter 25 what they say to run him down or blame that victim, i say that george banks was better than 2 they were. 3 he was a better man than they were. 4 everything about him was decent. there is 5 nothing in this record other than a character 6 attack on alcohol use, which is irrelevant to 7 whether or not he is a member of the class. 8 it says all floridians and their 9 survivors, and these are the survivors; and she 10 is a survivor hanging on just to see this case 11 through. 12 and i'm so thankful that judge tuter gave 13 us the opportunity to bring this case forward 14 and get this case done, because what you heard 15 from her is a dying declaration. and that is a 16 rare thing to hear in a courtroom. 17 mr. heise: objection, your honor. 18 mr. schlesinger: and the -- 19 the court: mr. schlesinger, stick to the 20 evidence, please. 21 mr. schlesinger: and the one thing she 22 held on to and said was her vision of the 23 central truth in this case: my husband was 24 addicted. 25 the records are irrefutable. the man smoked for a minimum of 50 years. you can read 2 the records any way you want, but do not allow 3 folks to apply shifting justification to how it 4 is that you make a determination of what the 5 evidence should be. 6 you want to keep it fair on both sides? 7 what did george banks see, what did not he see? 8 use the same -- use the same rules. 9 you heard cross-examination of 10 dr. proctor. it was in the reader's digest. 11 george banks did not read the reader's 12 digest. 13 george banks must have known about all of 14 these dangers. 15 they did not put anything into his hands. 16 they want to suggest things were in his hands. 17 then they say, george banks did not see 18 our advertisements. we have no proof that 19 anyone saw those advertisements. this goes 20 back a hundred years. even roosevelt hall said 21 it was everywhere. 22 the federal trade commission, in 1981, 23 said it is immersive, it is saturation 24 advertising. nobody can avoid advertising. 25 so, all of these things, use the same justification. use the same basis of 2 consideration. the record is very clear. the 3 record is clear, the man was a long-term 4 smoker. so what -- 5 of what distraction value, of what 6 confusion value, of what doubt-raising value is 7 it that some other folks that barely knew him, 8 that saw him in a -- in a landlady role, or 9 whatever, did not see him smoke? 10 nobody's denying that he smoked. that is 11 not an issue in the case. he was a smoker. 12 now, let us look here. dr. tamol -- 13 this record is in evidence. you have not 14 seen it yet because we showed it -- we showed 15 it -- 16 it is in evidence, but we did not use it 17 with dr. proctor. 18 and we are always trying to go really 19 fast, and i'm going to try to shoot this stuff 20 at you, and you will get what you can out of it, 21 as best i can. 22 but dr. tamol is a philip morris 23 researcher, and he was looking into the concept 24 of a health cigarette. 25 in the '70s, when they had the filter fraud going, the phony filters that were the 2 illusion of filtration, and the phony 3 color-changing dye to make people think that 4 something was coming out of the filter, as the 5 health reassurance campaign, as part of the 6 fraud and the conspiracy, to falsify the truth 7 to the american public so they would keep 8 smoking, the psychological crutch to give our 9 addicted smokers a rationale to keep smoking, 10 what was dr. tamol doing? 11 one thing they were really concerned 12 about were making these light cigarettes. 13 we are beating that machine that tests them 14 because we know that people will smoke to get 15 the nicotine, because that is the determinant 16 of smoking, the sine qua non -- without which 17 there is nothing -- according to dr. teague. 18 without cigarette -- 19 without nicotine, nobody has ever become 20 a smoker. my client would have never smoked 50 21 years or more, or 60 years. even in '96, in 22 february, there is a note saying he was smoking 23 greater than a pack a day. so that there is 24 evidence from which you can reasonably say that 25 what the family came up with was they thought he kept smoking. 2 now, he may have relapsed, he started 3 smoking again. the '96 record corroborates it. 4 but for purposes of as far as we need to get, 5 50 years of smoking a pack a day is enough to 6 give you esophageal cancer. there is no doubt 7 about it. 8 we brought a world's expert that is 9 written chapters and books and taught on it for 10 a lifetime. they brought nobody. they could 11 have brought anyone they wanted. they did not 12 rebut it. it is not an issue in dispute. it is 13 a definitive fact, unrebutted. 14 they did not get him to retreat in his 15 opinion. and dr. traube was right on the money 16 as a legitimate, qualified expert, bringing 17 true science that you can rely on. 18 what did dr. tamol say after he was 19 figuring out how can we put out a health 20 cigarette, make people think they are healthy? 21 what is the crucial thing we have to do? we 22 have to determine the minimum nicotine required 23 to keep the normal smoker hooked. 24 the next one about the crop. 25 the minimum amount to keep the normal smoker hooked. meaning, no matter what we do, 2 the essential ingredient is nicotine; we have got 3 to make sure we do not go below a minimum level 4 where the smoker cannot be hooked. 5 nobody chooses addiction. my client did 6 not choose to be addicted. he smoked as a 7 young man, and he became addicted as a young 8 man, in a world where it was perfectly 9 appropriate. and when it came time for 10 information to get out there, he was already 11 hooked. he was addicted. 12 dr. difranza said, in no uncertain 13 terms -- dr. difranza, the real expert -- the 14 man was addicted. his brain was permanently 15 altered, as is all addicts' brains. that is 16 just the harsh reality and truth of this. 17 so here, this is philip morris, dunn to 18 wakeham. this is an article that came -- a 19 paper, internal, secret documents. we never 20 would have seen them. we are learning from 21 them; we will learn from them for decades. 22 they are the internal industry admissions 23 of that which they denied to the public so they 24 could sustain profits and earn money in the 25 billions for decades. and they have succeeded. and they continue, to this day, selling a 2 product that they say is organic. 3 now, in our current society, what does 4 "organic" confer? health. that is health 5 reassurance. 6 even today, right now, on the shelves at 7 the -- at the drugstores, you can buy american 8 spirit cigarettes: one hundred percent additive-free, 9 menthol. 10 is that deceptive and unfair trade 11 practices? is that honest? selling a health 12 cigarette with menthol? 13 and we showed you -- 14 mr. furr: your honor, i object. this is 15 inflammatory. it has nothing to do with this 16 case. 17 the court: i sustain the objection. 18 mr. schlesinger: we -- we showed you the 19 2013 scientific conclusion by the food and drug 20 administration, that -- that the cigarettes, 21 even today, are more addictive than ever. 22 that is in the surgeon general's report. right 23 in the beginning of the surgeon general's 24 report, the way they are made and processed and 25 grown, they are more addictive than ever today. they are not a leaf rolled up in a field 2 like some natural crop. they are highly 3 processed. they are full of chemicals like 4 ammonia, and they are made and designed to 5 deliver nicotine in the fastest, most addictive 6 form. crack nicotine, freebase nicotine. 7 menthol, according to the food and drug 8 administration, right now, under consideration 9 for removal to help and benefit the public 10 today, despite the fact that more people are 11 dying now than even 50 years ago. 12 mr. furr: your honor, i object. this 13 is -- 14 mr. schlesinger: there is -- 15 mr. furr: -- improper inflammatory 16 argument. it has nothing to do with this case. 17 the court: ladies and gentlemen, again, 18 you will confine the arguments to the evidence in 19 the case. 20 you may proceed, sir. 21 mr. schlesinger: please the court. 22 menthol -- 23 we read it to you, we showed it to you. 24 menthol is a chemical additive that makes 25 cigarettes more addictive, initiates youth into smoking, and -- and nicotine addiction, and 2 makes it harder to quit, representing one-third 3 of the market right now. and it cools the 4 throat as an anesthetic to get that first puff 5 down, because the basis of the business is the 6 adolescent smoker. they are the replacement 7 smokers. 8 now, these are cynical and these are 9 comments that disregard humanity and the 10 reasonableness we expect from people. they 11 lost their moral compass. profit motive made 12 folks go off their moral compass. 13 it is a terrible tragedy in this country 14 that is been going on for decades. we have got 15 the goods on them now because of these internal 16 documents. and six people at a time, drafted 17 to learn about it, get to know something that 18 they did not know. 19 and when you were a member of 60 people 20 back there, in a big group, and we asked 21 everybody to raise their hand about who thinks 22 they know something about smoking, many of you 23 said, i thought i knew, i think i know. 24 well, we live in a culture they created. 25 we have been immersed in cigarette advertising and all the things they have said, the denials 2 they have said all these years. 3 but here's something: the elton john 4 song, mona lisas and mad hatters. it starts 5 out "i thought i knew, but now i know." 6 the rest of the line is "rose trees never 7 grow in new york city. it is a great song. but 8 it starts out, "i thought i knew, but now i 9 know." 10 i hope that as you go through these 11 documents with me, that now you know. now you 12 know really how we got to where we got in this 13 tobacco epidemic, in this country, in a most 14 inappropriate way. this is -- 15 when you lose 20 million americans, it is 16 an atrocity. it is not acceptable under any 17 set of circumstances. there is no consumer 18 product in the united states, there is no 19 consumer product in the history of the world, 20 that kills over half of its users. 21 and what does it look like? it looks 22 like a normal -- a normal product. how can you 23 tell? here's a pack of cigarettes. here's a 24 pack of cigarettes. here's a pack of gum. it 25 looks normal. it hides in plain sight. it does not look like there is anything terrible. 2 here's a pack of playing cards. 3 everything -- 4 it looks the same. the color schemes are 5 the same. it does not look deadly, dangerous. 6 it does not have a skull and crossbones. 7 liggett finally put "smoking is 8 addictive" on the label, but you do not see that 9 on any of these products now. they could have 10 voluntarily did it. they took it off. 11 mr. heise: objection, preemption. 12 the court: ladies and gentlemen, i gave 13 you an instruction about the warning labels. 14 you will follow the instructions i gave you. 15 you may continue, sir. 16 mr. schlesinger: right here. in 1964, 17 they were concerned about the surgeon general's 18 report coming out and what would the impact be. 19 they were worried about their business. 20 they would always describe themselves in 21 human terms: the health of their business, the 22 prosperity of their business. will they have 23 replacement smokers, because the population 24 must continue to give birth. this is how they 25 refer to themselves, in human terms. now, i say they have no soul, but they 2 have a survival instinct. 3 mr. furr: objection, your honor, that is 4 just an -- 5 the court: sir, sir. 6 mr. furr: -- inflammatory -- 7 the court: you can not make personal 8 comments. you can comment on the evidence. 9 that is a personal comment. 10 ladies and gentlemen, you will disregard 11 the comment from the attorney. 12 mr. furr: i make a motion on the 13 cumulative effect of all these improper 14 arguments. 15 the court: all right. your motion's 16 denied, sir. 17 mr. schlesinger: the tobacco company has 18 a survival instinct. i'll prove that to you. 19 now, right here, this document came 20 out -- 21 i'm trying to go through it real quick 22 with you. this was in 19 -- in 1965, after the 23 1964 surgeon general's report came out. and 24 they were trying to figure out what is going to 25 happen to our business. they were worried they were really going 2 to have a deceleration of business. and it did 3 knock the business down for a little while. it 4 did go down for a little while, but then they 5 also compared it to an english experience, and 6 they said, you know what? it was not that bad. 7 as a matter of fact, the first punch -- 8 meaning, the '64 surgeon general's report -- 9 was by no means as lethal as it first appeared. 10 they are talking about lethality to them. 11 they are referring to themselves 12 anthropomorphically, in human terms, but here's 13 how they refer to their customers. and you 14 already heard how they described them like rats 15 in a cage. 16 and when you stop being able to see your 17 customers as people, and merely as something 18 that you can consume, just like your customers 19 consume cigarettes, you lose your moral 20 compass, you lose your way. you do something 21 that is indecent and inexcusable, wrongful, on 22 purpose, intentional, and justifying in this 23 setting because you have been entitled to say so, 24 an expression of moral condemnation from you 25 that says -- mr. furr: i object, your honor. 2 mr. schlesinger: -- we want you to -- 3 mr. furr: that is an improper -- 4 please do not talk over my objection, sir. 5 your honor, that is an improper argument. 6 the court: mr. schlesinger, stick to the 7 legal instructions. 8 ladies and gentlemen, you will be guided 9 by the legal instructions. 10 please go ahead, sir. 11 mr. schlesinger: now -- 12 mr. furr: and, your honor, could he be 13 cautioned not to talk over my objections -- 14 mr. schlesinger: i did not talk over his 15 objection, your honor. 16 mr. furr: -- so i do not have to raise my 17 voice? 18 the court: all right. when he makes an 19 objection, please stop, mr. schlesinger. 20 go ahead. 21 mr. schlesinger: here it says, there is a 22 backlog of youth who have refrained from taking 23 up smoking in the face of the report. a 24 substantial number of these can be expected to 25 join with this year's crop of prospects to produce a healthy increase in the number of new 2 smokers. 3 so the youth that slowed down because of 4 the warning, they were really -- they were 5 really satisfied that, despite this backlog of 6 youth, they could be expected to join with this 7 year's crop -- "a crop" -- of prospects to 8 produce a healthy increase in the number of new 9 smokers. 10 again, you are referring to people, youth, 11 that are going to become addicted, that are 12 going to be lifelong smokers, that are going to 13 deny -- that are going to die, and you are going 14 to replace them as replacement smokers with 15 more youth? 16 that -- that does not meet with the bounds 17 of human decency, just plain and simple. 18 the next one we will go to -- 19 i want to go to the instruction for 20 punitive damages, please. 21 now, you have to realize, this is an 22 industrially created epidemic. and what do i 23 mean by that? 24 this is not a disease that is being 25 eradicated because it is polio or malaria, that we have a pill. there is a powerful industry. 2 and you heard dr. proctor talk about the 3 overwhelming power of this industry, and how it 4 invaded every part of society. this is a 5 powerful industry that is driving, driving with 6 all of its might and all of its force, the 7 perpetuation of this epidemic. 8 now, when -- 9 this is the highest standard of proof, 10 the highest burden of proof we have to prove to 11 you that punishment is warranted for people who 12 document, the smartest people, the brightest 13 people: the claude teagues, the princeton 14 graduates, the people that should be curing 15 cancer, not causing cancer; the people that 16 should be protecting youth, not addicting 17 youth; the people that should not have doubt as 18 their product. 19 how different would our world have been 20 if, in 1953, when they knew full well and when 21 dr. teague knew full well it was causing 22 cancer, and in the early '60s, when they knew 23 indisputably it was causing cancer -- 24 and you cannot wrap your mind around it, 25 but imagine if they had come out and said, oh, my god, oh, my god, mass marketing -- mass 2 production led to mass marketing, led to mass 3 addiction, and now we, as a responsible titan 4 of industry, captains of industry, the folks 5 that are -- that are the most high echelon in 6 the country, would have said, we have to stop, 7 we have to take our responsibility, we cannot 8 make this product, we cannot make the product, 9 but instead, what did they make? 10 they made mass hypnosis. and they said, 11 we are going to hire public relations people, 12 and we are going to take responsibility to make 13 it safe or get out of the business. 14 well, you know why i want to talk about 15 did george banks rely? if they had got out of 16 the business, there would not be cigarettes in 17 the '50s, and george banks would have lived the 18 rest of his years -- 19 mr. furr: objection, preemption. your 20 honor, move for mistrial. 21 mr. schlesinger: -- that he was entitled 22 to have. 23 the court: ladies and gentlemen, that is 24 not a proper argument. please follow the jury 25 instructions as i instructed you. i sustain the objection. 2 mr. heise: we would move, as well, your 3 honor. 4 the court: the motion for mistrial is 5 denied. 6 mr. schlesinger: this is the -- this is 7 the -- 8 evidence that is precise, explicit, 9 lacking in confusion and of such weight that it 10 produces a firm belief or conviction, without 11 hesitation, about the matter in issue. 12 there is no doubt about the doubt. their 13 product was doubt. they sold it, they relied 14 on it. it worked. they studied it. they knew 15 that the filters were getting people to 16 continue to smoke. 17 they knew that making uncertainty in the 18 minds of people, particularly those dependent 19 on drugs, would undermine their ability to 20 continue -- to quit smoking and they would 21 continue. 22 there is no doubt about the doubt. the 23 doubt is part of the conspiracy, it is part of 24 the engle findings; and so this burden of proof 25 is the burden of proof that allows you to say, the evidence is clear, it is explicit, we are not 2 confused by it, there is no confusion -- 3 there was a confusion campaign by 4 tobacco, but here, you have the right to 5 determine from the evidence that you were not 6 confused. you have the right to determine that 7 it is clear. 8 and with that high standard of proof, you 9 have the right to determine that punishment is 10 warranted, and that these folks should be 11 punished for what they did. 12 so let us go to a couple of the documents. 13 let us go to the pt03615 -- this board. 14 (discussion off the record between counsel.) 15 mr. schlesinger: i do not know. it 16 does not have a number on it. just put one up. 17 so this is the truth about their 18 business. this is the internal truth about the 19 chemical compound, nicotine. 20 the cigarette market would collapse, 21 philip morris would collapse, and we would all 22 lose our jobs and our consulting fees. 23 and then they talked about -- and this is 24 claude teague again -- we can never be 25 comfortable selling a product which most of our customers would stop using if they could. that 2 is to say, if the exit gate from our market 3 would suddenly open, we could be out of 4 business overnight. that is -- 5 nicotine addiction is their business, and 6 that is the -- that is the basis of their 7 business. 8 i would like to show you that there was 9 no doubt that they knew that cigarettes were 10 carcinogenic. these are all their internal 11 documents. 12 and way back in the '60s -- you have seen 13 this, this is in evidence -- carcinogens are 14 found in practically every class of compounds 15 of smoke. obviously, the evidence accumulated 16 to indict cigarette smoke as a health hazard is 17 overwhelming. the evidence challenging such an 18 indictment is -- "such an," it is a 19 misspelling -- is scant. 20 and then another one here: cigarettes 21 have certain unattractive side effects. they 22 cause lung cancer. and yet the men that 23 promised to stop making it, the men that 24 promised to take this out -- these materials 25 out were not saying that because they truthfully wanted to take any of the stuff out 2 that was bad, or that they would stop making 3 it. they never intended to do that. it was 4 their way of reassuring the public that, in 5 fact, they could keep smoking. and sure -- 6 sure enough, they did. 7 now, this is in evidence, the major 8 conclusions from the surgeon general's report. 9 and i'm going to refer to it real quickly. 10 and you heard about how -- you heard 11 about -- yesterday with dr. hoge -- 12 and i'm only going to speak about him for 13 a minute, because there is an instruction -- 14 yeah, we will come to that. 15 we got this up, let us do this real quick. 16 these are the major conclusions. this is 17 surgeon general, 2014, and this just came out. 18 here, find the major conclusions and i'll 19 read it. i'll read it. 20 all right. thanks -- thanks, jon. 21 all right. so, this is 2014, 50 years 22 after the surgeon general's report came out in 23 1964, the first surgeon general's -- 24 and i will show you the 1915 surgeon 25 general, because i put that into evidence. one of the things that happened in 2 opening statement was i told you that when they 3 delayed incorporating the term "addiction" in 4 the '60s, in the first surgeon general's 5 report -- remember i told you about that? -- 6 and that they delayed by 25 years public 7 knowledge that nicotine was addictive, and it 8 was not until surgeon general koop put it in the 9 report in 1988, that it became widely 10 publicized even though that conclusion was 11 attacked and called -- was denigrated by 12 tobacco, tobacco delayed, by decades, the 13 recognition by the public and the public health 14 authority of the fact that nicotine was 15 addictive even though internally they said, we 16 possess a knowledge of nicotine far greater 17 than any other public health scientists. 18 they knew it was addicted -- addictive, 19 they delayed the recognition of it for decades, 20 and it did not appear as addictive in a surgeon 21 general's report until 1988. 22 what year did george banks quit? 1988, 23 right? we have evidence two years before 1990, 24 he quit in 1988. knowledge is out there, 25 information is out there. george banks was aware of the 1964 report because everybody was 2 aware of the 1964 report. 3 how about george banks was aware of the 4 1988 finding that nicotine addiction was now 5 something that the public health officials and 6 the famous dr. koop said it is addictive? and 7 that played a role in why he quit. 8 that is reliance. that shows had they 9 have told him sooner, had they have shown him 10 earlier, he would have had a chance to quit 11 earlier, he would have had a chance to live and 12 not die when he did from esophageal cancer, and 13 had additional life expectancy. 14 they did not tell him that they were 15 hiding the truth about addiction. they did not 16 tell him that they were foisting lies and 17 conspiratorial deceit on health reassurance to 18 make people think filters would be better -- 19 and he smoked filters -- or that -- that you 20 did not have to worry about it, time is on your 21 side, it is still an open question. 22 they had a traveling truth squad. it was 23 a traveling hit squad. all they did was run 24 around and lie. and it is like a negative 25 campaign. they are liars -- mr. heise: objection, your honor, 2 inflammatory rhetoric about squads. 3 the court: again, sir, stick to the 4 evidence, please. 5 mr. schlesinger: they are telling lies. 6 what do you do to your opponent? call 7 him a liar. they are raising doubt and 8 confusion. 9 what do you do to your opponent? he is 10 raising doubt and confusion. but the fact is, 11 is we know, in 1988, that is when the surgeon 12 general said "addiction." 13 and i'll show you. i put into evidence 14 the 1915 surgeon general's report, because in 15 the beginning, in opening statement, mr. furr, 16 a fine lawyer, a powerful advocate for his 17 client, i take nothing away from him, but he is 18 not r.j. reynolds, but he got up and said, 19 after i made an opening -- 20 and, you know, we talked about ego 21 yesterday with this fine dr. hoge, we talked 22 about him -- 23 you know, look, everybody's got an ego. 24 i got an ego. but sometimes when you have an 25 ego, it reminds you to do something. and i say there was confusion. 2 i -- i said: tobacco was not determined 3 to be addictive by the public surgeon until 4 1988, and it was delayed for decades, and -- 5 and i believe -- it does not matter what i 6 believe -- and the evidence supports that 7 contention, but mr. furr got up and referred to 8 what i said in opening statement. 9 and he said: mr. schlesinger said that 10 the surgeon general of the united states did 11 not announce tobacco to be addictive until 12 1988, and then there was a pause, and in the 13 transcript -- and i can show it to you -- 14 there is one word, a single declarative 15 utterance from mr. furr: false. 16 and that got my ego, because i'm saying 17 to myself, mr. furr is saying i said something 18 false, and he is saying it to you, i am being 19 false. 20 so, i looked carefully, i looked very 21 closely. 22 you may have to put that up. 23 and we have in evidence the surgeon 24 general's 1915 report, and it does not say 25 anything about a warning of smoking being addictive. it does not say it. that was a 2 false statement. the surgeon general of the 3 united states did not make that statement at 4 that time. 5 here's what they did: and i say there is 6 a little bit of something here that you should 7 consider as to whether or not it is completely 8 candid and forthright. because they also said 9 my client died alone, and i'm going to address 10 that. i'm going to address that, as well. 11 but here it says: warnings about the 12 addictiveness of cigarettes, 1915. surgeon 13 general report, 1915. dr. blue is the surgeon 14 general in 1915. 15 and then it is got a quote over here, 16 "smoking is addictive." and the -- the 17 implication was, as early as 1915, when my 18 client was two years old -- 19 and there is no reason to think he ever 20 saw it; but if everything that is out there is 21 seen by everybody -- no implication he saw 22 it -- it says, smoking is addictive, and then 23 there is a document here that they point to. 24 well, that document is not the surgeon 25 general's report. that document is a public health bulletin. it was the garment workers 2 district that asked the surgeon general to 3 study diseases in the garment workers, and some 4 other doctor named simenewski (phonetic) did a 5 report, and there is -- 6 the word "addiction" appears in the 7 report, and it does not say smoking is 8 addictive. the word in the report, which i 9 do not even know if this report is even in 10 evidence, said that pipe tobacco and cigarette 11 smoking are smoked by the garment workers in 12 these dusty factories, in these relative 13 amounts, and most of it is cigarette smoking, 14 and it said, smoke -- cigarette smoking was the 15 most popular form of tobacco addiction. 16 it was a descriptive term of something in 17 a document that is not the surgeon general's 18 report. it did not say smoking is addictive; it 19 said that of three kinds of smoking in 1915, 20 the cigarette smoking was, quote, the most 21 popular form of tobacco addiction. 22 and through the power of crunching and 23 reading and extracting, they found a word in a 24 document and they turned it into this: a board 25 they showed you that they said was -- that the surgeon general report says smoking is 2 addictive and, therefore, there was a warning. 3 none of that is true. 4 and i put in the actual 1915 report. you 5 cannot find the word "addiction" in there, 6 because it is not in there, except having 7 something to do with morphine. there is nothing 8 in there about cigarettes. 9 now, we are talking about the health 10 warning the surgeon general put -- now let us go 11 back to the -- we are talking about the warning 12 the surgeon generals made when smoking and 13 health became a public health issue with john 14 f. kennedy in the '60s, and has gone on for 50 15 years since then. 16 this is an irrelevancy, but it is also 17 not a legitimate and -- and honorable way to 18 truly tell you what is going on. it is 19 confusing, it is misleading, it raises doubt 20 that you should not have. 21 mr. furr: your honor, i object to the 22 personal attacks by counsel. 23 the court: overruled. 24 mr. schlesinger: now, the major 25 conclusions -- one of the things i've got to tell you, 2 one of the things is, we do not know how much 3 evidence you need. you know, they used to have 4 a little tv show, the gong show, when somebody 5 could finally come out, hit the gong, and 6 they are like, that is it, stop. 7 you guys do not have that button. so, in 8 an abundance of caution, we sometimes go too 9 far. maybe you could have gotten some of this 10 in a week -- we are saving a week -- because i 11 want you to come back on monday, but we have 12 saved a week. 13 so here are the major conclusions: this 14 is hot off the press. this is brand new. this 15 is available to any member of the public. it 16 was announced at the white house. dr. proctor 17 was there. 18 proctor, cummings, difranza -- the 19 leaders, the titans in the public health battle 20 against the scourge of cigarette disease and 21 death in this country -- we brought you 22 witnesses from the surgeon general's report. 23 we brought you legitimate titans in the 24 industry, and they wanted to talk about the 25 money they earned. all in, the money they earned in this 2 case was less than what dr. hoge earned in this 3 one case. they did not earn 70,000 together. 4 traube -- 5 traube and -- and proctor and difranza, 6 together, their billing, when you heard it, it 7 did not add up to the 70,000 of an unqualified 8 expert, who you have the right -- and i'll show 9 you the instruction -- to reject his opinions. 10 i told you, you have great power. this 11 is the most power you will ever have in your life 12 for some of you, and it is a -- it is the 13 greatest act a citizen can perform. this is a 14 serious business. 15 and the judge lets the witness testify, 16 because he also tells you, you have heard what a 17 technical opinion is by an expert. these guys 18 are like, you go, we will figure out where you are 19 going and we will follow you and put it on. 20 the court: that is your 45-minute 21 warning. 22 mr. schlesinger: yes. thank you, judge. 23 (discussion off the record between counsel.) 24 mr. schlesinger: yeah, i know. 25 so it says here: you have heard opinion testimony from persons referred to as expert 2 witnesses. you may give it such weight as you 3 think it deserves. but here's the key: you 4 may reject it, considering the knowledge, 5 skill, experience and training of the witness. 6 i do not want to spend a lot of time with 7 dr. hoge. you saw him yesterday. it came out 8 the way it came out. if it took too long to do 9 it, like i said, we do not know how much 10 information you need. 11 my point is this: you can reject him. 12 so dr. hoge, a bowling ball, and you roll him 13 right down the lane and out of that courtroom, 14 you reject his opinion, because it serves no 15 beneficial opinion to finding the truth and the 16 justice in this case. none. 17 however, this is what you should look at, 18 as well: the century-long epidemic -- 19 remember, dr. hoge did not know what that was -- 20 the century-long epidemic of cigarette smoking 21 has caused an enormous avoidable public health 22 tragedy. since the first surgeon general's 23 report in 1964, more than 20 million premature 24 deaths can be attributed to cigarette smoking. 25 next, number 2: the tobacco epidemic was initiated and has been sustained by the 2 aggressive strategies of the tobacco industry 3 which has deliberately misled the public on the 4 risks of smoking cigarettes. 5 now, that is a portentous statement, 6 because the surgeon general, they are not in 7 the business of public relations and 8 advertising to make money on a deadly and 9 lethal product. 10 they are in the business of carefully 11 reviewing legitimate scientific evidence, not 12 false evidence, not evidence planted by people 13 into the halls of the ama and harvard and the 14 dsm, where even dr. hoge, we know, a consultant 15 for tobacco, is now writing how the document 16 should be used for forensic purposes. 17 that is scary, because they tried with the 18 dsm-iii; they are still doing it today. the 19 evidence came from the witness stand by 20 dr. hoge's own admission. he did not make the 21 right choice. he should have disqualified 22 himself from that committee, and he admitted it 23 and he did not, and he also admitted nicotine 24 played a role in this gentleman's cigarette 25 smoking. nobody smokes 50 years for pleasure, 2 taste, satisfaction. that is just -- that is 3 nonsensical statements to sell a product, to 4 show health and sports figures and glamorous 5 celebrities. 6 and philip morris says: you smoke, and 7 something wonderful happens. 8 remember that video? something wonderful 9 happens. 10 yeah, it is wonderful. you get emphysema, 11 you get esophageal cancer, your body is 12 wracked, eaten alive, you decompensate and you 13 die. there is nothing wonderful about it. 14 the tobacco epidemic was initiated and 15 has been sustained by the aggressive strategies 16 of the tobacco industry, which has deliberately 17 misled the public on the risks of smoking. 18 and that goes right along with the 19 findings in engle. they concealed and omitted 20 material information not otherwise known to the 21 public, with the intent that people would rely. 22 and the reliance comes from the fact that 23 saturation advertising was immersive. they 24 did not tell them the truth. 25 and in the '80s, when they finally did in 1988, is not it an interesting coincidence and 2 cannot we tie together that that is when he quit 3 smoking? 4 let us go back to the -- 5 go to number 6 -- go to number 9. 6 let us take a second here. i want you to 7 think about this: i want you to think about 8 this because -- 9 i'll tell you why after i tell you, 10 because i've got to tell you in the right way 11 for it to have the kind of impact that i think 12 it is going to have. i think it is clever. 13 maybe that is because it is absurd. 14 the court: mr. schlesinger, please make 15 arguments. 16 mr. schlesinger: yes. i'm sorry, judge. 17 we are floridians, but we are also 18 americans. we live in the state of florida, a 19 beautiful state. some of us were born and 20 raised here. 21 now, i want you to think about this 22 image. conjure this image up in your mind. 23 you go out on i-95 and you start driving north 24 and there are not any cars. no cars. and when 25 you pass the gas stations, there is no gas stations. and if you stop in a strip mall, 2 there is nobody there. and if you go to your 3 friends' homes, they are not there. and if you 4 go to a church, or a school, or a courthouse, 5 or a hospital, there is nobody there. 6 and then you go to the populated parts of 7 the coast, and you go to palm beach, and you go 8 to jacksonville, and you go to tallahassee, and 9 you go down to tampa. and everywhere you 10 drive, there is skyscrapers, the lights are not 11 on and there is nobody there. it is the middle 12 of a beautiful day. there is nobody there. not 13 a single soul. 14 then you go to the central part of the 15 state. you say, i'm going to go up on the lake 16 wales ridge, and i'm going to drive up and down 17 sebring. and i'm going to go out to hardee 18 county, and i'm going to go look in zolfo 19 springs. and i'm going to go to the farmlands 20 in the state of florida. there is nobody there. 21 i'm going to go down to the keys. i'm 22 going to drive down to islamorada and duck key. 23 i'm going to go to marathon, i'm going to stop 24 in key west, and i'm going to look for 25 somebody. there is nobody there. not a single solitary soul in the entire state of florida. 2 no traffic jams. no -- no fire trucks, no 3 firemen, no policemen. nothing, nobody, empty. 4 the state of florida like it was when 5 panthers roamed the beaches. imagine that. 6 not a single, solitary soul in the state of 7 florida. that is 20 million people. that is the 8 population of the state of florida. 9 so if you want to think about -- 10 mr. heise: objection, your honor. this 11 is talking about -- 12 mr. schlesinger: if you -- 13 mr. heise: -- state farm/williams, harm 14 to others. 15 the court: overruled. 16 mr. schlesinger: if you want to think 17 about and put it into terms where -- 18 because here's my concern: numbers numb. 19 numbers numb. we throw out a term and it has 20 no meaning, because it is so big, it is 21 incomprehensible to the average person. 22 we know of tragedies that have occurred 23 in our recent memory that have taken lives of 24 folks, and we know how important they are, and 25 i will not invoke them here, because i will not degrade the memory of those things, but you can 2 think of them, but i -- 3 mr. furr: objection, your honor. this 4 is an improper argument, your honor. 5 the court: mr. schlesinger, please stick 6 to the evidence. 7 mr. schlesinger: yes. 8 the court: none of this is in evidence. 9 mr. schlesinger: twenty -- 10 go back up there. the first number, the 11 first one. 12 twenty million people are dead. that is 13 harm to others. i wanted to try to give you a 14 way of thinking about it in terms that 15 expresses the enormity of the harm. 16 they were all parts of somebody's family. 17 somebody cared about them, and they cared about 18 somebody. a parent, a mother, a husband, a 19 father, an aunty, an uncle, a grandparent. 20 mr. furr: objection, your honor. this 21 is improper argument. 22 the court: sustained. this is not 23 proper. this case is about george banks, 24 ladies and gentlemen, as it is set forth in the 25 instructions. this is improper argument. i sustain the objection, so disregard -- 2 mr. furr: your honor, i make a motion. 3 the court: so disregard the remarks. 4 the motion for mistrial is denied. 5 go ahead, mr. schlesinger. 6 mr. schlesinger: now to the last one, to 7 that -- to number 9. 8 this is the current posture in our 9 current environment. and it says that the 10 burden of death and disease from tobacco use in 11 the united states is overwhelmingly caused by 12 cigarettes and other combusted tobacco 13 products. rapid elimination of their use will 14 dramatically reduce this burden. 15 let us go to my -- take the first -- the 16 concurring cause instruction, then the 17 pictograph, please. 18 so this is the legal cause instruction. 19 and you are going to hear it, you heard it read; 20 and it says blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 21 let us go to the next one. 22 let me show you what it means. this is 23 what the concurring cause instruction means. 24 mr. furr: your honor, i object to this 25 board. please take it down. 2 mr. schlesinger: i've used this before, 3 judge. 4 the court: take it down until i see what 5 the objection is. 6 what is the objection, sir? 7 mr. furr: it is inflammatory. i do not 8 know if you saw it, your honor. 9 mr. schlesinger: it is not inflammatory. 10 the court: hand me the slide, please. 11 mr. schlesinger: pardon me? 12 the court: hand me the slide, please. 13 mr. furr: prejudicial, inflammatory. 14 mr. schlesinger: it is my way of 15 explaining what i think the instruction means, 16 your honor. 17 the court: okay. well, you cannot use 18 these -- 19 you can use the demonstrative, sir, but 20 not with those headstones on there. it is not 21 proper, it is inflammatory. so i sustain the 22 objection on that. if you want to use it some 23 other way, you can do that. 24 mr. schlesinger: all right. thank you, 25 judge. all right. put up the instruction. 2 i wanted to give you a visual way of 3 understanding this instruction. 4 the point is this: when you get to the 5 first question on the verdict form, which is 6 whether or not this gentleman was a class 7 member, which you will eventually get to, 8 that is -- 9 you know, i'm trying to plot the way for 10 you to get to the question about punishment 11 damages. all of the other questions are based 12 upon reasonable degrees of probability, what is 13 more likely than not. and we talked about 14 there is no doubt about the doubt. 15 in these questions, george banks gets the 16 benefit of the doubt, because the law says, 17 more likely than not, what is reasonable in 18 terms of what really happened. 19 the unrefuted evidence is he died of 20 esophageal cancer caused by smoking, but there 21 could very well have been a contributing cause 22 by alcohol. 23 and so what i wanted to show was that in 24 order to be regarded as a legal cause of 25 esophageal cancer and death, cigarette smoking need not be the only cause. cigarette smoking 2 may be a legal cause of esophageal cancer and 3 death even though it acts in combination with 4 alcoholic beverages like beer or whiskey -- 5 the court: you can use that slide. you 6 can use that slide in that way. 7 mr. schlesinger: thank you. 8 in order to be regarded as a legal cause 9 of esophageal cancer and death, the cigarettes 10 need not be the only cause. 11 the cigarettes may be a legal cause of 12 esophageal cancer and death, even though it 13 operates in combination with alcohol -- i put a 14 beer up there. it could have been whiskey, 15 beer, what have you. the man drank, there is no 16 doubt about that -- if such beer, if such 17 alcohol, occurs at the same time as the 18 cigarettes and the cigarettes contributes 19 substantially to producing esophageal cancer 20 and death. and they did. 21 and if he smoked a pack a day for 50 22 years, the minimum amount that, in the most 23 conservative analysis of the evidence in this 24 case, that nobody smokes without addiction, he 25 died of the disease that the engle class says is caused by esophageal cancer, and dr. traube 2 said it was caused by esophageal cancer, and so 3 did dr. difranza, and he said the man was 4 definitively addicted, which is dependent -- 5 and do not forget this: dependence to 6 nicotine does not have to be the only cause. 7 just like this: dependence to nicotine, which 8 is physiological dependence and everything that 9 goes with it, that incredibly hard drug to 10 quit, 20 million people have died, it kills 11 over half of its users, just because you are 12 addicted to the drug, and maybe some quit, or 13 he could have quit, and he did quit, it does not 14 mean he was not dependent to some extent all 15 those years that he was smoking. 16 so it is not an absolute. he could have 17 been dependent and he could have enjoyed 18 smoking, even though the enjoyment of smoking 19 is driven by nicotine. 20 relaxation by smoking is driven by the 21 fact that, as yvonne said, when that nicotine 22 dies down in him, he needed to replenish it, 23 because withdrawal symptoms, shakes, things 24 like that, are signs of nicotine withdrawal, 25 and a lot of the relaxing effects of nicotine are because people are taking the drug to 2 relieve the withdrawal symptoms. 3 however, as long as nicotine -- you can 4 put up the question on the verdict form for 5 class membership, but put up the class 6 membership slide first -- as long as that 7 nicotine was an important cause, a substantial 8 contributing cause to why he smoked; and nobody 9 smokes a pack a day for 50 years -- 10 they say themselves: without nicotine, 11 there is no smoking. that is their internal 12 document from the '60s. without nicotine, 13 there is no smoking. they say that themselves. 14 that pack minimum, pack a day for 50 15 years, it could have been as much as a pack and 16 a half or more, because he said greater than a 17 pack a day, for 60 years; but, in any event, it 18 was enough to kill him. it did kill him by 19 esophageal cancer. addiction drove it. 20 and the simple statement i told you from 21 that song by the fixx, one thing leads to the 22 other: smoking defective, addictive cigarettes 23 that are unreasonably dangerous, one thing 24 leads to the other. 25 the nicotine leads to smoking, smoking leads to millions of inhalations of toxic, 2 poisonous, cancer-causing chemicals, that leads 3 to esophageal cancer. and, in his case, 4 emphysema, permanent injury to his lungs, and 5 death. 6 you will see a series of questions about 7 emphysema. you are going to be able to probably 8 skip over all of those when you are comfortable 9 with the idea that the smoking was a 10 substantial contributing cause to his -- his 11 esophageal cancer. 12 but the emphysema questions are there if 13 for some reason you decide that in no way did 14 the smoking have any substantial role or 15 significant role in causing his -- his 16 esophageal cancer. 17 there is no evidence to that effect, but 18 the way the law is set up, the judge has a 19 series of questions there; and there is 20 absolutely no doubt the emphysema was caused by 21 smoking, and so you would have to answer those 22 questions, but only if you -- if you did not 23 find that he was killed by the esophageal 24 cancer caused by the smoking. 25 and the evidence is so strong in that regard, we have enough confidence that that 2 will not be an issue, that we are not going to 3 spend time on those series of questions. 4 follow the instructions carefully. it is 5 a lot of like choosing from a menu. if you do 6 1, then do 2; if you do not do 2, go do 3. 7 there is no way in the world you can 8 understand it when the judge is reading to 9 it -- reading it to you, because you have got to 10 look at it yourself. when you read it 11 yourself, if you read it really carefully, 12 you will understand it and you will follow it. 13 but question 1 is, very simply, the -- 14 can you put up -- can you also put up the 15 definition of the engle class? 16 we will go to this, we will go back. 17 was -- 18 there. 19 all florida citizens and residents and 20 their survivors who have suffered, presently 21 suffer, who have died from diseases and medical 22 conditions caused by their addiction to 23 cigarettes that contain nicotine. 24 now the board about -- 25 (discussion off the record between counsel.) mr. schlesinger: go to that one. 2 so that is the engle class definition. 3 that is the law. all florida residents and 4 their survivors. 5 he was a florida resident, he smoked a 6 lot of cigarettes, he died of a 7 cigarette-related disease under engle, it was 8 addictive, it was unreasonably dangerous and 9 defective. they conspired and defrauded the 10 truth for decades, expecting folks to rely. 11 mr. heimann, whose video we had, said 12 they expected folks to rely. they did rely. 13 their sales went up. the proof is in the 14 pudding. and you can infer from all of this 15 that george banks was entitled to reliance. 16 and here's something you have to 17 understand: how do you rely on something 18 that is concealed? 19 they concealed evidence not -- not known 20 or otherwise admitted. how do you rely on 21 something concealed? 22 well, here's how you do it: you think in 23 terms of what would reasonable men do. you 24 think in terms of, was the lying and denying 25 about addiction, was the lying and denying about the fact that their product was reliably 2 causing cancer and killing their -- their 3 customers, was that -- 4 was the fact that they hid it the kind of 5 information that would be important to a 6 reasonable man? was it material? 7 would a reasonable man have wanted to 8 known that -- to know that? 9 and had they have known that, would it 10 have given them a chance? with the -- the 11 benefit of the doubt in their favor that they 12 could have made a different choice sooner and 13 not succumbed to the horrible tobacco illness 14 that took this man's life so precipitously and 15 so surprisingly that his family had to come 16 running to figure out what happened. and 17 fortunately we have the autopsy that proves it. 18 right here, it says what class membership 19 is not about. there should be no confusion. 20 class membership is not about the fault of 21 either party. 22 it is very important to remember this. on 23 that question 1, was george banks addicted to 24 cigarettes containing nicotine; and, if so, was 25 such addiction a legal cause of esophageal cancer and death, that first question, it is 2 a -- it is -- it is simplicity. 3 it is that picture i showed you of the 4 hand holding the smoke. it is drug addiction. 5 it is all of the surgeon generals' reports, 6 saying it is the fundamental reason people 7 smoke, and that is why they get diseases. it is 8 that series of boxes in the surgeon general's 9 report, saying how addiction leads to cancer. 10 it is easy. 11 it can be made confusing, it can be made 12 complicated, it can be made to raise doubt and 13 uncertainty; but bottom line, bare minimum, 14 not-in-dispute evidence gets you -- 15 what happened? oh, okay. oh, sure. 16 a picture is worth a thousand words. 17 let us go back to where i was. 18 let us go back to where i was, please, the 19 last one, quickly, please. 20 remember this. and here is what i call a 21 trick. the engle progeny class members from 22 one end of the state to the other are entitled 23 to be in the class, and are not to be excluded 24 out of the class for any reasons that this 25 judge does not advise you on. he is not going to give you -- 2 mr. furr: objection, your honor. that is 3 a complete misstatement of the law. 4 mr. schlesinger: he does not -- 5 the court: hang on, mr. schlesinger. 6 mr. furr: excuse me, sir. please do not 7 talk when i'm objecting. 8 the court: mr. schlesinger. 9 ladies and gentlemen, class membership is 10 defined in the instructions. you will follow 11 the instructions as i have given you guidance 12 on. 13 go ahead, mr. schlesinger. 14 mr. schlesinger: if i may. 15 you will not hear a definition of the 16 term "addiction" from this court. addiction is 17 how it appears to you to be. and dependence on 18 a drug and addiction on a drug -- 19 and you heard it from henning -- you 20 heard it from cummings; you heard it from 21 traube, he said our man was addicted. you 22 heard it from the real expert, dr. difranza, 23 who studies brains and permanent changes said 24 it was -- said he was addicted or dependent. 25 you are not going to hear the judge say this is the legal definition of "addiction." 2 you are not going to hear the judge say this is 3 the -- this is the medical consensus definition 4 of "addiction," because there is many different 5 ways to define "addiction." and it can be 6 defined from the single symptom alone of 7 smoking a lot of cigarettes for a long period 8 of time. so it is like -- you know, like some 9 people say, it is like mountains and seasons. 10 you know it when you see it. 11 and you have a business that is based 12 upon the center of their universe being 13 nicotine addiction. they are in the nicotine 14 addiction business. and you have a customer, 15 george banks, who acted in total compliance 16 with everything they expected him to do, all 17 the way along his life. so he was the 18 customer, just like many others, that they 19 expected him to be. 20 class membership, that first question, is 21 he a class member, was he addicted to the 22 cigarettes containing nicotine, meaning was 23 that defective, addictive nature of that 24 cigarette that was in the cigarette such that 25 it caused him to get these diseases? he did; we proved it. 2 however, class membership is not about 3 fault. the first question is not about money. 4 the first question, when you answer it "yes" 5 and you move on, you have not awarded any money, 6 you have not compensated them, you have not tried 7 to restore the family for the loss that you are 8 going to measure, the loss -- 9 you are going to evaluate the 10 relationship, the good of the relationship, the 11 bad of the relationship, you are going to 12 contextualize it in terms of nuclear families 13 like the brady bunch that are together all the 14 time, and families for whatever circumstances 15 that are not together all the time, and you are 16 going to decide, did he love them, did somebody 17 love george banks, did katrina love george 18 banks, did she make enough of a -- of a 19 description of her feeling about her father 20 that you know he mattered to her, and do -- is 21 it normal and natural for people to care about 22 their parents even if they are imperfect? 23 so class membership is not about fault. 24 fault comes in the next set of questions. and 25 you can compare relative degrees of responsibility. 2 and we said we take some 3 responsibility -- the family authorized us -- 4 in combination with what they did, which we say 5 is far worse, because it was on purpose. our 6 man was an innocent, whose human weaknesses, 7 his human imperfections, perhaps, prevented him 8 from trying harder to do a better job to quit. 9 and you can assess it and you can assign 10 percentages, but not on question 1, which is 11 merely, is he in the engle class that embraces 12 all americans, all floridians who fit the 13 description. and it is got nothing to do with 14 fault. 15 do not be -- do not be distracted by that, 16 that business about, even if he was addicted, 17 he could have quit. whether he could have quit 18 goes into whether or not there is fault. 19 reliance on a statement from the tobacco 20 industry, that is not class membership. whether 21 addicts lose total control over their minds, 22 that is not class membership. whether addicts 23 can quit, we know they can, they can still be 24 addicts, and they can still be in the class. 25 how often george banks drank alcohol, that does not enter into the class description. 2 you have to take that into consideration when 3 evaluating and measuring the harm to the 4 family, and measuring what role that played and 5 whether -- and to what extent he is partially at 6 fault. 7 if george, yvonne and katrina always 8 lived together in the same home -- 9 some folks go off and work on the alaska 10 pipeline. some folks are overseas. some folks 11 are comfortable in a place where they grew up, 12 and it is a slow, quiet place, and they decide 13 to stay there. 14 and for whatever reason, they were apart. 15 they were not separated; they were together. 16 they were together in enough ways that when you 17 know that all the way to the very end, right 18 before he got really sick and decompensated, 19 that you have letters going back and forth to 20 katrina all the way up to mid-november, right 21 before they saw him and right before he really 22 became sick and died. 23 and, quite frankly, even though those 24 envelopes are empty, the envelopes are worth 25 more to this family than what was in them. and they are also evidence of an ongoing 2 relationship with the person that was loved in 3 both directions. 4 that father, in those letters, always 5 expressed love to his daughter; and his 6 daughter always expressed love to him. so 7 that is a real family. they were not separated, 8 they were not divorced, they were not together. 9 and you will probably say, we are not 10 going to award as much money as we would, we are 11 not going to compensate with as much money as 12 we would if it was a different kind of family 13 that was more nuclear. 14 and he was 81 years old, so he only had 15 so many more years to live anyway. he was not 16 going to live, in any likelihood, to a hundred. 17 he would not have been here today, anyway. 18 but those last few years, and those few 19 visits, and whatever it was that they could be 20 together, she was still a minor in the eyes of 21 the law, at age 23, because minority ends for 22 wrongful death cases at 25. they were still 23 entitled to that consideration. 24 and when you lose someone suddenly, it 25 hurts, and i think you saw, from katrina, genuine ongoing pain that exists today. i 2 think she told you in a way -- 3 mr. furr: objection to counsel's 4 personal opinions. 5 the court: your personal opinions do not 6 matter. you can comment on the evidence, sir. 7 mr. schlesinger: i think the evidence 8 shows that you can adjudge katrina yourself. 9 so it does not matter if they lived 10 together for class membership, and it does not 11 matter how much time they spent for class 12 membership. that is fault and amounts of money. 13 and i'm going to ask the court to indulge 14 me and i'm going to continue on. 15 i am going to skip over the percentages 16 of fault, i'm going to skip over the -- the 17 amounts of money for wrongful death, and i want 18 to show you these other questions that you have 19 to talk to and answer. 20 do you have the next one ready for me? 21 the court: you have about 20 minutes, 22 mr. schlesinger. 23 mr. schlesinger: thank you, judge. 24 i'm going to help you navigate your way. 25 if you want to -- if you believe punitive damages are 2 warranted, if you believe that this company was 3 off the moral compass, placed profits over 4 human lives, and that there is sufficient 5 evidence from dr. proctor and all the documents 6 you will have, the internal truths that they 7 admitted secretly they thought would never see 8 the light of day, i'm going to help you 9 navigate how to get there. 10 and there is a couple of questions here 11 which you looked at: did george banks 12 reasonably rely to his detriment on any 13 statement of material fact made by r.j. 14 reynolds and/or philip morris that concealed or 15 omitted material information concerning the 16 health effects of cigarettes or their addictive 17 nature; and, if so, was reliance a legal cause 18 of mr. banks' esophageal cancer? yes. 19 the answer to both of those questions 20 should be "yes," as they should be to the next 21 question with -- which is: did any of these 22 statements happen after 1982? 23 and we can play horrigan, who is one of 24 the guys in 1984, saying, we still do not know 25 what causes cancer; we do not know if it does. you could play those chief executive 2 officers who, in '94, said, we do not admit 3 it is -- nicotine is addictive, but they were 4 still denying, they were still lying all during 5 this period of time. 6 and i want to show that reliance board, 7 okay? 8 so the reliance can be inferred. you 9 do not have to put anything particular directly 10 in the man's hands, because there was nothing 11 personal about the public doubt campaign, there 12 was nothing personal about the traveling truth 13 squad, the college of tobacco knowledge, anne 14 browder, and all these different folks that 15 went around the country saying that it is an 16 open controversy, can we have an honest debate, 17 the case of cigarettes is not closed, that was 18 meant for a population in whole, of which 19 mr. banks was a part, of which the evidence 20 from the federal trade commission says the 21 surgeon general has no chance against the 22 immersive, overwhelming advertising that 23 reaches every single person. 24 so this is an instruction where it says: 25 it is not necessary that a direct statement be made to george banks in order to give rise to 2 the right to rely upon that statement. it is 3 immaterial whether the statement passes through 4 a direct or circuitous channel in reaching 5 mr. banks, provided the statement is made with 6 the intent that it reach him and be acted upon 7 him. 8 however, george cannot be found to 9 reasonably rely upon a statement if he knew of 10 its falsity or it was obvious to him, or if the 11 facts allegedly concealed was already known to 12 him. 13 let us show what he could not have known. 14 now, you may infer that there was nothing 15 personal about what the tobacco companies were 16 doing. they were going for an overall message 17 to get people to continue smoking, to give 18 addicts a psychological crutch to rely on, 19 things like an illusion of filtration. 20 and, in fact, it worked. their sales 21 continued. their sales did not stop. it 22 worked, and it worked with george banks. 23 george banks quit in 1988, when the surgeon 24 general said that nicotine was addictive. 25 is not that interesting? that is in the records. that is reliance. 2 and that is all you need to know for george 3 banks to be qualified, as one of many others 4 like him, to get to be able to have you 5 consider whether punishment is warranted, 6 whether the company did what the engle findings 7 say they did, what all those internal documents 8 showed they did, and what proctor called, you 9 know, just an -- a wall-to-wall conspiratorial 10 effort to defraud the american consumer. 11 so here's the thing: how would things 12 have been different if the tobacco companies 13 came forward and admitted filters were a fraud? 14 r.j. reynolds and philip morris 15 manipulated nicotine and added chemicals to 16 make them more addictive, like ammonia, things 17 like that. 18 he did not know that. they did not tell 19 him that. that would have been material. 20 would that have been important information? 21 could he have relied on that to give him a 22 chance to stop smoking, that smoking is not a 23 choice, that, rather, the nicotine in his 24 cigarettes were as addictive as heroin and 25 cocaine? nobody told him that before 1988, when 2 the surgeon general told him that. would that 3 have been important information? would that 4 have been a responsible thing for a responsible 5 company to do to tell him? by smoking camel 6 and marlboro cigarettes, that he had a 7 fifty percent chance of dying? 8 no other product in the history of human 9 civilization, when used as intended, kills half 10 of its customers. it is an anachronism in this 11 country. it is -- it is incomprehensible that 12 such a thing could exist, and yet we have been 13 enured to it. you know, they say it is a legal 14 product, and it is, but it is not. it is not 15 legal to sell to underage people, and -- 16 mr. furr: objection, your honor. 17 excuse me, sir. 18 the court: ladies and gentlemen, i 19 instructed you on cigarettes being a legal 20 product. you will follow my legal instructions. 21 mr. schlesinger: and not -- and -- and 22 you do not -- 23 underage smokers are the business -- 24 replacement business, absolutely. if they 25 wanted to be responsible and they wanted to do something different, and they said -- because 2 we are under the fda now, whatever -- cigarettes 3 are a drug, they are a drug-delivery device, 4 it is hard to wrap your mind around it, but 5 they are nothing but a drug, which, as i showed 6 you that hand, it is drug addiction -- say, 7 we are going to put them behind a pharmacy 8 counter, we are going to have the pharmacists 9 release them, and nobody under 21 is ever going 10 to get a cigarette, and you would knock 11 smoking -- 12 mr. furr: objection, your honor. this 13 is -- 14 mr. schlesinger: -- down by ninety percent 15 in this country. 16 mr. furr: this is not a comment on the 17 evidence, your honor. 18 the court: i agree. this is not. i 19 sustain the objection. 20 ladies and gentlemen, these comments are 21 confined to the evidence. your deliberations 22 are confined to the evidence, not the personal 23 comments of either -- all -- all three 24 attorneys in the case. 25 mr. schlesinger: dr. -- the court: you may proceed. 2 mr. schlesinger: dr. -- 3 mr. furr: make a motion, your honor. 4 the court: motion for mistrial is 5 denied, sir. 6 mr. schlesinger: dr. proctor testified 7 that the things you could do to make the 8 product safer and less dangerous is to make it 9 not addictive by taking out the nicotine to a 10 level below the ability to sustain addiction, 11 or to raise the ph so it was not inhalable. 12 so you would have mouth-puffing instead 13 of lung-sucking, and the poisons would not get 14 in, and you would not smoke as many, you 15 would not have to smoke a pack of cigarettes a 16 day and take in all those nicotine hits to the 17 brain, and associated carcinogens. 18 he also said you raise the ph, it stays 19 in the mouth, it does not go in the lungs, it is 20 not nearly as addictive. 21 they would still have a business. it 22 would not be as big a business, but it would 23 still be a business. 24 so there are responsible ways that they 25 could even stay in business and think of ways to go forward, help their customers instead of 2 consuming them. 3 and i say america is this industry's 4 ashtray. they stub out a -- 5 mr. furr: objection, your honor. 6 mr. schlesinger: -- half a million -- 7 mr. furr: excuse me. 8 the court: sustained. 9 mr. schlesinger, that is a completely 10 improper argument, sir. 11 mr. furr: your honor, i make a motion 12 for mistrial. 13 the court: i sustain the objection. 14 your motion for mistrial is under 15 advisement, sir. 16 you may continue. 17 mr. schlesinger: the material 18 information concealed and omitted from george 19 banks, that would have mattered, it says here 20 that the statements of scientists were giving 21 psychological crutches, doubt about health risk 22 and self-rationales, were paid for by the 23 tobacco industry to keep addicted smokers 24 smoking their deadly product. the tobacco -- 25 george banks did not know that. the tobacco companies expected him to rely upon 2 their lies, to continue smoking their 3 addictive, cancer-causing cigarettes, their 4 defective, cancer-causing cigarettes. heimann 5 admitted it, and it is an engle finding. 6 what they did, their lies, their 7 conspiracy, their defraud, was with the intent 8 that smokers would rely. the proof is in the 9 pudding. the sales went up. 10 that all of their efforts were carefully 11 planned, carried out, and successful, according 12 to their very own documents. they were. he 13 did not know that. 14 they chose not to go out of business even 15 though they promised to do so. they made a 16 promise. they said, we will stop making it. 17 several times by james bowling and several 18 others. in -- on television, in writing. but 19 that promise -- 20 the real reason for that promise was to 21 give false reassurance. 22 and then they did not remove the 23 carcinogens and harmful chemicals even though 24 they promised to do so. 25 let us play that tape, that montage, please. we have a brief montage of some of 2 what the folks said after 1982, because the 3 question after 1982 is -- 4 essentially, you check that "yes" to get 5 to punitives. and the important reason why is 6 because the conspiracy never ended until at 7 least 2000, when they finally had to admit it 8 was addictive and caused cancer. 9 but in an unbroken arc from 1953, all the 10 way through 1994, when you saw the chief 11 executive officers lying to congress, and all 12 the way through the year 2000, it was an 13 unbroken conspiracy. 14 so for -- for certain technical purposes 15 i cannot even explain, the judge has given this 16 ruling, you want to get to be able to determine 17 that punitive damages are warranted, you must 18 check off post-'82 on one of the two questions 19 that allow you to do so. 20 let us play this, please. 21 (the video clip was played and taken down 22 to the best of the reporter's ability as 23 follows:) 24 voice: and as far as i'm concerned, the 25 bottom line is that we simply do not know. voice: the case is still open. the jury 2 has not come in. 3 voice: it may not be harmful, you are not 4 convinced? 5 voice: it may be or it may not be. we 6 do not know. 7 voice: it is not known whether 8 cigarettes cause cancer. it has not been 9 causally established. 10 voice: do cigarettes cause cancer? 11 voice: i do not know if they do or not. 12 voice: i'm not in a position to give you 13 a "does" or "does not" answer. 14 voice: we do not know what causes cancer 15 in general right now, so i think that we may 16 find out what causes cancer, and we may find 17 out some relationship which has yet to be 18 proven. 19 mr. gdanski: we have a couple more. 20 mr. schlesinger: go ahead. 21 (the video clip was played and taken down 22 to the best of the reporter's ability as 23 follows:) 24 voice: throughout your tenure with 25 american, it was not only american's position, but your position, that cigarettes were not 2 injurious to health. is that accurate? 3 voice: through my tenure? 4 voice: yes. 5 voice: yes, that is so. 6 voice: that is something american tobacco 7 wanted the public to believe, is that correct? 8 voice: yes. 9 voice: it is a statement that american 10 tobacco takes great reliance -- 11 voice: we -- 12 voice: -- on? 13 voice: we issued that statement, yes. 14 voice: and as far as -- 15 voice: we believe it. 16 voice: as far as you are concerned, a 17 person is justified in relying on that 18 statement? 19 voice: yes. 20 voice: truck driver dennis gaines, a 21 grandfather, says he is been smoking for 30 22 years and is still not convinced cigarettes are 23 dangerous. 24 voice: you know they say it causes 25 cancer and heart disease. do you believe that? voice: no, i do not. not in my heart, i 2 cannot believe it. 3 voice: you cannot believe that it is bad 4 for you? 5 voice: no. 6 (video clip concluded.) 7 mr. schlesinger: is that it? 8 technician: yes, sir. 9 mr. schlesinger: look, folks, all too 10 often the choice between physical health of 11 consumers and the financial well-being of the 12 tobacco industry, concealment was chosen over 13 disclosure, sales were chosen over safety, and 14 money over morality. 15 and i ask you to consider who are these 16 persons who knowingly and secretly decide to 17 put the buying public at risk solely for the 18 purpose of making profits and who believe that 19 illness and death of consumers is an 20 appropriate cost of their own prosperity. i 21 ask you to consider that. 22 i ask you to consider this: because 23 they -- they talked about george. 24 and there is another board here i wanted 25 to use on how he died and -- united reporting, inc. 954-525-2221 447b68cb-553a-4b68-a004-836416c53f6f 1 (discussion off the record between counsel.) 2 mr. schlesinger: do you have it? 3 where is the other one? there is a separate one. 4 you can put it on the elmo if you have to. 5 i told you there was a couple of things 6 that they said -- 7 i want to do this real quick. this was 8 one of the opening boards. 9 and during opening, you know, there 10 was -- there was a moment there -- 11 i mean, it had some -- it had some -- it 12 had some power. jeff furr, i said he is a 13 powerful lawyer. he said something that -- 14 that -- it made my heart -- it made -- 15 i could imagine that the evidence would 16 make a person's heart sink for a moment, until 17 i thought about it. and he said that -- 18 he pointed out a medical record, and it 19 said that they called the banks family to 20 advise them of his deteriorating condition, and 21 that he was advised that he was not going to 22 live many more days and they should come visit 23 soon, and that yvonne and katrina banks did not 24 go back to that hospital, and mr. banks died 25 alone. and i thought about that, and i looked 2 closely, just like i looked closely at the 1915 3 surgeon general's report. and when you look at 4 the record and you read the record, where it 5 says he was advised he was not going to live 6 many more days and they should visit soon, 7 actually what it says is: she was advised that 8 the patient may not live many more days -- this 9 is a quote from the record in evidence -- she 10 expressed a plan to visit him as soon as she 11 could, but had some fear she might not be able 12 to visit him within the next several -- within 13 the next days. she was assured that the 14 patient's comfort needs were being met, and 15 that the staff would provide gentle, comfort 16 care in her absence. 17 it does not say she was told to come in, 18 and it does not say he was not going to live 19 many more days. it said he may or may not live 20 many more days. 21 and george banks did not die alone. he 22 died in the care of caring hospice people. the 23 family was sending their love. this was after 24 they had gone to the hospital and they had 25 stayed with him for days, and they transferred him to a different hospital. and then, because 2 of circumstances -- 3 not everybody can afford to do things. 4 different people have different hardships in 5 life. this is -- this is america. different 6 families go through different levels of 7 difficulty. 8 they did what they had to do to bring a 9 daughter he wanted to see get through college, 10 back to college to continue her classes. 11 they wanted to be back; and saying the 12 man died alone derogates the loss to these -- 13 to this family, because they buried him, and 14 they went to the funeral, and they were there, 15 and they grieved for him. 16 there was nobody named lampe or hall or 17 anybody else there. it was just his family, 18 the next of kin that is documented in the 19 medical record. when they said, who is the 20 emergency contact, it was somebody else. that 21 same record says, next of kin, and 22 identifies -- identifies yvonne banks. 23 so i say, you can consider, is that a 24 fully candid appraisal -- you can take it 25 down -- in assessing, trying to say that this man was neglected and died alone? 2 he became terribly, suddenly ill. he had 3 a sudden, catastrophic deterioration that 4 dr. traube says is common in such horrible 5 cancers as esophageal cancer. 6 and they had letters up till 7 mid-november, proving they had ongoing contact, 8 and they have a marriage certificate and a 9 birth certificate and they fit everything you 10 need to know about class -- belonging into a 11 class. 12 the court: you have four minutes, 13 mr. schlesinger. 14 mr. schlesinger: thank you, judge. 15 i guess i'm going to have to talk about 16 the amounts of money for -- for -- and the 17 comparative fault. 18 i think that because the philip morris 19 cigarettes -- 20 he clearly smoked the marlboro cigarettes 21 over a prolonged period of time, but there is 22 also evidence that there is some confusion 23 there. katrina said he smoked them a bunch. 24 you know, they are a part of the 25 conspiracy. and on the punishment claims, they cannot get away with being a part of the 2 conspiracy even if they did not -- even if he 3 did not smoke a lot of cigarettes. 4 so they are not going to get the same 5 level of percentage of fault as rjr is, but i 6 still say that he is an innocent, and he was 7 better than they were, and whatever the fault 8 breakdown should be, it should be greater for 9 them, in total, than for him. 10 he never knew at any time until at least 11 the '60s, when the surgeon generals came out 12 and the warning labels came out. even the ftc, 13 in 1967, said the warning labels were useless. 14 they never changed. they have not changed since 15 1985. 16 so that is not the be-all and end-all. 17 and the man was addicted well before they were 18 warning him. but the point is, we bear some 19 responsibility. we want to bear our fair share 20 of blame. 21 we want you to give us our fair share of 22 blame as long as you recognize it is in the 23 context of a man with a sixth-grade education, 24 that did the best he could. but one thing he 25 was not was -- he might have been weak. he was not a 2 liar. 3 so if you give him ten, 12-and-a half or 4 15 percent of the blame, and you give at least 5 fifty percent of the blame or more to r.j. 6 reynolds, you can give the rest to philip 7 morris. but as long as their individual blame 8 exceeds his blame, that is a powerful message, 9 saying what he did wrong is not nearly as bad as 10 what you did wrong. 11 so fifty percent for philip morris (sic), 12 ten to 15 percent for my client, and up to 13 35 percent for philip morris. they have been 14 nice and quiet over there, and that is fine; but 15 they are still part of the conspiracy, and you 16 saw a lot of their documents that talked about 17 what they did. 18 now, as far as money is concerned, 19 it is -- 20 what? 21 (discussion off the record between counsel.) 22 mr. schlesinger: oh, and by the way, 23 when you get to those intentional torts, the 24 on-purpose things, the things they did to lie 25 to him and deceive him, that he could have reasonably relied on like a reasonable man, if 2 you award an intentional fault check mark, he 3 will not get any reduction for the percentages. 4 i know it is a little complicated, and you 5 do not really have to trouble yourself with it, 6 but he will get full benefits. he will not get 7 15 percent knocked off, is what i'm saying. if 8 you award -- 9 if you move forward through the punitive 10 damages, to get to the punishment, i say, which 11 is why we are here, which is where i want you to 12 be, and i want to see you on monday, if you see 13 this case our way, if we have stitched it 14 together the right way, that is how it will be. 15 and then i want to just tell you this: 16 we have to come up with an amount of money. 17 it is an unknown thing. it is a human amount. 18 it is whatever you guys think it is. it is not 19 what i think it is. and i -- and i do not want 20 to suggest to you -- 21 yvonne is never going to see any of this 22 money. she is not going to live to see this 23 money. this is an award where you measure the 24 magnitude of the loss, and you say to the -- to 25 my clients, through your verdict -- through your verdict, we see what happened, we place 2 value on your loss, we measure the magnitude of 3 your loss, we place value on it, we recognize 4 it was hard, we recognize it was not perfect. 5 we recognize the man drank. the duration 6 of drinking, the precision of the quantity of 7 drinking is very unclear from that record, but 8 we acknowledge he had an alcohol problem. it is 9 contributing. it contributes to the 10 relationship, it contributes to the smoking, it 11 could have been a part of how he got esophageal 12 cancer; but it is a distraction. you should 13 keep your eye on the ball. it is not what this 14 case is about. 15 you could award them any amount of money 16 you want. i do not even know what a fair amount 17 to suggest is. you could award them a million 18 dollars apiece for the loss of their family 19 member. if that is -- 20 you could award them two, or you could 21 award them three. if they -- if this was a 22 super nuclear family, with no problems, no 23 issues, nothing, i would ask for six or eight 24 or $10 million apiece for the family member as 25 restoration for what they lost. this is a different situation. he was not 2 going to live that long, anyway, maybe into his 3 90s. they were only going to have a few years 4 with him. 5 so it is up to you. you could award him 6 five -- you could award them 500,000. you 7 could decide it is 500,000 apiece. i am not 8 sure. but you dignify the loss if you believe 9 it was an unnecessary, premature, preventable 10 death because of a deadly, dangerous product. 11 and it is a number from which you will then 12 calculate punishment. the punishment must be 13 related to the compensatory damages. 14 so if it is in your heart and in the 15 proofs, and you see it our way and you can 16 consider providing a meaningful level of 17 compensation, you know, it is -- 18 everyone says it is all about the money. 19 if it is all about the money, the experts, my 20 clients, if it is all about the money, what is 21 it to them? if it is all about the money, who 22 is it the most -- who is the money the most 23 important to in this courtroom? 24 and i say it is the cigarette companies, 25 and that is why the fine is a way of you telling them, we do not approve of this, this is 2 indecent human behavior. 3 and i want to end with this last thing. 4 and i thank the court's indulgence for letting 5 me go over. 6 i want to say this one thing: there is a 7 great author, and i thought about it in this 8 case, because francis bacon said that knowledge 9 was power, but george orwell said that 10 ignorance was strength. 11 and dr. proctor explained the nature and 12 power and the strength and the success and the 13 money tobacco companies have made from sowing 14 the seeds of doubt and ignorance for decades. 15 ignorance is strength. orwell was a 16 post-apocalyptic version of how topsy-turvy the 17 world could get. war is peace. ignorance is 18 strength. 19 and here's something he said, and i want 20 you to think about it if -- if you feel this 21 case has validity, if you see it our way. 22 and the scene was played by richard 23 burton and john hurt, in the movie "1984," on 24 the book by george orwell. it is standard 25 reading. some folks have read it, some folks have not. 2 our man, with a sixth-grade education, he 3 did not see any high school books in georgia. 4 but this book, george orwell, famous 5 book, john hurt is laid out to be tortured by 6 big brother, richard burton, he is a powerful 7 actor, powerful, powerful men that provoke 8 great emotion on the screen, and the words on 9 the page are every bit as powerful. 10 winston was the man played by john hurt, 11 and he was the one that was about to be 12 tortured. he said we -- 13 mr. heise: objection, your honor. 14 mr. schlesinger: all -- 15 mr. heise: "torture" references. this 16 is not in evidence. this is entirely improper 17 argument. 18 mr. schlesinger: forget "torture," 19 judge. i take that back. 20 the court: all right. go ahead and 21 finish, sir. 22 mr. schlesinger: above all, we do not 23 let a -- 24 excuse me. 25 richard burton talking to john hurt, so you have a mental picture. above all, we do 2 not allow the dead to rise up against us. you 3 must stop imagining that posterity will 4 vindicate you, winston. posterity will never 5 hear of you. you will be lifted clean out from 6 the stream of history. we shall turn you into 7 a gas and pour you into the stratosphere. 8 nothing will remain of you; not a name in a 9 register, not a memory in a living brain. you 10 will be annihilated in the past, as well as in 11 the future. you will have never existed. 12 and i suggest to you, ladies and 13 gentlemen of the jury, that cigarettes and 14 tobacco took this man from his family before 15 his time, and that some of the things in this 16 courtroom, where they blamed the victim and ran 17 him down because of this issue about 18 drinking -- 19 mr. furr: objection, your honor. 20 objection. 21 the court: overruled. 22 finish, please. 23 mr. schlesinger: -- tries to take away 24 some of the memories that katrina has of the 25 father she loved. and it is not what somebody else thinks 2 about you that defines your worth. and he was 3 worth something to somebody. he was worth 4 something to his family. 5 and no matter how little his worth, as 6 exemplified in this courtroom, he was better 7 than them; and you will send them a powerful 8 message by saying, you cannot do this to people, 9 even -- 10 mr. furr: objection, your honor. 11 the court: that is completely improper, 12 mr. schlesinger, and you know that. this is 13 not -- 14 mr. schlesinger: i wish i could agree, 15 judge. 16 the court: this is not about sending a 17 message, ladies and gentlemen. you will 18 disregard the comments from the attorney. 19 the motion for mistrial is under 20 advisement. 21 mr. furr: thank you, sir. 22 mr. heise: thank you. 23 the court: wrap up, please, 24 mr. schlesinger. 25 mr. schlesinger: if you see this evidence our way, and you decide that we are 2 right and it should be stitched -- stitched 3 together in the way that we said, and you get 4 to find that punitive damages are warranted, it 5 will allow you to express moral -- an 6 expression of moral condemnation for 7 intentional -- 8 mr. furr: objection, your honor, it is 9 the same -- it is the same argument. 10 the court: finish your answer -- finish 11 your statement, sir. 12 mr. schlesinger: it will allow you to 13 express moral condemnation, which is justly 14 deserved, for quasi-criminal acts. and these 15 things lead to deterrence, and that is one of 16 the things that we want you to consider doing. 17 and i thank you for your time. 22 mr. schlesinger: counsel, thank you. 23 got 20 minutes in ya? all right. 24 so very first thing i want to let you know. 25 the trial and the deliberation is yours. when we turn this case over to you, we hand it to 2 you, it is yours to do as you please for the 3 period of time you feel necessary to go through 4 everything. what i mean by that is, when i said 5 get us to monday, it is because, again, the 6 conduct of the tobacco companies, which you may 7 have noticed, they did not talk about what they 8 did, not one solitary word about it. they 9 did not talk about or discuss anything having to 10 do with all the years of the things they did to 11 deceive the public and cause deaths by addiction 12 of tens of millions of people with documents, 13 not one single document that they put in front 14 of you that shows something different than what 15 the truth is in their own internal secret 16 reports. 17 but when you get to deliberate, because 18 we are later in the afternoon than we meant to 19 be, and we always are, and it is friday in the 20 afternoon the judge is going to give you a lot 21 of leeway in deliberations. and deliberations 22 can take days. so you can deliberate monday. 23 if you cannot finish today you can come back. it 24 will be at the court's pleasure. we will be at 25 your pleasure to take the time you need to get through what you want to get through, because 2 you could get hung up on some of these 3 questions. i think some of them do not need 4 that, but you just need to know you have as much 5 time as you want. if we get to where we want to 6 be, which is where we hope the evidence takes 7 us, which is this warranting of punishment for 8 this long wrongful conduct then we have no 9 evidence to put on except for net worth of 10 companies. and the only evidence they will put 11 on is a single -- 12 mr. furr: objection, your honor. objection 13 as to the what the evidence will be. 14 mr. schlesinger: he talked about putting on 15 witnesses -- 16 the court: proceed. 17 mr. schlesinger: i think they have a single 18 witness named dr. figlar, who is a corporate rep 19 that will talk to you about other things going 20 on. so you will hear a brief witness from them 21 then you will be able to go out and do punishment 22 damages. 23 the only reason i say it is that i just 24 do not want to think on friday afternoon you are 25 like, let us just get out of here. if the case warrants the full consideration the court is 2 going to let you come back on monday and 3 continue your deliberation. it will still be 4 done in well under three weeks, which is what we 5 thought we were going to do. 6 now, let us look real quickly at this 7 important instruction, because i want the 8 instructions to be clear. and i do not know, can 9 you put it up, baron? 10 mr. schlesinger: in any event, punishment 11 damages considerations, there is no doubt about 12 the doubt campaign. i say there is no doubt. 13 that is why i'm proud and i embrace the standard 14 of clear and convincing evidence that you arrive 15 at without confusion, without doubt. that is 16 the beautiful rebuttal to the doubt and the 17 confusion that decades of company 18 misrepresentations cause, the tirc, the ctr that 19 they are telling you was a good organization are 20 co-conspirators under engle and they have been 21 disbanded. they are co-conspirators, those 22 front groups. 23 so it says here, "you may consider harms 24 suffered by other persons not parties to this 25 lawsuit in assessing the reprehensibility or wrongness of a defendant's act. 2 "you may consider harms by persons -- other 3 persons not parties to this lawsuit in assessing 4 reprehensibility wrongfulness of the defendants' 5 acts." 6 why do you think we put in evidence of 20 7 million deaths? and i tried to give you the 8 kind of language so you could understand what it 9 means. i try to take you through a little walk 10 around florida. as a florida native, i thought 11 we would talk about florida. and imagine an empty 12 state. that is how many people would have met 13 their demise. 14 but what is important, you also heard is, 15 that more than 40 million americans are caught 16 in a web of tobacco dependence. remember you 17 heard that yesterday in cross-examination from 18 the current surgeon general? 40 million people. 19 that is essentially all the smokers. 20 nicotine dependence is 80 to ninety percent or 21 more of all smokers, and 80 to ninety percent of all 22 smokers begin in youth, adolescence, teens. i'm 23 sorry we inadvertently would say words like 24 "kids" and "children." we are not supposed to 25 say it. that is not what we are talking about. that is what the judge's instruction was, but he 2 let us put in evidence. i want to show diane 3 burrows -- of what they do and who they study, 4 replacement smokers. all business is based on 5 youth. and they have replacement smokers and 6 they have 12-year-olds. and you know what a 7 12-year-old is to a tobacco company? a young 8 adult. a 12-year-old young adult. that is what 9 they call them. you see who they are seeing, 10 they are watching and marketing and studying, 12 11 year olds, 13 year olds, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, in 12 there, two-thirds of smokers are starting in 13 youth. 14 and my client george banks was an age cohort 15 and dr. difranza testified he probably started 16 in his teens because ninety percent of them do and 17 all -- according to this book, which is on 18 preventing tobacco use among youth and young 19 adults, all, all tobacco smoking begins in 20 adolescence. 21 mr. furr: your honor, objection. that book 22 is not in evidence. 23 mr. schlesinger: an excerpt is, judge. 24 the court: do not show the book if it is not 25 in evidence, but you can comment and it will be up to the jury to determine -- 2 mr. schlesinger: there is an excerpt from 3 the book in evidence -- 4 mr. furr: your honor, no excerpt from the 5 book in evidence. 6 the court: again, the jury will be 7 cautioned to remember the testimony from the 8 witnesses. 9 if it is not in evidence do not show it. you 10 can proceed. 11 mr. schlesinger: during cross of dr. hoge i 12 referred to the book. one of the things they 13 talked about, the website, and it had links that 14 give you a link to the surgeon general sites, 15 rjr showed their website. that gave a link to 16 2008 and 2010. they do not link to the 2012 17 report. that is not linked. 18 and here is the surgeon general's report 19 that is in evidence, because we caught mr. furr 20 and he responded. but the fact of the matter is 21 is he did something, and i submit to you the 22 evidence shows it was misleading. this is the 23 official annual report of the surgeon general of 24 the public health service of the united states 25 for the fiscal year 1915. and the man's name in here is dr. blue, it is not that long symenanski 2 [sic] name, who was a surgeon, not a surgeon 3 general. this is the congressional official 4 report. 5 dr. proctor said that guy you are talking 6 about, i think he was a surgeon of some kind. 7 look in this report. it does not have a warning 8 about tobacco being addictive. and it is 9 inconsistent. in 1964 they said it was a habit. 10 what would have happened? it does not appear in 11 here. tobacco is not a warning. it was not 12 warned to be addictive in 1915. you can look 13 through this. this is in evidence. and it is 14 not what they purport it to be. it is not the 15 surgeon general's report, the document they 16 quoted from, not a surgeon general's report. 17 it is a report based on garment workers and it 18 did not even have the quote correct the way he 19 said it had it. he said there was a warning 20 that smoking is addictive. 21 even the document he showed you did not say 22 smoking was addictive. it talked about tobacco 23 being the most popular form of tobacco 24 addiction, a colloquialism. it was not, in my 25 assessment of the evidence, and hopefully yours, a completely candid way to show this to you. 2 but let me move on. 3 in this courtroom as we start, there is also 4 already an established baseline of the 5 defendants and their conduct. they already have 6 been convicted of being conspirators, 7 fraudsters -- 8 mr. heise: objection, your honor. 9 mr. schlesinger: -- liars. 10 mr. furr: it is absolutely an incorrect 11 statement of the law. 12 the court: ladies and gentlemen, again, the 13 jury instructions dictate how you are guided in 14 this case. 15 objection is overruled. go ahead. 16 mr. schlesinger: right out of the box they 17 come into this courtroom having lied, having 18 deceived, having defrauded the american public, 19 and they do not ever want to talk about that at 20 all. they just want to talk about mr. banks and 21 they want to quote from roosevelt hall. what 22 were they doing going out to roosevelt hall's 23 house, more than one of them, two or more at a 24 time -- 25 mr. furr: objection. mr. schlesinger: -- unannounced four times. 2 mr. heise: it is a pretrial ruling. 3 mr. schlesinger: that is in evidence. 4 the court: sustained. 5 i take that back. it is overruled. it is 6 overruled. 7 mr. schlesinger: thank you, judge. 8 "did this individual who came here, what, 9 three or four times? 10 "three or four times. 11 "how many times did the individual come to 12 your home? 13 "one time he came here with a man twice and 14 he came with a lady twice. 15 "so that is four times. 16 "uh-huh. 17 "did he ever call ahead of time to ask you 18 when a good time would be? 19 "he asked for my phone number, but he never 20 called because i never talked to him on the 21 phone. 22 "so on each of the four occasions the 23 investigators came to -- the tobacco companies 24 came to your home, they came unannounced. 25 "yeah, unannounced." that is a neutral independent witness. did 2 you see any witness statements, recordings? do 3 you see the -- 4 mr. heise: objection, your honor. 5 mr. schlesinger: did they put on the 6 witness stand the people that met with him? 7 mr. heise: objection, your honor. 8 the court: objection is overruled. 9 mr. schlesinger: and by the way, if a 10 person goes to work every day day in and day out 11 or goes through a starbucks, how many folks or 12 acquaintances of ours that do not know anything 13 about our life, that do not know if we have kids 14 or do not know if we smoke or do not know if we 15 drink? and lampe, hall and hall never saw him 16 drink. they said they saw him drunk. nobody 17 gave an amount of drinking. mrs. hall did not 18 live with him, was never up in his apartment. 19 they never got close enough to smell him. and 20 they have taken people that do not know anything 21 about this man in particular. 22 and it was particularly inappropriate to 23 suggest that mr. lampe, who was a different 24 race, they did not mix. he said, we did not mix. 25 mr. furr: objection. excuse me, do not talk over the objection. 2 the court: sir, do not make those comments. 3 it is improper. the objection is sustained. 4 continue, please. 5 mr. schlesinger: there is evidence in the 6 case when they read from mr. lampe's deposition, 7 we were not social friends. the man came to 8 work. we did not mix. this is back a long time 9 ago. what do you think they were talking about? 10 mr. heise: objection, your honor. 11 mr. schlesinger: they were not social 12 friends. 13 the court: mr. schlesinger, that is not 14 proper, sir. i sustained the objection. 15 disregard the remarks about mixing. 16 mr. schlesinger: it is in the case. 17 the court: i sustained the objection. 18 mr. schlesinger: yes, sir. 19 diedrich lampe also said that despite what 20 he knew about being a mental paraplegic that he 21 knew there was confusion out there with regard 22 to what people knew about how dangerous health 23 [sic] was. 24 and here's what my client mr. banks was 25 faced with. he was faced with a reality of a warning that said it might be dangerous to your 2 health and it is dangerous to your health but 3 did not say specifically how it is dangerous. he 4 did not have details. he did not have 5 specificity. and he had overwhelming 6 countermeasures in his face at all times from 7 tobacco trying to block anybody from really 8 coming to that conclusion. 9 and here's the thing, if everybody knew it 10 was dangerous, why did not their clients know? 11 why did not they know? why did not the tobacco 12 executives know? why did not the scientists at 13 rjr know? why did they keep saying it is not 14 dangerous, it has not been proven, it is an open 15 question, here's a filter, it will work for you? 16 why did not they know? why is it everyone was 17 supposed to know in the '30s and '40s and '50s 18 and '60s but the tobacco industry executives 19 did not know? that is an interesting conundrum. 20 they knew. you saw the documents. let us look 21 at some of them. 22 let us look at -- let us look at this one, 49. 23 please. 24 "as the lawyers remind us" -- this goes back 25 to 1980s. "as the lawyers remind us, we cannot defend continued smoking as free choice if the 2 person was addicted." 3 this is while they are still denying 4 addiction. all the way through the engle trial 5 in 1999, denying addiction, not admitted until 6 the year 2000. "we cannot defend continued 7 smoking as free choice if the person was 8 addicted." 9 because they knew that they had to deny 10 addiction. they knew they had to continue to 11 deceive the public. and they did. and they 12 admit it internally. we got no defense if it 13 turns out this is an addictive substance. and 14 there it is in their own words. 15 next. let us do 51, please. 16 this is claude teague. remember i said we would 17 shine a spotlight on claude teague. i've got 18 another board for him to do that. 19 but, look, i call this document the chiller 20 because when i read it i see how cold-blooded -- 21 mr. furr: objection. 22 the court: mr. schlesinger. 23 mr. schlesinger: you said that was 24 appropriate closing argument. 25 mr. heise: we move, your honor. mr. schlesinger: i have a ruling from you. 2 you said it may be appropriate in closing 3 argument. 4 the court: objection is sustained. you may 5 continue, sir. 6 mr. schlesinger: i apologize. 7 mr. furr: could you rule. 8 the court: your motion is under advisement. 9 mr. schlesinger: i do not have to 10 characterize this statement, and i'm sorry if i 11 did, but i do not have to characterize it. i'm 12 just going to read the language and you can 13 decide yourself what it means and if it is 14 inhuman and indecent. 15 mr. furr: objection, your honor, same 16 issue. 17 the court: overruled. 18 continue, sir. 19 mr. schlesinger: because you are allowed to 20 consider the wrongfulness to others as to the 21 degree of reprehensibility, that is what this 22 case is about. 23 "we have deliberately played down the role 24 of nicotine; hence, the nonsmoker has little or 25 no knowledge of what satisfactions it may offer him and no desire to try. instead we must 2 somehow convince him with wholly irrational 3 reasons that he should try smoking in the hope 4 that he will for himself then discover the real 5 'satisfactions,'" in quotes, "obtainable." 6 and we know they use code words and we know 7 satisfaction is a code word for intent. and 8 that is the deliberate, intentional knowledge 9 aforethought business of addicting youth into a 10 lifetime of smoking and then replacing the dying 11 smokers with new smokers. 12 let us go to the other board. 13 these are just some of the things claude 14 teague, more than anybody else you can shine a 15 spotlight on this man who spent a lifetime, an 16 illustrious career at rj reynolds doing nothing 17 but things which are not appropriate for decent 18 humans who follow a moral compass. 19 he knew that if your company is to survive 20 and prosper over the long term you must get your 21 share of the youth market. 22 happily for the tobacco industry, nicotine 23 is habituating and unique in its physiological 24 action. 25 nicotine is the sine quinon of smoking. and they know how to induce a pre-smoker -- 2 right, the 12-year-old young adult -- induce a 3 pre-smoker or a nonsmoker to become a habituated 4 or a hooked smoker. 5 they want to hook them. nobody chooses 6 addiction. they do not know what they are getting 7 themselves into. by the time they hear 8 something about it being dangerous it may be 9 harmful for your health. mr. banks is hooked 10 for decades. the man is hooked for decades. 11 it goes on, this is all teague. 12 nicotine, a potent drug. 13 our industry is based upon the design, sale 14 and manufacture of attractive doses of nicotine. 15 and then teague is involved in the 16 suppression research. 17 i destroyed all the formal reports. and we 18 have tons of documents in evidence suppression 19 and burying reports. 20 then he goes on to talk about getting the 21 nicotine kick with the ammonia compounds to 22 release the full potential of this powerfully 23 addictive drug. and he indicates how you can 24 instantly perceive the nicotine kick with the 25 ammonia compounds, the soul of the marlboro cigarette. 2 down here he says, we cannot be comfortable 3 selling a product which most of our customers 4 would stop using if they could, that is to say, 5 if the exit gate from our market should suddenly 6 open we could be out of business overnight. 7 now what is the discomfort? the discomfort 8 is that if somebody -- let us put up this one. 9 the discomfort is if we have a business and if 10 there is a way for someone to figure out how to 11 get our hooked patients, our consumers not 12 hooked, we could be out of business overnight. 13 and what are they uncomfortable with? are they 14 uncomfortable with the cigarette being used as 15 intended and killing half their customers? no. 16 are they uncomfortable with addicting them to 17 the point where they smoke millions of hits of 18 nicotine and poisons for decades and die? no. 19 they are uncomfortable with losing their 20 business. 21 what is a moral compass? what does an 22 ethical person do in a situation like that? 23 they are uncomfortable with the fact that their 24 product is killing somebody. that is what you are 25 supposed to be uncomfortable with, not uncomfortable with the prospect that something 2 could happen and you could be out of business 3 overnight. that is a rutterless ship on a moral 4 sea, rutterless ship. 5 and here is something that is also important 6 to look at. this is when they were first 7 starting to develop ways to put drugs that might 8 block nicotine. like i said, why does it have 9 to be so hard? if the cigarettes are not 10 addictive, if you do not have cigarettes, if you 11 stop making them like you promised, why do we 12 have to go through this unbelievable contortion 13 in this country for people to get off 14 cigarettes? why does it have to be so hard? 15 why? because it is so addictive. why else? 16 they do not want people to quit because people 17 that quit quit buying. quit smoking means quit 18 buying. they do not want people to quit. and 19 they do not care if they die. and when they die 20 they replace them, with youth. i mean, really. 21 mr. furr: your honor, i object. 22 the court: one minute, mr. schlesinger. 23 mr. furr: inflammatory and prejudicial. 24 the court: overruled. 25 mr. schlesinger: if you look at this it says, if we go forward with this research to 2 block nicotine, we are going to be in the 3 process of digging our own graves. and we are 4 not going to do it because it could put the 5 tobacco manufacturers out of business. 6 and let us put this up real quick, because i 7 saw this and i said, there is just no way. i 8 brought awesome, excellent, highly qualified 9 experts. they brought nobody. i brought 10 dr. traube. they did not touch dr. traube on 11 cross. he said in no uncertain terms the man 12 was addicted, he got esophageal cancer 13 principally from smoking. he candidly, like a 14 scientist, acknowledged that alcohol played a 15 role. and then mr. furr got up here and put up 16 a slide. the slide had no reference to the page 17 and line. and when i pulled it it said, if he 18 quit smoking, if he quit drinking -- 19 mr. furr: your honor, i object. this is 20 wrong. 21 mr. schlesinger: that quote is not in this 22 record. 23 the court: mr. schlesinger, when there is an 24 objection please stop. 25 your objection is overruled. you may continue, sir. you need to wrap up. 2 mr. schlesinger: just like the business 3 about he died alone, just like the business of 4 the record saying you better get back here. 5 there is no record that says you better get back 6 here. these are the things they do. this is 7 the evidence and you can consider -- 8 mr. furr: objection, your honor -- 9 mr. heise: objection, your honor. he is 10 again just disparaging the defense. 11 the court: the motion is under advisement. 12 the objection is sustained. 13 mr. schlesinger: you can consider whether 14 or not this is incomplete reference to the 15 evidence in a way that could confuse you or 16 cause doubt or make you uncertain. but this is 17 what it says. 18 "if he had quit smoking -- excuse me -- if 19 he had quit drinking when he quit smoking in 20 1988 he would have cut his risk for esophageal 21 cancer by fifty percent more likely than not." 22 highly qualified expert, he gave excellent 23 explanation as to what happened. 24 dr. difranza also said he died from 25 esophageal cancer from smoking and that he was definitely addicted. and dr. traube said he was 2 definitely addicted. they did not bring anybody 3 except for dr. hoge, who even admitted that the 4 nicotine contributed to his smoking [sic]. and 5 dr. hoge, like i said, you have got the power to 6 reject his opinions and take him out of this 7 courtroom. 8 one more. let me just see here. 9 oh, this i have to touch base on. this i 10 have to touch base on. 11 okay. here's something contemporaneous. 12 put it up. i saved this. 13 i wanted to prove the case to you by the 14 medical records. they definitively with virtual 15 certainty document the most important witness in 16 the case, mr. george banks, who for no reason 17 other than he was asked by a doctor when he had 18 a broken hand. which by the way when his hand 19 was broken he could not write a not, so a friend 20 wrote a note expressing love to his daughter. 21 like that is some sort of mystery or maybe an 22 insinuation that there was an affair. there is 23 nothing like that in this case, nothing like 24 that in this case. but most importantly, most 25 importantly, and i saved it and i wanted to show it to you and i wanted to bring it out, because 2 i wanted to prove my case with experts who have 3 been world renowned and sought by the surgeon 4 general and people all over the world. and i 5 did it with dr. difranza and cummings and traube 6 and proctor. proctor, a hero who -- his book is 7 a revelation what he is revealed about the secret 8 wrongdoing of the tobacco industry for decades, 9 something we cannot accept in this country as a 10 proper corporate activity. 11 but here is a document, this is a 12 contemporaneous medical record. and mr. furr 13 said yvonne said give me a letter that says 14 smoking made him die. where is the evidence of 15 that in this case? there is no such testimony. 16 let us look at the letter. the letter says, 17 "dear mrs. banks: this is in response to your 18 inquiry about the cause of your husband's death 19 while hospitalized at lake city virginia [sic] 20 va medical center between the 29th and the 21 15th." [sic] 22 right down here, "the cause of lung cancer 23 and emphysema is most likely related to 24 smoking." 25 and he had had the autopsy report. he knew the cause of his death was cancer of the lung 2 and esophagus food pipe. he knew the esophagus 3 food pipe cancer had spread to the lung. 4 read the autopsy report. you will see it in 5 there. by the time it spreads and it is fatal in 6 your lung when you cannot breathe and the fluid 7 is building up, you die from that spread of 8 cancer. he explains it. this is a totally 9 independent witness. they did not bring him. 10 they did not depose him. they brought no expert 11 to contradict -- 12 mr. heise: objection, your honor. 13 the court: overruled. 14 mr. schlesinger: -- him. and this is a 15 very simple medical record, contemporaneous 16 within a few weeks of his death, within days or 17 a month after the autopsy was completed and 18 reviewed by the treating doctor that was there 19 with him in february of '96 at his bedside who 20 was asked by a family that was surprised by 21 weight loss, which in two or three months was 22 dramatic. and it was not 50 pounds. look at the 23 record. it was about 40 pounds. because 24 there is other weights in there of 122 pounds. 25 he went from 160 to 122. it said in the record, 40-pound weight loss in the last several months. 2 it is in the record, look at the record. 3 and it says right here, "the cause of lung 4 cancer and emphysema most likely related to 5 cigarette smoking." treating doctor, totally 6 independent. dr. siri. a medical record in the 7 case documenting that the man died from 8 cigarette smoking. 9 and back at the time in 1988 and 1990 when 10 he was in the hospital -- in 1990 he had quit 11 smoking. why would a doctor write down in the 12 chart, you have a smoking addiction? he said he 13 quit smoking two years earlier. mr. furr said, 14 nobody wrote down that he was an addicted 15 smoker. first of all, nobody writes that down, 16 you do not see that in medical records. just 17 like i showed you the new autopsy report. the 18 new autopsy report talks about whether smoking 19 contributed to disease. that is the modern way, 20 but back then it is not common for someone to 21 write that down. and what is more, why would you 22 write down that a man has an ongoing tobacco 23 addiction if in 1990 when he is there for a 24 broken hand he says, i stopped smoking two years 25 ago, but i smoked for 50 years before that. there would be no medical need at that point to 2 document him as an addicted smoker. 3 but here is a totally independent, not a 4 witness that anybody hired in the case, a 5 treating doctor at the time, contemporaneous. 6 dr. hoge said contemporaneous records are so 7 valid. the man died from smoking. 8 the court: you are at the end of your time, 9 sir, you need to wrap up. 10 mr. schlesinger: i told you first i said i 11 do not know how much to ask for and i said maybe 12 a million a piece would be appropriate, but, 13 again, the six of you can make the decision. 14 that is why i said you can give as many as 2 and 15 a half, 2 -- i said 2 million or 3 million a 16 piece. you can give 500,000 a piece. you can 17 give any amount you want. 18 your life experience and my life experience 19 can differ and so when i make a recommendation, 20 it is just to give you someplace to work. and 21 you can decide based on what you think the 22 strengths and weaknesses of the relationship 23 were what is fair. 24 but, quite honestly, if you watch katrina 25 testify and she always consistently said the man smoked marlboros, by the way. if you watched 2 her testify and you saw what you thought is the 3 ring of truth, an honest, appropriate, emotional 4 responses at honest moments in time. that is why 5 we have a trial here in a courtroom live as 6 opposed to just something that you read about or 7 hear about. when you see folks live you get a 8 chance to see how they really are. 9 look, you have given us attention over and 10 above and beyond the call of duty. i always say 11 i wish my jurors the best of luck at arriving at 12 justice. what we look for is justice. the 13 system gives us a chance at justice. we have a 14 fervent prayer that we get to justice. and i 15 say to you, you hold in your hands this 16 decision. it is a wonderful opportunity to 17 continue this jury system. you hold great power 18 and please discharge it wisely. and we will all 19 be thankful for that no matter what decision you 20 make. 21 thank you.
