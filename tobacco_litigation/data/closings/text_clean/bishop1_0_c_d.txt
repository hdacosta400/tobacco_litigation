6 mr. walker: good afternoon, ladies and 13:38:56 7 gentlemen. i want to start where mr. clark did, and 13:38:57 8 just echo what he said, thanking you all for your 13:39:01 9 service in this case. he was really right when he 13:39:04 10 said that everybody here, the staff, the lawyers for 13:39:06 11 both sides, really all of our clients really and 13:39:09 12 truly appreciate the sacrifice that you have all made 13:39:12 13 to be here. 13:39:14 14 you have been very conscientious. we all kind of 13:39:15 15 watched to see when you are taking notes and, you 13:39:17 16 know, who is really listening and paying attention, 13:39:21 17 and you really all have been. 13:39:22 18 and we just really all appreciate that and i 13:39:23 19 need that to be the first thing that i say to you on 13:39:26 20 behalf of everyone here, on behalf of my client, we 13:39:29 21 really, really appreciate your service. 13:39:32 22 um, as to the other folks who spoke that i 13:39:34 23 brought some remarks along with me that i want to 13:39:38 24 discuss with you, but before i say anything else, i 13:39:40 25 want to talk to you about something because i was 13:39:43 1 sitting there listening to mr. berg and mr. clark 13:39:45 2 and it occurred to me that there is something that 13:39:47 3 we have all seen throughout all of the evidence. it 13:39:49 4 maybe has not really been yet and maybe it is time to 13:39:52 5 say this. 13:39:55 6 the fact is, the reality is that when it comes 13:39:56 7 to cigarette smoking, there are people who enjoy 13:39:59 8 smoking cigarettes. there are people who want to 13:40:03 9 smoke cigarettes, even though they know that smoking 13:40:07 10 cigarettes is a dangerous activity. 13:40:10 11 that is true today in 2014, that there are 13:40:13 12 millions of people who know the risks and who 13:40:16 13 nevertheless like to smoke and want to smoke. and 13:40:20 14 the evidence showed you in this case that that was 13:40:22 15 true in the 1950s, in the 1960s, in the 1970s and 13:40:24 16 throughout mr. ramsay's lifetime. 13:40:29 17 the fact of the matter is, you do not have to be 13:40:32 18 addicted to want to smoke cigarettes. you do not 13:40:34 19 have to be fooled, you do not have to be ignorant of 13:40:37 20 the risk, you do not have to be any of those things 13:40:40 21 because there are people in this world now and then 13:40:42 22 who like smoking cigarettes and are comfortable with 13:40:45 23 the risks that you take when you smoke cigarettes. 13:40:48 24 just like there are people who know the risks 13:40:51 25 of riding a motorcycle, and who are comfortable of 13:40:53 1 taking those risks because they like riding 13:40:56 2 motorcycles. there are people who are comfortable 13:40:59 3 with the risk of not eating right who know those 13:41:00 4 risks, but take them because they like to eat a 13:41:03 5 certain way. 13:41:06 6 the evidence is going to be in this case that 13:41:07 7 when it came to smoking, mr. ramsay was one of 13:41:10 8 millions of americans who, frankly, enjoyed smoking. 13:41:14 9 it relaxed him. it helped him deal with the stress 13:41:18 10 of his work. and he knew the risks and did not 13:41:22 11 smoke because of any of the things that have been 13:41:25 12 asserted in this case. 13:41:28 13 now, um, one of the things i need to address up 13:41:29 14 front, too, is the fact that there was a suggestion 13:41:35 15 that the defendants, that we did not call any 13:41:37 16 witnesses. that all you heard from us was a short 13:41:40 17 clip of mrs. ramsay that we played during our case, 13:41:43 18 and that is not quite right. 13:41:47 19 and the reason i say that is not quite right is 13:41:48 20 because the reason we did not need to call witnesses 13:41:52 21 in our case is because they called our witnesses for 13:41:54 22 us. they spent hours and hours and hours with 13:41:57 23 witnesses that they were paying by the hour to come 13:42:01 24 here and talk to you about -- about a number of 13:42:04 25 different subjects. and we, just like we said we 13:42:06 1 might do in jury selection, we got in a lot of the 13:42:10 2 facts and the evidence that were relevant to our 13:42:13 3 point of view in this case through their witnesses. 13:42:16 4 and i want to give you some examples. 13:42:18 5 yeah, i could have called a witness who would 13:42:20 6 come here and tell you that mr. ramsay knew the 13:42:24 7 risks of cigarette smoking the entire time that he 13:42:26 8 smoked, but i did not need to do that because 13:42:30 9 mrs. bishop took the stand and told you that under 13:42:35 10 oath. 13:42:35 11 she told you that mr. ramsay knew the risks of 13:42:36 12 cigarette smoking the entire time that he smoked. 13:42:40 13 you heard evidence that the warning labels were on 13:42:41 14 the packages for almost the entire time that he 13:42:43 15 smoked, and that mrs. ramsay, their son and their 13:42:46 16 daughter were constantly warning mr. ramsay about 13:42:50 17 the health risks of cigarette smoking. 13:42:52 18 there was a suggestion about how mr. ramsay 13:42:56 19 started smoking when there were no warning labels. 13:42:59 20 yeah, that is true, but the warning labels were never 13:43:02 21 the only source of information about the health 13:43:05 22 risks of cigarette smoking. 13:43:07 23 you heard evidence in this case about all the 13:43:07 24 other ways that smokers and nonsmokers and everyone 13:43:10 25 else in america learned about the health risks of 13:43:13 1 cigarette smoking. and i want to show you a slide 13:43:17 2 with just one example of that. 13:43:19 3 remember you heard this in the case. this was 13:43:21 4 the surgeon general in 1957. that is right around 13:43:25 5 the time that mrs. bishop meets mr. ramsay. and 13:43:28 6 dr. -- and surgeon general burney was saying in 1957 13:43:34 7 that the position of the surgeon general is that he 13:43:38 8 had informed the public through the excellent 13:43:41 9 coverage of the press, radio and tv. and we showed 13:43:43 10 you the press and the tv. 13:43:46 11 could i have called in another witness to 13:43:48 12 repeat what mrs. bishop said to repeat all this 13:43:50 13 evidence? sure. we could have been here another 13:43:53 14 two or three days listening to that. but i did not 13:43:55 15 need to because we got that in through their 13:43:58 16 witnesses. 13:44:00 17 i could have called a witness here to tell you 13:44:01 18 that mr. ramsay had the ability to quit smoking. we 13:44:02 19 could have -- we could have put on hours of 13:44:06 20 testimony about that. but i did not need to do that 13:44:09 21 because mrs. bishop told you that mr. ramsay did 13:44:11 22 quit smoking in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. 13:44:14 23 the fact that mr. bishop [sic] quit in the late 13:44:18 24 1980s and 1990s the very first time he made an 13:44:21 25 asserted effort to quit tells you that he could have 13:44:24 1 accomplished the same thing earlier in his smoking 13:44:28 2 career had he been interested in doing that. 13:44:31 3 mr. clark said that we did not call a witness to 13:44:33 4 address all the design features, and he -- he -- he 13:44:37 5 went up to the witness stand, talking about 13:44:40 6 dr. villa. well, this is what -- mr. clark came up 13:44:43 7 here (indicating), and he said -- remember he 13:44:46 8 said -- dr. villa stood up here and he talked to you 13:44:51 9 about lung cancer and all of these different things. 13:44:53 10 he did all of those things, that is true. 13:44:55 11 then when mr. clark sat down, mr. -- dr. villa 13:44:58 12 sat down and he started answering questions of 13:45:02 13 mr. isasi. and do you know what he said when he was 13:45:04 14 answering those questions? he said that each and 13:45:06 15 every one of those design features that you spent 13:45:09 16 all day hearing about from dr. henningfield did not 13:45:11 17 make a pill of difference to mr. ramsay. 13:45:15 18 whether mr. ramsay was smoking filtered 13:45:18 19 cigarettes or unfiltered cigarettes, cigarettes with 13:45:20 20 overwrap, cigarettes without overwrap, any of those 13:45:23 21 design features on that chart did not mean anything 13:45:26 22 to dr. villa about the cause of mr. ramsay's cancer. 13:45:29 23 i could have called a witness here to tell you 13:45:32 24 that the only thing that mattered to mr. ramsay is 13:45:34 25 when he decided to quit smoking. did not need to do 13:45:37 1 that because dr. villa, right from this witness 13:45:41 2 stand where i was sitting, told you that had 13:45:44 3 mr. ramsay quit smoking in 1964, when the united 13:45:47 4 states surgeon general's report came out, he would 13:45:51 5 have eliminated 97 to 98 percent of his risk of 13:45:52 6 getting lung cancer from smoking. 13:45:57 7 dr. villa told you that if mr. ramsay had quit 13:46:00 8 smoking even in 1974 after the collapsed lung, if he 13:46:03 9 had stayed quit and not gone back to smoking 13:46:08 10 cigarettes, he would have eliminated over half of 13:46:10 11 his risk of getting lung cancer. 13:46:12 12 that means that the choices that mattered to 13:46:15 13 mr. ramsay were the ones that mr. ramsay made, and 13:46:17 14 he, more likely than not, would not have gotten 13:46:21 15 cancer and died from cigarette smoking had he made a 13:46:24 16 different choice in 1964; and 1966, when the labels 13:46:27 17 went on; in 1970, when the labels changed; or in 13:46:32 18 1974, when he was off cigarettes for three and a 13:46:36 19 half weeks. 13:46:39 20 i did not need to call a witness to tell you 13:46:40 21 those things because in this case the facts are our 13:46:43 22 witnesses. the facts do not need $925 an hour to 13:46:47 23 tell you what the truth is about this case. i do not 13:46:53 24 have to pay $5,600 a day to point out to you the 13:46:56 25 facts that prove our point in this case. the facts 13:47:01 1 are our witnesses and those are the ones i'll be 13:47:05 2 talking about today that establish that there should 13:47:08 3 be a defense verdict. 13:47:11 4 but before i leave this question about the 13:47:12 5 witnesses, i just told you that the facts are 13:47:16 6 unbiased, they are impartial, they are not paid. what 13:47:18 7 about the plaintiffs' witnesses? they told you in 13:47:20 8 opening statement they were going to bring 13:47:23 9 world-renowned experts. and i said what you are 13:47:25 10 really going to see are some of the most biased 13:47:28 11 experts you have ever seen. because unlike the 13:47:31 12 process of selecting jurors, where we want people 13:47:33 13 who are impartial, who are unbiased, who can be 13:47:35 14 objective, that is not always how expert witnesses 13:47:38 15 are selected. 13:47:41 16 can i have the next slide, please? 13:47:43 17 take a look at three of the witnesses that the 13:47:44 18 plaintiffs brought you today, that they talked about 13:47:47 19 being world renowned. there is dr. cummings on the 13:47:49 20 left. he is the guy that is been paid a million 13:47:53 21 dollars testifying in almost 80 cases like this. 13:47:54 22 and he is the guy who told you from the witness stand 13:47:58 23 that he is been described as a mercenary, a soldier 13:48:01 24 for hire in these cases. 13:48:03 25 dr. hurt on the right. the one with the grin 13:48:08 1 there. he is the one that is been paid $5,600 a day. 13:48:10 2 he is the guy who says not all smokers are addicted, 13:48:15 3 but yeah, every time i testify, i always say they are 13:48:18 4 addicted. that is what $5,600 a day buys you. 13:48:21 5 dr. henningfield in the middle. he is the one 13:48:26 6 that said he is on a crusade. he is been on a crusade 13:48:28 7 against the tobacco companies. and he is the one 13:48:32 8 who is been paid $925 an hour for his testimony. 13:48:34 9 if you do the math, that comes out to about $15 13:48:39 10 a minute. there are people in this world who would 13:48:42 11 love to have a job that pays $15 an hour. every 13:48:45 12 minute that he was up there not giving a clean 13:48:49 13 answer to mr. isasi to a "yes" or "no" question, he 13:48:52 14 was getting paid $15 per minute. 13:48:54 15 and remember -- if you remember dr. hurt and 13:49:00 16 dr. cummings, the ones on the outside. those are 13:49:04 17 the ones that all attended the same conference, 13:49:06 18 where they get together with plaintiffs' lawyers and 13:49:08 19 they try to figure out how to get a just verdict. a 13:49:10 20 verdict with a big number. 13:49:13 21 and those are the ones that receive this trial 13:49:14 22 in a box. if you wondered why you are being shown 13:49:17 23 ads and clips and things that maybe did not really 13:49:21 24 seem that relevant to mr. ramsay, you were going to 13:49:24 25 see them anyway. remember dr. cummings? 13:49:28 1 dr. cummings in the evidence that mr. ramsay, the 13:49:30 2 business executive at texaco was watching the 13:49:33 3 beverly hillbillies and the flintstones. oh, yeah. 13:49:36 4 yeah, yeah. i'm -- i'm going to put myself out 13:49:40 5 there on a limb like that. 13:49:44 6 dr. cummings, dr. henningfield, dr. hurt are 13:49:45 7 going to show the same presentation to every jury in 13:49:47 8 this engle class of smokers. maybe in some other 13:49:50 9 cases some of that evidence will apply. the 13:49:55 10 evidence is going to be in this case it did not apply 13:49:56 11 to mr. ramsay. 13:49:59 12 and the last thing i want to say about this is 13:50:01 13 remember dr. hurt? dr. hurt's the one who gave such 13:50:04 14 a hard time to mr. fiorta over there when he was 13:50:09 15 trying to ask him the questions, and the funny thing 13:50:12 16 is right at the beginning of that presentation 13:50:15 17 mr. fiorta said, dr. hurt, i've got this powerpoint 13:50:18 18 where you were given advice about how you are 13:50:20 19 supposed to act in court. and your powerpoint says 13:50:23 20 whatever you do, do not give anything up. avoid 13:50:25 21 "yes" or "no" answers. get in your messages as much 13:50:30 22 as you can. and doggone it, that is what he did. 13:50:34 23 he avoided giving anything up. he avoided any 13:50:38 24 kind of a "yes" or "no" answer. he was going to say 13:50:41 25 what he wanted to say, whether it was responsive to 13:50:43 1 the question or not. 13:50:45 2 you saw the same thing from dr. cummings. 13:50:46 3 getting a "yes" or "no" answer from dr. cummings was 13:50:50 4 like pulling teeth. and you are going to be allowed 13:50:52 5 to consider -- can i have the next slide? 13:50:56 6 one of the instructions that you are going to 13:50:58 7 get is going to tell you all of the different ways 13:51:00 8 you can consider the credibility, the believability 13:51:03 9 of these witnesses. you can consider the frankness 13:51:05 10 or lack of frankness of the witness. any interest 13:51:09 11 the witness may have in the outcome of the case. 13:51:12 12 that would include things like being paid a million 13:51:15 13 bucks or 900 bucks an hour. the reasonableness of 13:51:17 14 the testimony of the witness. 13:51:21 15 and the bottom line with these paid experts is 13:51:23 16 that you can accept the opinion of those experts, 13:51:26 17 you can reject it, or you can give it the weight 13:51:29 18 that you think it deserves. and i'm going to talk 13:51:33 19 to you about the reasons why you should not give much 13:51:35 20 weight to the testimony of their paid experts. 13:51:37 21 i want to show you one of the things that can 13:51:42 22 happen when there is a major credibility issue. i 13:51:45 23 asked all of you in jury selection and in openings, 13:51:47 24 i said, i do not have the burden of proof; i'm always 13:51:51 25 going to go second. that means i've got to sit over 13:51:53 1 there and wait while i'm hearing all of this 13:51:55 2 testimony going on and i'm thinking, what about 13:51:58 3 this? what about that? you did not show this other 13:52:00 4 part. 13:52:02 5 and i asked each and every one of you if you 13:52:02 6 can wait until it was my turn to stand up and ask 13:52:05 7 questions so you could get the rest of the story. 13:52:08 8 and you all said you could do that. and i could 13:52:10 9 tell that you were actually doing that. and i want 13:52:13 10 to show you just a couple of examples why that is so 13:52:15 11 important, especially when you have paid witnesses 13:52:19 12 like this. 13:52:21 13 this is just one example. on the right you see 13:52:22 14 this teague document from 1972. and they wanted to 13:52:24 15 show you a passage that said nicotine is a sine qua 13:52:29 16 non of tobacco products. like that was this huge 13:52:32 17 secret that the tobacco companies had buried in a 13:52:35 18 vault somewhere. 13:52:37 19 only on cross-examination were we able to come 13:52:38 20 back and say, no, in reader's digest in 1950 when it 13:52:40 21 was the most popular magazine in america, that same 13:52:44 22 concept was being published 22 years earlier. 13:52:48 23 nicotine is the essential ingredient of tobacco. 13:52:52 24 it is what makes tobacco tobacco, and not just 13:52:54 25 another weed. 13:52:57 1 let us look at one more. here's another 13:52:58 2 example. on the right is the reynolds document from 13:53:02 3 1959 that they said, my god, the tobacco companies 13:53:04 4 know something no one else does. they know that 13:53:06 5 there are eight polycyclic hydrocarbons isolated 13:53:10 6 from smoke. that is the document from dr. rodgman 13:53:12 7 who was actually publishing on ways to know what was 13:53:16 8 in cigarette smoke. 13:53:19 9 we had to come back on cross-examination and 13:53:20 10 say, wait a minute. november 1959? that is the same 13:53:22 11 month, the same information was being printed 13:53:27 12 publicly in the most popular magazine in america. 13:53:31 13 they have identified eight carcinogenic polycyclics 13:53:35 14 in tobacco smoke and are on the trail of others. 13:53:40 15 that is why it is always been important in this case 13:53:43 16 to wait and withhold judgment to see both sides of 13:53:45 17 the story. 13:53:48 18 now, we are closer to the end of this case than 13:53:49 19 we have ever been. and i see some smiles maybe 13:53:55 20 because of that. i know you are all heartbroken 13:53:59 21 about that. it is okay. but the reason we are close 13:54:01 22 to the end is because soon you are going to have a 13:54:04 23 chance to fill out this verdict form (indicating). 13:54:06 24 the verdict form that you get will look a lot 13:54:08 25 like this, but it will not have this blue highlighting. 13:54:11 1 the blue highlighting is every place on this verdict 13:54:14 2 form where there is a reference to robert ramsay. 13:54:17 3 and i did that to show you what i told you at the 13:54:19 4 beginning of this case. this case is not about 13:54:22 5 every smoker in the world. they must have said 13:54:25 6 about 20 times 20 million smokers were affected by 13:54:28 7 smoking. 13:54:32 8 it is not about 20 million smokers; it is about 13:54:32 9 one smoker, robert ramsay, and whether or not their 13:54:36 10 allegations mattered to him. 13:54:38 11 every question on the front page, second page, 13:54:40 12 throughout, you will see when you get it, it is all 13:54:44 13 about one smoker and one smoker only, robert ramsay. 13:54:47 14 what i'm going to try to do, then, is i have my 13:54:51 15 copy, but i have some that i put on the powerpoint. 13:54:57 16 i'm going to try to take you through the verdict 13:54:59 17 form and suggest to you what we think you saw in the 13:55:01 18 evidence. you will make your own decision, but i 13:55:03 19 think you are going to see that the right result in 13:55:06 20 this case is -- is a defense verdict. 13:55:10 21 but, um, when we get to those questions, think 13:55:12 22 about these things because i -- i'm not going to 13:55:17 23 keep saying this. but i will -- i will say this 13:55:19 24 because i said it in opening. what did we learn 13:55:21 25 about mr. ramsay? we learned that mr. ramsay was a 13:55:24 1 willing smoker who smoked because he liked what 13:55:28 2 smoking did for him. it relaxed him. it helped him 13:55:31 3 cope with the stress of his job. 13:55:34 4 the evidence was mr. ramsay smoked and 13:55:36 5 continued smoking because he was not interested in 13:55:38 6 quitting. the first time he really was interested 13:55:40 7 in cutting down on his smoking, he cut down to what 13:55:43 8 dr. hurt told you was a nonaddictive level of 13:55:46 9 smoking in the late 1980s. 13:55:49 10 the first time he was really interested in 13:55:51 11 quitting smoking altogether for his own reasons, not 13:55:53 12 because mrs. bishop wanted him to, for his own 13:55:57 13 reasons, mr. ramsay stopped smoking. that is a fact. 13:55:59 14 the evidence that nicotine did not control 13:56:05 15 mr. ramsay, and we are going to talk more about that, 13:56:08 16 because there is evidence in this case about what 13:56:10 17 mr. ramsay did when he did not even have any nicotine 13:56:12 18 in his system. that is going to tell us everything 13:56:16 19 we need to know about whether nicotine turned 13:56:19 20 mr. ramsay into a robot. and we are going to talk 13:56:22 21 about the evidence that mr. ramsay was not misled. 13:56:24 22 so let us pull up the very first question from 13:56:26 23 the verdict form. was robert ramsay addicted to 13:56:28 24 cigarettes containing nicotine, and if so, was such 13:56:33 25 addiction a legal cause of his lung cancer? 13:56:36 1 couple of different issues bundled up in that. 13:56:38 2 you can think about that in at least three parts. 13:56:44 3 one part would be, is the nicotine in cigarettes 13:56:46 4 addictive at all? and you actually heard a lot of 13:56:51 5 evidence about that. 13:56:54 6 can i have the next slide? 13:56:55 7 that the plaintiffs put on evidence through 13:56:56 8 dr. hurt, dr. henningfield and a bunch of documents 13:57:04 9 trying to show you that the nicotine in cigarettes 13:57:05 10 is addictive. but you know what? i told you that 13:57:08 11 in jury selection. i told you in opening statements 13:57:11 12 that i was not going to come here and tell you that 13:57:14 13 the nicotine in cigarettes is not addictive. no 13:57:17 14 dispute about that. 13:57:20 15 some people who smoke cigarettes get addicted, 13:57:20 16 and some people who are addicted to cigarette 13:57:23 17 smoking have a hard time quitting. that is not the 13:57:26 18 issue on the verdict form. the issue on the verdict 13:57:29 19 form is about mr. ramsay. 13:57:31 20 and it is been known for hundreds of years, by 13:57:32 21 the way, that the nicotine in cigarettes and tobacco 13:57:37 22 is addictive. that is never been a secret. and 13:57:41 23 dr. cummings told you that reynolds and philip 13:57:44 24 morris never -- that reynolds and philip morris did 13:57:48 25 not deny that nicotine was addictive in the 1950s, 13:57:50 1 in the 1960s or in the 1970s. all those decades 13:57:56 2 when we will see that mr. ramsay was not really trying 13:58:00 3 to quit, the companies were not denying that the 13:58:03 4 nicotine in cigarettes was addictive. 13:58:05 5 um, so then the question becomes, well, was 13:58:09 6 mr. ramsay addicted? was he addicted? they claim 13:58:14 7 that he was, and most of their evidence about 13:58:18 8 whether mr. ramsay was addicted came from one 13:58:21 9 person, that same dr. hurt that i was talking about. 13:58:23 10 the guy who was paid all that money, who says, not 13:58:26 11 all smokers are addicted. but every time i, 13:58:29 12 dr. hurt, testify, they are addicted. 13:58:33 13 then we said, well, okay. how do you come up 13:58:37 14 with that? how is it that you can tell this jury 13:58:40 15 that mr. ramsay was addicted? he says, well, i've 13:58:42 16 got this heaviness of smoking index. when we start 13:58:45 17 to talk to him about it, you find out it is a rigged 13:58:48 18 test. 13:58:52 19 can i have the next slide? 13:58:52 20 look at this test. think about this for one 13:58:55 21 second. you are asked two questions. and no matter 13:58:57 22 how you answer the questions, if you look down at 13:59:01 23 the scoring, the answer is always dependent. no 13:59:04 24 matter whether you smoke, whether you do not smoke, 13:59:08 25 how many cigarettes a day you smoke, when you have 13:59:11 1 your first cigarette. you could take somebody who is 13:59:13 2 never smoked their whole life, administer this test 13:59:17 3 to them, and the answer is going to be this person 13:59:20 4 is addicted. they just have a low level of 13:59:22 5 addiction. 13:59:24 6 to use this test is to decide in advance that 13:59:25 7 the person is going to be addicted. and the 13:59:29 8 interesting thing is, dr. hurt does not use this test 13:59:32 9 in his regular work. in his regular work he uses a 13:59:34 10 completely different test called the fagerstrom test 13:59:38 11 that has more variables and is scored differently. 13:59:41 12 where does he use this heaviness of smoking 13:59:45 13 index that is rigged to always come out an addicted 13:59:48 14 result? in court. talking to juries like you. 13:59:51 15 the minute dr. hurt chose to use this test is 13:59:55 16 the minute he was not giving you an unbiased, 13:59:59 17 impartial opinion about whether mr. ramsay was 14:00:02 18 addicted. there is no possible way to answer this 14:00:04 19 test to have an answer that is not addicted. 14:00:10 20 so you will have to decide for yourself whether 14:00:13 21 that is good enough. the plaintiffs have the burden 14:00:15 22 of proof. we do not. that is what they brought you, 14:00:18 23 a rigged test and a highly paid witness to deliver 14:00:20 24 it. 14:00:24 25 but the really important question is not the two 14:00:24 1 that i've been talking about. the really important 14:00:27 2 question is the verdict form question. 14:00:30 3 was addiction a legal cause of mr. ramsay's 14:00:32 4 lung cancer? and i want to just look with you at 14:00:36 5 the instruction that you are going to get about what 14:00:39 6 legal cause means. 14:00:41 7 this is basically the same instruction that -- 14:00:42 8 that plaintiffs' counsel showed you, except they 14:00:45 9 did not highlight the words that i'm showing you now. 14:00:48 10 "an addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine is a 14:00:52 11 legal cause of disease or medical condition if it 14:00:54 12 directly and in a natural and continuous sequence 14:00:56 13 produces or contributes substantially to producing 14:01:00 14 such disease or medical condition so that it can 14:01:03 15 reasonably be said that but for" -- that is the key 14:01:07 16 language -- "but for the addiction to cigarettes 14:01:10 17 containing nicotine such disease or medical 14:01:13 18 condition would not have been suffered." 14:01:15 19 a lot of words in there. you will have time to 14:01:18 20 look over those as much as you want in the jury 14:01:21 21 room. the bottom line is, this is the test. if you 14:01:38 22 look at somebody who smokes, you ask yourselves, if 14:01:27 23 we take away this alleged addiction, would the 14:01:31 24 person still smoke? if you take away the nicotine, 14:01:34 25 is the person still going to smoke? and what does 14:01:39 1 the evidence show about that generally? 14:01:42 2 let us take a look at the next one. 14:01:44 3 the question, again, is going to be, did 14:01:49 4 addiction lead continuously and substantially to 14:01:51 5 lung cancer? 14:01:55 6 let us go to the next slide, please. 14:01:55 7 what was the evidence, not just about whether 14:01:57 8 people can be addicted or whether or not nicotine is 14:01:59 9 addictive; this is about what does addiction 14:02:02 10 actually do? does it actually turn people into 14:02:05 11 robots? does it change people's behavior? 14:02:08 12 this is what the evidence was. "nicotine does 14:02:12 13 not prevent smokers from choosing to try to quit." 14:02:14 14 again, this is their expert. "many smokers who say 14:02:17 15 they want to quit, do not try. addicted smokers can 14:02:21 16 quit and even heavily addicted smokers can quit." 14:02:24 17 let us look at one of the charts that was shown 14:02:29 18 to you by plaintiffs' witnesses. maybe you can 14:02:32 19 remember this one. on the left you see there is a 14:02:34 20 percentage for daily smokers, and then to the right 14:02:40 21 of that you can see that there are many smokers who 14:02:42 22 do not even say that they want to quit. 14:02:46 23 next to that, you can see that even among 14:02:49 24 people who say they want to quit, some do not 14:02:52 25 actually try to quit smoking. 14:02:56 1 can i have the next one, please? 14:02:59 2 this was the pamphlet that dr. cummings put 14:03:00 3 together that we also discussed with one of the 14:03:06 4 other experts. 14:03:08 5 this is their -- these are their witnesses 14:03:09 6 talking: "do you want to stop smoking? are you 14:03:12 7 willing to make some changes in your daily routine? 14:03:15 8 are you willing to put up with some uneasy moments 14:03:22 9 after stopping? if you can answer yes to all three 14:03:25 10 questions, you can stop smoking." 14:03:28 11 this is their experts telling you that all 14:03:31 12 smokers, even ones who meet criteria for addiction, 14:03:34 13 can quit smoking. 14:03:37 14 and the evidence was also that there can be 14:03:39 15 different degrees of addiction. you can be heavily 14:03:41 16 addicted and it might be harder for you to quit, or 14:03:45 17 you can be not as heavily addicted and you can be 14:03:47 18 successful quitting easier than some other people 14:03:51 19 can be. 14:03:54 20 quitting smoking is a very individual thing. 14:03:55 21 and that is why we have to look at what the evidence 14:03:59 22 was for mr. ramsay. but we are doing that knowing 14:04:02 23 that in america, there are 60 million americans who 14:04:05 24 have quit smoking. there are more people who are 14:04:09 25 former smokers than current smokers. 14:04:12 1 the question becomes: was mr. ramsay so 14:04:15 2 addicted that he could not stop smoking, or did he 14:04:20 3 smoke as a matter of personal choice? and i want to 14:04:23 4 take the first half of that first. 14:04:27 5 was mr. ramsay so addicted that he could not 14:04:29 6 stop smoking? well, we know the answer to that is 14:04:33 7 no. because mr. ramsay did quit smoking. 14:04:36 8 when they showed you this chart, they were 14:04:41 9 trying to say that only 3 percent of smokers who 14:04:43 10 attempt to quit at a given time are successful in 14:04:47 11 the long term. that may be so. 14:04:50 12 but if that is true, mr. ramsay is part of that 14:04:52 13 3 percent. because he did quit smoking the minute 14:04:55 14 he made an asserted effort to do so. 14:05:00 15 it is true before that he experimented with 14:05:04 16 quitting while he went on vacation. mrs. bishop 14:05:06 17 said once or twice a year they would go on a vacation. 14:05:09 18 mr. ramsay would say, i'm on vacation, i'm taking a 14:05:12 19 vacation from smoking too. and then a couple of 14:05:16 20 days later he would give up on that. she would buy him 14:05:18 21 cigarettes and he would be back to smoking again. that 14:05:22 22 was not a concerted, committed effort to quit. 14:05:24 23 mr. clark, i think it was, said something about 14:05:29 24 chronic relapsing. it is not chronic anything if you 14:05:32 25 only do it once a year. 14:05:35 1 if you are only trying to quit once or twice a 14:05:38 2 year when you go on vacation, you are not somebody 14:05:41 3 who is constantly doing everything you can to try to 14:05:44 4 quit smoking and failing. that is not what it is. 14:05:47 5 at some point he tried nicotine gum. sure. 14:05:51 6 but what did he really use the nicotine gum for? 14:05:57 7 while he was smoking the gum, did he ever put down 14:06:00 8 his cigarettes? the testimony was he did not. while 14:06:04 9 he was on the gum, did he use the gum to reduce his 14:06:05 10 cigarette smoking? he did not do that either. 14:06:08 11 it was only in the late 1980s when mr. ramsay 14:06:11 12 made an asserted effort, that was the words 14:06:15 13 mrs. bishop used, an asserted effort to quit and he 14:06:19 14 succeeded. 14:06:22 15 now, the second half of the question was, did 14:06:23 16 he smoke because he made a personal choice to do so? 14:06:25 17 well, how can we figure that out? how do we know? 14:06:28 18 the plaintiffs are saying, well, he smoked because 14:06:31 19 of nicotine. he smoked because he was a young 14:06:33 20 person when he started. he smoked because he did not 14:06:35 21 know the risks. 14:06:38 22 how do we know whether those things are true? 14:06:38 23 for the same reason that mr. berg talked to you 14:06:41 24 about. there is a very important piece of evidence 14:06:44 25 in this case that you have all heard about. and 14:06:46 1 that is this episode that he had in the mid-1970s 14:06:48 2 where he had this collapsed lung. and i just want 14:06:51 3 to show you this (indicating). 14:06:54 4 during jury selection i asked almost each and 14:07:00 5 every one of you whether you had a moment in your 14:07:10 6 life where you were presented with the option to 14:07:12 7 smoke or not to smoke, and we talked a little bit 14:07:14 8 about how you viewed that situation and what you did 14:07:17 9 about it. 14:07:19 10 i'm showing you, and i'll tell you this: i 14:07:20 11 believe this is lake eola. turns out i'm not from 14:07:23 12 orlando. so this is a neat lake that i saw around 14:07:27 13 here, and when i would try to go jogging before it 14:07:30 14 got really cold, i would go through this area. 14:07:32 15 and one day when i was -- when i was doing that 14:07:35 16 i thought, you know, if i keep running straight down 14:07:37 17 this path, i'm going to end up in this lake. so it 14:07:39 18 turns out that you got to go left or you have got to 14:07:44 19 go right. and that is a lot like what happened to 14:07:48 20 mr. ramsay in 1974. 14:07:50 21 he is on a business trip. you all know the 14:07:53 22 story by now. his lung collapsed. he is freaking 14:07:55 23 out. his colleague takes him to the hospital. it 14:07:59 24 turns out he is unconscious for like ten days. ten 14:08:01 25 days he is out, knocked out to the world. what is 14:08:04 1 happening during those ten days? 14:08:07 2 within ten hours the nicotine that was in his 14:08:09 3 system from whenever his last cigarette was went out 14:08:12 4 of his blood stream. i did not have to call a 14:08:15 5 witness to say that; dr. hurt admitted that. 14:08:17 6 that is just his blood stream. within a couple 14:08:19 7 of days, the nicotine is out of his body entirely. 14:08:22 8 there is no nicotine in his system at all. 14:08:26 9 he is still unconscious. the witness has told 14:08:28 10 you that the peak withdrawal symptoms when 14:08:32 11 withdrawal is at its worst is within a few days 14:08:35 12 after you stop smoking. 14:08:38 13 day 1, day 2, day 3 can be very hard. it 14:08:39 14 was not hard for mr. ramsay because he is unconscious. 14:08:44 15 he is in a hospital. he cannot smoke. he is safe. so 14:08:46 16 he basically slept through the peak withdrawal 14:08:50 17 symptoms that might make some smokers, if they are 14:08:54 18 addicted, want to start smoking again. that was not 14:08:56 19 his experience. 14:09:00 20 then dr. hurt said that withdrawal symptoms, 14:09:02 21 not just the peak, but any withdrawal symptoms, they 14:09:05 22 end within 14 to 21 days. what happens in that 14 14:09:08 23 to 21 days? well, by day 10 mr. ramsay's 14:09:12 24 discharged. he is very scared because he is aware of 14:09:17 25 the risk that his cigarette smoking may have somehow 14:09:20 1 contributed to his lung issue. he is worried about 14:09:23 2 it. ms. bishop is worried about it. they are all 14:09:26 3 worried about it. 14:09:28 4 so he does not smoke the first day he is back 14:09:29 5 from the hospital or the second day or the rest of 14:09:32 6 that week. he goes all the way into the second week 14:09:33 7 without smoking. 14:09:36 8 by this time he is 24 or 25 days out from his 14:09:38 9 last cigarette. the withdrawal symptoms that 14:09:42 10 dr. hurt set in after 14 days or 21 days are over. 14:09:46 11 he is weeks away from having nicotine in his system. 14:09:51 12 he is weeks away from peak withdrawal symptoms. he is 14:09:54 13 several days away from any withdrawal symptoms at 14:09:57 14 all. 14:09:59 15 and when we ask -- i asked mrs. bishop, how is 14:09:59 16 he acting? did you see any difference to his 14:10:03 17 personality? she did not report any withdrawal 14:10:06 18 symptoms. she did not say he was climbing the walls 14:10:08 19 or irritable or anxious. 14:10:10 20 so he goes to see the doctor. what else is 14:10:13 21 going on at this point in his life? the warning 14:10:17 22 labels have been on the packages for almost ten 14:10:20 23 years. he is got the information from mrs. bishop 14:10:22 24 for almost ten years, perhaps more, that smoking is 14:10:28 25 bad for him. 14:10:31 1 people are saying things to him like you have got 14:10:32 2 to stop smoking. it is killing you. he is saying to 14:10:34 3 other people, i know. he is telling his own 14:10:37 4 children, who are born by this time, you should not 14:10:42 5 smoke because it is bad for you. this is all before 14:10:45 6 he makes this decision. no nicotine, no withdrawal, 14:10:48 7 he knows the risk. he is telling other people about 14:10:51 8 the risks. and he is 34 years old. 14:10:53 9 you heard a lot of evidence about teenage 14:10:58 10 brains and allegations about marketing to young 14:11:01 11 people. he is not a young person. he does not have a 14:11:04 12 teenage brain at age -- i'm sorry, 34. he is a grown 14:11:07 13 man. he is been in the air force. he is got a wife 14:11:12 14 and a family and a job and a rising, promising 14:11:16 15 career. 14:11:19 16 so what does he do with knowledge of the risks, 14:11:20 17 no nicotine in his system, no withdrawal and an -- a 14:11:23 18 personalized concern about what smoking might be 14:11:28 19 doing to himself? he goes back to smoking. 14:11:31 20 now, there was a lot of argument here about 14:11:34 21 character, and i do not want there to be any 14:11:39 22 suggestion that i or ms. gallagher or anyone else is 14:11:41 23 criticizing mr. ramsay. we are not. we have not 14:11:43 24 sued anybody. 14:11:47 25 there are lots of people who make the choice to 14:11:49 1 smoke, who have no nicotine in their system, who 14:11:52 2 are not addicted, have no withdrawal and who are old 14:11:55 3 enough to make that decision, as mr. ramsay was when 14:11:58 4 he did this. 14:12:00 5 so the question that you should be asking 14:12:02 6 yourself is: what would mr. ramsay have done if it 14:12:05 7 was not the nicotine, if it was not the withdrawal, if 14:12:08 8 it was not a teenage brain, if it was not ignorance of 14:12:11 9 the risk? 14:12:14 10 he made the same type of adult informed 14:12:15 11 decision that millions of people did then and do 14:12:18 12 now. and he chose, instead of going the route of 14:12:22 13 being a nonsmoker, to going back to being a smoker. 14:12:26 14 now, mr. berg said to you that while he had 14:12:29 15 stopped smoking, he went back to smoking because he 14:12:33 16 could not stop. mrs. bishop tried to tell you the 14:12:36 17 same thing in answer to one of your question. why 14:12:40 18 did he go back to smoking after three and a half 14:12:42 19 weeks of not smoking? 14:12:44 20 and the answer was something like, well, he 14:12:46 21 could not stop. but he had already stopped. whether 14:12:49 22 mr. ramsay wanted to or not, this was not about 14:12:51 23 motivation. he was off cigarettes because of what 14:12:54 24 happened to his collapsed lung. 14:12:57 25 what is important is that he went back to 14:12:59 1 smoking and why he went back to smoking. and it is 14:13:02 2 not for any of the reasons that they have been talking 14:13:05 3 to you about in this trial. 14:13:07 4 the fact of the matter is mr. ramsay made a 14:13:09 5 personal choice to be a smoker, and there is no 14:13:14 6 reason that he ever would have made any other choice 14:13:17 7 until in the late 1980s he decided to quit. 14:13:21 8 now, mr. clark then talked to you about what 14:13:24 9 mr. ramsay did in the late '80s to try to quit. and 14:13:30 10 he was right about that part of it. mr. ramsay made 14:13:33 11 a plan. he made an asserted effort. he stopped 14:13:36 12 smoking around mrs. bishop. he stopped smoking in 14:13:39 13 the house. he stopped smoking in his office. he 14:13:41 14 stopped smoking on the floor and in the building. 14:13:44 15 all of those things. 14:13:46 16 then mr. clark said, well, why did not 14:13:47 17 mr. ramsay do that earlier? and he said, who knows? 14:13:51 18 that was mr. clark's answer to that question, who 14:13:58 19 knows. who knows why he did not try earlier? well, 14:13:58 20 you know. because you saw the evidence of it. i 14:14:01 21 want to show you some of it. 14:14:04 22 can i have that slide, please? 14:14:06 23 the reason he did not try those things earlier 14:14:12 24 is because he was not really interested in quitting. 14:14:14 25 remember mike criscitiello? he was his coworker who 14:14:16 1 had been through the process of quitting smoking. 14:14:21 2 and he said to mr. ramsay, if i can quit, you can 14:14:21 3 quit. 14:14:24 4 mr. ramsay did not say back to him, oh, i do not 14:14:26 5 believe that. there is a controversy. the tobacco 14:14:29 6 companies are telling me to doubt all of this. he 14:14:32 7 just stared at him. 14:14:35 8 when his daughter, jennifer hardman, said to 14:14:37 9 him smoking is not good for you, he did not say back 14:14:40 10 to her, i do not believe that. the tobacco companies 14:14:43 11 are telling me it is safe. he said, i know. 14:14:44 12 when mrs. bishop was telling him smoking is 14:14:48 13 killing you, i wish you would stop smoking, he just 14:14:50 14 puffed away. he was not interested in quitting 14:14:53 15 smoking. 14:14:56 16 can i have the next one? 14:14:57 17 that is what he was saying. what was he doing? 14:15:00 18 did he really try to quit? 14:15:04 19 mr. criscitiello, once again, he knew what it 14:15:06 20 took to quit smoking because he did it. and 14:15:09 21 mr. fiorta asked him, well, you saw him, what was he 14:15:11 22 doing? was he really interested in quitting? and 14:15:14 23 he told you no. he really probably was not serious 14:15:16 24 about really wanting to quit smoking. 14:15:19 25 his daughter admitted he could have tried 14:15:21 1 earlier and more often. and even mrs. bishop, who 14:15:23 2 is asking you for money in this case, said he could 14:15:28 3 have made additional efforts or attempts to quit. 14:15:30 4 he was not at a point in his life before 1988 14:15:33 5 where he was ready and committed to quitting. and 14:15:38 6 then in 1988, think about this. what really 14:15:40 7 changed? the argument was made that if only he had 14:15:44 8 known something else in 1974. if only the doctor 14:15:48 9 had said to him, you know, your collapsed lung was 14:15:52 10 because of the smoking. you need to quit. 14:15:56 11 in 1988 he did not have new information. he 14:15:58 12 did not read some study that led -- that suddenly 14:16:01 13 made him think it is true. i've been saying it is 14:16:04 14 true all these years, but now i believe it is true. 14:16:06 15 that is not what happened. 14:16:08 16 what happened in 1988, if you remember, 14:16:10 17 mr. ramsay had a grandchild. and he wanted to be 14:16:12 18 there for his grandchild's graduation from college, 14:16:16 19 and now he had a motivation that he did not have 14:16:20 20 before. 14:16:22 21 mr. berg tried to tell you that this fork in 14:16:23 22 the road that mr. ramsay had in 1974 was because he 14:16:26 23 did not know the risks. that is not it. he did know 14:16:30 24 the risks. what he did not have was the motivation 14:16:32 25 to remain a nonsmoker, even though he knew that 14:16:35 1 information. 14:16:39 2 so then the question becomes from the verdict 14:16:40 3 form, if you take away nicotine addiction, would he 14:16:43 4 still have gotten sick? well, what do we know? we 14:16:47 5 know what the effect of mr. ramsay's personal choice 14:16:50 6 was. it is what dr. villa told you about that i just 14:16:53 7 went up there and sat down in his seat. 14:16:56 8 if he had -- if mr. ramsay had made a different 14:16:59 9 choice in 1974, more likely than not, he would not 14:17:01 10 have gotten lung cancer. that was not a choice that 14:17:05 11 reynolds or philip morris or any tobacco company 14:17:08 12 could make for mr. ramsay. 14:17:10 13 as dr. hurt said -- and we will see the slide -- 14:17:14 14 only the smoker can decide when to quit smoking. 14:17:17 15 all right. let us go back to the verdict form. 14:17:24 16 no, no. back one. back. 14:17:29 17 the answer to question no. 1 should be no. the 14:17:32 18 answer should be no. because their allegation that 14:17:38 19 addiction is a substantial and continuous reason why 14:17:41 20 mr. ramsay smoked enough to get lung cancer just 14:17:45 21 does not hold up. 14:17:47 22 take away the nicotine, take away the 14:17:48 23 addiction, take away all of that, mr. ramsay still 14:17:51 24 is choosing to smoke. 14:17:54 25 now, you will see on the verdict form that if you 14:17:56 1 answer no to question no. 1, your work is actually 14:18:03 2 done. you do not have to go through the rest of the 14:18:07 3 verdict form. and that is why both of us have spent 14:18:09 4 so much time on this first question, and i think why 14:18:11 5 both of us have spent so much time on the decision 14:18:14 6 that adult mr. ramsay made in 1974. 14:18:17 7 but it is my job to talk to you about the rest 14:18:20 8 of the verdict form, and you heard a lot of evidence 14:18:23 9 about the other issues too. so i want to talk to 14:18:25 10 you about some of the other questions now. 14:18:27 11 can i have the next question? 14:18:29 12 was smoking cigarettes manufactured by each 14:18:31 13 defendant a legal cause of robert ramsay's lung 14:18:34 14 cancer and death? 14:18:36 15 now, this is an interesting question because in 14:18:37 16 this case you heard about some of the brands and you 14:18:41 17 have to answer this question for each company. so 14:18:44 18 you heard in this case about some of the brands that 14:18:47 19 were made by reynolds, like winston and vantage. 14:18:49 20 and some of the brands that were made by philip 14:18:54 21 morris. you heard some evidence that he smoked 14:18:56 22 those brands. but you also heard that those were not 14:18:58 23 the only brands that mr. ramsay smoked. 14:19:00 24 and the evidence was far from clear about what 14:19:03 25 the other brands were, how much he smoked, and for 14:19:06 1 how long he smoked them. 14:19:09 2 you might remember when mrs. bishop was on the 14:19:12 3 stand, she told you, well, i was never really a 14:19:14 4 smoker so i cannot really tell you exactly what 14:19:17 5 brands he was smoking. i cannot really tell you 14:19:20 6 exactly how much he was smoking. when i first met 14:19:22 7 him, he only smoked on weekends. i really do not 14:19:26 8 know how much he smoked. and then even after we 14:19:28 9 were married, he always bought his own cigarettes. 14:19:31 10 i do not really know how much he smoked. 14:19:32 11 plaintiffs have given you some medical records 14:19:35 12 that say in total, he smoked this amount or that 14:19:37 13 amount, but you have no evidence about how much of 14:19:40 14 reynolds smoking he did and when. and the same for 14:19:44 15 philip morris. 14:19:48 16 even when one of you asked mrs. bishop the 14:19:48 17 question about what brands she bought him, like when 14:19:53 18 he was on vacation and he quit for -- or he sort of 14:19:57 19 stopped for a couple of days and she would buy him 14:20:00 20 cigarettes, and one of you asked her, well, what 14:20:03 21 about these cigarettes that you bought then? what 14:20:05 22 did you buy? she said, well, maybe vantage, maybe 14:20:07 23 merit. and i stood up and i said, now, are you 14:20:11 24 really sure those are the ones that you bought? and 14:20:13 25 she said, i'm not sure. i'm really just guessing. 14:20:16 1 there is really no hardcore evidence about how 14:20:18 2 much he was smoking of these brands. if we look at 14:20:23 3 her interrogatory responses, the questions she 14:20:27 4 answered before trial where she swore under oath 14:20:27 5 that her answers were true, and it was all over the 14:20:29 6 map. it was like 20 different brands. and for 14:20:32 7 vantage and merit it just said like various times. 14:20:35 8 merit, various times. 14:20:38 9 the evidence in this case just is not clear 14:20:43 10 about how much of reynolds' brands or philip morris' 14:20:45 11 brands he smoked. and when dr. villa took the 14:20:48 12 stand, he was never even asked. nobody asked 14:20:50 13 dr. villa. it is their burden of proof. they did not 14:20:55 14 ask dr. villa, if you take away the r.j. reynolds 14:20:57 15 smoking, would mr. ramsay have gotten ill? 14:21:02 16 you never heard the answer to that question. 14:21:06 17 you never heard the same question for philip morris. 14:21:09 18 what he said was, the total amount of smoking all 14:21:12 19 brands for all times, according to dr. villa, caused 14:21:16 20 the lung cancer. that does not allow you to answer 14:21:19 21 this question on the verdict form. 14:21:22 22 so we would ask if you even reach this 14:21:26 23 question, that you find that the plaintiff has not 14:21:33 24 met her burden of proof and that no be checked for 14:21:36 25 both defendants. 14:21:39 1 okay. let us go to the next questions. and i'm 14:21:41 2 going to take a few of these at the same time 14:21:43 3 because there is some similar issues on these. 14:21:45 4 again, you can see that mr. ramsay is in every 14:21:47 5 question, and what is being asked here is "please 14:21:51 6 state whether mr. ramsay reasonably relied to his 14:21:53 7 detriment on any statement by r.j. reynolds that 14:21:56 8 concealed or omitted material information concerning 14:22:01 9 the health effects and/or addictive nature of 14:22:02 10 smoking cigarettes, and if so, whether such reliance 14:22:05 11 was a legal cause of his death." 14:22:08 12 there are a couple of things i think you can 14:22:11 13 focus on that will make your job on this question a 14:22:14 14 lot easier. there are two parts in each question. 14:22:17 15 reasonably relied to his detriment in a statement by 14:22:21 16 r.j. reynolds or a statement by philip morris. 14:22:24 17 in fact, can we have the next? 14:22:26 18 you will see that questions 5 and 6 on the 14:22:29 19 verdict form are very similar, the same 14:22:32 20 requirements. reasonably relied to his detriment 14:22:35 21 and a statement made in furtherance of reynolds or 14:22:37 22 philip morris u.s.a.'s agreement. 14:22:40 23 what does all of that boil down to? two 14:22:43 24 questions. for every statement that they are saying 14:22:45 25 that we should be held liable for, you should be 14:22:48 1 asking yourselves two questions. who said it? who 14:22:51 2 made the statement? and did mr. ramsay rely on that 14:22:55 3 statement? 14:22:59 4 and i want to start with the first question of 14:23:00 5 who said it, because you saw many, many statements 14:23:03 6 in this trial made by all sorts of different people. 14:23:07 7 you saw statements by newscasters. you saw 14:23:11 8 statements made by government officials like the 14:23:14 9 surgeon general. you saw statements about smoking 14:23:16 10 made by public -- people in the public health 14:23:19 11 community like cuyler hammond at the american cancer 14:23:22 12 society and others. 14:23:26 13 you saw some statements made by tobacco company 14:23:27 14 employees. and we are going to talk about those. 14:23:30 15 and you saw some statements that were made on behalf 14:23:32 16 of groups representing the tobacco companies. 14:23:35 17 so these questions that say statement by 14:23:38 18 reynolds, statement by pm, they are going to require 14:23:41 19 you to think about whatever their allegations of 14:23:44 20 fraud are, who said it? who actually said it? and 14:23:47 21 i want to give you an example of why that is 14:23:51 22 important. 14:23:53 23 mr. clark said during his closing, he said a 14:23:54 24 couple of times rjr and pm put out there that the 14:23:58 25 filters were safer. he said we were out in the 14:24:03 1 public saying that filters were safer. 14:24:06 2 that is -- that is an example of where it is going 14:24:09 3 to be really important for you to look at whether or 14:24:11 4 not we actually said that. it seems simple. 14:24:15 5 um, first off, it is possible because they have 14:24:18 6 this argument that mr. ramsay thought that low-tar, 14:24:25 7 low-nicotine cigarettes were safer. maybe he did 14:24:27 8 think that. maybe he did. 14:24:31 9 but the question that you have to answer for 14:24:33 10 yourselves is did he think that because of something 14:24:36 11 that we said? because of something that he heard 14:24:37 12 that was in furtherance of a conspiracy or that we 14:24:41 13 said. and you are going to see that is just not the 14:24:44 14 case. 14:24:47 15 i want to show you some examples of what they 14:24:48 16 put in evidence. we are into their fraud case now. 14:24:51 17 remember mr. clark said we put out there that 14:24:54 18 filters were safer. let us look at what they 14:24:57 19 actually put in. 14:25:01 20 can i have the next one? 14:25:01 21 these are some of the ads, and i went through 14:25:03 22 each and every one of these ads with dr. cummings, i 14:25:05 23 think. and he agreed with me that there is not a 14:25:07 24 single one of these ads that says anything about 14:25:11 25 filters or low-tar cigarettes being safer. 14:25:14 1 you will not find safe. you will not find safer. 14:25:18 2 you will not find less hazardous. you will not find less 14:25:20 3 harmful. you will not find any of that. 14:25:24 4 and even after dr. cummings got off the stand, 14:25:26 5 plaintiffs came back and they put in a few more 14:25:28 6 stacks of ads. there is a big stack of ads in there 14:25:31 7 that they put in there. look through as many of 14:25:34 8 them as you want. you will not find safe, safer, 14:25:36 9 less harmful, or anything like that in there. 14:25:39 10 mr. clark argued that we put out there that 14:25:43 11 the -- that filtered and low-tar cigarettes were 14:25:46 12 safer. that is a great argument. except for the 14:25:48 13 fact that it does not square with the facts. it 14:25:51 14 does not square with the evidence. then they showed 14:25:55 15 you some commercials. 14:25:57 16 actually, let me see the next dem first, 14:25:58 17 please. 14:26:01 18 these were the vantage and merit ads. i went 14:26:01 19 through all six of these. nothing in there about 14:26:05 20 safe or safer. it is all about flavor and taste. 14:26:07 21 then they show a commercial for vantage. do we 14:26:11 22 have that? listen for it and see if you hear 14:26:14 23 anything about safe or safer. 14:26:18 24 (on video.) 14:26:18 25 * * * * 14:26:24 1 (music.) 14:26:24 2 male speaker: until now, many smokers have 14:26:28 3 found that high-flavor cigarettes have been high-tar 14:26:30 4 cigarettes. until now, as cigarette tar went down, 14:26:35 5 cigarette taste went down. 14:26:37 6 until now, the flavor stopped here. 14:26:38 7 but now there is vantage. the full flavor 14:26:42 8 breakthrough cigarette with the incredible new 14:26:45 9 filter that does not cop-out on flavor. 14:26:47 10 vantage, it is on the way and it is worth waiting 14:26:50 11 for. 14:26:54 12 (video concluded.) 14:17:05 13 * * * * 14:26:56 14 mr. walker: now, looking at who said it, the 14:26:56 15 companies are saying flavor, taste. if you want 14:26:59 16 flavor, if you want taste, here's our brands. 14:27:02 17 they are low-tar, low-nicotine brands with flavor. 14:27:05 18 here they are. 14:27:08 19 there were people out there saying that 14:27:09 20 low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes were safer. it 14:27:11 21 just was not us. the public health community, people 14:27:14 22 that dr. cummings and all of the witnesses said, no, 14:27:17 23 they are not in any conspiracy with the tobacco 14:27:23 24 companies. cuyler hammond at the american cancer 14:27:25 25 society, they were not part of any conspiracy with 14:27:27 1 reynolds or philip morris. they did not work for 14:27:30 2 philip morris or reynolds. 14:27:32 3 let us look at what they were telling the public 14:27:34 4 about filters and low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes. 14:27:35 5 can i have the next dem? 14:27:38 6 this is the american cancer society. not 14:27:40 7 reynolds, not philip morris, not any alleged 14:27:44 8 coconspirator. if you do smoke cigarettes, you 14:27:48 9 should know the relative amounts of nicotine and tar 14:27:50 10 in your cigarettes as determined by the federal 14:27:51 11 trade commission. 14:27:54 12 the less tar and nicotine you inhale, the 14:27:55 13 better. 14:27:59 14 was the message out there? yes. were we the 14:28:00 15 ones putting it out there like mr. clark said we 14:28:03 16 were? absolutely not. 14:28:06 17 can i have the next one, please? 14:28:07 18 this is the u.s. department of health, 14:28:09 19 education, and welfare, a pamphlet: "how to take 14:28:13 20 some of the danger out of smoking." 14:28:16 21 "choose a cigarette with less tar and nicotine. 14:28:17 22 the difference between brands can be more than two 14:28:20 23 to one." if mr. ramsay thought that low-tar and 14:28:22 24 low-nicotine cigarettes were safer, what is more 14:28:27 25 likely? that he got that from our ads talking about 14:28:30 1 taste and flavor or that he got it from pamphlets 14:28:33 2 and other information from the public health 14:28:37 3 community like this that expressly said, "choose a 14:28:39 4 cigarette with less tar and less nicotine." 14:28:42 5 and then there were the public service 14:28:45 6 announcements that mrs. bishop said she knows were 14:28:47 7 being run. she saw some of them. 14:28:50 8 can we have that? just one example. 14:28:52 9 (on video.) 14:28:54 10 male speaker: we have a little wisdom for 14:28:56 11 smokers. starting at the bitter end. the first 14:28:58 12 puffs are not enough, but those last are the 14:29:03 13 deadliest of all. (inaudible) you smoke are the 14:29:08 14 tars and nicotine and the (inaudible). a big rotten 14:29:08 15 accumulation, and you can actually end up 14:29:14 16 (inaudible). 14:29:16 17 the more tar and nicotine you start off with, 14:29:18 18 the more you end up with. and you can buy yourself 14:29:20 19 118 different packs of trouble. up to 31 milligrams 14:29:25 20 of tar; up to 2.2 milligrams of nicotine. there is 14:29:29 21 no such thing as a harmless cigarette. 14:29:34 22 but the low-tar/nicotine cigarette can save you 14:29:37 23 a little. and if you are still smoking, that is 14:29:41 24 better than nothing. we have got a tar/nicotine 14:29:44 25 (inaudible). it is free (inaudible) right now." 14:29:48 1 (video concluded.) 14:29:53 2 * * * * 14:29:54 3 mr. walker: that is the united states public 14:29:54 4 health service. it is not a commercial for vantage 14:29:57 5 or a commercial for merit or anything at all put out 14:29:59 6 by a tobacco company. 14:30:01 7 it is easy to attack cigarette companies. it is 14:30:03 8 easy to do that. but they should not be attacked for 14:30:08 9 statements they did not make. 14:30:12 10 the next question, then, is once you have gotten 14:30:15 11 past who actually made the statements, then you have 14:30:20 12 got to think about -- 14:30:22 13 can i have the next dem? 14:30:23 14 -- whether mr. ramsay relied, and there are a 14:30:26 15 couple of things i want to go over with you on this. 14:30:29 16 first of all, when you start to think about 14:30:32 17 whether mr. ramsay relied, consider the testimony 14:30:34 18 that you heard from mrs. bishop and others that 14:30:37 19 mr. ramsay never talked about ads, advertisements. 14:30:40 20 we heard today, and we heard while she was on the 14:30:44 21 witness stand, they talked about everything, but 14:30:48 22 they did not talk about ads. 14:30:50 23 no one heard mr. -- mrs. bishop and no one else 14:30:52 24 ever heard mr. ramsay say that a tobacco company 14:30:56 25 said that smoking vantage would help him quit. 14:31:00 1 but mrs. bishop did say that she heard public 14:31:04 2 service announcements like the one we just saw from 14:31:08 3 health, education, and welfare talking about low-tar 14:31:12 4 and low-nicotine cigarettes. she did say that she 14:31:15 5 heard public service announcements from the american 14:31:17 6 cancer society talking about low-tar and 14:31:20 7 low-nicotine cigarettes. 14:31:25 8 the bottom line is this. a couple of things: 14:31:25 9 company statements, they showed you a lot of company 14:31:35 10 statements; advertisements; and then they made these 14:31:38 11 arguments about youth market. 14:31:41 12 let us start with company statements. first of 14:31:42 13 all, dr. cummings admitted that there was no 14:31:45 14 statement in the 1950s, 1960s, or 1970s that 14:31:48 15 nicotine was not addictive. there is no evidence in 14:31:51 16 this case that mr. ramsay saw, believed, or relied 14:31:55 17 on any industry statements. you have heard and you will 14:31:58 18 continue to hear about this wallpaper effect -- 14:32:01 19 wallpaper, it is all over the place. 14:32:04 20 but remember when i asked mrs. bishop when she 14:32:05 21 was on the stand, "you are about the same age as 14:32:08 22 mr. ramsay. you grew up in the same community. did 14:32:10 23 you ever hear any of this stuff about the frank 14:32:13 24 statement or the tobacco industry research committee 14:32:16 25 or all these ads? 14:32:18 1 "no. no, i did not." 14:32:19 2 mr. ramsay never mentioned any tobacco company 14:32:21 3 organizations, and mrs. bishop had never even heard 14:32:24 4 of them. 14:32:26 5 now, the statements that they showed you from 14:32:28 6 tobacco company employees, they were all to the 14:32:32 7 effect that it was not proven that smoking causes 14:32:36 8 disease. they talked about those. they showed you 14:32:39 9 statements about how, you know, the companies, they 14:32:41 10 say, were trying to create doubt. it was not proven. 14:32:44 11 there is a controversy. there is an open debate. 14:32:46 12 but mr. ramsay never said those things to 14:32:49 13 anyone. mr. ramsay -- if mr. ramsay was relying on 14:32:51 14 statements from the companies that the risks were not 14:32:55 15 proven, why is he telling people, "i know the 14:32:57 16 risks"? if he relied on statements about it not 14:33:00 17 being injurious to health, why is he telling his 14:33:03 18 daughter and his son that they should not smoke? 14:33:06 19 it is a great argument; it just does not make any 14:33:09 20 sense for the facts of this case. 14:33:12 21 the evidence was to the contrary. the evidence 14:33:14 22 was not that mr. ramsay doubted the risk or thought 14:33:17 23 that there was some controversy about it. it was 14:33:20 24 the exact opposite. 14:33:22 25 can we have the next -- or -- oh, i see. go 14:33:24 1 back. you had it. 14:33:27 2 the evidence was that mr. ramsay did know. he 14:33:28 3 was warned by his family. he saw it on the news. 14:33:31 4 he watched walter cronkite. he read the paper in 14:33:33 5 the morning, in the evening, and on the weekends. 14:33:39 6 we showed you what was in the periodicals that 14:33:42 7 he looked at. this was all the way back in 1957 14:33:44 8 talking about higher death rates for cigarette 14:33:47 9 smokers. 14:33:49 10 the next one, please. 14:33:49 11 this is the same quote we looked at earlier 14:33:50 12 from public health officials. mr. ramsay knew. 14:33:52 13 the next one. 14:33:56 14 this is another one from the national cancer 14:33:57 15 institute. newspapers, radio, tv, and other media 14:34:00 16 have done an excellent job covering this problem and 14:34:03 17 a very objective job. this is an exceedingly 14:34:06 18 valuable way of informing the public. 14:34:08 19 next one, please. 14:34:10 20 we talked about all the magazine coverage of 14:34:11 21 it. 14:34:14 22 next one. 14:34:14 23 and the surgeon general's report and so on and 14:34:15 24 so on. 14:34:19 25 and we know that from 1966 forward, there was a 14:34:19 1 warning or a caution label about the health risks of 14:34:30 2 cigarette smoking on every single package of 14:34:34 3 cigarettes that mr. ramsay smoked. 14:34:35 4 no one ever heard mr. ramsay repeat any of the 14:34:38 5 things that they say the companies were saying on 14:34:41 6 television or anyplace else. then something 14:34:44 7 interesting happened -- and i hope you all caught 14:34:47 8 this. this was on dr. cummings's cross-examination, 14:35:18 9 and we went back and forth on a great number of 14:34:51 10 things. 14:34:53 11 but i asked dr. cummings if he had seen the 14:34:54 12 polling data where americans were actually asked 14:34:57 13 whether they were even listening to the tobacco 14:35:00 14 companies at all. 14:35:03 15 and this is what you learned when we saw that. 14:35:04 16 can i have the next one? that is not it. 14:35:06 17 okay -- no. there we go. 14:35:12 18 this is one of the examples of the roper polls 14:35:19 19 that we saw, where americans were asked, like in 14:35:21 20 1968, "who are the most reliable sources of 14:35:24 21 information on smoking and health?" this is a place 14:35:26 22 where, if the tobacco companies were duping the 14:35:29 23 american public, if everybody was listening and 14:35:32 24 relying on things that tobacco companies were saying 14:35:35 25 on tv like this bill dwyer he talked about, you 14:35:37 1 should see a high percentage of people listing the 14:35:40 2 tobacco companies as a reliable source of 14:35:44 3 information. instead, only 5 percent listed the 14:35:45 4 tobacco companies as a reliable source. 14:35:51 5 can i have the next slide? 14:35:52 6 sixty percent thought that the public health 14:35:54 7 community, the warnings that we showed you, where 14:35:59 8 dr. hammond said people should be warned and they 14:36:01 9 are being warned about the cigarettes risk, 14:36:04 10 dr. graham's coverage of the mouse-painting studies 14:36:06 11 that he did, people were listening to that 14:36:09 12 information about the health risks of cigarette 14:36:12 13 smoking. 14:36:14 14 can i have the next one? 14:36:14 15 but these are all the statements that 14:36:16 16 plaintiffs showed you in their case. anne browder, 14:36:19 17 mr. bowling, mr. cullman, mr. heimann, mr. corrigan, 14:36:22 18 they showed you all these statements by company 14:36:27 19 employees in videos, and they wanted you to think 14:36:30 20 that these people were somehow pulling the wool over 14:36:31 21 the eyes of the american people. 14:36:34 22 this survey from 1968 and all the surveys we 14:36:36 23 talked about during the case that came after it show 14:36:41 24 that is just not true. 14:36:44 25 the american public did not think that these 14:36:45 1 tobacco company employees and representatives were 14:36:48 2 reliable. people were not relying on what they said, 14:36:52 3 and neither was mr. ramsay. 14:36:55 4 in fact -- can we have the next one, please? 14:36:56 5 this is how bad it was as of 1962. this is, 14:36:59 6 like, 50 years ago or more. this is a "reader's 14:37:05 7 digest" article where the person who wrote the 14:37:09 8 article is saying, "tobacco industry spokesman 14:37:11 9 issued the standard rejoinder that the evidence was 14:37:15 10 merely old data without new research findings, but 14:37:17 11 the statements sounded weaker and more pathetic than 14:37:21 12 ever." 14:37:24 13 what did they show you? they showed you an 14:37:25 14 internal document where somebody at the tobacco 14:37:28 15 institute was patting themselves on the back about 14:37:31 16 how they had this great idea that was brilliantly 14:37:34 17 conceived. this is great. you have got the hard data 14:37:36 18 in these surveys that shows that people just were not 14:37:40 19 listening to the tobacco companies, and there is no 14:37:43 20 reason to believe that mr. ramsay was any different. 14:37:45 21 he did not rely. 14:37:48 22 then they talk about advertising. well, we have 14:37:50 23 already seen -- 14:37:54 24 can i have the next dem? 14:37:55 25 we already saw what the theme was in the 14:37:57 1 advertising. the ads were about flavor and taste 14:37:59 2 and draw, how it feels when you are smoking the 14:38:01 3 cigarettes, and some of the -- some of the ads 14:38:04 4 actually acknowledge the reports about the health 14:38:06 5 risks of cigarette smoking. 14:38:08 6 it was the public health community that was 14:38:10 7 talking about how you should quit. if you do not 14:38:12 8 quit, you should lower your tar. it still is not 14:38:15 9 safe because all cigarettes including low-tar and 14:38:19 10 low-nicotine cigarettes can cause lung cancer. 14:38:23 11 plaintiff says that you should infer, that you 14:38:25 12 should infer that mr. ramsay relied on things like 14:38:30 13 the beverly hillbillies, the flintstones, lord knows 14:38:33 14 what else. but infer that based upon what? 14:38:37 15 maybe there is some other case. maybe one of 14:38:41 16 those other 80 cases where dr. cummings testified, 14:38:44 17 maybe there is some other plaintiff in this engle 14:38:47 18 class you keep hearing about relied on that stuff, 14:38:50 19 just not mr. ramsay. there is no evidence of that in 14:38:53 20 this case. 14:38:55 21 and the last thing i want to just mention, 14:38:56 22 there have been some allegations about youth 14:38:59 23 marketing. 14:39:01 24 this idea, in fact, i think mr. clark started 14:39:02 25 off with it. very serious allegations that the 14:39:05 1 companies were out trying to hook children. 14:39:07 2 and they put in -- they had a list of a bunch 14:39:11 3 of documents that supposedly show you that. if you 14:39:14 4 were to actually look at those documents, you are 14:39:17 5 going to find that the very first document they 14:39:19 6 listed was from about 15 years before mr. ramsay was 14:39:21 7 born. sometime back in the -- maybe calvin coolidge 14:39:24 8 was president, sometime in the '30s or '20s. maybe 14:39:29 9 it was in the '20s. nothing to do with mr. ramsay. 14:39:32 10 then they have got a bunch of documents like from 14:39:35 11 the '50s where surveys are just being conducted to 14:39:37 12 find out who is smoking. "are you smoking? are you 14:39:40 13 not smoking?" 14:39:43 14 then they have got a bunch of documents from the 14:39:44 15 '70s and the '80s -- mr. ramsay, like, in his 30s 14:39:45 16 and in his 40s, a grown adult -- that are proposing 14:39:49 17 new marketing plans for the future. you will see it 14:39:54 18 in the title. new -- proposal for new brands, 14:39:57 19 proposal for new marketing. 14:40:00 20 and even those documents, those were some of 14:40:02 21 the documents we had to come back and say, "wait. 14:40:06 22 you are -- you cut out the part of it that says what 14:40:08 23 reynolds' policy actually was." 14:40:12 24 can i have the next one? 14:40:13 25 this is what got cut out in their documents. 14:40:16 1 1973. this one, we -- we made them show it to you 14:40:19 2 even while their witness was on the stand. "we 14:40:24 3 should not in any way influence nonsmokers to 14:40:26 4 start." 14:40:29 5 1975. "these terms do not accurately describe 14:40:29 6 what we are talking about." this is the one that 14:40:32 7 was introduced to suggest that somehow young adult 14:40:34 8 smoker means something other than young adult 14:40:39 9 smoker. this document shows that even before they 14:40:41 10 were putting adult in the paper, what they meant was 14:40:45 11 adults. young adult smoker. 14:40:48 12 in 1975 -- this was another document they 14:40:52 13 showed you. and -- and it talks about the target 14:40:55 14 market. remember dr. cummings said, "oh, you are 14:40:58 15 targeting people under 18." 14:41:01 16 i said, "well, dr. cummings, wait a minute. it 14:41:02 17 says right here 'primary target 18 to 34.'" 14:41:03 18 and then the last one. this was the one i told 14:41:06 19 you about in openings. and even though i told you 14:41:09 20 in openings they were going to show you this 14:41:12 21 document and not show you this part, they still show 14:41:15 22 you the document without showing you this part. you 14:41:18 23 saw this document today without this part. 14:41:20 24 and what was being missing -- what was missing? 14:41:22 25 rjr's consistent policy is that smoking is a matter 14:41:25 1 of free informed adult choice which the company does 14:41:28 2 not seek to influence. this report is intended to 14:41:33 3 provide additional learning on younger adult smokers 14:41:36 4 age 18 to 24. 14:41:39 5 what does all of that have to do with ramsay? 14:41:41 6 nothing. it has absolutely nothing to do with him. 14:41:44 7 none of those documents relates to mr. ramsay at 14:41:48 8 all. 14:41:51 9 and the answer to the questions on the verdict 14:41:51 10 form -- 14:41:54 11 do we have that? 14:41:55 12 for all of the reasons that i just went over 14:41:56 13 with you: -- who said it, did mr. ramsay rely, does 14:41:58 14 it have anything to do with mr. ramsay -- for all of 14:42:02 15 those reasons the answers to questions 3, 4, 5, and 14:42:04 16 6 should be no. 14:42:08 17 can i have the next one? 14:42:10 18 all right. the answer to these should be no as 14:42:13 19 well. 14:42:19 20 now, the next question on the verdict form. 14:42:19 21 "state the percentage of any fault that was a legal 14:42:21 22 cause of robert ramsay's death that you charge 14:42:24 23 to" -- and there are places where you can put a 14:42:27 24 percentage for each of those. the important part 14:42:30 25 is, if you notice in the question like all the other 14:42:32 1 questions, there is another reference to robert 14:42:34 2 ramsay. the only percentages that you can put down 14:42:37 3 here are things that were a legal cause of injury to 14:42:40 4 robert ramsay. 14:42:44 5 if there is some choice, some decision, some 14:42:46 6 conduct that you hear about -- and i'm sure after i 14:42:48 7 sit down and they have another chance, they will take 14:42:51 8 another run at it -- you have got to ask yourselves 14:42:53 9 whether it has something to do with robert ramsay. 14:42:56 10 would it have mattered to him? 14:42:58 11 what are the choices that actually could have 14:43:00 12 made a difference to mr. ramsay? 14:43:03 13 the choice to quit, the choice of when to quit, 14:43:05 14 the choice of how to quit, and the choice of how 14:43:10 15 hard to try to quit. 14:43:14 16 and we already know -- 14:43:16 17 can i have the next one? 14:43:19 18 -- that the plaintiffs have admitted in this 14:43:20 19 case that the acts or omissions of robert ramsay 14:43:23 20 were a partial legal cause. well, which acts or 14:43:25 21 omissions? 14:43:25 22 relating to the frequency and duration of his 14:43:30 23 efforts to quit. what did you hear about the 14:43:32 24 frequency of his efforts to quit? 14:43:35 25 once or twice a year, on vacation. 14:43:37 1 what did you hear about the duration of his 14:43:41 2 efforts to quit? a couple of days. 14:43:43 3 until the end, when he made the effort to 14:43:45 4 quit -- and you have dr. villa's testimony that if 14:43:49 5 he had stopped in the '60 or '70s, he would not have 14:43:52 6 gotten ill. 14:43:56 7 the fact of the matter is the choices that 14:43:56 8 could actually have mattered to mr. ramsay and his 14:43:59 9 health could only have been made by mr. ramsay. 14:44:03 10 mr. ramsay is one hundred percent responsible for each of 14:44:07 11 the choices that we just went through. 14:44:10 12 in fact, even if we look at what their paid 14:44:12 13 experts said about this -- look what dr. hurt said 14:44:16 14 in his pamphlet. "only you can decide when to quit 14:44:19 15 smoking." if that is true, how can reynolds be 40 14:44:23 16 percent responsible for a decision that only 14:44:27 17 mr. ramsay could have made? 14:44:30 18 what did dr. cummings say? he did not admit it 14:44:32 19 to me at first. i had to go dig out of his 14:44:35 20 testimony from all those boxes we had back there. 14:44:38 21 the smoker bears responsibility for making the 14:44:40 22 decision to try to quit. how can reynolds or philip 14:44:43 23 morris be forty percent, thirty percent, twenty percent, even 1 14:44:47 24 percent responsible for a decision that only 14:44:51 25 mr. ramsay could have made? 14:44:55 1 and, remember, mrs. bishop agreed with me that 14:44:59 2 mr. ramsay was not the type of person to blame other 14:45:02 3 people for his decisions and neither should you. 14:45:05 4 i'm not criticizing mr. ramsay. he was 14:45:08 5 entitled to make those choices, but we should not be 14:45:11 6 held responsible for them. 14:45:14 7 the evidence was, mr. ramsay was very capable 14:45:16 8 of making those decisions as well. 14:45:21 9 i'm not going to go through all of it. you all 14:45:23 10 know by now about his career, how he applied himself 14:45:25 11 at all different levels of education and in his 14:45:29 12 work. but you do know by now that he was the type 14:45:31 13 of man that if he had made that choice that dr. hurt 14:45:34 14 was talking about, that dr. cummings was talking 14:45:37 15 about, that mrs. bishop wanted him to make in 1974, 14:45:39 16 he would have accomplished in 1974 the very same 14:45:44 17 thing that he accomplished in 1988. 14:45:47 18 what are the things that did not matter to 14:45:50 19 mr. ramsay? we have talked about some of them 14:45:55 20 already, the designs. dr. villa told you. 14:45:57 21 mr. isasi went through that long list of designs. 14:46:00 22 dr. villa said, "does not matter to me." doctors 14:46:02 23 do not ask patients, "well, which cigarette product 14:46:05 24 are you smoking? does your cigarette product have 14:46:08 25 vent holes? does it have overwrap? does not matter. 14:46:10 1 none of that matters. 14:46:14 2 i'm sure it was very interesting, engaging 14:46:15 3 testimony. does it matter for this verdict form? 14:46:17 4 not a bit. 14:46:19 5 dr. hurt was asked, "well, are any brands more 14:46:20 6 addictive than other brands?" 14:46:27 7 he said, "no, they are all addictive." 14:46:29 8 those same design features, everything you 14:46:30 9 heard about ph manipulation, all that does not make 14:46:32 10 any cigarette any more or less addictive than the 14:46:34 11 other. that is why the warning labels that go on all 14:46:38 12 of these cigarettes, regardless of how they are 14:46:41 13 designed, all say the same thing. "cigarette 14:46:44 14 smoking is dangerous to your health. quitting now 14:46:47 15 reduces your risks." 14:46:50 16 okay. can we go back to the dem? 14:46:52 17 so this is why we think the evidence supports 14:47:00 18 zero percent for reynolds, zero percent for philip 14:47:04 19 morris, one hundred percent for mr. ramsay. it is not a 14:47:07 20 criticism of mr. ramsay; it is a recognition into 14:47:11 21 when we make choices, we bear responsibility for the 14:47:14 22 choices that we make. 14:47:17 23 now -- can we take that down? 14:47:19 24 the next question on the verdict form -- i 14:47:21 25 guess the next few questions relate to damages. and 14:47:26 1 you all know this about me because i've been saying 14:47:29 2 it since jury selection. we do not believe this is a 14:47:32 3 case where damages should be awarded. we just 14:47:34 4 do not. i was upfront with you all -- with all of 14:47:37 5 you about that from the very beginning. quite 14:47:40 6 frankly, you should not even get to the question 14:47:42 7 about damages because of the no answers that come 14:47:44 8 before that. 14:47:48 9 but i will say this: that figure that mr. berg 14:47:48 10 threw out, $5 million, $5 million to the wife of a 14:47:52 11 man who made adult, informed, knowing choices to 14:47:59 12 smoke. where does that number come from? it is just 14:48:03 13 pulled out of thin air, just $5 million sounded like 14:48:06 14 a round number and that is -- that was the number you 14:48:09 15 got. there is no basis for that. and no damages 14:48:12 16 should be awarded in this case. 14:48:15 17 there is one last question on the verdict form 14:48:16 18 that it is my job to talk to you about, and that is 14:48:21 19 this question about punitive damages. 14:48:24 20 and i guess what i want to do first is just 14:48:26 21 talk to you a little bit about punitive damages 14:48:30 22 generally. 14:48:31 23 what are punitive damages? 14:48:33 24 first of all, punitive damages can only be 14:48:35 25 awarded for conduct that caused mr. ramsay's illness 14:48:38 1 and death. if that conduct that injured mr. ramsay 14:48:41 2 also injured somebody else, you can take that into 14:48:45 3 consideration under the judge's instructions. but 14:48:47 4 you can only punish for conduct that actually harmed 14:48:49 5 mr. ramsay. 14:48:53 6 so, for example, dr. cummings, remember, showed 14:48:54 7 you a document from claude teague. this is young 14:48:57 8 claude teague, 20 years old, second job. in 1953 he 14:49:00 9 writes a memo that says something about changing the 14:49:05 10 color of the filters. 14:49:07 11 then when i asked dr. cummings, i said, "hey, 14:49:09 12 did anybody ever use that? did that idea about 14:49:11 13 changing the colors of the filters ever get put into 14:49:14 14 a product?" 14:49:17 15 "no. no, it did not." 14:49:18 16 that is an example of something that we cannot be 14:49:19 17 punished for because it could not ever have hurt 14:49:21 18 mr. ramsay. it was never even used in the 14:49:24 19 cigarettes. punitive damages can only be awarded to 14:49:27 20 mrs. bishop, and they are in addition to, that means 14:49:29 21 on top of, damages that fully compensate mrs. 14:49:32 22 bishop. 14:49:37 23 punitive damages are simply more money. 14:49:37 24 and -- can i have the next slide? 14:49:45 25 the standard for awarding punitive damages is 14:49:48 1 much higher. you have already heard the judge mention 14:49:51 2 in his instructions about the greater weight of the 14:49:54 3 evidence, what are -- what is going on with the -- 14:49:57 4 whether the scale is being tipped. clear and 14:50:00 5 convincing evidence is actually the highest standard 14:50:02 6 that exists in civil law. 14:50:04 7 it requires evidence that is more than the 14:50:07 8 greater weight of the evidence. evidence that is 14:50:12 9 more compelling, more persuasive, and evidence that 14:50:13 10 is precise, explicit, lacking in confusion, and of 14:50:18 11 such weight that it produces in you folks a firm 14:50:22 12 belief or conviction about the matter at issue. and 14:50:26 13 you are just not going to see that, because what is 14:50:29 14 really being asked here is, what are we being 14:50:32 15 punished for that hurt mr. ramsay? 14:50:35 16 we should not be punished, for example, for 14:50:38 17 making filtered cigarettes. the evidence in this 14:50:40 18 case was that the public health community, people 14:50:44 19 like dr. -- i think it was dr. wynder or dr. graham 14:50:48 20 recommended that the companies make filtered 14:50:53 21 cigarettes. we should not be punished for responding 14:50:55 22 to something the health community suggested that we 14:50:59 23 do. 14:51:01 24 we should not be punished for making low-tar, 14:51:02 25 low-nicotine cigarettes the public health community 14:51:05 1 also asked for that. for years and years and years, 14:51:07 2 decades, the public health community genuinely 14:51:11 3 thought people who were not part of anybody's 14:51:15 4 conspiracy believed that lower-tar and 14:51:17 5 lower-nicotine cigarettes would be safer for 14:51:19 6 smokers. and we met that recommendation by selling 14:51:24 7 those cigarettes. we should not be punished for 14:51:27 8 that. 14:51:29 9 there is a suggestion that we should be punished 14:51:29 10 for nicotine manipulation; ph levels and all that. 14:51:32 11 but then, when dr. henningfield was here, he 14:51:35 12 admitted, again, we did not need to call a witness 14:51:38 13 for this, dr. henningfield admitted that back in 14:51:40 14 those days, people thought you could make a safer 14:51:43 15 cigarette by changing the nicotine yield of 14:51:46 16 cigarettes. and he has his own product that he 14:51:48 17 admits manipulates nicotine levels. 14:51:52 18 it is not reprehensible conduct, it is not 14:51:58 19 punishable conduct to have an opinion that other 14:52:00 20 people had in the 1950s. 14:52:03 21 you were shown the frank statement, and 14:52:06 22 mr. clark told you that the sentence that said there 14:52:10 23 are many possible causes of lung cancer? he said 14:52:13 24 that that was not true. 14:52:15 25 well, dr. cummings said that was true at that 14:52:17 1 time. 14:52:21 2 mr. clark said that the sentence that said 14:52:21 3 there was no agreement among authorities regarding 14:52:24 4 the cause of lung cancer? he said that that was a 14:52:26 5 lie. 14:52:28 6 except that their witness, the million-dollar 14:52:29 7 man, dr. cummings, he said that was true at the time 14:52:32 8 that we made it. 14:52:35 9 and we did not just leave it at what 14:52:36 10 dr. cummings said. we actually showed you some of 14:52:38 11 the statements that people in the public health 14:52:40 12 community were making in like 1953, 1954, 1955. 14:52:42 13 the statement of cuyler hammond at the american 14:52:46 14 cancer society, the statement of dr. kuper 14:52:49 15 [phonetic] at the national cancer institute, these 14:52:51 16 were people who were not selling cigarettes. they 14:52:55 17 did not -- they were not out to try to persuade or 14:52:56 18 defraud anybody. these were people who looked at 14:53:00 19 the same publically-available materials that young 14:53:03 20 dr. teague did in the library and came to a 14:53:05 21 different conclusion. 14:53:08 22 the reality is, in the 1950s, '53, '54, '55, 14:53:10 23 when the frank statement came out, there were lots 14:53:14 24 of well-meaning people who -- scientists, who had 14:53:19 25 not made up their minds based on the science that, 14:53:22 1 um -- that the link had been established. 14:53:26 2 and in spite of that, the public was still 14:53:29 3 being warned. while the scientists were trying to 14:53:32 4 figure out whether the evidence was enough for them, 14:53:35 5 the public was being warned. 14:53:37 6 reynolds and philip morris should not be 14:53:40 7 punished for funding research. 14:53:42 8 remember -- do we have that -- can we have the 14:53:44 9 next slide? 14:53:47 10 this is some of the research that was funded 14:53:48 11 with money from reynolds and philip morris. we 14:53:51 12 should not be punished for that. 14:53:54 13 can i have the next one? 14:53:56 14 we should not be punished for funding research 14:53:58 15 by nobel prize-winning researchers. we should not be 14:54:00 16 punished for putting out the green monster. 14:54:05 17 remember that green book? you saw it a couple of 14:54:08 18 times, and i put it down on the table. it made kind 14:54:10 19 of a thud. that was the one with 6,000 articles 14:54:14 20 made available to the public about the health risks 14:54:16 21 of cigarette smoking and anything related to 14:54:19 22 cigarette smoking. 14:54:21 23 we showed you the article by knapp, k-n-a-p-p, 14:54:21 24 in 1963 that the companies funded that concluded 14:54:25 25 with tobacco-funded research that nicotine was 14:54:29 1 addictive. 14:54:32 2 we talked to you about the research that 14:54:33 3 dr. rodgman at reynolds did, where he was coming up 14:54:36 4 and inventing new ways to really figure out what was 14:54:38 5 in cigarette smoke. this was at a time in the '50s 14:54:41 6 and '60s where people did not know. reynolds 14:54:44 7 developed that technology, published on it and told 14:54:46 8 everybody about it. 14:54:49 9 we should not be punished for recommending -- 14:54:51 10 this is really, really important. we should not -- 14:54:54 11 do we have a slide on this -- for recommending 14:54:57 12 against the adoption of the ftc machine method. 14:55:01 13 you have heard a lot of accusations that made it 14:55:05 14 sound like testing low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes 14:55:07 15 on a machine like that was our idea; that the 14:55:14 16 companies came up with that. 14:55:16 17 but we showed you in 1966 when the federal 14:55:20 18 trade commission was considering doing this, the 14:55:22 19 companies said, do not do this. the machine method 14:55:23 20 will not reflect what smokers actually get. 14:55:27 21 the thing they are telling you that we were 14:55:30 22 fraudulent about, we told the ftc in 1966 when this 14:55:32 23 was being adopted that that could happen. and the 14:55:36 24 ftc made the decision to adopt that -- that method 14:55:40 25 against our recommendations. 14:55:44 1 the companies should not be punished for trying 14:55:48 2 to make cigarettes safer. there were a lot of 14:55:51 3 accusations made about the character of the 14:55:54 4 companies. the fact of the matter is these 14:55:58 5 companies were made up of people who were well 14:55:59 6 meaning just like a lot of other well-meaning 14:56:02 7 people. 14:56:04 8 i want to show you just one example that was in 14:56:04 9 evidence. 14:56:07 10 look at this letter from galloway to sinkus 14:56:08 11 [phonetic]. this is the president of r.j. reynolds 14:56:12 12 in 1968 to the top research scientist at the 14:56:14 13 company. "areas of special interest: in 14:56:16 14 cooperating with others, you should push the work 14:56:20 15 concerning tobacco and health. you should prepare a 14:56:22 16 plan to foster any relationship with government 14:56:25 17 personnel in the quest for mutual understanding of 14:56:28 18 facts ultimately to gain their cooperation in proper 14:56:31 19 research of the subject." 14:56:35 20 remember when -- keep that up for one second. 14:56:36 21 remember when, i do not know if it was mr. berg 14:56:40 22 or mr. clark said there is no document that shows 14:56:42 23 that the company cared about their consumers? there 14:56:44 24 is no document that suggests that reynolds cares 14:56:46 25 about smokers? 14:56:48 1 look at this. 14:56:49 2 "if there is a safer cigarette, let us continue 14:56:50 3 and increase our efforts in this program. 14:56:53 4 "please prepare a plan to carry it out." 14:56:56 5 this document was not written with the idea that 14:56:59 6 this was going to end up in somebody's newspaper. 14:57:01 7 this is the same kind of secret, internal document 14:57:04 8 that they have been talking about all this time. and 14:57:07 9 this came right before the ten years long effort by 14:57:09 10 scientists from reynolds and scientists from philip 14:57:15 11 morris working with the government to try to come up 14:57:17 12 with a safer cigarette. 14:57:20 13 you heard an allegation that the filtered 14:57:24 14 products that we made, that the public health 14:57:25 15 community asked for, mr. clark or mr. berg said that 14:57:27 16 was a gimmick, that was a gimmick. 14:57:29 17 well, what did dr. henningfield say? 14:57:31 18 the nine -- the nine -- that $925 an hour? this is 14:57:33 19 what he said. 14:57:36 20 do we have that? 14:57:37 21 dr. henningfield, at $15 a minute, said, "if 14:57:39 22 you go back before that to the days when cigarettes 14:57:51 23 were nonfiltered, i think it is likely that for an 14:57:54 24 individual a filter would be better than nonfilter. 14:57:57 25 that is my own opinion." 14:58:01 1 that is dr. henningfield whose evidence tells 14:58:03 2 you filters were not a gimmick. 14:58:07 3 can i have the next slide, please? go back. 14:58:11 4 just one second. . . all right. 14:58:23 5 here's something you should really, really 14:58:27 6 think about, about vantage cigarettes. this is 14:58:29 7 really interesting and i think really important. 14:58:32 8 the evidence in this case was that the public 14:58:35 9 health community asked the companies to develop 14:58:38 10 cigarettes that would deliver lower tar. 14:58:41 11 at reynolds, when we were -- when they were 14:58:44 12 working on the vantage cigarettes, they developed a 14:58:46 13 new filter that scientists inside of reynolds, in 14:58:49 14 internal secret documents, said to each other that 14:58:53 15 they believed was a better filter than was available 14:58:58 16 on the market. 14:59:01 17 can i have the next slide, please? 14:59:02 18 actually, let us take a look at this. 14:59:06 19 again, remember, the accusation: there is no 14:59:16 20 secret, internal document that says the companies 14:59:20 21 cared about smokers. 14:59:22 22 this was the vantage technology document that 14:59:24 23 you saw and that was shown to dr. henningfield, 14:59:26 24 their design expert. 14:59:29 25 what -- you see it? 14:59:31 1 here's what it says: "the vantage cigarette 14:59:34 2 introduced in april 1970 almost met the original 14:59:36 3 objective of the coanda filter. that is, it 14:59:40 4 provided a novel filter with substantially better 14:59:43 5 filtration than the standard winston filter without 14:59:46 6 unacceptable pressure drop increase." 14:59:51 7 okay. 14:59:53 8 "a presentation to management was held in the 14:59:54 9 research department on november 18th, 1968. there 14:59:58 10 it was reported that the multijet filter showed 60 15:00:01 11 percent tar removal from cigarette smoke as compared 15:00:04 12 to forty percent tar removal by the winston filter at 15:00:08 13 the same pressure drop of two inches." 15:00:11 14 what does all that mean? this was a better 15:00:14 15 filter that was going to be used in the vantage 15:00:16 16 cigarettes, and this is what the scientists at 15:00:19 17 reynolds genuinely thought. this document was just 15:00:23 18 as secret as all the other documents they were 15:00:25 19 talking about. 15:00:28 20 these two paragraphs are talking about the 15:00:28 21 performance of the filter on the machine. 15:00:31 22 but look at what else is in this document? 15:00:33 23 "a second presentation to management was held 15:00:36 24 at research on june 18, 1969. 15:00:38 25 "there, it was reported that the laboratory 15:00:41 1 multijet filter did, indeed, reduce the amount of 15:00:44 2 smoke retained by a smoker." 15:00:48 3 not just on some machine; retained by a smoker. 15:00:50 4 and dr. henningfield said after he saw this 15:00:55 5 document, he said, well, yeah, i mean, i -- i know 15:00:58 6 that there is vantage smoking in this case, but i 15:01:01 7 did not spend time looking at the design of vantage 15:01:04 8 cigarettes. but now that i've seen this, yeah, this 15:01:06 9 may have been a product that actually reduced tar 15:01:09 10 yields to a smoker. 15:01:12 11 this is not fraud, folks. 15:01:14 12 this is a company doing what it is supposed to 15:01:15 13 be doing. this technology was incorporated in the 15:01:18 14 vantage cigarette, it was put on the market and it 15:01:22 15 was marketed to people not as a safe or safer 15:01:24 16 cigarette, but simply as a low-tar, low-nicotine 15:01:26 17 cigarette that nevertheless was able to have good 15:01:30 18 flavor. 15:01:32 19 so think about this: we are being asked to be 15:01:33 20 punished for this. imagine what would happen if we 15:01:38 21 had done the opposite. if this were a case where 15:01:41 22 they came to you and said, the companies came up 15:01:44 23 with this fabulous technology that is actually better 15:01:46 24 filtration and actually reduces the amount of smoke 15:01:49 25 that goes to the smoker; and instead of 15:01:52 1 incorporating it into the cigarettes, let us say we 15:01:54 2 buried it. we buried the technology, we did not 15:01:57 3 incorporate it into a cigarette product, we did not 15:01:58 4 tell anybody about it, we did not give any smoker the 15:02:00 5 option to smoke it. 15:02:03 6 would they be patting us on the back for that, 15:02:05 7 or would they be saying you really should be 15:02:07 8 punished for that? you had this technology, you 15:02:09 9 did not put it out there, you did not market it? 15:02:11 10 that is punishable conduct. it is not what happened 15:02:13 11 here. 15:02:15 12 this was genuinely believed to be an 15:02:16 13 improvement. it was incorporated into our products, 15:02:20 14 put on the market, not marketed with anything false, 15:02:22 15 just reported with -- the tar and nicotine numbers 15:02:25 16 the ftc required us to report, and billed as a 15:02:27 17 flavored cigarette. but it was on the market. that 15:02:31 18 is simply not punishable conduct. 15:02:35 19 and then, later, in the 1980s and 1990s, you 15:02:39 20 heard that reynolds spent millions and millions of 15:02:41 21 dollars developing this product called premier. and 15:02:44 22 what happened? 15:02:47 23 dr. henningfield agreed this premier product 15:02:50 24 actually reduced cancer risks. what was the 15:02:54 25 response to that? 15:02:57 1 can i have the next one? 15:02:58 2 the office of smoking and health -- this is a 15:02:59 3 government office -- said that, "preliminary 15:03:05 4 research conducted by the developers showed that 15:03:09 5 there were fewer carcinogens in premier. 15:03:11 6 nevertheless, if you look at the middle ones, the 15:03:15 7 panel was concerned about the ramifications of a 15:03:17 8 cigarette that is actually safer than current 15:03:19 9 cigarettes." 15:03:22 10 and then at the bottom, "research should 15:03:22 11 continue, but there is no need to wait for results 15:03:26 12 to initiate a war against new tobacco products." 15:03:28 13 what am i really talking about here? you are 15:03:33 14 being asked to punish us for doing what we should be 15:03:36 15 doing: trying to put a safer product on the markets 15:03:38 16 with vantage, with premier. that is not punishable 15:03:41 17 conduct. 15:03:45 18 now, can we take that down? 15:03:49 19 there is one last thing on this topic that i 15:03:51 20 think is really important for you to understand that 15:03:54 21 you heard in the evidence. 15:03:56 22 what is the context for all these allegations 15:03:57 23 about the ftc machine, the numbers that were being 15:04:00 24 reported in the ads? what was the regulatory 15:04:03 25 environment that reynolds and philip morris were 15:04:07 1 operating in? 15:04:08 2 this is what you heard because mr. clark or 15:04:11 3 mr. berg said, we sat right back and let it happen. 15:04:13 4 all this tar and nicotine numbers were deceptive and 15:04:16 5 we sat right back and let it happen. what is the 15:04:19 6 real story? 15:04:22 7 the real story is, the companies told the ftc 15:04:23 8 you should not adopt this machine method because it is 15:04:27 9 going to mislead consumers. you should not do it. 15:04:29 10 the ftc made the decision to do it anyway. 15:04:32 11 outside of our control. 15:04:36 12 the federal trade commission required us to 15:04:37 13 report those numbers in the magazine ads. 15:04:42 14 the -- this idea that the companies were 15:04:45 15 putting deceptive numbers in their advertising is not 15:04:49 16 true. the federal trade commission required the 15:04:52 17 companies to do that. 15:04:54 18 then, remember when lorillard came along? you 15:04:56 19 saw this letter. lorillard happened to be the first 15:04:59 20 one to do it, they come along and they say, we have 15:05:02 21 got these machine numbers, but we think that our 15:05:04 22 product might actually be delivering higher tar 15:05:07 23 yields than what the machine yields. we would like to 15:05:10 24 print that. the ftc said no. you cannot put higher 15:05:12 25 numbers on there than what the machine comes up 15:05:17 1 with. 15:05:19 2 that is not a decision that any of these 15:05:20 3 companies made; that was an ftc decision. 15:05:22 4 and then, as we already saw, the federal trade 15:05:25 5 commission and the public health service was 15:05:29 6 encouraging smokers to switch to these types of 15:05:32 7 products; even telling them, we will give you a list 15:05:34 8 of the products you can buy if you just send us in 15:05:36 9 the mail [sic]. 15:05:41 10 now, i'm not trying to attack the federal trade 15:05:43 11 commission. i'm really not. all i'm suggesting is 15:05:46 12 that we are not responsible for those decisions that 15:05:48 13 the ftc made. you should not punish us for putting 15:05:51 14 numbers in our ads that the ftc required us to 15:05:54 15 publish. 15:05:57 16 so for all of those reasons, we ask that you 15:05:59 17 check "no" to these questions about punitive 15:06:02 18 damages, and that you check "no" to the other 15:06:06 19 questions in this case that we identify. 15:06:08 20 at the end of the day, this case is not about 15:06:11 21 sympathy, just like i told you at the beginning. 15:06:14 22 it is not about sympathy. you heard a very -- you 15:06:16 23 heard some very compelling testimony that might have 15:06:20 24 made -- would make anyone, really, feel sympathy 15:06:23 25 towards the loss of a human life. 15:06:27 1 but that is not enough in a court of law to 15:06:29 2 award money damages. 15:06:33 3 there has to be evidence, and they do not have 15:06:34 4 the evidence to support that here. 15:06:37 5 this is not a case about whether cigarettes 15:06:39 6 should be legal. it is not a case about whether they 15:06:42 7 should be banned. 15:06:45 8 and it is not a case about other smokers who may 15:06:46 9 have -- maybe other smokers did not know this, maybe 15:06:50 10 other smokers did not have this fork-in-the-road 15:06:54 11 opportunity where they were kind of forced to be off 15:06:56 12 cigarettes and had to decide whether to go back to 15:06:58 13 it. 15:07:01 14 but in this case, the evidence is at the end of 15:07:01 15 the day right where it was at the beginning of the 15:07:05 16 day. mr. ramsay was a willing smoker who knew the 15:07:06 17 risks and liked what smoking did for him. he was not 15:07:10 18 interested in quitting until he did, and nicotine 15:07:12 19 did not control him. 15:07:15 20 and he most certainly was not misled by 15:07:16 21 anything that the tobacco companies or anyone in the 15:07:20 22 conspiracy with them, said. 15:07:23 23 we are going to be asking you, i'm asking you 15:07:26 24 now, to come back with a defense verdict in this 15:07:28 25 case. 15:07:31 1 i've tried as best i know how to summarize the 15:07:31 2 evidence that you have heard, and after i sit down, 15:07:34 3 it will be ms. gallagher's turn to address you. i 15:07:38 4 know she is -- she is had to be quiet all this time so 15:07:41 5 i know she is eager to talk to you. 15:07:43 6 and when she finishes, one of the plaintiff's 15:07:45 7 lawyers will have another turn. and they actually 15:07:48 8 get the last word because it is their burden of 15:07:50 9 proof. 15:07:53 10 so there just will not be a time for you to wait 15:07:53 11 for me to come back and answer those because i will not 15:07:55 12 be able to do that. 15:07:58 13 what i will ask you to do, though, is to just 15:07:59 14 think about what our responses would be to what you 15:08:01 15 hear in rebuttal. you know what our points are, you 15:08:03 16 know what the evidence has been. 15:08:07 17 um, and, um, i guess the last thing i need to 15:08:08 18 do then is to just thank you once again. you have all 15:08:14 19 been patient. you have all -- you know, we have gone on 15:08:17 20 and on, i go on and on and on, and we start getting, 15:08:21 21 i -- you know, i understand. we have a lot to say, 15:08:23 22 there is a lot to cover and i appreciate your 15:08:26 23 patience with us. 15:08:28 24 you know, mr. berg referenced the equal justice 15:08:30 25 under the law there (indicating), and that has to 15:08:33 1 apply even to tobacco companies as well. equal 15:08:36 2 justice under the law means, at least in this case, 15:08:40 3 that if the evidence and the law as you get it from 15:08:44 4 the judge does not support a verdict in favor of 15:08:47 5 mrs. bishop, you should come back with a defense 15:08:50 6 verdict. 15:08:52 7 you were all chosen because you could do that 15:08:53 8 if the evidence and the law requires it. we are in 15:08:56 9 your hands. i'm not asking you for anything more 15:08:59 10 than you follow the law, listen to your common 15:09:03 11 sense, apply the evidence, and, yes, come back with 15:09:05 12 a verdict in favor of the defense. 15:09:08 13 thank you very much. 15:09:10 22 ms. gallagher: thank you, your honor. 15:10:25 23 good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 15:10:26 24 from the floor: good afternoon. 15:10:28 25 ms. gallagher: three facts. three facts are 15:10:30 1 all you need to decide this case. three facts. and 15:10:35 2 they come from the plaintiff's witnesses. they 15:10:39 3 do not come from documents. they do not come from 15:10:42 4 arguments. they are just three facts. three facts 15:10:46 5 that everybody agrees to. 15:10:50 6 and those facts are from 1974. and by that 15:10:52 7 date you know what i'm going to talk about. 15:10:57 8 fact no. 1: mr. ramsay quit smoking for 24 15:11:00 9 days. 15:11:08 10 mrs. bishop tells you that. 15:11:09 11 fact 2: when mr. ramsay started smoking again, 15:11:26 12 after he quit for 24 days, there was no nicotine in 15:11:32 13 his system. he was nicotine-free. 15:11:37 14 dr. hurt told you that. 15:11:47 15 fact no. 3: if mr. ramsay had chosen to remain 15:11:52 16 as a nonsmoker, if he had decided not to start 15:11:58 17 smoking again, he likely would not have developed 15:12:03 18 lung cancer. 15:12:07 19 no lung cancer. 15:12:13 20 dr. villa told you that and we would not be 15:12:20 21 here. 15:12:27 22 so the very first question you are going to be 15:12:29 23 asked to decide is, was robert l. ramsay addicted to 15:12:32 24 cigarettes containing nicotine; and if so, was such 15:12:36 25 addiction a legal cause of his lung cancer? 15:12:40 1 a legal cause. 15:12:43 2 you have the definition. that means it was a 15:12:46 3 substantial cause. a but-for cause. 15:12:49 4 and so what that means is but for his 15:12:52 5 addiction, could mr. ramsay have quit smoking in 15:12:55 6 time to avoid his lung cancer? 15:12:59 7 and these three facts explain why the 15:13:03 8 question -- the answer to question no. 1 is "no." 15:13:08 9 you know that in 1974, when mr. ramsay had this 15:13:13 10 pneumothorax, this collapsed lung, he ended up in 15:13:18 11 the hospital for ten days and he was basically 15:13:21 12 unconscious for those ten days. he could not smoke. 15:13:23 13 but then he got out of the hospital and for the 15:13:27 14 next two weeks, he made the decision every day to be 15:13:29 15 a nonsmoker. he did not smoke. 15:13:35 16 fact no. 1: he quit for 24 days. 15:13:41 17 and you know that all the nicotine was out of 15:13:43 18 his system. dr. hurt explained that. he said 15:13:46 19 within three days, nicotine is completely gone from 15:13:50 20 a person's body. mr. ramsay did not pick up 15:13:53 21 cigarettes again for 24 days. the nicotine had been 15:13:59 22 out of his system for weeks at that point. 15:14:02 23 and he did not start smoking again because of 15:14:06 24 withdrawal symptoms, and, again, you know that from 15:14:09 25 dr. hurt. because dr. hurt told you that within 14 15:14:12 1 to 21 days, all the withdrawal symptoms are gone. 15:14:15 2 not only did you not hear any evidence of any 15:14:20 3 withdrawal symptoms during this period, dr. hurt 15:14:23 4 told you that by the time he picked up those 15:14:26 5 cigarettes again on day 24, those withdrawal 15:14:29 6 symptoms were gone. 15:14:32 7 and dr. villa explained to you -- he came in 15:14:35 8 and told you, when you quit smoking, your risk of 15:14:38 9 getting a smoking-related disease decreases. 15:14:42 10 it goes down. 15:14:45 11 and remember he told you, you get a 15:14:47 12 substantially -- that was his word -- a substantial 15:14:52 13 benefit if you quit after five years. and then he 15:14:54 14 went further and he put numbers on it. and 15:14:58 15 mr. walker told you about those numbers: 1964, 97 15:15:00 16 to 98 percent. decreased risk. 15:15:03 17 but what he also told you was that back at this 15:15:06 18 time, if mr. ramsay had made a decision to stay as a 15:15:11 19 nonsmoker, it is more likely than not that he would 15:15:15 20 not have developed lung cancer and we would not be 15:15:19 21 here. 15:15:23 22 those three facts, ladies and gentlemen, they 15:15:24 23 answered that very first question for you. just 15:15:28 24 those three facts. and when you answer that first 15:15:31 25 question "no," your work is done. your job is done. 15:15:35 1 you put your pen down, and you go home. 15:15:39 2 now, i told you i would be brief during the 15:15:43 3 course of this trial. i did not know how brief. i 15:15:47 4 do not think there is ever been a trial where i did not 15:15:50 5 ask a single question, and i'm going to do so again 15:15:53 6 here today. 15:15:55 7 mr. walker did an excellent job summarizing the 15:15:56 8 evidence, and i agree with what he said and i'm not 15:16:00 9 going to go back through it. but i am going to give 15:16:03 10 you, for lack of a better word, kind of a reader's 15:16:05 11 digest on questions 3 through 6. those are the 15:16:10 12 questions that basically asked, was mr. ramsay 15:16:14 13 defrauded? was he somehow fooled into thinking that 15:16:17 14 cigarettes were not addictive? was he somehow fooled 15:16:22 15 into thinking that cigarettes were not dangerous? 15:16:25 16 was there something that the tobacco companies said 15:16:27 17 or did not say that fooled him? 15:16:30 18 and the answer to that is no, to all of those 15:16:33 19 questions. for all of the reasons mr. walker 15:16:35 20 explained. 15:16:40 21 and for reasons that came directly from 15:16:41 22 mrs. bishop. because mrs. bishop was asked by her 15:16:46 23 own attorney, mr. berg, after she -- he asked her 15:16:49 24 questions and then mr. walker asked her questions, 15:16:53 25 mr. berg came back and said, you are not saying that 15:16:56 1 mr. ramsay knew that nicotine was an addictive drug 15:16:58 2 in the 1970s, are you? 15:17:02 3 and she said, yeah. i think he did know that. 15:17:04 4 when she was directly asked by mr. walker, so 15:17:10 5 it is fair to say that your husband knew about the 15:17:15 6 health risks of smoking back from the time you got 15:17:19 7 married? back to 1961? 15:17:22 8 and what was her answer? yeah, i suppose he 15:17:25 9 did. 15:17:29 10 now, the plaintiffs have come in here and tried 15:17:32 11 to make a big deal about filters and about low tar 15:17:34 12 and say that somehow mr. ramsay was fooled by that. 15:17:36 13 well, all you need to do is look at what mr. ramsay 15:17:39 14 said and how he acted. 15:17:42 15 when he told his children, do not smoke 15:17:45 16 cigarettes, he did not say, do not smoke cigarettes 15:17:48 17 unless you smoke filtered cigarettes or unless you 15:17:53 18 smoke low-tar cigarettes. he told them, do not 15:17:55 19 smoke cigarettes. 15:17:59 20 when his wife would get on him, his friends, 15:18:00 21 his kids and say, you need to quit smoking, it is bad 15:18:05 22 for you, it is killing you. he did not say, oh, it is 15:18:08 23 okay; i'm smoking a low-tar cigarette. it is okay, 15:18:14 24 i'm smoking a filtered cigarette. what he said 15:18:18 25 was. . . every time that mr. ramsay picked up a 15:18:22 1 package of cigarettes, it had a warning on the side. 15:18:28 2 and he saw the exact same warning for every type of 15:18:32 3 cigarette he picked up, whether it was filtered, 15:18:36 4 unfiltered, low-tar, or full-flavored. 15:18:39 5 if mr. ramsay heard anything that the tobacco 15:18:44 6 companies were saying -- and there is no evidence 15:18:47 7 that he did -- he obviously did not believe any of 15:18:49 8 it. 15:18:54 9 and one thing to remember is all of those 15:18:58 10 questions, 3 through 6, also have legal cause. that 15:19:00 11 same thing in there, the legal cause that you have 15:19:04 12 to consider for this. and that brings you back to 15:19:07 13 the three facts you need to answer, the three facts 15:19:09 14 you need for -- to answer these questions, comes 15:19:12 15 back to dr. villa. 15:19:16 16 if he had quit smoking and remained a nonsmoker 15:19:19 17 in 1974, then we would not be here. 15:19:23 18 now, i told you at the beginning of this case 15:19:27 19 that this was a case about mr. ramsay and the 15:19:30 20 decisions he made. and it still is. this is a case 15:19:34 21 about mr. ramsay who quit for 24 days. mr. ramsay 15:19:39 22 who when he picked up cigarettes again, knowing full 15:19:46 23 well the risks associated with smoking, had no 15:19:49 24 nicotine in his system at all. 15:19:53 25 mr. ramsay, who made the decision not to remain 15:19:57 1 a nonsmoker and if he had, we would not be here 15:20:01 2 today. 15:20:08 3 those were his decisions. and those were his 15:20:09 4 decisions to make. and as mr. walker said, we are 15:20:14 5 not criticizing him for making those decisions. but 15:20:16 6 when you make decisions, you accept the 15:20:20 7 responsibility for those decisions. 15:20:22 8 and now mrs. bishop is asking you to award her 15:20:25 9 money for his decisions. do not do it. the evidence 15:20:30 10 in this case simply does not support it. 15:20:36 11 and that is why, ladies and gentlemen, you 15:20:39 12 should return a verdict for the defendants in this 15:20:42 13 case. 15:20:45 14 let me conclude by echoing what everybody has 15:20:47 15 told you, and we are all very sincere in this, thank 15:20:50 16 you for your time, thank you for your attention, and 15:20:54 17 thank you for your jury service. we appreciate it 15:20:56 18 and our clients appreciate it. 15:21:01 19 thank you. 15:21:03 25 the court: thank you. 16:17:51
