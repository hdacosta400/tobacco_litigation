12 closing argument 10:54 13 mr. clark: good morning. i came down with a 10:54 14 little bit of a stuffy nose this morning, so i 10:54 15 apologize for my coughing and my voice this 10:54 16 morning. 10:54 17 what i want to do -- you have been given a lot 10:54 18 of evidence in this case, a lot of evidence. in 10:54 19 fact, the cart's full of it. 10:54 20 but those documents all have different 10:54 21 relevance to different issues that you are going to 10:54 22 have to decide. 10:54 23 and i know we went through it pretty quickly 10:54 24 during the testimony with the witnesses, but what i 10:55 25 want to do is give you an opportunity to write down 10:55 1 some of those numbers and what we believe the 10:55 2 evidence -- what claims the evidence go to, because 10:55 3 there is going to be a lot of documents. i think 10:55 4 there is about 160 different pieces of evidence that 10:55 5 you will get. and if you are looking for something, 10:55 6 this will give you an idea of where to start. 10:55 7 you have been with us now for almost two and a 10:55 8 half weeks. and you have heard this before. you will 10:55 9 hear it again. i do not believe i'll be the last 10:55 10 one to say it, but we do thank you for your time. 10:55 11 we have tried to go through this case as quickly 10:55 12 as possible. we try to give you the evidence as 10:55 13 concise and quickly as possible. we want to 10:55 14 respect your time. we know your time is valuable. 10:55 15 and i think everybody here, including the court and 10:55 16 the defendants, appreciate the sacrifices you have 10:55 17 made to be here. 10:55 18 but nonetheless, we are here. and we have got 10:55 19 some questions that we need you to answer. so i'm 10:56 20 only going to spend a little bit of time with you 10:56 21 this morning; and then i'm going to defer some time 10:56 22 to mr. berg, who is going to talk to you about some 10:56 23 other issues. 10:56 24 the questions that you will have to answer on 10:56 25 the verdict form we will talk about in my portion 10:56 1 here or at least a bulk of them we will talk about in 10:56 2 my portion. what i plan to do is i plan to give 10:56 3 you some reminders of what you heard and what you 10:56 4 saw during the last two weeks from the witnesses on 10:56 5 the stand and from the documents and the slides 10:56 6 that we showed you. 10:56 7 what i want to talk just briefly about is 10:56 8 robert ramsay. family and his friends called him 10:56 9 bert. we know a little bit about mr. ramsay. we 10:56 10 do not know everything. 10:56 11 we know that he began smoking when he was in 10:56 12 his teens. we know that mrs. ramsay [sic] met him 10:56 13 when he was 17 years old, just a few weeks after 10:56 14 turning 17. 10:57 15 we know that he was smoking camel unfiltered 10:57 16 cigarettes at that time. the medical records tell 10:57 17 us that he was smoking enough to put his smoking -- 10:57 18 that he began smoking back during his teenage 10:57 19 years. 10:57 20 what we showed you was documents from 10:57 21 r.j. reynolds reflecting that smokers begin smoking 10:57 22 approximately when they are 16.7, i believe, was 10:57 23 the actual amount. so roughly 16 years of age is a 10:57 24 good -- a good starting point for when people start 10:57 25 smoking. 10:57 1 and we know from the evidence that mr. ramsay 10:57 2 fit right square in the middle of that time period. 10:57 3 we know that in 1958, when mr. ramsay was 17 10:57 4 years old and he was smoking camel unfiltered, we 10:57 5 know that there were no warnings on cigarette 10:57 6 packs. we know there was no surgeon general's 10:57 7 report. 10:58 8 the warnings that were read to you in your 10:58 9 instructions that you will see, those warnings did not 10:58 10 go on until 1966, two years after the release of 10:58 11 the first original surgeon general's report. 10:58 12 the documents that we submitted to you that 10:58 13 were written by the scientists, the executives, the 10:58 14 directors, the chairman of the board, whoever it 10:58 15 might be from these two defendants, those secret 10:58 16 documents, they were never meant to see the light 10:58 17 of day. but they did. and we brought them to you. 10:58 18 you have those documents in evidence. and 10:58 19 they tell you, plain as day, that these two 10:58 20 defendants conspired with other cigarette 10:58 21 manufacturers. they created organizations. they 10:58 22 called them tobacco industry research committee; 10:58 23 changed the name to council for tobacco research; 10:59 24 spun off from that, the tobacco institute to be a 10:59 25 public relations arm. but those documents tell us 10:59 1 that they manipulated those cigarettes. 10:59 2 they took what mother nature gave them. they 10:59 3 take what -- they took what mother nature gave us 10:59 4 all, the tobacco plant. they exploited what was in 10:59 5 there, the nicotine. and they did so with the 10:59 6 intent to make a profit. they did not care a thing 10:59 7 about their customers, despite the promises they 10:59 8 made in 1953. 10:59 9 the first documents we showed you back friday, 10:59 10 a week and a half ago, were documents regarding 10:59 11 their efforts to market their deadly product to the 10:59 12 kids of this country. that was their intent, and 10:59 13 they hid it. 10:59 14 they recognized then that in order to keep 11:00 15 their business alive, they had to market to kids. 11:00 16 they peddled their cigarettes. they worked over 11:00 17 schools. they started that back in the 1920s. one 11:00 18 of the documents we showed you talked about summer 11:00 19 school. i believe you have it there on the screen. 11:00 20 kids were the replacement smokers. one thing 11:00 21 we know about mr. ramsay is by 1958, he was a 11:00 22 replacement smoker for somebody who either had quit 11:00 23 or somebody who had died. and the other thing we 11:00 24 know about mr. ramsay is in 1992, somebody else 11:00 25 became a replacement smoker for him. 11:00 1 we showed you the documents again that talks 11:00 2 about when kids started smoking. mr. ramsay was 11:00 3 one of those kids. 11:01 4 philip morris and r.j. reynolds knew back in 11:01 5 the '50s: you gotta hook the kids. you gotta get 11:01 6 the kids on cigarettes. that is the future of our 11:01 7 business. without it, we will dwindle. 11:01 8 that is what they intended to do, and their 11:01 9 documents prove they did it. i just want to take a 11:01 10 quick look at that. 11:01 11 younger adult smokers are the only source of 11:01 12 replacement smokers. they recognized back then, 11:01 13 looking back 50 years from the date of this 11:01 14 document in 1984, going back to 1934, that what 11:01 15 they had to do was they had to get kids smoking in 11:01 16 their teenage years. and if they did not, if they 11:01 17 waited until they were in their twenties, they 11:01 18 would not have a customer for life, plain and 11:01 19 simple. 11:02 20 you heard some evidence about this particular 11:02 21 document referencing the young adult market as 11:02 22 being those that are over the age of 18, 18 to 24. 11:02 23 i think you have seen plenty of other documents like 11:02 24 the one before you, where what they are really 11:02 25 talking about is the 14- to 24-year-old. some 11:02 1 documents even refer to them as being as young as 11:02 2 12. 11:02 3 the federal trade commission report that you 11:02 4 have in evidence actually noted that cigarette 11:02 5 advertising reaches kids as young as two. 11:02 6 i want to talk to you a few minutes about 11:02 7 something that -- i want to talk to you about 11:02 8 something that we showed you quite often during 11:02 9 dr. cummings' testimony. and it was a slide that 11:02 10 showed the rise of cigarette sales and the rise of 11:02 11 lung cancer. 11:02 12 and i want to remind you that the testimony 11:02 13 was that before the modern cigarette hit the 11:02 14 market, lung cancer was rare. it was very rare. 11:03 15 people did not suffer from lung cancer. it was not 11:03 16 until they got into blending and different tobaccos 11:03 17 and the different -- some of the different design 11:03 18 features and marketing that cigarette sales took 11:03 19 off. 11:03 20 well, by the 1950s, lung cancers were -- lung 11:03 21 cancer was skyrocketing. that is an epidemic 11:03 22 created solely by these two defendants and their 11:03 23 coconspirators. had they not done what they have 11:03 24 done, lung cancer would still be the rare form it 11:03 25 is back then. they created the epidemic of lung 11:03 1 cancer caused by cigarette smoking. 11:03 2 they talk about choices. bert ramsay sure 11:03 3 did not make the choice to create a lung cancer 11:03 4 epidemic. bert ramsay did not make the choice to 11:03 5 lie and conceal things from the american public. 11:03 6 we will talk a little bit more about what bert ramsay 11:04 7 did and some of his choices in a little bit. 11:04 8 you are going to get a verdict form. and so 11:04 9 what i would like to do for a few minutes is we are 11:04 10 going to go through this verdict form a little bit. 11:04 11 so one of the very first questions or the very 11:04 12 first question that you are going to have to answer 11:04 13 is whether or not mr. ramsay was addicted to 11:04 14 cigarettes containing nicotine and whether or not 11:04 15 that addiction was a legal cause of his lung 11:04 16 cancer. there is a whole lot going on in that 11:04 17 particular question. so i'm going to talk about 11:04 18 the different parts of that question individually. 11:04 19 the first thing here is legal cause. what is 11:04 20 legal cause? now, i know the court read to you the 11:04 21 definition of legal cause. you will have the packet 11:04 22 that he read from back there, to go back to and 11:04 23 read and figure this out. but there is a lot he 11:04 24 read to you. and those of us who do what i do, we 11:05 25 sometimes struggle with this concept of legal 11:05 1 cause. but i'd like to read it to you while you have 11:05 2 got it in front of you. 11:05 3 an addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine 11:05 4 is a legal cause of a disease or medical condition 11:05 5 if it directly and in a natural and continuous 11:05 6 sequence produces or contributes substantially to 11:05 7 producing such disease or medical conditions so 11:05 8 that it can be -- reasonably be said that but for 11:05 9 the addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine, 11:05 10 such disease or medical condition would not have 11:05 11 been suffered. 11:05 12 that is legal cause. 11:05 13 sometimes it is referred to as but-for cause. 11:05 14 you see that phrase in there. but here's the key 11:05 15 word. in order -- or the key part. 11:05 16 in order to be regarded as a legal cause of a 11:05 17 disease or a medical condition, an addiction to 11:05 18 cigarettes containing nicotine need not be the only 11:05 19 cause. 11:05 20 there are a lot of things and the law 11:05 21 recognizes there are a lot of things and a lot of 11:06 22 factors that come together to cause some event. 11:06 23 and when you have circumstances where there 11:06 24 are multiple things that come together to cause a 11:06 25 particular event, or in this particular case, lung 11:06 1 cancer and death, the law does not say only one of 11:06 2 those things can be the cause to the exclusion of 11:06 3 all others. 11:06 4 they could all be legal cause of lung cancer 11:06 5 and death. addiction to cigarettes only needs to 11:06 6 be one of them. and i think the evidence in this 11:06 7 case is overwhelmingly that mr. ramsay was addicted 11:06 8 to cigarettes. 11:06 9 another key word in there, that very first 11:06 10 sentence, "a legal cause." the word "the" is not 11:06 11 in there. "the legal cause" does not appear. "a 11:06 12 legal cause" is the key. 11:06 13 what i want to talk about this first question 11:07 14 on the verdict form for a minute, what that 11:07 15 question is not about. okay? see right here, 11:07 16 question is not whether robert ramsay had free 11:07 17 choice. that appears nowhere in the question. 11:07 18 the question is not whether robert ramsay was 11:07 19 unable to control himself. that is not it. 11:07 20 the question is not whether addiction took 11:07 21 over robert ramsay's life completely where he 11:07 22 could not quit, under no circumstances could he 11:07 23 quit. 11:07 24 the question is simply whether his addiction 11:07 25 was a substantial contributing factor, one factor 11:07 1 among many causes. and i think the evidence 11:07 2 supports that. 11:07 3 one of the things that we showed you from the 11:07 4 tobacco industry documents is how long ago they 11:07 5 recognized this importance and how hard -- how hard 11:07 6 it is for people, once they get them hooked to 11:07 7 cigarettes, how hard it is to quit smoking. 11:07 8 these documents you have before you are in 11:08 9 evidence. 11:08 10 happily for the tobacco industry, nicotine is 11:08 11 both habituating and unique. most of those who 11:08 12 have smoked for any significant time would like to 11:08 13 stop. many, but not most of those who would like 11:08 14 to stop, are able to do so. 11:08 15 they knew it way back then. 11:08 16 what testimony did you hear from the witness 11:08 17 stand about mr. ramsay's addiction or whether or 11:08 18 not he was addicted? 11:08 19 clearly, you heard from dr. richard hurt. run 11:08 20 the mayo clinic for decades, the smoking cessation 11:08 21 clinic at the mayo clinic. dr. richard hurt told 11:08 22 you his opinion: he clearly was addicted. 11:08 23 he referenced something called the heaviness 11:08 24 of smoking index. you know, two main questions, if 11:08 25 you can only ask two questions, what are those 11:08 1 questions? 11:08 2 how much do you smoke per day? 11:08 3 and when do you have your first cigarette in 11:08 4 the morning? 11:08 5 mr. ramsay had his first cigarette in the 11:09 6 morning before he even got out of bed. had his 11:09 7 ashtray beside the bed. 11:09 8 mr. ramsay smoked at least, i think the 11:09 9 testimony is somewhere between a pack, a pack and a 11:09 10 half, to two packs per day for the bulk of his 11:09 11 life. 11:09 12 mr. ramsay had classic withdrawal symptoms 11:09 13 when he was trying to quit: the irritability, the 11:09 14 anxiousness, the frustration. 11:09 15 one of the things that i anticipate you will 11:09 16 probably hear during closing arguments is that, you 11:09 17 know, when mr. ramsay made the decision in 1988 to 11:09 18 quit smoking because he wanted to see his 11:09 19 granddaughter graduate from college, that he 11:09 20 started to stop smoking in front of his wife; he 11:09 21 stopped smoking in the house; he stopped smoking in 11:09 22 his office; he stopped smoking on the floor of his 11:09 23 office building; he stopped smoking in the whole 11:09 24 building. 11:09 25 your common sense, the judge has already told 11:09 1 you, you do not leave your common sense at the door. 11:09 2 you take it back there with you. 11:10 3 common sense tells you if mr. ramsay was not 11:10 4 addicted, why did not he just put the cigarettes 11:10 5 down and walk away? why did he have to go through 11:10 6 all those steps to finally get smoking under 11:10 7 control where he could quit? 11:10 8 it just does not make sense. common sense 11:10 9 tells you he was addicted. and that is not even 11:10 10 talking about the times on vacation and the other 11:10 11 times that his daughter talked about when he tried 11:10 12 to quit smoking and he would hide it. and you 11:10 13 could -- she could smell the smoke on him, even 11:10 14 though he is trying to quit. 11:10 15 dr. jack henningfield, the man who wrote -- 11:10 16 the man who wrote the book on nicotine addiction, 11:10 17 the surgeon general's report from 1988, told you, 11:10 18 by far, the most substantial reason why people 11:10 19 smoke at least a pack a day for -- of cigarettes 11:10 20 for years and decades, even in the face of health 11:10 21 concerns, is nicotine addiction. 11:11 22 he told you -- he described to you all the 11:11 23 different design features of cigarettes. he told 11:11 24 you how they manipulate nicotine levels. sure, 11:11 25 tobacco companies put less nicotine in it than it 11:11 1 appears in nature. but there is a reason for that. 11:11 2 the documents we gave you tell you that. 11:11 3 dr. henningfield told you that. the reason is 11:11 4 because nicotine in the natural level is too harsh. 11:11 5 it burns your throat if you smoke it. 11:11 6 kids cannot get hooked on it because they will not 11:11 7 smoke it. so what they do, they lower the nicotine 11:11 8 level. but we gave you a document where they 11:11 9 talked about: how low can we go? they want to get 11:11 10 rid of the harshness, so they had other ingredients 11:11 11 to it to match the harshness of nicotine. it makes 11:11 12 it so much smoother to the delicate respiratory 11:11 13 system of our children. 11:11 14 and it does not take long. just a little bit 11:11 15 of smoking and you are hooked, and you are hooked for 11:12 16 life. and for the rest of your life, you will have 11:12 17 those cravings. 11:12 18 they added things like licorice to allow it to 11:12 19 get deeper into the lungs. they added ventilation 11:12 20 holes to increase the smoothness of the smoke, all 11:12 21 the while, tinkering around and monkeying around 11:12 22 with whatever the nicotine level was so that they 11:12 23 could get the optimal level of it to keep people 11:12 24 smoking. otherwise, it would be like smoking 11:12 25 cigars. it would burn and you would not smoke them. 11:12 1 michael criscitiello, mr. ramsay's friend, 11:12 2 what was one of the last things he said to you? 11:12 3 mr. ramsay told me he was hooked. 11:12 4 annie bishop and jennifer hardman, his widow 11:12 5 and his daughter, talked about how he could not 11:12 6 stop. he tried, but he could not do it. 11:12 7 that is all evidence that you have that you use 11:13 8 to determine whether or not mr. ramsay was addicted 11:13 9 to cigarettes containing nicotine. 11:13 10 the other part of the question -- let us go 11:13 11 back to that question for a minute, baron. 11:13 12 the other part of that question has to do with 11:13 13 whether or not that was a legal cause of his lung 11:13 14 cancer. so we already talked about legal cause. 11:13 15 but let us talk about the lung cancer for a moment. 11:13 16 mr. ramsay had lung cancer. you have seen, you know, 11:13 17 gobbles of evidence that mr. ramsay had lung cancer 11:13 18 and he died from it. 11:13 19 i do not know how big of a dispute that is. 11:13 20 but clearly the medical records all show that he 11:13 21 had lung cancer. i believe -- where is that slide, 11:13 22 baron? 11:13 23 dr. villa -- i'm going to go up here where 11:14 24 dr. villa was. he stood up here on this witness 11:14 25 stand and told you these things. i think he 11:14 1 actually stood up here when he was asked these 11:14 2 questions about whether or not this was a primary 11:14 3 lung cancer. and he told you these things. 11:14 4 primary cancer of the lung because the 11:14 5 bronchoscopy saw the cancer in the bronchus. there 11:14 6 was some testimony about a skin cancer. but he was 11:14 7 flat out -- you know, that did not have anything to 11:14 8 do with his lung cancer. because if it did, it 11:14 9 would have appeared in a different part of the 11:14 10 lung, not inside the airway, inside the bronchus. 11:14 11 the pattern of metastatic disease to the 11:14 12 mediastinum is classical. classical. the 11:14 13 mediastinum, he told you about this area right here 11:14 14 in the middle, has all this stuff going on where 11:14 15 the lymph nodes are. 11:14 16 the pathology report says that keratinizing 11:14 17 squamous cell carcinoma is definitive. there are 11:14 18 no other suspicious primaries, meaning no other 11:15 19 suspicious tumors anywhere else in the body. 11:15 20 most importantly, all the specialists, the 11:15 21 treating doctors he had, agreed that this was 11:15 22 primary cancer of the lung and treated him like it 11:15 23 was primary cancer of the lung. you have a very, 11:15 24 very strong smoking history. you cannot have it any 11:15 25 better than that. that is what he said. 11:15 1 there is no doubt that mr. ramsay's lung cancer 11:15 2 was caused by smoking, and there is no doubt that 11:15 3 his lung cancer or his smoking was caused by 11:15 4 addiction to cigarettes. 11:15 5 i have a little chart here i would like to 11:15 6 show you about exposures, what mr. ramsay exposed 11:15 7 himself to. 11:15 8 one and a half to two packs per day, that is 11:15 9 10,950 to 14,600 cigarettes per year, every year he 11:15 10 smoked. the average is approximately ten puffs per 11:15 11 cigarette. that means that mr. ramsay, during the 11:15 12 course of his lifetime that he smoked, exposed his 11:15 13 lungs and washed his lungs with 69 different 11:16 14 chemicals that cause cancer, over -- roughly 11:16 15 4 million to 5 million times in the course of his 11:16 16 lifetime. 11:16 17 next slide, please. 11:16 18 let us take a look. addiction leads to the 11:16 19 continued smoking. he tried to quit. he tried to 11:16 20 quit. he tried to quit. there is some testimony 11:16 21 about, you know, he tried all these times on 11:16 22 vacation. but when the time he really made his 11:16 23 mind up in 1988, he really set his mind to do it. 11:16 24 that is some of the testimony, some of the argument 11:16 25 you will hear. 11:16 1 you know, they say insanity is doing the same 11:16 2 thing over and over and over and over again, 11:16 3 expecting the same -- a different result. well, in 11:16 4 mr. ramsay's case, he was a smart man. he tried 11:16 5 everything he could. he tried to quit at times 11:16 6 when he had the family's support. he tried to quit 11:16 7 at times when it was not as stressful for him at 11:17 8 work. and he failed at it. 11:17 9 everything else in life he was successful at. 11:17 10 he failed at it. then he tried nicorette gum. and 11:17 11 he failed at it. and then he tried the things that 11:17 12 we have already talked about, controlling his 11:17 13 environment. and you know what? that finally 11:17 14 worked. he was finally able to get off cigarettes. 11:17 15 the question is, is why did not he try it 11:17 16 before? who knows? but the point is, is 11:17 17 mr. ramsay was smart. he looked at it. he 11:17 18 evaluated his own condition. and he did things he 11:17 19 could to try to help himself quit. and one of them 11:17 20 finally worked. 11:17 21 the only problem is, it was just too late for 11:17 22 mr. ramsay. 11:17 23 addiction leads to the continued smoking, 11:17 24 which leads to the continued exposure of 11:17 25 carcinogens, which leads to the lung cancer which 11:17 1 finally killed him. 11:18 2 so the answer to question number one clearly 11:18 3 is a yes. his addiction to cigarettes is what 11:18 4 caused him to smoke for all those years. and 11:18 5 without his addiction, he would not have developed 11:18 6 lung cancer. and that was testimony from 11:18 7 dr. villa. 11:18 8 once you get through the first question and 11:18 9 answer yes that he is -- then he is a class member. 11:18 10 that is -- that is -- that is your determination, that 11:18 11 he is a class member. 11:18 12 then you have got some more questions to ask. 11:18 13 but those engle findings that you have been told 11:18 14 about, that smoking causes lung cancer and nicotine 11:18 15 is addictive, that the tobacco companies concealed 11:18 16 material information from the public, that they 11:18 17 conspired with one another to conceal material 11:18 18 information from the public, all those become 11:18 19 binding on you. they become binding on us. they 11:18 20 become binding on them. they become binding on the 11:18 21 court. they are set in stone once you get to that 11:18 22 point. and they apply. 11:19 23 so what you are going to get to is the next 11:19 24 questions after the first couple of questions about 11:19 25 whether or not smoking cigarettes caused his lung 11:19 1 cancer and death. you are going to get to those 11:19 2 questions that evaluate their conduct. now you are 11:19 3 going to start to really look at what they did. 11:19 4 and let us talk about what they did for a little 11:19 5 bit. 11:19 6 oh, before i leave that, that is a good point. 11:19 7 dr. henningfield gave you something that i think is 11:19 8 very beneficial. he gave you the definition of 11:19 9 addiction, that when he was at the national 11:19 10 institute of drug abuse, nida, i wrote it, but he 11:19 11 told it to you from the stand: chronic relapsing 11:19 12 brain disease characterized by compulsive use, 11:19 13 often in the face of harm. 11:19 14 chronic relapsing. he tried to quit and he 11:19 15 went right back. he tried to quit; he went right 11:19 16 back. that is chronic relapsing. 11:20 17 brain disease, you heard all about that from 11:20 18 dr. henningfield, about the nicotine receptors, how 11:20 19 the nicotine goes in there, causes the release of 11:20 20 the chemicals that make you feel good. 11:20 21 characterized by compulsive use. if not 11:20 22 smoking 50 to 60 packs [sic] of cigarettes per day 11:20 23 is not compulsive use, then that -- there is no such 11:20 24 thing. 11:20 25 in the face of harm. you know, we are not 11:20 1 saying that mr. ramsay was an idiot and stuck his 11:20 2 head in the sand and lived under a rock. there is 11:20 3 stuff out there. people knew -- people suspected 11:20 4 smoking caused disease. people knew that smoking 11:20 5 at least -- whether they knew about how addictive 11:20 6 it was, not sure about that, but they at least knew 11:20 7 that it was definitely at least very hard to break; 11:20 8 that once you start it, it was difficult. 11:20 9 did mr. ramsay know that? yeah. his conduct 11:20 10 tells us that he perceived some of that. that is 11:20 11 not the point. that is not the point. we will get to 11:21 12 that in a minute. 11:21 13 i do not believe you heard any other evidence 11:21 14 other than that the cigarettes manufactured by 11:21 15 philip morris and r.j. reynolds caused his 11:21 16 continued smoking and his eventual lung cancer and 11:21 17 death. 11:21 18 so let us go back to the question i was getting 11:21 19 to. and this question has to do with -- let us go 11:21 20 past that. there we go. 11:21 21 these questions have to do with whether or not 11:21 22 mr. ramsay relied on what they were putting out. 11:21 23 now, what we have is we have a conspiracy claim, 11:21 24 and we have a concealment claim. the concealment 11:21 25 claim is based on material information that they 11:21 1 withheld, that they did not tell the people about. 11:21 2 and they showed, i do not know, countless 11:21 3 reader's digest articles and time and newsweek 11:21 4 articles about what was being said about cancer and 11:22 5 smoking. you did not hear a single bit of evidence 11:22 6 that mr. ramsay ever read one of those magazines. 11:22 7 but let us talk about what was out there. 11:22 8 there was some research being conducted that showed 11:22 9 cigarette smoking caused lung cancer. we showed 11:22 10 you those. i passed you around the life magazine 11:22 11 article that you looked at. dr. wynder and 11:22 12 dr. graham painted the tar on the backs of mice in 11:22 13 the early '50s, and they developed tumors. so this 11:22 14 got a wide range of publicity. 11:22 15 and what happened? let me see the consumption 11:22 16 slides real quick, baron. 11:22 17 what happened when it got all this publicity? 11:22 18 we have shown you this before, but let us take a look 11:22 19 at it again. 11:22 20 right here, in the 1950s, very sharp -- i 11:22 21 cannot draw on this one, can i? right there. very 11:22 22 sharp drop in cigarette sales. why? people were 11:23 23 worried about the health risks. so what do the 11:23 24 tobacco companies do? they do not come out and say, 11:23 25 you know what? you are right. we have got this book 11:23 1 report. remember it had been characterized as a 11:23 2 book report? we have got this book report written by 11:23 3 one of our young scientists who studied, i think, 11:23 4 reference '78, '79 article or something like that 11:23 5 that linked cigarette smoking to lung cancer. they 11:23 6 did not come out and say, we know this; let us figure 11:23 7 out what we can do to make them better. they 11:23 8 did not just sit back and keep quiet and let the 11:23 9 doctors do their work and figure it out. 11:23 10 no. they attacked them, called them fanatics. 11:23 11 the same people that took the stand in this case, 11:23 12 dr. henningfield, dr. cummings, dr. hurt, their 11:23 13 predecessors were attacked by these two defendants 11:23 14 and the other conspirators because they were trying 11:23 15 to get the truth out. every chance they had, they 11:23 16 went on the offensive. 11:24 17 but that was not enough. that was not enough. 11:24 18 they had to go and they had to give people that 11:24 19 psychological crutch: filters. in the 1950s -- 11:24 20 you heard some of the statements. if we -- there is 11:24 21 nothing in there that is injurious to health; but if 11:24 22 there is, we will take it out with filters. 11:24 23 and what happens to the rise of cigarette 11:24 24 sales? 11:24 25 put that back up. 11:24 1 what do we know now? filters were a gimmick. 11:24 2 they do not work. but the tobacco company sold it 11:24 3 as the latest and greatest. and people by the 11:24 4 millions switched to them, so much so that with, i 11:24 5 think, 2 percent of the filters in the '50s were -- 11:24 6 early '50s were filtered to, by the time you get to 11:24 7 the surgeon general's report in '64, 90-something 11:24 8 percent of them were filtered, i think. you will 11:24 9 remember whatever the percentages are. 11:25 10 people bought it, hook, line, and sinker. and 11:25 11 all the while, they are sitting back there counting 11:25 12 the dollars that that just made them. 11:25 13 they do not work. they did not work then, and 11:25 14 they do not work now. 11:25 15 and they knew it. 11:25 16 but it does not stop there. finally, you get 11:25 17 to the 1960s when you have the question asked of 11:25 18 president kennedy. he does not even know the full 11:25 19 link between smoking and cancer. and they want 11:25 20 bert ramsay to know the full extent of it? 11:25 21 so what happens two weeks after his speech, 11:25 22 his answer? you have the commission of the surgeon 11:25 23 general's committee; and then you have the 11:25 24 follow-up, which is the surgeon general's report, 11:25 25 the very first one, the 1964 report. and it got so 11:25 1 much publicity. 11:25 2 cbs news, one of the only three networks at 11:25 3 the time, had a special on it, a two-hour special. 11:25 4 and we showed you portions of that clip. defendant 11:25 5 showed you portions of that clip. 11:25 6 what happens to cigarette sales? they drop. 11:26 7 what do they do? they go on the offensive, 11:26 8 and they start developing these lights and low-tars 11:26 9 and low-nicotine brands, all the while knowing it 11:26 10 does not work. they gave them another psychological 11:26 11 crutch. 11:26 12 lights and low-tars do not work. they are not 11:26 13 low-nicotine, low-tar. they knew it. they knew 11:26 14 that the smokers were getting bad information from 11:26 15 those machine tests. and they sat right back and 11:26 16 let it happen. and they marketed on that. that is 11:26 17 why you see some of the advertising, advertising 11:26 18 the ftc method, you know, 11 milligrams tar, 11:26 19 .9 milligrams nicotine. 11:26 20 but we showed you their own internal documents 11:26 21 where they were reverse-engineering one another's 11:26 22 products. or at least r.j. reynolds's was 11:26 23 reverse-engineering merit. where they recognized 11:26 24 that the amount of nicotine that the smoker was 11:26 25 getting from the low-nicotine/low-tar brand was 11:27 1 actually more than the winston. 11:27 2 and then going back to winston, you heard 11:27 3 dr. cummings tell you: when bert ramsay switched 11:27 4 from camel unfiltered to winston filters around 11:27 5 1960, he switched to a brand of cigarettes that was 11:27 6 giving him two and a half times the amount of 11:27 7 carcinogens than he was getting with the unfiltered 11:27 8 camel. 11:27 9 they knew it. they had researched it, and 11:27 10 they knew it. 11:27 11 that, ladies and gentlemen, is a material 11:27 12 fact. 11:27 13 would bert ramsay have acted differently if 11:27 14 he would have known switching to what he perceived to 11:27 15 be a safer cigarette was, in fact, actually two and 11:27 16 a half times more dangerous for him than the 11:27 17 current one he was smoking? would that have made a 11:27 18 difference to him? absolutely. 11:27 19 he did just what they wanted him to do when 11:27 20 they wanted him to do it. and that was what you 11:27 21 heard from dr. cummings. 11:27 22 to the defendants, bert ramsay was a success 11:27 23 story. the only problem with it is he did not live 11:27 24 long enough to make them more money. 11:28 25 so when you are looking at this question, you 11:28 1 have the same legal cause issue to deal with when 11:28 2 you are talking about concealment. 11:28 3 so the concealment that they did, this was the 11:28 4 type of information. not that they withheld the 11:28 5 fact that smoking causes lung cancer. people were 11:28 6 recognizing that. and people like dr. henningfield 11:28 7 and dr. hurt and dr. cummings were trying their 11:28 8 hardest to get the truth out. but you heard 11:28 9 dr. henningfield even say it himself. i was 11:28 10 bamboozled. the whole government was bamboozled by 11:28 11 this light, low-tar, filter stuff. 11:28 12 those are the material facts that were 11:28 13 withheld, that filters do not work, that lights and 11:28 14 low tars do not mean lights and low tars, that 11:28 15 you are really getting just as much as you were 11:28 16 before. 11:28 17 and then they started with the -- carrying on 11:28 18 into the 1980s, the open controversy. they had 11:29 19 been spreading this controversy message since 1953. 11:29 20 they challenged the people who were coming out and 11:29 21 speaking about how, you know, there is this link 11:29 22 between smoking and disease, and they challenged 11:29 23 them and they attacked them. 11:29 24 you heard the -- you saw the video from 11:29 25 mr. dwyer in 1979. you remember the video we 11:29 1 showed you where he is standing up there in front of 11:29 2 the curtain. he must have 50 or 60 microphones in 11:29 3 front of him. and the first thing out of his mouth 11:29 4 is, it was suspect from the start. 11:29 5 he is attacking the surgeon general's report. 11:29 6 the people who were trying to get the truth out, 11:29 7 get smoking rates down, get lung cancer rates down. 11:29 8 no mercy for these people. they brought all their 11:29 9 resources to bear to attack every chance they 11:29 10 could. all the while, giving their customers a 11:29 11 reason to keep smoking. 11:30 12 every time bert ramsay tried to quit, they 11:30 13 intercepted that. they intercepted it with a 11:30 14 gimmick. do not quit, go to the filters. do not 11:30 15 quit, go to the low tars. and it killed him. bert 11:30 16 ramsay's dead because he believed what he heard. 11:30 17 let us take a look at that question, the 11:30 18 concealment question. 11:30 19 please state whether mr. ramsay reasonably 11:30 20 relied to his detriment on any statement by 11:30 21 r.j. reynolds tobacco company that concealed or 11:30 22 omitted material information concerning the health 11:30 23 effects and/or addictive nature of smoking 11:30 24 cigarettes. and if so, whether such reliance was a 11:30 25 legal cause of his death. 11:30 1 there is that legal cause thing in there again, 11:30 2 that but for. it does not have to be the only 11:30 3 cause. it does not have to be -- sure it is not the 11:30 4 cause that you have to establish. 11:31 5 their decision, their choice, they want to 11:31 6 talk about choices, their choice to lie about what 11:31 7 filters do and what filters do not do, their choice 11:31 8 to lie about low tars and low nicotine, their 11:31 9 choice to attack the surgeon general, to try to 11:31 10 make this an open controversy. 11:31 11 by the way, you will see that in the question. 11:31 12 but 1982, may 5th, 1982, the open controversy that 11:31 13 the chairman of the board of r.j. reynolds -- we 11:31 14 showed you the clip of him on nightline, this, can 11:31 15 we have an open debate about smoking, that is 1984. 11:31 16 he is still trying. these defendants are still 11:31 17 trying to convince people there is some question 11:31 18 about smoking and health. 11:31 19 and there is no consensus. you heard it from 11:31 20 the witness stand. there was no consensus -- or 11:31 21 there was no dispute about the consensus. all the 11:31 22 doctors, all the scientists were convinced smoking 11:31 23 causes cancer. 11:31 24 the only body out there saying otherwise are 11:31 25 these companies, but you heard how much they do. 11:31 1 they spend more in one day than the public health 11:32 2 community could get out in a whole year. 11:32 3 so did mr. ramsay rely? absolutely. you can 11:32 4 refer -- or you can infer from all the wallpaper 11:32 5 that dr. cummings talked about, all the wallpaper 11:32 6 advertising and all the programs, all the 11:32 7 commercials, the project truth. remember the 11:32 8 gentleman coming down the halls of congress talking 11:32 9 about these respected doctors who testified at the 11:32 10 91st congress, that there is -- there has not been 11:32 11 proven there is a link between cigarettes and 11:32 12 smoking. 11:32 13 but what you also heard from dr. cummings is 11:32 14 how those respected scientists were bought and paid 11:32 15 for by ctr funds, the special projects. 11:32 16 so did he rely? sure, he did. his behavior 11:32 17 is consistent with the fact that he relied. 11:32 18 r.j. reynolds and philip morris put out there, 11:32 19 filters are safer. and when they did it, he 11:33 20 followed. they put out there that lights and low 11:33 21 tars were safer. and when they did it, he 11:33 22 followed. a success story for these two defendants 11:33 23 that dr. cummings talked about. 11:33 24 let us go to the frank statement, please, 11:33 25 baron. 36. that is what i have. 11:33 1 how much time? 2 ms. cherry: thirty-nine minutes, mr. clark. 11:33 3 mr. clark: okay. thank you. 11:33 4 you remember the frank statement. we showed 11:33 5 it to you a few times. it is in evidence. you will 11:33 6 be able to see it. 11:33 7 this was their promises in 1954 when this was 11:33 8 published. you will remember the story about when 11:33 9 stock prices fell, the cigarette companies met. 11:33 10 fierce competitors. did not do stuff like this 11:34 11 before then. but this was such a blow to their 11:34 12 business when stock prices started to fall, that 11:34 13 they locked arms and decided to meet. 11:34 14 and what did they meet? they meet for one 11:34 15 purpose. they are going to figure out a way to make 11:34 16 a public relations campaign and create doubt, and 11:34 17 the tobacco industry research committee was the -- 11:34 18 was the result of that meeting. and here's what 11:34 19 they said. 11:34 20 they made these promises. so from the very 11:34 21 first day that -- after they started to agree that 11:34 22 they can -- they are going to attack this stuff, 11:34 23 they are not going to take this lying down, they 11:34 24 start with this controversy, that medical research 11:34 25 of recent years indicates many possible causes of 11:34 1 lung cancer. 11:34 2 that is contradictory to what claude teague 11:34 3 said in that memorandum in r.j. reynolds 11 months 11:34 4 before. but that claude teague memorandum was not 11:34 5 released with the frank statement. 11:34 6 there is -- that -- there is no agreement 11:35 7 among the authorities regarding what the cause is. 11:35 8 dr. cummings said that was not true. 11:35 9 that there is no proof that cigarette smoking 11:35 10 is one of the causes. there is ample proof. and 11:35 11 they knew it. they knew it. 11:35 12 those three statements were lies, and they 11:35 13 knew it then. 11:35 14 we accept an interest in people's health as a 11:35 15 basic responsibility paramount to every other 11:35 16 consideration in our business. the evidence has 11:35 17 been overwhelming that the only thing they cared 11:35 18 about was money. money, money. how can they get 11:35 19 more of it. 11:35 20 there is a document in evidence that we showed 11:35 21 to you that you can look at. i believe it is 11:35 22 dr. teague also, talks about how if the exit gates 11:35 23 to their market, meaning if people were able to 11:35 24 quit smoking and get off cigarettes, many of them 11:35 25 would. and if the exit gates open, they would be out 11:35 1 of business overnight. 11:36 2 all they cared about was the survivability of 11:36 3 their business. they did not care about the health 11:36 4 of their consumers. 11:36 5 we believe the products we make are not 11:36 6 injurious to health. another lie. the problem is, 11:36 7 people did not really know that then. 11:36 8 we always have and always will cooperate 11:36 9 closely with those whose task it is to safeguard 11:36 10 the public health. no, they did not. no, they 11:36 11 did not. not once did they cooperate. you heard 11:36 12 some testimony about the tobacco working group and 11:36 13 how they talked about cooperating with the national 11:36 14 cancer institute to kind of figure out how to make 11:36 15 a safer cigarette. 11:36 16 what you have in evidence is the rest of the 11:36 17 documents regarding that, where they are basically 11:36 18 telling each other that we are going to stay in the 11:36 19 tobacco working group because we need to protect 11:36 20 the industry. 11:36 21 let us go to the -- this question's not 11:37 22 about -- likely addiction question, the class 11:37 23 membership question. this question is not about 11:37 24 some things as well. 11:37 25 the question is not whether the defendants 11:37 1 could have said something that would have made him 11:37 2 stop smoking, although it would have sure helped if 11:37 3 they would have told him the truth about the 11:37 4 filters and the low tars. 11:37 5 whether information on harms of smoking was 11:37 6 available. it was out there. you know, all the 11:37 7 reader's digest and stuff like that. 11:37 8 whether robert ramsay ever saw a warning. you 11:37 9 know, that is not part of this question. 11:37 10 the question is whether or not there is false 11:37 11 controversy, that idea that there is an open debate 11:37 12 about smoking, that doctors just are not sure, that 11:37 13 there is other possible causes other than 11:37 14 cigarettes, whether that was a substantial 11:37 15 contributing factor, one among many causes. 11:37 16 did they expect -- let us go to the heimann 11:38 17 slide. did they expect their consumers to rely on 11:38 18 it? we played you the video deposition of one 11:38 19 robert k. heimann, formerly the chief executive 11:38 20 officer of american tobacco, now part of reynolds. 11:38 21 and we gave you his testimony. would you 11:38 22 expect the consumer to rely upon your 11:38 23 advertisements? yes. our advertisement is 11:38 24 truthful, and we would anticipate that they would 11:38 25 rely on it if they chose. 11:38 1 and you heard dr. cummings talk about the 11:38 2 wallpaper of advertising. it was everywhere, 11:38 3 television, print, newspapers, billboards, movies. 11:38 4 there was not a single place that cigarette 11:38 5 advertising did not occur. 11:38 6 i believe one document you had shows that it 11:38 7 was the most heavily advertised product in america. 11:39 8 how do we know filters were a gimmick? they 11:39 9 said it themselves. the illusion of filtration is 11:39 10 as important as the fact of filtration. 11:39 11 not only that, public health community, you 11:39 12 heard them, they were -- dr. henningfield, they 11:39 13 were expecting the lung cancer rates to go down. 11:39 14 but they did not. they did not. why? 11:39 15 finally, finally, when documents like these 11:39 16 get released, we finally find out why. when 11:39 17 dr. henningfield wrote the 1988 surgeon general's 11:39 18 report, he did not know -- he himself did not know 11:39 19 everything that they knew. and this man worked for 11:39 20 c. everett koop, the surgeon general, testified 11:39 21 before congress several times. he did not know all 11:39 22 that they knew. 11:39 23 and when that information came out, it made a 11:40 24 difference to him. would it have made a difference 11:40 25 to mr. ramsay? 11:40 1 you heard a little bit of testimony about this 11:40 2 pneumothorax. you heard a little bit of testimony 11:40 3 about this pneumothorax, about how he did not smoke 11:40 4 while he was in the hospital. what you also heard 11:40 5 was he was -- he had a tube stuck in his chest to 11:40 6 inflate his lung, and he was on some very powerful 11:40 7 pain medication. 11:40 8 so the follow-up to that came when mrs. bishop 11:40 9 was asked whether or not the doctor told her 11:40 10 husband whether smoking caused his pneumothorax. 11:40 11 and i believe the testimony was, he said it could 11:40 12 have. 11:40 13 does not really matter what the testimony was, 11:40 14 whether he said it could have, whether he said he 11:40 15 did not think it did. it is the unequivocal 11:40 16 statement that it was definitely caused by smoking. 11:41 17 that is what she was looking for. that is the 11:41 18 important thing. 11:41 19 all the rest of the stuff was kind of wissy -- 11:41 20 wishy-washy. maybe it did, maybe it did not. it 11:41 21 could have, i'm not sure. those kinds of things. 11:41 22 let us look at the tobacco and health research 11:41 23 procedural memo. 11:41 24 who was the target audience for this 11:41 25 particular document? doctors and scientists. and 11:41 1 if you will remember, the tobacco and health research 11:41 2 memo was this publication that they would send to 11:41 3 doctors giving other reasons why smoking was not the 11:41 4 cause of certain diseases. one of the headlines 11:41 5 said, "large birth causes cancer." those are the 11:41 6 kinds of things they were sending to doctors and 11:41 7 scientists. 11:41 8 this document, 1968, bert ramsay's 11:41 9 pneumothorax in the early '70s, '74, maybe. what 11:41 10 are they sending to these doctors? 11:41 11 let us go to that, down at the bottom there. 11:42 12 the most important type of story is that which 11:42 13 casts doubt on the cause-and-effect theory of 11:42 14 disease and smoking. 11:42 15 i asked dr. cummings why would you want to 11:42 16 send that to doctors. because you get it to the 11:42 17 patients. 11:42 18 the evidence is clear. i'm going to wrap it 11:42 19 up here. 11:42 20 the evidence is clear that these companies 11:42 21 figured out ways to make cigarettes the addictive 11:42 22 product that it became. they manipulated around 11:42 23 with the nicotine levels. they added ingredients 11:42 24 to make it easier to inhale. the easier it is to 11:42 25 inhale, the quicker the nicotine gets to the brain, 11:42 1 and you promote addiction by that means. 11:42 2 in addition to doing these things in secret, 11:42 3 what they also were doing in secret was taking a 11:43 4 look at -- taking a look back and seeing just how 11:43 5 effective their 50 years of lying and 11:43 6 deceitfulness, how effective that really was. 11:43 7 for nearly 20 years -- this document's in 11:43 8 evidence for you to read. for nearly 20 years, 11:43 9 this industry has employed a single strategy to 11:43 10 defend itself on three major fronts; litigation, 11:43 11 politics, and public opinion. 11:43 12 while the strategy was brilliantly 11:43 13 conceived -- they call themselves brilliant. they 11:43 14 had the nerve to make a product like they make, lie 11:43 15 to people about it, addict people, addict children, 11:43 16 make profits off of it, lie to them, and then blame 11:43 17 them for killing them. have the nerve to call 11:43 18 themselves brilliant. 11:43 19 and they concede and executed over the years, 11:43 20 helping us win important battles. it is only fair 11:43 21 to say that it is not, nor was it intended to be a 11:44 22 vehicle for victory. on the contrary, it has 11:44 23 always been a holding strategy consisting of 11:44 24 creating doubt about the health charge without 11:44 25 actually denying it. advocating the public's right 11:44 1 to smoke without actually urging them to take up 11:44 2 the practice. 11:44 3 that is the intervention. that is when 11:44 4 mr. ramsay's trying to quit. they say, no, you 11:44 5 do not need to quit. you have tried to quit. it is 11:44 6 too hard. go to these safer cigarettes. these 11:44 7 filters will take out stuff. these low tars will not 11:44 8 give you as much chemicals. 11:44 9 it is a lie. it was a lie. clearly, their 11:44 10 conspiracy and their concealment was a legal cause 11:44 11 of why bert ramsay died. without it, he would not 11:44 12 have. 11:44 13 that continued over into the 1980s with that 11:44 14 open debate campaign. it continued over into the 11:44 15 1980s with the vantage advertising. 11:44 16 i want to remind you just a couple of moments 11:45 17 of some of the testimony you heard, and then i'm 11:45 18 going to wrap it up soon. 11:45 19 dr. cummings. mr. ramsay was a model case of 11:45 20 the success of the industry's public relations 11:45 21 efforts giving smokers a psychological crutch and 11:45 22 self rationale to keep smoking. 11:45 23 he went from unfiltered to filtered 11:45 24 cigarettes, from filtered cigarettes to low-tar 11:45 25 cigarettes, just as the internal business records 11:45 1 of the defendants in this case wanted. he was a 11:45 2 success case in their view. 11:45 3 that is what dr. cummings testified to the 11:45 4 other day right before he was finished. 11:45 5 dr. henningfield. from a public health 11:45 6 perspective, the problem was they created the 11:45 7 illusion of a safer cigarette. i know the federal 11:45 8 scientists were as bamboozled as i was when i 11:46 9 started my research in the late '70s. we thought 11:46 10 less was less. we did not know that smokers were 11:46 11 not getting significantly less. 11:46 12 when dr. raffa finished testifying yesterday 11:46 13 morning, that chair was empty. somebody from the 11:46 14 tobacco companies could have came and told you 11:46 15 whether or not all the information dr. cummings and 11:46 16 dr. henningfield said -- 11:46 17 mr. walker: objection, your honor. 11:46 18 the court: come up for a second. 11:46 19 (a discussion is had on the record at sidebar 11:48 20 as follows: 11:48 21 the court: thank you. 11:48 22 mr. walker: your honor, i object to this 11:48 23 argument asking the jury to draw some sort of an 11:48 24 inference from the fact that a witness was not 11:48 25 called to testify. it is not an appropriate 11:48 1 argument under the case law. 11:48 2 mr. clark: it is fair comment to comment on 11:48 3 the fact that a party does not show up and explain a 11:48 4 material issue. we have case law on that. 11:48 5 it is not fair comment to comment on a witness 11:48 6 who is equally available to the -- to both sides. 11:48 7 but it is definitely fair comment to comment 11:48 8 on the fact that a party does not show up and say 11:48 9 something. 11:48 10 the court: yeah. equal availability, i 11:48 11 thought, was the test. this is always 11:48 12 uncomfortable. but i think that is the test, is 11:48 13 someone equally available. 11:48 14 mr. walker: he is talking about reynolds' 11:48 15 scientists. they are equally available to them. 11:48 16 there is testimony that they designated people on 11:48 17 the witness list, i think they could have called. 11:48 18 they did not call a scientist from reynolds to 11:48 19 address these issues. so i mean, there is some 11:48 20 cases. there are plaintiffs who put testimony in 11:48 21 they took on behalf of the scientist, whether it 11:48 22 was philip morris or anyone else. 11:48 23 the court: okay. well, if the argument is 11:48 24 that someone was not called to rebut something, i 11:48 25 think that is probably fair game. i understand, and 11:48 1 i think we have got the record. we will overrule the 11:48 2 objection. 11:48 3 (the sidebar discussion was concluded.) 11:48 4 mr. clark: like i was saying. somebody from 11:49 5 r.j. reynolds or philip morris could have came and 11:49 6 sat in that seat and told you that what 11:49 7 dr. cummings said was not accurate. 11:49 8 somebody could have came and told you that 11:49 9 these design features that dr. henningfield talked 11:49 10 about, the vent holes and the overwrap, the burn 11:49 11 accelerants and how they affect smoking, they could 11:49 12 have came and told you that was not what they were 11:49 13 doing. 11:49 14 but you did not get any of that. not a single 11:49 15 word. all you got was a bunch of articles about 11:49 16 what mr. ramsay may have known. 11:49 17 the questions are kind of similar, the 11:49 18 conspiracy and the concealment questions. so the 11:49 19 answer is clearly yes. their lies, their deceit, 11:49 20 and their cover-up caused bert ramsay's cancer and 11:49 21 death. they could not have done it alone. the 11:49 22 companies had to work together. that is your 11:49 23 conspiracy. 11:49 24 the only other question i want to talk about 11:49 25 on the verdict form is the question of 11:49 1 responsibility and fault. 11:49 2 after you get done with those questions, 11:49 3 you will be asked to assess how much mr. ramsay's at 11:49 4 fault, how much is r.j. reynolds at fault, how much 11:49 5 is philip morris at fault for causing this. 11:50 6 and you have heard, we have admitted that 11:50 7 mr. ramsay bears some responsibility. tried to 11:50 8 quit smoking. could have done it more. could have 11:50 9 done it better, could have tried harder. he is got 11:50 10 some fault in this, no doubt. 11:50 11 but they have got more. they have got more 11:50 12 because their superior knowledge, their 11:50 13 advantageous position, and their lies and deceit is 11:50 14 what led him to this. 11:50 15 so what you have is you have several entities 11:50 16 that you have been presented with. you have been 11:50 17 presented with r.j. reynolds, philip morris, ctr, 11:50 18 and the tobacco institute. and then you have bert 11:50 19 ramsay. 11:50 20 so the total has to equal a hundred percent. 11:50 21 so the only fair way i see it is give everybody 11:50 22 twenty percent. twenty percent to mr. ramsay, twenty percent 11:50 23 to r.j. reynolds, twenty percent to philip morris, but 11:50 24 they are responsible for the conduct of ctr and ti 11:50 25 because that was their organizations so they got to 11:50 1 bear that twenty percent on each one of them as well. 11:51 2 so i think a fair amount here would be 11:51 3 forty percent for reynolds, forty percent for philip 11:51 4 morris, and twenty percent for mr. ramsay. 11:51 5 ms. cherry: you have 55 minutes, mr. clark. 11:51 6 mr. clark: thank you. 11:51 7 from that frank statement, back in 1954, they 11:51 8 made promises they never intended to keep. they 11:51 9 attacked the surgeon general. they put profits 11:51 10 over people. and for the next 39 years that 11:51 11 mr. ramsay lived, they duped him, the public health 11:51 12 community, and the government, and anyone else who 11:51 13 dared to speak the truth. 11:51 14 these witnesses testified a lot. you heard 11:51 15 about all the different trials, how many trials 11:51 16 they have been testifying in. and you heard them 11:51 17 talk about why they do it. dr. henningfield told 11:51 18 you, this is a way i can get the truth out. this 11:52 19 is how i can educate people on what is going on. 11:52 20 i bet none of you in here knew, coming into 11:52 21 this courtroom two weeks ago, what you know now. 11:52 22 and dr. henningfield and dr. cummings told you that 11:52 23 20, 30, 40 years ago, they did not know it either. 11:52 24 but yet mr. ramsay somehow is supposed to be blamed 11:52 25 for what he did. 11:52 1 the choices made were mostly theirs. i'm 11:52 2 going to sit down now and let mr. berg have a few 11:52 3 minutes. but i thank you for listening to me. and 11:52 4 you will not have to hear me anymore. i'm all done. 11:52 5 thank you. 11:52 6 thank you, your honor. 11:52 10 closing argument 11:53 11 mr. berg: ladies and gentlemen, i want to 11:53 12 thank you on behalf of not just myself and 11:53 13 mr. clark, but ms. bishop. i think all the lawyers 11:53 14 in this room are going to tell you that you have been 11:53 15 one of the most attentive, question/answer asking 11:53 16 juries that we have ever had the pleasure to try a 11:53 17 case in front of. 11:53 18 we know you have been engaged. you have been 11:53 19 listening carefully, thinking about these issues, 11:53 20 and obviously trying to do the right thing in this 11:53 21 case. 11:53 22 you know, we have got this huge sign up here in 11:53 23 this beautiful courtroom about equal justice under 11:53 24 the law. and that phrase is used in other 11:53 25 countries. it is on other courtrooms. but they 11:53 1 make fun of it in other countries. the citizens 11:53 2 laugh about that because it is a joke. 11:53 3 but in our country, we take it seriously. 11:53 4 jurors like yourselves take it seriously, that they 11:54 5 come into a courtroom, there is no special interest, 11:54 6 there is a level playing field. we listen to the 11:54 7 evidence and have people from all walks of life 11:54 8 come together and come up with the right decision 11:54 9 and do justice under the law. 11:54 10 and so in this case, we are going to ask that 11:54 11 you, as this jury, stand up to these corporations, 11:54 12 to these companies, these tobacco companies, and 11:54 13 tell them with your verdict that we are not going to 11:54 14 tolerate, we are not going to stand for intentional 11:54 15 misconduct that destroys lives, that destroys 11:54 16 families. 11:54 17 you have heard about the 20 million families and 11:55 18 individuals that have been killed by these 11:55 19 products. and i want to get to it in a minute. 11:55 20 but i want to touch on one other thing first that 11:55 21 came up because, you know, we put on six days of 11:55 22 evidence of some of the most world-renowned 11:55 23 scientists and experts in these fields for you to 11:55 24 listen to, ask questions of, and testify. 11:55 25 and what we got from these two defendants was 11:55 1 a two-minute clip out of two full days of 11:55 2 deposition testimony of ms. bishop. that -- and 11:55 3 that was it. that is their rebuttal to the evidence 11:55 4 that you have heard. 11:55 5 we know that they have the capability to find 11:56 6 experts, to bring in qualified scientists -- 11:56 7 mr. walker: objection, your honor. 11:56 8 the court: sustained. can you just move on. 11:56 9 mr. berg: so i want to talk about what that 11:56 10 clip showed because that clip -- you heard a little 11:56 11 bit about this before, but that clip is really 11:56 12 important to the plaintiff's case in this matter. 11:56 13 i want to talk about it for a minute. 11:56 14 this collapsed lung -- and there is been a lot 11:56 15 of questions, a lot of discussion, a lot of 11:56 16 testimony about it. the collapsed lung is a 11:56 17 critical piece of evidence in this whole case. 11:56 18 it frames this case because what it tells us 11:56 19 is that ms. bishop, the reason she was upset with 11:56 20 the doctor at the time was because whether it was 11:57 21 caused by smoking or not, she wanted him to tell 11:57 22 her husband that it was caused by smoking. she 11:57 23 wanted there to be no doubt in mr. ramsay's mind 11:57 24 that smoking caused that collapsed lung, even if it 11:57 25 did not, so that he would quit. 11:57 1 and why do we know that that is so true and so 11:57 2 powerful? because the evidence in this case, the 11:57 3 evidence that these defendants did for 50 years was 11:57 4 create doubt. was create uncertainty. was create 11:57 5 a rationale for a smoker to keep smoking. the 11:57 6 whisper in the ear of, you can switch, you do not 11:58 7 have to quit, you are not going to die next week or 11:58 8 next month or next year. 11:58 9 they created the rationalization and denial 11:58 10 that addicted people cling to. it is not a 11:58 11 character flaw to be addicted. but they cling to 11:58 12 that self rationale, that rationalization. 11:58 13 and what addicted people need is certainty. 11:58 14 they need the information that tells them, you are 11:58 15 at rock bottom, or there is no doubt you are going to 11:58 16 die, or there is no doubt you are going to lose your 11:58 17 relationships or your life. 11:58 18 they need that to motivate to quit, to execute 11:59 19 on the quits, to follow through on the quits. 11:59 20 and that is why she wanted so badly for that 11:59 21 doctor to look him in the eye and say, what you 11:59 22 just went through felt like a heart attack, you are 11:59 23 in the hospital for two weeks while a tube's in 11:59 24 your lung reinflating it, that is from smoking, 11:59 25 mr. ramsay. she wanted that to be crystal clear. 11:59 1 no doubt, no self rationale, no denial, no 11:59 2 rationalization. 11:59 3 and what do we know about his addiction? that 11:59 4 the minute the doctor did not say those things, he 11:59 5 went right back. he went right back. he relapsed. 12:00 6 and you have heard that that is part of addiction, 12:00 7 relapsing, even in the face of harmful 12:00 8 consequences. 12:00 9 now, since this case is about bert ramsay and 12:00 10 about his wife, let us talk for a minute about him. 12:00 11 because you heard nothing bad about bert ramsay in 12:00 12 this case. 12:00 13 he was a good student, worked hard at it, 12:00 14 finished college, went into the military, served 12:00 15 admirably, stood face to face with 12:01 16 president kennedy presenting the troops, went to 12:01 17 work for a corporation that he spent his entire 12:01 18 career at, that he was loyal to, that he was the 12:01 19 kind of father that all the evidence you heard in 12:01 20 this case was they ate meals together, they did 12:01 21 things together, they went on vacations together. 12:01 22 they had a model family, loving, supporting. 12:01 23 you heard the pain from daughter, jennifer, 12:01 24 just thinking back about witnessing some 12:01 25 lighthearted dancing in the kitchen, i think she 12:01 1 was talking about, with her mom and dad as she 12:01 2 would see kind of from a distance, and those images 12:01 3 and memories of them and their relationship. 12:02 4 he was a good friend to people, like mike 12:02 5 criscitiello, and others. and although they 12:02 6 relocated a number of times, they uprooted from 12:02 7 their friends that they had developed, annie bishop 12:02 8 and mr. ramsay, they always had each other. they 12:02 9 had each other. they were best friends. they 12:02 10 talked about everything. they did things together. 12:02 11 you heard from jennifer about how she saw her 12:02 12 mother kind of lose her spark after mr. ramsay's 12:02 13 death. you know, his -- bert ramsay's life 12:02 14 mattered. it mattered to annie. it mattered to 12:03 15 his family and friends. and it mattered in the 12:03 16 same way that 20 million other deaths caused by 12:03 17 smoking mattered to their families. 12:03 18 so what was the evidence about bert ramsay's 12:03 19 character? again, nothing bad or unfavorable. he 12:03 20 did the right things. he played by all the rules. 12:03 21 played by all the rules to do the right thing. 12:03 22 but what about the character of r.j. reynolds 12:03 23 and philip morris? you know, your parents and your 12:03 24 teachers and your pastors, they tell you that 12:04 25 character is what you do when no one's watching. 12:04 1 mr. walker: objection, your honor. 12:04 2 the court: overruled. 12:04 3 please continue. 12:04 4 mr. berg: and what did these companies do 12:04 5 when they did not think anybody was watching? was 12:04 6 it -- what was it that they were doing in secret? 12:04 7 because that is where they were telling the truth to 12:04 8 each other. not what they were going to tell to 12:04 9 the public. but we know the truth was coming out 12:04 10 in their secret, confidential memos and discussions 12:04 11 going on. 12:04 12 and that is the nature of the character of 12:04 13 these defendants. they want to be, and the law 12:04 14 treats them as people. not corporations, as 12:04 15 people. the same rights, the same obligations. 12:04 16 there is a lot of information you see and a lot 12:05 17 that you are going to see in the documents and the 12:05 18 records. and you are going to have to ask yourself, 12:05 19 is there anything that you have been shown that shows 12:05 20 any kind of concern on the part of these defendants 12:05 21 for the american public? any concern for the 12:05 22 health and safety of any of their own customers, 12:05 23 people like bert ramsay? 12:05 24 and in his openings statements, mr. walker, 12:05 25 and i'm sure in his closing, will say things to you 12:05 1 like, when bert ramsay was motivated to quit, he 12:05 2 quit. 12:06 3 and my question to you is: when were these 12:06 4 men of tobacco, when were they motivated to quit? 12:06 5 motivated to quit lying to the public about the 12:06 6 relationship between lung cancer and smoking? 12:06 7 motivated to quit about the addictiveness of 12:06 8 nicotine that they knew about and hid from the 12:06 9 public? motivated to quit this 50-year conspiracy 12:06 10 from which none of them broke ranks, that killed 12:06 11 20 million of their best customers for using the 12:06 12 product exactly the way they intended it to be 12:06 13 used. 12:06 14 so your verdict cannot bring bert ramsay back. 12:07 15 and the time for sympathy and apologies is long 12:07 16 gone. so we are here in this courtroom. there is no 12:07 17 surprise. we have talked about it from the 12:07 18 beginning. you understand that this case is about 12:07 19 what drove these two corporations and others all 12:07 20 those years. what they made every decision based 12:07 21 on, and that was profits, money. and today, under 12:07 22 our system, the only way for your verdict to do 12:07 23 justice in this case is to award money damages. 12:07 24 now, again, the unrebutted testimony that you 12:07 25 heard from the economist, dr. raffa -- and like any 12:07 1 of the testimony, you decide, you heard, you may 12:08 2 think that there is things that were not properly 12:08 3 considered or that should be looked at differently. 12:08 4 but his testimony was that there were several 12:08 5 levels, and he talked about the support and the 12:08 6 services, the net accumulations that were losses to 12:08 7 ms. bishop. 12:08 8 and you may recall that his -- his numbers 12:08 9 were for the present value of the loss of support 12:08 10 that she would have received. again, bert ramsay, 12:08 11 he had really gone up the chain. he was making a 12:08 12 good living. 12:08 13 and so the amount of money that the evidence 12:09 14 has shown that would have been the present value, 12:09 15 this is minus the pension that she was entitled to 12:09 16 that you heard about for loss of support to her, 12:09 17 was $792,716. and then the loss of services to her 12:09 18 was $123,055. 12:09 19 and then in addition, he talked about the net 12:09 20 accumulations to the estate. and that was the 12:09 21 amount that, after they had spent for various 12:09 22 living expenses, approximately seventy percent of the 12:09 23 income that he made, that there would be this 12:09 24 remainder that would be the savings expected over 12:09 25 the course of his life. 12:09 1 and so that figure of the net accumulations to 12:09 2 the estate was $778,623. 12:09 3 the total was $1,694,394. 12:10 4 and that is a significant figure. that is a 12:10 5 significant figure. and on your verdict form, 12:10 6 you will see there are questions eight and nine, 12:10 7 those are the net accumulations, and then the 12:10 8 support and services figures. and actually, that 12:10 9 support and services is added together. so that 12:10 10 figure of the $792,716 plus the $123,055, that 12:10 11 total which would be on that line, number nine, on 12:10 12 the verdict form, is $915,771. 12:10 13 but despite the significance of that, the 12:11 14 human loss, the human loss in this case, which goes 12:11 15 to the next question, to the amount of damages 12:11 16 sustained by annie bishop for the loss of her 12:11 17 husband's companionship, for her pain and suffering 12:11 18 as a result of robert ramsay's injury and death, 12:11 19 that is significant too. that is significant too. 12:11 20 and there is no exact figures for that. 12:11 21 there is no precise calculations. it is evidence 12:11 22 that you, as the jury, decide is fair and just in 12:11 23 light of all the evidence. and that is the 12:11 24 instructions that you heard. 12:11 25 so you are going to have to struggle through 12:11 1 that question on your own to try to figure out what 12:11 2 you think is fair and reasonable. 12:11 3 we can give suggestions or suggest what we 12:12 4 think the evidence has shown in relation to the 12:12 5 amount of the economic damages. we are suggesting 12:12 6 that the figure for her loss of companionship, and 12:12 7 pain and suffering for these past 22 years should 12:12 8 be $5 million. and that the evidence supports 12:12 9 that. 12:12 10 if you think that is too high, then you adjust 12:12 11 it accordingly. if you think it is too low, you 12:12 12 adjust it accordingly. that decision is yours to 12:12 13 make. 12:12 14 because you are going to have to ask, what is it 12:12 15 worth to lose your best friend, what is it worth to 12:12 16 lose the father that you see interact with your 12:12 17 children, who were in their twenties at the time, 12:12 18 what is the value and what is the worth of seeing and 12:12 19 experiencing the death, not having the interaction 12:13 20 with the grandchildren that you have heard about and 12:13 21 seen in this case. what is it worth to lose your 12:13 22 husband, the only man that you have been with since 12:13 23 you were 17 years old, 31 years, and he -- they 12:13 24 were both just 51 when he died. 12:13 25 ms. cherry: you are at 20 minutes, mr. berg. 12:13 1 mr. berg: thank you. 12:13 2 what is it worth to have your lasting images 12:13 3 seared in your head of your son carrying your 12:13 4 husband because he cannot walk, his body's ravaged 12:13 5 by cancer, and those final days and months and how 12:13 6 quickly he went. 12:13 7 finally, you are going to be asked in this 12:14 8 case, on the final question, to determine whether 12:14 9 punitive damages are warranted in this case. 12:14 10 damages that are meant specifically to punish the 12:14 11 actions, the conduct, the behavior of these two 12:14 12 defendants. and that is question number 11. 12:14 13 you heard the instructions for that. and 12:14 14 what is interesting about those instructions on the 12:14 15 punitive damages is that you are asked to consider, 12:14 16 by the clear and convincing evidence, that did 12:14 17 their conduct -- and i'm not reading the entirety 12:14 18 of this, so rely on the instructions that you have 12:15 19 with you or will be provided to you. but that 12:15 20 show, number one, a reckless disregard of human 12:15 21 life or the safety of persons. they obviously did 12:15 22 that, the evidence has shown. 12:15 23 number two, that their conduct has been 12:15 24 consciously indifferent to the consequences. that 12:15 25 is certainly true. 12:15 1 number three, their conduct has wantonly or 12:15 2 recklessly disregarded the safety and welfare of 12:15 3 the public. we know from the evidence that that is 12:15 4 proven by the clear and convincing evidence. 12:15 5 and number four, that the conduct showed such 12:15 6 reckless indifference to the rights of others as to 12:15 7 be the equivalent to an intentional violation of 12:15 8 those -- those rights. 12:15 9 you will see in that -- in that series of 12:15 10 questions that between each of those four is -- 12:16 11 four elements is the word "or." you only have to 12:16 12 decide that the clear and convincing evidence 12:16 13 established one of those things. and it is clear 12:16 14 that all four have been met in this case. 12:16 15 and in conclusion, these -- these defendants, 12:16 16 they did what they did knowing that people were 12:16 17 going to die, that people were dying, and they kept 12:16 18 on doing it. and that is the kind of conduct that 12:16 19 warrants punitive damages in a way to punish them 12:17 20 and to deter others. 12:17 21 so in this courtroom, ladies and gentlemen, 12:17 22 you have the power. you have the power to right a 12:17 23 wrong. you have the power to tell these two 12:17 24 defendants that that type of conduct is not going to 12:17 25 be tolerated. 12:17 1 and so we would suggest to you, as i asked you 12:17 2 in opening, that it is a case about truth and what 12:17 3 these defendants did to the truth. and it is a case 12:17 4 about consequences. and we are asking that they 12:17 5 face those consequences today with your verdict. 12:17 6 thank you. 12:18 17 mr. berg: thank you, your honor. 15:43:07 18 i was -- i was interested to see that 15:43:09 19 photograph with the fork in the road because i think 15:43:15 20 it made clear in this case what you have heard about 15:43:19 21 the fork in the road that the tobacco companies had 15:43:23 22 the choice about back in 1953. 15:43:27 23 back in 1953, when there was the cancer scare 15:43:30 24 came out and they all locked arms and went to the 15:43:35 25 plaza hotel, where they began this 50-year 15:43:38 1 conspiracy, it was at that point where they could 15:43:43 2 have taken the right direction. they could have 15:43:46 3 taken the direction of being upfront, telling the 15:43:49 4 truth, disclosing the information that they already 15:43:53 5 knew about, and that they were learning about, or 15:43:56 6 they could take the road that they chose. 15:43:59 7 and they took the road to conceal, to lie, to 15:44:02 8 create this cover-up and conspiracy that would last 15:44:08 9 for the next 50 years. 15:44:12 10 mr. walker made a lot of comments about 15:44:16 11 specific things that the tobacco companies did not 15:44:19 12 say. and yet, this case is equally about the 15:44:22 13 omissions, the things they did not say that they knew 15:44:32 14 about. 15:44:33 15 so, they knew that smoking caused lung cancer. 15:44:34 16 and they made a conscious effort to create doubt 15:44:40 17 about that, to never really completely deny it: 15:44:46 18 possibly we will look into it, it needs more research, 15:44:51 19 we are not really sure, we are going to try to find 15:44:55 20 out. 15:44:58 21 did they know that nicotine was addictive early 15:45:02 22 on? yes, they did. and no, they did not come out 15:45:06 23 and say nicotine's not addictive. but they knew it 15:45:10 24 was addictive and they never came out and told the 15:45:15 25 american public when they knew that it was. 15:45:18 1 what could have happened? what could have 15:45:22 2 happened if they had done that simple thing: tell 15:45:27 3 the truth about the addictiveness of nicotine back 15:45:31 4 in the early 60s, late '50s, when they knew about 15:45:36 5 these things? 15:45:40 6 we have already seen what the modern markets do. 15:45:41 7 what modern medicine has done with patches and 15:45:47 8 lozenges and nasal sprays and other -- chantix and 15:45:51 9 wellbutrin and dependency clinics. we have already 15:45:57 10 seen those things come into being that have given a 15:46:02 11 lot of addicted smokers the ability to quit. 15:46:05 12 the ability to say, hey, it is not just me, it is 15:46:09 13 not just a character flaw, that i cannot quit. i 15:46:12 14 know i cannot quit, but now that people would learn 15:46:17 15 that it is an addictive substance, that it is 15:46:22 16 addictive like heroin or like cocaine and that 15:46:26 17 you have got to treat it in that way, you have got to 15:46:29 18 treat getting off of it, with some people, like 15:46:33 19 mr. ramsay, you have got to treat it in that kind of 15:46:37 20 way that you would treat another addictive 15:46:40 21 substance. 15:46:43 22 and so instead of -- you have seen these graphs 15:46:44 23 of the consumption chart and the cancer chart. so 15:46:48 24 instead of that chart, that graph, just escalating, 15:46:54 25 escalating and escalating and then does it turn. 15:47:01 1 you have all seen it come back down. 15:47:04 2 you have seen it come back down. 15:47:07 3 why does it come back down? it is come back 15:47:09 4 down for several reasons. one is, a lot of the 15:47:13 5 people of burt ramsay's era -- we have talked about 15:47:16 6 this -- where smoking was everywhere, three out of 15:47:21 7 four men of his era were smokers. so we are finding 15:47:24 8 that as it goes up, that era, those people are 15:47:30 9 dying. and so there is some decrease related to 15:47:36 10 that. 15:47:39 11 there is some decrease based on modern medicine 15:47:39 12 and what is happening in terms of nicotine 15:47:42 13 replacement and therapies that way. 15:47:46 14 but probably the most important thing is -- is 15:47:49 15 as we sit here in 2014, people know, they know what 15:47:53 16 the problem with cigarettes is. there is no 15:48:02 17 ambiguity about it. there is no doubt, no 15:48:05 18 uncertainty, people in this era know about the 15:48:10 19 addictiveness and they know about the 15:48:14 20 disease-causing manner of -- of smoking. 15:48:18 21 so with all that and with that knowledge, that 15:48:24 22 graph is coming back down. it is coming back down. 15:48:27 23 and that could have happened 50 years earlier. 15:48:31 24 fifty years. 15:48:35 25 and, yeah, mr. walker's upset that i've said 20 15:48:35 1 million people. well, that is 20 million folks with 15:48:39 2 hopes and dreams and aspirations just like -- just 15:48:46 3 like mr. ramsay. they are not just points on a 15:48:52 4 graph. they are not just statistics for the tobacco 15:48:55 5 companies to keep track of. they are real human 15:48:57 6 beings. 15:49:00 7 and if we are doing this 50 years earlier, 15:49:00 8 that is a lot of american lives, a lot of american 15:49:06 9 families that are saved. 15:49:10 10 now, mr. walker got up here, i thought they 15:49:13 11 must not have ever cross-examined any of our 15:49:22 12 witnesses that we put up there the way he was 15:49:24 13 talking. if they thought dr. villa was such a great 15:49:26 14 witness, which, of course, he was, why were they so 15:49:31 15 determined to try to cross-examine him and get him 15:49:35 16 to say things that smoking did not cause the lung 15:49:39 17 cancer; that it was not primary; that he did not have 15:49:43 18 this information; that he did not do an autopsy, et 15:49:46 19 cetera? 15:49:46 20 but why did not they just come in here and say, 15:49:51 21 of course smoking caused his lung cancer. we are not 15:49:54 22 contesting that. 15:49:59 23 but no, they had to spend their 45 minutes 15:50:00 24 pulling out other depositions and parsing words with 15:50:05 25 dr. villa when it was obvious that dr. villa was 15:50:09 1 saying, without any doubt, this gentleman has 15:50:13 2 primary lung cancer, it is caused by smoking, and 15:50:19 3 that is the cause of his death. 15:50:24 4 period, end of story on that. 15:50:25 5 but no, we did not get that. 15:50:28 6 and then now dr. hurt is all of a sudden -- 15:50:30 7 they are going to pull out some words from his 15:50:33 8 testimony to suggest that somehow he supports their 15:50:35 9 arguments in this case? 15:50:41 10 dr. hurt testified that mr. ramsay was severely 15:50:43 11 addicted. there was no question about that. that 15:50:48 12 he looked at him with all the evidence, all the 15:50:54 13 deposition transcripts, all the medical records, 15:50:58 14 based on his 25 years at the mayo clinic and the 15:51:02 15 tobacco dependency aspect. hundreds and hundreds of 15:51:09 16 peer-reviewed articles and lectures in public health 15:51:12 17 on smoking and tobacco cessation. 15:51:15 18 he talked about that heaviness of smoking 15:51:24 19 index. he said, that is not the only thing i looked 15:51:26 20 at. that is not the only thing i based it on. but 15:51:28 21 if i was to use one test, if i had to, if there was 15:51:34 22 one test to determine addiction, that is the best 15:51:41 23 one. that is the one that they teach medical doctors 15:51:44 24 to use. they teach referring doctors to use. they 15:51:48 25 teach their own consultants at the mayo clinic to 15:51:52 1 use. 15:51:57 2 so that is a -- a test, but it is not the only 15:51:58 3 thing. 15:52:03 4 you heard him talk about the quit attempts. 15:52:04 5 you heard him talk about some spontaneous 15:52:07 6 pneumothorax and what that meant as far as addiction 15:52:11 7 and how clear that was for addiction. 15:52:14 8 he does not say that the minute the nicotine is 15:52:19 9 physically half-lifed out of your body that all of a 15:52:26 10 sudden the nicotine-addicted smoker has no more 15:52:30 11 desire, has no more relapsability to go back to 15:52:35 12 smoking. 15:52:39 13 he said nothing like that. 15:52:41 14 he talked about the cravings, the triggers, the 15:52:44 15 cues, to return and to relapse are there for months 15:52:47 16 and even years with some people. but at least 15:52:54 17 months. 15:52:57 18 and so that is -- that is a very powerful 15:52:58 19 indication of -- of the power that nicotine held 15:53:04 20 over this gentleman; that he could return. that he 15:53:07 21 would risk his own health; that he would risk or 15:53:12 22 somehow self-deny, rationalize, whatever words we 15:53:16 23 want to call it, somehow his family in order to 15:53:21 24 return to nicotine. 15:53:26 25 that was a clear indication of his addiction. 15:53:30 1 now, on that first question, about addiction, 15:53:34 2 there is no question there about whether he could 15:53:39 3 have quit, should have quit. is it fault? might 15:53:42 4 have been at fault, any of that. that comes later 15:53:46 5 on the verdict form. 15:53:49 6 that question about allocation of fault comes 15:53:49 7 later down on the verdict form. in that first 15:53:53 8 question, that is not part of the question. 15:53:56 9 it is simply: was he addicted to nicotine in 15:53:59 10 the cigarettes, and was that a legal cause of his 15:54:05 11 lung cancer and death? was it a substantial 15:54:08 12 contributing cause, his addiction? and not an 15:54:10 13 insignificant cause? 15:54:21 14 was it something that substantially contributed 15:54:21 15 to him continuing to smoke and develop the lung 15:54:22 16 cancer? 15:54:22 17 and all the evidence in the case, all the 15:54:26 18 testimony that you heard, all of it said "yes" to 15:54:28 19 that question. 15:54:33 20 there is nothing other than their implication, 15:54:34 21 their speculation on the other side that he was not 15:54:37 22 addicted. all the testimony from the witnesses is 15:54:40 23 that he was hooked; that he could not stop; that he 15:54:45 24 could not quit; all the language of addiction. 15:54:50 25 dr. hurt, dr. henningfield, there -- there was 15:54:53 1 nothing in rebuttal to that. 15:54:59 2 so that -- that first question is clear. 15:55:01 3 that is unambiguous; that he was addicted and that 15:55:06 4 that was a legal cause. 15:55:10 5 now, if you want to decide later on -- and 15:55:12 6 we have admitted that he bears responsibility, bears 15:55:15 7 some responsibility. and we have not shirked from 15:55:18 8 that at all. it is shared responsibility. 15:55:22 9 so if you want to answer that question down 15:55:27 10 below, then that is where that is appropriate to 15:55:32 11 address that. 15:55:36 12 the other thing that mr. walker talked about 15:55:37 13 was -- and you are going to see this. you are going 15:55:42 14 to see these engle findings again, and what is -- 15:55:59 15 what is important about these is that when you answer 15:56:02 16 the question on addiction, when you answer that 15:56:08 17 first question, that he was addicted and it was the 15:56:11 18 legal cause, when you answer that question "yes," 15:56:18 19 these findings have already been determined. 15:56:22 20 they have already been determined. 15:56:26 21 now, mr. walker spent an hour up here talking 15:56:28 22 about bits and pieces of different conduct, 15:56:32 23 suggesting that their conduct really was not that 15:56:38 24 bad; really was not negligent; really was not 15:56:42 25 concealing; was not fraudulent. 15:56:49 1 but the problem with that, ladies and 15:56:50 2 gentlemen, is that the engle findings have already 15:56:54 3 determined this. if this was a year-long trial 15:56:56 4 where you -- they heard more evidence than anything 15:56:59 5 compared to what this is -- 15:57:01 6 mr. walker: objection, your honor. 15:57:02 7 the court: hold on one second. sustained. 15:57:04 8 mr. berg: you are going to get all this 15:57:07 9 evidence in the case. please look through it 15:57:08 10 carefully. there is a lot there. the surgeon 15:57:11 11 general reports in their entirety are there to be 15:57:14 12 looked at. all these different records from which 15:57:17 13 pieces have -- have been shown for benefit of time, 15:57:21 14 they are all in there. 15:57:25 15 go through those records carefully, carefully 15:57:27 16 yourself. take the time to look at them and see 15:57:31 17 what they have to say. 15:57:34 18 but these engle findings have already been 15:57:35 19 established. and the first couple we have talked 15:57:37 20 about and so there is not much issue at all. 15:57:43 21 no. 3: the finding is, "r.j. reynolds and 15:57:46 22 philip morris were negligent." so we know that is 15:57:49 23 been established. 15:57:53 24 no. 4: "r.j. reynolds and philip morris placed 15:57:54 25 cigarettes on the market that were defective and 15:57:58 1 unreasonably dangerous." that is established. 15:58:00 2 no. 5: "r.j. reynolds and philip morris 15:58:04 3 concealed or omitted material information not 15:58:08 4 otherwise known or available, knowing that the 15:58:12 5 material was false and misleading, or failed to 15:58:17 6 disclose a material fact concerning the health 15:58:20 7 effects and/or addictive nature of smoking 15:58:25 8 cigarettes." 15:58:29 9 so we are being told this as having been 15:58:30 10 determined that they concealed and omitted material 15:58:33 11 information that was not otherwise known to the 15:58:39 12 public or to burt ramsay, and that is been determined 15:58:44 13 by the engle findings that you have been instructed 15:58:47 14 with the answer to burt ramsay being a class member. 15:58:50 15 mr. walker: objection, your honor. 15:58:54 16 the court: hold on one second. 15:58:54 17 mr. walker: objection. 15:58:56 18 the court: overruled. 15:58:58 19 mr. berg: and then no. 6: "that r.j. reynolds 15:59:02 20 and philip morris entered into an agreement to 15:59:04 21 conceal or omit information regarding the health 15:59:08 22 effects of cigarettes or their addictive nature with 15:59:11 23 the intention that smokers and the public would rely 15:59:14 24 on this information to their detriment." 15:59:18 25 again, these matters are all established 15:59:21 1 already in this case once you find class membership. 15:59:27 2 mr. walker spent quite a bit of time attacking 15:59:38 3 the public health experts that came and testified in 15:59:56 4 this trial, attacking dr. henningfield, who you 16:00:02 5 remember did the cigarette dissection. 16:00:07 6 attacking dr. cummings, attacking dr. hurt. 16:00:09 7 and, you know, this -- these defendants, they spent 16:00:14 8 50 years attacking the public health community. 16:00:20 9 mr. walker: objection, your honor. 16:00:24 10 the court: overruled. 16:00:26 11 mr. walker: (inaudible). 16:00:29 12 mr. berg: so we heard them go after these 16:00:33 13 people and impugn their integrity. you know, 16:00:37 14 they are mercenaries, they are generals in the public 16:00:42 15 health war. well, if they are mercenaries, then we 16:00:48 16 need more mercenaries. we need more folks looking 16:00:53 17 out for the public health of american citizens. 16:00:57 18 quitting, like any addiction, quitting an 16:01:18 19 addiction does not mean you were not addicted. people 16:01:24 20 with addictions quit. they are able to. they do it, 16:01:30 21 they struggle to do it. some struggle more than 16:01:39 22 others. but the fact that someone struggles and 16:01:42 23 tries and tries and ultimately quits is -- is now 16:01:44 24 being suggest ed that it -- if that happens, if they 16:01:50 25 do that, if they make those efforts and if they are 16:01:53 1 ultimately successful, that means they were never 16:01:56 2 addicted in the first place. 16:01:58 3 you did not hear anything like that in this 16:02:01 4 trial from any of these witnesses. nothing like 16:02:03 5 that, even close to the argument that if you are able 16:02:06 6 to quit, you are not addicted. 16:02:11 7 mr. walker seems to feel that the evidence that 16:02:13 8 came from the witness stand about the brain of young 16:02:34 9 people of adolescent and how it is affected by drugs 16:02:39 10 such as nicotine, that somehow that meant that the 16:02:43 11 minute a person turns 18, they do not have those 16:02:47 12 changes anymore. 16:02:49 13 the minute they turn 21, they do not have those 16:02:50 14 changes anymore. 16:02:53 15 that is not what the evidence was. the evidence 16:02:54 16 is the brain is still forming, and these drugs make 16:02:57 17 their changes in that time frame to teenagers and 16:03:01 18 kids and because of that, their addiction tends to 16:03:07 19 be more severe and long-lasting into adulthood. not 16:03:12 20 the minute they turn 18, all of a sudden it is a 16:03:16 21 brand-new ball game. there is no witnesses or 16:03:19 22 testimony that said what he seems to be suggesting. 16:03:23 23 these -- these issues with the filters, and the 16:03:32 24 low tar, you were shown a statement from 16:03:45 25 dr. henningfield that dr. henningfield said -- his 16:03:47 1 testimony was, when he made that statement about low 16:03:53 2 tar or filtered being better in his opinion than 16:03:58 3 unfiltered, that was before he knew. that was 16:04:04 4 before he knew. 16:04:08 5 so mr. walker's clipped out that testimony when 16:04:09 6 dr. henningfield said, that was before we got 16:04:15 7 millions of pages of documents that had previously 16:04:19 8 been secret in the late '90s. and before that, we 16:04:23 9 thought maybe it was. he was almost embarrassed 16:04:29 10 that he, as a significant member of the public 16:04:32 11 health community, had been bamboozled. that was his 16:04:36 12 word. he was truly embarrassed by the fact that the 16:04:40 13 public health community had been defrauded and 16:04:45 14 fooled in the same way that the american public had 16:04:49 15 been, in terms of filters and low tar. 16:04:53 16 so low tar. let us talk about that for a 16:04:56 17 minute. what does -- what -- what does any 16:05:00 18 reasonable person think when the term "low tar" 16:05:02 19 comes out and it is used by the companies in the way 16:05:07 20 that it was used? is it anything other than it is 16:05:10 21 safer? is there any commonsense interpretation that 16:05:14 22 it is anything other than safer, wink, wink, whatever 16:05:18 23 you want to call it? 16:05:24 24 they were very careful. they were very 16:05:25 25 specific not to say "safer," but what did they want 16:05:30 1 the american public to believe? what did they want 16:05:35 2 the smoker to believe? 16:05:39 3 that it was safer. safer to go that route than 16:05:41 4 to quit, safer to switch, go to the low tar; and 16:05:45 5 mr. ramsay, who was knowledgeable, well-read, 16:05:53 6 intelligent, he -- he tracked along with exactly 16:05:58 7 that model. 16:06:03 8 he was -- he was a success story of the tobacco 16:06:04 9 companies. when filters came out, he went there. 16:06:08 10 when low tar came out, he went there. when this 16:06:13 11 new-fangled filter that is on that vantage ad, that 16:06:19 12 commercial, can that ad mean anything other than 16:06:24 13 that -- that they are representing that that filter 16:06:26 14 is somehow going to purify or take bad things out of 16:06:29 15 tobacco? can it have any other connotation to the 16:06:35 16 american public? of course not. 16:06:39 17 it is meant to communicate more safe. 16:06:42 18 it is meant to communicate healthier. 16:06:45 19 and that is exactly what they did, for years and 16:06:49 20 years and years. 16:06:52 21 you know, they -- we saw a lot of reader's 16:06:57 22 digest in this trial. but what was interesting to 16:07:12 23 me was that these executive officers of these 16:07:16 24 tobacco companies, they must have never read 16:07:22 25 reader's digest. they must have never read those 16:07:24 1 articles, because every time they made a public 16:07:29 2 statement, every time they were in the press, on tv, 16:07:33 3 on a news show, asked about it, in response to the 16:07:39 4 public health, every single time, they said, it 16:07:42 5 does not cause cancer. we are not aware of it being 16:07:47 6 addictive. 16:07:51 7 but the american public is supposed to know all 16:07:56 8 those things. 16:07:59 9 the american smoke -- smoker is supposed to 16:08:01 10 know all those things. 16:08:04 11 why would they spend 200 -- you know, these -- 16:08:06 12 these companies they do not spend money stupidly. 16:08:11 13 they do not waste money. and they spent 200 billion 16:08:16 14 dollars on advertising over the course of burt 16:08:23 15 ramsay's life. 200 billion dollars to communicate 16:08:26 16 these different claims and filters and low tar and 16:08:31 17 different brands of their cigarettes. 16:08:36 18 and they did it because it worked; because we 16:08:40 19 see the consumption scale just keep going up during 16:08:45 20 that whole time. it worked. 16:08:48 21 ms. cherry: 25 minutes. 16:09:14 22 mr. berg: there is a -- i'd like to run a 16:09:14 23 short compilation of some of the ads that you have 16:09:16 24 seen -- or some of the press statements that you have 16:09:21 25 seen in this case. 16:09:23 1 (on video.) 16:09:35 2 * * * * 16:09:35 3 male speaker: (inaudible) this is a 16:09:35 4 (inaudible) of one of the major producers. 16:09:37 5 i am dr. robert dupuis, chairman of the 16:09:39 6 technical group of the tobacco industry research 16:09:44 7 committee. 16:09:44 8 (inaudible) and so far we have not. we are 16:09:48 9 removing from smoke and still retain the pleasure of 16:09:52 10 your favorite cigarette. 16:09:56 11 i do not believe that most people who smoke get 16:09:59 12 lung cancer. we have smoking habits. this is 16:10:02 13 another incidental (inaudible). we want 16:10:05 14 (inaudible), just as much as the surgeon general did 16:10:13 15 and will cooperate in every way. 16:10:15 16 when you say there is something toxic about 16:10:17 17 tobacco or (inaudible) removal by filter? 16:10:21 18 well, obviously (inaudible) i do not think 16:10:25 19 (inaudible) admits there are any bad elements. 16:10:32 20 throughout our entire history the surgeon general, 16:10:35 21 the a.m.a. (inaudible). and the outcome, it will be 16:10:40 22 removed. 16:10:45 23 we have no program that i know of to try to 16:10:45 24 help people to stop smoking. we do talk to the 16:10:48 25 question of whether or not cigarettes are hazardous. 16:10:54 1 we do not believe that cigarettes are hazardous. we 16:10:57 2 do not accept that. 16:11:01 3 as a manufacturer of the world's 16:11:03 4 biggest-selling cigarette, are you concerned that 16:11:05 5 the world health organization said that cigarettes 16:11:09 6 are the cause of a worldwide epidemic because you 16:11:11 7 see at present, kills hundreds and thousands of 16:11:15 8 smokers every day? 16:11:17 9 male speaker: am i concerned? i'm concerned 16:11:18 10 i've considered the possibility (inaudible). i'm 16:11:21 11 concerned that people make claims, including those 16:11:24 12 against our products, without adequate knowledge. 16:11:29 13 there has not been the sort of research (inaudible) 16:11:33 14 cigarette to be able to say. 16:11:36 15 male speaker: it was suspect from the start. 16:11:37 16 atw secretary (inaudible) launched his antismoking 16:11:40 17 campaign a year ago with all the zeal of a reformed 16:11:44 18 sinner. and now in an apparent attempt to bring 16:11:47 19 some science to the side of his new evangelism, the 16:11:50 20 former three-pack-a-day secretary told the surgeon 16:11:54 21 general, prepare a new report. 16:11:58 22 (music) we asked philip morris, r.j. reynolds, 16:12:00 23 brown & williamson and lorillard to appear on this 16:12:03 24 program. none would. they told us to talk to the 16:12:05 25 tobacco institute. the institute sent anne browder 16:12:10 1 to speak for them. 16:12:13 2 female speaker: the jury has not come in. 16:12:15 3 male speaker: it may not be harmful. you are 16:12:18 4 not convinced. 16:12:19 5 female speaker: it may be or it may not be. 16:12:21 6 male speaker: you are saying that smoking does 16:12:23 7 not cause cancer? yes or no? 16:12:25 8 male speaker: it is not known whether 16:12:27 9 cigarettes cause cancer. that has not been causally 16:12:28 10 established. 16:12:32 11 male speaker: cigarette smoking, no causal 16:12:33 12 relationship between cigarette smoking and 16:12:33 13 emphysema? 16:12:33 14 male speaker: despite all of the research to 16:12:35 15 date there has been no causal link established. 16:12:36 16 male speaker: no causal relationship between 16:12:40 17 cigarette smoking and heart disease? 16:12:43 18 male speaker: no. as a matter of fact, there 16:12:44 19 are studies that while we are accused of being 16:12:46 20 associated with heart disease, there have been 16:12:48 21 studies conducted over ten years that would say 16:12:51 22 again that science is still puzzled over these 16:12:54 23 forces. 16:12:57 24 that is (inaudible) arbitrarily placed here by 16:12:58 25 american tobacco institute? 16:13:05 1 male speaker: no, it is not. 16:13:05 2 male speaker: would you put that warning 16:13:05 3 (inaudible) 16:13:08 4 male speaker: no. 16:13:08 5 male speaker: (inaudible.) 16:13:10 6 male speaker: certainly do. 16:13:12 7 male speaker: you do not think the kind of 16:13:13 8 smokers who we believe -- 16:13:18 9 our product is not injurious to health 16:13:19 10 (video concluded.) 14:17:05 11 * * * * 16:13:25 12 mr. berg: the warnings that were placed at the 16:13:25 13 beginning of the -- the caution in 1966, which was a 16:13:27 14 cautionary warning, burt ramsay had already been a 16:13:32 15 smoker for almost ten years at that point. a 16:13:36 16 regular smoker. 16:13:40 17 by the time it went to 1970 and there was a 16:13:41 18 warning that it was dangerous, he switched to -- to 16:13:43 19 low tar. and he already had been a smoker for well 16:13:46 20 over 12 years at that point, an addicted smoker. 16:13:55 21 our burden of proof in this case is the greater 16:13:59 22 weight of the evidence. it is a slight tipping of 16:14:02 23 the scales. it does not mean you cannot have any 16:14:05 24 questions. it does not mean you cannot have any 16:14:09 25 doubts. it just means that the evidence that you 16:14:12 1 hear and that you decide, you feel as though it 16:14:16 2 weighs more, it persuades more, it makes more common 16:14:19 3 sense. and that is the burden of proof in a civil 16:14:24 4 case, which is what we are here on today. 16:14:27 5 i have two last things to say to you and then 16:14:30 6 i'm going to sit down. 16:14:37 7 the -- mr. ramsay, he had -- the evidence in 16:14:39 8 this case is that he had a right to know, he had a 16:14:48 9 right to know about the additives being placed in 16:14:51 10 these cigarettes. he had a right to know that and 16:14:57 11 make a full, informed choice, that he did not have 16:14:58 12 that information. and he would have and should have 16:15:01 13 been able to have that information. 16:15:06 14 you are going to hear that the -- and you have 16:15:09 15 heard that the tobacco companies acknowledged that 16:15:12 16 the argument about free choice -- and you have seen 16:15:19 17 this document or heard it referred to a couple of 16:15:23 18 different times -- that their own internal documents 16:15:26 19 have indicated that. . . and this was the tobacco 16:15:31 20 institute memo in september of 1980, where there -- 16:15:41 21 they indicate the lawyers remind us -- i'm told -- 16:15:47 22 that the entire matter of addiction is the most 16:15:50 23 potent weapon a prosecuting attorney can have in a 16:15:53 24 lung cancer cigarette case. we cannot defend 16:15:57 25 continued smoking as, quote, free choice if the 16:16:00 1 person was addicted. 16:16:04 2 lastly, these companies, as evidenced by the 16:16:07 3 document from william dunn in october of 1977, we 16:16:19 4 mentioned this in opening statement, that these 16:16:26 5 companies looked at the addicted smoker, their own 16:16:30 6 customer, as nothing more than a rat in a cage. put 16:16:36 7 a hungry rat in a cage, put a lever in the cage, 16:16:42 8 make it so that it pushes on the lever it delivers a 16:16:45 9 pellet of food, consider the smoker smoking the 16:16:50 10 cigarette as the lever press, the effect of that 16:16:53 11 smoking act upon his person is the reward, that 16:16:56 12 effect reinforces the smoking act. he comes to push 16:16:59 13 the lever 10 to 60 times per day. 16:17:04 14 without the chemical compound nicotine, the 16:17:07 15 cigarette market would collapse; philip morris would 16:17:09 16 collapse; and we would all lose our jobs and our 16:17:13 17 consulting fees. 16:17:16 18 i want to thank you, again, for your -- your -- 16:17:23 19 your attention and your sacrifice in this case. 16:17:27 20 if you -- as you go through the jury 16:17:30 21 instructions and you follow those -- those 16:17:33 22 carefully, um, it will lead you to a just decision 16:17:36 23 in this case, and we look forward to that. 16:17:43 24 thank you. 16:17:46
