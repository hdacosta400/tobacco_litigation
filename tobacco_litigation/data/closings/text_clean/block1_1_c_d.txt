12 ms. baker: thank you, your honor, and 13 may it please the court; counsel. 14 good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 15 jurors: good morning. 16 ms. baker: it is hard to believe that 17 we have been here together for nearly three 18 weeks. i know it seems a little bit longer to 19 me, and it -- perhaps it does for you, as well. 20 while you got to hear me speak to several 21 witnesses, i have not yet had the opportunity 22 to talk to you directly, like mr. kaczynski did 23 both during jury selection and during opening 24 statement. and so i'm grateful. i'm grateful 25 for this opportunity to talk to you directly now about some of the issues that you will be 2 asked to decide on the verdict form. 3 and on behalf of myself and mr. kaczynski 4 and mr. gordon and our team, who you saw 5 helping us out throughout the trial, i want to 6 thank you. i want to thank you for your 7 service. 8 while we were not able to interact with 9 you directly during this trial, we noticed -- 10 we noticed how remarkably close attention you 11 were paying to the evidence, the witnesses. 12 i know it was not always interesting, and 13 i know some mornings and some afternoons were 14 longer than others, but you paid close 15 attention, you took notes, you asked good 16 follow-up questions, and, most importantly, you 17 took time away from your jobs and your family 18 and your loved ones to serve broward county as 19 jurors. and so, for that, we thank you. 20 now, this is my opportunity -- 21 and after i'm done and after you have 22 some lunch, you will hear mr. kaczynski, as well. 23 this is our opportunity to summarize for you 24 the evidence that you have heard over these last 25 two-and-a-half weeks. and i'm going to talk to you about the 2 class membership issues -- you just heard from 3 mr. mcpharlin on that -- i'm going to talk to 4 you about the class membership issues and the 5 medical issues that you may be asked to answer 6 on the verdict form. 7 and i'm going to explain to you why we 8 believe that plaintiff has failed to meet her 9 burden of proving that mrs. kaplan was a class 10 member, or that smoking was the cause of her 11 lung cancer, and why -- this is a very 12 important thing, and i'm going to spend some 13 time on it during my portion of the closing 14 argument -- why ms. block's copd claims are 15 barred by the statute of limitations. 16 i'm going to walk through the issues, i'm 17 going to talk to you about the evidence, i'm 18 going to show you the questions on the verdict 19 form that that evidence pertains to. 20 and after i'm finished, as you heard, 21 you will get a break for lunch, and then 22 mr. kaczynski will speak with you about some of 23 the other issues on the verdict form. 24 now, you may remember that when 25 mr. kaczynski spoke to you during opening statement, he told you that plaintiff would 2 spend a lot of time -- and, as it turned out, 3 it was nearly three full days -- they would 4 spend a lot of time talking about statements 5 and ideas from reynolds and other tobacco 6 companies, most of which were made 30, 40, 50, 7 and sometimes more, 50 or more years ago. 8 but if that was all this case was about, 9 if that is all this case was about, that some 10 cigarette company executive said and did some 11 things that neither you nor i would say or 12 think today, if that was all this was about, we 13 would not be here. we would not have spent the 14 last two-and-a-half weeks together. but we 15 did. 16 and we did that because this case is not 17 about all cigarette smokers. it is not about 18 whether we believe people should smoke. it 19 is not about whether smoking can cause disease 20 or whether it can be addictive. 21 it can cause disease and it can be 22 addictive. and maybe you were surprised to 23 hear mr. kaczynski say that during opening 24 statement. it can cause disease and it can be 25 addictive. but, despite these things, cigarettes are still legal. they are. 2 they are legal to make, they are legal to 3 sell. and contrary to what you might have 4 thought after hearing dr. cummings, they are 5 legal to advertise. 6 that is not just me saying that. that is 7 not just me saying that. judge murphy told you 8 that in the instructions that you heard before 9 mr. mcpharlin stood up. 10 this was the instruction that 11 judge murphy read to you. this is instruction 12 number 20. and you will have these instructions 13 to take back with you to the jury room. 14 the manufacture, advertisement and sale 15 of cigarettes are lawful activities. the 16 defendants cannot be held liable merely for 17 manufacturing, selling or advertising 18 cigarettes. 19 now, by now, you know this case is about 20 lillian kaplan and only mrs. kaplan. it is not 21 about that class action that you heard so much 22 about, it is not about all smokers, and it is not 23 about tobacco companies in general. this is 24 not a referendum, this is not a legislative 25 hearing. this is a court of law. and during the past several weeks, you 2 heard a lot of testimony about things that 3 did not have much to do with mrs. kaplan. you 4 heard about organizations that mrs. kaplan and 5 ms. block had never heard of. you saw 6 documents from companies that are not here in 7 this courtroom. and you heard about things 8 that people wrote and said that never reached 9 mrs. kaplan's ears. 10 why did you hear that? and why did you 11 hear a lot of that again when mr. mcpharlin 12 stood up for his closing argument? 13 you heard that -- make no mistake, you 14 heard that to make you angry, to get you mad, 15 and to distract you from the facts of 16 mrs. kaplan's life. 17 you, ladies and gentlemen, you are the 18 only jury that has heard the story of 19 mrs. kaplan, and you get to decide the issues 20 in this case. 21 now, before i get to the verdict form, i 22 want to spend just a moment, because the -- 23 you heard from judge murphy about the 24 findings, and mr. mcpharlin mentioned those to 25 you during his closing argument. i want to spend just a moment on those 2 findings. those findings from an earlier class 3 action that you heard about, there is no 4 debate, none, that those findings do not tell 5 you anything about how to answer any of the 6 specific questions you will need to answer on the 7 verdict form about mrs. kaplan. 8 with your verdict -- with your verdict -- 9 you will decide whether you believe that 10 those -- whether you believe that those 11 findings even apply to mrs. kaplan and her 12 decisions to smoke and keep smoking. 13 so, with that, let us turn to the first 14 question on the verdict form. this is the 15 class membership question. 16 and as with nearly every issue in this 17 case, except for statute of limitations -- 18 which we will talk about shortly -- plaintiff 19 bears the burden of proof on this issue. 20 and this question really has two parts. 21 it has two parts. part one: was lillian 22 kaplan addicted to cigarettes containing 23 nicotine? 24 so let us talk about that. 25 now, having heard the judge's instructions, you know -- you know that you 2 will not be provided with a definition or a set of 3 medical criteria in those instructions of what 4 it means to be addicted. there is no specific 5 definition in the instructions, there is not a 6 set of criteria in the judge's instructions. 7 and you heard from dr. kaplan -- and 8 mr. mcpharlin mentioned this in his closing 9 argument -- you heard that there is no 10 consensus definition of "addiction." 11 so what have you heard on this issue? 12 plaintiff brought you dr. cummings. plaintiff 13 brought you dr. cummings. and even though the 14 vast majority of his testimony had nothing to 15 do with mrs. kaplan, you learned that he uses a 16 very specific term. he uses the term 17 "assessment," and he uses that for a specific 18 reason. and that is because he is not trained 19 or licensed to diagnose addiction. he cannot 20 diagnose addiction. 21 now, think about that, ladies and 22 gentlemen. the one expert, the one witness 23 that plaintiff brought to you, to tell you that 24 mrs. kaplan was addicted, cannot diagnose 25 addiction. now, you might have thought otherwise 2 when you heard him testify on direct 3 examination, but he is not a medical doctor. 4 he is not a licensed psychologist. he is not 5 board certified in anything. he is not trained 6 or licensed to diagnose addiction, and he 7 cannot do it. he cannot treat addicted 8 smokers. 9 now, yesterday you heard mrs. kaplan's 10 testimony, and we had to bring you all of 11 mrs. kaplan's testimony. you saw the video 12 last week. we brought you the rest of 13 mrs. kaplan's testimony yesterday. 14 and you heard her testimony that no 15 medical doctor has ever diagnosed her or had 16 ever diagnosed her as being addicted. and that 17 is still true to this day. that is still true 18 after dr. cummings' testimony. 19 now, dr. cummings reached his conclusion 20 that mrs. kaplan was addicted using two 21 simplistic tests: the heaviness of smoking 22 index and the fagerstrom test. neither of 23 which -- 24 neither of those tests were designed to 25 diagnose addiction, and certainly not in someone like mrs. kaplan, who, at the time 2 those tests were administered, had quit 18 3 years prior. 4 and you saw that when mr. kaczynski stood 5 up to cross-examine dr. cummings on their use, 6 you saw that neither test has a category that 7 says a smoker is not addicted. so a smoker can 8 literally score zero on those tests and still 9 be found addicted. a zero and still be found 10 addicted. 11 now, addiction diagnoses are a big deal. 12 and that is why, when you heard from dr. kaplan, 13 they are done by a trained medical professional, 14 by trained healthcare providers. 15 you do not diagnose somebody as addicted 16 based upon simple answers to simple questions 17 like you might find in a buzzfeed quiz or a 18 facebook post. you use validated criteria like 19 the dsm. 20 now, dr. cummings talked about the dsm. 21 he attempted to apply the dsm criteria, but we 22 know he is not qualified to do that. we know 23 that because you actually have to be trained to 24 use the criteria, like doctors or nurses or 25 licensed psychologists or social workers. dr. cummings is none of these things. he 2 is not board certified, he is not licensed, and 3 he was not trained in the use of that criteria. 4 so ask yourselves, is how dr. cummings, 5 in his word, is how he assessed mrs. kaplan to 6 be addicted, is that how we actually diagnose 7 people in this country with addictions and 8 serious substance use disorders? of course 9 not. of course it is not. 10 now, we brought you dr. kaplan. 11 dr. kaplan is a board-certified clinical 12 psychiatrist. he diagnoses and treats patients 13 with addictions. that is his practice. 14 he can prescribe medication to help 15 people with their addictions, including an 16 addiction to nicotine, and he conducted a 17 two-hour psychiatric examination of 18 mrs. kaplan. 19 unlike dr. cummings, he can diagnose 20 addiction. he is trained, he is board 21 certified, he is a medical doctor. and he has, 22 unlike what you heard from mr. mcpharlin just a 23 few moments ago, he has diagnosed many smokers 24 as addicted. 25 unlike dr. cummings, he can prescribe medications to help smokers. and you heard 2 that he does that regularly in his practice. 3 and unlike dr. cummings, he has been trained 4 and he has trained other healthcare 5 professionals in how to use the dsm criteria. 6 and, finally, unlike dr. cummings, he 7 reviewed all of the medical records in this 8 case, all of the deposition testimony. and he, 9 as i said, conducted a two-hour psychiatric 10 examination of mrs. kaplan, and filled out a 11 very detailed report. he explained in careful 12 detail how, after all of that, after all of 13 that, he concluded that mrs. kaplan was not 14 addicted. 15 so, at the end of the day, you have to 16 ask yourself, is the plaintiff's evidence from 17 dr. cummings, who cannot diagnose or treat 18 patients -- and he admitted that on the 19 stand -- is that sufficient in a court of law, 20 or should something more be required? 21 based upon the evidence that you heard, 22 your answer to the question of whether 23 mrs. kaplan was addicted should be "no." it 24 should be "no." 25 now, even if you believe that plaintiff has met her burden to prove that mrs. kaplan 2 was addicted, your work is really just 3 beginning, because that still leaves the second 4 part of the question. 5 let us go ahead and take a look at that. 6 if lillian kaplan was addicted, was her 7 addiction to nicotine a legal cause of her 8 copd? was her addiction, not her smoking, was 9 her addiction to nicotine, was that what caused 10 her copd? 11 and mrs. kaplan's own actions demonstrate 12 that addiction cannot be the legal cause of her 13 copd. we know that she did not want to quit 14 smoking before 1994. 15 now, mr. mcpharlin said this -- 16 well, this question, this part of this 17 question is not about choice, but we know that 18 it is, because when mrs. kaplan was motivated, 19 truly motivated in 1994, she quit for good and 20 she never smoked again. 21 now, you saw legal cause, judge murphy 22 instructed you on the legal cause instruction, 23 and mr. mcpharlin talked about that, as well, 24 and let us take a look at that. 25 addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine is a legal cause if it directly and in 2 natural sequence produces or contributes 3 substantially -- substantially -- to producing 4 such copd, such that, but for an addiction, the 5 copd would not have occurred. it must directly 6 and substantially contribute to producing her 7 copd. 8 now, mr. mcpharlin talked to you about it 9 did not have to be the legal cause, it only had 10 to be a legal cause. but whether it has to be 11 the legal cause or a legal cause, it must be 12 the direct and substantial cause. 13 so this part of the class membership 14 question really boils down to the issue of 15 quitting. was mrs. kaplan's addiction so 16 strong, so substantial, that it stood in the 17 way of a motivated, committed effort to quit? 18 if you conclude, as i think you should, 19 that mrs. kaplan was capable of quitting 20 whenever she was motivated to do so, then 21 addiction is not and cannot be the legal cause 22 of her copd. instead, it is her choice to 23 smoke cigarettes for many years, and her choice 24 not to quit for good until it was too late. 25 now, mr. mcpharlin is right, "choice" is not a word that you will see on the verdict form. 2 and it is not in the instructions that the judge 3 just read you or the legal cause instruction 4 that i just showed you. but it is a word that 5 is embedded -- it is a concept that is embedded 6 in our common sense. 7 one of the many strengths of the civil 8 jury system is that we put ordinary citizens in 9 the box, and we tell them, use your common 10 sense, apply your common sense. you do not have 11 to check that common sense at the metal 12 detectors downstairs when you come up here. 13 judge murphy just explained to you that 14 you can and you should use your common sense to 15 evaluate the evidence in this case. 16 this is instruction number 2: your job 17 is to determine what the facts are. you may 18 use reason and common sense to reach those 19 conclusions. 20 so when we talk about mrs. kaplan's 21 choices, use your common sense, apply your 22 reason to this part of the class membership 23 question. and when we talk about her choices, 24 make no mistake, we are not second-guessing her 25 decisions, we are not second-guessing her choices. we are asking you to respect her 2 choices. 3 mrs. kaplan had the right to make 4 whatever choices she wanted to make in her 5 life, to live her life in the way that she saw 6 fit, to forge her own path. but with those 7 rights come responsibility. those decisions, 8 these choices, and these decisions always stood 9 in between mrs. kaplan, in between her claimed 10 addiction and her copd. 11 once she started smoking, she was not on 12 a never-ending path to copd. there were lots 13 of places along the way where she made 14 decisions and she made choices. 15 she made the choice to become a regular 16 smoker; she made the choice to continue smoking 17 despite warnings from the most credible sources 18 of all, her family. she made the choice to 19 continue smoking despite other warnings all 20 around her, including on every pack of 21 cigarettes that she bought and smoked from 1966 22 forward. 23 and, ultimately, she made the choice to 24 stop smoking. those choices, those decisions, 25 stood in between her claimed addiction and her copd. 2 now, the truth is -- and you heard this 3 from virtually ever witness who testified -- 4 the truth is, lillian kaplan was intelligent 5 and independent, stubborn at times, and for 6 many years she did not listen to the warnings 7 all around her, from tv and newspapers, on 8 every single pack of cigarettes from 1966 9 forward. and, again, from the most credible 10 sources in her life, her parents, her sister 11 hilda, her husband and her daughter, ms. block. 12 now, there is no evidence that 13 mrs. kaplan tried to quit when her sister hilda 14 told her to do so. you remember that story. 15 when hilda found out that mrs. kaplan was 16 smoking, she wanted her to stop, she wanted her 17 to quit, she told her she should not be smoking. 18 and when her sister hilda was diagnosed 19 with lung cancer, you did not see any evidence 20 that she tried to quit then, either. and you 21 did not see any evidence that she tried to quit 22 when her husband died from copd. 23 and you heard yesterday, when we brought 24 you mrs. kaplan's testimony, you heard that she 25 could have tried harder to quit before 1994, when, as it turned out, it was too late. 2 now, let me spend just a moment on 3 ms. block's testimony. you heard from 4 mr. mcpharlin about the quit attempts, 5 ms. kaplan's efforts to quit smoking, and i 6 want to spend just a moment on ms. block's 7 testimony about her mother's attempts to quit. 8 now, you heard, when i got up to ask 9 ms. block questions, that -- before trial, 10 before this trial, under oath, ms. block told 11 us that she could not quantify, she could not 12 tell us how many times her mother had tried to 13 quit smoking. 14 and you know that is an important issue, 15 you know that is a critical issue with respect 16 to this part of the class membership question. 17 but on the stand here, in this courtroom, 18 ms. block was sure that it was five or six 19 times. she was sure, despite her earlier 20 testimony where she told us she could not tell 21 us how many times she tried to quit. 22 now, you heard judge murphy's instruction 23 that you have the power to decide whether you 24 find a witness to be believable or whether some 25 of the things they said were influenced in their interest in the outcome of the case. 2 but even if you take ms. block's trial 3 testimony, testimony here as true, that 4 mrs. kaplan tried to quit five or six times 5 total, you should ask yourself, does trying to 6 quit only five or six times over 50 years -- 7 five or six times over 50 years, that is about 8 once a decade -- does that sound like the 9 efforts of someone who was always trying to 10 quit, someone who was a tortured smoker, 11 desperate to quit, someone who would try and do 12 anything to quit? 13 and the answer is, no, it does not sound 14 like someone who was always trying to quit. 15 the fact is, we know that mrs. kaplan 16 took none of the standard no-brainer steps that 17 a smoker could take if they were truly 18 motivated and committed to quit. this is 19 something that dr. cummings and dr. kaplan 20 actually agreed on. 21 mrs. kaplan never used the nicotine 22 patch, she never used the gum, never went to a 23 smoking-cessation clinic. she never tried 24 hypnosis, she never threw out her ashtrays, her 25 lighters, her matches. she never changed that behavior. 2 she never asked family members for help. 3 she never asked doctors for help in quitting 4 smoking. she never asked any of her doctors 5 for a prescription. and that includes 6 dr. doben. and she never asked her doctors for 7 any stop-smoking guides or any pamphlets on 8 smoking and health, any information on smoking 9 and health. 10 now, ms. block also told us something 11 else. and, again, this is something that she 12 quibbled with me a little bit about, but i -- i 13 had to show her her prior sworn testimony. 14 she told us that when she talked to 15 mrs. kaplan, there were times when she talked 16 to mrs. kaplan about her smoking, and 17 ms. kaplan would say -- and this is very 18 telling -- this is very telling -- she would 19 say, leave me alone. leave me alone. 20 she did not say, i do not need to quit, or 21 i do not understand that smoking has health 22 risks, or i do not understand that smoking can 23 cause health problems; she said, leave me 24 alone. let me be, let me live my life the way 25 i want to live it. and ms. block did just that. 2 now, dr. cummings tried to tell you that 3 nicotine somehow prevents smokers from making 4 the choice to quit, that nicotine addiction 5 means a constrained choice, that nicotine 6 somehow changes the brain in a way that smokers 7 simply cannot overcome. 8 but dr. cummings candidly -- he candidly 9 acknowledged that he is rooting for the 10 plaintiff to win in this case, that he helps 11 plaintiffs' lawyers in closed seminars, that he 12 has testified in 77 tobacco trials, and that he 13 has earned over $1 million for testifying in 14 these cases. he told you that half of his 15 annual income since 2011 had come from 16 testifying against tobacco companies. 17 and he told you that he is a general -- a 18 general -- in the war on tobacco, and he has 19 been engaged in that war for many years. he 20 told you he carries that war right into this 21 courtroom. 22 and you saw what he does in that war. he 23 shows you snippets of documents, without 24 telling you the whole story, and he applies 25 criteria like the dsm that he is neither trained or licensed to apply. 2 but when he is not in the courtroom, what 3 does he do? when he is not in the courtroom, he 4 tells smokers that the success rate for 5 quitting is one hundred percent. one hundred percent 6 for people who really want to quit and stick 7 with it. 8 and he publishes things like the brochure 9 "smart move." mr. kaczynski showed 10 dr. cummings this brochure. this was 11 dr. cummings' brochure. 12 this is what dr. cummings tells people 13 about cigarette smoking when he is not in the 14 courtroom. he says: do you have what it takes 15 to stop smoking? do you have what it takes to 16 stop smoking? there is no magic cure that can 17 help you stop. take this short quiz to find 18 out if you have what it takes. 19 number 1: do you want to stop smoking? 20 that is the threshold issue: do you want to 21 stop smoking? 22 now, you remember mr. kaczynski asking 23 dr. cummings about this during 24 cross-examination. he asked him -- 25 he said: if mrs. kaplan said she did not really want to quit until 1994, she would not 2 have been able to check this box at any point 3 prior to that time. and dr. cummings agreed, 4 as he must. 5 and you heard dr. kaplan tell you that 6 when he examined mrs. kaplan, when dr. kaplan 7 examined mrs. kaplan, she told him in that 8 setting that she did not really want to quit 9 until 1994. 10 those were not mr. kaczynski's words and 11 those are not my words, either. those were 12 mrs. kaplan's words. those were her words. 13 she did not want to quit, she was not motivated 14 to quit until 1994. 15 number 2: are you willing to make some 16 changes in your daily routine, like throwing 17 out your ashtrays, throwing out your matches, 18 throwing out your lighters, asking your friends 19 and family for help? 20 we know mrs. kaplan did not do that. 21 and are you willing to put up with some 22 uneasy moments after stopping? 23 if you can answer "yes" to all three 24 questions, you can stop smoking. that is what 25 dr. cummings tells people when he is not in the courtroom. and we know that mrs. kaplan 2 could not answer "yes" to all three of these 3 questions until 1994. 4 now, you also heard from dr. cummings 5 that 60 million americans have quit smoking in 6 this country. he told us that many of those 7 people were addicted, even heavily addicted. 8 all had the temporary brain changes that 9 he discussed during direct examination, but the 10 nicotine in those cigarettes, the nicotine in 11 cigarettes did not prevent these 60 million 12 former smokers from understanding that smoking 13 had health risks and from choosing to quit. 14 and it ultimately did not prevent mrs. kaplan 15 from quitting, either. 16 the evidence shows that mrs. kaplan was 17 always in control of her smoking decisions. 18 she made those choices, not the nicotine in 19 cigarettes, and not r.j. reynolds. lillian 20 kaplan's choices, her decisions, they are the 21 legal cause of her copd. 22 your answer to question 1 on the verdict 23 form should be "no." was lillian kaplan 24 addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine; 25 and, if so, was such addiction a legal cause? the answer is "no." 2 if you answer this question "no," your 3 verdict is for reynolds and you have fulfilled 4 your jury service. 5 now, if you do not -- 6 if you do not answer "no" -- we believe 7 you do, but if you do not answer "no," you will go 8 on to question 2. 9 did mrs. kaplan know or by the use of 10 reasonable care -- the use of reasonable 11 care -- should she have known before may 5th, 12 1990, that she had copd, and that there was a 13 reasonable possibility that the copd was caused 14 by smoking cigarettes? 15 now, again, we do not think you should get 16 to this question, but i told you earlier that 17 this is an important question, that i was going 18 to spend some time on it. 19 so let me talk about some of the evidence 20 you heard. you heard a lot of evidence on this 21 issue at trial. and you might remember that 22 mr. kaczynski talked to you about this issue 23 during jury selection. he specifically talked 24 to you about statute of limitations. 25 this is the law in the state of florida. it is not a technicality. this is the law. and 2 it is one that is fundamentally rooted in 3 fairness. 4 the reason why it is so important to have 5 this defense in the law, why this is the law, 6 and as we see particularly in this case, is 7 that, as time goes by, memories can and do 8 fade. medical records are not maintained 9 forever. healthcare providers and hospitals 10 only maintain records for a limited period of 11 time. 12 and what the statute of limitations -- 13 what that law ensures is that you do not get to 14 put your head in the sand. you do not get to 15 put your head in the sand and come to court and 16 ask for money and say, mrs. kaplan had a 17 hacking cough -- and we will talk about 18 ms. block's testimony on that in a moment -- 19 but you do not get to say ms. kaplan had a 20 hacking cough, it got progressively worse over 21 time, it was so bad at times that she had 22 trouble catching her breath, and she knew it 23 was caused by her smoking, and she had all of 24 this before may 5th, 1990, while she was still 25 living in new york. and may 5th, 1990, that is the cutoff, 2 that is the statute of limitations in this 3 case. you do not get to say all of that is 4 true, but there is no record, or she was not 5 diagnosed until 1994, so, therefore, you cannot 6 prove that she reasonably should have known she 7 had copd and it was caused by smoking before 8 may 5th, 1990. 9 now, due to the passage of time, we know 10 in this case that we do not have all the medical 11 records. we know that. we have no records 12 from when mrs. kaplan lived in new york; and 13 the earliest reference we have in a medical 14 record -- and you heard some about this at 15 trial -- that is from dr. doben -- and this is 16 from 1991. you see that right there. 17 we do not know what mrs. kaplan told 18 dr. doben about her smoking history. we do not 19 have any records that show that. and we do not 20 know what she told him about her medical 21 history before moving to florida. but that 22 is not the end of the story. that is not the end 23 of the story. 24 when we look at what we do have before 25 1994, when she was ultimately diagnosed, it, essentially, boils down to a one-page medical 2 record. that is that medical record from 3 dr. doben. a one-page medical record. it is a 4 medication list. it shows what dr. doben was 5 prescribing for mrs. kaplan. and you will have 6 that back in the jury room with you. 7 now, based on some of the testimony that 8 you heard here in this courtroom, you might 9 have thought that there was a stack of records 10 from dr. doben prior to 1994. there is not. 11 there is, essentially, a one-page medication 12 list that has some entries that show what 13 dr. doben was prescribing for mrs. kaplan 14 before 1994. 15 this very little information that we 16 have, however, from dr. doben, is telling. the 17 entries pre-dating mrs. kaplan's visit to 18 dr. weiner in 1994 demonstrate that she was 19 being prescribed antibiotics for respiratory 20 infections, inhalers to help her breathe, and 21 cough suppressants. 22 now, when thinking about what was going 23 on during this time period, again, you need to 24 use your common sense, ladies and gentlemen. 25 there is probably no issue in this case that requires you to apply your common sense more 2 than this one. 3 we may not know what dr. doben knew when 4 he was treating mrs. kaplan in the early 1990s. 5 and you heard that when he testified by 6 deposition, he could not precisely remember what 7 was going on during that time period. he 8 could not even really remember when mrs. kaplan 9 was diagnosed with copd. 10 we may not know -- we may not know what 11 dr. doben knew, but we certainly know what 12 mrs. kaplan knew or should have known at that 13 time. 14 just one month after the earliest entry 15 on that one-page medication list, just one 16 month, september 1991, julius kaplan dies of 17 copd, after a year's long battle with 18 respiratory problems. 19 now, because we do not have all of the 20 records, because over time some of those 21 records have been lost, we need to piece the 22 information we do have together. 23 now, the testimony and evidence put on by 24 plaintiff at trial, and most of what you heard 25 from mr. mcpharlin, focused on the fact that mrs. kaplan was not diagnosed until 1994, when 2 she went to see dr. weiner. but, again, that 3 is not the end of your inquiry. the date of 4 diagnosis is not the end of the story here. 5 and you just heard this instruction from 6 the judge, and we will take a look at it. for 7 purposes of this defense, the critical event -- 8 the critical event -- is not when her copd was 9 actually diagnosed by a physician, but when her 10 copd first manifested itself. and the 11 instruction goes on. 12 let us take a look at the next slide, 13 katie. 14 in making that determination, you may 15 properly consider what mrs. kaplan knew prior 16 to may 5th, 1990, concerning the health risks 17 of cigarettes. 18 now, mr. mcpharlin already mentioned 19 this, and it is true, we bear the burden on 20 this issue. this is the one issue for which we 21 bear the burden of proof. so let us walk 22 through the literal mountain of evidence -- 23 mountain of evidence -- you heard in this 24 courtroom that mrs. kaplan should have known 25 that she had copd before may 5th, 1990. and in order to do that, i want you to 2 recall dr. weiner's testimony. he came by 3 deposition, too. dr. weiner was mrs. kaplan's 4 treating pulmonologist. 5 and when he was asked -- or he described 6 putting all of these pieces that i've talked to 7 you about, putting these pieces together, 8 mrs. kaplan's cough and her smoking history, he 9 said it is like putting -- i would have put one 10 plus one equals two. one, her coughing, her 11 history of a chronic progressive cough, and 12 one, her smoking history, and that should have 13 reasonably led to a diagnosis of copd. 14 but here, in this case and in this 15 courtroom, there is more than just one plus one. 16 let us take a look at that. 17 1964, the surgeon general's report, this 18 is above-the-fold, front-page coverage, in the 19 sunday times. mrs. kaplan read that times. 20 and around this time, ms. block is in high 21 school, and she told you that she talked to her 22 parents about the health risks of smoking. she 23 was talking to her parents about the health 24 risks at this time. 25 1966: surgeon general's warning. you heard from mrs. kaplan, herself, yesterday, 2 when we brought you that testimony. she told 3 you that she remembered that warning and she 4 remembers seeing it on packs. there is no 5 evidence at this time that mrs. kaplan tries to 6 quit smoking. 7 1970, another surgeon general's warning 8 goes on every pack of cigarettes that 9 mrs. kaplan smokes or buys. and ms. block told 10 you that she talked to her parents about this, 11 quote, serious warning. there is no evidence 12 that mrs. kaplan tries to quit at this time. 13 early 1970s, mr. kaplan has a deep, 14 hacking cough. hacking, deep from the gut. 15 and sometimes -- 16 and you heard this from arthur kaplan 17 yesterday -- and, again, that was testimony 18 that we brought to you -- you heard that 19 sometimes mr. kaplan would expectorate. now, 20 what that means is that sometimes his cough was 21 productive. 22 you heard that the cough was chronic. 23 and, again, you heard from arthur that 24 mrs. kaplan's cough was just like mr. kaplan's. 25 it was just like mr. kaplan's cough. now, in describing the cough, you might 2 remember that ms. block disagreed with me on 3 this point, when i asked her about it when she 4 was testifying, and i had to show her her prior 5 sworn testimony. and i want to take a look at 6 that. 7 (thereupon, the video clip was played and 8 taken down to the best of the reporter's 9 ability as follows:) 10 q. was your mother's cough a hacking cough? 11 a. no. 12 q. all right. let us go ahead and take a 13 look at your deposition. 14 mr. mcpharlin: judge, can we -- 15 q. question: okay -- 16 (video clip paused.) 17 the court: i'm sorry? 18 mr. mcpharlin: can we approach, please? 19 the court: sure. [#deleted sidebar#] 4 ms. baker: all right. katie, if we can 5 start that again. 6 7 8 follows:) 9 q. was your mother's cough a hacking cough? 10 a. no. 11 q. all right. let us go ahead and take a 12 look at your deposition. 13 question: okay. i know you told us it 14 was when you were a teenager. was your mother's cough 15 a hacking cough? 16 answer: yes. 17 that was the answer you provided on this 18 date, correct? 19 a. yes. 20 q. all right. and is your testimony now, in 21 this courtroom, that your mother's cough was not a 22 hacking cough? 23 a. yes. 24 (video clip concluded.) 25 ms. baker: all right. you remember that testimony, ladies and gentlemen. 2 and you have to ask yourself, ms. block 3 is the one who is now bringing this lawsuit. 4 she is now the plaintiff in this case. she is 5 the one who is asking for millions of dollars. 6 when was she telling the truth? 7 was she telling the truth in a deposition 8 when she was not the plaintiff in this lawsuit, 9 not the one seeking money damages, or was she 10 telling the truth in this courtroom, in 2015? 11 you have to ask yourself why she would so 12 clearly change her testimony on a critical 13 issue now at this trial. 14 let us go back to our timeline. 15 all right. this is in the 1970s. 16 mrs. kaplan's husband, julius, starts 17 experiencing lung problems. 18 and among his other health problems -- 19 and you heard this from mrs. kaplan 20 yesterday -- among his other health problems, 21 he was hospitalized due to these lung problems 22 many times, starting in the 1970s. 23 and you also heard mrs. kaplan yesterday. 24 she said that she and her husband linked these 25 lung problems to his smoking. and he ultimately quit because of those health 2 problems. 3 now, ms. block, when she testified, also 4 told us that mrs. kaplan knew -- she knew that 5 smoking was bad for her health. 6 now, mr. mcpharlin would have you 7 believe, based on his closing argument, that 8 all of these serious warnings, all of these 9 health messages, including those from her 10 family, they were all being drowned out by ads, 11 but ms. block told us otherwise. she told us 12 that mrs. kaplan knew smoking was bad for her. 13 now, let us go back to the timeline. 14 early 1970s, peter block, mrs. kaplan's 15 son-in-law at the time, someone she was close 16 to at the time, he quits smoking and he quit 17 smoking because ms. block gets on his case and 18 she tells him he needs to quit. 19 and you also heard that ms. block would 20 say to her mother -- when she heard her 21 coughing, she would say, what is with your 22 cough? 23 and when she would say things like this, 24 as we have already heard, mrs. kaplan would say, 25 leave me alone. now, you cannot have it both ways, ladies 2 and gentlemen. you cannot say that more 3 information about the risks would have 4 influenced your decisions, but then ignore the 5 additional information that you are getting 6 about the risks, and tell people to leave you 7 alone when it is given to you. 8 now, mr. kaplan quits. we know he quits 9 in the 1980s, we know he quits because he is 10 having health problems. and at this time -- 11 and you heard this from ms. block -- at this 12 time, he is literally preaching to mrs. kaplan 13 to quit. 14 late 1980s, he is preaching to mrs. kaplan 15 to quit. around the same time period -- you 16 heard this during arthur kaplan's testimony 17 yesterday -- he would hear his mother coughing 18 and he would hear his mother say, i've got to 19 try to stop smoking. 20 1985, the surgeon general puts on 21 rotating warnings. this is on -- these go on 22 every pack of cigarettes. one of those 23 warnings says: smoking causes emphysema. 24 smoking causes emphysema. 25 in the '80s, hilda is diagnosed with lung cancer. she is a smoker, she is diagnosed with 2 lung cancer, and then hilda's death due to lung 3 cancer, mrs. kaplan connects her death to her 4 smoking. 5 and ultimately, as we know, in 1991, 6 mr. kaplan dies, and on his death certificate, 7 it says: copd. 8 now, this alone -- this alone, 9 mr. kaplan's death in 1991, demonstrates that 10 mrs. kaplan knew about copd long before she 11 goes to see dr. weiner in 1994. 12 so when you look at the totality of the 13 evidence, when you put all of these pieces 14 together, you do not just have one plus one, 15 like dr. weiner told you, and as he suggested 16 would be enough; you have one plus one plus one 17 plus one, and so on. 18 when you look at the mountain of evidence 19 that mrs. kaplan had the classic hallmark 20 symptoms of copd prior to may 5th, 1990, that 21 she believed were caused by smoking, a cough 22 like her husband, a cough like her husband who 23 had lung problems, put him in the hospital, and 24 whose death certificate said copd, a cough that 25 was hacking, progressive and chronic, when you put all of these pieces together, her symptoms, 2 what she knew and when she knew it in new york, 3 long before she ever moved to florida, and when 4 you add to this the most personal and serious 5 of all warnings, symptoms like those 6 experienced by your spouse who was also a 7 smoker, who was sick for years, who was sick 8 for years with and hospitalized for respiratory 9 problems, and someone who eventually died of 10 copd, when you put all of these pieces together 11 and apply your common sense, it is clear that 12 mrs. kaplan should have known, through the use 13 of reasonable care, prior to may 5th, 1990, 14 that she had copd and there was a reasonable 15 possibility it was caused by smoking. 16 on this second question on the verdict 17 form, you should check "yes." you should check 18 "yes." and if you do, again, your verdict is 19 for reynolds and you have fulfilled your jury 20 service. 21 now, i told you at the beginning that my 22 job was to talk to you about the class 23 membership issues and statute of limitations. 24 the court: ten minutes, counsel. 25 ms. baker: thank you, your honor. but i'm also going to talk to you just 2 very briefly about two other medical issues. 3 now, if you move on, if you do not 4 answer -- if you do not answer "yes" to statute 5 of limitations, you move on down the verdict 6 form, so let me spend just a moment on 7 mrs. kaplan's lung cancer. 8 and you have to go all the way down the 9 verdict form to question 6. 10 was smoking cigarettes manufactured by 11 reynolds a legal cause of mrs. kaplan's lung 12 cancer? 13 this is really a two-part question again. 14 the first question: did lung cancer cause -- 15 let me read that again. 16 was smoking cigarettes manufactured by 17 reynolds a legal cause of lillian kaplan's lung 18 cancer? 19 again, this is a two-part question. did 20 lung cancer cause her death? there is no 21 dispute about that. no question that 22 mrs. kaplan died of lung cancer. we have not 23 disputed that throughout this trial. 24 the second part asks if smoking caused 25 mrs. kaplan's lung cancer. and the answer to that must be "no," because the plaintiff did 2 not meet her burden. 3 now, let me talk about what dr. villa and 4 dr. keller -- what the experts on these issues 5 had to say. you heard over and over that 6 mrs. kaplan had not smoked a single cigarette 7 in 18 years at the time she was diagnosed with 8 lung cancer in 2012. she also had 9 adenocarcinoma, and you heard dr. villa say 10 that is the most common type of cancer among 11 female nonsmokers. 12 both dr. villa and dr. keller agreed that 13 the risk of lung cancer, the risk of disease 14 caused by smoking, declines when someone quits 15 smoking. and dr. villa said the risk has 16 plummeted 70 to eighty percent, 18 years after a 17 smoker like mrs. kaplan quits. 18 both dr. villa and dr. keller agreed that 19 age can be a risk factor for all kinds of 20 cancer, including lung cancer. and that means, 21 the longer you live, the more likely you are to 22 get lung cancer. 23 and, as we know, and as we have discussed 24 many times, mrs. kaplan was 83 when she was 25 diagnosed. and both doctors -- both agreed that age was a risk factor for her. 2 and you also heard something very 3 important from dr. villa. you heard from 4 dr. villa that genetics play a critical role in 5 determining one's risk for lung cancer. 6 and here is what we know about 7 mrs. kaplan's family history of cancer: in 8 just her immediate family, alone, her father 9 died of multiple myeloma. that is a blood 10 cancer. her sister, pearl, died of bladder 11 cancer. and hilda, as we know, died of lung 12 cancer. at the time of her diagnosis, 13 mrs. kaplan had outlived all of her siblings by 14 decades. 15 plaintiffs simply cannot show that at age 16 83, 18 years after she quit smoking, that 17 smoking was a substantial contributing factor 18 to mrs. kaplan's lung cancer. plaintiff cannot 19 meet her burden on this issue. 20 so if you get this far on the verdict 21 form, you should check "no." you should check 22 "no" to this question. 23 now, let me spend just a moment on 24 stroke. you did not hear mr. mcpharlin talk 25 about mrs. kaplan's stroke at all, so let me -- let me very briefly address this issue so that 2 i can say that i've covered all the medical 3 issues that you heard about at this trial. 4 and this will be the last issue that i 5 address before i turn the reins -- before your 6 lunch break, and certainly before i turn the 7 reins over to mr. kaczynski to cover the 8 remaining issues. 9 now, you heard a good bit about 10 mrs. kaplan's stroke in february of 2012. and, 11 again, she was 83 years old when she had that 12 stroke. 13 you also heard that, prior to her stroke, 14 her copd was stable. she was living 15 independently, she was taking care of her own 16 home, she was driving, she was running her own 17 errands, and she was taking out-of-state trips 18 to arizona to visit family and with a friend to 19 las vegas. 20 shortly after her stroke, she was 21 diagnosed with lung cancer. we know that. and 22 she died in september of that same year. 23 now, if you find that mrs. kaplan's lung 24 cancer was caused by smoking, you will not 25 consider her stroke, if you determine that plaintiff is entitled to damages -- 2 mr. mcpharlin: judge, that is improper. 3 that is not the law. 4 the court: sustained. rephrase, 5 counsel. 6 ms. baker: to the extent you get this 7 far on the verdict form, let me explain to 8 you -- let me talk some to you about why her 9 stroke -- why plaintiff did not show that 10 mrs. kaplan's stroke was caused by smoking or 11 her lung cancer. 12 now, we brought you dr. bishopric. you 13 heard from dr. bishopric last friday by video. 14 she is a specialist in cardiovascular diseases. 15 she is a cardiologist. she has treated 16 thousands of stroke patients at the university 17 of miami; and before she came to the university 18 of miami, out in california. she is a 19 distinguished researcher, teacher and clinician 20 at the university of miami. 21 and, at the outset, both dr. bishopric 22 and dr. villa agree that, once you quit 23 smoking, once a smoker quits, within only a few 24 years after they quit, their risk for getting a 25 stroke due to smoking has returned to that of a never-smoker. that means your risk is no 2 greater than someone who never smoked a day in 3 their life. 4 according to dr. villa, by 1996 or 1997, 5 mrs. kaplan's risk for stroke due to smoking 6 had returned to that of a never-smoker. that is 7 what dr. villa told you. 8 now, dr. bishopric also told us that, 9 after mrs. kaplan quits smoking, she developed 10 other significant health conditions, including 11 hypertension, high blood pressure, 12 hyperlipidemia -- that is high cholesterol and 13 high triglycerides -- and diabetes. these 14 conditions were not related to her smoking, but 15 they were significant and they were significant 16 independent risk factors for mrs. kaplan's 17 stroke. dr. villa agreed with that. 18 in fact, dr. bishopric showed you the 19 medical records which said that at the time of 20 mrs. kaplan's stroke in february of 2012, 21 mrs. kaplan's hypertension and her diabetes 22 were uncontrolled. they were uncontrolled at 23 that time. dr. villa agreed with that, too. 24 but dr. villa said that mrs. kaplan's 25 lung cancer might have also contributed to her stroke. it might have made her blood more 2 likely to clot. but dr. bishopric explained 3 that the kinds of clots that are caused by 4 malignancies or cancer like mrs. kaplan had, 5 they happen on the venous side of the 6 circulatory system, not the arterial side. 7 you remember her description of those two 8 sides of the circulatory system? mrs. kaplan's 9 stroke happened on the arterial side, not the 10 venous side, where strokes or clots due to lung 11 cancer or malignancies can occur. 12 and just as importantly, there was a 13 question from one of you. after dr. villa 14 testified, there was a question from one of 15 you, asking dr. villa if he could quantify the 16 contribution of mrs. kaplan's lung cancer to 17 her stroke. and he told you he could not do 18 that. he could not do that. 19 you did not hear it during direct 20 examination, but when you put that question to 21 him, he told you he could not say that the lung 22 cancer was a substantial contributing cause of 23 her stroke. 24 so if you get to this point -- and 25 mr. kaczynski is going to talk to you more about these issues when he stands up to 2 speak -- but if you get to this point and you 3 decide that ms. block is entitled to money, you 4 should not base that award on ms. kaplan's 5 stroke. 6 now, i have reached the end of my time 7 and it is just a few moments before your -- 8 before your lunch break, and i appreciate your 9 patience throughout my time up here and 10 throughout this trial. 11 i have explained these issues in the best 12 way that i know how. that mrs. kaplan was not 13 a class member, that ms. block's claim is 14 barred by the statute of limitations, and that 15 plaintiff has not met her burden to show that 16 mrs. kaplan's lung cancer or stroke was caused 17 by smoking. 18 i ask that you apply your common sense to 19 the evidence that you heard in this courtroom, 20 i ask that you focus on that evidence and the 21 law as judge murphy has instructed you, and 22 return a verdict in favor of reynolds. 23 it is been an honor and a privilege to 24 present this case to you, and i thank you for 25 your time. thank you, your honor. 19 mr. kaczynski: thank you, your honor. 20 ms. block, counsel. 21 good afternoon. 22 jurors: good afternoon. 23 mr. kaczynski: seems like an eternity 24 since we spoke in jury selection, but slowly 25 and surely, we are getting there. i think in jury selection i told you 2 folks that i did not think people ever got tired 3 of being thanked. so this is the third time 4 today you are being thanked, maybe the fourth. 5 and we do thank you for your service. 6 everything that everyone said before goes 7 for me, too. we know you had a lot of 8 sacrifices, took a hunk out of your lives. 9 we all make great sacrifices to make this 10 great country of ours work. and you answered 11 the call of broward county, and i thank you for 12 it. 13 as i said many times, the system could not 14 work without you. it is true by showing up for 15 jury duty every day, you have helped our judicial 16 system work, and we appreciate it. 17 i'm going to talk to you about that part 18 of the verdict form that we do not think you 19 should reach. 20 but if you get to the point where you 21 find that mrs. kaplan was an engle class 22 member, then the first thing i'm going to talk 23 to you about is the concept called "comparative 24 responsibility." 25 that is the part of the verdict form where you have to decide by percentages who was 2 responsible for mrs. kaplan's choices, 3 mrs. kaplan or somebody else. 4 and as i think you heard from ms. baker 5 already, we are not asking you to blame 6 mrs. kaplan for her choices. we are asking 7 you -- we are not asking you to put her at 8 fault. we are, rather, asking you to respect 9 her choices. 10 and we have been up front with you from the 11 beginning in jury selection, i do not know if 12 you recall. but our position is, has been and 13 is today, that it is mrs. kaplan and only 14 mrs. kaplan who was responsible for her choices 15 regarding her smoking decisions. 16 it was only mrs. kaplan that could have 17 chosen to begun to smoke. it was only 18 mrs. kaplan that has chosen to continue to 19 smoke, and it was only mrs. kaplan who could 20 make the choice whether to quit or not. 21 and if she made that choice, to seriously 22 follow through on it. 23 now, when she was on the stand, ms. block 24 made her position perfectly clear too. she 25 told you she did not think her mother bore any responsibilities for her choices, none, zero. 2 it is all somebody else's fault. somebody 3 else's fault she started. somebody else's 4 fault she continued, somebody else's fault she 5 could not quit until 1994. 6 we got personal choice, we got personal 7 responsibility. it is all somebody else's 8 fault. 9 now, this morning you heard them budge a 10 little bit on that position. well, maybe 11 5 percent. maybe it is 5 percent mrs. kaplan's 12 responsibility. 13 well, we are going to walk through in a 14 bit all the information that was available to 15 mrs. kaplan when she made her choices: the 16 newspapers, the magazines, the tv, the warning 17 labels, the public service announcements. 18 and it was in the face of all this that 19 mrs. kaplan decided to smoke and to continue to 20 smoke until 1994. 21 and she told dr. kaplan she really did not 22 want to quit before 1994. is that somebody 23 else's fault? 24 she told dr. kaplan she really thinks she 25 could have tried harder to quit before 1994. was that somebody else's fault? 2 she chose not to quit in an era when 3 60 million americans chose to quit. was that 4 somebody else's fault? 5 and many of those 60 million who chose to 6 quit during this period were addicted. was 7 prior to 1994 mrs. kaplan somehow different 8 than those 60 million people? 9 and we know from the testimony we heard 10 that things would have been difficult for her 11 had they made a different decision, a decision 12 to quit. 13 dr. villa told us that if mrs. kaplan 14 quit smoking as late as 1982, her risk of lung 15 cancer would have gone down 90 to 95 percent. 16 again, whose fault is it that mrs. kaplan 17 decided otherwise? 18 ladies and gentlemen, mrs. kaplan and 19 nobody else made those choices. not 5 percent, 20 not ten percent, not fifty percent. but it was 21 one hundred percent her choice. 22 and mrs. kaplan and nobody else -- nobody 23 else -- is responsible for those choices. it 24 is not somebody else's fault. 25 so very simply, we are asking you to respect her choices when you get the verdict 2 form. and when you get this line on the 3 verdict form, we are asking you to fill in 4 one hundred percent on the line for mrs. kaplan. 5 now, the next subject you are going to 6 have to address is the subject of reasonable 7 reliance. the part that deals with whether 8 mrs. kaplan reasonably relied on anything 9 reynolds said or did. 10 and these are the very specific questions 11 that you are going to be asked to answer. and 12 they are small print, so out come the glasses: 13 did lillian kaplan reasonably rely to her 14 detriment on any statement of material fact 15 made by the defendant that concealed or 16 omitted -- here are the keywords -- material 17 information not otherwise known or available to 18 her concerning the health effects and/or 19 addictive nature of smoking cigarettes; and if 20 so, was such reliance a legal cause of any of 21 lillian kaplan's injuries and/or death? 22 question number 5: did lillian kaplan 23 reasonably rely to her detriment on any 24 statements and/or acts made in furtherance of 25 defendant's agreement to conceal or omit material information not otherwise known or 2 available to her concerning the health effects 3 and/or addictive nature of smoking cigarettes; 4 and if so, was such reliance a legal cause of 5 lillian kaplan's injuries and/or death? 6 i'm going to admit to you that in that 7 video deposition you saw, the one that was 8 taken after her stroke, the one that was taken 9 a month before mrs. kaplan passed away, the one 10 in which she was answering suggestive questions 11 from her lawyer -- 12 mr. mcpharlin: objection, judge, 13 improper. 14 the court: ladies and gentlemen, you are 15 to rely on your own recollection of the 16 evidence. this is argument. 17 proceed, counsel. 18 mr. kaczynski: thank you, your honor. 19 mrs. kaplan, in that deposition, said she 20 did rely on some unspecified statement from 21 somebody that said smoking was safe. 22 we do not know who, we do not know when, we 23 do not know what was said. 24 but if you look back at the three volumes 25 of deposition testimony that they did not show you, they did not show you to this day. we had 2 to do that. 3 we showed you those three volumes of 4 depositions, testimony taken four years before 5 her stroke, testimony taken when her memory was 6 unimpaired. 7 and what do we find there? well, for 8 starters, we find out that they wasted your 9 time showing you all those statements from the 10 tobacco institute and ctr, all those videos, a 11 complete waste of your time. why? 12 because in her three-volume deposition 13 that you were not shown by plaintiff four years 14 before the stroke, mrs. kaplan told us she 15 never heard of ctr, she never heard of the 16 tobacco institute, she never heard any 17 statements made by ctr, and she never heard any 18 statements made by the tobacco institute. 19 and you know, truth be told, nobody has, 20 really. 21 i think it is fair to say that the things 22 that ti or ctr said or did got a whole lot more 23 air time in courtrooms like this than they ever 24 did in real life. 25 in dr. cummings' world, these organizations were goliaths. 2 in the real world, the real world of 3 people like mrs. kaplan, these organizations 4 were invisible, and she never heard of them. 5 and, quite frankly, very few people probably 6 did. 7 so let us say, did she rely on anything 8 reynolds said or did to start smoke something. 9 now, once again, plaintiff never told you 10 why she started to smoke up to and including 11 today. we had to do that. 12 i did it when cross-examining 13 dr. cummings. and you heard it in the 14 deposition testimony of those three volumes of 15 mrs. kaplan's testimony that plaintiffs did not 16 show you. 17 she was baby-sitting, she was offered a 18 cigarette, and she took it. she did not feel 19 pressured to take it. she did not feel curious 20 about smoking when she took it, and she did not 21 become a regular smoker until -- well, when she 22 became a regular smoker she did not yet start 23 to see cigarette advertisements, not yet. 24 let us compare and contrast a few things 25 about the deposition she took, she gave us before her stroke and after her stroke. 2 compare and contrast. let us take a look. 3 before her stroke, when her memory was 4 good, she said: was there anything about the 5 ads for kent with filters you can recall? 6 no. 7 it is fair to say that you cannot recall 8 seeing a particular kent advertisement, right? 9 after her stroke when her memory is 10 impaired: i'm going to show you some ads for 11 kent, right? 12 are these advertisements that you saw 13 when you were smoking? 14 yeah, when i was smoking. 15 in her deposition before her stroke, she 16 told us: carltons, do you recall any specific 17 advertisements for carltons? 18 no. 19 after her stroke, she starts describing a 20 carlton ad. 21 in a deposition before her stroke, she 22 said -- she did not believe every word she read 23 in ads. she did not believe one is better than 24 the other. 25 after her stroke, she says: did you ever hear the tobacco company say smoking was safe? 2 always. 3 did you believe them when they said that? 4 yes. 5 in her deposition before the stroke, most 6 importantly she said: did you ever see an 7 advertisement for cigarettes that said any 8 brand of cigarettes was safe to smoke? 9 answer: i did not see anything that said 10 safe or unsafe. 11 in her deposition after her stroke, 12 mrs. kaplan told us that her memory was 13 impaired. 14 yet miraculously, sometime in the time of 15 the deposition, after her stroke, she managed 16 to remember ads that she could not remember 17 four years earlier before her stroke. 18 i mean, it is pretty clear what went on 19 here. maybe -- 20 mr. mcpharlin: judge, that is improper, 21 move to strike. 22 the court: jurors, disregard the last 23 comment. 24 mr. kaczynski: somehow she managed to 25 improve her memory after the stroke as regards to issues in this lawsuit. 2 now, whether or not mrs. kaplan relied on 3 anything reynolds said or did is a question of 4 fact for you. 5 we have been telling you from the start, 6 you are the judges of the facts. 7 you know there are true facts and there 8 are litigation-generated facts. and what you 9 heard in that video, that video deposition -- 10 first of all, was sad. i think we would all agree 11 to that. 12 but what you heard from this 84-year-old 13 ailing woman who could not remember her son's 14 name, but somehow could remember ads from 60 15 years ago under suggestive questioning from her 16 lawyer? these are litigation-generated facts. 17 because if you go back to her 2008 18 deposition before her stroke, before her memory 19 was impaired, she gave lengthy and detailed 20 depositions that the plaintiff chose not to 21 show you. 22 you have the true facts from those 23 depositions. the true facts, not the 24 litigation facts. 25 or that she never heard of ti or ctr. she never relied on anything reynolds said or 2 did in advertising or otherwise. 3 and even if you were to give credence to 4 that stroke-impaired deposition and somehow 5 believe her, took her at her word that there 6 was reliance, the reliance still has to be 7 reasonable. it is got to be reasonable. 8 and the concealed material has got to be, 9 as that instruction said, material information 10 not otherwise known or available to her. 11 and this is where plaintiff has a 12 problem. on the one hand, they want you to 13 believe that mrs. kaplan was unaware of the 14 risks of smoking. 15 on the other hand, they want you to 16 believe that she was looking for reassurance in 17 advertising and that she was constantly trying 18 to quit. 19 well, you cannot have it both ways. why 20 would somebody be seeking reassurance if she 21 did not think there was some danger to be 22 reassured about? 23 why would somebody be constantly trying 24 to quit, unless they knew that smoking was 25 harmful to them in some way? you heard this morning the definition of 2 "addiction" being persistent use, despite 3 knowledge that it is harmful. 4 and you heard this morning that that fits 5 lillian kaplan to a t. well, you cannot have it 6 both ways. either she acknowledges it is 7 harmful, she knows it is harmful, or she 8 does not. 9 ladies and gentlemen, the facts of this 10 case show that lillian kaplan was surrounded by 11 information about the dangers of smoking all 12 her life. 13 she subscribed to reader's digest. you 14 saw some of those articles, including this one, 15 beware that cigarette cough. 16 and it tells you if you have a cigarette 17 cough, a hacking cough -- where did you hear 18 that word before? a hacking cough -- get to a 19 doctor for a complete respiratory examination, 20 including chest x-rays and lung function 21 diagnosis. now, before it is too late. 22 because smoker's cough may herald 23 advancing emphysema, copd, and the end can be 24 strangulation, drowning in trapped mucous. 25 this was material known and available to her. these articles are in evidence. you can 2 read them. 3 she subscribed to life magazine. and 4 you have seen this article, this graphic story 5 and others. this was material known or 6 available to her, this and others are in 7 evidence. you can read them. 8 she grew up in the media capital of the 9 world, and she took advantage of the media 10 outlets. she read the new york post. and you 11 saw some of the articles. this is material 12 known and available to her, there in evidence. 13 you can read them. 14 now, ms. block suggested mrs. kaplan only 15 read page 6 of the post. page 6 is the gossip 16 page. 17 but in the next breath, she said that 18 mrs. kaplan kept up on current events and read 19 the general news stories. you do not find 20 either of that on page 6. 21 she read the new york times. you have seen 22 some of these articles. this was material 23 known and available to her. these are in 24 evidence. you can read them. 25 and especially this one, 1964 surgeon general's report. sunday times. exactly what 2 she said. front page, above the fold. 3 known and available to her. 4 here in florida, she read the 5 sun-sentinel. you heard she watched 6 60 minutes. 7 well, the 60 minutes of the 1950s was a 8 show, as you heard, called "see it now," and it 9 was beamed into houses all across the united 10 states. and it beamed in there a two-part 11 series on smoking and health. 12 and the bottom-line message of that 13 program was provided by dr. hammond, the famous 14 cancer researcher, in 1955. 15 let us see what he said. 16 17 18 follows:) 19 voice: it is now established in my 20 opinion beyond a reasonable doubt that 21 cigarette smoking greatly increases the 22 probability of developing lung cancer. 23 in my opinion, people should be warned of 24 the dangers, and they are being warned. 25 what they then want to do, whether they wish to smoke or not, is their own business. 2 (video clip concluded.) 3 mr. kaczynski: now, the fact that people 4 were being warned in the 1950s did not just come 5 from dr. hammond. we heard that it came from 6 these folks, the surgeon general of the united 7 states and the director of the national cancer 8 institute. excellent coverage informing the 9 public. 10 bear in mind, these are people from the 11 1950s, in the 1950s, interested in the public 12 health of the 1950s. 13 these are not people in the year 2015, 14 looking backwards in hindsight and reinventing 15 history -- rewriting history. 16 this is what happened on the ground at 17 the time. people were being warned. 18 and you heard it on the night of 19 january 11, 1964, all three networks had 20 special news reports on the release of the 21 surgeon general's report. you could not avoid 22 the story. 23 here, too, the bottom line was: you have 24 the information. the choice is yours. harry 25 reasoner. (the video clip was played and taken down 2 3 follows:) 4 voice: in this kind of a country, it 5 comes down to you, whether you like it or not. 6 no one is going to forbid an adult to smoke. 7 and it is now quite clear that no one is 8 going to tell him it is good for him either. 9 the decision is his, the decision and the 10 health that may depend on it. 11 this is harry reasoner. good night. 12 (video clip concluded.) 13 mr. kaczynski: this was material known 14 and available to her. 15 there were warning labels. this was 16 material known and available to her. 17 there are public service announcements. 18 these are four that were played for you during 19 the course of this trial. this was material 20 known and available to her. 21 and we all know she also got the message 22 in a very personal way. she saw her sister, a 23 smoker, die of lung cancer. she saw her 24 husband, a smoker, repeatedly hospitalized with 25 lung problems. then she saw her son smoking and warned 2 him: if you keep smoking, you are going to wind 3 up getting a cough like i have. 4 everybody says mrs. kaplan was an 5 intelligent woman. to suggest this intelligent 6 woman ignored all this information that was 7 known and available to her, to suggest that she 8 ignored it and instead relied on lucy and desi 9 or johnny roventini or fred flintstone for her 10 health information, that defies belief. 11 but in any event, even if she did, it 12 would not be reasonable reliance. 13 so when you get to this line on the 14 verdict form, these two lines, we are asking you 15 to check "no." 16 and there is one other instruction you are 17 going to hear that is relevant to this that i 18 want to call to your attention. it is this. 19 if, despite our argument that mrs. kaplan 20 should bear full responsibility for her 21 actions, you think that responsibility ought to 22 be apportioned, then you have got to check "no" 23 to these two questions. 24 why? because judge murphy will instruct 25 you -- already has instructed you -- that if you check "yes," there will be no apportionment 2 of damages between mrs. kaplan and reynolds. 3 mr. mcpharlin: judge, that is not the 4 law. object to that improper reference of the 5 law. 6 the court: thank you. 7 ladies and gentlemen, you have the 8 instructions, the instruction i gave you. this 9 is counsel's take on those instructions. 10 proceed, counsel. 11 mr. kaczynski: thank you. 12 this is the instruction: please note 13 that if you find for plaintiff on either or 14 both of her claims for fraudulent concealment 15 and/or agreement to conceal, the court will not 16 reduce the amount of plaintiff's damages by the 17 percentage of fault you assign to mrs. kaplan. 18 what that means is, if you check "yes" on 19 either of those claims, ms. block will have 20 gotten her wish, and ms. kaplan will be held 21 zero percent responsible. 22 obviously you render your verdict based 23 on the evidence and the instructions you have. 24 but we wanted to let you know about these two 25 questions. and still, this is how we can do it for now. 2 now, if we march down the form and we get 3 to the point where you think money damages are 4 appropriate, then you have to come up with an 5 amount. there will be any number of lines on 6 the verdict form for you to do that. 7 apart from mr. mcpharlin's request for 8 millions, 4 million or 8 million, for the 9 passing of this 84-year-old woman, you do not 10 have a lot of guidance on how to come up with a 11 number. it is tough. 12 but consider these factors. mrs. kaplan 13 lived a full and successful life. she was 14 married for 40 years. she ran and operated a 15 business with her husband. she raised two 16 children. she was fortunate to escape the 17 new york winters and come down here to florida. 18 and in passing away at the age of 84, she had 19 outlived all her siblings by decades. 20 think about it. mrs. kaplan was born 21 during the presidency of calvin coolidge and 22 passed away during the presidency of barack 23 obama. that is a long, long time. 24 as an amount, nobody can hand you a 25 yardstick. let me offer you a few suggestions. you heard mrs. block testify from that 2 witness stand that during her mother's life, 3 she was carrying out her mother's wishes. and 4 you heard that her mother actually filed this 5 lawsuit to start it off. 6 and when she did that, she told us under 7 oath, mrs. kaplan did, what damages she wanted. 8 here it is -- 9 mr. mcpharlin: judge, can we approach 10 for a second? 11 the court: yes, sir. 12 (the following discussion was held at 13 sidebar:) 14 mr. mcpharlin: this is exactly what they 15 told you they were not going to do when we 16 argued about whether this interrogatory could 17 be read. 18 ms. baker told you -- i said, judge, 19 they are going to get up and argue that because 20 the interrogatory reads this way, they are not 21 looking for any damages other than medical. 22 ms. baker said, you know what, judge, 23 we are not going to do that. 24 that is about exactly what they are about 25 to do. mr. kaczynski: your honor, what was 2 represented was plaintiff was not seeking that. 3 clearly, they are seeking it. i'm entitled to 4 suggest a measure of damages. he already did. 5 this is the measure of damages i'm suggesting. 6 mr. mcpharlin: judge, it is completely 7 inconsistent and disingenuous for them to tell 8 you they are not going to argue that we are not 9 seeking damages for that. 10 and now to use it and say they were not 11 seeking damages to that, that is how they got it 12 in. that is how they argued it to you. 13 the court: that is not how they got it 14 in, counsel. there was an interrogatory that 15 was asked, sworn to and -- 16 mr. mcpharlin: but that is not what they 17 told you. 18 the court: i specifically asked what 19 they are going to use and how they are going to 20 use it. 21 my understanding was not to say that 22 there was damages, but there is a purpose to -- 23 there is a purpose for interrogatories, 24 counsel. in the answer -- if you did not like 25 the answer given, you could come back in and changed it. that was the answer given. 2 overruled. let us go. 3 (sidebar discussion concluded, and the 4 following was held in open court:) 5 mr. kaczynski: so during her lifetime, 6 mrs. block testified she was carrying out her 7 mother's wishes. 8 and her mother -- put it up, katie. 9 this was her mother's wish for damages in 10 her lawsuit. medical expenses. medical 11 expenses. 12 now, you heard that number, and i'm going 13 to guess it is in your notes, hundreds of 14 thousands. mrs. kaplan's wishes were a few 15 hundred thousand dollars. 16 ms. block's wishes are, as mr. mcpharlin 17 told you, 4 million or 8 million. 18 we are going to ask you to honor 19 mrs. kaplan's wishes if you decide to award 20 damages and award her what she asked for. 21 now, if you decide that is not sufficient, 22 then i'm going to ask you to think of this. 23 mrs. kaplan's copd was not debilitating. 24 you heard a description by the lawyer 25 this morning about her lifestyle. but do not take lawyer's word for it. let us take the 2 doctor's word for it. 3 what did her doctors say? patient was 4 ambulating independently and performing all 5 activities of daily living independently 6 without any assistive devices. this is up to 7 her stroke. 8 so problems began with her stroke in 9 2012, february 2012, and ended with her passing 10 in september of that same year. 11 you know, it is hard to put a value on a 12 human life. unfortunately, if you get to 13 damages, you are going to have to do that. 14 if you are looking for a yardstick, i 15 would suggest that you think of this lawsuit 16 much like you think of a life insurance policy. 17 and if you do, the numbers come out in 18 the same range. the numbers come out in the 19 range of hundreds of thousands, not the 20 windfall millions plaintiff is asking for. 21 now, if we have been unsuccessful in 22 persuading you up to this point, you will have 23 to decide whether punitive damages are 24 appropriate. 25 and if you find that they are, as mr. mcpharlin said, we will all come back, we will 2 have another session, both sides will put on 3 evidence, both sides will argue again, and you 4 will arrive at a figure. 5 but bear in mind, if you get to -- once 6 you get to that box on punitive damages, if you 7 have awarded money, you will by then have fully 8 compensated ms. block for her loss. 9 punitive damages are designed to punish 10 past misconduct or to deter future misconduct. 11 and the plaintiff must proven entitlement to 12 punitive damages by clear and convincing 13 evidence, and you have in your instructions the 14 definition of that. 15 first of all, let us be clear. punitive 16 damages are simply more money for ms. block. 17 they do not go to the american cancer society, 18 they do not go to a stop smoking program. they 19 do not go to the state of florida. they do not 20 go anywhere other than ms. block. 21 so what were you shown in this trial to 22 get you to award punitive damages? well, a lot 23 of what you were shown by the plaintiffs had 24 nothing to do with ms. kaplan. 25 you saw ads for brands she never smoked, marketing documents from before her birth, 2 marketing documents talking about 18-year-olds 3 at a time she was in her 40s, 50s, and 60s. 4 you heard about ctr and ti, which she had 5 never heard of. nothing to do with her. and a 6 lot of what you heard just was not so or was 7 half the story. 8 when i gave my opening statement, i asked 9 you to keep an open mind until all the evidence 10 was in, and i think you saw some of the reasons 11 for that. 12 so let us go through a handful of those 13 half stories. and let us start with the 14 flintstones. you saw a winston ad on the 15 flintstones, and you were probably shocked. 16 only the video clip, no context, half the 17 story. 18 on cross-examination, we gave you the 19 rest of the story. the flintstones were an 20 adult cartoon based on the honeymooners. it 21 debuted in prime time, not saturday morning. 22 the other sponsor was alka-seltzer, which 23 is an adult product. and when it did go to 24 saturday morning, reynolds pulled its 25 advertising. dr. cummings who told you about this, he 2 knew the context, he knew better, but he 3 concealed that from you. and we had to fill in 4 the rest of the story. 5 you have already had an instruction on 6 credibility of witnesses, and one of the 7 factors is the frankness of the witness. 8 was dr. cummings frank when he did not 9 tell the rest of the story? 10 you saw jed clampett on the beverly 11 hillbillies, and you heard there was a large 12 younger readership. half the story. 13 on cross-examination, we told you the 14 rest of the story. when reynolds found this 15 out, they pulled its sponsorship. 16 you also heard there was a voluntary 17 cigarette advertising code that set the 18 standards by which they pulled their 19 sponsorship. 20 and from the deposition of christie 21 leung, you learned more about that code. you 22 learned the models must be and look under 25. 23 you learned there should be no ads in magazines 24 with 15 or more percent underage readership. 25 no athletes, no celebrities, limits on sampling practices. 2 when you tie all this together, it 3 does not look like an effort to attract kids. 4 looks like an effort to avoid kids. 5 dr. cummings knew this context, he knew 6 it all, but he did not tell you. he concealed 7 that. frankness. 8 dr. cummings talked about the idea that 9 reynolds needed to attract young kids to be 10 profitable. 11 well, one of the very marketing documents 12 they showed you belies that argument. now, 13 this document right here was supposedly a focus 14 of underage smokers. 15 but guess what? go to page 3. and what 16 page 3 tells us, that marlboro, the largest 17 cigarette brand in the world, loses almost half 18 its smokers between the ages of 18 and 24. 19 that is a huge target market. and it is a 20 huge target market among people who have 21 already chosen to use the product. a much 22 easier target than trying to get a nonsmoker to 23 smoke. 24 dr. cummings knew this was there. but he 25 concealed that from you. we had to fill in the rest of the story. 2 frankness. 3 dr. cummings told you about the chain of 4 events that he initiated that produced this 5 letter to the principal of willow ridge school. 6 it was his idea that the students write to all 7 the cigarette companies, and they did. 8 and he told them to write and ask: why 9 do you companies allow your logo to be used on 10 candy cigarettes and toy cars? 11 and there is two points here. first, 12 reynolds was the only company courteous enough 13 to reply. but they replied to the principal, 14 not the students. the principal did not give 15 it to the students. she gave it to 16 dr. cummings. 17 now it is used as a trial exhibit all 18 around the country. 19 but here is the ironic part. you know 20 who showed it to the students? you heard it on 21 the witness stand. dr. cummings. he uses it 22 as a trial exhibit, again, all around the 23 country. 24 second point is, the letter says: why do 25 you guys allow your logo to be used on toy cars and candy cigarettes? 2 fact is, they do not, they never have, and 3 dr. cummings knows it. 4 i showed dr. cummings a number of 5 letters, a number of letters where reynolds 6 threatened legal action against those who used 7 their logo on such products. 8 again, dr. cummings knew the context. 9 dr. cummings knew better. he concealed it from 10 you, and we had to show you. frankness. 11 dr. cummings talked about product 12 placement and suggested that cigarettes were 13 placed in tv shows and movies or events with a 14 high youth viewership. 15 and this was one of the memos they showed 16 you that is supposed to make that point. well, 17 look at where they are placing their products, 18 right? 19 the lucille ball backgammon tournament. 20 is that something 14-year-olds flock to? or 21 how about trying to have zsa zsa gabor smoke 22 cigarettes on tv? do 14-year-old boys have 23 posters of zsa zsa gabor in their rooms? i 24 do not think so. appeals to youth? not 25 exactly. dr. cummings showed you an interview of 2 the incoming head of r&d at reynolds, 3 dr. robert dimarco, in 1982. 4 and in that memo, the lawyers were 5 telling dr. dimarco that he could not pursue a 6 less mutagenic cigarette, a cigarette that did 7 not cause cancer in the laboratory. 8 and they left it there. they left it 9 there. half the story. 10 on cross-examination, we told the true 11 and full story. and the true and full story 12 was, beginning a year earlier, in 1981, 13 reynolds was already developing premier. what. 14 was premier? one of the design goals of 15 premier, which they met, was to produce a less 16 mutagenic cigarette. 17 and that is proven by any battery of tests 18 that you heard that reynolds conducted, inside 19 and outside the company. 20 dr. cummings did not tell you that 21 dr. dimarco won and the lawyers lost. he knew 22 the context. he knew better. but he concealed 23 that from you. 24 we had to fill in the rest of the story. 25 another example of dr. cummings' frankness. speaking of frank, let us talk about the 2 frank statement. 3 dr. cummings said that the frank 4 statement, which only ran one single day in 5 1954, this was not a recurrent campaign, one 6 single day, somehow this reassured smokers and 7 created confusion among them about the risks of 8 smoking. 9 what dr. cummings did not show you is 10 this. this was a survey of 400 smokers that 11 said -- did not reassure people; it scared 12 people. it scared people into cutting down, 13 and in some cases, stopping. 14 dr. cummings knew about this. he did not 15 show you. we did. 16 now, the word "lying" has been used 17 fairly promiscuously in this courtroom. let us 18 take a look at a few of the so-called lies. 19 one of them is that the company's claim 20 the case against cigarettes had not been 21 scientifically proven. 22 first of all, we showed you these 23 epidemiological studies from 1950. none of 24 them, none of them, concluded smoking caused 25 lung cancer. mr. mcpharlin: judge, counsel is not 2 permitted to argue against the findings. 3 the court: sustained. 4 you are not allowed to argue against the 5 findings. sustained. 6 come sidebar. 7 (the following discussion was held at 8 sidebar:) 9 mr. kaczynski: i'm just arguing what the 10 company said. i'm not saying what they said was 11 wrong -- was right. 12 mr. mcpharlin: no. he said, let us talk 13 about the lies that were supposed to have been 14 made, then he started -- 15 the court: that is the way i took it. 16 rephrase. thank you. 17 (sidebar discussion concluded, and the 18 following was held in open court:) 19 mr. mcpharlin: move to strike, 20 your honor? 21 the court: counsel, i've already 22 instructed the jury, disregard. 23 mr. kaczynski: let us talk about what the 24 companies thought, what evidence you saw about 25 what the companies thought. in 1953, claude teague did not say 2 smoking caused lung cancer. this is what he 3 said in his memo. it is still unknown. 4 at a meeting of hill & knowlton, the 5 company had stated their belief that the 6 national cancer institute had refuted such 7 claim. 8 and we showed you the national cancer 9 institute study that they were referring to. 10 throughout the 1950s and 1960s, prominent 11 doctors held the same view. and these are just 12 some of them. you have heard what they had to 13 say. 14 and dr. spears from lorillard, in his 15 deposition, explained why the companies held to 16 that position. 17 to them, the classic scientific 18 definition of cause required two things. it 19 required inhalation experiments that produced 20 human-type lung tumors in animals and 21 identifying the mechanism by which lung cancer 22 developed. 23 and he told you that as of the date of 24 his deposition, the first never happened, and 25 the second had only begun to be understood. dr. figlar told you that in 1964, the 2 definition of cause had changed. it was 3 relaxed. 4 and under that relaxed definition, the 5 surgeon general's committee found that smoking 6 caused lung cancer. and yes, the industry 7 refused to accept that. 8 but did they sincerely believe what they 9 were saying? 10 mr. mcpharlin: judge, he is doing 11 exactly what the findings -- 12 the court: counsel, i do not want to 13 argue sidebar. all right? i mean, argue in 14 front of the jury. just come sidebar. 15 (the following discussion was held at 16 sidebar:) 17 the court: yes, sir. 18 mr. mcpharlin: he is arguing that the 19 companies did not do anything wrong, they did not 20 conceal anything, and they did not mislead the 21 public. they just simply had an honest belief 22 that was different than the surgeon general. 23 that is the argument he is making. that 24 is completely against the findings, and he is 25 not allowed to do it. mr. kaczynski: your honor, the findings 2 do not specifically say what it was that was 3 concealed and what was misrepresented. 4 i'm entitled to talk about those things. 5 this is what the companies thought internally. 6 it has nothing to do with the findings. it is 7 completely independent of the findings. 8 the court: counsel, the way it is being 9 displayed to the jury is that it sounds to me 10 like it is arguing against the findings. that is 11 not acceptable. 12 i'm going to sustain the objection. talk 13 about what is in evidence. 14 (sidebar discussion concluded, and the 15 following was held in open court:) 16 mr. kaczynski: so what is in evidence, 17 you see some memos from the head of one tobacco 18 company to the head of another tobacco company 19 where they express some doubt about the state 20 of the science. 21 not press releases. they are not 22 designed for the general public. it is one 23 person to another person expressing their 24 personal views. 25 you have seen some documents in evidence in this case, one scientist to another, 2 confidential to the company, not for the 3 purpose of the public, where one writes another 4 expressing their personal views. 5 but regardless of what public position 6 they took, what did the companies do 7 internally? 8 well, what they did is, as you heard from 9 dr. robinson, dr. spears, and dr. figlar by 10 deposition, they took the charges seriously, 11 and they worked to modify the product. 12 first, they worked to identify the 13 chemicals in cigarette smoke. you heard that 14 dr. rodgman from reynolds was a leader in this. 15 he published on the subject. and we showed you 16 a speech that he gave on that subject in 1969. 17 then they tried to eliminate some of 18 those compounds they found that were suspect. 19 you saw one of those documents. this is 20 one that talks about 120 experiments using half 21 a million cigarettes to lower or reduce a 22 harmful substance in tobacco smoke. 23 you heard that lorillard worked with 24 dr. hoffmann to reduce or eliminate phenols 25 thought to be a cancer cause. various design changes were formulated, 2 and they were tested internally and with the 3 tobacco working group. 4 the public health community called for 5 filters, and the companies responded. the 6 public health community called for low tar, and 7 the companies responded. the public health 8 community called for low tar, medium nicotine, 9 and the companies responded. 10 and years later, reynolds developed the 11 heat-but-not-burn technology that created 12 premier and eclipse, and now e-cigarettes. 13 so even as they stood by their position 14 for the classic definition of causation, they 15 worked to modify the product to make it less 16 hazardous. 17 but even as they maintained this 18 position, they developed premier, and they 19 spent billions doing it, and they developed 20 eclipse, which even dr. cummings thought was a 21 responsible thing to do, eclipse and premier, 22 which he thought were safer alternatives to 23 conventional cigarettes. and eclipse is on the 24 market today. 25 so let us clear the air on filters. no question that prominent scientists like 2 dr. wynder encouraged the companies to 3 manufacture filters and advocated for smokers 4 who would not quit to use them. 5 and there is no question that 6 epidemiological studies conducted by people 7 like dr. wynder and dr. hoffmann concluded that 8 smokers of filter and low tar had lower cancer 9 rates than smokers of non-filters. 10 remember dr. russell in britain? filters 11 save lives. 12 so how does dr. cummings then come in 13 here and say filters may, in fact, be more 14 dangerous than non-filters? 15 well, he had two reasons. one was he 16 said that new epidemiology after mrs. kaplan 17 had quit smoking called the earlier 18 epidemiology into question. 19 second, though, he said the companies 20 knew that filters were useless and promoted 21 them anyway. 22 what is his proof of that? 23 mr. mcpharlin: judge, same argument. 24 the court: overruled. 25 mr. kaczynski: the proof of that is one philip morris document that uses the phrase 2 "illusion of filtration." 3 what we have shown about r.j. reynolds. 4 well, they showed you a document from 1956 5 about winston. it said that filtered winston 6 had higher levels of polycyclic aromatic 7 hydrocarbons than unfiltered camels. what is 8 the rest of the story? 9 this is 1956. at this point, winston had 10 been on the market about two years. what 11 dr. cummings in his document did not show you 12 was this. this was an alarming result to 13 reynolds, and they launched a reinvestigation 14 of the winston blend. and you were not shown 15 another document of reynolds that this ever 16 happened again with winston. 17 what about lorillard? you saw ads 18 touting lorillard's kent filter. you heard it 19 was rated as the most effective filter by an 20 outside rating organization. you heard that 21 was reported in reader's digest. you heard 22 that the reader's digest report spiked kent's 23 sales and that lorillard exploited the story. 24 what you were not shown by dr. cummings 25 was any evidence that lorillard did not believe everything it said in those kent filter ads. 2 mr. mcpharlin: judge, same argument. 3 mr. kaczynski: there is no finding about 4 filters, your honor. 5 the court: excuse me, guys. i told you 6 before, we are not going to argue this in front 7 of the jury. come sidebar, please. 8 (the following discussion was held at 9 sidebar:) 10 the court: counsel, let us get this 11 straight. a couple things. one is, the 12 findings are the findings. you cannot challenge 13 those findings. 14 mr. kaczynski: right. 15 the court: excuse me. the documents 16 that are in evidence are in evidence, and the 17 witness talked about them. so what the 18 findings basically talk about, that cannot be 19 questioned by you, carried the same weight. 20 concealed or omitted information. he is 21 talking about documents now that are in 22 evidence. he is allowed to talk about those 23 documents in evidence, what was said in there. 24 what i do not want to have happen is the 25 argument counsel is saying; these findings are challenged. that is what i heard before and 2 that is what i sustained before. 3 be careful now. i do not want you 4 interrupting his closing all the time. if he is 5 challenging the documents, and you have a good 6 faith reason to believe he is, raise the 7 objection. otherwise, move on. 8 (sidebar discussion concluded, and the 9 following was held in open court:) 10 mr. kaczynski: after the spike, based on 11 the reader's digest article, sales steadily 12 declined. now, is it a surprise that lorillard 13 exploited that story? think about it. 14 if volvo gets an award for highway 15 safety, you think you will not see it in volvo 16 ads? if chevy is named car of the year, you 17 think you will not see that in chevy ads? it 18 happens every day. 19 at the end of the day, the facts are 20 these: throughout mrs. kaplan's lifetime, 21 there was scientific evidence that filters and 22 low tar produced lower cancer rates than 23 non-filters. during her lifetime, the public 24 health community advocated filters and low tar. 25 during her lifetime, the cancer society advocated filters and low tar, and the 2 companies responded. 3 dr. cummings told you that the ftc 4 smoking method, the machine, was inaccurate. 5 what he did not tell you was the companies told 6 the ftc exactly that, back in 1967, when they 7 were considering adopting them. but the ftc 8 adopted it anyway. and it later took a step 9 further and required the companies to put those 10 readings in its ads. 11 you did not hear from dr. cummings on 12 direct, but you did on cross, that once upon a 13 time, lorillard wanted to put higher numbers in 14 its ads. and the ftc told them no; you have got 15 to put our numbers in, because to do otherwise 16 would be misleading. 17 you saw the congressional hearings back 18 from 1994. in fact, they ended dr. cummings' 19 direct examination by playing those for you. 20 that was when congressman wyden went down the 21 line of ceos, asking them if nicotine was 22 addictive. 23 one ceo, however, wanted to say more than 24 yes or no, and that was jim johnston, the ceo 25 of reynolds. he started to say nicotine did not meet the classical definition of addiction, 2 there is no intoxication. but mr. johnston was 3 ruining congressman wyden's sound bite, so he 4 got cut off. 5 we played for you mr. johnston's prepared 6 statement to the committee, where he did get to 7 explain himself. and in his prepared 8 statement, he talked about the classical 9 definition, which included intoxication. he 10 said smoking could be difficult for some to 11 quit. he did not simply want to put his 12 customers in the same category as heroin users 13 or alcoholics. 14 yes, he would not buy into the word 15 "addiction," but he had reasons for it. call 16 him stubborn. but you cannot call him anything 17 beyond that. 18 now, some of the biggest whoppers you 19 were told in this trial dealt with nicotine. 20 fact: reynolds did nicotine research in the 21 '70s and '80s. is this a surprise? and coffee 22 manufacturers, no doubt, do studies into 23 caffeine. 24 according to dr. cummings, this research 25 was done to find the minimum level of nicotine to keep smokers hooked. he showed you some 2 memos with some stupid language from dr. teague 3 to this point. 4 but we showed you what was really going 5 on. we showed you calls by the public health 6 community to develop a low-tar, medium-nicotine 7 cigarette in the 1970s and '80s. who made 8 those calls? these are names you have seen 9 before: dr. russell, sir richard doll, 10 dr. jarvik, the co-inventor of the nicotine 11 patch, and in the 1981 surgeon general's 12 report. 13 the idea was to lower tar, but to 14 maintain nicotine. the idea is tar is the 15 cancer-causing agent in cigarettes. get it 16 down as far as you can; but if you want people 17 to smoke, keep nicotine at a higher level. 18 the theory is smokers would then smoke 19 potentially less-hazardous cigarette. that is 20 what "how low can you go" was all about. they 21 were calling for those cigarettes at about the 22 same time dr. teague was writing his memos. 23 and that is no coincidence, because we 24 showed you in reynolds documents that reynolds 25 was following this research. they were following dr. russell. so they researched ways 2 to lower the tar while maintaining the 3 nicotine. 4 and they did it in conjunction with the 5 tobacco working group. you saw those minutes. 6 they researched ways to break the tar/nicotine 7 ratio. they tried ammonia, they tried 8 levulinic acid, they tried altering ph. and 9 this was discussed in the tobacco working 10 group, sponsored by the national cancer 11 institute. and you heard testimony of 12 dr. robinson that lorillard did the same thing. 13 in following the recommendations of the 14 tobacco working group to research nicotine 15 levels and develop a less hazardous cigarette, 16 is that punishable conduct? is that 17 reprehensible conduct? that is your call on the 18 issue of punitive damages. 19 and it is true that reynolds researched 20 the effect of nicotine on the brain in the 21 1980s and 1990s. dr. cummings suggested to you 22 this was for some nefarious purpose. but 23 again, what is the rest of the story? 24 well, on cross-examination, dr. cummings 25 told us about targacept. that is a company that reynolds spun off in the 1990s, that was headed 2 by one of its r&d scientists, dr. don 3 debethizy, who dr. cummings knew. the whole 4 goal was to use reynolds' nicotine research to 5 find treatments for alzheimer's, for 6 parkinson's, for add, and they are awaiting fda 7 approval for some of their treatments. 8 reynolds put out a book about nicotine 9 that i showed dr. cummings. he claims he never 10 saw it. think about that. this is the man who 11 claims he knows everything about everything 12 about everything about what the tobacco 13 companies were doing and, in particular, what 14 r.j. reynolds was doing. 15 but here's a book reynolds put out in 16 1992, summarizing research of nicotine on the 17 brain, and he claims he never saw it. 18 really? 19 i went through with him, you may recall, 20 all 13 chapters of this book, many of them 21 authored by reynolds scientists. and he 22 admitted that all 13 dealt with the effect of 23 nicotine on the brain. all 13 were disclosed 24 in this book to the scientific community. 25 on the issue of punitive damages, is doing research that is spun off to a company to 2 treat alzheimer's, add and parkinson's, and 3 then publishing your research in a book 4 punishable? is that reprehensible conduct? 5 that is your call. 6 dr. cummings faulted reynolds for 7 inventing the modern cigarette, because he says 8 it became inhalable, and therefore more 9 addictive. well, first of all, it is 10 historically wrong. camel was introduced in 11 1913. we heard that. and this is a slide that 12 was used during dr. cummings' direct 13 examination. 14 this was florida health notes in 1906, 15 before camel. and what does it say? addictive 16 and inhalable before the modern cigarette was 17 invented. and this is where the state of 18 florida concluded, way back in 1906, cigarette 19 smoking is looked upon by all smokers as the 20 worst form of tobacco addiction, and it is 21 inhaled. 22 the court: ten minutes, counsel. 23 mr. kaczynski: thank you, your honor. 24 think about it, uninhalable cigarettes, 25 really? what is next? to prevent cirrhosis, undrinkable booze? to car accidents, 2 undriveable cars? 3 there are, there have been for hundreds 4 of years a form of tobacco use that you cannot 5 inhale. it is called a cigar. it is called a 6 cigar. smokers expect cigarettes to be 7 inhalable. and if they do not, they could smoke 8 a cigar. 9 now, i do not want to suggest to you that 10 reynolds has engaged in good and proper conduct 11 for the 65 or so years we are talking about 12 here, but they did some. 13 the companies that now comprise reynolds 14 did cooperate with the public health community. 15 lorillard cooperated with dr. wynder in skin 16 painting. lorillard sponsored research at ohio 17 state university to identify and reduce the 18 constituents of smoke. 19 all companies made submissions to the 20 surgeon general's advisory commit, page upon 21 page upon page of disclosure there of 22 components of cigarette smoke. 23 the companies provided the green monster 24 to the surgeon general's committee, used by the 25 committee. lorillard worked with dr. hoffmann on phenols. dr. rodgman published and gave 2 speeches on constituents. rjr and lorillard 3 participated in the tobacco working group. 4 lorillard worked with the institute of medicine 5 on lower-exposure products. reynolds published 6 its book on nicotine, and reynolds hosted 7 scientific conferences on eclipse. 8 should the companies have accepted the 9 consensus that smoking caused disease sooner 10 than they did? probably. should they have not 11 criticized the surgeon general every time a 12 report came out? clearly not. were they too 13 stubborn accepting the surgeon general's 14 changed definition of addiction? maybe. 15 but to the extent you think there is a 16 need for reynolds to be punished, that has 17 already happened; such that there is no reason 18 to give additional money to ms. block to 19 achieve that goal. 20 and you heard from dr. cummings in 21 relationship to the master settlement agreement 22 and the florida settlement agreement. 23 mr. mcpharlin: judge, that is improper 24 argument. 25 the court: overruled. mr. kaczynski: under these agreements, 2 1997 for florida and a few other states, and 3 1998 for the rest, the tobacco institute was 4 shut down, ctr was shut down, documents were 5 disclosed, billboards are gone. reynolds pays 6 millions of dollars every year to every state 7 in perpetuity, forever. 8 and now, on account of its mergers, 9 reynolds pays the share of brown & williamson 10 and lorillard as well. 11 punishment has happened, and will happen 12 forever. there is no need for additional 13 punishment in this case by giving additional 14 money to ms. block. 15 and the other purpose of punitive damages 16 is deterrence; to deter reynolds and others 17 from engaging in future misconduct. let us see 18 whether there is a need to award ms. block more 19 money for the purposes of deterrence. 20 where does reynolds find itself in the 21 21st century? well, you heard from 22 dr. cummings, they are regulated by the fda. 23 this is new. they developed premier and 24 eclipse. dr. cummings thinks these are great, 25 and safer than conventional cigarettes. a sister company of reynolds manufactures 2 zonnic. zonnic is in the marketplace, 3 fda-approved, a nicotine gum, a stop smoking 4 aid. sold in convenience stores alongside 5 cigarettes, in packs like cigarettes. 6 dr. cummings thinks this is a great business 7 model. 8 reynolds manufactures vuse, an 9 e-cigarette. dr. cummings says e-cigarettes is 10 a good things. it is a way for a smoker to 11 obtain nicotine without -- and this is his 12 word, not mine -- all the crap. 13 you heard that reynolds refitted tobacco 14 barns, to use a different kind of heat for 15 curing, heat exchange instead of propane. and 16 it reduced carcinogens in tobacco by 17 95 percent. reynolds published about this 18 development, and it paid for 1,200 tobacco 19 barns to be refitted with the new technology. 20 reynolds has a website. this website 21 says there is no safe tobacco products. it 22 says quitting reduces the risk. it advises 23 smokers concerned about their smoking to quit. 24 did you ever think you would see a 25 tobacco company advising people to quit? well, reynolds does. 2 instead of criticizing the surgeon 3 general, it directs people to the surgeon 4 general and public health organizations for 5 advice, and gives them links on how to get 6 there. and it lists the ingredients for any 7 brands or any style of cigarettes. 8 and it maintains a document website. it 9 contains reynolds documents produced in 10 litigation so that, after this trial is over, 11 when the judge clears you of your obligation 12 not to do your own research, you can do your 13 own research on these websites to find 14 documents just like you saw in this trial. 15 this is the environment the companies are 16 in in the 21st century. if you feel they 17 were not sufficiently regulated in the past, 18 they are now. if you think they were not making 19 safer cigarettes in the past, they are now. 20 if you think they were not doing anything 21 to help people quit in the past, they are now. 22 if you are concerned about transparency, you can 23 go to the document databases. and if you take 24 all these factors, together with the punishment 25 forever in the master settlement agreement, millions of dollars per year per state, there 2 is no need for punitive damages, there is no 3 need for more money for ms. block, there is no 4 need to come back for yet another session and 5 more witnesses and more argument. 6 so we are asking you to check "no" on this 7 part of the verdict form. 8 time to wrap up. 9 this is the only chance i get to talk to 10 you. plaintiff has the burden of proof. i sit 11 down, they get a rebuttal. in this case, a 12 fairly lengthy one. i do not know what is going 13 to be said. we do not get to respond. that is 14 the way it works. he may say something that i 15 could have responded to in this argument; he 16 may have said something that could have been 17 responded to earlier. 18 but if any of that happens, what i would 19 ask you to do, think about how we would have 20 responded. think about how we would have 21 answered them during the course of your 22 deliberations. 23 i want to thank you for your service and 24 for your attention. and bottom line once again 25 is, we could not have done this without you. thank you very much. 2 thank you, your honor.
