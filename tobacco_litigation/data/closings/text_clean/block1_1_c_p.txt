19 mr. mcpharlin: thank you, your honor. 20 counsel; your honor. 21 good morning. 22 jurors: good morning. 23 mr. mcpharlin: so, on behalf of sharon 24 and, of course, lillian -- 25 lillian started this lawsuit. she is endured through this litigation from the 2 beginning. she filed her lawsuit in 2007, but, 3 unfortunately, did not make it to see the end of 4 that. and, so, that is what we are here to do 5 today, to do this week, to see it through. 6 and we know that you have given up a huge 7 chunk of your life over these last few weeks to 8 be here. without you, this process does not 9 work. wrongs do not get adjudicated. those who 10 committed those wrongs escape accountability if 11 we do not have a process like this, if folks 12 like you are not willing to give up the time 13 that you have given us. so, of course -- 14 and, obviously, we thank you. and i'm 15 going to try not to waste any of your time 16 today. i'm going to move as quickly as i can. 17 somebody will probably slow me down eventually. 18 and i'm going to try to take you through 19 everything that i think that i can highlight to 20 you, that will show you, as we go through -- as 21 what you will go through in the verdict form as 22 part of your responsibility in this case. 23 as it has always been with the cigarette 24 industry, they do not want you to focus on 25 them. they do not want you to look at what they did and what they created. and this is what 2 they created (indicating). this is what they 3 did. 4 we talked about the importance of these 5 time frames, we talked about the importance of 6 consumption and changes in the product that 7 they created, that were done intentionally by 8 them. these were not mistakes. these were not 9 done by accident. 10 this is what they did. this is what they 11 created. this graph is still growing. this 12 graph is not finished. lillian is a victim, a 13 part of this now. 14 they want you to think that it is just a 15 bunch of people who wanted to smoke themselves 16 to death. that is what they want you to think. 17 it is not about their conduct, it is not about 18 their product, it is not about their 19 engineering, it is not about what they did; it is 20 just a bunch of people who did not have the will 21 to stop doing what they knew from the '30s and 22 the '40s would eventually kill them. 23 they are going to tell you that selling 24 cigarettes is legal, marketing and advertising 25 cigarettes are legal, but that is only half of the sentence. that is only half of the 2 statement. 3 what they cannot do is lie, what they 4 cannot do is create fake scientific 5 organizations, tell the public health 6 community, hey, we have got your back, we have got 7 the public's interest as our paramount 8 consideration, and we promise you -- we promise 9 that we are going to get to the bottom of this, 10 we promise that we are going to figure it out. 11 science, to date, has not proven that 12 cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, or any 13 other disease, but you do not have to worry 14 about it. we are going to put tens and 15 hundreds of millions of dollars into scientific 16 organizations, independent, neutral 17 organizations, that are going to get to the 18 bottom of this question. 19 so, selling a legal product, yeah, that is 20 great, that is business, that is what we have, 21 that is what our country prides itself on; but 22 what we also pride ourself on is not deceiving 23 consumers and our children, the public. 24 so you can market something if you want 25 to, but you better do it honestly. you can market something if you want to make money, but 2 you better do it the right way. 3 and when you do not, when you harm 4 somebody because of the way that you have 5 conducted yourself, you are responsible for the 6 harms that you caused. 7 it is very simple. it is not a complicated 8 equation. they want you to think it is 9 complicated, but it is not. they lied, they 10 misled, they deceived, they confused. 11 these are not my words; these are their 12 own words. 13 the choices that they made were to create 14 a litigation strategy, not a legitimate effort 15 to protect their consumers, not a legitimate 16 effort to help public health officials get to 17 the bottom of the question. 18 their strategy was litigation. their 19 strategy was selling their product at any 20 price. the price -- the price were lies. the 21 price were one out of two people were going to 22 die using the product that they told everybody 23 was okay to use. 24 the engle jury, the engle class action 25 jury told them: you lied, you deceived, you manufactured a product that caused harm. you 2 did it so people would rely on it. you 3 concealed, with your other manufacturers, other 4 organizations that you created, to deceive the 5 public. they got caught. 6 and, so, we spent a lot of time talking 7 about what they did, a lot of time showing you 8 where we started and where we ended up. we 9 did not do it because we were trying to re-prove 10 what the jury in the engle class action 11 decided. that is not the purpose of it. 12 a couple of reasons: one, because you 13 have to know. you have to know what that 14 history is. 15 and the very last question on your 16 verdict form is going to be, is what they did, 17 what they did to this country, what they did to 18 lillian, what they did, was it reprehensible? 19 does it require us to spend a little more 20 time so that a punishment, an appropriate 21 punishment, can be exacted out on them, to 22 punish them for what they did, and to deter 23 them from doing it again, and to deter others 24 from thinking that this is an okay way to 25 conduct yourself, that corporations will know that this was not appropriate? 2 so the first thing -- 3 let us go to the slides. 4 we get to the very first issue for you, 5 and what i'm going to try to do is i'm going to 6 try to take us through, essentially, the 7 verdict form for you, and i'm going to do the 8 best i can. there is a lot of evidence, there is 9 a lot of things that have been discussed, 10 there is a lot of issues for you. 11 i think they are going to try to make them 12 seem to be very complicated, but let us talk 13 about the first one. the first one is class 14 membership. and it is really not that 15 complicated, all right? 16 it is not about fault, it is not about 17 awareness, it is not about choices, it is not 18 about what brands she smoked. it is not about 19 any of that. 20 was she addicted? did her addiction 21 cause her to continue to smoke until -- did it 22 contribute to that, until she was -- until she 23 contracted copd? 24 very simple: addiction and copd. 25 it is very straightforward, it is very important, because obviously if your answer to 2 that question is "no," then the case is over. 3 if your answer to that question is "no," you have 4 determined that lillian is not a part of the 5 class, r.j. reynolds wins, and the case is 6 over. it is simple because it is very 7 straightforward. 8 and we have to prove our claim by the 9 greater weight of the evidence, right? that is 10 our burden of proof, greater weight of the 11 evidence. what is more likely than not? 12 what do we have to do? we have to prove 13 to you everything that we have to prove. every 14 question on this verdict form, every issue that 15 we have the burden on, is by that standard, 16 greater weight of the evidence, what is more 17 likely than not. 18 it is not reasonable doubt, it is not 19 significantly more than the other; it is what is 20 more likely than not. 21 and i think, based on the evidence that 22 we have presented you with, we have clearly met 23 that burden and we have far exceeded "more 24 likely than not." but that is the standard. 25 that is what we have to prove our case by. and, so, let us start with the very first 2 issue, her copd. what caused her copd? 3 well, the judge read to you, in the 4 instructions, approximately five or six things 5 that r.j. reynolds agreed to. of those five or 6 six things, one of them was not that cigarette 7 smoking was the cause of her copd. because of 8 that, because of their -- 9 because of that, we have to prove it, 10 right? if they do not agree to it, we have to 11 prove it. 12 now, despite that, we have what you were 13 read -- what was read to you in trial. this 14 was an admission by r.j. reynolds. 15 all right. this is from his honor: 16 ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the 17 plaintiff's request for admissions on the 18 defendant r.j. reynolds tobacco company prior 19 to trial, their responses have been recorded. 20 you are to accept these facts as true. 21 proceed. 22 admit that lillian kaplan's copd was 23 caused by smoking cigarettes. 24 answer: reynolds admits that smoking was 25 the medical cause of lillian kaplan's copd. now, despite that, we still had to prove 2 it to you at trial. 3 mr. kaczynski: objection, your honor. 4 the court: sustained. 5 mr. mcpharlin: we had to prove it to you 6 at trial. 7 mr. kaczynski: objection, your honor. 8 the court: overruled. 9 proceed, counsel. 10 mr. mcpharlin: so what did we do? we 11 presented you with the testimony of -- 12 well, we presented you their admission. 13 we presented you with the testimony of 14 dr. weiner. 15 what did dr. weiner say? dr. weiner 16 said -- 17 dr. weiner said clearly in his 18 testimony -- i'll find it -- that her copd -- 19 if you remember, if your recollections are -- 20 her copd was caused by cigarette smoking. 21 dr. keller, their expert, said -- 22 testified under oath that her copd was caused 23 by cigarette smoking. 24 so we have r.j. reynolds' admission, we 25 have testimony from dr. weiner, and we have the sworn testimony from their own expert that her 2 copd was caused by smoking. 3 and, so, i think that leaves that issue 4 alone, that you should not have to worry about 5 that issue. it gets us to the next issue on 6 addiction: was lillian kaplan addicted? did 7 lillian kaplan's addiction cause copd? did it 8 substantially contribute to her copd? 9 all right. and, so, one of the things 10 you are going to get, one of the things -- 11 instructions you have already gotten is legal 12 cause. 13 addiction is a legal cause of her copd if 14 it directly and in natural and continuous 15 sequence produces or contributes substantially 16 to producing such copd, so that it can 17 reasonably be said that, but for the addiction, 18 the copd would not have occurred. 19 but for the addiction, if she was not 20 addicted to nicotine, would she have smoked two 21 packs a day for almost 50 years? 22 two packs a day, 40 cigarettes a day. 23 that is 10,900 cigarettes a year; 547,000 over 24 her lifetime. we talked about how much 25 nicotine that is, how much -- how many doses of nicotine that is that somebody is taking 2 throughout the day, throughout the week, 3 throughout the year, throughout their lifetime. 4 6,843,000. 114,000 hours spent smoking. 7,000 5 days spent smoking. 19.5 years. 6 did her addiction substantially 7 contribute to that behavior? what is more 8 likely than not? that she did it -- like 9 dr. kaplan wants you to think, that she did it 10 because she liked the taste, that she spent all 11 that time because she liked the smell, that she 12 went back to it time and time again, after 13 trying to quit, because she liked the social 14 aspect of it? is that reasonable? 15 so what it is not about -- 16 and, remember, legal cause is a cause. 17 it is not the only cause; it is one of the 18 causes. 19 so did her -- 20 was her addiction a cause, a legal cause? 21 did it substantially contribute, among many 22 other things, but did that substantially 23 contribute to her continued smoking and the 24 development of her copd? 25 so it is not about choice. that is not part of the question, that is not part of the 2 instructions that you are getting, that is not 3 the answer that you are asked on the verdict 4 form. 5 that is an issue that they raised, that is 6 an issue they want you to focus on; right? but 7 it has nothing to do with class membership. 8 zero. nothing. 9 was she addicted and did that addiction 10 substantially contribute to her developing 11 copd? 12 and, so, we have to look at her. we have 13 to look at what her smoking behavior was. she 14 started at age 12, smoked a pack a day, 15 unfiltered camels, moved up to two packs a day, 16 and she told you why. she just needed to smoke 17 more. 18 she smoked first thing in the morning. 19 she is grabbing her cigarettes before her feet 20 hit the floor, within minutes of waking up, 21 since she was in high school. that is what she 22 did. that is what compelled her. 23 she smoked while she was pregnant. she 24 smoked around her children. she took in huge 25 doses of nicotine every single day. her brain was flushed with nicotine every single day. 2 she bought cigarettes by the carton, she 3 inhaled deeply like they wanted her to do, like 4 they were teaching the public how to do. she 5 could smoke anywhere. she just craved it. 6 and she tried to quit for decades. even 7 dr. kaplan admits that she tried to quit. her 8 children saw her trying to quit. dr. kaplan 9 says that because she could not remember or 10 report how she felt when she quit in '94, it 11 just means that all of those other years, all 12 of those other decades, all of those other 13 attempts, everything her kids noticed, 14 everything lillian noticed, everything she 15 felt, that was not withdrawal. it could not have 16 been. 17 she hits what we see as rock bottom in 18 1994, when what she is given, in her mind, is a 19 death sentence. 20 she obviously did not know at that time 21 that her death would be caused by lung cancer, 22 but what she thought was a death sentence was 23 from her copd. 24 and they wheeled in oxygen, and they put 25 her on oxygen, and the doctor diagnosed her with copd. and she was severely limited in her 2 breathing, severely limited in her lung 3 function, and, because of that, she cannot 4 remember or recall how she was feeling. she 5 was more focused on living, surviving, using 6 her oxygen, getting through that moment in her 7 life. 8 she tried to quit with her husband, she 9 tried to quit on her own. she told you, her 10 words, she needed to smoke. she craved it. 11 they asked her about enjoyment. it 12 was not that i enjoyed it. i hated myself for 13 it. it was something i had to do. 14 the only evidence in the case that you 15 have is that, with her quit attempts, her many, 16 many quit attempts, she got distracted, she 17 felt all different kinds of withdrawal 18 symptoms. there is no evidence to dispute that. 19 her son talked about flu-like symptoms. 20 he saw her sick in bed when she was trying to 21 quit. she would get irritable, nervous. she 22 would get angry. she yelled at her kids, which 23 she never did. she yelled at her husband, 24 which she did not do. she was a different 25 person. that was the observations of her family, and there is no evidence to contradict 2 that. 3 so that is the evidence about what she 4 went through when she tried to quit. and 5 despite going through that, she tried it again 6 and again and again. 7 even dr. kaplan admitted that there is not 8 only one way to look at addiction. we know 9 that through dr. kaplan, because when he 10 started testifying for the tobacco companies in 11 the late '90s, he did not think cigarette 12 smoking was addictive, he did not think nicotine 13 was a drug, and he did not think, so he says, 14 that nicotine was addictive. 15 that is what he said under oath in 1999, 16 when he testified for the cigarette industry in 17 the engle class action. 18 compulsive need for and use of a 19 habit-forming substance characterized by 20 tolerance with well-defined physiological 21 symptoms upon withdrawal. persistent, 22 compulsive use of a substance known by the user 23 to be harmful. 24 that fits lillian kaplan to a tee. that 25 fits the evidence that you have seen, and there is no substantial evidence to the contrary. 2 the definition recognized by even 3 dr. kaplan, "addiction" is defined as a 4 chronic, relapsing brain disease that is 5 characterized by compulsive use -- compulsive 6 drug-seeking and use, despite the harmful 7 consequences. a chronic, relapsing brain 8 disease. 9 dr. cummings talked to you about it. 10 even dr. kaplan admitted that nicotine changes 11 your brain, and it changes it in a considerable 12 way. 13 and the only one who is done research, the 14 only one who has been consulted by the surgeon 15 general, the cdc, the national institutes of 16 health, international and domestic 17 organizations that are designed for public 18 health, was dr. cummings. 19 and he talked to you about how 20 significant this impacts our brain, how 21 significant it impacts the brain of a teenager, 22 of a child, and how important that is in the -- 23 in creating, developing and sustaining 24 addiction. 25 and she started when she was 12. she is a pack a day by the time she is 17. so, by the 2 mid-'40s, she is a pack a day. her brain has 3 already started changing. she is not even 20 4 years old yet. 5 the american psychiatric association 6 defines "addiction" as a chronic brain disease 7 that causes compulsive substance use despite 8 harmful consequences. compulsive substance 9 use. 10 dr. cummings talked about the key 11 features of lillian's smoking behavior. she 12 had persistent daily use. the time to her 13 first cigarette, which has been validated and 14 scientifically studied for many decades, how 15 important that is, what that means, how much -- 16 how important that is in terms of how hard it 17 is going to be for somebody to quit smoking, 18 she smoked within minutes. 19 she smoked two packs a day. she started 20 early. she tried to quit. she went through 21 withdrawal symptoms. she continued despite 22 hearing rumors. at the very least, she is 23 concerned and she is trying to quit. 24 the judge read you an instruction that 25 you may accept such opinion -- regarding expert testimony, you may 2 accept such opinions -- opinion testimony, 3 reject it, or give it the weight you think it 4 deserves, considering the knowledge, skill, 5 experience, training or education of the 6 witness. 7 they want you to think that she smoked 8 enough -- 9 they will admit that she smoked enough to 10 cause a life-threatening disease, chronic 11 obstructive pulmonary disease, but not any of 12 it, not part of it, not even a little bit of it 13 was because she smoked because of an addiction. 14 that is what they want you to think. she 15 smoked herself into a fatal disease, but her 16 addiction had nothing to do with it. 17 we talked about the product, itself, what 18 they created, what they knew they were doing to 19 folks. 20 1963: moreover, nicotine is addictive. 21 we are, then, in the business of selling 22 nicotine, an addictive drug, effective in the 23 release of stress mechanisms. 24 1972: for the typical smoker, nicotine 25 satisfaction is the dominant desire. therefore, in designing any cigarette product, 2 the dominant specification should be nicotine 3 delivery. 4 they knew exactly what they were doing to 5 the public. they knew what they were doing to 6 kids and teenagers. they knew that their 7 business were high school kids, and that that is 8 when they were starting, and this is why they 9 were smoking. this is what was creating their 10 need to continue to smoke. 11 1972: the tobacco -- tobacco products 12 can contain and deliver nicotine, a potent 13 drug, with a variety of physiological effects. 14 our industry is based upon design, manufacture 15 and sale of attractive dosage forms of 16 nicotine. we provide a product that is an 17 essential commodity and a habitual act. put a 18 hungry rat in a cage, put a lever in the cage, 19 the rat will push the lever. smoking the 20 cigarette is the lever push. 21 they knew exactly what they were doing. 22 they knew the impact that this had on people's 23 brains. they studied it better than anybody. 24 they knew more than anybody about their 25 product, what it was doing to people, both on an addiction level and on a health level. 2 and we know from their own records that 3 addiction is not a choice that these folks are 4 making. it is not what they are setting 5 themselves out for. they are not setting 6 themselves out to become addicted, they are not 7 setting themselves out to die from a 8 smoking-related disease, one out of two. who 9 would do that? who would choose to do that? 10 the absorption through nicotine -- of 11 nicotine through lungs is as quick as the 12 junkie's fix. in 20 to 30 minutes after the 13 smoker has finished his cigarette, most of the 14 nicotine has left, and this is just about the 15 time that the heavily dependent smoker needs 16 his next cigarette. 17 1980, they addressed this very issue. 18 cigarette smoking is more addictive than using 19 heroin, hooking two-thirds of the people who 20 ever smoke. 21 then they go on to say: we cannot defend 22 continued smoking as free choice if the person 23 was addicted. 24 they know that it is not a choice that 25 these people are making. it is a reaction to the product that they are giving them. it is a 2 reaction to their engineering, to the 3 specifications that they put into it. 4 the desired specification is addiction, 5 through the appropriate dosing of nicotine, 6 inhaled so it gets as fast to the brain as 7 humanly possible. 8 9 10 follows:) 11 voice: our nation has mobilized enormous 12 resources -- 13 (video clip paused.) 14 ms. baker: excuse me. can we approach? 15 (the following discussion was held at 16 sidebar:) 17 the court: yes, ma'am? 18 ms. baker: i apologize, and i apologize 19 to interrupt. i thought that your honor had 20 sustained my objection to the schematic at the 21 bottom of that slide. 22 the court: no, ma'am. i overruled it. 23 ms. baker: that was from the '94 surgeon 24 general's report. 25 the court: i overruled it. ms. baker: okay. i'm sorry. 2 the court: no problem. 3 (sidebar discussion was concluded, and the 4 following was held in open court:) 5 6 7 follows:) 8 voice: our nation has mobilized enormous 9 resources to wage a war on drugs, illicit 10 drugs. we should also give priority to the one 11 addiction, tobacco addiction, that is killing 12 more than 300,000 americans each year. 13 (video clip concluded.) 14 mr. mcpharlin: so we talked about this 15 with dr. villa, and he explained to you the 16 mechanism and the process, the exposure, that 17 continued exposure. 18 and there is no question that that 19 continued exposure, 20, 40 times a day, 20 hundreds of times a day, thousands of times a 21 week, tens of thousands of times a year, 22 hundreds of thousands of times over a lifetime, 23 they are not doing it because of choice. 24 they are not choosing to get lung cancer. 25 they are not choosing to get carcinogens into their -- deep into their lungs. that is not 2 what they are choosing to do. 3 you heard dr. kaplan recognize, when 4 asked -- many years ago, of course -- what is 5 your definition of "addiction"? 6 well, most clinicians use the 1988 7 surgeon general report. and most clinicians 8 use, and i would use it, as the definition of 9 "addiction" -- 10 he changed his testimony in trial, but 11 what he said was, that definition was 12 persistent daily use -- 13 the primary features of his definition of 14 "addiction" back in 2002 were persistent daily 15 use, time to first cigarette, amount smoked per 16 day. right? 17 i'll get it right for you. but you 18 remember that. 19 persistent use, compulsive use, 20 drug-reinforcing behavior, psychoactive 21 effects, right? psychoactive effects, 22 drug-reinforcing behavior, compulsive use. 23 he changed his testimony about what 24 compulsive use was. it used to be he would say 25 compulsive use is smoking cigarettes multiple times a day, every day. 2 nicotine, by its nature, produces 3 psychoactive effects. and he did admit lillian 4 exhibited drug-reinforcing behavior. 5 so, by his own admission, by a definition 6 that he thought was perfectly fine a few years 7 ago, she would fit that criteria, she would be 8 addicted by the surgeon general's definition of 9 "addiction." 10 and dr. cummings told you that the clear 11 medical consensus is that nicotine addiction is 12 the fundamental reason that people continue to 13 use cigarettes. the fundamental reason. not 14 part of it, not some of it; the fundamental 15 reason. 16 and you heard only from dr. kaplan 17 something different. if that was not the 18 medical consensus that we have formed today and 19 over the last many years, you would have heard 20 it. 21 now, i'm not going to go through these 22 again. dr. cummings talked in detail. he 23 talked to you about the heaviness of smoking 24 index, how significant -- how validated and 25 reliable it is, and what those indications are to somebody who -- how heavily addicted they 2 are, how hard it will be for them to quit. 3 lillian scored high dependence on the 4 heaviness of smoking. 5 he took her through the fagerstrom, which 6 is a validated measure of how addicted somebody 7 is. and it is only for persistent daily users. 8 it is only for persistent daily users. 9 they are trying to make it sound like 10 anybody who ever smoked a cigarette would be 11 addicted under this. well, that is just not how 12 it is applied. that is completely misleading. 13 it is applied to persistent daily users. 14 and then, once you have that, okay, let us go 15 through it. lillian was heavily addicted, 16 severely, under that measure, validated 17 measure. 18 even with the dsm, if we took her through 19 the dsm, dr. kaplan's subjective use of the 20 dsm, who could possibly meet his criteria? 21 you would have to have a cognitive 22 disorder like dementia or psychosis, a serious 23 psychiatric condition like psychosis, in order 24 for you to meet his interpretation of the dsm. 25 and it is plain english, but he will not admit it. a maladaptive pattern of substance 2 abuse leading to clinically significant 3 impairment or distress as manifested by three 4 or more. that was the dsm-iv. 5 the same question for the dsm-5: as 6 manifested by two or more of the following. 7 he does admit that, according to the 8 dsm-iv, 80 to ninety percent of regular smokers 9 have nicotine dependence. somehow lillian is 10 that rare exception. 11 ninety-five percent of regular smokers 12 started as teens. classic signs of withdrawal, 13 all of what we saw with lillian. 14 and he also admitted that you do not even 15 use -- you are not even supposed to use the dsm 16 for somebody who is not currently using the 17 substance. 18 without the chemical compound, the 19 cigarette market would collapse. pm would 20 collapse, we would all lose our jobs and our 21 consulting fees. we cannot ever be comfortable 22 selling a product which most of our customers 23 would stop using if they could. 24 this is from r.j. reynolds. 25 that is to say, if the exit gate from our market should suddenly open, we could be out of 2 business almost overnight. 3 most who have smoked for any significant 4 time would like to stop. we know lillian did. 5 we know she wanted to. 6 many, but not most, of those who would 7 like to stop smoking are able to do so. that is 8 what they said. that is what they recognized in 9 their own research. 10 however, we cannot ever be comfortable 11 selling a product which most of our customers 12 would stop using if they could. 13 so addiction is a legal cause, a cause of 14 her continued smoking, a cause of her continued 15 exposure to the carcinogens and toxins in their 16 cigarettes that led to her copd. 17 this question is not about -- it is not 18 about fault. fault will come later. it is not 19 about whether addicts can quit. even 20 dr. kaplan admitted that heavy addicts can 21 quit. 22 it is not about reliance, it is not about 23 responsibility. it is about addiction, and did 24 that addiction contribute to her developing her 25 disease. and, so, clearly -- i'm going to move 2 through it quick -- the answer to question 1 is 3 "yes." more likely than not, was she addicted? 4 more likely than not, did that addiction 5 contribute to her continued smoking? yes. 6 dr. kaplan would have you believe that 7 nobody smokes -- go to 156 -- because of 8 addiction. that is who they brought in. that is 9 who their expert was. that is their rebuttal to 10 all of the science, their own business records, 11 their own knowledge, dr. kaplan, who does not 12 think anybody smokes at all, even a little bit, 13 because of addiction. 14 so the very simple answer, was she 15 addicted, did that addiction contribute to her 16 disease? yes. 17 now, the next thing i have to talk to you 18 about is statute of limitations. and their 19 defense is that lillian knew or should have 20 known that she had chronic obstructive 21 pulmonary disease. that is their defense. 22 that is their burden, not ours. it is theirs. 23 they have to prove to you that she had 24 copd before may of 1990, and that she knew or 25 should have known that she had copd. not did she have a cough, not did she have a smoker's 2 cough. that is not the standard, that is not 3 what they have to prove. they have to prove 4 that she knew or should have known she had it, 5 had copd. 6 now, we know -- 7 this admission was read to you: admit 8 that r.j. reynolds tobacco company is not in 9 possession of any medical records indicating 10 that lillian kaplan was diagnosed with copd 11 prior to may 5th, 1990. 12 response: reynolds admits that it is not 13 in possession of medical records indicating 14 that lillian kaplan was diagnosed with copd 15 prior to may 5th, 1990. 16 there is no evidence of it. zero. 17 you heard from dr. weiner. aside from 18 the coughing, and aside from the cough -- 19 this is arthur, rather. i'm sorry. 20 aside from the coughing, did you ever 21 notice your mother having any breathing 22 difficulties? 23 coughing from cigarettes can sometimes -- 24 you can catch -- you cannot catch your breath. 25 that is it. that is it. a cough, and nothing more. 2 lillian was asked: do you recall any 3 relatives ever being diagnosed with emphysema? 4 no. 5 what about copd? 6 no. 7 talked about her husband, what she found 8 on his death certificate. 9 she never had a pulmonary function test. 10 dr. weiner is the one who gave her her first 11 pulmonary function test. 12 how soon after florida -- moving to 13 florida? 14 about two years. 15 did you experience difficulty breathing 16 when you lived in new york? 17 no. 18 there is no evidence that she did. 19 short of breath in the '90s. there is no 20 evidence that she was short of breath before 21 that. 22 she bowled in new york. she was active, 23 did what she wanted. there is no evidence that 24 she was limited in any way, shape or form. 25 they told you that she believed her sister died from -- her lung cancer was caused 2 by smoking. that is not what her testimony was. 3 her testimony was that she did not believe it 4 was caused by smoking. 5 all right. so here's dr. kaplan. 6 dr. kaplan was asked: you were asked about 7 factor number 9 in the dsm-iv, which is, 8 essentially, smoking in the face of a known 9 risk; correct? 10 and you gave -- you did not give 11 mrs. kaplan that one because when she went to 12 the doctor, she was told about her copd and she 13 stopped at that time; right? 14 correct. not -- not just the known 15 risks, but the person believes that they have a 16 medical or psychological problem as a 17 consequence of the substance. and the first 18 time that she believed that was when she saw 19 dr. weiner, he tells her -- he tells her, she 20 stopped. so she would not fulfill that. 21 the first time she believed was when she 22 saw dr. weiner. that is from their own expert. 23 he read her medical records, he read all the 24 depositions. you saw the long list. 25 he spent $55,000 preparing to talk to you folks. and his testimony is she did not believe 2 it or know it until dr. weiner told her. 3 so, from 12 years old, up until 1994, 4 it is your opinion that she did not continue 5 smoking believing it was causing her any harm 6 or could potentially cause her harm; correct? 7 no. she -- that is a different question. 8 she shared with me -- when i asked her about 9 the risk of harm, she shared with me multiple 10 things. she shared with me that she knew about 11 the surgeon general's warning. she thought 12 it -- she thought, since the '70s, she knew it 13 could be dangerous, she knew about the films 14 and newspaper and other things, so she knew it 15 could be harmful; but in terms of her smoking, 16 knowing that she had a medical problem from 17 smoke, no. 18 that evidence is very clear. she sees a 19 doctor, the doctor says, you have got serious 20 lung problems, you need to stop smoking. boom, 21 right in the office, she throws her cigarettes 22 out. 23 so when she found out she had a physical 24 problem related to tobacco use, she stopped on 25 that day. so, in your opinion, she did not know she 2 had a medical condition prior to that time? 3 correct. that was caused by smoking. 4 dr. keller: he admits that there is no 5 evidence that she had dyspnea on exertion 6 before 1990. correct? 7 answer: yes. 8 no evidence of shortness of breath before 9 1990? 10 correct. 11 no history of sputum production as it 12 relates to lillian. 13 and he says: no, no, not true. 14 according to the testimony of her son, she did 15 have sputum production. 16 that is not what he said. so he is wrong 17 about that. 18 he did not use the word "sputum?" 19 no. 20 no record during the entire time that she 21 was seeing dr. doben, from '91 to '93, in that 22 time frame, no record said she was diagnosed 23 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 24 true? 25 and here's something interesting from dr. keller. i'm going to speed through this. 2 all right. what i can tell you is, from 3 treating thousands of patients with copd, that 4 that is the paramount symptom in someone with 5 copd; and it is very clear, when you read the 6 doctor's notes from those patients, dyspnea is 7 always there. it is always there. it is a 8 chronic symptom, it is gradually progressive, 9 and you cannot even entertain a diagnosis of 10 copd on someone who does not have exertion 11 dyspnea. did i read that correctly? 12 answer: yes. 13 there was no evidence that anybody 14 noticed shortness of breath before 1990? 15 yes. 16 so there is no dyspnea? 17 nothing, zero. 18 all right. and, so, this is what you 19 were told. you got a pretty long instruction 20 on this, and one of the things that the judge 21 told you is: defendant need not prove that 22 lillian was actually diagnosed with copd before 23 may 1990 in order to prevail on that defense. 24 we agree. 25 for purposes of this defense, the critical event is not when her copd was 2 actually diagnosed by a physician, but when her 3 copd first manifested itself. a disease 4 manifests itself when it becomes diagnosable 5 through evaluation of the plaintiff -- 6 patient's symptoms. 7 paramount to the diagnosis is dyspnea. 8 she never had it. even he admits that there is 9 no way that she could have been diagnosable 10 prior to may of 1990. 11 when it becomes diagnosable through 12 evaluation of a patient's symptoms. and she 13 did not have the paramount one that he said she 14 needed. 15 dr. weiner said it, too. cough is 16 probably the hardest diagnosis for me to figure 17 out when they come in to see me in the office, 18 because there are so many different things that 19 can result in cough. 20 and, so, when you are asked -- 21 when you get to that section, question 2, 22 did she know or reasonably have known, even 23 their own expert says she could not have known. 24 could not have known, did not know. not maybe 25 she knew; she did not know. the answer to that has to be "no." has 2 to be "no." 3 now -- 4 yeah, that is true. 5 and dr. keller said -- and just use your 6 memory on this one -- he talked about 7 dr. doben, and he talked about how he did not 8 blame dr. doben for not diagnosing her because 9 dr. doben was not a specialist like dr. keller 10 is. and specialists do not have the training 11 and techniques in order to be able to discern 12 that stuff. 13 so it was not dr. doben's fault that he 14 did not know she had copd before dr. weiner 15 diagnosed her. that is what dr. keller said. 16 now, the next question you are going to 17 get to is apportionment of fault, and you are 18 going to have to decide how much r.j. reynolds 19 is responsible for -- 20 remember, it is not just r.j. reynolds. 21 it is r.j. reynolds, brown & williamson, 22 american tobacco, lorillard. that is all 23 r.j. reynolds. it is all of their conduct, all 24 of their knowledge, versus lillian; right? 25 that is what you have to decide. now, this section does not apply to the 2 intentional wrongs that r.j. reynolds 3 committed, and so this apportionment of fault 4 only applies to the negligence claims. 5 if you decide that they did something 6 intentional, the court, as he told you, will 7 not reduce your award by this percentage. but 8 it is still something you have to fill out, it is 9 still something you have to figure out amongst 10 yourselves, and use your best judgment and your 11 common sense as to who is more at fault. 12 who is significantly more at fault here, 13 the company that manufactured the product, or 14 the 12-year-old who started, or the 17-year-old 15 who started, or the lady who -- the mom who was 16 smoking 25 years before the first warning went 17 on, the warning that they fought, that they 18 never gave her before that, and that they 19 continued to deny after that? 20 reynolds placed cigarettes that were 21 unreasonably dangerous and defective on the 22 market. that is a finding that you have to 23 accept and you have to follow. it is the 24 finding of the engle jury they were negligent. 25 once you get past question 2, you apply all of those findings, and then you answer 2 question 3 with all of those findings in mind. 3 that is lillian, as you know, 12 years 4 old. this is the one that they are saying today 5 should have known everything that she needed to 6 know about cigarette smoking. twelve years 7 old, 17 years old. 8 dr. kaplan thinks that she is just as 9 mature as an adult at 12, lillian kaplan was. 10 that is what dr. kaplan said. 11 they misled the public about filters, 12 they gave the public a crutch, they gave the 13 public an excuse. forget about the things that 14 they said, the lie -- just the direct lies that 15 they gave -- they made. 16 they -- they marketed and advertised a 17 product that made people think you could 18 continue doing this without the possibilities, 19 without the potentials that these other folks 20 are saying they are. but they are not. but 21 smoke these, because this is what it will do 22 for you. 23 the industry does not believe there are 24 any bad elements. if there are any bad 25 elements, they will be removed. we say, here is our triple, quadruple, quintuple filter, 2 capable of removing whatever constituents of 3 smoke is currently suspect, while delivering 4 the full flavor and, incidentally, a nice jolt 5 of nicotine. and if we are the first to be 6 able to make and sustain that claim, what price 7 kent? 8 this is reynolds at the top here, too: 9 in most cases, however, the smoker of a 10 filtered cigarette was getting as much or more 11 nicotine and tar than she would have gotten 12 from a regular cigarette. she had abandoned 13 the regular cigarette, however, on the grounds 14 of reduced risk to health. 15 the illusion of filtration. as we know, 16 all too often, the smoker who switches to a 17 hi-fi cigarette winds up smoking more units in 18 order to provide himself with the same delivery 19 which he had. 20 there is no way that lillian kaplan knew 21 that. there is no way that she knew that the 22 claims that they were making were totally 23 false. there is absolutely no way she could 24 have known that. they withheld that. they did 25 it intentionally. they used ingredients in their products 2 to affect the delivery of nicotine for one 3 reason and one reason only, as you saw by their 4 own business records: to affect their sales. 5 why? because they are addicting people. 6 ammonia, in their secret documents, on 7 their list, on their website. ammonia. 8 they used flu-curing to make them 9 inhalable. they put in additives to manipulate 10 nicotine delivery. they used bronchodilators 11 to open up their lungs. 12 flavorings, leaf blending, ammoniation, 13 freebasing nicotine. that is what r.j. reynolds 14 did. 15 16 17 follows:) 18 voice: truck driver, dennis gaines, a 19 grandfather, says he is been smoking for 30 20 years and is still not convinced cigarettes are 21 dangerous. 22 voice: you know they say it causes 23 cancer and heart disease. do you believe that? 24 voice: no, i do not. not -- not in my 25 heart, i cannot believe it. i look back at the peoples that make the cigarettes and i feel 2 like that the one that make the cigarettes 3 should know what they are doing. 4 (video clip concluded.) 5 mr. mcpharlin: the ones that make the 6 cigarettes should know what they are doing. 7 that is what they told the public: we 8 know what we are doing, we know exactly what 9 we are doing, we know what we are selling, 10 there is no proof it causes harm. 11 despite their novel invention, filters, 12 lung cancer deaths continued to rise, 13 skyrocket. filters are going up. here we see 14 the jump increasing. it dips a little bit and 15 then it continues to go up. why? because of 16 filters. 17 ninety-five percent of the market is 18 quickly all filters. why? because of the way 19 they were advertising them, because of the way 20 that they were informing the public about 21 their -- about their efficiency, about their 22 effectiveness. 23 so when you are talking about a company 24 versus a 12-year-old, a 17-year-old, a young 25 mom, somebody just trying to get through life, somebody just trying to raise their kids, 2 who -- what are we comparing? 3 that is what you are comparing: 4 r.j. reynolds, american tobacco, brown & 5 williamson, lorillard tobacco, to lillian 6 kaplan, to lilly. 7 now, the next thing i'm going to talk to 8 you about is lung cancer. what caused her lung 9 cancer? 10 again, it is something we have to prove, 11 so we brought in dr. villa. 12 does each dose of those years -- do each 13 of those years substantially -- of her 14 cigarette smoking, do each of those years 15 substantially contribute to the development of 16 her lung cancer? 17 absolutely. 18 he testified, unequivocally, that the 19 years that she smoked, all of those years, the 20 years that she smoked kent, barclay, winston, 21 carlton, lucky strikes, camel, all 22 substantially contributed to the development of 23 her lung cancer. 24 their own expert, dr. bishopric, who is 25 board certified in internal medicine, went to medical school, it was her opinion that 2 cigarette smoking was the cause of lillian's 3 lung cancer. 4 dr. villa talked to you about -- i mean, 5 just the likelihood that it was not from 6 smoking. he talked about the percentages of 7 adenocarcinomas. you heard about the 8 percentage of adenocarcinoma increased as a 9 result of filters. she was obviously a 10 filtered cigarette smoker. 11 she had adenocarcinoma. dr. villa took 12 you through that very specifically. he even 13 talked to you about, when you look at 14 populations of women who smoke over a certain 15 number of years -- 16 we talked about 40 years. 17 so i asked him: that population of women 18 who develop lung cancer, what is the percentage 19 of that population that their lung cancer is 20 caused by smoking? 21 ninety-seven percent. 22 ninety-seven percent. 23 are we to believe that lillian kaplan is 24 somehow in that three percent? what is more 25 likely than not? remember, what is more likely than not? that she is in the three percent or 2 the 97 percent? that her cigarette smoking 3 caused her lung cancer, like dr. bishopric 4 said, and like dr. villa said? 5 and the only thing contrary you have from 6 them is dr. keller, who just simply said, i 7 do not know. he is not a pathologist, he is not 8 an oncologist. his opinion was, i do not know. 9 that does not rebut, that does not negate the 10 evidence that you have. there is no evidence to 11 the contrary, that her cigarette smoking did 12 not cause her lung cancer. 13 and, so, i think the evidence is 14 overwhelming. it is certainly more likely than 15 not, and it far exceeds that. that, yes, her 16 smoking cigarettes, manufactured by 17 r.j. reynolds and all of the companies that 18 they are responsible for, substantially 19 contributed to the cause -- it was a cause of 20 her lung cancer. 21 as he told you, i have a limited amount 22 of time. i have two opportunities to speak to 23 you, and i'm sorry if i'm going too fast. i'm 24 sure you want me to finish. and i do have a 25 time limit, so i will finish. i have to talk about damages, and i have 2 to talk about them in two different ways, 3 because you have two questions on the verdict 4 form -- two different sets of questions on the 5 verdict form which apply to damages. 6 i do not think there is any question as to 7 what your answer needs to be as far as what 8 damages you would look at, lung cancer causing 9 her death, but let me talk about lillian for a 10 moment as it relates to her copd and her lung 11 cancer, and then i'll talk about her death. 12 she was diagnosed in 1994. she was put 13 on oxygen. she was routinely diagnosed with 14 severe air flow limitation. severe air flow 15 limitation. she was routinely, at one point, 16 placed on oxygen. 17 she talked to you about how limited her 18 life was. that is not how her life was supposed 19 to be. that is not the life that she expected, 20 it is not the life she set out for, but it is 21 certainly not the life she knew she was going 22 to get when she was 12 years old, 17 years old. 23 but that is the life that she had, and 24 that is what you have to consider in determining 25 what her damages are, what amount of money is going to be commensurate with the injury, how 2 to compensate for that injury. 3 and, so, for 18 years -- sorry -- 18 4 years, she lived with her copd, the limitations 5 that it brought with it, the doctor visits. 6 how many times did she go to the doctor? 7 all of the medications, the emergency inhalers, 8 the oxygen tanks. embarrassing as it was, she 9 did not want to bring her oxygen with her. she 10 was an independent, strong lady, who did not 11 want to be dragging around her oxygen tanks. 12 it limited what she was able to do, it 13 limited her interactions with her family. if 14 dr. keller does not think that that is a 15 limitation, he is in the wrong business. what is 16 he doing taking care of folks like that? 17 severe. very limited. affected 18 everything about her life. she talked to you 19 about that. when she would clean her house, 20 she would have to stop making her bed, take her 21 inhaler, use her oxygen. 22 well, they asked her, well, you have a 23 dishwasher, do not you? 24 yeah, i have a dishwasher. 25 it affected every aspect of her life. her life mattered to her, mattered to 2 sharon, mattered to her friends, people in her 3 community. it clearly -- 4 from all the evidence that you have seen in 5 this case, from the 1940s up until they were 6 raising their hand, swearing to god to tell the 7 truth in 1994, it is clear that her life did 8 not matter to them, but her life mattered to a 9 lot of people, and specifically to her daughter 10 sharon. 11 now, r.j. reynolds can judge their 12 relationship, if they want to, but lillian 13 kaplan was an independent lady who wanted to 14 try to do for herself, who did not want to be a 15 burden on her daughter, even though her 16 daughter did not think of her that way, but 17 that is how lillian wanted to be. and if they 18 want to judge her for their relationship, i 19 do not even see how that is possible. 20 but her life mattered to sharon. she 21 lost her mom. they were very close. the 22 evidence is clear. there is no evidence to the 23 contrary. they were friends, they were family, 24 and her life mattered to her. 25 and, so, what reynolds did, what they did over all of those years, was wrong. what they 2 did to millions -- tens of millions of people 3 like her was wrong. 4 mr. kaczynski: objection, your honor. 5 the court: overruled. 6 mr. mcpharlin: and you have to decide 7 how to compensate. and i know that is 8 difficult. you have the medical bills. 9 227,000, that is the stipulated amount for her 10 medical bills. 11 based on her relationship with her 12 daughter, i think the appropriate amount is 13 $4 million. 14 if you decide that her death was caused 15 by smoking, she died from lung cancer, it is 16 obviously a wrongful death case and you have to 17 decide how much money are we going to include 18 in our verdict for that -- for those harms, to 19 compensate for all of those harms, for the life 20 that she would have continued to live with her, 21 the life that they would have continued to have 22 together, $4 million. 23 if you decide that it is not a wrongful 24 death case and that you have to compensate 25 lillian for those 18 years, for that 18-year period of time, for her copd and her lung 2 cancer, i think the appropriate amount is 3 $8 million for that period of time. 4 now, lillian had the right to have all of 5 the facts. she had the right to have the 6 truth. she had the right to know what their 7 product was, what they were doing to it, how 8 addictive it was, and how truly harmful it was. 9 that was her right when she was a child, 10 when she was a teenager, when she was a young 11 adult, for the rest of her life. that was what 12 they owed her. they had that responsibility to 13 her and millions of other people like her. 14 and what they chose to do with that 15 responsibility, the responsibility that they 16 had to the public, to their consumers, to the 17 promises that they made to the public, to 18 public health, was concealed. it is not 19 something that they can dispute anymore. 20 they cannot dispute that they concealed 21 what they knew about cigarettes, that they 22 concealed what they knew about how addictive 23 and how harmful their product was. 24 and you heard all of the evidence, you 25 saw what they did, in order to get to that, in order to do that, in order to execute that 2 strategy. 3 did lillian kaplan reasonably rely on any 4 concealment or omission of material information 5 by r.j. reynolds, concerning the health effects 6 of cigarettes or their addictive nature; and, 7 if such -- if so, was such reliance a legal 8 cause of her loss, injury or damage? 9 and, remember, a legal cause. it does not 10 have to be the only thing that she relied on, 11 it does not have to be the only thing that 12 caused her to rely on what they did. it is a 13 legal cause, their concealment. 14 and did they conceal? of course, they 15 did. they told the world that there was 16 nothing wrong with our product. 17 you heard her. she remembers a company 18 saying there is nothing wrong, it is okay, it is 19 safe to smoke. because that is what they did. 20 that is what they told the public for decades. 21 did lillian kaplan reasonably rely on any 22 act or omission taken by r.j. reynolds in 23 furtherance of an agreement between the other 24 tobacco companies or organizations to conceal 25 or omit material information concerning the health effects or the addictive nature of 2 smoking cigarettes; and, if so, was such 3 reliance a legal cause? 4 again, as i told you, reynolds is 5 responsible for the acts of all of the 6 co-conspirators. philip morris -- 7 and you heard, why are we seeing all 8 these documents? because they are part of the 9 conspiracy. philip morris, liggett & myers, 10 the ti, the tirc, they were all part of it. 11 they are all primary players in it. they were 12 all in it together for one purpose: protect 13 their profits. 14 they concealed that they formed a 15 conspiracy. obviously, lillian did not know 16 that. she did not know that what they were 17 doing was a big fraud, a big public relations 18 front. 19 she did not know that they hired 20 scientists and doctors to mislead the public. 21 she did not know that they were researching and 22 studying nicotine to figure out how they could 23 deliver it faster, to figure out how they could 24 deliver the right amount to make sure that they 25 created and sustained addiction. she did not know that one out of two people were going to 2 die. 3 she did not know they manipulated 4 nicotine, that there were 70 cancer-causing 5 agents in every puff that she inhaled. 6 arsenic, cyanide. 7 she did not know filtered cigarettes were 8 no safer and likely more harmful. 9 she did not know that r.j. reynolds and 10 their conspirators purposely misled the public 11 about the safety of filters and low-tar 12 cigarettes. she did not know any of that. that 13 was all part of their game. that was all part 14 of their strategy. 15 she did not know they met at the hotel and 16 devised this scheme to mislead the public. 17 is not it fortunate for us that cigarettes 18 are a habit they cannot break? boy, would not it 19 be wonderful if our company was the first to 20 produce a cancer-free cigarette? 21 that is 1953. 22 they produced this frank statement, 23 interest in people's health as a basic 24 responsibility paramount to every consideration 25 in our business. totally not true. a complete false 2 statement. it was a litigation strategy 3 perpetuated by a public relations campaign. no 4 doubt or confusion. internally, they knew what 5 they were doing. they knew they were 6 addicting, they knew they were killing people. 7 the individuals we met believe that 8 smoking causes lung cancer. that is 1958. 9 that is an internal document. they knew, 10 without a doubt, by 1958, that their cigarettes 11 were causing lung cancer. they knew it before. 12 they were studying, they were following 13 everything; and while they are following these 14 studies, they are putting out advertising, more 15 doctors smoke camels, dentists, nurses. 16 they are playing on every feeling, every concept 17 that is going to convince people that it is okay, 18 it is safe to smoke. 19 carcinogens are found in every -- 20 practically every class of compound in smoke. 21 the amount of evidence accumulated to indict 22 the cigarette smoke as a health hazard is 23 overwhelming. the evidence challenging such an 24 indictment is scant. that is r.j. reynolds, 25 1962. this is brown & williamson, 2 r.j. reynolds, 1963: cigarettes have certain 3 unattractive side effects. they cause lung 4 cancer. 5 lillian kaplan did not know they knew 6 this. they withheld that from her. they cannot 7 come in today and say, she did not rely on 8 anything. she smoked their products for 9 decades without this information. 10 they created an atmosphere, a wallpaper 11 of acceptability, that it is okay, it is 12 glamorous, it is no problem. 13 the court: five minutes, counsel. 14 mr. mcpharlin: yes, sir. 15 if this committee had not been formed, 16 the cigarette industry would by now have been 17 in a deplorable position. 18 so that is the -- that is the entity -- 19 remember the tirc? that is what they did. 20 they created an organization to perpetuate 21 their public relations campaign. not to do 22 science, not to save the public, not to answer 23 the question. a public relations campaign. 24 give smokers a psychological crutch and a 25 self-rationale to continue smoking. that is exactly what they did with their advertising, 2 with their public statements, with their 3 withholding information, concealing what they 4 knew. 5 filters, doubt is our product. lillian 6 kaplan did not know that. 7 the most important story is that which 8 casts doubt on the cause-and-effect theory of 9 diseases and -- effect theory of disease and 10 smoking. for example, a report indicating some 11 factor or factors other than smoking may be 12 involved. 13 14 15 follows:) 16 voice: we want to be the detectives just 17 as much as the surgeon general and the ama, and 18 we will cooperate in every way. 19 voice: well, obviously, a filter takes 20 out certain tar and nicotine. i do not think 21 the industry admits there are any bad elements. 22 if there are bad elements, through our 23 laboratories, through the surgeon generals, 24 through the ama, through acts of god and luck, 25 we hope we may find them. and if they are found, they will be removed. 2 voice: we -- we do talk to the question 3 of whether or not cigarettes are hazardous. we 4 do not believe that cigarettes are hazardous. 5 we do not accept that, because when, as and if 6 any ingredient in cigarette smoke is identified 7 as being injurious to human health, we are 8 confident that we can eliminate that 9 ingredient. 10 voice: do you believe that cigarettes 11 are safe? have they been proven to be safe, 12 mr. cullman? 13 voice: i believe they have not been 14 proven to be unsafe. 15 (video clip concluded.) 16 mr. mcpharlin: lillian was asked in her 17 deposition about quitting and about how she 18 thought she had done over the times that she 19 tried to quit. and she said, if i knew then 20 what i know now... if she knew then what she 21 knew now. 22 there is no question they concealed from 23 her. there is no question that she relied on 24 it. the law -- 25 there is no instruction in there that says we have to show she relied on this 2 statement or that statement. we have shown you 3 what they did, we have shown you their 4 advertising, their marketing. we have shown you 5 what their own witnesses say that was designed 6 to do. it was designed to get the public to 7 rely on what we were saying. and that is what 8 happened. 9 more likely than not, was what they were 10 doing over decades, did it have an impact on 11 her? more likely than not. 12 for 20 years, the industry has employed a 13 single strategy to defend itself on three major 14 fronts: litigation, politics and public 15 opinion. while the strategy was brilliantly 16 conceived and executed over the years, helping 17 us win important battles -- "win important 18 battles," it should say -- it is only fair to 19 say that it is not, nor was it intended to be a 20 vehicle for victory. on the contrary, it has 21 always been a holding strategy, consisting of 22 creating doubt about the health charge, without 23 actually denying it. 24 the tirc, the ctr was an industry shield. 25 special projects are the best way for -- that monies are spent. the ctr has acted as a 2 front. ctr is the best and cheapest insurance 3 for the tobacco industry. 4 in the cigarette controversy, the public, 5 especially those who are present and potential 6 supporters, must perceive and understand and 7 believe in evidence to sustain their opinions 8 that smoking may not be the causal factor. 9 10 11 follows:) 12 voice: take the controversy about 13 cigarettes. in the 91st congress, a house 14 committee heard testimony from leading experts 15 on smoking and health. the record shows that 16 many of the country's most respected doctors 17 openly challenged anti-cigarette claims. 18 voice: turning a significant health 19 question into a publicity stunt is an insult to 20 serious science. 21 voice: and i have to disagree with you, 22 in that we do not know what causes the ailments 23 that have been attributed to cigarette smoking. 24 voice: cigarette smoking does not cause 25 cancer, "yes" or "no"? voice: it is not known whether 2 cigarettes cause cancer. 3 voice: all right, sir. 4 voice: it has not been causally 5 established. 6 voice: cigarette smoking -- 7 no causal relationship between cigarette 8 smoking and emphysema? 9 voice: despite all of the research to 10 date, there has been no causal link 11 established. 12 voice: the case is still open. the jury 13 has not come in. 14 voice: it may not be harmful? you are 15 not convinced? 16 voice: it may be or it may not be. we 17 do not know. 18 voice: i am saying that the science to 19 date, and over $100 million of our industry, 20 indicates that there is no causal link. 21 voice: they agree that smoking causes 22 lung cancer. do you agree? 23 voice: it may. 24 voice: do you know whether it does? 25 voice: i do not. voice: we do not know what causes cancer 2 in general right now, so i think that we may 3 find out what causes cancer and we may find out 4 some relationship which has yet to be proven. 5 (video clip concluded.) 6 7 8 follows:) 9 q. and they wanted people to be able to 10 believe that and rely upon that, did they not? 11 a. i believe, in general, yes. 12 q. and as late as '88 or '89 or '90, the 13 tobacco institute was saying they still did not know 14 whether smoking caused cancer, correct? 15 that is what they were telling the public, 16 correct? 17 a. they did not know that, they could not 18 make that determination, is what they said in the 19 video. 20 q. and they wanted the people to believe 21 them, correct? 22 a. i would say they would, yes. 23 (video clip concluded.) 24 mr. mcpharlin: that is r.j. reynolds' 25 corporate representative. it was -- the intent was for people to rely, and 2 they knew they were. their own research showed 3 that they were. 4 our basic position in the cigarette 5 controversy is subject to the charge, and 6 subject to a finding that we are making false 7 and misleading statements to promote the sale 8 of cigarettes. 9 of course they were. that is what they 10 knew, though. 1968. 11 they knew filters were doing nothing for 12 folks. nothing, zero. 13 cigarette manufacturers have deceived the 14 american public through their advertising of 15 filter-tip cigarettes. the american public 16 have paid a premium for filter cigarettes for, 17 quote, protection they did not receive. 18 from lorillard: kent was marketed as a 19 safer cigarette for smokers concerned about 20 smoking and health. 21 in 1956, when an innocent third party in 22 reader's digest created an awareness to the 23 consumer that kent was the safest of all 24 popular filter cigarettes, lorillard exploited 25 this advantage so that within a short period of two years, the kent volume grew from less than 2 four billion cigarettes to 38 billion. 3 they exploited so many things over so 4 many decades in so many different ways. that 5 was -- they were experts at exploiting. 6 this is on -- 7 this is brown & williamson. brand image 8 of carlton, lillian's last cigarette. 9 go ahead. 10 the carlton smokers are -- more freely 11 admit that they wish they did not smoke at all 12 than with any other brand. they are desperate, 13 trying to quit, or have not been able to quit 14 and they end up with those. 15 16 17 follows:) 18 q. people rely on advertisements. 19 otherwise, it would not make a difference whether you 20 were truthful or not, right? 21 a. i think people rely on advertising that 22 they see. 23 q. can you describe for me any circumstances 24 in which a corporation should withhold information 25 from consumers regarding the dangers of its products? a. no. 2 (video clip concluded.) 3 mr. mcpharlin: so when you get to 4 questions 4 and 5, based on their own 5 documents, based on their own research, based 6 on their own business records, they knew 7 consumers were relying. 8 lillian was one of their consumers. she 9 told you what she heard. she told you what she 10 knew and understood. she told you what she 11 believed about what they were saying about 12 their products. there is no evidence to the 13 contrary. 14 the answers to those questions, 4 and 5, 15 are "yes." and the reason those are important 16 is because you have to answer one of those 17 questions "yes" in order to get to the last 18 question, which is whether or not, under the 19 circumstances, by clear and convincing 20 evidence, punitive damages are warranted 21 against r.j. reynolds. 22 and based on everything that you have 23 heard, based on all of the evidence that you have 24 seen, there is no question that r.j. reynolds 25 should be punished for what they have done, for their reprehensible conduct, for the harm that 2 they have caused. there is no question that 3 the answer to that is "yes." 4 that requires phase ii, but i assure you, 5 phase ii will be very short. our case in 6 phase ii will be about an hour. 7 all right. so i'm going to sit down. 8 i've eaten up some of my time on the back end, 9 and i want to be able to have an opportunity to 10 talk to you when they are finished. 11 thank you for listening. 7 mr. mcpharlin: i am thick-skinned. i 8 do not have to like everything i hear. 9 it does not matter what he says, what 10 r.j. reynolds says in this courtroom. they 11 cannot change the past. mr. kaczynski told you 12 that after this trial you should search those 13 document websites. i agree one hundred percent. i 14 agree it should be a class. 15 it should be a class that is offered in 16 school, so people can see, so children can see 17 the despicable history that they put this 18 country through. i agree. kids, teenagers, 19 should be searching it for hours. 20 you know what would have been great? if 21 those documents that are now available -- and 22 believe me, you did not see all of them -- not 23 even close -- those documents that are now 24 available, they should have been available 25 decades ago. the truth in those business records 2 should have been available decades ago. i 3 heard about rewriting history. well, that is 4 exactly what you saw in front of you today; an 5 attempt to rewrite history. 6 mr. kaczynski: objection, your honor. 7 the court: ladies and gentlemen, you 8 rely on your own recollection of the evidence. 9 this is argument. proceed, counsel. 10 mr. mcpharlin: r.j. reynolds was a good, 11 responsible company. they did good things. 12 they were looking out for the public. 13 tobacco working group. they were 14 researching nicotine, from what we just heard, 15 because they were concerned about the health of 16 consumers. they were researching nicotine 17 because they were responding to the public 18 health community. 19 that is what you were just told. it 20 was not like we showed you in their documents 21 where they were just jealous of philip morris 22 and how well they were doing with kids, 23 teenagers, with marlboro, with ammonia. 24 no, mr. kaczynski just told you they were 25 researching nicotine because they were worried about the consumers. that is the rest of the 2 story that r.j. reynolds is telling in 2015. 3 what have they learned? what has r.j. reynolds 4 learned from their conduct, from being caught 5 doing what they did? 6 they do not acknowledge today that they have 7 done anything wrong. 8 mr. kaczynski: objection, your honor. 9 mr. mcpharlin: it is testimony, judge. 10 the court: counsel, objection sustained. 11 mr. mcpharlin: he talks about the master 12 settlement agreement. not one penny goes to 13 victims, not one penny. 14 he talks about all the money that they 15 put into it. but all that money is after all 16 their profits. you have not even heard how much 17 they make, after paying all of those things. 18 he talks about the tobacco working group, 19 another example of them looking out for the 20 public health. we showed you the documents. 21 it was intelligence-gathering. they did it so 22 they could keep an eye on the government. 23 we do not believe there is anything wrong 24 with our product. we do not believe that a 25 safer cigarette needs to be investigated, but we will participate. 2 and what do they see secretly? we will 3 work to influence what happens in those groups. 4 we can influence dr. gori, because we are paying 5 him a lot of money. dr. gori is worried -- 6 he is running the group. he is worried that 7 people are going to start giving him push-back 8 because he is so tied into the industry. 9 they said in their secret documents that 10 we can try to influence, we can keep an eye on 11 what they are doing. that is them looking out 12 for the public health? 13 he mentioned the green monster, bought 14 and paid for by the tobacco industry, authored 15 by two scientists who have been in their pocket 16 for decades before that. 17 he told you -- use your memory. but he 18 told you we do not, we do not go after kids. 19 we are not interested in children. 20 1533. this one is in. show this one. 21 preference-wise, camel and winston are shown as 22 holding their shares substantially constant, 23 while salem increased its share, especially 24 among high school students. this is in 1959. 25 they were desperate to get kids. desperate. talked about filters, another effort by 2 reynolds and the industry to look out for the 3 public health. that is what he told you. 4 this is from one of their head 5 scientists, dr. teague: while use of such 6 color change materials would probably have 7 little or no effect on the actual efficiency of 8 the filter tip material, the advertising and 9 sales advantages are obvious. 10 you can see where their hearts are. 11 they are really worried about people. 12 1958. i mean, this is just one good, 13 clear example. we showed you examples from 14 1953 of what they knew. 15 this is from 1958. caution: -- causation 16 of lung cancer. r.j. reynolds was at this 17 meeting. this was the industry getting 18 together. they are meeting, talking about, 19 because they were worried. they are not worried 20 about health, the sake of the public. they are 21 worried about their profits. 22 with one exception, hsn greene, the 23 individuals whom we met believed that smoking 24 causes lung cancer, if by causation we mean any 25 chain of events which leads finally to lung cancer and which involves smoking as an 2 indispensable link. 3 in the usa, only berkson apparently is 4 now prepared to doubt the statistical evidence, 5 and his reasoning is nowhere thought to be 6 sound. hueper of the national cancer institute 7 accepts that cigarette smoke is capable of 8 causing lung cancer, but believes that, as 9 compared with other environmental carcinogens, 10 the contribution of smoking to the total 11 mortality from lung cancer is being greatly 12 exaggerated. 13 if by causation we mean any chain of 14 events which leads finally to lung cancer. 15 he spent a little bit of time talking 16 about lillian kaplan. and... i'm glad i do 17 have thick skin. 18 mr. kaczynski: objection, your honor. 19 the court: overruled. 20 mr. mcpharlin: an 84-year-old, a million 21 dollars for the passing of an 84-year-old? her 22 name was lillian kaplan. her life mattered. 23 her life mattered to her family. her life 24 mattered to herself. it obviously did not 25 matter to r.j. reynolds. the fact that she was 84 means she lived 2 long enough, and it does not matter that we took 3 her life? 4 not debilitating. she was fine. who 5 wants to walk around with an oxygen bottle 6 strapped to their face? who wants to sleep on 7 oxygen every night? who wants to take 8 emergency inhalers because they cannot clean 9 their room, they cannot make their bed without 10 using an inhaler? 11 sounds great to me. sounds perfect. 12 sounds ideal. 13 mr. kaczynski told you that mr. johnston, 14 the ceo of r.j. reynolds, was just not given -- 15 not given an opportunity to speak his mind. he 16 just was not being treated fairly when he was 17 testifying before congress. 18 we know what was on his mind. we know 19 what he thought. we know what his scientists 20 thought. we know what the executives thought. 21 they all new their cigarettes caused cancer. 22 they all knew they were addictive. 23 he got up there, and he lied. he got up 24 there and he spun -- he tried to weasel out of 25 what he knew to be true. so he was given plenty of opportunity. they were given decades 2 to tell the truth. 3 showed you an interrogatory answer, 4 without telling you what the context was, 5 without telling you anything it meant. 6 lillian kaplan was not looking -- 7 video technician: elmo, please. 8 i'm sorry. 9 mr. mcpharlin: lillian kaplan was not 10 pursuing damages other than medical expenses. 11 do you believe that? that is what he told 12 you. 13 what are the injuries that you are 14 seeking compensation for in this lawsuit? i am 15 going to die from this. i have no other 16 alternatives, because i cannot get new lungs. 17 mr. kaczynski's rest of the story? 18 not the rest of the story. you are going 19 to -- on the verdict form, you are going to get 20 those questions. and you were told that the 21 engle findings, which another jury sat through 22 trial and determined and have been upheld by 23 the florida supreme court, made findings. 24 and you were told that those findings 25 do not mean anything to this case, do not mean anything to lillian kaplan. well, those 2 findings apply to lillian kaplan. once you get 3 past question 1, those findings apply. 4 and the engle findings tell you that the 5 defendant, r.j. reynolds, concealed or omitted 6 material information not otherwise known or 7 available, knowing that the material was false 8 or misleading or failed to disclose a material 9 fact concerning the health effects or addictive 10 nature of smoking cigarettes, or both. 11 that is what r.j. reynolds did. that 12 finding applies to that. 13 the defendants agreed with other 14 companies and industry organizations to conceal 15 or omit information regarding the health 16 effects of cigarettes or their addictive 17 nature, with the intention that smokers and the 18 public would rely on this information, to their 19 detriment. 20 with the intention they would rely. that 21 applies to lillian kaplan. 22 those companies include rjr nabisco, 23 inc., lorillard, brown & williamson, 24 individuals, american tobacco, and a list of 25 others, all because they were involved, all because they were in agreement together. all 2 of those findings apply. these findings may 3 not be denied or questioned by you. they must 4 carry the same weight as if you had determined 5 them yourselves. 6 as if you had determined them yourself. 7 they were never interested in the 8 public's health. the only thing they were 9 interested in were huge profits. look at the 10 documents. you want to talk about what they 11 were interested in? i do not have it at my 12 fingertips. 13 there is plenty of documents in there for 14 you to look at. they talk about how they are 15 looking at trends. they are seeing trends in 16 the 12 to 17-year-old age group, going down for 17 one of their brands. this is r.j. reynolds. 18 and they are talking about how they 19 can -- what they are going to do, what do we 20 have planned this year to reverse that trend? 21 that is not r.j. reynolds interested in 22 targeting teens and getting kids? 23 1975. expand nationally, "meet the 24 turk." to increase our young adult franchise. 25 to ensure increased and long-term growth -- growth -- for the camel filter, the brand must 2 increase its share penetration among 14 to 3 24-year-olds. they want to penetrate that age 4 group, 14 to 24. 5 mr. kaczynski told you we are not 6 interested in kids. they are not? 7 this is what they told lillian. you can 8 see the proof of kent's health protection. 9 more scientists and educators smoke kent 10 with the micronite filter. more doctors smoke 11 camel. dentists, nurses. 12 mr. kaczynski thinks, we have been punished 13 enough. how have they been punished? how have 14 they been punished for what they did to lillian 15 kaplan? how have they been punished for what 16 they have done to millions of people? they 17 have not. 18 they cannot even -- did he show you -- did 19 he get up here and say you know what? we lied, 20 we misled and we concealed. absolutely not. 21 he got up and said just about everything else 22 but that. how is that a company that is 23 changed? how is that a company that does not 24 need to be told you cannot do that? that is not 25 okay. they were after kids; there is no 2 question. they made a business decision to go 3 after children, they made a business decision 4 to lie, conceal and mislead, to create products 5 that would convince the public that they were 6 giving them a benefit, a health benefit. doing 7 something good for them. that was a business 8 decision r.j. reynolds made. 9 and they made those business decisions 10 decades ago, and they have harmed millions of 11 people because of their business decisions. 12 what happened is no surprise to them. 13 what happened to lillian was not a surprise to 14 r.j. reynolds. they knew it was going to 15 happen. they knew it was going to happen over 16 and over and over again. 17 is their conduct worthy of punishment? 18 how could it not be? 19 is their conduct worthy of setting an 20 example for other corporations? how could it 21 not be? 22 kids were replacement smokers to them. 23 that is what their record said, "replacement 24 smokers." 25 this came in through dr. figlar, i think: if the adult rate of smoking were to continue 2 at the present level, the impact of smoking on 3 future health and welfare of today's children 4 would be enormous. research has shown that 5 one-fourth or more of all regular cigarette 6 smokers die of smoking-related diseases. 7 if 20 million of the 70 million children 8 now living in the united states smoke 9 cigarettes as adults, 29 percent of them, then 10 at least 5 million of them will die of 11 smoking-related diseases. this figure should 12 alarm anyone who is concerned with the future 13 health of today's children. 14 that is not r.j. reynolds. 15 1958, 1959. they are very interested in 16 how well they are doing with kids. there is a 17 backlog of youth who have refrained from taking 18 up smoking in the face of the report. a 19 substantial number of these can be expected to 20 join with this year's crop of prospects to 21 produce a healthy increase in the number of new 22 smokers. 23 r.j. reynolds. many manufacturers have 24 studied the 14-to-20 market in the hopes of 25 uncovering the secret of the instant popularity some brands enjoy, almost to complete exclusion 2 of others. creating a fad in this market can 3 be a great bonanza, 14 to 20. 4 this is r.j. reynolds: in 1960, this 5 young adult market, the 14-to-24 age group 6 represented 21 percent of the population. they 7 represent tomorrow's cigarette business. 8 that is not r.j. reynolds interested in 9 kids? 10 as this 14-to-24 age group matures for at 11 least the next 25 years, it may well be to 12 consider another aspect of our business; that 13 is, factors which induce a pre-smoker -- a kid, 14 a teenager -- or nonsmoker to become a 15 habituated smoker. 16 he does not start to smoke to satisfy a 17 nonexistent craving for nicotine. rather, he 18 appears to start to smoke for purely 19 psychological reasons, to emulate a valued 20 image. 21 a valued image they wallpapered across 22 the country. they made smoking look glamorous, 23 athletic. 24 this is from lillian. this is from her 25 2008 deposition. mr. kaczynski told you she never talked about what the companies said, 2 until she had her stroke. he talked about her 3 stroke a lot. 4 this is '08. this is 2008: because 5 everything was supposed to be so good. the 6 affidavits from the big shot, the stars, the 7 doctors smoked camels, the best cigarette. and 8 arthur godfrey smoked his chesterfields. even 9 perry como. 10 i saw the original oceans 11 on tv a few 11 weeks ago. every one of them smoked. nothing 12 was ever said. and this was well until the 13 '60s and '70s. nothing was said, that it was 14 going to kill you. it is going to hurt you or 15 anything. i do not remember every hearing it in 16 those days. 17 did the tobacco companies, my clients, 18 specifically, philip morris and lorillard, ever 19 say it was safe to smoke cigarettes? 20 yes. in the beginning, yes. 21 when and what? 22 it is safe, it is tasty. they had all kind 23 of affidavits from all the people that smoked. 24 there was nothing wrong. 25 so he told you the only time she ever said anything like that was in the deposition 2 after she had her stroke. not true. 3 you specifically remember advertisements 4 that it was safe to smoke cigarettes? 5 yes. 6 who were those advertisements for, ma'am? 7 you mean what particular brands? i do not 8 even remember. i just lumped them all 9 together. smoking was smoking. 10 so your instructions do not tell you what 11 brand was the statement or act associated with. 12 what company was it associated with? we do not 13 have to do that. the reason we do not have to 14 do that, they were involved together. they 15 were conspirators in a strategy to keep people 16 smoking. they are all part of the conspiracy. 17 i do not have to show you this one said 18 that or this one said this. that is not what 19 the law is. if it was the law, it would be in 20 your instructions. 21 they were in it together. 22 this is rj reynolds on the right here 23 too. 1972. we already did this one on the 24 left. 25 realistically, if our company is to survive, we must prosper -- prosper, profits -- 2 over the long term, we must get our share of 3 the youth market, provide sufficient motivation 4 during the learning period to keep the learner 5 going. 6 who are they talking about? a 7 30-year-old, a 40-year-old? who is the learner 8 they are talking about? 9 provide sufficient motivation, during the 10 learning period, to keep the learner going, 11 despite physical unpleasantness and awkwardness 12 of the period. they are talking about 13 teenagers, getting through the awkward years. 14 what qualities and new image -- image a 15 new brand aimed at the youth market should 16 have. moderate level of nicotine delivered at 17 a ph to ensure slow absorption. 18 they do not want to offend them. they 19 do not want to physically push them away from 20 their product. they are talking about 21 engineering it so they do not discourage kids 22 from doing it. 23 we have deliberately played down the role 24 of nicotine. hence, the nonsmoker has little 25 or no knowledge of what satisfactions it may offer him and no desire to try it. instead, we 2 must somehow convince him, with wholly 3 irrational reasons, that he should try smoking, 4 in the hope that he will then for himself 5 discover the real satisfactions attainable. 6 there is zero question that this is a 7 company that deserves punishment. 8 i have to -- i want to -- 9 video technician: did you want this one 10 video? 11 mr. mcpharlin: yes. 12 13 14 follows:) 15 voice: -- special, peter jennings 16 reports. 17 voice: good evening and welcome. this 18 hour is about cigarettes and the people who 19 make them, which means it is about the only 20 product that you can buy virtually anywhere 21 which, when used as directed, kills more than 22 400,000 americans every year. 23 voice: when reynolds pushed the joe 24 camel image in the marketplace, they focused on 25 convenience stores, the place most underaged smokers get their cigarettes. 2 voice: if you could push r.j. reynolds 3 cigarettes to 18-year-olds, would you do it? 4 would you be expected to do it? 5 voice: yes. 6 voice: 16-year-olds? 7 voice: yes. 8 voice: 15? 9 voice: i would say teenagers, 13 and up. 10 (video clip concluded.) 11 mr. mcpharlin: they are not interested in 12 kids? their burden is the statute of 13 limitations. they have to put the evidence on. 14 they cannot give you speculation, well, we do not 15 have all the medical records. what was in 16 those medical records? that is not evidence. 17 that is pure speculation. 18 and you know what? it is their case, it is 19 their claim, right? they have the burden of 20 proof. they have to bring in evidence and 21 witnesses to support it. did they bring in a 22 single witness who knew her in that time period 23 and said hey, you know what? i saw her. she 24 could not get up a flight of stairs. absolutely 25 not. did they bring in one person who knew her 2 for her entire life that said she was having 3 respiratory problems, she was having shortness 4 of breath? no. the evidence is completely to 5 the contrary. 6 you heard from dr. weiner, dr. doben. 7 dr. doben was a doctor, a medical -- practicing 8 medicine. he treated her for years and never 9 once diagnosed her with copd. and remember, it 10 is not a cough. 11 the instruction that you have, a disease 12 manifests when it becomes diagnoseable through 13 evaluation of the patient's symptoms. 14 diagnoseable through the evaluation of the 15 patient's symptoms. 16 dr. doben treated her for years and never 17 once diagnosed her with copd. he did not know 18 what was wrong with her. he finally sent her 19 to a specialist, dr. weiner, because at some 20 point she started having respiratory problems. 21 so at some point, he started treating her 22 for it. but it was not before she got here. it 23 was not in new york. it was after 1991. and it 24 was 1994 when he sent her to dr. weiner. 25 dr. weiner told you it is very common for people not to know -- first of all, they 2 have not even proven to you that she had copd 3 before then. that is their burden. they have 4 to prove to you that she has it. then they 5 have to prove to you that she knew or should 6 have known. 7 and it is a very common way for us to make 8 the diagnosis of copd; either in the office or 9 maybe the first time they ever get sick is the 10 first time they are hospitalized with their 11 breathing issues. we make the diagnosis that 12 way. that was dr. weiner. 13 dr. keller talking about dr. doben: 14 well, look, they are not specialists. i mean, 15 dr. doben could be a very fine general 16 practitioner, but he is not a specialist. and 17 many times, they do not have that level of 18 awareness about certain diseases, and we see 19 that infrequently -- we see that frequently in 20 copd. 21 and as i said before, patients with copd 22 many times go undiagnosed for many years. even 23 after they have been seeing their primary doctor 24 on a regular basis. so this is something that 25 we see in our daily practice. dr. doben does not have the level of 2 awareness after treating her for years, but 3 lillian kaplan is supposed to have that level 4 of awareness. she is supposed to know, despite 5 the fact that her doctor does not know. 6 it cannot be based on speculation. it 7 cannot be based on a cough. 8 lillian kaplan knowing she had a cough 9 from smoking is not copd. 10 lillian kaplan knowing she has a cough 11 because smoking might irritate her throat is 12 not copd. 13 that is not the standard. that is not the 14 proof. 15 dr. keller: no evidence that anybody 16 noticed shortness of breath before 1990. 17 correct. 18 she did not have dyspnea on exertion 19 based on your review of the records prior to 20 1990. 21 remember, they read a lot of depositions, 22 they looked at a lot of medical records. 23 and you have seen no evidence of chronic 24 shortness of breath prior to 1990, true? 25 right. dr. kaplan: so in your opinion, she 2 did not know she had a medical condition prior 3 to that time? talking about up until 1994. 4 correct. 5 that was caused by smoking. 6 correct. 7 not just the known risks, but the person 8 believes they have a medical or psychological 9 problem as a consequence of the substance. and 10 the first time she believed that was when she 11 saw dr. weiner. he tells her, she stopped. so 12 she would not fulfill that. 13 from lillian: did you ever experience 14 any difficulty breathing during the time you 15 lived in new york? 16 no. 17 no competent evidence to suggest 18 otherwise, except a cough. 19 from dr. keller: and it is not unusual 20 at all for somebody to have copd and be unaware 21 of it, right? 22 yes, they can have it -- in fact, they 23 can have copd for many years without being 24 aware of it. 25 and it does not matter what anybody else knew, does not matter what anybody else thought 2 or believed. it is what lillian -- what is the 3 evidence that lillian kaplan knew that she had 4 copd? 5 and again, she cannot be held to a higher 6 standard than her own physician who did not 7 know; who dr. keller says is not skilled enough 8 to know, but lillian kaplan is supposed to be 9 skilled enough to know. 10 dr. kaplan, he takes some extreme 11 positions. and by his standard, nobody is 12 addicted. by his standard, addiction does not 13 influence anyone's smoking. 14 those are extreme positions. that is what 15 they brought you to rebut the fact that she was 16 addicted. 17 they talked about common sense. i 18 embrace that. use your common sense, of 19 course. common sense will tell you lillian 20 kaplan was addicted. she was heavily addicted. 21 the evidence is, without anything to 22 rebut it, that she tried to quit. 23 you know, all you have is dr. kaplan's 24 subjective opinion. his opinion about whether 25 she tried hard or not does not mean a thing. he was not there with her, he was not there 2 with her kids. her kids testified to how hard 3 it was on her. she was sick in bed sometimes 4 when she would try to quit. that is how sick 5 she felt. that is what people go through. 6 all right? to suggest that lillian 7 kaplan was not addicted, not even one day, not 8 for one second, not for one minute, not for the 9 50 years that she smoked shows you his opinion 10 is not credible. 11 and the evidence is that it was hard on 12 her, very hard on her. 13 where is the evidence otherwise? where 14 are the people that were involved in her life 15 over the course of all those years? you know 16 what, i knew her, i did not see that. 17 mr. kaczynski: objection, your honor. 18 the court: sustained. 19 mr. mcpharlin: her lung cancer was not 20 caused by smoking. their own expert says it 21 was, dr. bishopric. there is no evidence to 22 the contrary. 23 there is no expert that they produced, 24 except dr. keller, who does not -- is not an 25 oncologist or a pathologist. dr. villa -- there is just no evidence to 2 suggest otherwise. 3 oh, yeah. even dr. keller admitted she 4 had two risk factors. two risk factors, age 5 and smoking. he does not know what caused her 6 lung cancer. but the only two risk factors 7 that he was aware of were age and smoking. 8 and just by the way, age is the same risk 9 factor that a group of people that dr. villa 10 talked about, that .04 that never smoked, age 11 would be in that group too, along with 12 genetics, along with all the other things that 13 raise a nonsmoker's risk for lung cancer. 14 remember, this is what r.j. reynolds 15 said. mr. kaczynski brought up 1982. what was 16 r.j. reynolds saying in 1982, on the right 17 here? 18 most of those who have smoked for any 19 significant time would like to stop. 20 that is lillian kaplan. 21 many, but not most of those who would 22 like to stop are able to do so. 23 that was lillian kaplan. that is what 24 r.j. reynolds knew about their customers. they 25 can come in today and say anything they want. but this is what they knew. 2 this is what they said privately when 3 they thought nobody else was looking, that 4 nobody else would hear or listen to, ever. 5 however, we cannot ever be comfortable 6 selling a product which most of our customers 7 would stop using if they could. that is to 8 say, if the exit gate from our market should 9 suddenly open, we could be out of business 10 almost overnight. 11 that was their only concern. business. 12 everything was a business decision for them. 13 what to do in 1953 when the science 14 started coming out. what to do in 1964 when 15 the surgeon general report came out. what to 16 do in response to the surgeon general getting 17 the report ready. 18 that was a business decision for them. 19 you saw the documents. 20 we cannot give them what we know. we are 21 not giving them this. we are not giving them 22 that. 23 it was a business decision to withhold 24 what they knew. it was a business decision in 25 1964 when the report came out. it was a business decision in 1988 when 2 the surgeon general came out and said it was 3 addictive. and they came out with guns blazing 4 that he was reckless, crazy. smoking's not 5 addictive. nicotine's not a drug. 6 they would been saying it for decades before 7 that, in their private conversations, 8 obviously. in the conversations they thought 9 nobody was listening to, when they would send 10 their memos to each other talking about how we 11 can get more of these kids or what we can do to 12 boost our image with these people. 13 the court: ten minutes, counsel. 14 mr. mcpharlin: i'm sorry? 15 the court: ten minutes. 16 mr. mcpharlin: you know, it is one thing 17 to make a product that you know is addictive. 18 sell it to children, get -- let them get 19 hooked, let them ingrain it into their life, 20 and then to judge them and judge how they 21 struggle trying to stop using that. okay? 22 why would sharon beat up on her mom? why 23 would she beat up on her when she was trying to 24 quit smoking? 25 do you think lillian wanted -- of course she did. we know what she felt. she hated 2 herself. 3 so they say: oh, she said, leave me 4 alone. 5 well, who wants to be constantly reminded 6 that you are failing at something? 7 there is no evidence to contradict that 8 she tried quitting over decades. and so if 9 that bothered her, which it obviously did, from 10 her testimony, would we expect anything less 11 than for it to bother her? for her not to want 12 to fight with her kids about it? 13 her daughter wanted her to quit smoking. 14 lillian wanted to quit smoking. her son wanted 15 her to quit smoking. even he struggled at 16 quitting. 17 this is not a case where somebody ran a 18 stop sign. somebody was playing with their 19 radio and blew a red light and made a mistake. 20 this was not a mistake. nothing 21 r.j. reynolds did was by accident. 22 the strategy that r.j. reynolds and 23 philip morris and lorillard and american 24 tobacco and brown & williamson and liggett, 25 when they got together and they decided how they were going to handle this situation, how 2 they were going to respond to the science, that 3 was not a mistake. 4 it was deliberate, it was intentional. 5 it was a litigation strategy designed to 6 protect their profits. not to protect health, 7 not to protect the public, not to protect 8 people like lillian kaplan. 9 and, you know, they did it knowing what 10 the result would be. they did it knowing that 11 people were going to die. 12 and they watched hundreds of thousands of 13 people die every year, every decade. 14 and i think i heard the words: you cannot 15 just put your head in the sand. 16 they did not just put their heads in the 17 sand. they stuck their head out loud and 18 clear. they denied it, they refuted it. they 19 went on national television, they went on ted 20 koppel, nightline. they swore before congress. 21 they were the manufacturer of the 22 product. they were telling the public: we 23 know our product better than anybody else. the 24 science is not there, the government is wrong. 25 they are just trying to get into your business. they are just trying to interfere with you 2 doing what you want to do in life. there is no 3 proof that it causes any harm. 4 when a corporation behaves that way, when 5 a corporation acts and causes harm, they are 6 responsible for the harms, all of the harms. 7 all of them. 8 and they do not get a pass because they 9 make a lot of money and they can pay the master 10 settlement agreement. 11 they do not get a pass for their conduct. 12 they do not get a pass for the lives that 13 they have taken, the lives who are going to 14 continue to be taken. 15 you know, you watched the video of 16 lillian kaplan, and you watched her struggling 17 to breathe. it was not just her stroke, it 18 was not just her voice. you watched what she 19 was going through. you watched how hard it was 20 for her. 21 she had been -- cancer had been killing 22 her for a while and obviously nobody knew it. 23 she had been losing weight for a while. they 24 want you to think that everything was just 25 fine. but even if we just captured that one 2 year, the torment that she went through for 3 that one year, that r.j. reynolds caused, that 4 r.j. reynolds could have avoided. 5 they are the ones who decided to go down 6 the path that they went down, right? they are 7 the ones who decided to try to convince people 8 to keep smoking. 9 it was not like they stood off on the 10 sidelines and let everybody make their own 11 decisions. 12 they actively got out there and said 13 there is nothing wrong with our product. if a 14 car company comes out and says, you know what, 15 there is nothing wrong with our tires. there is 16 nothing wrong with our seat belts. the 17 government test data, the crash data is just 18 not accurate. 19 if they were lying, if they were 20 withholding information, they would be 21 responsible for all the harms that they caused, 22 right? 23 there is no difference. but the 24 difference is, you know what? they did it for 25 decades. the difference is they tricked as many people in the public health as they could. 2 they tricked doctors, they tricked scientists. 3 it was an elaborate, elaborate plan for which 4 they spent hundreds of millions into the 5 billions of dollars. to do what? so they 6 could continue to make billions and billions of 7 dollars. 8 dr. kaplan said one thing that i agree 9 with. that lillian kaplan was a nice, decent, 10 caring, dedicated, committed lady who did not 11 deserve what she got from r.j. reynolds or 12 lorillard or brown & williamson or american 13 tobacco. 14 thank you.
