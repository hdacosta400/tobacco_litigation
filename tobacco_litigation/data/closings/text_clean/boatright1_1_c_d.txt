16 mr. reilly: thank you, your honor. 17 good morning, everybody. 18 jurors: good morning. 19 mr. reilly: i want to start my closing 20 argument where i began my opening statement, 21 and that is by thanking you guys for your 22 service. 23 this is the beginning of our, what, 24 fourth week together, but who is counting, 25 right? 1 it is a tremendous service that you do, no 2 question about it. i have an hour and 20 3 minutes. so let me just be brief and say thank 4 you very much on behalf of myself, philip 5 morris, and frankly on behalf of everybody 6 involved. 7 okay. now, when i stood before you in my 8 opening statement, i said that i was confident 9 that what i was telling you in my opening 10 statement was going to be the evidence would, 11 in fact, be the evidence. 12 and i told you that you would see -- you 13 can see i've got -- i do not have a computer 14 system that puts a hat on somebody's head. 15 what i've got are some old-fashioned boards. 16 but i told you in my opening statement 17 that i believed what i was telling you then 18 would be the evidence. 19 i was confident enough about it that i 20 expected to use many of the very same boards 21 when i stood before you in my closing argument. 22 that is exactly what i'm going to do. 23 that same timeline i showed you in my 24 opening statement, i'm going to show you that. 25 i'm going to go through more quickly than 1 i did in my opening statement. but i've added 2 a few things to it. 3 and remember the board i showed you of 4 the wall of doctors' names. 5 plaintiff's counsel indicated that this 6 was so easy, it is falling off a log, no issue 7 here about what mr. boatright had in the '90s, 8 what was his disease. 9 remember i showed you the board of a 10 dozen doctors who all diagnosed mr. boatright 11 with the very same lung problem. and what was 12 it? 13 and we went through -- during the course 14 of this trial, we went through medical record 15 after medical record after medical record in 16 the '90s. and what was the disease? it was 17 asthma. 18 so i'm going to show you that same list, 19 and i'm going to walk you through some of the 20 medical records, not all of them. but -- i 21 mean, that took us a long time. right? 22 but i started with this board. that very 23 same board. and i said, you know what? not 24 the medical issue. not the issue of what did 25 mr. boatright have, what disease was he 1 manifesting in the '90s. 2 but i said: what is the rest of this 3 case going to be about? i said it was all 4 going to be about, two words: control and 5 responsibility. 6 because i said in spite of what has been, 7 my goodness, an hour and 15 minutes of closing 8 argument. how much did you hear about 9 mr. boatright in that hour and 15 minutes? 10 and whose lawsuit is this? 11 this is not a class action, ladies and 12 gentlemen. it is not. 13 this is a lawsuit brought by one smoker 14 about one smoker's decisions. one smoker's 15 smoking history. 16 and who is that? it is mr. boatright. it 17 always has been. 18 so the question of control, who is in 19 control of the decisions that mr. boatright 20 made in the course of his life regarding his 21 lifestyle? 22 because as we talked about and as you saw 23 in this jury room -- in this courtroom, we 24 do not live our lives in a silo. we do not just 25 smoke. we do not just drink alcohol. we 1 do not -- we live in an environment. 2 so who is in control of mr. boatright's 3 lifestyle decisions regarding how he was going 4 to live his life? 5 who was in control of his decision to 6 begin and continue smoking? did you even hear 7 the story of him beginning smoking during his 8 closing argument? 9 who controlled his decisions to become a 10 regular smoker? what information did 11 mr. boatright have when he decided to smoke his 12 first cigarette, his second cigarette, and all 13 the rest of them, based on his own body and his 14 own life? have you heard that in this closing 15 argument? 16 who controlled his decisions to use 17 smoking as -- did you even hear why he smoked? 18 did you hear what his pleasure from smoking was 19 in this closing argument? 20 and did anything that philip morris ever 21 said or did, or for that matter liggett, have 22 any substantial impact on mr. boatright's 23 decisions regarding whether he began smoking or 24 not? 25 you would have had to have been reminded 1 how he began to smoke to know the answer to 2 that, right? 3 you would have to know that. but you did not 4 even hear it in his closing argument. 5 and what else did i say? i said when you 6 knew the answers to these questions about 7 control, then you could address the question of 8 responsibility. 9 judge radabaugh has already read to you 10 the acknowledgment on the part of the 11 plaintiff. 12 he knows that he was in control of his 13 decisions about smoking, because he is 14 acknowledged that he has responsibility for 15 whether he did or he did not quit. 16 it is in the instructions that the judge 17 just read to you. the instructions that each 18 one of you will have a copy of. each one. 19 and then you will get to determine to what 20 extent, if any, philip morris -- sure, philip 21 morris made the cigarettes that he chose to 22 smoke. he liked their brand better than any 23 other one, and he said that. 24 all right. and i said, well -- in my 25 opening statement, i said in order for you guys 1 to know the answer to these questions -- oh, 2 you know what, i should back up a step and say 3 i told you that those words "control" and 4 "responsibility" would not be in the court's 5 instructions. 6 i was half right. "control" is not in 7 the instructions, but "responsibility" is. 8 it is in the instructions over and over and over 9 again. 10 and i said that judge radabaugh was going 11 to read you pages of instructions filled with 12 legal terms, and he has. and he was going to 13 read you a verdict form, pages filled with 14 legal terms. and he has. 15 but they still all boil down to these two 16 words really, with the exception of the class 17 membership question. and that is the medical 18 question. 19 and i said -- you know, i spent the time 20 in my opening statement to walk you through 21 what was the personal history of mr. boatright? 22 and that has not been done. 23 and why not? because when you do walk 24 through that personal history, then you know 25 the answers to these two questions. 1 so as i said, i want to spend the bulk of 2 my time going through this closing argument 3 just reviewing with you what that story was. 4 and i want to go back to the '50s. you 5 know, mr. schlesinger said, oh, this was big 6 news about nicotine. 7 i can take you all the way back. 8 remember reader's digest? i put them in 9 evidence. they are in evidence. there is 10 reader's digests going all the way back to the 11 '20s, talking about why do people smoke? for 12 nicotine. was this some secret? there was no 13 secret. 14 if you want to, i've put in evidence the 15 examples of reader's digest articles, examples 16 of the newspaper articles that were occurring 17 in the '50s, magazine articles occurring in the 18 '50s, like this life magazine article, 19 communicating to the american public the 20 avalanche of information that was coming out, 21 telling the american public about the medical 22 advances that were occurring in the '50s, 23 connecting smoking with lung cancer. 24 you know -- and i'm not going to spend 25 hardly any time on the '50s, because you know 1 mr. boatright was born into a family of 2 smokers. 3 he was born january 1, 1953. his mom 4 smoked, his dad smoked. they were not together 5 very long. his mom took off. his stepmom 6 shows up. what was it, 1955 or thereabouts. 7 she smoked. his older brothers smoked. 8 ultimately, his younger brother's going to 9 smoke. the uncles that lived with him smoked. 10 and you have heard from dr. proctor, their 11 witness, when i cross-examined him, you know, 12 you live in an environment like that, who 13 influences you to either begin or not begin 14 smoking? 15 and he said these people around you, your 16 environment. and you know that is true. 17 and, in fact, who else contributes to 18 that environment are your peers. and when we 19 get to mr. boatright's first cigarette, we are 20 going to see the influence of his peers. 21 is he sitting there thinking about a 22 marlboro ad with a middle-aged man riding a 23 horse? or is he being influenced by his best 24 friends? his best friends. 25 all right. you know that they smoked. 1 you know -- you know what? we showed you the 2 news programs. of course he is a child. he is a 3 baby here. but this is the atmosphere in 4 which -- this is what is going on in the united 5 states. 6 you know that in 1957, when he was 7 5 years old, he had -- maybe it was not his 8 first serious episode of asthma, but you know 9 he had such a serious episode of asthma that he 10 had a doctor come stay at his house overnight 11 just to make sure he could breathe through the 12 night. 13 this is a story -- did you hear about 14 asthma in that closing argument? did you hear 15 the word "asthma" in that closing argument? 16 no, you did not. 17 but you know that mr. boatright had 18 severe asthma throughout his life. and you 19 know that he had restrictions put on him as a 20 child, restrictions on what he could and 21 could not do. the physical restrictions, 22 because he had such severe asthma. 23 and you know that by the time the '50s 24 had ended, what is going on in the united 25 states? there are 13 million americans who 1 have quit smoking and millions more who did not 2 start. why? because of all the information 3 that is out about the health risks of smoking. 4 by the time mr. boatright gets out of his 5 childhood, he is been hospitalized twice for 6 severe asthma. 7 mr. boatright, at age 10 was tested for 8 allergies. he was so allergic to everything, 9 his allergies were very serious. very severe. 10 you know that in 1964, the surgeon 11 general's report came out. you know that 12 mr. boatright -- you saw the coverage. you saw 13 the news coverage. 14 there is a cbs -- i'm not going to play 15 it for you, but there is the cbs special news 16 report. you know how harry reasoner ends it. 17 he says: you know what? now it is up to 18 you folks. filters are not going to save you, 19 smoking causes lung cancer. now it is up to you 20 to decide whether or not you are going to start 21 smoking or continue to smoke or quit. 22 that is what is going on in the american 23 public. and there is no question about it. 24 you saw the newscasts. and it was on every 25 station. 1 and mr. boatright, even though he was 2 only 11 years old at the time, the media 3 coverage was so vast and so powerful that 4 mr. boatright said he remembered it. when he 5 got on the stand, he acknowledged that he could 6 actually remember that newscast. that news 7 coverage. 8 did that prevent mr. boatright from 9 beginning smoking? no. 10 you know that his stepmother who he said 11 was physically -- would use physical punishment 12 had said no smoking. 13 you heard that his dad said that because 14 of his asthma, he said my dad would have been 15 very concerned about me being a smoker because 16 of my asthma. that is his testimony. 17 with that knowledge, knowing that if he 18 gets caught by doris smoking, he is going to get 19 physically punished, he still does what? 20 when his buddies come over -- his two 21 friends came over when he was -- how old was 22 he? was he 12? was he 13? was he 14? 23 in the answers to interrogatories, he 24 said: the first time i began smoking marlboros 25 was when i was 14 years old. 1 i do not know what the real age is, but is 2 it 12? is it 13? is it 14? 3 the only variable there is, was the 4 warning already on the packs? you know this 5 warning was put on the packs as of january 1, 6 1966. 7 did the warnings on the packs prevent 8 mr. boatright when his friends came over and 9 they had swiped cigarettes from their moms and 10 dads, and they came over and said, hey, 11 richard, come on with us, swipe a cigarette out 12 of your stepmom's pack, let us go across the 13 street. let us hide behind the shed and let us 14 smoke a cigarette. 15 you know that is how it happened. 16 i asked mr. boatright: why did you go 17 ahead and start smoking? 18 he said: well, all the cool kids were 19 smoking. 20 he wanted to be one of the cool kids. he 21 wanted to be with his friends. peer pressure. 22 what makes people decide whether or not they are 23 going to smoke or drink or whatever. peer 24 pressure. 25 it was just something to do. 1 you were doing it to be a little 2 rebellious, right? 3 i think yeah, to a point, yeah. 4 yeah, that is right. 5 and you know that in 1967, 6 mr. boatright -- first he is got the parents 7 that he is living with. his dad and stepmom 8 do not want him to smoke. 9 then he goes to live with his natural 10 mother in orlando for several months in 1967, 11 and you know that he said, she told me not to 12 smoke. 13 and by the way, i also asked him -- i had 14 to sort of drag this out of him. i do not know 15 if you remember this or not. 16 but i had to remind him from his 17 deposition what he would said about his personal 18 knowledge when he smoked that first cigarette 19 because of his asthma, whether he did not know 20 that that would be potentially bad for him 21 because of his asthma. 22 and here is what he said. 23 i had him read the question at line 10. 24 you knew there was a possibility that 25 cigarette smoking could cause you to have an 1 asthma attack from the time that you smoked 2 your very first cigarette, right? 3 and your answer was: whether it sank in 4 or not, i just -- it is been too long ago to 5 remember, while i would assume that cigarette 6 smoking was bad for me. 7 the question was: you knew enough to 8 know that it might cause you to have a problem 9 from that very first cigarette, whether you 10 dwelled on it or not, you knew it? 11 the answer was: yes. 12 do you remember being asked those 13 questions and giving those answers october 18, 14 2011? 15 his answer was: yes. his answer was 16 yes. but you did not hear a word about that in 17 closing argument. 18 why did he choose marlboros? here is 19 what he said. 20 in terms of the strength of the smoke, 21 that is a matter of personal taste. 22 and your answer was: for me, it was. 23 and then you were asked: okay. so you 24 liked them, meaning marlboros, better because, 25 you liked the taste better. is that what 1 you are telling me? 2 answer: they are stronger also. that is 3 what it says, and i did like marlboros. i did 4 like the crush-proof box. all my brothers 5 smoked marlboros too. 6 why did mr. boatright choose marlboros? 7 there you have it. that is his own testimony. 8 again, i had to draw it out from his 9 earlier testimony in deposition. 10 his biological mother caught him smoking 11 in orlando. 12 she caught you smoking. she told you you 13 should not be smoking because of health reasons 14 and because you were too young, right? 15 i believe that is what she said. yes. 16 you hid your smoking from her, right? 17 well, yes. 18 so here he is got every adult responsible 19 for his well-being telling him, do not smoke. 20 now, mr. schlesinger and mr. hammer said, 21 gosh, if we would just said that smoking causes 22 illness he would never have begun smoking, he 23 would never have smoked. 24 but there you have people directly 25 involved with him. this is not a class action. 1 this is about one smoker and one smoker only. 2 so now, how long did you stay with your 3 mom there in orlando in 1967? 4 not very long. she had forgotten or 5 never even thought of -- we were not ozzie and 6 harriet kids. she was trying to make us ozzie 7 and harriet boys, and we just had our 8 difference of opinions. 9 now, that is mr. boatright describing 10 himself at that age. and you know more about 11 that story. 12 so is there a serious contention here 13 about what mr. boatright -- who was in control 14 of mr. boatright's decisions about how he was 15 going to live his life? 16 and yes, he told you at age 15 or 16, he 17 makes another decision for himself about how 18 he is going to live his life. 19 as i said, you do not live your life in a 20 silo. he goes back to live with his parents, 21 his dad and stepmother. his mom sends him 22 home, back to savannah from orlando, because 23 she really just cannot handle him. 24 so he goes back to savannah, and now he 25 starts drinking beer. i think he told us that 1 he started racking balls in a pool hall for 2 making money, and he drops out of school in the 3 10th grade. 4 what is he doing? he is hanging out with 5 his friends, and you know what happens. 6 that takes us through the '60s. 7 now, public service announcements. you 8 saw them. 9 i think, michael, do we have just the 10 figure of bill talman? 11 there is bill talman. 1300 of these 12 running every year. 13 mr. boatright said: i saw those. 14 they did not have any effect on him. he 15 still was going to smoke, and he did smoke. 16 dr. proctor said: that is not so powerful 17 as the ones today. ladies and gentlemen, that 18 guy is standing right there telling you, i'm 19 dying and i do not want to die. that is pretty 20 powerful. 21 let us go to the '70s. 22 you know the story of mr. boatright 23 joining the marines. you know the whole story, 24 all right? 25 that same year that he joins the marines, 1 the warning changes on every pack of 2 cigarettes. 3 now it says: warning, the surgeon 4 general has determined that cigarette smoking 5 is dangerous to your health. 6 and you have an instruction from the 7 judge that says, you know what? that is -- 8 that is the warning that is necessary. you cannot 9 criticize philip morris for not warning more 10 than that. that is a reasonable warning. 11 he goes to the marines. can 12 mr. boatright quit smoking when he is 13 sufficiently motivated to do so? sure. 14 guess what? he goes to boot camp. now, 15 he has not told them about his asthma, and does 16 he have severe asthma? you know he does. 17 but for the first two, two and a half 18 weeks of boot camp, you cannot smoke. you are in 19 marines boot camp. 20 mr. boatright said: i did not get to 21 smoke until -- the smoking lamp was lit 22 sometime after the first two weeks for 20 23 minutes, time enough to smoke a cigarette, 24 maybe two. 25 could -- and mr. boatright said, hey, i 1 did not smoke, of course not. 2 because he was sufficiently motivated by 3 the u.s. marine corps not to smoke, in boot 4 camp, right? 5 but as you know, he was discharged 6 because of his asthma, and he went back to 7 savannah, and he began to live that same 8 lifestyle of hanging out with his buddies. 9 then he is going to stay there until 10 sometime in the late part of 1970. and this is 11 really interesting. 12 because i asked him, so -- he said he 13 started dividing his time between his dad's 14 house and his mom's house. his dad in 15 savannah, his mom in orlando, right? 16 and toward the ends of 1970, i said: 17 you are living in orlando at the end of 1970? 18 i think so. 19 so you were staying at your mother's 20 house, your natural mother's house in orlando 21 dating donna. 22 but remember in late 1970s, he starts to 23 date donna grant, the lady that becomes the 24 first mrs. boatright, right? 25 he says: you were married in december of 1 1970, but you do not remember for how many 2 months before that you had been living in 3 orlando? 4 i do not. 5 once you started living in orlando with 6 your mom and dating donna, did you just stay in 7 orlando to date donna? 8 yeah, i kind of grew apart from my best 9 buddies, you know, ronny and daniel, the guys 10 he had been hanging out with. i mean, i just 11 kind of grew apart. 12 well, what did he tell you -- he said: i 13 saw joe cullman on "face the nation" on 14 january 3, 1971 sitting at my dad's house with 15 my stepmom, the hated stepmom, noon on sunday 16 morning. 17 well, he just got through telling you, 18 i'm sorry, he was in orlando with his natural 19 mother, dating donna. 20 last time i looked, you cannot be two 21 places at the same time. but he admitted that 22 he found that clip of joe cullman on "face the 23 nation" after this lawsuit started when he was 24 cruising the internet, looking for stuff like 25 that. 1 mr. hammer: objection, judge, misstates 2 the evidence. 3 the court: overruled. 4 mr. reilly: there is an instruction here 5 about the credibility of witnesses, and you 6 guys get to decide about the credibility of 7 witnesses. 8 he meets, dates, marries his first wife 9 donna. 10 1971, no more marlboro ads on television 11 or radio. 12 1972, that warning goes on every ad. 13 1972, he begins working for arthur murray 14 dance studio, right? and now you heard about 15 his lifestyle. it is dancing, it is partying, 16 it is smoking, it is drinking. 17 he said at this point the one element 18 that had not been there in the time that he would 19 been hanging out with his buddies was 20 traveling. no more traveling. 21 but you learned that he and the first 22 donna boatright had an off and on again, off 23 again and on again marriage. they get divorced 24 once, they get divorced twice. they have a 25 child and then he is gone. 1 divorced his first wife in 1975. that is 2 the same time that he gets a -- this is -- i 3 almost let this one go by. 4 he said: you saw the interview of joe 5 cullman, the ceo of philip morris, on "face the 6 nation." do you remember the date? 7 no, i know it was '71. 8 you went on the internet and searched and 9 found that tv clip, did not you? 10 that is how i found it. 11 so there you go. it is in black and 12 white. it is -- transcript. that is right out 13 of the court reporter's transcript in this 14 trial. 15 mr. hammer: objection. he is left out 16 part of that answer. 17 the court: overruled. 18 mr. reilly: so what you are saying is 19 that you have a distinct memory of sitting down 20 in the late morning with doris and the two of 21 you watching "face the nation" on tv? 22 i do not remember exactly where i was 23 sitting, but i do remember it came on. 24 those two stories, ladies and gentlemen, 25 do not fit. 1 now, 1975, he gets a call from his buddy 2 don mann up in new york, up in buffalo. 3 you moved up to new york because you had 4 a friend up there by the name of don mann? 5 yes, he was there. 6 that is the reason you went to new york? 7 that is correct. 8 you went up there because he told you 9 that there was a lot of people, a lot of 10 parties, and a lot of what you described as 11 blah, blah, blah. right? 12 yeah. don was the coach, my teacher, 13 and, yeah, he did say that. 14 so now why did he go to buffalo? 15 parties, people and blah, blah, blah, whatever 16 that is. 17 but you know what it is. it is parties, 18 dancing, drinking, smoking, and now traveling. 19 and you know that that is where he begins 20 to -- when he meets donna conliffe, the 21 pulmonary nurse who came here and testified 22 under subpoena. she is a neonatal nurse now. 23 you saw her. 24 she went to arthur murray dance studio to 25 get dance lessons, and he was there. he wanted 1 to sell her dance lessons, then he ends up 2 wanting to date her. 3 and while they are dating, as a pulmonary 4 nurse, what does she do? you remember. 5 mr. boatright is -- this is 1975. he is 6 what, 22, 23 years old. 7 and she is very blunt with him. and she 8 tells him: hey, look, you are an asthmatic. 9 you are smoking. that is the worst thing you can 10 possibly do for yourself. 11 she works in the community hospital in 12 the pulmonary ward. she is taking care of the 13 patients who have lung cancer, emphysema, who 14 are dying of smoking-related illnesses. 15 and she says to him, i told him that is 16 probably the worst thing in the world to do for 17 asthma is to smoke. 18 she had been in nursing school. she had 19 a cadaver that she worked on. 20 she said: i told him i had a human 21 cadaver with black lungs that had been a 22 smoker. i told him that. i said it is a coffin 23 nail. you might as well just write yourself a 24 death warrant. 25 she offered to take him to the roswell 1 park cancer center right there in buffalo, and 2 she said: look, there is a wall of all the 3 movie stars who have died from smoking-related 4 illnesses. 5 and i offered to take him down there and 6 show him that wall to convince him that he 7 really needed to stop smoking, because this was 8 a death warrant for him if he continued to 9 smoke. 10 then i asked her: so what was his 11 response? what did he tell you about what he 12 wanted to do? 13 and she said: he said nobody is going to 14 tell me what to do. i'll stop if i want to 15 stop. i do not want to stop. i like it. it 16 relieves my stress. i'm fine. everybody in my 17 family smokes. nothing is going to happen to 18 me. quit griping to me. just arguing. 19 now, that is the story you did not hear. 20 well, of course, you did not hear it. 21 all right. very, very bottom, the part i 22 did not read. 23 i said: did he ever tell you that he 24 did not understand what you said? 25 no. 1 or that he disagreed or that he was 2 uninformed? or he said, gosh, i do not 3 understand you, this is not right. i've seen 4 the guys on television or somewhere from philip 5 morris or some cigarette company, and you are 6 wrong, they are right. something like that? 7 that never happened. 8 let us go to the '80s. 9 you know that he is with her -- they are 10 married for a total of five years, but they are 11 only together for, what, 15 months? 12 by 1978, when their child is born, he is 13 gone, right? last time she sees him is when 14 their son is 10 days old. 15 before that -- and what was his 16 lifestyle? you saw it. partying, dancing, 17 drinking, smoking; whole shooting match. but 18 traveling, leaving the house a lot, coming back 19 sometimes. 20 she said one of the times that he came 21 back, she made a condition for him coming back 22 that he quit smoking. 23 could he quit smoking when he was 24 sufficiently motivated to do so? 25 you heard her say: you know what? for 1 the two weeks that he remained around, i never 2 saw him smoke. never saw him smoke. 3 but two and a half weeks later, he is 4 gone. right? 5 1981. you heard the quote from 6 dr. proctor. he said: by 1981, 95 percent of 7 the americans are aware of the health risks of 8 smoking and ninety percent realize their health 9 could be affected. 10 is mr. boatright in that crowd? of 11 course he is. he is just had a registered nurse 12 working in a pulmonary unit at a hospital as 13 his wife. any question in your mind about it? 14 1982. he is going to move to miami. he 15 moves to miami. he is working in arthur murray 16 dance studio in miami. he meets, dates and 17 marries nicki fraser. she too told him not to 18 smoke. 19 all right. now let me go back. 20 you moved to miami in about what, the 21 early '80s? 22 yes, i believe so. 23 and your lifestyle in miami was very 24 similar to what it had been in the carolinas, 25 when you were married to donna conliffe? 1 because you remember, they moved from 2 buffalo down to the carolinas. and she went to 3 nursing school down in the carolinas. 4 yes, i believe that was the lifestyle. 5 we did a lot of dancing, a lot of practicing. 6 we would go out and practice. yes, that was 7 it. same lifestyle that we had. 8 but now he is in miami. 9 this is his testimony about her, nicki 10 fraser, nicki boatright telling him about his 11 health risks. 12 and she talked to you about the health 13 risks of smoking, did not she? 14 in a passing conversation. we did not 15 have a big, big conversation about it. but she 16 probably mentioned it. i would not say she did 17 not. 18 that is a double negative. it means she 19 did. 20 what was your response to her? 21 probably -- just probably ignored her. 22 it is okay. but who is in control of your 23 decisions? 24 this is 1981, 1982. 1982. 25 now, you know that in 1983, that nicki 1 fraser, they had a child, cristal. nicki 2 fraser is going to move back to miami. and 3 mr. boatright is going to stay in orlando. 4 there he is going to meet and date the fourth 5 mrs. boatright, deborah. 6 and you know that the lifestyle remains 7 the same. 8 this is what mrs. boatright said. 9 what is his favorite drink? 10 jim beam. 11 same lifestyle. where do they go? 12 dancing at nightclubs. that is okay. it is a 13 lifestyle. but you have chosen your lifestyle. 14 you chose your lifestyle. 15 so in 1984, while at one of those 16 nightclubs, what happens to mr. boatright? his 17 asthma, which -- remember, donna conliffe had 18 said: when i met him, he was using an inhaler. 19 he had asthma when i met him. 20 he is now going to have a serious asthma 21 attack, so serious that he is got to go to the 22 hospital. he is got to go to the hospital. 23 asthma. 24 and that is the same year that 25 mr. boatright said, i saw that ceo of 1 r.j. reynolds on nightline. 2 remember that? 3 he said: i saw that program. 4 well, i put in evidence -- i realize it is 5 a very fuzzy enlargement. i apologize for 6 that. 7 but it shows that nightline came on, and 8 that program was nightline 11:30 on a thursday 9 night, february 2, 1984. 10 and, again, this is a question of did 11 mr. boatright really see it then? did it 12 really influence him then, or is this something 13 he found on the internet after filing this 14 lawsuit? 15 because i asked him: what time did you 16 get home when you were working at the arthur 17 murray dance studio in orlando, florida? 18 and he said -- here is his answer: uh, 19 let me think. 1:00 would be the earliest. 20 then he said: no, no, 12:30. 21 okay. but nightline is over at midnight. 22 over at midnight. 23 so unless they are watching nightline 24 while they are dancing, that was impossible. 25 and i put this in evidence for you guys 1 if you want to look at it. 2 now, just to show you about environment 3 as the precipitating factor for folks to smoke, 4 you remember that he is now dating 5 mrs. boatright, the fourth mrs. boatright, and 6 she is a nonsmoker. 7 when they begin dating, she is a 8 nonsmoker, and this is what she testified. 9 when you were growing up, your parents 10 advised you, do not smoke, correct? 11 yes. 12 and they began advising you not to smoke 13 before you were in high school? 14 yes. 15 and you never smoked in high school? 16 no. 17 never smoked after high school? 18 no, not that i can remember, no. 19 as a matter of fact, mr. boatright 20 probably offered you his -- your first 21 cigarette. 22 now, how old is she? she is 23 years old. 23 what was the reason why she took the cigarette? 24 the environment. they are out at nightclubs. 25 this is what she said. 1 we are out in a nightclub. there is 2 drinking, dancing. he offers me a cigarette. 3 i took it. 4 and she became a smoker. not as regular 5 a smoker as mr. boatright, but she became a 6 smoker. 7 that is environment. that is peer 8 pressure. 9 does mr. boatright know -- if there were 10 any question about mr. boatright knowing or not 11 knowing that what he is doing comes with a 12 health risk, i mean, at this juncture, is that 13 even remotely possible? 14 warnings changed on the packs in 1985. 15 now they include a specific warning saying 16 smoking causes lung cancer and emphysema. 17 1988, mrs. boatright becomes pregnant. 18 public service announcements are continuing. 19 i think we have just the image of yul 20 brynner, another star who says, hey, you know 21 what? i'm dying. i'm dead. that one actually 22 said i'm dead. that one actually said, if 23 you are seeing this now, i've died. 24 mr. boatright sees the surgeon general's 25 report, the news coverage of that, 1988. and 1 at the same time, his wife says, i'm pregnant, 2 i do not want you smoking around me anymore 3 because of our as yet unborn baby. 4 and what is he do? he is going to sign up 5 for a smoking cessation class at st. joseph's 6 hospital. he is going to take it, except it 7 comes at the very same moment that their 8 daughter danielle is born three weeks 9 prematurely. 10 does mr. boatright then sign up for that 11 smoking cessation program after she is born? 12 no. 13 i said: so now let us take you to the 14 time period where we left, and that is about 15 1989. danielle is born. you start trying to 16 quit? 17 correct. 18 not because of health effects, but 19 because debbie wanted you to -- actually, this 20 is mr. hammer asking him questions. 21 he said: that is correct. 22 so is he now in 1989 quitting smoking 23 because of the health effects out of a concern 24 for his personal health? 25 no. he is doing it because debbie wanted 1 him to. 2 that is correct. 3 does mr. boatright want to quit smoking 4 in 1989? that is his own lawyer asking him that 5 question. 6 and the answer was: no. 7 and this, again, is mr. hammer asking 8 mr. boatright these questions. 9 throughout the '60s, did you ever think 10 about quitting? 11 no, i did not. 12 all throughout the '70s, did you ever 13 think about quitting? 14 no, sir. 15 the '80s, 1981. all the way through 16 until around, say, '88 period of time when 17 debbie gets pregnant. were you thinking about 18 quitting? was it even a thought? 19 no. 20 this is his own lawyer asking him these 21 questions. 22 and after all of that, all that personal 23 story of mr. boatright, is that really because 24 he still had some question as to whether what 25 he is doing comes with a health risk. or is it 1 because mr. boatright genuinely enjoyed 2 smoking. 3 you know what he told his second wife 4 donna conliffe? he said: it helps me relieve 5 my stress. it is pleasurable. i enjoy it. 6 now, he denied having a stressful job, 7 but she said that is what he told her. helps me 8 deal with my stress. 9 1990s. he is hospitalized for the first 10 time that we know about in the medical records 11 that we have for severe asthma. 12 i'm going to go through the medical 13 records briefly in just a minute when i get to 14 the first question on the verdict form about 15 what is going on medically. 16 but the medical record shows that he is 17 using the nicoderm patch by prescription. but 18 is he really interested -- is he doing this for 19 himself or is he doing this because someone 20 else wants him to quit? 21 well, what you know is -- what you know 22 is that here in 1992, he told you that he went 23 to dr. catz, and he maintained that dr. catz 24 told him that he had emphysema, copd from 25 smoking. 1 i'll cover that in just a minute. 2 but he said that was the eye opener for 3 him. that is the first time he realized that 4 smoking was dangerous. 5 and what did he say to you? 6 he said: i was angry. i felt deceived. 7 i felt that i'd been misled by philip morris. 8 and so what did he -- oh, and by the way, 9 he said: up to that point, while i talked to 10 dr. leibowitz in the late '80s and dr. tabb in 11 1992, and they would said to me, i ought to quit 12 smoking. he said: right. 13 and i asked him: and your point here was 14 they were talking to you. but in your 15 estimation, they were not counseling you. they 16 were telling you to stop, but they were not 17 counseling you. 18 he said: well, yeah, but what i was 19 trying to get across to the other attorney -- 20 and that was mr. hammer -- was the -- 21 mr. hammer: objection, judge, misstates 22 the evidence. it was -- co-counsel was taking 23 the deposition. 24 the court: the jury will rely on their 25 own memory. 1 mr. reilly: well, yeah, what i was 2 trying to get across to the other attorney was, 3 a statement is something that says if you are 4 talking to somebody that says, oh, richard, 5 you are a little overweight. you should really 6 cut back. you know, to me, that is a statement. 7 but to counsel somebody, you try to sit 8 down with them and explain to them, you know, 9 the options. 10 and that is what i was talking about 11 with -- about counseling. a statement is one 12 thing, counseling is another. 13 that is from this trial transcript. 14 so in 1993, '2, he says he has this 15 epiphany with dr. catz. and now he is angry at 16 philip morris for having deceived him. 17 so what does he do, this angry man? this 18 angry man sends in sweepstakes entry forms for 19 philip morris saying, hey, i want to get stuff. 20 i want to be in your sweepstakes. i want your 21 logo'd stuff. 22 you remember i said, gosh, you could have 23 gotten that canvas bag at walmart or penney's 24 or anywhere, right? 25 and here he is, he wants the logo, fanny 1 pack, jacket, carry bag. this is an angry, 2 deceived man? 3 this is a guy who did not know about the 4 health risks of smoking? 5 and that goes right on through to 2003. 6 the records are in about the last time he 7 signed up for something. 8 he signed up -- telephoned in a 9 sweepstakes request in 2003 just before he quit 10 smoking. 11 all right. by 1995, 50 million americans 12 had quit smoking. 13 throughout the '90s, mr. boatright had 14 been seen at least 26 times by 12 different 15 doctors. they all treat him for his 16 long-standing asthma. they all advise him to 17 stop smoking. 18 we go to the 2000s. can mr. boatright 19 quit smoking when he is sufficiently motivated 20 to quit? yes, he can. because he does. the 21 medical records are in evidence. 22 we have separated in that little black 23 binder the medical records that i think you will 24 find to be the most interesting, not 45,000. 25 just a few in there. 1 and they include one that says that by 2 the end of december 2001, mr. boatright is down 3 to smoking two or three cigarettes a day. 4 and as of january 1, i asked 5 mr. boatright: did you make a new year's 6 resolution to quit smoking? 7 he said: yes, i did. 8 and so in dr. forman's medical records, 9 you will see that as of april 19th, he had quit 10 smoking for three months. forman sees him 11 again may 13. he is had one cigarette. 12 by mid july, he would had a few cigarettes, 13 up until two weeks ago. two weeks ago, he quit 14 smoking again. 15 and then you know the story of him 16 quitting smoking on december 15, 2003. 17 the rest of the story about how he quit 18 smoking. he said what was different that day 19 was that when he got out of the hospital, 20 instead of stopping on the way home and getting 21 a pack of cigarettes, as he would always done in 22 the past, that day his nephew picked him up, 23 and he said take me on home. 24 he went on home, locked the door, went to 25 bed. and while he was recuperating from his 1 illness, he stays home, does not watch tv, 2 apparently, does not see anybody smoking, 3 does not put himself in proximity to somebody 4 smoking, either on tv or in person. 5 and at the end of that time frame, guess 6 what? he never smoked again. 7 and he never does smoke again. 8 all right. 9 just for finish this on out, you know 10 about the rest of his care and treatment. 11 you know about him going to shands 12 hospital at the university of florida, looking 13 for a lung transplant. they say no, your 14 principal problem is asthma. 15 he goes to the mayo clinic to get a 16 second opinion. they accept him in their 17 program. he gets a lung transplant in 2010 and 18 2012 again. 19 all right. 20 now, let me take you to -- i think i did 21 that faster than in my opening. i think i did 22 it -- oops, oops. calm down. 23 all right. so let us look at the verdict 24 form. this is the exact order in which it is 25 going to occur. 1 was richard boatright addicted to philip 2 morris cigarettes containing nicotine, and if 3 so, was his addiction a legal cause of chronic 4 obstructive pulmonary disease that manifested 5 on or before november 21, 1996? 6 okay. really that is three questions at 7 once. let me put some periods in here so it is 8 easier to understand. 9 containing nicotine. that is question 1. 10 was he addicted to philip morris cigarettes 11 containing nicotine? 12 if so, was his addiction a legal cause of 13 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, copd, 14 that manifested -- so that is question number 2, 15 that is question number 1. 16 and here is question number 3 -- that 17 manifested on or before november 21, 1996? 18 if the answer to any of those three 19 questions is no, then the answer to this 20 question is no. 21 and as the form says, if your answer to 22 question 1 is no, please proceed no further 23 than to sign and date the verdict form and 24 return to the courtroom. 25 here is the form i told you about in my 1 opening statement. 2 in the '90s, and all the way up, i think 3 this is 2001 -- throughout the '90s, he sees 4 these 12 doctors. 5 and with the exception of dr. tabb for 6 one visit in 1992, he is the first one to look 7 at him. 8 dr. tabb says: you know, you have got 9 asthma. but he also says: i think you have 10 chronic bronchitis caused by smoking. 11 but no other doctor is going to come to 12 that same diagnosis; nobody. 13 and, in fact, dr. tabb sends 14 mr. boatright to see dr. catz, the 15 board-certified pulmonologist. he is an 16 allergist, and he sends mr. boatright to see a 17 pulmonologist. 18 in the medical records that you are going 19 to see, dr. -- 20 michael, i think i'm going to need a 21 little help. i think i got it. 22 dr. tabb sends mr. boatright to dr. catz. 23 dr. catz, in the medical records that we showed 24 you during the course of this trial, saw 25 dr. tabb's reference and said, no. and you will 1 see it in the written -- i'm not going to take 2 the time -- i do not have the time to take you 3 all the way back through the medical records. 4 dr. catz says, you know what? what he 5 has is mild bronchitis. 6 you guys all learned the difference 7 between chronic bronchitis and acute 8 bronchitis. 9 the court: mr. reilly, you have used 50 10 minutes. 11 mr. reilly: thank you, your honor. 12 you know that in order to have chronic 13 bronchitis -- and this came right out of the 14 publication of dr. mannino signed off on it, 15 their expert, you gotta have a cough with 16 sputum for at least three months at least two 17 years in a row. 18 and you know that dr. catz did not 19 diagnose him with chronic bronchitis, nor did 20 any other one of these doctors. 21 what did dr. catz say mr. boatright had? 22 and i realize that mr. boatright once 23 again has said something that is not in the 24 records. 25 he says that dr. catz told him that he 1 had emphysema. he told him that he had copd. 2 but fortunately, we do not have to rely on 3 mr. boatright's memory, do we? 4 because we have an actual letter. and 5 it is in those records that was sent to 6 mr. boatright on november 9, 1992, by dr. catz 7 telling him exactly what dr. catz actually 8 diagnosed him with. 9 and what did he tell him? 10 he said: you have asthma. that is the 11 explanation for your lung problems. and you 12 have allergic rhinitis. that is a runny nose 13 because of your allergies. 14 he does not say anything about chronic 15 bronchitis, did not say anything about 16 emphysema, or does he say you have copd. 17 and he treats him for his asthma. 18 again, i'm not going to take you through 19 all the medical records, but every one of these 20 doctors that are stated -- none of these 21 doctors say he has copd, emphysema or chronic 22 bronchitis. not one. 23 and you were told that dr. tabb sees 24 mr. boatright and diagnoses him three times in 25 a row with chronic bronchitis? 1 that is not right. he did it one time. 2 he sees him two more times, but for completely 3 different stuff. so i do not know why you were 4 told that. 5 now, yes, it is true there is an emergency 6 room record in which mr. boatright apparently 7 told somebody that he had asthma and emphysema. 8 but here he is in january 11, 1995, personally 9 filling out a new patient information sheet at 10 the watson clinic. 11 and he says, hey, i've got bronchitis, 12 asthma, and he does not say he has emphysema. 13 does not. 14 do his doctors specifically say what he 15 has? well, here is a great example of 16 dr. estupinan. judge radabaugh had to tell me 17 how to pronounce his name. i hope i got it 18 right. 19 september 7, 1996, he is ordering oxygen. 20 what disease is he ordering it for? he is 21 ordering it for chronic obstructive asthma. 22 in fact, on one of the slides that 23 plaintiff's counsel put up, he said in 1996 he 24 had obstructive lung disease. he does. 25 there it is right there. chronic 1 obstructive asthma. because asthma can prevent 2 you from being able to expel your air. 3 what he does not check is emphysema/copd, 4 chronic obstructive bronchitis. 5 he specifically does not check any of 6 those. 7 why not? because mr. boatright does not 8 have those diseases at this moment. 9 copd does not manifest -- i have nothing 10 against mr. schlesinger's shelties, but this is 11 not a no landing zone. this is what the 12 medical records show. 13 when is the first time that anybody even 14 hints at the possibility that there is something 15 else going on? 16 when is the first even possible 17 manifestation of copd? well, here it is. 18 this is dr. forman's pulmonary consult, 19 march 6, 2001. 20 and he says: severe obstructive airway 21 disease clinically compatible with asthma; 22 however, a possible component of cigarette 23 smoking causing fixed airway obstruction. 24 there it is. five years after the close 25 of that class. this is not a trampoline no 1 landing zone. this is the medical records in 2 this case. 3 and philip morris did not make them up. 4 this is record after record after record, and 5 they are all right there in that black binder. 6 here is a little chart of all the dates. 7 these are all the dates. 8 look at all the dates that he is seeing a 9 doctor. and many of these dates mr. boatright 10 is being asked: what is your problem, what are 11 you here for? 12 and his answer is: asthma. 13 many of those dates. that is what he 14 reports he is there for. and you will see it in 15 the records. asthma, asthma, asthma. 16 yes, i did bring you dr. schroeder, a 17 board-certified pulmonologist from california. 18 and what he said was, you know, what really is 19 helpful in this case to understand the timing 20 of when he had copd, when it became manifest is 21 to look at the physical evidence in the case. 22 the pulmonary function test, look at the ct 23 scans of the chest. look at the lung pictures. 24 by the way, the lung pictures. did you 25 notice that neither dr. mannino nor dr. illei 1 were given the lung pictures? that you saw. 2 and he said, look at the dance videos. 3 because dr. schroeder said, and you know -- 4 do we have just an image of the dance 5 video? 6 dr. schroeder said: if you have a 7 severely -- this is december 2007. 8 dr. schroeder said: if you have a 9 severe -- somebody who is suffering from severe 10 copd, from emphysema or chronic bronchitis, 11 they will not appear on the dance floor like 12 that, even if you tell me they walked off and 13 got oxygen. 14 six dances. he said asthmatics can do 15 that. why? because asthma is like this. it is 16 like that. some days you can do that, some 17 days you cannot. you cannot at all. 18 as a matter of fact, there is a medical 19 record that says mr. boatright, in 2008, is 20 still engaging in vigorous dancing activities. 21 the ct scans. 22 do you remember both dr. illei -- i hope 23 i'm pronouncing his name right -- and 24 dr. schroeder said, you know what? ct scans 25 are exquisitely sensitive to the appearance of 1 emphysema. 2 and here are four ct scans, 2004, minimal 3 paraseptal emphysematous change in the right 4 lung apex, top of the lung. right lung. 5 2006. mild apical emphysematous changes 6 seen bilaterally. 7 2008. ct scan of the chest, very minimal 8 upper lobe emphysematous changes. 9 2009. not even a year before the 10 surgery. mild emphysematous most pronounced in 11 the apices. 12 here is the surgeon general in 2014 13 helping you date the onset based on ct scans of 14 emphysema. 15 it says: visual analysis of the pattern 16 extent of emphysema can identify small amounts 17 of centrilobular emphysema usually in the upper 18 lobes -- usually in the upper lobes. that is 19 exactly where it was. 20 and he said: small amounts in the upper 21 lobes of persons who have minimal quantitative 22 emphysema. this appears to be the earliest 23 manifestations. my goodness, this is the very 24 language out of the surgeon general's report. 25 "earliest manifestations of lung structural 1 change associated with copd." 2 and there it is, that is exactly what the 3 ct scans are telling you in 2004, '06, '08, and 4 '09. 5 that is completely consistent with 6 dr. forman saying in 2001, five years after the 7 close of the class, this is the first time 8 there is even a suspicion, and then i only 9 brought out one lung picture. 10 but then dr. schroeder showed you right 11 here the very same thing that the ct scans were 12 showing, and that is very minimal upper lobe 13 emphysema. minimal, mild, mild, right there. 14 and you know what? neither dr. mannino 15 nor dr. illei showed you those lungs, because 16 they never even saw them. why did not they see 17 them? 18 dr. mannino. here is his testimony. 19 i said: yeah, you have seen all the 20 medical records you have and no doctor 21 indicates that they ever told mr. boatright he 22 had emphysema throughout the '90s, right? 23 correct. 24 that is their dr. mannino. here he is 25 again. 1 none of them, aside from dr. tabb on the 2 very first visit that he had, ever said to 3 mr. boatright that mr. boatright had emphysema, 4 chronic bronchitis or copd, did they? 5 dr. mannino, who said he looked at all 6 the medical records said: i do not know. 7 and i said: you say that if this is so 8 plain, that if none of them made that 9 diagnosis, they all missed it, did not they? 10 if, in fact, none of them made that 11 diagnosis, then yeah, they missed what i think 12 should have been an obvious diagnosis. 13 twelve doctors. they are all wrong. but 14 the difference between them and dr. mannino is, 15 guess what? they all actually saw doctor -- 16 they all actually saw mr. boatright. they all 17 listened to his chest. 18 this is dr. alvarez. they said that 19 dr. alvarez correlated all of this, and that 20 they did not do a lung transplant because of 21 asthma. 22 well, here's the question that was posed. 23 i said: am i correct that because it 24 was not of primary concern -- i did not ask this. 25 this was on video. 1 am i correct that because it was not a 2 primary concern, your group never really came 3 to a final determination as to what, if any, of 4 the conditions predominated? 5 no, we thought he had an asthmatic 6 component, and we thought he had copd as well. 7 okay. so you thought he had both? 8 yes, the best i can remember, yes. 9 did dr. alvarez treat mr. boatright? did 10 he examine him in the '90s? no, he does not see 11 him until he goes to the mayo clinic in the mid 12 2000s. 13 twelve treating physicians and 14 dr. schroeder said he had asthma. 15 eleven of them agreed with dr. schroeder. 16 that is what he is got, is just asthma. no 17 chronic bronchitis, no copd, no emphysema. 18 throughout the '90s. 19 and here is where we got real confusion. 20 dr. illei, their pathologist, said that he 21 thought it was predominantly emphysema with 22 minimal chronic bronchitis. 23 and dr. mannino said, no, no, he is got 24 chronic bronchitis. 25 what? 1 and this was dr. schroeder's testimony. 2 mr. boatright had end-stage obstructive lung 3 disease that in my opinion was primarily due to 4 asthma with fixed airflow obstruction. he did 5 have copd from smoking from 2000 on. proven by 6 the fact that in 2004, when he had his cat 7 scan, you saw emphysema. 8 and that is absolutely consistent with 9 dr. forman, the record i showed you from 10 dr. forman. 11 so what is the question -- what is the 12 answer to this question right here? did he 13 have copd, chronic bronchitis or emphysema that 14 manifested on or before november 21, 1996? 15 the answer is no. so you do not have to 16 worry about the rest of this question. because 17 all of those things have to exist in order for 18 the answer to be yes. 19 but that is why this got like five 20 minutes' coverage in closing argument by the 21 plaintiff. because that is what -- that is how 22 complex -- that is what the medical records show 23 in this case. and they are in evidence. 24 if for some reason all those records are 25 wrong, unanimously you guys say no, no, no, 1 that is wrong, then you do have to answer the 2 other two questions. 3 you know what? you do not get an 4 instruction from judge radabaugh as to how you 5 determine whether somebody is addicted. 6 yes, there are lots of instances where 7 there is a reference to him being dependent and 8 that sort of thing. 9 but the question does not end there. they 10 have to show that his addiction was the legal 11 cause of his copd. 12 for the last time, i'll do that. here is 13 a big old instruction telling you what you have 14 to figure out in order to determine whether or 15 not addiction was a legal cause of his copd. 16 this was not even mentioned to you. 17 and you cannot skip over it. you have got 18 to determine it, if you get this far. the 19 evidence does not, frankly, warrant that. 20 but if you do, you have got to make a 21 determination that addiction directly and in 22 natural and continuous sequence produced or 23 contributed substantially to producing his 24 copd. 25 so that it can be said that but for the 1 addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine, 2 the copd would not have occurred. 3 well, you have already been shown testimony 4 that was elicited by plaintiff's counsel that 5 indicated that mr. boatright had absolutely no 6 interest in quitting smoking until what, as 7 late as 1988, 1989? 8 so had they satisfied you that his copd 9 was substantially produced by addiction but for 10 addiction that he would not have gotten copd. 11 and if the answer to that question is no, 12 either one of these, if either one of those is 13 no, then the answer is no. your work is done. 14 and you sign and date the verdict form and 15 return to the courtroom. 16 if for some reason you guys unanimously 17 decide that is all wrong, i've got to go through 18 the rest of the verdict form, i'll do it pretty 19 quickly. 20 please state whether philip morris's 21 concealment or omission of material information 22 about the health effects or addictive nature of 23 smoking cigarettes or both was a legal cause of 24 richard boatright's copd. 25 i have not even seen this. 1 the concealment or omission of material 2 information not otherwise known or available or 3 the failure to disclose a material fact 4 concerning or proving health effects and/or 5 addictive nature of smoking cigarettes is a 6 legal cause of copd if it directly and in 7 natural and continuous sequence produces or 8 contributes substantially to produce copd so 9 that it can reasonably be said that but for -- 10 looks like it should have been a period 11 there -- but for the concealment, the copd 12 would not have occurred. 13 what does that require? that requires 14 that they prove to you that he would not have 15 gotten copd if philip morris -- he was 16 waiting -- basically that says he was waiting 17 to hear something from philip morris. 18 and if he would only heard something from 19 philip morris, he would have changed direction, 20 changed his mind and not smoked or he would 21 have quit sooner than he did. 22 was there any evidence in that whole 23 story that i just walked you through, was there 24 any of that really and truly? are you 25 convinced of that? 1 and they have to show that plaintiffs 2 relied -- or plaintiff's reliance on 3 defendants' concealment or omission of material 4 information to be a legal cause. you have to 5 unanimously find that he reasonably relied on 6 statements by philip morris that omitted 7 material information. 8 well, in light of that personal story, is 9 there any chance of that? 10 and in order for there to be -- in order 11 for that to be a legal cause, this is a little 12 diagram that i use to sort of give you a sense 13 of the requirement of legal cause. 14 whatever they are complaining about, was 15 there really a direct connection between 16 mr. boatright and the decisions that he made? 17 did he see it? did he hear it? 18 they showed you "death in the west." 19 but, mrs. boatright -- you know the 20 cowboy movie where the cowboys are supposed to 21 be sick and all that. 22 but i asked mrs. boatright: you never 23 saw that? 24 no. 25 your husband never saw that? 1 no. 2 so why show it? i mean, this is 3 mr. boatright's case, right? 4 not only has there got to be a direct 5 connection, but as i said, there has to be a 6 substantial impact. and then it can be a legal 7 cause. 8 the court: mr. reilly, you have used 70 9 minutes. 10 mr. reilly: that means i have about 10 11 left to give counsel her 10. 12 all right. let me hurry on through here. 13 all right. same applies to this 14 concealment question. the answer to these 15 questions are no, frankly, both for philip 16 morris and liggett. the same instruction 17 applies. 18 i will not take the time to go through it 19 again, because it is the same thing, basically. 20 and then that would bring you, if you get 21 this far -- and again, i think the evidence has 22 indicated otherwise, but if you get this far, 23 you have to assign percentages of 24 responsibility, legal cause for mr. boatright's 25 copd. 1 i think it was mr. hammer who said, oh, 2 goodness, mr. boatright deserves ten percent, 5 3 to ten percent, if you get this far. 4 in light of this personal story? this is 5 not a class action. in light of this personal 6 story, if you got this far, what percentage of 7 responsibility would you assign to 8 mr. boatright? i leave that to you guys. 9 i do not think you will get here, but if 10 you did. 11 what is the total amount of damages? if 12 you get this far, you have to address damages. 13 what is the total amount of mr. boatright's 14 damages for lost earnings in the past, loss of 15 earnings in the future, past medical expense, 16 future medical expense? 17 the only person that came and talked 18 about that subject was the guy named padron, 19 right? do you remember him? 20 he was the cpa. he did not have any 21 numbers that he created. he just was bringing 22 numbers down to present day value. right? 23 he relied entirely on a report by a guy 24 named mr. morris who did not come here and 25 explain a thing. 1 but what you did learn was that in 2 reaching a conclusion about his future medical 3 expenses, mr. morris did not talk to anybody 4 involved in giving care and treatment to 5 mr. boatright. 6 who did he talk to? he talked to their 7 expert, dr. mannino. 8 why would not you talk to the people that 9 are actually giving him care? and when he was 10 calculating his past lost wages, future lost 11 pages, he made an adding and dividing by two 12 mistake that i caught? 13 if you saw my math skills, you would 14 laugh. funnier than the hat on dr. -- what is 15 his cookie's head -- schroeder's head. i mean, 16 they make a $100,000 mistake. 17 he did not consider the effect of 18 medicare, did not base his numbers on the pay 19 that mr. boatright actually earned. 20 there is a schedule in there of what 21 mr. boatright actually earned. 22 and yes, mr. hammer did ask 23 mr. boatright: hey, did you make $39,000 a 24 year? 25 and mr. boatright said: yes, i did. 1 but you can see his actual earnings. 2 they are in evidence in that report from that 3 guy, mr. morris. 4 so where did he get these numbers? 5 frankly, i think the answer to this one is they 6 have a burden of proof here, and i think they 7 wholly failed to satisfy their burden of proof. 8 wholly. 9 and you heard about the lakeland 10 ballroom. mrs. boatright said they are not 11 doing business in lakeland, and they -- here is 12 their face page. 13 here is their lakeland jacksonville 14 ballroom website. it says, lakeland ballroom 15 has been teaching lakeland and polk county to 16 dance since '93. they are now teaching and 17 expanding into the jacksonville area. read 18 more. 19 here is the question where it says, what 20 is the total amount of damages for pain and 21 suffering? i leave that to your sound 22 discretion if you get here. 23 that is true for -- obviously they would 24 like to receive millions and millions of 25 dollars if you get here. again, i leave that 1 to your sound discretion, if you got here. 2 the same for mrs. boatright. same 3 situation. 4 and that brings us to the final question 5 on this verdict form, and that is: under the 6 circumstances of this case, please state 7 whether you find by clear and convincing 8 evidence that punitive damages are warranted. 9 you did get the definition of clear and 10 convincing. in light of the lack of connection 11 between philip morris and mr. boatright, other 12 than he liked their ads and he liked their 13 cigarettes the best. 14 remember, i just showed you that board a 15 little while ago that said he liked the taste, 16 he liked the strength? 17 and, yeah, they said he switched to 18 marlboro lights, but for what, a week? that is 19 what his wife said, or maybe two. 20 and during that same period of time, he 21 smoked a bunch of other cigarette brands. 22 this has to be something that relates to 23 mr. boatright. mr. boatright. 24 who came in and testified about that? 25 who came in and complained about philip morris 1 and his conduct? 2 well, it was dr. proctor. it was 3 dr. proctor. 4 you remember dr. proctor. he is the guy 5 that said, oh, you ought to make cigarettes -- 6 the fda is not doing anything. the national 7 institutes of health, not doing anything. 8 national cancer institute, not doing anything. 9 they ought to do what i say, should be 10 done. remember that? 11 they ought to make cigarettes that have 12 .1 milligrams of nicotine in the rod and make 13 it so that the ph of smoke is 8. 14 and i do not know why they are spending all 15 that time, energy and money figuring out how 16 cigarettes need to be advertised, made, 17 et cetera. 18 and he acknowledged that philip morris 19 actually asked for this legislation to be 20 passed going all the way back to 2000. wrote a 21 letter to president obama, said please pass 22 this. 23 and the fda, national institutes of 24 health, national cancer institute are funding 25 $275 million worth of research to figure out 1 how cigarettes ought to be advertised, 2 manufactured, et cetera. 3 dr. proctor said, that is completely 4 unnecessary. just do as i say. 5 he was critical of having financed nobel 6 laureates for their medical research, looking 7 at the genetic basis for things like cancer. 8 not everything that philip morris ever did -- i 9 told you in the very beginning, i would not 10 stand up here and support everything they ever 11 did, and i will not. 12 right -- with dr. proctor. i said, you 13 know, that dow deal was just bad, bad. they 14 should never have said to dow, do not do that. 15 but you know what? did that have 16 anything to do with mr. boatright? absolutely 17 not. 18 did mr. boatright get nicorette gum 19 whenever he wanted it? yeah. 20 and if you look at the medical records, 21 he did not want it. 22 but that is exactly -- and why does 23 dr. proctor get $2.2 million? why is he 24 testifying here and there and everywhere? 25 $50,000 a week? because he comes in and says 1 stuff like that. that is a no-brainer. 2 that is a no-brainer. 3 all right. i think the answer -- the 4 evidence shows that the answer on this 5 entitlement to punitive damages -- and by the 6 way, this money goes where? 7 it goes to the boatrights, right? that is 8 it. 9 what is the answer to this question? no 10 and no. 11 and then you will work, if you even got 12 that far -- i think the first question is where 13 this whole thing ends. 14 but if you disagree and you have to work 15 your way all the way through this, then that is 16 where you end up. 17 if you answer no to these questions, then 18 no, there is not a tomorrow. there is not a 19 second phase. you do not come back. your work 20 is done. 21 if you answer yes, though, to these -- to 22 this question, then yes, you do come back, 23 there is more work, there is no evidence. 24 there is no instructions. there is more of 25 everything. 1 but does not the evidence in this case, in 2 light of this case, not some class actions, 3 just this case, is not that where this all ends 4 up? 5 now, i have to sit down. 6 ann st. peter is going to get up and 7 address you on behalf of liggett. 8 but then mr. schlesinger is going to get 9 back up. he is got another 15 minutes, and he 10 gets to go again. 11 now, i do not know what cute images he is 12 going to have, but he gets to go again because 13 he has the burden of proof. he has to persuade 14 you that -- and he said, you know, the scales 15 of justice, he does not just have to tip them a 16 little. he is got to bring a bigger mountain of 17 evidence than i just showed you on these 18 issues. not just a scintilla of evidence. 19 he is got to bring a bigger mountain of evidence 20 than i just showed you. 21 mr. hammer: objection, judge, that is not 22 the standard. 23 the court: sustained. 24 mr. reilly: maybe it is not a mountain. 25 he showed a mountain. i said a mountain. 1 he has to bring a greater weight of 2 evidence than i did, whether it is a mountain or 3 a molehill. he is got to have greater weight of 4 the evidence than i showed you, except on this 5 last issue, which is he is got to do it with 6 precise evidence. 7 all right. so all i would say is, 8 please, just ask yourselves, what has this got 9 to do with mr. boatright's case. that is all. 10 i greatly appreciate your attention. 11 you have been great. 12 thank you. 9 ms. st. peter-griffith: may it please 10 the court, counsel, mr. and mrs. boatright. 11 ladies and gentlemen of the jury, good 12 afternoon. 13 jurors: good afternoon. 14 ms. st. peter-griffith: thank you, 15 again, for your service. 16 i'm ann st. peter-griffith, and it is my 17 privilege to be representing liggett group, 18 llc, in this matter. 19 to begin with, i need to stress with you 20 there is only one tort count that you will 21 consider against my client. and that is the 22 conspiracy count. 23 mr. reilly has done an excellent job 24 detailing the evidence for you and giving you a 25 roadmap to checking "no" as to each question on 1 the jury verdict form as to both defendants, 2 and we agree. 3 before i talk about my client, what i 4 would like to do is take you back to one of the 5 very first witnesses, danielle boatright 6 smiddy. mr. hammer showed you some of her 7 testimony. 8 what i would like for you to do is 9 remember the very last question that i asked 10 her on cross-examination. 11 she gave testimony in a deposition. and 12 i had to take her back to that testimony until 13 she finally admitted that she testified earlier 14 that her father only told her that asthma was 15 the condition that he had. 16 and what is that testimony consistent 17 with? medical record after medical record 18 after medical record that mr. reilly has gone 19 through with you in this case. 20 switching gears a little bit to my 21 client. plaintiffs and dr. proctor would have 22 you believe that all of the tobacco companies 23 since 1953 have been conspiring, working as 24 co-conspirators who worked in concert to hide 25 the ball from mr. boatright and the public. 1 dr. proctor, however, had to admit 2 certain facts concerning my client. he did so 3 in cross-examination. 4 liggett publicly acknowledged the health 5 effects of smoking and that smoking was 6 addictive. 7 in fact, liggett put on its packaging the 8 warning "smoking is addictive." 9 my client did not attend the plaza hotel 10 meeting. it did not hire hill & knowlton. it 11 did not participate in or publish the frank 12 statement. it never belonged to an 13 organization named tirc. 14 liggett only belonged to the organization 15 known as ctr, or council for tobacco research, 16 for a little under four years in the mid-1960s, 17 and then it dissociated itself. 18 as dr. proctor admits, liggett's total 19 contribution to the tobacco institute was 20 0.3 percent of all industry contributions, 0.3 21 percent. 22 now, ladies and gentlemen, what i have 23 before you here is liggett's evidence. 24 madam clerk has kindly put blue tabs on 25 it, so it is easily identifiable. you are going 1 to take this back with you. you are not going 2 to take the big screen back with you. you are 3 going to take this evidence back with you. 4 in the 1950s and '60s, liggett undertook 5 an extensive multi-year research regarding the 6 relationship between smoking and health risks. 7 as dr. proctor admitted, that investment 8 was more than the rest of the industry 9 combined. 10 that is not to say philip morris and the 11 other companies did not do research. they did. 12 the first document i'll show you. it is a 13 big one. you will be glad to know i'm not going 14 to ask you to read all 700-plus pages. 15 this was the compilation of liggett's 16 research that was handed over in 1963 to the 17 number one public health authority, the surgeon 18 general, for assistance in the surgeon 19 general's report. 20 now, you will remember the 1964 surgeon 21 general's report. you heard about that. it 22 was a very, very big deal. it was very, very 23 public. and it led to cautions and warnings on 24 cigarette packaging. 25 i would just like to highlight a few 1 points of what is in evidence in this document. 2 in volume 1. liggett's researchers 3 concluded there was a gross statistical 4 association that existed between smoking, 5 cancer, and death. 6 the entire volume 3 is dedicated to the 7 carcinogenic or cancer-causing links to harmful 8 components in cigarette smoke. 9 and, finally, just as another example. 10 appendix 8 of volume 3 includes a chapter 11 regarding habituation and addiction. 12 my client gave all of this to the surgeon 13 general in 1963, before mr. boatright ever 14 started smoking. 15 and liggett published critical portions 16 of this report. 17 and by the way, there is nothing in the 18 arthur d. little l&m perspective document that 19 my client did not disclose in this research. 20 just briefly, the other tabs, we have also 21 put into evidence documents that established 22 that liggett's research was not a secret to the 23 public health community. 24 as early as 1954, liggett's researchers 25 were meeting with the american cancer society. 1 in liggett's exhibit 6965, the u.s. 2 department of agriculture's top tobacco 3 researcher praised liggett for ten years of 4 productive collaboration. 5 and, finally, exhibit 219, the surgeon 6 general expressed the surgeon general's special 7 gratitude for the tremendous time, effort, and 8 expense expended in the production of liggett's 9 research for the surgeon general. 10 now, ladies and gentlemen, for all the 11 millions of documents that dr. proctor told you 12 he had access to, dr. proctor did not tell you 13 about these documents. 14 plaintiffs did not tell you about these 15 documents. 16 what is that expression that paul harvey 17 used to have? now you know the rest of the 18 story. 19 my client was not hiding the ball. and 20 plaintiffs certainly have not made any showing 21 that liggett's conduct was a but-for cause of 22 mr. boatright's claims, the injuries that he 23 claims. 24 nor has plaintiff shown by clear and 25 convincing evidence. you heard that is a pretty 1 high standard -- that my client engaged in any 2 intentional conduct that would warrant punitive 3 damages entitlement. 4 and the same is true for philip morris. 5 before i conclude, i would just like to 6 say that we understand that serious illness can 7 be difficult for an individual and his family. 8 it is understandable to empathize, to a 9 degree. 10 however, when we began this process, as 11 jurors you took an oath, and under that oath 12 you promised to follow the evidence and base 13 your decision only upon the evidence. 14 as judge radabaugh will tell you, you 15 should not be influenced by bias, sympathy, 16 prejudice, or public opinion. 17 you saw mr. boatright on the stand. he 18 made his own decisions. and we ask that you 19 render a verdict in favor of liggett and philip 20 morris. 21 on behalf of my client, myself, philip 22 morris, the entire defense team and everyone 23 who has been here with you for the past three 24 weeks, thank you again for your time, for your 25 patience, for the careful attention that you have 1 paid to the evidence, and for your service on 2 this jury. 3 thank you.
