17 mr. hammer: thank you, judge. may it 18 please the court, counsel. 19 trial by jury, the best of safeguards for 20 the person and property of every individual. 21 thomas jefferson said that in 1823, and it 22 stands true today. and tomorrow being veterans 23 day, where our men and women are honored for 24 fighting for our freedoms, one of those 25 freedoms is the trial by jury. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 and i want to thank you all for staying 2 with us and coming back this week to hear our 3 final arguments and make a decision in this 4 case. 5 take it down. 6 it is been over 20 years since richard 7 found out he had copd. 8 it is been over 20 years since richard 9 found out he had the lungs of an 88-year-old 10 man. 11 it is been over 20 years since richard 12 found out if he does not stop smoking, he will 13 die. that is why we are here today. 14 back in 1992, he was told that. he was 15 told that these things, these cigarettes, is 16 what caused his disease. he was told that by 17 dr. tabb. 18 and for the next 18 years of his life, 19 after being told that, he struggled with 20 addiction. 21 for the next 18 years, he knew this is 22 what caused his disease, and he knew it then in 23 1992. no doubt about it. 24 now, nearly every doctor that saw richard 25 talked about his addiction. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 keith, go to slide 2, please. 2 he tried all sorts of things. he tried 3 medications that were prescribed to him, but he 4 also tried at the first just quitting. 5 remember, he talked about how -- he said: 6 i thought i could always put them down and 7 never look back. could not do that. could not 8 quit cold turkey. 9 he tried cutting back. he tried throwing 10 away ashtrays. he tried hypnosis. he tried 11 chinese cupping therapy. he tried the patches, 12 he tried the gum, when they were still 13 prescription. he tried zyban and wellbutrin. 14 look at all the times he was prescribed 15 those things by his doctors. he tried very 16 hard to quit. but he could not quit. 17 slide 3, keith. 18 slide 4. 19 nearly every single doctor that saw him 20 made a reference to this man's addiction. 21 called it a bunch of different things: tobacco 22 abuse, persistent tobacco abuse, tobacco 23 addiction, chronic cigarette abuse, tobacco use 24 disorder, smoking dependence, tobaccoism. 25 they all said he was addicted. they all united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 said it. and richard knew it. that is why he 2 was fighting so hard to quit. 3 throughout the years, he quit for brief 4 periods of time. but every time that hook 5 brought him back in. he tried to quit. he 6 really did. 7 now, it took him ten years of constant 8 effort to finally quit. and in 2003, he did. 9 you can take that down, keith. 10 he did, with the help of what? being in 11 the hospital, getting wellbutrin and tranxene. 12 tranxene is a powerful benzodiazepine. 13 like xanax or valium. but it is actually more 14 powerful than that. it is used to help people 15 kick withdrawals, the dts. 16 it finally worked. that is what it took 17 for this man to finally be able to quit. 18 of course, one of the things we must 19 prove to you is richard was addicted. i think 20 it is pretty clear that he was. based upon what 21 every doctor said, based upon what he told us. 22 we have to prove that his addiction 23 caused him to smoke these cigarettes, the 24 marlboro cigarettes, made by philip morris. 25 that is what he smoked pretty much all his united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 life. it caused him to get the copd that 2 ultimately resulted in replacing his lungs. 3 and that copd absolutely manifested 4 itself on or before november 21, 1996, because 5 dr. tabb found it in 1992. 6 slide number 6. 7 dr. tabb, in his report -- number 6. 8 thank you -- wrote: chronic bronchitis 9 secondary to tobacco abuse. chronic 10 bronchitis, copd. as a result of smoking these 11 things. 12 that is what dr. tabb wrote in his record 13 in '92. 14 and then in november, slide number 7, 15 please. 16 dr. catz, in his own report, he wrote: 17 flow volume loop is compatible with copd. he is 18 got an estimated lung age of 88 years. 19 and he told richard: you have got 20 emphysema, you have got to quit. 21 richard knew it. 22 slide number 8. 23 he told us. when did you know you had 24 it? 25 i knew i had copd caused by cigarette united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 smoke in 1992. 2 and lungs. lungs of an 88-year-old man. 3 i was 39 years old at the time. 4 that is what he testified to. and debbie 5 knew it. 6 next slide. number 9. 7 at that point, did you know exactly -- 8 what did they explain to you and richard what 9 the copd was from. 10 they explained to me at that time, in 11 1992, it was from smoking. 12 and danielle, who was just an infant at 13 the time. can you describe for us your 14 earliest recollections of your dad? 15 probably when i was 4 or 5, growing up, 16 he always smelled like smoke. it was always 17 known that my dad had copd. ever since i 18 remember. being 4 or 5 years old. 19 she was born in 1989. '93, '94, she was 20 4 or 5 years old. that is what she knew all her 21 life. 22 and now richard sits here before you, as 23 directed by the supreme court. he was hoping 24 he would be around long enough to present this 25 case to you, and fortunately he is, as a result united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 of these double lung transplants. 2 it is a miracle that he is here, and we 3 will talk about that a lot. 4 but he sits here now, and we are -- scott 5 and i, brittany, we are proud to represent 6 richard and debbie and be able to present their 7 case, and we thank you for that opportunity 8 from the bottom of our hearts, and debbie and 9 richard thank you. they really do. 10 because what you are doing here is 11 tremendous, and we appreciate it. 12 we are asking you to determine that 13 richard is a member of the class. 14 slide number 14. 15 the issue that you first have to decide 16 is, was richard boatright addicted to philip 17 morris cigarettes containing nicotine? 18 and if so, was his addiction a legal 19 cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 20 copd, that manifested on or before november 21, 21 1996? 22 that is the issue, that is the first issue. 23 the question is whether he smoked enough 24 cigarettes to develop a disease because of his 25 addiction. that is what this case is about. it united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 should be very simple, that first question. 2 and then once you answer yes, which we 3 hope you will, we move on to the engle 4 findings, the issue of compensation, the issue 5 of percentage of fault and the issue of whether 6 or not these companies, both of these 7 companies, liggett and philip morris, should be 8 punished for their actions and their conduct 9 over those years. 10 now, the defense says no, it is not that 11 simple. 12 mr. reilly, ms. st. peter-griffith, 13 they are going to stand up here and say no, it is 14 not that simple. 15 because we are going to tell you, 16 mr. boatright, he did not have copd in the '90s, 17 he did not have emphysema in the '90s. 18 they are going to tell you, his addiction, 19 that did not cause disease. his choice to smoke 20 caused his disease. he could have quit any 21 day. that is what they will tell you. 22 but we all know the truth. the truth is 23 richard tried to quit, and it took a 24 combination of wellbutrin and tranxene, a very 25 powerful drug, to make this man quit. it united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 was not until that, all those years, ten years 2 of trying, and he really did try. 3 but that is how addictive. that is how 4 addictive these things are. it is a drug. 5 now, the defense also will tell you, hey, 6 you know what? he did not have the copd. 7 dr. tabb, was wrong, dr. catz was wrong. 8 when richard told the doctors at the er 9 in '94 that i have emphysema, no, he was wrong. 10 those doctors are wrong. 11 listening to dr. schroeder, who came in 12 and told you no, this man only had asthma, he 13 did not have copd. 14 and despite the fact that the mayo 15 clinic, one of the top institutes in the world, 16 best hospitals in the world, they took out this 17 man's lungs because of what, because of 18 emphysema. 19 and we brought forth dr. illei from one 20 of the other top hospitals in the world, 21 johns hopkins. he told you those lungs, when i 22 looked at the slides, not pictures, when i 23 looked at slides of the actual tissue that they 24 took out of this man, it showed emphysema. 25 mayo clinic did not give richard boatright united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 a transplant for asthma. 2 slide number 13. 3 when they took out his lungs, dr. khoor 4 from the mayo clinic, what did she say? 5 dr. khoor: emphysema and chronic 6 bronchitis. looking at the same slides that 7 dr. illei looked at. 8 not some picture that dr. schroeder 9 looked at and said, oh, i see emphysema at the 10 apex, there is very mild ... but this man had 11 asthma. 12 come on. that is absurd. 13 and i'm sure mr. schlesinger will talk 14 more about dr. schroeder and how absurd his 15 opinion is. but you as the jury have every 16 right to discount his testimony. the judge 17 read you that instruction. 18 you can take that down, keith. 19 thank you. 20 so after 18 years, from first hearing 21 from his doctors that he had copd, he ends up 22 on an operating table at mayo clinic. and they 23 remove his lungs. and they put in a set of 24 lungs from a 17-year-old boy who just happened 25 to die shortly before that, who fortunately was united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 an organ donor. 2 and unfortunately, just weeks after the 3 surgery, richard's body started to reject the 4 lungs. went into rejection. that happens from 5 lung transplant. that is a major risk. 6 for the next 18 months, he struggled 7 every day with breathing. he struggled every 8 day with the fear that he may not get a second 9 set of lungs. he struggled every day with the 10 anxiety that i'm going to be facing another 11 surgery. 12 he described how painful that first one 13 was. he described how they basically cut him 14 open like a can opener, scars here and here, 15 scars, angel wings in the back. that is what 16 he is got. he is scarred for the rest of his 17 life. 18 but you know what? he is got new lungs in 19 his body and now he is breathing. he is very, 20 very fortunate. 21 very rare, very uncommon. second lung 22 transplant. and he lives every day with the 23 fear that the slightest sniffle, the slightest 24 infection, can kill him. that is a fear he 25 lives with every day, and that is a fear that united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 debbie lives with every day. 2 that is a tremendous burden. that is why 3 we are asking you for compensation. 4 because this company, these cigarettes, 5 that is what did it to him. nobody chooses -- 6 nobody chooses that. 7 slide number -- actually, do not need a 8 slide yet. 9 the defense will try to convince you 10 otherwise. mr. reilly will get up here. he will 11 speak to you. he is a great lawyer. great 12 lawyer, very persuasive. 13 do not let him confuse you with his 14 argument, because the evidence, the evidence 15 speaks volumes. 16 we put together -- i mean, you saw a 17 dozen or so boxes of medical records. for 18 brevity, we put together some of the key 19 medical records. it is all tabbed by year. 20 it is tabbed also by the records that were 21 used with dr. alvarez, by dr. mannino, 22 dr. illei, and mr. boatright. so easy access 23 to the medical records for you. 24 we do not expect you to go through 40,000 25 records to find one that you might be united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 interested in. and they are all chronological. 2 as i said, they are all tabbed with dates. 3 now, he will get up here, mr. reilly will 4 get up here and say, hey, as i said, this 5 was not addiction, it was his choice. but we 6 all know. 7 slide number 15. 8 their own documents say we cannot defend 9 continued smoking as "free choice" if the 10 person was addicted. they knew that back in 11 1980. their own documents said that. 12 but really, what person ever chooses 13 addiction? richard smoked these things for 38 14 years. not because he liked them, not because 15 he enjoyed them, but because he was addicted to 16 them. he was dependent on the nicotine. 17 that is what these things do to you. they hook 18 you. 19 and again, there is been a lot of talk 20 about choice, and mr. reilly will probably talk 21 about it, it was his choice, he could have quit 22 any day. 23 but really, could he have? he certainly 24 did try. and that goes to comparative fault. 25 it does not go to whether or not his addiction united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 caused his disease. because we all know it 2 did. 3 slide number 12. 4 this. how addiction causes disease, 8 5 puffs a cigarette. 5 million lifetime 6 exposures to chemicals to cause disease. 7 that is how these things cause disease. 8 does not matter about his ability to 9 quit -- you can take that down. 10 does not matter if he did quit, does not 11 matter when he did quit. what matters is he 12 smoked these things enough to give him disease. 13 that is what question 1 is all about. 14 i'm going to talk to you a little bit and 15 then scott is going to talk to you about their 16 conduct. i'm going to try not to be 17 repetitive. hopefully we will not be. 18 you heard a lot of things throughout this 19 day -- throughout the past few weeks, rather, 20 and sometimes we were repetitive. 21 we apologize for that, but we do not know 22 what you want to hear. we try to put forward 23 the evidence that is necessary to convince you. 24 hopefully we did that. 25 but i apologize to you up front if we united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 took too much time, and i apologize to you if 2 you think scott and i covered the same topics. 3 we are going to try not to do that. 4 as i said, we all know people smoke -- 5 some people do smoke for enjoyment. they will 6 smoke a cigarette or two a day, not smoke for a 7 while, because they like the taste. 8 but, you know, people that smoke a pack, 9 two, three, they are not smoking for the taste 10 anymore. they are not smoking because they 11 enjoy it. they smoke because they need these 12 things. they need the nicotine that is inside. 13 that is what this is. it is a nicotine 14 delivery device. you saw the documents. 15 that is all it is. delivers the dose of 16 nicotine to keep somebody addicted. 17 the choice of a child, 12 years old, to 18 pick one of these things up to be cool, along 19 with his friends. that is a choice richard 20 boatright made. stupid, yeah. but he is a kid. 21 kids do stupid things. 22 the choice to keep on smoking to be cool, 23 to fit in. by the time -- shortly after 24 starting, he was smoking a pack a day. 25 riding his bike, collecting bottles, united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 picking up bottles a nickel at a time, crates 2 at a time for a quarter. turning them in to 3 buy one of these packs. 4 back in those days, you could get them 5 for just 25 cents. pretty good deal. five 6 bottles, i get my cigarettes. 7 and it was cool back then. and it was 8 cool all through the '60s and '70s, and into 9 the '80s, people were still smoking without a 10 thought. that is what people did back then. 11 and even when donna hernandez, his wife, 12 who was a nurse tells him, hey, look, i'm 13 dealing with patients all the time that get 14 sick from this stuff, you have got to quit. he is 15 in his 20s. the guy is dancing 15 hours a day. 16 he is in great shape. these things are never 17 going to hurt me. i'm not worried about it. 18 and what happens? he goes to the 19 hospital to pick her up, and the doctors are 20 walking out, smoking away. in the hospital. 21 so come on. is he really going to 22 believe that? is he really going to think i'm 23 going to end up having to wear a mask every day 24 so i do not get infection because i could die 25 with my next breath if an infection gets inside united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 me? 2 is he thinking that when he is 20 years 3 old? of course not. 4 now, richard started smoking -- slide 5 number 16 -- with these ads, okay. these 6 ads -- these ads took him down that path. he 7 became cowboy, rode that trail with the 8 marlboro man, just like they wanted him to. 9 now, i want to talk about -- go back to 10 the verdict form, keith. 11 the first slide, the first question. was 12 he addicted? of course he was. 13 so i want you to check off yes so we can 14 move on to the findings, and scott will talk to 15 you about the findings. 16 the judge read to you the findings, and 17 the judge explained to you legal cause. 18 listen carefully to that. were these 19 cigarettes a legal cause? was it a reason that 20 richard smoked cigarettes? of course. 21 i want to talk to you about -- skipping 22 ahead a little bit. 23 i want to talk to you about the damages 24 in the case. richard, he loved dancing. he 25 loved life. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 show the next picture. 2 look at this. this is what the guy 3 looked like. do you think he ever thought 4 cigarettes were going to hurt him when he was 5 20 years old? he was bulletproof. 6 that is what kids think. that is what 7 young men think. never going to get sick. 8 imagine -- imagine this. you heard that 9 richard saw joe cullman. he saw joe cullman on 10 "face the nation." imagine if joe cullman had 11 said: listen, folks, our cigarettes, they are 12 going to kill you. i represent philip morris, 13 and i know there is a lot of smokers out there. 14 but listen, i want to tell you the truth right 15 now, our cigarettes will kill you. so we are 16 going to set up smoking clinics. we are going 17 to cooperate with dow chemical, and we are going 18 to make nicorette gum available to everybody so 19 you can quit before this stuff kills you. 20 in 1971, when richard watched joe 21 cullman, he said this instead. 22 play it real quick, keith. 23 (the video clip was played and taken down 24 to the best of the reporter's ability as 25 follows:) united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 voice: we do not believe that cigarettes 2 are hazardous, we do not accept that. because 3 when, as, and if any ingredient in cigarette 4 smoke is identified as being injurious to human 5 health, we are confident that we can eliminate 6 that ingredient. 7 (video clip concluded.) 8 mr. hammer: for that reason alone -- 9 go to the verdict form, keith, on 10 concealment. 11 if they told the truth, if they did not 12 agree back in 1954, we would not be here. it 13 would be a different world that richard grew up 14 in. 15 so, of course, yes, he relied on those 16 statements. he relied on them because if they 17 would have said something else, things would 18 have been different. and richard told you that 19 in his own testimony. 20 so check off. 21 and liggett, they are just as responsible 22 for that conspiracy, because they were involved 23 with all those other corporations. they were 24 responsible. 25 go to the percentage. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 now, you are going to be asked, well, what 2 percentage of fault? 3 well, philip morris as compared to 4 richard. richard, a 12-year-old kid started 5 smoking, philip morris a big corporation that 6 knew better. 7 i would suggest 5 or ten percent for 8 richard. 9 ninety percent, at least ninety percent for 10 philip morris. 11 they need to take responsibility for 12 their actions. 13 you are going to be asked, well, how much 14 money should we give? how do you determine? 15 first of all, we heard from oscar padron 16 the different options. you heard the life 17 tables, he is expected to live about 20 years if 18 he is a normal white male of this age, so we 19 figured out the 20-year period. 20 and we also figured out a five-year 21 period. because you heard after a lung 22 transplant, possible five years. 23 but we think, you know what? in today's 24 world. advances in science, advances in 25 medicine, who knows. so i would ask you to united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 consider -- 2 next form, keith. 3 -- option 2. which we said the 1.7 4 million. i think that is reasonable under the 5 circumstances. 6 we are going to ask you to compensate 7 richard for his pain, for his suffering, for 8 what he went through. 9 you are -- you heard what he went 10 through, cut open like a can opener. pain 11 every day, the fear of dying every day. what 12 is that worth? 13 all the pain and suffering he went 14 through. 15 skip ahead, keith. 16 i would ask you to consider awarding 17 $10 million in this case to richard boatright. 18 i think that is fair and reasonable. 19 now, you may think it is too much. you 20 may think it is too little. but we think that is 21 fair and reasonable under the circumstances. 22 two lung transplants. the pain this man went 23 through. 24 that is reasonable under the 25 circumstances. it is a miracle he is alive united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 today. and he thanks his lucky stars every 2 day. 3 debbie, the pain and suffering that 4 debbie goes through. she is been there every 5 step of the way with richard. we would ask you 6 to consider 2.5 million. we think that is fair 7 and reasonable. 8 again, you may think that is too little; 9 that is too much. it is your decision. those 10 are suggestions we have for you. 11 and then when it comes to punitive 12 damages. are punitive damages warranted 13 against each of these companies? of course 14 they are. 15 scott is going to talk to you a lot about 16 that. we would ask you to check off yes to 17 both of those companies. 18 because if you are going to be a company 19 in this country, you are going to make a 20 product. you are going to make a product, then 21 make a safe one, not one that kills half its 22 users. that is just wrong, and they should be 23 punished for that. 24 i want to thank you very much for your 25 time. scott is going to talk to you for a united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 little while. please give him the same 2 attention. 3 and, again, the boatrights thank you. 22 mr. schlesinger: may it please the 23 court. 24 judgment day. a day of reckoning. a 25 reckoning is an accounting for past wrongdoing. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 i'm going to take you back to the days before 2 we had medical testimony, and i'm going to talk 3 about conduct testimony and the conduct of the 4 tobacco industry insofar as what it is done in 5 the united states. 6 and when we talk about a day of 7 reckoning, it is because i want to talk to you 8 about the punitive damages count. 9 and i want to explain to you why this is 10 a case that calls for punitive damages because 11 of what is gone on with regard to reprehensible 12 conduct of an industry that placed profit over 13 human lives and did so with knowledge, 14 aforethought, did so intentionally, did so on 15 purpose. 16 and one of the ways to say it is that the 17 tobacco industry and the choice between the 18 physical health of consumers and the financial 19 well-being of business. concealment is chosen 20 over disclosure. sales over safety and money 21 over morality. 22 who are these persons who knowingly and 23 secretly decide to put the buying public at 24 risk solely for the purpose of making profits 25 and who believe that illness and death of united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 consumers is an appropriate cost of their own 2 prosperity? 3 so when i say to you today we stand on 4 the precipice of something that is great, that 5 is larger than ourselves, that is an 6 opportunity to use the american justice system 7 to bring to bear equivalent playing field 8 between an enormous powerful corporation and -- 9 mr. reilly: objection. 10 mr. schlesinger: -- regular folks in the 11 community -- 12 the court: overruled. 13 mr. schlesinger: and dr. proctor 14 testified about the power of the corporation. 15 you all are entitled to take into 16 consideration what they have done, what it is done 17 not only to the folks here in the courtroom, to 18 mr. boatright, who is a living example of a 19 smoker who has made it to face the tobacco 20 companies alive, and we will talk about that. 21 here is the most important thing. right 22 out of the box, you must know that as of -- and 23 this is in evidence. this document is in 24 evidence. 25 this is going to be -- you can get these united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 for free from the government. they pay the 2 postage. it has enormous amounts of 3 information and shows you that even today, even 4 now, we are still learning and identifying and 5 understanding just the scope of the devastation 6 the tobacco industry has caused. 7 the findings in the surgeon general 2014 8 that i wanted to reflect on with you so quickly 9 are that all these years, folks have talked 10 about stop quitting. 11 yul brynner, do not smoke, do not smoke. 12 you remember that public service announcement. 13 you may ask, well, if he was making that 14 public service announcement, where were the 15 tobacco executives watching this public service 16 announcement. why did not they do something 17 about it. 18 why did not they get together and say, you 19 know what, we are killing all these people. 20 let us stop making an effective and dangerous 21 product. let us taken addictiveness out. take 22 the inhalability out. let us sell tobacco in 23 its natural state. 24 they would still have the business, they 25 would be 1/10th of the business. but would not united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 be an epidemic of disease. 2 that is what we have here. we have an 3 industrial driven epidemic of disease, 4 literally an infectious disease that sickens 5 and kills more americans and more people 6 worldwide, but for this case americans than any 7 other thing in the country. 8 we say it is an irrational madness that 9 hides in plain sight. 10 kurt vonnegut said to an insane society, 11 a sane man must appear insane. 12 and it is almost like a deprogramming 13 opportunity for us here. we all live in a 14 culture they created, for you to see something 15 that a lot of folks have not seen. it hides in 16 plain sight. 17 one of the things i thought of that comes 18 from an old song is, when you came into this 19 courtroom at the beginning of the case, i 20 thought i knew, i thought i knew, but now i 21 know. the song has a line, i thought i knew, 22 but now i know. it is elton john, mona lisas 23 and mad hatters. it is a great song. 24 but the idea is, we went in a roomful of 25 150, 160 people, folks had preconceived united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 notions. and we filtered y'all out, and you 2 all said, i'll be open-minded. but even -- 3 everybody has some idea about it. 4 you said: i thought i knew. but now you 5 know. now you have been exposed to what they 6 have done internally, what -- a secret business 7 plan, an enterprise of death that traded lives 8 for money all these years. 9 and what is interesting is, the focus is 10 on the smoker. you cannot say you are going to 11 lie to a smoker and then blame it on him. 12 you cannot say i'm going to take a 13 12-year-old, a child of tender ages, the target 14 of my business activity, hook him as a 15 replacement smoker for my customers that i know 16 are dying and then say, it is all your fault. 17 all richard's fault. 18 you cannot do that. that is not 19 reasonable. 20 this is something that is bigger. it 21 transcends this courtroom. it is about richard. 22 it is about compensation for richard, which is 23 restorative in nature. 24 but the point to make here is to say we 25 here in bartow have seen something. our eyes united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 have been opened to something that is current. 2 it is relevant. it is news. 3 2014, the tobacco epidemic was initiated 4 and has been sustained by the aggressive 5 strategies of the tobacco industry which has 6 deliberately misled the public on risks of 7 smoking cigarettes. 8 this is the first time in 50 years of 9 surgeon general's reports -- and all the 10 surgeon general cares about is helping people. 11 the first time in 50 years the surgeon 12 general's report specifically changes its focus 13 from you should quit. if you are addicted, you 14 should quit, even though addiction is a 15 fundamental -- it is a brain disease. it causes 16 a permanent change. 17 this case, without a doubt and more so 18 than ever has got -- is replete with records 19 about this man being addicted. it is not an 20 issue in dispute. 21 as a matter of fact, they presented not a 22 single shred of evidence to deny addiction, not 23 one shred of evidence. 24 as a matter of fact, the document they 25 put on, he pled ignorance. i do not know, i united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 do not know. i cannot tell you about addiction. 2 it is part of his practice. he should have been 3 able to say something about it, but he did not. 4 and so this is an important point, 5 because it is current. it is the first time the 6 surgeon general is focusing not on the smoker, 7 the illness, the disease, but on who it is that 8 is sustaining this epidemic, who initiated the 9 epidemic, the aggressive strategy of the 10 tobacco industry deliberately misled the public 11 on the risks of smoking, and it worked. it 12 worked. 13 then we go to punishment damages, because 14 you will work your way through class 15 membership. i say you can make it easy, you 16 can make it hard. 17 we talked about the burden of proof, and 18 this is the scales of justice. and remember, 19 it is not a criminal case where it is all to the 20 exclusion of any reasonable doubt. 21 it is not like you have got to get the 22 scales to go all the way one way or the other. 23 it is on balance. the preponderance of the 24 evidence. what is most likely. what is 25 persuasive. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 an organic medical record from soup to 2 nuts that you saw lays out a case of a man who 3 is clearly sick, with documentation. it is very 4 precise on that point. 5 and we brought heavyweights in the form 6 of dr. mannino from -- with unbelievable 7 credentials. he wrote the chapter on chronic 8 obstructive pulmonary disease in the surgeon 9 general's report. 10 dr. illei, johns hopkins, pulmonary 11 pathologist, and dr. alvarez, the treating 12 doctor from mayo who all laid out the case 13 indisputably, and they dignified the 14 proceedings because they have the gravitas, and 15 they have the experience, the credentials to 16 bring them to you so we can honor this process 17 with men of great scientific background and 18 dedicated lives to helping people. 19 they are heavyweights, and they have 20 tried to counterbalance it on one single 21 occasion with a lightweight. and you will not let 22 that happen, because that is how you determine 23 the greater weight of the evidence. 24 they may raise a doubt. and you know 25 they say in their own documents, doubt is our united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 product. doubt is our product. 2 mr. reilly: objection, your honor. 3 motion. 4 the court: overruled. 5 mr. schlesinger: however -- however, in 6 a case of the burden of proof being the greater 7 weight of evidence, the more convincing force 8 and effect of all the evidence in the case, as 9 his honor read to you, as you will have in the 10 back of the room if you use his instructions, 11 that greater weight of the evidence is, what is 12 more likely than not? 13 was there a doubt? sure. 14 does that doubt carry the day? no, 15 because doubts are resolved -- any small doubts 16 are resolved in the favor of the plaintiff. if 17 more likely than not, you believe the case -- 18 mr. reilly: objection -- 19 mr. schlesinger: -- a doubt is resolved 20 in our favor. 21 the reporter: wait, one at a time. 22 mr. reilly: -- the instructions that 23 doubts are not resolved in favor of a party. 24 the court: sustained. 25 mr. schlesinger: so anyway, you must united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 decide if punitive damages are warranted, and 2 it is in addition to compensatory damages. and 3 punitive damages are warranted as punishment to 4 one or more defendants as a deterrent to 5 others. 6 the case is about richard boatright and 7 much more. it is about the harms to 20 million 8 smokers who have died since the 1964 surgeon 9 general's report -- 10 mr. reilly: objection, your honor. 11 mr. schlesinger: -- has come out. 12 mr. reilly: it is not about -- 13 the court: just a second. 14 mr. reilly: this is not about 20 million 15 people. 16 the court: sustained. 17 mr. schlesinger: if i may. this is the 18 instruction that is being read to you. 19 when considering whether to award 20 punitive damages, you may consider any harm 21 defendants' conduct caused richard boatright. 22 you may also consider similar harms suffered by 23 other parties not to this lawsuit in assessing 24 the reprehensibility or wrongness of the 25 defendants' acts in -- as proven in this case. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 that is why you can consider harms to others. 2 when you get to punishment damages, it is -- in 3 order to determine was what they did indecent; 4 was it reprehensible? 5 is killing 20 [sic] people for profit as 6 a business plan and disregarding the health of 7 the american people while lying to them since 8 the '50s saying, we want to be frank, we want 9 to be honest. we will stop making it if it is bad 10 for you. we want to be straight with you. we 11 would never make a bad product. we will fix it. 12 here is a filter, even though it is fake. 13 defrauding the american public, the 14 resulting harm that dr. proctor himself said 15 caused millions of unnecessary deaths. this 16 goes to what you decide, more than richard 17 boatright, was the conduct reprehensible. 18 so you have this, you have this -- this 19 entry as a jury instruction, because you have 20 great power. this is -- you may have more 21 power today than in any situation you have ever 22 held in your life. 23 you get to decide about enormous, great 24 historical wrong, a tragedy of monumental human 25 proportions, right here in bartow, right now. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 and when you think about it -- i have a 2 picture here of mount everest. you have mount 3 everest. the fact that richard boatright is in 4 this courtroom at this time before you, a 5 living smoker getting his day in court to face 6 philip morris. 7 and mr. reilly is -- as he said, he is a 8 nice guy, but he is not philip morris. you are 9 not making a decision about is mr. reilly a 10 fine fellow or a decent man. 11 he is doing a job for his client. he is 12 not a corporate representative. he is not an 13 executive of philip morris. they could have 14 brought anybody they want to come here and talk 15 to you about it. they could have brought down 16 mark barrington-- (phonetic) 17 mr. reilly: objection. 18 the court: sustained. 19 mr. schlesinger: however, you are not 20 judging mr. reilly. you are judging the conduct 21 of the company he represents. that is more 22 important to remember. 23 more people have climbed to the top of 24 mount everest. and this is the northern view 25 of mount everest from the rongbuk monastery in united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 tibet. the biggest mountain on earth. 2 there are more people that have stood on 3 the top of that mountain than have made it 4 alive into a courtroom to face philip morris as 5 a sick smoker in a case in the united states. 6 that is how rare. that is how special. 7 that is how amazing it is that we are here with 8 this case. 9 mr. reilly: objection. 10 the court: overruled. 11 mr. schlesinger: can i go back to my 12 original numbers? 13 just put me back to where i was, please. 14 so in addition, the major conclusions in 15 these surgeon general's reports -- and delve 16 through them, look through them. 17 this is the current thinking, cutting 18 edge. this is still a current topic. the 19 major conclusions in the surgeon general 10, 20 the blue one, is about how tobacco causes 21 disease. 22 it is got a chapter on copd and addiction 23 on page 105. nicotine, the fundamental reason 24 people smoke. that is why these diseases get 25 caused. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 surgeon general 12, the red book, is all 2 about the children. it is all about hooking 3 children. that is the basis of the business, 4 and they want to say cigarettes are legal. 5 well, they are legal. but it is not legal to 6 sell them to kids. 7 and when the basis of the business is 8 children, is youth, that is something that 9 does not meet with the bounds of human decency. 10 his honor read an instruction to you. 11 the corporations are entitled to be treated 12 like people. great. i like that instruction. 13 they have the ability to be treated as a 14 person. the idea being, do not come in there 15 and say, well, they are just a big corporation, 16 so we are going to slam them. 17 that is not fair. let us treat them as a 18 person. i embrace that. 19 because i say with the rights of human 20 personhood come the obligations and 21 responsibilities of being a person. 22 and i say, if you want to be treated like 23 a person, act like a person. 24 be decent to people. robert fulghum 25 wrote the book on everything i ever needed to united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 learn about life, i learned in kindergarten. 2 remember ten points, a simple book. be nice to 3 people. do not hurt people. if you hurt 4 someone, try to make it right. it is a simple 5 thing. 6 and when you are indecent, when a 7 corporate business practice says we are going to 8 lie to our customers, we are going to give them 9 a drug that addicts them and kills them 10 fifty percent of the time, one-fifth of all deaths 11 in america occur from cigarette-related 12 diseases. 13 i've been running down that fort fraser 14 trail. you go by the oak hill cemetery. 15 imagine if you visited that oak hill 16 cemetery, that one in every five tombstones had 17 a little no-smoking sign on it, because that is 18 how many people are dying from the scourge of 19 tobacco. 20 you are here seeing an amazingly 21 monumental human wrong. and you have amazing 22 power to do something about it today in this 23 courtroom. 24 mr. reilly: objection, your honor, 25 conscious of the community. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 the court: overruled. 2 mr. schlesinger: the major conclusions 3 of the report. i read you number 2. 4 another one says: the century long 5 epidemic of cigarette smoking has caused an 6 enormous public health tragedy. since the 7 first surgeon general's report in 1964, more 8 than 20 million premature deaths can be 9 attributed to cigarette smoking. 10 let us think about that. 11 can i have the map of florida. 12 think about that for a second. what does 13 that mean? despite 1964 coming out and saying 14 it caused cancer, 20 million people are dead. 15 what does that mean? 16 okay. that means that every single man, 17 woman and child that populate this state would 18 be gone. 20 million people is the population 19 of the state of florida, 19.55 -- 20 mr. reilly: objection, your honor, this 21 is inappropriate. 22 the court: overruled. 23 mr. schlesinger: to give you a sense of 24 scale. 25 and you put up my numbers board. i do not united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 know which one that is. the numbers board. 2 video technician: yes. 3 mr. schlesinger: the numbers numb. 4 in other words, you talk about 5 20 million. sometimes they say if one or two 6 or three people die, it is an incomprehensible 7 tragedy. 8 1200 people are dying every single day. 9 more than 1200 people in the united states. 10 that is like the equivalent of three jumbo jets 11 going down. that would be front page news. 12 but when 480,000 people are dying a year, 13 adds up to $20 million, it is almost like, it is 14 a statistic. it is hard to wrap your minds 15 around it. 16 but these are people and families and 17 loved ones and moms and dads and uncles and 18 aunties and grandparents. and people -- not 19 only the people involved, but other people are 20 suffering. 21 so you are witnessing something, it is 22 tobacco 101 -- 23 mr. reilly: objection. 24 the court: overruled. 25 mr. schlesinger: exposed to something united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 really bad. 2 so i thought of this, the numbers numb. 3 the numbers numb. 4 it is almost numbing, the amount. that is 5 why i put up the state of florida, which is 6 19.55 million people. 7 imagine the entire -- go from bartow in 8 every single direction to key west and 9 pensacola and not see a single soul. they are 10 all gone. that is what we have lost preventably 11 and prematurely because of the scourge of 12 tobacco epidemic. 13 can you go back to where i was in the 14 punies, please. 15 so you have to decide if punishment is 16 warranted. to me, it is the most important 17 thing in this case. it clearly is. you have got 18 to get through the preliminary questions and 19 address restorative damages to mr. boatright 20 and his wife. 21 mr. hammer suggested a number. it is only 22 a suggestion. if that number is too high to 23 you, if you say, you know, you are grubbing for 24 money, you are losing credibility with me, i 25 do not like that, you can order any amount you united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 want. 2 if it is 500,000. if it is 2 million. if 3 it is 3 million. whatever it is. but when it 4 comes to medical bills and economics, a million 5 and a half, $2 million in economics, earnings, 6 lost earnings, medical bills. 7 when folks are laying in the hospital -- 8 and richard is there fighting for his life to 9 get a lung transplant. his loved ones and 10 family members are not going to the hospital and 11 saying, oh, my god, how much are your medicals 12 going to be. 13 they are like, when are you going to get 14 back out there and smell the roses? are you 15 going to make it? 16 so the human concepts of mental anguish 17 are so enormous. and in this case they are so 18 substantial, they are worth considering. 19 punitive damages are warranted. you may 20 consider the engle findings which are very 21 clear. the engle findings say fraud, 22 conspiracy, defective product. and you own 23 these engle findings. they are binding on you. 24 and i say that in a way that both 25 captures you, but also recognizing folks do not united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 like to be said this is what you have to do. 2 they are binding. 3 and his honor read, you may not disregard 4 them. mr. reilly may not disregard them. they 5 are binding. 6 but what is more, i say embrace them and 7 use them, because it also says it is as if you 8 found them yourself. 9 these findings are valid as if you found 10 them yourself. 11 engle is not over. engle lives on. this 12 is a generational fight. going back to 1960 13 when i read to you that new england journal of 14 medicine article saying the behavior of the 15 tobacco industry has been deplorable and has not 16 changed, and dr. proctor said it has not 17 changed. 18 it is been a generation since engle was 19 started. and now these are the engle progeny 20 cases, and they go on. and they go into the 21 future. and you are a point in time that can 22 help with that. 23 so these are the things that can give 24 rise to reprehensible behavior. 25 we did not do a year-long trial with a united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 million documents like engle. we gave you a 2 smattering to give you a sense of just how 3 incredibly wrongful, intentionally wrongful, 4 how -- the losing of the moral compass, losing 5 the direction that decent humans should treat 6 each other. reckless disregard for human life, 7 or a lack of care. 8 so it is conscious indifference to the 9 consequences. or wanton and recklessly 10 disregarding the safety and welfare of the 11 product or reckless indifference to the rights 12 of others to be equivalent to intentional 13 violation of those rights. 14 all those things are applicable here, and 15 the engle findings lay them all out. liggett 16 is only in because they were part of a 17 conspiracy to commit fraud. 18 so there is one question on engle was, is 19 this the kind of thing that contributed to what 20 happened? 21 so i say, what should a responsible 22 manufacturer do? think about all the 23 scientists, think about the brilliant men, the 24 cleverness, the ingenious way they formed this 25 conspiracy. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 what if that energy had been directed to 2 good. to helping people. where would we be 3 medically. how many fewer deaths. there would 4 have been millions fewer deaths would we have 5 seen had they done that. and they did not. 6 so that is why you can say to them, we 7 reject this conduct, in the strongest possible 8 terms. we do not want this behavior. 9 so i say you should protect children, you 10 should not addict them. 11 that is what we should do. we should not 12 be preying on children. there should not be 13 predation on youngsters, the only basis of the 14 business. 15 if you do not start smoking before 18, you 16 do not start smoking. the business goes down to 17 ninety percent. 18 put those cigarettes behind the counter 19 of the pharmacy, require id for 21 years of 20 age. and then, instead of having a 21 multibillion dollar business, they have got a 22 hundreds of millions of dollar business. it is 23 still a business, but it is more responsible. 24 but this is -- another thing. cure, 25 do not cause. could not they have directed their united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 energies, their scientists, their medical 2 people to curing and not causing this? yes, 3 they could. 4 but here is what they are really 5 interested in. who ain't for more money? 6 and they know back in the '60s, they 7 cannot count it as a drug, because there are 8 dangerous fda implications going behind those 9 walls. 10 forty years later, the fda gets ahold of 11 them. what does dr. proctor say. they are just 12 as dangerous. not a single change has been 13 made. they wield too much power and influence, 14 and they block any attempts by the fda. 15 in a sense, you hold more power than the 16 fda today. you can do something. you can make 17 an expression of moral condemnation -- 18 mr. reilly: objection, your honor. 19 mr. schlesinger: you can say something 20 to the defendant. 21 the court: overruled. 22 mr. schlesinger: that we do not accept 23 this behavior. 24 i showed you this one. you consider 25 wrongfulness to others. it is bigger than just united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 richard. 2 and richard presents an opportunity. 3 he is a generic smoker. like he said to you, i 4 was the perfect customer. 5 he did everything they wanted to do. he 6 started smoking at 12 years old. he smoked 7 them up silly. he smoked cigarettes, he was 8 terribly addicted to them. 9 and that is the whole business model. the 10 center of their universe is addiction. he 11 bought their gear, and he did what they wanted 12 him to do. 13 so i told you it is about richard, but 14 much more, because it presents an opportunity 15 going forward to enact deterrence, not just to 16 the tobacco companies, but other companies that 17 might not put the safety of their customers 18 ahead of their corporate profits. 19 so the numbers numb, i've told you that, 20 and it is about truth and consequences. when 21 you engineer for addiction, there will be 22 consequences. 23 when you lie to the american public, 24 there will be consequences. 25 when you offer up solutions, such as united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 filters which do nothing, there will be 2 consequences. 3 so when you are tricking folks with fake 4 filters that are nothing more than a fraud for 5 a health reassurance concept, there will be 6 consequences. 7 and they knew it. and they knew it. 8 back in the '60s. 9 the position we are taking is going to be 10 subject to a finding. we are making false and 11 misleading statements to promote the sales of 12 cigarettes. 13 they knew it. and, of course, punishment 14 damages is a higher burden of proof. 15 remember i said on balance, the greater 16 weight of the evidence? 17 you must find that it is clear and 18 convincing evidence. it is a higher burden of 19 proof, meaning you must be able to say it is 20 precise. it is explicit. and it does not 21 confuse me. 22 i know what they did now, those records, 23 those internal documents. we have got the goods 24 on them. those internal documents lay it all 25 out, and you have seen them. you were exposed to united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 tobacco 101. 2 a lot of people have not seen it, even 3 though they were available. six jurors at a 4 time, we are learning about this. and it should 5 be lacking in confusion and form a firm belief 6 or conviction about the matter at issue. 7 here is the thing. lacking confusion. 8 there ain't no illusion about the confusion. 9 there is no doubt about the doubt. 10 they offered the illusion of filtration. 11 they said so. that is how you know. 12 they offered a doubt campaign that they 13 celebrated as a brilliant holding strategy that 14 enabled them to win many, many, many victories 15 in litigation and other fronts, because that 16 was a big part of the arm of the conspiracy, as 17 dr. proctor testified. 18 so, he meets those standards. he smoked 19 almost always marlboros, one of the most 20 popular brands, the most popular brand in the 21 world. 22 what did dr. proctor say about it? this 23 is the greatest branded cause of death in the 24 history of human civilization. 25 you know, i thought i knew. but now i united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 know. 2 class membership is not about fault. 3 please pay attention to that carefully. 4 because there is a tendency to conflate, 5 to mix, to confuse the idea that in class 6 membership, which is a simple question, okay, 7 dr. tabb's note, chronic bronchitis secondary 8 to tobacco abuse, which was defined by mannino 9 and alvarez as tobacco addiction, like drug 10 abuse, that note alone is everything you need 11 to know about class membership. 12 did he have a manifestation, the 13 appearance of the signs and symptoms of 14 suffering of a disease, chronic bronchitis, 15 which is part of copd. 16 did he have it before 1996 in november? 17 yes, this is 1992. 18 was it caused by drug addiction? yes, it 19 was secondary to tobacco abuse, which is 20 tobacco addiction. 21 there is no way to get around it. and, 22 quite frankly, they hook teenagers and children 23 and those guys become lifelong customers. 24 fishermen use hooks. fish never see the 25 hook. that is the whole idea. and when they united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 hook them, like dr. tamol said in the document: 2 keep a minimum amount of nicotine required to 3 keep the normal smoker hooked. 4 they know, they have got them hooked. 5 that is just the way it is. 6 class membership is not about fault. 7 class membership is only, was he a sick smoker? 8 there was 700,000 of them during the 9 period of years of the engle class period 10 between 1990 and '96, and -- i mean, it would 11 be a heck of a waste of time and resources to 12 pick the wrong one. and i do not think we did. 13 he has clear and convincing organic, 14 meaning legitimate. it appeared in the chart, 15 unrelated to anything, that the man was seeking 16 medical care in the '90s. 17 so when you get to class membership, it is 18 not about fault. 19 later, there is a question on fault and 20 you can compare the fault. you can say richard 21 should have started -- tried harder to quit. 22 but the records are so clear that he was 23 tormented. he tried so hard to quit. 24 especially in '01, '02, '03. on cigarettes, 25 off cigarettes. going to counseling, getting united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 medicines. 2 addiction is a scourge. it is so 3 powerful, so overwhelming. it destroys free 4 choice. he was powerfully addicted. no doubt. 5 so fault is after class membership. do 6 not get hung up on the concept that he might 7 have been at fault for not trying harder to 8 quit. 9 they want to shine a floodlight. they 10 want to shine a floodlight -- excuse me, a 11 spotlight on richard. 12 look at richard. look at richard. what 13 did richard do? it is like anything else. if 14 you do not have a leg to stand on, on your 15 conduct, one of attack approaches is break the 16 other guy's leg. 17 if you do not have a leg to stand on on 18 what you did 50 years over, hence, break the 19 other guy's leg. 20 and why does it work? it works. if you 21 watched any of the campaign news, was all that 22 advertising for elections negative. even 23 though we hate it, we hate it, it must work. 24 because at some level psychologically, it gets 25 to us. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 focus on richard. i say turn on the 2 floodlights and look at richard and then look 3 at what is on either side of richard. liggett 4 and philip morris leading him down the aisle, 5 encouraging addiction all the way along, 6 denying the harms of smoking, saying it is an 7 open question. creating doubt. 8 operation stumbling block, a 9 de-motivation campaign for drug addicted 10 cigarette smokers in denial to keep smoking. 11 that is what happened. that is the truth 12 of it. that is the dirty little secret that 13 hides in plain sight. catching those kids. 14 the engle class period. this is the 15 trampoline case, as the fellow they brought, 16 dr. schroeder, said. strict no landing zone. 17 i thought about it. because i used to 18 have shelties. they would run around. the 19 birds would come out in the yard. they would 20 never let the birds land. they would chase the 21 birds, and they would fly. and i said my shelties 22 enforced a strict no landing policy in the 23 backyard. 24 and that is what i thought of that idea. 25 here it is, this is the trampoline. they are united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 using the technical class period. no matter 2 what tries to get in there, boing, everything 3 bounces out. ain't nobody going to be in the 4 class period if the tobacco defense approach 5 has anything to do it with it. 6 that is not the reality of what these 7 records show. 8 dr. tabb saw this gentleman on four 9 consecutive occasions, over an entire year and 10 always kept the same diagnosis, chronic 11 bronchitis, going throughout the record. 12 he saw him. kept the same treatment in 13 july. keep the same treatment in august. keep 14 the same treatment in october. 15 the only guy they are talking about, 16 dr. catz, he only saw him one time. 17 and what dr. schroeder got hung by his 18 own petard was he had just come from the taylor 19 case two days earlier up in jacksonville where 20 my friend jimmy gustafson is trying the case, 21 and he said -- 22 mr. reilly: objection. 23 the court: overruled. 24 mr. schlesinger: -- well, can you make 25 the diagnosis or distinguish between copd and united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 asthma if you have not had continuity of care 2 and multiple visits? is that important? it is 3 extremely important. 4 all of a sudden, the fact that dr. catz 5 only saw him one time was not extremely 6 important. and dr. catz said he is got copd on 7 the testing. 8 and dr. mannino, a world's expert, 9 explained this is copd. 10 so, you know, you have to look at the 11 case in terms of what is reality. what is 12 obvious. 13 and what do they say? 14 business is selling nicotine. nicotine 15 is the drug. they describe their customers as 16 a rat in a cage. an essential commodity, a 17 habitual act. put a hungry rat in a cage -- i 18 mean, you know, this is their business. 19 nicotine is the center of the universe. no one 20 has ever smoked without nicotine. the product 21 is nicotine. the cigarette is a package. 22 the cigarette pack is a storage container 23 for a day's supply of nicotine. 24 very few consumers are aware of the 25 effects of nicotine and its addictive nature united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 and that nicotine is a poison. 2 remember this? we tabbed motives of 3 incentives and showed the book. because he had 4 never seen one of those. 5 it is amazing what you can find nowadays. 6 this is the book. and it says: no doubt about 7 it. it is the nicotine. 8 william dunn, the nicotine kid from 9 philip morris. no doubt about it. it is the 10 nicotine. way back in the '70s, they 11 celebrated this. this was their business. 12 smoking is not a free choice. when you 13 start smoking as a teenager and become 14 addicted, you cannot quit. very few people can 15 quit. and the prevalence of nicotine 16 dependence is the highest addiction in the 17 world. 18 alvarez says it is one of the most 19 addictive substances there is, more addictive 20 than heroin because of the relapse. you try, 21 you fall back. 22 and it is a normal consumer product. how 23 do you tell somebody it is not normal? you 24 have -- it looks like this. 25 a kid comes up and picks up a pack of united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 cigarettes with the pretty colors on it and 2 says: daddy, what is this? 3 you say: son, it is bad. 4 he says: does not look bad. 5 well, it does not look bad. it looks like 6 everything else. it looks like everything 7 else. it can be the same colored patterns as 8 the toys he is playing with. 9 so how are you supposed to teach the kids 10 that it is bad in an environment where when our 11 client was smoking in the early '60s, more than 12 half the kids his age were smoking. 13 when claude teague who said on the youth 14 market at 18, what is immoral? 15 my client had -- you are going to judge 16 his responsibility in combination with theirs 17 in terms of starting to smoke at 12. and what 18 could a future -- what long-range future plans 19 could a 12-year-old have? very few. 20 and here it is. manifestation. 21 manifestation you will see. the judge did not say 22 manifestation means it has to be diagnosed. it 23 emerges, it manifests. the simple meaning of 24 the term. 25 he was suffering from the disease. the united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 manifestation is clear. here it is. 2 this is class membership right here. bar 3 none, sine qua non, unless they can convince 4 you there is something wrong with this note and 5 there is not. 6 this note, as alvarez said, leads to 7 dr. alvarez's treatment in 2010. and he said 8 it was one continuous process, the emphysema, 9 the result of this man losing his lungs, 10 started and was demonstrated in 1992. same 11 process. 12 that is a treating doctor, dr. alvarez. 13 not hired by anybody, not paid any kind of 14 expert witness fees, to -- he is just a guy that 15 does not testify, like mannino does not come into 16 court and testify. 17 illei does not come into court and testify 18 to tell you -- to honor the system with 19 expertise where we are honored to bring you 20 world class experts. 21 i wish there was a classroom of people 22 here to be able to see what they have to say 23 because of what they were teaching. 24 compatible with copd. and mannino 25 explained extensively, that sure looked like united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 copd. 2 and what was helping this man, atrovent, 3 a copd drug. we learned a lot about this in 4 this trial. i did not even really know that 5 much about it. 45,000 pages. i got an in. i 6 did not read them. somebody said they did. 7 think about whether it was physically 8 possible to go through 45,000 records. it was 9 not. 10 history of asthma and emphysema. this is 11 what the patient said to a doctor in an er 12 visit as to what he thought he had. 13 and by the way, dr. keeler did not 14 diagnose asthma. she diagnosed an acute 15 reaction to an adrenaline drug. that is what he 16 was there for. he did not go to the er for a 17 special evaluation of his well-being, his lung 18 conditions. 19 he said emphysema, and he told you, i 20 learned from these guys that i was sick with a 21 smoking-related disease. 22 the proof is in the pudding. actions 23 speak louder than words. 24 in '94, in the doctor's office, the man 25 is saying, what have you got? united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 i got asthma and emphysema. 2 he never said he did not have asthma. but 3 he is got both. 4 and then in '99 at the watkins clinic. 5 there is a look-back note where someone says his 6 spirometry did show a moderate obstructive 7 ventilatory defect in '92. 8 in 2004. how organic, how much the ring 9 of truth does this note have. what year did 10 you know you had a lung disease? 1996. he 11 knew he had a lung disease. 12 and then the lung pathology, of course, 13 said chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 14 emphysema and chronic bronchitis. 15 that is when we actually looked at the 16 slides of the lungs, that is what the man had. 17 but you know it was not asthma in '96. 18 and it is approximately what year, and it is 19 going back in time to the period between '90 20 and '96. 1. 2. 3. 4. references that 21 period. 22 it is easy. 23 and then every single thing about the 24 disease being caused by tobacco abuse. chronic 25 bronchitis secondary tobacco abuse. tobacco united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 abuse of two and a half per day times 30 years 2 resulting in emphysema. severe obstructive 3 airway disease secondary to many years of 4 tobacco abuse. tobacco addiction all 5 throughout the board. 6 we should not be fighting about this. 7 okay? 8 and donna hernandez. she did not get a 9 couple things right. i'm not going to spend a 10 lot of time on her right now. 11 millions are caught in the web of deceit. 12 so was richard. there is 40 million americans. 13 this is 2014. 40 million americans 14 caught in the web of tobacco dependence. every 15 day, kids under 18 are smoking, and a bunch of 16 them -- 17 ms. st. peter-griffith: your honor, i 18 would object to this demonstrative. it has the 19 wrong -- 20 mr. schlesinger: this is. 21 ms. st. peter-griffith: wrong defendant. 22 mr. schlesinger: i'll move on. 23 so anyway, let me read another major 24 conclusion from the report. 25 dr. proctor started out. dr. proctor, united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 you know -- you know, dr. proctor looks to help 2 people. he dedicated his life to researching 3 the truth of the history of the tobacco 4 misconduct. 5 and he is a true scholar, and he did a 6 great job coming into this courtroom, i think, 7 to really show you things that you could not 8 even imagine. 9 and he said something about, i think 10 they are too dangerous to be marketed. i think 11 these drugs are just too dangerous to be 12 marketed. 13 it is funny, because in the surgeon 14 general 2014, hot off the press, focusing on 15 the role the tobacco industry played in 16 creating this epidemic. 17 major conclusion number 9: the burden of 18 death and disease from tobacco use in the 19 united states is overwhelmingly caused by 20 cigarettes and other combusted tobacco 21 products. rapid elimination of their use will 22 dramatically reduce this burden. 23 if you took cigarette smoking out of this 24 country, it is like finding a vaccine. it stops 25 a third of all cancers. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 so proctor is in alignment with the 2 surgeon general. he is actually a senior 3 scientific reviewer of the surgeon general. 4 remember, i said build a better 5 mousetrap. 6 you can go back to the other picture. 7 build a better mousetrap, and the world 8 will beat a path to your door. 9 do not let them create a false equivalency 10 in the defense of the case by saying, okay, we 11 were able to get schroeder up to about a 12 million dollars of earnings. and dr. proctor, 13 he is probably earned about $2 million. 14 well, did he earn $2 million because he 15 invented the better mousetrap and the world 16 beat a path to his door. 17 what is the way in which you get an 18 expert witness? 19 you go to the literature, you go to the 20 science, you research, you study, you look who 21 has committed themselves on paper to scholarly 22 articles, books, learning, teaching, through a 23 lifetime dedicated to becoming an expert. 24 building that better mousetrap. 25 he built that better mousetrap. and united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 because he was an expert, the world beat a path 2 to his door. 3 here in florida, the only state where 4 these engle progeny cases are going on, his 5 expertise has been sought out because he is 6 earned it. he deserved it. he built a better 7 mousetrap, and the world beat a path to his 8 door. 9 there was no world beating any path to 10 dr. schroeder's door. he was a random pickup 11 in kansas city, the home base of one of the 12 major firms for the defendants, and they 13 brought the guy in. 14 and i submit to you, yeah, he may be good 15 at doing some things. we will talk about it a 16 little bit more. 17 i'm trying not to go off on schroeder, 18 because i feel that enough was demonstrated to 19 discount him. but i have a few choice words 20 for him in rebuttal. because i get another 15, 21 20 minutes. 22 the court: you have 30 minutes left. 23 mr. schlesinger: thank you, judge. 24 i'm going to be taking a little bit from 25 my back end, but we will keep going. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 so heimann said, philip morris, we want 2 people to rely. that is why you can check off 3 those boxes. 4 did their lies -- lies cost lives? did 5 their lies lead to my client and many, many 6 others like him getting sick? they clearly 7 did. 8 tons of advertising spent to convince 9 folks to keep smoking and make it glamorous. 10 you know about what they said about the 11 marlboro adventure team, the great success of 12 their brands, their marketings. 13 one of the things very interesting. the 14 tobacco industry tries to disappear in this 15 courtroom. cigarettes fall out of trees, we 16 do not grow them. they are a crop. we just 17 harvest them. 18 i thought of that children's story, 19 cloudy with a chance of meatballs. how about 20 cloudy with a chance of cigarettes. they do not 21 just fall out of the sky. they are the 22 manufacturer. and yet we are the ones bringing 23 you the gear and the advertisements and showing 24 you the boxes. 25 this is their beloved, most proud logo, united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 the most successful logo in the history of the 2 world, and you never saw one time that they 3 ever showed you anything from their proud logo. 4 you can see the sign on the gas station 5 down at the racetrack down the way, if you are 6 driving down 98. 7 but you did not see any of it in here. 8 because just like dr. proctor says, they want 9 to disappear. 10 here is my replacement smoker, 12 years 11 old. he was older than that here. but he was 12 12 years old. 13 the strategic research report from diane 14 burrows, we must capture the youth market, we 15 must get the share of young smokers. they are 16 the only source of replacement smokers. 17 that is patently offensive. it is 18 reprehensible. it is not the kind of conduct 19 that decent people can accept or should accept 20 in this country. 21 in any event, marlboro red and its rapid 22 growth and success. as teenagers, there is a 23 great bonanza getting to kids. younger adults 24 with critical factor. this is where it all 25 comes from. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 replacement smokers. getting the 2 14-year-olds, getting the 12-year-olds. all 3 these are critical. 4 if we are going to prosper, we must get 5 the youth market. and they know that kids 6 do not smoke because they are addicted to 7 nicotine. they do not know what to expect from 8 nicotine. they smoke to be cool or -- look at 9 the cowboy. 10 how about this. these folks are coming 11 along, doing what they are doing, and they are 12 not understanding this central truth. here is 13 what they -- i'm not a drug addict. i'm a 14 cowboy. 15 that is not the truth. that is not reality 16 in this case. 17 so diane burrows worked it all out. they 18 were competing internally for kids, but they 19 were not admitting that publicly. publicly, 20 they were denying it. 21 it was such an incendiary word they had 22 to change the code language in their papers. 23 hey, you know what, do not say youth anymore. 24 call the 12-year-olds young adults. 25 because they knew if these documents get united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 out, folks would be offended. 2 how did you feel the first time you 3 started seeing these documents? how did it 4 make you feel when you saw the words behind the 5 general idea, folks generally may think tobacco 6 did something bad? 7 but everyone knows it is bad for you. so 8 it is all on them. 9 it is not like that. there is something 10 driving this. 11 anyway, marlboro is going for the 12 13-year-olds, they are going for the 13 12-year-olds. 14 the nicotine response is absent in the 15 pre-smoker, and it is overwhelmingly important 16 in the smoker who is lost the freedom to choose. 17 plus plus plus, it is all about the nicotine. 18 and here, my client is -- he wrote about 19 my client. 20 on january 6, 1965, when he was 12 years 21 old, he was born on january 1, '53. he was 12 22 years old. and at 12 years old, they knew that 23 report, the surgeon general's report, was going 24 to cause a slowdown in sales for a little bit, 25 because the surgeon general came out and said, united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 hey, it causes lung cancer. 2 but when it came to the young kids, they 3 recognized there is been a backlog of youth who 4 have refrained from taking up smoking in the 5 face of the report, and a substantial number of 6 these can be expected to join this year's crop 7 of prospects. 8 richard boatright. they were right about 9 him. he was that year's crop of prospects. he 10 began smoking in 1965, and there is the crop. 11 the orange tree right down the fraser trail. 12 right down the fraser trail, down this way. 13 you can run or bicycle. 14 a bunch of oranges, a crop. 15 they are dehumanizing, because they are 16 not thinking about these people. 17 it is like when the ranchers on the farms 18 are looking at the cows, there is baby cows, all 19 the little guys laying around. they walk down 20 and they are like, little hundred dollar bills. 21 all those calves, or literally those little 22 veals are $100 bills. they are looking at them 23 as money. cash crop. they are smokers, those 24 kids. that is the cash crop. 25 that just ain't right. and it is not united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 right in a way that is so astonishingly, 2 powerfully wrong that y'all can reject it. 3 you can say i cannot accept it. 4 that is why when you speak as one voice to 5 this company today, you are expressing something 6 on behalf of a lot of people. but it is a 7 powerful message you can send. it is a powerful 8 message. 9 this is what claude teague said. and 10 i -- we have deliberately played down the role 11 of nicotine, hence the nonsmoker has little or 12 no knowledge of what satisfactions it may offer 13 him and no desire to try it. 14 instead, we must convince him with wholly 15 irrational reasons that he should try smoking, 16 in the hope that he will for himself then 17 discover the real "satisfactions" obtainable. 18 we scramble. we stay up all night. we 19 work really hard to try to come up with a 20 presentation to you. 21 and this document, i call the chiller. 22 because the more i read it -- and i hope the 23 more you read it, and it is in evidence and you 24 can read it, it is chilling. 25 look what he is saying. we are going to united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 convince them with wholly irrational reasons 2 they should try smoking. 3 you will be cool. you are not going to be a 4 drug addict. you are a cowboy. 5 in the hope that he would then 6 discover -- and remember how proctor and jon 7 talked about what it means when they put the 8 quotations around things. 9 the real "satisfactions" obtainable. the 10 code word for satisfactions is addiction. 11 that is what they are doing. 12 bait-and-switch. trick them and hook them, you 13 know. 14 so all about nicotine -- yeah, i know, 15 i'm watching. 16 all about nicotine. 17 you know, the warnings are not effective. 18 what do you do when you have a little kid 19 and -- you see a kid and he is getting ready to 20 get on the diving board, and the diving board 21 goes into an empty pool, and it says no diving. 22 and they want to say, well, the 23 warnings -- you have been warned. richard, 24 you have been warned. 25 okay, the fine print on the side of the united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 package. richard, you have been warned. 2 if a responsible, decent human being sees 3 a kid getting ready to jump into an empty pool, 4 going past the sign on the diving board that 5 says no diving, does he say, it is okay. he is 6 been warned. go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. 7 is that what they do, they encourage him? 8 or do they do everything in their power to stop 9 him. they scream, they run to try to grab him 10 and stop him. 11 what do they do? what do responsible, 12 decent people -- and if you are going to be 13 treated like a person, act like a person. what 14 do decent, responsible people do. everything 15 they can to stop that kid from jumping in that 16 pool. because he is going to get hurt. 17 something is going to happen to him. 18 that is what should be done in this case. 19 nobody can stop. we all know that. it is all 20 about who ain't for more money? 21 it is all about they will go out of 22 business if they lose the nicotine. 23 we are suffering from the externally 24 repressed fear that we are devoting our 25 business lives to the propagation of lung united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 cancer. 2 when you know that and you continue that 3 and you go forward with that, there is got to be 4 a day of reckoning. there is got to be the 5 truth and the consequences. the truth matters. 6 there is got to be a day of reckoning. 7 that is why punishment, as st. augustine 8 said, is justice for the unjust. and it is a 9 fervent prayer we bring to you that you see 10 this already, that i'm able to stitch this 11 together for you after this lengthy trial. 12 where you have taken and been so responsible, as 13 a six-man jury without an alternate, to go over 14 the time, to spend the time with us and learn 15 this. 16 i come up here and i say i want -- can i 17 think of something that is true and beautiful 18 and american and meaningful to get you to see 19 that it is not that richard is here grubbing for 20 money, that there is something bigger than that, 21 and it is a chance to do what is right and see 22 things as they are in a world and a culture 23 that has deceived everybody. 24 so, you know, there is an unattractive 25 side effect. it causes cancer. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 they always knew it caused cancer. they 2 did not care. they got together in the '50s, we 3 showed you that frank statement. they lied to 4 the public. we are going to find out and get to 5 the bottom of it. it was a doubt campaign. 6 they said: do not worry about it, let the 7 scientists do the worrying. 8 but really, they knew it was a habit they 9 could not break. they knew what was going on. 10 they all worked together. it was amazing they 11 could keep that conspiracy together for so 12 long. it was amazing to think of the idea, 13 do not just deny it. just keep doubt open. 14 just keep it an open question. we are not 15 really sure. 16 it went on for decades. and all those 17 psas and all those executives on television, 18 denying the harms or keeping the doubt open. 19 those are national news stories, and they 20 wanted richard to see them, just like they 21 wanted millions of americans to see them. 22 and he did see them. that was their 23 goal. 24 they celebrated the success of this. 25 they belittled and attacked the surgeon united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 general. 2 and then the frank statement. you know 3 about that. you knew they would go out of 4 business if they would stop making it. 5 they knew it was a brilliant and 6 successful strategy that worked. 7 on all the major fronts. litigation. it 8 was always a holding strategy. doubt the 9 health charge without denying it. it was set 10 up as an industry shield and a front. it was 11 never a legitimate scientific operation. 12 the key word was confusion. doubt is our 13 product. doubt is our product. 14 the cigarette industry, doubt is our 15 product. 16 give those smokers a psychological crutch 17 and self-rationale to keep smoking. 18 why does it connect? why does lies, why 19 does conspiracy, why does all that cause my 20 client as a cause, as a contributing cause, 21 along with any other causes, his human 22 weaknesses in not trying harder to quit. 23 which i do not know how these records 24 could reveal anybody that did not try harder to 25 quit than richard boatright. tormented smoker united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 for decades. 2 and young. he did not have as much time 3 as the average person, in his late 30s, early 4 40s. that is when a lot of people start really 5 thinking seriously about quitting. he was 6 already getting sick. you do not expect that. 7 lies cost lives. that is what dr. proctor 8 testified to, and that is why on those questions 9 of did the conspiracy contribute to what 10 happened to mr. boatright, the answer is yes. 11 did the fraud and the concealment and the 12 suppression contribute to what happened to 13 mr. boatright? the answer is yes. 14 and proctor said -- he blamed millions of 15 deaths on this conspiracy. they kept cigarette 16 sales going, they bought themselves a lot of 17 time. 18 imagine how many lives would have been 19 saved if this had been stopped 20, 30 years 20 ago, if they had come clean. 21 if you come up with an antagonist in 22 nicotine, we are going to put ourselves out of 23 business. 24 if we do that, we are in the process of 25 digging our own grave. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 no problem digging the graves of 480,000 2 americans every year, but they anthropomorphize 3 themselves, they are concerned about their 4 health, they have a survival instinct, they 5 do not want to dig their own grave. 6 they avoid any subjects on study that 7 relates human disease to smoke. 8 what are they going to do if they get 9 results with regard to the addiction of 10 nicotine? they bury it. bury results. 11 and he talked about not burying it. 12 they are in the pharmaceutical industry. they 13 knew this in the '70s, and they claimed we 14 do not know, nobody knows, they did not know -- 15 if they did not know, if executives did not know, 16 if the tobacco institute did not know, and they 17 kept putting this message out, how is my client 18 supposed to know? 19 if they had it over the surgeon general, 20 what chance did my client have? he was a young 21 kid. he smoked in the era of marlboro. he 22 grew up in the culture they created. 23 he grew up in the conspiracy. he was 24 born in 1953, the year they had the conspiracy. 25 they controlled the nicotine, they used united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 diammonium phosphate, they made additives to 2 precisely control the nicotine, to freebase the 3 molecule to make it so powerful. 4 they could control it, optimum 5 specificity. all these things that are 6 designed. 7 this is a highly sophisticated nicotine 8 delivery disease. deliberating free nicotine. 9 that is what made the sales take off in 10 marlboro. it was the soul of marlboro was this 11 ammoniation. made sales go up. 12 they had many, many opportunities to come 13 clean, tell the truth. take a different tact. 14 get back on a moral compass, go the right way, 15 and they did not. 16 and when it comes to witnesses, you may 17 say to yourself, how could a guy like that -- i 18 was listening to dr. schroeder. maybe you 19 were not believing him. maybe you were doubting 20 him. maybe you were saying, this is so 21 outrageous, it is so off topic. i do not know 22 how it could be allowed to be said. 23 it is because his honor gives you the 24 power to -- these are the believability of 25 witnesses, but down here you have a special united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 instruction, special power for witnesses. 2 when it comes to a guy that wants to call 3 himself an expert, you can consider what kind 4 of credentials he has, and you can reject what 5 he has to say. 6 i submit to you, you should reject what 7 he has to say. 8 is that too much? 9 but that is -- that is where it is. okay? 10 you know, this is the record that shows 11 he had immunosuppression that led to the 12 colostomy. it is embarrassing. that is just the 13 truth of it. 14 these are the engle jury findings. 15 fraud, conspiracy, negligence. 16 i'm going to save a few minutes. i'm 17 going to say thank you very much. 18 i know i talk fast. i always tell myself 19 i'll slow down. but i try to get a lot in. 20 mr. reilly is going to have a chance to 21 talk to you, and i ask you to give him the same 22 kind of attention you have given me. 23 i'll have about 15 minutes to address you 24 on the back end to comment on what he had to 25 say. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 thank you. 14 mr. schlesinger: let me make sure this 15 is working. 16 is it working? 17 let us take a look at this. may 22, 1992. 18 allergic rhinitis and asthma, chronic 19 bronchitis secondary to tobacco abuse. 20 that is class membership in a nutshell 21 from dr. tabb. 22 see it? that is class membership from 23 dr. tabb. 24 nicoderm, all of this, all of these 25 records, when he is constantly having bronchitis 1 and asthma, they are always trying to get him to 2 stop smoking. he is constantly taking smoking 3 cessation aids. he is deeply addicted, 4 according to mannino, who is unrebutted in that 5 regard. there is no doubt. 6 how about this. 7 ooh, what about that? 8 let us just make pretend for a second that 9 instead of may 22, 1992, it said may 22, 1982. 10 what do you think mr. reilly would do 11 with that record if he had that chart to work 12 with? do you think he would be supporting it 13 and saying trampoline defense, he is out, he is 14 before 1990. he is too soon. 15 do you want to know what the importance 16 of that record is? turn it around and ask 17 yourself what would they be doing if they had 18 that record and it said 1982. 19 every single thing else in the case, 20 exactly the same. what do you think they would 21 be doing? 22 because that is a critically important 23 record. it is contemporaneous, and it 24 should not be missed. 25 now look at this. dr. waller tabb. he 1 saw this man four different occasions. may 2 21st of '92. may 21. he talked about 3 bronchitis, attacks asthma. he made the 4 diagnosis, chronic bronchitis secondary to 5 tobacco abuse. all by itself, that is class 6 membership. 7 secondary to tobacco addiction. that is 8 class membership. 9 but then he saw him in june. continue 10 everything as is. those records are in there. 11 you have not seen them. you will see them. 12 then he saw him in august. continue 13 everything as is. you will see them. 14 but then he saw him in october. continue 15 everything as is. chronic bronchitis, 16 secondary to tobacco abuse was the ongoing 17 situation all the way through. 18 he did not rewrite on the chart. he 19 did not rewrite his diagnosis. but the fact is, 20 he did not change anything. he said continue 21 everything as is. 22 so this gentleman saw him for months and 23 months and months. 24 and then a year later, in may 25 of '93, 25 he okayed six months for refills of atrovent, 1 because that is what helped my client. a 2 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease medicine, 3 and that is what he used. 4 so then the next one here -- now, let me 5 show you this. super important. okay? 6 this is the document in the record, the 7 olden days of a medical record, the clinic, the 8 watson clinic. you open it up, and you look in 9 the record. and what do you see in the record? 10 no one has seen this until right now. 11 can we blow this up, keith? 12 video technician: go ahead. 13 mr. schlesinger: "keep in front of 14 chart." 15 the page in front of the chart said, 16 may 22, '92, allergic rhinitis and asthma, and 17 chronic bronchitis secondary to tobacco use. 18 that record continued to exist in the 19 chart in '92, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97, and '98. 20 how do we know? it is reviewed down here as 21 part of the chart as late as february 4, 1998. 22 and even when there was an asthma 23 exacerbation, which you heard about in the 24 context of he is having asthma and he is having 25 bronchitis, which all the records that he 1 pointed to that they said asthma also have 2 bronchitis. 3 he carried a diagnosis on this critically 4 important document that you have not seen until 5 now of allergic rhinitis and asthma and in 6 chronic bronchitis secondary to tobacco abuse 7 from '92 all the way through till 1998. 8 it was always there. it was never 9 removed. it is always part of the chart. 10 again, as late as '93, a year later, 11 dr. tabb, who saw him four times, was still 12 saying, i'm going to give you atrovent for 13 copd. 14 dr. catz saw him one time. one time. 15 mr. reilly -- let me show you this. 16 this was the first picture i showed you 17 of my client. remember, first picture. i did 18 it for a reason, because i wanted you to see 19 what made up this man's family. 20 you know, mr. reilly is an interesting 21 cat, because he kind of subtly takes shots at 22 my client. he does it nice. but he hit him 23 with this alcohol business. you look through 24 the medical records. 25 mr. reilly: objection, your honor, to 1 excuse me of taking shots is inappropriate. 2 the court: he also called you a nice 3 guy. 4 overruled. 5 mr. schlesinger: there are subtle ways 6 to dig into the character of a man to try to 7 prejudice you. sympathy and prejudice should 8 not make up your decision. 9 the point is this. the records are 10 clear. there is a bunch of records in there. 11 if you find them, you are better people than us, 12 because we obviously did not find them all. but 13 they are in the records, a lot of places. 14 he has not drunk in a year. he does not 15 drink. he is not a drinker. he is not a 16 drinker. 17 he was dancing and going to discos when 18 they had the hustle. he was having a party and 19 partying. 20 that is what life is all about. we should 21 be able to go out and have a party, and that 22 does not mean we are disqualified for being 23 worthy of the justification of a claim when our 24 lungs have been ripped out from emphysema from 25 chronic smoking and the powerful addiction. 1 the point is, there is no evidence of this 2 man being a drinker. he is not a drinker in 3 this case. most of the records are very 4 clear -- and what did he tell you? 5 i was scared of heroin. they scared me. 6 i never would have become a drug addict on 7 nicotine if i knew what it was. that had the 8 ring of truth. that was a spontaneous moment. 9 had they, instead of being seductionists, 10 lowering the threat level, promising you that 11 everything is okay, go ahead, you are a cowboy, 12 it would have been a different set of 13 circumstances. 14 what about this picture right here? we 15 have the true family. 1989, birth of his 16 daughter. he is a happy man. young guy. 17 oh, these old hair with the blue and the 18 hair from the '80s. but who is the important 19 member of the family that we did not point out 20 in the beginning of this case? who was the 21 important member of the family? right there. 22 right next to his lungs. right next to his 23 chest. where it is going to be. a pack of 24 marlboro reds. 25 now that completes the family, and that is 1 the family this man belonged to. he was an 2 integral part of the family. there was a part 3 of him in every step of the way. 4 and it ended up costing him an amount 5 that when you ask yourself, this is the price 6 we pay for pleasure, for satisfaction, for the 7 marketing terms that they like to use. those 8 insipid and absurd things about drug addiction 9 to try to say it is pleasure. okay? 10 you know who takes pleasure? tobacco 11 industry executives take pleasure. they take 12 pleasure from making money. they enjoy making 13 money. they get satisfaction from making 14 money. but they do it on top of a mountain of 15 graves that they disregard the human element. 16 that is why these cases right here in bartow are 17 so important. 18 so this is a road to nowhere. these are 19 the miles, okay, the marlboro miles that they 20 collect. 21 and where do they go? where do these 22 miles take you? they take you nowhere. 23 are they frequent flier miles? or are 24 they frequent "dier" miles? what are these 25 for? 1 that cat stevens song has been going 2 through my head this whole trial, miles from 3 nowhere. 4 where do these get you? they get you 5 nowhere. they end up in the closets of the 6 people that are dead, because by the time 7 there is enough of them saved, the luggage -- 8 you cannot go anywhere because you have got 9 emphysema. 10 it is a terrible thing, but it keeps 11 people smoking, at all times. it is a road to 12 nowhere. 13 what do they say? "our medical and 14 scientific witnesses will say whatever we want 15 them to say." clearly implying that if not 16 stating they lack credibility -- 17 mr. reilly: objection, your honor. 18 mr. schlesinger: -- credibility and 19 integrity. 20 the court: just a second. 21 mr. reilly: putting an affront of this 22 on the defense. 23 mr. schlesinger: this is in evidence. 24 the court: overruled. 25 mr. schlesinger: thanks, judge. 1 it is an internal document back during the 2 time of the conspiracy. when dr. proctor 3 explained one of the arms of the conspiracy was 4 the importance of defending the cases: we 5 intend to play hardball with the victims of 6 cigarette smoking when they press their claims 7 in the courtroom. this is the industry's 8 ultimate public relations sham. and our 9 position continues to mislead the public with a 10 wink. 11 okay? 12 that right there is internal. they had a 13 heavy motivation to not being exposed to some 14 of the problems from litigation, and this is 15 one of the ways they did it. 16 our medical witnesses will say whatever 17 we want them to say. 18 okay? doubt is our product. we talked 19 about that. 20 the industry would have been in a 21 deplorable position. that is how good this 22 worked. the key word is confusion. they are 23 giving addicted smokers, poor, pathetic drug 24 addicts, a psychological crutch to keep 25 smoking. 1 they are telling you, here is a filter, 2 and it is incapable of removing whatever 3 constituents. and by the way, deliver a nice 4 jolt of nicotine. 5 what did the smoker of the filtered 6 cigarettes do? he was born into the filtered 7 smoking generation. he relied on them and he 8 smoked them. 9 you are getting just as much tar and 10 nicotine as you would from a regular cigarette, 11 but you abandoned the regular cigarette on the 12 grounds of reduced risk to health. you lose 13 your filtration. 14 the surgeon general's reports say that 15 these filters and lights were used as a tool by 16 the tobacco institute to undermine prevention 17 and cessation efforts. 18 so dr. schroeder had said it is extremely 19 important for there to be continuity of care. 20 that was in taylor. 21 it did not fit when he came into this 22 courtroom, because nobody -- like catz, he 23 did not have continuity of care. "you have to 24 have multiple visits and continuity of care 25 before one can distinguish between copd and 1 asthma. that is extremely important." 2 that worked up the street a couple days 3 ago, but did not work in this courtroom when 4 you are trying to elevate what catz had to say 5 and think about it. catz, he was a little bit 6 of an outlier. 7 harman was an outlier. 8 ultimately, every note that harman wrote, 9 in subsequent notes dr. forman said, he is got 10 copd from smoking. 11 dr. forman was never thrown off course 12 when he was getting letters from dr. harman at 13 u of f. that is why you go for a second 14 opinion. no big deal. you go for a second 15 opinion. 16 that is what they did. 17 the court: five minutes. 18 mr. schlesinger: yes, sir. thank you. 19 so, this is mr. reilly's board. quite 20 frankly, there is a lot of errors in it. 21 let us talk about donna hernandez for a 22 second, disgruntled ex-wife. for a moment, i 23 thought we were making a little bit of peace. 24 i almost thought they would maybe get together 25 and hug it out, because she admitted there was 1 some old wounds. she did not feel great about 2 him. 3 she talked about some things she might 4 have told her ex-husband in his 20s. and i had 5 that cute picture of them. 6 but the point was, she thought she 7 offered to take him to see the picture of john 8 wayne, dead on the wall. he was not dead until 9 '79, so that might have been a mistake. 10 she said she thought she mentioned it. 11 but she also said john wayne was dead. he 12 was not dead in 1979. and she was talking about 13 the mid-'70s. 14 so that is a little bit of a mistake. 15 mr. reilly said: oh, she said she wanted 16 to take him down to the lab where she was 17 cutting up some black lungs from lung cancer. 18 but the fact is, when i asked her about 19 that, she said that was years ago. i could not 20 have taken him down to the lab. i had nothing 21 to do with black lungs. 22 so did she say to him smoking could make 23 you sick -- and you heard she was a crusader. 24 yeah. sure, she did. 25 but what did she also say about richard? 1 he did not absorb this. it did not register with 2 him. of course not. he is not a drug addict. 3 he is a cowboy. 4 so here's what his note says, and there is 5 a problem. it is not 26 times by 12 physicians 6 in the '90s. these people are in the 2000s. 7 keeler did not make a diagnosis of 8 asthma. she made a diagnosis of epinephrine 9 reaction and documented that he told them, "i 10 have emphysema." where else could he have 11 gotten that from, but a doctor? 12 so -- and waller tabb, who saw him four 13 times, was carrying the chronic bronchitis note 14 all the way along. 15 so when you start subtracting it from the 16 '90s, you end up with a number that is like 12. 17 every one of those people that said asthma, 18 look how many saw him one time. 19 randall, one time. keeler, one time. 20 bavinger, one time. when they said asthma, 21 they also said bronchitis. what did his expert 22 say? you had to have multiple visits. 23 and we hooked him with that. when he was 24 on the witness stand, as soon as i asked him, 25 he tried to dodge it, because he knew it was 1 coming. they were trying to get ready for it, 2 because they knew he had testified 3 inconsistently up the road just a few minutes 4 earlier. 5 this was very important. i want to go 6 over this with you for a minute. 7 it is very sad, because doctors do not know 8 this. doctors do not know this. take a look at 9 this -- 10 oh, by the way, when we get to punitive 11 damages, it only takes the morning to put on a 12 minor amount of information, and you guys would 13 never shirk your duty. 14 if we deserve punitive damages, you guys, 15 i trust, will be here to hear the rest of the 16 evidence, even if it takes another half a day. 17 and you are not going to say, well, i would have 18 given punies, but i want to get out of here, so 19 i'm not going to give them. 20 so we are not worried about that. 21 but when you give punitive damages, when 22 you punish for wrongful acts, here is what 23 you are going to say. you are going to speak to 24 them in the only language they understand, the 25 language of dollars. 1 their business plan is to make money, at 2 the expense of human lives. and we are going to 3 ask you to speak to them in the only language 4 they understand. 5 and what do they know here? they are 6 encouraging all the time. they are sending him 7 catalogs. he is responding on january 9th, 8 when two days later, he is in the watkins clinic 9 with tobacco addiction and tobacco dependence 10 being treated. 11 so he is buying jackets and all this other 12 stuff as an addict, and the doctors are trying 13 to treat him, and these guys are encouraging 14 him all along the way. hey, keep on smoking. 15 here are some jackets. here is a lunchbox 16 that is got a cooler in it. yeah, this is a 17 great cooler. you know what you can do with 18 this cooler? when you have your lung 19 transplant, you can transport your lungs to the 20 operating room in this cooler. 21 i mean, when you look at these things for 22 what they are, when you see things for what 23 they are, it is outrageous. okay? 24 so every time within days of the database 25 giving them -- keeping track of what he is up 1 to, he is fighting his addiction. he is 2 desperately fighting his addiction, and they 3 are encouraging him to keep smoking all the 4 way. here is three bucks off on a carton. 5 here he is quitting, but he is noticing 6 cravings. they are congratulating him on his 7 tobacco efforts. 8 three days later, he is getting coupons to 9 take money off cartons. 10 look at this. he is got the components of 11 cigarette smoking fixed obstruction. 12 forman's notes in order are brilliant. 13 he is recognizing, look, i think this smoking 14 has something to do with it. and then each 15 subsequent note, he shows how much more he 16 learns about it. 17 you read those notes. you will see how 18 well forman understood this case. 19 then in his planner, he quits smoking. 20 then he calls philip morris. do not 21 contact me. do not mail. leave me alone. i'm 22 trying to quit. 23 does that happen? no, it does not happen. 24 you know why? because philip morris 25 knows this condition is merely conversion 1 reversible. 2 what does that mean? conversion, i've 3 quit. reversible, we will get him back. we will 4 get him back. he will relapse. 5 the court: time's up. 6 mr. schlesinger: may i finish this one 7 piece, judge? one minute? 8 in any event, it says right here, the 9 bond clinic, he is got the tobacco abuse for 30 10 years with resulting emphysema, and it talks 11 about his attempts to quit. and it keeps on 12 going. 13 he is telling them he does not want to see 14 that anymore. they are calling him conversion 15 reversible. he still has tobacco addiction. 16 he is still part of their program. 17 in any event, dow chemical, they blocked 18 nicorette gum. they did not want people to 19 learn to quit. this was the first product 20 coming out on the market, and they boycotted 21 dow chemical so they would not put nicotine gum 22 out there. 23 and mannino and the surgeon general's 24 report all say chronic bronchitis and the other 25 are all parts of emphysema. 1 and this is also on the fraser trail: 2 "we will be known by the tracks we leave," a 3 seminole quote. i ran by that the past few 4 weeks. 5 that is an opportunity you have, and i 6 will tell you i wish you really good luck in 7 coming to a just result in this case. and 8 there is only -- there is one thing i just want 9 to read them, if the judge will just let me. 10 one thing i saved here. 11 i put it in the front, i bet. yes, i 12 did. 13 this is one thing i want to read you. i 14 read this in every single case. this is about 15 the book 1984. 16 the movie was richard hurt -- john hurt 17 and richard burton, and 1984, george orwell. 18 he was about to torture him. he is got him on 19 the table. leaning over and whispering. 20 and he says to him, "and above all, we do 21 not allow the dead to rise up against us. you 22 must stop imagining that posterity will 23 vindicate you, winston. 24 "posterity will never hear of you. you 25 will be lifted clean out from the stream of 1 history. we shall turn you into a gas and pour 2 you into the stratosphere. nothing will remain 3 of you. not a name in a register. not a 4 memory in a living brain. you will have been 5 annihilated in the past, as well as in the 6 future. you will never have existed." 7 my client exists. your verdict will be 8 known by the tracks we leave. it will make an 9 important statement. it will have an effect of 10 deterrence. 11 i thank you so, so much for taking the 12 time and being such a cohesive and good group. 13 and i look forward to turning this case over to 14 you now. it is all in your hands. thank you.
