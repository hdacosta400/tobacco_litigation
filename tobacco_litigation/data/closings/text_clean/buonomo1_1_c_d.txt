19 mr. geise: thank you, your honor. 20 counsel, mrs. bounomo, ladies and 21 gentleman of the jury. 22 we are at the end of the case. it started 23 a couple weeks ago. you have heard from the 24 witnesses. the evidence is in. all that is left 25 now is for you to do your job as the judges of the 1 facts. 2 it has been my great pleasure to get a 3 chance to try this case in front of the seven of 4 you. years from now i'll look back on this 5 experience and i'm remember your faces. we do not 6 get to talk a lot, but i'll remember your faces. 7 i'll remember how you reacted to certain evidence or 8 something funny that happened in the courtroom, and 9 it will be a fond memory for me. i got to tell you, 10 you were on time every day. we never waited for one 11 of you. you were here. you took your jobs 12 seriously. as an attorney, that is all we can ask 13 for, and i want to thank you for that. if it was not 14 for you, our system would not work. but it does 15 work. 16 unfortunately for you, there is a little 17 bit of work you have to do. you have to deliberate. 18 but you have paid attention. you have taken notes. 19 you have asked incredible questions. i have asked a 20 lot of questions. that shows that you are paying 21 attention, that you are listening to the evidence, 22 that you are taking this seriously, and we 23 appreciate that. for all you have done, i want to 24 say thank you. 25 as the judge told you repeatedly and said 1 it a couple times while dr. cummings was on the 2 stand, this case is about two issues and two issues 3 only. i put this up in my opening statement, but i 4 want to go back to them again. these are really the 5 two factual issues that matter in this case. was 6 mr. bounomo addicted to cigarettes containing 7 nicotine and, if so, did that addiction cause copd 8 before november 21st, 1996. those are the two 9 factual questions that you need to focus on to 10 answer the verdict form. 11 we talked throughout that the plaintiff 12 has the burden of proof on those two questions. the 13 court will instruct you about what that burden 14 means. counsel already talked about the greater 15 weight of the evidence. it is the plaintiff, not 16 the defense, but the plaintiff who has to prove that 17 mr. bounomo was addicted to cigarettes, and that he 18 smoked because of an addiction, not because he 19 wanted to, not because of choice. it is the 20 plaintiff that has to prove that mr. bounomo had 21 copd before november of 1996. and the plaintiff has 22 to prove both of those things by the greater weight 23 of the evidence. 24 plaintiff's counsel used these scales. he 25 said we start out like this, and it just has to get 1 just like that for them to meet the burden of proof. 2 that is not exactly true because the fact of the 3 matter is we do not have a burden of proof on 4 anything. so i do not have to put one weight, one 5 piece of evidence, anything on the scale. even if i 6 do not do that, the plaintiff still has to prove this 7 case by the greater weight of the evidence. it is 8 not a question of what they put in versus what i put 9 in. they have the full burden. and the greater 10 weight does not equal just a little bit. the greater 11 weight is not met through speculation. it is not met 12 through bare conclusions. it is not met through 13 hypotheticals. it is only met through proof. it is 14 the burden of proof. 15 he encouraged you at the beginning of the 16 trial to demand proof. as you listened to the 17 testimony, i think you will see that the plaintiff did 18 not satisfy that demand for proof. 19 the evidence in this case proves that mr. 20 buonomo was a stubborn man who did what he wanted to 21 do, especially when it came to smoking, but when it 22 came to other things as well, and i'll touch on 23 that. 24 the proof in this case is that he quit in 25 1995 and he never smoked again. the proof is that 1 it was his choice and his want that caused him to 2 start smoking, that caused him to continue smoking, 3 that caused him to stop smoking, and caused him to 4 never smoke again. 5 secondly, the plaintiffs simply cannot 6 prove that mr. bounomo had copd before 1996. the 7 medical evidence i'll go through demonstrates he had 8 congestive heart failure, and that congestive heart 9 failure, not copd, caused his death 13 years later 10 at the age of 80 years old. 11 i want to talk first about addiction. in 12 determining whether mr. bounomo was addicted to 13 cigarettes, you have to consider what it means to be 14 addicted. the instructions will not contain a 15 definition for you. you will need to decide that. 16 does it mean if you are addicted you have 17 to smoke no matter what and you cannot stop no matter 18 how hard you want to? is that addiction? or does 19 it mean you can stop smoking but only with 20 incredible willpower? or does it mean that smoking 21 controls you and you do not control smoking? 22 common sense tell us that addiction 23 prevents from doing something you would otherwise 24 do. for a smoker it means addiction prevents you 25 from quitting if you want to, or it compels you to 1 smoke when you do not want to. 2 last, the evidence demonstrated mr. 3 bounomo was a man who made his own choices. when it 4 came to smoking, he made a lot of them. let us look 5 at some of these. i showed you this in opening. i 6 think all the evidence that came in supported this. 7 he chose to start smoking. he chose to continue 8 smoking. he chose what brands he wanted to smoke. 9 he chose to switch brands. he chose to stick with 10 his favorite brands. he chose not to quit, and 11 eventually he chose to quit. 12 maybe there is one other thing i could put 13 on there we heard from dr. marks. he chose every 14 day to quit and to not start again. that was 13 15 years of decisions. these choices mr. bounomo made 16 based upon what he wanted to do. he controlled 17 these choices. smoking did not control him. 18 let us look quickly at his smoking 19 behavior. we heard he started smoking in the early 20 1940s. no one knows exactly when he started. no 21 one knows exactly why he started. no one knows what 22 brand mr. bounomo smoked for that first ten years he 23 smoked before he got back from korea. 24 that is an interesting point. nobody 25 knows if the brands he smoked were made by my 1 client, somebody else's client, or just penny 2 cigarettes. 3 mr. uustal: objection, your honor. 4 the court: sit down. overruled. 5 mr. uustal: i had an agreement about 6 this. 7 the court: step in the juryroom. 8 (jury absent) 9 (record read back as recorded above) 10 the court: there was evidence about that. 11 mr. uustal: but, your honor, i agreed to 12 take out the jury instruction about r.j. reynolds' 13 relation to the other parties. 14 the court: the objection as to this phase 15 is irrelevant. the issue is not whether he was 16 addicted to reynolds' cigarettes. that has been 17 established in every trial. the issue of whether he 18 was addicted at all which is your company's fault 19 because of your cigarettes is a phase-two question. 20 so i'm going to instruct the jury about that, and 21 then you can continue. 22 bring the jury in. 23 (jury present) 24 the court: just so it is clear, as we 25 proceed in this phase of the trial, it is irrelevant 1 which cigarettes mr. bounomo was smoking as far as 2 the question of whether he was addicted or not and 3 whether or not it caused him to suffer a disease. 4 it would be relevant in phase two if we reach phase 5 two, but it is not relevant on the issues you are 6 being asked to decide in this phase. 7 you may proceed. 8 mr. geise: thank you, your honor. 9 we also heard from mrs. bounomo how mr. 10 bounomo selected his cigarettes. she testified when 11 he came from korea in 1952 he was smoking camels, 12 lucky strike, and chesterfield. but she did not like 13 the smell of lucky strike and chesterfield, so she 14 asked him to smoke camel, and he did. that is how 15 he settled on that brand, camel. it was not based on 16 addiction or advertising. it was because his wife 17 did not like the smell of the other cigarettes and 18 encouraged him to smoke camels. he smoked camels 19 from the 1950s to the 1970s. we heard he would try 20 other brands, but he would return to camels because 21 he liked their taste. later his wife told us that 22 he switched to salem because he liked the menthol 23 flavor of salem. again, he chose his brand based on 24 taste, not advertising, not addiction, but taste. 25 it was his choice, a choice based on taste. 1 there is also no dispute in the case that 2 mr. bounomo stopped smoking. there is no question 3 whether he could or could not quit smoking. he did. 4 he answered that question for you. it is a fact 5 that mr. bounomo not only could quit smoking but he 6 did quit smoking just like the 60 million other 7 smokers who have quit, and the ninety percent of those 8 smokers who have quit without using any aids or 9 cessation methods. 10 we heard testimony that mr. buonomo tried 11 to quit many times. i think if we look at the 12 evidence behind those quit attempts, we can see how 13 serious those attempts were. mrs. bounomo told you 14 that he would have a pack of cigarettes in the 15 morning, say he was going to stop, he would throw 16 the pack away, but he would not throw the carton 17 away. he kept a carton in the closet so when he 18 wanted a cigarette he would go to the closet and get 19 one. when he did this, she testified he was not even 20 sure if her husband intended to give up cigarettes 21 permanently. 22 if you want to stop, you have to intend to 23 give up permanently. other times mrs. bounomo said 24 after he said he was going to stop, a little while 25 later he would say well, maybe i'm going to cut 1 back. 2 again, these are not the actions of 3 someone who is really serious about quitting, not 4 someone who is motivated to quit. 5 we heard about word search and hard candy 6 and sweets and things mr. bounomo might have done to 7 keep his mind off smoking at the time he was trying 8 to quit. but we also heard that he did word 9 searches and ate candy and loved sweets while he was 10 smoking. you heard he was a big sweets guy. he 11 did not use these things to replace smoking. it is 12 not like he stopped and picked up sweats or did word 13 searches to replace smoking to give him something to 14 do. these are things he always enjoyed doing. 15 you also heard that anybody could quit 16 smoking, even smokers who were addicted. dr. 17 henningfield, dr. cummings, everybody agrees 18 addiction does not mean you cannot quit. sure, it 19 might be harder for some people to quit than others. 20 everyone is different. some people might never 21 quit. but other people like mr. bounomo will quit. 22 you heard from dr. marks that smoking does not take 23 away your free will. smoking does not make you lose 24 the ability to think rationally. smoking does not 25 prevent you from being able to make decisions. 1 smoking does not rob you of your ability to chose 2 not to smoke if that is your choice. 3 dr. cummings told you that motivation is 4 the key. he said it a number of times. you got to 5 want to quit. dr. cummings testified trying 6 different methods to quit is an indication of 7 motivation. 8 let us look at some of the methods mr. 9 bounomo did not use to quit. never used nicotine 10 gum. never used a nicotine patch. never sought 11 medical help. never visited a smoking cessation 12 clinic. never tried hypnosis. never threw out his 13 cigarette carton, his matches, or his ashtrays. not 14 doing those things is a sign there was not the 15 motivation to quit. you got to want to quit. why 16 did not he do those things? because he did not want 17 to go without smoking. we heard that mr. bounomo 18 would stop smoking briefly but then he would start 19 again. mrs. bounomo told you when he would start 20 again, she never asked him why he started smoking 21 again and he never told her. 22 let us assume that dr. berndt and dr. 23 bolton, the two treating physicians that first saw 24 mr. bounomo in may of 1995 and said he quit a year 25 earlier -- we all remember those documents, and we 1 remember the testimony from dr. bolton. let us 2 assume they are wrong, that he never told them he 3 stopped in 1994, and let us assume mr. bounomo did 4 stop in 1995. 5 the plaintiff will tell you the only 6 reason mr. bounomo stopped in 1995 is because he was 7 hospitalized and because he was on oxygen. you 8 heard mr. bounomo had not been hospitalized or been 9 to a doctor in 40 years. so for the first time in 10 over four decades he is in a hospital. he is 11 uncomfortable. does not feel well. he is in 12 respiratory failure. he is irritable. who would not 13 be? he is hooked up to tubes. he has doctors 14 coming in. he is taken out of his normal life. of 15 course you are going to be uncomfortable. while he 16 was in the hospital he could not smoke. he asked for 17 three things. he asked for a cigarette, he asked 18 for a sandwich, and he asked for a newspaper. did 19 he ask for these three things because was addicted 20 to all these of those, or did he ask for those three 21 things because those were the things that would make 22 him comfortable, to take him back to what comforts 23 him. 24 the interesting thing is after mr. bounomo 25 got out of the hospital he went back to eating 1 sandwiches. he kept reading the newspaper. but he 2 never went back to smoking. so does that mean he 3 was addicted to sandwiches and the newspaper or the 4 things he wanted to do? 5 it is odd. dr. cummings told you that 6 addiction is a loss of control. but when mr. 7 bounomo lost control for the first time in 40 years, 8 that is when he quit. dr. marks told you when he 9 was in the hospital, this was the first time this 10 gentleman lost control, that he could not do what he 11 wanted to do, and it was that first time he lost 12 control that he stopped smoking not just until he 13 got out of the hospital but for the rest of his 14 life, for the next 13 years. 15 mrs. bounomo told us that mr. bounomo was 16 first angry and irritable in the hospital, but after 17 a few days he was calmer and okay. that is while he 18 was quitting once and for all. 19 so we talked about the symptoms of 20 nicotine withdrawal, and we talked about 21 irritability, and we talked about how it changes 22 your personality if this is a sign of addiction. 23 mr. bounomo's daughter testified. look 24 what she told us about his change in personality 25 when he quit. she was asked: 1 "question: i think you told us you did not 2 notice any change in his personality after he 3 stopped smoking in 1995. is that fair to say? 4 "answer: yes. 5 no change in his personality when he quit 6 after smoking. even though we did not hear from mr. 7 bounomo in this case, we learned a lot about him. 8 we learned this was a man who did what he wanted to 9 do. just think of the persistence of a person who 10 decides they are not going to drive a vehicle. this 11 is hard for us to fathom. he knew how to drive. he 12 just made a decision not to. 13 dr. marks told you this is an indication 14 of somebody's personality, that they can make their 15 decision and go forward with it even if it causes 16 some inconvenience. mr. bounomo had the similar 17 choices with smoking. 18 in the 1950s after he and mrs. bounomo 19 were married, she asked please do not light up the 20 cigarettes in the bedroom. his response was he did 21 it anyway. in the 1970s she kept nagging him about 22 his smoking. they saw the warnings on the package 23 telling him it was dangerous, and he kept smoking. 24 in the 1980s she continued to get on his case, but 25 he did not respond by not smoking. 1 you remember what ms. bounomo said about 2 her husband's personality? he was a very stubborn 3 person who had his own mind and did what he wanted 4 to do. while it was just a phrase, she said he was 5 so stubborn you could not change his mind if he had a 6 gun in his back. that was his personality. his 7 daughter marilyn told you the same thing. she 8 testified he was a very decisive man, and that he 9 believed in his opinion, and it was very, very hard 10 to sway him. 11 the decisions to smoke was like other 12 decisions in his life. he made up his mind what he 13 was going to do, and no one could convince him 14 otherwise. he did not want to stop smoking so he 15 did not. 16 i want to talk a little bit about the 17 people who talked about whether mr. bounomo was 18 addicted or not, the plaintiff's experts, their 19 treating physicians who they made their experts in 20 this case that you saw on video. they testified 21 that mr. buonomo was addicted. but when he saw each 22 one of them, they already stopped smoking. they 23 admitted they were not experts on addiction. all the 24 doctors testified to that testifying by video. they 25 knew nothing about his attempts to quit. they 1 did not know when or how he quit. based on that 2 simple fact he smoked, they said he was addicted. 3 that is not enough. that is not enough proof. 4 you also heard from dr. cummings. i want 5 to spend a minute or two talking about dr. cummings. 6 plaintiff's counsel talked about being a stranger to 7 the courtroom in the first part of his closing 8 argument. 9 dr. cummings is no stranger to a 10 courtroom. frankly, he spends more time in court 11 than i do. dr. cummings is a general in the war on 12 tobacco. you heard him say this. in this case, i 13 think his battlefield maps were a little off, and he 14 is at the wrong spot for this case. 15 we talked in opening statement and voir 16 dire about the right juror for the right case. i'm 17 not sure what dr. cummings came here to talk about 18 was pertinent to the two issues you need to decide. 19 he talks about a quit line in new york that receives 20 thousands of calls a year from smokers who want to 21 quit. 22 mr. bounomo never called the quit line in 23 new york or anywhere else. dr. cummings talks about 24 what he does in his smoking cessation clinics. mr. 25 bounomo did not go to smoking cessation clinics. dr. 1 cummings combed his archives to select the most 2 inflammatory statements he could find to play for 3 you, but there is not a bit of evidence in this case 4 that mr. bounomo saw any of those clips he played or 5 saw the articles from some of the newspapers from 6 the boston globe. 7 dr. cummings talked about sergeant bilco, 8 the beverly hillbillies, and the flintstones. there 9 was no testimony in this case that mr. bounomo saw 10 those shows. dr. cummings showed you lots of 11 advertising as well. but mrs. bounomo told you she 12 does not know that mr. bounomo ever picked a brand of 13 cigarette based on advertisement. 14 dr. cummings talked about studying people 15 in 20 countries to determine their smoking habits, 16 but he never talked to you about mr. bounomo's 17 smoking habits. he talked about different tools he 18 uses to determine if a hypothetical person is 19 addicted, but he did not tell you that mr. bounomo 20 was addicted. in fact, if you go back to the 21 transcript, he did not utter mr. bounomo's name once. 22 in all the sound bites and the film clips 23 and all the things dr. cummings did put up about 24 smoking and addiction, there was one person at left 25 out of his montage, and that was mr. buonomo. 1 you heard in 1975 when mr. bounomo caught 2 his daughter smoking he reprimanded her that night 3 and told her do not do this, you will never be able 4 to quit. he told her that in 1975. he knew smoking 5 would be difficult to quit. he told her that. this 6 is 13 years before surgeon general koop calls it an 7 addiction. i think dr. cummings was waging a 8 different war from a different place, and a general 9 did not belong in this case. 10 dr. henningfield was the same way. let us 11 look at a clip from dr. henningfield. 12 "question: doctor, let us talk but your 13 knowledge of the smoker or smokers in this case. 14 you do not know the name or names of any of the 15 smokers involved in this case do you? 16 "answer: that is correct. 17 "question: you do not know the smoking 18 behavior of the smoker or smokers in this case, do 19 you? 20 "answer: no, i do not. 21 "question: for example, whether a smoker 22 quit or not is unknown to you? 23 "answer: that is correct. 24 dr. cummings and dr. henningfield know a 25 load about addiction in general, but they did not say 1 anything about addiction specific to mr. buonomo. 2 ask yourself how they help you answer the question 3 in this case about mr. buonomo because you need 4 proof about mr. buonomo's addiction, not somebody 5 else. 6 the only qualified professional you heard 7 from that diagnoses people with addictions and 8 dependancies who offered an opinion about mr. 9 buonomo was dr. marks. and his opinion about mr. 10 buonomo was that he was not clinically addicted or 11 dependent. he always had the ability to quit and he 12 made the decision not to smoke in 1995 and every day 13 for the next 13 years. 14 now, i mentioned in opening statement that 15 the words addiction and nicotine dependence are just 16 labels. dr. cummings talked about the labels and 17 how they changed over time. he said in 1964 the 18 surgeon general and the world health organization 19 called smoking a habit. they did not call it an 20 addiction. then in 1977 and 1982 the surgeon 21 general called it a personal choice behavior. then 22 in 1988 the surgeon general called it an addiction. 23 now other organizations call it a dependence. 24 i'm not sure what counsel is going to say 25 when he gets up to rebut, but i'm sure you will see 1 some of the film clips dr. cummings played for you. 2 i'm certain of that. they will probably say that my 3 client and other tobacco companies said those things 4 to give a crutch to mr. buonomo and other smokers 5 like them. if reynolds was giving him a crutch, 6 what was the surgeon general doing in 1964? what 7 was the world health organization doing? 8 i do not want to get hung up on labels. 9 but if you follow the bouncing label in this case, 10 let us assume someone has -- their smoking behavior 11 is what it is and it does not change. in 1964 that 12 person is going to be habituated, in 1977 they are 13 going to have a behavior, in 1988 they are going to 14 have an addiction, and maybe now they have a 15 dependancy. their smoking behavior would have 16 stayed the same all along. that is why i do not want 17 to get hung up on terms like addiction and 18 dependence. those words are labels. at the end of 19 the day, the only thing that matters is mr. 20 buonomo's smoking behavior, not what we call it. 21 and dr. cummings agreed on this. he said the 22 fundamental question is whether people can quit 23 smoking. mr. buonomo answered that fundamental 24 question. he quit smoking. so when we talk about 25 standard, fagerstrom, the heaviness of smoking 1 index, the dsm, the best standard to use in this 2 case to determine if mr. buonomo could quit smoking 3 is whether he did, and we know how he answered that 4 standard. 5 a final thought about the label addiction. 6 mrs. buonomo smoked for 19 years and then quit. but 7 she does not think she was addicted and neither does 8 her family. the family did not put that label on 9 her. 10 interestingly, mr. buonomo never put the 11 label of addiction on himself. his daughter 12 testified the following: i do not recall him ever 13 saying the word addicted to me personally. mrs. 14 buonomo testified in her response to one of your 15 questions that he never called himself addicted. 16 you heard that this lawsuit was filed 17 before he passed away. mr. buonomo never called 18 himself addicted after he stopped or before he 19 stopped, or before he filed the lawsuit or after he 20 filed the lawsuit. sure he thought it would be hard 21 to quit, but he was able to quit. maybe that is not 22 addiction. if mr. buonomo did not say he himself was 23 addicted, should we? 24 i want to switch gears completely now and 25 talk about the medical issues. before i get to the 1862 1 medical evidence you saw and the testimony you 2 heard, i want to point out something you probably 3 noticed. 4 during this trial you did not see a single 5 medical record until we started our part of the 6 case. plaintiffs did not put a single medical record 7 up on the overhead with their witnesses to talk 8 about mr. bounomo's medical condition. they did not 9 show you a single x-ray or a single ct scan. they 10 did not show you any echocardiograms. instead, they 11 showed you canned videos from their four experts. 12 that is what they showed you. they gave you their 13 bear bones conclusions without walking you through 14 all the reasons for their opinions. i hope you ask 15 yourselves why that happened. 16 plaintiff counsel has attacked the experts 17 i called in, attacked a gentleman who is board 18 certified in cardiology and testified today, a man 19 who does it for a living. he is a cardiologist. he 20 teaches other doctors how to be cardiologists. he 21 works hard. that is what he does. 22 they attacked a man who is a diagnostic 23 radiologist. he is board certified. it is all he 24 does is look at radiology. sure he does not have 25 opinions on these other areas because that is was he 1 does. that is his expertise. 2 and they attacked the pulmonologist and 3 what he does is pulmonology. he came in here and 4 talked to you about pulmonology. they attacked dr. 5 marks for doing the same thing, for doing what he 6 does. they also seem to indicate there was 7 something wrong for these people getting paid for 8 the time they put in in this case, the time they put 9 in to prepare, to come here, to sit here and answer 10 my questions, answer their questions, and answer 11 your questions. they wanted to prepare themselves 12 for that, and they did. 13 some of the time they spent, they asked, 14 did you meet with lawyers, did you meet with mr. 15 geise, did you talk this over? yes, they did meet 16 with me. do you know why? because i'm not a 17 cardiologist or pulmonologist, and i'm not a 18 radiologist. so if i do not meet with the experts 19 who can tell me about those areas, i cannot present a 20 case to you knowing what is going on. 21 now, the interesting thing is i needed to 22 be taught about radiology and cardiology and 23 pulmonology because just like dr. issa and dr. 24 silver and dr. feinstein, i'm not a radiologist, 25 i'm not a cardiologist, i'm not a pulmonologist. 1 that is why i needed to be taught. 2 in order to win this case, the plaintiff 3 must prove that mr. buonomo had copd caused by 4 smoking and they must prove that he had that disease 5 before november 21, 1996. if the proof does not 6 support that claim, they cannot meet their burden and 7 they lose. 8 i talked in opening about different kinds 9 of evidence that proves mr. buonomo did not have 10 copd. after hearing the evidence, let us see how 11 these line up. first one, no pulmonary function 12 test. i was going to show you the clips from every 13 doctor who testified there was no pft ever 14 performed, but frankly i think we all got that 15 point. a pft was never performed by any of mr. 16 buonomo's doctors, not dr. berndt, not dr. bolton, 17 not dr. issa, not dr. silver, not dr. feinstein, not 18 a doctor he saw at any point between 1995 and 2008. 19 no one. no one. that is the proof on the pft. 20 when i think of all the doctors that could 21 have performed a pft at some point over the 13 22 years, i'm reminded of a story one of my coaches 23 told me in high school. i heard it again recently 24 and i thought it applied. 25 it is a story about four people, 1 everybody, somebody, anybody, and nobody. there was 2 an important job that needed to be done. everybody 3 was asked to do it. everybody was sure somebody 4 would do it. anybody could have done it, but nobody 5 did it. so when the job did not get done, somebody 6 got angry because it was everybody's job. everybody 7 though anybody could do it, but nobody realized 8 everybody would not to it, so the job never got done. 9 that is what happened here with the 10 pulmonary function test. dr. bolton, dr. silver, 11 dr. issa, dr. feinstein, everybody, somebody, 12 anybody, nobody, over the course of the 13 years the 13 pft never got done. the absence of a pft alone is 14 the absence of proof that would be needed to prove 15 the pft is necessary. you do not need to do it. 16 but look at the standards. you heard the 17 testimony by dr. klotz about the standards set out 18 by the american thoracic society and the gold, the 19 gold standard, national and international 20 organizations of doctors, pulmonologists who put the 21 standard for how you diagnose copd. just like 22 needing that blood sugar test to show if somebody is 23 a diabetic, you have to conduct a pulmonary function 24 test to see if someone has copd. 25 let us look at some of the testimony from 1 the plaintiff's experts on these points. dr. issa 2 agreed the american thoracic society said a pft is 3 necessary. he is asked to look through it. he has 4 pointed out that it said pulmonary function 5 measurements are necessary for diagnosis and 6 assessment of the severity of this disease. dr. 7 issa says if it is written in this journal, i guess 8 i agree. 9 dr. bolton talked about the global 10 initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease 11 standard. he was asked the following? spirometry 12 should be undertaken in all patients who may have 13 copd. it is needed to make a confident diagnosis of 14 copd. if you want to have a confident diagnosis 15 that gives you the greater weight of the evidence, 16 you need to do a pft. 17 it is not just the ats, it is not just the 18 gold standard, or dr. klotz who says you need to do 19 a pft. the plaintiff's own experts, when they are 20 not testifying in this case, think the same thing. 21 let us look first as dr. issa. you might 22 recall dr. issa. i think -- counsel, if i may. dr. 23 issa referred to cecil's as the bible of internal 24 medicine. you might remember that from his 25 videotape. he called it the bible. what dr. issa 1 said is in his bible it says spirometry, the measure 2 of fev1 and fvc is the gold standard for diagnosing 3 copd. you heard dr. klotz talked about fev1 and 4 fvc. the bible, according to dr. issa, says you 5 have to do spirometry. dr. issa did not do a 6 pulmonary function test or spirometry. dr. issa 7 is not alone. 8 dr. bolton is the one pulmonologist that 9 the plaintiffs called. one. he was very confident 10 he did not need to do a pft to diagnose copd. he is 11 talking about the gold classification. here he is 12 asked about it. said the gold classification relies 13 on pulmonary spirometry, and in my opinio i do not 14 need for the most part a pulmonary spirometry to 15 make a diagnosis of copd. he does not need it. it 16 is a standard recognized by national and 17 international pulmonologists, but he does not need to 18 do a pft. 19 but let us at some of the other things dr. 20 bolton does. he is flipping thru it in the video. 21 he has a brochure he has in his waiting rooms, and 22 he hands out to all his patients that come in. it 23 is entitled a brief guide to copd including chronic 24 bronchitis and emphysema. and the guide has a 25 section in it that says how does copd get diagnosed. 1 and the pamphlet that dr. bolton gives his patients 2 says the following? 3 on page ten of the brochure, under how is 4 copd diagnosed, it says the healthcare provider 5 diagnoses copd by combining an evaluation of your 6 symptoms with a breathing test that measures how 7 much air you can exhale and how fast you can exhale. 8 that is pulmonary function. 9 the pamphlet that dr. bolton gives his 10 patients says you need to do a pulmonary function 11 test. but it gets even better. dr. bolton wrote an 12 article and he was asked about the article. in his 13 article he writes screening pulmonary function 14 studies are needed to determine the type, 15 obstructive or restrictive, and degree, and response 16 to bronchodilator studies. more sophisticated 17 pulmonary function studies will be indicated. 18 you heard you do a pulmonary function test 19 to determine the amount of obstruction. you heard 20 it tells you the degree and response to broncho 21 dilator studies, after you take the broncho dilator, 22 you test again to see if there is an any impact. 23 that is how you make this diagnosis. that is what 24 dr. bolton wrote. now, here i do not need to do a 25 pft. 1 beyond the initial diagnosis of copd, dr. 2 bolton also wrote this: following up pulmonary 3 function studies at six-month intervals are 4 indicated to determine the progress of disease. 5 there are two reasons to do a pft. one, 6 to make a diagnosis. two, to see what the person's 7 lung function is as they progress. that is what dr. 8 bolton is writing about, six-month intervals. let us 9 see. then 13 years after mr. buonomo is diagnosed, 10 if you took a pft every six months, that would have 11 been 26 times you would have done a pulmonary 12 function test according to dr. bolton. how many 13 times did mr. buonomo's doctors do one? zero. 14 so when dr. bolton is not acting as an 15 expert, he writes that a pft is needed and he gives 16 his patients literature that tells them the 17 diagnosis of copd must include a breathing test. 18 but he testified to you here that was not the case. 19 dr. issa did not do a pft and said it was not 20 necessary, but what he calls his bible says you need 21 to do it. 22 counsel put up a list of all the doctors 23 who treated and diagnosed copd. i crossed off the 24 top here because the same list applies to doctors 25 who did not do a pft. same list. same doctors. all 1 of them had the chance to do a pulmonary function 2 test. nobody did one. not before any one of them 3 diagnosed with copd, not when they were treating him 4 for copd, not when he was originally diagnosed, not 5 in the 13 years after that. without a pft, there is 6 no proof necessary to demonstrate the diagnosis of 7 copd, and that failure alone is enough to decide the 8 entire medical question. that alone is the failure 9 of proof that tips the scales in my client's favor. 10 but there is more. there is more medical 11 evidence you saw. 12 mr. buonomo's medical condition is at odds 13 with copd. remember the c stands for chronic? 14 there is nothing chronic about mr. buonomo's medical 15 condition when he seeks treatments in may of 1995. 16 i know you are tired of seeing the record from dr. 17 berndt when he went in so i'm not going to put it up 18 again. you probably have it memorized. no 19 bothersome cough. no hemoptysis. he denied 20 shortness of breath except on much exertion. this 21 is a 67-year-old man in 1995. no shortness of 22 breath except on much exertion. no chronic problems 23 whatsoever. 24 the testimony you heard from his family 25 further proves that he did not have chronic health 1 problems before 1995. mrs. buonomo testified he 2 had not seen a doctor for 40 years. she testified in 3 the decade prior to the diagnosis, the 1980s, he was 4 healthy. he did not have a cough. he retired in '92 5 and '93 because he wanted to. he worked hard his 6 whole life and he wanted to retire. 7 a couple years later in the spring of '95 8 they called him and say hey, you want to come back 9 to work part-time, and he did it. i asked her was 10 there any medical reason or any concern about his 11 going not back to work. there was none. he did not 12 have any of these chronic symptoms at that point. 13 ms. diaz, mr. buonomo's granddaughter, 14 testified prior to 1995 she did not see him become 15 short of breath and never heard him coughing. she 16 called him being in good health, no trouble 17 breathing, no cough, no shortness of breath. 18 one of you asked mrs. buonomo daughter, 19 paula levis, what took her father so long to see a 20 doctor. why did it take 40 years? she told you he 21 only went to the doctor if he was sick. that makes 22 sense. he was not sick in the 60 years leading up to 23 may of 1995. he had no chronic symptoms. he had no 24 chronic sickness. 25 because copd is a chronic disease, if mr. 1 bounomo had it in 1995 and that was the reason for 2 his symptoms, they would have presented sooner, but 3 they did not. 4 while we are talking about dr. berndt, the 5 first doctor who saw him, the first doctor who 6 started this chain of medical records, i'm sure 7 counsel is going to make a bigger deal when he comes 8 up here about the fact that my experts disagree with 9 these treating physicians. he touched on it the 10 first time. i'm sure when i sit down he is going to 11 touch on it again. 12 but my doctors are not the only ones who 13 said something in the treater's records was wrong. 14 mrs. buonomo went through a number of errors in dr. 15 berndt's records with you. dr. berndt says mr. 16 buonomo was not compliant and did not like 17 physicians. dr. berndt said he had not smoked in 18 year. everybody told you that is not true. dr. 19 berndt recorded he had quit drinking about ten years 20 or so. she told you he never had any drinking 21 issues. dr. berndt told you he did not exercise. 22 she told you he walked all over the place. finally, 23 dr. berndt said he did not drive because he lived in 24 brooklyn, new york. she told you that was wrong. 25 he was in new jersey. he was on the other side of 1 the river. 2 it must be okay for the plaintiffs to 3 disagree with the treating physicians when they want 4 to, but it is not okay for my medical experts to 5 give you medical reasons why they disagree. 6 i want to talk about this point of 7 emphysema, emphysematous changes. again, i'm not at 8 big label guy. but i want to talk about emphysema. 9 no matter what people call it, emphysematous 10 changes, bullae emphysema, or emphysema, i think 11 everybody can agree emphysema is an anatomical 12 feature in somebody's lung that is a destruction of 13 the air sacs. and remember the doctor showing you 14 those air sacs. that is what it is. that is what 15 emphysema refers to. when you want to talk about 16 bullae changes, that is what experts do. they stick 17 in their field. for dr. dautenhahn as a 18 radiologist, what radiologists say is emphysematous 19 changes. they want to say he disagreed over 20 everything. you saw a lot of x-rays, x-ray reports, 21 ct reports from 2007, 2008, that use the same 22 language that dr. dautenhahn used, emphysematous 23 changes. 24 you can have these changes, but not as 25 copd. people who do not have copd have them. the 1 only way to know if emphysematous changes, or 2 emphysema, or bullae emphysema, the only way to know 3 if that is copd is to do a pulmonary function test. 4 more importantly, emphysema is permanent. 5 dr. bolton said it is permanent and irreversible. 6 if you have it, if you have that anatomical 7 destruction at some point, you are going to have it 8 from here to the rest of your life. so if it 9 appears on one x-ray, it will appear on every other 10 one because it is permanent and irreversible. 11 there are two ways that you can diagnose 12 emphysema, pathology and radiology. two ways you 13 can do it on pathology. you can do a lung biopsy. 14 that is when a person is alive, they use a 15 procedure, a surgery. they go into a person's lung 16 and you get out a piece of the tissue of their lung 17 and you look at it. if you look at it you can see 18 the destruction of those air sacs. mr. buonomo 19 never had a biopsy done. 20 the second way you can do it on pathology 21 is autopsy. after a person passes away, you can 22 autopsy, you can look for these things. 23 despite the fact that this lawsuit was 24 filed before mr. buonomo died and cause of death was 25 an issue. and his diagnosis was an issue, no 1 autopsy was conducted either looking for 2 pathological proof of copd or emphysema. there 3 is not that proof in this case. it is not there. 4 if addition to pathology, you can see 5 these emphysematous changes or emphysema on 6 radiology. plaintiffs did not call a single 7 radiologist. none of their treaters were 8 radiologists. they all admitted it. 9 but reynolds did. we called dr. 10 dautenhahn, a man who looks at thousands of chest 11 cts. thousands of x-rays. he teaches radiology. 12 he testified from his review of all the films and we 13 went through them yesterday. went through one after 14 the other. he told you the first time that he saw 15 any emphysematous change, any emphysema at all, was 16 in 2007. 17 i want to talk a little bit about some of 18 the findings before and see what happened in 1995 up 19 to 2007. mr. buonomo had a ct scan of his chest in 20 may of 1995. you heard ct is a much more sensitive 21 way to see the changes, much more sensitive than a 22 chest x-ray. if we look at the report, dr. styles 23 was the radiologist who read the ct. you never 24 heard any testimony from dr. styles. dr. styles' 25 impression, moderate right plural effusion with 1 focus of atelectasis or other infiltrate at the 2 right lung base posterior. no evidence of discrete 3 pulmonary nodule mass, no evidence of significant 4 interstitial disease. 5 dr. styles did not record hyperinflation, 6 he did not record blebs. he did not record bullae or 7 emphysematous changes. dr. dautenhahn agreed with 8 this finding. dr. styles we assume agreed with this 9 finding. 10 the plaintiffs will tell you they were 11 looking for mediastinal disease here. come on. 12 radiologists have to look at the film and write down 13 what they see. they do not write down what someone 14 else is asking them to look for. they write down 15 what they see. that is their professional 16 obligation. dr. styles did not see anything 17 consisting with emphysema or copd in may of '95. 18 dr. bolton, another plaintiff expert. he 19 agrees with what dr. styles says. there is no 20 mention of blebs or bullae in the lungs as one would 21 expect in a case where a patient who had copd or 22 emphysema. on this report, it is not mentioned. 23 okay, and the treating radiologist here in 24 his examination notes did not know of any condition 25 in mr. bounomo's ct scan from may of 1995 consistent 1 with emphysema? correct. there is no impression 2 that would indicate emphysema by this cat scan. 3 that is dr. bolton. did he look at the 4 x-ray or ct scan and seeing something different? we 5 did not hear about that. 6 the x-ray report that lists bullae 7 changes, october of 1995, lots of testimony on this. 8 dr. klotz told you he looked at it and did not see 9 it. dr. klotz said he thinks there was bullae 10 emphysema in 2007. dr. dautenhahn showed you the 11 x-ray, put it up there, and said there is no bullae 12 changes in this. nothing. 13 did plaintiffs call anyone to show you 14 where the bullae changes were? did plaintiffs call 15 the radiologist who wrote the record to have him 16 show you or explain what he is talking about? did 17 the plaintiff give you any proof at all as to where 18 or what bullae changes they were referring to there? 19 no. because they did not show you a single x-ray or 20 a single ct in their case. 21 the reason behind beyond what dr. 22 dautenhahn said when he looked at the radiology, the 23 reason we know there is no bullae changes or 24 emphysematous change in october of 1995 is because 25 they are not on the may ct that dr. styles talked 1 about. he does not describe them. 2 and you remember these changes are 3 permanent. they would be there. they were not 4 there. the only thing we know a month later in 5 1995, the radiologist does not mention them either. 6 if he thought they were there in october, poof, they 7 are gone in november of '95. that is not how 8 emphysema works. it is not how copd works. they 9 are permanent, irreversible. 10 dr. dautenhahn admitted he saw 11 emphysematous changes in 2007, but does not see 12 anything prior to that. nothing prior to november 13 21, 1996. 14 there is no proof mr. buonomo had copd 15 before november 21, 1996. a pft is needed to make a 16 diagnosis. one was never done. mr. buonomo did not 17 have chronic symptoms consistent with copd at that 18 point. the doctors never took a biopsy, and you 19 cannot see emphysema on any other radiology. when 20 you consider all this evidence, when you demand 21 proof, the plaintiff cannot provide it before 22 november of 1996. 23 as i said, we do not have the burden of 24 proof to show you anything. but we did put on 25 evidence and i think we proved what mr. buonomo had 1 in 1995 and had throughout his life was congestive 2 heart failure. 3 the only cardiologist you heard from was 4 today, dr. yount. that is it. the only one. there 5 are seven other cardiologists who looked at the 6 echocardiograms. with the exception of a minor 7 thing here on a percentage of ejection fraction, dr. 8 yount agreed with all of mr. buonomo's 9 cardiologists. 10 plaintiff never called a cardiologist to 11 dispute what dr. yount was going to say. no one to 12 discuss the symptoms of congestive heart failure. 13 no one to discuss the fact that he had left-sided 14 congestive heart failure, no one to interpret the 15 echocardiograms. 16 i want to go quickly and look at some of 17 the records. dr. bolton testified to his medical 18 record from early on may of 1995. he says when this 19 patient comes to him in the hospital, i cannot rule 20 out the possibility of heart failure. from day one, 21 this condition was possibly due to heart failure and 22 his doctors knew it. 23 there are a number of reasons that 24 demonstrate why he had congestive heart failure. i 25 want to go over those quickly. the symptoms were 1 consistent. the onset was consistent, 2 echocardiograms were consistent, reduced ejection 3 fraction, the subsequent history, and the bmp 4 levels. 5 about the symptoms, dr. bolton told you a 6 productive cough is a symptom. dr. bolton told you 7 peripheral edema, swelling, symptom of congestive 8 heart failure. dr. feinstein told you bilateral 9 effusions and confusion are symptoms. you know from 10 the doctors, the testimony you heard, and the 11 medical records that mr. buonomo suffered from these 12 symptoms. 13 we heard about the onset of his disease 14 because dr. yount testified -- he is a cardiologist, 15 i'm not. i cannot explain it the way he did. but he 16 talked about the onset of mr. buonomo's disease in 17 1995 and how that severe respiratory failure is 18 consistent with congestive heart failure. 19 we showed you the echocardiogram from dr. 20 borshuk may 15th, 1995. the cardiologist agrees. 21 he said impression, dilated left ventricle and left 22 atrium with diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis, 23 and moderate reduction ejection fraction to 24 38 percent. 25 dr. yount just explained to you this is 1 classic leftsided congestive heart failure. dr. 2 issa agreed that mr. buonomo's heart problems of 3 1995 were leftsided, not rightsided, not cor 4 pulmonale. 5 dr. issa's testimony. 6 as is reflected in the records from 1995, 7 heart problems were leftsided, not rightsided. 8 leftsided? 9 yes, sir. 10 we learned that congestive heart failure 11 can describe all of mr. buonomo's respiratory 12 problems. dr. yount explained that. dr. bolton 13 talked about patients with leftsided heart failure. 14 what did he say about that? 15 the ejection fraction that was reported 16 leftsided ventricular defect. you agreed with 17 patients with leftsided heart failure are short of 18 breath? yes. and depending on the severity of that 19 leftsided heart failure, they can be in respiratory 20 failure? correct. 21 that is what happened to mr. buonomo in 22 may of 1995. the evidence you heard demonstrates he 23 had congestive heart failure in 1995. the symptoms, 24 the onset, the echocardiograms, everything 25 consistent with congestive heart failure. this is 1 evidence of leftsided heart failure in may of '95, 2 not evidence, not proof of copd. 3 you also learned that leftsided congestive 4 heart failure can be caused by hypertension, sleep 5 apnea, obesity was mentioned by dr. yount. and you 6 know mr. buonomo had hypertension. that was the 7 first thing that dr. berndt gave him medication for. 8 he underwent a sleep study. maybe he had sleep 9 apnea, maybe he did not, but he wore a machine for 10 it. neither of these are caused by smoking. heart 11 failure is not caused by smoking. 12 mr. buonomo's history after 1995 provide 13 further proof that he had congestive heart failure. 14 i said in opening that i thought the evidence was 15 going to be that he did not see a doctor from 16 december of 1995 until march of 1999. the plaintiff 17 showed us an indication of medications where he got 18 a prescription or was getting medication in 1998. i 19 will agree, i did not see that before. he did not see 20 a doctor from 1995 until sometime in 1998. 21 they can talk about missing charts or 22 records not being complete. they can say that he 23 saw doctors and we just do not have a progress note 24 from it. but this case is about proof. saying 25 something is not there, something might have been 1 there, something might be missing, is not proof. 2 if we look in the record, when you string 3 things together, you can tell mr. buonomo was not 4 getting chest x-rays all the time between 1995 and 5 1999. remember we had the october of '95 x-ray, the 6 november of '95 x-ray, and the march of '95 x-ray. 7 let us look at those quickly. 8 october of 1995 x-ray. november of 1995, 9 from the same diagnostic folks, it compares to the 10 previous chest x-ray which was the month before. in 11 1999, the next x-ray we have, the next x-ray of 12 approval the comparison study is way back to 13 november 29, 1995. 14 were there other x-rays in there? i do not 15 know. there is no evidence of them. we have not 16 seen them. we did not have a chance to look at them 17 if they exist. that is no record from looking at 18 these records that that was the case. dr. klotz 19 walked you through a number of medical records that 20 talked about the condition mr. buonomo was in. 21 dr. yount talked today about out how 22 congestive heart failure can compensate and 23 decompensate. copd is supposed to be chronic, 24 permanent. we looked at a number of records from 25 1999 to 2000. i think you got tired me going 1 through them and i think dr. klotz was tired of me 2 asking about them. all of these times where there 3 are no complaints and the lungs are clear, the 4 plaintiffs may argue mr. buonomo just was not a 5 complainer, he did not go in and tell his doctors he 6 was having any problems. but the doctors do their 7 own assessment of him and their own assessment said 8 the lungs are clear. 9 clear lungs with no complaints are not 10 proof of copd. the same pattern continued with dr. 11 silver, 2002, 2003. we went through these. these 12 are in evidence. you can look at them. no 13 respiratory distress. breath sounds normal. this 14 is not me saying he was having normal breath sounds 15 in 2002, 2003. these are the treating physician. 16 the folks who put a stethoscope up to his chest and 17 listen. normal breath sounds are his only chronic 18 condition here. 19 we heard in 2004 he had a decompensation 20 from congestive heart failure and he was back in the 21 hospital. we also heard he was receiving digoxin 22 and lasix from 1995 that was supposed to treat and 23 help compensate the congestive heart failure. 24 but he was not always getting the right 25 amount of digoxin, and we have a composite of these 1 records that showed the digoxin levels below the 2 therapeutic level. one of the doctors on video was 3 saying it is only one tenth below, it is only two 4 tenths below. this is a pretty small rating. it is 5 supposed to be .9 to 2.0. it is a pretty concise 6 measurement. all of those are below it. 7 in 2004, mr. buonomo goes to the hospital 8 and gets treatment. his condition improves. dr. 9 yount told him he was able to go home. again, just 10 like 1995. this is how congestive heart failure 11 works. it is not how copd works. 12 we get to 2007. he has another bout of 13 respiratory problems. he undergoes another 14 echocardiogram. we showed it to you this morning. 15 left ventricular hypokinesis, reduction in ejection 16 fracture 35 to forty percent. dr. yount told you this 17 is leftsided heart failure. dr. issa agreed. 18 let us look at what he said. 19 "question: we went through all the 20 findings of that ct and at the bottom, those are all 21 findings consistent with leftsided heart failure; 22 correct? 23 "answer: correct. 24 you did not hear from any cardiologist who 25 disagree with dr. yount. there is no question mr. 1 buonomo had congestive heart failure. dr. issa put 2 him in a congestive heart disease management 3 program. this is the same time mrs. buonomo 4 testified no doctor told her that her husband had 5 congestive heart failure, when he was in a program 6 for it. 7 dr. yount testified when doctors record 8 congestive heart failure in a record, cardiologists 9 refer to it as leftsided congestive heart failure. 10 that is what he learned when he was becoming a 11 cardiologist. that is what they told him when he 12 was a fellow. that is what he does when he teaches 13 people at lsu. that is the way cardiologists refer 14 to heart failure. 15 dr. issa said yes, i have all of these 16 statements in my records of congestive heart 17 failure, but they were not leftsided, they were all 18 rightsided. dr. yount is a cardiologist. dr. issa 19 is not. 20 none of the seven cardiologists who looked 21 at mr. buonomo's echocardiograms from 1995 to his 22 last one said he has rightsided congestive heart 23 failure or cor pulmonale. that is what the 24 cardiologists said. 25 but there is even further proof of 1 congestive heart failure. we talked a lot about 2 bmp. we saw the bmp values throughout this case. 3 let us look at the bar graph. normal goes up to 861. 4 other diseases can cause an elevation. copd, as mr. 5 mcpharlin elicited on cross, copd can cause an 6 elevation, but dr. yount said it might take it up to 7 a thousand, 1200. 8 look at mr. bounomo's values. we even 9 heard there were other ones that were 10,000. no 10 other disease other than leftsided heart failure can 11 cause bmp values like this. 12 i am going show you a little bit of 13 testimony about mr. buonomo's final illness. 14 november of 2008 he is back in the hospital. chest 15 x-ray is taken. the radiologist there is dr. 16 rosendorf. dr. rosendorf said followup respiratory 17 failure, congestive heart failure. that is what the 18 radiologist said. dr. issa agreed that on that 19 study. dr. rosendorf did not describe anything 20 consistent with copd. see at the bottom? he 21 does not describe any emphysematous changes; right? 22 he does not use the term copd to describe what he 23 sees on the film. correct. that is what dr. issa, 24 their expert, is saying about dr. rosendorf. that 25 is not something dr. dautenhahn is saying. that is 1 what their experts are saying. 2 another radiologist two days later, dr. 3 klotz had a similar observation. no copd. x-rays 4 on the 29th and 30th reveal bilateral pleural 5 effusions consolidation, interstitial lung disease 6 suggestive of congestive heart failure, and on the 7 next day the same thing. 8 december 8th chest x-ray read by another 9 radiologist dr. joseph. no description of -- what 10 does dr. bolton say about it? he did not describe 11 blebs, bullae, or he did not describe emphysema, he 12 did not describe hyperinflation, and he did not 13 diagnose mr. buonomo with copd. 14 based upon all of that, dr. issa reaches 15 this conclusion. most of the chest x-rays looked 16 like congestive heart failure. 17 dr. feinstein admits the same thing about 18 dr. palacia from a december 9th x-ray. dr. goldberg 19 x-rays on december 10th. they go on and on. if you 20 talk about disagreeing with the treating physicians, 21 disagreeing with what doctors have to say, what were 22 dr. rosendorf, dr. klotz, dr. joseph, dr. palacia, 23 dr. goldberg. at the end of his life, congestive 24 heart failure. none. copd. based on elevated bmp 25 level, the chest x-rays, the ct scans, the symptoms, 1889 1 the echocardiogram, and mr. buonomo's history, the 2 evidence is mr. buonomo died as a result of 3 exacerbation of congestive heart failure, not copd. 4 even dr. bolton admits he cannot rule out congestive 5 heart failure as the cause of mr. buonomo's death. 6 now, plaintiff pointed quite a bit to dr. 7 feinstein, the doctor who filled out the death 8 certificate. dr. feinstein agrees with all of these 9 records. fist of all, he did not look at any records 10 before october of 2007 i think. he did not go back 11 more than a year to look at records. he determined 12 the cause of death. 13 but one of things dr. feinstein was asked, 14 and he testified to this in front of you by 15 videotape, would you refer to a board-certified 16 cardiologist who said that mr. buonomo's death was 17 due to congestive heart failure, yes. so the 18 cardiologist weighing in his opinion on this would 19 defer to his judgment. he said yes. 20 that cardiologist, the only cardiologist 21 you heard from in this case, is dr. yount. i do not 22 know if one of the seven other cardiologists who had 23 the same thing down in their echocardiograms would 24 have agreed. 25 what caused mr. buonomo's death in 2008 is 1 what caused him to be hospitalized in 1995, 2 congestive heart failure. so when you demand proof 3 on this medical issue, this is the proof we have. 4 there was never a pft. the radiology was consistent 5 with congestive heart failure. there was no chronic 6 symptoms before 1995. there was never any lung 7 pathology of emphysema. there was no biopsy or 8 autopsy taken. 9 mr. buonomo had congestive heart failure 10 in 1995 and thereafter. his congestive heart 11 failure can and does explain his respiratory 12 problems. his echocardiograms consistently show 13 leftsided heart failure, both diastolic and 14 systolic, and his bmp values demonstrate leftsided 15 heart failure. 16 when you consider this, there is no way 17 that the greater weight of the evidence supports 18 copd. in fact, it is just the opposite. 19 you had a look at the verdict form before. 20 i want to put it up and talk to you a little bit 21 about it. two questions. the first one did matthew 22 buonomo have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 23 before november 21, 1996. second, was matthew 24 buonomo addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine 25 and, if so, was such addition a legal cause of the 1 copd. 2 if you decide the answer to either one of 3 those questions is no, we go home. there is no 4 phase two like plaintiff's counsel talked about. 5 that ends this case. so this can be the last time i 6 have the opportunity to address you. if you say the 7 answer to either one of these questions is no, that 8 ends the case. 9 while i have enjoyed being before you and 10 i have enjoyed trying the case, i think the evidence 11 mandates this should and will be the last time i 12 appear before you because the question, did matthew 13 buonomo have copd before november 21, 1996, the 14 greater weight of the evidence, the proof in this 15 case is that he did not. the answer to that 16 question is no. 17 we talked in voir dire. and you all 18 agreed if the evidence warranted it you would be 19 able to return a verdict for my client, r.j. 20 reynolds. you said you would sit there. you said 21 nobody would hold anything against experts called to 22 testify on behalf of r.j. reynolds. you said if the 23 evidence warranted a verdict in r.j. reynolds's 24 behalf, all of you could check no to that question. 25 ladies and gentlemen, the evidence warrants checking 1 no. 2 i thank you again for your attention. i 3 thank you for your patience. i thank you for your 4 service. 5 thank you.
