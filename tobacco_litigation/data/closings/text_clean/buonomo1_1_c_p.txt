24 mr. uustal: thank you, your honor. 25 good afternoon. 1 we have tried, tried, not to waste a 2 single moment of your time. so let us go directly to 3 the questions that you are going to have to answer 4 on the verdict form in this case. 5 the issue, as you heard in opening 6 statement, is did matthew buonomo have an illness 7 before november of 1996 that was caused by an 8 addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine. so if 9 the answer to that question is yes, then the answer 10 to both of these questions are yes. 11 did matthew buonomo have chronic 12 obstructive pulmonary disease before february 21st, 13 1996, and secondly, was he addicted to cigarettes 14 containing nicotine which caused that illness. 15 if you answer no to either question, your 16 verdict is for rjr. if you answer yes and yes, you 17 are finding that mr. bounomo is part of a certain 18 group of people and you will move on to phase two of 19 this trial. 20 in order to answer those questions, the 21 judge is going to instruct you on the law. and, by 22 the way, that verdict form, you will have it in 23 writing to fill out. the judge is also going to 24 give you the law that you need to follow in 25 answering those questions, and that will be in 1 writing. but there are a couple things about the 2 law i want to discuss with you because you need to 3 know what they are when you are deciding how to 4 answer these questions. 5 the first thing is a concept we touched on 6 a couple times in this trial already, right at the 7 top, something called the greater weight of the 8 evidence. 9 the greater weight of the evidence means 10 the more persuasive and convincing force and effect 11 of the entire evidence in the case. 12 it is important on every issue that you 13 are deciding that you apply the correct standard and 14 follow the law for this kind of case. in other 15 cases, there are some cases where -- criminal cases 16 where the defendant starts out -- i hope this would 17 work because we just put this together. but the 18 defendant starts out presumed innocent, and the 19 prosecution has the burden of presenting so much 20 evidence that the scales not only tip in the other 21 direction but there is no longer any doubt, any 22 reasonable doubt about the guilt of the defendant. 23 in cases like this, the scales start out 24 even. if they end even, we lose. we have the 25 burden of proving our case. so if they start even 1 and end even, we lose. but if they tip, the greater 2 weight tips slightly in our direction on any issue, 3 then that issue must be decided in our favor. 4 i think, and i'm going to discuss with you 5 now why i think we have proven this case far beyond 6 that. but every issue that you come across, the 7 first question you need to ask yourself and remind 8 yourselves about is when we say decide something, 9 what is the standard, who is more likely right than 10 wrong. are we more likely right than wrong. 11 you have heard, and mr. mcpharlin, right 12 in opening statement, said there is basically two 13 possible answers to the questions. either he had 14 emphysema and copd -- and we are going to get -- we 15 will talk a little bit to make sure it is absolutely 16 clear that emphysema is a disease that is copd. 17 there are other diseases that are also copd. but 18 emphysema is copd. and he had it caused by an 19 addiction to cigarettes which is what all his 20 treating doctors said. all those doctors and all 21 those medical records, there was not one that 22 disagreed with that. and that requires yes, yes. 23 the other possibility which rjr argues is 24 true is that he was not addicted, never addicted, 25 not a day in his life, and he never had copd, and he 1 never had emphysema. 2 i almost had the guts to just put in the 3 medical records and rest our case because the very 4 fact -- and i did not so you are here longer. but 5 the very fact that he was treated for 13 years by 21 6 doctors who diagnosed and treated copd, emphysema, 7 is way more than a slight tip. it is very, very 8 strong evidence in and of itself. if they are going 9 to overcome that, they are going to need to present 10 some very, very compelling evidence to explain to 11 you how, right here in our community, 21 doctors 12 treated a man for 13 years for the wrong disease. 13 so what evidence do they have? they 14 brought you four witnesses who are medical doctors. 15 when you look at each of the things they testified 16 to, there is another jury instruction including 17 consider the believability of the witness. there 18 are factors for you to consider. when you look at 19 their testimony, it is appropriate to consider that 20 unlike the treating doctors who made these diagnoses 21 without any lawsuit in mind, they were hired by one 22 of the parties in this case. in addition, they were 23 paid an incredible amount of money to come to those 24 conclusions. some of them said they hope to have 25 more cases. they all have apparently the same 15 or 1 20 cases already. they are making a lot in each 2 case, and they have an incentive to continue making 3 that much money. 4 so anything they say has a little less 5 credibility, and maybe a lot less than somebody who 6 wrote it in a medical record without any view of a 7 lawsuit and who testified to it through days and 8 days -- i mean those videos seemed long to sit 9 through, but they were a tiny, tiny portion of what 10 those doctors had to sit through, questioning and 11 questioning and questioning, multiple occasions, 12 multiple days. and that was not even all the doctors 13 who had to go through that. they said those things 14 as doctors who do not testify in lawsuits. several 15 of them said i have never before. and some of the 16 witnesses here said well, this is my first time in a 17 courtroom, but they have testified many times at 18 depositions. these doctors were strangers to this 19 courtroom, this process. 20 it struck me. dr. cummings said something 21 on cross examination. they were asking him about 22 how he had said something to some of the other 23 people who are concerned about the diseases caused 24 by smoking in our society, that you have to think 25 before you talk to the press. if you are a doctor, 1 used to dealing with regular people in regular 2 situations, it might not come across the way you 3 expect in a 30-second sound bite on television. 4 those people like dr. cummings, concerned with 5 public health, for years and years and years were 6 getting drowned out by professionals who knew how to 7 talk on television. 8 and the danger is when you consider the 9 weight to give any witness, any witness' testimony 10 in this case, the danger is that somebody who is 11 good at talking does not mean they are good at 12 medicine -- who has been picked because they are 13 good at testifying. we did not pick any of those 14 treating doctors. they were all the doctors who 15 came in and treated him. not our experts. they are 16 his doctors. but the ones that have been picked 17 because of how they appear, just like the doctors 18 and the pr people who for years and years said, like 19 one doctor today, we do not know what causes lung 20 cancer, and they said it well enough that it drowned 21 out the truth. 22 so you can consider that when you give the 23 weight, when you decide the weight to give any 24 testimony. that is why it seems to me we are not 25 even close to who is slightly right. but on each of 1 the questions, you have to look at this is not a 2 close call. 3 let me take you through the individual 4 issues that are involved in this question. whether 5 you look at it as one decision, did he have a 6 disease caused by an addiction to cigarettes, or you 7 look at it as two like the verdict form does, there 8 are several parts. the first one was, was he 9 addicted. 10 you heard from his treating doctors that 11 he was. it is obvious. it is an addictive drug. 12 he tried to quit and he could not. 13 they can come in here and say that he 14 was not, and they can hire someone to say that he 15 was not addicted, but you can use your common sense. 16 in fact, you have to use your common sense. 17 and you know essentially what addiction 18 means. by any definition, any possible way to 19 define it, like one of his daughter's defined it, 20 when we were running low on cigarette, i saw him 21 take the butts almost spent out of the ashtray and 22 try to straighten them out and smoke them. that is 23 a definition of addiction. that is him. he was 24 addicted. or if he used the fagerstrom test or the 25 heaviness of smoking or even the dsm their guy used, 1 there is no doubt. it is not even close. 2 dr. cummings is one of the world leading 3 experts on tobacco addiction. todd asked him 4 someone who smokes three packs per day -- he did not 5 need to get to all of this information if you 6 remember. 7 but let us look at mr. bounomo. the amount 8 of cigarettes he smoked, when he smoked in the 9 morning, when he smoked at night, whether he had 10 daily use, symptoms he had when he tried to quit, 11 the fact he did try and quit and failed, the age he 12 started, the length of time he smoked, is that 13 person addicted he was asked? yes, there is no 14 doubt. 15 and he trains the people who determine for 16 the state of new york on the quit line if someone is 17 addicted. if somebody said this person was not 18 addicted, what would happen to them? it is 19 ridiculous. 20 if you want to use a technical definition, 21 and remember dr. marks said i do not know, dr. marks 22 was the psychiatrist they brought in to say this 23 individual was not addicted. he said i do not know 24 if you can use these other definitions of addiction, 25 the fagerstrom test, heaviness of smoking index 1 which was just two questions, ones used all the time 2 by doctors. he said i do not know if it has been 3 validated. i asked him what he meant by that. he 4 said you have to do a study to follow people and see 5 if the people that show that they are addicted under 6 this test really are. but you already heard from 7 dr. cummings that is exactly what they did. 8 whether dr. marks knows it or not, it was 9 a long study over many years, all types of people 10 from very limited non-daily use to very heavy 11 smokers, and this was the highest predictor as he 12 called it, the highest correlation to whether 13 somebody would have difficulty quitting because they 14 were addicted. 15 if you remember, when we scored it with 16 dr. marks, their expert, under this test, he said at 17 the very least it is high dependence, and it is 18 quite possibly very high dependence which is how it 19 was when i scored it with his wife. with his wife 20 it was at least eight and possibly ten. with dr. 21 marks it was at least seven and possibly ten. but 22 any score over seven, your level of dependence is 23 high, you are not in control of your smoking. 24 by the way, we are not saying -- this 25 really is not an issue for this phase because you are 1 going to decide how much fault matthew buonomo had 2 in the next phase. but i want to make it clear 3 because this has been raised a lot. we are not 4 saying if you are addicted you do not have free 5 choice. but there is a physical addiction that 6 results in what is called diminished free choice, a 7 powerful physical resistance to acting on your free 8 choice. does not mean you cannot quit. we never said 9 that. but with smoking this high, your levels of 10 dependence this high, you are not in control of your 11 smoking. 12 one other thing that dr. marks said and i 13 expect it will come up in closing when the rjr 14 lawyers talk. on this test, even a zero shows 15 dependence. even a zero is addiction. i said do 16 you know why, doctor? do you know why a zero shows 17 very low. very low obviously but, why it still 18 shows some dependence. no. he asked me why. but i 19 was not allowed to answer a witness. but i'll tell 20 you. 21 this is a test for daily smokers as dr. 22 cummings told you. daily smokers by definition, in 23 fact the definition that dr. marks admitted to, that 24 rjr's expert admitted to, daily smokers have some 25 level of addiction because as dr. marks said in the 1 courtroom, do you agree that cigarette smoking is an 2 addictive and chronic relapsing disorder. yes. he 3 had to answer yes to that because that is the 4 definition. it is an addictive and chronic 5 relapsing disorder, cigarette smoking. if you are a 6 daily smoker, that correlates to some level of 7 addiction. if you smoke every day. it can be very 8 low. as you saw, zero is very low dependence. but 9 once you have a daily smoker by definition, by the 10 definition dr. marks admitted to, you have some 11 level of addiction. 12 by their own expert's admission, he scores 13 on that test addicted, and very, very highly 14 addicted. i'll briefly remind you when they say he 15 did not really want to quit and made no serious 16 attempts to quit, he first tried cutting down. when 17 that did not work he tried to quit cold turkey by 18 eliminating cigarettes. this was in the mid-'70s. 19 he tried different things with different quit 20 attempts. sometimes chewing gum. he thought that 21 would work. 22 to us a lot of things about this case 23 sound strange. but you have to remember not only 24 was it a different time, but the things we know to 25 be true like the air we breath, they really did not 1 know. in fact, i was shocked to find out when i was 2 questioning connie, i asked her did you know that it 3 was proven in the '70s that smoking was harmful, and 4 she said no, it was not. she did not say no, i did not 5 know. she said no, it was not proven then. we will 6 get to in a minute why people thought that. 7 but the steps they took to try to quit 8 were based on what they knew. they did not know all 9 the things we know right now before we ever came 10 into this courtroom, and certainly after what we 11 heard. and connie even said that, i wish we had, i 12 did not understand why matt was acting like that 13 until i watched dr. henningfield on that video. 14 to the point where when they were 15 discussing quitting, he actually pounded on the 16 table his fists and he said you do not know what i'm 17 going through. and she did not. 18 this is not possible, rjr's answers. tried 19 chewing gum. substituting smoking with candy and 20 peanuts. i remember my grandparents doing it. 21 water filter was a smoking aid, a cease smoking aid 22 for the time. it seemed technologically advanced 23 back then. you put a filter on it and you were 24 supposed to get less nicotine and you can wean 25 yourself off. he tried that. did not work. 1 throwing away the cigarettes. we heard from his 2 granddaughter all things the family would try to do, 3 word games, to take his mind off it. they actually 4 played this word search game. she would come over 5 especially to keep his mind off smoking when he was 6 trying to quit. 7 why was matthew buonomo more addicted than 8 other smokers? for example, dr. marks who told you 9 he picked up a cigarette at 12 or 13, coughed, hated 10 it and never smoked again. why was he different? 11 well, we do not know entirely why. we just know he 12 was more addicted. but we do know some of the 13 factors. 14 there are certain factors that will result 15 in a lower level of addiction. one of the most 16 important is the age you start smoking a lot. 17 when your brain is still developing, 18 remember nicotine actually physically changes your 19 brain. if those changes occur when you are 13, 14, 20 15 years old it is much harder to quit. shorter 21 duration, some people when they wake up, and we 22 do not know why yet, reach for the cigarette. there 23 is a biological, physical urge for the cigarette 24 when they wake up. some people, they do not. they 25 do not have that physical urge that makes them think 1 of a cigarette. some person may be all the way on 2 the left side, very low. but if you are like matt, 3 starting younger, heavier smoker, longer duration, 4 smoking very early in the morning, those are the 5 factors that result in his powerful addiction. 6 i'm going to stop talking about addiction. 7 if he is not addicted, nobody is. 8 let us talk about did he have copd. you 9 have the entire medical record. that still exists. 10 there were some things -- both parties have subpoena 11 power to go out and get records, and we did from 12 every hospital and doctor. but some doctors said we 13 do not have them anymore or they said this is what we 14 have. like you heard broward general did not have 15 that sleep study. 16 but everything we have is here. the 17 defense and the plaintiffs have also marked certain 18 things separately so it will make it easier for you 19 to look at some of the things that were shown during 20 trial. but you are free to look through everything 21 in here. i just wanted to give you a flavor of what 22 those records looked like because if you read them, 23 you know he had copd. 24 doctor after doctor -- i have been using 25 the 21 doctors. but that is just doctors who 1 diagnosed or treated him for copd. there are other 2 doctors involved with ruling out the congestive 3 heart failure as a serious problem. and by the way, 4 he did have congestive heart failure. there is no 5 doubt he was diagnosed with it. we will talk about 6 whether that was a cause of his death in a minute. 7 you will notice whether it was a cause of 8 his death is not one of the questions on the verdict 9 form. that is for phase two. the only issue is 10 whether he even had copd, not what killed him in 11 2008, but whether in 1995 when he went to the 12 hospital he had copd. 13 i did a very bad job of explaining 14 something to you with the witnesses although they 15 said it, but i kept trying to cut our part of those 16 videos down, down, down, down. then we started 17 talking about terms immediately, and some of the 18 other doctors came in, and i think it was clear. 19 but dr. klotz admitted this. the treating 20 doctors all testified to this. copd which means 21 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, it means 22 you have got something in your lungs, continually, 23 chronically, obstructing in your lungs, the normal 24 function, so it makes it difficult to breathe. 25 that could happen in different ways. you 1 can have copd from different physical causes. one 2 of those is emphysema. if you have emphysema you 3 have copd. if you have chronic bronchitis you have 4 copd. if you have both you have copd. that is why 5 dr. klotz, their expert, said copd is an umbrella 6 disease that includes emphysema, chronic bronchitis, 7 or both. some patients have both. some have 8 emphysema. a lot of the doctors, the treating 9 doctors, use it interchangeably with copd. 10 dr. kelly adams who we did not hear from, 11 every one of these doctors was available for the 12 defense to talk to. and many of them who you did not 13 hear from, they were talked to. they were deposed. 14 you did not hear anything from any treater that 15 disagrees with any of these. 16 if you go through any of the medical 17 records you will see again and again from doctor after 18 doctor the diagnosis of copd, probable copd, 19 exacerbation of copd, emphysema. in fact, look on 20 may 13th, 1995. dr. bolton, a pulmonologist, a 21 specialist in lung function, copd, chronic 22 obstructive lung disease. he called it lung instead 23 of pulmonary, chronic obstructive lung disease with 24 emphysematous copd and probable chronic bronchitis. 25 but he is not necessarily diagnosing that. 1 severe lung disease is written in the 2 records and you heard it from the treaters. severe. 3 show us 72 for a minute. a different summary. it 4 shows how the different treatments they were doing 5 were affecting his oxygen saturation. again, doctor 6 after doctor, how the treatments are affecting and 7 how they are going to change the treatments. 8 ks73. they go on and on like that. s4. 9 just a list of some of the doctors. this is not even 10 complete in the different specialties who treated 11 and diagnosed the copd. he was seen by seven 12 cardiologists, seven cardiologists. pulmonologists. 13 internists. radiologists. hospitalists. and you 14 did not and will not ever hear one of them say that 15 he never had copd, never had emphysema, he was not 16 addicted, that he died of congestive heart failure, 17 none. 18 doctors that flew in from other parts of 19 the country to say that. in fact, let us be clear 20 about one thing. of all the experts who came in 21 here for the defense, only one of them said he 22 did not have copd. all the others if you notice 23 did not say that. i have no opinion on whether he 24 had copd. 25 only one, dr. klotz, said he did not have 1 copd, he had emphysema. well, he had bullae 2 emphysema. we went through that three times. and i 3 still do not know. hopefully you do. because i 4 still do not know what he was saying. he said he 5 did not have emphysema. so i said okay, he did not 6 have emphysema. then i said once i wrote it, he 7 does not have emphysema, he did not like it written 8 down like that. he said i did not say that. i went 9 and crossed out the not. he said it was small 10 bullae emphysema. and he said in his opinion it was 11 october 1995 according to the chart. because the 12 x-ray that says bullae, that finds the bullae 13 changes in the lungs which is emphysema -- 14 emphysematous destruction in the lungs and they see 15 it on the x-ray -- was october 1995. so there is no 16 doubt about the date either. even the radiologist 17 said emphysematous changes, which he finally 18 admitted means of or related to emphysema, in every 19 ct scan he ever saw but he would not give a date when 20 he first got emphysema. dr. klotz did. this is 21 their expert because obviously all the treaters 22 agree. and there is only one doctor you heard from 23 who said you cannot diagnose copd without a pulmonary 24 function test. that was dr. klotz. but remember, 25 after i wrote this all out, his opinions in the 1 case, it turns out he said the exact opposite a 2 short time ago. the exact opposite. 3 you do not need a pulmonary function test. 4 i mean you can see the emphysema on the x-ray. 5 people were getting emphysema before there were any 6 pulmonary function tests. people were getting copd 7 before there were any pulmonary function tests. one 8 of you asked him what would you do if somebody came 9 with these symptoms which clinically all those 10 doctors could see, i know what this is, it is copd. 11 what would you do? i give him a pulmonary function 12 test. why? because he has copd. he said then i 13 would diagnose it. 14 it is the same thing they said year after 15 year. we need more proof, not enough tests. we 16 do not know if smoking is bad for you. we do not know 17 if it is addictive. it is not proven. now they are 18 saying they need one more test. 19 i have a bunch of medical records. but 20 let me play you -- can we have the video clip bolton 21 243? 22 "question: is there any questions in your 23 mind matthew buonomo had emphysema? 24 "answer: no question in my mind. 25 "question: any question in your mind 1 matthew buonomo's death was caused by emphysema? 2 "answer: there is no question that the 3 patient died from emphysema. 4 feinstein 108: 5 "question: did matthew bounomo die from 6 emphysema? 7 "answer: yes. 8 silver, 224: 9 "question: do you remember mr. bounomo? 10 "answer: i do. 11 "question: how would you describe his 12 emphysema? 13 "answer: he was severe. 14 issa 36: 15 "question: how was emphysema diagnosed in 16 mr. bounomo's case? 17 "answer: his copd was diagnosed through 18 x-rays. 19 "question: do you believe that x-rays are 20 a sufficient or adequate way to diagnose emphysema 21 or copd? 22 "answer: better than the pulmonary 23 function test. yes. i believe so. 24 was copd caused by his addiction? really 25 that is kind of the other part of this. i want to 1834 1 show you one of the jury instructions on that. 2 when we are talking about whether the 3 addiction caused copd, there is a legal definition 4 of what that means, cause. remember you are going 5 to have these back there. but remember there are 6 two important parts of this deposition. 7 first of all, an addiction is a legal 8 cause of an injury if it directly and in the natural 9 and continuous sequence produces or contributes 10 substantially to producing such injury so that it 11 can reasonably be said that but for the addiction to 12 cigarettes containing nicotine the injury would not 13 have occurred. but for the addiction, no injury. 14 if he was not addicted, he would not have gotten the 15 disease. that is what cause means. if he was 16 addicted, he gets the disease. if he is not 17 addicted, he does not. 18 it is important to remember the second 19 paragraph because it is a cause. you see, there can 20 be a lot of causes that if you take one out it 21 does not happen. car accident. somebody runs a red 22 light and hits somebody. that other person did not 23 do anything wrong. but if they had not gotten in 24 their car that morning there would not have been an 25 accident. that is also a bolton cause. there can 1 be several things if you take them away you do not 2 have the outcome. 3 in this case you got addiction. you take 4 it away there is no copd. and we are going to get 5 briefly into how addiction drives disease. they are 6 going to say failure to quit. does not matter. that 7 is not your issue whether he failed to quit. fault 8 is for phase two. how cigarettes are designed. the 9 choices rjr made. there are a lot of reasons that 10 resulted in this disease, a lot of causes. 11 but if the addiction contributed 12 substantially, and if you take it away, you would not 13 have gotten the disease, then it is the cause. if 14 he was not addicted, he would not have been smoking 15 that many cigarettes and he would not have gotten the 16 disease. so the second paragraph specifically says 17 addiction need not be the only cause. 18 your honor, can i take an additional ten 19 minutes out of rebuttal? 20 the court: yes. i did not know why you 21 did not reserve more to begin with. 22 mr. uustal: i thought i was more concise 23 than i am. 24 sorry. it does not add any total time to 25 what you have to sit through. 1 so the only issue on this is would he have 2 gotten sick if he was not addicted. 3 first of all, does smoking cause copd. 4 and obviously it does. there was no witness who 5 denied that. in fact, i think even dr. klotz 6 admitted that. yes. 7 cigarette smoke does not cause emphysema. 8 actually he took this back. he said this at first. 9 cigarette smoke does not cause emphysema in every 10 case. it causes emphysema in 99 percent of cases, 11 actually about 99-and-a-half percent. but he took 12 that back. and he said -- talking about matthew 13 buonomo now specifically, an expert for the defense. 14 more likely than not, the bullae emphysema you found 15 was caused by his addiction to smoking cigarettes. 16 the lawyers have met with him like he told 17 you for many, many hours, so he was careful to say 18 -- i'm not saying the addiction caused it but it was 19 caused by his smoking cigarettes. so all the 20 treating doctors and their own expert admits it was 21 caused by smoking. 22 it is so strongly linked that dr. klotz 23 initially said 99.5 percent of the cases. it is so 24 strongly linked that dr. marks, their guy who came 25 in who used this book, the dsm, to say he was not 1 addicted had to admit that the dsm said a symptom of 2 nicotine addiction is copd. that is how strong the 3 language is. if you see someone with copd, you can 4 consider that a sign of nicotine addiction, because 5 the addiction drives the smoking, the amount of 6 smoking that is needed to cause the damage in the 7 lungs that results in copd. someone not addicted 8 does not smoke as much. that is not enough smoking 9 to cause the copd. the addiction drives the 10 exposure to the things in the cigarettes. 11 he switched to filters. remember when 12 people started talking about cigarettes might be 13 bad? he switched to filters to be safe. we know 14 now those filters do not filter out the carcinogens 15 and the other bad substances. and once you get a 16 sufficient level of exposure, you will develop the 17 damage to the lung, and if you are not addicted you 18 just do not smoke enough to get that exposure. 19 dr. cummings talked about why it is hard 20 to quit. this is how the addiction drives the 21 smoking. it is hard to quit. the main factor is 22 how it is designed. cigarettes engineered that way. 23 precisely. 24 mr. geise: objection, your honor. 25 the court: overruled. 1 mr. uustal: this is testimony in this 2 case that this witness testified to. precisely, 3 yes, they are. and who is choice is that. that is 4 the cigarette company's, reynolds. if they chose 5 to, they could take the nicotine out. nicotine 6 addicts would not smoke because they are smoking to 7 get the nicotine. if they took the nicotine out, 8 kids who smoked could not get addicted. but it is 9 this addiction that drives the level of smoking. 10 if you look at the parts of the cigarette 11 that are designed to feed the addiction which 12 increases the exposure, you see the chemical -- dr. 13 cummings testified about this -- you see the 14 chemical compounds that are added. they added 15 flavorings to control the burn rate, to control 16 ventilation. 17 mr. geise: objection, your honor. phase 18 two. 19 the court: sustained. take that down. 20 take that down. thank you. 21 mr. uustal: the way the cigarette is 22 designed is to feed the addiction. this one this 23 morning i cut and pasted from the transcript so i 24 do not have it fancy. dr. cummings was explaining 25 how the addiction feeds the development of the 1 disease. it is directly related to the disease we 2 see from smoking. it is the people addicted who use 3 the product repeatedly. he is talking about what he 4 has seen in his studies. it is the people addicted 5 and use the product repeatedly usually at a high 6 level for many years that get the disease. social 7 smokers do not get the disease related to cigarette 8 smoking. heavy cigarette smokers are the ones that 9 get the cancer, the copd, the heart disease. it is 10 directly correlated. 11 he is an epidemiologist. that is what he 12 does. those are the people that first discovered 13 that cigarette smoking was harmful and the cigarette 14 companies said it is just epidemiology. they are 15 the ones who discovered it. from his 16 epidemiological study, he can tell -- that just 17 means looking at people, groups, over periods of 18 time and see what factors have what outcomes. heavy 19 addiction is the factor that causes copd. 20 this will give you a brief kind of 21 physical example of the different type of exposure 22 you get if you are addicted compared to a social 23 smoker. this is one or two packs a day compared to 24 a pack a month. you can see obviously that the 25 exposure to the toxins in nicotine is far, far, far 1 greater. so it is the addiction that drives the 2 disease. 3 i will be done in a few minutes. 4 they used to say cigarettes were not 5 addictive. now we hear cigarettes were not 6 addictive to matthew buonomo. it used to be we 7 do not know if cigarettes cause disease, we need more 8 tests. 9 mr. geise: objection, your honor. 10 the court: overruled. 11 mr. uustal: now we hear we do not know if 12 cigarettes caused disease for mr. bounomo, we need 13 more tests. same thing. but if he is not addicted 14 and his copd was not caused by smoking, then we are 15 right back to the old days, because if someone that 16 smokes like him is not addicted and someone with this 17 amount of medical records undisputed by every doctor 18 who treated him for 13 years did not get copd from 19 his addiction to smoking, then no one does. 20 i'm going to have a chance to talk to you 21 again after rjr is done. i promise you and so does 22 the judge i'm sure will make sure it will be much 23 shorter than this. we have a set amount of time but 24 i have split mine. 25 it has been a long road. i appreciate 1 some of the things in this case were not as exciting 2 as they could have been, especially the videos. 3 phase two, no videos, i promise. it will be much 4 shorter if you answer yes to both questions 5 regarding the phase two. it is shorter in total. 6 and there are no videos. 7 mr. geise: objection, your honor. 8 the court: overruled. 9 mr. uustal: that is the point where 10 you will assign fault to mr. bounomo for his choices, 11 and you will hear the evidence which you have not yet 12 heard about the fault of others. 13 mr. geise: objection, your honor. 14 the court: sustained. 15 we will take a stretch break until 2:35. 16 you are excused until 2:35. 17 (brief recess) 11 the court: mr. uustal. 12 mr. uustal: thank you, your honor. 13 proof. how many times did we just hear 14 that word? there is no proof. same thing we have 15 been hearing for 50 years. how many doctors did 16 they want us to bring in? would ten have been 17 enough? fifteen? this is proof. 18 i mean, i do not know what rjr means by the 19 word proof. but the evidence, evidence is any 20 witness. everything connie said is evidence. like 21 any other piece of evidence, you decide to accept it 22 or reject it. but what she said alone is evidence 23 that can tip the scales that start out even. 24 they spent days interrogating the treating 25 doctors in this case. they could have called in 1 anyone. if any doctor supported what they said, we 2 would have heard from them. this is all his 3 doctors. they did not want to come in here. it is 4 not fun. you heard it from dr. henningfield. it is 5 not fun to testify against rjr. think about all the 6 time away from their practices in those depositions. 7 it is not fun for them. but you heard from an rjr 8 doctor it is fun to testify for a tobacco company. 9 i felt during mr. geise's remarks that i 10 was running around -- not running around but moving 11 around trying to find things because i have to 12 defend every page in here. what do you think i 13 could do with $200,000 for doctors and untold 14 lawyers from all over the country picking over those 15 records to come up with something to argue about? 16 i'll show you some of the things. 17 this was just shown to you in rjr's 18 closing. this is the first ct report, the one done 19 to rule out lung cancer. we know why they would do 20 a ct scan to look for lung cancer in a patient who 21 has been smoking as long as he has. the radiologist 22 they brought in did not know. did not know that 23 smoking causes lung cancer. but we know. 24 they were looking for lung cancer. you 25 just heard this report says nothing about copd. but 1 it does underneath that blowup. the clinical 2 diagnosis was copd. the ct scan was to look for 3 lung cancer. and it says copd, but not in this 4 blowup. the very next one you were shown says, 5 well, dr. bolton agreed that ct scan did not show any 6 signs of emphysema and that the question was after 7 you read this you were asked you did not hear from 8 dr. bolton that he read that ct scan and it said 9 anything different. you did hear from dr. 10 dautenhahn, their radiologist, that agreed. but 11 guess what is missing? the film. dr. bolton 12 could not have looked at that film at the deposition 13 and agreed because he did not have it, and dr. 14 dautenhahn admitted that he did not have it. 15 somebody else we found, his daughter. his 16 personality, did it change when he quit smoking in 17 1995? that does not mean the day he quit smoking. i 18 think you all know that. 19 after a long exchange in a long deposition 20 she said once he quit smoking, he was the same 21 person, but not while he was going through 22 withdrawal. 23 you heard that when dr. issa said that 24 when you see chf in these medical records, it means 25 cor pulmonale rightsided heart failure caused by 1 copd. but he is not a cardiologist. and dr. yount 2 is. so dr. yount knows what it means when it says 3 congestive heart failure in these records. but 4 guess what? dr. issa wrote chf. he knew what it 5 means because he wrote it. then he was asked about 6 it, specifically that. 7 can you put up 160? 8 "question: show me in your record where 9 you used the word right ventricular strain? 10 "answer: we usually do not use that word. 11 we usually put it for simplicity, we call it 12 congestive heart failure. 13 "question: so would you agree then in 14 your medical record you never used the term right 15 ventricular strain? 16 "answer: i would say that it is 17 highly unlikely that i called it that because it is 18 obvious when i signed a note or sent it to another 19 medical -- somebody else in the medical field, 20 whether it is a cardiologist or a pulmonologist, 21 they understand looking at the records and looking 22 at what we write this is, that is what we are 23 writing. 24 so there are two points there. the first 25 one is he knows what he meant when he wrote 1 congestive heart failure, and it is an important 2 point that was left out that he wrote them. 3 but the second thing is you will hear from a 4 guy who has never testified before and has nothing 5 to do with lawsuits that when he writes chf, it is 6 obvious to the other doctors looking at this it is 7 rightsided heart failure. then you will hear from dr. 8 yount that it is obvious it means leftsided heart 9 failure. something is wrong. 10 mr. geise told you it was not exactly right 11 how i described the greater weight of the evidence. 12 that is why i showed it to you. so we would be 13 exactly right, this is no room for imprecision on 14 the burden. the greater weight of the evidence 15 means the more persuasive and convincing force and 16 effect of the entire evidence in the case. 17 the greater weight, the scale measures 18 weights. we start out even. and you look to which 19 side, after you weigh all the evidence, has the 20 greater weight, more than the other side. greater, 21 more than. and everything you heard from all the 22 defense people, it is all evidence, and you assign 23 whatever weight you want. but when you measure it, 24 it does not matter if it is high like this and there 25 is no doubt, or there is plenty of doubts, you look 1 to which story you heard, which answer is more 2 likely. 3 if somebody says there is no proof, like 4 connie was embarrassed to admit that matt told her 5 about the dangers of smoking -- if somebody, when 6 you are deliberating, says there is no proof. 7 everything you heard is proof. this is proof. the 8 question is what is the greater weight of the 9 evidence. all of the treaters, all of the medical 10 records, or four paid opinion witnesses, only one of 11 whom said you need a pulmonary function test to 12 diagnose copd. 13 you were shown this, the quitting methods 14 not used. i'm not going to go through this again 15 because i think you remember exactly why each of 16 these was not used. but it does not seem right to me 17 to say he did not quit hard enough, he did not try 18 hard enough, while the whole time they were 19 whispering in his ear you do not have to quit today. 20 there is no proof, and if there is ever any proof 21 anything is wrong we will take it out. if you are 22 worried about it, just switch to filters, you do not 23 have to quit today. tomorrow see what happens, the 24 jury will be back, the jury will be in. the jury 25 never came in, not until 2000. so while they are 1 whispering in his ear you do not have to quit today, 2 which to someone who is an addict of any kind 3 including a nicotine addict, it sounds a little 4 different. you do not have to quit today. 5 let me show you a couple of those. 6 can we see 952e, please? 7 tens of thousands of doctors in all 8 branches of medicine in all parts of the country 9 were asked that question, what cigarette do you 10 smoke, doctor? the brand named most was camel. 11 yes, survey shows more doctors smoke camels than any 12 other cigarette. smoke camel, the cigarette so many 13 doctors enjoy. 14 887, please. 15 this is timothy v. hartnett, former 16 president of a major tobacco firm and chairman of 17 the industry research committee. mr. mauro, i would 18 like to quote from a statement released at the time 19 the tobacco institute research committee was formed. 20 at that time we stated, we accept an interest in 21 people's health as a basic responsibility paramount 22 to every other consideration in our business, and 23 that is where we stand today. 24 235. 25 "question: suppose the tremendous amount 1 of research now going on including that of the 2 tobacco industry research committee were to reveal 3 there is a cancer causing agent in cigarettes. what 4 then? 5 "answer: well, if it was found by 6 somebody working under the tobacco industry research 7 grant, it would be made public immediately, and just 8 as broadly as we could make it, and then efforts 9 would be taken to attempt to remove that substance 10 or substances. 11 there are other videos that you will have 12 the capability if you want to watch any of them. 13 but if you remember the governors coming out and 14 saying the various states when the surgeon general 15 reports came out, if there is anything found wrong 16 with cigarettes, they will just take it out. 17 more importantly, all those things he said 18 he did not do to quit, they are not on the verdict 19 form. you see, whether he could have quit or 20 whether he tried hard enough to quit or how much he 21 wanted to quit, that is not on the verdict form. 22 the only question was whether he was addicted. 23 mr. geise said he is not big for labels. 24 what does addiction mean? the real question is 25 whether he could quit. the real question is on the 1 verdict form. that is the one you have to answer. 2 if somebody is saying i think he could have quit, 3 that is not an issue for you today. just talk very 4 briefly about dr. yount who you heard from today and 5 mr. geise discussed. 6 he told you the leftsided heart failure he 7 talked about, there is two parts of leftsided heart 8 failure, systolic and diastolic. 9 when you look at the systolic 10 measurements, the function systolically of his heart 11 in his entire life, five of the seven 12 echocardiograms done showed no systolic dysfunction. 13 he admitted that. and in the last year of his life, 14 completely normal. so that one side of the coin, 15 completely normal. 16 the other side, diastolic, less than one 17 month before he died, yes, there was a problem, 18 which his treating doctors diagnosed and discussed 19 at length in their depositions. and the 20 cardiologist on the report says early grade one, not 21 grade two, three, four, not endstage fatal like his 22 copd was, endstage, and dr. yount admitted that. 23 not just that it said early grade one, but he 24 admitted that when he looked at the echo it was 25 grade one. 1 i did not realize it until he testified 2 today. i thought i was going to tell you that 3 congestive heart failure, there has got to be a 4 reason for it, and they do not have one. they are 5 just picking congestive heart failure and saying he 6 had it. but congestive heart failure has to be 7 caused by something. it is a syndrome. but they do 8 have an answer for that. 9 if you remember from opening and then 10 listen to dr. yount today, mr. geise said in opening 11 that just before he was hospitalized, matthew 12 buonomo was hospitalized for the first time and 13 diagnosed with copd in 1995, had gone to the doctor, 14 he had been feeling ill for a few weeks, maybe 15 months, maybe up to two months, short of breath, he 16 went to the doctor, and was prescribed verapamil. 17 verapamil is contraindicated. he said i did not know 18 what contraindicated means when i started this case. 19 he said he was prescribed verapamil. if you have 20 congestive heart failure, it is going to exacerbate 21 it and the verapamil sent him into the hospital. 22 then dr. yount said today he was on verapamil for 23 the rest of his life. 24 so they are not just saying he did not have 25 copd. they are saying he had congestive heart 1 failure caused by a medication prescribed by his 2 doctors. that is the cause, and there has to be a 3 cause. so not only did they treat him for the wrong 4 disease supposedly for 13 years, they gave him the 5 medication that ended up killing him. 6 he never called himself addicted. mr. 7 geise said he never called himself addicted. i'm 8 sure if they said no one remembers him saying that, 9 what does that have to do with anything. he did not 10 know what addiction was. connie did not understand 11 it until she saw dr. henningfield's deposition. but 12 more importantly, we cannot ask him. his mother 13 lived to 95, almost two-decade longer than him. we 14 cannot ask him if he thought he was addicted because 15 he died from copd caused by smoking cigarettes 16 almost two decades before his mother. 17 mr. geise said dr. cummings combed his 18 archives for the most inflammatory videos he could 19 find. you have not seen any evidence yet of what 20 they did. 21 mr. geise: objection, your honor. 22 the court: overruled. 23 mr. uustal: there was some suggestion it 24 could not have been copd because there were some 25 findings you were shown in the medical record that 1 showed that on some occasions he was better than on 2 other occasions. 3 dr. klotz, who is again their 4 pulmonologist, not a treating doctor but someone 5 hired for litigation, was asked do you agree that 6 copd is with you all the time even when you do not 7 have symptoms. 8 and remember everyone agrees the damage to 9 the lungs from emphysema is irreversible. but you 10 get treated. they have various types of treatment 11 including medication, spiriva, which is a new 12 medication during one part of his treatment when he 13 came out specifically for copd, it did wonders for 14 him for awhile. but, yes, dr. klotz agreed, if you 15 have the disease, it is always with you, even if you 16 do not have symptoms. sometimes you have them, 17 sometimes you do not. so, yes, sometimes in there he 18 is better than other times. 19 dr. silver was one of the doctors who 20 wrote in there that sometimes no respiratory 21 distress and things like that. 22 can we see dr. silver 225? 23 "question: when matthew buonomo comes and 24 says he feels better, does he still have emphysema? 25 "answer: all the time. 1 "question: is shortness of breath a 2 routine for him? 3 "answer: that is just a baseline for him. 4 a good day for him might be i'm not as short of 5 breath today, but i'm always short of breath. today 6 might be a good day. tomorrow might be a bad day. 7 someone sneezes and gets a cold, that might be an 8 awful day. to him a good day might be i'm able to 9 walk across the room and i'm not gasping for air. 10 there apparently was no pulmonary function 11 test. you remember dr. silver said i do not know if 12 there was a pulmonary function test. you do not need 13 one to diagnose it. but i do not know, i cannot tell 14 from the record we have. but apparently there was 15 no pft. 16 mr. geise said when dr. bolton is not 17 acting as an expert he gives his patients pulmonary 18 function tests. so i do not understand that. in 19 1995, a decade, more than a decade before this 20 lawsuit, when he was treating a patient, he did not 21 give him a pulmonary function test because in this 22 case he is an expert and he is not an expert. he 23 was not paid to fly across the country and come in 24 here and tell you things he knew nothing about. it 25 was his patient. 1 but once again, you heard from only one 2 witness you need a pulmonary function test, and he 3 said the exact opposite a couple months ago, that 4 you can diagnose copd clinically. he told us what 5 that was. radiologically he said x-rays. pulmonary 6 function test. and he said well, i was wrong. that 7 is what he told you. couple months ago i was wrong 8 when i said you could diagnose it that way. 9 he was right last time. because every 10 single other witness you heard from agrees with 11 that. and none of their experts other than him said 12 that. 13 the last thing i want to show you, his 14 treating doctors saw him a lot. a lot. they would 15 have you believe they did not know whether he had -- 16 they thought he had copd and he did not, so i just -- 17 i do not know if any of you know what it is like for 18 someone with copd and how big a mistake, how obvious 19 a mistake that would have to be. dr. silver talked 20 about that. 21 silver 222, please. 22 "question: what can a patient with severe 23 emphysema expect to go through as his or her 24 condition worsens over time? 25 "answer: that depends. if someone has a 1 mild case, some mild shortness of breath. simple 2 symptoms of maybe a cough or just not feeling 3 totally normal, fatigued at times to people all the 4 way up to severe where walking across the room is a 5 great deal for them. it is a terrible, terrible 6 condition because basically you are suffocating. you 7 are unable to get enough oxygen into your body. it 8 is a very, very terrible condition. 9 you remember they all said he had severe 10 copd. the last thing he talks about is endstage 11 copd, fatal copd, which he was diagnosed with. 12 silver 223. 13 "question: emphysema is a condition 14 covered under the umbrella of copd? 15 "answer: yes, it is. 16 was that 223? 17 "question: what do those patients go 18 through whose disease progresses to endstage copd? 19 "answer: unfortunately, it is just a 20 debilitating disease that basically ends up 21 ultimately killing them. they go through terrible 22 bouts of shortness of breath, exacerbation, fatigue, 23 unable to do their daily living, daily activities, 24 because of severe lung dysfunction. basically they 25 are sort of a captive from their illness because 1 they cannot do their regular daily activities because 2 they are too short of breath. 3 the court: you need to conclude. 4 mr. uustal: thank you for your patience. 5 please, the questions are on the verdict form, those 6 are the ones you need to answer. thank you.
