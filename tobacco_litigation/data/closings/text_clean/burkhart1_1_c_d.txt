closing argument by the defense 13:08:36 mr. belasic: thank you. may it please the court? 13:08:38 good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, counsel, 13:08:40 mrs. burkhart. 13:08:41 on page 11 of your jury instructions -- and as you 13:08:43 heard judge jones say this morning, it was and still is 13:08:48 legal to manufacture cigarettes, to sell cigarettes, and 13:08:51 advertise cigarettes. 13:08:53 now, as the judge told you, that does not mean the 4 13:08:56 1 tobacco companies win. but what it does mean is that this 13:08:59 2 verdict in this case will be decided on the facts that are 13:09:02 3 specific to mrs. burkhart. 13:09:03 4 now, you have heard their experts, and you have seen 13:09:07 5 all the testimony about the warnings. and so you know that 13:09:10 6 even when congress decided that cigarettes were dangerous, 13:09:14 7 that cigarettes would cause premature death, congress 13:09:18 8 decided that they would be able to be sold. 13:09:20 9 mr. heimann: i object. this is the subject of 13:09:22 the order, your honor. this kind of argument on the 13:09:24 legality -- 13:09:24 the court: overruled. and i just remind the 13:09:26 jury, this is counsel's argument. 13:09:28 mr. belasic: as their own experts admitted, 13:09:30 congress decided that cigarettes could be sold even if they 13:09:34 were dangerous, even if they were addictive, as long as 13:09:36 they had the warning. and we know that for 50 years that 13:09:41 warning's been on the pack. and we know -- we know that 13:09:45 mrs. burkhart saw that warning. 13:09:46 now, let us talk about the facts of this case. 13:09:50 when mrs. burkhart took the stand, one of the first very 13:09:55 direct questions i asked her is why she started smoking. 13:09:58 and she said two words: her mother. and then i asked her, 13:10:02 so it was not anything that a tobacco company did? and she 13:10:05 said her mother smoked. the cigarettes were there. and i 5 13:10:09 1 asked her, was it any advertising, you know, any 13:10:13 2 advertising, let alone the false advertising that the 13:10:16 3 plaintiff's claim? did that cause you to smoke? and she 13:10:19 4 said, no, the cigarettes were there. 13:10:21 5 so there is no dispute here that in 1958 when a 13:10:25 6 smart senior in high school picked up her mother's 13:10:27 7 cigarettes, it was not because of something that a tobacco 13:10:30 8 company had did or had done or had said. 13:10:34 9 she chose to smoke, and her mother made the 13:10:37 cigarettes available. 13:10:40 now, mrs. burkhart enjoyed smoking. she told you 13:10:42 from the stand that she enjoyed smoking. later she gave 13:10:46 some different testimony. but the eyewitness in this case, 13:10:50 the man that i told you would be the most important witness 13:10:52 in this case, the man that you did not hear about from 13:10:56 plaintiff's counsel in opening, the man who was not called 13:10:59 in plaintiff's case, was mr. burkhart. 13:11:03 and you saw that mr. burkhart listed when 13:11:08 mr. isasi questioned him that his wife enjoyed smoking, 13:11:12 that it relaxed her, that she liked it in social settings, 13:11:15 that it helped relieve stress. 13:11:18 so when you were asked, why would someone smoke 13:11:20 all of these years if she knew? plaintiffs say, well, it is 13:11:23 a simple act. it is a simple answer. it is addiction. we 13:11:27 know that she enjoyed smoking. 6 13:11:29 1 now, you see on the screen in front of you that 13:11:32 2 mrs. burkhart did not try to quit smoking for decades, even 13:11:34 3 when she knew the risk. and i'll talk about some of that 13:11:37 4 evidence. but it is not disputed that she saw the warning 13:11:42 5 at a minimum in 1966. she admitted it when i asked her. 13:11:46 6 she made no effort to quit in 1966 or 1967 or 1968 or 1969 13:11:53 7 or the '70s. 13:11:55 8 so when mr. heimann says that she was desperately 13:11:59 9 trying to quit, that is not what the evidence in this case 13:12:01 shows. the evidence showed that for decades she knew the 13:12:04 risks before she made any effort. the evidence shows that 13:12:09 she stopped briefly in the 1980s. 13:12:11 we all heard the smokenders evidence. now, her 13:12:14 husband says it was only a few days, and now he remembers 13:12:17 that, well, maybe he was in orlando, so it could have been 13:12:20 three weeks. 13:12:20 but whether, ladies and gentlemen, whether it was 13:12:23 three days or three weeks, that is the only time she 13:12:27 stopped smoking in 36 years until 1994 when, in her own 13:12:35 words -- and you have seen their own experts agree. you 13:12:38 heard mrs. burkhart say it, and you saw the videotape where 13:12:41 mrs. burkhart says it -- the first time she got it in her 13:12:45 head that she was going to quit, she did. 13:12:48 and whether you call it addiction or habit or 13:12:51 dependency, in her own words, when she really made up her 7 13:12:55 1 mind to quit, she did. and her success rate at quitting 13:12:59 2 was one hundred percent, one attempt when she really made up her 13:13:04 3 mind. and then she quit. 13:13:05 4 now, based on that, was mrs. burkhart's smoking 13:13:12 5 involuntary? the evidence is clear that she made a huge 13:13:15 6 variety of choices, but the evidence from plaintiff's 13:13:19 7 experts, they admit smoking is not involuntary. 13:13:22 8 you saw the surgeon general reports, and i'll show 13:13:25 9 you some of those. smoking is not involuntary. 13:13:28 and, of course, it is not. because mrs. burkhart 13:13:31 had smoked for 36 years, their expert who says that she is 13:13:35 addicted under some definition says that she was at the 13:13:38 peak of her addiction. mrs. burkhart says that she was at 13:13:41 the peak of her smoking, three packs a day. 13:13:44 but the first time she put her mind to it, and, 13:13:47 again, in her own words, that first time she was able to 13:13:50 quit. it was not involuntary. if she could quit a 13:13:54 36-year-old, 3-pack-a-day habit in 1994, she could have 13:13:59 quit in 1966 when she saw the warning or 1964 when she 13:14:04 heard the surgeon general's report or 1974 when her own 13:14:07 husband said that is going to kill you. 13:14:11 there is no dispute that she had the capacity and 13:14:14 the ability to quit, because she did. 13:14:22 now, let us look at some of the key facts. 13:14:25 mr. heimann said that he is not going to marshal the facts, 8 13:14:27 1 but he certainly talked about some of them. i am going to 13:14:29 2 marshal the facts. and the reason is we have had eight days 13:14:33 3 of facts. you have seen many of them have been disputed. 13:14:36 4 many of them have been contradicted by witnesses, and many 13:14:40 5 of them have been contradicted by the same witness. so 13:14:43 6 let us look at the facts that we have heard about 13:14:46 7 mrs. burkhart's smoking. 13:14:48 8 we know she started because her mother smoked. we 13:14:52 9 know that nothing the company said caused her to start 13:14:55 smoking. that is admitted on the stand just two days ago. 13:14:59 we know that when she was a regular smoker, she 13:15:04 was in college. when she started smoking as a senior in 13:15:06 high school, she did not even inhale. do you remember the 13:15:10 testimony that for the six months she did not even inhale 13:15:13 her cigarettes? 13:15:15 and i asked her, well, it was your friends who 13:15:17 taught you to inhale, right? not a tobacco company? and 13:15:21 again, she agrees. so by the time she was actually a 13:15:24 smoker, let alone a regular smoker, she was an adult. 13:15:28 she saw in the '60s from the very beginning her 13:15:32 father telling her mother that smoking was bad for her, 13:15:36 that she should quit because smoking was not good for her. 13:15:39 so she witnessed her own parents arguing and 13:15:45 warning about the risks of smoking. that was in 1968. she 13:15:50 made no effort to quit. she smoked for another 16 years 9 13:15:53 1 before she even thought of quitting. 13:15:55 2 she did not try to quit in the 1950s. we know 13:15:59 3 that. in the 1950s, we saw that the media reported the 13:16:02 4 risks. and i do not know what you thought of the battle of 13:16:07 5 the sticky notes, but you know that in the 1950s, there was 13:16:11 6 a tremendous amount of publicity, "reader's digest," 13:16:14 7 "time," "life" magazine, et cetera. she made no effort to 13:16:21 8 quit smoking in response to any of that information. 13:16:24 9 we know she read the newspapers, and you all saw 13:16:27 those reports. she made no effort to quit when she saw 13:16:30 them. 13:16:31 we have heard that they liked tv news, the 13:16:34 burkharts. we have heard that they liked to see walter 13:16:36 cronkite. we have seen some of reports that were on 13:16:39 television news. most of those were in the '60s, some in 13:16:42 the '70s. 13:16:43 but, again, during that period, not once did 13:16:46 mrs. burkhart make any effort to quit. according to her, 13:16:50 she went from 1958 all the way to 1984, 26 years, ladies 13:16:58 and gentlemen. despite all the warnings, despite her 13:17:01 husband saying it would kill her, despite the warning on 13:17:04 the pack for 20 years, she made no effort to quit. she 13:17:07 stopped briefly in the '80s. and then ten years later, 13:17:09 she made up her mind. 13:17:11 this is not the story of a desperate smoker who is 10 13:17:15 1 making attempt after attempt, quit effort after quit 13:17:19 2 effort. this is the story of a woman who quit the first 13:17:22 3 time. and, again, it is her own words. we did not need to 13:17:26 4 have some expert witness hired by a tobacco company to come 13:17:30 5 in and tell you why she quit and when she quit. she did. 13:17:34 6 she told you that from the stand. 13:17:36 7 we know the '64 surgeon general's report was one 13:17:42 8 of the most widely reported public health stories of the 13:17:46 9 century. you saw on video when dr. burns admitted that. 13:17:50 1964, she made no effort to quit. she would not even think 13:17:53 of quitting for 20 years later despite a warning that it 13:17:57 could cause a deadly disease, lung cancer. 13:17:59 and then in '66, the first pack warning came on. 13:18:06 i asked her, you saw that warning? she said she did. made 13:18:09 no effort. it did not change her ability. now, mr. heimann 13:18:13 asserted, well, if she had only known that it could cause 13:18:18 disease, if she had only known that it was addictive, she 13:18:21 would not have smoked or she would not have quit. 13:18:23 but we know what she did when she was given direct 13:18:27 and explicit information. we know what she did. and when 13:18:31 the warning was on every single pack, she made no effort to 13:18:35 quit. that was her right. no one's blaming her. but that 13:18:40 was her right. and you will assess her responsibility for 13:18:44 making that decision. 13:18:46 she told me that in the 1960s, 1960s -- this 11 13:18:50 1 is 20 years before she makes any effort to quit -- that she 13:18:54 2 was calling her smoking a nicotine fit. she knew what 13:18:57 3 nicotine was. she knew it was in her cigarettes. she was 13:19:01 4 expressing the fact that she thought she was smoking for 13:19:04 5 nicotine. 13:19:04 6 i asked her if she believed she was addicted at 13:19:10 7 the time in the mid to late 1960s. and she agreed. now, 13:19:15 8 mr. heimann says, well, there was a concealment. no one 13:19:17 9 knew that smoking was addictive. the tobacco companies had 13:19:20 a sentence in a document. out of 60 million pages, they 13:19:25 had a sentence in a document that said the word addiction. 13:19:28 how could she have known? 13:19:31 she told you from the stand. i did not need to pay 13:19:33 $4 million for an expert to come in or a man who has 13:19:38 been -- or a man who testifies for a living. she told you 13:19:41 that. in the 1960s, she thought she smoked for nicotine. 13:19:45 she described herself as addicted. 13:19:47 so what did she do in the 1960s when she knew and 13:19:51 believed that? she chose to smoke. she made no effort to 13:19:55 quit in the 1960s, made no effort to quit in the 1970s. 13:20:00 now, all of us look back on decisions in our lives 13:20:03 with hindsight. and obviously, most of the events that 13:20:06 have occurred that we have discussed in this case are in the 13:20:10 past. so it is only natural to look back and say, well, 13:20:13 what should i have done or what would i have done? 12 13:20:17 1 but we know when she heard about addiction, when 13:20:22 2 she heard about lung cancer, when she heard her own husband 13:20:25 3 say it is going to kill you, she did not try to quit. 13:20:28 4 and so the idea that if r.j. reynolds had put up a 13:20:32 5 paragraph in the "new york times" and said all of that 13:20:39 6 statistical evidence we have been disputing, we now think 13:20:43 7 it is true, the idea that she would have quit the next day, 13:20:46 8 ladies and gentlemen, that is not borne out by her own 13:20:49 9 testimony. 13:20:49 you know, they brought in a witness who is almost 13:20:52 made $4 million, dr. burns. and, you know, he put on his 13:20:58 thinking cap. he said, i think she was influenced. i 13:21:02 think she relied. 13:21:03 he did not even talk to her. he does not even know 13:21:05 her. he did not even have all of the depositions. 13:21:07 we know what she said from the stand. and for 13:21:09 those 20 years, she was being warned over and over again. 13:21:13 she did not try to quit. so the idea that a little more 13:21:17 information or a sentence out of a document from a tobacco 13:21:21 company would have caused her to quit, even her own 13:21:26 testimony did not support that, ladies and gentlemen. 13:21:27 we just saw the 1970 warning. she said she saw 13:21:36 that warning. she made no effort to quit in the 1970s. 13:21:40 but what we heard from mr. burkhart is that they 13:21:42 would have conversations. and on this conversation, 13 13:21:46 1 mr. isasi specifically asked him -- and he specifically 13:21:49 2 agreed -- that these kind of conversations started around 13:21:53 3 the very first time they met in that first year, 1974 and 13:21:58 4 1975. 13:22:01 5 now, when the man you love most and trust most 13:22:05 6 says you are doing something that will kill you, that is a 13:22:07 7 warning that is more direct, ladies and gentlemen, than a 13:22:11 8 "time" magazine or the warning on the pack. and it is not 13:22:14 9 disputed in this case. 13:22:16 and her response was not to try to quit. it was 13:22:20 not to ask a doctor for help. her response was to say, 13:22:23 it is my life. and she was right because she gets to make 13:22:27 the decisions. 13:22:30 but in hindsight, she now looks back and says, i 13:22:33 made the wrong decision. i could quit, but i quit later. 13:22:39 and now we know that she wants 10 to $15 million for that 13:22:43 decision. 13:22:49 i asked mrs. burkhart if she had seen the 1985 13:22:54 warning. and that is important because it says emphysema 13:22:56 right on it. and she continued to smoke. even though the 13:22:59 packs of cigarettes that were in her hand, the packs of 13:23:02 cigarettes that were in her purse, the packs of cigarettes 13:23:06 that were on her table said, smoking causes emphysema. 13:23:10 now, she told me that she had seen the warnings 13:23:13 all the way back to 1966. but when it came to the 14 13:23:16 1 emphysema warning, she said, i had bifocals. i did not read 13:23:21 2 the warning. 13:23:22 3 and i asked her, you were not even looking for the 13:23:24 4 warning? 13:23:25 5 no. 13:23:25 6 so her story is that because she wears bifocals, 13:23:30 7 even though she read the newspaper every day with those 13:23:33 8 same bifocals, the print much smaller in the newspaper, she 13:23:38 9 said she never saw the warning. 13:23:39 you have to judge the credibility, the financial 13:23:42 interest, and all the other factors that judge jones has 13:23:45 told you about when you evaluate every witness; and not 13:23:48 just evaluating a tobacco company witness, but you have to 13:23:52 evaluate the credibility of mr. and mrs. burkhart and what 13:23:56 they said under oath. 13:23:58 so she admits she was warned on the pack it could 13:24:01 cause emphysema, but she did not see it. you will hear later, 13:24:07 her husband said she did, and they talked about it. 13:24:10 well, her husband says when he would tell her it 13:24:15 would kill her, she said, yeah, i know that. she herself 13:24:18 said, one of these days, these things are probably going to 13:24:21 kill us. 13:24:22 her husband says in the first year he met her, '74 13:24:25 and '75, she would light up and he would call it a coffin nail. 13:24:30 she would light up and he would call it a cancer stick. did she 15 13:24:34 1 try to quit in '74 and '75? no. did she try to quit at 13:24:39 2 all in the 1970s? 13:24:40 3 now, those warnings coming from the man you love 13:24:43 4 most are far more direct than a pack warning. and so we 13:24:47 5 know what she would do. we know that if she got a little 13:24:51 6 more information she was not going to quit. 13:24:54 7 and mrs. burkhart said, frankly, it is a personal 13:24:57 8 decision. we heard she would not warn her own sister to 13:25:00 9 stop smoking because she said it is a personal thing. the 13:25:04 smoker has to make the decision. and she did. 13:25:10 we know she saw public service announcements. one 13:25:14 ran in 1985. the ashtray ad ran in 1967. 13:25:20 and finally, we know what mr. burkhart said that 13:25:23 he had -- they had verbal fights about smoking. and when 13:25:26 they would get mad, they would be blunt and direct: 13:25:29 you are going to kill yourself. 13:25:30 it is my life. 13:25:31 you are going to kill yourself. 13:25:33 it is my decision. 13:25:34 no warning. no warning could be more explicit and 13:25:38 more personal and more direct than that. but she decided 13:25:42 to not try to quit. she quit once in the '80s for a few 13:25:47 days or a few weeks. 13:25:52 we heard from her husband that when she talked to 13:25:55 her cousins, in her own words, she would say, i've got to 16 13:25:58 1 quit these damn things or they are going to kill me. 13:26:11 2 ladies and gentlemen, that is an incredible amount 13:26:12 3 of evidence of the sheer amount of information and warning, 13:26:18 4 not something in a dry, scientific textbook. but she knew. 13:26:22 5 she was warned about the risks. she chose to continue. 13:26:25 6 it is a decision we all make when we decide whether 13:26:28 7 to exercise, eat, drink, et cetera. things affect our 13:26:33 8 health. 13:26:34 9 she made that decision, and she did it knowing 13:26:38 "it is going to kill you." nothing could be more direct. 13:26:42 now, we asked her -- and i asked her directly 13:26:47 right in the last five minutes of the cross-examination, 13:26:52 and i asked her specifically -- is not it true that the only 13:26:56 time you heard the tobacco companies -- she did not know who 13:27:00 they were -- but some tobacco source say it was not proven 13:27:05 was after 1984? and she said she was not certain and that 13:27:09 she said she did not think so. 13:27:11 and you saw i played the video. could not have 13:27:13 been more direct. is not it true that the only time you 13:27:17 heard a tobacco company say it was not proven was after 13:27:22 1984? and on the videotape, under sworn oath, she said, 13:27:26 that is true. and then she explained why she knows that. 13:27:30 she says she went to smokenders in 1984. and you 13:27:34 saw on the videotape that she said under oath that she 13:27:37 never heard a tobacco company or some unidentified tobacco 17 13:27:41 1 source say it is not proven until after 1984. 13:27:46 2 and we know what her response was. she told me, 13:27:50 3 who do they think they are kidding? who do they think 13:27:53 4 they are kidding? 13:27:55 5 she did not believe the very statements that the 13:27:59 6 plaintiff's lawyer has relied upon to build this case. i 13:28:05 7 did not need to bring in a doctor who is never met 13:28:09 8 mrs. burkhart to guess what she might have thought 20 or 30 13:28:12 9 years ago. 13:28:13 our witness, the defense witness, is 13:28:17 mrs. burkhart. and literally, our witness, the defense 13:28:20 witness, is mr. burkhart. you saw what they said. 13:28:27 the last thing that mrs. burkhart told me when i 13:28:31 decided to stop was, i did not believe them at all. and she 13:28:35 talked about she did not believe that it was not proven, but 13:28:39 she also said the idea that there was going to be benefits 13:28:43 from filters, the idea that there was going to be benefits 13:28:46 from lights. and she said, i do not believe them all. who 13:28:50 are they kidding? 13:28:52 now, mr. heimann says, oh, no, no. that is not 13:28:54 what she meant. you have heard the testimony. it was just 13:28:57 two days ago. she was on the stand for only 45 minutes on 13:29:03 cross-examination. and you saw that testimony. 13:29:05 that is why i stopped, because the woman who is 13:29:08 suing for $15 million says that by the '80s, she did not 18 13:29:12 1 believe any claim. she had never heard it said not proven 13:29:18 2 before that. and she did not believe any claim that lights 13:29:21 3 or filters were better. 13:29:22 4 that is why i stopped, because that is her 13:29:24 5 testimony. 13:29:24 6 now, we are not retrying the engle lawsuit, ladies 13:29:30 7 and gentlemen. but you would not know it. because 13:29:32 8 mr. heimann constantly is talking about issues that were 13:29:35 9 already decided. 13:29:37 you are not going to decide if the tobacco 13:29:40 companies did something wrong or if they concealed 13:29:42 information. we are not retrying that. 13:29:45 and when you see the verdict form, every question 13:29:46 on the verdict form is about mrs. burkhart. it is not about 13:29:52 r.j. reynolds or philip morris or lorillard. it is about 13:29:55 mrs. burkhart. 13:29:56 we presented the key witnesses. mrs. burkhart's 13:30:00 cross-examination, mr. burkhart. that is what we know. and 13:30:04 that is why this case is about mrs. burkhart. 13:30:12 miss gallagher is going to talk a little about 13:30:14 this issue later, but i want to highlight for you that 13:30:16 obviously mr. and mrs. burkhart contradicted each other. 13:30:20 there were a whole variety of issues where their testimony 13:30:23 simply did not sync up. 13:30:26 but what i want to also note, and i'm sure you 19 13:30:28 1 remember a whole variety of incidents, is that they 13:30:31 2 contradicted themselves. repeatedly, over and over again, 13:30:36 3 a direct and simple question produced an answer that, now 13:30:41 4 you know, was different than what they said under oath 13:30:44 5 before trial. 13:30:47 6 you saw us play videotape after videotape of what 13:30:50 7 they said under oath. they contradicted each other. 13:30:53 8 plaintiff has the burden of proof. and you will 13:30:59 9 have to decide what the credibility of witnesses who 13:31:02 disagree with each other and who contradict themselves mean 13:31:07 as far as whether mrs. burkhart has established her burden 13:31:11 of proof. 13:31:12 now, the plaintiff's experts we know are paid 13:31:15 millions. millions. i think the one that was paid the 13:31:19 least might have been dr. cummings, who said he is only made 13:31:23 1.3 or only $1.5 million doing this, he admits, for a 13:31:29 living. 13:31:30 they never talked to mrs. burkhart, even though 13:31:32 they said she was addicted. they never picked up the phone 13:31:36 and talked to her. and you saw when i cross-examined them, 13:31:40 and you saw on the videotape, that they would ignore her 13:31:44 own testimony. 13:31:45 when i had asked dr. cummings, is not this what she 13:31:49 said under oath? he would say, i do not remember that. 13:31:52 dr. burns told me on the video, well, that is not 20 13:31:55 1 in my notes. 13:31:55 2 and then we learned that it was the plaintiff's 13:31:58 3 lawyers who gave only part of the deposition to dr. burns. 13:32:01 4 he did not even have the whole facts, ladies and gentlemen. 13:32:04 5 did not even have the whole facts. and he laughed when i 13:32:07 6 asked him, he said, well, obviously, mr. belasic, i do not 13:32:11 7 know what i do not know. i do not know what i did not read. 13:32:14 8 but that is the whole point, ladies and gentlemen. 13:32:16 9 do not bring in someone who has made millions of dollars, 13:32:19 who is never even talked to the plaintiff, who is never even 13:32:23 read the full testimony of the person who now wants $15 13:32:26 million. that is not fair. you will decide what the 13:32:30 credibility of witnesses who ignore the testimony of the 13:32:33 people who actually were there. 13:32:36 dr. cummings talked about advertising. i asked 13:32:42 him one simple question: did you actually show the jury a 13:32:46 single advertisement for a brand that mrs. burkhart smoked? 13:32:49 and he said no. 13:32:52 he is made a million dollars testifying. he is 13:32:54 testified at 20 trials. but he could not put in the time to 13:32:58 even find a single advertisement that mrs. burkhart ever 13:33:01 saw. we are not retrying engle. his testimony had nothing 13:33:06 to do with mrs. burkhart or her response to advertising. 13:33:09 and when i asked him, well, wait a second, did not 13:33:12 her husband tell her it was going to kill her? and she 21 13:33:16 1 said, it is my life and i'm going to smoke any way? 13:33:19 2 he said he does not remember that. does not 13:33:22 3 remember that. not in his notes. 13:33:26 4 someone that is been paid $1.5 million and does not 13:33:29 5 remember the sworn testimony that you saw, that you know 13:33:33 6 exists, you decide why someone would do that. why would an 13:33:37 7 expert not know the basic facts, and at the same time be 13:33:41 8 picking up 10 or $20,000 a case for the last four years. 13:33:45 9 now, dr. proctor has obviously been paid a lot of 13:33:51 money, the historian. he admitted right off the bat, he 13:33:55 was very open about it, he did not know anything about the 13:33:58 burkharts. he was just there to talk about history. 13:34:01 he did not say that there was anything that was 13:34:02 done to a cigarette that mrs. burkhart actually smoked. he 13:34:07 did not show any advertisement that she actually saw. he 13:34:12 does not know what she smoked. he barely even said the name 13:34:16 mrs. burkhart. 13:34:19 now, we presume that he knew this was a case 13:34:22 called burkhart, but he presented no testimony that would 13:34:24 be relevant to her. 13:34:26 and you have to ask yourself why he was even 13:34:29 there. because the issues of what the tobacco companies 13:34:33 did or the questions that judge jones talked about, those 13:34:36 were decided. this was the case, this was the chance, this 13:34:41 was the obligation of the plaintiffs to present the proof 22 13:34:45 1 from mrs. burkhart. 13:34:47 2 and dr. proctor did not know a darn thing about 13:34:49 3 her. 13:34:53 4 now, dr. burns, obviously very distinguished in 13:34:56 5 terms of writing articles, writing portions of surgeon 13:34:59 6 general's reports. he is been paid almost $4 million. made 13:35:03 7 almost half a million last year. 13:35:07 8 but he never met her. he never talked to her. 13:35:10 9 and he admitted the lawyers picked out parts of the 13:35:13 depositions. parts. 13:35:16 and so you saw -- and it got a little testy 13:35:19 between me and dr. burns, because he would tell me, well, i 13:35:22 do not have it. why do not you show it to me? 13:35:24 well, that was a trial testimony, ladies and 13:35:26 gentlemen. the time for homework was over. dr. burns 13:35:30 admits he did not have all the information. you do. you 13:35:33 actually know more than their expert. you know more than a 13:35:37 man who writes articles for a living. 13:35:41 and i say that because he told us that from 1990 13:35:45 on, from 1990 through 2007, he spent 95 percent of his time 13:35:52 researching, writing, and testifying in litigation for 13:35:56 lawyers who sue tobacco companies. 13:35:59 he spent 5 percent of his time on patients. think 13:36:03 about what that means. the man that they brought in to 13:36:06 talk about when mrs. burkhart had copd, or when she had her 23 13:36:12 1 symptoms -- he is been retired for the last seven or eight 13:36:17 2 years -- and going all the way back to '90, a quarter of a 13:36:20 3 century, he spent only a tiny fraction of his time actually 13:36:24 4 seeing doctors (sic.) 13:36:27 5 that is why we brought in dr. cosmo, somebody who 13:36:30 6 sees 800 patients a month, somebody who has been practicing 13:36:34 7 in the real world of real pulmonology, with thousands of 13:36:37 8 patients over and over again for the last 28 years. 13:36:40 9 they brought you somebody that writes articles. 13:36:48 one of the things that mr. heimann said -- and 13:36:53 you will have to decide if there is any evidence in the 13:36:56 record -- is, again, this speculation, wow, if they had 13:37:01 opened their files, she would not have smoked. 13:37:03 and we talked about what she knew, but let us just 13:37:06 quickly review. these types of warnings -- and you have to 13:37:10 decide, is a warning of death enough to motivate someone? 13:37:14 because if it is, then we know that mrs. burkhart was 13:37:21 warned. then we know that mrs. burkhart did not rely on a 13:37:25 tobacco company saying or not saying something. 13:37:27 she was not fooled. bottom line, she was not 13:37:29 fooled. 13:37:30 her husband tells her, here's another nail in your 13:37:34 coffin. here's a cancer stick. he says it could kill you. 13:37:37 and she says, i know. these conversations all 13:37:41 happen in the 1970s. she says, it is my life. she says, i 24 13:37:45 1 know that. 13:37:48 2 mr. burkhart, he said they got mad at each other. 13:37:51 3 she was mad at his drinking. he was mad at her smoking. 13:37:55 4 and you heard mr. burkhart say, in his own words, it was 13:37:59 5 tit for tat. so he would say, you are killing yourself. and 13:38:02 6 she would say, it is my life. 13:38:04 7 well, now, 40 years later -- was the mid-'70s. 13:38:13 8 forty years later, mrs. burkhart is saying that she knew 13:38:16 9 but she made the wrong decision. and now her lawyer says 13:38:20 that she should be paid $15 million for that decision. 13:38:24 what we did hear is that in 1994, mr. burkhart 13:38:30 quit drinking. and then a few months later, mrs. burkhart 13:38:36 quit smoking. tit for tat. 13:38:39 during the time that mrs. burkhart knew the risks 13:38:46 and made no effort to quit, the 1960s, millions of people 13:38:50 across the country, people that were smoking as much as 13:38:55 her, smoking more than her, smoking the same type of 13:38:57 cigarettes, people who would be considered addicted under 13:38:59 the plaintiff's own definitions -- dr. cummings agreed, 13:39:03 dr. burns agreed, dr. proctor agreed -- millions were 13:39:08 quitting. 13:39:09 ten years after the surgeon general's report, 30 13:39:11 million americans quit. mrs. burkhart did not try to quit. 13:39:16 and, again, this is not a question of blame. she is 13:39:19 in here suing, saying that her decisions were somehow 25 13:39:23 1 influenced, that she was somehow tricked. this is not 13:39:26 2 blame. it is an assessment of responsibility. 13:39:32 3 no one, no one could decide for her when to try to 13:39:35 4 quit, when to quit. she says herself she would not even 13:39:38 5 warn her sister. did not warn her husband. it is a personal 13:39:41 6 thing, she said. 13:39:42 7 no one else could control her smoking. 13:39:44 8 so 30 million people were quitting around her, of 13:39:47 9 every shape, size, and stripe of smoker. she did not even 13:39:51 try. now she wants $15 million for smoking a legal product 13:39:56 with the knowledge that it could kill her. 13:40:00 we heard that in the first four years of the 13:40:03 warnings, 13 million people quit. she did not even try. 13:40:11 when mr. heimann talks about her -- that she is a 13:40:14 desperate smoker, we all know and we have heard the evidence 13:40:18 of mrs. burkhart's situation. but what mr. heimann was 13:40:23 arguing was different. he said that when she was smoking, 13:40:27 and even during the times she was perfectly healthy, that 13:40:30 she was a desperate smoker. 13:40:31 well, is that really true? putting aside 13:40:35 everyone's natural sympathy for the situation that 13:40:39 mrs. burkhart is in now, think about the objective 13:40:42 evidence, even from mrs. burkhart herself, of what it was 13:40:46 like in the '60s, '70s, and '80s. 13:40:49 if you give her credit for quitting for three 26 13:40:51 1 weeks in 1984 -- her husband says it is a few days. he 13:40:55 2 says, well, i was on construction duty, so i could not see 13:40:58 3 it. 13:41:00 4 okay. let us say she quit for three weeks in 1984. 13:41:03 5 by her own testimony, she never ever, ever stopped smoking 13:41:07 6 again until '94. and then she quit for good. 13:41:11 7 she said, well, great american smokeout, but she 13:41:14 8 did not stop. she said her doctor gave her patches. she 13:41:17 9 kept on smoking. so we know she was not smoking for 13:41:20 nicotine. she was getting nicotine through the patch. she 13:41:22 smoked anyway. 13:41:24 so the only time that she stopped smoking between 13:41:27 1958 and 1994 was for those three weeks. 13:41:33 now, mr. heimann liked to talk about analogies to 13:41:37 car accidents. well, let us talk about real life people who 13:41:40 try to change their health. 13:41:43 if you hear a friend say, i've been seriously 13:41:47 trying to exercise. i've made a real commitment to change 13:41:50 my life. 13:41:51 and we then find out that that person exercised -- 13:41:54 let us say they went on a treadmill -- for three weeks out 13:41:58 of 36 years. no rational person would say, that is right. 13:42:03 you really were making a commitment. you were really 13:42:06 trying. 13:42:07 but that is what mrs. burkhart told us, that for 27 13:42:12 1 three weeks she stopped. for three weeks she made an 13:42:16 2 effort. 13:42:17 3 and she says in her own mind that was not really 13:42:20 4 the time that she made up her mind she was going to quit. 13:42:24 5 no one, no one would say that a person that goes on a diet 13:42:28 6 for a day and then takes the next decade off, or someone 13:42:33 7 that goes to look for a job for a day and then does not look 13:42:36 8 for a job for ten years, no one would say that those are 13:42:39 9 desperate or serious attempts to change their life. 13:42:43 but the facts for mrs. burkhart herself are that 13:42:47 from 1958 to 1984, a quarter of a century, she made no 13:42:52 effort to quit. 13:42:54 so this is not a case of a desperate smoker. it is 13:42:58 the case of a smoker who quit for three weeks in the 1980s 13:43:03 and then continued to smoke. and then quit the first time 13:43:06 she was going to put her mind to it. 13:43:08 that is not a $15 million case, ladies and 13:43:12 gentlemen. 13:43:12 her own words, she says until you get it into your 13:43:18 head that you are going to quit, you are just not going to 13:43:20 quit. 13:43:22 and then we asked her bluntly -- 13:43:28 i think the -- testing. all right. 13:43:30 the court: very good. 13:44:10 appreciate your patience for just a moment, 28 13:44:12 1 please. 13:44:19 2 mr. belasic: all right. we know that she said 13:44:23 3 she quit the first time that she got it in her head that 13:44:27 4 she was going to quit. and so i asked her directly, and 13:44:31 5 she said, well, she thought, on the stand, no, she thought 13:44:35 6 she did think it before. 13:44:37 7 and so you saw that i had to play the videotape of 13:44:39 8 her sworn testimony just five months ago in december. and 13:44:44 9 what she said was, it was the first time that she got it in 13:44:47 her head she was going to quit, was 1994. 13:44:50 and then she said something extremely important. 13:44:53 she said in her own words, i wish i had done that in 1984, 13:44:58 but i did not. 13:45:03 it is absolutely understandable that she wishes 13:45:06 that. we all have sympathy for the situation that 13:45:10 mrs. burkhart is in now. 13:45:11 but by her own testimony, in 1984, she did not do 13:45:15 that. in 1984, she did not make up her mind to quit 13:45:20 smoking. 13:45:22 now, if there is any evidence that had she quit 13:45:26 then, she would have avoided her injury -- and apparently 13:45:33 mr. heimann agrees that there is such evidence -- that is 13:45:36 very important. 13:45:36 but what it means, ladies and gentlemen, is that 13:45:38 she had the ability to quit and that she herself 29 13:45:40 1 acknowledges she had not made the kind of effort ever before 13:45:44 2 until 1994. 13:45:45 3 and what it means is that she is asking for 13:45:48 4 $15 million, maybe only $10 million according to 13:45:53 5 mr. heimann, for that decision. 13:45:54 6 regret and hindsight is absolutely understandable. 13:45:58 7 but it is not the substitute for proof that judge jones has 13:46:02 8 told you he requires. 13:46:04 9 now, their own experts agreed. dr. cummings, i 13:46:11 had to play the video, said anyone can quit if they make up 13:46:14 their mind to do it. 13:46:16 shook his head, oh, no, no, no, mr. belasic. we 13:46:19 had to roll the video where he said exactly that. 13:46:22 dr. cummings, the success rate for people who 13:46:23 really want to quit and stick to it is one hundred percent. again, 13:46:27 he denied he said it. he denied he meant it. i had to 13:46:32 roll the video. he said, plain as day, in his own 13:46:34 literature, he says the success rate for the truly 13:46:37 motivated is one hundred percent. 13:46:38 and that is what it was for mrs. burkhart. first 13:46:42 time she got it in her head, first time she made her mind 13:46:45 up, she quit. and she never, ever relapsed. 13:46:51 now, we know that 60 million people have quit. 13:46:55 what is important about that is that all of this argument 13:46:59 and all of the evidence, all of the claims that, well, 30 13:47:03 1 cigarettes change your brain, they trigger dopamine, which 13:47:08 2 dr. cummings admitted is triggered by any number of things, 13:47:12 3 anything from watching an exciting game, to kissing and 13:47:15 4 hugging, to food, to water, to sunshine. 13:47:17 5 all of those 60 million people had brains. they 13:47:21 6 had dopamine. they had serotonin. all of them had 13:47:25 7 receptors in their brains, just like all of us have the 13:47:28 8 same receptors. 13:47:29 9 and they all quit. and there was no evidence that 13:47:32 this -- the fact that you get some extra receptors when you 13:47:37 smoke, that that is what stops you from smoking. 13:47:40 the evidence is it is the most common health 13:47:44 behavior change that people make. 60 million people have 13:47:48 done it. and their brains, the cigarette design, the 13:47:54 filters, none of that stopped them. 13:47:57 and we know for a fact that it did not stop 13:48:00 mrs. burkhart. because when she made up her mind for the 13:48:02 first time, it was not nicotine or anything else. she quit. 13:48:06 now, this is dr. cummings' own guide. this was 13:48:12 their expert. and he says, there is no magic cure that can 13:48:15 help you to stop. but if you answer yes to these three 13:48:18 things, you can quit. 13:48:19 do you want to stop? 13:48:20 are you willing to make some changes? 13:48:22 and are you willing to put up with some uneasy 31 13:48:25 1 moments? 13:48:26 2 and that is their expert, ladies and gentlemen. 13:48:29 3 that is not a tobacco company. that is the american cancer 13:48:31 4 society and their witness. 13:48:33 5 now, let us talk about the verdict form and some of 13:48:35 6 the things you are going to decide. we know that 13:48:39 7 mrs. burkhart has the burden of proof on each of her 13:48:40 8 claims. as judge jones instructed you on the defenses, we 13:48:46 9 have the burden of proof. 13:48:46 you are going to be asked whether addiction -- 13:48:50 addiction, not smoking -- but whether addiction was a cause 13:48:53 of her injury. and this is the actual instruction that 13:48:58 you are going to get. 13:49:00 and the instruction is, in order to answer yes, 13:49:03 addiction has to directly -- so that is the first thing, 13:49:06 directly -- and in a natural and continuous sequence -- 13:49:10 that is the second thing, continuous -- produced or 13:49:14 contributed substantially to producing such injuries. 13:49:17 so there is three major issues i want you to think 13:49:20 about the evidence on: whether it was a direct cause, 13:49:24 whether it was a continuous cause, and whether it was a 13:49:27 substantial cause. 13:49:29 you saw a lot of evidence. let us review it. this 13:49:34 will be the first two questions. i think they are question 13:49:37 1-a and 1-b on the verdict form. 32 13:49:40 1 right off the bat, dr. burns, who wrote this 13:49:44 2 report, admitted to me on the video there is no 13:49:48 3 consensus -- meaning there is no argument -- on the 13:49:50 4 criteria for diagnosing nicotine addiction in an 13:49:54 5 individual. 13:49:54 6 it is a little different to say, here's the 13:49:57 7 definition of whether a drug is addictive and actually 13:50:00 8 applying it to an individual person. what are the 13:50:03 9 criteria? 13:50:04 the surgeon general himself says no agreement on 13:50:07 the criteria for diagnosing nicotine addiction. and 13:50:11 dr. burns agreed, in a person. 13:50:13 so plaintiff's, you have seen their definition. 13:50:17 their definition is, it is a brain disease and it causes 13:50:20 chronic relapse. a brain disease they call it that causes 13:50:25 chronic relapse. 13:50:26 well, let us see if their definition -- 13:50:28 mr. heimann: excuse me. this is 13:50:29 misrepresentation. it was about nicotine, diagnosing 13:50:33 nicotine addiction. now he is -- 13:50:40 mr. belasic: that is the whole point, your honor. 13:50:41 the court: we will note the difference. i remind 13:50:43 you that this is -- overruled. 13:50:44 i'll remind you that this is counsel's argument. 13:50:48 your memory of the facts is what prevails. counsel are not 33 13:50:52 1 witnesses. 13:50:53 2 mr. belasic: counsel is absolutely correct. and, 13:50:54 3 ladies and gentlemen, that is my point. 13:50:56 4 they produced a definition of what makes a 13:50:59 5 substance addictive. they produced no definition, they 13:51:03 6 did not produce the criteria to diagnose an individual. 13:51:06 7 the surgeon general says there is no agreement. 13:51:08 8 now, their definition is from nida, the national 13:51:12 9 institute of drug abuse. and they admit it just applies to 13:51:16 any drug. could apply to heroin, cocaine, barbiturates. 13:51:20 it is not a specific definition of nicotine addiction. 13:51:22 it was not meant to apply to an individual. that is 13:51:26 what dr. burns said when i asked him. 13:51:28 and, in fact, if you look at their definition, it 13:51:31 does not have individual criteria at all. but let us think, 13:51:35 does mrs. burkhart meet their definition? but more 13:51:39 importantly, did they meet their burden of proof? because 13:51:43 they have to meet their burden of proof. 13:51:46 the first thing is the nida definition talks about 13:51:49 chronic relapse. 13:51:51 mr. heimann: i object to this, your honor. 13:51:53 there is no proof of any brain injury. you cannot have proof 13:51:55 of brain injury in this sense unless she is dead and you do 13:51:58 an autopsy. 13:51:59 mr. belasic: objection to the argument. 34 13:52:02 1 the court: i do not understand the objection. 13:52:03 2 mr. heimann: see the fourth bullet point here, no 13:52:05 3 proof of any brain injury. it would be impossible to have 13:52:08 4 proof of any brain injury, because she is alive. the only 13:52:10 5 way -- 13:52:11 6 the court: you may note that for the jury. i'm 13:52:13 7 overruling the objection. 13:52:14 8 but, again, counsel is not a witness. your memory 13:52:18 9 controls. and counsel, of course, can point out any 13:52:23 inconsistencies in his reargument. 13:52:25 mr. belasic: so let us talk about the first part 13:52:27 of their definition, or one part where they say chronic 13:52:30 relapse. and chronic means more than temporary. it means 13:52:33 continuous or over a long period of time. 13:52:35 how many times did mrs. burkhart quit smoking and 13:52:39 then relapse? and the answer is once. once in 36 years. 13:52:44 the only time she quit smoking for even a day, 13:52:46 even any length of time, was 1984, smokenders. 13:52:51 and she went back to it. so if you count that as 13:52:54 a relapse, that is one time in 36 years. never stopped, 13:53:02 again, until 1994. 13:53:03 and then in her own mind, the first time she 13:53:06 really made up her mind, she quit. 13:53:08 so whether we speculate as to what was going on in 13:53:12 her brain, whether her brain was somehow different than the 35 13:53:16 1 60 million americans who quit smoking -- with the same 13:53:19 2 nicotine and the same cigarettes and the same type of 13:53:22 3 brain -- no matter what we speculate, we know that she 13:53:26 4 does not meet the definition of chronic relapse. 13:53:29 5 one time in 36 years. 13:53:32 6 and one hundred percent success when she made up her mind. 13:53:36 7 just like dr. cummings said in his own testimony. there 13:53:40 8 was no relapse once she quit in 1994. 13:53:44 9 now, did they present evidence that her brain was 13:53:48 somehow different than every other smoker who quit? of 13:53:53 course not. 13:53:54 one last thing to think about, ladies and 13:53:57 gentlemen. was she really smoking for nicotine? well, her 13:54:00 own medical records suggest otherwise. 13:54:02 we know that in 1993, she got nicotine patches. 13:54:05 and i asked her, obviously she was getting nicotine during 13:54:07 that period. she was getting nicotine from the patches. 13:54:10 she did not stop smoking at all. she was not 13:54:13 smoking for nicotine. 13:54:16 and in 1994, when she changed her mind, she was not 13:54:19 smoking for any reason at all. 13:54:22 this is what her husband said, all of the reasons 13:54:25 she enjoyed smoking: smoking, taste, relaxation, 13:54:29 responding to stress, the social benefits. she even liked 13:54:33 the feel in her hand. 36 13:54:34 1 and you saw me ask her repeatedly about each brand 13:54:37 2 that she smoked, whether she liked the taste, and for each 13:54:41 3 brand whether she was even thinking of quitting. 13:54:45 4 and each time she said, no, she was not thinking of 13:54:47 5 quitting, she was looking for a different brand. and for 13:54:50 6 each brand, she said she liked the taste. for different 13:54:54 7 reasons. sometimes she liked menthols and then ended up 13:54:57 8 hating it. so virginia slims tasted better. sometimes she 13:55:01 9 said the next brand. 13:55:02 but for each brand, she testified that she liked 13:55:04 the taste. 13:55:08 now, however the plaintiffs define addiction, did 13:55:11 it control mrs. burkhart? did it remove her ability, her 13:55:16 free will, her ability to make her own decision? 13:55:20 we know from the evidence it did not. she stopped 13:55:23 smoking and tried to stop smoking only once, in 1984, 13:55:27 before she quit for good. 13:55:29 and she says, under oath, looking back on that 13:55:32 day, looking back on that time, that that was not the type 13:55:36 of effort that she made in '94. 13:55:40 and she says, i wish i had done that, then she 13:55:42 could have quit. and she could have quit earlier. 13:55:45 and dr. burns admits that she did not lose the 13:55:48 capacity to quit at any time earlier. after all, she was 13:55:52 smoking more than she ever had in '94. and addiction 37 13:55:56 1 did not stop her from putting it down when she made her mind 13:55:59 2 up. 13:55:59 3 now, dr. burns did admit that mrs. burkhart would 13:56:05 4 not have gotten copd if she had quit when the '64 surgeon 13:56:09 5 general's report was published. 30 million people quit in 13:56:12 6 the next ten years. she did not try. 13:56:14 7 he admits that if she had quit when the warnings 13:56:18 8 went on the pack, she would not have got copd. 13 million 13:56:22 9 people quit in just the next four years. she did not try. 13:56:25 and this is what dr. burns said, if you can quit 13:56:29 before age 45. he said, if before age 45 you do not already 13:56:34 have abnormal lung function and you quit, then you do not 13:56:38 get copd. 13:56:39 now, mrs. burkhart was born in 1941. i guess 45 13:56:46 would be 1986. but at a minimum that means that if she had 13:56:51 quit in the 1970s, when warnings has been on the packs for 13:56:55 years, if she had quit in the 1970s when her own husband 13:57:00 said, they are going to kill you; if instead of saying, it is 13:57:04 my life and i know that and it is my decision, if she had 13:57:07 quit then, her own expert admits she would have avoided her 13:57:10 injury. 13:57:11 she said herself, it is an individual thing. but 13:57:17 even more important, the surgeon general agrees. 13:57:22 one of the issues -- and mr. heimann emphasized 13:57:24 it -- is substantial. and he went into a lot of detail. 38 13:57:27 1 he gave various definitions for the word substantial. so i 13:57:31 2 think it is fair to say that that is an important issue here. 13:57:35 3 if addiction really was a cause, if you decide she 13:57:37 4 was addicted under some definition, was addiction really a 13:57:41 5 substantial cause? 13:57:55 6 their definition is, you have this chronic 13:57:55 7 relapse. well, what does the surgeon general say? does 13:57:55 8 the surgeon general say that nicotine addiction or nicotine 13:57:55 9 dependency is the -- is a substantial reason in why people 13:57:55 relapse? 13:57:58 here's what the surgeon general says. even in the 13:57:59 best circumstances, tobacco -- the measures of tobacco 13:58:04 dependence account for only a modest amount of variation. 13:58:07 now, i did not pull out as many definitions of the 13:58:12 word substantial as mr. heimann did. 13:58:14 but modest, a modest amount, a modest effect, 13:58:18 that is not substantial. that is a surgeon general's report. 13:58:22 that is the consensus. that is the state of the art, 13:58:25 according to their experts. 13:58:27 nicotine addiction has only a modest effect on 13:58:29 relapse, so she does not even meet her own definition. and 13:58:34 we know she only relapsed once in 36 years and has only a 13:58:38 modest effect. it is not substantial. 13:58:41 and if you need one issue to decide on whether she 13:58:43 was addicted, it is this: the surgeon general does not say 39 13:58:48 1 that nicotine addiction has a substantial effect on whether 13:58:52 2 you relapse. 13:58:53 3 look what the reason is. that is important. 13:58:58 4 surgeon general says, this finding is consistent with the 13:59:01 5 notion that relapse is a function of multiple person 13:59:05 6 factors. surgeon general says it is person factors. 13:59:10 7 mrs. burkhart says it is a personal thing. they are on the 13:59:15 8 same page. 13:59:16 9 now, you have heard the evidence about choice, 13:59:19 control, and responsibility. i do not have to repeat that 13:59:22 it was her choice in '94, the first time she made up her 13:59:26 mind. we know she was able to control. we know their own 13:59:29 experts say that smokers are responsible for making that 13:59:32 decision. 13:59:33 but think about all of the evidence you have seen 13:59:35 about her ability to quit when you answer this question. 13:59:40 if addiction was really the cause of her disease, if 13:59:44 addiction was really forcing her to smoke, okay, then what 13:59:47 happened between august 9, the last day she smoked three 13:59:51 packs a day, three packs a day, and august 10, the day she 13:59:56 quit and never smoked again? 13:59:57 and we know her cigarettes did not change. we know 14:00:00 the cigarette design did not change. we know her nicotine 14:00:03 did not change. nobody suggests her brain changed. 14:00:08 and what changed was her mind. and her mind 40 14:00:11 1 changed because she made a decision, and she made a 14:00:14 2 decision that this time she was going to make a serious 14:00:17 3 commitment to quitting. 14:00:19 4 as i said in opening, ladies and gentlemen, when 14:00:20 5 she changed her mind and made that decision, she changed 14:00:24 6 her life. she went from, it is my life, i'm going to smoke; 14:00:28 7 to, it is my life, i'm going to quit. 14:00:31 8 and in her own words, she quit the first time she 14:00:34 9 made that decision. now, what happened to addiction on 14:00:40 august 10? what happened to the substantial effect that 14:00:44 mr. heimann talks about? 14:00:46 the truth for mrs. burkhart and from what we know 14:00:50 is that when she made that decision, suddenly addiction not 14:00:54 only did not have a substantial effect, it did not have any 14:00:59 effect. 14:00:59 now, does that mean that i'm claiming it was easy 14:01:01 for her to quit? are we saying it was not hard? no, of 14:01:06 course, not. 14:01:07 changing your life, going to work, going to 14:01:10 school, losing weight, starting an exercise program, giving 14:01:13 up smoking, life is hard. but there is no line on your 14:01:18 verdict form that says, was it hard? 14:01:23 the verdict form says, was addiction a legal cause 14:01:26 of her injury? and it was not. because she stopped when 14:01:30 she changed her mind. and once she changed her mind, 41 14:01:33 1 addiction did not have a substantial effect. it had no 14:01:36 2 effect. 14:01:36 3 and for that reason, let us look one more time 14:01:43 4 about whether this choice issue is made up. we know the 14:01:47 5 surgeon general has called cigarette smoking personal 14:01:49 6 choice. you see it right there. 14:01:51 7 look what the surgeon general says about the 14:01:53 8 individual smoker. even though it is addictive, it is up to 14:01:56 9 the individual smoker to decide whether or not to continue 14:02:00 that behavior. 14:02:02 and their expert, dr. burns, says smokers are 14:02:05 responsible for those choices. 14:02:07 this is the most recent surgeon general. and you 14:02:10 saw me ask dr. burns about this. and it compares 14:02:13 secondhand smoke exposure. it says secondhand smoke, if 14:02:17 you are around someone that is smoking, that is not your 14:02:20 choice. that is involuntary. 14:02:21 but look what they talk about for regular smoking. 14:02:25 individual choice. it is secondhand smoke that is 14:02:28 involuntary. 14:02:29 after all the discussions with dr. burns, the 14:02:35 bottom line is he says even an addicted smoker is 14:02:37 responsible for their smoking behavior, and it is up to the 14:02:40 individual smoker to continue smoking or quit. 14:02:44 now, based on all of that evidence, their own 42 14:02:46 1 definition, their own lack of proof, the fact that 14:02:49 2 addiction did not stop her from quitting, that she made only 14:02:52 3 one effort, that she herself says, looking back on, was not 14:02:56 4 serious, you should answer no to the question of addiction 14:03:06 5 and you should answer no to the question of whether 14:03:08 6 addiction was a legal cause, a legal cause of her injury. 14:03:11 7 now, the next part of the verdict form, you are 14:03:13 8 going to see a series of questions on whether mrs. burkhart 14:03:17 9 relied on things that tobacco companies said. there is a 14:03:21 whole series of questions. but they are all the same 14:03:24 question over and over. 14:03:25 did she rely on a statement or an omission from a 14:03:28 tobacco company? did she rely on a statement or an 14:03:31 omission that was the result of an agreement? well, the 14:03:34 evidence here is she did not rely on those statements, and 14:03:37 it comes directly from mr. and mrs. burkhart. 14:03:39 so what you will be doing is looking at questions 2, 14:03:44 has three parts -- or four parts -- and question 3 that has 14:03:48 four parts. all of them are on whether or not she relied 14:03:51 on a statement. 14:03:54 and we had some discussion this morning. one of 14:03:56 the things you will be asked is to decide, did she rely at 14:04:00 all? and if she did, was it a statement that was made 14:04:03 before may 5, 1982, or after? 14:04:06 well, we asked her that. i asked her that on the 43 14:04:11 1 stand. and you saw the videotaped testimony that she 14:04:14 2 did not hear any statement that it was not proven until 14:04:19 3 after -- until after she went to smokenders in 1984. 14:04:23 4 so she had not even heard a statement to rely on 14:04:26 5 until after may 5, 1982. and we know what her response 14:04:32 6 was. who do they think they are kidding? of course it is 14:04:35 7 harmful. i did not believe them at all. 14:04:37 8 now, i mentioned a little while ago that at the 14:04:43 9 very end, mrs. burkhart -- you remember mrs. burkhart 14:04:47 became -- talked a little louder. she was a little more 14:04:53 direct in her answers. and you saw what her very last 14:04:57 answers were. and she said, i did not believe them at all. 14:05:00 and at that point in the cross-examination, we 14:05:03 were talking specifically about the improvements that she 14:05:05 says the tobacco companies promised. 14:05:08 and you saw the testimony. you saw the videotaped 14:05:11 testimony that by the time it was the 1980s she not only 14:05:16 had never even heard a statement that it was not proven -- 14:05:19 she did not believe it when she later heard it -- but by the 14:05:23 time she got to the 1980s, she said she was not believing 14:05:26 that any cigarette was better for her, whether it was 14:05:28 filters or lights. 14:05:30 we are going to talk about the brands she smoked. 14:05:32 but that was her testimony. there is no evidence in this 14:05:37 record that after may 5, 1982, mrs. burkhart heard a 44 14:05:42 1 statement and that she relied on it. 14:05:44 2 and more importantly, as mr. heimann even showed 14:05:47 3 you the instruction, she has to prove -- its her burden to 14:05:53 4 prove that she relied on a statement and that is what caused 14:05:56 5 her injury. 14:05:57 6 well, where is the evidence of that, ladies and 14:05:59 7 gentlemen? what is the statement she relied on after 1983 14:06:03 8 that caused her to get copd? 14:06:06 9 did any expert say, well, if she had not heard a 14:06:09 statement, she would have quit smoking? 14:06:13 even though mrs. burkhart did not say that. i 14:06:14 asked her every time, when you switched brands whether it 14:06:16 was to lights or to filters, were you even thinking of 14:06:20 quitting at that time? she said she was not. and we know 14:06:25 she was not from the evidence. 14:06:26 so mrs. burkhart, there is no evidence that she 14:06:29 relied on a statement by r.j. reynolds, american, brown & 14:06:34 williamson, no evidence she relied on a statement by 14:06:36 lorillard or philip morris. in fact, there is no evidence 14:06:41 she even heard of the industry organizations tirc, the ctr, 14:06:47 the tobacco institute. 14:06:48 they did not even present evidence that she had 14:06:51 ever heard of those organizations before she filed her 14:06:55 lawsuit. and those 1950s blurry videos of, you know, some 14:07:01 of the men or scientists talking about it, there is no 45 14:07:03 1 connection to mrs. burkhart. she says she did not hear 14:07:07 2 anything about it not being proven until 1984. and then 14:07:11 3 she said, who do they think they are kidding? so she did not 14:07:14 4 rely. 14:07:18 5 you know, we have had a lot of talk about 14:07:19 6 advertising. but what is ironic in this case is how many 14:07:23 7 ads, how many ads were you folks shown that she actually 14:07:26 8 saw? is it surprising that in a case where they claim 14:07:30 9 false advertising, they did not present evidence through 14:07:33 their experts of an ad that the plaintiffs actually saw? 14:07:37 you decide that. i asked dr. cummings -- it was 14:07:41 one of my last questions -- dr. cummings, did you show a 14:07:46 single ad for a single brand that mrs. burkhart actually 14:07:49 smoked? 14:07:50 and he said, you know, i did not, like it was not a 14:07:52 big deal. well, it is a big deal, ladies and gentlemen, 14:07:56 because mrs. burkhart has the burden of proof. and so what 14:07:59 they did is show every other ad under the sun for every 14:08:02 other brand. 14:08:02 let us talk about the only advertisement that she 14:08:05 said was appealing to her. and she admitted that two days 14:08:09 ago. the only advertisement that appealed to her was a 14:08:12 virginia slims lady in a business suit. and we know the 14:08:17 slogan, "you have come a long way, baby." she said that 14:08:20 appealed to her. 46 14:08:21 1 well, ladies and gentlemen, that is not fraud. 14:08:23 2 that is not fraud to show an attractive woman in a business 14:08:26 3 suit, in a swimsuit, or anything else. it is not fraud to 14:08:30 4 have a slogan. 14:08:32 5 judge jones told you in the middle of the trial, 14:08:35 6 capitalism is not on trial. advertising is not on trial. 14:08:38 7 and they do not identify anything in that ad that was false 14:08:41 8 or that she believed. 14:08:43 9 we will talk a little more about her brand choices 14:08:45 now. but this was the virginia slims ad. remember, 14:08:50 dr. proctor came in. and we do not dispute this. he sort 14:08:54 of bragged. he said, i have the biggest database of 14:08:57 advertising or cigarette advertising in the world. 14:09:00 well, good for dr. proctor. that is probably 14:09:03 true. and out of the biggest database in the world, from a 14:09:06 man that is been paid $1.5 million to do this over and over 14:09:11 again, how many ads did he pull out that mrs. burkhart even 14:09:15 saw? none. zero. 14:09:21 this is the ad he showed you. and you will remember 14:09:23 that the question was, from miss london, what does the body 14:09:29 language of the woman tell you? 14:09:31 i objected. he is not an expert on women's bodies. 14:09:34 of course he is not. 14:09:35 but there is nothing in this ad, this ad that 14:09:39 mrs. burkhart did not see, that anyone showed was false. 47 14:09:42 1 and remember what they left out? i actually had 14:09:45 2 to request the judge to order them to read it. they left 14:09:50 3 out the box. and the box is pretty important because that 14:09:53 4 advertisement says, the surgeon general has determined that 14:09:57 5 cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health. 14:09:59 6 now, it is not fraud to have an attractive woman. 14:10:04 7 we would not expect someone to advertise their products with 14:10:07 8 unattractive models. it is not the american way. it is not 14:10:11 9 fraud to have a brightly colored dress on. and it is not 14:10:14 fraud to have a slogan of "you have come a long way, baby." 14:10:19 so the only ad that their expert actually showed 14:10:21 is something she did not see that has the warning on it that 14:10:24 congress determined is appropriate, that congress 14:10:27 determined is legal to put in the ad. 14:10:31 well, when she started, we know it was not ads. 14:10:36 she told me she never even saw a pall mall ad. she smoked 14:10:40 because of her mom. 14:10:40 she told us when she switched to filters that it 14:10:43 was to keep tobacco out of her teeth. now, it was back in 14:10:46 the early '60s, ladies and gentlemen. she could not have 14:10:49 been more direct. it was not ladylike. you did not want to 14:10:52 have tobacco in your teeth, and that is why she switched to 14:10:56 pall mall filters. 14:10:57 it had nothing to do with health. now, i know she 14:11:00 claims later and her lawyer claims later it had to do with 48 14:11:02 1 health. but we will get there. 14:11:04 2 then she switched to raleighs. raleighs had 14:11:07 3 coupons. legal to have coupons. capitalism is not on 14:11:11 4 trial. no one is claiming that having a coupon is fraud. 14:11:14 5 so she switched to kents. mr. heimann says, well, 14:11:20 6 kents was fraudulent. we asked her very specifically, you 14:11:24 7 did not switch for health reasons. she denied it. i played 14:11:27 8 the videotape. 14:11:29 9 you saw the one-sentence question, one-sentence 14:11:31 answer. and on videotape, just two days ago, she said she 14:11:34 did not switch for health reasons. 14:11:37 then she talked about the filter. she was asked 14:11:39 specifically, you did not think kents were safer? we 14:11:43 rolled the videotape. she said she did not think kents were 14:11:48 safer. that is her direct testimony. it is not a tobacco 14:11:52 company document or an executive. her direct testimony, 14:11:55 she did not think kents were safer. 14:11:58 that is why we brought the videotape, because 14:12:01 sometimes witnesses change their stories at trial. and in 14:12:04 this case, unfortunately, that is what happened with mr. and 14:12:09 mrs. burkhart. 14:12:09 so you saw the videotape. now, she agreed with me 14:12:13 right off the bat. she was not trying to quit. this was not 14:12:15 a question, as mr. heimann suggested, i'm desperate to 14:12:21 quit. throw me a lifeline of a filter. she said she 49 14:12:24 1 was not interested in quitting. she said she was looking to 14:12:27 2 a filter for taste. 14:12:28 3 and when we asked her, when you say you thought 14:12:31 4 the filter was better, is not it true that the most you 14:12:33 5 thought the filter would be better at would make it better 14:12:36 6 tasting? 14:12:38 7 she agreed. and i had to play the videotape again 14:12:41 8 that said just that, the most she thought the filter would 14:12:44 9 do was make it taste better. 14:12:47 and then we asked her, well, did kents taste 14:12:51 better? and she said they did. now, there is no evidence 14:12:54 that any kent ad caused her to develop copd. there is no 14:13:01 evidence that if kent went off the market, she would have 14:13:03 quit smoking. 14:13:04 there is no evidence that anything that you would 14:13:06 have said to her at that point would have caused her to 14:13:08 quit. she had the surgeon general's warning in her hand, 14:13:13 and she never quit. 14:13:14 virginia slims, she told us she switched for taste 14:13:18 because she was sick of menthols, hated menthols at that 14:13:22 point. said that the very first brand -- she did not shop 14:13:25 around. the very first brand she went to was virginia 14:13:29 slims. and she agreed, they tasted heavenly. that is her 14:13:32 words, not mine. they tasted heavenly. and we heard what 14:13:36 she said about the slogan and the woman in a business suit. 50 14:13:39 1 that is not fraud. 14:13:40 2 what we did ask her is, did you switch for lower 14:13:43 3 tar? she said she did not. what we did ask her is that 14:13:47 4 the warning, at the time she switched, whether it was the 14:13:49 5 '80s, early '80s, late '80s, whatever it was, every 14:13:54 6 single advertisement in america had to have the surgeon 14:13:58 7 general's warning. that is not fraud. 14:14:01 8 congress determined it was legal to advertise with 14:14:03 9 that warning. and she saw those warnings. so there was not 14:14:09 any fraud. 14:14:14 now, i put up this instruction because the same 14:14:16 definition of legal cause that applies to addiction has to 14:14:19 apply here to reliance. 14:14:21 they have to show that not only did a tobacco 14:14:24 company say something that was false, that not only did 14:14:29 mrs. burkhart actually see it, that not only did she 14:14:33 actually change her behavior, meaning decide to continue 14:14:36 rather than quitting, but then prove that that would have 14:14:40 caused her injury. 14:14:41 and they do not have any of that proof. it is just 14:14:45 speculation. mr. heimann says, well, she would have quit. 14:14:48 but we know what she did when she got direct warnings. 14:14:53 forget whether she thought a filter was safer. 14:14:55 her husband said, the cigarettes you are smoking right there 14:14:58 that had filters and were lights, they will kill you. that 51 14:15:02 1 did not have an effect on her. that did not cause her to 14:15:04 2 change her mind. 14:15:05 3 there is no evidence that some sort of concealment 14:15:08 4 or statement caused her injury. and her own words, the 14:15:13 5 very last part of her deposition when i said, we do not need 14:15:17 6 any more questions or answers, she said i did not believe 14:15:19 7 them at all. 14:15:23 8 so when you go to question 2-a and 2-b and 2-c, 14:15:30 9 the answer is they have not met their burden of proof. 14:15:34 there is not any proof. the answer is, no, she did not 14:15:37 rely. the answer is, no, reliance was not a legal cause 14:15:41 because there is no reliance. 14:15:42 question 2-d, did she rely on anything before or 14:15:50 after may 5, 1982? there is no evidence she relied on 14:15:53 anything. 14:15:55 the evidence is that she said the first time she 14:15:57 heard someone say it is not proven was after 1984 she did not 14:16:01 believe it. she said, who are they kidding? 14:16:04 and so based on the evidence, you should answer no 14:16:11 for all of those questions. 14:16:12 and i think here the judge instructs you to select 14:16:16 all that apply. well, none of them apply. there is no 14:16:18 evidence that she relied on concealment, either before '82 14:16:22 and certainly no evidence, ladies and gentlemen, after 1982 14:16:26 when she says in her own words, i did not believe them at 52 14:16:29 1 all. who were they kidding? 14:16:31 2 question 3-a, did she rely to her detriment? we 14:16:37 3 know she did not. same question. you should answer no 14:16:41 4 based on the evidence. 3-b, was reliance a legal cause? 14:16:45 5 it does not exist. the answer is no. and the same for 3-c 14:16:49 6 and 3-d. 14:16:55 7 there is no evidence she relied. and what the 14:16:57 8 evidence is we do not have to speculate because what 14:16:59 9 mr. heimann is suggesting, imagine if she heard something 14:17:03 else. we do not have to speculate because we know what she 14:17:06 heard. and what she heard was a warning that it could kill 14:17:10 her from the man she loved most. and we know that did not 14:17:12 change her behavior. there is no evidence anything a 14:17:18 tobacco company could have said that would have changed it. 14:17:20 she told us herself, you cannot tell a smoker to 14:17:24 quit, she said, because it is a personal thing. 14:17:27 now, there is a question here of comparative fault. 14:17:30 what i want to remind you is that right off the bat, 14:17:33 mr. heimann said, well, we do agree, partially at fault, 14:17:37 partial cause of her own injury. he emphasizes that it is 14:17:41 partial. 14:17:42 but let us think about what that means, that the 14:17:44 plaintiff admits that her own actions are a partial cause 14:17:47 of her injury. well, that has to admit -- that has to mean 14:17:53 that she had the ability to quit smoking. well, we know 53 14:17:55 1 she did. but that has to mean, how could she cause her own 14:17:59 2 injury, even partially, if she did not have the ability? 14:18:01 3 it would not be admitting that, ladies and 14:18:03 4 gentlemen. they would not be admitting any fault at all if 14:18:06 5 she could not quit. so they are admitting that she had the 14:18:09 6 ability to quit. 14:18:10 7 and they have to be admitting that she had the 14:18:14 8 ability to quit at a time that she could have avoided her 14:18:19 9 injury because if it was too late to quit, well, it 14:18:21 would not be a cause of her injury, and they would not admit 14:18:24 that. so they are very upfront. she doused her own 14:18:27 injury. they say it is only in part. but the evidence is, 14:18:31 based on their own admission, that she did cause her own 14:18:34 injury. 14:18:34 now, you have seen the form. and you have been given 14:18:40 the instructions. what i want to talk about is the 14:18:43 evidence that goes to the issue of whether her choices were 14:18:46 the causes. 14:18:48 well, she started because her mother smoked. that 14:18:51 had nothing to do with the tobacco company. we know 14:18:53 nothing the company said caused her to start. we know she 14:18:56 was a regular smoker as an adult. she was not a little kid. 14:19:00 all of these things about youth advertising, she smoked her 14:19:04 senior year of high school. and she says it was not because 14:19:06 of advertising. she did not even start inhaling and become 54 14:19:09 1 a regular smoker until she was an adult. 14:19:12 2 so this claim that youth advertising are in, it 14:19:17 3 does not apply to this case. i mean, they did not present a 14:19:20 4 shred of evidence that in 1958 there was an ad directed to 14:19:24 5 youth that she even saw it. she was very, very candid. 14:19:28 6 advertising did not cause her to smoke. 14:19:30 7 well, we know that she saw her father and mother 14:19:34 8 have the same type of discussions that she had with her own 14:19:37 9 husband. she saw the warnings to her mom. we know in the 14:19:40 '50s she made no effort to quit even though the media was 14:19:43 reporting risks. 14:19:45 we know she read the papers. she saw this 14:19:47 information. her own husband says that. we know they 14:19:50 watched the tv news. we know -- heard about the surgeon 14:19:56 general's report. according to dr. burns, basically, 14:19:58 everyone did. it was front-page news. it was the top 14:20:02 story. 14:20:02 we know she saw the warning. and we know that she 14:20:05 made no response. 1966, her own expert admits she could 14:20:09 have quit smoking then. she was warned. we know even in 14:20:14 the '60s she was aware of nicotine. those are her words. 14:20:17 they are not mine. 14:20:18 we know that she believed that she was addicted, 14:20:21 so addiction was not concealed from her. we know she 14:20:25 believed that 50 years ago in the 1960s. 55 14:20:28 1 we know she made no effort to quit in the '60s, 14:20:31 2 despite her knowledge, despite the warning that was on 14:20:33 3 every pack that she held in her hand. we know in the '70s 14:20:37 4 she saw the warning. she admitted that. 14:20:40 5 we know in the '70s, '74 to '75, her husband 14:20:45 6 basically told her, smoking is dangerous, harm your 14:20:48 7 breathing, and it could kill you. did she try to quit in 14:20:53 8 the 1970s? no, she did not. not at all. 14:20:56 9 we know that this warning was on the pack. she 14:21:01 says that she just did not see it. and i asked her because 14:21:06 i have a legal obligation. i have to ask some hard 14:21:10 questions, no matter how sick mrs. burkhart is. she 14:21:14 understood that i had to have her answer a question. you 14:21:17 know that both she and her husband are experienced 14:21:20 witnesses in litigation. they have both testified in five or 14:21:22 ten lawsuits before, at depositions. 14:21:25 you know, when i asked her, you know, how is it 14:21:27 that you could see the warning for the last 20 years, the 14:21:31 '66 warning, the '70 warning, all through the '70s, and 14:21:36 then when the warning says emphysema, suddenly she did not 14:21:40 see it. and we heard about, well, the type is small. she 14:21:42 did not look at it. and you will have to decide whether that 14:21:45 was credible. and miss gallagher will talk a little more 14:21:48 about that. 14:21:48 but we know her answer to the risks of smoking 56 14:21:52 1 far, far back was that she knew it. we knew that in her 14:21:56 2 own words she said that it could kill her. we know that 14:21:59 3 her husband in the '70s used these terms to say she was 14:22:02 4 killing herself. we know she saw these public service 14:22:05 5 announcements. 14:22:08 6 we know when they had their verbal fights about 14:22:12 7 smoking, that her response was, even though it could kill 14:22:14 8 her, it is my life and i'll make my own decisions. and we 14:22:17 9 know, according to her husband in her own words, she said 14:22:21 that cigarettes could kill her. we know for decades she 14:22:24 had a smoker's cough. 14:22:28 we know that even though she went to smokenders, 14:22:30 she smoked one day after three weeks. did she smoke a pack 14:22:37 that day and then go back to quitting? did she smoke two 14:22:41 packs that day and go back to an effort to quit? 14:22:43 no. she never went back to smokeenders. she 14:22:46 never stopped again until 1980 -- until 1994, and then she 14:22:50 quit for good because she said when she really made her 14:22:54 mind up, when she really got it into her head. 14:22:57 and so the response of the plaintiffs is, blame it 14:23:03 on the issues that were decided in engle. blame it on the 14:23:07 statements that she did not hear. blame it on the 14:23:09 statements that she did not believe. she did not believe 14:23:12 them at all when she heard them. 14:23:14 and, ladies and gentlemen, you will decide. but 57 14:23:19 1 based on that evidence, based on that evidence, 14:23:22 2 mrs. burkhart chose to smoke. and we know from her own 14:23:25 3 expert that smokers are responsible for their decisions, 14:23:28 4 and we know from the facts that she was the only person who 14:23:31 5 could decide. she said you do not even tell a smoker not to 14:23:36 6 smoke. it is a personal decision. 14:23:38 7 there was not someone in an office at a tobacco 14:23:41 8 company that could take the cigarette out of her mouth. 14:23:44 9 there was not someone at a tobacco company that could make 14:23:47 the decision for her. and when she did make up her mind, 14:23:50 she quit, and she was responsible. 14:23:56 now, i want to talk briefly about the issue of 14:23:59 may 5, 1990. you know that one of the things the law 14:24:03 requires you to decide is whether or not mrs. burkhart knew 14:24:06 or should have known of her injuries before may 5, 1990. 14:24:11 i'm going to go through the evidence pretty 14:24:13 specifically. but i want to emphasize what judge jones 14:24:16 instructed you -- and you will have it in writing. the 14:24:21 question is not whether mrs. burkhart knew she had copd. 14:24:25 it is knew or should have known. and it will say that 14:24:29 should have known means exercising reasonable care. and 14:24:33 you will use your own common sense. but the question is not, 14:24:35 you do not get to say, well, i did not know the name of the 14:24:38 disease or i did not actually know i had it. the 14:24:41 instruction on the verdict form, knew or should have known. 58 14:24:46 1 now, let us look what you saw, and you will decide. 14:24:49 2 i think this is question -- this is going to be question 5. 14:24:55 3 i want to say one other thing on the verdict form 14:24:57 4 before you. you know that question 4 is going to ask 14:25:03 5 whether each -- plaintiff's smoking of each defendant's 14:25:05 6 cigarette was a legal cause of her injury. and that is 14:25:08 7 their burden of proof. you will decide that issue. 14:25:10 8 when we get to question 5, the statute of 14:25:13 9 limitations, this is the type of evidence that we know is 14:25:15 true because all the experts agree. everyone agrees that 14:25:19 copd is progressive. it takes time. it takes a lot of 14:25:23 time to reach a severe stage. it takes years. 14:25:27 dr. burns agreed to that when i asked him on 14:25:30 video, and certainly dr. cosmo agreed. 14:25:33 we know that she had copd symptoms. and one of 14:25:36 the things i want to emphasize is that both sides' experts 14:25:40 agreed. dr. burns agreed that there are symptoms of copd 14:25:45 that include chronic cough and that include shortness of 14:25:49 breath. he agreed she had those symptoms. he agreed it 14:25:53 was reasonable to assume. he said, well, we do not know for 14:25:56 sure, but he said it was reasonable to assume. 14:25:58 well, since dr. burns has not spent much time 14:26:01 seeing patients at all for the last 25 years, we brought in 14:26:05 the expert who sees thousands of patients a year. and that 14:26:08 was dr. cosmo, who is been a board-certified pulmonologist 59 14:26:13 1 for 28 years. he sees, he said, about 800 patients a 14:26:18 2 month. 14:26:18 3 we know she was aware of the symptoms. the 14:26:23 4 symptoms, they were not secret. it was not like tumors in 14:26:26 5 your symptom. none of us would know. 14:26:28 6 the symptoms that she knew about were open and 14:26:31 7 obvious. they were complaints that she had. she woke up 14:26:36 8 in the morning in the early '80s unable to breathe because 14:26:39 9 her coughing was so severe. she had tightness of the 14:26:42 chest. she had shortness of breath in the early '80s. 14:26:45 remember her husband says when they are living in houston, 14:26:48 she starts exhibiting shortness of breath, especially when 14:26:51 they travel. and he says that she attributed it to 14:26:55 smoking. 14:26:56 so these symptoms are things she knew. we do not 14:26:58 even have to guess, should she have known? we know she 14:27:01 knew them, and we know she had these symptoms before may 5, 14:27:05 1990, because that is what she says and that is what her own 14:27:08 husband says, and that is what the experts say who looked at 14:27:13 the testimony. no question she blamed those symptoms on 14:27:16 her smoking. 14:27:18 now, mrs. burkhart, on the stand, agreed she had a 14:27:21 smoker's cough in the '70s when she met her husband. she 14:27:24 said by the late '70s or the early '80s she linked it to 14:27:29 her smoking. she thought smoking was causing a cough that 60 14:27:32 1 dr. cosmo says was progressively getting worse and was not 14:27:36 2 just a simple smoker's cough but was the kind of cough that 14:27:39 3 was a symptom of copd. 14:27:42 4 and by the early '80s, there were times she 14:27:45 5 could not even breathe in the morning. and that is the 14:27:56 6 reason i asked dr. burns, were not these symptoms of copd? 14:27:56 7 now, you might expect well, he is on the plaintiff's side, 14:27:56 8 that he would say, heck, no. no way. but what he did say is 14:27:59 9 the opposite. he said, well, it is reasonable to assume 14:28:02 that they were symptoms of copd. 14:28:04 so there is not a lot of daylight between the 14:28:07 experts on these issues, between dr. burns and between 14:28:11 dr. cosmo. those are symptoms of copd. she knew she had 14:28:15 them. and there is no question she had them before 1990. 14:28:20 well, did she know she was addicted? well, 14:28:23 mr. heimann admitted that she was. she told me that she 14:28:26 believed then that she was addicted in the '60s. there is 14:28:30 not going to be any question about whether she was aware or 14:28:32 believed that. 14:28:33 now, no one questions dr. cosmo's credentials. i 14:28:38 mean, i guess miss london said, well, you do not write 14:28:42 surgeon general's reports. well, you know, in this case, 14:28:44 that is a good thing because we want a doctor who has seen 14:28:48 thousands of patients and not a man who writes articles. 14:28:50 dr. cosmo, you heard, in 14 years of reviewing 61 14:28:54 1 medical records, he is made about $80,000. 14 years, 14:28:57 2 $80,000. that is about $5,000 a year. 14:29:00 3 dr. burns has pulled down almost $4 million. and 14:29:05 4 you heard he is worked for 25 cases with these lawyers with 14:29:08 5 the law firm. every time he takes the stand for these 14:29:12 6 lawyers, he says the smoker was addicted. every time he 14:29:15 7 takes the stand for these lawyers, he says addiction was 14:29:18 8 the cause. 14:29:18 9 dr. cosmo never, ever, ever testified for a 14:29:25 tobacco company before. he is not someone whose opinions, 14:29:29 you know, are the result of millions of dollars. 14:29:32 no one disputes his credentials. and no one 14:29:38 disputes this piece of evidence. and the reason no one 14:29:40 disputes this is because this is objective. it is a 14:29:42 scientific medical test that measures a person's lung 14:29:46 function. 14:29:46 and then they take what your lung function is, 14:29:50 what you measure, against what the predicted value is 14:29:53 supposed to be for a person your age. 14:29:56 and i'd like to direct your attention to the 34. 14:30:01 and dr. cosmo explained that that means at that point that 14:30:06 her lung function, mrs. burkhart's lung function in 1993, 14:30:10 was only 34 percent of the predicted value. 14:30:14 and he said that is very severe. very severe. 80 14:30:19 percent is mild copd. eighty percent. 62 14:30:23 1 he then explained that to get from eighty percent, 14:30:26 2 mild copd, all the way down to 34 percent, severe copd, it 14:30:32 3 takes a long time. because you only lose 3 percent a year, 14:30:36 4 4 percent a year. he said maximum, 5 percent a year. 14:30:40 5 so if copd is at eighty percent, that is mild copd, and 14:30:47 6 she was all the way down to 34 -- you lose 3, 4, 5 percent 14:30:51 7 a year as he explained -- that is over a decade that she had 14:30:54 8 copd. 14:30:55 9 so there is no question that her copd, it did not 14:30:59 start in 1993. and it did not start in 1990. as dr. cosmo 14:31:04 said, it could have started as early as the mid-1980s. and 14:31:09 that is just simple math. 14:31:10 no one disputed the pulmonary function test. i'm 14:31:14 not sure that dr. burns even talked about this issue. no 14:31:17 one disputed that you only lose a certain amount of lung 14:31:20 volume a year. 14:31:22 and that is why it was so important when dr. burns 14:31:25 told me, yeah, it is reasonable to assume she had those 14:31:28 symptoms. 14:31:29 dr. cosmo was asked, look, is there any way, is 14:31:34 there some unusual circumstance, anything in her background 14:31:37 where she could have not had copd by may 5, 1990, and it 14:31:43 just developed in only a couple of years? 14:31:46 and he said no. it is impossible. it is 14:31:47 impossible. and he was not challenged on that. 63 14:31:51 1 miss london did not challenge that when she 14:31:54 2 cross-examined him. that is undisputed. 14:31:56 3 so when you answer the question on statute of 14:32:03 4 limitations, did she know or should she have known of her 14:32:07 5 symptoms, did she know or should she have known that she 14:32:11 6 was addicted and that it was linked? well, in her own 14:32:15 7 words she did know. she believed she was addicted. she 14:32:17 8 knew she had all of these symptoms. she knew she did. 14:32:20 9 and there is no question, this is not something 14:32:22 where you have to -- where anyone has to make up the 14:32:25 evidence. she believed she was addicted in the '60s. 14:32:29 she believed that -- she knew she had these symptoms in the 14:32:32 '70s and '80s. she said she believed they were related to 14:32:36 smoking. and as dr. cosmo says, it is impossible that she 14:32:39 did not have copd. 14:32:41 that is the burden of proof, ladies and gentlemen. 14:32:42 and we submit, we have met it. and maybe that is why 14:32:48 dr. burns told me, well, it is reasonable to assume that i'm 14:32:51 right, that she had those symptoms of copd. 14:32:53 i'm not sure what to say about what mr. heimann 14:32:58 said about damages. he did not give you a single basis, a 14:33:03 single basis for his number. he did not tell you why he 14:33:07 came up with it. he did not tell you how he calculated it. 14:33:11 what he said was, he thinks if you have a broken 14:33:14 ankle, you get $10,000. i do not know, ladies and 64 14:33:16 1 gentlemen. that is not this case. 14:33:18 2 he said if you have a crushed leg, maybe you get a 14:33:21 3 couple hundred thousand. i do not know where he is getting 14:33:23 4 that. 14:33:24 5 but the bottom line is, there is not any specific 14:33:27 6 evidence that suggests that the number that he got was 14:33:31 7 anything other than a plaintiffs's lawyer who pulled that 14:33:36 8 number out of the air. 14:33:37 9 he did not give you any rationale for that. he 14:33:42 said -- you know, at first he started saying, well, i cannot 14:33:44 come up with a number. and i thought, oh, he is going to 14:33:47 leave it up to the jurors. but sure enough, he came up 14:33:50 with a number. what he did not do was provide any basis and 14:33:53 any rationale for it. 14:33:55 now, i think under the evidence -- and we have 14:33:57 talked about that -- that you should not be even reaching 14:34:01 that portion of the verdict form. because the evidence is 14:34:05 clear that addiction was not the cause of her injury, that 14:34:09 her choice to smoke was. and that we know her choice to 14:34:12 smoke was something she exercised, despite and regardless 14:34:16 of addiction. 14:34:17 and that when she stopped, she could quit, even if 14:34:20 you call her addicted. so i do not think you are getting 14:34:23 there. but he did not provide any rationale for that 14:34:26 number. 65 14:34:27 1 i think they knew it was shocking, right? 14:34:29 2 remember when miss london said, we are going to give you a 14:34:34 3 number and you are going to find it shocking. they did not 14:34:36 4 give any explanation of why that number, $15 million, is 14:34:40 5 justified. 14:34:41 6 and i'll ask you to think that there is 60 million 14:34:45 7 people who quit smoking. one of them is mrs. burkhart. we 14:34:47 8 know that tens of millions of people were quitting smoking 14:34:50 9 in the '60s and '70s, when her own expert says she could 14:34:54 have avoided her injury. 14:34:55 and they do not prevent -- or present any evidence 14:34:58 that she was different than the 60 million people who quit. 14:35:01 but what they say is because she chose to smoke until '94, 14:35:08 that when she gets a disease, they say now she gets $15 14:35:12 million, even though 60 million people quit and tens of 14:35:18 millions quit when she was being warned. 14:35:20 you decide if that makes sense under the facts of 14:35:22 this case, not what some engle jury who never even heard of 14:35:27 mrs. burkhart thought. 14:35:28 now, finally, he argues they are entitled to 14:35:33 punitive damages. the judge's instructions say punitive 14:35:36 damages are for the purposes of punishment and deterrence. 14:35:39 and i'm going to talk a little about those. 14:35:40 that is going to be the final question on the 14:35:44 verdict form. you have to find by clear and convincing 66 14:35:47 1 evidence that punitive damages are warranted against each 14:35:50 2 defendant. 14:35:53 3 now, mr. heimann himself said that the issue of 14:35:56 4 compensatory damages means that once -- if you reach it, 14:35:59 5 and i do not think -- i do not think you should be reaching 14:36:02 6 it. but if you reach, with all respect, ladies and 14:36:04 7 gentlemen, this question, compensatory damages are designed 14:36:08 8 to fully compensate the person. 14:36:10 9 and mr. heimann read the instructions, full and 14:36:13 just compensation. 14:36:16 so once you get to punitives, you would have 14:36:18 already decided that she is fully compensated. punitives 14:36:21 are extra money. and it is extra money that is going to go, 14:36:25 if awarded, only to mrs. burkhart. not to a charity or for 14:36:30 people who quit smoking. this is her claim for additional 14:36:32 money. 14:36:38 you have to find that the defendants actually had 14:36:40 actual knowledge of the wrongfulness of their conduct. and 14:36:43 they intentionally pursued that conduct and that resulted 14:36:47 in the plaintiff's injuries. 14:36:48 now, mr. heimann suggested that one of the reasons 14:36:51 that you should award punitives is because they sold 14:36:53 cigarettes even though cigarettes were dangerous. and 14:36:57 that is why i reminded you that congress decided you can 14:37:01 sell cigarettes, even if they are dangerous, with the 67 14:37:03 1 warning on the pack. 14:37:05 2 mr. heimann: again, i object to this. 14:37:06 3 the court: i'm going to have to sustain that one. 14:37:08 4 i just remind the jury, i told you that the sale 14:37:11 5 and/or advertising was legal. but that does not absolve 14:37:17 6 the tobacco companies from potential liabilities under the 14:37:20 7 standards i've given you. 14:37:21 8 this is not a claim, i'll repeat again, under 14:37:26 9 mislabeling. they have not made that claim. this is a claim 14:37:29 on the fraudulent issues for withholding information, 14:37:33 concealing information that they were aware of, and on 14:37:37 negligence for selling a defective and dangerous product. 14:37:42 that is the claim. it has nothing to do with mislabeling. 14:37:47 go ahead. i'm sorry. 14:37:49 mr. belasic: now, mr. heimann says, well, you 14:37:51 know, they kept the dangers secret so she gets extra money. 14:37:55 you know, he did not mention any figure, and so we 14:37:59 do not know, but what we do know is that the information on 14:38:02 the dangers of smoking were not a secret. what they are 14:38:05 actually saying is the tobacco companies did not agree at a 14:38:09 certain moment in time. we know they were not secret. 14:38:12 i mean, we had this battle, who could put up the 14:38:15 most evidence of historical knowledge and information? and 14:38:18 i will not belabor this. but one of the things is we ran out 14:38:22 of room on the board because it only went back to the 68 14:38:25 1 1940s. 14:38:26 2 and the florida department of health was saying 14:38:28 3 100 years ago that you could call nicotine addictive. as 14:38:34 4 far back as the 1920s -- 14:38:35 5 mr. heimann: i'm going to object. this is 14:38:37 6 challenging the engle findings. the engle findings are 14:38:39 7 they concealed information that was not known or knowable. 14:38:42 8 that is the finding. he cannot challenge that now. 14:38:44 9 the court: he can. i'll just simply partially 14:38:47 sustain. but i'll have to overrule the objection as to his 14:38:52 argument. 14:38:52 he has the right to argue that punitive damages 14:38:54 are not warranted because there is no need to deter or 14:39:02 punish the conduct. 14:39:03 mr. belasic: and, ladies and gentlemen, if you 14:39:04 look in your instructions, you will see a specific written 14:39:06 instruction from judge jones that says punitive damages 14:39:09 cannot be based on the engle findings. 14:39:12 this is a question of mrs. burkhart. 14:39:13 the court: solely on the engle findings. it is 14:39:16 not enough to find warranted damages, punitive damages 14:39:22 solely based upon application of the engle finding. 14:39:25 mr. belasic: all right. so there is no dispute 14:39:27 that as far back as the 1920s they were talking about 14:39:31 smoking causing cancer. 69 14:39:32 1 i'll just give you a few examples. just click 14:39:34 2 through. 100 years ago, our state government was saying it 14:39:37 3 was addictive. it is not a secret. 14:39:40 4 dr. proctor admitted 70 years ago, the year she 14:39:43 5 was -- the year mrs. burkhart was born, a "reader's digest" 14:39:46 6 was saying that nicotine was the reason people smoked. 14:39:48 7 they compared it to other drugs. 14:39:51 8 we know that -- you saw this claude teague 14:39:57 9 document from the '50s from reynolds. 14:39:59 "reader's digest" was saying the same thing in 14:40:00 1924. we know in the 1950s they were talking about cancer 14:40:04 by the carton. dr. proctor himself said this magazine that 14:40:09 came out years before mrs. burkhart smoked talked about 14:40:12 cancer. 14:40:13 we know that the first document, the very first 14:40:15 document they used with their experts from 1935, not only 14:40:20 was it a secret, but, ladies and gentlemen, i had to wait 14:40:24 five or six hours to finally get up there and say, hey, 14:40:28 that was something that was sent to doctors. it was not a 14:40:30 secret at all. 14:40:31 we know in 1942 they were publishing that if you 14:40:33 looked at it one way, a cigarette could be a means of 14:40:37 administering nicotine. that was not a secret. 14:40:39 even "reader's digest" was saying nicotine is the 14:40:41 essential ingredient. and remember -- 70 14:40:44 1 the court: i think i have to re-emphasize, he 14:40:46 2 cannot challenge the engle findings. he cannot do that, 14:40:49 3 say the engle findings are not true in this case. cannot do 14:40:53 4 that. the engle findings were to the effect that there was 14:40:59 5 fraud and that there was negligence. 14:41:03 6 what he can do, however, is to say that in this 14:41:07 7 case, punitive damages are not warranted under the standard 14:41:11 8 i've given you in the legal instructions. 14:41:14 9 so just that caution. i'm not going to stop his 14:41:17 argument here. i just remind you, as a matter of law, he 14:41:20 cannot challenge the engle findings. 14:41:22 mr. belasic: and so there is no question, ladies 14:41:24 and gentlemen, that is exactly what i am arguing. 14:41:28 mrs. burkhart, her lawyer says she wants 10 or $15 million 14:41:32 for choosing to smoke, and choosing to quit in 1994, 14:41:36 because she got sick. 14:41:37 now she says, and he says, that she wants 14:41:40 additional money. punitive damages are not warranted under 14:41:44 these facts. 14:41:46 so let us talk about whether or not it was 14:41:50 concealed and what the experts said. 14:41:52 we know this is the evidence. 14:41:55 mr. heimann: objection. 14:41:55 the court: i'm going to sustain the objection, 14:41:57 sir. you cannot challenge the engle findings that there 71 14:42:00 1 was misstatement or not misstatement. 14:42:03 2 mr. belasic: all right. may i present the 14:42:04 3 evidence that dr. burns presented? 14:42:07 4 the court: no. 14:42:07 5 mr. belasic: all right. 14:42:08 6 now, one of the things we know is that 14:42:16 7 mrs. burkhart said that when she saw the statements, she 14:42:21 8 did not rely. that she said she saw them in the '80s, and 14:42:26 9 she said, who are they kidding? and we know from 14:42:28 dr. proctor that was not unusual. the question of reliance 14:42:31 here is an individual question. 14:42:33 and dr. proctor says for the last 50 years, only 3 14:42:37 to 5 percent of people ever said the tobacco companies were 14:42:40 reliable. 14:42:40 and mrs. burkhart was not one of them. because 14:42:43 we have reviewed the evidence. she did not believe -- when 14:42:46 she finally heard some statements in the '80s, she said, 14:42:49 who are they kidding? 14:42:50 and she did not think her cigarettes were safer. 14:42:53 and she certainly did not refuse to quit because of some 14:42:56 advertisement. 14:42:56 now, they brought up dr. cummings to show some 14:43:02 research documents. and i emphasize research, because the 14:43:05 documents that he showed you about cigarette design were not 14:43:09 about actual cigarettes for the actual brands that 72 14:43:13 1 mrs. burkhart smoked. 14:43:14 2 he was very careful to show research documents 14:43:18 3 about what researchers were looking at. 14:43:21 4 and he said, well, the ph of cigarettes can effect 14:43:25 5 it. 14:43:25 6 what he did not tell you was that the reynolds' 14:43:31 7 document, one of the 60 million documents, and one 14:43:33 8 apparently he did not review, says there is no evidence from 14:43:36 9 the historical data, going all the way out to 1996 after 14:43:41 mrs. burkhart quit, there is no evidence from this data that 14:43:42 smoke ph was purposefully increased to enhance sales. if 14:43:47 you look at the sentence before, what happened is, there is 14:43:50 no correlation between sales and ph. 14:43:54 and when i asked dr. cummings, do you even know 14:43:57 the ph level of any brand that mrs. burkhart smoked? he 14:44:02 said no. 14:44:03 he had not looked at this data. look at this. 14:44:07 r.j. reynolds comparing sales and ph values. well, the ph 14:44:10 is the top line. it goes up. it goes down. it goes up. 14:44:13 it goes down. 14:44:15 dr. cummings said, it varies from year to year, 14:44:17 that even agriculture variations -- hot year, dry year -- 14:44:21 ph is going to change. 14:44:23 but look at the bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, 14:44:26 every year, down, down, down, down, down. 73 14:44:28 1 dr. cummings' assertion, based on a handful of 14:44:33 2 cherrypicked documents from the '70s, that there was some 14:44:36 3 connection between ph and sales, he did not look at the 14:44:38 4 data. and he did not -- he admitted he did not look at 14:44:41 5 anything for an actual cigarette that mrs. burkhart smoked. 14:44:45 6 now, did the cigarette companies design cigarettes 14:44:51 7 to be more addictive? were mrs. burkhart's cigarettes more 14:44:55 8 addictive than they were in the old days? 14:44:58 9 dr. cummings said, and his conclusion, his own 14:45:00 studies, roll-your-own cigarettes -- you buy tobacco and 14:45:04 you roll your own -- those are more addictive. 14:45:06 the people who smoke roll-your-owns are more 14:45:08 addicted than the people who smoke the kents and the 14:45:12 marlboros and the winstons and the virginia slims and the 14:45:15 kools. he says that the people who smoke roll-your-owns 14:45:18 are less interested in quitting. 14:45:20 and that is their expert, ladies and gentlemen. 14:45:24 i asked dr. cummings, is not it true that the 14:45:27 surgeon general knew about all of these design changes and 14:45:30 reviewed them in a report. so the 1979 surgeon general's 14:45:35 report is in evidence. the 1979 surgeon general's 14:45:38 report -- look, if you would, ladies and gentlemen, along 14:45:41 the left side, under tobacco processing. 14:45:44 you see reconstituted tobacco sheet. he talked 14:45:47 about that. look what the effect on tar and nicotine is. 74 14:45:51 1 it is a plus. 14:45:52 2 well, in this case, plus is good. at the bottom, 14:45:56 3 where i've highlighted, it tells you what plus means. it 14:46:00 4 says reductions. not increases. reductions. 14:46:03 5 two pluses means a fifty percent or greater 14:46:07 6 reduction. a one plus means a significant reduction. 14:46:11 7 surgeon general knew about this, researched it, 14:46:14 8 published it. it was not secret. and the surgeon general's 14:46:18 9 conclusion was that reconstituted tobacco sheet gets a 14:46:22 star, they get a plus, because it reduces nicotine, it 14:46:26 reduces tar. 14:46:27 and look what the other column i highlighted says. 14:46:32 carcinogenicity. means cancer producing ability. 14:46:37 reconstituted tobacco sheet, a plus, meaning significant 14:46:42 reduction. 14:46:42 the surgeon general goes down the line. look 14:46:44 under cigarette production. paper porosity, it reduces tar 14:46:51 and nicotine, because a plus means a significant reduction. 14:46:54 perforated filters. dr. cummings spent a lot of 14:46:57 time on that. he did not tell you that the surgeon general 14:46:59 knew about it and had studied it. and the surgeon 14:47:02 general's report card here, perforated filters are a plus. 14:47:06 that means a significant reduction. 14:47:08 the same thing for the cellulose acetate filter, a 14:47:12 plus, a significant reduction. 75 14:47:14 1 now, under those facts and under the admissions of 14:47:19 2 their expert, there is no evidence there was anything done 14:47:22 3 to one of mrs. burkhart's cigarettes that stopped her from 14:47:25 4 quitting. she quit smoking when she was smoking lights. 14:47:29 5 there is no evidence she was smoking -- that there was some 14:47:32 6 effect on her. 14:47:33 7 there is no evidence that there was deliberate 14:47:36 8 wrongdoing. and remember, when the companies were making 14:47:39 9 these design changes, the surgeon general knew about it 14:47:43 back in the '70s. 14:47:44 and the surgeon general did his own research, not 14:47:47 biased or tobacco company research. he did his own 14:47:50 research. and the surgeon general said those are positive 14:47:52 changes. 14:47:54 because, as dr. cummings says, it is a good thing 14:47:57 to reduce carcinogenicity. it is a good thing to reduce tar 14:48:02 and nicotine. that is a surgeon general's report card, 14:48:05 ladies and gentlemen. 14:48:05 the company should not be punished for doing 14:48:07 something that the surgeon general at the time researched 14:48:10 and said was beneficial for health. 14:48:12 now, we know that this did not happen by accident, 14:48:16 because we heard that the companies worked with the 14:48:20 government to make safer cigarettes. that was 14:48:23 dr. cummings. i cross-examined him. it was called the 76 14:48:26 1 national cancer institute tobacco working group. and the 14:48:29 2 title of the program was "less hazardous cigarette 14:48:32 3 program." 14:48:32 4 it was voluntary. the tobacco company top 14:48:35 5 scientists agreed to participate. they participated for 14:48:38 6 ten years. 14:48:40 7 dr. cummings says they researched for years. they 14:48:42 8 came up with all kinds of alternative cigarettes. and the 14:48:46 9 research was published. 14:48:48 and he admitted the top scientist at lorillard, 14:48:50 the top scientist at philip morris, the top scientist at 14:48:56 r.j. reynolds took their time. the tobacco companies spent 14:48:58 their money. the tobacco companies did the lab research. 14:49:01 they shared that research in publications with the 14:49:05 government from 1968 to '78. 14:49:08 and he admitted it was the government that shut it 14:49:11 down. 14:49:13 now, they voluntarily worked with the government 14:49:15 to make safer cigarettes. and here's one of the things we 14:49:18 saw from an internal government record that shows the 14:49:22 meeting. 14:49:23 that was the national cancer institute meeting of 14:49:29 1976. we went through that at length. the national cancer 14:49:32 institute was there. the department of agriculture was 14:49:35 there. 77 14:49:36 1 and dr. cummings admitted that the government told 14:49:38 2 the tobacco companies as part of this program to figure out 14:49:41 3 ways to make a cigarette that would have a small level of 14:49:46 4 tar but an extra level of nicotine. 14:49:48 5 and dr. cummings admitted at that time there was a 14:49:51 6 theory that would be a safer cigarette. because if you are 14:49:54 7 smoking for nicotine, if you could have a cigarette that 14:49:57 8 had more nicotine and less tar, that could be safer. 14:50:00 9 this is not a secret tobacco company document. if 14:50:04 anything, it was a secret government document at the time. 14:50:08 but it was the government that was supervising a program 14:50:12 that he admits was designed to make cigarettes safer. 14:50:16 and we went through it. it talks about ph in 14:50:18 there. it talks about reconstituted tobacco sheet. 14:50:21 and when they shut down the program, the 14:50:24 government thanked the tobacco scientists. all right? 14:50:27 now, 40 years later, a man that is been paid $1.5 14:50:33 million comes in and pulls out some 1970s research 14:50:36 documents and attacks the company. 14:50:37 now, there is a phrase, "damned if you do and 14:50:40 damned if you do not." 14:50:42 when the tobacco companies take out nicotine, like 14:50:44 philip morris did when they made an extensive effort to 14:50:46 make the nicotine-free cigarette next, it was not welcomed 14:50:51 by the public health community. it was attacked. 78 14:50:54 1 when the tobacco companies are told by the 14:50:57 2 government it could be safer to have a low tar, medium 14:51:01 3 nicotine cigarette, when we see in the own secret 14:51:03 4 government documents that that program was being directed 14:51:05 5 by the government, dr. cummings comes in and says, well, 14:51:10 6 you should not have done that either. 14:51:12 7 the truth is, ladies and gentlemen, that there 14:51:14 8 is not any evidence that the design of a cigarette that the 14:51:18 9 only smoker in this case, mrs. burkhart, smoked made her 14:51:22 get copd or made her addicted or stopped her from quitting, 14:51:26 because we know she can quit. 14:51:29 we know that the companies cooperated. lorillard 14:51:33 and philip morris did. we have got an internal memo from the 14:51:36 '60s where reynolds says let us work on the safer 14:51:41 cigarette program, push the cooperation with the 14:51:43 government. 14:51:44 and one last thing on design. dr. cummings 14:51:46 admitted that the companies were trying to make safer 14:51:50 cigarettes. and after the government safer cigarette 14:51:54 program disbanded, that continued. and look what reynolds 14:51:57 did. they made a cigarette called premier that only heated 14:52:00 tobacco and did not burn it. 14:52:01 and this is not a secret tobacco company document. 14:52:05 it is a secret government document that came out of 14:52:07 litigation. preliminary research conducted by the 79 14:52:10 1 developer showed there were fewer carcinogens in premier. 14:52:15 2 right off the bat, dr. cummings said it was a 14:52:17 3 safer cigarette and that it did have less carcinogens 14:52:20 4 because it did not burn tobacco at all. 14:52:23 5 look at what the government said about this 14:52:25 6 cigarette that was developed by a tobacco company to be 14:52:28 7 safer. look what they were concerned about. 14:52:33 8 the panel was concerned about the ramifications of 14:52:35 9 a cigarette that is actually safer. actually safer. the 14:52:42 government was worried that r.j. reynolds had developed a 14:52:47 cigarette that was actually safer. 14:52:49 was reynolds engaged in deliberate wrongdoing when 14:52:55 they made a cigarette that was actually safer, a cigarette 14:52:57 that the government attacked? was lorillard and philip 14:53:00 morris engaged in deliberate wrongdoing when they sent 14:53:02 their top scientists for ten years to work hand in hand 14:53:06 with the government to design cigarettes, only to have them 14:53:09 pull out a '76 document from lorillard or a '73 document 14:53:13 from reynolds and say, oh, you were researching the wrong 14:53:16 things? 14:53:16 when we know, and dr. cummings admitted, that the 14:53:20 government's national cancer institute less hazardous 14:53:24 cigarette program was behind in endorsing that kind of 14:53:27 research. 14:53:30 ladies and gentlemen, mrs. burkhart has not proved 80 14:53:31 1 that she is entitled to get the bonus award of punitive 14:53:38 2 damages. 14:53:39 3 look what the government did when they found out 14:53:41 4 that there was a safer cigarette that cut the risk of 14:53:43 5 cancer. they said, should not wait for the scientists to 14:53:46 6 complete research. research should continue. 14:53:47 7 but look at that last sentence. there is no need 14:53:50 8 to wait to initiate a war, a war against new tobacco 14:53:55 9 products. 14:53:56 this is the government's record. this is not a 14:54:00 tobacco company spokesman. the government thought they 14:54:05 were making safer cigarettes. 14:54:07 dr. cummings had absolutely no explanation of why 14:54:09 the government shut down the program where the companies 14:54:13 worked with them to design. he had no explanation why the 14:54:15 government would be more scared about a cigarette that is 14:54:18 safer. he did not say a thing about that. 14:54:21 so they say that filters are fraudulent. they say 14:54:26 that the companies deliberately and wrongfully sold 14:54:30 filters. there was not any evidence. but, ladies and 14:54:34 gentlemen, what dr. -- i believe it was dr. proctor, 14:54:36 admitted is that the surgeon general actually was looking 14:54:40 at the effect on actual people. 14:54:42 they looked at the people who smoked filters. and 14:54:45 they looked at the people who smoked what they called low 81 14:54:48 1 yield, low tar, low nicotine. and they tracked their 14:54:51 2 cancer dates or their cancer rates. 14:54:55 3 and so they could figure out, wait a second, are 14:54:57 4 filters actually working? are the people who smoked 14:54:59 5 filters getting lower rates of disease? 14:55:01 6 i do not have to go into the tobacco company files. 14:55:04 7 let us just look at what the surgeon general said when the 14:55:08 8 companies like the companies here were making filters. 14:55:11 9 '79. she is smoking filters, mrs. burkhart. the 14:55:16 surgeon general's report says the people who use -- use of 14:55:19 filter cigarettes and smoking of cigarettes with lower 14:55:22 amounts of tar decrease lung cancer mortality rates. 14:55:27 that is real people, real death rates, and a real 14:55:30 benefit. how is that fraud? how is that fraud? 14:55:38 in '81, again, today's filter-tipped, lower tar 14:55:42 and nicotine cigarettes produce lower rates of lung cancer. 14:55:45 it is not a trick. it is what the surgeon general 14:55:46 found when he actually measured the lung cancer rates. 14:55:50 so, you know, mr. heimann can pull out a document 14:55:53 that says, oh, the illusion of filtration. or he can pull 14:55:57 out a document that dr. proctor showed you that said let us 14:55:59 change the color of a filter. and then dr. proctor had to 14:56:02 admit it never even happened. 14:56:03 but if you want to know if filters are really 14:56:06 safer and you want to know whether the companies were doing 82 14:56:09 1 something wrong at the time, look at what the surgeon 14:56:11 2 general said. 14:56:12 3 filters, they believed, based on real data for 14:56:16 4 real smokers, were decreasing death rates. 14:56:19 5 that is not fraud, ladies and gentlemen. that is 14:56:21 6 not wrongdoing. and none of it had anything to do with 14:56:26 7 mrs. burkhart. 14:56:26 8 1989, the same thing. reduces the risk of lung 14:56:30 9 cancer. 14:56:30 1990, when they observed smokers of filtered 14:56:35 cigarettes, they find a lower risk of lung cancer. 14:56:38 how is that fraud? how did they show -- does this 14:56:42 make any sense? would the companies want to kill their own 14:56:45 customers? would the companies engage in wrongdoing if 14:56:49 they are going to spend all this money to make a safer 14:56:51 cigarette that the government tries to shut down? would 14:56:56 the companies be engaged in wrongdoing if they are working 14:56:59 for ten years on published safer cigarette research, and 14:57:01 the tobacco companies are the ones that are doing it, and 14:57:04 the government shuts it down? 14:57:06 mr. heimann: not really. there is no evidence of 14:57:07 this. this is -- he is coming up with -- 14:57:10 the court: i have to sustain it. i'm sorry. 14:57:13 the standard i've given you under the legal 14:57:15 instructions, which i think counsel is trying to change, is 83 14:57:19 1 punitive damages. this is on instruction number 17. 14:57:23 2 punitive damages are warranted if you find the 14:57:26 3 plaintiff has proved by clear and convincing evidence that 14:57:28 4 the defendant had actual knowledge of the wrongfulness of 14:57:31 5 its conduct. 14:57:33 6 i remind you here that wrongfulness of its conduct 14:57:36 7 has already been determined by the engle jury. after 14:57:40 8 listening to more than a year's worth of evidence, i'm not 14:57:44 9 putting you through that burden. 14:57:56 the engle jury has already decided that, including 14:57:56 the withholding of information about the effectiveness, 14:57:56 according to their own research, of filters and/or 14:57:55 perforated filters and/or menthol. 14:57:59 the engle jury already decided the wrongfulness. 14:58:05 to the extent he is arguing that it was not wrongful 14:58:08 conduct, he cannot do that. i'm sorry. 14:58:12 the burden here on the plaintiff and the issue 14:58:15 here for you to decide on punitive damages is whether 14:58:18 they have proved by clear and convincing evidence that the 14:58:20 defendant had actual knowledge of the wrongfulness, the 14:58:26 defendant had actual knowledge of the wrongfulness. the 14:58:29 engle jury has already said it was wrongful. 14:58:32 the question is whether they had actual knowledge 14:58:34 of the wrongfulness and that there was a high probability 14:58:39 of injury or damage and despite that knowledge 84 14:58:43 1 intentionally pursued that course of conduct resulting in 14:58:47 2 the plaintiff's injuries. that is the issue. 14:58:50 3 were they aware of the wrongfulness, not whether 14:58:53 4 the wrongfulness occurred and, therefore, i have to strike 14:58:57 5 those portions where he is simply arguing there was no 14:59:00 6 wrongful conduct. the engle jury has already decided that 14:59:03 7 for us. 14:59:03 8 but the plaintiff's burden is actual knowledge of 14:59:06 9 the wrongfulness and despite high probability of injury and 14:59:13 despite that knowledge pursued the course resulting in the 14:59:16 plaintiff's injuries. that is the standard. i have to 14:59:19 remind the jury of that. 14:59:21 mr. heimann: and your honor, he is almost two 14:59:22 hours now. i would ask -- 14:59:25 mr. belasic: i'm finishing up, your honor. 14:59:27 the court: no. i'm not going to limit him, nor 14:59:29 will i limit you. 14:59:30 mr. belasic: as judge jones read to you -- and 14:59:31 you can read in black and white -- the instruction says 14:59:34 that mrs. burkhart has to prove actual knowledge of 14:59:36 wrongdoing. we have reviewed the evidence of what the 14:59:39 companies knew and what the companies did. you will 14:59:42 determine whether it was actual knowledge of wrongdoing 14:59:44 under these circumstances. 14:59:46 but also as judge jones said, you have to 85 14:59:48 1 determine whether the companies then intentionally followed 14:59:51 2 a course of conduct that they knew was wrongful and that it 14:59:56 3 caused an injury to mrs. burkhart. that is why i'm 15:00:00 4 reviewing that evidence. you will decide. 15:00:05 5 and what i suggest to you is that based on the 15:00:07 6 evidence from dr. proctor and from dr. cummings, the 15:00:09 7 evidence admitting cooperation with the government and the 15:00:12 8 evidence that did not link any of this conduct to 15:00:16 9 mrs. burkhart -- and after all, that is why we are here. 15:00:18 that is the only reason we are here -- that she is not 15:00:22 entitled to punitive damages. and so you should vote no on 15:00:25 that final question. 15:00:26 now, i'll leave you with this. at the end of the 15:00:32 day mrs. burkhart was a heavy smoker. and at the end of 15:00:35 the day mrs. burkhart chose once to stop in the 1980s. and 15:00:40 at the end of the day she chose once to quit for good in 15:00:43 1994. 15:00:43 and if it was not for a lawsuit, we would say that 15:00:47 that was a smoker who could control her behavior and who 15:00:50 quit for good by her own words. but because this is a 15:00:55 lawsuit, plaintiffs argue, well, they have somehow proven 15:00:59 that addiction was the substantial cause. we know that the 15:01:03 only time she put her mind to it, she could quit. and 15:01:08 addiction did not stop her. 15:01:09 it is not something that a company made up. she is 86 15:01:12 1 not a desperate smoker who tried to quit in the '50s or 15:01:16 2 '60s. she did not; made no effort. she is not a 15:01:21 3 desperate smoker who was being warned every day by her 15:01:24 4 husband that it would kill her. she is not somebody like 15:01:27 5 that. she is someone who is being warned by her husband it 15:01:29 6 could kill her but was not doing anything at all to quit in 15:01:32 7 the '70s. 15:01:33 8 she says she only -- the first time she ever tried 15:01:37 9 to quit was the '80s, quit for three weeks. by the 15:01:40 '90s, smoking the same brand, same nicotine. she was 15:01:43 smoking more than before. if she was addicted, dr. burns 15:01:47 says she was at her peak of addiction. 15:01:50 and when she changed her mind, she changed her 15:01:52 life. and when she made the decision, she no longer 15:01:55 smoked. 15:01:57 ladies and gentlemen, under those circumstances, 15:01:59 even if smoking is the medical cause, addiction cannot be a 15:02:03 legal cause of a person who knows the risk of smoking and 15:02:07 who chooses to smoke and then chooses to quit successfully 15:02:12 the very first time they put their mind to it. 15:02:15 it is been a long trial. and i think this is the 15:02:17 last time i'll get a chance to talk to you. one thing that 15:02:21 i wanted to tell you is, i know by now, i said for some of 15:02:27 you, it was an inconvenience; for others, it would be a 15:02:31 sacrifice. i know by now it is a sacrifice for every one of 87 15:02:34 1 you. you do not take nine days out of your life to decide a 15:02:37 2 civil dispute without it being a sacrifice. and, again, i 15:02:40 3 know you were drafted. everybody else volunteered. 15:02:43 4 so i thank you for your tremendous attention, and 15:02:45 5 i thank you for your service. closing argument by the defense 15:22:16 7 mr. rowley: good afternoon, everybody. 15:22:18 8 mr. belasic just covered a whole lot of ground. 15:22:20 9 i'm not going to repeat the things that he told you. i 15:22:22 will tell you that i agreed with all of them. 15:22:24 but today, i want to focus with my limited time, 15:22:27 as judge jones said, on issues that are a little bit more 15:22:31 specific to lorillard, and i will be brief. 15:22:33 so i want to start by reminding you of some of the 15:22:40 facts that are related to mrs. burkhart's smoking history 15:22:43 in relation specifically to lorillard. 15:22:45 the only lorillard product that mrs. burkhart 15:22:47 smoked was kent, kent cigarettes. she started smoking 15:22:51 them, she says, in 1965, and she says she stopped smoking 15:22:55 them in 1974. after 1974, she never did smoke any other 15:23:05 lorillard brand. that is the entire span of her lorillard 15:23:07 smoking. 15:23:08 in 1965, when she started smoking kent, 15:23:13 mrs. burkhart was 24 years old. she was married to her 15:23:19 first husband. she had already moved from home. they 91 15:23:21 1 moved out of town and then back to kentucky. 15:23:23 2 and she was certainly old enough at that time, at 15:23:29 3 the time she started smoking kent, to make an adult 15:23:32 4 decision to smoke. mrs. burkhart was already smoking 15:23:38 5 filtered cigarettes at the time she switched to kent 15:23:42 6 cigarettes. 15:23:42 7 and you heard her testimony -- and mr. belasic 15:23:47 8 referred to it briefly -- that the reason that she switched 15:23:51 9 was that she believed that kents tasted better. that was 15:23:55 her motivation for switching. and when she tried them, she 15:24:00 found that they actually did taste better. and her sworn 15:24:03 testimony -- you saw it on video -- was that she was not 15:24:06 even thinking about kent as being safer at the time that 15:24:11 she switched to kent. now, that was in her deposition. 15:24:15 when she came in and you saw her testify live here 15:24:18 at trial, she said something about the companies not 15:24:22 working to improve their products or take stuff, i think 15:24:26 she said, out of the cigarettes. 15:24:28 but you folks saw the testimony of dr. proctor. 15:24:32 remember, he was the second witness who you saw. and he 15:24:35 described all of the efforts, many of the efforts that 15:24:39 lorillard made during this precise time period to improve 15:24:43 its products, to identify potentially harmful components in 15:24:48 the smoke. 15:24:49 lorillard's work with some of the leading 92 15:24:52 1 scientists of the day, remember, these folks were described 15:24:56 2 as giants in american public health. during my 15:25:00 3 cross-examination, he said that they were the leading 15:25:03 4 figures in public health. towering figures, in fact, is 15:25:08 5 what he called them. 15:25:09 6 so some of the things that dr. proctor described 15:25:12 7 were that lorillard identified what he called then phenolic 15:25:17 8 compounds. remember the discussion of ciliostasis, the 15:25:20 9 hair cells in the lung. that was the predominant theory of 15:25:24 lung disease at the time. 15:25:25 so lorillard collaborated with scientists, 15:25:29 dr. dietrich hoffmann, who was at sloan-kettering medical 15:25:33 center, to try to identify and isolate these then phenolic 15:25:37 compounds, and then lorillard developed for kent the filter 15:25:44 that filtered out phenols. 15:25:46 so when mrs. burkhart said that she thought 15:25:49 lorillard and the other companies were working on this, she 15:25:52 was right. they were working on it. and you heard this 15:25:55 testimony directly from dr. proctor during his 15:25:57 cross-examination. that is not the only thing that he told 15:26:01 you about. 15:26:03 can you pull up -- 15:26:09 okay. if you will remember, this is one of the 15:26:12 first exhibits that the plaintiff's lawyers used in the 15:26:15 case. this is the "life" magazine article relating to the 93 15:26:18 1 mouse skin painting studies. and remember, dr. proctor 15:26:21 2 told you that it was lorillard who sought out dr. graham 15:26:26 3 and dr. wynder after their publication of the first 15:26:29 4 epidemiologic study that showed a relationship between 15:26:32 5 smoking and lung cancer and offered to help them. 15:26:34 6 now, that is not reprehensible conduct. it is not 15:26:40 7 punishable conduct. and it does not show an intent to harm 15:26:44 8 or an intent to harm consumers. he reached out to them, 15:26:46 9 provided them with hundreds of cigarettes for these 15:26:49 studies. and dr. proctor told you that this help lasted 15:26:54 for decades. in fact, lorillard provided these scientists 15:26:57 with cigarettes, both before and after this "life" magazine 15:27:02 article. 15:27:02 and he told you about all the other efforts, many 15:27:04 of the other efforts that lorillard made during this time 15:27:09 period before the kent cigarette was introduced, these 15:27:12 efforts to make the kent filter, like pmo. you may have 15:27:17 made a note about pmo during the trial when dr. proctor 15:27:21 testified, trying to reduce ciliostasis, trying to remove 15:27:27 phenols, trying to remove potentially harmful constituents 15:27:31 in cigarette smoke. 15:27:32 i want to talk just for a minute about this 15:27:36 allegation that the companies did things to try to make 15:27:40 cigarettes more addictive. and mr. belasic covered aspects 15:27:45 of it. 94 15:27:47 1 and remember, he said that these -- these efforts 15:27:50 2 were in response to public health recommendations, 15:27:54 3 including recommendations from the national cancer 15:27:55 4 institute. but it was also recommended by the surgeon 15:27:59 5 general of the united states. 15:28:01 6 remember the plaintiff's lawyer showed you 15:28:03 7 documents that talked about nicotine addiction and changing 15:28:08 8 smoke ph and filter ventilation, things like that. 15:28:13 9 i wanted to show you one lorillard document, 15:28:16 because lorillard's program, as i think dr. cummings 15:28:21 mentioned, lorillard's program to follow these public 15:28:24 health recommendations was called the nicotine augmentation 15:28:26 project. 15:28:27 the document i'm going to show you was admitted by 15:28:30 the plaintiff's lawyers. it is the first document, the 15:28:33 seminal document in the program. and it explains exactly 15:28:37 why they were pursuing this research and who recommended 15:28:41 this research. 15:28:41 can we put that up, please? 15:28:46 this is from may of 1976. so it is within days of 15:28:53 the nci tobacco working group recommendation that 15:28:56 mr. belasic showed you. 15:28:57 the very first sentence of the very first 15:29:02 paragraph that established this program -- and the snippets 15:29:07 that the plaintiff's lawyer read to you came from this 95 15:29:10 1 document and other documents that were part of this 15:29:12 2 program. 15:29:12 3 the first sentence says, recommendations from 15:29:15 4 health-oriented agencies and pressures from competitive 15:29:19 5 companies make it imperative that lorillard develop a 15:29:23 6 flavorful cigarette delivering lower tar, while at the same 15:29:27 7 time delivering a level of nicotine higher than could be 15:29:30 8 obtained by normal conventional cigarette construction. 15:29:35 9 that is the very first sentence. 15:29:37 the contemporaneous documents say that this work 15:29:41 was an attempt to make a safer cigarette. that is the 15:29:46 purpose of the work. and lorillard's documents at the time 15:29:50 reflect it. 15:29:59 all right. mr. belasic talked with you a little 15:30:02 bit about damages. and i agree with him that you should 15:30:05 not reach the issue of damages in this case. 15:30:07 but the court's instruction was that damages must 15:30:13 be fair and just. there is nothing in the instructions 15:30:20 about giving an award that is shocking. the award, if you 15:30:25 reach that question and if you were to award damages, must 15:30:29 be fair and just. 15:30:30 the number that mr. heimann gave you, $10 million, 15:30:33 is shocking. a fair and just award, if mrs. burkhart could 15:30:40 meet her burden in showing that she was addicted to 15:30:45 nicotine, and in showing that nicotine was a cause of her 96 15:30:49 1 injuries, and meet all of her other burdens, a fair and 15:30:53 2 just award would be one where you would take a zero off the 15:30:57 3 number that mr. heimann suggested. 15:31:00 4 only if mrs. burkhart could meet her burdens. and 15:31:06 5 we do not believe that she can for the reasons that 15:31:08 6 mr. belasic explained. 15:31:10 7 so one other topic regarding lorillard that i want 15:31:15 8 to talk with you about. 15:31:16 9 mr. heimann talked with you a little bit about 15:31:19 marketing. you heard testimony about lorillard's 15:31:23 marketing, in particular, from both dr. cummings, one of 15:31:27 the plaintiff's experts, and dr. proctor, one of the 15:31:29 plaintiff's experts. 15:31:30 and both of those folks told you that lorillard 15:31:34 tobacco company had a policy that dated back decades, more 15:31:38 than 40 years, against placing products in movies and 15:31:44 films. 15:31:44 it was the first thing, in fact, that i asked 15:31:47 dr. proctor about. 15:31:48 and they not only had that policy, when they were 15:31:51 solicited by agencies and producers, they rejected those 15:31:58 solicitations. 15:31:59 many of the things that mr. heimann talked about 15:32:11 as being reprehensible or evidence of bad intent were 15:32:16 actually efforts to make a safer cigarette. and 97 15:32:22 1 lorillard's nicotine augmentation program is just one 15:32:25 2 example. 15:32:27 3 so i am out of time. i want to thank you for your 15:32:29 4 service in this case. i appreciate it very much. and 15:32:33 5 lorillard also appreciates it. thank you. closing argument by the defense 15:32:51 8 ms. gallagher: good afternoon, ladies and 15:32:51 9 gentlemen. 15:32:52 as the judge has instructed you, the plaintiff has 15:32:54 to prove every essential element of her claims in this 15:32:57 case, and she is got to do that by a preponderance of the 15:32:59 evidence. 15:33:00 and you have an instruction on that. but it is not 15:33:04 just that it has to be a preponderance of the evidence, it 15:33:07 has to be the credible and believable evidence. 15:33:11 as you will see when you look through your 15:33:13 instructions, you actually have three different 15:33:15 instructions on credibility of the witnesses. that is how 15:33:19 important it is. 15:33:21 and that is what i want to spend my brief time with 15:33:23 you today talking about. 15:33:26 one of the instructions you have goes to the 15:33:30 credibility of experts. 15:33:40 can you get it? 98 15:33:42 1 there we go. 15:33:53 2 and you will see these. you have got these. 15:33:55 3 when a witness is being paid for reviewing and 15:33:57 4 testifying concerning the evidence, you may consider the 15:34:01 5 possibility of bias, and you may view with caution the 15:34:05 6 testimony of such witness where court testimony is given 15:34:08 7 with regularity and represents a significant portion of the 15:34:12 8 witness' income. 15:34:13 9 well, you know that the plaintiff's experts, 15:34:18 drs. cummings, burns, and proctor, have testified with 15:34:24 great regularity. dr. cummings has testified in 60 to 70 15:34:29 trials, dr. proctor in over 30 trials, dr. burns in 40 to 15:34:36 50 trials. 15:34:37 between them, these three experts, in the last 15:34:39 five years, have testified in over 150 trials like this. 15:34:45 and that does not count the amount of time they spend 15:34:48 reviewing records, giving depositions, and writing reports. 15:34:52 the other thing that you can consider is whether 15:34:56 these experts make a significant portion of their income 15:34:59 from testifying. and you know from listening to the 15:35:03 cross-examinations of these witnesses that each one of them 15:35:06 have become millionaires by testifying in this litigation. 15:35:10 and, in fact, they are actually making more and 15:35:15 more money as the years go by. 15:35:20 dr. cummings made well over half of his income 99 15:35:23 1 last year testifying in tobacco cases. 15:35:28 2 dr. proctor said last year that he earned almost 15:35:31 3 half a million dollars. and this year he will earn more 15:35:34 4 than that. 15:35:36 5 and dr. burns makes ninety percent of his income 15:35:40 6 testifying in cases just like this. 15:35:43 7 so should you view their testimony with an eye as 15:35:49 8 to whether they are biased? well, you do not even have to 15:35:53 9 wonder about that because they have told you they are. 15:35:57 dr. cummings is the general in the war against 15:35:59 tobacco. and you have dr. proctor, who thinks that 15:36:03 shocking, large verdicts act as a tax on cigarettes, 15:36:09 cigarettes that he wants banned. 15:36:12 these experts have an agenda. and it really 15:36:15 does not have anything to do with the specific plaintiff, a 15:36:21 plaintiff like mrs. burkhart. they are here for other 15:36:24 reasons. 15:36:24 and they did not tell you much about mrs. burkhart. 15:36:31 you heard very, very little about mrs. burkhart from those 15:36:33 experts, the very person that this case is about. 15:36:39 so what other evidence did the plaintiff bring 15:36:41 you? the plaintiff brought you mrs. burkhart, the smoker 15:36:44 in this case, to tell you about the decisions she made, 15:36:48 what she heard, and the decisions she made about her own 15:36:51 smoking. 100 15:36:53 1 and then we brought you her husband, the man who 15:36:58 2 has known her for 40 years. 15:37:01 3 and you have another instruction on the 15:37:03 4 credibility of other witnesses. and it says, when i say 15:37:12 5 you must consider all the evidence, i do not mean that you 15:37:15 6 must accept all the evidence as true or accurate. you 15:37:19 7 should decide whether you believe what each witness had to 15:37:24 8 say and how important that testimony was. in making that 15:37:28 9 decision, you may believe or disbelieve any witness in 15:37:33 whole or in part. 15:37:37 so let us review what you have heard about some of 15:37:40 the key issues in this case. 15:37:45 the plaintiffs want you to believe that 15:37:48 mrs. burkhart smoked filtered cigarettes because she 15:37:50 thought they were safer. the evidence that you heard from 15:37:56 mrs. burkhart was that when she went to kent filtered 15:38:00 cigarettes, she chose a filtered cigarette because it kept 15:38:03 the tobacco out of her mouth. 15:38:05 she specifically said that she did not switch to 15:38:10 kent cigarettes because she thought they were safer, that 15:38:13 she thought they were better for her health. 15:38:15 but then she said she switched to filters because 15:38:20 filters reduced nicotine and tar, because they were better 15:38:25 for her. 15:38:26 so you had every bit of testimony from, no, i 101 15:38:29 1 switched to them because they kept tobacco out of my teeth, 15:38:33 2 to i switched to them because i thought they were better 15:38:36 3 for me. 15:38:36 4 well, keep in mind when mrs. burkhart switched to 15:38:40 5 filtered cigarettes, because that was in 1960. and if you 15:38:46 6 think that she switched to filtered cigarettes in the 1960s 15:38:49 7 because she thought they were safer, then she had to know 15:38:54 8 that smoking was dangerous in the 1960s. 15:38:59 9 and what did she tell you about that? when she 15:39:01 was on the witness stand here in this courtroom, she told 15:39:04 you that she did not know that there were any health risks 15:39:07 associated with smoking until the 1980s. 15:39:10 and then she also told you that if she had known 15:39:15 in the 1960s or the 1970s that cigarettes caused disease or 15:39:21 were addictive, that she would have tried to quit sooner. 15:39:27 but then she also told you that she knew she was 15:39:30 addicted in the 1960s, that she used the term "nicotine 15:39:35 fit" to refer to her own smoking in the 1960s. 15:39:38 and you heard from mr. burkhart. mr. burkhart 15:39:42 said that he and mrs. burkhart had conversations about 15:39:46 smoking, about the health risks of smoking, that smoking 15:39:50 could be dangerous for you, that smoking could be bad for 15:39:52 your lungs, that smoking could kill you, back in the 1970s 15:39:57 when they first met, in 1974. 15:40:02 but then mr. burkhart said, no, no. those 102 15:40:05 1 conversations were actually later that i had with my wife, 15:40:10 2 that smoking could kill you. 15:40:12 3 so if you believe the testimony of the burkharts, 15:40:16 4 then you have to believe that mrs. burkhart was first aware 15:40:19 5 of the health risks of smoking in the 1960s, that she was 15:40:25 6 first aware of the health risks of smoking in the 1970s, 15:40:29 7 and that she was first aware of the health risks of smoking 15:40:32 8 in the 1980s. 15:40:33 9 mr. heimann has also said that mrs. burkhart 15:40:40 smoked light cigarettes or low tar cigarettes because she 15:40:46 thought that they were safer for her, that she thought that 15:40:50 they were better for her. 15:40:51 but when mrs. burkhart was asked about her switch 15:40:55 to kools, which would have been the first light cigarette 15:40:59 that she smoked, she said she switched to them because they 15:41:03 were menthol; that she had a cold and her friend said, try 15:41:07 a menthol cigarette, and that is when she picked up her 15:41:10 first light cigarette. 15:41:11 she told you that she smoked her second light 15:41:14 cigarette, the second brand, virginia slims lights, because 15:41:19 she was trying to get off the menthol from the kools 15:41:22 lights. 15:41:23 she also told you that she never compared tar 15:41:27 amounts between cigarettes. and she told you that she 15:41:33 never chose a brand based on the tar levels. 103 15:41:37 1 so mrs. burkhart told you that she chose low tar 15:41:41 2 cigarettes because of the low tar; she thought they were 15:41:46 3 better for her. and yet at the same time she told you that 15:41:50 4 she never chose a brand of cigarettes based on the level of 15:41:53 5 tar. 15:41:53 6 i add, mrs. burkhart told you that she picked 15:42:03 7 virginia slims because of the ad campaign, you have come a 15:42:05 8 long way, baby. she started smoking virginia slims in 15:42:09 9 1980 -- 1980s, somewhere around the mid 1980s. 15:42:14 and as you have heard from dr. cummings, you have come 15:42:16 a long way, baby, that ad campaign started in the late 15:42:20 1960s, some 15 years before she ever tried a virginia slims 15:42:25 cigarette. 15:42:25 mr. burkhart also talked to you about ads. he 15:42:28 said that the reason he and mrs. burkhart switched to light 15:42:33 cigarettes was because of tv ads they saw in the 1980s and 15:42:36 the 1990s. 15:42:38 and you know that is impossible, because there 15:42:41 have not been tv ads for cigarettes since 1971. 15:42:45 the last one i'll give you -- and i know a lot of 15:42:52 you have been taking notes and you have probably got notes of 15:42:55 your own on some of these topics. 15:42:58 let us talk about the 1985 warning. mrs. burkhart 15:43:00 told you that she never saw the 1985 warning on emphysema, 15:43:05 that she could not read it because the print was too little. 104 15:43:08 1 but then she also told you if she had seen that 15:43:11 2 emphysema warning, she would have stopped and thought about 15:43:16 3 it. 15:43:16 4 and then you heard from mr. burkhart who said they 15:43:20 5 had very specific conversations about the 1985 warnings. 15:43:25 6 and he told you that mrs. burkhart believed the 1985 15:43:32 7 warnings. and then mr. burkhart told you mrs. burkhart did 15:43:37 8 not believe the 1985 warnings. 15:43:40 9 so if you believe the burkharts, mrs. burkhart 15:43:45 never saw the warning about emphysema, or she had a very 15:43:53 specific conversation with her husband about it and she 15:43:56 either believed or did not believe that warning. 15:44:00 you decide whether you believe what each witness 15:44:14 had to say. those are in the judge's instructions. and 15:44:16 you may believe or disbelieve any witness in whole or in 15:44:19 part. 15:44:19 and if you decide to believe the burkharts, you have 15:44:22 got to believe absolutely contradictory evidence. 15:44:26 and a third instruction you have from judge jones 15:44:31 about the credibility of witnesses is whether those 15:44:34 witnesses have changed their testimony on important 15:44:38 matters. and that is something that you need to consider. 15:44:43 because if you go by the evidence that the 15:44:46 plaintiffs brought you on important issues, like, did 15:44:50 mrs. burkhart know about the health risks of smoking in the 105 15:44:54 1 1960s, the answer is yes and the answer is no. 15:45:00 2 if you go by the evidence the plaintiffs brought 15:45:03 3 you about whether mrs. burkhart saw warnings and paid 15:45:05 4 attention to them, the answer is yes and the answer is no. 15:45:11 5 if mrs. burkhart relied on ads in choosing a brand 15:45:15 6 of cigarettes, the answer is yes and the answer is no. 15:45:19 7 all of these important issues have both yeses and 15:45:25 8 noes as the answer. and that is not clear, credible, 15:45:30 9 preponderance of the evidence proving the elements, 15:45:32 essential elements of the plaintiff's claims. 15:45:37 what facts are clear, that mrs. burkhart believes 15:45:39 that smoking is an individual choice, that mrs. burkhart 15:45:44 believes the cure for smoking addiction is to quit. and 15:45:51 that when mrs. burkhart made up her mind to quit, she did 15:45:55 so. there are no yeses or noes, no maybes on those facts. 15:45:59 those facts are undisputed. 15:46:00 mrs. burkhart's smoking decisions were her own. 15:46:05 and that is why addiction was not the legal cause of her 15:46:12 copd. 15:46:13 ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your 15:46:15 attention over the last week and today. and thank you for 15:46:19 your jury service.
