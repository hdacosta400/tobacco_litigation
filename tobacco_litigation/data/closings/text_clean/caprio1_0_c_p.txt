4 mr. hammer: thank you, judge. may it 5 please the court. 6 good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 7 this is our opportunity to sum up the case. i 8 know we have been here for a long time. we truly 9 appreciate the attention you have given us. 10 we put on a lot of evidence. you heard 11 from dr. proctor, you heard from dr. seidman, 12 you heard from dr. mannino, you heard from 13 dr. patel, you heard from dr. herrera. you 14 heard from ed, you heard from bryan. and we 15 put together the case for you because we did not 16 know what you needed to hear to come to a 17 decision. 18 and you may have heard some repetitive 19 stuff, and we apologize for that, and it may 20 have taken a lot longer than you all 21 anticipated, and we apologize for that. 22 but we do not know what you need to hear. 23 and we think we brought you forth enough 24 evidence to convince you by a greater weight of 25 the evidence that certainly ed belongs as a 1 class member. 2 so i thank you for your patience, and 3 we are going to try to rip through what we 4 covered in the last few weeks in the next 5 couple hours. 6 i'm going to talk to you for a little 7 while, then mr. schlesinger is going to talk to 8 you for a little while, mr. gdanski may talk to 9 you. so all of us are going to talk to you 10 about what we showed you throughout the past 11 few weeks. 12 first of all, trial by jury. great 13 thing. it is a great thing we have in this 14 country. 15 thomas jefferson said, "the best of all 16 safeguards for the person and property of every 17 individual." 18 he said that a long time ago, and it 19 still stands true today. what you all are 20 doing is magnificent, the fact that you have been 21 here, and we appreciate that. 22 you know, it is been 20 years, nearly 20 23 years since ed was first diagnosed with copd. 24 on that day, he learned he had a 25 life-threatening disease. on that day, he 1 learned the impact of the cigarettes that he would 2 been smoking for all those years. 3 he started smoking when he was 15 years 4 old; a kid, a kid. he started smoking as a 5 kid, when the world was different. the world 6 was totally different. 7 and, you know, he tried -- as soon as he 8 found out how smoking was affecting him, he 9 tried to quit. 10 number 37. 11 he tried to quit so many different ways. 12 we talked about this. many times you have seen 13 this. we put it up, the defense put it up. 14 dr. seidman talked about it. ed talked about 15 it. dr. dorce talked about it, their own 16 addiction expert. 17 he tried so many different ways to quit, 18 and he could not do it. 19 thankfully, today he sits there, since 20 january 1st of this year, not smoking. it is 21 miraculous. hopefully he never goes back 22 again. 23 but he tried to quit. and the question 24 that you have got to decide in this case is, was 25 ed addicted? 1 well, he tried to quit, and every time he 2 tried -- number 38 -- he went through all sorts 3 of withdrawal symptoms. every single range. 4 all the -- the whole gamut of withdrawal 5 symptoms. 6 we talked about this. you saw this 7 slide. and ed talked about it, dr. seidman 8 talked about it, dr. dorce talked about it. 9 dr. dorce said: yeah, but he had 10 control over his smoking. 11 okay, that was her opinion, and she is 12 entitled to that. 13 throughout the years, he quit. he would 14 quit for brief periods of time. but that hook 15 kept drawing him back. he was addicted. this 16 is a man that was hopelessly addicted and still 17 is today. he still craves the cigarettes. 18 that is crazy. it is crazy, but he does. 19 that is how powerful this addiction is. 20 and for some people, they can put it down, 21 never look back. 22 ed cannot do that. he has not been able to 23 do that. he is done it now for the past, now, 24 what is it, i do not know how many -- 38 days 25 now, i guess. 1 but, you know, it is a difficult task. 2 and every day he fights it. he told you that. 3 nearly every doctor that saw ed, all the 4 people close to him, bryan, ed himself, louise, 5 all his doctors, throughout the medical records 6 said nicotine addiction, tobacco addiction. 7 the doctors that treated him, that had 8 their hands on him. you heard from dr. patel 9 and dr. herrera, the men that touched him, that 10 felt him, that talked to him directly, that 11 knew him the best, all throughout the medical 12 records from '96 on, said he was addicted. 13 they had no doubt about it. 14 we have to prove that ed's addiction led 15 to his disease. caused his disease. 16 and there is legal cause. i'm going to 17 talk about that in a minute. 18 but, you know, there is no dispute in 19 this case -- number 18. 20 there is no dispute in this case that 21 ed's copd and lung cancer was caused by 22 smoking. 23 dr. andrews, remember dr. andrews, the 24 defense expert even came in and said: no, he 25 had lung cancer. he had copd caused from his 1 smoking. now, he did not talk about addiction. 2 dr. dorce from the defense talked about 3 addiction. 4 but what did dr. mannino tell you, the 5 world-renowned expert. what did dr. patel, 6 dr. herrera. they told you, ed's addiction 7 caused him to smoke all those cigarettes. ed's 8 addiction caused that disease. 9 that is what we have here. now, by virtue 10 of those facts alone, ed should be considered a 11 member of the engle class. 12 that is the first question you have to 13 answer. first question, engle class. 14 the engle class, a member of the original 15 700,000 members of sick or dying smokers in the 16 state of florida. that was the original class. 17 what we are here to determine today, is ed 18 caprio one of the children, the progeny of the 19 engle class action case that took place 20 20 years ago. 21 we said he is. of course he is. that is 22 why he is sitting here. he is waited now -- 23 since being diagnosed with copd, he is waited 24 for his day in court. 25 and we thank you for that. he thanks you 1 for that. 2 now, number 22. the engle findings. 3 the engle findings, the judge read these 4 to you. this is what the engle jury 5 determined. the supreme court said this stands 6 once you find that ed is a member of the engle 7 class. 8 is he a member of the engle class? of 9 course he is. 10 let us take a look at the verdict form. 11 this is the verdict form you are going to be 12 getting. 13 the first question you have to answer is: 14 was ed caprio a member of the engle class 15 essentially? 16 was ed caprio addicted to cigarettes 17 containing nicotine, and if so, was such 18 addiction a legal cause of mr. caprio's copd? 19 (there was a telephone interruption.) 20 mr. gdanski: it is a tradition. 21 mr. hammer: was it? of course it was. 22 so we would ask you to check off "yes." 23 and each of these cigarettes, philip 24 morris, lorillard, and r.j. reynolds, did their 25 cigarettes cause them? yes. that is what he 1 smoked. 2 he smoked philip morris cigarettes, 3 marlboros, he smoked kents. when he switched, 4 he smoked winstons. he smoked their products. 5 so, of course, those cigarettes, each one 6 of them that he smoked, caused his copd. 7 that is a threshold question to determine 8 whether or not -- let us go to the engle 9 findings in this case. to determine whether or 10 not the engle findings apply to this case. 11 it is a threshold question. it should be 12 a no-brainer. it should be simple. a simple 13 question to answer. 14 now, was ed addicted to the cigarettes? 15 of course he was. 16 go to slide 8. 17 this is what he smoked. all these 18 different brands. this is what he started out 19 with liggett, but he only smoked a handful. 20 started out with chesterfields. 21 then he went to r.j. reynolds' products; 22 lucky strike, camels. 23 philip morris, lorillard, again back to 24 philip morris, marlboro lights. continued with 25 philip morris, and then he smoked winston 1 lights, an r.j. reynolds product. 2 that is why these companies are liable for 3 his injuries. liable for his copd. that is 4 what he smoked. 5 now, defense will probably get up here 6 and say it was not his addiction that caused his 7 copd. it was not his addiction. it was his 8 choices. it was his failure to quit. 9 but you know what? nobody chooses 10 addiction. nobody chooses addiction. 11 and, you know, dr. dorce came in here and 12 she is harvard, yale grad. very impressive. 13 she is an addiction expert in heroin, cocaine, 14 opiates, pills. she works up in palm beach at 15 a facility that treats inpatient. 16 and what did she tell you? well, what 17 was interesting is she tells you that she also 18 treats nicotine addiction. however, at her 19 facility, they recommend their patients to 20 bring a carton of cigarettes with them. the 21 people that are addicted to nicotine, bring 22 your drug with you. 23 she is not focusing on nicotine addiction. 24 she may be a great addiction specialist with 25 regard to heroin and cocaine, but she does not 1 know a whole lot about nicotine addiction. she 2 has not written on it, she has not published on 3 it. 4 we brought you people who devoted their 5 lives to nicotine and to tobacco and nicotine 6 addiction. 7 dr. seidman, dr. mannino, people that 8 contributed to the surgeon general's reports. 9 these are all in evidence. people contributed 10 to these reports. 11 we brought you reputable, world-renowned 12 doctors that specialize in nicotine addiction. 13 they brought you dr. dorce, and she said 14 under the criteria of the dsm-5, that ed's not 15 addicted. 16 well, okay. well, let us take a look at 17 the dsm-5. and go to 36. 18 video technician: 36 or 12? 19 mr. hammer: i'm sorry, 12. you are 20 right. i apologize. number 12. 21 she talked about the dsm-5, and she said, 22 well, he meets two other criteria, so he is got 23 a tobacco disorder. but it does not rise to the 24 level of addiction. 25 and then mr. gdanski you remember was 1 asking her questions about, well, what about 2 this one, what about that one? 3 and he asked her the one about -- which 4 one is it, number 8. recurrent tobacco use in 5 situations in which it is physically hazardous. 6 and she said, no, he does not fit that. 7 let us put up the next slide. 8 she said -- in fact, there was a medical 9 record that jon said: well, he smoked by his 10 oxygen tank. 11 she said: yeah, but he knew the risk. 12 well, that fits that criteria right 13 there. a man that is sitting here on oxygen, 14 lights up a cigarette? come on. 15 he fits that criteria. that is a lot more 16 dangerous than smoking in bed. and yet she 17 said he does not fit that criteria. 18 you know, unfortunately, i do not think 19 dr. dorce was an unbiased, unprejudicial 20 witness. she was an expert witness that was 21 paid by the tobacco companies to come in here 22 and say that ed does not meet the criteria. 23 and yet she could not argue with 24 mr. gdanski when he asked her about all those 25 other definitions. 1 now, i think 36, right? 2 about whether or not tobacco was highly 3 addictive. and she kept saying: well, highly, 4 i do not know about highly. it can be 5 addictive. 6 and she kept saying: well, i do not know, 7 you know, it could be. it could not be. 8 and it sounded a lot like -- i do not know 9 if you remember when we were playing the videos 10 with dr. proctor, there was that woman anne 11 browder that talked for the tobacco industry. 12 and she said: well, it could be, it may not 13 be. and that seemed to be the tagline for 14 tobacco all those years in the conspiracy. 15 and, you know, dr. dorce, she followed 16 that tagline. it can be addictive. it may be, 17 it may not be. 18 and she actually -- this is what kind of 19 boggles the mind. 20 mr. seiden: objection, litigation 21 objection. 22 the court: overruled. 23 mr. hammer: a woman who treats people 24 with heroin, cocaine, opiates, pain killer 25 addiction, when jon -- when mr. gdanski asked 1 her: well, doctor, how about heroin, is that 2 addictive? 3 well, it can be. 4 seriously? heroin, crack cocaine can be? 5 use your common sense. crack cocaine, by 6 its very nature, is addictive. heroin is 7 addictive. all of those drugs are addictive 8 drugs. she was using the tobacco tagline. and 9 that is because she is a tobacco expert. 10 now, the other things you are going to be 11 asked to do on this verdict form is state 12 whether mr. caprio reasonably relied upon any 13 statements made after may '82 which concealed 14 or omitted information and whether he 15 reasonably relied to his detriment on any 16 statement made after '82 in furtherance of the 17 conspiracy. 18 well, mr. caprio started smoking when he 19 was 15 years old. he started with the 20 non-filtered cigarettes and then switched to 21 filters, because he did not like the tobacco in 22 his teeth. 23 remember, he told you about that? 24 but then he stayed smoking filters for 25 the rest of his life. and he relied upon the 1 fact -- ultimately, he switched to kent, 2 because kent, by lorillard, came out with a 3 safer filter, a charcoal filter. that is why he 4 switched to kent. he told you that. 5 that is in the '60s, right when all the 6 information started coming out. and he said to 7 you: there was confusion. and there was 8 confusion generated by the tobacco companies. 9 now, i'm sure the defense will get up 10 here and say, well, wait a minute. what 11 statement did he rely on? we asked mr. caprio, 12 what statement. did you see any of these 13 statements? 14 well, no, but all of those statements 15 formed the public's information. they formed 16 what america relied upon. they formed what ed 17 caprio relied upon, and he relied upon the ads 18 that said filters are safer. 19 and then what did he do? he switched to 20 lights. when it became known, more known that 21 cigarettes may be dangerous or are dangerous, 22 what did tobacco companies do? they came out 23 with light cigarettes, light cigarettes. 24 and he switched to light cigarettes. 25 why? because the ads said, not necessarily 1 said "they are safer," but they certainly 2 implied that. 3 and the tobacco companies duped him. he 4 told you: i was duped. 5 and he continued smoking lights until he 6 finally quit. and what is so significant is 7 that when he meets up with bryan, bryan is 8 smoking regulars. bryan and he get together, 9 and ed convinces bryan to switch to light 10 cigarettes. 11 in the late '80s, close to '90s, bryan 12 told you: i switched to lights. why? because 13 ed told me they are safer. smoke lights, they 14 are safer. 15 well, so did ed rely, continue to smoke 16 light cigarettes based on something this 17 tobacco company said or did, or omitted to say? 18 it is kind of hard to rely on something that is 19 omitted. but of course he did. 20 it is kind of -- how do you know if 21 somebody omits it from you? they do not tell 22 you if they conspire to conceal it. well, 23 that is what they did, they conspired to conceal 24 it, and ed relied upon the light cigarettes 25 into the '80s, beyond '82. 1 and that is why you should check these 2 boxes off. 3 and, you know, now, liggett, they will get 4 up here and tell you, well, we were not part of 5 the initial conspiracy in 1953. we did not sign 6 on to the frank statement until 1954. 7 dr. proctor will tell you, no, they 8 did not. 9 but they became part of it, and they 10 contributed to it. they did. that is why they 11 should be held responsible as well. 12 now, the other thing we are going to have 13 to ask you about is talk about fault. talking 14 about fault. 15 well, what did ed caprio know about 16 smoking cigarettes? well, he did know 17 eventually that smoking cigarettes can be 18 harmful. he did learn smoking cigarettes can 19 cause disease. 20 i mean, he had family members that got 21 sick. i'm sure the defense will point out that 22 john's uncle -- i'm sorry, john's father, ed's 23 uncle, got sick and had copd. i'm sure they 24 will point that out to you. 25 so he should have known better. you know 1 what? maybe he should have. but you know 2 what? these guys really knew what was going 3 on. 4 and had they told the world the truth in 5 1954, instead of forming that conspiracy, had 6 they said -- and taken out the frank statement 7 and said, hey, smoking is linked to cancer, you 8 ought to quit now, guess what? 9 if they did that in 1954, hey, smoking is 10 linked to cancer, we are stopping, we are not 11 going to make our product anymore. guess what? 12 ed would never have been able to smoke that 13 first cigarette in 1958, if they lived up to 14 their promises. 15 but instead, they decided to form a 16 conspiracy and hide the truth for the next 50, 17 60 years, hide the truth from people like ed 18 caprio. 19 so what kind of responsibility should ed 20 have had? really, when you think of it in 21 light of the tobacco companies? 22 i would say -- i would suggest to you 23 that each of the tobacco companies should share 24 the blame. liggett, maybe a little bit less 25 because they joined the conspiracy later. they 1 got out earlier. 2 and ed, a total of 5 percent. 3 mr. cofer: objection, your honor. may 4 we approach, please? 5 the court: sure. 6 (the following discussion was held at 7 sidebar:) 8 mr. cofer: i move for mistrial. i move 9 for mistrial. 10 they should be estopped from arguing that 11 he accepts any responsibility. 12 mr. hammer represented in jury selection 13 that he accepted no responsibility; that we 14 were one hundred percent at fault. they used that 15 argument to kick people off the jury, and now 16 they cannot -- having kicked people off the jury 17 and taking that position, they cannot now come 18 back and try to seem reasonable. 19 they are judicially estopped from that, 20 so you neither need to instruct the jury that 21 it is one hundred percent at fault or we need a 22 mistrial. 23 mr. hammer: judge, i totally disagree 24 with defense. 25 the court: i do, too. i'll deny that 1 request for mistrial. 2 mr. cofer: you know what i want to do? 3 then i want to admit their prior petitions, 4 their prior complaints where they admitted 5 fault, and they then backed off and got you to 6 let them say they are no longer at fault. 7 they use ed as both a -- in their words, 8 a sword and a shield. you cannot do that. you 9 cannot take the position to kick people off the 10 jury, and once you get the jury you think you 11 want, you completely change your position for 12 the jury you had. 13 the court: i'm going to deny that 14 request. 15 (sidebar discussion concluded, and the 16 following was held in open court:) 17 mr. hammer: may i proceed, judge? 18 the court: if the court reporter is 19 ready. 20 the reporter: i'm ready. 21 mr. hammer: you know, you should say, 22 hey, ed should not be held responsible at all. 23 and we do not think he should be. 24 but -- but -- if you think ed could have 25 tried harder, if you think ed maybe should have 1 quit earlier, his share of the responsibility 2 pales in comparison to these guys. that is why 3 i say if you are going to fault ed at all, fault 4 him 5 percent, at most. because these guys, 5 what they did is reprehensible. 6 mr. schlesinger is going to talk to you 7 about that, about the reprehensible conduct, 8 and why they should be punished. 9 now, the other thing you are going to be 10 asked to do is determine the amount of money 11 sustained by ed caprio with respect to the 12 following elements. 13 one of them is ... there is been a 14 stipulation with regard to the amount of money 15 involved as far as past lost wages, as far as 16 past medical costs, and as far as future 17 medical expenses. 18 the stipulation of past lost wages of 19 $206,158. stipulation of past medical costs of 20 $103,014. and future medical expenses of 21 $75,000 a year in the future. 22 and we read to you the life tables, the 23 life tables, according to the national 24 consensus bureau, centers for disease control. 25 they say a man of ed's age should live to about 1 another 13-1/2 years. 2 and you may think he should live less, he 3 may live longer. we do not know. but we would 4 submit to you that he hopefully has another 5 13-1/2 years left. 6 and so 13-1/2 times 75,000 is $1,012,500, 7 for a total of economic loss of $1,321,672. 8 thank you. 9 now, you are also going to be asked to 10 determine what damages ed deserves for pain and 11 suffering. 12 you know, ed has been on this oxygen 13 tank. he lives every day in fear that his 14 oxygen might run out. he lives every day 15 without this oxygen like a fish out of water. 16 he told you about this lung cancer 17 surgery he had, a lifesaving operation where 18 they removed two lobes of his lung as a result 19 of an epidemic that these companies created, 20 lung cancer, which was not existent before 21 cigarettes. remember, dr. proctor told you, 22 lung cancer, if a doctor saw that in the 1900s, 23 he would call the medical students together, 24 look at lung cancer. 25 and now it is rampant, one of the number 1 one killers in the nation. it is unbelievable. 2 and it was created by these companies. 3 ed has pain to this day as a result of 4 that surgery. pain to this day. he described 5 for you what they had to do to cut open his 6 body. he is got a scar going from front to 7 back. he feels it every day of his life. 8 how do you compensate somebody for that? 9 i would suggest to you that a fair compensation 10 is $12 million, for a total award of 11 $13,321,672. 12 that is fair, that is just. for a man that 13 sits here today a cripple. and he only sits 14 here today a cripple as a result of their 15 product. this product kills more people than 16 the number of bullets have killed people in the 17 war. dr. proctor told you that. 18 mr. bideau: objection, your honor. 19 the court: overruled. 20 mr. hammer: that is crazy. 21 and yet, yeah, it is legal. but you know 22 what? a responsible company would have done 23 what they promised back in 1954. they would 24 have looked out for their customers, and they 25 would have shut down. 1 yeah, it is legal. but they would have 2 done the right thing. because in this country, 3 corporations do not do that. in this country, 4 if you are going to make a product, stand behind 5 it. 6 if you are going to make a product and it 7 hurts people, fix it. if you are going to make 8 a product and it kills people, then stop making 9 it. it is not a lot to ask. 10 but you know what? they just cannot do 11 it. they cannot help themselves. you know why? 12 because for them, it is all about money. it is 13 all about money. 14 and that is why when you are asked should 15 these companies be punished, absolutely. they 16 deserve to be punished, they need to be 17 punished. they need to be told, hey, look, you 18 cannot do this. we -- this jury, you, who 19 decide this case, we cannot accept this kind of 20 behavior. 21 shut these boxes off and let us go on to 22 a punitive damage phase. it is going to be very 23 short. very short. 24 mr. schlesinger is going to talk to you a 25 little bit more and talk about the conduct of 1 these companies. 2 but as you sit there, think about ed. 3 show some of the photos. 4 think about ed caprio, think about the 5 fact he sits here before you, as he told you, a 6 proud gay man. he got married last month. 7 finally, his dream fulfilled. thirty-two years 8 he is been with the same person. 9 that is amazing in this day and age that 10 couples can stay together that long. and now 11 he is married. he hopes to live a long life 12 with bryan. 13 ed sits here before you, and it is been 14 our honor and our privilege to represent him in 15 front of you all. 16 i ask you to listen carefully to 17 mr. schlesinger's argument. i ask you to 18 listen carefully to the defense argument, and 19 see what they have to say. because i've got 20 news for you, folks. this case is important to 21 them, and it is important to mr. caprio. 22 the case is going to be in your hands 23 soon, and we look forward to talking to you 24 some more about punitive damages. 25 thank you, judge. 12 mr. schlesinger: may it please the 13 court. counsel. ladies and gentlemen of the 14 jury. 15 good morning. i'm scott schlesinger, and 16 i've been with you for as much of this trial as 17 i could be. circumstances have impaired some 18 of my involvement in the case, nothing you need 19 to worry about, but i am glad to be here. 20 i'm busting to be able to talk to you. 21 so i've tried to pay close attention to what is 22 going on with this case as best i can, read the 23 transcripts, keep up with my great trial team 24 who really stepped up and supported me when i 25 needed help from them. 1 it is a wonderful thing. nothing that is 2 any of your business, but just -- we have a 3 great trial team, and we do these cases in a 4 lot of different places. 5 so if you will indulge me, even though 6 you do not know me. i missed your jury 7 selection process, so i have not developed a 8 comfort level with you. 9 you do not know me to know is this guy 10 trustworthy? i have not seen how he is acting. 11 so if you will take one thing from me at face 12 value, i will not intentionally mislead you 13 about anything that is happened in this court or 14 evidence in the case. 15 if your collective recollection differs 16 than anything that i say, rely on your 17 collective recollection. okay? 18 my job is to talk to you about an 19 enterprise of death, a great historical wrong 20 that brings us into this courtroom in the 21 united states of america to pursue a system of 22 justice that only we have, where the mighty and 23 powerful can be on -- brought to bear to be on 24 equal footing with regular folks like us. 25 i want to talk about that, talk about 1 some of the evidence that came in with regard 2 to wrongful conduct by the tobacco companies. 3 now, let us just start right here. 4 okay. and you will see that in 5 evidence -- you actually have these textbooks 6 in evidence. now, these books are the surgeon 7 general's reports. they are the -- our top 8 health agency, our federal agency, the surgeon 9 general. 10 this is for the health and welfare and 11 the public good. this is for the benefit and 12 the well-being of the health of americans. 13 and we hopefully honored this process by 14 bringing you heavyweight experts who 15 contributed to this -- to the chapters in these 16 books who were senior scientific reviewers, who 17 hew to the truth of medicine and science as we 18 know it. 19 and even a book like this, that is just 20 published in 2014, a year ago, where even 21 dr. proctor went to the white house to attend 22 the unveiling of this book, because he was such 23 an important contributor to it. 24 you can get this book free from the 25 government. every one of you. get five 1 copies. they will send it to you for free. 2 they will even pay the mailing. 3 but this is the statement of the truth 4 about tobacco, and it is news. because, even 5 in 2014, they continue to say we have an 6 industrially driven epidemic. 7 the tobacco epidemic is not about people 8 smoking, it is about an industry that -- the 9 epidemic is persistent. not because kids are 10 reckless, but rather, because a powerful 11 industry depends upon its perpetuation. that is 12 where the tobacco epidemic has come from. 13 and now, as recently as 2014, they have 14 begun to focus on the role that the tobacco 15 industry has played, because they, too, have 16 had a decade or more now to research the 17 internal secret documents that did not 18 previously exist. 19 imagine what a different world we would 20 live in if all of those research of scientists 21 that the internal documents at those -- that 22 the tobacco industry had. if they had that out 23 in the open and contributed to the knowledge of 24 the public health authority, all the things we 25 would have learned, how much sooner we would 1 have learned it. but we did not, because it was 2 all withheld. 3 now that it is not withheld, the surgeon 4 general and all the myriad of professors and 5 authorities that are contributing to this 6 document are using those internal documents to 7 learn things they never knew. 8 the secrets that tobacco held in their 9 own laboratories about how they knew it was 10 addictive, how they celebrated addiction. 11 addiction was the center of their universe. it 12 was the sine qua non, nicotine -- without 13 nicotine, there was no business. 14 so one of the things that is here, the 15 major conclusions, you can turn right to them. 16 you have this in evidence. you can turn to 17 major conclusions and you can read. 18 this is on page 7. scientific basis of 19 report. this is all heavily vetted, 20 peer-reviewed literature. 21 take a look at something like this. and 22 what they say is, in major conclusion number 1: 23 an enormous avoidable public health tragedy, 24 the century-long epidemic. more than 25 20 million premature deaths. 1 i challenge the tobacco defendants, the 2 cigarette lawyers who will come up. 3 mr. tepikian, who may be a nice guy, but he is 4 not philip morris. he is an attorney 5 representing philip morris. 6 and i challenge him to come up here and 7 say, we have been responsible for the deaths of 8 20 million. or do not even say that. we agree 9 there have been 20 million deaths from tobacco. 10 but you will not hear that. because much as 11 we are asking you to say, this case is about 12 punishment. this case is about correcting a 13 historical wrongdoing. part of it is no 14 acknowledgment of past wrongdoing, which 15 requires further deterrence. 16 when we ask you to consider this case as 17 one which merits a penalty, a fine, punishment, 18 it is because we ask you to see the truth of 19 this case as it is unfolded in this courtroom 20 and in the evidence that you have available to 21 look at, as something that calls out from you 22 for an expression of moral condemnation for 23 quasi criminal behavior by the tobacco 24 companies -- 25 mr. bideau: objection, your honor. 1 mr. schlesinger: -- and you will see that 2 as we go. 3 the court: sustained. 4 mr. bideau: move to strike. 5 the court: i'll strike it. 6 the jury is to disregard. 7 mr. schlesinger: i have case law 8 supporting that statement, judge. but i'll 9 move on. 10 the court: okay. 11 mr. schlesinger: now, then, the tobacco 12 epidemic was initiated and was sustained by the 13 aggressive strategies of the tobacco industry 14 which has deliberately misled the public on the 15 risks of smoking cigarettes. 16 you see? 17 in 2010, 2012, 2014, the most recent 18 pronouncements with wonderful pieces of data 19 that you really should take a moment to look 20 through, if you have a chance back there. 21 here is a conclusion that says, it is not 22 about let us quit smoking and try harder to 23 quit. 24 it is about a tobacco epidemic that was 25 initiated and sustained by the aggressive 1 strategies of the tobacco industry which has 2 deliberately misled the public on the risks of 3 smoking cigarettes. 4 and what do they also say? what is a big 5 point of this document here which also says 6 that 40 million people are caught in the web of 7 addiction? we will get to that. 8 that is all the smokers. 40 million 9 people. over half a million deaths a year. 10 one-third of all cancer deaths. one in five of 11 all deaths of americans in this country. 12 imagine you went to a cemetery, and every 13 fifth headstone had a little no smoking symbol 14 on it. 15 mr. bideau: objection, your honor. 16 the court: overruled. 17 mr. schlesinger: that is how broad this 18 epidemic is. we are inured to it. i say it is 19 an irrational madness that hides in plain 20 sight, you know, because cigarettes look like 21 normal consumer products. and they are nothing 22 but drugs. all these are, are drugs. 23 that is all this is. that is all this is, 24 that is all it ever was. but it looks like a 25 normal consumer product. and where it is hard 1 to wrap your mind around it, but this is drugs. 2 that is all it is. that is all it is ever been. 3 a cigarette is a delivery device, a 4 vehicle, a delivery device for nicotine. the 5 product is not the cigarette. the cigarette is 6 the package. the product is nicotine. the 7 nicotine that hits the brain faster, 8 intravenous in less than ten seconds. 9 and a person like ed caprio has smoked 10 over half a million cigarettes. and every 11 puff, every cigarette is 8 to 10 puffs. 12 5 million hits of the drug nicotine to the 13 brain. 5 million hits. who does that but for 14 the nicotine? 15 taste? pleasure? satisfaction? pep? 16 it gives you a lift? these are nonsense terms. 17 these are the terms of an advertising and 18 marketing culture that is spent a quarter of a 19 trillion dollars to convince people that they 20 were doing something fun with a cigarette. 21 nobody smokes on a clock, day in and day 22 out, a pack, two packs a day, hundreds of hits 23 of nicotine to the brain. except the drug is 24 short-lasting, it goes to the brain, the brain 25 is rewired, it becomes full of receptors that 1 scream for that nicotine, and folks become 2 hopeless addicts. 3 now, when they set out to hook their 4 customers, they are hooking children. that is 5 the basis of the business. that is the dirty 6 little secret that hides in plain sight. 7 and when you see documents -- and i 8 believe mr. seidman held one up from diane 9 burrows from 1984 that clearly said, hey, you 10 know, we have got to get these 12-year-olds. all 11 smoking is based on youth. 12 but by that time, they had a new code 13 word. 14 mr. seiden: objection, misstates the 15 evidence. 16 the court: overruled. 17 mr. schlesinger: they had a new code 18 word. and the code word was, do not call them 19 youth anymore. call them young adults. 20 well, why would it be that in a secret 21 1984 diane burrows document, there would be so 22 many references to the word "young adults." 23 that is because in 1975, you saw the pittman 24 document where they said, you know what? we 25 better change reference to the word "youth" to 1 reference to young adults. 2 it was a code word for 12-year-olds, 3 13-year-olds, 14-year-olds, 15-year-olds. but 4 it was in the secret document. 5 why? because it is so incendiary, it is 6 so outside the bounds of moral human decency of 7 what regular folks, human beings that care for 8 one another, that should be protecting 9 children, not addicting them, that in the event 10 that those documents ever got out, which they 11 ultimately did a decade after the lawsuit shook 12 loose the documents, they could come in now and 13 say, look, it says "young adult." 14 but we have got the goods on them. we 15 showed you the document that said, do not call 16 the youth -- the 12-year-olds, the 17 13-year-olds, the 14-year-olds, do not call them 18 youth, call them young adults. 19 just like dr. proctor said that we have a 20 code word that they use for lung cancer. and 21 what is that code word? zephyr. and what is 22 zephyr? zephyr is a warm, nurturing breeze. 23 everybody loves a zephyr during an indian 24 summer, not an ill wind of lung cancer. 25 so these are some of the things that i 1 want you to reflect on. 2 in any event, they called for the end of 3 this epidemic by getting rid of cigarettes. 4 that is what dr. proctor said. he believes in 5 abolition, and his book says, right on the 6 cover: abolish cigarettes. it is a laudable 7 goal. it makes sense. 8 there is no redeeming basis to 9 cigarettes. and for an industry to get away 10 with a conspiracy for 50 years that killed 11 20 million americans is -- it does not meet with 12 the bounds of moral humanity or decency. 13 i put up mount everest. why do i do 14 that? because remember dr. mannino talked 15 about just how rare it is for a man like ed 16 caprio to be an engle class member that was way 17 back in '92, '93, '94, '95, '96? 18 you guys thought jon talked fast, right? 19 i have got a lot to cover. so you will get most 20 of it. i know you will not get -- but i -- you 21 know, let it wash over you, get the impression 22 from me. and if i do it too fast, again, i 23 apologize. 24 just thanks for listening to me. you 25 guys never met me before. 1 so mount everest -- and here is the 2 thing. you guys are here for a historic moment 3 in time. 4 mr. cofer: objection, your honor, 5 improper argument. 6 ms. ruiz: objection. 7 the court: overruled. 8 mr. schlesinger: this is an important 9 moment in time. you guys are on the cutting 10 edge of important litigation going on all 11 around this state, the engle progeny class 12 litigation. it is going on right in this 13 courtroom as we speak. 14 and the thing is, ed is a rare, rare, 15 rare breed. most engle progeny folks are dead, 16 and their family members are here. 17 mr. cofer: objection, lack of 18 foundation, and improper argument. 19 the court: overruled. 20 mr. schlesinger: dr. mannino testified 21 to this. he said it is extraordinarily rare. 22 and i submit to you that mount everest, 23 as seen from the rongbuk monastery, the north 24 face of everest in tibet, that there are more 25 people that have stood at the top of that 1 mountain than have lived to face philip morris 2 in a courtroom, in a court of law, and face 3 them for what they accuse them to do. 4 so this is a rare and special moment, and 5 we call upon you to think about that and rise 6 to the occasion. because this is a case in 7 which you all probably hold now more power than 8 you have ever held in your entire lives, and more 9 power than you will ever hold -- 10 ms. ruiz: objection. 11 mr. cofer: objection, your honor. 12 the court: i will sustain the objection. 13 mr. cofer: ask to strike. 14 the court: i'll strike it. jury is to 15 disregard it. 16 go right ahead, sir. 17 mr. schlesinger: when i talk about the 18 power, i mean the jury instructions empower you 19 to follow the law and apply the law. 20 we will get to the law in a minute. 21 right here, what business is this company 22 in? what business is this company in? this is 23 just rjr's website. philip morris has a 24 similar website. this is one of the things 25 they say about tobacco and health. they have got 1 a mark up there. 2 and it says -- it says: consider the 3 conclusions of the u.s. surgeon general. 4 that is why you have got these reports. they say, 5 rely on the surgeon general. they admit the 6 surgeon general now is the place to go. 7 but here is what is more important. the 8 best course of action for tobacco consumers 9 concerned about their health is to quit. 10 and then it says: minors should not use 11 tobacco products, and adults who do not use or 12 have quit using products should not start. 13 so i'm scratching my head. what is the 14 business of tobacco? if this is sincere, as 15 opposed to insincere, as opposed to marketing 16 pap, then here is the question. what business 17 are they in? 18 if what they do is something that they 19 recommend nobody do, and anyone who is doing it 20 should quit, then why are they in business? 21 why are they making the cigarettes when they 22 said over and over again in the '60s, '70s, and 23 the '80s, if it is ever proven to be harmful, 24 we will quit making it? 25 how different would the world be if they 1 had done that? and how stronger would our 2 nation have been, because it weakens a nation 3 to kill off its citizenry 540 -- 4 mr. cofer: objection, your honor, 5 improper argument. move to strike. 6 the court: overruled. 7 mr. schlesinger: 540,000 people a year. 8 you learned in this courtroom for the first 9 time a brand-new finding. it is not 484,000 a 10 year -- 11 mr. cofer: objection, your honor. for 12 the record, 401, 402, williams-state farm. 13 lack of foundation. 14 the court: overruled. 15 go ahead. 16 mr. schlesinger: you learned a brand-new 17 fact in this courtroom, which is that it is not 18 484,000. 19 i jumped ahead. do not look at that yet. 20 finish this thought. 21 it is 540,000 a year, because there is new 22 research out. i found this very interesting, 23 where a bunch of universities came out and 24 research, it got in the new york times -- 25 mr. cofer: objection, lack of 1 foundation. there was no testimony about this. 2 there was an article in the new york times. 3 the court: overrule the objection. 4 please, no speaking objections. 5 go ahead. 6 mr. schlesinger: you heard about the 7 research in the new england journal of 8 medicine. there is a fresh off-the-press report 9 in the new york times. dr. mannino talked 10 about it. all of a sudden, it is 540,000 a 11 year. that is 1400 people a day dying. 12 there is nothing we ever see on the 13 evening news that compares with the calamity of 14 cigarette-related death and destruction. 15 there is just nothing that compares to it. 16 it is weird what -- depending on what you 17 learn. you guys have now joined and gone to 18 the college of tobacco knowledge. right? 19 you heard about the defense having the 20 traveling truth squad and these words to try to 21 suggest that they were out to have the truth 22 when really they were confusing it. but you have 23 learned stuff now that folks have not learned. 24 and in realtime, right in this courtroom, fresh 25 information came in. 1 cigarettes are even more dangerous and 2 deadly than imagined. how much worse can it 3 get? 4 so believability of witnesses. this is 5 an important instruction that was read. i want 6 to reflect on a couple things, because you 7 heard different experts. you heard our 8 experts, you heard their experts. 9 but you also heard our treatings. and 10 remember, the treatings are independent 11 eyewitnesses. they are standing on the corner 12 when a car wreck happens at the intersection, 13 and they are just saying what they saw. 14 those treatings, herrera, patel, the rest 15 of them, the other folks whose record says 16 "tobacco addiction," they had nothing to do 17 with litigation. their record is organic. 18 it is natural. it is credible. it is believable. 19 it has no interest in the outcome of the 20 proceedings. it is not about anything having to 21 do with a specially retained expert for a court 22 trial. 23 that record was chock full of references 24 to addiction. are you going to disagree with 25 the record that is the natural record of 1 doctors who cared about the patient as they 2 were treating him? 3 of course he was addicted. but the point 4 is, there is two kinds of witnesses and two 5 kinds of instructions for believability. this 6 is how i say you are empowered. you have the 7 right to do stuff. 8 you may say, wait a second. i'm not a 9 doc. i heard these docs testifying. how do i 10 know? maybe i have to accept what they want to 11 say. 12 and i say, some of the doctors they 13 brought in were not worthy of belief, should be 14 rejected by you. 15 and guess what? the court empowers you 16 with this instruction right here, which is 17 different than the regular witnesses, which is 18 just what is their believability, what is their 19 lack of frankness, what interest do they have 20 in the outcome, what is their body language, how 21 do they look? 22 it is not just what they say. it is 23 everything about what you observe when you are 24 observing. it is part of the reason why we 25 do not want you to get too deep -- caught up in 1 the notes. it is because you have got to look at 2 people. you have got to eyeball them. 3 the psychologists say eighty percent of 4 communication is nonverbal. i mean, look at 5 me, i'm moving around like a spaz in front of 6 you guys. so they say that communication could 7 be nonverbal. 8 but the point is this. with an expert, 9 you can accept an expert's opinion. you can 10 look at his credentials. 11 but here is what i like, the power. you 12 can reject it. therefore, with all due respect 13 to witnesses that deserve to be rejected, 14 dr. dorce, i'm sorry to say, who comes here and 15 does what dr. proctor told you they always do, 16 and that is to deny anybody could be in the 17 engle class. 18 and the logic is flawed. because the 19 logic is, oh, you could have quit. well, you 20 did not quit. if you did not quit, you should 21 have quit. you did not quit. 22 it is got nothing to do with engle. 23 mr. seiden: objection, litigation. 24 the court: overruled. go ahead. 25 mr. schlesinger: it is a misconstruction 1 of the dependence of nicotine, which is one of 2 the most highly addictive drugs anywhere. 3 in any event, you have the right to 4 reject. that is the power. i put that up 5 there. i was looking for a straw man. that is 6 a scarecrow. but call it a straw man. what is 7 a straw man? a straw man is like a false 8 logical construct. 9 there is two of them i want to address. 10 the first one is, dr. dorce using the dsm-5. 11 now, his honor has not read you an 12 instruction. you will not hear an instruction. 13 there is no law that says anything about the 14 dsm-5 being the applicable test that determines 15 addiction. 16 here is what is really interesting. 17 if you had a motivation to not find 18 somebody addicted, what better book to go to 19 than the dsm-5, which does not have a diagnosis 20 of addiction? 21 it is like saying, well, you know that 22 book, the hobbit by tolkien, he is not addicted 23 under that book. 24 well, the dsm does not have addiction in 25 the book. but every other test for addiction 1 that is in the surgeon general '10, which has 2 an entire chapter starting on page 105 -- write 3 it down, read it, and read the summary in 4 there. and the very first word is nicotine is 5 the fundamental reason people persist in using 6 tobacco products. and this persistent use is 7 what contributes to the diseases in the book, 8 including emphysema and including lung cancer. 9 so using a book that does not diagnose 10 addiction because it does not have an addiction 11 diagnosis in the book, and then saying, i 12 could not find that person addicted in that 13 book, i'm like, i need a v8. what are you 14 talking about? 15 that cannot be possible. you have to use 16 something that is relevant. all things that 17 relate to addiction in this case overwhelmingly 18 point to dependence. 19 and here's the thing. the engle finding 20 says nicotine is addictive. well, the engle 21 finding was a war and a trial that took a year, 22 where the defendants denied that it was 23 addictive. now the finding is it is addictive. 24 those findings are binding on you. and i say 25 you can -- and the instructions say they cannot 1 be denied. you must embrace them and 2 incorporate them. nicotine is addictive. 3 so when you get up and try to say, under 4 this book, which does not do addiction, i do not 5 see addiction, that is a reputation of the 6 engle finding, which is the binding law on this 7 case. 8 mr. bideau: object, your honor. 9 misstates the law, and definition. 10 the court: overruled. go ahead. 11 mr. schlesinger: it is a repudiation of 12 the binding engle finding. 13 so you can think about that and apply 14 what we know the law is and find that it is 15 addictive. and if not him, who? because this 16 man smoked an awful lot. 17 something else is, when you smoke despite 18 harmful consequences, that is a key indication 19 of addiction. 20 so dependence on nicotine, the drug, i 21 think is clear. 22 the straw man is the dsm-5, trying to say 23 that is what is applicable. 24 here is another straw man. something 25 very interesting. i'll do this very quickly 1 with you. you remember, remember 2 communication, nonverbal. okay. 3 dr. proctor -- no, seidman, first medical 4 expert. well-credentialed. he wrote books on 5 addiction. so they could say, hey, did not you 6 say in this book people are addicted. 7 dr. dorce does not have a book on 8 addiction. we could have seen the position if 9 she had a book or a paper or research on 10 addiction. she testified even in violation of 11 her own society of addiction medicine rules -- 12 mr. cofer: objection, your honor. 13 mr. schlesinger: -- against having -- 14 the court: hold on, hold on, sir. 15 mr. cofer: improper argument about 16 dr. dorce's testimony. 17 the court: overruled. argument. 18 go ahead. 19 mr. schlesinger: she testified against 20 the asam, just like dr. andrews testified 21 against the ats guidelines. 22 why do medical health organizations have 23 guidelines discouraging doctors that are 24 members from involving themselves with tobacco? 25 it is to avoid the insidious and undermining 1 effect of tobacco, because of the historical 2 way in which they would infiltrate healthcare 3 institutions -- 4 mr. bideau: objection, lack of 5 foundation. 6 the court: overruled. go ahead. 7 mr. schlesinger: it would infiltrate 8 healthcare institutions and create either a 9 sign of credibility for tobacco companies or 10 research that was distraction or confusing. 11 and that is what dr. proctor talked about so 12 extensively with you. 13 but the other scarecrow here is this. 14 i've got to do it quick, because i'm on limited 15 time. 16 so, dr. seidman is on the witness stand. 17 now dr. seidman is being cross-examined. now 18 remember, we go first, they go last. you have 19 got to keep an open mind so that they get to 20 tell their side of the story, right? and we 21 get to go first. we are telling our side of the 22 story. but on cross-examination they get to 23 tell their side of the story, too, a little 24 bit. 25 so the first cross-examination of a 1 treating or an expert doctor on addiction was 2 seidman. and the defense counsel, that 3 represents the cigarette industry, says: you 4 did not treat him. if he was so addicted and 5 you are such a caring doctor, why did not you 6 treat him? 7 now a jury is sitting there, may not know 8 the ins and outs of that and they hear the body 9 language, the tone, the tenor, the voice and 10 say, yeah, man. why did not you treat him? 11 because it sounds like someone is 12 indignant and impairing the credibility of the 13 witness. well, if you really care, why did not 14 you treat him? 15 now let us unpack that. that is a word 16 people like to use here. let us unpack that. 17 why did not you, hired as a forensic expert with 18 no treatment relation with the patient, not 19 licensed to practice your psychological medical 20 services in the state of florida, violate your 21 ethical obligations and insinuate yourself into 22 the care when your only basis was to come here 23 and give expert testimony to help a jury 24 understand the medically complicated subject 25 such as addiction? 1 it was not until dr. dorce got up on the 2 witness stand that we took away that straw man. 3 the straw man being he should have treated, and 4 by not treating, you guys should think his 5 credibility is impaired. 6 and mr. gdanski, right out of the box, 7 said to dr. dorce. you did not treat him? no. 8 you would never treat him? no. you know the 9 forensic experts and folks who are coming to be 10 experts from out of state -- 11 mr. cofer: your honor, sidebar? 12 the court: sidebar. 13 mr. schlesinger: will you hold my time, 14 judge? 15 (the following discussion was held at 16 sidebar:) 17 mr. cofer: your honor. 18 the court: gentlemen, gentlemen. 19 mr. cofer: we need an instruction that 20 the defense experts cannot contact the 21 plaintiff, because the plaintiff is represented 22 by counsel. it would be improper, unless you 23 have the cme, which did happen. 24 however, their experts are retained by 25 mr. caprio through their lawyers. so, of 1 course, they can do whatever they want to do. 2 that is the difference. 3 mr. schlesinger: except there is no 4 evidence of that in the case. 5 the court: hold on, mr. schlesinger. 6 you will get your opportunity. 7 mr. cofer: that is the difference. they 8 have now misled the jury. legally we cannot 9 contact the plaintiff. their experts can. 10 so we at least need that instruction, 11 that the defense experts, defense lawyers 12 cannot talk to or contact the plaintiff, 13 because they do not represent them. 14 mr. schlesinger: fair comment on the 15 evidence. i'm definitely inferring from the 16 evidence, only commenting on the evidence. 17 mr. cofer: he is making fun of me and 18 attacking my credibility. 19 the court: i'm going to overrule the 20 objection. hold on. deny the request, and i 21 suspect you are going to ask if you can do this. 22 mr. cofer: i can address it in closing. 23 the court: sure. 24 mr. cofer: okay, fair enough. 25 (sidebar discussion concluded, and the 1 following was held in open court:) 2 mr. schlesinger: i'm going to start my 3 time again, judge. thank you. 4 so that is the other straw man, is to 5 intimate that there is some reason why someone 6 should have treated, when their own expert 7 acknowledged that no expert involved in these 8 cases would be treating or insinuating 9 themselves or anything like that. 10 so everything that dr. seidman did, 11 dr. mannino did was perfectly appropriate. and 12 that was an apparent credibility attack that 13 does not have validity. and you can think about 14 that. 15 and by the way, this is a mousetrap. 16 okay. here is what i say. build a better 17 mousetrap and the world will beat a path to 18 your door. 19 dr. proctor has achieved the status of 20 scholarship, harvard university, full professor 21 at stanford, he teaches on tobacco. 22 where is his book? he is got a book that 23 he published that is -- an incredible work of 24 scholarship, highly valid. anybody can read 25 it. you guys cannot read it now, but after 1 this, when the trial is over, anyone can study 2 anything they want and develop a story. 3 one of the interesting things with this 4 book, okay, that dr. proctor -- and it makes 5 the man a hero. he is an advocate for public 6 health. he is a big contributor to the surgeon 7 general reports, and what he is doing, he is 8 doing the right kind of work. 9 but what is interesting is that they did 10 not challenge him with a single solitary word 11 out of this 800-page book, with footnotes, 12 heavily footnoted, all referenced to tons of 13 internal documents, the scholarship of the 14 secrets of the industry, made open. 15 it will take decades for scholars to 16 fully digest the 60 million pages, and that 17 does not include the ones that dr. proctor said 18 were destroyed. 19 so this is an interesting element in the 20 case. they talked to dr. proctor. he seemed 21 agreeable with them. he gave them the points 22 they wanted. yeah, there was this, there was 23 that. but they never once took a word out of 24 this book and tried to discredit him. i 25 thought that was important. 1 build a better mousetrap and the world 2 will beat a path to your door. why do i say 3 that? because it is a false equivalency to put 4 an expert witness on the witness stand such as 5 andrews or dorce, who do not have a dedicated 6 specialty and have not committed their life to 7 helping smokers or researching nicotine or 8 understanding the scourge of diseases, and then 9 say, well, dr. proctor made money. 10 well, he earned that money. you know, 11 you earn money if you do something spectacular, 12 if you dedicate your life to something, and 13 then it turns out that what you did fulfills a 14 need, as it does in this litigation across the 15 state with all these engle smokers. 16 it fulfills the need one case at a time. 17 he is teaching jurors one jury at a time. he 18 built a better mousetrap. the world has beat a 19 path to his door. 20 it is a false equivalency to say that 21 dr. dorce was button-holed by a friend of the 22 tobacco industry, with no specialty in nicotine 23 addiction, and comes in and becomes an expert 24 and earns a tremendous amount of money. 25 there is two different purposes behind 1 one. one is a man who has paid his dues, 2 certainly deserves to make money. making good 3 money, doing good work. and the other is 4 someone who perhaps, you can consider the money 5 is a motivation to do something that does not 6 meet with credibility. 7 dr. andrews, it looks to me like he 8 joined the ats, which prohibited -- he worked 9 for tobacco, and in the aftermath, he quit the 10 ats because on balance at $900,000 and 11 counting, the money was more important than the 12 professional society that dedicates its members 13 to the helping of sick people. 14 so that is something to think about. and 15 by the way, this book, all three of these 16 books, look at the beginning of the book. 17 there is pages and pages and pages of 18 contributors, professors, scientists, public 19 health officials; a universe of them. 20 why could not the tobacco industry bring 21 one of those witnesses in who really dedicated 22 their lives to cigarette issues and nicotine 23 addiction, or any of that? out of a universe? 24 because uniformly the truth is what you heard 25 from mannino and seidman and patel and herrera. 1 and herrera -- 2 mr. bideau: objection, your honor, 3 improper argument. 4 the court: overruled. 5 go ahead. 6 mr. schlesinger: i dug herrera, because 7 he was like, let us cut through all this, you 8 know, chitchat. he was not like a guy in a depo 9 room with lawyers talking all that formality. 10 he was bam bam, straight to the point. he said 11 nicotine is one of the most addictive, 12 dangerous and lethal legal drugs on the market. 13 let us talk about legality. 14 in engle, those findings of a dangerous 15 product, unreasonably dangerous, and findings 16 of culpability for fraud and conspiracy and 17 lying to the american public about the dangers. 18 that is not legal. 19 and in addition to that, those are 20 violations of law. that is why we are here. 21 those are liability fault findings. and in 22 addition to that, when it comes to kids under 23 18, it is not legal to sell them to kids under 24 18. and that is what ninety percent of the business 25 is. 1 so here is the asam guideline. do not 2 take money from tobacco. despite that, their 3 expert did. they say it is a conflict. 4 dr. dorce disagreed with everybody. here 5 is the american thoracic society. it is a 6 conflict of interest to have a relationship 7 with the tobacco company, but these experts did 8 that. trying to avoid that insidious effect 9 that tobacco companies have on legitimate 10 science, which dr. proctor testified about. 11 then we get to punitive damages. and you 12 must decide if punitive damages are warranted 13 as punishment to the defendants and as 14 deterrent to others. 15 the engle findings are all here. and 16 number 4 is fraud, number 5 is conspiracy. 17 because they all work together. remember, the 18 tirc, the ti, the ctr, the tobacco institute, 19 the tobacco industry research council, the 20 center for tobacco research, these were all 21 co-conspirators, found out to be in engle. so 22 defendants include all of those guys. 23 so all of those statements that you heard 24 from the industry spokesmen that were really a 25 defensive front, a shield, they were sham 1 organizations. they were all co-conspirators. 2 what is important here, though, it says -- and 3 you will have these back there to read -- but 4 that these findings show that these misleading 5 statements, what was withheld was entered with 6 the intention that smokers and members of the 7 public relied to their detriment. 8 so what they did was, with the doubt 9 campaign, they did something that was designed 10 to make sure folks would keep smoking. because 11 as long as you keep smoking, we keep selling 12 cigarettes. and selling cigarettes and making 13 profits by the billions is really what we are 14 all about. even if it derogates the common 15 human decency of looking out for the health of 16 people. 17 so, punitive damages are warranted. 18 and it talks about clear and convincing 19 evidence standard, which is different than the 20 greater weight of the evidence. 21 here is the greater weight of the 22 evidence. as far as is ed a member of the 23 engle class? yes, he is. if on balance, if 24 the scales tip slightly in our favor what 25 weighs more, what sways me more, he is a member 1 of the engle class. that is all there is to it. 2 this is not a criminal case where someone 3 is trying to raise a doubt. doubt. if you 4 think he is probably a member of the engle 5 class. if i was a betting man, 55, 60, 75, 80 6 percent member of the engle class. maybe 7 there is a 5 or ten percent chance. maybe 8 there is some expert. i heard some things, i'm 9 not sure. 10 in a civil case, the benefit of the doubt 11 is resolved in favor of ed caprio. so that if 12 you think he probably belongs, and the greater 13 weight of the evidence, that which weighs more 14 and sways me more, he is a member of the engle 15 class. i'm not going to spend too much time on 16 it, because i feel the evidence is overwhelming 17 that he is, and you are going to find him to be. 18 and then you are going to have to work on 19 the percentage of fault. 20 and the most important question for me is 21 that we get a chance to discuss punishment for 22 past wrongdoings, unacknowledged. no 23 contrition. 24 some folks say, listen, tomorrow it is 25 going to be friday. you are going to be 1 deliberating. if i go for punitive damages, 2 i'm going to have to come back and listen to 3 these guys for more. 4 but you know what? out of many -- there 5 were many called, few were chosen. you all 6 were chosen. and we feel confident that you 7 will not shirk your responsibility by saying, i 8 was going to agree that they need punitive 9 damages, but i want to get out of here, so i'm 10 not going to do it. 11 we do not even have the first compunction 12 or concern that you guys would ever do that. 13 we are not worried about that. you are going to 14 do what is right. you have been responsible in 15 this regard. we trust you in that regard. 16 and you have no stake in this outcome. 17 you were an independent, neutral, calm, cool 18 dispassionate, deliberative body. that is all 19 we want. 20 so, anyway, reckless indifference. 21 you will hear about that. 22 what should we be doing? let us cure 23 cancer. let us not cause cancer. let us cure 24 emphysema. let us not cause emphysema. 25 those were some really smart scientists. 1 those conspirators were some smart scientists. 2 claude teague was real smart. what would 3 have happened if they had dedicated their lives 4 to doing human, decent things to help people? 5 can you imagine? wow. where would we 6 have been, if it had been a cooperative effort 7 to benefit the public health, as opposed to a 8 fiendish manipulation of nicotine to addict 9 children and then replace them when they 10 invariably died prematurely from very horrible 11 diseases that do not -- 12 mr. bideau: objection, improper. 13 the court: overruled. 14 mr. schlesinger: -- that do not end in a 15 peaceful death in any way, shape or form? 16 so we say a motivation of a responsible 17 person would be cure, do not cause. and they 18 could have done that. 19 how -- how about this? how about we 20 product children and do not addict them? is 21 that a laudable goal? is that reasonable? 22 should not we be protecting children and 23 not addicting them; not putting them down the 24 path to make them a 20-, 30-, 40-year customer, 25 so that you can grind these kids through this 1 process of addiction leading to horrible 2 diseases and death and use them as replacement 3 smokers? 4 it is callous, it is cynical. a 5 replacement smoker for those leaving the 6 market. 7 now, here is another thing. there is an 8 instruction which says that the corporation has 9 the rights of people. okay? 10 so, in your deliberations consider the 11 rights of people. well, i've got a great 12 answer for that. they are human, but they are 13 not humane. because if you have the rights of 14 a person, then you should also execute the 15 responsibilities of a person, and you should 16 not act indecently towards your fellow man. 17 so i say, if you want to be treated like 18 a person, act like a person. 19 do they have a soul? do they have the 20 nurturing spirit for their fellow man? 21 do they pursue those goals that we like 22 to see in the best of american citizens, that 23 they care and they try to help? and i say no. 24 i say what has been revealed in these documents 25 is that they are human, but they are not 1 humane. 2 here is one of the things you see. what 3 are they about? they are about money. that is 4 what they are about. 5 now, in this case you are saying, well, 6 ed caprio is asking for money. but the point 7 is, today you are going to speak to them in the 8 only language they understand, and that is 9 money. and that is the only tool the law gives 10 you at your disposal. 11 and sure, you heard a lot of evidence, 12 because one of the rules we do not have is that 13 the jurors can raise their hand and say: 14 enough already. we got it. i got it. i heard 15 you. 16 if you guys could have put your hand up 17 and said, we know enough evidence now to 18 deliberate, if that rule was in place, maybe 19 that case would have been over sooner. but we 20 do not know. 21 what we do know is: who ain't for more 22 money? even back in the '60s, they are talking 23 about, of course cigarette smoke is a drug. 24 but dangerous fda implications to go 25 beyond these walls. 1 here is really what it is all about. 2 let us get to that. what is it really all 3 about? 4 what is this corporate human? what is 5 this corporate human's lifeblood? what flows 6 through the tobacco industry's veins? 7 green money. 8 what did dr. proctor say? why do they 9 keep doing this? he goes: greed, i guess. 10 this is something we are asking you to 11 consider as being reprehensible. indecent. in 12 the nature of an atrocity. to addict a child 13 and trade his golden years of life to replace 14 him with additional children, in a business 15 that is based solely and exclusively on youth. 16 what is oscar wilde? i think it is the 17 picture of dorian gray. that is the book. 18 oscar wilde, who was interesting, he was a 19 homosexual writer. famous homosexual writer. 20 is not that interesting? we are in a courtroom, 21 how times change. used to be if someone said 22 they were homosexual in a courtroom, they would 23 go to jail. there were anti-sodomy laws. 24 now the world is changing. we are in a 25 courtroom in another setting. and we are 1 looking at someone who is a minority, but who 2 has someone he loves, who has a partner in 3 life. and it is normal. 4 and i feel no prejudice in this courtroom 5 from the defense lawyers, from the witnesses, 6 from anybody. we have accepted it, and we are 7 moving along. that is progressive, and that is 8 good. 9 but what did they say? what did oscar 10 wilde say? in the picture of dorian gray, 11 which by the way, the picture of dorian gray is 12 a great analogy for the tobacco industry, 13 because the picture of dorian gray was -- does 14 anyone know what that is? anyone know the 15 picture of dorian gray? 16 it was a story by oscar wilde, great 17 writer, playwright. where he, the guy, dorian 18 gray, was like a debaucher. he was a bad -- he 19 was out doing all kinds of terrible things in 20 his community, back in the victorian era, or 21 wherever he was, on his horse. he was doing 22 bad things to people, lots of bad stuff. 23 but he looked great. he looked clean and 24 beautiful. presenting to the public, he was a 25 smooth and beautiful guy. but at home in his 1 mansion, on the wall was his portrait. and it 2 was rotting. it was rotting. the evilness of 3 what his conduct was, which did not show on him, 4 internally, in secret, in his mansion, on his 5 wall, that picture would show, over time, a 6 deterioration. that is the picture of dorian 7 gray. 8 in some ways, the tobacco industry is 9 saying: wait. they look beautiful. they look 10 pretty. there is models, there is actors, 11 there is great colors of package products that 12 look like everything else, and, you know, are 13 indistinguishable from normal consumer 14 products. 15 i mean, look at this stuff. here is a 16 pack of cigarettes. pall mall. look at the 17 colors. and then look at how the colors match 18 up with every other normal consumer product. 19 everything around the same size. 20 it hides in plain sight. here is a 21 batman. 22 how are you supposed to know this stuff 23 is bad? a six-year-old boy walks up to his 24 father and holds up a pack of these cigarettes 25 and says, dad, what are these? 1 and the father, dutifully trying to 2 protect his son, says, they are bad. 3 dad: those are bad. 4 and you know what the six-year-old son 5 says? they do not look bad. they look nice. 6 some of them have a nice camel on the cover. 7 just like a little toy camel the kid has. 8 how do you teach them it is bad? it looks 9 like a normal consumer product. how do you 10 team them that? and what do they say? 11 what is the cigarette? it is exquisite 12 and it leaves one unsatisfied. 13 what does that mean? we kept hearing 14 about satisfaction, right? pleasure, taste, 15 satisfaction. you saw the ads. you heard 16 about the ads. we heard about all of that. 17 but what does it really mean? cigarettes 18 leave you unsatisfied, because smokers are 19 addicted, and the nicotine wears off. and 20 you are not smoking to feel better; you are 21 smoking to avoid the effects of withdrawal, the 22 jitteriness that happens when in a few minutes 23 to 30 minutes, the cigarette and the nicotine 24 begins to wear off. 25 so here's the truth, internally. let us 1 hope our addicted customers stay unsatisfied, 2 and then what will the effect of that addiction 3 be? 4 all we will need is a bigger bag of money 5 to carry to the bank -- a larger bag of money 6 to carry to the bank. 7 this is what it is really about. you can 8 decide, hey, i do not think that meets with the 9 bounds of moral decency. i find it to be 10 reprehensible. 11 so the case is about ed caprio much more, 12 because you may consider harm suffered by other 13 persons not party to this lawsuit in assessing 14 the reprehensibility or wrongfulness of the 15 defendants' acts. 16 that is why we talked about 20 million 17 other deaths. 18 so, when you talk about what they did to 19 ed and what happened to him and how he believed 20 and how he was duped, you can make the 21 decision, by clear and convincing evidence, no 22 confusion, that punitive damages are warranted 23 as to ed. 24 and when you deliberate on the punitive 25 damages, it will be as to ed. it will not be as 1 to everybody. 2 but whether or not this industry, a 3 non-contrite industry should be punished, you 4 can consider harms to others. 5 now remember. remember that lung cancer 6 line going up that matched the cigarette sales 7 line? 8 you know, that is not just a statistical 9 line. that is mothers and fathers and aunties 10 and grandparents and brothers and sisters and 11 folks who suffered. and not just the people 12 that actually were sick, but their loved ones. 13 the toll that tobacco exerts is amazing. 14 elton john's got a song. mona lisas and mad 15 hatters. it is got a line in there: "i thought 16 i knew, but now i know." 17 you all came in here and maybe you 18 thought you knew something about it. but now 19 maybe you know something different. because a 20 lot of folks do not know the truth of what the 21 tobacco industry really was all these years. 22 so, 20 million people. that is a lot of 23 people. 24 and i say the numbers numb. you know, 25 one or two deaths is a tragedy; 100 deaths is a 1 statistic. folks have that. 2 how do you wrap your mind around a case 3 where you guys are called upon to take 4 responsibility for deciding punitive damages 5 and harm to others? we are talking about 6 20 million deaths. 7 mr. cofer: objection, your honor. 401, 8 403, state farm. improper argument. 9 the court: overruled. go ahead, sir. 10 mr. schlesinger: take a look at our 11 great state of florida. i'm born and raised 12 here. 13 now, from key west to st. augustine, to 14 pensacola, jacksonville, tallahassee, eustis, 15 arcadia, zolfo springs, hardee county, you name 16 it, from one end of the state to the other. 17 you name it. i want you to picture in your 18 mind -- 19 mr. cofer: objection, your honor. 20 improper argument, williams, state farm. 401. 21 403. 22 the court: overruled. 23 go ahead. 24 mr. schlesinger: thank you. 25 and imagine that no matter where you went 1 in the state of florida right now, that that 2 entire state was empty. there was not a single 3 living, breathing human soul anywhere, from one 4 end of the state to the other, no matter where 5 you drove, no matter what school you went to -- 6 mr. cofer: may we approach? 7 the court: hold on, sir. 8 mr. cofer: may we approach? 9 the court: sure. 10 (the following discussion was held at 11 sidebar:) 12 mr. cofer: i move for mistrial. 13 he is now basically said we exterminated 14 the state of florida. 15 this is ed caprio's case. you cannot 16 punish for harm to others. you can only 17 consider harm to others in reprehensibility if 18 it is the same conduct that also harmed ed 19 caprio. that is williams-state farm. 20 he is made no nexus between all these 21 other people that may or may not have died and 22 all the circumstances. 23 but this argument got so incredibly 24 prejudicial. he is now basically said we killed 25 the entire state of florida. improper 1 argument, pandering, inflaming the jury. it is 2 outrageous. 3 i've objected several times. you 4 permitted it. at this point, we need a 5 mistrial. 6 mr. schlesinger: it is not close to it. 7 i did not say they killed anyone in florida. i 8 was trying to give them context for the 9 magnitude of 20 million. 10 the court: i'm going to deny the request 11 for a mistrial. 12 mr. cofer: can we at least have a 13 standing objection? 14 mr. schlesinger: he already ruled. 15 the court: hold on. 16 mr. cofer: can we at least sustain the 17 objection, tell the jury to disregard, and have 18 him move on? 19 the court: no. 20 mr. cofer: this is outrageous. 21 (sidebar discussion concluded, and the 22 following was held in open court:) 23 mr. schlesinger: if i may, start my time 24 up, judge? may i continue? 25 the court: sure. we have about another 1 20 minutes, and then we will take a break. 2 mr. schlesinger: okay. 3 so, continuing on. the point i'm trying 4 to make is, there are 20 million people in the 5 state of florida now. imagine there was nobody 6 in the state of florida. 7 i'm trying to give you a sense of the 8 magnitude of loss from 1964 to the present of 9 20 million folks dying prematurely and 10 needlessly from a tobacco epidemic perpetuated 11 and sustained by an industry. that is how 12 significant that loss is. 13 and you know what? america is this 14 industry's ashtray. they stub out 540,000 15 lives per year -- 16 mr. bideau: objection, your honor. 17 the court: overruled. go ahead. 18 mr. schlesinger: america is this 19 industry's ashtray. they stub out 540,000 20 lives a year, for money? 21 you know, we have lost the attention to it. 22 we hear so many things, but we have lost the 23 attention to it. 24 this is an attempt by me to persuade you 25 to talk, but also i want you to say, i want you 1 to think, we are seeing things as they are, the 2 truth of what the tobacco scourge really is. 3 and then we talked about truth and 4 consequences. 5 and so, when it comes to punishment, you 6 know, when you sell a product to millions of 7 people, the truth matters. okay? 8 when your greed causes devastating 9 consequences for millions of your fellow 10 americans, there should be consequences for 11 you. there should be consequences for 12 companies that engineer their products for 13 addiction, target children and teens in order 14 to addict them, choose to keep selling 15 addiction as part of a defective product. 16 because remember, this is, according to 17 the engle findings, a defective product, 18 unreasonably dangerous. it is unreasonably 19 dangerous, more dangerous than it needs to be. 20 dr. proctor said: make it uninhalable. take 21 it out of the hands of anyone under 25 years of 22 age, and you would have a much different 23 situation. or ban it altogether. okay? 24 but it is an unreasonably dangerous 25 product. more dangerous than it needs to be. 1 that is a finding in this case. 2 when you trivialize the power of 3 addiction, when you do not tell the truth about 4 a dangerous and defective product, when you 5 know full well about it, and when you 6 deceitfully offer up false illusions of safety 7 for a deadly product. this is about truth and 8 consequences. 9 it is about the truth and how they need to 10 tell it, when, in fact, they butchered the 11 truth. and consequences. and they need to 12 face them. 13 and punishment, has been said by 14 augustine, to be justice for the unjust. 15 they are not supposed to like it. they 16 are supposed to be punished because you all 17 have made that conclusion that they deserve to 18 be punished. 19 so they say right here, our basic 20 position? the cigarette controversy is subject 21 to the charge and may be subject to findings 22 that we are making false or misleading 23 statements to the promote the sale of 24 cigarettes. 25 so they say, years ago, in 1968: we are 1 lying, and we are going to get caught lying, and 2 we are going to get busted for it. 3 they knew internally they were lying to 4 the american public, but they decided to do so 5 for their business. 6 and this jury instruction talks about how 7 do you get to punitive damages.how do you 8 arrive at the justification to exact a penalty 9 for this pack, this pack of lies, a pack of 10 lies is all this is. how do you get to that 11 point? 12 some of the things is that there is a 13 little bit higher standard. it is not just the 14 greater weight. it must be without confusion. 15 lacking in confusion. 16 you will have the instruction. you can 17 read the whole thing. i'm saving time. let us 18 talk about lack of confusion. 19 there is no doubt about the doubt. 20 right? they created a doubt campaign. they 21 pursued a doubt campaign. they made it so that 22 folks would not know. it is unproven. nobody 23 knows. we have to wait to see. 24 there is no doubt about the doubt. we have 25 got records and documents that you saw. i'll 1 show you some. 2 there is also no confusion about the 3 confusion. remember, are we going to arrive at 4 this jury instruction without confusion? sure, 5 there is no confusion about that. what is not 6 there confusion about? that is what is funny. 7 the confusion. the confusion that was the 8 business model of the tobacco industry. 9 where do they say it? obviously, the key 10 word is "confusion." this is their internal 11 document from 1966, as part of the conspiracy. 12 started in 1954. he felt into their 13 conspiracy, started smoking in 1958 as a 14 15-year-old. what chance did he have? 15 there were no warnings on a pack of 16 cigarettes when he was smoking. and even the 17 first one was not even a warning. it was a 18 caution. maybe cigarettes could be hazardous 19 to your health. 20 maybe they are not. 21 the poor man falls into addiction at the 22 age of 15, when the pediatric brain is the most 23 susceptible and exquisitely sensitive to the 24 addiction of nicotine, and he becomes an addict 25 for all those years. 1 so there is no confusion about the 2 confusion. anything we can do to confirm such 3 a situation works to our advantage. and there 4 is no doubt about the doubt. 5 how is this? what about this? 6 doubt is our product. they sell 7 cigarettes, they make cigarettes, they 8 fabricate them. they manufacture them. they 9 juice them up with sugar and ammonia compounds 10 to freebase crack nicotine that goes to the 11 brain and makes the maximum amount of addiction 12 possible. 13 and they say: doubt is our product. 14 because it competes with the body of fact. we 15 are competing with facts. and it is a means of 16 establishing a controversy. 17 they admit that tirc and all those things 18 were defensive operations and front 19 organizations, and they would be in a 20 deplorable position. 21 and they say, now that folks are hearing 22 it is bad for you in '64, we will put the phony 23 filter on it. the phony filter, which not only 24 did not it help; it made things worse. filter 25 cancer. adenocarcinoma. the new scourge of 1 addictive cigarettes, the drug of cigarettes 2 today. 3 these are things that help you know, hey, 4 we meet the obligations under the clear and 5 convincing standard. 6 here is what i want to say. there is no 7 doubt about the doubt. there is no confusion 8 about the confusion. is that clear? 9 i think it is. i hope you will find that 10 it is. 11 then they misled about filters. filters 12 were a fraud, they were a marketing gimmick. 13 they were the health reassurance campaign. in 14 the '50s, when the health scare came out, they 15 needed to come up with a psychological crutch. 16 so they put stuff on and said, they are getting 17 just as much tar and filter, but they abandoned 18 the cigarette on grounds of reduced risk to 19 health. 20 what is it really about? the illusion of 21 filtration. 22 what are they really saying? we will 23 advertise and say here is the super duper, 24 super extra you-know-what 5,000 filter that is 25 capability of taking out anything bad, and a 1 nice jolt of nicotine. 2 and what does the surgeon general say? 3 here is a few pages you may want to read in 4 this good book. i call this one of the "good 5 books" because it is good in a lot of ways. 6 page 16, page 17, page 20, tells you the whole 7 story about the filter fraud and how they faked 8 out the surgeon general for decades, and they 9 had to admit that the new designs were used by 10 the tobacco industry as a tool to undermine 11 prevention and cessation efforts. 12 so they fooled and duped the surgeon 13 general, as well. 14 and then this is the national cancer 15 monograph. that is in evidence as well. and it 16 talks about the lights being the same kind of 17 fraud. give folks a psychological crutch. 18 keep them smoking, because if they start 19 quitting, we are going to lose business. 20 here is the scheme linking. the only one 21 second on this is, hey, linkage is not 22 causation. 23 i heard dr. dorce. i thought that was 24 really parsing words. i did not think that 25 you will find that that was very credible. 1 chains linking together, associations, 2 causation. playing word games to avoid that. 3 nicotine addiction leads to lung cancer. 4 that is the bottom line. how do we know that? 5 can we play? 6 (the video clip was played and taken down 7 to the best of the reporter's ability as 8 follows:) 9 voice: we should also give priority to 10 the one addiction, tobacco addiction, that is 11 killing more than 300,000 americans each year. 12 (video clip concluded.) 13 mr. schlesinger: this is way back then, 14 in koop. the one addiction, tobacco addiction, 15 that is killing 300,000 americans a year. 16 that is when those numbers were down 17 lower, back in those years. tobacco addiction 18 killing. that is what is known as addiction 19 causation. that is the consequence. 20 the addiction makes you smoke crazy 21 compulsive, hundreds of hits to the brain a day 22 of nicotine. there is no other reason for 23 smoking. hard to wrap your mind around it, 24 because we live in the culture they created. 25 we are in the business of selling 1 nicotine. it is a potent drug. it is all about 2 nicotine, its addictive nature. no one has 3 ever become a cigarette smoker without 4 nicotine. 5 and then they even say the cigarette is 6 not the product; the cigarette is the package. 7 the product is nicotine, and the cigarette pack 8 is a storage supply of a day's supply of 9 nicotine. 10 cigarette is a nicotine delivery device, 11 one of the most craftily designed small devices 12 on the planet. 13 this here, this package here, has been 14 sold more than any other packaged product in 15 the history of human civilization. the most 16 successful advertising campaign, the most 17 recognizable logo. and what is the leg up? 18 they are selling an addictive drug. gives them 19 a nice leg up. 20 anyway. and the surgeon general is very 21 clear. it is not free choice. you cannot say ed 22 chose, ed chose, ed chose, when everyone knows, 23 including their own internal memorandum. shook 24 hardy reminds us, we cannot defend a smoking and 25 health case as free choice if the person was 1 addicted. 2 that was in 1980, when they were denying 3 addiction. that was before 1988, when surgeon 4 general koop declared the drug nicotine to be 5 so highly addictive as cocaine and heroin. 6 they were saying: if it ever gets out that 7 it is addictive, we cannot defend that someone is 8 making a free choice when they are addicted. 9 and they are. 10 millions are caught in this web of 11 deceit. as a matter of fact, surgeon general 12 2014. there is ed. ed is the web. there are 13 the defendants. 14 and here is what the surgeon general 15 says. chief preventable killer with more than 16 40 million americans caught in the web of 17 tobacco dependency. 18 ladies and gentlemen, that is all of them, 19 or darned near all of them. if there is 45 20 million smokers, 40 million is almost all the 21 smokers. because it is known that when you 22 smoke, you smoke for nicotine. the drug gives 23 you a dependence. 24 let us not keep talking about how a 25 million and a half or a million people a year 1 quit over the last 50 years, at a rate of 2 3 percent of the 50 million smokers that 3 ultimately added up to 50 or 60 million 4 quitters. 5 that is what the defense, the cigarette 6 attorneys, want to talk about. 7 let us talk about the 50 million that are 8 smoking and the 40 million caught up in the 9 web, and the millions that have died, and the 10 1200 to 1400 that are going to die today. and 11 the 50,000 that died during this trial. as 12 many as died in the vietnam war. let us talk 13 about them. let us hear from them about that. 14 but there is going to be blinders. you 15 will not. 16 so how about this? philip morris stood 17 in the way of nicotine cessation. they did not 18 want ed to quit. he was the perfect customer. 19 he used the product as they intended. he 20 bought the product, he used their coupons, they 21 incentivized him. he did everything they 22 wanted him to do. 23 is not it interesting to spend a couple 24 weeks in the courtroom with the tobacco company 25 saying, he should quit, he should quit, he 1 should quit. when the last thing in the world 2 the tobacco company wants you to do is quit. 3 and when merrell dow first came out with 4 a way that maybe would help smokers quit, that 5 chewing gum, they went crazy, they boycotted 6 them, they blocked them, they said everything 7 about this gum is offensive to our business. 8 that is not an entity that cares about their 9 customers. 10 what if they really cared about their 11 customers? what if they did not ever let a 12 cigarette be sold to anyone under 25? you had 13 to have behind the counter at the pharmacist 14 and ids. what if when a 30-year-old said, i'm 15 30 years old now, i've been smoking since i was 16 14 years old, i want to have a family, why 17 do not they say, you know what? you are a great 18 customer. we are going to help you quit. 19 what if they did not sell to minors? if 20 all smoking begins at adolescence and youth, 21 and they lost that business, because if you 22 do not start smoking by 25, you do not start 23 smoking. they would lose ninety percent of their 24 business. they would have ten percent left. 25 so they would only be making hundreds of 1 millions of dollars a year instead of billions 2 of dollars a year. they would still have a 3 business. would that be more responsible? 4 sure. could they have done that? sure. 5 these are the choices they chose to make. 6 let us talk about who really is making 7 free choices. ed was an innocent, addicted. 8 maybe his human frailties, his human weaknesses 9 were such that he was not maybe completely able 10 to try as hard as he could. he should have 11 tried harder. 12 he got copd. they said: you are sick, 13 you need to quit. he tried hard to quit, but 14 he did not. but the fact that he could not quit 15 when he got sick is evidence of addiction. 16 substantial impairment demonstrated by 17 continued use despite harmful consequences. 18 robert heimann said it was not injurious. 19 and he said: smokers are justified in relying 20 on our statements. 21 so was ed. they did not tell the truth to 22 ed. what about the stuff they concealed? if 23 they had told him the truth about it, would it 24 have been important? would it have been 25 material? if they got up in said, in 1964, you 1 know, you are right. this is a dangerous 2 problem. we are killing people. 3 how different would it have been? i'm 4 going fast. 5 a quarter trillion dollars, 6 250,000 million dollars, since the '60s, on 7 advertising that supposedly has no effect. 8 well, look at page 618 in surgeon general 9 '12 where tyler foote, a famous advertising 10 guy, says tobacco companies trying to maintain 11 that advertising does not work, that is utter 12 nonsense. 13 by the way, we also heard something -- 14 and this is important -- on peer pressure. 15 there are pages in this, 2012, i hope you will 16 get to, where the tobacco companies' marketing 17 practices create peer pressure. they are the 18 ones that create the peer pressure. 19 they want people to smoke. and then for 20 it to be like a communicable infectious 21 disease, for everybody else to smoke. that is 22 good for business, when smokers beget more 23 smokers. but it is in the culture they have 24 created. 25 so i said: protect children, do not 1 addict them. 2 and then here is all the youth marketing. 3 which they have never admitted, except for 4 bennett lebow. today's teenager, tomorrow's 5 regular customer. 6 the smoking patterns of teenagers are 7 particularly important to philip morris. 8 the success of philip morris red during 9 its rapid growth was it is the brand of choice 10 among teenagers, who stuck with it as they grow 11 older. 12 what did dr. robert fulton say in the 13 book, everything i need to know i learned in 14 kindergarten? 15 he said: play nice. do not hurt people. 16 if you do, say you are sorry. be decent to 17 people, not indecent. 18 this is not decent. this is 19 reprehensibility. this is atrocious 20 misconduct. 21 then all through here, more documents. 22 the great bonanza to get the youth market. the 23 14-to-24 age group, tomorrow's cigarette 24 business. 25 oh, by the way, better get that word 1 "youth" out of there and throw "young adults" 2 in there. from now on, 12-year-olds are young 3 adults. let us tell that to our 12-year-olds. 4 and now you are young adults. young lady, you 5 are a young adult now. you can start smoking. 6 younger adults have been a critical 7 factor in the growth and decline of every major 8 brand for the last 50 years. 9 that is diane burrows, it is in evidence. 10 her whole chart starts with 12-year-olds 11 smoking. up to ten percent of the 12-year-olds 12 are smoking in that chart. 13 and then dr. teague. if we are going to 14 survive and prosper in the long term, we must 15 get our share of the youth market. 16 how can we induce a pre-smoker and a 17 non-smoker to become a habituated smoker? 18 how do you get someone who does not know 19 about nicotine to think of a valued image, or a 20 cool baseball player or something neat or some 21 rebellious act to take up that first puff? 22 because that first puff starts the role of 23 addiction. 24 and then joe camel. it is as young as you 25 get. as young as you get. selling kids 1 cigarettes with cartoons. there is the 2 12-year-old replacement smoker. talk about 3 cynical and callous. we are losing customers 4 who are dying or quitting and then getting sick 5 and dying, and we are going to replace them with 6 12, 13, 14 years old. 7 here it is. it is about as young as you 8 can get. that is joe camel. okay? 9 and then this is a paper on nicotine, 10 claude teague. you can read about it, that the 11 nicotine is not important to the kids. right 12 there at says: at the beginning they are free 13 to choose. plus, plus, plus, plus, plus. but 14 at the end, negative. you are not free to 15 choose. you are not free to choose when you are 16 an addicted smoker. 17 then this is referring to the kids as 18 crops. right? referring to the little kids 19 as -- the youth as a crop. they dehumanize the 20 customer, while humanizing themselves, making 21 themselves out to be healthy and strong and 22 hale and well-met. 23 the youth is going to join with this crop 24 of prospects, like they are an orange to be like 25 squeezed and juiced and squeezed. all that 1 profits out of them so there is a dried-up husk 2 and there is nothing left and your lungs are 3 rotted, or they have cut out your lungs, or two 4 lobes of your lung. 5 and then they said something when they 6 cut out his lungs about, oh, the only thing 7 that bothers him is he is got an itch on his 8 scar. that was one of the cross-examinations. 9 you know, he is all better. they cut out a 10 couple hunks of his lung, and the only thing 11 bothering him is a little itchy scar. 12 come on. you cannot breathe when you have 13 emphysema and they take out a chunk of your 14 lung. that is unreasonably -- saying he is not 15 hurt. and he is terribly hurt. 16 so, here's a document i call the chiller. 17 the court: five minutes. 18 mr. schlesinger: thank you. 19 this is claude teague. claude teague 20 says: we have deliberately played down the 21 role of nicotine. hence, the nonsmoker has 22 little or no knowledge of what satisfactions it 23 may offer him and no desire to try it. 24 instead, we must convince him with wholly 25 irrational reasons that he just try smoking, in 1 the hopes that he will then discover -- that he 2 will for himself then discover the real 3 satisfactions obtainable. 4 is that cold blooded? is that just cold 5 blooded? that is why i call it the chiller, 6 because that is just somebody completely devoid 7 from the humanity of what he is saying that 8 articulates in a sentence what the business is. 9 the two-stage model. 10 get the kid that thinks it is cool, and 11 then he is going to discover the real 12 satisfactions. he is going to be hooked. 13 why do you think fishermen use hooks? 14 the fish do not know there is a hook in there. 15 the fish does not want to get hooked. 16 that is a petri dish with bacteria growing 17 in it. that is the peer pressure i was telling 18 you about. all those peers, all those other 19 smokers, they are not smoking because the 20 bacteria is growing in a culture medium. the 21 culture. the culture medium. they created the 22 culture, the environment in our country that 23 allowed the proliferation of smokers among 24 peers. 25 there is extensive scientific research 1 that explains that. they created the culture. 2 that is how things grow and proliferate. 3 without that warm nurturing environment 4 of advertising and assurances of health and 5 promises of glory to children and 6 rebelliousness to children, you are -- and the 7 food, the agar, medium in the food. you do not 8 proliferate it. 9 they are the ones that create the peer 10 pressure. they cannot disappear in this 11 courtroom. they are not flying colors. you 12 do not see them flying their proud logo. you are 13 not seeing this, what you see with advertising. 14 because, as dr. proctor says, the tobacco 15 company, in a courtroom, would like to 16 disappear. 17 and this is surgeon general 2012: all 18 tobacco use begins during youth and young 19 adulthood. 20 thousands of kids started today. every 21 day. this is why you have a chance to say 22 something. we reject this conduct. you can be 23 a brick in the wall. there is the song by ... 24 mr. gdanski: pink floyd. 25 mr. cofer: pink floyd. 1 mr. schlesinger: pink floyd. thank you. 2 that talks about another brick in the 3 wall. you cannot be another brick in the wall. 4 you cannot stop the entire one. but you can 5 look where it says, hey teacher, leave those 6 kids alone. 7 you can say: hey tobacco, leave those 8 kids alone. 9 that is one of the really heinous things 10 they have done. 11 this is the peer pressure document on 12 page 522. the tobacco industry attributes to 13 peer pressure but does not acknowledge a 14 relationship between their advertising and the 15 peer influence. and the evidence shows -- and 16 this is scientific evidence -- that these 17 efforts, the marketing efforts, affect peer 18 influence to smoke and encourage smoking among 19 young people. 20 that is the truth of it. so pay attention 21 to the industry that is driving this epidemic. 22 again, they call the smokers rats in a 23 cage. but it is all about nicotine. 24 and then you remember the quote? if it 25 was not for the nicotine, folks would be no more 1 likely to smoke cigarettes than they would be 2 to blow bubbles or light sparklers. 3 think about it. that is what it is, a 4 mouth thing. you are blowing bubbles, whatever. 5 you are holding up a cigarette, or you are 6 watching some fire. 7 but the truth is, it is a drug. as ed 8 said, he is a drug addict. it is hard to wrap 9 your mind around it. but cigarettes, they 10 do not look in culture as drugs, but that is what 11 they are. 12 the court: time is up, sir. 13 mr. schlesinger: i'm going to take from 14 the back end, if i may. 15 the court: sure. 16 mr. schlesinger: this is robert heimann. 17 he was against the warnings. the 18 warnings were a fraud and a sham from the very 19 beginning. they were watered down, they did not 20 have any applicability. 21 dr. teague said the warnings are a plus, 22 because if you tell a kid not to do something, 23 he is probably going to do it. they were on the 24 side of the pack. they did not really say 25 anything specific until 1985. he had been 1 smoking for decades by then. 2 and when they finally did, they always 3 attributed it to the surgeon general. the 4 surgeon general says -- but they always 5 disagree with the surgeon general. they 6 belittle the surgeon general. 7 they never said "we say." 8 early on, those early warnings did not 9 mean a thing. the ftc reports told you they are 10 dried out and useless. 11 and here's the thing. it is 30 years, 12 they have not changed the warnings. everything 13 we have learned, all these additional documents. 14 everything we know, they have not changed the 15 warnings. 16 the only time, liggett went ahead and put 17 "smoking is addictive" on their box of 18 chesterfields. philip morris bought the 19 chesterfield brand, took "smoking is addictive" 20 off. 21 that is a pretty important thing to know. 22 for a lot of folks, they did not know they were 23 addictive. that is the ineffectiveness of 24 cigarette labeling. 25 here is the thing about warnings. if you 1 see a kid walking up a high dive board to -- a 2 diving board that is on an empty pool, and there 3 is a "no diving" sign there and you see him 4 going by, do you say: go ahead. go ahead. 5 you have been warned. 6 and let him just jump off that diving 7 board into the pool. no. what do decent 8 people do? what do human people do? caring, 9 nurturing people who want to protect children? 10 they scream: do not do that. 11 they yell: hey, kid, it is dangerous. 12 they run after him. they launch themselves up 13 the ladder and they try to grab him to stop 14 him. 15 they do not say: you have been warned. 16 you are on your own. 17 little kids cannot make long-range 18 planning decisions. no kid that tries his 19 first cigarette because of peer pressure 20 promoted by tobacco knows what he is getting 21 himself into. 22 so determine the minimum nicotine 23 required to keep the normal smoker hooked. 24 dr. tamel. i like that one because it 25 shows they know all about their smokers being 1 hooked. 2 who ain't for more money? 3 if we did not have nicotine, we are going 4 to be out of business. overnight, we will lose 5 our jobs and consulting fees. we tend to 6 suffer from the fear that we are devoting our 7 business lives to the propagation of lung 8 cancer. 9 there is one in here that says cigarettes 10 have certain unattractive side effects. they 11 cause lung cancer. an unattractive side 12 effect? 13 and the thing, moreover, nicotine is 14 addictive. 15 cancer is in every class of smoke, and 16 you cannot filter it out. but they told the 17 surgeon general you could. they said: there is 18 no cancer, we will filter it out. 19 internally they said: there is cancer all 20 through the smoke, it is full of cancer. but 21 we will filter it out. so they were lying. 22 project scum. 23 mr. seiden: judge, continued objection 24 on the grounds we spoke about earlier. 25 the court: yes, sir. 1 mr. schlesinger: and this is where i 2 will wrap up, i think. unless i've got more 3 slides. but the slides are dictating. 4 project scum. the reason i want to show 5 you project scum and talk about it is because a 6 company that willfully trades lives for 7 profits, that has an enterprise of death as a 8 business, that sells an addictive drug to 9 children to hook them for life to generate 10 profits, even though they foreshorten their 11 life by decades or more and kills people, 12 does not have any compunction in their cynicism 13 to also ridicule those same customers. 14 what is worse? addicting them and 15 killing them or making fun of them while you are 16 doing it? 17 now, internally in the '90s, they were 18 making fun of gay people and homeless people. 19 they called them project scum. some clever 20 person said sub culture urban marketing is 21 project scum. 22 they never sanctioned anybody or got in 23 trouble. they never quit doing that. it was 24 only when they got caught, when the documents 25 came out years later, that the ceo issued an 1 apology, which i say was insincere. because 2 when you apologize only after you got caught, 3 that is insincere. 4 now project scum is belittling the 5 customer. of course, if you addict and kill 6 them, what is the big deal to also belittle 7 them? and, as dr. proctor said, this ain't the 8 only example. there are plenty more. 9 and they said here, it is the castro area, 10 the homeless people. they had to -- those are 11 the kind of people. they were targeting the 12 most vulnerable people. let us sell them 13 cigarettes, let us get them hooked. 14 hey, here is an overlooked market. the 15 weak, the powerless, the vulnerable. let us get 16 them hooked and sell them cigarettes. 17 and then what do they say in their 18 internal documents right around the same time, 19 when the committee of counsel, the all powerful 20 lawyer meeting is getting together? 21 stevens, the head of the committee of 22 counsel, is quitting. and what have we got? 23 the coronation of the god king. the head of 24 the committee of counsel, the number one chief 25 architect and top of this whole entire 1 conspiracy is the god king. 2 they dehumanize their customers, and they 3 deify themselves. and what does a god king who 4 has been crowned in a coronation have over 5 folks, over his dominion? he has the power of 6 life and death. 7 you are celebrating that? addiction and 8 death, and you are celebrating it through the 9 success of your conspiracy? 10 why should you check off that last box 11 that says there is no confusion about the 12 confusion; there is no doubt about the doubt; 13 that clearly and convincingly and without 14 hesitation you can arrive at a decision that 15 this entity deserves punishment? 16 and why is that an important reason why 17 we are here today, and one of the most important 18 things i've been honored to do in my life? 19 because that is the truth of it. that is an 20 interesting comparison right there. 21 and then they said they would go out of 22 business if it was ever proven to be dangerous. 23 they did that a bunch of time. they never did. 24 and, as dr. proctor said, what keeps it 25 going? just greed, i guess. 1 and why is ed -- why does it matter under 2 though reliance instructions, which are 3 complicated but you have to read them? here is 4 the simplified wording of those instructions: 5 lies cost lives. 6 proctor testified to it. lies cost him 7 his lungs. that is why. he was hurt by their 8 lies. that is why, he was one of the millions 9 hurt by their lies. 10 it was nothing personal. they were lying 11 to everybody. but he was caught up in it. 12 they talked about what would happen if 13 they came up with the antagonist in nicotine, 14 if they could block the nicotine. 15 they would be in the process of digging 16 their own grave. and remember, they have got a 17 survival instinct. they humanize themselves, 18 and they do not want to dig their own grave. 19 however, they are fully willing to dig half a 20 million graves a year of their customers who 21 are dying off. 22 and the literature. should i skip that? 23 i'll skip it. 24 and then one of the things real quick 25 they talked about was that the -- the surface 1 area of your mouth. the size of a tennis ball. 2 hold cigar smoke in your mouth, the size of a 3 tennis ball. that is how much absorption. 4 but as dr. andrews testified, the surface 5 area of the lungs, the size of a tennis court. 6 that is why when a big puff of smoke goes into 7 your lungs, which, by the way, has no taste 8 buds whatsoever. there is no taste buds in the 9 lungs. you cannot taste with your lungs. all 10 that nicotine is rapidly absorbed in that 11 highly vascularized organ. and you get all 12 that nicotine shooting to your brain. 13 controlling nicotine, controlling 14 nicotine. they can do it. it is all about 15 nicotine. 16 sales correlating with nicotine. more 17 nicotine, more money. 18 and shook hardy. we cannot defend 19 continued smoking as a free choice if the 20 person is addicted, 1980. i told you that. 21 the waxman hearings. you saw them. i'm 22 not going to play them again. 23 thanks so much for listening to me. i 24 know it was rapid fire. i hope some of it got 25 absorbed by you. 7 mr. gdanski: thank you. 8 good morning. thanks so much. you guys 9 have been a wonderful jury, unbelievably patient. 10 i spent a lot of time on my feet with a 11 lot of witnesses, and now i'm going to be the last 12 one to talk to you today before you go back and 13 deliberate. 14 and before i say anything, first and 15 foremost, thank you so much. thank you very much 16 on behalf of ed, everyone who tried this case. we 17 very, very much appreciate it. 18 now if you listened to the tobacco 19 lawyers, you have heard a tremendous amount of 20 evidence, a mound of evidence, days and days of 21 evidence showing how these companies did very, 22 very, very awful, horrendous, heinous things. 23 but if you listened to them, they make 24 it sound like they have done nothing wrong, zero, 25 nothing. 5489 1 nothing they did mattered. nothing they 2 did made a difference. nothing they did impacted 3 people. they never killed anybody. they never 4 addicted anybody, never manipulated cigarettes, 5 nothing. 6 they have been absolved in their own 7 minds, but nowhere else have they been absolved, 8 nowhere else, and that is important. 9 now i agree with mr. seiden, the 10 evidence matters. he said: the plaintiff wants 11 you to believe the evidence does not matter. 12 how could that possibly be true? we put 13 so much before you. 14 the evidence in this case indisputably 15 is that this industry profits off the backs of 16 customers they exterminate and then blames them 17 when they press their claims in court. 18 you kill them, and then you blame them 19 for killing them. 20 that is just -- it is mind-boggling. in 21 no other institution, in no other society, in no 22 other environment would somebody be able to defend 23 actions like this. 24 you do not blame the victim, but they do. 25 and now -- i heard it in the beginning 5490 1 of the case. first thing mr. cofer said in jury 2 selection -- both panels, some of you sat on the 3 first panel, some of you sat on the second panel, 4 and i think some of you might have met when you 5 were all selected for the jury. i think that was 6 the case. 7 both times, he said: there is two sides 8 to every story. two sides to every story. 9 mr. seiden said it again today: there is 10 two sides to every story. 11 that sounds very reasonable. you know, 12 it is a well-vetted tobacco line. 13 dr. proctor talked about it. they used 14 that line to convince americans 40, 50, 60, 30, 15 20, and 10 years ago that there is nothing wrong 16 with cigarettes. 17 that was the foundation of their entire 18 conspiracy: there is two sides to every story. 19 mr. seiden: litigation objection. 20 the court: overruled. 21 go ahead. 22 mr. gdanski: there is two sides to every 23 story. 24 i'm surprised they are still using it, 25 but they are. but you know what? there is not 5491 1 always two sides to every story. 2 it is not. it sounds good. you like to 3 tell people that. you like to talk to your kids. 4 i've talked to my kids. 5 i'd say: what did you do wrong? who 6 hit who first? 7 sometimes after you hear 16, 17, 18 days 8 of evidence or five minutes talking to my 9 five-year-old, i say: hey, what you did, what 10 they did is really, really ridiculously bad. it is 11 evil. it is heinous. there is not two sides to 12 project scum. there is not. 13 you apologized after you got caught. 14 after they got caught, they apologized one time in 15 one letter to the san francisco times after they 16 were busted. 17 that is not an apology. it is 18 meaningless. where is the record evidence of them 19 going out to make sure homeless people in this 20 country do not smoke? 21 that seems like a pretty noble thing to 22 do. that would be very, very good. where is 23 that? 24 what is the other side to the story of 25 manipulating cigarettes? where is it? when did 5492 1 they talk about it? 2 what is the other side to the story of 3 joe camel? they still pretend joe camel was not 4 meant to market to youth. 5 come on. we put up the document. as 6 low as you can go. it is a cartoon character. who 7 else are they marketing to? 8 what is the other side of the story to 9 manipulating nicotine, adding ammonia, high 10 fructose corn syrup? 11 what is the other side of the story to 12 killing 20 million people, an epidemic of death 13 unknown in any other aspect of human history? 14 mr. cofer: excuse me for one moment. 15 your honor, just to preserve the 16 objection, williams/state farm, and i will not 17 interrupt again. 18 the court: okay. overruled. 19 mr. gdanski: what is the other side of 20 the story to free-basing nicotine? why are they 21 doing that? 22 so if they wanted to tell the other side 23 of the story, they got all the data on free-basing 24 nicotine. 25 they are the ones who did it. they never 5493 1 refuted it. they never said: we did not do that. 2 you know, we never free-based nicotine. 3 so then, what is the explanation? what 4 is the other side of the story? none offered. 5 silence. 6 instead, what do they do? they point 7 the finger at ed and say: oh, ed, you knew in 8 1958 that smoking cigarettes was bad because there 9 was a poll. 10 well, if he knew in 1958 smoking 11 cigarettes was bad, then it also stands to reason 12 he knew everything they were saying. 13 but they want to have it on a one-way 14 street, and this world does not exist on a one-way 15 street. it does not work that way. 16 what is the other side of the story of 17 485, 500, we heard the numbers growing, 520, 530, 18 half a million americans dying a year? what is the 19 other side of the story? 20 they never tell you the other side. 21 there is no other side. instead, they ignore it. 22 they ignore death. they ignore everything that 23 they do. 24 these companies do not manufacture 25 cigarettes. they manufacture lung cancer. they 5494 1 manufacture copd, and they manufacture death. 2 and for all these deaths, for all the 3 deaths, the 480, the 20 million, there is countless 4 and endless suffering that goes with it. 5 countless and endless children, parents, family 6 members. 7 it is not like when a person dies, that is 8 the end of that story, and we just -- one person 9 who existed at one moment in time. 10 they have loved ones. john and louise 11 mavrakis are here today. they could not come in 12 the trial. they could not sit in. it is ed's 13 sister and brother-in-law. 14 ed has people who love him, who care 15 about him, and so do every single person these 16 companies exterminate. 17 and you know what? we talked -- let us 18 take a look at a couple of things. okay? 19 there you go. just click it. 20 video technician: yes. 21 mr. gdanski: thanks. 22 so they said: well, we did not get ed to 23 start smoking. 24 this was the very beginning. if you 25 think about their defense, all they have really done 5495 1 is tell you the same four things over and over and 2 over and over and over again. 3 ed started smoking with a girl in high 4 school. john's dad had copd. ed's uncle had 5 copd, and dr. patel warns. 6 how many times did they repeat that? 7 yesterday they said: you remember ed's 8 uncle. 9 of course we remember ed's uncle. you 10 talked about him every single day in the entire 11 trial. 12 but the reality is the surgeon general 13 tells us the tobacco industry -- so you know, it is 14 funny, some of the early surgeon general's reports 15 do not reflect on the tobacco industry because we 16 did not know how awful they were, and we did not 17 know how evil they were, and we did not know how 18 much they were affecting people. 19 the later surgeon general's reports, the 20 last two, three ones, they are all about the 21 tobacco industry because now we are learning: hey, 22 you guys faked out the surgeon general. you faked 23 out every person. 24 so here they say the tobacco industry 25 routinely attributes smoking to peer pressure, 5496 1 just like they did. 2 but it does not acknowledge the 3 relationship between advertising and peer 4 influence, or the effects of advertising on 5 normative behavior. 6 the point is, you are never going to find 7 a person who says: oh, of course, i started using 8 that product. i bought my ipad because i saw a 9 wonderful commercial. 10 of course not. but does it all affect 11 us? of course. and where does it come from? 12 from the manufacturer, and they pretend to 13 disappear. 14 they live in a world where cigarettes 15 fall from trees, and the tobacco companies 16 disappear, and cigarettes just wonderfully, 17 magically make their way into smokers' hands, and 18 then they get copd, and then that is the end of it. 19 that is the world they want to live in. 20 it is not reality. 21 the evidence reviewed shows that these 22 efforts also affect peer influence to smoke and 23 encourage smoking among young people. 24 that is peer pressure. 25 the engle findings. i want to be super 5497 1 clear because there is an issue in this case about 2 reliance and about what ed did know or did not 3 know. 4 and it is not that complicated. it is 5 really not that complicated. 6 the engle findings are that: the 7 defendants, number 4 -- they are in your jury 8 instructions -- concealed or omitted material 9 information not otherwise known, not otherwise 10 known. 11 and so when mr. seiden gets up there and 12 says: well, it had to be something he did not 13 otherwise know, that is the finding. 14 what he said is a rejection of the 15 findings. it is a rejection of engle. 16 mr. seiden: objection. misstates my 17 argument. 18 the court: overrule the objection. 19 mr. gdanski: not otherwise known. 20 he knew this was in the instructions. 21 it is number 4 of the findings. his client was 22 involved in the case. 23 not otherwise known or available, 24 knowing it materially was false or misleading to 25 the company or failed to disclose a material fact 5498 1 concerning the health effects or addictive nature 2 of smoking cigarettes or both. 3 the defendants agreed with other 4 companies and industry organizations to conceal or 5 omit information regarding the health effects of 6 cigarette smoking or the addictive nature of 7 cigarettes. 8 this agreement was entered with the 9 intention that smokers and members of the public 10 rely to their detriment. that includes ed. that 11 includes ed caprio. 12 and so when you get to the verdict form, 13 the questions that deal with the words "rely," 14 these findings matter. "rely," the findings talk 15 about reliance, not otherwise known. the findings 16 talk about not otherwise known. 17 what evidence is there after the 1980s? 18 they talk about: well, it had to be something 19 that made a difference to him. it had to be 20 something that made a difference to him. 21 ed trusted the cigarette manufacturers. 22 ed testified in this case he never would have 23 believed they would lie to millions of americans. 24 would it have made a difference -- when 25 you are looking at the questions of reliance, would 5499 1 it have made a difference to a reasonable person 2 if they knew that the tobacco companies were 3 ammoniating cigarettes, free-basing nicotine, and 4 manipulating ph? would that have made a 5 difference? 6 i think it would have. i think if 7 they would come out and said: we are doing this, 8 people would respond. 9 that is called reliance. that is how you 10 rely on an omission because the omission, the 11 failure to tell the person the truth, when 12 revealed, would it have made a difference? that is 13 reliance. 14 would it have made a difference if ed 15 knew how they controlled nicotine? would it have 16 made a difference if ed knew that filters were a 17 fraud? 18 the only place in the world where 19 anybody credibly maintains that filters work, 20 courtrooms. that is it. tobacco companies in 21 courtrooms. that is it. no place else. 22 would it have made a difference if ed 23 knew that they compared smokers to rats? would 24 all of that have made a difference? 25 i think it would have. i think it would 5500 1 make a difference in anybody if a product we have 2 and we know the manufacturer knows it is addictive 3 and comparing our use of it to a rat in a cage. 4 ed never knew that without nicotine 5 there would be no smoking. that would matter to 6 people. that would matter to ed. 7 here's what ed said: when you think 8 we are smoking -- and back up, before i read it, we 9 have direct, immediate, express, clear, crystal 10 clear, without hesitation evidence of reliance. 11 ed and bryan, roger bryan, they 12 obviously love each other. they are obviously 13 close. 14 they have been through the horrors of not 15 just ed's disease but their close friends that 16 they loved and cared for, watching them die of a 17 disease that nobody understood, that was confusing 18 them, that they were always scared they would get. 19 and ed, who cares for, loves his 20 partner, will remain life partners to the end, 21 said: hey, switch to light cigarettes. these are 22 safer for you. 23 that is what he told him way after 1982. 24 so if he is telling roger, bryan, to switch to 25 light cigarettes, does not that mean that he 5501 1 probably believed light cigarettes were better for 2 him? 3 i mean, come on. it does not take a 4 rocket scientist to figure that out. and ed 5 testified to that. he said he thought they were 6 safer. 7 did you think that because of 8 advertisements? 9 and ed said, you know, and he sort of 10 said it honestly: of course. they did not say it 11 directly, but less tar, less nicotine. 12 is that what the ads implied? 13 yes. 14 did they work on you? 15 of course. 16 is that why you convinced bryan? did 17 you still believe it? 18 yes. 19 and you told bryan that? 20 yes. 21 when you convinced bryan, were you 22 relying? 23 i was relying on the tobacco industry, 24 their ads. i never imagined an american company 25 would dupe millions of americans smoking a product 5502 1 with carcinogens that were dangerous to their 2 health. i just could not imagine that type of 3 inhumanity. 4 this pack of cigarettes -- can i turn 5 this off now a second or no? 6 video technician: yes. 7 mr. gdanski: this pack of cigarettes is 8 illegal. it is illegal. 9 can i get a ten-minute and a five-minute 10 warning? 11 the court: sure. which one? both, ten 12 and five? 13 mr. gdanski: yes, please. 14 the court: you got it. 15 mr. gdanski: thank you. 16 this pack of cigarettes is illegal. so 17 what ed is smoking in 1982, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 18 they are illegal today. why? dr. proctor said 19 why. because they were misleading. 20 so we have a guy smoking a misleading 21 product that today would be illegal to smoke. 22 that is evidence of reliance after 1982. 23 and they went everywhere they could. 24 they told everyone they could that smoking 25 cigarettes was dangerous -- was not proven to be 5503 1 dangerous, that you should continue smoking. 2 we do not know. we do not know. 3 we have a video we can play? 4 video technician: yes. 5 mr. gdanski: okay. 6 and when you see "lights" on there, 7 that is a statement. "lights" is a statement. 8 it is a word they put on their packs as a 9 statement. 10 so think about that when you see the 11 word "statement" in the jury instructions. 12 (video clip played as follows:) 13 voice: throughout your tenure with 14 american, it was not only american's position but 15 your position that cigarettes were not injurious to 16 health; is that accurate? 17 voice: through my tenure? 18 voice: yes. 19 voice: yes, that is so. 20 voice: that is something american 21 tobacco wanted the public to believe; is that 22 correct? 23 voice: yes. 24 voice: it is a statement that american 25 tobacco placed great reliance on? 5504 1 voice: we issued that statement, yes. 2 voice: and as far as -- 3 voice: of course we wanted them to 4 believe it. 5 voice: as far as you are concerned, a 6 person is justified in relying on that statement? 7 voice: yes. 8 - - - 9 voice: and i have to disagree with you 10 in that we do not know what causes the illness that 11 has been attributed to cigarette smoking. 12 - - - 13 voice: cigarette smoking does not cause 14 cancer, yes or no? 15 voice: it is not known whether 16 cigarettes cause cancer. 17 voice: all right, sir. 18 voice: has not been causally 19 established. 20 voice: cigarette smoking, no causal 21 relationship between cigarette smoking and 22 emphysema? 23 voice: despite all of the research to 24 date, there has been no causal link established. 25 - - - united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 voice: the case is still open. the 2 jury has not come in. 3 voice: it may not be harmful; you are 4 not convinced? 5 voice: it may be, or it may not be. we 6 do not know. 7 - - - 8 voice: do cigarettes cause answer? 9 voice: i do not know if they do or 10 not. 11 - - - 12 voice: i'm not in a position to give 13 you a "does" or "does not" answer. 14 - - - 15 voice: the medical experts agree that 16 smoking causes emphysema. do you agree? 17 emphysema? 18 voice: it may. 19 voice: they agree that smoking causes 20 lung cancer. do you agree? 21 voice: it may. 22 voice: do you know whether it does? 23 voice: i do not. we do not know what 24 causes cancer in general right now, so i think 25 that we may find out what causes cancer and we may 5506 1 find out some relationship which has yet to be 2 proven. 3 (video clip concluded.) 4 mr. gdanski: that is all after 1982, and 5 those are all senior executives in the companies. 6 that is the message they were trying to 7 put out. they knew it was critically important to 8 them achieving the goal of sustaining profits 9 because that is what it was about. 10 they want to say mr. caprio is here for 11 money. that is all the law allows. he will take a 12 pound of flesh if the law would allow it. he 13 cannot. but all he can ask for is money in a civil 14 case. 15 and so that is what he can ask for. and, 16 you know, we asked for $12 million in the economic 17 numbers. the $12 million is for his pain and 18 suffering in the past and in the future. 19 the man has suffered. i do not think i 20 have to say any more about that. i know i, my 21 people, we do not measure suffering by how much 22 people make in a year, a salary. 23 we do not choose to do it that way. i 24 think that that is an unfair way to measure 25 suffering when you cannot breathe at night. 5507 1 and if there is a power outage in south 2 florida, your oxygen tank goes out, and then you 3 have a major, major problem. 4 so i think that the evidence justifies 5 the numbers that we offer to you, but you can do 6 whatever you want. 7 when we are done, you go back; you pick a 8 foreperson. it is all in your hands. you can go 9 higher. you can go lower. you can do whatever 10 you see fit, whatever the evidence calls for. 11 can i go back to this pack for one 12 second? 13 video technician: sure. 14 mr. gdanski: thanks. 15 on the pack, so it says marlboro lights, 16 and then it says -- and dr. proctor talked about 17 this -- hard to see, it says a latin phrase: 18 veni, vidi, vici. 19 this is the corporate motto of greed 20 from philip morris: we came, we saw, we 21 conquered. 22 who on earth did they conquer? they 23 knew it. they knew they were the god kings. they 24 knew they had the world of millions of smokers in 25 their grasp to do with as they chose, and they 5508 1 did, and they took advantage of it, and they 2 manipulated it. 3 and then they want to come to court 4 proud and beat their chest and say: it is all your 5 fault. nothing we ever did mattered. 6 who puts: we came, we saw, we 7 conquered, on a product that kills people? how is 8 that -- it is mind-boggling. it is mind-boggling. 9 mr. cofer said yesterday: mr. caprio, 10 he had a wake-up call in 1996 when he got 11 diagnosed with copd. 12 a wake-up call? it is not a wake-up 13 call. there is no such thing as a little bit of 14 copd. you know, a diagnosis of copd is a lifelong 15 situation. 16 it is not a wake-up call. it is not like 17 the alarm clock goes off and you shut it off. 18 copd stays with every breath that you have. 19 and i asked dr. andrews -- he tried to 20 trivialize it. he did. he tried to trivialize 21 ed's copd in 1996 by saying: he did not have 22 symptoms. 23 i said: he had shortness of breath. he 24 had low oxygen. he had distant breath sounds. 25 he said: those all could be from 5509 1 something else. 2 there was nothing else. ed had real 3 copd. 4 of course if he were to stop smoking, 5 he would get better. 6 that is not the point. he was addicted. 7 there is no real question that the man was 8 addicted. 9 i think in any sensible situation, any 10 sensible medical test, the fagerstrom test, it all 11 shows that ed was addicted. 12 but you cannot trivialize copd. you 13 cannot trivialize cutting open his lungs. you 14 cannot do that. 15 next, please, project scum. 16 there you go. thanks. 17 mr. seiden: continuing objection? 18 the court: sure. 19 mr. gdanski: project scum, they say 20 that we are misusing project scum. they say that 21 we are the ones coming forward and, you know, we are 22 taking it out of context. 23 mr. cofer said that we used project scum 24 in a shameful manner. you are the first jury in 25 the history of the universe to hear about project 5510 1 scum. never been shown to a jury who is going to 2 decide the fate of these companies. never been 3 shown to a jury. 4 this is not shameful. what is 5 disturbing is how lost they are. their moral 6 compass is lost. 7 the appropriate thing to do when you 8 show project scum is to get up here and say: hey, 9 mea culpa, that was really awful, and if we did not 10 apologize enough, we are going to do it one more 11 time. 12 that is what you do. you do not come 13 forward and say: these guys are misusing project 14 scum. 15 project scum was disgusting. that is 16 what they call ed caprio? that is what they call 17 people in this country? 18 mr. seiden: objection. misrepresents 19 the evidence. 20 mr. gdanski: it is insane. 21 the court: overruled. 22 mr. gdanski: it is insane. it is -- 23 there is no words to describe it. it speaks for 24 itself. 25 and the moral compass that they have lost 5511 1 in the '40s and '50s and '60s and '70s and '80s, 2 you would like to think they got it back, but they 3 have not. they have not. 4 they have shown no real, you know, 5 understanding of what is decent, what is good, 6 what is appropriate, what they should be doing. 7 and it is not us, the lawyers, who 8 thought of project scum. i showed you the article 9 from the san francisco new times right after where 10 they said: hey, what you guys are doing, the 11 purpose -- this is anne landman. dr. proctor 12 talked about it. 13 they said: as i dig through these 14 documents, i come to realize it is all nasty, but 15 this one is particularly nasty. even if it is a 16 cute acronym, how do you justify it? 17 what customers would want to buy a 18 product from any company that calls them "scum"? 19 the name of the project is beyond offensive. 20 and they realized that a little too 21 late. 22 it is one thing to go after a particular 23 group to extract its money, but it is another to be 24 derogatory while you do it. 25 this is the newspaper articles calling 5512 1 these companies out. that is the truth of the 2 matter. that is the truth of the situation. 3 you put in a -- i hope after this came 4 out you put in new laws at the company to protect 5 against the evils that you have perpetrated in the 6 past. 7 but those are all what dr. proctor 8 called evescasting. do you remember, no one 9 understood the word? he thinks he coined the 10 word. 11 it is basically covering up your tracks. 12 that is all it is, covering up your tracks after 13 you do something wrong. 14 one of the things you are going to see in 15 your jury instructions is legal cause. mr. cofer 16 showed you this paragraph: addiction to 17 cigarettes, legal cause, directly and in natural 18 and continuous sequence, produced or contributed 19 to produce such copd that it can be reasonably 20 said but for the addiction to cigarettes 21 containing nicotine, copd would not have occurred. 22 and he thinks legal cause is very 23 important, and it is. 24 there is a second section to legal cause 25 which he did not show you. 5513 1 nicotine addiction does not have to be 2 the only cause. in order to be regarded as a 3 legal cause of copd, an addiction to cigarettes 4 containing nicotine need not be the only cause. 5 addiction to cigarettes containing 6 nicotine may be a legal cause of copd even though 7 it operates in combination with the acts of 8 another, some natural cause, or some other cause, 9 if such other cause occurs at the same time as the 10 addiction and the addiction contributes 11 substantially to producing the copd. 12 that is tremendously complicated 13 language, which, quite frankly, i do not really 14 understand it. 15 what it means is that, did his addiction 16 to nicotine contribute substantially? did his 17 addiction play an important role in his continued 18 smoking? 19 that is what it means, and of course it 20 did. 21 addiction is the center of their 22 universe. without addiction, there would be 23 nothing. it is the sine qua non of their entire 24 business enterprise, without which there is 25 nothing, nothing. 5514 1 no nicotine in cigarettes, no lawsuit 2 here today. no nicotine in cigarettes, no oxygen 3 tank humming in the back. no nicotine in 4 cigarettes, no 20 million deaths. no nicotine in 5 cigarettes, no 500,000 dead a year. 6 that is what "substantially contributes" 7 means. 8 the surgeon general tells us: nicotine 9 addiction -- page 105. when you go back there, 10 you guys can take as much time as you want. we 11 are not time bound by you. you have all the time 12 you want. 13 we are up against a weekend. we trust 14 and hope that you guys understand the importance 15 and significance of this case. 16 the next phase of this trial i assure 17 you will be extremely short. we have no evidence. 18 we have no witnesses. we will start and rest. 19 they can do whatever they want to do to 20 drag it out. we will not put on a witness. 21 mr. seiden: i object to that. 22 the court: i'll sustain the 23 objection. 24 mr. seiden: move to strike the 25 comment. 5515 1 the court: we will strike it. the jury 2 is to disregard it. 3 go right ahead. 4 mr. gdanski: page 105, 105: nicotine 5 addiction is the fundamental reason, fundamental 6 reason. 7 that is all you need. and so what do 8 they do? what do they do here? 9 you do not have a leg to stand on, you 10 break the other guy's. you do not have a leg to 11 stand on, you break the other guy's. 12 and that is what they have done. project 13 scum: we are just going to knock one of their legs 14 down. 15 put up addiction as a fundamental 16 reason, we are going to knock one of their legs 17 down. 18 but the reality is, is that when you 19 knock their leg down, you do not hit them when 20 they are down. 21 and yesterday mr. cofer made a low blow. 22 he made a low blow. he called out scott 23 schlesinger for not being here during parts of the 24 trial. 25 scott apologized for that. mr. cofer 5516 1 knows good full and well that mr. schlesinger's 2 mom died a sudden, a sudden death that was 3 unexpected. 4 mr. seiden: objection. 5 the court: i'll sustain the 6 objection. 7 mr. gdanski: he knows why he was not 8 here. 9 mr. cofer: whoa, whoa, whoa, and we can 10 instruct the jury to disregard? 11 the court: yes. 12 the jury is to disregard that. 13 go ahead, sir. 14 mr. gdanski: he knows. we know. 15 everyone except for you-all know why scott was not 16 here a few days. 17 mr. seiden: can we have a motion, your 18 honor? 19 the court: i'll sustain the objection. 20 strike that. 21 mr. gdanski: yes, sir. 22 dr. herrera, they say dr. herrera sent 23 ed caprio to dr. kirsch to treat him for nicotine 24 addiction. that is just not true. he said 25 otherwise. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 can we play that? 2 video technician: sure. 3 mr. gdanski: thanks. 4 (video clip played as follows:) 5 voice: but you were the doctor, and you 6 had been the doctor primarily managing his 7 nicotine addiction, right? 8 voice: yes. 9 voice: that has not fallen to the 10 responsibility of a psychiatrist, correct? 11 voice: correct. 12 (video clip concluded.) 13 mr. gdanski: he said it. he said: i 14 treated him for nicotine addiction. i did not send 15 him to dr. kirsch for nicotine addiction. i was 16 the one who treated him. 17 i asked that question because i knew one 18 day these guys were going to try to come to court 19 and say: dr. kirsch never did x, y, or z. 20 dr. kirsch's records do not say anything 21 about mr. caprio's nicotine addiction. neither 22 did dr. patel's, by the way. 23 and when someone finally asked him a 24 question, he said: yeah, of course the guy was 25 addicted to nicotine. no doubt about it. no 5518 1 doubt about it. 2 they could have gone to ask dr. kirsch 3 questions. you notice in dr. herrera's deposition 4 for the first four hours -- look at the time of 5 that deposition, by the way. it is 19:50. 6 i'm not good with army time, but it was 7 late. when i left, it was very dark. it was 9, 8 10:00 when we finished that deposition. 9 they could have asked dr. kirsch what 10 she thought. they chose not to do that. 11 and you know what? they also called 12 dr. herrera out for not knowing ed had a partner. 13 it was 10:00 at night. 14 the guy's medical records say: patient 15 lives with a partner. patient lives with a 16 partner. patient lives with a partner. patient 17 lives with a partner. patient lives with a 18 partner. 19 how many times? okay. how many times? 20 and you know what? the tobacco 21 companies, they make it easy to start, as easy as 22 possible to start, and as hard as possible to 23 stop. 24 and that is their business enterprise. 25 that is their life blood. that is what they do. 5519 1 that is how they survive. 2 and at the center of it all were 3 lawyers, were lawyers. lawyers were running it, 4 engineering it, building it up, feeding it, 5 feeding it, and then making sure it went in the 6 right directions. 7 the court: ten minutes, sir. 8 mr. gdanski: and they just kept going. 9 they kept going. 10 this is -- 11 the court: counsel, ten minutes. 12 mr. gdanski: thank you, judge. 13 thank you. 14 for purposes of the litigation, the 15 industry is not willing to concede anything. 16 in the litigation venue, we will require 17 plaintiffs to prove causation, both legally and 18 scientifically. 19 we intend to play hardball with the 20 victims of cigarette smoking when they press their 21 claims in the courtroom. 22 this -- that, that sentence i just read, 23 that they will play hardball and make them prove 24 legal and scientific causation, is the industry's 25 ultimate public relations sham. 5520 1 our position continues to mislead the 2 public with a wink, with a wink. 3 that is all you need to see. i can sit 4 down though. i will not because i've got extra time. 5 that is all you need to see. 6 the lawyers run the conspiracy, the 7 influence of the lawyers. in consequence of the 8 importance of the lawsuits, the main power in 9 smoking and health situation undoubtedly rests 10 with the lawyers, and more particularly with the 11 policy committee of lawyers. 12 the lawyers -- 13 mr. seiden: litigation objection. 14 the court: overruled. 15 go ahead. 16 mr. gdanski: the jensen issue -- 17 mr. seiden: continuing objection, your 18 honor? 19 the court: sure. 20 mr. gdanski: and this is, by the way, a 21 lorillard document. i'm using the clicker, so i 22 cannot blow it up, but it has lorillard/ctr inquiry 23 at the top. so when he said we did not put in a 24 lorillard document, here it is, lorillard/ctr 25 inquiry. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 the jensen issue raises a larger 2 question, whether funds administered through 3 shook, hardy were used to purchase favorable 4 judicial or legislative testimony, thereby 5 perpetrating a fraud on the public. 6 they purchased favorable judicial or 7 legislative testimony in an effort to perpetrate a 8 fraud on the public. 9 and then they have the gall to come in 10 and question dr. proctor. that takes a lot. this 11 man has dedicated his life to curbing this 12 epidemic. he is not taking free money. they have 13 gall to do that. 14 you know, these are their words, how 15 they describe their own conduct, not written for 16 purposes of exposing it to you in a courtroom. 17 this is their secret, secret files. 18 everybody knows that in the story of eve 19 in the garden, the serpent is blameworthy. the 20 serpent is blameworthy. he is the tempter, the 21 tempter, the one who feeds -- 22 mr. cofer: objection, your honor. this 23 is improper argument. move to strike. 24 the court: overruled. 25 go ahead. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 mr. gdanski: and we know that. that is 2 a basic fundamental human being piece of 3 knowledge. 4 we have the goods on them now. the time 5 is up. it is over with. 6 and they have a document, the god king. 7 i said it back then, i feel uncomfortable saying 8 the words. i feel uncomfortable using the words 9 "god king" to call a tobacco company. who refers 10 to themselves as that? 11 they talked a lot about dr. proctor 12 going from courtroom to courtroom. i thought one 13 thing that dr. proctor said -- oh, this one is -- 14 i'm sorry, this one i cannot -- it is an internal 15 document where dr. dimarco said: although i cannot 16 recall his exact words, our medical/scientific 17 witnesses will say whatever we want them to say, 18 clearly implying, if not stating, that they lacked 19 credibility and integrity. 20 it is the words on their pieces of paper 21 before any experts were ever retained going 22 forward in this case. that is all you need to see. 23 dr. proctor said: have they ever 24 admitted that a single person had a disease caused 25 by addiction to nicotine? 5523 1 no. 2 of course he is got to go from courtroom 3 to courtroom. they will not admit anybody is a class 4 member. 5 they make it that much harder on the 6 process. i mean he would earn much less money, by 7 the way, if they would just admit someone was a 8 class member for one time, one time. if not ed, 9 who? if ed's not a class member, who is? 10 and if an industry -- 11 mr. bideau: objection, your honor. 12 the court: overruled. 13 go ahead. 14 mr. gdanski: and if an industry is not 15 deserving of punishment -- if any industry is 16 deserving of punishment, which better one than 17 this one? which better one than this one? 18 and if not now, then when? a billion 19 deaths in the next century. a billion deaths. 20 are we going to wait until then? we cannot wait 21 until then. 22 mr. cofer: your honor, objection. 23 williams/state farm. 24 the court: overruled. 25 go ahead. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 mr. gdanski: in this trial, we learned 2 there is 480,000 annual deaths. that is 40,000 3 deaths monthly. that is 1,315 daily deaths, 4 yesterday, today, tomorrow. 5 that means if we take the days of this 6 trial, you have 42,000 people dying from 7 tobacco-related diseases during the course of this 8 trial. 9 this is no joke. this is no joke, and 10 that is using the 480,000 number, not the new 11 numbers which are coming out and being 12 substantiated in leading medical journals. 13 this is no joke we are dealing with. 14 this is a mass epidemic, and so what are they? 15 they are what i call engle breakers. 16 they take the once proud and still proud 17 engle class and break them down one by one by one 18 by one, courtroom to courtroom. they will not let 19 any engle class member survive, and that is -- 20 mr. bideau: objection, your honor. 21 the court: overruled. 22 go ahead. 23 mr. gdanski: that is a repudiation of 24 the process. that is unfair. the engle class is 25 alive. it is strong. it is multigenerational, 5525 1 and it will outlive them. it will teach them a 2 lesson. 3 today you hold their fate -- like they 4 pretended they were god kings holding the fate of 5 smokers, you are hold their fate in your hands. 6 you hold their fate in your hands in a 7 way they never did and in a way they never could 8 because they do not get to go back and continue 9 manipulations. it is over. 10 i'm going to skip this. 11 before and after 1982, they duped the 12 surgeon general, they duped the national cancer 13 institute, they duped the federal trade 14 commission, they duped medical doctors, they duped 15 millions of americans, they duped ed caprio, and 16 he used the term "shameful" earlier, "shameful." 17 let us blow up the bottom. 18 the court: five minutes, sir. 19 mr. gdanski: yes, sir. 20 the ftc said: we will not continue to 21 be a victim of their shameful marketing practices. 22 they said: we will not continue to be a 23 victim of the shameful marketing practices of 24 tobacco companies. 25 that is the federal trade commission 5526 1 talking. 2 we do live, we do unfortunately live in 3 the world they created. 4 the truth, dr. proctor said -- and when 5 he said it, i wrote it down. i thought it was 6 very eloquent. 7 the truth was their worst enemy. doubt 8 is our product. it is also the means of 9 establishing a controversy. doubt is their 10 product. that is it. 11 the ftc, they are the ones who said: we 12 are going to rescind our guidance. 13 on that last one i showed you, they took 14 off their guidance and said: we will not let you 15 guys -- be a cloak screen anymore for you, for the 16 industry. we are taking it away. these are not 17 safer. 18 they took away what they had previously 19 said. 20 i'm not going to -- well, it only takes 21 a second. 22 go ahead, please. 23 (video clip played as follows:) 24 voice: please consider yourselves to be 25 under oath. 5527 1 voice: let me begin my questioning on 2 the matter of whether or not nicotine is 3 addictive. 4 let me ask you first -- and i'd like to 5 just go down the row -- whether each of you 6 believes that nicotine is not addictive. 7 i heard virtually all of you touch on 8 it, and just yes or no, do you believe nicotine is 9 not addictive? 10 voice: i believe nicotine is not 11 addictive, yes. 12 voice: mr. johnston? 13 voice: congressman, cigarettes and 14 nicotine clearly do not meet the classic 15 definitions of addiction. there is no 16 intoxications. 17 voice: we will take that as a no, and, 18 again, time is short. if you could just -- i 19 think each of you believe nicotine is not 20 addictive. we just would like to have this for 21 the record. 22 voice: i do not believe that nicotine or 23 our products are addictive. 24 voice: i believe nicotine is not 25 addictive. 5528 1 voice: i believe that nicotine is not 2 addictive. 3 voice: i believe that nicotine is not 4 addictive. 5 voice: and i, too, believe that 6 nicotine is not addictive. 7 (video clip concluded.) 8 mr. gdanski: they want to say that 9 those guys are not lying. that is what they want to 10 claim in this courtroom today. 11 if you are claiming in this courtroom 12 that they are not lying, then you are lying. that is 13 it. 14 mr. cofer: your honor, objection. 15 mr. seiden: objection. 16 the court: i'll sustain the objection. 17 the jury is to disregard it. 18 mr. cofer: thank you, your honor. 19 mr. gdanski: mr. cofer said: well, ed, 20 he accepts now five percent. before, he accepted 21 no percent. 22 you know, ed accepts some percent. when 23 are they going to accept their fair share of the 24 blame? 25 the frank statement, they said, we 5529 1 accept as a responsibility. when are they going 2 to accept their fair share of the blame? 3 it has not happened. 4 the surgeon general, 2014, rapid 5 elimination. so we are moving forward in time. 6 we are going from reduction. let us eliminate it. 7 let us eliminate it. 8 that is the surgeon general in 2014. 9 this is the conspirator board. we put 10 this up. mr. seiden showed it. i showed it. 11 it is got faces. it is got names. it is got people. 12 those were real people who worked for 13 real companies and made real decisions. those 14 were real people whose decisions had 15 ramifications. 16 those were people whose decisions caused 17 death, and i fundamentally disagree with the board 18 that he put up where names and faces get erased 19 because we know horrors leave shadows. 20 dr. proctor said that: horrors leave 21 shadows. history is important. we do not forget 22 the horrors of history. we teach our children and 23 everybody to never forget. 24 that is what we say. we say: never 25 forget. 5530 1 we do not erase them. we study them. we 2 remember them, and by remembering those people, by 3 remembering those people, we show dignity to the 4 people that they killed. 5 we remember the people that they killed. 6 we remember the people who they affected. and you 7 know what? these are not all of the conspirators, 8 but they killed and they hurt a lot of people. 9 they hurt a tremendous amount of people, 10 and i do not ascribe to the philosophy that we 11 should erase them from the board. 12 every one of those guys should have a 13 tombstone put over them for all the people that 14 they have killed. 15 and, you know, ed, ed will not live 16 forever. ed caprio, he will not live forever. 17 many of us in this room will outlive ed 18 caprio, two, three, twelve years. i'm younger 19 than him. i'll live forever [sic]. i'll live 20 past ed. the natural course of things are going 21 to be that way. 22 and i reject the idea that you erase 23 people from a board. i will never erase ed. ed 24 never deserves to be erased. 25 i'll remember ed. steve will remember 5531 1 ed. bryan will remember ed. louise will remember 2 ed. john will remember ed. scott will remember 3 ed. brittany will remember ed. moni will 4 remember ed. 5 that is what people deserve to be. they 6 deserve to be remembered. this industry lives in 7 a world where they can erase faces. 8 today you can tell them, you can tell 9 this industry: you must remember ed. never 10 forget ed caprio. 11 that is the power you have today. we 12 wish you god speed. good luck in delivering swift 13 justice, and i hope to talk to you again. 14 thank you very, very much.
