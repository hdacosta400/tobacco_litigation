25 mr. hohnbaum: counsel. good afternoon, members of the jury. 2 i want to add my word of thanks for your 3 commitment, your attention, and your devotion to 4 your job as jurors has been obvious to anybody 5 that is been in the courtroom, and we appreciate 6 that. 7 let me get right to it, ladies and gentlemen 8 of the jury. 9 lest there be any doubt, this is a case about 10 thomas cavalier. now, that sounds rather 11 straightforward, right? thomas cavalier is the 12 deceased in this case. but what has happened in 13 the weeks that we have been here is that you have 14 seen very little evidence about thomas cavalier, 15 and lots of evidence that the plaintiff simply 16 has not connected to mr. cavalier. they have not 17 connected, and frankly, ladies and gentlemen of the 18 jury, there has been very little attempt to even 19 connect a lot of what you just saw, if not all of 20 what you just saw, to mr. cavalier himself. and 21 you have the verdict form in this case. 22 and every single question on the verdict form, 23 every single question asks questions about thomas 24 cavalier, not some other smoker, not some other 25 person that may have smoked, but thomas cavalier. every single solitary question on the verdict form. 2 now, let us talk a little bit about what 3 evidence you have heard in this case. the 4 plaintiff's case is a red herring. you have heard 5 what we call generic evidence. evidence that 6 anybody can come in and talk about that is not even 7 attempted to be connected to thomas cavalier. 8 you have heard about addiction design, somehow 9 that the cigarettes are designed to promote 10 addiction. red herring. misdirection. 11 youth marketing. now, i'm going to go through 12 this, youth marketing; misdirection. what have 13 they proved to you youth marketing has to do with 14 mr. cavalier? what evidence? what facts from that 15 witness stand have they connected to thomas 16 cavalier? 17 and then advertising, you have heard testimony 18 about advertising. again, ask yourself, and i'm 19 going to go through the analysis, but ask yourself 20 what evidence do we have about thomas cavalier and 21 advertising? 22 the plaintiffs have the burden to prove their 23 case to you with facts. facts from that witness 24 stand. 25 so what happened in this trial? think about it. we have dr. benowitz who testified via 2 videotaped deposition. did dr. benowitz know 3 anything about mr. cavalier? nope, not a single 4 fact, did not even know who he was. 5 what about dr. proctor? at least he came and 6 testified and looked you in the eye. at least 7 dr. proctor, what did he say? i do not know 8 anything about mr. cavalier. i do not know what he 9 saw. i do not know what he relied on. i do not know 10 what he experienced. what does dr. proctor's 11 testimony do to help you decide the issues in the 12 case? he does not even know who mr. cavalier was. 13 and then we spent seven hours listening to 14 mr. farone -- dr. farone, an employee of another 15 cigarette company, philip morris. and we will talk 16 about that as well. but ask yourself, what does 17 that testimony have to do, what is the connection, 18 what have the plaintiffs proved to you the 19 connection is between what they talked about and 20 thomas cavalier? 21 22 hours in this case, 22 hours of testimony, 22 not just time in the courtroom, but testimony from 23 witnesses who know nothing about thomas cavalier, 24 absolutely nothing. do not even know that he 25 existed on the planet. zero. nothing. let us talk about what we call generic 2 evidence. evidence in a box, evidence that you can 3 move from courthouse to courthouse to courthouse 4 and it does not matter who the plaintiff is. it 5 does not matter. but their job, their -- what they 6 have to do is prove by facts what happened to 7 thomas cavalier, not what happened to somebody 8 else, not what could have happened to somebody 9 else, but what happened to him. 10 look. there is no evidence that mr. cavalier 11 started smoking because of advertising, none. 12 there is no evidence, none, zero, that 13 mr. cavalier relied on statements by any tobacco 14 company or any tobacco-company related 15 organization. think about it. is there one shred 16 of evidence, testimony, from that stand, some 17 document, that ties advertising, that ties company 18 statements to mr. cavalier? there is none. 19 and this, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, is 20 an important point, because there is no evidence 21 that the dangers and addictiveness of cigarettes 22 were unknown. and you will have your verdict 23 form -- you will have your jury instructions, 24 you will have them, and we will go through them. but 25 the standard is whether or not it was unknown or unavailable to mr. cavalier, that is the standard. 2 mr. acosta: objection, your honor, that 3 misstates the law. 4 the court: sustained. 5 mr. hohnbaum: there is no evidence that the 6 dangers of addictiveness -- that the dangers and 7 addictiveness of cigarettes were unknown or 8 unavailable to mr. cavalier. 9 we watched a video of dr. farone, hour after 10 hour, talking about the design of cigarettes. and 11 the fact of the matter is inhalation of tobacco and 12 cigarettes dates back hundreds, hundreds, hundreds 13 of years. 14 r.j. reynolds did not invent the inhalable 15 cigarette. cigarettes were inhaled long before 16 r.j. reynolds was on the earth. 17 and cigarettes, it is definitional, right? a 18 cigarette by definition means it is inhalable. 19 that is what it is. 20 importantly, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, 21 cigarettes today, their own witnesses, every single 22 one of them, there are a couple of places where we 23 have unanimity, and this is one of them. 24 cigarettes today are no more dangerous or addictive 25 than cigarettes from the 1800s. they want to spend time telling you that somehow the cigarettes, the 2 manufacturing process somehow makes cigarettes more 3 dangerous, more addictive. but listen to their own 4 witnesses. cigarettes today are no more dangerous 5 or addictive than cigarettes from the 1800s, and 6 ask yourself why, why you heard all that testimony 7 about the manufacture and design of cigarettes when 8 the evidence from their own witnesses is that 9 cigarettes are no more dangerous and addictive 10 today than they were hundreds of years ago. 11 ask yourself, members of the jury, ask 12 yourself. 13 the discussion about additives, the repetitive 14 testimony about additives. licorice, you heard 15 licorice. what does that have to do with this 16 case? because their own witnesses acknowledged 17 that additive-free cigarettes take all those 18 additives out, take them out. they are no less 19 dangerous and addictive than cigarettes with 20 additives. 21 the truth is that cigarettes are dangerous and 22 they are addictive by nature. by nature, not by 23 design. 24 dr. proctor, dr. benowitz, dr. farone, all 25 agree to that. that is what they said, from 1933 to 1993, a no less dangerous or addictive conventional 2 cigarette than the one mr. cavalier smoked existed. 3 there was not a less dangerous cigarette. 4 by nature they are addictive and dangerous, 5 not by design. 6 follow the evidence. follow what you heard 7 from that witness stand from the testimony of 8 witnesses. their own witnesses. 9 youth marketing. how much time did the 10 plaintiff spend trying to get you angry? 11 mr. acosta: your honor, objection. 12 the court: sustained. 13 mr. hohnbaum: ladies and gentlemen of the 14 jury, anger does not help you do your job. and 15 we will talk about that, too. 16 but there is zero evidence, ladies and 17 gentlemen of the jury, zero evidence that 18 mr. cavalier started smoking because of 19 advertising. did you hear anything from that 20 witness stand -- did you hear anything from that 21 witness stand that said he saw an ad and that is why 22 he smoked? 23 according to their version of events, he 24 could not read. he was not opening books or 25 magazines to look at advertising. but there is zero evidence. they have failed to come into this 2 courtroom and carry their burden of proof because 3 there is no evidence that any marketing to youth, 4 any advertising, anything like that impacted 5 mr. cavalier. we just saw -- we just saw up there 6 a 1927 document, a 1927 document. it is in 7 evidence. go look at it. prep schools and high 8 schools. 9 now, think about what people knew in 1927, but 10 put that aside and then ask yourself what does that 11 have to do with thomas cavalier? what -- what does 12 it have to do with him? he was not in prep school. 13 he was not in high school. where is the connection? 14 and then ask yourself why you heard so much about 15 it. and we will talk about that. 16 no witness from this witness stand had 17 firsthand knowledge of mr. cavalier's smoking 18 before he was 36 years old. 19 now, look, we are not -- he started smoking 20 before that. he started smoking -- the evidence 21 would suggest he started smoking sometime in his 22 late teens. nobody is running from that fact. 23 that is the fact of the case. but nobody can tell 24 you about his smoking from firsthand knowledge 25 until he was 36 years old. folks, you heard all this rhetoric, and all 2 the evidence about youth marketing. did you see 3 any evidence that kool cigarettes were marketed to 4 youth when mr. cavalier was growing up? any 5 evidence? think. the answer is there was not any. 6 we saw candy cigarettes. is there any 7 evidence that candy cigarettes had anything to do 8 with mr. cavalier? there is no evidence, zero. 9 what does their own witness, dr. benowitz, say 10 about why people start smoking? what does he say? 11 does he say it is youth marketing? does he say it is 12 something else? what does he say? what does their 13 own witness say? 14 can you play that, jesse, please? 15 (videotaped deposition of dr. benowitz played 16 as follows:) 17 a. well, currently the biggest factor for why 18 children start to smoke is their peers and their social 19 environment. so if you have a close friend who smokes, 20 or you have a brother or sister who smokes, you are much 21 more likely to smoke than someone who does not. 22 (videotaped deposition of dr. benowitz 23 stopped.) 24 mr. hohnbaum: ladies and gentlemen of the 25 jury, that is what we know. that is what we know about mr. cavalier, is that his dad smoked and his 2 brother smoked. that is what we know about 3 mr. cavalier. 4 you are not permitted, and it will be in 5 there, to speculate or guess. you have to make 6 your decision based on facts from that witness 7 stand, facts and evidence. 8 this is just a summary of what the witnesses 9 who did come in and say. those witnesses did not 10 know when he started smoking, they did not know why 11 he started smoking. they do not know what his first 12 brand was. they do not know if it was an r.j. 13 reynolds brands. they do not know anything about 14 that. 15 there is simply no proof. and the plaintiff 16 has that burden of proof. 17 everything is a red herring, advertising, 18 anything, any witness at all, anybody? no. there 19 is no evidence that advertising, there is no 20 evidence that youth market, whatever we talked 21 about with respect to that, there is no evidence 22 that advertising influenced mr. cavalier's smoking 23 decision, not just when he started, ladies and 24 gentlemen of the jury, not just when he started, 25 but at any point in his life -- at any point in his life. 2 plaintiff has the burden to prove facts. 3 they are sticky, and we will talk about that. the 4 truth is sticky, and we will talk about that. 5 look, dr. proctor, dr. benowitz, dr. farone, 6 22 hours of generic testimony that go to the engle 7 findings, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. 8 mr. gary put that up, the engle findings. another 9 jury has already found those, right? they have 10 already found them. mr. gary told you in opening, 11 365 days. it is already happened. why spend all 12 this time trying to reprove the engle findings when 13 they are already done. and the engle -- 14 mr. acosta: objection, your honor. 15 mr. hohnbaum: -- findings are not -- 16 mr. acosta: that is improper. 17 the court: sustained. 18 mr. hohnbaum: the engle findings are not 19 going to help you make a decision about whether or 20 not mr. cavalier is a member of the engle class, 21 because you cannot even consider those. you cannot 22 even consider those findings when you are analyzing 23 whether or not he is a member of the engle class, 24 and we will talk about that, too. 25 this is not going to be the last time i'm going to say it, because the plaintiff has the burden of 2 proof, but there has not been evidence about 3 mr. cavalier. 4 take what the plaintiffs say, put it in any 5 courthouse in the country, it is not going to help 6 you make the decision about mr. cavalier. that is 7 their burden. 8 here's what we know: everything -- everything 9 we knew at the start of the case, when you were 10 sitting there listening to opening statements, 11 right when that started, what did you know at the 12 start of this case about thomas cavalier's smoking 13 decisions? why he did what he did? what drove 14 him? what was in his mind? what was motivating 15 him? what did we know at the beginning of the 16 case? zero. and what do we know now? what do we 17 know now? 18 did dr. farone, did dr. proctor, did 19 dr. benowitz help you make the decision that you 20 have to make about thomas cavalier in this case? 21 no. 22 this is an interesting fact. the number of 23 family members who believed mr. cavalier died of 24 coronary artery disease before trial, they came in 25 here and they are telling you that coronary artery disease caused mr. cavalier's death. 2 mr. acosta: objection, your honor. 3 mr. chestnut: that misstates the evidence. 4 it is a cause. 5 the court: sustained. 6 mr. hohnbaum: fair enough. 7 i'll be very precise about this, because we will 8 go through -- we will go through the instructions. 9 we will pull them out, and we will go through it. 10 how many of the family members believe that 11 coronary artery disease was even in the picture 12 before trial? zero. 13 this is what his daughters believe. they 14 believe he died from lung cancer. that was their 15 testimony. that was what they believed, was that 16 he died of lung cancer. 17 you did not hear anybody from that witness 18 stand, any of his daughters testify that they 19 thought coronary artery disease caused his death. 20 now, look. you have heard this now a couple 21 times. the court has already determined that the 22 plaintiff cannot recover money damages for lung 23 cancer or copd. that is the law in this case. 24 that is the law. we are going to talk about that and 25 the challenges that that law presents to you as jurors. 2 the age when any witness in this case of 3 mr. cavalier saw him smoking, he was 36 years old. 4 36. that is not to say he was not smoking before 5 then. we are not saying he was not. of course he 6 was. but what do we know about that? what do we 7 know about that? 8 here's the age when anybody says he was 9 smoking an r.j.r. brand of cigarettes: 38. 10 no one knows before 1961, or at least nobody 11 testified as to why he smoked what he smoked, the 12 brands he smoked, before 1961. 13 now, here's -- you have got to pay attention, 14 and you have been. we have been watching. you are 15 paying attention. but listen to me. how many 16 witnesses told you mr. cavalier said, not that 17 he -- somebody said, oh, he looked like he wanted 18 to quit; my dad wanted to quit; he wanted to quit. 19 how many witnesses said mr. cavalier told them 20 he wanted to quit or he was motivated to quit? 21 mr. acosta: objection, your honor. 22 the court: sustained. 23 mr. hohnbaum: how many witnesses on that 24 witness stand said that mr. cavalier told them he 25 wanted to quit and was motivated -- acosta: same objection. 2 the court: just slightly rephrase it, 3 mr. hohnbaum. 4 mr. hohnbaum: i'll move on. the point is 5 made. 6 how many witnesses said mr. cavalier relied on 7 any statement or omission from r.j. reynolds or the 8 tobacco industry? 9 think about it. did anybody from the witness 10 stand say he relied on something he was told or not 11 told? anybody? any fact, any fact? 12 the answer is nobody. 13 think about this, ladies and gentlemen of the 14 jury. if you spend your whole life doing something 15 every day, smoking five packs of cigarettes a day, 16 and somebody tells you that you have a disease, 17 lung cancer that is caused by smoking, you lived 18 your whole life thinking this is not bad, it is not 19 going to hurt me, and some doctor comes in and he 20 told you smoking has caused cancer, what would you 21 expect to see? 22 you would expect to see, i do not know, the 23 tobacco companies did not tell me, the tobacco 24 companies hid things from me, i did not know this. 25 diagnosed in 1989, passed away in 1993. nothing, nothing about that, absolutely nothing. 2 you have the photographs. you have the 3 photographs. go look at the photographs. we 4 showed you some photographs. how many 5 photographs -- of all of the photographs that they 6 showed you and all of the photographs that are in 7 evidence, how many of them show mr. cavalier 8 smoking r.j. reynolds cigarettes? zero. 9 kool, that is the brand manufactured by r.j. 10 reynolds cigarettes. marlboro, other testimony 11 that he smoked marlboro, manufactured by philip 12 morris. parliament cigarettes, manufactured by 13 philip morris. 14 no photos -- how many photos have we seen? 15 how many photos have we seen of him smoking 16 cigarettes? every photo they put up, almost every 17 photo had him with a cigarette in his hand. 18 how many r.j. reynolds cigarettes? none. 19 these are some of the photos. you have seen 20 these. you go look. none. 21 the plaintiff has the burden to prove her case 22 with evidence. what does not prove the case is 23 rhetoric. argument does not prove the case. 24 assumptions, speculation, what may have happened, 25 what could have happened, what might have happened, that is not evidence. 2 and generic allegations, allegations that 3 could be put anywhere do not help the plaintiff 4 sustain her burden to prove her case. 5 i do not know, we have heard -- and we are going 6 to talk about this, but remember how this evidence 7 came in. we are going to talk about dr. cowen, 8 we are going to talk about ms. cavalier and 9 mr. possidento. 10 who played their depositions in this case? 11 the plaintiff put those depositions in evidence. 12 if it was not credible, if it was not 13 believable, why would the plaintiff put them in the 14 case? why would they read their depositions? 15 i want to also make one thing clear, members 16 of the jury, because you are going to see -- and 17 you have heard some argument about this point. let us 18 make this point very clear at the outset. 19 these are all the warnings that appeared on 20 packs of cigarettes starting in 1966. the 21 plaintiff admits -- it is not disputed, we are not 22 fighting over it, we are not fussing over it, we are 23 not guessing at it. 24 we know that the plaintiff admits that the 25 warnings were adequate, adequate as a matter of law. and the plaintiff, a stipulation, folks, 2 agreed to, does not dispute their adequacy. 3 these warnings starting in 1966, they were 4 adequate. they have already stipulated to that. why 5 all the rhetoric, why all the arguments, why 6 everything else are they telling you about this, 7 what was said, what was not said, what could have 8 been said, what might have been said, and sometimes 9 what should have been said? 10 because they admit that the warnings were 11 adequate, and they do not dispute that they were 12 adequate. 13 i showed you this slide at the beginning of 14 the case. it is what i ended my opening statement 15 on, was what are the facts that are actually going 16 to help you make the decision in this case? what 17 are the facts? 18 number 1, mr. cavalier did not die from 19 coronary artery disease caused by smoking. we will 20 go through that. 21 we talk about this: there is no evidence that 22 he smoked r.j. reynolds cigarettes before 1961 when 23 he was 38 years old. 24 we also know that he continued to smoke for 25 decades despite repeated specific warnings, including those on the pack of cigarettes, about 2 the dangers, starting before we even know he smoked 3 an r.j.r. brand -- r.j.r. cigarette. 4 look, we have unanimity on this as well, and 5 we will talk about this. mr. cavalier always had the 6 ability to quit, always. their witnesses, their 7 expert witnesses, every single one of them: 8 everybody, every single person has the ability to 9 quit. 10 and the fact of the matter, until he decided 11 in 1989, he was not motivated to quit. when he was 12 motivated, he quit. if he was motivated in the 13 '50s, '60s, '70s, he would have quit, too. why 14 would we think anything else? why would we guess 15 about anything else? he quit. he can quit. 16 and finally, mr. cavalier's smoking decisions 17 were not influenced by anything r.j. reynolds said 18 or did. 19 now, i'm going to cover some of these topics; 20 and then mr. persons is going to finish and deal 21 with some of the other ones. 22 the plaintiff failed to prove mr. cavalier as 23 a class member. i'm going to handle that part of 24 the argument. 25 failed to prove mr. cavalier died because information about the dangers and addictiveness of 2 smoking were unknown or unavailable. 3 and failed to prove that mrs. fanali, on 4 behalf of the estate of thomas cavalier, is 5 entitled to recover money damages on behalf of her 6 mother, ann cavalier, when she, herself, admits 7 that it was her father's own decision, her words, 8 own decision to quit or not to quit. 9 all right. look familiar? hopefully it does. 10 this is what we showed you in opening statement. 11 for class membership, for the first two 12 questions on the verdict form, the plaintiff has to 13 clear three hurdles. 14 first, they must prove that mr. cavalier died 15 from coronary artery disease and that that coronary 16 artery disease was caused by smoking. 17 second: if they clear that hurdle, they have 18 to establish that mr. cavalier was addicted to 19 nicotine. i'll talk about that. 20 and if they clear those two hurdles, they also 21 have to prove that addiction to r.j. reynolds 22 cigarettes was a legal cause of mr. cavalier's 23 death. 24 and "legal cause," it is in your instruction 25 booklet. we will talk about what "legal cause" means, was a legal cause of mr. cavalier's death. 2 so here's the first question on the verdict 3 form: "was smoking cigarettes a legal cause of 4 mr. cavalier's coronary artery disease..." 5 so there are two parts to this right, right? 6 that is the first part, "was smoking cigarettes a 7 legal cause of mr. cavalier's coronary artery 8 disease and...was coronary artery disease a legal 9 cause of his death?" 10 that is the medical causation component. two 11 components, right? 12 did it cause, was it a legal cause of the 13 coronary artery disease; and if so, did the 14 coronary artery disease, was it a legal cause of 15 his death. 16 now, look, we talked about this before; and it 17 makes your job challenging, even more difficult 18 than otherwise, because the judge has already 19 instructed you that the plaintiff cannot recover 20 money damages for lung cancer or copd and you are 21 sitting there and you know, even according to their 22 theory, that copd was a cause of death. 23 and this is where this instruction is so 24 critical. does anger help you make your decision 25 in this case? does sympathy help you make your decision in this case? 2 justice, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, is 3 following the law. taking the facts as you find 4 them and following the law, that is justice in this 5 country. 6 i agree with mr. gary, lady justice is blind. 7 it is not a popularity contest. it is not have you 8 done bad things. that is not justice. justice is 9 looking at the facts, deciding what you have heard 10 from that witness stand, what the truth is. and 11 then it is about you have got it, justice is following 12 the law, plain and simple. 13 that is the way it is in america. we do not let 14 prejudice, we do not let sympathy, we do not let bias 15 decide things in a court of law. we do not let 16 anger decide things in a court of law. we let the 17 facts decide, and we let following the law decide. 18 that is justice in the united states of america; and 19 everybody, everybody is entitled to that justice. 20 all right. five times, five sustained 21 objections, talking about what -- 22 mr. acosta: objection, your honor. 23 the court: sustained. 24 mr. gary: and move to have it stricken. 25 the court: sustained. gary: thank you. 2 mr. hohnbaum: let us look -- you have this in 3 your instructions. it is not complicated. it is not 4 a complicated concept. 5 on the first question of whether smoking was a 6 legal cause of coronary artery disease, it is a 7 legal cause "if it directly and in natural and 8 continuous sequence produced or contributed 9 substantially to producing such coronary artery 10 disease --" here's the point -- "so that it can be 11 said that, but for smoking cigarettes, the coronary 12 artery disease would not have occurred." 13 then, lest we miss the point, the jury 14 instruction looks at it just from the other side of 15 the coin, right? 16 mr. acosta: i have an objection to this 17 slide. it is not the whole jury instruction. 18 mr. hohnbaum: neither did they put up -- 19 the court: that is fine. it is overruled. 20 mr. hohnbaum: in other words, the plaintiff 21 must prove that, but for mr. cavalier's cigarette 22 smoking, he would not have developed coronary 23 artery disease. 24 if he developed it from something else, 25 regardless of his smoking, then they have failed to prove to you that smoking was the cause as opposed 2 to something else. 3 now, look, i've been here a long time. at the 4 end of the day, quite simply, ladies and gentlemen 5 of the jury, this fact, and this fact alone, is 6 determinative of this case, because what we know is 7 that during mr. cavalier's life, diabetes, diabetes 8 caused coronary artery disease. it caused it 100 9 percent of the time. put smoking on the moon, put 10 it on some other planet. assume he never smoked 11 any cigarette in his life, not one. the fact of 12 the matter is mr. cavalier was going to get 13 diabetes -- was going to get coronary artery 14 disease because he had diabetes. it was not caused 15 by smoking. it has to be but for, but for the 16 smoking, he would not have got it. he got it and 17 was going to get it from diabetes alone. 18 did anybody challenge that proposition? 19 dr. feingold looked at that. nobody. diabetes 20 caused the coronary artery disease, and it caused 21 damage. smoking could not be the "but for" cause, 22 because even if he did not smoke, he was going to 23 get it. 24 look, this is -- at this point in time, you 25 have got this, i know you have it. he had diabetes since 1974. you know that. nobody is fussing 2 about that, no one is disputing that, no one is 3 jumping up and down and saying, "that ain't true." 4 it is the truth. he was on it since 1974 and he had 5 problems controlling it. 1974, had diabetes. 6 we know that diabetes ran in mr. cavalier's 7 family. his mother, you remember that, his mother 8 died from complications of diabetes in 1968. his 9 daughter has diabetes. neither one of them are 10 smokers. 11 dr. cowen, i'm going to talk a lot about him. 12 so another way of saying that is even if he never 13 smoked, he may very well have had coronary artery 14 disease anyway, correct? yes. 15 the diabetes alone, whether he smoked a 16 cigarette or not, is that a significant enough risk 17 factor to have caused the coronary artery disease? 18 and the answer to that question is yes. dr. cowen 19 agrees. dr. cowen agrees with dr. wohlgelernter, 20 who says at that time, when he was alive -- things 21 have improved, but when he was alive, diabetes 22 equalled coronary artery disease. that is how it 23 worked. 24 dr. feingold, we will talk a little bit about 25 him. diabetes, the most important risk factor in the development of coronary artery disease? yes, 2 he says. 3 and then, of course, we have got 4 dr. wohlgelernter. 5 "in your patients who have diabetes in the 6 '70s, '80s, and early '90s, what percentage of 7 those patients who had diabetes also had coronary 8 artery disease?" 9 and what does he say? what does he say? what 10 percentage? every single one of them, every single 11 one of them, and that is because it is established at 12 that point in time, scientific fact, that diabetes 13 causes coronary artery disease one hundred percent of the 14 time. 15 how can they meet their burden of proving to 16 you that but for smoking, he would not have coronary 17 artery disease? of course, he would have had 18 coronary artery disease. he had it because of the 19 diabetes. they cannot meet even the first threshold 20 question of whether or not smoking was a legal 21 cause of the coronary artery disease because, of 22 course, it was not. he was going to have diabetes, 23 no matter what. 24 let us just be very clear about this. the long 25 list of engle diseases that you heard, i think it is in your jury instructions, is diabetes on that 2 list? of course, it is not. it is not an engle 3 disease. and nobody told you from that witness 4 stand, and that is because they cannot tell you from 5 that witness stand, that diabetes is caused by 6 smoking. that is because it is not. it is not caused 7 by smoking. 8 diabetes caused mr. cavalier's coronary artery 9 disease. 10 but, look, he had other risk factors. right? 11 i mean, this is -- you have this. he had family 12 history, tolinase, gender, age, and lack of 13 physical activity. once again, there is unanimity, 14 everyone agrees that those are risk factors for 15 coronary artery disease. 16 let us talk about family history. father had a 17 heart attack, positive family history. father died 18 at 83 of coronary artery disease. those are notes, 19 ladies and gentlemen of the jury, from 20 cardiologists. 21 why are they asking this question of him? why 22 is it important to them? what does "positive" 23 mean? it means that mr. cavalier had a family 24 history of heart disease, and that is a significant 25 risk factor for developing that disease. dr. wohlgelernter, after five years, and we 2 know that he developed coronary artery disease, 3 according to the evidence, sometime in 1990, right, 4 1990? he had diabetes since 1974. is that over 5 five years? yes, it is well over five years. 100 6 percent of the people. 7 let us go to the elmo, jesse. 8 is this the button i'm supposed to push? 9 all right. so you will have the verdict form, 10 right? 11 boy, that is slow. this late in the day, we will 12 have to switch this up. let me just do this. all 13 right. verdict form, the first question, right, 14 has two parts to it: was smoking cigarettes a 15 legal cause of thomas cavalier's coronary artery 16 disease? that is the first prong of that. was it a 17 legal cause, and it is not a legal cause if you take 18 smoking out of the picture, and he still would have 19 gotten coronary artery disease, and that is the 20 evidence in this case. 21 the plaintiff cannot meet her burden to prove 22 the very first -- the very first thing that they 23 are -- have to prove to you. no, on the verdict 24 form. first question. 25 facts, facts, evidence, facts, and following the law. 2 now, you can go ahead and shut that down, 3 jesse. 4 here's what the evidence showed, that 5 mr. cavalier died from severe copd. coronary 6 artery disease was not a legal cause of 7 mr. cavalier's death. this is not complicated. 8 i said in opening, "where would you go and who 9 would you trust? where would you go to determine 10 what caused somebody's death?" 11 you go to the death certificate. that is where 12 you would go, and i want to just make it very clear 13 to you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that the 14 same instruction, the same language you have for 15 whether or not smoking was a legal cause of 16 coronary artery disease is the same one you have 17 with respect to whether or not coronary artery 18 disease caused mr. cavalier's death. they must 19 prove that but for mr. cavalier's cigarette 20 smoking, he would not have -- 21 do you have the other one up? 22 mr. acosta: objection, your honor, that is not 23 the whole thing. 24 the court: overruled. 25 mr. hohnbaum: let us clear the air on that. can we just clear the air? 2 ladies and gentlemen of the jury, of course, 3 two things can combine and cause somebody's death. 4 of course. is that novel? that is not novel. of 5 course, two things can cause somebody's death. 6 the fact is they have to prove that coronary 7 artery disease was a legal cause of his death, that 8 if coronary artery disease was not in the picture, 9 if you put it up on the moon, they have to prove he 10 would not die. 11 mr. acosta: objection, your honor. 12 mr. hohnbaum: that is exactly the standard. 13 the court: overruled. 14 mr. hohnbaum: that is exactly the standard. 15 mr. acosta: same objection. 16 the court: overruled. 17 mr. hohnbaum: do not get the concurring cause 18 instruction, come up here and tell you there is 19 concurring cause. nobody -- the judge is not going 20 to let them tell you that it is anything that "but 21 for." "but for" did the coronary artery disease 22 cause his death? if it was not in the picture, he 23 still would have died anyway. 24 mr. acosta: objection, your honor, same 25 objection. court: overruled. 2 mr. hohnbaum: all right. so you pull that 3 instruction out. pull it out. when you get back 4 in the jury room, you pull it out, and you read it. 5 it is not complicated. it is not difficult to 6 understand. 7 so what does the death certificate say? we have 8 heard a lot of talk about the death certificate. 9 but what everybody agrees to, what dr. feingold 10 agrees to, what dr. cowen agrees to, what 11 dr. wohlgelernter agrees to, is death certificates 12 are important legal documents. it is the standard 13 of care. every single witness told you it is the 14 standard of care of medical professionals 15 throughout the country to fill out the death 16 certificate accurately and completely. 17 nobody said anything different. nobody said 18 that somehow this is something nobody pays any 19 attention to. it is the death certificate, ladies 20 and gentlemen of the jury. and what we know from 21 dr. cowen is he knew what the requirements were. 22 he knew it was an important legal document, and we 23 know from dr. cowen that he filled it out, and he 24 filled it out accurately. so let us just recap. 25 did mr. cavalier have extensive and severe copd? did he have extensive copd? nobody is -- he 2 did. record after record after record after record 3 show that not only did he have it, but that it was 4 getting worse, and it was getting worse, and it was 5 getting worse, and what happens with somebody who 6 has copd, what happens is that they start getting 7 infections, and they start getting pneumonia, and 8 they start having fevers, and they have to go to 9 the hospital more frequently. 10 and, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, what 11 happened to mr. cavalier? that is what happened to 12 mr. cavalier. that is exactly what happened to him. 13 let us talk about the final hospitalization, 14 because no one is going to come up here and tell 15 you that he did not have severe life-threatening 16 copd. the last hospitalization, what is he admitted 17 for? he is admitted for copd and congestive heart 18 failure. the only records that we have for the 19 last 10 days -- today that we have for the last 10 20 days of his life are reports, not the films, but 21 reports of portable chest x-rays. 22 what we saw from dr. wohlgelernter yesterday 23 is that mr. cavalier's heart failure was treated, 24 and it improved. that is what the evidence shows. 25 and at the same time that the congestive heart failure was improving, the copd was worsening, and 2 the severe copd caused his death. 3 look, maybe you remember dr. feingold. 4 dr. feingold did not take you through each of these 5 x-rays, reports of x-rays, that dr. wohlgelernter 6 did. dr. wohlgelernter did not run from the 7 evidence in the case. he went through it in 8 painstaking detail. why would we do that? because 9 those records establish that the congestive heart 10 failure was being treated, it was improving, and it 11 did not cause his death. 12 what do we know about congestive heart 13 failure? i know that is a lot of medical concepts 14 being thrown at you, but what we know from their 15 own witnesses is that it can get better from day to 16 day, right? we know that one day you can have an 17 episode of congestive heart failure, and the next 18 day, you can improve and be fine. the congestive 19 heart failure will have been remedied, and that is 20 not to say you will not have another episode of 21 congestive heart failure, but it is that variable. 22 it can vary day to day, middle of the day to end of 23 the day. that is what we know. we do not have to go 24 any farther than their own witness for that. now, 25 look, very important piece of information. in may of 1990, we talked about the ejection 2 fraction, and the ejection fraction, as 3 dr. wohlgelernter said, is not -- did not tell you 4 that he had congestive heart failure. it says that 5 he is got a weakened heart muscle, and sometimes 6 that can lead to congestive heart failure and 7 sometimes it does not, right? 8 we know that in may of 1990, although we do not 9 have an echocardiogram, we have a record that 10 refers to it that says he had an ejection fraction 11 of 30 to 35 percent. think may 1990. 12 we know from the records that in july of 1993, 13 in the last couple weeks of his life, the last 14 ejection fraction reading we have shows that his 15 ejection fraction was -- what was it? 29 percent. 16 essentially the same reading as he had three years 17 earlier; yet, they want you to believe that this 18 somehow, this 29 percent, would have caused his 19 death. would have caused his death? he had 20 essentially the same thing three years ago. ask 21 yourself whether that makes any sense at all. 22 what do we know from dr. feingold? we know 23 that a person can live with and function with an 24 ejection fraction of 29 percent. that is what he 25 had. i asked him the specific question. i wanted to know what he was going to say. 2 can somebody live? we know that is true. how 3 do we know it is true? we know it is true because he 4 was living with an ejection fraction of around 29 5 percent three years before, and what was he doing 6 when he had the ejection fraction of 30 to 35 7 percent in 1990, what was he doing? 8 he was taking long trips, deadheading hard 9 trips, on death's door? significant enough to 10 cause death? he was driving, deadheading it up to 11 connecticut and back. it makes no sense. 12 you have seen this before. reasonable degree of 13 medical certainty, reasonable degree of medical 14 certainty. reasonable degree of medical 15 probability. that is the standard, right? that is 16 the magic words that the lawyers use and the 17 witnesses say, "oh, yeah, reasonable degree of 18 medical certainty, that is what i'm testifying to 19 you about." 20 what does dr. feingold not have that dr. cowen 21 who filled out the death certificate had? all of 22 these, every single one. there is no dispute that 23 these documents would have existed at the time. 24 there is no doubt about that. 25 ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you also heard that congestive heart failure is not 2 complicated. it is not one of those things that you 3 need to get some advanced degree in. it is like 4 medical school 101. and what they want you to 5 believe is that dr. cowen, on these records, saw 6 evidence that congestive heart failure caused his 7 death. they want you to think that he saw all of 8 this, and all of that must have said the congestive 9 heart failure was so bad, so much of a problem, 10 that it caused his death. but of course, he 11 did not. 12 it is fair to ask yourself this question: why 13 would dr. cowen, who had all of this information, 14 why would dr. cowen put down that the only cause of 15 his death -- and then he affirmed it just a little 16 while ago, a month or so ago at his deposition -- 17 that copd was the only cause of his death? and the 18 only reasonable conclusion that can be drawn from 19 that is that none of this evidence that he had but 20 that dr. feingold does not have and we do not have 21 today, that that evidence supported that the only 22 cause of death was copd. 23 i asked dr. wohlgelenter -- last question last 24 night -- did anybody on the planet know more about 25 mr. cavalier's medical condition than dr. peter cowen. did dr. feingold? of course not. 2 dr. cowen had all the information. 3 we have heard lots of things about dr. cowen. 4 maybe he was not paying attention. maybe he was not 5 taking his job seriously. what do we know from 6 dr. feingold, who reviewed all the records? what 7 did dr. feingold say about dr. cowen? did he say 8 he looked sloppy. did he say he was not -- did not 9 know what was going on? did he say he would not 10 have been able to determine whether or not 11 congestive heart failure caused a man's death? 12 did he say any of those things? he did not. 13 what he said, by contrast, was that dr. cowen 14 was, in quotation marks, qualified, capable, and 15 competent. that is dr. cowen from dr. feingold's 16 perspective. not sloppy, not not paying attention, 17 not not doing his job, not being cavalier about 18 filling out a legal document. 19 dr. feingold himself, qualified, competent, 20 and capable. 21 all right. so i do not know, what do you do if 22 you are the plaintiff? what do you do with that? 23 well, you try to kick up some dust. right? 24 so all the testimony about is that dr. cowen's 25 signature? well, it does not look like signature 15 years later. is that really his 2 signature? is that really an h and a w. is that 3 really all of that? i do not -- who would we ask? 4 they played his -- they had his deposition. what 5 did dr. cowen say? dr. cowen, as recently as two 6 months ago, said, it is my signature. 7 why have some discussion, why have somebody 8 suggest that somehow it is not his signature? 9 that is the very definition of a red herring. the 10 man, under oath, said it is his signature. 11 the court: let me just ask, any jurors need a 12 break? everybody okay? i just wanted to make sure 13 everybody is okay. anybody need a break? 14 jurors: yes. 15 mr. hohnbaum: dr. cowen, it is not just that, 16 back in 1993, he thought -- it is not just back in 17 1993 that he thought that copd was the only cause 18 of death. because his deposition was read and he is 19 saying, yes, i certify, by signing this death 20 certificate, that copd was the only cause of 21 mr. cavalier's death, the only cause. 22 and ladies and gentlemen of the jury, think 23 about it: he treated mr. cavalier. he treated 24 mrs. cavalier. he treated one of the daughters, 25 jeanne, maybe one of the daughters. remember, that was the testimony, he was my doctor and i gave him 2 the letter and all that stuff. 3 he was a family physician. if he had 4 something to say that would be helpful -- if he had 5 something to say that would be helpful to the 6 plaintiff's case -- you heard in his deposition, 7 would you go to trial? i asked him: "did they ask 8 you to go to trial?" he does not have anything 9 helpful to say. 10 what he has to say is that copd was the only 11 cause of death and he stuck with that even after he 12 had been shown medical records prior to his 13 deposition. and you see in the -- you heard in the 14 reading of his deposition that a lawyer for the 15 plaintiff was there, did not ask any questions. he 16 had met with mr. cavalier prior to the deposition. 17 remember that? 30 minutes, 40 minutes, phone call, 18 they actually met, sat down, talked to him. had 19 every opportunity to try to figure out whether 20 dr. cowen could say something other than "copd 21 caused his death," and the answer was he could not 22 because that is the truth. copd is what caused his 23 death. 24 now, look, think about it. dr. feingold was a 25 pulmonologist, a lung doctor. that is his training, that is his experience, he is a pulmonologist. they 2 brought a pulmonologist to talk to you about 3 coronary artery disease. they brought -- they 4 brought a pulmonologist to talk to you about 5 coronary artery disease, not a cardiologist. they 6 brought a pulmonologist to talk to you about 7 addiction, not a psychiatrist. 8 dr. feingold, $40 million, $40 million 9 testifying. that is what he does. that is how he 10 earns his money. $40 million. that is who they 11 brought to tell you that something other than copd 12 caused this man's death. 13 ladies and gentlemen, there are cardiologists 14 in florida. there are cardiologists right down the 15 street. there are cardiologists that could have 16 come in and testified for the plaintiff. instead, 17 they bring in the $40-million-man. 18 now, look, you know the saying, "a picture is 19 worth a thousand words." yeah, i thought i 20 stumbled on that. 21 look, take a look at that and think about this 22 for a second. just think about this slide. this 23 was dr. feingold's own slide. he prepared it. 24 you have seen it before. does anything jump out at 25 you about this slide? his clinical practice, do you see "cardiology" on there? it is his own slide. 2 did you see "addiction" on there, clinical 3 practice? he is not a cardiologist, ladies and 4 gentlemen of the jury, and he is not a psychiatrist. 5 and according to his own document that he prepared 6 that he probably uses in all kind of cases, what 7 does he say? cardiology is not his expertise, and 8 neither is addiction. 9 i think it is also interesting in this 10 particular case, under these particular facts, 11 that -- what is he looking into? a microscope. do 12 we have any pathology in this case? do we have any 13 slides to help determine what happened to 14 mr. cavalier? they existed at one point in time, 15 but do we have any now? no. 16 what is in the background here? what do you 17 see in the background here? actual x-rays, the 18 films. not reports of the x-rays, but the films. 19 do we have any films? we do not have a single film. 20 you know who had access to pathology? dr. cowen 21 did. 22 do you know who had access, and undoubtedly 23 saw films, x-ray films? dr. cowen, the doctor who, 24 under oath, said copd was the only cause of death. 25 now, to dr. feingold's credit, he acknowledged -- as he had to, he would look silly 2 if he did not -- that the fact that there was no 3 discharge summary -- remember, if somebody is in 4 the hospital, they leave the hospital, they pass 5 away, there is a death summary. there is a 6 discharge summary. 7 the fact that we do not have it, the fact that 8 we do not have it, it limited what he could 9 ultimately decide. that is his own words and it has 10 to be the case because he is trying to come in here 11 and tell you, within a reasonable degree of medical 12 certainty, what happened to this man when he 13 does not have the information necessary to make that 14 determination and dr. cowen did. 15 all right. this is -- so we have -- maybe 16 dr. cowen did not sign the death certificate. maybe 17 it is somebody else's signature. that does not work. 18 right? 19 we have this, the ultimate red herring in the 20 case. so this is 2008. this is 15 years after he 21 passes away, and dr. cowen is asked by somebody in 22 mr. cavalier's family to do a letter for him. 23 there is only one thing you need to know about this 24 letter, and that that is dr. cowen acknowledged both 25 that he signed it and that it is wrong. that is all you need to know. right? he signed it and it is 2 wrong. he did not have his records. the family 3 thought it was lung cancer that caused his death. 4 he filled out the form, the letter, and he moved it 5 along. 6 did he go and amend the death certificate to 7 say something else? no. why not? because he 8 knows, as he said in this case under oath, that 9 copd was the only cause of death. 10 the only doctor specializing in cardiology, 11 specializing in the disease of coronary artery 12 disease, the only doctor who has devoted his entire 13 practice of medicine to cardiac issues, 14 dr. wohlgelenter, told you he did not die from 15 coronary artery disease. 16 but for -- put coronary artery disease on the 17 moon, and mr. cavalier is going to die anyway 18 because he died from copd. 19 that is the second part of the first question, 20 which we contend you should not get to, just so 21 we are clear. we have to be thorough, we have to go 22 through everything, but the first question of 23 whether or not thomas cavalier -- was smoking a 24 legal cause of thomas cavalier's coronary artery 25 disease? we have already talked about that. the answer is no because diabetes caused it, does 100 2 percent of the time. 3 but they also have to prove that coronary 4 artery disease was a legal cause of his death. but 5 for coronary artery disease, he would not have died. 6 mr. acosta: objection, your honor, that is not 7 right. 8 mr. hohnbaum: that is indeed the standard. 9 the court: overruled. 10 mr. hohnbaum: even if they -- first check 11 mark, second check mark, they do not -- did not 12 meet their burden to prove to you that smoking was 13 a legal cause of coronary artery disease or that 14 coronary artery disease caused his death. the 15 answer to the first question on the verdict form is 16 no. 17 but as i talked about, we have to go through 18 the rest of the verdict form. unfortunately for 19 you at 10 to 6:00, that is what we have to do. we 20 appreciate you staying with us as we talk to you. 21 here's the second question on the verdict 22 form: was thomas cavalier addicted to cigarettes 23 containing nicotine? and if so, was an addiction 24 to cigarettes manufactured by r.j. reynolds a legal 25 cause -- legal cause, a but for cause -- of coronary artery disease and death? 2 this is what we talked about. we showed that 3 before. that is the hurdle, right, addiction. 4 the dsm-5. you heard a lot about addiction in 5 this case. let me see if i cannot straighten some 6 things out. 7 what is the state of the art as it relates to 8 nicotine addiction in this country? not stuff from 9 2010, not stuff from 2008. 2015, today, what is the 10 state of the art? 11 the state of the art is the dsm-5. studies 12 come out, people get more knowledgeable, more 13 information comes out, things are updated. the 14 dsm-5 does not stay stale. there were reiterations 15 of the dsm-iv and they came out with the dsm-5. 16 who came out with it? the american psychiatric 17 association. 18 that document from dr. barnett, the dsm-5: 19 half of all daily smokers are addicted. half. 20 let us just start from there. we are not saying that 21 people were not addicted to cigarettes, ladies and 22 gentlemen. of course they are. of course they 23 are. but the evidence, the facts, not guess work, 24 not speculation, the facts are that half of daily 25 smokers are not addicted. we know, look, say all you want about 2 dr. barnett. dr. barnett agrees with dr. benowitz 3 that there are reasons other than nicotine 4 addiction for why people smoke. taste, smell, 5 enjoyment, relaxation, ritual. that is undeniable. 6 their own expert says it. we do not have to guess. 7 we are not fussing about that. 8 there are reasons other than nicotine for why 9 people smoke, and that makes perfect sense. 10 i have an app on my phone, it is a calculator. 11 you can get on the app store and get a calculator. 12 what it comes down to is that the plaintiff's 13 witnesses are saying that all you need is a 14 calculator to diagnose someone with addiction, 15 that is all you need. 16 why did the $40-million-man come in and 17 testify from that stand when all you need, all you 18 need is just to add up the cigarettes? we will just 19 add them up. that is addiction, we will just add. 20 one, two, three, four, we will get to the point. 21 that is how we are going to determine whether 22 somebody is addicted or not. it is really 23 dr. benowitz's point. 24 dr. barnett, what did she do? she said, look, 25 i put my faith in the american psychiatric association. i put my faith in the dsm-5. so i am 2 going to use that and apply actual diagnostic 3 criteria to determine whether or not this man was 4 addicted. [#deleted recess#] [#deleted council discussion#] 13 mr. hohnbaum: first, let me say thank you for 14 the 10 o'clock start time. we appreciate it 15 ourselves. 16 indulge me for just a moment and let me go 17 over, if i could, very briefly just to reorient 18 ourselves about where we were. we had the three 19 hurdles. the first two questions on the verdict 20 form deal with class membership. all the 21 information that you heard in this trial about 22 conspiracies and concealment, what was said and 23 what was not said, are not to be considered when 24 you decide the first two questions on the verdict 25 forms. you have to put those out of your mind and you have to focus on the questions -- the first two 2 questions on the verdict form. the rest of the 3 stuff does not matter to those questions. 4 medical causation, addiction, addiction 5 causation. we spent a lot of time yesterday 6 talking about medical causation. smoking was not a 7 legal cause of mr. cavalier's coronary artery 8 disease. he was going to get it any way because of 9 diabetes. one hundred percent, one hundred percent certainty. and 10 coronary artery disease was not a legal cause of 11 mr. cavalier's death. 12 he died from copd. if he did not have coronary 13 artery disease, he was going to die anyway. that 14 is the fact. 15 this is just a brief summary. he had diabetes 16 since 1974, was poorly controlled. diabetes caused 17 the coronary artery disease. his congestive heart 18 failure, dr. wohlgelenter went through it 19 painstakingly, x-ray by x-ray. it was treated and 20 under control. the ejection fraction he had in 21 1990 was the same ejection fraction he had two 22 weeks before he passed away. and they are claiming 23 that caused his death. 24 and severe copd. there is no doubt he had 25 severe copd. exacerbations, in the hospital, infections, there is no question he had copd. 2 the plaintiff has the burden here, folks, to 3 prove medical causation to you, and as i did 4 yesterday with the verdict form -- of course, when 5 you give lawyers more time to do something, they 6 will do it. 7 all right. so two components to that verdict 8 form: was smoking a cause of the coronary artery 9 disease? no. 10 was coronary artery disease a legal cause of 11 his death? no. 12 all right. let me move on to where i was 13 starting yesterday. 14 even if they prove to you those two things -- 15 smoking caused the coronary artery disease, and 16 coronary artery disease caused his death -- they 17 still have to prove to you that mr. cavalier was 18 addicted. 19 as with every question, you need to decide in 20 this case, where do you go to determine what the 21 law is? you go to the instructions, and here's 22 what the instruction says. i've got to tell you, 23 you are -- you can look through those as hard as 24 you want to, and as carefully as you want to and 25 you will not see the term "addiction" defined. you will not see it defined. 2 and so one of the things you are going to have 3 to decide as a jury is what does the term 4 "addiction" mean, and who are -- what are you going 5 to use to help you decide that. 6 well, i talked a little bit about the dsm-5. 7 we are going to talk about that in a second. 8 half of all daily smokers -- current, state of 9 the art knowledge of addiction -- are not addicted. 10 smokers smoke for reasons other than 11 addiction. right? if half the people are addicted 12 and half the people are not addicted, those are 13 daily smokers, some people are smoking for reasons 14 other than addiction to nicotine. and we talked 15 about some of those reasons with dr. barnett. we 16 talked about some of that with dr. feingold. i 17 think dr. benowitz also answered questions about 18 that. 19 and then dr. barnett talked about the 20 half-life nicotine and peak saturation. and i want 21 to do it this way, ladies and gentlemen of the 22 jury: a sponge can only absorb so much water. 23 think about it. if you take a daily vitamin, one 24 vitamin. do you take 10 vitamins in the morning? 25 no. because your body cannot absorb all of those vitamins. so you take one, just like a sponge. 2 just like a sponge. 3 the fact of the matter is mr. cavalier smoking 4 a cigarette every 10 minutes, every 12 minutes, 5 cannot be -- nicotine cannot be the reason he is 6 doing that. why? because the nicotine is staying 7 at a peak level, it never goes down. if people 8 smoke and they smoke one cigarette every 30 9 minutes, the nicotine level goes down a little bit. 10 they can have some feeling of withdrawal and they 11 want the nicotine again to get that level of 12 nicotine back up. but somebody who smokes as much 13 as mr. cavalier was not doing it solely for the 14 nicotine. he could not be. it never went down. he 15 was saturated. there was no more. 16 there had to be other reasons, and there were 17 other reasons. taste, smell, enjoyment, 18 relaxation, boredom. driving was his vocation, was 19 his job. 20 so here's what it comes down to: if you 21 define "addiction" by just the number of 22 cigarettes, right -- so we heard five cigarettes in 23 this trial. if you smoke five cigarettes a day, 24 you are addicted. some people said 10 cigarettes 25 and you are addicted. some people said a pack a day and you are addicted. if you just define 2 "addiction" by the number of cigarettes, then, 3 okay, he is addicted. right? it is circular. if 4 that is the definition, then he meets that 5 definition. 6 or you can choose to apply some actual 7 diagnostic criterion besides a calculator. on the 8 one hand, they say it is a serious medical 9 condition, and on the other, all they say you need 10 to define it is a calculator. right? 11 one hundred percent of smokers. every smoker gets a 12 smoking-related disease was addicted. $40 million, 13 $40 million to come in and tell you it is just one 14 cigarette after another. that is all it takes -- 15 mr. gary: i'm going to object. he did not get 16 paid no $40 million. 17 the court: overruled. 18 mr. gary: that is ridiculous. 19 mr. hohnbaum: $40 million. the fagerstrom 20 test, that is what they used. that is what 21 dr. feingold said on the stand is used to determine 22 whether or not somebody is addicted. the fact of 23 the matter is that test can be gotten off the 24 internet. you can fill it out in five minutes. 25 there was some discussion about, well, dsm -- mr. chestnut, the dsm, you have to be alive. 2 what is this? after you wake up. i mean, that 3 test is designed to be pulled off the internet and 4 filled out, and it can be done in five minutes. 5 anyone can apply and administer it, and there is no 6 expertise, no judgment no clinical analysis, no 7 learning, no education, no judgment whatsoever. 8 and then even the plaintiff's experts disagree 9 about this. so dr. feingold -- that is what doctors 10 typically use, they use the fagerstrom. what did 11 dr. benowitz say? it is not typically used as a 12 test to determine whether or not somebody is 13 addicted, because the test assumes you are addicted 14 and then determines what sort of severity that 15 addiction is. that is the fagerstrom test. 16 let me put to rest this concept of brain 17 changes somehow impacting this analysis. it is 18 another red herring. all right? 19 for 100 years, it is been known that nicotine 20 affects the body's receptors. we all have nicotine 21 receptors in our body. after a smoker quits, a 22 period of time, different for each smoker, but not 23 a long period of time, the receptors go back to 24 normal after a few weeks. everybody says to the 25 extent those increased brain receptors that go back to normal, to the extent that is occurring in 2 somebody, it does not prevent that smoker from 3 quitting. everybody can quit. 4 and of course, it does not affect -- it is not 5 like intoxication, right? it does not affect 6 anybody's ability to understand and appreciate the 7 risks of smoking. 8 and you remember the dopamine slide. we 9 did not put it back up here. we had the 10 methamphetamine off the charts, and then we had 11 cocaine, and then we had nicotine and caffeine. 12 the amount of dopamine that is released from 13 nicotine is just about equivalent to the amount of 14 dopamine that is released with caffeine. 15 but let me be clear: nicotine is addictive. 16 it can be addictive in certain people. no one is 17 running from that. no one is denying that. no one 18 is suggesting otherwise. 19 the issue is not whether it is addictive. the 20 issue is whether or not mr. cavalier was addicted. 21 so what -- what do we have? we have the 22 dsm-5. again, do you want to use the internet tool 23 as a test for addiction, or do you want clinical 24 analysis? 25 the dsm-5 is the gold standard. nobody denied that. dr. benowitz, their own witness, what did he 2 say about the dsm-5? he said that the dsm-5 is the 3 bible. the bible in the u.s. for the diagnosis of 4 substance abuse and other psychiatric disorders. 5 they cannot have it both ways. is it a substance 6 abuse disorder or not? if it is, the way you go 7 about diagnosing it is to use a tool that requires 8 clinical analysis and judgment. 9 and that is exactly what dr. barnett did. she 10 walked through it. why did not dr. feingold walk 11 through the dsm-5? he did not want walk to through 12 the dsm-5 because he knew what the answer was. he 13 knew what the answer was that if you went through 14 the dsm-5, there was not going to be a finding of 15 addiction, so he went back to fagerstrom, he went 16 back to the calculator. and the dsm-5 requires 17 clinically significant impairment or distress. 18 that is what it requires. it requires that your 19 life is impaired or you are distressed because of 20 your smoking. 21 evidence, evidence beyond number of cigarettes 22 is required under the dsm-5. 23 you assess the evidence you heard in the case 24 under the construct of the dsm-5. listen to 25 dr. barnett. you can see the criteria. he was able to quit. he quit the first time he was 2 motivated to do so, and there was no evidence when 3 he quit that he suffered some serious withdrawal, 4 that he had some serious problem, that he somehow 5 could not function in life because he had stopped 6 smoking. was there any evidence of withdrawal? 7 you had some witnesses say, well, maybe he went 8 down to two cigarettes or snuck a cigarette here or 9 there after 1989. did anybody say -- think about 10 it? he is smoking five packs of cigarettes a day. 11 if he goes down to one or two cigarettes, people, 12 a, they are going to notice it. they are going to 13 notice it, and then they are going to notice if 14 it is causing him any problems. and did anybody say 15 it caused him any problems? no. 16 the fact of the matter is some people can 17 quit, and they can quit easily. and that is exactly 18 the case for mr. cavalier. 19 that is not to say that people do not struggle 20 with quitting, some people do. but the evidence in 21 this case is that he did not. 22 evidence. facts. 23 mr. cavalier was not addicted. but, look, 24 even if they convince you of the medical causation, 25 even if they convince you -- even if they carry their burden of proof on addiction, they still have 2 to prove that addiction to cigarettes manufactured 3 by r.j. reynolds was a legal cause of his death. 4 where do you go first to determine what the answer 5 to that question is? the law, what you have to 6 follow in this case. 7 but for the addiction to cigarettes 8 manufactured by r.j. reynolds, the coronary artery 9 disease and death would not have occurred. because 10 if you get to this point, you have already determined 11 that the coronary artery disease was caused by 12 smoking and it caused his death. they have to 13 prove to you that but for the addiction to r.j. 14 reynolds cigarettes, he would not have had the 15 disease and died. 16 this is the first date any witness claims to 17 have seen mr. cavalier smoke r.j. reynolds 18 cigarettes, 1961, one of the daughters. the first 19 time. 20 we talked about this a little bit yesterday. 21 every single picture in this case has him smoking 22 cigarettes other than cigarettes manufactured by 23 r.j. reynolds. they have to prove to you that 24 addiction to r.j. reynolds cigarettes, not somebody 25 else's cigarettes, not some other packs of cigarettes, not somebody else's cigarettes caused 2 the disease. and smoking a pack or two of kools 3 or -- there is no suggestion that a pack or two or 4 even a carton of kools over the course of his life 5 would do it. 6 they have to prove to you that addiction to 7 r.j. reynolds cigarettes was the legal cause of his 8 coronary artery disease and death. 9 pictures. 10 even if they prove to you that r.j. reynolds 11 cigarettes were in the mix, the issue is did 12 mr. cavalier have the ability to quit but chose to 13 continue to smoke, or was he rendered powerless? 14 did the nicotine -- the addiction to nicotine drive 15 him, was it so powerful that he could not quit? 16 because if he could quit, then it was not the 17 addiction that caused a disease, it was his choice 18 not to quit. 19 yesterday mr. gary stood up here for the first 20 time in this case -- for the first time in this 21 case and said that plaintiff conceded mr. cavalier 22 was at fault. none of the witnesses said that. 23 dr. feingold did not say that. none of the 24 plaintiff's witnesses said that. but think about 25 that. what does that mean in this context? what does it mean? 2 it means that it was his -- look, if he was -- 3 ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if he was 4 powerless, nicotine made him powerless, then he 5 was not at fault. right? how could he be at fault, 6 if it was the nicotine? 7 the admission means that he chose to begin 8 smoking r.j. reynolds cigarettes despite knowing 9 the risks. he knew that smoking was dangerous. he 10 was not confused about the dangers and 11 addictiveness of smoking. 12 was there any testimony at any point in time? 13 he said, "well i did not know that. i did not know 14 that. i did not think that." there was not. 15 it says that he was responsible for quitting 16 smoking. and that if he was not able to quit 17 smoking, how could he be at fault? how could he be 18 at fault for anything if he was not able to quit 19 smoking? of course he was able to quit smoking, 20 and he was able to quit smoking at any time. 21 we have talked about this before. nicotine 22 addiction does not rob smokers of free will or as 23 dr. benowitz says, somehow change them into robots. 24 it does not do that. 25 addicted smokers, even if they are addicted, are responsible for their own actions, and 2 decisions to quit or not to quit. 3 where do we have more agreement in this case 4 than on this point? every single expert, whatever 5 their opinion is about what the definition of 6 addiction is says any smoker can quit, every single 7 one of them. and it is not just people who smoke a 8 little bit, people who smoke a pack a day. 9 let us hear what dr. benowitz has to say. do 10 we have that, jesse? 11 12 "question: and most of the people who quit 13 smoking, the 60 million that we talked about just a 14 second ago, and most of those 60 million people 15 would have met your criteria for being highly 16 addicted to cigarettes, correct? 17 "answer: a fair number. i do not know what -- 18 a fair number, yes." 19 (video clip stopped.) 20 mr. hohnbaum: that is dr. benowitz. it is not 21 just folks who smoke a pack a day, half a pack a 22 day, two packs a day. it is highly addicted 23 smokers. 24 dr. proctor and the people who quit were not 25 just light smokers, it included heavy smokers as well. and then he says it did. many people were 2 smoking, one, two, three, four, or even more packs 3 a day. absolute agreement on this point. 4 mr. cavalier, a five-pack-a-day smoker could, in 5 fact, quit. 6 we know millions and millions and millions and 7 millions of people were quitting smoking in the 8 '50s, '60s, and '70s. millions of people chose to 9 quit smoking. their choice. they chose. and many 10 of them were heavy addicted smokers like 11 mr. cavalier. 60 million. 12 then you can ask yourself was mr. cavalier 13 different? was there anything about mr. cavalier 14 that made him different from 60 million other 15 smokers who quit? were his cigarettes more 16 addictive? was his brain affected differently? 17 was he exposed to advertising different from 18 somebody else? did he smoke for longer than the 19 smokers who quit? we just know from dr. benowitz 20 and dr. proctor that there were millions of people 21 who quit smoking who were heavy smokers, or did he 22 make the choice to continue to smoke until 1989, 23 when he quit for the first time and he was 24 motivated to quit? 25 motivation. another place where we have consensus. 2 motivation is the key to quitting. let me go to 3 dr. benowitz. 4 5 "question: we alluded to a few of those a 6 amount ago, but you agree that being motivated, 7 being motivated to quit is essential to 8 successfully quitting smoking, right? 9 "answer: yes. 10 "question: now, you would agree that 11 sometimes people say "i want to quit," but they 12 do not really mean it. 13 "answer: i'm sure that happens. 14 "question: and if someone does not want to 15 quit, they are not going to quit, right? 16 "answer: that is true. 17 "question: motivation and commitment are 18 essential elements of the ability to quit smoking, 19 correct? 20 "answer: yes. 21 "question: people can say they want to quit 22 but that does not necessarily mean that they are 23 committed to doing so, right? 24 "answer: yes." 25 (video clip stopped.) mr. hohnbaum: that is clear as a bell. their 2 own witness. 3 we did talk about his personality in this 4 case, right? because that is important to 5 understand the issues in this case as it relates to 6 whether or not he had the internal constitution, 7 the personality that would allow him to quit 8 smoking if he wanted to. 9 he was intelligent, he was hardworking, of 10 course he was. he was resilient. dr. barnett 11 talked about that. he was responsible. he made 12 his own decisions about smoking. and, frankly, the 13 testimony was no one could really tell him 14 anything. he was his own man. he was his own man. 15 and the fact of the matter, he was not 16 motivated to quit. 17 so we have all the experts saying every smoker 18 can quit. even his own family said since the 19 1960s, when they encouraged him to quit, "we know 20 you can do it." they knew what kind of man he was. 21 he was the kind of man that if he set his mind to 22 something, he was going to do it. 23 he was not rendered powerless by nicotine. 24 that is not mr. cavalier. he was not rendered 25 powerless. he made his own decisions. from mrs. fanali's own mouth, whether or not he was 2 going to quit was his own decision. his own 3 decision. do not let facts that have nothing to do 4 with this question or any of these other questions 5 related to class membership get you stumbled up. 6 he could make his own decision to quit. 7 if you think about the plaintiff's theory, 8 it is that mr. cavalier had no idea that smoking was 9 dangerous, and he never quit. he had no idea that 10 smoking was dangerous. that could not be any 11 clearer. that is their testimony. that is what they 12 are trying to prove, he did not know. and they are 13 saying if he had known, if somehow he had been told 14 information, and mr. persons will address this, he 15 would have made a different decision. there is no 16 way he would have done something that he knew was 17 going to harm him. right? that is their theory. 18 but look -- and this is what -- sometimes when 19 we are putting on evidence, it is not clear, and it 20 cannot be until we get to this point to explain to 21 you why it matters. right? and mr. cavalier's 22 handling of his diabetes is not a knock on 23 mr. cavalier, it is not impugning his character, 24 it is not suggesting he was a bad person. it has 25 nothing to do with that. what it has to do with is he knew that diabetes was harmful because his mom 2 had died of diabetes. he had been treated since 3 1974. he knew what a wicked disease diabetes was. 4 and then we know, and look at the records, 5 mouth sores. let us go chase that rabbit all you 6 want and look at those medical records, and you 7 tell me whether any of those medical records 8 suggest that he was eating his ice cream for mouth 9 sores, or whether there was any evidence around 10 that time that he had mouth sores. and that is -- 11 that is the ultimate red herring. 12 the fact of the matter is he made his choice. 13 he knew it could harm him. he wanted to do it. it 14 debunks the notion that somehow if he would have 15 known smoking was harmful, he would never do 16 anything to harm his body. and this suggestion 17 about physical activity, look at the pictures and 18 determine whether or not -- you whether you heard 19 any testimony about his physical inactivity before 20 this time period. 21 he was a truck driver and a limo driver. 22 there was no testimony that he was going to the 23 gym. there was no testimony that he was going for 24 strolls. there was no testimony about that. 25 facts, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. not speculation, not guesswork. facts. 2 we -- this has been beaten to death, right? 3 throughout this time period, his glucose levels 4 were off the charts. and it was not because he 5 was not being treated. he was being treated. it 6 was because he had made a decision, knowing that it 7 could harm him, knowing that it could kill him, 8 knowing that it could cause hospitalization, 9 because he was hospitalized. he made the decision 10 to continue to engage in behavior that was harming 11 his health. 12 what did not he do? what do we know he did not 13 do. if he was motivated to quit, if he had a 14 persistent desire, if he was committed, what would 15 be the first thing you would do? what would be the 16 first thing you would you do? you would throw away 17 your cigarettes. you would get them out of your sight. 18 you would throw away your ashtrays, if he was 19 motivated. 20 he was seeing doctors. is there any evidence 21 that he went to a doctor and said, "please help me 22 stop smoking"? no evidence that he went to a stop 23 smoke cessation clinic. and you can weigh the 24 evidence on whether he actually tried to quit, but 25 let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if he actually tried to quit and did so for half a 2 day, a day, two days, he is smoking five packs a 3 day, that would be monumental. no one would miss 4 it. no one would think, oh -- it would be big news 5 in that household. 6 did anybody say anything about that? the 7 answer is no. to the extent he had some desire to 8 do it, it was to appease his wife who we know 9 did not like his smoking. 10 finally, on this point, the best evidence he 11 could quit is it dr. benowitz? is it dr. proctor? 12 is it dr. feingold? is it dr. barnett? no. the 13 best evidence is that he did. 14 the clerk: 10 minutes counsel. 15 mr. hohnbaum: that is the best evidence. when 16 he was motivated to quit, he quit. 17 and you look at the records. he quit smoking 18 prior to his lung cancer diagnosis. the lung 19 cancer diagnosis did not cause him to quit. he 20 quit with his brother before he was diagnosed. he 21 decided he was going to quit and he did. 22 now, look, the number of medical records that 23 document that he quit permanently in 1989, 34. you 24 saw this in opening. right? you will have all 25 these records. 34 records. why are they spending all of this time trying 2 to convince you that mr. cavalier never stopped 3 smoking until he could not smoke any more? why? 4 why not say on memories, it is back a little bit, 5 i'm not exactly sure. i mean, i cannot be 6 confident. i do not remember. 7 why this clinging to "he quit" in the face of 8 34 medical records, doctor after doctor, hospital 9 visit after hospital visit, doctor visit after 10 doctor visit. 11 folks, if you are smoking and i'm this far 12 away from you, we know it. look at the medical 13 records. there is no reference in the medical 14 records to "he says he is not smoking but i can 15 smell that he is smoking," or anything to suggest 16 that, in fact, he actually quit smoking. 17 the reason they are trying so hard to persuade 18 you that mr. cavalier never quit smoking is because 19 they know, just like we know, that if he quit 20 smoking in 1989, they cannot meet their burden to 21 prove that addiction to r.j. reynolds cigarettes 22 caused any disease. that is why they -- that is why. 23 that is why we are doing this dance. 24 what is this? well, is not it true -- who went 25 to doctors' visits with mr. cavalier? mrs. fanali did. she accompanied her dad. she is a good 2 daughter helping out her father. went to the 3 doctors' visits. 4 "well, is not it true that neither you nor your 5 father were ever trying to mislead your father's 6 doctors or nurses by giving them wrong 7 information?" 8 what is the information that the doctors had? 9 that he quit. and what is the answer? he either 10 did or he did not, folks. he either quit smoking or 11 he did not. the answer was: no. no, sir. he 12 might have. who knows? he might have quit. who 13 knows if they did not get that wrong, because i can 14 prove that he did not quit smoking. 15 getting caught up in the facts of the case, 16 the facts are he quit; we cannot say he quit, 17 because if we say he quit, we cannot prove that 18 addiction caused the disease. 19 cannot both be true, right? the medical 20 records cannot be true if he did not quit smoking. 21 "you never heard him lie to the doctors or the 22 nurses about his medical history, did you?" 23 "not that -- no." 24 ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the 25 plaintiffs have failed to prove to you that mr. cavalier was addicted or that addiction to 2 r.j. reynolds cigarettes was a legal cause of any 3 disease. the answer to this question, if you get 4 to it, and you should not get to it, let me make 5 that very clear, is no. 6 thank you for your attention. i'm going to 7 turn things over to mr. persons. 14 mr. persons: counsel, mrs. fanali, ladies and 15 gentlemen, good morning. 16 we have been together for three weeks now, and i 17 want to add my voice to the chorus and thank you 18 for your patience, your indulgence, your dedication 19 to this process. without you, obviously it 20 would not function, and you have been most attentive, 21 and we all greatly, greatly appreciate it. 22 i'm going to talk to you about the last five 23 questions on the verdict form, and i will not spend a 24 lot of time doing it. we will move through it as 25 efficiently as we can, but they are very, very, like all the questions, they are very important 2 questions. 3 when we started this process, i told you that 4 it was my objective to bring you the evidence that 5 would help you answer the questions on the verdict 6 form. and i submit we have done that, and i'll go 7 through some of that at this time. 8 the questions 3 and 4: "did thomas cavalier 9 reasonably rely to his detriment on either a 10 statement or omission of material fact made by 11 r.j. reynolds that concealed or omitted material 12 information not otherwise known or available 13 concerning the health effects or the addictive 14 nature of smoking cigarettes; and if so, was such 15 reliance a legal cause of mr. cavalier's coronary 16 artery disease and death?" 17 if you answer no to question 3, you skip to 18 question 4 and proceed to question 5. i submit to 19 you the answer will be no. we will talk about why. 20 number 4. "did thomas cavalier reasonably 21 rely to his detriment on either a statement or 22 omission made in furtherance of r.j. reynolds' 23 agreement to conceal information not otherwise 24 known or available concerning the health effects or 25 addictive nature of smoking cigarettes; and if so, was such reliance a legal cause of mr. cavalier's 2 coronary artery disease?" 3 again, it is no. 4 and then we look at the jury instructions, 5 because they provide us guidance in making this 6 determination. the issue for your determination on 7 plaintiff's claim for fraudulent concealment 8 against r.j. reynolds is whether mr. cavalier 9 reasonably relied to his detriment on either a 10 statement or an omission made by r.j. reynolds that 11 concealed or omitted material information, 12 information that was not otherwise known or 13 available, regarding the health effects of 14 cigarettes or their addictive nature, and whether 15 such reliance was a legal cause of his coronary 16 artery disease and death. 17 and then the law helps us. it provides us 18 guidance in terms of telling us what that means. 19 in this case, a material fact is one that is of 20 such importance that mr. cavalier would not have 21 acted as he did but for the concealment or omission 22 of that fact. 23 in other words, it would be a game-changer. 24 it is that kind of fact. it is a material fact. not 25 just any fact, but a material fact. and in order to meet their burden, the 2 plaintiff has to show that there is a connection 3 between concealment and agreement to conceal and 4 mr. cavalier's coronary artery disease that they 5 contend was the cause of death and they failed to 6 prove that mr. cavalier died because of the dangers 7 and addictiveness of smoking were unknown or 8 unavailable to you. 9 you cannot conceal what is already known, and 10 we are going to demonstrate what was already known. 11 reasonable reliance on either a statement or 12 omission by r.j. reynolds that concealed or omitted 13 information, material information, was a legal 14 cause if it directly and in a natural and 15 continuous sequence caused the death so that it can 16 reasonably be said that but for the reliance the 17 coronary artery disease and death would not have 18 occurred. 19 this means that plaintiff must prove that but 20 for mr. cavalier's reasonable reliance on either a 21 statement or an omission made by r.j. reynolds that 22 concealed or omitted material facts not otherwise 23 known or available, mr. cavalier would have acted 24 differently, and he would have acted differently in 25 such a way that he would have avoided coronary artery disease and death. 2 now, mr. cavalier did not die because the 3 dangers and addictiveness of smoking were unknown 4 or unavailable. again, you cannot conceal what is 5 already known. 6 we started this case, we showed you an article 7 from reader's digest, i believe it was 1923, that 8 talked about the dangers of smoking. they had the 9 reader's digest in the home. plaintiff contends 10 that mr. cavalier could not read or write, but other 11 members of the family could, and when you have a 12 member of the family that cannot read and write, 13 oftentimes you read to that person. if there is 14 information that you have encountered that might be 15 helpful to that person, you feel incumbent upon 16 yourself to share it with them, to tell them about 17 it. even though they cannot read and write, you 18 provide it to them. you do that for them. and the 19 information was out there. 20 what we do know is for over 100 years it is 21 been known, and dr. benowitz, their expert, 22 dr. proctor, their expert, both said that it is been 23 known for over 100 years that nicotine is in 24 tobacco. that it is in tobacco. nicotine has a 25 pharmacological effect on the human body. now, what does that mean? pharmacological. 2 the root word is pharmacology, which is the science 3 of the composition, the uses, and the effects of 4 drugs. that is what pharmacology means. so if 5 you have known that for 100 years, you have known about 6 the makeup of nicotine, the composition, you have 7 known about its uses, and you have known about its 8 effects, nicotine affects the body's receptors. 9 that is been known for over 100 years. 10 did not need somebody to come along in the 11 1970s or somebody to come on the witness stand and 12 say that, well, you know, upregulation of the 13 acetylcholine nicotine receptors occurs with the 14 use of nicotine. that is been known that it affects 15 the receptors for over 100 years. that is their 16 experts. it is also been known that it is difficult 17 to quit. that is been known for over 100 years. 18 what we do know is that the first time anybody 19 places a reynolds product in mr. cavalier's hand 20 was in 1961, but we know that back in the '50s, 21 this was the testimony in front of congress. here 22 is leroy barney, who was the surgeon general of the 23 united states, he said in front of congress: "the 24 public health community had done an excellent job 25 at warning the public about the dangers of smoking." 2 what does the national cancer institute, the 3 head of the national cancer institute, what does he 4 say? "the powerful and frightening information 5 coming out about the dangers -- i'm sorry. that is 6 dr. proctor. "the powerful and frightening" -- i 7 got that. let me get back to it. 8 this is dr. proctor, robert proctor. he said: 9 "the powerful and frightening information coming 10 out about the dangers of smoking scared millions of 11 people into quitting." 12 and we showed you those mouse skin-painting 13 studies where they were in life magazine, and they 14 showed the tumors on the backs of the mice. very 15 graphic information about the dangers of smoking. 16 the tar that they painted on the backs of the mice 17 was the same tar that is in cigarette smoke. 18 so do you need to know that polonium is in it, 19 do you need to know that acetone is in, to know 20 that it causes cancer? is not it sufficient to know 21 that the tar in cigarette smoke caused cancer on 22 the backs of those mice? and they used the backs 23 of the mice because the tissue on the backs of the 24 mice is comparable to the tissue in the human lung. 25 it was known and available. here's what dr. proctor also tells us. he 2 told us: "the publicity around those studies in 3 the early 1950s made a significant portion of 4 people fear for their lives and it stimulated 5 quitting in this country." 6 that was the question. 7 "exactly. it is when the first great wave of 8 quitting becomes. it is when you get the first 9 significant self-help manuals to help people quit." 10 "question: all right. it scared millions of 11 people into quitting in the early 1950s, did not 12 it?" 13 "answer: it did." 14 "and then this quitting was driven by people's 15 fears and concerns about the dangers of smoking?" 16 he said: "yes, it was." 17 he talks about the self-help manuals. i 18 did not say that. those are his words. self-help 19 manuals that came out during that time to help 20 people quit, those who were motivated to quit. 21 millions were motivated to quit. that was back in 22 the 1950s when this research first started coming 23 out. 24 mr. cavalier was not one of them. am i 25 faulting mr. cavalier? no, absolutely not, because it was a person's choice whether they wanted to 2 continue in the activity or they wanted to take 3 steps to discontinue it for their health. 4 this question was put to donna fanali about 5 whether her father knew about addiction and that 6 smoking was addictive. 7 question: "also in the 1950s and '60s, based 8 on what you knew about your father, you believe 9 your father understood that smoking was addictive, 10 correct?" 11 "yes, i think he knew smoking was addictive." 12 now, this is before he ever was first seen 13 smoking a reynolds cigarette in 1961. she says 14 going back into the 1950s, using her exact words, 15 "when i was a kid, my father knew smoking was 16 addictive." 17 so do you need the 1988 surgeon general's 18 report to tell you that smoking is addictive if you 19 already know? it cannot be concealed from you if 20 you already know. it cannot be a secret if you 21 already know. the information was known and 22 available. 23 in the early 1960s, jeanne would tell her 24 father, "you are addicted to cigarettes," and his 25 response was he knew he was addicted. we talked about the epidemiology studies that 2 came out in the 1950s showing a strong correlation 3 between smoking and lung cancer. dr. proctor 4 testified about the wynder and graham study. he 5 testified about the mouse skin-painting study. he 6 testified about the surgeon general's report. he 7 testified about the 1966 warning label. all of 8 these were big news stories. these things led to 9 millions of people being scared of smoking and they 10 quit. 11 it was big news. and what do we know about 12 big news? we know that this is the kind of thing 13 that mr. cavalier watched on tv. 14 question: "when he came home early enough to 15 watch the nightly news, he did watch the nightly 16 news?" 17 answer: "yes, if the news was on, he will watch 18 it." 19 question: "all right. when it came to being 20 informed or being aware of current events, your 21 father was certainly aware of the big news events 22 of the day, correct?" 23 "the bigger ones, yes." 24 question: "things that would be considered, 25 quote, 'big news,' right?" the answer: "yes." 2 and of course this was big news. dr. proctor 3 tells us the highest rate of quitting is in that 4 period after the surgeon general's report when 5 nearly 3 million people were quitting every year. 6 that is really the turning point. 7 in the public health history of the united 8 states of america as it relates to cigarette news, 9 that was the turning point, 1964, because you will 10 recall he said at that point there was the three 11 pillars of the consensus, forum, and the scientific 12 community, public health community, told the 13 american public smoking causes lung cancer, smoking 14 causes emphysema. 1964. turning point. 15 can we play this? 16 (videotaped deposition played as follows:) 17 q. now, it was known in 1964 that cigarette 18 smokers engaged in highly compulsive use of cigarettes, 19 right? 20 a. yes. 21 q. it was known in 1964 that cigarette smoking 22 had psychoactive effects, right? 23 a. yes. 24 q. and it was known in 1964 that cigarette 25 smoking led to drug reinforced behavior, correct? a. yes. 2 q. all of those things were known in 1964? 3 a. yes. 4 q. it was not some secret that anybody was keeping 5 under wraps, right? 6 a. correct. 7 q. well-known to the medical and scientific 8 community, correct? 9 a. yes. 10 q. as you told us, you know, within the last 30 11 or 40 minutes, many of these things were known 100 years 12 ago? 13 a. yes. 14 (videotaped deposition was concluded.) 15 mr. persons: known and available. no secret. 16 in fact, the criteria that were just set out in 17 that question that was put to dr. benowitz, it was 18 same criteria that appeared in the 2010 surgeon 19 general's report. what was known and available 20 back in 1964. it was no secret. 21 here's what cheryl lupo said on the stand: "i 22 wish they would have told him years ago that it was 23 bad for him, that it would -- the chemicals." 24 and dr. robert proctor told you that r.j. 25 reynolds disclosed all of the compounds identified in cigarette smoke, including new and previously 2 unknown ones, to the surgeon general's advisory 3 committee in 1964, and the surgeon general's 4 committee published them as carcinogens in smoke in 5 the 1964 surgeon general's report. 6 now, dr. proctor also said, well, they did not 7 point out to the scientists in the surgeon 8 general's office that many of these were 9 carcinogens. well, if you are pointing it out to 10 scientists, they knew, and when they wrote the 11 report, they published them as carcinogens, 12 cancer-causing chemicals. 13 do i need to go through and point out each one 14 of the cancer-causing chemicals if you are a smoker 15 or use shorthand and say, "this will kill you"? 16 what is going to be more useful to you as a 17 consumer, knowing that the product could kill you, 18 or going through and telling you that it contains 19 all these glycerines and all these other compounds? 20 in short, it kills. you saw the psas. it kills. 21 you saw sanford and son. "pop, those things will 22 kill you." 23 1966, dr. proctor said congress required the 24 cigarette makers to make the label. the warning 25 label had to be prominent. it had to be prominent. and of course it was. "caution: cigarette smoking 2 may be hazardous to your health." 3 the plaintiff has stipulated in this case that 4 the warning was adequate, that it was adequate, 5 that it was sufficient. that is what adequacy 6 means. it is sufficient to put the consumer on 7 notice. sufficient to put the smoker on notice of 8 the dangerous nature of this product. it is 9 hazardous to your health. in other words, it is bad 10 for you. it is bad for you. 11 and so she said, "i wish they would have told 12 him years ago that it was bad for you." 13 they did. they told him in the '50s and they 14 told him in 1964 in the surgeon general's report. 15 and, again, for 140,000 times, at least if you are 16 smoking five packs a day, this information was 17 available. now, whether you paid attention to it 18 or not, that is your own business, but it was there. 19 if you do not pay attention to something that is 20 on the product that you are using 100 times a day, 21 what makes you think that he would have paid 22 attention to a memo from r.j. reynolds that said, 23 well, nicotine is addictive? or that there are 24 chemicals in cigarette smoke? no. 25 we know from jeanne dupuis' testimony, she remembers a psa about the warning on the side of 2 the cigarette packs. and this is a psa about the 3 warning on the side of the cigarette packs. 4 would you play that. 5 6 speaker: we receive many warnings in our 7 life, and sometimes they can save our life. this 8 message is brought to you by the american cancer 9 society. 10 (video clip stopped.) 11 mr. persons: the sponsor of the message 12 alone, the name of that organization tells you 13 everything you need to know. if it does not cause 14 cancer, why is the american cancer society telling 15 you that this is a dangerous product? that this is 16 a dangerous activity? but you are an adult, be free 17 to make your own choices but it is a dangerous, 18 dangerous activity. and this kind of information 19 was so widespread, it was so widely known, that the 20 head of the organization, dr. horn, daniel horn, 21 who was with hammond and horn, they did the 22 epidemiological studies in the 1950s. and in the 23 1960s, daniel horn has become head of what was 24 called the national clearinghouse on smoking and 25 health, a federal agency that was charged with getting out the information to the american public 2 about the dangers of cigarette smoking. and he 3 said in 1968 that you could stand on a rooftop and 4 shout "smoking is dangerous" at the top of your 5 lungs, and you would not be telling anyone anything 6 they did not already know. 7 whether they chose to continue in the activity 8 was their own business, but the public knew. the 9 public had been warned. 10 in 1970, again, labels required to be 11 prominent. this was the warning label: warning: 12 the surgeon general has determined that cigarette 13 smoking is dangerous to your health. 14 again, there is no dispute in the case that 15 this was an adequate warning, that it was adequate, 16 it was sufficient to put the smoker on notice that 17 this activity is dangerous to your health. it is 18 not good for you. 19 this warning was available to mr. cavalier at 20 least 500,000 times between 1970 and 1985, when the 21 rotating warnings began. over the 15-year period, 22 that warning would have been available to him 23 500,000 times, and yet he never heeded it. 24 now, there has been a lot of talk about, well, 25 if somebody had told the public about additives, flavorants, in cigarettes, different 2 choices would have been made. 3 now, you heard dr. william farone testify 4 about, in 1972, r.j. reynolds published a book 5 about the ingredients in its cigarettes. it was 6 known in 1972 the tobacco companies were using 7 sugar and licorice and cocoa and chocolate syrup in 8 cigarettes. this book lists hundreds of various 9 flavorants that have been used historically in 10 cigarette products. 11 and in the words of dr. william farone, 12 "comprehensive reference to a number of flavor 13 materials useful for flavoring tobacco and a guide 14 to the current state of the art," and they are all 15 listed here. and it is in evidence. you will have 16 it back there with you. 17 but i submit to you there is page after page 18 after page after page after page after page after 19 page after page, and this is small print. 20 mr. chestnut: you missed one. 21 mr. persons: after page, and it just goes on. 22 these are things that are in the cigarette, and you 23 heard dr. farone said that, yes, it would be 24 available in a public library or medical school 25 library, known and available. known and available. 2 and it goes on and talks about glycerines and 3 things like that, muriatic acid and those kind of 4 things. it is all in there. 5 this is the warning that came out in 1985 and 6 very explicit: smoking causes lung cancer, heart 7 disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy. 8 i will not go through each of them but the 9 warning is adequate. the plaintiff has admitted 10 that. it is adequate. as a matter of law, it is 11 adequate, and at least more than 140,000 times, it 12 was available to mr. cavalier. 13 in short, mr. cavalier did not need any more 14 information to make an informed choice about 15 smoking or quitting. he chose to continue to 16 smoke. 17 the number of witnesses who said mr. cavalier 18 relied on advertisements for his smoking decisions 19 is zero. you heard a lot of talk about 20 advertising. there will be a lot of ads in 21 evidence. but there is no evidence -- there is no 22 testimony or other evidence that it had anything to 23 do with mr. cavalier's smoking decisions. zero. 24 you heard talk about filter fraud. 25 dr. proctor was saying, well, it was a gimmick or an illusion. there are no r.j. reynolds documents 2 using phrases like "gimmick" or "illusion" to 3 describe filtered cigarettes. there are no 4 documents from the '60s, '70s, or the '80s, where 5 reynolds scientists said they believe smokers are 6 getting just as much tar and nicotine as smokers of 7 nonfiltered cigarettes. there are no documents 8 from the '60s, '70s, or the '80s in which reynolds 9 scientists state that filters are ineffective. in 10 fact, what the internal documents show is that the 11 reynolds scientists expressed that they genuinely 12 believed that filtered cigarettes were better for 13 health. that was their firmly held and genuine 14 belief. 15 none of the witnesses, the family, they did 16 not tell you that mr. cavalier relied on any 17 tobacco company or tobacco industry organization in 18 making his decisions about smoking. he never said 19 he heard any statements from any tobacco company or 20 tobacco industry organization. 21 and that stands to reason. remember, the 22 instruction says reasonable reliance. a story came 23 out a couple weeks ago from the world health 24 organization about bacon causing cancer. i did not 25 see anything from oscar mayer coming out and saying anything about it. but i'm not going to look to 2 oscar mayer or the pork producers for health 3 information about eating pork. who looks to the 4 beef council to tell them anything except beef is 5 what is for dinner? they do not tell you that is bad 6 for you. your doctor tells you, but you do not look 7 to the livestock makers to tell you that the 8 product is bad for you. 9 this is a product that does tell you it is bad 10 for it. it is on the pack it tells you it is bad for 11 you. there is nothing on a pack of bacon that says 12 it causes cancer, but you would not look to oscar 13 mayer to tell you that anyway, or budweiser to tell 14 you that the product can make you intoxicated. 15 now, the frank statement, he had not heard of 16 it. no. mr. cavalier did not rely on the ctr 17 statements? no. the tobacco industry research 18 committee statements? no. tobacco institute 19 statements? no, he did not. tobacco industry 20 press releases? no. he said he did not read the 21 paper. tobacco industry white papers? no. 22 tobacco industry interviews or statements. no 23 evidence that he ever relied on any of these 24 things. tobacco company statements about smoking 25 and health? no evidence. tobacco company statements about smoking and addiction? no. 2 and the case has to be decided on evidence. 3 no evidence of any of these things. no evidence of 4 reliance. 5 all right. i submit to you, based on the 6 evidence in this case, the answer to number 3, did 7 thomas cavalier reasonably rely to his detriment on 8 either a statement or omission of material fact 9 made by r.j. reynolds that concealed or omitted 10 material information not otherwise known or 11 available concerning health effects and that such 12 reliance was a legal cause of mr. cavalier's 13 coronary artery disease and death? no. 14 (off the record discussion.) 15 ms. schneider: there you go. 16 mr. persons: thank you, ms. schneider. 17 ms. schneider: got it. 18 mr. persons: get it even. thank you, ma'am. 19 and then the same thing for number 4. 20 and we go to number 5: was there any fault on 21 the part of thomas cavalier that was a cause of his 22 coronary artery disease and death? 23 we know the answer to that. in light of 24 plaintiff's admission yesterday when mr. gary was 25 before you. so we know that there was fault on part of thomas cavalier. so the answer to that is 2 yes. we do not have to spend any time on that. we 3 know the answer to that is yes. they have admitted 4 that. 5 "please state what percentage of any fault for 6 thomas cavalier's coronary artery disease and death 7 that you charge to r.j. reynolds and thomas 8 cavalier." let us talk about that at this time. 9 we talked yesterday, plaintiff conceded 10 mr. cavalier's fault. ms. fanali admits it was her 11 father's own decision to quit. he could have quit 12 sooner and avoided getting a disease. 13 and what does the admission of fault really 14 mean? it means that mr. cavalier chose to begin 15 smoking despite knowing the risks. that he knew 16 that smoking was dangerous and continued to smoke. 17 that he was not confused about the dangers and 18 addictiveness of smoke, because if you are confused 19 about it, then you cannot have any fault for doing 20 it. you are absolved of fault if you are confused. 21 or if are you a victim of misinformation by the 22 tobacco industry, then you have no fault because 23 you are confused. 24 responsible for quitting smoking. we know 25 that. that is what the admission means. and that he was able to quit smoking at any time. he could 2 have quit soon enough to have avoided the adverse 3 health effects of smoking. that is what the 4 admission means. 5 mr. cavalier never blamed the tobacco 6 companies for his decision to smoke and not quit 7 before he did. in all those years, in 8 conversations with his daughters and with friends, 9 at no time did he ever blame the tobacco companies 10 for the decisions that he made, the decision he 11 made to continue smoking. despite all the 12 information he was provided, despite warnings from 13 his own body. 14 "the assignment of fault relates only to 15 actions that were a legal cause of mr. cavalier's 16 coronary artery disease and death." 17 the but for cause that mr. hohnbaum discussed 18 with you all yesterday. 19 "r.j. reynolds cannot be assigned fault for 20 actions that were not a legal cause of 21 mr. cavalier's coronary artery disease and death." 22 it is not a comparison of whose choices were 23 worse, r.j. reynolds employees who chose to write 24 stupid things in memos and those papers that were 25 shown to you. but what did that have to do with causing mr. cavalier's coronary artery disease? it 2 was one hundred percent attributable to diabetes. those 3 documents had absolutely nothing to do with it. 4 reynolds' fault starts at zero percent. 5 plaintiff has the burden to prove by the greater 6 weight of the evidence each and every percentage 7 point of reynolds' fault. every bit of it, they 8 have to prove to you, and i submit to you they have 9 absolutely not. 10 "per the court, you may not assign fault to 11 reynolds for mr. cavalier's lung cancer or his 12 copd." 13 that is not reynolds' fault. you cannot assign 14 any fault to reynolds for the lung cancer or copd 15 that mr. cavalier had. that is out. 16 now, we know that mr. cavalier was responsible 17 for his own smoking, that smokers are responsible 18 for it because even the plaintiff's own expert, dr. 19 neal benowitz, was asked this question: and 20 smoking cigarettes does not cause the smoker to 21 lose the ability to be responsible for their own 22 actions, correct? 23 correct. 24 responsible. 25 mr. cavalier ignored repeated, specific, personalized warnings for decades. we know that, 2 in the '50s and '60s, he knew that cigarettes were 3 addictive. his daughters told us that. 4 starting in the 1960s, mrs. cavalier was 5 always hollering at mr. cavalier to quit. that 6 came from joseph possidento. he is the man with lou 7 gehrig's disease out in arizona, cousin to 8 mr. cavalier. he said that he could remember back 9 in connecticut, growing up in connecticut, that 10 mrs. cavalier was always hollering at mr. cavalier 11 to quit. 12 and in the early 1960s, jeanne was always 13 complaining that she hated her father's smoking and 14 telling him he was addicted. and he would respond, 15 "yes, i'm addicted." 16 jeanne told her father, "you got to stop 17 smoking," and it is difficult enough being a 18 teenager, but it is especially difficult being a 19 teenage girl. not that i've been one but i raised 20 one. and imagine going to school with smoke on 21 your clothes and being teased by other students 22 about smoke being on your clothes. do you think 23 your father might pick up the phone and call the 24 smoking cessation clinic? you think he might throw 25 out his ashtrays? you think he might refrain from smoking in the house and just go outside to smoke? 2 this is somebody who obviously enjoyed 3 indulging in this activity. no matter how 4 offensive it was to other members of his family, no 5 matter how much it yellowed the walls in his house 6 and soiled the furniture and carpets in his house, 7 and caused his children's clothes to smell of 8 smoke. 9 mr. cavalier developed a cough, he connected 10 it to smoking. the family constantly warned him, 11 from 1974 on, to quit because it was harming his 12 health. now, this is very interesting because 13 joseph possidento is in the throes of lou gehrig's 14 disease, but he remembered to the year when it was 15 that mr. cavalier developed his cough. that is over 16 40 years ago, but he remembered it distinctly. he 17 did not say in the mid '70s, early '70s. he said 18 1974. and he also said that he was coughing to the 19 point he was choking. that is a warning from your 20 own body. 21 so you have got a warning from the surgeon 22 general, you have got a warning from the public 23 health community, you have got a warning from your 24 own body. but the plaintiffs want you to believe 25 that, if he got something from r.j. reynolds, that that might change his behavior. the daughter is 2 complaining about smoke in clothes; the wife is 3 hollering at you about quitting smoking; you are 4 coughing to the point that you are choking. but no, 5 if they told him that cigarettes contained 6 polonium, yeah, that will do the trick. that will 7 get him to stop smoking. that will get him to put 8 the cigarettes down. 9 it defies logic. it defies all logic. jeanne 10 told her father, you have got to stop smoking. 11 once he developed this bad cough, possidento 12 told us that the family got on him even more about 13 the need to quit. and the question was asked of 14 possidento, did he associate the cough -- this 15 severe cough with smoking? and the answer was yes. 16 so he knew. he got plenty of warning. he knew. 17 that is the most personal warning you can get, is 18 one from your own body. 19 and then he starts treating for copd. under a 20 doctor's care, a pulmonologist's care for copd. 21 obviously the state of -- standard of care at that 22 time, according to dr. cowen, is that you would 23 tell the patient that, you have got to stop smoking. 24 it is going to make the copd even worse, the more 25 you smoke. a personal warning. 2 mr. cavalier's family and friends developed 3 smoking-related diseases and they died from them. 4 we know that his brother developed bladder cancer 5 that was caused by smoking. we know that mrs. mary 6 yvancek, very close friends, another couple, of the 7 cavalier's, mary yvancek was a smoker, developed 8 lung cancer, was battling lung cancer. and 9 mr. cavalier was aware of this, but he did not quit. 10 the number of witnesses who told you 11 mr. cavalier made any attempts to quit in response 12 to all of these warnings? zero. 13 here's the testimony of donna fanali about 14 mrs. mary yvancek. 15 "question: do you recall your father ever 16 making an effort to quit -- to stop smoking because 17 mary had died of lung cancer from smoking? 18 "answer: no, i do not think so." 19 "did i read that correctly?" 20 "answer: it said, no, i do not think so 21 because of the fact that she had lung cancer. i 22 do not think that he -- it resonated with him. oh, 23 my god, i've got to stop smoking. that is what i 24 mean." 25 well, if this did not resonate with him, what would have? a close personal friend dying of lung 2 cancer from smoking. and you do not even have a 3 conversation about -- about quitting. 4 no, i do not think it resonated with him. the 5 warning labels did not resonate with him, warnings 6 from family members did not resonate with him. 7 developing a horrible cough did not resonate with 8 him. death of a close friend from lung cancer from 9 smoking did not resonate with him. i do not know 10 what would. 11 mr. cavalier's choices are the only legal 12 cause of his coronary artery disease. ms. fanali 13 admitted that no additional information would have 14 mattered. only mr. cavalier had the ability to 15 decide to quit smoking and prevent his death. 16 mr. cavalier received adequate warnings on every 17 pack that he smoked. 18 he is one hundred percent responsible for the choices 19 he made. 20 mr. cavalier's knowledge about the dangers of 21 smoking, plus mr. cavalier's power over his 22 smoking, he was the only one that had power over 23 his own smoking. nobody could force him to stop. 24 and mr. cavalier's responsibility to choose health 25 over smoking, one hundred percent. the next question on the verdict form: "what 2 is the total amount of damages sustained by ann 3 cavalier for the loss of her husband's 4 companionship and protection and her pain and 5 suffering as a result of the thomas cavalier's 6 death? 7 any damages must be fair and just in light of 8 the evidence. and i'm not talking about damages 9 because we are of the position that damages should 10 be awarded to the contrary. 11 i submit to you that no damages should be 12 awarded at all. but it is incumbent upon me to 13 discuss all the questions on the verdict form, and 14 that is why i'm discussing this one. 15 plaintiff is not entitled to recover 16 compensatory damages in the amount -- in excess of 17 the amount which represents the loss actually 18 inflicted by the action of the defendants. 19 the purpose of compensatory damage is to 20 compensate, not to punish the defendants. 21 plaintiff is seeking damages for 22 mrs. cavalier's pain and suffering. now yesterday 23 you heard the figure tossed out of $10 million. 24 and that that might -- well, that defies common 25 sense. plaintiff's claim does not include economic 2 damages. those are damages for lost wages, lost 3 financial support. 4 and this claim does not include anything like 5 medical expenses or funeral expenses. there can be 6 no recovery for mr. cavalier's pain and suffering 7 or donna fanali's pain and suffering or jeanne 8 dupuis's pain and suffering or cheryl lupo's pain 9 and suffering. none of those things are involved 10 in this case, just mrs. cavalier's pain and 11 suffering. 12 again, the damages start at zero. and the 13 plaintiff has to prove to you by the greater weight 14 of the evidence each and every dollar of damages. 15 one of the things that you will have with you, 16 that you have now, is instruction no. 18, and it 17 talks about the credibility of witnesses. and i 18 want to discuss that briefly with you. 19 in evaluating the believability of any 20 witness, and the weight you will give the testimony 21 of any witness, you may properly consider the 22 demeanor of the witness while testifying, the 23 frankness, or lack of frankness, of the witness, 24 and that is what i want to talk about. the 25 frankness or lack of frankness of the witness. and i want to ask you, why were not the 2 plaintiff's witnesses frank with you? 3 cheryl lupo had to be impeached four times. 4 on four occasions, ms. schneider had to show her a 5 deposition and said, "well, you testified 6 differently in here in front of the jury than you 7 did in your deposition where you took the same oath 8 to tell the truth and nothing but the truth so help 9 you god." but you said something different here. 10 well, the truth does not change. you do not have to 11 try to remember it because it does not change. but 12 my grandmother used to say "the truth do not 13 change." that is what she would say. 14 now, jeanne dupuis had to be impeached six 15 times. again, confronted with the deposition. and 16 mr. gary was showing you all those pages of the 17 deposition that they -- the testimony, but 18 impeached because not consistent. 19 donna fanali had to be impeached 10 times, 20 including an impeachment about "well, your father 21 did not lie to the doctors about his quitting 22 smoking, knowing that he did quit." well, both of 23 those things cannot be true. you can take those 24 into account when you are evaluating what these 25 people said, what they told you. and donna fanali filed the lawsuit, 2 mrs. cavalier has been affected by dementia and 3 alzheimer's since 2006. the lawsuit was filed in 4 2008. before trial, jeanne agreed. donna took it 5 upon herself, upon her own initiative to make the 6 claim. 7 before trial, jeanne did not know whether 8 donna had discussed the lawsuit with their mother 9 when the lawsuit was filed. donna filed the 10 lawsuit after seeing an ad for the gary firm on tv. 11 now, plaintiff wants at least $10 million in 12 damages and it defies common sense. they want 13 millions of dollars for concealing information from 14 mr. cavalier when the plaintiff and her family 15 admit that they did not pay much attention to the 16 warnings that cigarettes could kill you, but they 17 want to recover millions of dollars without even 18 paying attention to the warnings. 19 they say no additional information would have 20 mattered to mr. cavalier in his smoking decisions, 21 but yet they want to recover millions of dollars 22 from r.j. reynolds for not telling him more 23 information. 24 they want millions of dollars when no one 25 knows why mr. cavalier started smoking, there is no evidence about it. millions of dollars when no one 2 knows what brands mr. cavalier smoked before 1961, 3 when he was 38 years old. they showed you all the 4 stuff about youth smoking, a photograph at the 5 teamsters union party with the children with 6 viceroy candy cigarettes, as if that had anything 7 to do with this case, all the stuff about youth 8 smoking and targeting youth. 9 the man is 38 years old before anybody places 10 an r.j. reynolds product in his hand, but they want 11 millions of dollars from reynolds. 12 millions of dollars when mr. cavalier 13 continued to smoke throughout the '50s, '60s, '70s 14 and '80s at the same time millions and millions and 15 millions of other smokers were quitting. 16 millions of dollars when no evidence 17 mr. cavalier relied on any advertisement or any 18 tobacco organization. it defies common sense. 19 millions of dollars when mr. cavalier's family 20 believed that he died of lung cancer until they 21 walked into court for the trial. 22 now, they had a deposition. these depositions 23 were not taken years ago, they were taken last 24 summer. they were taken in july and august of this 25 year. and to a person they were saying well, that -- that their father died of lung cancer. but 2 when they got to the courthouse, all of a sudden it 3 was coronary artery disease that killed him. oh, 4 it is congestive heart failure that killed him. 5 well, what happened between july and now? you 6 said one thing in your deposition, all 700 and some 7 pages of it, talking about, well, lung cancer. and 8 then you come in here and all of a sudden it is 9 constructive -- i mean, that it is congestive heart 10 disease -- coronary artery disease. 11 well, the truth does not change. 12 they want millions of dollars when the 13 plaintiff admits the pack warnings on the 14 cigarettes adequately warned smokers, including 15 mr. cavalier, that it was adequate. it is 16 sufficiently warned you about the dangers of 17 smoking, the adverse health effects of smoking. 18 and the peanut gallery is reminding me that 19 i've got a board here with the warnings on it. 20 plaintiff admits the warnings were adequate as 21 a matter of law. and plaintiff does not dispute 22 their adequacy, that they were sufficient. 23 they put the smoker on notice, give the smoker 24 the sufficient information that this was enough, 25 that you did not have to put all of the chemicals and everything. the pack is so small, you cannot 2 put all that on there anyway. but the shorthand is 3 it will kill you. the shorthand is it causes lung 4 cancer, and heart disease, emphysema, may 5 complicate pregnancy. the shorthand quitting 6 smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your 7 health. in shorthand, it contains carbon monoxide. 8 that is poison. everybody knows that. 9 you leave the engine running in your car and 10 you are in a garage or an enclosed space, it will 11 kill you. 12 what would you rather know, that it can kill 13 you or that it is -- you want the formulas with all 14 the chemicals in it? it makes no sense at all. 15 but the warning is adequate. that is the point. 16 the warning is adequate. 17 millions of dollars is what they want, when 18 plaintiffs admit that any additional information 19 would not have mattered to mr. cavalier. they are 20 asking for millions of dollars when plaintiff 21 admitted mr. cavalier loved cigarettes. he loved 22 smoking. he did what he loved doing, to the tune 23 of five packs a day. and no, we are not faulting 24 him. nobody is in here disparaging him or casting 25 aspersions on him or engaging in an activity that he loved. 2 what we do take issue with is someone coming 3 in and wanting compensation because the man 4 indulged in an activity that he loved doing. 5 "please state whether you find by clear and 6 convincing evidence that punitive damages are 7 warranted." no. 8 the judge will instruct you that if you find 9 punitive damages are warranted, you will return for 10 a second phase of trial which we will anticipate -- 11 we anticipate will take a day or two. i submit to 12 you, you answer "no," and it is over. 13 the burden of proof on the other issues in the 14 case, it is been by the greater weight of the 15 evidence. you heard us talking about greater 16 weight of the evidence. 17 well, in order to get punitive damages, 18 entitlement to punitive damages, the plaintiff has 19 to prove to you by clear and convincing evidence, 20 and that is a different standard, it is a much higher 21 standard, it is not beyond a reasonable doubt, but 22 it is much higher than greater weight of the 23 evidence -- much higher than greater weight of the 24 evidence. the law will provide us some direction 25 on that. now punitive damages can be awarded only for 2 concealment and agreement to conceal information 3 that was a legal cause of mr. cavalier's death. 4 information that but for the concealment of that 5 information, the omission of that information, 6 mr. cavalier would have quit smoking and not 7 died -- not died of a smoking-related disease. 8 you may not punish reynolds for any harm 9 suffered by anyone other than mr. cavalier. and 10 you heard time and again about all the people who 11 are dying across the country from smoking-related 12 illnesses. no, it does not have anything to do with 13 mr. cavalier. this case is about mr. cavalier. 14 any punitive damages awarded are in addition 15 to damages that fully compensate mrs. cavalier. 16 and punitive damages can be awarded only -- can be 17 awarded to mrs. cavalier only. they cannot be 18 awarded to the american cancer association, or the 19 american lung association or anything of that sort. 20 whatever punitive damages are awarded, and i submit 21 to you that they should not be, can only be awarded 22 to ann cavalier. 23 here is instruction no. 15: for purposes of 24 determining whether punitive damages are warranted, 25 you may not -- you may not consider in any way engle findings. you cannot consider them. not at 2 all. no. the law is you cannot consider them. 3 the engle findings do not establish that 4 ms. fanali is entitled to recover punitive damages 5 on behalf of her mother. 6 in determining whether punitive damages are 7 warranted, you may also take into consideration any 8 mitigating evidence. and mitigating evidence is 9 evidence which may demonstrate there is no need to 10 impugn -- impose punitive damages against reynolds. 11 and i submit to you there is no need to impose 12 punitive damages against reynolds. and i will tell 13 you why. 14 dr. proctor testified that over the years, 15 that reynolds has engaged in a number of efforts to 16 make a less hazardous cigarette. there is no such 17 thing as a safe cigarette. 18 question: now, the historical record 19 demonstrates that the tobacco companies tried to 20 make a cigarette that was less hazardous, 21 understanding there is no such thing as a safe 22 cigarette, they tried to make a cigarette that was 23 less hazardous. 24 answer: many cigarettes, they used catalysts 25 in the '50s. they used special breeding techniques in the '60s. they used genetic engineering. they 2 used nicotine-free cigarettes. they developed 3 premier and eclipse at reynolds to develop a 4 cigarette that would heat, not burn tobacco. there 5 were many. if you listed all the genuine efforts, 6 there would be many dozens. 7 dozens of efforts to try to make the product 8 less hazardous, recognizing that it is deadly, that 9 there is no way to make it completely safe. 10 from the '50s to the '90s, reynolds made 11 efforts to remove known carcinogens from smoke. 12 dr. proctor testified to this. they started 13 developing heat, not burn technology. spent a 14 billion dollars back in the '80s trying to develop 15 a less harmful cigarette. and it failed because 16 people would not buy it due to the taste. you cannot 17 make consumers buy things they do not want to buy. 18 take the nicotine out. that is what you heard 19 dr. proctor say. well, if they took the nicotine 20 out then it would be -- it would be safer because 21 people would smoke less of it or they would not 22 smoke it and then people would not use it. 23 well, r.j. reynolds and philip morris 24 manufactured denicotinized cigarettes. it sold 25 poorly, or they sold poorly, and they were rejected by consumers. 2 and dr. farone told you that they were 3 severely criticized by the antismoking community as 4 the most dangerous product to be put on the market 5 in the last 10 years. 6 the public health community petitioned the 7 federal government to force philip morris to stop 8 advertising and selling denicotinized cigarettes. 9 mitigating evidence. r.j. reynolds funded 10 $350 million in research and dr. proctor says it 11 would be several times that amount if you adjust it 12 for inflation. 13 the council for tobacco research funded 14 projects that resulted in more than 7,000 15 peer-reviewed articles. the surgeon general has 16 cited ctr-funded studies, studies funded by the 17 tobacco companies, more than 600 times. 18 ctr funded research at top universities, 19 including university of florida, university of 20 miami, florida state, and so on, and funded at 21 least ten nobel prize winners. 22 mitigating evidence, the relationship between 23 smoking and copd. that was some of the research 24 that was done, established this relationship 25 between cigarette smoking and copd. some of research established the effects of cigarette 2 smoking on the impairment of lung function among 3 heavy smokers. the effects of inhalation of 4 cigarette smoke on the risk of lung injury and 5 declining lung function. articles on addiction and 6 withdraw. all of this funded by the tobacco 7 industry, and there is no evidence that the funding 8 was cut off. 9 now, dr. proctor sat there on direct 10 examination in the course of a day a better part of 11 a second day and said, oh, yeah, when they did 12 things that were critical of tobacco, that showed a 13 link between smoking and adverse health effects, 14 the funding got cut off. 15 well, on cross-examination, he was asked about 16 each of those. have you seen anything where that 17 indicates that dr. janoff's financing was cut off? 18 no. 19 have you seen anything to indicate 20 dr. lombard's funding was cut off by anything. no. 21 you have looked at all these documents -- 22 millions of pages of documents, he said. 23 have you seen anything that dr. knapp's 24 founding was cut off because he published an 25 article that said that smoking was addictive back in 1963? no. 2 dr. hanes? no. 3 dr. bosse? no. 4 have you seen anything about any scientist's 5 funding being cut off because they published 6 something that was adverse to the tobacco industry? 7 absolutely not. 8 dr. farone testified about the tobacco working 9 group, and he told you that it was a collaboration 10 between the federal government, the public health 11 community, and the tobacco industry. now, the 12 tobacco working group, that is people from the 13 american heart association and the american cancer 14 society, the federal government, and people from 15 the tobacco industry. 16 they never recommended that tobacco industry 17 remove any additives or flavors or ammonia or 18 humectants -- and humectants include glycerol. 19 that keeps the tobacco moist, the same thing in 20 opening statements, you were told that, well, 21 glycerine, that is the same thing that is in 22 antifreeze. 23 but it is not antifreeze that is in the tobacco. 24 it is just a chemical component that is similar to 25 one found in antifreeze. the tobacco working group recommended that 2 companies manipulate nicotine and tar levels in 3 cigarettes. and dr. farone said, yeah, well, you 4 can. manipulate. it has a negative connotation. 5 manipulate. but what they did was they adjusted 6 the amount of nicotine in the cigarette in an 7 effort to lower the amount of -- while lowering the 8 amount of tar, recognizing that the tar is what 9 causes disease, not the nicotine, so that someone 10 smoking the cigarette would get a certain level of 11 nicotine and at the same time get less tar. and so 12 that is what this group, government officials, 13 public health officials, people from the tobacco 14 companies, recommended that the companies 15 manipulate tar and nicotine levels in cigarettes in 16 an effort to make them less hazardous. 17 more mitigating evidence, evidence of why 18 reynolds should not be punished. since 1986, 19 reynolds has disclosed to congress the ingredients 20 and additives in its cigarettes, and since 2009, 21 reynolds has disclosed to the food and drug 22 administration its formulas for all cigarette 23 products and disclosed to the fda all research done 24 on the ingredients and the additives. 25 well, the bottom line is that the tobacco industry is becoming obsolete. dr. proctor told 2 you that. smoking is denormalized and marginalized 3 in today's society, and ever since the surgeon 4 general's report came out in 1964, this society has 5 been marching toward that end. smoking rates are 6 at their lowest level since the 1920s. the 7 cigarette is a horse and buggy technology, 8 according to dr. proctor. we are in a period of 9 collapse of smoking. smoking is on its way out. 10 it is no longer socially acceptable. it is 11 stigmatized to smoke. 12 and among youth, youth smoking has dropped 66 13 percent since 1966, and in all the 50 states, of 14 all the 50 states in the united states of america, 15 there is only one state that has lower rates of 16 youth smoking than florida, and that is utah, which 17 is heavily mormon and the mormons said no drinking, 18 no smoking, do not even use caffeine. it is against 19 their religion. only that state has a higher -- 20 has a lower rate of youth smoking than florida. 21 cigarettes are stigmatized. teenagers today 22 are more likely to smoke marijuana or drink alcohol 23 than smoke cigarettes. smoking is on its way out. 24 you heard all this stuff about youth marketing and 25 our selling to youngsters, references to our children. well, our children are not smoking. 2 they are doing some other things, but they are not 3 smoking. and then if you want to take up an 4 activity, it does not have to be advertised. 5 there is no advertising for marijuana. you do not 6 see any ads for marijuana, but people are using it. 7 that is because it is becoming more socially 8 acceptable. the social forces in the country are 9 leaning in that direction, with states legalizing 10 marijuana for medicinal and recreational use. 11 the evidence demonstrates there is no need to 12 impose punitive damages. 13 in deciding whether punitive damages are 14 warranted, you may not seek to punish r.j. reynolds 15 for any harm suffered by any individuals other than 16 thomas cavalier. 17 mr. acosta: your honor, i object to that. 18 that is a misstatement of the law. 19 the court: he is just reading from the final 20 jury instructions. 21 mr. persons: i'm reading the instructions, 22 and it is instruction 15. nor may you punish 23 r.j. reynolds for conduct that did not produce 24 harms within the state of florida. 25 the clerk: ten minutes, counsel. mr. persons: thank you. 2 i thought i had turned it off. i apologize. 3 okay. we talked about damages, and you 4 should not even get there. punitive damages 5 warranted? no. 6 there goes the clicker. i'm almost done. i 7 know we need a break. you are going to get one, i'm 8 sure. 9 summing up, mr. cavalier did not die from 10 coronary artery disease caused by smoking. he died 11 from copd. the coronary artery disease that he did 12 have was caused by diabetes, one hundred percent. 13 no evidence that mr. cavalier smoked r.j. 14 reynolds cigarettes before 1961 when he was 38 15 years old. in fact, there is no physical evidence 16 of r.j. reynolds' product being smoked by 17 mr. cavalier. all of the photographs that have 18 cigarette packs in them have parliament cigarettes 19 in front of mr. cavalier. that is a philip morris 20 product, not an r.j. reynolds product. 21 we have donna said that he smoked kools, but 22 we do not have anything that we can look at to 23 verify or confirm that. donna also said on the 24 stand that, well, he bought more kools, he bought 25 them by the carton, while he bought parliament by the pack; yet in all the photographs there is 2 parliament and not kool. some of the photographs 3 go back before the children were born. parliament, 4 not kools. 5 mr. cavalier continued to smoke for decades 6 despite repeated specific warnings about the 7 dangers, starting before he ever smoked an r.j. 8 reynolds cigarette. mr. cavalier always had the 9 ability to quit but continued to smoke -- continued 10 to smoke until he was motivated to quit, and then 11 he quit in 1989. 12 mr. cavalier's smoking decisions were not 13 influenced by anything r.j. reynolds said or 14 anything r.j. reynolds did. 15 and here is dr. cuyler hammond, and this was a 16 broadcast about the research. you see, when they 17 did this research, it was big news, and so you 18 did not have to read, you could sit in front of your 19 television or in front of your radio and get this 20 information that is coming out about the dangers, 21 the health risks of smoking. 22 here's dr. cuyler hammond talking about the 23 research he and daniel horn did, the 24 epidemiological studies, that demonstrated, 25 according to dr. cuyler hammond, beyond a reasonable doubt the link between smoking and lung 2 cancer. 3 would you play it, mr. smith? 4 5 dr. hammond: it is now subject to my opinion 6 beyond a reasonable doubt that cigarette smoking 7 greatly increases the probability of developing 8 lung cancer. in my opinion, people should be 9 warned of the dangers, and they are being warned. 10 what they then want to do, whether they want to 11 smoke or not, is their own business. 12 (video clip stopped.) 13 mr. persons: and then when the surgeon 14 general's report came out, the news covered that. 15 16 harry reasoner: in this kind of a country, it 17 comes down to you, whether you like it or not. no 18 one is going to forbid an adult to smoke, and it is 19 now quite clear that no one is going to tell him 20 that it is good for him either. the decision is 21 his, the decision and the health that may depend on 22 it. this is harry reasoner. good night. 23 (video clip stopped.) 24 mr. persons: and that is consistent with what 25 donna fanali told us. whether or not he was going to quit was his own decision, and when he made that 2 decision, when he made up his mind he was going to 3 quit, that is when he quit. 4 i submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, the 5 evidence is overwhelming that it was mr. cavalier's 6 fault for his smoking, and not that of anyone else. 7 only he had control of it, and no one else should 8 be blamed for it. and if you apply the law to the 9 facts, the evidence, based on the evidence that 10 you have heard in the courtroom, the evidence points 11 in only one direction, and that is a verdict in 12 favor of r.j. reynolds tobacco company. 13 i thank you for your kind attention.
