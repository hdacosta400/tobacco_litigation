10 mr. geraghty: thank you, your honor. 11 good morning, ladies and gentlemen. as you 12 know, my name is bill geraghty, and along with 13 terry sexton, we represent philip morris usa in 14 this case. i think i can agree with mr. hammer, 15 it has been a long trial, and at times i'm sure 16 it was probably tedious and the examinations, 17 i'm sure, took longer than you all would have 18 liked for them to take, but we are toward 19 the end of the process. 20 what i'd really like to start with is to 21 thank you for your time. this has been an 22 incredible sacrifice of your time to be here and 23 everybody appreciates the fact that you have taken 24 that time to help us to resolve the issues in 25 this case. we would not be able to have civil jury trials if we did not have people like you 2 who are willing to make a sacrifice of your time 3 to be here and help us resolve this case. let 4 me simply say i think on behalf of everyone, 5 judge cox, the lawyers and the parties, that we 6 really appreciate it. we know you have been 7 paying attention. so thank you very much. 8 we are getting very close to the end of the 9 case, which i'm sure is music to all of your 10 ears at this point. it is almost time for you 11 to head off to the jury room and deliberate. 12 judge cox told you that she will give you 13 an actual verdict form and a set of instructions 14 and you will use that to decide the issues in this 15 case. but before you head off to deliberate, 16 i'd like to take this opportunity to summarize 17 the evidence that we have heard over the last two 18 weeks. 19 now before i do that, let me say something 20 about the findings from the earlier class 21 action. you heard about those findings. i am 22 not here to debate those findings. but there is 23 also no debate, ladies and gentlemen, those 24 findings do not tell you how to answer any of 25 the questions on the verdict form. that is because, by your verdict in this 2 case, by your review of the evidence you have 3 heard and your verdict in this case, you decide 4 whether those findings have any applicability to 5 fannie collar and the lifestyle choices that she 6 made. 7 mr. hammer: objection. that is a 8 misstatement of the law. can we approach? 9 the court: yes. 10 (thereupon, the bench conference proceeded 11 as follows.) 12 mr. hammer: judge, once the jury 13 determines she is a class member, those findings 14 absolutely do apply to fannie collar. that is a 15 misstatement of the law. 16 the court: i thought it said -- 17 mr. hammer: it is a misstatement of the 18 law. i'd ask for a curative instruction. 19 the court: if so, sustained. 20 mr. hammer: i'd ask for a curative. 21 mr. geraghty: your honor, you told them in 22 your instructions that they cannot use the 23 findings to decide whether she is a class member 24 or not. 25 the court: right. that is true. geraghty: right. so they get to 2 decide by answering that question whether the 3 findings apply to her. 4 the court: then you need to say that 5 instead of what you just said, that the 6 findings, based on her lifestyle. 7 mr. geraghty: i do not want to get 8 interrupted every two minutes. all he has to do 9 is object. i came up once during his. 10 mr. hammer: it is a misstatement of the 11 law. 12 mr. geraghty: it is not a misstatement of 13 the law. 14 the court: you object, and i'll overrule. 15 you do not need to run up here. 16 mr. hammer: if it is a misstatement of the 17 law, i'm asking for a curative instruction. 18 what mr. geraghty said is that the findings have 19 no applicability to fannie collar. 20 mr. geraghty: that is not what i said. 21 mr. hammer: that is untrue. 22 mr. geraghty: that is not what i said. 23 the court: that is not what he said. 24 mr. geraghty: i said, you decide by your 25 verdict whether those findings have any applicability. if they decide she is not a 2 member of the class -- 3 mr. hammer: look at the transcript. 4 that is not what he said. 5 the court: i'll sustain the objection and 6 instruct the jury. 7 8 the court: ladies and gentlemen, as i told 9 you earlier in the trial, the attorneys do not 10 give testimony. the testimony in evidence comes 11 only from the witness stand and the evidence. 12 the attorneys' arguments are intended to aid you 13 in understanding the evidence and testimony. 14 you may proceed with your argument. 15 mr. geraghty: thank you. after all, 16 ladies and gentlemen, this case is about fannie 17 collar. when i spoke to you during my opening 18 statement, which was about two weeks ago, i told 19 you that the plaintiff would spend a lot of her 20 time talking to you about statements and ideas 21 made by philip morris, r.j. reynolds and 22 liggett, many of which were made, 30, 40 and in 23 some instances more than 50 years ago. 24 we told you we would not try to defend all 25 those statements. philip morris, r.j. reynolds and liggett made statements and had ideas that 2 today no one would say or think. 3 but i also told you that if that was all 4 this case were about, if all the plaintiff had 5 to prove was that cigarette company executives 6 said inappropriate things, we would not be here. 7 we would not have spent the last two weeks 8 together in this courtroom, but we did, ladies 9 and gentlemen. we did that because this case 10 is not about all cigarette smokers. it is not 11 about whether we think people should or should 12 not smoke cigarettes. 13 this case is about fannie collar. it is 14 about her life and her decisions. that is why, 15 when you actually get the verdict form, you will 16 see that every question on that verdict form 17 asks you specifically about fannie collar, not 18 all cigarette smokers and not the general 19 public. 20 so what have you heard in this case over 21 the last two weeks that is undisputed? well, 22 you have heard that fannie collar is well 23 educated, intelligent, strong-willed and 24 independent. she chose to live her life the way 25 she wanted. her attitude about smoking was no different. 2 as far back as 1955, when fannie collar was 3 21 years old and working at the adjutant 4 general's office, her attitude was, it is not 5 going to happen to me. i'm going to live until 6 i'm in my 80s. i'm not going to slow down until 7 i'm in my 80s. 8 this is what fannie collar told her 9 co-worker back in 1955 when that co-worker told 10 her, you know what, you should quit smoking. my 11 wife, she smoked cigarettes and she died of 12 cancer. this is what fannie collar told that 13 co-worker back in 1955 at the age of 21. 14 now, we are going to walk through all of the 15 cigarette events in ms. collar's life because 16 this case is about her. i will show you that 17 everything we told you, everything we told you 18 about ms. collar at the very beginning of the 19 case, has turned out to be true. 20 i talked to you at the very beginning of 21 the case about the sources of evidence, the 22 sources of evidence. i asked you to pay close 23 attention to those sources of evidence. so what 24 did i mean by that? what i meant was that 25 everything you saw during the course of this trial came from either what ms. collar herself 2 told us in her deposition, what she told her 3 doctors in her medical records, many of which 4 were written long before the lawsuit was filed, 5 what her doctors told us, and what her family 6 members said, who also gave depositions under 7 oath in this case. 8 as i told you in my opening statement two 9 weeks ago, many of the things that ms. collar 10 told us during the course of this trial have 11 been contradicted by what she told her own 12 doctors and her medical records many years 13 before she filed the lawsuit, by what she said 14 in her own deposition in this case under oath 15 and by what her own family members told us in 16 their depositions. 17 i told you that you would get to be the 18 judge of the facts. you would get to be the 19 judges of the facts in this case. you would get 20 to decide what testimony you ultimately chose to 21 believe. judge cox gave you this instruction. 22 she read it to you, but you will get a written 23 copy of the instruction when you retire to 24 deliberate. judge cox has already told you that 25 in evaluating the believability of any witness you may properly consider any interest the 2 witness may have in the outcome of the case. by 3 "interest," we mean a financial interest in the 4 outcome of the case. 5 you may consider the reasonableness of the 6 testimony of the witness considered in the light 7 of all of the evidence in the case and in light 8 of your own experience and common sense. 9 you can accept or reject any testimony 10 you are hearing in this case in whole or in part. 11 ladies and gentlemen, that is your job and your 12 job alone as the jury. 13 let me tell you the best example of when 14 ms. collar told you one thing here in court, but 15 said something completely different when she 16 was not thinking about this lawsuit. you will 17 probably recall that ms. collar told you about 18 an episode in which she claimed that she nearly 19 drowned in her pool. she said it was scary and 20 she has not been swimming ever since. 21 on thursday, when i asked ms. collar about 22 it, she confirmed that this episode happened 23 sometime before her deposition, which was on 24 april 15th of 2014. let me remind you of the 25 testimony that ms. collar gave. this was last thursday. i was asking the questions. 2 does that refresh your recollection that 3 the first time you told us about this episode 4 where you nearly drowned in the pool was on 5 april 15th of 2014? 6 her answer was: yes, but that was not the 7 day that the episode happened. 8 and then i said to her: i understand that. 9 the episode occurred before you told us about it 10 on april 15th of 2014, right? 11 she said: right. 12 that is what she said. 13 two months after ms. collar told us about 14 this on april 15th, her medical records showed 15 that she was swimming in her pool again. 16 so i asked ms. collar right after this, i 17 asked her these questions. 18 minutes later, is not it true that 19 approximately two months after you told us about 20 this episode where you nearly drowned, that you 21 were actually swimming in your pool? 22 answer: no. 23 is not that true? 24 her answer: no. 25 no, that is not true? her answer: no, that is not true. i 2 have not been in the pool. 3 that is the testimony that ms. collar gave 4 under oath from that witness box less than a 5 week ago. that is what she told you. 6 now, here is the medical record, ladies and 7 gentlemen. i tried to show it to you during 8 ms. collar's examination. 9 mr. hammer: objection, judge. 10 the court: sustained. 11 mr. geraghty: you actually saw this 12 medical record the day before ms. collar 13 testified. i put it up on the screen and i 14 showed it to dr. mannino the day before. again, 15 this medical record, i'm going to show it to you 16 in a second, it is dated june 30th of 2014, two 17 and a half months after that date. 18 can i have the elmo, please? 19 so you can see real quick. 20 it says barry gordon. he was a 21 chiropractor that was treating ms. collar for 22 neck and back pain. it is got her name at the 23 top. she came in about a week earlier, on 24 june 23rd, complaining of neck and back pain. 25 let us look at what ms. collar told dr. gordon on june 30th of 2014. it says, 2 patient reports that she is better. she states 3 that she was able to swim over this past 4 weekend, where she had not been able to swim 5 before. 6 that is what ms. collar told her doctor. 7 that is what she told her doctor when she was not 8 thinking about the lawsuit. 9 it contradicted what she told you from this 10 witness stand when she swore to tell the truth. 11 the testimony you heard less than one week ago. 12 when i handed the record to ms. collar, she 13 said, where did you get this? 14 mr. hammer: objection, judge. 15 the court: overruled. 16 mr. geraghty: so what else did ms. collar 17 tell you? 18 well, she said in 1966 she heard a 19 statement from the tobacco industry that if you 20 were concerned about your health, you should 21 smoke filtered cigarettes because they were 22 safe, absolutely safe. that is what she told 23 you. 24 but you already know that by this time 25 ms. collar had been smoking filtered cigarettes, filtered marlboro cigarette for nearly 10 years, 2 going back to 1955, when she met and married her 3 now ex-husband, merton collar. 4 what did she tell you about this statement 5 that she claims she heard? she said it did not 6 make any impression on me because i had already 7 been smoking filtered cigarettes for 10 or 11 8 years. 9 i'll show you the testimony. this is 10 ms. collar's testimony. this was thursday 11 afternoon as well. 12 is not it true that the statement that you 13 have now told us about several times, is not it 14 true that that statement did not make any 15 impression on you because you were already 16 smoking filtered cigarettes at the time you 17 claim you heard this statement? 18 her answer was: right. 19 right. so you had already been smoking 20 filtered marlboro cigarettes for years before 21 you ever heard this statement that you have been 22 telling us about for the better part of the day; 23 is not that right? 24 and then her answer: the first time i 25 heard about it was in 1966. eleven years after she told you she started 2 smoking filtered cigarettes, when she met and 3 married her husband. 4 now, you know that the very next day, this 5 was thursday, the very next day, friday morning 6 after she had an opportunity to go home, to 7 think about her testimony, to consult with her 8 lawyers. 9 mr. hammer: objection, judge. that is 10 totally improper. 11 the court: sustained. 12 mr. hammer: i would ask for a curative 13 instruction. 14 the court: ladies and gentlemen, you are 15 not to consider the only -- only the testimony 16 in evidence of the witnesses and exhibits not 17 the arguments of the attorneys. if you will 18 disregard the last statement. 19 mr. geraghty: you know that the very next 20 day after she made this statement under oath on 21 thursday afternoon, ms. collar went home, had 22 the opportunity to think about her testimony. 23 and when she came back on friday morning, she 24 said, well, you know, i was wrong when i said 25 this. i actually heard this statement sometime in the 1950s. that is what she said the very 2 next day. 3 are you surprised that she changed her 4 testimony when she came back the next day? 5 ms. collar wants you to believe that this 6 statement she claims she heard caused her to 7 ignore all of the warnings about the dangers of 8 smoking that she received in the 1950s, 1960s, 9 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, right on up to the present. 10 ladies and gentlemen, that story is not 11 plausible. because who can rely on a statement 12 in 1954 or 1955 when you do not hear the 13 statement until 1966? 14 who can rely on a statement like this when 15 you hear over and over and over and over again 16 from people in your life that the filtered 17 cigarettes you are smoking are going to cause you 18 to develop lung cancer and copd? 19 mr. hammer: objection, judge. no evidence 20 of that in this case. 21 mr. geraghty: ladies and gentlemen, think 22 about this. 23 the court: overruled. 24 mr. geraghty: you heard dr. proctor 25 testify, he was here for several days. given what you know about dr. proctor, the number of 2 times he is testified, the amount of money he is 3 been paid, do not you think if there was a 4 specific statement, a specific statement that 5 supported what ms. collar told you, that 6 dr. proctor would have showed it to you? 7 after all, he told you there are 80 to 8 85 million pages of documents and videos from 9 the tobacco company files, all word searchable 10 he told you. 11 we asked fannie collar did you ever discuss 12 this statement, this statement you claim you 13 heard about filters with your family, with your 14 husband, merton collar, with your foster sister, 15 christine coffin, with any of your doctors, with 16 anyone? every single time she said no, she 17 never discussed the statement with anyone, not 18 one single person. 19 why not? because the truth is and the 20 evidence you have now heard shows that the very 21 first time that fannie collar ever told anybody 22 that she heard a statement from the industry 23 that filters make cigarettes safe was after she 24 filed this lawsuit in which she is now asking 25 you to award her $15 million. hammer: objection, judge. misstates 2 the evidence. 3 the court: overruled. 4 mr. geraghty: ladies and gentlemen, you 5 did not leave your common sense outside that 6 door when you came here two weeks ago. 7 judge cox told you you can use your common 8 sense and your personal life experiences to 9 decide whether or not you are going to believe 10 the things that ms. collar tried to tell you. 11 two weeks ago when i gave my opening 12 statement, i told you this case was about two 13 words: control and responsibility. i asked you 14 as you listened to the evidence to ask yourself 15 the following series of questions, and we are 16 going to walk through all of the significant 17 events in ms. collar's life here in a moment. i 18 would ask you again to just ask yourself these 19 questions as you listen to the summary of the 20 evidence. 21 who was in control of ms. collar's 22 lifestyle choices? who was in control of her 23 decision to smoke cigarettes? who was in 24 control of ms. collar's efforts to quit smoking? 25 who controlled her motivation to quit? was ms. collar addicted? if so, was she someone 2 whose addiction was so strong, so substantial 3 that it overpowered her ability to quit smoking? 4 and finally, ask yourself, did ms. collar rely 5 on anything that philip morris, r.j. reynolds or 6 liggett said or failed to say about the health 7 risks of smoking? 8 after hearing all the evidence in this 9 case, ladies and gentlemen, you now know fannie 10 collar was not paying attention to anything 11 cigarette companies were saying. she was not 12 waiting for philip morris to tell her, smoking 13 is dangerous, you need to quit. fannie collar 14 and only fannie collar was making those 15 decisions in her life. there is no dispute. 16 she is intelligent. she is well educated. she 17 is strong-willed and independent. she did not 18 listen to what anyone told her about the dangers 19 of smoking. that is what the evidence is you have 20 heard. 21 ms. collar wants you to believe that she 22 smoked for 35 years thinking that by having a 23 filter on the cigarette it was absolutely safe. 24 that is what she told you. 25 but the undisputed evidence is in 1955, her co-worker told her, you should quit smoking 2 because my wife, my wife smoked and she 3 developed cancer. 4 in 1957, her own foster father, raymond 5 dowd, a heavy smoker, dies of cancer. she was 6 caring for him in the last months of his life. 7 throughout the decade of the 1950s, her 8 ex-husband merton collar was preaching to her 9 about the dangers of smoking. 10 in 1964, her foster sister, christine 11 coffin quits smoking when the surgeon general's 12 report is released. 13 in 1966, her father-in-law, he quit smoking 14 when the first warning label goes on cigarette 15 packs. he shows it to her. ladies and 16 gentlemen, the list goes on and on and on. 17 did fannie collar listen to any of these 18 warnings? these warnings came from people that 19 she loved, that she respected, that she trusted. 20 you already know the answer to the 21 question. of course ms. collar did not listen. 22 she continued smoking no matter what anyone told 23 her. she was the kind of person that was going 24 to smoke no matter what anyone said to her. 25 that is why she told the co-worker back in 1955, it is not going to happen to me. i'm going to 2 live until i'm in my 80s, and i'm not slowing 3 down until i'm in my 80s. 4 when her husband, merton collar, said 5 fannie, you should not smoke. what did she tell 6 her own husband? mind your own business. it is 7 my decision whether or not i smoke. that is what 8 she told her own husband. 9 after hearing all the evidence, you know 10 that fannie collar has chosen to live her life 11 the way she wanted. her attitude about 12 cigarette smoking was no different. the truth 13 is ms. collar did enjoy smoking cigarettes. for 14 many years, she was simply not interested in 15 quitting. she enjoyed smoking. cigarettes 16 relaxed her. they helped her focus and 17 concentrate. they helped her cope with stress 18 in her life. 19 every single expert you heard from in this 20 case told you people find cigarette smoking and 21 the effects of nicotine to be pleasurable. they 22 release dopamine. it makes you feel good. so 23 why do you think ms. collar said -- she just 24 denied, did not want to admit that she enjoyed 25 smoking. of course, ladies and gentlemen, you heard 2 that when ms. collar was finally motivated to 3 stop smoking in 1993, she quit for 13 or 14 4 years with no cravings and no urges to smoke. 5 that is what she told you. 6 the truth is ms. collar could have quit 7 smoking any time she wanted to. frankly, ladies 8 and gentlemen, you heard that from the very 9 first witness who testified. you may not 10 recall, but it was dr. suen, ms. collar's own 11 treating pulmonologist, from right here in vero 12 beach. you saw his testimony by videotape. we 13 took his deposition in the case. 14 what did dr. suen tell you? this is 15 dr. suen's testimony from two weeks ago on 16 tuesday. 17 if a smoker is not well motivated, in your 18 experience, is there any likelihood that the 19 smoker will successfully quit smoking? 20 dr. suen said: it is very much less likely 21 if they are not motivated. 22 question: nobody can do it for you, in 23 other words? 24 his answer: right. 25 question: would you agree that ms. collar quit when she was sufficiently motivated to do 2 so? 3 i believe so, yes. 4 that is from dr. suen. he is been treating 5 her since 1993. he probably knows her better 6 than anybody you heard from during the course of 7 this entire trial. he has no interest in the 8 outcome of this case. he told you fannie collar 9 quit smoking when she was motivated to do so. 10 frankly, ladies and gentlemen, that is all 11 you really need to know to decide the issues in 12 this case. 13 in this country we have the right to make 14 decisions for ourselves, even decisions that 15 today with the benefit of hindsight we might all 16 say were not in her best interests. 17 we believe in free will. that is a 18 fundamental principle upon which our country was 19 founded. you do have the right to make your own 20 decisions in life. but with that right comes 21 the obligation to accept personal responsibility 22 for the consequences of those actions and those 23 decisions. 24 you have not heard anything, any evidence in 25 this case that nicotine somehow robbed fannie collar of her free will. no evidence. 2 you saw her testify on the stand. she is 3 an intelligent, well-educated and strong-willed 4 person. 5 now, let me take one more moment and talk 6 about the burden of proof. you have seen medical 7 records. you have heard testimony for the last 8 two weeks. fannie collar bears the burden to 9 prove by the greater weight of the evidence all 10 of her claims in this case. so what does that 11 mean? 12 it means that ms. collar and her attorneys 13 were required to bring you more persuasive, more 14 convincing evidence than the mountain of 15 evidence, the literal mountain of evidence that 16 we have presented during the course of the last 17 two weeks that demonstrates that ms. collar was 18 always in control, that she was not some 19 hopeless addict, and that addiction was not the 20 legal cause of her disease. 21 we are going to walk through the significant 22 events in her life in just a minute. and as we 23 do that, you will see that the plaintiff has 24 simply failed to carry her burden of proof in 25 this case. that is what you have seen over the last two 2 weeks. 3 so let me show you the timeline. 4 everything on the timeline are things you have 5 heard about during the course of the evidence 6 over the last two weeks. let me kind of orient 7 you here for a second. the timeline of events 8 in ms. collar's life, can everybody see that? 9 everything above this blue bar here in the 10 middle, these are all things that occurred in 11 ms. collar's life. everything below the blue 12 bar are things that occurred here in the united 13 states with respect to cigarette smoking and 14 health. 15 so let us start at the very beginning. you 16 heard that fannie collar was born in 1934 in 17 waterville, maine. she was raised by loving 18 foster parents. her foster father, raymond 19 dowd, was a funeral director and owned a general 20 store. her mother was a homemaker. you heard 21 her mother was very strict. her mother set the 22 rules, and she expected her children to follow 23 the rules. 24 now, mr. hammer said, i heard mr. hammer 25 say, that cigarette companies hid the fact that cigarette smoking could be addictive and could 2 cause disease for more than 50 years, and people 3 in this country had no idea that cigarette 4 smoking could be dangerous or addictive. 5 well, based on the evidence you heard over 6 the course of the last two weeks, you know that 7 simply is not true, and it is certainly not true 8 as far as fannie collar is concerned. 9 long before fannie collar was born, you 10 heard dr. proctor testify, dr. proctor told you 11 that cigarette smoking, tobacco use and smoking 12 was associated with lip, mouth and oral cancer 13 going back to the 1700s and 1800s. that is not 14 even on the timeline here. not even on the 15 timeline. 16 he told you that as far back as the 1850s 17 and 1860s people were smoking roll-your-own 18 cigarettes. they were inhaling those cigarettes 19 and they were addictive, just like cigarettes 20 told today. that is what dr. proctor told you. 21 he told you in 1899 the state of florida 22 banned the sale of cigarettes. banned the sale 23 of cigarettes in 1899 in part because they were 24 considered to be dangerous and addictive, 25 particularly to young people and women. that is what dr. proctor told you. 2 if we could bring up the florida health 3 notes real quick. you saw the florida health 4 notes -- this is florida health notes. i showed 5 this to dr. proctor during my examination. the 6 date is july 1906 to june 1907. more than 100 7 years ago the florida department of health said 8 that today the cigarette is looked upon by all 9 smokers as a very worse form of tobacco 10 addiction. that is in 1907. 11 you heard if we go back, well over 100 12 years ago, people in this country were referring 13 to cigarettes as coffin nails and cancer sticks. 14 they were saying that people had nicotine fits, 15 and smokers were nicotine feigns. these were 16 terms that were being used in this country well 17 over 100 years ago. 18 so it is no surprise, ladies and gentlemen, 19 when we get to the late '40s and early 1950s 20 fannie collar told you she heard "coffin nails" 21 used as a term to refer to cigarettes. she 22 heard cigarettes referred to as "cancer sticks." 23 she described herself as having nicotine fits 24 back in the 1950s and 1960s. that is what she 25 told you. she told you, i considered myself to be addicted as far back as the 1950s. that 2 was not hidden from her. 3 of course she did on the stand say, well, 4 coffin nails, cancer sticks, i just thought 5 those were old wives' tales. but this was 6 someone educated as a nurse. and she told you, 7 i never bothered to ask anybody. that is what 8 ms. collar told you. 9 as we move into the '30s and 1940s, you 10 heard that there are articles published in 11 magazines, including reader's digest, that 12 discuss the health risks and addictive nature of 13 smoking. i talked with dr. proctor about some 14 of those. 15 could we bring up the next one, please? 16 reader's digest, november 1924, the article 17 is called "does tobacco injure the human body?" 18 in 1924 tobacco was injurious to the human body. 19 its use sometimes induces cancer. 20 can you show us the next one from 1938? 21 reader's digest, august 1938, the article 22 is "so you are going to stop smoking?" here is 23 what it says. "sooner or later nearly every 24 cigarette smoker discovers that he is not 25 smoking by choice but by habit, and the habit is probably harmful. so he tries to break free from 2 it, but he find that he does not know how. 3 sometimes halfheartedly, sometimes earnestly, he 4 wrestles with his addiction, but in vein. his 5 self-control has been perilously undermined by a 6 mere mechanism of habit." 7 these are the kind of articles that were 8 being published in reader's digest magazine in 9 the 1920s, '30s and '40s, when fannie collar was 10 growing up. she said her family had these 11 magazines in her home, and her father sold those 12 magazines out of his general store. 13 as we move into the early 1950s, you heard 14 about some of the scientific research that was 15 being published that specifically linked smoking 16 to lung cancer. dr. proctor told you that these 17 studies made front page news in newspapers and 18 magazines all across the country. he told you 19 that so widespread was this information that by 20 1954, ninety percent of the american public had 21 heard that cigarette smoking was a cause of lung 22 cancer. 23 this is one of the articles he showed you 24 from life magazine. that famous story, "smoke 25 gets in the news," published december 21st, 1953. they showed the mice getting cancer on 2 their backs. 3 i asked dr. proctor: ninety percent of the 4 people who were surveyed in june of 1954, about 5 six months after this study, said, yes, they had 6 read or heard that cigarette smoking may be a 7 cause of cancer of the lung. 8 his answer was: that is right. 9 that was dr. proctor. 10 so let us move back up above the blue bar 11 here. we are in this period of time. you know 12 in the mid-1940s fannie collar's foster father, 13 brother and sister smoked cigarettes. you know 14 that her mother hated smoking, and her mother 15 did not smoke. 16 fannie collar told you she tried cigarettes 17 for the first time in 1946 at the age of 12. 18 her and her friend take a pack of cigarettes, 19 they split the entire pack. she coughed. she 20 was dizzy. she was lightheaded. she said it 21 was not pleasant. 22 within a month or two after, her mother 23 caught her smoking a cigarette and slapped her 24 and told her, do not smoke. ms. collar said that 25 was the only time her mother ever laid a hand on her. while she continued to sneak cigarettes 2 here and there, she said she did not do it very 3 often because she was concerned about being 4 caught by her mother. that is what she told you. 5 in 1948, she attends an exclusive private 6 high school called the erskine academy. you 7 heard that she was a very good student. she was 8 on the honor roll. she was in the nursing club. 9 that brings us to about 1952, when she 10 graduates from high school. she wanted to 11 become a nurse. you heard that she attends 12 nursing school. ms. collar told you that when 13 she was in nursing school, what did she study? 14 pharmacology, biology, chemistry. she studied 15 the sciences. she learned how to read and write 16 medical records. she understood how to take 17 care of patients, administer drugs. she learned 18 all of that while a nursing student at the age 19 of 18 and 19 years old in 1952 and 1953. 20 she then decides to attend business school, 21 and she graduates from a two-year business 22 program in just one year. 23 that is what she told you. 24 at this point she moves back in, she is 25 living with her parents in 1953 and 1954 and she says, i was smoking about two or three 2 cigarettes a day while i was driving back and 3 forth from my parents' home to gates business 4 college. 5 she is living with her mother. she is not 6 smoking at all around her mother. this is when 7 she is 18, 19 and 20 years old. 8 in 1955 -- we are going to move forward on 9 the timeline. in 1955 she meets and marries her 10 husband, merton collar. he is a cigarette smoker 11 too. mr. collar is smoking marlboro red, a 12 filtered cigarette. ms. collar said after they 13 got married, she switches from unfiltered old 14 gold cigarettes to her husband's filtered 15 marlboro red. 16 mr. hammer: objection, judge. misstates 17 the testimony. 18 mr. geraghty: i'll show you the testimony. 19 the court: overruled. 20 mr. geraghty: this is ms. collar's 21 testimony. this was on friday, i believe. 22 ms. collar basically said, you know, i never 23 really bought cigarettes. i simply smoked the 24 brands that the people i was living with bought. 25 she told you that was the pattern with her father. that was the pattern with her husband, 2 merton collar, and that was later the pattern 3 with her boyfriend, ben sweeney. 4 here is her testimony. 5 if you were living with somebody else and 6 they bought the cigarettes and you smoked what 7 they bought, true? 8 her answer: pretty much. 9 all right. and you let whoever was buying 10 the cigarettes chose the brand, correct? 11 her answer: yes. 12 and you just smoked what the purchaser 13 smoked, right? 14 most of the time, yes. 15 and you were not going to complain about the 16 brand because the price was right? 17 remember, she chuckled about that. that 18 was her testimony. 19 so while ms. collar made the decision to 20 smoke, the evidence is clear that throughout her 21 entire life, she let other people choose the 22 brands of cigarettes she smoked. 23 she also told you: well, i remember that 24 at some point after i switched from the old 25 golds, i was only smoking about a half a pack. and at some point after i switched, i started 2 smoking a full pack of the marlboro red filtered 3 cigarettes. 4 she told you she remembered that. she was 5 aware of that. 6 dr. proctor told you it is common sense. 7 smoking two cigarettes is worse than one. 8 smoking 20 cigarettes is worse than 10. 9 that is back in 1955. 10 we talked earlier about how ms. collar 11 claims that for 35 years she believed smoking 12 cigarettes was absolutely safe. well, here are 13 all of the things that people told her in the 14 1950s and in the 1960s. 15 in 1955 you heard about -- do you remember 16 the co-worker? the co-worker says, hey, you 17 should quit smoking. my wife quit -- excuse me. 18 my wife smoked, and she died of lung cancer. i 19 do not want the same thing to happen to you. 20 that is what her co-worker told her. 21 let me just show you that testimony. this 22 was on thursday. when her co-worker told her, 23 you know what, you should quit smoking or you are 24 going to end up like my wife, this is when she 25 said -- you said to him, it is not going to happen to me. 2 her answer: right. 3 you said, you know what, i'm going to live 4 until i'm in my 80s. 5 that is right. i did say that. i remember 6 now. 7 initially, ms. collar did not recall this, 8 but when i asked her about it, she said it 9 jogged her memory. 10 you said, i'm not going to slow down until 11 i'm in my 80s, right? 12 right. 13 this was in 1955? 14 right. 15 that was ms. collar's testimony under oath 16 on thursday. 17 around the same period of time you heard 18 that her husband, merton collar, is telling her 19 the same thing from the moment they met in 1955. 20 plaintiff's own expert, dr. niaura, told 21 you, dr. niaura told that you merton collar 22 preached to his wife about the dangers of 23 smoking. that is what dr. niaura told you. 24 ms. collar would tell him, mind your own 25 business. it is my decision whether or not i smoke. 2 here is dr. niaura's testimony. this was 3 mr. sexton was asking the questions, as you may 4 recall. 5 and when mr. collar would preach to 6 ms. collar in the 1950s to quit smoking, she 7 would tell him to mind his own business; is not 8 that right? 9 answer: yes. 10 ms. collar told mr. collar when he was 11 preaching about the dangers of smoking that 12 smoking was her decision? 13 her answer: yes. 14 that was her answer. 15 but just two days after dr. niaura 16 testified, dr. niaura testified i believe it was 17 on tuesday to this, two days later, on thursday, 18 ms. collar got on the stand and she said none of 19 this is true. none of this is true. 20 she said her husband never preached to her 21 about the health risks of smoking, and she never 22 told him to, mind your own business. 23 think about it, ladies and gentlemen. 24 dr. niaura is ms. collar's own expert. you 25 heard him tell you that ms. collar's lawyers gave him all of the depositions of all of the 2 witnesses in the case so he would be in a 3 position to talk to you about her. dr. niaura 4 read merton collar's deposition, and he told you 5 that this is what merton collar said in his 6 deposition under oath. 7 ms. collar came in two days later and said 8 none of it is true. 9 do not you think that if what ms. collar, 10 what fannie collar was trying to tell you was 11 true, and not what dr. niaura here said under 12 oath, which i've put on the board, do not you 13 think merton collar would have come in here and 14 said -- [#deleted objection dialogue#] 5 mr. geraghty: thank you, your honor. 6 plaintiff's counsel gave dr. niaura all of 7 the depositions in the case. dr. niaura told 8 you he read those depositions. he told you that 9 merton collar said, i preached to my wife that 10 she needed to quit smoking as far back as the 11 '50s. she responded to him, mind your own 12 business. it is my decision whether or not i 13 smoke. dr. niaura told you that. 14 ms. collar took the stand two days later 15 and told you that what her own expert said, her 16 own expert who had read all of the depositions, 17 was wrong. dr. niaura was right. what 18 ms. collar told you on the stand when she denied 19 all of this, that was not the truth. not the 20 truth. 21 later that same year -- we are moving 22 forward here -- you heard her father, raymond 23 dowd, a long-time, heavy smoker is diagnosed 24 with cancer and passes away. so despite going 25 to nursing school and learning the sciences, despite what her husband told her, despite what 2 her co-worker told her, ms. collar told you, you 3 know, the idea that cigarette smoking might have 4 been associated with my father's cancer never 5 crossed my mind. it just never crossed my mind. 6 but, ladies and gentlemen, all you need to 7 do, all you need to do is look at ms. collar's 8 own actions. she told you that within a few 9 years of all of these events happening in the 10 late 1950s, she says, for a period of time i 11 switched from smoking filtered cigarettes to a 12 lady's pipe. she told you about the lady's 13 pipe. she said, my brother, eddie, told me that 14 pipe smokers do not actually inhale the smoke, 15 they hold the smoke in their mouth. 16 why was ms. collar interested in switching 17 from cigarettes to a pipe? because, ladies and 18 gentlemen, she knew whether the cigarette had a 19 filter on it or not, that she was inhaling smoke 20 into her lungs and she knew that that could 21 cause lung cancer and other diseases. that is 22 why she did it. 23 actions speak louder than words. 24 so that brings us to 1964. in january of 25 1964 you heard the surgeon general of the united states issues a landmark report that says 2 cigarette smoking causes lung cancer and chronic 3 bronchitis, which is a form of copd. this is 4 1964. 5 we showed you -- this is in evidence. this 6 is the front page of the portland sunday 7 telegram on january 12, 1964. "cigarettes cause 8 cancer says report." 9 ms. collar told you her and her husband 10 were living in portland, maine, the day -- the 11 exact period of time when this report was 12 released and that newspaper article was 13 published. that is what she told you. 14 we showed you harry reasoner and the 15 coverage from cbs news. so, you know, every 16 american, including fannie collar, was told in 17 1964 cigarette smoking causes lung cancer. 18 this was more than 50 years ago. almost 30 19 years before ms. collar was diagnosed with lung 20 cancer. 21 dr. proctor told you '64 was the turning 22 point, the beginning of the end of cigarettes in 23 this country. that is what he told you from the 24 witness stand. 25 we showed him the chart. i think mr. hammer actually showed the chart. from 1964 2 there is been a steady decline in the number of 3 people smoking cigarettes in this country, to 4 the point where today, the percentage of people 5 who smoke, is what it was back in the early 6 1930s during the great depression. that is what 7 dr. proctor told you. ms. collar wants you to 8 believe that she was the only one who missed 9 this, the only one who missed this. 10 she was living in portland, maine, but she 11 said, well, we did not really watch the news. we 12 were probably snowshoeing at our summer cottage 13 by the lake. that is what she told you. 14 we know one person who did not miss this 15 story. we know one person who did not miss this 16 story. that was her older foster sister, 17 christine coffin. you heard in 1964, her older 18 sister, who she was very close with, who she 19 smoked cigarettes with, quit smoking when she 20 heard this news. she quit smoking when she 21 heard this news. they smoked cigarettes 22 together. of course they would have 23 naturally -- ms. collar would have said, 24 christine, you are not smoking, why are not you 25 smoking. hammer: objection. misstates the 2 evidence. 3 the court: sustained. 4 mr. geraghty: it is a reasonable inference, 5 your honor, based on the evidence. 6 the court: sustained. 7 mr. geraghty: all right. 8 okay. we know ms. collar did not miss what 9 happened two years later in 1966. you heard 10 that in 1966 when ms. collar was 31 years old, 11 congress passes a law that requires that every 12 pack of cigarettes carry a warning label that 13 says "caution, cigarette smoking may be 14 hazardous to your health." 15 ms. collar said, i was aware of this 16 warning label. i saw it. i understood exactly 17 what it meant. it did not tell me anything i 18 did not already know. 19 here is her testimony. 20 now, this warning label in 1966 did not tell 21 you anything you did not already know; is not that 22 right? 23 her answer was: right. 24 and we know that because her father-in-law, 25 a heavy cigarette smoker, her father-in-law, a heavy cigarette smoker, he shows her the warning 2 label and he told her, i'm going to quit. this 3 says cigarette smoking causes disease. i'm 4 going to quit. her father-in-law quits in 1966. 5 ms. collar said that her father-in-law's 6 decision to quit in 1966 was his decision, but 7 she made no effort to quit when that warning 8 label appeared. 9 ladies and gentlemen, this same warning 10 label went on all packs of cigarettes, 11 unfiltered, camel cigarettes, filtered marlboro 12 red cigarettes, no distinction. that is what the 13 evidence shows. 14 ms. collar knew smoking was dangerous. 15 she is 31 years old. she is healthy. she enjoys 16 smoking. at this point, her attitude is it is 17 not going to happen to me. 18 that brings us to 1970. let us move forward 19 on the timeline. four years later. 1970, a new 20 warning label goes on all packs of cigarettes. 21 the warning now says, "the surgeon general has 22 determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous 23 to your health." cigarette smoking is dangerous 24 to your health. 25 you heard ms. collar's testimony. she said, yeah, i understood that as of 1970 the 2 surgeon general has determined that smoking is 3 dangerous to your health. 4 i said, if you really heard 5 something different from the cigarette 6 companies, why did not you ask somebody? why 7 did not you ask your doctor? 8 did not do it. did not think to do it. 9 in 1971 all cigarette ads are taken off of 10 television and radio here in the united states. 11 and then one year later, in 1972, every 12 cigarette ad in a newspaper or a magazine or a 13 billboard is required to carry this same surgeon 14 general's warning. that is as of 1972. 15 now, mr. hammer tried to tell you, he used 16 the word "drown." he told you all of the 17 warnings and all of the health messages that 18 we have been talking about, all of those over the 19 20 years prior to this point somehow were being 20 drowned out by statements made by cigarette 21 companies. that is what mr. hammer told you. 22 but the evidence you have heard shows just 23 the opposite. 24 remember what dr. proctor told you. 25 dr. proctor told you that between 1964, when that very first surgeon general's report came 2 out, and 1979, somewhere in this period of time, 3 30 million americans quit smoking. 30 million. 4 that is two million people every single year. 5 they have heard the same information as 6 ms. collar. many of them would be considered 7 addicted, according to the standards that 8 dr. niaura and dr. mannino told you. but 9 millions make the decision to quit and they quit 10 for good, despite all of the statements that 11 mr. hammer talks about, despite all those 12 statements. but not ms. collar. 13 you heard the facts. she saw the warnings. 14 she understood what they meant. she is healthy. 15 she enjoys smoking cigarettes. at this point, 16 she is not truly motivated to quit smoking. 17 that brings us to 1976. you heard that 18 ms. collar starts working for an elderly woman 19 named margaret gardener. ms. collar was hired 20 as ms. gardener's personal nurse. shortly after 21 she starts working for ms. gardener, 22 ms. gardener is hospitalized for congestive 23 heart failure and a heart attack and she quits 24 smoking. 25 why does ms. gardener quit smoking? her doctor told her to quit. the same doctor that 2 ms. collar was talking to so she would know how 3 to take care of ms. gardener, so she would know 4 what medications to give her, so she would be 5 able to take care of her after she was out of 6 the hospital. 7 at this point, ms. collar actually said, 8 yeah, you know, i know from my experience as a 9 nurse, that doctors would tell people who had 10 heart attacks that they should quit. people who 11 have congestive heart failure, they should quit. 12 ms. collar heard that. 13 somehow she did not think that that applied 14 to her, that it also was not harmful to your 15 lungs. 16 once ms. gardener quit smoking, you heard 17 fannie collar said, i never smoked around 18 ms. gardener. it would be unethical. it is 19 common sense. if you are a nurse or a doctor, 20 you do not smoke around your patient. 21 so she hardly ever smoked during that 22 seven- or eight-year period she worked for 23 ms. gardener. occasionally, she would go back 24 out on the patio and have a cigarette. but she 25 controlled where, when, and how much she smoked when the circumstances, her job circumstances, 2 required it. 3 dr. ticknor told you that is not addiction. 4 that brings us to the early 1980s. you 5 know that she gets separated from and divorces 6 mr. collar. 7 that brings us to 1985. there is now a 8 series of four rotating warnings that go on all 9 packs of cigarettes as of 1985. one of those 10 warnings says, "surgeon general's warning: 11 smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, 12 emphysema and may complicate pregnancy." 13 it says right on the label that smoking 14 causes two of the diseases, the two diseases 15 we have been talking about during this trial. 16 what did ms. collar tell you? for eight 17 years, from 1985 to 1993, for eight years i 18 smoked cigarettes with these warnings on them 19 and i never looked at the warning once, not 20 once. 21 in the late -- you know that merton collar 22 first moves to florida, and at some point 23 ms. collar says, i want to move to florida too. 24 and she decides to move in with her ex-husband, 25 and they move into a home here in vero beach together. 2 in about 1990, merton collar quits smoking 3 for good. you heard the testimony. merton 4 collar quit smoking. dr. niaura told you this. 5 he was coughing. his lungs ached. he 6 attributed those things to the fact that he was 7 smoking cigarettes. that is what dr. niaura told 8 you. 9 ms. collar told you a different story. she 10 said, oh, no. merton did not quit because he was 11 concerned about his health. he had allergies 12 for most of his life, and the smoking bothered 13 his allergies and that was really it. 14 i asked her point blank: are you telling 15 us that mr. collar never said to you, fannie, i 16 need to quit because i'm concerned that 17 cigarette smoking is affecting my health? 18 she said, absolutely positively he never 19 said that. she said she was the one that 20 actually encouraged him to quit. 21 but then when we confronted her with her 22 deposition, what did the deposition show? she 23 admitted that mr. collar quit, and she continued 24 to smoke. 25 we asked her in the deposition, did you encourage him to quit? 2 and her answer, pretty profound: i left 3 him alone. i left him alone. 4 you know, for this period of time, for like 5 the next four, five years, between '89 and '93, 6 she works for a construction company, netto 7 construction. the boss does not allow anybody 8 to smoke in the office. she runs the entire 9 office. she is got to answer the phone. she is 10 got to be inside the whole day. she said, maybe 11 occasionally i would step out and have a 12 cigarette. but again, for four or five years 13 she controls where, when and how much she 14 smokes. 15 now, ms. collar claims that she tried to 16 quit many times before 1993, but she also told 17 you that those efforts to quit smoking had 18 absolutely nothing to do with concerns about her 19 health. 20 so you have to ask yourself, was she really 21 trying to quit? well, she told you she went to 22 a smoking cessation clinic. she did say that on 23 the witness stand. but she said the people at 24 the smoking cessation clinic that she attended 25 did not explain to her that cigarette smoking causes diseases like lung cancer and copd. she 2 said, in fact, i do not think they knew that 3 cigarette smoking was bad for your health. 4 ladies and gentlemen, we brought someone 5 who ran smoking cessation clinics twenty-five 6 years ago, dr. ticknor. why do you think there 7 are smoking cessation clinics? what did 8 dr. ticknor tell you? do they tell people at 9 the smoking cessation clinic that smoking causes 10 lung cancer and copd? of course they do. why? 11 dr. ticknor explained it to you. you want to 12 motivate people to change their behavior. to 13 motivate them, you need to explain to them what 14 are the benefits of quitting smoking. what are 15 the consequences if you continue with this 16 behavior. 17 i told you in my opening statement that 18 ms. collar never used nicorette gum or nicotine 19 patch. i told that you. she admitted on the 20 stand, i never used a patch or the gum. 21 the court: it is been one hour. 22 mr. geraghty: she declined a patch when it 23 was actually offered to her in arizona in 2009. 24 that is the only reference to the patch or the 25 gum in all of the medical records in this case. ms. collar's family, dr. niaura told you 2 this, neither merton collar or either her son 3 mark or earl recall a single day before 1993 4 where she ever stopped smoking for an entire 5 day. 6 ms. collar told you, other than that one 7 time where i quit smoking after hypnosis for 8 about three days, other than that one time, i 9 do not think i ever stopped smoking for more than 10 a few hours before 1993. 11 that brings us to july of 1993. let me go 12 to the last page of the timeline. 13 you know in july of 1993 ms. collar is 14 diagnosed with lung cancer. she starts to cut 15 down, and she quits smoking the day that she 16 goes into the hospital. that is what she told 17 you. 18 now, mr. hammer suggested to you that she 19 was in the hospital for 45 straight days, but i 20 asked dr. mannino all about that. 21 mr. hammer: objection, judge. i did not 22 suggest anything. 23 the court: sustained. 24 mr. hammer: that is improper. 25 mr. geraghty: there was a suggestion at some point during the trial that she was in the 2 hospital for 45 days. 3 mr. hammer: objection. you just sustained 4 that objection. 5 the court: sustained. 6 mr. geraghty: you saw the medical records, 7 ladies and gentlemen. you know that after being 8 in the hospital for about two weeks, ms. collar 9 was discharged and she was out of the hospital 10 for 13 days and did not smoke for any of those 11 days. dr. mannino told you that when i showed 12 him the medical records. 13 the good news is, as you heard, the surgery 14 was successful, and after the complications 15 associated with her ulcer, the doctors told you 16 that she was cured of her cancer. 17 for the next 13 or 14 years, from 1993 to 18 about 2006, ms. collar never smoked another 19 cigarette. she testified that she did not feel 20 like she wanted to smoke a cigarette. she had 21 no cravings or urges for 13 or 14 years. 22 her own doctor -- i showed you dr. suen -- 23 he said she quit when she was motivated to do 24 so. 25 in 1997 she moves out of merton's house. eventually she meets ben sweeney. you heard 2 about that. you know that mr. sweeney is a 3 cigarette smoker too. they start to spend a lot 4 of time together. they go out to dinner. they 5 go out to clubs. they go dancing. and 6 ms. collar would have a cigarette with ben 7 sweeney. first it was just a puff or two. then 8 she would bum cigarettes. she would smoke one, two, 9 three cigarettes with him. 10 the plaintiff would have you believe that 11 ms. collar started smoking again because she was 12 addicted, but that is not what the evidence 13 shows. you saw the medical records. she told 14 you, i would go days. mr. sweeney might give me 15 a cigarette or two, but i might go two or three 16 days without seeing mr. sweeney. i would not 17 smoke when i did not see him. that is what she 18 said. 19 she was a chipper just like dr. mannino 20 told you. he told you chippers are not 21 addicted. that is from their own expert. these 22 records are all in evidence. there is a 23 particular composite pmu, it is 43999, but these 24 are all of the records in that 2006 to 2009 time 25 period where she is talking about how much she is smoking, a half a pack a week, has not smoked for 2 over a month, has not smoked in 16 days, has not 3 smoked for a week, smoking a quarter of a pack, 4 two to five cigarettes a day. that is what she 5 told her doctors in her medical records. 6 the truth is, and the evidence has shown, 7 ladies and gentlemen, that ms. collar started 8 smoking again because her boyfriend smoked and 9 she enjoyed smoking with him. they went dancing 10 two or three times a week. they had fun 11 together. 12 now, did her smoking increase when she 13 heard about her daughter? certainly. 14 certainly. there is no dispute about that. but 15 her decision to resume smoking in 2006 was an 16 informed decision by an adult with knowledge 17 that smoking was dangerous and addictive. 18 she did it anyway, though. you know that 19 in june of 2009, after going to arizona with ben 20 sweeny, had an exacerbation of her copd and the 21 light bulb again goes off with ms. collar. i 22 have to stop smoking. i've been doing it for 23 the last three years, but i have to stop. i had 24 an exacerbation of my copd. 25 all these records, they are all in evidence. she told all of these doctors, i quit in june of 2 2009. 3 so that brings us to the present. 4 ms. collar is now 81 years old. you heard 5 her own doctor say she is been cancer free for 6 more than 20 years, and she is been cured of her 7 cancer. you know that she is been diagnosed with 8 copd, but her own doctor, dr. suen, told you 9 that her lung function was pretty stable for 10 many years after her surgery until she decided 11 to resume smoking again in 2006. 12 you heard dr. suen also tell you that her 13 breathing is stable and that her condition is 14 well managed with medication. ms. collar has 15 other health issues which you have heard about 16 which is not unusual for someone her age. 17 the truth is at some point we all slow 18 down. we cannot always do what we want. but 19 fortunately, you know that ms. collar's health 20 issues have not prevented her from living an 21 independent lifestyle. you have heard that 22 ms. collar sleeps with oxygen at night, but she 23 does not use oxygen during the day to perform 24 most of her day-to-day activities. she drives 25 to see her friends, to all of her appointments. before mr. sweeney passed away, they traveled 2 frequently. they went to maine in her rv. they 3 went to arizona. she did not use supplemental 4 oxygen when they did that. she is traveled 5 recently to biloxi, mississippi and sarasota, 6 florida, both times traveling without oxygen. 7 that is the story, ladies and gentlemen. 8 that is the story that brings us here together 9 and has brought us here together for the last 10 two weeks. 11 now, with the time i have left, i would 12 like to talk to you about the questions on the 13 verdict form. 14 this is the first question you are going to 15 be asked on the verdict form. was fannie collar 16 addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine? if 17 so, was her addiction a legal cause of her lung 18 cancer and/or copd? 19 so that is the first question. this 20 question can really be broken down, ladies and 21 gentlemen, in two parts. was fannie collar 22 addicted to cigarettes, part one. and part two, 23 if so, was her claimed addiction a legal cause 24 of her lung cancer and copd? 25 if your answer to that question is no, that is a verdict for the defendants. if you answer 2 yes, that is a verdict for the plaintiff. 3 so was fannie collar addicted to cigarettes 4 containing nicotine? let me remind you, the 5 court has not given you a definition of 6 addiction or a set of medical criteria to 7 determine whether ms. collar was addicted. 8 so what is the evidence you have heard? 9 plaintiffs first brought you dr. niaura. 10 dr. niaura decided that ms. collar was addicted 11 almost one year before he ever spoke to her. he 12 is not a medical doctor. in fact, he is not even 13 licensed as a psychologist. he told you he is 14 never diagnosed anyone as addicted. that is not 15 what he does. the first person he ever said was 16 addicted was fannie collar herself. 17 mr. hammer: objection, judge. misstates 18 the evidence. 19 the court: sustained. 20 mr. geraghty: he claims he used the dsm-v, 21 but he never showed it to you. he never 22 explained to you why he thought she was addicted 23 under the dsm-v. 24 the plaintiff also brought you dr. mannino, 25 a pulmonologist, who does not see patients very often and very rarely sees patients who are 2 smokers. that was dr. mannino. he admitted 3 just a few years ago, i'm not an addiction 4 expert, but he changed his mind. he changed his 5 mind for purposes of this case. 6 dr. mannino initially tried to dispute 7 this, but he eventually acknowledged that he 8 decided that ms. collar was addicted before he 9 had read a single page of her medical records or 10 any of the depositions. he told you he had a 11 10-minute conversation with mr. gdanski, and 12 mr. gdanski told him fannie collar smoked 13 cigarettes and had lung cancer and copd. 14 dr. mannino said, you know what, that is good 15 enough for me. she must be addicted. 16 ladies and gentlemen, ask yourself, is that 17 the way we diagnose people with illnesses in 18 this country? of course not. of course not. 19 but what did dr. mannino admit when i 20 crossed him? he said, people who do not smoke 21 every day are not addicted. we call them 22 chippers because they can control where, when 23 and how much they smoke. and you know that 24 there were many years when ms. collar did not 25 smoke every day. she said that was the case when she was smoking with ben sweeney. 2 addiction is one of the key issues in this 3 case, ladies and gentlemen, but plaintiff's 4 expert concluded that fannie was addicted before 5 they had all the facts. 6 so that brings us to ms. collar. she 7 repeatedly told you that she thought she was 8 addicted and she tried to quit many times, but 9 she could not recall more than one occasion 10 before 1993 where she tried to quit for more 11 than a few hours. 12 so when you evaluate ms. collar's testimony 13 that she was addicted, bear in mind that the 14 same person who is telling you that she is 15 addicted is the same person who just asked you 16 for $15 million. 17 mr. hammer: objection. improper argument. 18 the court: overruled. 19 mr. geraghty: she refuses to admit many 20 things that your common sense tells you must be 21 true. much of what she said is contradicted by 22 what she told her own doctors in her own medical 23 records many years ago. 24 we brought you dr. ticknor. you know based 25 upon what you heard dr. ticknor say, and the evidence in this case, ms. collar is not 2 addicted. 3 dr. ticknor is a board-certified clinical 4 psychiatrist, a medical doctor. over the course 5 of his career, he is diagnosed thousands of 6 people with addictions to all sorts of 7 substances. he has run smoking cessation 8 clinics. every week he sees about 20 to 30 9 people who are there because they would like 10 counseling to quit smoking. he is diagnosed many 11 smokers as addicted. unlike the plaintiff's 12 experts, dr. ticknor actually took the time to 13 get to know fannie collar. he read all of her 14 medical records, all of the depositions. he had 15 a two-hour-and-40-minute psychiatric examination 16 with her and then he filled out a very detailed 17 report and provided it to everybody. he gave 18 you a real set of medical criteria to determine 19 whether fannie collar was addicted. the dsm-v, 20 we put it on the screen. he explained it to 21 you. he walked you through his analysis in 22 detail. dr. ticknor told you ms. collar was not 23 addicted to cigarettes. 24 so at the end of the day, ladies and 25 gentlemen, you have to ask yourself, is the plaintiff's evidence sufficient in a court of 2 law or should something more be required? like 3 tangible, credible, believable evidence from 4 someone who does not have an interest in the 5 outcome of the case. 6 i think, ladies and gentlemen, based upon 7 the two weeks we have spent here, the answer 8 should be obvious. the answer should be no, 9 fannie collar was not addicted. 10 but even if you believe that she was 11 addicted, your work is just beginning because 12 that still leaves the second part of this 13 question. 14 was her claimed addiction a legal cause of 15 her lung cancer and copd? 16 you saw the instruction on legal cause. 17 and i'll admit, frankly, it is a difficult 18 instruction to follow, even if you are a lawyer. 19 so let me give you an example that i think 20 will simplify the whole process. 21 we all live here in florida. we have 22 beautiful beaches. we have lots of sunshine. 23 we all know that exposure to sun -- [#deleted objection dialogue#] [#deleted recess#] 21 22 mr. geraghty: all right. let me try 23 again. 24 so you have a blemish or a mark on your 25 skin, you go see the doctor -- hammer: objection, judge. 2 the court: sustained. 3 mr. geraghty: you have a mark on your 4 skin. you may be concerned about it, and you 5 say to yourself, what do i do about it? do i do 6 anything about it? do i let it go or have it 7 looked at or continue? some people will go see 8 the doctor. 9 mr. hammer: objection, judge. 10 the court: overruled. 11 mr. geraghty: some people go to the 12 doctor. they have it checked. other people 13 do not deal with those things. they let it go. 14 so that is simply the point i'm trying to make. 15 so in the example i'm talking about, 16 exposure to the sun is the medical reason why 17 you get the blemish that may develop into skin 18 cancer, but the legal cause in the explanation 19 i'm giving you is the fact that you did not pay 20 attention to the problem. you did not have it 21 looked at by a doctor. you let too much time go 22 by. 23 so a problem that could have been addressed 24 and perhaps nipped in the bud early on becomes a 25 bigger and bigger problem to the point where you are dealing with a serious case of skin 2 cancer. that is what i mean in distinguishing 3 medical cause from legal cause. 4 in a case like this, ladies and gentlemen, 5 the question of legal cause really boils down to 6 the question of quitting smoking. quitting 7 smoking. ask yourself, based on all of the 8 evidence you have heard in this case, was fannie 9 collar's claimed addiction so strong, so 10 substantial that it stood in the way of a 11 committed and determined effort on her part to 12 quit smoking? 13 mr. hammer: objection, judge. 14 the court: sustained. 15 mr. geraghty: the evidence in this case is 16 undisputed that fannie collar could only recall 17 one occasion, just one occasion where she quit 18 smoking for more than a few hours before 1993. 19 it was not until she was diagnosed with lung 20 cancer and told by her doctor, you need to quit, 21 and then of course she did. she quit when she 22 was motivated by what her doctor told her. you 23 know, the evidence is undisputed, she quit 24 smoking for the next 13 or 14 years. she had no 25 cravings to smoke and no urges to smoke. she resumed smoking in 2006, smokes for 2 about three years, and then what happens? she is 3 told by a doctor in arizona, she is had an 4 exacerbation of her copd. she quits again in 5 2009. why? why, because she had the 6 exacerbation of copd. she knew she had to quit. 7 dr. ticknor told you what ultimately 8 determines whether someone will quit smoking is 9 motivation. where does motivation come from? 10 it does not come from chantix or wellbutrin. it 11 comes within each and every one of us. that is 12 where motivation comes from. 13 that is not just what dr. ticknor told all 14 of us here in the courtroom. he told you that is 15 what he tells his patients, motivation. who 16 else told you the same thing? dr. suen told you 17 ms. collar quit when she was sufficiently 18 motivated to do so. would you agree? i believe 19 so. that is from the doctor that knows her 20 better than anybody, from right here in vero 21 beach. 22 if you decide that fannie collar could have 23 quit smoking whenever she was truly motivated to 24 do so, then addiction is not a legal cause of 25 her disease. hammer: objection. that is not the 2 legal standard. 3 the court: sustained. 4 mr. geraghty: your honor, i'm simply 5 responding to his arguments. 6 rather, ladies and gentlemen, the legal 7 cause in this case is ms. collar's decision to 8 continue to smoke cigarettes -- 9 mr. hammer: objection, judge. that is not 10 what i said. 11 the court: overruled. 12 mr. geraghty: rather, the legal cause in 13 this case, ladies and gentlemen, is ms. collar's 14 decision to smoke cigarettes in the face of all 15 the warnings that we talked about, year to year, 16 decade to decade, 35 to 40 years, and her 17 decision not to make a committed and determined 18 and motivated effort to quit until 1993. that, 19 ladies and gentlemen, is the one and the only 20 legal cause in this case. 21 frankly, you do not have to look any further 22 than plaintiff's own experts. despite 23 everything mr. hammer told you about nicotine 24 and receptors and brain changes, what did 25 dr. niaura and dr. mannino ultimately acknowledge? they told you anyone can quit 2 smoking if they are motivated to do so. 3 60 million americans have quit smoking in 4 this country. the overwhelming majority have 5 quit cold turkey, without any assistance 6 whatsoever. most of those people would have 7 been considered, according to dr. mannino and 8 dr. niaura, as addicted. 9 nevertheless, they told you that they quit 10 and they quit cold turkey. the nicotine in 11 cigarettes did not prevent those 60 million 12 people from understanding that smoking causes 13 lung cancer and copd and from exercising their 14 free will to stop smoking. 15 during the last two weeks you have heard no 16 evidence that ms. collar was any different. 17 there is no dispute. she is intelligent. she is 18 well educated. she is independent and 19 strong-willed. the truth is that for most of 20 her life ms. collar wanted to smoke cigarettes 21 and had no real interest in quitting until after 22 she was diagnosed with cancer. 23 she told her husband, mind your own 24 business. it is my decision whether or not i 25 smoke. that is not addiction talking. that is a strong-willed, independent person saying, hey, 2 this is my decision. 3 ms. collar claims she was addicted, but 4 addiction did not force her to smoke. she 5 smoked because that is what she wanted to do, and 6 that is what the second part of this question -- 7 was her addiction a legal cause of her lung 8 cancer and/or copd? that is what that second 9 part of that question is all about. 10 you have heard the evidence. you know that 11 fannie collar was always in control, not philip 12 morris, not r.j. reynolds, not liggett, not the 13 nicotine in cigarettes. your answer to this 14 question should be no, and your verdict should 15 be for the defendants in this case. 16 now, i do not think you will get as far as 17 question number 2 on the verdict form, but since 18 mr. hammer talked about it, let me simply 19 respond. you will be asked to state the 20 percentage of any responsibility for 21 ms. collar's lung cancer and/or copd. that is 22 question number 2. 23 so what does it mean to accept 24 responsibility for the decisions we make in 25 life? well, imagine we -- there is been a lot of testimony about alcohol. people drink alcohol. 2 many of us have had the experience. imagine a 3 person who drinks and one night they drink a 4 little too much alcohol. they have a few too 5 many drinks, and the next day they wake up with 6 a hangover. we have all had the experience. you 7 wake up, eyes are blurry, bloodshot. 8 mr. hammer: objection. 9 the court: overruled. 10 mr. geraghty: the person goes to the 11 mirror. they look at themselves in the mirror 12 and say, you know what, i'm only 5 or ten percent 13 responsible for that decision i made to have all 14 those drinks last night. nobody says that. 15 nobody says that, ladies and gentlemen. 16 was anyone else responsible for the 17 decisions that fannie collar made, the decisions 18 she made to smoke cigarettes for 35 years? the 19 answer is of course not. 20 in 1955 her attitude was, i'm not going to 21 slow down until i'm in my 80s. that is what she 22 said when she was 21 years old. today she told 23 you she goes to the convenience store and buys 24 her son mark cigarettes and cigars, today. she 25 told you on friday, who knows, i may go back to smoking again. she said that after everything 2 that we have heard over the last two weeks. 3 the facts of this case show loud and clear 4 that fannie collar got up every single day, made 5 her own decisions in life, and no one else made 6 those decisions for her. accepting 7 responsibility means simply that, accepting full 8 responsibility for the consequences of the 9 decisions we make in life. 10 and that is what you should put down if you 11 get this far on the verdict form. there should 12 be no doubt that fannie collar is one hundred percent 13 responsible for the decisions she is made during 14 the course of her life. 15 now, again, i do not think you are going to 16 get this far on the verdict form, but mr. hammer 17 discussed question numbers 3 and 4. they are 18 kind of companion questions, if you will. 19 mr. hammer: objection, judge. misstates 20 the law. 21 the court: overruled. 22 mr. geraghty: question 3 says, please, 23 state as to each defendant whether ms. collar 24 reasonably relied to her detriment on a 25 statement or misinformation made by that defendant which concealed or omitted material 2 information concerning the health effects and/or 3 addictive nature of smoking cigarettes, and if 4 so, whether such reliance on a statement or 5 misinformation was a legal cause of her lung 6 cancer and/or copd. 7 that is a mouthful, right. then there is a 8 companion question 4 on the next page that is 9 worded almost -- 10 mr. hammer: objection. 11 the court: sustained. 12 mr. hammer: can we approach if need be? 13 the court: yes, approach. 14 mr. hammer: they are individual questions. 15 the court: approach. 16 mr. geraghty: do you want to approach? 17 18 the court: what is your objection? 19 mr. hammer: these are not companion 20 questions. each question is an independent 21 question. 22 mr. geraghty: they are worded almost 23 exactly the same, judge. 24 mr. hammer: it does not matter. they are 25 not companion questions. they are each independent questions. 2 mr. geraghty: it is argument, your honor. 3 the court: you can argue that on your 4 rebuttal. 5 mr. geraghty: he talked about fishes and 6 hooks and he is complaining -- 7 the court: it is not the law. i am the 8 one that instructs them. 9 10 mr. geraghty: the point i'm trying to 11 make, ladies and gentlemen, if you go over to 12 page 2, question number 4 looks very similar to 13 question number 3 except there is a reference to, 14 in furtherance of defendant's agreement to 15 conceal or omit material information. 16 so the language of the two questions, 17 you will see, are very, very similar. the concept 18 that they are trying to convey is very similar. 19 let me make two quick points. if you 20 answer yes to either question 3 or question 4, 21 the whole concept of responsibility goes out the 22 window, and the plaintiff is asking you to award 23 her one hundred percent of any damages if you decide to 24 award damages. 25 mr. hammer: objection. misstates the law. the court: overruled. 2 mr. geraghty: now, what questions 3 and 4 3 are really asking you, ladies and gentlemen, is, 4 did fannie collar make any decisions about 5 cigarette smoking because of a statement made by 6 a cigarette company that omitted information? 7 ms. collar claims that in 1966 she heard a 8 statement that if you were concerned about your 9 health, you should smoke a filtered cigarette 10 because it was safe. 11 first, you know she was smoking filtered 12 cigarettes for 10 or 11 years before she claims 13 she ever heard that statement. she told you, 14 this is the same testimony i showed you earlier, 15 that statement did not make an impression on me. 16 that statement did not make any impression on me. 17 that is what she told you. 18 the same year she claims she heard that 19 statement, 1966, was the same year that warning 20 labels go on all packs of cigarettes, filtered 21 and unfiltered. that is the undisputed evidence 22 in the case, ladies and gentlemen. the truth 23 is, there was no evidence that anything the 24 defendants said or did not say caused fannie 25 collar to start smoking or to continue smoking. after all, look at ms. collar in 2006. 2 when at the age of 72, after not smoking for 13 3 years, she begins dating ben sweeney, and she 4 starts smoking cigarettes again. she knew that 5 she had lung cancer and copd in 2006. she chose 6 to smoke anyway. now she wants you to believe 7 that she would not have made that same decision 8 back in the 1950s. 9 well, the decision she made in 2006 10 demonstrates that is not true. she did not listen 11 to her co-worker back in 1955. she did not 12 listen to her ex-husband, merton. she did not 13 listen to her foster sister, christine coffin. 14 she did not listen to her father-in-law. and she 15 certainly did not listen to her own doctors. 16 ms. collar did not listen to what anyone 17 told her. so what makes anyone think she would 18 have listened to tobacco companies? the answer 19 to both questions 3 and 4 should be no. the 20 answers should be no. 21 now, i want to talk briefly about 22 compensatory damages. again, i do not think you 23 will get this far on the verdict form, but i 24 need to respond to what mr. hammer told you. 25 he asked you to award $15 million for the decisions that ms. collar and only ms. collar 2 made to smoke. that is an incredible sum of 3 money. for some families, $50,000 is a lot of 4 money. [#deleted objection dialogue#] 6 7 mr. geraghty: $50,000 a year is a lot of 8 money, a lot of money, ladies and gentlemen. it 9 would take 20 years earning $50,000 a year just 10 to make $1 million, just to make $1 million. it 11 would take 300 years, 300 years earning $50,000 12 a year to get to the 15 million number that 13 mr. hammer asked you for. 14 no one doubts, no one doubts that 15 ms. collar's lung cancer and surgery were 16 difficult. all you had to do was watch 17 ms. collar when she testified to know that she 18 has a lot more life and energy than many people 19 who are 81 years old. you know she is been able 20 to do a lot of things that other people her age 21 are not able to do. she was dancing with ben 22 sweeney two or three nights a week just a few 23 years ago. 24 if you actually get to the issue of 25 damages, there should be no question, ladies and gentlemen, that tens of thousands of dollars, 2 let alone millions of dollars should be out of 3 the question and off the table. 4 these facts are undisputed. ms. collar 5 smoked for 35 years. she got lung cancer. but 6 fortunately, she was cured of her lung cancer. 7 you heard her own expert, dr. mannino, tell you 8 that she was very fortunate that she survived 9 stage 3 lung cancer. 10 but despite all of that, after not smoking 11 for 13 or 14 years, ms. collar dates ben 12 sweeney, and at the age of 72 she decides to 13 resume smoking because they were having fun and 14 enjoying life together in their golden years. 15 after having an exacerbation of her copd she 16 then quit smoking again in 2009. 17 dr. suen, her treating pulmonologist, told 18 you that her condition today is stable and well 19 managed with medication. but despite all of 20 that, on friday ms. collar told you, i cannot say 21 i will not be back to cigarettes again. 22 yesterday her own lawyers read to you the 23 mortality table that ms. collar is expected to 24 live nine more years to the age of 90. the 25 truth is that despite having lung cancer and copd, she is going to live a lot longer than most 2 of us in this courtroom. 3 mr. hammer: objection, judge. improper 4 argument. 5 the court: overruled. 6 mr. geraghty: given the evidence you have 7 heard in this case about fannie collar, fannie 8 collar's case, there is no basis to award 9 damages. 10 now, the final question on the verdict form 11 asks whether you find by clear and convincing 12 evidence that punitive damages are warranted 13 against the defendants in this case. i want -- 14 if you answered no to that question, you will 15 never get to the issue of punitive damages. let 16 me talk briefly to you so you understand what 17 issue you are being asked to decide. 18 you are not being asked to decide the amount 19 of punitive damages. the issue here today is 20 whether based upon clear and convincing evidence 21 the plaintiff has shown that she is entitled to 22 punitive damages. so do not spend one moment 23 thinking about the amount. the question before 24 you is whether fannie collar has shown under the 25 evidence and the law that she is entitled to punitive damages. 2 the court: you have two minutes. 3 mr. geraghty: i'll probably take one or 4 two more, but thank you. 5 if you decide that she is, there will be 6 another phase of the trial. the parties will 7 present evidence. we will have additional 8 arguments and then you will get to the amount 9 stage. 10 now, i want to make sure that if you get to 11 this issue, you clearly understand what it is 12 you will be asked to decide. when you look at 13 the instructions, you will see that clear and 14 convincing evidence is defined. it is a much 15 higher burden of proof than the greater weight 16 of the evidence. 17 with respect to punitive damages, you will 18 see that the evidence must be precise, explicit, 19 lacking in confusion, and of such weight that it 20 produces a firm belief or conviction without 21 hesitation about the issue. in other words, you 22 need to be really, really, really convinced that 23 punitive damages are appropriate. 24 based on the evidence in this case, nothing 25 the defendants did or did not do, said or did not say harmed fannie collar. philip morris, 2 liggett, and r.j. reynolds sold cigarettes. the 3 judge told you making, selling, and advertising 4 cigarettes is not a basis for liability. the 5 court instructed you that that is the case. 6 fannie collar always had the information 7 available to her to make a decision about 8 whether she wanted to smoke cigarettes or not, 9 whether she wanted to quit or not. she always 10 had the ability to quit whenever she was 11 motivated to do so, and the evidence you have 12 heard in this case demonstrates that that is so. 13 she simply did not want to quit smoking 14 until it was too late to avoid her lung cancer 15 and her copd. you have heard no evidence during 16 this trial that the defendants said or did not 17 say anything that caused her to begin smoking or 18 to continue smoking. 19 dr. proctor spent several days talking to 20 you about the culture of smoking and the tobacco 21 companies, but he admitted to you he knows 22 nothing about fannie collar. he knows nothing 23 about what she knew and what she did. 24 given the evidence you have heard, ladies and 25 gentlemen, the plaintiff simply has not met her burden of proof. there is no basis for the 2 award of punitive damages in this case. so your 3 answer to that question, if you were to get that 4 far, should be no. 5 now, i'm going to sit down in about a 6 minute. i'm in the home stretch at this point. 7 you are going to hear from ms. st. 8 peter-griffith. you are going to hear from 9 mr. belasic. after that mr. hammer will have 10 one more opportunity to speak to you. that is 11 because, as you heard, the plaintiff bears the 12 burden of proof. so he gets the opportunity to 13 speak to you one more time in what is called 14 rebuttal. 15 i do not know what mr. hammer will say, but 16 i can imagine he is going to say some things that 17 are very critical of philip morris and r.j. 18 reynolds and liggett. i'm pretty sure of that. 19 but as you listen to the things he says, ask 20 yourself, what does this have to do with fannie 21 collar? 22 what does this have to do with ms. collar 23 and the decisions that she made, a strong, 24 intelligent, and well-educated woman who, you 25 know, lived her life exactly the way she wanted to live it, who enjoyed smoking cigarettes, and 2 who was not motivated to quit until 1993? 3 the truth is, ladies and gentlemen, we do 4 enjoy a tremendous amount of freedom in this 5 country. we have the right to make decisions 6 and lifestyle choices that are not always in our 7 best interests, that can have serious health 8 consequences. with that freedom comes the 9 obligation to accept personal responsibility for 10 the consequences. 11 in the end, ladies and gentlemen, that is 12 what this case is all about. are we going to 13 hold philip morris and r.j. reynolds and liggett 14 legally responsible, legally responsible for the 15 decisions made by a strong, intelligent, and 16 independent person? that is what this case is 17 all about. 18 based on the evidence you have heard for the 19 last two weeks, the answer should be clear. 20 based on the evidence you have heard in fannie 21 collar's case, in this case, the evidence 22 supports one and only one true verdict. that, 23 ladies and gentlemen, is a verdict for philip 24 morris, r.j. reynolds, and liggett. 25 so this is my last opportunity to get to speak to you, and all i really want to do is 2 leave you with a deep, heartfelt thanks because 3 i know i spent a lot of time questioning 4 witnesses and you probably said, oh my goodness, 5 when is he going to sit down? i'm going to sit 6 down for the last time. i really sincerely 7 appreciate your time, patience, and attention to 8 everything we have done during the course of the 9 last two weeks. thank you very much. 13 ms. st. peter-griffith: may it please the 14 court, counsel, ms. collar. 15 ladies and gentlemen of the jury, i'm ann 16 st-peter griffith. it is my privilege to be 17 representing liggett group llc in this matter. 18 i want to say it is been a pleasure to be before 19 you in this courtroom. and on behalf of myself, 20 ms. kaschel and liggett, we thank you. we 21 understand that you made a tremendous commitment 22 in your jury service. 23 mr. geraghty and mr. belasic's closing 24 arguments provide you with a roadmap to checking 25 no as to each question on the jury verdict form. we agree. please remember that it is 2 plaintiff's burden of proof here as to each 3 defendant. 4 the evidence regarding liggett in this case 5 has been pretty clear. ms. collar never smoked 6 a liggett cigarette. she was never addicted to 7 any liggett cigarettes. liggett's products 8 played no role in causing her lung cancer or her 9 copd. moreover, mrs. collar could not identify 10 a single statement that she either heard or read 11 or relied upon from liggett. 12 now, you will remember she made reference to 13 a statement that she heard from the tobacco 14 institute. ms. collar did not show you that 15 statement. she never told you who said it or 16 where they said it or how they said it. she 17 knew she heard it around 1966. 18 ladies and gentlemen, even if you believe 19 that she heard or relied upon that statement, 20 you need to know something else. there was no 21 evidence of liggett's membership in the tobacco 22 institute when the statement was made, even if 23 it was. 24 mr. hammer: objection, judge. objection. 25 misstates the evidence. the court: sustained. 2 ms. st. peter-griffith: dr. proctor told 3 you that liggett was on and off as a member of 4 the tobacco institute. plaintiff did not 5 establish when liggett was a member. ms. collar 6 has not -- 7 mr. hammer: judge, can we approach? 8 the court: yes. 9 10 mr. hammer: liggett cannot distance 11 themselves from the conspiracy. they are part 12 of the conspiracy by virtue of the engle 13 findings. 14 the court: she can argue whatever she 15 wants. if she says that you did not find that 16 they were off and on -- 17 mr. hammer: you cannot distance yourself 18 from the engle findings, that is what they are 19 doing. in a very nuanced way they are arguing 20 that they are not part of the engle findings. 21 you cannot negate the engel findings. 22 the court: you can argue that on your 23 rebuttal. 24 mr. hammer: they cannot do it, judge. 25 the court: you can argue that on your rebuttal. on the jury verdict there is a 2 question about whether or not they were part of 3 the conspiracy. so overruled. 4 5 ms. st. peter-griffith: ms. collar has not 6 carried her burden of proof to show either that 7 she relied upon a material statement concealing 8 information or that liggett's participation in 9 any agreement to conceal caused her injuries. 10 now, there is only one document that 11 plaintiff showed you regarding liggett, the l&m 12 document. plaintiff's expert acknowledged that 13 liggett did not join the tirc and did not attend 14 the plaza hotel meeting. it did not sign the 15 frank statement. beginning around the end of 16 the 1960s, liggett's market share plummeted -- 17 mr. hammer: objection, judge. 18 the court: sustained. 19 mr. hammer: there is no evidence of that. 20 ms. st. peter-griffith: i'd like to take a 21 few moments to discuss with you what liggett put 22 into evidence. this information is what the -- 23 was not elicited from dr. proctor on direct. 24 it is right here. i'm not going to put it up on 25 the screen in the interest of time, but you are going to be able to take it with you into the 2 jury room. 3 the evidence shows a number of things. 4 liggett's 1963 submission to the surgeon 5 general. it is pretty big. it is heavy. it 6 discusses a link between carcinogens in 7 cigarette smoke and lung cancer, as well as 8 other diseases. liggett's extensive submission 9 also included a chapter on habituation and 10 addiction. 11 everything that is substantively in the l&m 12 document is right here, except in much, much 13 more detail. liggett turned this submission 14 over to the number 1 public health authority in 15 the country, the surgeon general. 16 some of liggett's research was also 17 published in other publications as well. as 18 these documents show, by 1966 liggett had a 19 ten-year relationship working in productive 20 collaboration with the public health authority, 21 productive collaboration. as early as 1954 22 liggett was working with the american cancer 23 society. its investment in research was 24 extensive, more than any other companies. 25 now, to be sure, other companies were also doing research. in fact, dr. proctor discussed 2 philip morris's compendium that it compiled of 3 research of all defendants as well as other 4 companies. 5 now, you heard about liggett's on and off 6 again tobacco -- membership in the tobacco 7 institute, liggett's ctr membership was under 8 four years, and liggett contributed only a 9 minuscule amount of funding to each 10 organization, under 1 percent. there is no 11 evidence of liggett engaging in youth marketing. 12 and by 1978 liggett was selling generic products 13 and not advertising. 14 dr. proctor told you that his advertising 15 opinions did not apply to liggett. liggett 16 voluntarily turned over its documents, and 17 starting in the '90s it disclosed its 18 ingredients on its cartons. beginning also in 19 the 1990s liggett placed addiction warnings on 20 all of its products and packaging voluntarily. 21 dr. proctor told you that liggett should be 22 commended, commended. this is hardly conduct 23 demonstrating participation in an agreement to 24 conceal, and it certainly does not reflect by 25 clear and convincing evidence that liggett should be subjected to punitive damages. 2 ladies and gentlemen, there is an old 3 lawyer's expression that mr. geraghty told you 4 about. jurors do not check their common sense 5 at the courthouse door. common sense tells us 6 that many aspects of plaintiff's case do not add 7 up. 8 for all of her years of smoking, ms. collar 9 said that she did not look at the warnings on 10 cigarette packs, after that initial time that 11 they were pointed out to her by her 12 father-in-law. even after being cured of 13 smoking-related lung cancer, she said that she 14 would believe that cigarettes are harmful when 15 they stopped making them. 16 as the judge has already instructed you, 17 manufacturing, selling, and advertising 18 cigarettes are lawful activities. think about 19 that. trust your common sense. 20 ladies and gentlemen, it is understandable 21 to empathize with someone who is dealing with 22 illness. however, despite what might be natural 23 feelings of sympathy, when we began this 24 process, you took an oath as jurors to follow 25 the evidence and to base your decision only upon the evidence. 2 the judge will instruct you that in 3 reaching your verdict you should not let bias, 4 sympathy, prejudice, public opinion, or any 5 other sentiment for or against any party 6 influence your decision. 7 liggett and the other defendants are not 8 responsible to ms. collar because she relied 9 upon any statement attributable to an agreement 10 to conceal. ms. collar made her own decisions, 11 and accordingly we ask that you render a verdict 12 in favor of my client, liggett, philip morris, 13 reynolds. 14 on behalf of ms. kaschel, liggett, my 15 client, the defendants, defense counsel, i just 16 want to end by saying again, thank you very much 17 for the careful attention that we know you are 18 going to pay to the evidence and for the 19 sacrifices that you have made in your service on 20 this jury. thank you. 9 mr. belasic: thank you, your honor. 10 thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for all 11 you have done both for the parties in this case 12 and, frankly, for our system of civil 13 government. i've got about 20 minutes to go 14 over a few of the issues. i'll be the last 15 defense lawyer to speak, and then mr. hammer 16 will speak. 17 i predict mr. hammer will show you a lot of 18 documents and tell you how bad they are for the 19 defendants. what i'm going to talk about, no 20 amount of documents, good, bad, or otherwise, 21 can change. 22 this morning you were hearing about what 23 mr. hammer said was a fish story, ms. collar was 24 the fish and addiction is the hook. around that 25 time he said a couple of phrases that i wrote down. one of the things that he said is that 2 when she was trying to quit over these years, 3 she was, quote, too addicted to quit. 4 well, we all know the evidence shows that is 5 not true. she quit for 14 straight years. she 6 took the stand and said that from '93 until 2006 7 or 2007 she quit, zero cigarettes. dr. niaura 8 said that she quit for those 14 years, zero 9 cigarettes. 10 she also had zero craving. the evidence, 11 again, was directly from ms. collar. when she 12 was on the stand during cross-examination, 13 mr. geraghty said, is not it true that during 14 those 14 years you had no craving? she said it 15 was not. you saw the evidence, that mr. geraghty 16 had her read her sworn testimony, the sworn 17 testimony that she gave before trial. she had 18 no craving. 19 so we know, too addicted to quit, that is 20 not right. it was just the opposite. it was 21 the other way around. she was too capable or so 22 capable, so capable of quitting that nicotine -- 23 whether you call it a nicotine habit or a 24 nicotine addiction, she was so capable of 25 quitting that nicotine cannot be a substantial contributing factor. we know she could quit. 2 when she was properly motivated, she did so. 3 we know she went back to smoking. after 14 4 years without a cigarette, at the age of 72, 72, 5 at a time went the companies were saying on 6 their website that smoking caused lung cancer 7 and copd, she started smoking when she dated ben 8 sweeney. 9 mr. hammer: objection, judge. can we 10 approach? 11 12 mr. hammer: i do not think reynolds 13 presented any evidence as to when they actually 14 put that on their website. 15 mr. belasic: dr. proctor -- this guy is 16 doing this over and over again. he is got to 17 stop doing this. i'm going to call him out in 18 front of the jury. dr. proctor said it. 19 the court: he did. 20 mr. hammer: i want that reflected on the 21 record, he is going to call me out in front of 22 the jury. 23 the court: yes. 24 mr. hammer: and you know what, they will 25 do that because they know i will never move for a mistrial. those are the things they do, 2 judge. i just want to point that out to the 3 court. 4 mr. belasic: this is the third time in a 5 row he has falsely claimed that something was not 6 in evidence. 7 the court: all right. dr. proctor 8 testified as to all of this, and there is lots of 9 it in evidence. overruled. 10 11 mr. belasic: ladies and gentlemen, as i 12 was saying, it came from dr. proctor, the 13 witness that the plaintiffs called as their very 14 first expert witness, dr. proctor was asked by 15 mr. gdanski, when did the tobacco companies 16 start telling people it caused lung cancer, 17 copd, was addictive? starting in the late '90s. 18 so five, six, seven years later, when she is 19 dating ben sweeney as a 72-year-old woman, at a 20 time when the companies are warning everyone 21 their products cause disease, their products are 22 addictive, she went back to smoking. 23 a few years later she decided to quit, and 24 we know that she has quit for the last five or 25 six years. so too addicted to quit, that is not -- just not true, it is exactly the opposite 2 of the real evidence in this case. 3 one of the other things i heard this 4 morning is, you were repeatedly asked the 5 question, what chance did fannie have? what 6 chance did ms. collar have? well, the evidence 7 from her and the evidence from her experts is 8 that when it comes to quitting, she had a 9 one hundred percent chance. when she was sufficiently 10 motivated, she had the ability to quit. 11 and there is no dispute, dr. niaura they 12 brought, dr. mannino, dr. ticknor, our evidence, 13 there is no dispute, when she was sufficiently 14 motivated, she was capable of quitting because 15 everyone in this courtroom knows that she did 16 quit. 17 there was a lot of discussion about 18 dr. suen, and i want to say a couple of things. 19 you know, you heard a lot about 8,000 pages of 20 medical records or thousands of pages of medical 21 records. you saw a lot of references to 22 different doctors. 23 in this case only one doctor for the 24 plaintiff testified, only one doctor actually 25 treated her, and that is dr. suen. he has seen her for 22 years. let us see what dr. suen said. 2 does dr. suen say nicotine overpowered her? 3 does dr. suen say nicotine was the substantial 4 contributing factor because it made her smoke 5 and she could not quit? he told you, she quit 6 when she was motivated. here is what he said. 7 (thereupon, the video clip was played and transcribed as 8 follows:) 9 q what was your impression of ms. collar's 10 awareness that smoking was not good for her health 11 during the 21 years that you were treating her? 12 a i think she knew smoking was a problem for 13 her, so i think she understood that. 14 q would you agree ms. collar quit when she 15 was sufficiently motivated to do so? 16 a i believe so, yes. 17 (thereupon, the video clip ended.) 18 mr. belasic: that is her doctor. that is 19 the only doctor that actually treated her. the 20 only doctor that treated her for 22 years. the 21 only doctor that saw her. she could quit when 22 she was properly motivated. 23 nicotine, whether you call it an addiction 24 or a habit, was not a substantial contributing 25 factor in her disease. everyone agrees that smoking was the cause of her disease. but she 2 could quit. nicotine did not make her smoke so 3 that she got a disease. 4 you know, i heard the analogy to a fish 5 story. to me, the plaintiff's case sounds a lot 6 more like the runaway car that we all hear 7 about. 8 mr. hammer: objection, judge. 9 the court: overruled. 10 mr. belasic: you hear movies, whether it is 11 a runaway train or a runaway car, the guy is in 12 the car at the top of the mountain and he is 13 going down, and the brakes are cut or there is 14 something wrong with the steering wheel, it is 15 been tampered with. 16 no amount of motivation, no amount of 17 personal choice or decision can save our hero 18 then. when there is a runaway car, you cannot 19 steer, you cannot brake, that crash is 20 inevitable. 21 but the evidence in this case is that 22 fannie collar was not strapped behind the 23 steering wheel of a runaway train. she could 24 control her smoking when she did. she could put 25 the brakes on and slow her smoking down. mr. geraghty reminded you, for seven years 2 when she worked for ms. gardiner, she could only 3 smoke a few cigarettes a day. she had to work 4 the whole day there. she was able to control 5 her smoking. 6 she was able to put the brakes on so much 7 that she could stop the car, we know 14 years, 8 no cigarettes, and no craving. the last five or 9 six years she is quit for good. she says she has 10 craving. we know she can stop the car. she 11 could stop the car at any time. 12 none of their experts, none of their 13 experts ever told you that her addiction or her 14 habit or her behavior was such that she was 15 prevented from quitting at any time. she quit 16 for 14 years in '93. there is no evidence she 17 could not quit at 83 or 73 or 63. her own expert 18 says, when she was properly motivated, she is 19 able to quit, nicotine or not. 20 i also wanted to show you what he says 21 about her copd. this is 2014, the medical 22 records that mr. hammer showed you this morning, 23 the most recent one was 2013. let us see what 24 her condition is as of august 2014. 25 (thereupon, the video clip was played and transcribed as 5266d922-96e3-46b2-98de-23842feca467 1 follows:) 2 q do you agree that plaintiff's signs and 3 symptoms for copd have been and remain well managed 4 by appropriate medication? 5 a yes. 6 (thereupon, the video ended.) 7 mr. belasic: you have heard a lot about the 8 different warnings she got over the years. i 9 do not want to discuss those just generally. but 10 on the issue that mr. geraghty introduced to 11 you, you are going to be asked, did she rely on a 12 statement or misinformation? did she take 13 action in reliance on a statement or 14 misinformation? 15 we know dr. niaura said this. he would read 16 merton collar's sworn testimony. merton collar, 17 he warned her every day. ms. collar said that 18 never happened. we know all about the co-worker 19 who said his wife got cancer. ms. collar said 20 she did not want to turn out like that. he told 21 her, i do not want you to turn out like that. 22 we know she saw the warning but one of the 23 things she says, that it did not tell her 24 anything she did not already know. we know her 25 father quit -- or her father-in-law quit. so here is these statements. i just want 2 to go over again what -- statements 3 and 4, 3 each of these questions that you are going to 4 answer says whether ms. collar reasonably relied 5 to her detriment on a statement or 6 misinformation by a defendant which concealed or 7 omitted material info. same thing. number 4, 8 did she rely to her detriment on a statement or 9 misinformation that concealed or omitted info? 10 as mr. geraghty was pointing out in both of 11 these, it is two parts. it is did she rely, and 12 then look what is in the second half of the 13 sentence, whether such reliance on a statement 14 or misinformation was a legal cause of her lung 15 cancer and/or copd. 16 same thing on question 4. you have to 17 decide, did she actually see a statement, 18 believe it, and then rely on it? and if she did 19 rely on it, did that reliance on a statement 20 actually cause -- was it the legal cause of her 21 lung cancer? 22 what does reliance mean? what reliance 23 means is, plaintiffs have to prove that it can 24 reasonably be said that but for the reliance, 25 the injury would not have occurred. is there any evidence in this case, ladies and gentlemen, 2 that if the tobacco institute had not said 3 something in 1966 -- which is what ms. collar 4 claims she heard, she said in 1966 the tobacco 5 institute said something, is there any evidence 6 in this case that if the tobacco institute 7 did not say it, that she would not have developed 8 lung cancer, any evidence that she would not 9 have developed copd, any evidence at all by the 10 plaintiff that she would have quit smoking? 11 even though she took the stand and told you 12 that she could not quit smoking all those years, 13 there is not any evidence that would allow you to 14 answer yes to those questions. 15 the fraudulently conceal instruction is the 16 same thing. they have to prove that but for the 17 reliance, she does not get lung cancer and she 18 does not get copd. what she told us is, many 19 years after she started smoking and many years 20 after she switched to filters, she saw a 21 statement from the tobacco institute, and as 22 mr. geraghty told you, she said it made no 23 impression. he put the board with her sworn 24 testimony up there. 25 same thing for material information. that is in the question. they have to show that 2 but for concealment or omission of the 3 information, she would not have acted as she did. 4 well, here is the evidence that tells us 5 pretty clearly and it shows pretty clearly, she 6 did not rely at all. when she told her 7 husband -- and again, this is from merton 8 collar's sworn testimony that dr. niaura told 9 you, so either dr. niaura and merton collar got 10 it wrong -- because ms. collar says, well, that 11 never happened, but this is the testimony of her 12 expert, based on the sworn testimony of her 13 husband, she tells him, it is my decision to 14 smoke. mind your own business. 15 she never tells him, hey, i saw something 16 and i'm going to keep smoking because i'm 17 relying on it. this supposedly happened every 18 day. dr. niaura said it was part of her 19 husband's daily routine. 20 does it make sense that if she was basing 21 30 years of smoking behavior on a statement that 22 she supposedly saw from the tobacco institute 23 that she would not once mention it to the man 24 she is lived with for the last 40 years? does 25 that make sense? mr. geraghty asked her if she had ever 2 heard any statement by the companies, and she 3 said, again, it was the industry, and it was 4 this tobacco institute, 1966. she said she would 5 never heard a statement, could not remember 6 anything from philip morris or r.j. reynolds or 7 liggett. 8 what did she hear? what she said was, 9 tobacco institute, 1966, something about filters 10 and something about smoking not being bad for 11 you. i put down here, she does not even claim 12 she heard any statement before 1966. 13 now, how can i say that? because 14 mr. hammer showed you a slide that showed her 15 saying, well, i think it was '59. well, she 16 said she thought it was 1959, and then she was 17 questioned about it more. 18 and she said she remembered that it was 19 1966 when the surgeon general's warning came 20 out. mr. geraghty showed you his boards with 21 her sworn testimony. she said, sir, it was 22 1966, when the warning came out, when her 23 father-in-law quit. 24 to be fair, we gave her one more chance. 25 the very last question she was asked by a defense lawyer, ms. collar, it was me, and the 2 very last question i asked was, i said, you told 3 us what you heard in 1966. do you have any 4 memory of hearing anything from anyone in the 5 tobacco industry before 1966? if she did, she 6 could have and would have told us. that was the 7 last question. 8 she said, no, nothing before '66. so 9 there is no way she relies on that to start 10 smoking. there is no way she can rely on 11 something that did not occur in '66 until 1955. 12 nobody has a time machine. this is not a 13 question of trying to confuse an older woman 14 about dates. she herself said this did not 15 happen until years after she switched. 16 mr. geraghty showed you, she flat out said 17 when asked, it made no impression. these are 18 her words. it made no impression on her. 19 plaintiffs have to prove that -- not only that 20 she relied, but that she relied on a statement 21 and that that was the legal cause, but in this 22 case their own plaintiff has said it made no 23 impression on her. 24 when we were asked -- when she was asked, 25 she said she had never told her husband or her doctor that she relied on a statement. so in 40 2 or 50 years on and off of smoking, in all of the 3 warnings, in all of the discussions she had with 4 her husband, with her father-in-law, when she 5 talked to her sister, anyone she talked to, with 6 all of her doctors, there is not a shred of 7 evidence that she ever once said, you know, i'm 8 relying on a quote from a tobacco company. i 9 think cigarettes are perfectly safe. 10 right at the start when mr. geraghty 11 examined her, she agreed that she said from '58 12 to '93, for 35 years she thought that cigarette 13 smoking was perfectly safe. if that was true, 14 do not you think she would have mentioned that 15 even once. 16 as mr. geraghty says, there was no evidence 17 in this case that she ever claimed to have 18 relied on anything a tobacco company said until 19 this lawsuit was filed. she never told her 20 doctors. she never told her husband. she never 21 discussed it with anyone, even when they were 22 asking her, why are you smoking? you should 23 quit. 24 now, i said, we do not have a time machine, 25 but what if there was a way we could do an experiment and find out, well, what would happen 2 if the tobacco companies had said, you know 3 what, we agree, smoking causes lung cancer. we 4 agree it is addictive. what would happen? what 5 would fannie collar do? 6 we know. dr. proctor told us in the late 7 '90s the companies began saying that smoking 8 causes lung cancer, copd, it is addictive. these 9 were public statements, a big deal. six, seven, 10 eight years later ms. collar smokes anyway. it 11 did not matter to ms. collar whether r.j. 12 reynolds admitted in a newspaper or in a 13 magazine that smoking was addictive. the 14 evidence is that had nothing to do with why she 15 smoked. it had nothing to do with why she went 16 up again. 17 in the end, the plaintiffs failed to 18 present their proof. their burden of proof is 19 to show that she would have taken different 20 action if she had not relied on the statement. 21 there is no proof she would have stopped smoking 22 if the companies had said something differently. 23 she did not even claim it herself. there is no 24 proof that ms. collar would have avoided her 25 lung cancer if the companies had said something different. 2 you know, this is not a case where you can 3 say, look, if you would have told me there was 4 mold in the house, i would not have bought it. 5 mr. hammer: objection, judge. 6 mr. belasic: that is not this case. she 7 did not present any evidence -- 8 the court: overruled. 9 mr. belasic: -- to meet the legal 10 instructions and the burden she has. the truth 11 is, we know that even when the companies said it 12 caused cancer, it did not change her mind. she 13 went back to smoking at age 72. 14 so for that reason you should vote no on 15 each of questions 3 and 4 because ms. collar did 16 not reasonably rely on a statement or 17 misinformation, and she certainly has not proven 18 that reliance on a statement was a real cause of 19 her lung cancer. no expert said that. 20 ms. collar does not claim that when she took the 21 stand. you should vote no on questions 3 and 4. 22 i want to emphasize something that 23 mr. geraghty mentioned. when you get the 24 verdict form, at the end of questions 3 and 4 25 there will be an instruction. it says, if you find for ms. collar on 3 or 4, if you vote yes 2 on either 3 or 4, that percentage fault, if you 3 even reach it, that percentage fault where you 4 have to determine what percentage she is 5 responsible for, what percentage r.j. reynolds 6 is responsible for, that will not apply at all. 7 that percentage of fault will be wiped out. 8 there will be no reduction. 9 again, we do not think you should even get 10 this far because the evidence is that whether 11 you call it nicotine or behavior or habit or 12 addiction, it was not a substantial contributing 13 factor. it was not the legal cause of her 14 disease. 15 in the end, when she told her husband, it is 16 my decision to smoke, that was not a word that a 17 tobacco company lawyer put in her mouth. that 18 was her own expert dr. niaura saying what her 19 own husband told her and what he heard her say. 20 nobody put those words in her mouth. she 21 believed it was her decision to smoke. and it 22 was. it was her choice. when she made that 23 choice, it was her responsibility. 24 let me leave you with this. what was 25 different -- during the 14 years that she quit smoking from '93 to 2007 or so, what was 2 different about nicotine? there was not anything 3 different about nicotine. what was different 4 about the effects of nicotine for her? it 5 was not. 6 what was different is that she did not smoke 7 in year one and year two and year three. what 8 changed was her mind. she changed her mind in 9 1993 and she said with clear motivation, that i 10 was not going to smoke again. when she changed 11 her mind, when she changed her behavior, when 12 she made a decision that dr. suen, her own 13 doctor, says was motivated, suddenly she did 14 quit. all that talk of nicotine being 15 substantial or nicotine controlling you, she 16 was not smoking at all. 17 when you are asked to decide legal cause, 18 think about that. nicotine had no effect. 19 nicotine was not a factor. she did not smoke at 20 all when she changed her mind, when she made 21 that motivated decision. it is been a long 22 trial. i thank you again for your service.
