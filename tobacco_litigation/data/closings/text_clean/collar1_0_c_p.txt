9 mr. hammer: thank you, judge. may it 10 please the court. counsel. 11 good morning, ladies and gentlemen. folks, 12 this has been a long trial, and i want to thank 13 you very much for your attention you have given 14 throughout the past four weeks. it is been an 15 honor to represent fannie and present her case 16 before you. she thanks you for the attention 17 you gave and for the time that you took out of 18 your own lives. we really respect that. we 19 appreciate that. 20 it is been said trial by jury, the best of 21 all safeguards for the person and property of 22 every individual. thomas jefferson said that 23 back in 1823 and it still stands true today. 24 trial by jury, it is really the great 25 equalizer. it allows people like fannie collar, just a plain old person like fannie to come into 2 court and present her case against large 3 corporations like these tobacco companies. it is 4 an equal playing field. that is what it is all 5 about. 6 you heard the judge say that corporations 7 should be treated just like people. they should 8 be looked at just like people in this courtroom. 9 and we want you to do that because with that, 10 when you want to be treated like people, you have 11 got to act like people. 12 i'm going to talk a lot about how these 13 corporations acted as compared to fannie. 14 because that is what they want you to look at, 15 fannie's choices. we want you to look at the 16 tobacco company's choices throughout the 17 history. 18 you are going to be deciding this case, and 19 it will likely be one of the biggest decisions 20 you have ever made. you hold great power, and 21 with power comes great responsibility. we 22 appreciate that and we respect that. whatever 23 decision you make, we are going to be perfectly 24 acceptable with. 25 now, you have heard evidence in this case that most people do not get to hear. most 2 people do not get to hear about what these 3 tobacco companies have done. 4 mr. geraghty: your honor, that is not in 5 the evidence in the case. 6 the court: overruled. 7 mr. hammer: you have gotten to hear about 8 these tobacco companies, about the history of 9 these tobacco companies, things that they never, 10 ever wanted people like you or the public to 11 ever hear about. that is why they had these 12 internal documents. it is only because of 13 various things that happened over the years, 14 litigation and these kind of cases, that we have 15 those documents to show you. otherwise, they would 16 still be secret. 17 and it is -- the idea is, they controlled a 18 business and pursued a business of addiction and 19 death, and that is what this case is about, 20 addiction and death. it is about fannie collar 21 and the fact that she got addicted and got 22 diseases, and unfortunately she is going to die 23 from those diseases. 24 you are hearing -- you got to hear from 25 fannie collar. you got to hear from fannie collar, which is a rare example in an engle 2 case. she is a living victim of these companies' 3 atrocious acts. you got to hear from her, heard 4 from her own lips what she experienced. 5 twenty-five years ago we did not have the 6 evidence we have today that we were able to 7 present you because those were all secret 8 documents, but now they have seen the light of 9 day and you have seen it. hopefully you took it 10 all in and you understand what these tobacco 11 companies are really all about. because what 12 they are all about is greed. 13 we presented a lot of evidence to you, and 14 you know, it took two-and-a-half weeks now, now 15 it is three weeks that you-all are here. we 16 did not know what you needed to hear. there is 17 tons of documents that you did not see. you 18 heard dr. proctor talk about 80 million 19 documents. we certainly could not bring all 20 those in to you. it would take forever to do 21 that. but we brought to you what we thought 22 would enlighten you on what these tobacco 23 companies are all about. 24 what it is all about is simple. it is about 25 replacement smokers and it is about addiction. that is the nature of this company's business. 2 they look for replacement smokers and addiction. 3 that is what it is all about. they attract the 4 youth to get them started, and they keep 5 cigarettes addictive to keep them smoking. 6 that is what this case is about. 7 these are the dirty little secrets of the 8 tobacco companies, secrets that they never 9 thought would see the light of day, but you got 10 to see them in this courtroom. without youth 11 marketing, without nicotine, there would be no 12 smoking, and it would reduce the epidemic that 13 has become rampant in this country as a result 14 of these tobacco companies. without nicotine 15 that is where we would be, and that would be a 16 great thing. 17 so why do they do it? we saw this 18 document. who ain't for more money? that is why 19 they do it. it is all about greed. you know, 20 they talk about the fact that they just -- hey, 21 we just sell cigarettes. you know, we just sell 22 cigarettes. it is just a cigarette. 23 except that we know from their internal 24 documents that cigarette smoke is just a drug. 25 they know that. they are not in the cigarette business. they are in the pharmaceutical 2 business. it is a drug. it is a potent drug. 3 it is an addictive drug. 4 and they have known it forever and yet 5 they have lied about it forever. they claimed 6 that it was not a drug. they claimed it was not 7 addictive. they claimed there was no problems 8 with it for the longest time, for decades. 9 in another document, remember dr. teague, 10 he was a scientist at r.j. reynolds, he says, we 11 deliberately played down the role of nicotine. 12 that is what he said in their documents. their 13 product is nicotine. that is what it is all 14 about. it is not the cigarette. the product is 15 nicotine. 16 the first question you have to answer is, 17 was fannie addicted to nicotine? to answer that 18 question you really do not have to look any 19 further than their own documents. without 20 nicotine, the argument goes, there would be no 21 smoking. this is a document from 1972. no one 22 has ever become a cigarette smoker by smoking 23 cigarettes without nicotine. 24 they say, the cigarette should be conceived 25 not as a product, but as the package. the product is nicotine. the cigarette is but one 2 of many layers. think of the cigarette pack as 3 a storage container for a day's supply of 4 nicotine. and they got fannie to do exactly 5 what they wanted her to do, she was smoking a 6 pack a day, a daily supply of nicotine. 7 the truth is, this industry knows very well 8 beyond any shadow of a doubt that nicotine is 9 the absolute center of their universe. it is 10 their life blood. it is their oxygen, and 11 without it they would die. 12 they even reference that in their own 13 documents. it is all about the nicotine. 14 nicotine is the sine qua non, without which 15 there is nothing. we would all lose our jobs and 16 consulting fees without the chemical compound 17 nicotine. 18 however, we cannot be comfortable selling a 19 product which most of our customers would like 20 to stop using. they recognized that. but 21 without nicotine, we could be out of business 22 almost overnight. they know that. they know 23 that without nicotine they would die. they know 24 that nicotine is important. 25 can we play that? united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 c2df6556-77db-466e-a3f0-f0271ebefe0f 1 (thereupon, the video clip was played and transcribed as 2 follows:) 3 we want to be the detectives just as much 4 as the surgeon general and the ama. we will 5 cooperate in every way. 6 obviously, until they say it is unsafe, tar 7 and nicotine, i do not think the industry admits 8 there are any bad elements. if there are bad 9 elements, through our laboratories, through the 10 surgeon general, through the ama, through acts 11 of god and luck, we hope we may find them, and 12 if they are found, they will be removed. 13 we do talk to the question of whether or 14 not cigarettes are hazardous. we do not believe 15 that cigarettes are hazardous. we do not accept 16 that. because when, as, and if any ingredient 17 in cigarette smoke is identified as being 18 injurious to human health, we are confident that 19 we can eliminate that ingredient. 20 do you believe that cigarettes are safe? 21 have they been proven to be safe, mr. cullman? 22 i believe they have not been proven to be 23 unsafe. 24 (thereupon, the video clip ended.) 25 mr. hammer: what you just saw was howard cullman in 1963 right after the surgeon 2 general's report was released, that first one -- 3 i'm sorry, 1964, and then joseph cullman on face 4 the nation in 1971, both of them told the 5 american public, the entire country, that if 6 there are any bad elements or ingredients, they 7 will be removed. 8 and we know the most harmful ingredient in 9 these things is the nicotine because it is the 10 nicotine that keeps people addicted. it is the 11 nicotine that keeps people smoking. without the 12 nicotine, people would not smoke. they know 13 that. 14 so why not take out the nicotine? we know 15 they can do it. 16 mr. geraghty: your honor, i would object. 17 there is no evidence on that at all. 18 the court: sustained. 19 mr. geraghty: move to strike. 20 the court: it will be stricken. 21 mr. hammer: if they wanted to, they could 22 but they do not. 23 mr. geraghty: your honor, i would object 24 and move to strike. 25 the court: overruled. hammer: you know what, it is never too 2 late to keep a promise. so do it. take out the 3 nicotine and the cigarette would be a hell of a 4 lot safer, but they will not do it. 5 mr. geraghty: your honor, i would object 6 and have a motion -- 7 the court: sustained. 8 mr. hammer: instead of owning up to their 9 promise to remove the dangerous elements, what 10 do they do? they chose profits over public 11 health. 12 dr. leo abood -- we saw this document. 13 remember, dr. leo abood was a scientist who was 14 working to develop an antagonist to nicotine. 15 what that means is something that would block 16 the addictive effect of nicotine. 17 and they realized, in this internal 18 document, philip morris realized, wait a minute, 19 if we do that, we are in the process of digging 20 our own graves. that is incredible. they do not 21 want to dig their own graves, but they have no 22 qualms, no qualms whatsoever about digging the 23 graves of millions of americans. 24 mr. geraghty: your honor, i would object 25 and move to strike. the court: sustained. 2 mr. geraghty: and i have a motion. 3 mr. hammer: dr. niaura, remember, he was 4 our expert witness, he explained to you that he 5 was interested in the diagnosis of nicotine 6 dependence, also known as tobacco dependence, 7 also known as tobacco use disorder. he told you 8 it is a chronic relapsing brain disease. he told 9 you, nicotine addiction, those are the terms 10 that are used in medical records to reflect 11 nicotine addiction. 12 we even had dr. ticknor on the stand for 13 the defense, remember mr. gdanski showed him the 14 codes, and he finally acknowledged, yeah, well, 15 i guess that is for nicotine addiction. we 16 do not have to look any further than fannie's own 17 medical records to see that she was addicted to 18 nicotine, nicotine abuse, cigarette abuse, 19 tobacco use disorder. remember, that is the 20 record that mr. gdanski used with dr. ticknor. 21 all of those things reflect nicotine addiction 22 in her medical records. 23 now, the tobacco companies, the defendants, 24 they admit that smoking cigarettes caused her 25 lung cancer and emphysema, which is a form of copd. so let us be clear about that. they 2 acknowledge that her smoking caused her lung 3 cancer. they acknowledged that her smoking 4 caused her copd. 5 and yet, the defense will have you believe 6 that she smoked enough to cause her copd and 7 lung cancer but not enough to addict her. 8 that is incredible. that makes no sense 9 whatsoever. it defies logic. think about it, 10 if you use a drug in a chronic fashion, use it 11 daily, day in and day out for many years, is not 12 it obvious you are probably addicted? 13 dr. mannino explained that to you. it is 14 obvious that people who have diseases caused by 15 an addictive drug were, in fact, addicted to the 16 drug. and he explained, to me it is, when i see 17 lung cancer or copd that occurs in longtime 18 smokers, it is easy to connect the dots between 19 their addiction and the development of their 20 disease, lung cancer, copd. it is a no-brainer. 21 he is seen that in all of the research he is done. 22 this is fannie collar. fifty years of 23 smoking. fifty years of smoking. to say she is 24 not addicted, that is crazy. that is absolutely 25 absurd. now, we have to prove this case to you by 2 the greater weight of the evidence, which means 3 the more persuasive and convincing force and 4 effect of the entire evidence in the case. 5 in doing so, it is a very simple concept. 6 it is strange because as lawyers we take 7 semesters in law school to learn about the 8 burden of proof in both criminal and civil 9 cases. it is kind of a complicated issue but i 10 want to try to make it as simple as possible for 11 you. 12 the scales, they start out even. before 13 the case starts, they start out even. in a 14 civil case, as opposed to a criminal case where 15 you have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt and 16 tip the scales all the way, it is -- you have to 17 prove the case by a greater weight of the 18 evidence, just tip the scales ever so slightly. 19 now, i think we have done a lot more in this 20 case than that. certainly we have presented to 21 you a lot of evidence to show that fannie is 22 addicted. the defense attorneys, they want to 23 try to raise a doubt in your mind about whether 24 she was addicted, whether her addiction caused 25 her disease, whether she is entitled to money damage. they want to raise doubts in your mind 2 about that. 3 however, this is not a criminal case. 4 doubts do not matter. if you have a doubt, okay. 5 well, the benefit of the doubt goes to the 6 plaintiff. and in these cases we have to tip 7 the scales ever so slightly, just like i showed 8 you the scales. so we have to tip the scales, 9 and i think we have certainly done that, but let us 10 think and look at some of the evidence of 11 addiction. 12 you heard about fannie's smoking patterns. 13 she smoked all the time. she always had a 14 cigarette in her hand. she smoked her first 15 cigarette of the day right after she woke up. 16 she smoked in bed. she would get up in the middle 17 of the night to smoke. she smoked in 18 restaurants, and then stopped going to 19 restaurants when they did not allow smoking 20 anymore. 21 she was a chain smoker. she smoked while 22 cooking, through her pregnancies, she stopped 23 going to the movies. without a cigarette, you 24 heard her say she was jangled, irritable, 25 impatient, anxious, could not sleep. she smoked cigarette butts out of her vacuum. i want to 2 talk about that in a second. 3 she smoked after having her right lung 4 removed. she repeatedly relapsed. she had 5 cravings and she still does. she still has 6 cravings. she had a persistent desire to quit, 7 and they were unsuccessful time and time again. 8 she tried over 100 times to quit. you heard 9 that. 10 she tried rationing cigarettes, cutting 11 down, cold turkey, lady's pipe, all of these 12 things. she tried hypnosis, smoking cessation 13 courses, all of the things dr. ticknor talked 14 about, that is what somebody would do who wanted 15 to quit smoking. 16 she tried the patches. she tried the gum. 17 she tried laser therapy treatments. chantix and 18 wellbutrin, prescription drugs, she was taking 19 prescription drugs to help her stop smoking. 20 those are certainly signs of somebody who wants 21 to try to quit smoking and who is motivated to 22 try to quit smoking. you would not do all these 23 things if you were not motivated. 24 they talk a lot about motivation. they 25 talk a lot about choice. this woman tried to quit. she was too addicted. she kept 2 relapsing. that is the sign of an addict. 3 let us think about that. she told you, i 4 got my vacuum cleaner, because i used to go 5 around and clean out the ashtrays. this was the 6 day she was trying to quit, remember. think 7 about this. think about what it means, imagine 8 seeing one walk over to a dumpster or a garbage 9 can or in fannie's case opening up a dirty 10 vacuum bag. we all know what those vacuum bags 11 contain, they are disgusting. thinks about that. 12 you go through those dirty contents, you 13 find a cigarette, not a whole cigarette, not a 14 whole cigarette, but a butt of a cigarette that 15 had been smoked and stamped out in an ashtray, 16 and you take that butt and you light it up and 17 you smoke it. is that person addicted? is that 18 something -- anything rational? 19 in fact, dr. ticknor said to you, when 20 mr. gdanski asked him about, what about that 21 vacuum cleaner incident, he said, well, that was 22 out of character for her. yeah, it was out of 23 character because she was addicted. that is what 24 addicted people do. they do things that 25 reasonable people would not do. what reasonable person would do such a thing? it is disgusting. 2 she told you, i'm ashamed of it. 3 the defense would have you believe fannie 4 enjoyed that butt of a cigarette, right? she is 5 sitting on the floor, going through this dust, 6 she lights up the cigarette, and she enjoyed 7 that cigarette? that must have really tasted 8 good, right? come on, folks, that is a sign of 9 addiction. if that is not, then what is? 10 dr. ticknor just blows that off. tobacco 11 companies would like you to think that is -- 12 fannie chose to do that. that was her own 13 choice. she could have not done it. yeah, she 14 could have not done it, except their addiction 15 drove her to do that. it was not her choice. 16 the tobacco companies talk a lot about 17 choice. the choice of the defendants to market 18 cigarettes known to be both addictive and cancer 19 causing raises the question of fault. you are 20 going to be asked about fault in this case. 21 that should be reserved for the section on 22 fault, when you determine the percentages of 23 fault. 24 when it comes to determining the percentage 25 of fault about the tobacco companies, what they knew about their product, what they did not tell 2 the public, that is important in answering that 3 question. 4 by the same token, the choice of a child, 5 fannie collar at age 12 to start smoking, that 6 also raises a question of fault. those choices, 7 the choices she made throughout her life, maybe 8 she could have tried harder, things of that 9 sort, that also goes to the level of fault. but 10 you should not decide how much either side is at 11 fault when determining whether or not fannie was 12 addicted. you need to keep that out of your 13 decision-making process when you are thinking 14 about addiction. 15 mr. geraghty: your honor, misstates your 16 honor's instructions. 17 the court: sustained. 18 mr. geraghty: i would move to strike. 19 the court: it will be stricken. 20 mr. hammer: why am i even talking to you 21 about choice when i'm talking to you about the 22 evidence of addiction? i'll tell you why, 23 because the tobacco companies, they want to 24 pretend that fannie was not addicted. but if you 25 think she was addicted, then they want a fallback position. if she was addicted -- 2 mr. geraghty: i would object to the 3 characterization of the positions. 4 the court: overruled. 5 mr. hammer: judge, this is argument. 6 thank you. 7 if she was addicted, then it was her 8 choice. it was her choice to continue smoking 9 long enough to get sick. therefore, it was her 10 choice and not her addiction that caused her 11 copd and lung cancer, that is what the tobacco 12 companies want you to believe. 13 but you know what, not one piece of 14 evidence was presented to you by either side 15 that fannie collar's addiction was her choice. 16 you know why, folks, because nobody chooses 17 addiction. it is simple as that. 18 addiction is often a terrible side effect 19 of the choice to smoke. just like the addiction 20 some people get from prescription pain 21 medications. no one chooses that addiction 22 either, but it frequently happens as an 23 unintended consequence of the use of the drug. 24 lawful but dangerous drugs often have side 25 effects, like addiction. that is why ordinary people say, be careful. when you are taking 2 those pain medications, when you are taking any 3 medication, be careful, you might get hooked. 4 that is the warning people give. 5 why do people say that? i'll tell you why, 6 because addiction is just like a fish getting 7 hooked. the fish chooses to strike the bait, 8 then gets caught by the hidden hook. the hook 9 starts pulling the fish along and the fish 10 starts fighting the hook. some fish who are 11 hooked just through the side, through the lip, 12 they wiggle away and they get off the hook. 13 fish that are hooked through the gills, 14 they are hooked. they are hooked deep. and 15 they are addicted. they become hooked and 16 they are goners, and the fishermen know that. 17 the fishermen know that that is why you use bait 18 on the hook in the first place. no fisherman 19 would ever tell you that the fish was hooked 20 because he chose to get caught. the fish died 21 because he did not see the hook in the first 22 place. 23 fannie collar, when she was 12 years old, 24 she certainly did not see that hook. she went 25 out in blueberry fields with her friend to smoke that pack of cigarettes. you heard that story. 2 do you think at 12 years old she ever thought 3 she would get hooked on tobacco? of course not. 4 she did not see the hook. 5 the tobacco companies, they did not tell 6 their customers that they thought cigarette were 7 addictive until seven years after fannie was 8 diagnosed with her lung cancer and copd, the 9 year 2000. instead, for decades they repeatedly 10 told everyone that there was a substantial 11 scientific controversy about whether cigarettes 12 were harmful and about whether they could get 13 you hooked. 14 now, there were no labels on cigarette 15 packs until 1966. that was not even a warning. 16 it was a caution. by that time, 1966, fannie 17 was 32 years old. she would been addicted to 18 smoking for years and years. she was hooked. 19 she was hooked bad. she tried to get away, but 20 she did not. being hooked eventually led to her 21 strapped to oxygen. it eventually led to her 22 getting her lung removed, lung cancer, copd. 23 now, the tobacco companies want to tell you 24 being hooked had nothing to do with fannie 25 collar's lung cancer and copd. that is a real fish story. fannie chose to smoke at a time 2 when no one knew the real dangers of addiction 3 and disease that are inherent in these things. 4 nobody knew about that. 5 she started as a 12-year-old little girl in 6 an era when the advertising in the movies never 7 mentioned addiction, never mentioned the harms. 8 they never discussed diseases like copd, 9 emphysema, lung cancer. she would been smoking for 10 about 20 years before the cigarette packs even 11 said, caution, it might be dangerous. it might 12 be hazardous to your health, but it might not 13 be. in that amount of time that hook sets deep, 14 very deep. 15 fannie collar was pulled along by that hook 16 for more than 40 years. folks, she tried to get 17 away. she tried to fight it, but she did not get 18 off. maybe some of you think she should have 19 tried harder, and that is fair, but that is 20 fault. it is not class membership or addiction. 21 right now the defendants want you to 22 believe that fannie was never hooked. if you 23 will not believe that, they want you to believe 24 that being hooked did not contribute to causing 25 her injuries in any way. common sense tells you that is nonsense. 2 the reason we all worry about getting 3 hooked is because addiction starts pulling you 4 along, and it is hard to get away. if you do not 5 get away, you get a horrible disease like copd 6 and lung cancer. that is what happened to 7 fannie. she did not get away in time, and at 8 least one important reason was her addiction to 9 nicotine in cigarettes. that addiction was a 10 big factor in why she did not get away. 11 they ought to know, they are the ones who 12 put the hook right in. the defendants put the 13 hook in cigarettes. they learned that. they 14 keep the customers hooked because that is the 15 name of their business. they keep it that way 16 so that people keep buying more cigarettes. 17 they know that. they want that. 18 they keep nicotine in their products to 19 keep doing that, to keep people hooked, just 20 like they hooked fannie collar all the way to 21 the end. that is the name of their business. 22 nobody chooses addiction. fannie certainly 23 did not choose to be a drug addict. nobody 24 chooses that. 25 the sad thing is the tobacco companies knew that smoking was something that most people 2 would like to stop. they knew that smoking was 3 something that people cannot break. they 4 characterized that situation as fortunate for us 5 the cigarettes are a habit they cannot break. 6 they knew it. they knew it. fortunate for the 7 companies. how unfortunate for the victims. 8 how unfortunate for fannie. 9 throughout the years they acknowledged that 10 nicotine is the center of their universe. they 11 acknowledge nicotine is addictive, and that they 12 were in the business of selling nicotine, an 13 addictive drug. that in designing cigarettes, 14 the dominant spec should be nicotine delivery. 15 that nicotine is a potent drug and the industry 16 is based upon the design, manufacture, and sale 17 of attractive forms of nicotine. 18 and they compare their customers to a rat. 19 compare their customers to a rat, in a cage, 20 pushing a leaver, that is how they talk about 21 their customers. that is what they think about 22 their drug addicts. do they care? of course 23 not. 24 the judge is going to read to you a legal 25 cause instruction. and she read to you and it is going to be in your packet. she told you, 2 addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine was 3 a legal cause of plaintiff's lung cancer and/or 4 copd if it directly and in a natural and 5 continuous sequence produced or contributed 6 substantially to producing such lung cancer 7 and/or copd so that it can be said but for the 8 addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine, the 9 lung cancer and copd would not have occurred. 10 but what is missing on this slide? choice. 11 you are not going to see the word "choice" on the 12 jury instructions. you will not see the word 13 "choice" on the verdict form. that is not on 14 there. you also will not see the question about 15 what she knew when it comes to addiction. it 16 is not what she knew. it is what happened because 17 of her addiction, and because of these company's 18 lies to sustain that addiction. 19 these tobacco companies told each other, we 20 must give smokers a psychological crutch and a 21 self-rationale for them to continue smoking. 22 that is exactly what they did to fannie. 23 so we talked about the legal cause 24 instruction. you see these words. it says a 25 legal cause. not the legal cause, a legal cause. contribute substantially basically 2 means, did the addiction play an important role? 3 but for the addiction essentially means if she 4 was not addicted to nicotine, would she have 5 smoked one or more packs per day for more than 6 40 years and developed lung cancer and copd? 7 that is basically the legal language broken down 8 as simple as possible. 9 what did dr. ticknor tell you? their own 10 defense expert, he came in and he was asked by 11 mr. gdanski, you also agree that if there was no 12 nicotine in cigarettes, most likely fannie 13 collar would not have smoked as many cigarettes 14 as she did, true? 15 fair. 16 is that true? 17 i believe that is true. 18 is not it true, sir, at the end of the day 19 you agree nicotine is a primary reason that 20 fannie collar smoked cigarettes? 21 yes. 22 he acknowledged it. 23 keep in mind, class membership is a 24 threshold question. the engle decision is all 25 inclusive. the judge read to you, all floridians who meet that criteria who were 2 smokers who became addicted and got disease. 3 nicotine addiction had to play an important 4 role in getting to where fannie is today. 5 remember, there is no dispute that smoking 6 cigarettes got her sick. fannie collar was 7 addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes. there 8 should be no question in your mind. 9 smoking cigarettes was a legal cause of 10 fannie collar's lung cancer or copd, that is been 11 acknowledged. addiction to the nicotine in 12 cigarettes was a legal cause of fannie collar's 13 lung cancer or copd. it is just a natural 14 sequence of events. 15 dr. niaura told you, nicotine addition is 16 the fundamental reason individuals persist in 17 using tobacco products, and this persistent 18 tobacco use contributes to many diseases. he 19 was asked, is nicotine addiction a fundamental 20 reason smokers continue to smoke? he said, yes, 21 people would not smoke or use tobacco products 22 unless there was nicotine in them. 23 think about this, 200 hits of nicotine a 24 day. that is what is contained in a pack of 25 cigarettes, the daily dose of nicotine. the daily dose of nicotine that fannie collar was 2 smoking day in and day out, 200 hits. if 3 someone took 200 hits of any other drug every 4 day, would there be any doubt in anyone's mind 5 that that person was addicted? of course not. 6 we talked about the surgeon general's 7 reports, and we made reference to them 8 throughout this case. the surgeon general's 9 reports lay out the most current, up-to-date 10 scientific evidence on nicotine addiction and 11 smoking-induced diseases. it is evidence that is 12 been researched at the highest levels of the 13 government. 14 dr. niaura, remember, he is the guy that 15 wrote in this book the chapter on nicotine 16 addiction. what did the defense do with 17 dr. niaura? they said, well, doctor, you are not 18 doing clinical work. is that enough to say to 19 the surgeon general, oh, wait, we cannot use your 20 writings? no, of course not. 21 he is one of the leading men on nicotine 22 research, nicotine addiction. he wrote the 23 chapter for the surgeon general. it does not get 24 higher than that. he told you that nicotine 25 addiction is the fundamental reason smokers continue to smoke. 2 dr. mannino, who we called, remember he 3 drew this out for you on the chart. we put it 4 on the slide here. he drew out this flow chart 5 to show you how addiction causes disease. 6 the point is that the originating element 7 is nicotine addiction, which causes tobacco 8 smoke intake, which causes the damage to the 9 cells, which causes lung cancer and copd. he 10 explained that to you. he took it to you. he 11 walked you right through it. it is common sense. 12 this industry, this tobacco industry, they 13 can abolish the chain of people who have been 14 smoking cigarettes by removing nicotine. [#deleted objection dialogue#] 23 mr. hammer: thank you, judge. 24 you heard evidence in this case from 25 dr. proctor. the rise in lung cancer was directly related to the cigarettes. that is how 2 those studies were made. that is how dr. wynder 3 and all of the scientific research that was out 4 there, they came to that conclusion, cigarettes 5 caused cancer. 6 why? because before the cigarettes like 7 these, there was no lung cancer. they created 8 it. it is a manmade epidemic, manmade by these 9 tobacco companies. when people use tobacco 10 products over long periods of time, they develop 11 tobacco-related, smoking-related illnesses, they 12 all go together. had she never been addicted to 13 nicotine, would she have developed lung cancer 14 or emphysema? probably not. most likely not. 15 that is what we have to prove to you in this 16 case, probably, more likely than not. 17 we brought in world class experts. 18 dr. niaura wrote the book on nicotine addiction 19 for the surgeon general, a chapter. he wrote a 20 book, a handbook that psychiatrists use. he 21 wrote the book. 22 we brought in dr. proctor. he wrote the 23 golden holocaust, which is a study of the 24 tobacco industry internal documents, and we 25 brought him to you. and he was a writer of the -- the editor of the surgeon general's 2014. 2 and dr. mannino wrote the chapter on copd for 3 the surgeon general. 4 we brought to you world-renowned experts. 5 they have written hundreds of articles, 6 peer-reviewed research, written articles for the 7 surgeon general, go around lecturing around the 8 world about their knowledge. they are world 9 class experts. 10 they brought in to you dr. ticknor, who is 11 a psychiatrist who practices. but what did he 12 tell you? he told you he is never written 13 anything. he is never done any research. he is 14 got no credentials, other than the fact that 15 he is a psychiatrist and treats people. most of 16 his practice is not nicotine addiction. it is 17 entirely different. 18 they bring him in because he is the team 19 psychiatrist for the san antonio spurs. that is 20 great. what did he tell you about nicotine 21 addiction? they brought him in to raise some 22 doubt in your mind. that is why they brought him 23 in. doubt does not count in this case. 24 then, when he was confronted with the nida 25 definition -- so he said the apa, the american psychiatric association, which he is a proud 2 member of, and nida, they defined addiction a 3 certain way. and mr. gdanski asked him, is not 4 it true that you agree that fannie collar, her 5 use of cigarettes caused chronic brain changes? 6 that is part of the definition. 7 it is not true, dr. ticknor, that fannie 8 collar had compulsive use of cigarettes? part 9 of the definition. is not it true, dr. ticknor, 10 that she smoked despite horrible consequences? 11 part of the definition recognized by the 12 american psychiatric association and by nida. 13 and he says, well, doctor, is not it true that 14 fannie by that definition was addicted? he 15 says, no. how is that possible? how is that 16 credible? 17 then he talks about -- remember that 18 rainbow that he made, that rainbow spectrum that 19 he made? he is talking about -- first of all, 20 talking about his testimony. he is testified in 21 about a dozen cases. now, mr. gdanski, here is 22 the collar case, so that is -- he counts through, 23 one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, 24 nine, ten, eleven, including the collar case. 25 he clearly told the jury once again that that smoker is not addicted to nicotine. 2 that is what he does. the tobacco companies 3 went and found him, taught him how to be an 4 expert witness, and they bring him in. not 5 because of his writings, not because of his 6 research, not because of his scholar, but 7 because they trained him how to be an expert 8 witness. 9 they put this rainbow up and you put -- you 10 do not put fannie anywhere on the rainbow? she is 11 not even on the spectrum? that is correct. you 12 know, at least if he put her under mild or 13 moderate, you could say, okay, well, maybe 14 that is reasonable. at least he is being 15 reasonable. but to not even put her on the 16 spectrum of tobacco dependence, that is absurd. 17 that is absurd. 18 the judge read to you the believability of 19 witnesses. the most important part of this 20 section is reject it. you have the power to 21 reject the testimony of an expert. i say he is 22 not worthy of believing. he just is not. 23 nothing but doubt. that is what he tried to cast 24 on you. 25 let us take a look at the verdict form. was fannie collar addicted to cigarettes containing 2 nicotine, and if so, was her addiction a legal 3 cause of her lung cancer or copd? 4 remember, class membership is not about 5 fault. we are asking you to confirm that fannie 6 collar is obviously a member of the engle class. 7 it should be very, very simple to answer that 8 question. folks, if fannie is not a member of 9 that class, then who is? who is? 10 class membership is not about fault. keep 11 that concept in front of your mind as you listen 12 to the defense attorney's arguments. when 13 you are answering question 1, do not get hung up 14 with their arguments that fannie might have been 15 at fault for not trying to quit. 16 on the verdict form there is a question 17 about class membership and then there is -- 18 further down there is a question about fault. 19 two separate issues. please keep those issues 20 separate in your mind as you decide class 21 membership. because you could find that she is 22 a class member even if you think she should have 23 tried harder to quit, because the question is, 24 was she addicted, and did her addiction cause 25 her disease? it is not about the fault of either party. 2 it is not about whether the smoker shares some 3 responsibility. it is not about whether the 4 addict loses total control. it is not whether 5 addicts can quit. and it is not even about 6 reliance on tobacco company statements. that is 7 not part of the class membership. that comes in 8 later, too. 9 these tobacco companies, they want you to 10 focus all eyes on fannie. so do we, but we also 11 want you to look at their behavior throughout 12 this case. they are using millions of pounds of 13 menthol and licorice, theobromine, ammonia in 14 their cigarettes, additives. their cigarettes 15 are full of poisons and carcinogens like arsenic 16 and cyanide and radioactive plutonium. 17 they say she should have quit smoking. 18 they should have quit, too. they should have 19 quit lying. 20 mr. geraghty: your honor, i would object 21 for the reasons discussed earlier. 22 the court: sustained. 23 mr. hammer: judge, can we approach? 24 the court: yes. 25 (thereupon, the following bench conference began.) hammer: judge, this case is all about 2 the tobacco companies lying. 3 the court: they should have quit, too? 4 mr. hammer: they should have quit, too. 5 they should have quit lying. 6 the court: you did not say that. 7 mr. hammer: that is what i just said. 8 the court: they should have quit, too. 9 mr. geraghty: the implication was they 10 should have quit making cigarettes. 11 mr. hammer: no. they should have quit 12 lying. 13 the court: you did not say that. 14 mr. hammer: well, that is exactly what i 15 said. they may not have picked it up. that is 16 exactly what i said. 17 the court: all i heard was, you said it 18 after they should have quit -- 19 mr. hammer: right. they should have quit, 20 too. they should have quit lying. that is a 21 totally appropriate argument. 22 mr. geraghty: your honor instructed the 23 jury that manufacturing and selling cigarettes 24 were lawful activities. they cannot tell us we 25 should stop making cigarettes. it is the third or fourth time he is implied that. 2 the court: all i heard was, she should 3 have quit. they should have quit, too. and 4 then you objected, and he said, they should have 5 quit lying. 6 mr. geraghty: he said that here. 7 mr. hammer: no, that is not what i said 8 here. the record reflects what i said. 9 the court: so after he objected, i 10 sustained. 11 mr. geraghty: all right. well, your 12 honor, he cannot continue to make arguments that 13 we should stop making cigarettes. that is 14 contrary to your honor's instruction. 15 the court: he did not. 16 mr. geraghty: that was the implication. 17 there was a pregnant pause and he waited. 18 mr. hammer: that is clear. can i please 19 continue? 20 the court: yes, it does say that -- 21 22 mr. hammer: may i proceed? 23 the court: you may. 24 mr. hammer: may it please the court. 25 yeah, they should have quit. they should have quit lying. but lying is their life blood. 2 they say she should have quit smoking in 3 the 1950s. remember that whole thing they were 4 talking about, well, in the '50s when your 5 foster father died and the co-worker's wife 6 died, you should have quit. what did she know 7 then? what did she really know about smoking, 8 cancer, and copd? copd was not even a word back 9 then. what did she know? 10 what if they had stopped lying in the 11 1950s? what if they would have stopped lying in 12 the 1950s and said, cigarettes do cause cancer? 13 that would have had an effect on her, do not you 14 think? 15 they say she should have quit when her 16 husband mert preached to her about smoking. of 17 course at the time he was smoking three packs a 18 day. he was smoking three packs a day, and they 19 want you to believe that every day he was 20 preaching to her, you got to quit, as he is 21 sucking down three packs a day. how absurd is 22 that? but she should have quit, she was warned. 23 they say she should have quit in the 1960s. 24 when the first surgeon general's report came out 25 and when the caution label went on the cigarette packs, and her father-in-law showed her the 2 warning on the side of the packs, she should 3 have quit. 4 what did she tell us? she was smoking 5 filters. he was smoking camels, unfilters. she 6 thought she was safe. why did she think she was 7 safe? because of the lies they told her. she 8 believed it. what if they would have told the 9 truth in the 1960s instead of going on tv like 10 we saw howard cullman do earlier and say, if 11 there is any bad elements, we will remove them. 12 why? think if he would have gone on tv and 13 said, you know, that surgeon general, he is the 14 doctor of the united states, he is saying it 15 causes cancer and we agree. so ladies and 16 gentlemen, stop smoking. until we can do 17 further research and tell you it is safe, stop 18 smoking. think about that impact. think about 19 that impact. 20 their mantra is choice, choice, choice. 21 they say she smoked herself sick. it serves her 22 right. they blame the victim and absolve the 23 perpetrator. 24 mr. geraghty: your honor, i would object. 25 the court: sustained. geraghty: i object and move to strike. 2 the court: it will be stricken. you may 3 proceed. 4 mr. hammer: we do not live in a society 5 that absolves the corporations of the 6 responsibility for their products. if you are 7 going to make a product, then you make it safe. 8 that is the american way. 9 in this country corporations are held 10 responsible for the products they make. that is 11 what we are asking you to do in this courtroom. 12 they are making a product. hold them responsible 13 for it. do the right thing. 14 mr. geraghty: this misstates your honor's 15 instructions. 16 mr. hammer: the defense likes to use terms 17 such as "choice" and "decision" when they talk 18 about fannie. what about the tobacco industry? 19 what about their choices and their decisions? 20 they say that fannie smoked despite the risk. 21 but they made the decision to form this 22 enterprise of lies and deceit in 1953. there 23 was a lie about a deadly and addictive product 24 despite the risks to the public. those risks 25 were massive. we have seen the total of those risks. the 2 people in charge of these tobacco companies 3 throughout the years, they made decisions, they 4 made choices between the physical health of 5 their customers and their own financial 6 well-being. there is nothing wrong with making 7 money if you are a corporation. but if you are 8 going to do it, do it the right way. 9 do not kill people. they chose concealment 10 over disclosure. they chose sales over safety. 11 they chose money over morality. they knew that 12 people smoked for nicotine and that smoking 13 kills. knowing that, what did they choose to 14 do? they chose to manipulate the nicotine in 15 cigarettes to make them more addictive. 16 mr. geraghty: your honor, there is no 17 evidence. 18 the court: sustained. 19 mr. geraghty: move to strike. 20 the court: it will be stricken. 21 mr. hammer: if they would been honest, they 22 had all these scientists working in their 23 facilities, working in their labs, you saw these 24 memos written by them internally, just imagine 25 if those scientists -- because they were really good scientists, very smart people, imagine if 2 they devoted their life to curing cancer instead 3 of hiding the truth. imagine that. imagine 4 how different this world would have been if 5 they would told the truth, told smokers the truth. 6 that is all we are asking. 7 you are going to have to determine fault in 8 this case. you are also going to have to 9 determine responsibility, the percentage to 10 apply. here is the verdict. so on question 1, 11 was fannie addicted to cigarettes containing 12 nicotine, and if so, was her addiction a legal 13 cause of her lung cancer and copd? 14 of course. we ask you to check that box 15 off on the verdict form. this is basically the 16 form you are going to be dealing with. check 17 that box off yes and let us move on to the rest 18 of the verdict form. 19 the next question you are going to be asked 20 about is fault, the percentage of fault of r.j. 21 reynolds, philip morris, and of fannie. now, 22 fannie, quite frankly, she told you, she does not 23 see herself having any fault based on what she 24 knew compared to what they knew. i want to talk 25 about that. as a class member, all of the engle 2 findings apply to fannie collar. the judge read 3 to you the engle findings -- 4 mr. geraghty: your honor, this is not the 5 instruction your honor gave. 6 the court: sustained. 7 mr. geraghty: neither is that page, your 8 honor. 9 mr. hammer: wait a minute. all right. 10 i'll move on. you guys have the engle findings. 11 i do not need to read them to you. we will talk 12 about those. 13 everything you need to know about this case 14 about fault is right here. the frank statement 15 in 1954, these companies, except for liggett, 16 they did not sign on to the frank statement in 17 1954, but they joined the tobacco institute 18 years later. remember the tobacco institute? 19 they were the spokespeople for the entire 20 tobacco industry. 21 so when the judge read to you this thing 22 about the organizations, that includes the 23 tobacco institute. it includes the tirc, the 24 ctr, all of the spokespeople for tobacco spoke 25 on behalf of philip morris, r.j. reynolds, and liggett. they were their mouthpiece basically. 2 in 1954 they took out that full page ad in 3 450 newspapers across the country, a frank 4 statement to smokers, the truth about cigarette 5 smokers. that is what they wanted to do. and 6 what they said is, we accept an interest in 7 people's health as a basic responsibility. 8 in 1954 they told the public and they told 9 people like fannie, we accept the 10 responsibility. so all we are asking you to do 11 today in this courtroom is hold them to that 12 responsibility that they accepted back in 1954 13 and continued to accept throughout the years. 14 now, knowledge of harm, and smoking despite 15 that knowledge, like fannie did, that is actually 16 a sign of addiction. what she knew can be 17 relevant evidence to you. you can use it to 18 decide if she was at fault. 19 we argue that her fault is excised or 20 lessened by her addiction. what do i mean by 21 that? meaning i said to you fault does not 22 matter for addiction. however, addiction can 23 certainly matter for fault. because of her 24 addiction, how can you hold her to be at fault? 25 she was addicted, and she was addicted by these companies. if it was not for the nicotine in 2 cigarettes, she would not have become addicted. 3 she would not have smoked the number of 4 cigarettes she smoked. she would not have 5 gotten lung cancer and copd and be strapped to 6 an oxygen tank. 7 the tobacco industry from 1940 to 2004, 8 $250 billion. think about this. the tobacco 9 industry, dr. proctor told you this, spent more 10 on advertising in one day, in one day, than the 11 national clearinghouse on smoking, which was the 12 health organization putting out the message 13 do not smoke spent in an entire year. in one 14 year that the public health community spent, the 15 tobacco companies spent in one day. they 16 drowned out the message. they drowned out the 17 message. advertising drowned out all of the 18 other messages that were out there. the surgeon 19 general, they had no chance against this. of 20 course it drowns out the message. 21 marlboro cigarettes, remember we saw this 22 video. i want to show you -- 23 (thereupon, the video clip was played as follows:) 24 speaker: combined sales reached 25 105 billion in 1972 making marlboro the best selling cigarette in the world. it has remained 2 the leader ever since. marlboro is far and away 3 the leader in the cigarette industry, and the 4 trend is continually upward. in 1990 marlboro 5 sold more than 344 billion cigarettes worldwide, 6 making it the most widely packaged consumer 7 goods product in the world. 8 (thereupon, the video clip was concluded.) 9 mr. hammer: more packages of this sold 10 than any other consumer product in the history 11 of the world. that is incredible. in the 12 history of the world. 13 they brag about their success. 14 who was in control. who was really in 15 control of this cigarette? was fannie collar in 16 control of this or were those tobacco companies? 17 who was in control? in their own documents 18 nicotine should be delivered at about 1 to 19 1.3 milligrams per cigarette minimum for 20 confirmed smokers. they knew exactly what they 21 were doing. they knew exactly what they were 22 doing. they controlled every aspect of the 23 cigarette. they manipulated it for 24 inhalability, micro adjusted the nicotine 25 levels, ammoniation to increase the freebased nicotine, glucurone sugars controlling ph 2 levels, adding menthol, adding licorice, all to 3 control the cigarette. what chance did fannie 4 have? 5 remember what dr. proctor told you about 6 inhalability. do cigarettes have chemicals 7 added to them? yes. but also tragically and 8 ironically, the harms of cigarettes, even though 9 they are becoming milder, they were more likely 10 to have been inhaled. it was the inhalation 11 that caused most of the harm. they spent tens 12 of billions of dollars, tens of billions of 13 dollars to design this thing. 14 this is not just some tobacco rolled up in 15 paper. tens of billions of dollars to design 16 this perfect delivery device. 17 what chance did fannie have? 18 let us take a look at the ads. i'm sorry, 19 before we do that -- who controls the amount of 20 ammonia in the marlboro cigarette? that is the 21 manufacturer. they control every aspect of this 22 cigarette. let us take a look at some of the 23 ads. we saw these. 24 (thereupon, the video clip was played and transcribed as 25 follows:) speaker: what cigarette do you smoke? 2 you will be interested to know how the doctors of 3 america answered that question. doctors in 4 every branch of medicine were asked, what 5 cigarettes do you smoke. 6 when you change to philip morris, you will 7 feel better. 8 do not miss the bus, smoking bus, miss the 9 bus, smoking bus. 10 do you inhale? then you are better off 11 smoking philip morris, and here is how you can 12 prove it. 13 let us take a winston break. that is it. 14 winston is the one filtered cigarette that 15 delivers flavor 20 times a pack. winston has 16 got that filter flavor. 17 (thereupon, the video clip concluded.) 18 mr. hammer: we saw these commercials. we 19 do not have to keep watching them. they made it 20 look like fun. they made funny jokes about it. 21 they do not say that filters are phony and fake. 22 they do not say that this product is addictive 23 and will kill you. they do not say it is going to 24 make you end up in a wheelchair strapped to an 25 oxygen tank later in life. they make it fun. they make it enjoyable. that is the image they 2 portrayed, and people bought into it. so did 3 fannie collar. 4 if there are any truth in advertising, they 5 would say those things. they would say, hey, 6 smoking gives you cancer, so quit smoking. 7 smoking gives you copd, so quit smoking. 8 smoking is going to kill you, so quit smoking. 9 smoking is addictive, so let us help you break 10 the habit. 11 if there was any truth. 12 they do not do that. 13 the defendants, i'm sure you heard it 14 throughout the course of the trial, they talk 15 about the warning labels. well, these cigarette 16 packs, they had warning labels so fannie should 17 have known. the public was warned. the public 18 should have known better. they tell you there is 19 warning labels on every pack, and fannie must 20 have seen them. so therefore, they should be 21 absolved of any wrongdoing, right? it is like 22 their get out of jail free card, free pass. it 23 allows them to kill millions of people. 24 mr. geraghty: your honor, i would object 25 and move to strike that last comment. the court: sustained. 2 mr. geraghty: motion, your honor. 3 the court: sustained. 4 mr. hammer: sure, their packs have warning 5 labels on them. they were obligated to put them 6 on under the law. but these companies also had 7 an obligation not to lie. they were obligated 8 to put the labels on, and they were obligated 9 not to lie. if you are going to make a product, 10 do not lie about it. 11 an addict needs a straightforward message, 12 not a mixed message. the mixed message is the 13 warnings tell you one thing on the pack and the 14 industry telling that same addict, it is okay, go 15 ahead and smoke. the filter will take out 16 anything bad. do not worry about it. if it is 17 proven it is bad, we will stop making it. what 18 kind of mixed message is that to an addict? 19 the court: it is been one hour. 20 mr. hammer: thank you. 21 let us think about that. think about this 22 for a second. imagine this, you see a child 23 walking to the end of the diving board above an 24 empty pool. there is a no diving sign. but the 25 kid did not see it. you walk right past the sign, and he is about to dive into an empty pool. 2 what do you do? what would any reasonable 3 person do? they would stand on the side of the pool 4 and yell to that kid, wait, do not jump in, 5 whatever they could to keep him from doing harm 6 to himself, right? 7 you do not say, well, there is a sign there, 8 so if he falls in, oh, well, that is his fault. 9 he did not see the sign. he did not pay attention 10 to the sign. it is his fault. of course not. 11 warning labels, yeah, they were on there. 12 caution label, '70s, 1985. twenty years after 13 fannie started smoking. twenty-four years and 14 39 years after fannie started smoking. she was 15 hooked by then. she was hooked by then. 16 what are these warning labels telling her? 17 what did she tell you? she told you, i did not 18 really look at the warning labels. i do not look 19 at a box of cocoa every time i make myself a cup 20 of cocoa. 21 let us talk about the obvious. everybody 22 knows what a dollar bill looks like. we touch 23 it every single day of our lives many, many 24 times a day. at least 20 times a day probably 25 we touch a dollar bill. we see it, hold it in your hand every single day. it is in your 2 pocket. does anyone really know what is on the 3 back of a one dollar bill? 4 they bring in signs with the warning labels 5 on it blown up big, huge. we bring you in the 6 cigarette pack that shows the actual warning 7 labels. they do not want to show their logos and 8 the warning labels. they are not proud of it. 9 they are not even proud of their industry enough 10 to show it to you. they hide. they hide in 11 plain site. that is what they do. 12 even though they were required by law to 13 put the warning labels on, they use these 14 warning labels as a defense to say that fannie 15 should have known and, therefore, she should 16 have quit. but meeting the legal minimum does 17 not supplant the moral maximus. think about 18 that. 19 who controlled their business choices? who 20 controlled the level of nicotine? who 21 controlled the manipulation? who controlled the 22 addictive nature? who was responsible for the 23 conduct of the tobacco companies? the tobacco 24 companies. they are responsible for putting 25 fannie in this shape. the industry was not motivated to put lives 2 and health of customers above profit. instead, 3 the industry continued to make choices which had 4 health consequences. 5 what chance did fannie have? what chance 6 did she have? their business model should be, 7 cure, do not cause. 8 we talked about the fact that they are a 9 corporation. you may not discriminate between 10 corporations and individuals. i agree. if 11 you are going to be a corporation and you want to 12 be treated as a person, act like a person. act 13 like a person. 14 you know, we learned everything we ever 15 needed to know in kindergarten. robert fulton 16 wrote a book about it. how do you behave to 17 other people? be decent, be nice, be 18 responsible. do not hurt the other guy. you 19 want to be treated like a person, then do the 20 right thing. do not do it because it is all about 21 money. 22 the tobacco companies and their executives, 23 they celebrated their wins. they celebrated the 24 money they made. that is all they cared about. 25 they put money ahead of lives. they turned a blind eye to the suffering of people like fannie 2 collar. they did not care. they did not give one 3 thought about fannie collar or the millions of 4 americans whose lives they destroyed. 5 mr. geraghty: your honor, i would object 6 and move to strike that last comment. 7 the court: overruled. 8 mr. hammer: they did not care about fannie. 9 so when it comes down to the verdict form, we 10 already talked about question number 1. when 11 you go down to decide the fault, i would suggest 12 to you -- that is what i would suggest to you: 13 these tobacco companies, they are to blame. how 14 can you fault fannie collar as a 12-year-old 15 little girl sitting there in a blueberry field 16 smoking and continuing to smoke when all they 17 did was lie to her the entire time she smoked? 18 you know, if you think, well, maybe fannie 19 should be held to blame, then you ought to give 20 her very, very little fault in comparison to 21 these tobacco companies. certainly maybe 5 or 22 ten percent at the most. but i would suggest to 23 you, how do you hold her to blame, based on what 24 she knew compared to what they knew? 25 now, these are the engle findings. i particularly want to focus on 5 and 6 here. 2 philip morris and r.j. reynolds, they 3 concealed or omitted material information 4 knowing that material information was false and 5 misleading. and they agreed, all three 6 defendants, philip morris, liggett and r.j. 7 reynolds, they agreed with the other companies 8 and the industry organizations, ti, tirc, ctr, 9 to conceal or omit information regarding the 10 health with the intention that smokers and the 11 public would rely on this information to their 12 detriment. 13 that is what they counted on. 14 although fannie may not have attributed any 15 particular statement to r.j. reynolds or liggett 16 or philip morris, what did she tell you? she 17 repeatedly heard the tobacco industry in general 18 talk about smoking, talking about the fact that 19 filters are safe, talking about the fact that if 20 they are dangerous, we will stop making them, 21 talking about the fact that smoke filters, it 22 takes out the bad stuff. she heard that 23 repeatedly, not just once. 24 mr. belasic: objection. misstates the 25 evidence, your honor. the court: overruled. 2 mr. hammer: she heard that repeatedly 3 throughout the years. she told you that. 4 what chance did fannie collar have against 5 these tobacco companies since they all agreed? 6 and what did dr. proctor tell you, the 7 tobacco institute spoke for all of the 8 defendants. philip morris was a paid member 9 r.j. was a paid member. liggett was a paid 10 member on and off. and the tobacco institute 11 would go on tv and speak for the companies very 12 often. not just one time, very often. we saw 13 examples of that. there is no doubt they 14 concealed information. 15 this is the verdict form you are going to 16 get. there is no doubt they concealed 17 information. there is no doubt they entered into 18 an agreement to conceal it. the findings, which 19 are binding upon all of us, make it clear that 20 they did so with the intention that smokers like 21 fannie collar and members of the public would 22 rely on it. these issues are not in dispute. 23 the horror is they knew it was affecting 24 people. that is the horror. they knew they were 25 lying and they knew people were trusting them and they knew people were dying from their lies 2 and they kept doing it. that is just wrong, 3 folks. 4 fannie told you she trusted them, just like 5 millions of other people. 6 in their own documents it says, our basic 7 position in the cigarette controversy is subject 8 to the charge and may be subject to a finding 9 that we are making false or misleading 10 statements to promote the sale of cigarettes. 11 that is exactly what fannie told you she heard, 12 but the tobacco industry told us it was not 13 dangerous, and i depended on their statements 14 more than the surgeon general because they were 15 the ones producing the cigarettes and they would 16 have more idea of what was in them than the 17 surgeon general in her opinion. was she naive? 18 maybe. but so were millions of other americans. 19 mr. geraghty: i would object and move to 20 strike the last comment. 21 the court: sustained. it will be 22 stricken. 23 mr. hammer: they admit internally that 24 they are making false statements and misleading 25 the public to sell cigarettes. that is their lies. doubt is their product. doubt is their 2 product. 3 when no one was looking, they did an awful 4 lot of things. it is been said that the 5 character -- character is defined by what you do 6 when you think no one is looking. character is 7 defined by what you do when you think no one is 8 looking. let us look at the character of these 9 companies. when no one was looking, they lied, 10 they misled, they committed a fraud to the 11 public, they formed an enterprise to conceal or 12 omit information, they buried and destroyed 13 documents, they manipulated the product. 14 and then when people came looking for 15 answers, what did they do? did they tell the 16 truth? no. they manufactured doubt. doubt is 17 their product. 18 again, the word is confusion. doubt is our 19 product. the success, they brag about the 20 success of the tirc. it is been a successful 21 defensive operation. they talk about giving 22 smokers a psychological crutch. that is exactly 23 what they did to fannie. exactly what they did 24 to fannie. 25 she told us again, i always depended on what the tobacco industry was telling the 2 public. i did not think you people would be 3 lying. i believed you. 4 in their forwarding memo they said how to 5 free americans from the guilty fear, free them 6 from the guilty fear. that is exactly what they 7 did, they gave them a crutch. lies cost lives, 8 folks. lies cost lives. 9 the tobacco industry, they misled the 10 public about the safety of filters and fannie 11 bought into it. you remember these documents. 12 fannie bought into them. she told you. it was 13 filtering out all the impurities, the illusion 14 of filtration. they lied. 15 based on historical record, dr. proctor 16 told you that the filters caused disease, 17 filters caused death. 18 fannie did not know what these tobacco 19 companies knew. she did not know they formed 20 this enterprise to fraudulently conceal the 21 lethal effects. she did not know they hired 22 scientists and doctors to lie. she did not know 23 that they misled the surgeon general to smear 24 and belittle public health officials, that they 25 targeted children, that they knew fifty percent of smokers would die. she did not know that smoking 2 cigarettes was killing hundreds of thousands of 3 americans. she did not know they manipulated the 4 levels of nicotine. she did not know there were 5 70 cancer-causing agents. she did not know there 6 were chemicals like arsenic and cyanide and 7 radioactive polonium. she did not know these 8 things. who did? they did. they did, and they 9 kept it from her and the rest of the world. 10 why? for money. 11 dr. proctor talked about the fact that the 12 whole concept, the whole point of the enterprise 13 was to create a deception. and it worked for 14 decades and fannie fell for it. 15 talked about liggett, liggett's activities. 16 they conducted research internally with contract 17 research organizations. but they, generally, 18 like the other companies, they did not say 19 publicly that smoking caused harm. 20 fannie may not have smoked liggett 21 cigarettes, but liggett made a choice to join 22 the ti. before they made that choice, they had 23 an opportunity, they had an opportunity to come 24 out and tell the truth. they could have said, 25 you know what, what is been going on for the past few years with these other organizations, we 2 do not agree with that. 3 instead they jumped right in. jumped right 4 in. why? because they saw how much money those 5 other companies were making. that is why they 6 did it. 7 you saw the document from liggett. they 8 knew cancer causing, cancer promoting, 9 poisonous. there should be no confusion about 10 the confusion, folks. there was no doubt or 11 confusion internally that cigarettes caused 12 cancer they knew it. there should be no doubt 13 about the doubt. 14 we talked about reliance. we have shown by 15 a greater weight of the evidence that fannie 16 relied to her detriment on the defendants' 17 concealment and agreement to conceal. of course 18 we did. the lies told by philip morris and r.j. 19 reynolds and the other members of the agreement, 20 like liggett, they influenced fannie collar just 21 like tens of millions of americans exactly as 22 they planned. that is what caused fannie's lung 23 cancer. she relied on those statements. 24 (thereupon, the video clip was played to the jury as 25 follows:) speaker: this is 20/20. 2 we asked philip morris, r.j. reynolds, 3 brown & williamson and lorillard to appear on 4 this program. none would. they told us to talk 5 to the tobacco institute. the institute said 6 ann browder would speak for them. 7 the jury has not come in. 8 it may not be harmful. you are not 9 convinced. 10 it may be or it may not be. we do not know. 11 (thereupon, the video clip was concluded.) 12 mr. hammer: that is what they are telling 13 the public in 1983, despite what they know in 14 their internal documents. 15 fannie collar was this industry's perfect 16 customer. their internal documents set out 17 their plan for smokers like her, and she 18 followed that plan to a tee. she did exactly 19 what they wanted her to do, just like millions 20 of other people. she switched to filtered 21 cigarettes. she relied on their statements and 22 she continued smoking for many, many years. she 23 was swept up in the effects of their lies and 24 deceit and concealment, along with millions the 25 others. she was influenced by their conduct. she told you that. 2 consider the scope of that conduct. 3 targeting kids as replacement smokers. 4 mr. geraghty: your honor, i would object 5 and have a motion. 6 the court: sustained. 7 mr. hammer: advertisements, counter 8 messaging, disinformation packets, health 9 reassurances, and a campaign of death. what 10 chance did fannie collar have? 11 they promised to stop making cigarettes if 12 it was determined that they were harmful. they 13 made that promise. they did not stop it. they 14 lied about that too. fannie told you she heard 15 that and relied upon it. 16 you heard the jury instruction on these two 17 topics. agreement to conceal -- and let us go to 18 the verdict form. i'll ask you, did fannie rely 19 on this misinformation? did fannie rely on 20 these lies? did fannie rely upon their campaign 21 of doubt? their lies? of course she did. did 22 it cause her to keep on smoking, keep on being 23 addicted, to get disease? of course. 24 that is why i ask you to check off "yes" to 25 all of these boxes, including liggett. including liggett, rjr, philip morris. they all 2 agreed hand in hand to lie to the american 3 public and perpetuate that lie for decades. 4 we are also going to be asking you to give 5 fannie money for her pain and suffering. 6 everything you need to learn about fannie you 7 can see from her medical records. copd 8 exacerbation. think about this. fannie got 9 lung cancer in 1993. they said, yeah, but she is 10 cured. she is cured? they took out her lung. 11 they cut her open like a can opener to take out 12 her lung. she went through radiation treatments 13 for 8 weeks. she had complications, had to be 14 hospitalized for 45 days. she is cured, as if 15 she took some magic pill and she is all better. 16 really, folks? that is what they want you to 17 believe. she is fine. she is cured. she is got 18 copd. she is had it since 1993, and it is only 19 going to get worse. only going to get worse. 20 the medical records. she is got severe 21 obstruction as late as 2013. severe 22 obstruction. she is going to be tied to this 23 thing. she does not like it. do you think she 24 likes sucking oxygen through a tube? do you 25 think she likes that? she told you she was active. she was vibrant. she loved life. she 2 loved life. she told you she is not going to 3 stop. she does not want to be in a rocking 4 chair. 5 and then, basically, dr. suen told you 6 everything you need to know. you heard from 7 dr. suen, her treating pulmonologist. he takes 8 care of her even today. 9 i'm not going to play that. 10 remember she was asked -- dr. mannino was 11 asked by mr. geraghty, do you think she 12 considered her disabled when she was able to 13 walk three miles after her surgery? do you 14 think she considered herself disabled? that is 15 such an unfair characterization of fannie's 16 disability. such an unfair characterization. 17 we saw the zest for life fannie has. we saw 18 that. she is not going to give up despite her 19 disability. 20 we encourage people with disabilities to 21 fight, not to give into it. what fannie is 22 doing, walking like she did, riding her bike, 23 that should be commended, not disrespected. she 24 does not want to live in a rocking chair. she is 25 going to enjoy her life as best as she can, but she is fighting with every breath. you saw that. 2 on the verdict form you are going to be 3 asked, what is the total damages of the medical 4 bills, and you heard fannie say that she 5 incurred in excess of $200,000. we are going to 6 ask you to award her that $200,000 as 7 reimbursement for the medical bills she is 8 incurred. what is the total amount of damages? 9 how do you put a value on somebody's life? how 10 do you put a value on what she is going through 11 and will continually go through in the future? 12 how do you put a value on a lung? they took her 13 lung out. she is not cured. they took her lung 14 out. how do you put a value on that, on the 15 pain and suffering she is endured and is going to 16 continue to endure until her last breath? how 17 do you put a value on that? 18 i would suggest $15 million as a fair and 19 reasonable amount of money to compensate her for 20 the loss of a lung, for copd and the future 21 she is going to be facing for the next hopefully 22 nine years according to the life tables. it may 23 be shorter. it may be longer. another nine 24 years of sucking on oxygen from a tube, and it is 25 only going to get worse. it is only going to get worse. they do not care. they do not care. 2 we are not here only asking you to 3 compensate fannie for her pain and suffering, 4 which will get worse. we are also here to ask 5 you to consider punishing these tobacco 6 companies. 7 punitive damages. the judge read to you 8 the instruction. look at the things they did. 9 they cannot even talk about what they did. they 10 will not address it. you stand at a unique moment 11 in history. you have the power and authority to 12 do something today in this courtroom. you have 13 to see it clearly. we have to prove to you by 14 clear and convincing evidence that these acts 15 these tobacco companies committed over the years 16 should be punished. i think we certainly have 17 done that with the evidence. 18 you have to remember, this is an industry 19 that is a master of illusion. they have done it 20 for decades. this is their judgment day. it is 21 their day of reckoning. it is time to make an 22 accounting for the past misdeeds. 23 you have got to ask yourself, should they 24 escape punishment? of course not. 25 today i'm calling on you to make an expression of moral condemnation for the 2 insidious -- 3 mr. geraghty: your honor, i object -- 4 the court: sustained. 5 mr. geraghty: -- and move to strike and i 6 have a motion. 7 the court: it will be stricken. 8 mr. hammer: what they did was 9 reprehensible. it does not meet with the bounds 10 of human decency. 11 mr. geraghty: same objection. 12 mr. hammer: it is about corruption. 13 mr. geraghty: same motion, your honor. 14 the court: overruled. reserved on the 15 motion. 16 mr. hammer: it is not corruption. it is not 17 greed. it is not morality. 18 mr. geraghty: objection, your honor. 19 the court: sustained. 20 mr. geraghty: motion. 21 mr. hammer: these companies, they have a 22 survival instinct. the health of their profits 23 is the only thing important to them. they do not 24 care about the customer. they do not care about 25 fannie collar. they are addicted to their products. they enjoy making money. it gives 2 them pleasure and satisfaction. their conduct 3 needs to be examined. 4 these companies, they took over -- reynolds 5 took over, took over lorillard recently. and 6 philip morris, when they took over liggett's 7 brand of chesterfield, what do you hear? 8 remember chesterfield? liggett's attorney stood 9 up here and said, well, we put a label, nicotine 10 is addictive on our cigarettes. what did you 11 hear? philip morris bought that pack -- those 12 cigarettes up. the first thing it did was took 13 the label off. it took the label off. 14 you must decide as to each defendant the 15 punitive damages warranted to punish them and as 16 a deterrent to others, so that other 17 corporations do not do the things that these 18 tobacco companies did for 50 years. so that 19 others do not do what they did. that is the only 20 way things can be right. 21 the tobacco epidemic was initiated and has 22 been sustained by the aggressive strategies of 23 the tobacco industry, which has deliberately 24 misled the public on the risks of smoking, and 25 they should be punished for it. twenty million people have died. they talk 2 about 60 million people have quit. 3 twenty million people have died. 4 numbers, can you conceptualize 20 million 5 people dead? the population in this country has 6 been decimated by this tobacco industry. 7 this epidemic, it is been driven by greed 8 and corruption. let us think about it for a 9 second. 20 million people dead. there is about 10 20 million people in the state of florida. 11 mr. geraghty: your honor, i object. this 12 argument is under williams and state farm. 13 the court: sustained. 14 mr. hammer: you know what, 500,000 people 15 are dying each year today. do they care? not a 16 bit. 17 do you know why? because it is all about 18 money. 19 truth and consequences. it is about truth 20 and consequences. when you engineer your 21 product to cause addiction, there should be 22 consequences. when you target children, there 23 should be consequences. 24 mr. geraghty: your honor, i object. 25 mr. hammer: when you lie to the american public, there should be consequences. when you 2 offer up false solutions -- 3 the court: sustained. 4 mr. hammer: -- there should be 5 consequences. when you offer up filters that 6 do not work, there should be consequences. when 7 you commit fraud, there should be consequences. 8 when you hurt one person, there should be 9 consequences. when you kill millions, there 10 must be consequences. 11 mr. geraghty: your honor, i would move to 12 strike the last comment. 13 the court: sustained. 14 mr. hammer: a manufacturer has to tell the 15 truth about its product. they have to. that is 16 the responsible way to do things. that is the 17 responsible way to do business in this country. 18 if you do not, you need to be punished. it is as 19 simple as that. 20 protect. do not addict. protect. do not 21 addict them. 22 they talk about the base of their business 23 is the 14- to 24-year age group. they talk 24 about inducing a pre-smoker or a non-smoker to 25 become habituated, deliberately playing down the role of nicotine. they referred to younger 2 adults as replacement smokers. as young as 12 3 years old. twelve years old as replacement 4 smokers. that is their target. 5 mr. geraghty: your honor, i would object 6 and move to strike that comment. 7 the court: sustained. 8 mr. hammer: fannie collar, she was one of 9 those replacement smokers at 12 years old. 10 because we know the younger a person is 11 when they start to smoke, the more likely they 12 are to continue to smoke as adults. the tobacco 13 companies knew that. they knew that. 14 internally they knew that. 15 they dehumanized the customer. they called 16 them crops. crops. 17 this is the jury instruction. the frank 18 statement. all you need to do is look at the 19 frank statement. let us take a look close at it. 20 remember the frank statement? this was in 1954. 21 let us look at it basically line by line. we 22 accept an interest as a basic responsibility 23 paramount. 24 their own documents. who ain't for more 25 money? we always have, and we will always cooperate closely with those whose task it is to 2 safeguard the public. but the campaign of 3 smearing and belittling them, trying to smear 4 the scientists who are doing the real research. 5 one by one these charges have been 6 abandoned for lack of evidence, they tell the 7 public, and yet inside they say overwhelming 8 evidence to indict cigarette smoking. they knew 9 it inside, and they are telling the public, oh, 10 no, it is not true. 11 the tirc, they set up a scientist with 12 unimpeachable integrity and national repute, and 13 yet in their own documents they say it was set 14 up as a shield and a front. and let us face it, 15 we are interested in evidence which denies the 16 allegation that cigarette smoking causes 17 disease. is that being truthful? 18 the court: five minutes. 19 mr. hammer: they said if our product is 20 harmful, we will stop making it. what did fannie 21 tell you? in the late '50s, as i recall the 22 tobacco companies were or the industry was 23 telling people if we switch -- if we had any 24 doubts about cigarettes being harmful to our 25 health, we should switch to filters and there would be no problem. and if they ever found out 2 they cause cancer or other disease, they would 3 stop making cigarettes. she relied on that, as 4 did millions of others. 5 they buried the research. they buried it. 6 remember this graph? this was shown. it talks 7 about the rise in cigarettes. rise in 8 cigarettes, and the rise in cancer. this is how 9 they put together that link. 10 remember? 1954, that was a pivotal moment 11 in tobacco history. that is when they linked up 12 arms and decided on this campaign of doubt and 13 lies and deceit. just imagine, just imagine if 14 they would told the truth. fannie collar was 19 15 years old. imagine if they would told the truth. 16 if they would really meant what they said, if it is 17 harmful, we will stop making it. or if they took 18 out the frank statement and said -- told the 19 truth. imagine what would have happened? 20 fannie collar would not have gotten sick. lung 21 cancer would have been extinguished over the 22 years. we would not be here in this courtroom. 23 that is why they should be punished. 24 punitive damages. i would ask you to check 25 off yes, yes, and yes to each of these companies. they need to be punished. they need 2 to be punished. i ask you to check those boxes 3 off, and we will come back for another day, 4 present evidence real quick to you, and then you 5 decide how much. 6 these companies need to be punished. 7 not only for fannie's sake but for 8 everybody else out there. 20 21 mr. hammer: the defense just said to you 22 fannie just quit in '93. she quit in '93 after 23 being hospitalized, having her lung removed, 24 going on oxygen, and then going through 25 radiation for eight weeks, and she just decided to quit. that was a decision? no. 2 she just had surgery to remove her lung. 3 she was just told she had copd, and she was 4 placed on oxygen for a period of time to 5 recuperate. she went through rehab, and then 6 she went through radiation. yeah, i guess 7 that is her decision. she was properly motivated 8 by that kind of surgery. that is what they want 9 you to believe. yes, she was. that is some 10 pretty darn good motivation. 11 guess what, she did not choose to smoke all 12 those years. it was her addiction that drove 13 her smoking. that is what you have got to 14 understand. that is what they want you to just 15 poo poo away, no big deal. 16 they want to talk about all the times that 17 she tried to quit before that and say, well, 18 dr. suen said if she was properly motivated. 19 remember, dr. suen became her doctor in 1993. 20 he was not seeing her all those years beforehand 21 when she was having difficulty quitting. 22 they talk about dr. suen. let us put up 23 dr. suen. can you play dr. suen's testimony? 24 because really everything you need to know about 25 fannie collar and her condition dr. suen told you. 2 (thereupon, the video clip was played and transcribed as 3 follows:) 4 q can you identify any other place in the 5 chart for me where you documented an opinion or your 6 observation on your part that ms. collar had copd, 7 mild or otherwise, prior to january 14th, 2005? 8 a i know that, you know, the -- at the time 9 of her surgery, you know, the lung that was removed 10 was analyzed, and that there were changes of 11 emphysema, pulmonary emphysema in the lung specimen. 12 so even, you know -- even back in the '90s we knew 13 there was -- she did have copd. 14 she may -- i've counseled her multiple 15 times to quit smoking, and there were periods of 16 months at a time where she would not smoke, but she 17 did go back to smoking again. yes, i just do not 18 remember for how long she was smoking free at the 19 time, but she always relapsed back into smoking 20 during those years. 21 with her, you know, i know that she has 22 struggled with trying to quit smoking. so i did talk 23 to her about pharmacological aids, in this case 24 chantix on this visit, and i've also prescribed 25 wellbutrin on other occasions. q do you see anything in this -- either of 2 these exhibits that documents any withdrawal symptoms 3 that she claims to have been suffering from at that 4 time? 5 a i did not document that, but i do have a 6 recollection that she did tell me about withdrawal 7 symptoms. 8 q what specifically did she say in that 9 regard? 10 a my recollection is that she had -- felt 11 like she had a craving for smoking. i remember her 12 using the term feeling jittery or filling more 13 anxious, you know, during that -- when she gets those 14 feelings of wanting to smoke. 15 (thereupon, the video ended.) 16 mr. hammer: so he told you she was 17 relapsing. he told you she was craving. he 18 told you she had copd. not what they have just 19 told you. she had all those signs of an 20 addiction. all of the signs of an addiction. 21 and he prescribed wellbutrin and chantix. but 22 she could have quit any time she wanted, that is 23 what they want you to believe. this woman was 24 addicted. 25 they say she went back to smoking because of meeting up with ben. you know what was 2 missing on mr. geraghty's timeline that he 3 painstakingly blew up for you and went through? 4 no mention of gail on that timeline, her 5 daughter who was diagnosed with a deadly disease 6 and then died 18 months later, which spun fannie 7 right back into that addiction. he conveniently 8 left that off his timeline, did not he? 9 you know, all throughout this case they 10 made a big issue about fannie's mom slapping 11 her. remember that? it was a big issue in 12 opening statement and all throughout the trial. 13 dr. ticknor, what did he tell you? well, i 14 did not really make note of that. that was 15 really not a significant time in her life. the 16 reason is because -- fannie's mother slapped her 17 because she said it was not ladylike. no other 18 reason. she did not want her to smoke. her dad 19 said, just do not let mom find out. smoke with 20 me. so that is another mixed message she is 21 getting not from the tobacco companies, from her 22 own family. 23 she continued to get those mixed messages. 24 they talk about the fact that she said, i only 25 heard it one time. well, let us take a look at the slide of -- i think it is 144, dan. 2 testimony from fannie collar, do you have that? 3 in the late '50s, as i recall, the tobacco 4 industry was -- or the industry was telling us 5 that if we switched -- if we had any doubts 6 about cigarettes being harmful to our health, if 7 we switched to filters, there would be no 8 problem. and if they ever found out that they 9 ever caused cancer or any disease, they would 10 stop making cigarettes, and they are still making 11 cigarettes today. 12 then she told you in that same line of 13 questioning, slide number 145, please. this is 14 mr. geraghty asking her questions. you told us 15 yesterday very clearly that the first time you 16 ever heard of that was in 1966. 17 she answers, i think we had a 18 misunderstanding. i thought you were talking 19 about the warning on the pack, which is 1966. 20 1966 was the first time i saw the warning. my 21 father-in-law showed it to me. he was smoking 22 camels at the time. i was already smoking 23 filters so i felt i was safe. 24 mr. geraghty, so you made a mistake 25 yesterday and you want to change your testimony? no, i do not think it was a mistake. i 2 misunderstood what you were saying. 3 that is what she told mr. geraghty. 4 this whole thing about how she smoked 5 marlboro first and then switched because -- 6 never smoked winston and started smoking 7 marlboros when she met merton, no. let us look 8 at her testimony, slide number 138. 9 i bought winston while mert was smoking 10 camels. 11 that was her testimony in court to the 12 defense counsel. 13 then that was a pattern you had throughout 14 your life? 15 no, i would not say it was a pattern. i 16 bought winstons while mert was still smoking 17 camels. 18 then on slide 139, please. no, i started 19 on winstons. 20 this is, again, defense counsel 21 questioning. 22 then ultimately switched to marlboros? 23 yes, when mert switched to marlboros. 24 let us talk about what we are here about. 25 fannie collar is absolutely addicted. she deserves to be a member of the engle class. the 2 issue is, was anything they said or did 3 important to fannie collar? 4 certainly in 1954, instead of saying, we 5 take an interest and basic responsibility in our 6 customer's health over all other things in our 7 business, instead if they i would have said, 8 quit smoking in 1954 because the scientists are 9 right, smoking causes lung cancer, we would not 10 be here. if they lived up to their promises of, 11 if it is proven that it is unsafe, we will stop 12 making the product, we would not be here. 13 if they did not lie about filters and the 14 fact that it takes out the bad stuff, we would 15 not be here. if they did not lie about the 16 addictiveness of the product and the fact that 17 it causes cancer, we would not be here. it is as 18 simple as that. 19 we would not be here because fannie 20 would not have lung cancer or copd. those lies 21 are what caused her to get those diseases. 22 yeah, obviously her smoking caused her to get 23 those diseases, but her addiction caused her to 24 smoke all those cigarettes. she became addicted 25 because of their lies, because of their lies, as did millions of other people. 2 so were their lies important and relevant? 3 yeah. would that information that they 4 concealed have been substantial for folks to 5 hear, for fannie to hear? of course. what if 6 they had kept their promise to stop making them? 7 lives would be different. 8 mr. geraghty: objection, your honor. 9 the court: overruled. 10 mr. hammer: sadly, all too often in the 11 choice between the physical health of consumers 12 and the financial well-being of business, 13 concealment was chosen over sales over safety 14 and money over morality. these tobacco 15 companies who knowingly and secretly decided to 16 put the public at risk solely for the purpose of 17 making products and believed that illness and 18 death of consumers was an appropriate cost to 19 their own prosperity, that is wrong. 20 mr. geraghty: your honor, i would object. 21 the court: sustained. 22 mr. geraghty: motion. 23 mr. hammer: their conduct needs to be 24 continued to be examined. this is not old news. 25 this goes back to the 1950s and continues. we are just starting to understand the scope of 2 how deep these -- 3 mr. geraghty: your honor, that is not in 4 evidence. 5 the court: sustained. 6 mr. hammer: some of our country's best 7 scholars, including dr. proctor and the students 8 he is teaching out at stanford, are still 9 studying these documents and finding more and 10 more. he told you that. 11 it is important for us to understand what 12 happened because those who forget history are 13 doomed to repeat it. we all know that. that is 14 a lesson we have learned. if you forget about 15 history, society is doomed to repeat it. we 16 cannot let that happen here. 17 that is why punitive damages are so 18 warranted, because when we talk about deterrents 19 to others in punitive damages, we are talking 20 about letting other corporations know that this 21 behavior is not acceptable. that is what it is 22 all about. 23 the jury instruction on agreement to 24 conceal, real quick, slide number 78. it says, 25 each party to an agreement to conceal or omit material information is responsible for the acts 2 or omissions of any other party to the agreement 3 to conceal or omit information so long as the 4 acts or omissions were in furtherance of the 5 agreement to conceal. 6 accordingly, the defendants are responsible 7 for their own acts and for the acts of the other 8 tobacco companies and organizations, meaning the 9 ctr, the ti and the tirc, taken in furtherance 10 of the agreement. 11 that is why all of these companies should be 12 held responsible. they all agreed to conceal 13 this information from the public. they all 14 agreed to conceal this information from fannie 15 collar. yet, can fannie collar point to a 16 company and say, oh, this one told me this on 17 this day, this one told me that on this day. 18 no. 19 they shaped how america felt about 20 cigarettes. they formed the country. they 21 formed the country's opinion about cigarettes. 22 they formed fannie's opinion about cigarettes. 23 she did not know. 24 wait, they want to say she knew. she knew 25 it was harmful. she had to know. her uncle -- i mean, her father-in-law told her. her own 2 father told her. the person she worked for told 3 her. she had to know. 4 well, why did not they know? why did not 5 they know? how did they go on tv and say, we 6 do not know, it is not proven. how did they do 7 that year after year, decade after decade, how 8 did they do that and get away with it? they have 9 gotten away with it. 10 but today in this courtroom you can say no 11 more. that is the power you have. they have 12 shown you their callused and cynical attitude. 13 what these companies did was cold. it was 14 calculated. it was premeditated. they knew 15 exactly what they were doing, and they were 16 doing it all for money. 17 let us take a look at the punitive damages 18 instruction, also, slide number 85. to ask you 19 to punish these companies for their conduct, 20 that is what we are asking you to do because that 21 kind of behavior should not be tolerated by 22 people like you, by juries like you. 23 one of the things you can consider in 24 assessing reprehensibility or wrongfulness is 25 the harm suffered by fannie, as well as the rest of the american public, that is what this 2 instruction tells you. 3 conduct causing loss to fannie was so gross 4 to show disregard of human life or the safety of 5 persons exposed to the elements. total 6 disregard for the safety of people. total 7 disregard that they were harming people 8 throughout the decades. total disregard. 9 they want to talk about the warnings. 10 let us take a look at pt 3870. they want to talk 11 about the warnings, they see how effective and 12 impactive the warnings can be. let us take a 13 look. 14 this is the ftc report to congress in 1967, 15 just after the first caution label went on 16 cigarettes. let us take a look at what the 17 federal trade commission said, please. 18 effectiveness of cigarette labeling. there 19 is virtually no evidence that the warning 20 statement on cigarette packages has had any 21 significant effect. that is the ftc, a 22 government agency talking about the warnings 23 that they say, fannie should have known. 24 they are effective. that is enough. that is all 25 we needed to do. come one, folks. the ftc report says warning labels are not effective. 2 fannie told you when she was shown the 3 label by her father-in-law, what did she tell? 4 she told you, i saw it but i was already smoking 5 filters. he was smoking camels. she told you 6 that. i felt i was safe. why did she feel she 7 was safe? because of what the tobacco companies 8 were telling her. that is why. 9 let us look at how the industry reacted to 10 their warnings. they said, when scientists said 11 smoking causes disease -- their own warnings to 12 the tobacco companies, when scientists said 13 tobacco smoke, cigarettes cause disease, what 14 did they do they? they ignored those warnings 15 and they kept lying and manipulating. 16 when smokers started to get sick and die 17 and the lung cancer rates went up, they ignored 18 those warnings and they kept lying and 19 manipulating. 20 when the surgeon general said smoking 21 causes lung cancer and other diseases, they 22 ignored those warnings and they kept lying and 23 manipulating. 24 when the government said that there was an 25 epidemic, an epidemic caused by cigarettes, they ignored those warnings and they kept lying and 2 manipulating. 3 why? because they are greedy and they are 4 profit minded. that is what it is all about. 5 dr. proctor told you, slide number 120, they are 6 extremely profitable. there is no more 7 profitable industry. 8 slide number 121, there is a certain sort of 9 invisibility that the industry has. that is very 10 important for their whole strategy. essentially 11 making themselves invisible and all attention on 12 the smoker and the cigarette. no attention on 13 themselves. you know what, in this courtroom 14 you heard -- [#deleted objection dialogue#] 9 mr. hammer: thank you, judge. dan, slide 10 number 122, please. 11 dr. proctor told you that for roughly every 12 million cigarettes smoked in our society there is 13 one death. he told you they make millions of 14 cigarettes a day. they have machines that make 15 10 million cigarettes a day. they have got tons 16 of those machines. despite those millions of 17 deaths, do they care? no. they keep making 18 millions of cigarettes from machines that make 19 millions of a day, which result in millions of 20 dollars to these companies and to these 21 defendants. they do not care. they do not care. 22 and dr. suen told you she always relapses 23 back. is that control? no. did she have 24 control as she opened up that vacuum cleaner and 25 dug out a cigarette butt? is that control over her smoking? of course not. that is addiction. 2 they said, well, she was a chipper, because 3 you know, after her surgery she only smoked 4 occasionally and then started smoking with ben. 5 well, what did dr. mannino tell you about that? 6 slide number 141. 7 he was asked: doctor, you do not agree, 8 based upon the medical records that we have 9 reviewed, the pattern we just saw was that of a 10 chipper? 11 he said: no. this is a person who is 12 addicted, who is trying to quit. 13 fannie collar was not a chipper. she was 14 addicted. 15 you know, dr. ticknor, he talked about this 16 60 million people that have quit. remember that 17 discussion mr. gdanski had with him? let us take 18 a look at that. 19 slide number 126. 20 the stat you talked about, you actually 21 do not know the basis of it, the formulation of 22 it, the makeup of it, the demographic of it. 23 i do not. 24 you just came prepared to give one number? 25 yeah, it is the number i'm familiar with. this is the expert they brought in. he has 2 no idea how they came up with that number. 3 that is just the number they gave him. say 4 60 million quit. that is good enough. 5 then he tells you addiction does not cause 6 disease. i've never seen a case where addiction 7 causes disease. how convenient. we have to 8 prove that addiction caused fannie collar's 9 disease. they bring in a witness to you that 10 tells you addiction does not cause disease. 11 let us take a look at pt 1913. 12 this is a document from december 1982. and 13 in this document what do they say about expert 14 witnesses? 15 our medical scientific witnesses will say 16 whatever we want them to say, clearly implying, 17 if not stating, that they lack credibility and 18 integrity. their own documents. basically they 19 say our expert will say whatever we want them to 20 say. 21 you know, in 1953, slide number 128, they 22 linked arms and walked together at the plaza 23 hotel. they recognized that this is the way the 24 world ends. not in a bang, but a whimper. it is 25 something almost too terrible for most of the industry's men to realize, even though the very 2 heads of the great corporations themselves 3 signalized the end of the old days, when they 4 linked arms and walked together because that was 5 unprecedented. as it was pointed out many 6 times, they were competitors, but when they saw 7 their business threatened, they linked arms, 8 they joined forces and decided to lie for the 9 next 50 and 60 years to the american public and 10 people like fannie collar. why? 11 ann browder, number 129, please. 12 she went on tv many different times. you 13 saw her -- i forget what year we showed first. 14 can we show that, dan. 15 (thereupon, the video clip was played and transcribed as 16 follows:) 17 speaker: we know cigarette smoking is bad 18 for our health. why does the tobacco institute 19 continue to promote smoking? 20 speaker: well, the tobacco institute does 21 not promote smoking. it promotes the right of 22 an individual to make a decision to smoke and 23 then supports that individual in making that 24 decision. 25 and i have to disagree with you in that we do not know what causes the ailments that have 2 been attributed to cigarette smoking. certainly 3 i am not denying the fact that cigarette smoking 4 could be a risk factor involved with some people 5 and some of the problems that they might have, 6 but i do not think that there is a causal 7 relationship established between cigarette 8 smoking and any disease. if there were, diane, 9 i do not think there would be a cause without the 10 effect or the effect without the cause, and we 11 all know that happens. 12 (thereupon, the videotaped testimony of the witness was 13 concluded.) 14 mr. hammer: 1983, speaking on behalf of 15 all of the tobacco companies, philip morris, 16 r.j. reynolds, liggett. still, we do not know as 17 late as 1983. 18 let us take a look at pt 2412. 19 this is a document that is in evidence. 20 let us go to that page i asked you to turn to. 21 why do they do it? why do they do it? they say 22 let us provide the exquisiteness and hope that 23 they, our consumers, continue to remain 24 unsatisfied. all we would want then is a larger 25 bag to carry the money to the bank. that is what this is all about. that is what 2 drives it. that is their life blood. that is 3 their oxygen. they need it. they want it. 4 that is all they care about at the risk of 5 killing millions of people. 6 you know, the truth is fannie will die a 7 slow and miserable death. sad to think about 8 it, and i hate saying it in front of her. she is 9 going to end up gasping for air. and despite 10 her best efforts, she is going to suffocate. 11 that is what happens to people with copd. that is 12 what is going to happen to her. 13 they want to say it is all because she 14 was not motivated to quit. what was their 15 motivation to lie? we know the answer. bigger 16 bags of money to take to the bank. 17 they knew it. their motivation, pt 1525. 18 unless some lawyer be looking over our 19 shoulder, i do not conceive that even one person 20 dies of a chronic disease that is caused by 21 smoking cigarettes. their own documents. 22 their lying did not stop. it continued 23 throughout the years. it continued all the way 24 through the years leading up to fannie lung 25 diagnosis. and it went to the highest levels of government. we saw this once before, and i want 2 to show it to you again, in 1994. 3 (thereupon, the video clip was played and transcribed as 4 follows:) 5 i'd like you to rise and those who will be 6 testifying as well, will you to rise. 7 do you swear that the testimony you are 8 about to give is the truth the whole truth and 9 nothing but the truth? 10 please consider yourself to be under oath. 11 let me give my question on the matter of 12 whether or not nicotine was addictive. let me 13 ask you first, i'd like to go down the row, 14 whether each of you believes that nicotine is 15 not addictive? i heard virtually all of you 16 touch on it. yes or no, do you believe nicotine 17 is not addictive? 18 i believe nicotine is not addictive, yes. 19 mr. johnson. 20 congressman, cigarettes and nicotine 21 clearly do not meet the classic definition of 22 addiction -- 23 we will take that as a no. again, time is 24 short. i think each of you believe nicotine is 25 not addictive. we just would like to have this for the record. 2 i do not believe the nicotine from our 3 products are addictive. 4 i believe nicotine is not addictive. 5 i believe that nicotine is not addictive. 6 i believe that nicotine is not addictive. 7 and i too believe that nicotine is not 8 addictive. 9 mr. campbell, you were also deposed and you 10 said, quote, to my knowledge, it has not been 11 proven that cigarette smoking causes cancer. 12 this is a rather passive and puzzling approach, 13 especially in light of the consensus. 14 not by some, but all of the scientific 15 community will you ever be convinced, and what 16 evidence are you waiting for? let us have the 17 microphone passed over. 18 yes, i may be convinced. we do not know 19 what causes cancer in general right now. so i 20 think that we may find out what causes cancer 21 and we may find out some relationship, which has 22 yet to be proven. 23 (thereupon, the video clip was concluded.) 24 mr. hammer: a year after fannie collar is 25 opened up like a can opener to remove her lung, they are still going to congress, going to 2 congress, raising their hand and lying. that is 3 as reprehensible as it gets. 4 the court: you have like 3 minutes. 5 mr. hammer: thank you, judge. 6 for nearly 20 years this industry has 7 employed a single strategy to defend itself on 8 three major fronts: litigation, politics and 9 public opinion. while the strategy was 10 brilliant, conceived, and executed over the 11 years, helping us to win important battles, it 12 is only fair to say that it is not, nor was it 13 intended to be, a vehicle for victory. on the 14 contrary, that has always been a holding 15 strategy consisting of creating doubt about the 16 health effects without actually denying it. 17 they talk about fannie saw one statement. 18 let us put up her testimony at 142, please, 19 dan. 20 that is not what fannie said. she told you 21 when you use the tobacco industry term, the 22 combination of all of the tobacco companies. i 23 think when mr. belasic got up here and he said 24 to you that was only one statement, remember? 25 was it only one statement that you heard over the years or many, many statements over the 2 years? there was more than one. more than one 3 statement. yes. there was more than one 4 statement. she told you that. 5 i ask you, do not erase fannie's name from 6 the history of this atrocity that these tobacco 7 companies created. posterity should remember 8 things. you can make that happen today with 9 your verdict. inscribe her name in the law 10 books of florida, maintaining her name in the 11 proud engle class to which she belongs. the 12 engle class has done so much to bring -- 13 mr. geraghty: your honor, i object and 14 make a motion. 15 the court: sustained. 16 you have about 1 minute. 17 mr. hammer: this litigation has brought 18 tobacco companies -- 19 mr. geraghty: i object, your honor -- 20 the court: sustained. 21 mr. geraghty: -- and make a motion. 22 mr. hammer: history has brought the 23 tobacco companies' deception and lies to light 24 for you all to see. fannie deserves to be 25 remembered. she deserves to be remembered. she deserves to be a member of the engle class. she 2 does not want to be. she wishes she did not have 3 to be. but these companies, their lies, their 4 deceit, that is what caused it. because if they 5 would have been truthful over the years, things 6 would have been different. 7 six people can change history. 8 mr. geraghty: your honor, i would object 9 and make a motion, your honor. 10 the court: sustained. 11 and you are out of time. 12 mr. hammer: we ask you to return a verdict 13 for fannie collar, check off the box for 14 punitive damages, and we will come back one more 15 day to talk about how these companies should be 16 punished. i want to thank you for your service 17 and your attention. this case is now in your 18 hands. thank you, on behalf of fannie.
