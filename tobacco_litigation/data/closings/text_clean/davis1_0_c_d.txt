closing argument by the defense 14:51:52 mr. mccarter: and good afternoon, ladies and 14:51:53 gentlemen. i'm happy to be able to talk to you at the end 14:51:56 of this case. and thank you for your time and attention 14:51:58 throughout the trial. and i say that on my behalf and on 14:52:01 behalf of the folks who are working with me, at the office, 14:52:03 behind the scenes, putting in the effort day and night 14:52:06 here. 14:52:06 as we have done throughout the case, i'm going to 14:52:10 take most of the defense time up. i'm going to talk about 14:52:14 arguments and reasons and evidence that applies to both 14:52:16 defendants. 14:52:17 and then you are going to hear from miss patterson, 169 14:52:20 1 who will talk about reasons, additional reasons, why you 14:52:23 2 should find in favor of her client, r.j. reynolds. 14:52:26 3 so i want to start by really picking up where i 14:52:29 4 left off in my opening statement. and that is talking 14:52:33 5 about what the evidence showed in this case. you may 14:52:36 6 recall i talked about this about six days ago. 14:52:38 7 what the evidence showed was that mrs. davis was 14:52:42 8 aware of the risks of smoking. 14:52:44 9 mr. byrd: objection as to time, age. 14:52:52 the court: well, if we reach that, we will get to 14:52:55 it. i do not think we have to reach that yet. 14:52:58 go ahead. 14:52:58 mr. mccarter: that miss davis smoked because she 14:53:01 enjoyed smoking. that she was able to quit when she wanted 14:53:04 to quit. that mrs. davis was not affected by anything the 14:53:09 tobacco companies said or did. 14:53:10 and i'm going to go through these one by one, 14:53:12 starting with her awareness of the dangers of smoking. 14:53:18 because what you have seen in the evidence is that for 14:53:20 39 years, the last 39 years of her smoking, mrs. davis was 14:53:24 warned of the risks on every single package of cigarettes 14:53:29 she smoked. 14:53:30 there is no dispute in this case that r.j. reynolds 14:53:32 and philip morris complied with the law and put this 14:53:36 warning on every package of cigarettes they sold in the 170 14:53:38 1 united states between 1966 and 1970. 14:53:43 2 no dispute about it. that was on every pack of 14:53:48 3 cigarettes miss davis smoked during those years. 14:53:50 4 the warning changed in 1970. and from 1975 to 14:53:53 5 '85 -- 1970 to '85, this was the warning on all of 14:54:00 6 mrs. davis' packs. 14:54:01 7 she testified that she knew the warnings were on 14:54:05 8 her packs and she understood the warnings. she understood 14:54:07 9 the message they were telling her, that cigarette smoking 14:54:14 was dangerous to her health. 14:54:15 no dispute that r.j. reynolds and philip morris 14:54:19 complied with the law and put this warning on every package 14:54:22 of cigarettes they sold during those years. 14:54:25 then, of course, in 1985, the warning changed 14:54:27 again. and for the last 20 years mrs. davis smoked, one of 14:54:34 these four warnings would have been on every package of 14:54:37 cigarettes she smoked. 14:54:39 no dispute again that r.j. reynolds and philip 14:54:41 morris complied with the law at all times and put one of 14:54:43 these warnings on every package of cigarettes. 14:54:46 mrs. davis was warned of the very disease she 14:54:49 would get, emphysema, 13 years before she got it. she had 14:54:53 a warning on her pack speaking specifically to that 14:54:56 disease. 14:54:56 now, plaintiff's counsel earlier did an analogy 171 14:55:02 1 where he was talking about, well, what if -- what if we 14:55:06 2 found out later that cell phones are causing cancer? 14:55:10 3 but what he did not use in his analogy was what if 14:55:13 4 your cell phone had a warning on it every time you picked 14:55:17 5 it up that told you, warning, using a cell phone causes 14:55:20 6 cancer? 14:55:21 7 that is the analogy here. that is what mrs. davis 14:55:24 8 had. for 39 years that she was using her cigarettes, there 14:55:28 9 were warnings that she would have seen every time she 14:55:30 picked up her pack. 14:55:31 and in the advertising, when she saw advertising 14:55:34 after 1971, 1972, every one of those ads would have had a 14:55:40 warning on it as well. 14:55:41 but warnings were not the only source of 14:55:44 information for mrs. davis about the dangers of smoking. 14:55:51 we know from the evidence, and you have seen it, that her 14:55:53 friends and family members talked to her about the risks of 14:55:56 smoking throughout the years. 14:55:59 mr. byrd: objection. vague as to time. 14:56:04 the court: well, i'm just going to say this once, 14:56:06 and i do not think defense counsel is suggesting anything 14:56:11 different. 14:56:11 but we do not hold children to the same standard 14:56:18 as adults in terms of making decisions. so the question of 14:56:25 voluntariness is really in relation to her as an adult 172 14:56:30 1 after the age of 18. 14:56:32 2 mr. mccarter: thank you, your honor. 14:56:33 3 and these warnings were all on the packs when she 14:56:36 4 was an adult. and these conversations with her friends and 14:56:38 5 family members all occurred when she was an adult. 14:56:41 6 remember, her husband, jackie, quit smoking in the 14:56:45 7 early 1970s. he quit cold turkey. and he and miss davis 14:56:50 8 used to smoke together. 14:56:56 9 miss davis said in her deposition -- and you heard 14:56:56 this read -- that the only thing he said after he quit, the 14:56:57 only thing he said was he was not going to buy her 14:57:00 cigarettes anymore. 14:57:01 but what you heard when she was cross-examined 14:57:03 yesterday is that mr. davis did, in fact, talk to her after 14:57:09 he quit smoking. he told her it was bad for her health. 14:57:13 he told her she should quit. 14:57:14 that was the same message miss davis was getting 14:57:17 to her over the years from her sons. her son jackie talked 14:57:21 to her about her smoking in the 1970s and 1980s and said 14:57:25 she should quit. she had the same conversation with david. 14:57:27 she had the same conversation with tommy. 14:57:30 she talked to her brother cecil. he was the one 14:57:33 who quit smoking when the smoke was choking him. he 14:57:36 could not breath. he told her all about it, and he told her 14:57:38 how he quit. 173 14:57:39 1 and you heard today from fran craft. now, let me 14:57:43 2 back up a second. because fran craft was the person that 14:57:46 3 mrs. davis said before the lawsuit knew the most about her 14:57:50 4 smoking. you heard her testify yesterday that she filled 14:57:53 5 out a form. she was asked to list the name of people who 14:57:58 6 know about her smoking. and she listed one name. and that 14:58:02 7 was fran craft. 14:58:03 8 we brought you fran craft's testimony today. 14:58:05 9 mr. byrd: objection. misstates the testimony. 14:58:11 the court: excuse me? 14:58:11 mr. byrd: it misstates the facts in evidence 14:58:13 about the verified worksheet. she is supposed to list 14:58:16 anybody that had any knowledge of all of her claims and 14:58:20 damages. 14:58:20 the court: no. i think this is fair argument. 14:58:22 overruled. 14:58:23 mr. mccarter: thank you, your honor. 14:58:24 she listed one person, fran craft. who brought 14:58:28 fran craft's testimony to you? we did. 14:58:30 we did not bring you experts who had been paid 14:58:32 $3 million or $1 million or $350,000 who say the same thing 14:58:38 in every case in which they are getting paid. 14:58:41 we brought you testimony from the one person she 14:58:43 listed as having knowledge about facts in this case. and 14:58:46 what did fran craft say? she said she always talked to 174 14:58:50 1 mrs. davis about her smoking. 14:58:51 2 she told mrs. davis she should quit. what did 14:58:56 3 mrs. davis say in response? we would laugh it off and say, 14:59:00 4 i do not want to quit smoking because i enjoy smoking. 14:59:03 5 and she did enjoy smoking. and she was aware of 14:59:06 6 the risks of smoking. 14:59:07 7 mrs. davis' doctors talked about her smoking with 14:59:13 8 her. that is just some of the medical records you have been 14:59:16 9 shown. but you know that going back to the 1960s, 14:59:19 mrs. davis' doctors were telling her to quit smoking while 14:59:22 she was pregnant. they repeated the message in all three 14:59:25 of her pregnancies. 14:59:27 then in the time we have medical records, you saw 14:59:29 notes in the medical records telling mrs. davis, counseling 14:59:32 her to discontinue smoking. 14:59:35 she was getting messages from her doctors as well. 14:59:38 these messages sunk in. there is no dispute about it, 14:59:42 because i asked mrs. davis this yesterday. 14:59:44 i asked her, going back to the mid-1960s when you 14:59:49 were in your 20s, you knew that smoking was bad for your 14:59:53 health. 14:59:56 when you were 25 years old, you knew smoking was 15:00:00 bad for your health, correct? 15:00:01 answer: true. 15:00:02 from age 25 on, for the last 50 years, mrs. davis 175 15:00:07 1 knew smoking was bad for her health. 15:00:09 2 now, you heard yesterday when plaintiff's counsel 15:00:12 3 was questioning mrs. davis, he asked, well, when you were a 15:00:16 4 little girl living in tampa, did anybody warn you that 15:00:22 5 cigarette smoking was addictive? 15:00:24 6 and he may have gotten an answer he did not expect. 15:00:27 7 but the answer was yes. yes, people told me that. 15:00:31 8 now, i'm not saying that to suggest that 15:00:34 9 mrs. davis is to blame as a ten-year-old for disregarding 15:00:38 that advice. but my point is that the information about 15:00:40 addictiveness, that it is hard to quit smoking was so 15:00:43 widespread that a ten-year-old girl in tampa in a rural 15:00:48 area knew about it and was warned about it. 15:00:52 that is how widespread knowledge was about how hard 15:00:55 it was to quit tobacco, going back for hundreds of years, 15:00:58 for a hundred years or more. 15:01:00 now, the evidence also shows that miss davis 15:01:05 smoked because she enjoyed smoking. you saw a video of her 15:01:09 deposition where she testified that she loved smoking. she 15:01:14 loved smoking. 15:01:15 and yesterday when she testified, she testified 15:01:18 again that she enjoyed smoking and that she told her 15:01:21 friends over the years that she enjoyed smoking, that she 15:01:24 told them that she enjoyed smoking before she ever filed 15:01:27 this lawsuit. 176 15:01:32 1 and i talked about fran craft's testimony. you 15:01:34 2 heard that earlier today. we read it to you. 15:01:40 3 mrs. davis told her that she did not want to quit 15:01:43 4 because she enjoyed smoking. and yesterday when mrs. davis 15:01:46 5 testified, she admitted that that is what she told fran 15:01:49 6 craft. 15:01:49 7 miss davis also said that she enjoyed smoking 15:01:58 8 marlboro cigarettes, that they were her favorite cigarette. 15:02:01 9 and she also said -- and this is important at the 15:02:04 bottom -- that she continued to smoke marlboro as her brand 15:02:07 for all the years she smoked it. 15:02:11 because you enjoyed them, correct? 15:02:13 the image you are getting from plaintiff's counsel 15:02:15 and plaintiff in this entire case is that mrs. davis was a 15:02:19 victim to her addiction, a victim to addiction who was 15:02:22 driven to smoke compulsively. 15:02:24 that is not why she smoked. she smoked because she 15:02:27 loved it and she enjoyed it. 15:02:29 she knew the risks, but it was something she 15:02:31 enjoyed doing. and she was willing to accept the risks to 15:02:34 do it. 15:02:35 mr. byrd: objection. assumption of risk, 15:02:38 your honor. 15:02:53 the court: well, let me say this to you, ladies 15:03:02 and gentlemen. if you were to find on the one hand that 177 15:03:09 1 miss davis was addicted and that addiction was a sufficient 15:03:19 2 cause of her copd and you were also to find that she was 15:03:22 3 aware of that risk and still insisted on smoking, you would 15:03:27 4 still, in that situation, have to find for the plaintiff. 15:03:33 5 because the addiction that caused her to continue 15:03:40 6 smoking, even though she could not -- there is a different 15:03:42 7 issue whether she could have stopped. but the mere fact 15:03:45 8 that she knew of the risk when she undertook smoking is not 15:03:53 9 a defense if the addiction was the cause of her copd. 15:04:00 go ahead, counsel. 15:04:02 mr. mccarter: thank you, your honor. 15:04:04 third, the evidence shows that mrs. davis was able 15:04:06 to quit smoking when she wanted to quit. 15:04:09 the fact is that mrs. davis was not interested in 15:04:12 quitting smoking for a very long time. 15:04:14 when she heard from the surgeon general in the 15:04:18 1960s that smoking was bad for her health, she was not 15:04:23 interested in quitting and did not try to quit. 15:04:25 when she saw the warnings on her packs in the 15:04:27 1960s and the 1970s and afterward, she was not interested 15:04:31 in quitting and did not want to quit. 15:04:33 when her husband jackie quit in the 1970s, she was 15:04:36 not interested in quitting. 15:04:38 when her children urged her to quit smoking in the 15:04:40 '70s and '80s, she was not interested in quitting. 178 15:04:44 1 when fran craft, her friend, said, you should quit 15:04:46 2 smoking, in the 1990s and 2000s, she said she did not want 15:04:51 3 to quit. she enjoyed the cigarettes. 15:04:53 4 and when her doctors advised her to quit, first 15:04:55 5 when she was pregnant and later in life, she was not 15:04:59 6 interested in quitting. 15:05:00 7 and what she said to her sons, i think, speaks 15:05:05 8 volumes. because what she told her sons when they said, 15:05:09 9 mom, you should quit, she said, leave me alone. i know 15:05:14 it is bad for my health. it is my decision to smoke. and 15:05:18 that i will quit when i want to quit. 15:05:21 and that is exactly what she did in 2005. she quit 15:05:25 when she wanted to quit. 15:05:26 this is from her friend fran craft that you heard 15:05:35 this morning. 15:05:36 did mrs. davis ever tell you, ever indicate to you 15:05:40 that she had any interest in quitting smoking? 15:05:43 the answer: no. 15:05:44 i submit to you that is about as opposite as you 15:05:49 can get from what the plaintiff is telling you in this 15:05:51 case. and this is evidence from before this lawsuit was 15:05:55 filed, evidence as to miss davis' reaction when miss craft 15:06:01 would talk to her about her smoking. 15:06:03 what miss davis said before the lawsuit was filed 15:06:06 was, i do not want to quit smoking. i enjoy smoking. and 179 15:06:10 1 that is why she smoked. 15:06:11 2 and, you know, you have seen this record. you have 15:06:16 3 seen this board numerous times. 15:06:20 4 but even as we get into the last year of 15:06:24 5 mrs. davis' smoking, her doctor is counseling her to quit 15:06:27 6 smoking. and he writes down, at this time she does not 15:06:30 7 seem receptive to it. october 2004, that is what her doctor 15:06:38 8 writes down. 15:06:38 9 that is -- remember, this is year 19 of that 15:06:42 supposed 20-year marathon quit attempt using the waterpik 15:06:47 filters, where she says she is trying to quit for 20 years. 15:06:50 and her doctor is trying to help her quit. and whatever 15:06:53 she says to him, he writes down, she is not receptive to his 15:06:57 message about quitting smoking. 15:06:59 now, you may remember when dr. cummings was here, 15:07:04 i showed this record to him. and then there were some 15:07:08 questions asked later suggesting that the reason mrs. davis 15:07:11 did not want to quit at this point in time was because she 15:07:13 was taking care of her son tommy. 15:07:17 you did not hear that from mrs. davis yesterday. 15:07:20 dr. cummings was talking about it. but mrs. davis did not 15:07:23 say that. 15:07:23 and, in fact, this is two years after tommy was 15:07:25 injured. and mrs. davis was saying the same thing to fran 15:07:31 craft before tommy was hurt. and when she wound up 180 15:07:34 1 quitting, she quit and tommy was still hurt. 15:07:37 2 so this had nothing to do with her son's injury. 15:07:40 3 mrs. davis did not claim it did. it was only dr. cummings 15:07:43 4 making that claim. 15:07:44 5 mr. byrd: objection. misstates testimony of 15:07:46 6 dr. cummings. 15:07:51 7 the court: the jury's recollection will govern. 15:07:55 8 and i want to mention to you, ladies and gentlemen 15:07:57 9 -- i think i mentioned this before -- if at any time during 15:08:01 your deliberations you are unsure of what someone said, just 15:08:06 send us a note. and we will find the testimony and we will 15:08:09 send it back to you so you do not have to speculate. 15:08:13 we can tell you definitively. we can provide you 15:08:16 with the actual transcript of what was said about any 15:08:19 particular matter. 15:08:20 in this matter, i do not recall one way or the 15:08:23 other. so your recollection will govern. 15:08:26 mr. mccarter: thank you, your honor. 15:08:26 just a few months later, she did quit in 2005. so 15:08:32 what changed? what changed -- and you remember this from 15:08:35 her testimony -- is that she decided she had spent too much 15:08:37 money on cigarettes, and she was tired of spending money on 15:08:41 cigarettes. 15:08:42 she had nine cigarettes left in her pack. she 15:08:44 smoked them all in a row. and she did something she had 181 15:08:47 1 never done before. and that is she threw away her pack. 15:08:52 2 she threw away her ashtrays. she threw away her lighters. 15:08:56 3 because at that point in 2005, she had finally 15:08:59 4 made the decision that she wanted to quit smoking. 15:09:01 5 and once she made that decision, it was as simple 15:09:04 6 as smoking the cigarettes in the pack, throwing everything 15:09:07 7 away, and she never smoked again. 15:09:09 8 now, before that when you heard from their 15:09:17 9 witnesses that she is trying and trying and trying and 15:09:18 wanting and wanting to quit but just cannot do it, before 15:09:21 she did that in 2005, she never went 24 hours without 15:09:29 smoking; she never threw away her ashtrays and lighters and 15:09:33 cigarettes. 15:09:34 there is no evidence that mrs. davis ever told 15:09:36 anybody that she wanted to quit before she quit in 2005. 15:09:40 and there is no evidence that anyone saw her try to quit 15:09:43 before she quit in 2005. 15:09:44 and this is important because the evidence is that 15:09:50 if mrs. davis had decided to quit earlier and just finish 15:09:54 her pack and throw her lighters and ashtrays and cigarettes 15:09:59 away, if she had done that sooner, before she got sick, she 15:10:05 never would have gotten copd. 15:10:07 mr. byrd: objection, your honor. causation. 15:10:10 conflating the issue. looking at the screen. 15:10:23 the court: let me hear the last sentence re-read. 182 15:10:25 1 oh, wait a minute. here it is. sorry. 15:10:28 2 overruled. 15:10:41 3 mr. mccarter: this is from their own witness' 15:10:43 4 testimony. this is dr. burns. he admitted if she had quit 15:10:46 5 smoking, if a smoker quits before they have damage to their 15:10:49 6 lungs, they are not going to go on to get copd. 15:10:53 7 and mrs. davis had that opportunity for years and 15:10:54 8 years and years, from the time she learned the dangers of 15:10:58 9 smoking when she was 25 up until whenever it was that she 15:11:02 first damaged her lungs. 15:11:04 mr. byrd: objection. causation. 15:11:27 the court: i think we are going to need a quick 15:11:29 sidebar. i'm sorry. 15:11:30 counsel? 15:11:30 (discussion at sidebar on the record.) 15:11:59 the court: so on the third required prong, i've 15:12:09 already told the jury that addiction is sufficient cause, 15:12:15 that the fact that she knew about it does not matter. 15:12:18 what is it that you -- 15:12:20 mr. byrd: well, i think this goes to -- you gave 15:12:21 the instruction on the third question, on smoking, whether 15:12:27 she could quit or not was not -- it is really the same deal. 15:12:31 we do that because it is a causation question. 15:12:33 it is basically saying that she knew this and she 15:12:37 could have quit earlier. there was no causation. she had 183 15:12:40 1 the ability to quit. instead, i think we are just getting 15:12:43 2 too far afield from what causation is all about. 15:12:48 3 the court: this is the -- i think the argument we 15:12:55 4 had at the charging conference -- i think that under the 15:12:57 5 law, as i understand it, this is still a third required 15:13:04 6 finding of members of the class. it is not a thereafter 15:13:07 7 clause. 15:13:09 8 as you know, i instructed the jury cannot use 15:13:13 9 thereafter. 15:13:16 mr. byrd: we use after for comparative fault. 15:13:18 the court: yeah. 15:13:19 mr. byrd: it should not be used in causation. 15:13:21 mr. mccarter: i'm not even arguing in the context 15:13:23 of a specific verdict form question. i'm just talking 15:13:26 about what the evidence shows. if it is relevant to one of 15:13:29 the claims, there should not be these objections. 15:13:32 the court: and i agree. i think i'm a little 15:13:34 concerned, although i do think the objections are fair, to 15:13:36 clarify. 15:13:36 i do not think defense counsel said anything wrong. 15:13:47 but there was some ambiguity, and it should be clarified. 15:13:51 i think an extension of risk can be clarified. so i think 15:13:54 this one is still within the realm of argument. i will not 15:13:58 have an instruction at this time. 15:14:02 i'll keep it under consideration as we go forward. 184 15:14:14 1 all right. 15:14:16 2 (end of discussion at sidebar.) 15:14:33 3 mr. mccarter: if mrs. davis had quit smoking when 15:14:35 4 she was 25 years old and knew that smoking was bad for her 15:14:38 5 health, she would have avoided getting copd. 15:14:41 6 if she had quit when the warning went on the pack 15:14:43 7 in 1966, she would have avoided getting copd. 15:14:48 8 if she had quit in 1970 when the warning changed, 15:14:51 9 she would have avoided getting copd. 15:14:54 if she had quit in the '70s and '80s when her 15:14:58 husband and her sons were talking to her about her smoking, 15:15:01 she would have avoided getting copd. 15:15:03 in 1985 when the warning specifically warned her 15:15:06 of the disease she would get 13 years later, if she had 15:15:09 quit then, she would have avoided getting it. 15:15:13 the court: now, again, i'm sorry, counsel. 15:15:14 i need to just remind you, ladies and gentlemen, 15:15:17 because this needs to be kept in mind. 15:15:26 if you find that she was already addicted and you 15:15:31 find that the addiction would have caused her ultimate 15:15:41 copd, then the fact that she could have quit may be 15:15:47 relevant for comparative fault. but it is not a total 15:15:52 defense. 15:15:53 so just keep that in mind. it goes to -- in that 15:15:57 context, you will have to determine, well, was, you know, 185 15:16:05 1 was she -- how much of a fault for her disease did she bear 15:16:10 2 some blame for because she did not quit? 15:16:13 3 so it is highly relevant to the case. but it is not 15:16:15 4 a total defense. it would still be liable. 15:16:19 5 mr. mccarter: thank you, your honor. 15:16:24 6 the evidence also showed that mrs. davis was not 15:16:27 7 affected by anything the tobacco companies ever said or 15:16:29 8 did. 15:16:31 9 plaintiff's counsel has put a lot of those sticky 15:16:34 things, those sticky notes on that timeline over there. 15:16:38 and i told you in my opening that -- to be on the lookout. 15:16:40 they are going to show you a lot of old documents and old 15:16:43 videos and old ads. 15:16:44 but the question is, what, if anything, does it 15:16:46 have to do with mrs. davis? and i submit to you that if 15:16:51 you took off all the stickies on there that are things that 15:16:54 she never saw or heard or knew about or was affected by, if 15:16:57 you stripped their board of all those stickies that had 15:17:00 nothing to do with her, this is what their board would look 15:17:08 like. 15:17:08 because none of the statements they showed, none 15:17:11 of the videos they played, none of the advertisements they 15:17:14 showed you had anything to do with mrs. davis. 15:17:16 and we know that because that is what mrs. davis 15:17:21 said yesterday. 186 15:17:25 1 mrs. davis testified yesterday that she never 15:17:28 2 heard any tobacco companies' statements. nothing. 15:17:33 3 question: you do not remember ever seeing or 15:17:35 4 hearing a statement by anyone from the tobacco companies at 15:17:38 5 any time, correct? 15:17:40 6 answer: correct. 15:17:41 7 what is on that board over there has nothing to do 15:17:46 8 with mrs. davis. nothing on there, no statement by the 15:17:49 9 tobacco companies about smoking and disease or addiction. 15:17:53 she never heard it. it never had any effect on her. 15:17:58 what about cigarette advertising? 15:18:01 remember, we had dr. kyriakoudes there for three 15:18:04 or four hours talking about advertising? 15:18:09 then i asked him, first question on 15:18:11 cross-examination: does anything you are talking about, are 15:18:13 you saying, telling the jury it has something to do with 15:18:16 mrs. davis? 15:18:18 her as an individual? no. 15:18:20 so he spent three or four hours talking about 15:18:22 things that there is no evidence had anything to do with 15:18:25 her. 15:18:25 and we know from dr. burns, he reviewed the 15:18:30 depositions and the medical records. and he talked about 15:18:33 cigarette advertising intercepting people as they are trying 15:18:37 to quit. 187 15:18:37 1 well, i asked dr. burns. and he testified that 15:18:40 2 advertising did not influence her to start. if that is -- i 15:18:44 3 think that is a fair statement. 15:18:45 4 so their own witness is saying, cigarette 15:18:49 5 advertising is not what caused mrs. davis to start smoking. 15:18:53 6 and, of course, you know from mrs. davis' testimony that 15:18:56 7 she was not influenced by cigarette advertising. this was 15:19:01 8 long, so i'm not going to read it. 15:19:03 9 but she is -- she did not have a television growing 15:19:08 up. she did not see ads on television for cigarettes before 15:19:11 she started smoking. she was not influenced by television 15:19:14 advertising to go out and buy a pack of cigarettes. 15:19:17 in fact, she did not even choose her brands. she 15:19:20 did not choose her brands based on cigarette advertising. 15:19:23 she chose her brands based on what people gave her when she 15:19:27 was younger. 15:19:27 then when she was an adult, she chose her brand 15:19:30 based on what her husband bought. he brought the 15:19:33 cigarettes home, and she smoked what he bought. she was not 15:19:36 influenced by advertising. 15:19:37 now, the rest of the time i want to spend talking 15:19:42 about the verdict form, because that is going to be your 15:19:43 job, of course, is to get the verdict form to deliberate 15:19:47 together and to answer the questions that are posed to you. 15:19:49 and i want to walk through the questions on the 188 15:19:52 1 verdict form. but before i do, i want to say something 15:19:55 2 about this burden of proof, because with the exception of 15:19:59 3 the comparative fault issue, the plaintiff bears the burden 15:20:03 4 of proof on everything. 15:20:05 5 and they bear the burden of proof to provide you 15:20:07 6 with credible evidence. credible evidence. evidence you 15:20:11 7 can believe in and trust that allows you to conclude that 15:20:15 8 they met their burden of proof. 15:20:16 9 now, there is a statement in here that you do not 15:20:20 decide whether they meet their burden of proof the way 15:20:22 counsel suggested, by stacking up the number of witnesses 15:20:25 on both sides and saying they called more witnesses, they 15:20:29 used more of your time, so they win. that is not the way it 15:20:32 works. 15:20:32 it does not mean the greater number of witnesses. 15:20:37 and one reason why is because we go second. we have the 15:20:41 benefit of cross-examining their witnesses. and when we 15:20:45 ask their witnesses questions and they give us answers, 15:20:48 that is evidence you are getting from us. 15:20:51 and we put in a lot of evidence, hours and hours 15:20:53 of evidence from when we cross-examined dr. burns and 15:20:59 dr. kyriakoudes and dr. cummings and mrs. davis and then we 15:21:02 brought you fran craft. 15:21:03 so this nonsense about us not bringing evidence is 15:21:07 just that. it is nonsense. because what you learned from 189 15:21:10 1 our cross-examinations of their own witnesses is that 15:21:14 2 people have known for a hundred years or more that 15:21:17 3 cigarettes are harmful to your health, that they are hard to 15:21:20 4 quit. that people have been using terms like coffin nails 15:21:24 5 and cancer sticks and nicotine fiend and nicotine fit going 15:21:28 6 back to the 1800s. 15:21:30 7 you heard that when we cross-examined their 15:21:33 8 witnesses. that is evidence that we are bringing to you. 15:21:35 9 you learned that it was common knowledge that 15:21:40 people knew before mrs. davis was ever born that smoking 15:21:44 was hard to quit. and it was such common knowledge that it 15:21:46 was communicated to her as a kid. 15:21:48 you learned about those 1950s studies that were 15:21:52 published in all of the magazines and newspapers linking 15:21:55 smoking to lung cancer when we cross-examined their 15:21:58 witnesses. 15:21:58 you learned that by 1954, 95 percent of americans 15:22:02 in 1954 had heard or read something to the effect that 15:22:07 smoking caused cancer. that was our evidence. 15:22:10 you were shown the document that talked about 15:22:14 addiction as a reason people smoked in 1959. and what you 15:22:18 learned when we cross-examined their witness was that the 15:22:21 person who wrote the document was simply copying down 15:22:25 reasons why people smoked that he read in a newspaper and 15:22:28 saw in surveys and that there was not any secret research 190 15:22:31 1 showing cigarette smoking was addictive. 15:22:35 2 what you learned in our cross-examinations was 15:22:37 3 that when the tobacco companies had a list of carcinogens 15:22:41 4 and cigarette smoke in the early 1960s -- they showed a 15:22:46 5 philip morris document, for example -- philip morris gave 15:22:48 6 that list of carcinogens over to the surgeon general. 15:22:52 7 and then the surgeon general then thanked philip 15:22:54 8 morris and thanked r.j. reynolds specifically for their 15:22:57 9 contributions to that 1964 report. 15:23:00 you learned about the warnings when we 15:23:03 cross-examined their experts. you learned about television 15:23:05 advertising coming off of tv and radio in 1971 when we 15:23:09 cross-examined their experts. 15:23:12 you learned about 30 million people quitting 15:23:15 smoking between 1964 and 1979 when we cross-examined their 15:23:20 experts. you also learned that one of those 30 million 15:23:23 people was mrs. davis' husband. 15:23:25 you learned that today somewhere between 55 and 65 15:23:28 million americans have quit smoking and that there are more 15:23:33 former smokers in this country than there are current 15:23:36 smokers. 15:23:36 and through our cross-examination of mrs. davis, 15:23:38 you learned all the stuff we just talked about, about how 15:23:41 she knew the risks of smoking, going back to when she was 15:23:45 25 years old. 191 15:23:46 1 and you also learned that her copd did not 15:23:50 2 manifest until 1998. that is what you learned yesterday 15:23:54 3 when we showed the medical records from mrs. davis' 15:24:00 4 doctors. 15:24:00 5 and that is the issue i want to turn to right now, 15:24:03 6 because its first on the verdict form. 15:24:05 7 and what i thought i would do is try to give you a 15:24:13 8 sense of the big picture on this issue right now. and then 15:24:17 9 i'm going to show you the documents. 15:24:18 so this is the timeline of the events, the 15:24:20 evidence relating to her copd. and you see here, there is a 15:24:24 thick line there. that is november 21, 1996. and, of 15:24:28 course, that is the important date, right, because she has 15:24:31 to prove that her copd manifested before that date. 15:24:34 so here's all the evidence showing that she had 15:24:39 copd before that date. and there is just nothing on there. 15:24:43 and i'm going to talk about dr. burns' testimony 15:24:45 since they talked about that. but there is no evidence. 15:24:48 there is no evidence that mrs. davis had copd before this 15:24:51 date. 15:24:52 all the evidence relating to her copd and her 15:24:57 shortness of breath comes after 1996. 15:25:04 so the story is, the relevant story is that 15:25:08 mrs. davis is an active-duty police officer in waldo from 15:25:12 1985 to february 22, 1998. 192 15:25:15 1 and on that day, she breaks her ribs. she breaks 15:25:19 2 her ribs on the job. she then goes and sees dr. velasquez. 15:25:24 3 dr. velasquez is her family doctor in gainesville. 15:25:28 4 and so she breaks her ribs. she is goes to see 15:25:32 5 dr. velasquez. and we know that sometime after this 15:25:34 6 happens, after february '98, she has her first pulmonary 15:25:39 7 function test. 15:25:41 8 now, you remember that pulmonary function test is 15:25:43 9 that breathing test that is used to see if somebody has 15:25:46 copd. dr. burns talks about it. 15:25:49 i'm going to show you mrs. davis' testimony. but 15:25:52 you may remember already from yesterday, she said she did 15:25:55 not have a test like that until after she quit the police 15:25:58 force. so after february 1998. 15:26:00 then a month later, she is in the hospital, and it 15:26:08 references the history of copd. 15:26:10 well, we know to diagnose copd she has to have a 15:26:13 pulmonary function test, because dr. burns talked about 15:26:16 that. and the record, which i'll show you, references her 15:26:19 having had one. 15:26:20 so she must have had that pulmonary function test 15:26:23 sometime in the month between february 22 and march 22, 15:26:32 1998, because we know the test was done after she quit the 15:26:32 police force but before she was in the hospital in march. 15:26:36 mr. byrd: objection, your honor. misstates 193 15:26:37 1 testimony. these are not dr. velasquez's records. 15:26:47 2 the court: no. the argument is being made 15:26:49 3 inferentially from a circumstantial basis. 15:26:56 4 so, ladies and gentlemen, you should understand as 15:26:56 5 to arguments from both counsel, and particularly on this 15:26:57 6 issue, that they are -- both counsel are trying to 15:27:04 7 reconstruct the relevant time period from inferences from 15:27:11 8 circumstantial evidence. 15:27:11 9 so that is perfectly permissible. under florida 15:27:17 law, doctors do not have to keep their records more than 15:27:19 five years. 15:27:21 some of them do, some of them do not. but you have 15:27:23 already heard that records from some periods are missing. 15:27:31 missing in a sense that we do not know where they are. the 15:27:33 doctor could have legitimately destroyed them or whatever. 15:27:36 so counsel for both sides can quite properly make 15:27:40 arguments to you that you should conclude that she 15:27:44 developed and manifested copd at x time or y time, and 15:27:50 you will make your own decision after you have heard all of the 15:27:54 arguments. 15:27:54 mr. mccarter: thank you, your honor. 15:27:55 mr. byrd: just to be clear, my objection is 15:27:57 referencing -- i'm happy to tell you at sidebar. i was not 15:28:00 referencing dr. velasquez's records. i was referencing 15:28:04 testimony. 194 15:28:05 1 the court: i think that is clear. there is no -- i 15:28:08 2 do not recall -- counsel can correct me if i'm wrong -- i 15:28:10 3 think that the record is clear that dr. velasquez's records 15:28:17 4 from this period are not available. 15:28:21 5 mr. byrd: the argument was that she saw 15:28:24 6 dr. velasquez in february and march of '98. using these 15:28:28 7 records, that is not true. those records are not from 15:28:31 8 dr. velasquez. 15:28:32 9 the court: well, i do not want you testifying. 15:28:39 i will hear you briefly at the sidebar. 15:28:41 (discussion at sidebar on the record.) 15:29:02 the court: he is making a circumstantial argument 15:29:04 as to when the test might have occurred. the only thing i 15:29:11 found at fault in defense counsel's thing was his statement 15:29:16 that there was no evidence. 15:29:19 that is really what you were saying is that there is 15:29:24 no evidence you should accept that she had copd because 15:29:29 there is documents in evidence which you are going to get 15:29:32 to. there was the reference about her history, which the 15:29:33 document shows. i do not see anything wrong with that 15:29:39 specifically. 15:29:42 mr. byrd: well, what he started saying was, he 15:29:43 said in march of '98, she saw dr. velasquez. and using 15:29:47 this and saying that that is where dr. velasquez did this. 15:29:54 in my record, it is not dr. velasquez. in fact, 195 15:29:55 1 there is no records from dr. velasquez. he is trying to make 15:29:59 2 it sound like february of '98 with the ribs. 15:30:02 3 the court: so when is the ribs? 15:30:04 4 mr. byrd: the ribs is february 22, '98. that is 15:30:07 5 not -- that is not dr. velasquez. it is the other doctor. 15:30:11 6 he said it was. 15:30:14 7 mr. mccarter: she testified yesterday that before 15:30:16 8 she went to the hospital, she saw dr. velasquez. she 15:30:20 9 referred her. that is what i'm talking about. 15:30:22 the court: i agree. i agree. that is what she 15:30:23 said. i agree. 15:30:25 overruled. 15:30:26 (end of discussion at sidebar.) 15:30:41 mr. mccarter: okay. back to the overview here, 15:30:42 and then i'll show you the actual documents. she has her 15:30:45 first pulmonary function test after 1998. that is a 15:30:48 necessary thing to diagnose somebody with copd, according 15:30:50 to dr. burns. that did not happen until 1998. 15:30:55 what about symptoms of copd? she talked about 15:30:59 being overheated in the sun when she was working traffic 15:31:02 duty. now, you are standing on hot asphalt and you are in 15:31:07 your late 50s in a hot police officer outfit and it is the 15:31:10 middle of summer. is it a surprise that you get 15:31:14 overheated? 15:31:15 was there any evidence -- is there any evidence 196 15:31:17 1 that the overheating was the result of copd? 15:31:19 2 what did she do when she got overheated? did she 15:31:24 3 go to a pulmonologist? no. she did not do that until after 15:31:27 4 1998. 15:31:28 5 she went in her car and turned on the air 15:31:30 6 conditioning just like anybody else would do. there is no 15:31:34 7 evidence tying that overheating to copd, no evidence at 15:31:37 8 all. 15:31:37 9 what the evidence is is that there was no 15:31:39 shortness of breath. by the time you get into the spring 15:31:43 of 1998, that is what she is telling her doctors. she is had 15:31:47 no problems breathing. july 1998. 15:31:49 then later she has another pulmonary function test 15:31:52 in august, and it suggests a diagnosis of emphysema. 15:31:57 suggests a diagnosis of emphysema. 15:31:59 and then we have a record saying shortness of 15:32:01 breath. not back before 1996. shortness of breath 15:32:05 recently. 15:32:07 so as you are looking for symptoms of copd, the 15:32:10 first shortness of breath report in the medical records is 15:32:15 1998, september, when it is recent. 15:32:19 so let us go through, because this is obviously -- 15:32:22 this is where i would submit to you that your deliberations 15:32:25 do start on this. this is question one. 15:32:28 but i would submit to you they start and end on 197 15:32:30 1 this question because there is just no evidence from which 15:32:33 2 you could conclude that she had copd by the date she needs 15:32:38 3 to prove it. 15:32:38 4 okay. so let us go on. when was the first 15:32:46 5 pulmonary function test, right? because she cannot be 15:32:49 6 diagnosed with copd until she has that test. 15:32:52 7 she testified she does not remember having such a 15:32:54 8 test until after she left the police force. that is 1998. 15:32:58 9 this is her testimony from yesterday, that she 15:33:01 remembers having a test done in 1998. she does not 15:33:04 remember having a breathing test done on her lungs before 15:33:07 that. 15:33:10 that is what the evidence is. so the first 15:33:13 pulmonary function test in evidence is 1998. 15:33:16 then we get to her march 22 record. past medical 15:33:20 history. remarkable for chronic obstructive pulmonary 15:33:24 disease. 15:33:25 now, counsel made a big deal of the word history, 15:33:27 like we are going back to christopher columbus or george 15:33:33 washington or something. but there was evidence to tell 15:33:34 you how far we are going back. 15:33:36 because what you know is that for her to have a 15:33:39 history of copd, she has to have had a pulmonary function 15:33:42 test. and we know the pulmonary function test was not 15:33:46 until after february of '98. so it had to be that one 198 15:33:50 1 month before. 15:33:51 2 is there other evidence that she had recently had 15:33:53 3 a pulmonary function test? 15:33:55 4 you bet. later in the record, it talks about she 15:33:58 5 has had pulmonary function tests here in this hospital and 15:34:02 6 that they suggested mild-to-moderate obstructive 15:34:07 7 ventilatory defect. 15:34:08 8 so put the evidence together, the test they are 15:34:11 9 referring to here that she has had is the one that she had 15:34:14 after she left the police force, in february of 1998. 15:34:22 continue forward, may 20, 1998, no shortness of 15:34:25 breath. but remember, she has those broken ribs. and when 15:34:28 she breathes in deeply, it hurts. it hurts. 15:34:31 now, i asked her about this record yesterday. and 15:34:33 she said, no, no, i did not tell my doctor i did not have 15:34:38 shortness of breath then. but i did tell him the rest of 15:34:39 the sentence. 15:34:40 she agreed that the rest of the sentence was 15:34:43 accurate. i submit to you that the whole sentence is 15:34:45 accurate and that she did not have shortness of breath, she 15:34:48 did not have symptoms of copd in may of 1998, a year and a 15:34:54 half after the cutoff on here. 15:34:56 july 1998, she has had no problems breathing. no 15:35:04 problems breathing, july 1998, except for when she breathes 15:35:09 in deeply, her ribs hurt. 199 15:35:11 1 this was another one. i do not remember telling my 15:35:13 2 doctor i did not have shortness of breath. but the rest of 15:35:15 3 the sentence is right. 15:35:16 4 the whole sentence is right. the doctor was not 15:35:19 5 making it up. she did not have symptoms of copd in july 15:35:24 6 1998. 15:35:29 7 but after that, something happens where she goes 15:35:31 8 into the hospital up in gainesville, and she does have 15:35:34 9 another pulmonary function test. that is the one where they 15:35:37 say it suggests diagnosis of emphysema. 15:35:40 she then goes to see a different doctor in 15:35:43 september, and she tells the doctor that she is having 15:35:47 shortness of breath recently. 15:35:48 so that is -- everything i talked about on this 15:35:51 timeline, you have just seen in the evidence. you have just 15:35:54 seen what the evidence shows, that everything points to the 15:35:58 copd manifesting after, well after, in fact, the cutoff. 15:36:05 now, there is another piece of evidence here, and 15:36:07 that comes from this medical record. because the doctor 15:36:12 went on to give her advice and said that she should be 15:36:18 evaluated by a pulmonologist. 15:36:21 and she said, well, i'd rather see my family 15:36:24 doctor. 15:36:24 and he said, well, that is fine, as long as they are 15:36:26 able to take care of your lungs. 200 15:36:28 1 and remember, i asked mrs. davis, i said, well, he 15:36:33 2 was giving you that advice because up until this point in 15:36:36 3 september of 1998 you did not -- you had not been seeing a 15:36:40 4 pulmonologist, right? 15:36:42 5 and she said -- she said, no, i had not been 15:36:46 6 seeing a pulmonologist before september 1998. 15:36:49 7 if she had lung problems, if she had copd, if she 15:36:54 8 had shortness of breath, would not she have been seeing a 15:36:56 9 pulmonologist during that time? 15:36:59 well, what she admits is that in september of 15:37:02 1998, getting close to two years after this cut-off, she 15:37:06 still had not been seeing a pulmonologist. 15:37:11 so on the question one on the verdict form, the 15:37:14 answer to this question is no. and if you check it no, 15:37:17 you are done. the case is over. and that is where, i 15:37:20 submit, the case ought to end. 15:37:22 there is no mention of mrs. davis having copd in 15:37:26 the medical records before 1998. 15:37:30 there is no testimony from any doctor who treated 15:37:32 her before 1998 that she had copd before then. absolutely 15:37:38 no evidence of that. and it is their burden of proof. 15:37:43 she did not have a pulmonary function test done 15:37:46 before 1998. she did not even have a pulmonologist she had 15:37:52 been seeing before 1998. 15:37:55 these problems with her lungs happened after 201 15:37:58 1 november 21, 1996. 15:38:01 2 so what about dr. burns? because that is what 15:38:05 3 they are hinging their case on on this. they are saying, 15:38:07 4 well, dr. burns said if you have a moderate level of copd, 15:38:11 5 you have had it for two or three years or three or four 15:38:14 6 years, whatever he said. 15:38:16 7 what they did not tell you about was the preface, 15:38:19 8 what dr. burns said before that. he was not talking about 15:38:23 9 mrs. davis. 15:38:24 they have this world-renown pulmonologist, and he 15:38:28 never told you that mrs. davis had copd before that date. 15:38:31 he never said that. what he said was he was 15:38:35 talking about on average. and he qualified it. he was 15:38:39 standing here on this chart. i remember standing over 15:38:42 there when he was doing it. 15:38:44 and he said, this is an average. whatever the 15:38:46 number was. it is an average. it is everybody. 15:38:51 individuals, not everybody follows the average. 15:38:54 some people decline, get into the copd category faster. 15:38:58 some people slower. it is just individual. 15:39:00 this case is not about when the average smoker 15:39:03 would have had copd. it is about when mrs. davis had copd. 15:39:08 and dr. burns said absolutely nothing about 15:39:12 mrs. davis. and there is no other evidence regarding 15:39:15 mrs. davis other than the evidence that points to 1998. 202 15:39:26 1 so, look, how do you reconcile the evidence in 15:39:28 2 this case? 15:39:29 3 look at what mrs. davis said, the facts and 15:39:31 4 circumstances that led her to go to her doctor regarding 15:39:36 5 her shortness of breath. and let us look at what the 15:39:38 6 evidence says as to when those things happened. 15:39:41 7 she testified yesterday that she had recent 15:39:45 8 shortness of breath, that she went to dr. velasquez, that 15:39:53 9 she had a pulmonary function test, that she visited 15:39:56 different doctors, and that she had copd and emphysema. 15:40:01 okay. so when did it happen, right? that is what 15:40:04 she said happened. let us talk about when it happened. we 15:40:07 just saw a recent shortness of breath, september 1998. 15:40:11 visited dr. velasquez in february/march 1998. first 15:40:18 pulmonary function test, 1998. 15:40:21 visited different doctors. we saw she visited a 15:40:25 dr. nelson and a dr. melton after visiting dr. velasquez, 15:40:29 1998. 15:40:34 copd/emphysema diagnosis in the medical records, 15:40:37 1998. 15:40:38 how do we explain it? i submit to you that the 15:40:41 explanation is what you saw yesterday from what mrs. davis 15:40:45 wrote after her deposition. 15:40:48 i'm not arguing that she is making up the sequence 15:40:50 of events as they happened. she just disremembered them. 203 15:40:56 1 we have the benefit of the medical records. this was 15, 15:40:58 2 20 years ago. and we know what the benefit of the medical 15:41:01 3 records is when things happened. 15:41:03 4 and when she was telling people dates and times in 15:41:05 5 her deposition, it was the same thing yesterday, that all 15:41:08 6 dates and times were guessed or estimated without actual 15:41:11 7 knowing. 15:41:12 8 and that explains why she is saying it was before 15:41:17 9 1996 and why all the evidence in the case says it was 1998. 15:41:20 so when you get to this question on the verdict 15:41:26 form, the answer to the question is no. 15:41:35 now, question two on the verdict form asks whether 15:41:37 the plaintiff has proved that she is addicted to nicotine. 15:41:40 and you have the definition the court has given 15:41:42 you. and i want to focus on a couple of elements of this. 15:41:45 one is they have to prove that she had a 15:41:48 compulsive need for and use of a habit-forming substance, 15:41:51 that she was compulsively smoking. she had a compulsive 15:41:57 need for cigarettes. 15:41:58 and they have to prove also that she had 15:42:00 well-defined physiological symptoms upon withdrawal. 15:42:04 they did not prove that she is addicted. 15:42:08 mrs. davis, there is no evidence that she was a compulsive 15:42:11 smoker. she was able to quit when she wanted to quit. 15:42:15 when she quit, she did not have withdrawal symptoms. 204 15:42:17 1 and dr. burns and dr. cummings, who they are 15:42:20 2 hinging their testimony on, the testimony is not credible. 15:42:26 3 mrs. davis, we saw the records where she is smoking 15:42:28 4 half a pack a day. we saw them when dr. cummings was here, 15:42:31 5 because remember they did not send dr. cummings those 15:42:33 6 records. and dr. cummings admitted that if he had seen 15:42:36 7 those records, he would have had to score her the lowest on 15:42:39 8 that part of his addiction test, not the highest, which he 15:42:42 9 did. 15:42:43 now, there is been different versions of this, but 15:42:46 one version is that mrs. davis, the medical records say she 15:42:50 was smoking half a pack a day or one pack a day for 15:42:53 50 years. that is one version of it. 15:42:55 the other version is that she was smoking more 15:42:57 than that in the past, but she cut down to half a pack a 15:43:01 day after she got sick. 15:43:02 i would submit to you either way, it shows she is 15:43:05 not a compulsive smoker. if she is limiting her smoking to 15:43:09 half a pack a day for 50 years, that is not compulsion. 15:43:13 if, instead, the other version is true that she 15:43:15 was smoking two or three packs a day and then cuts down to 15:43:18 half a pack a day and is able to stick with that, limit her 15:43:22 smoking to that for the next ten years, that shows she can 15:43:25 control her smoking. 15:43:26 but either way, there is no evidence that she was 205 15:43:28 1 compelled or driven or desperately needed cigarettes. she 15:43:33 2 was in control of her own smoking behavior at all times. 15:43:37 3 i'm going to -- these are the records that show -- 15:43:41 4 that we showed dr. cummings. i'm going to skip through 15:43:44 5 them. you have seen them. 15:43:45 6 there is also no evidence, keep in mind, 15:43:51 7 corroborating -- no other evidence, just mrs. davis' 15:43:54 8 say-so -- corroborating her testimony that she wanted to 15:44:00 9 quit smoking before 2005. 15:44:01 and there is no evidence corroborating her 15:44:03 testimony that she made a serious effort to quit before 15:44:06 2005. 15:44:07 there is no -- her testimony is the only evidence 15:44:08 on that. they did not bring you friends or family members 15:44:12 to back it up. and it is not backed up by any of the 15:44:16 medical records either. 15:44:16 we talked about this earlier, but when mrs. davis 15:44:21 wanted to quit in 2005, she did quit. and it was easy. 15:44:25 she threw everything away. and she was done with it. 15:44:29 she could quit when she wanted to quit. before 15:44:32 that, she had never gone 24 hours without smoking. she had 15:44:37 never thrown everything away. she talked about that liquid 15:44:39 concoction she got from the pharmacist that made the 15:44:43 cigarettes taste bad. what she did is she would let it 15:44:46 wear off and smoke. 206 15:44:48 1 she talked about the nicotine patch. when she 15:44:50 2 first got a prescription from her doctor for the patch, she 15:44:53 3 did not even go fill it. later she got a patch from the 15:44:57 4 health department. then she smoked while using the patch. 15:45:02 5 she would just take it off and smoke. 15:45:03 6 and then you remember the health department said 15:45:05 7 -- called her and asked her how her experience was. and 15:45:09 8 they said to her, if you are interested in quitting smoking, 15:45:12 9 if you want help, call us back. and she testified she 15:45:15 never called them back. when she wanted to quit, she just 15:45:18 quit in 2005. 15:45:22 and when she finally decided to quit, she woke up 15:45:26 one morning and decided she was not going to smoke anymore. 15:45:29 in 2005, she said, was when she finally made the 15:45:33 decision that she was going to quit smoking. 15:45:34 and when she finally made that decision, what 15:45:37 happened? she quit, and she quit for good. 15:45:40 she did not have any problem quitting. and when 15:45:46 she quit, she did not have withdrawal symptoms. 15:45:49 remember, dr. cummings testified, he was talking 15:45:51 about withdrawal symptoms and he reviewed records and he 15:45:55 reviewed testimony. 15:45:57 well, i asked dr. cummings, i said, is not it true 15:45:59 that the only withdrawal symptom you could find when you 15:46:03 looked at everything they gave you was that she gained some 207 15:46:06 1 weight afterward. 15:46:07 2 that is the only thing he could find in 2005 when 15:46:09 3 she quit. she gained some weight. 15:46:12 4 and you may want to look in the medical records 15:46:13 5 that are in evidence because you are actually not going to 15:46:17 6 find any evidence that she did gain weight after she quit 15:46:21 7 smoking. 15:46:23 8 and, finally, a few words about dr. burns and 15:46:26 9 dr. cummings. 15:46:29 they are paid millions of dollars in these cases. 15:46:33 dr. burns has been paid more than $3 million. dr. cummings 15:46:37 has been paid more than $1 million. 15:46:38 they did not even -- dr. burns was never 15:46:44 mrs. davis' doctor. neither of them talked to her, 15:46:47 interviewed her, interviewed any of her friends and family 15:46:50 before they said she was addicted. 15:46:51 dr. burns diagnosed her as addicted sitting in his 15:46:56 office 3,000 miles away in san diego, california, without 15:47:00 ever meeting her. they did not know her when she was 15:47:03 smoking. 15:47:06 and both of them admitted that in every case they 15:47:08 come and testify, when they are getting paid the $4,800 per 15:47:12 day, in every case, they always tell the jury the same 15:47:15 thing; the smoker was addicted. 15:47:17 do you have any doubt in your mind that when 208 15:47:21 1 dr. burns is getting paid $4,800 to testify, that he is not 15:47:26 2 going to come in and tell the jury that the smoker was 15:47:30 3 addicted? is there any doubt in your mind that he will 15:47:33 4 give that testimony? he says the same thing all the time. 15:47:36 5 both of them admit that not every smoker is 15:47:38 6 addicted, but when they are involved in a lawsuit, guess 15:47:41 7 what? every smoker is addicted. that is their testimony. 15:47:44 8 that is what they want you to find liability based on in 15:47:47 9 this case. 15:47:51 they have reviewed all the evidence that they had. 15:47:54 neither saw any evidence corroborating what mrs. davis was 15:47:57 saying about trying and trying to quit and failing. 15:48:01 dr. burns admitted it. the only one who says 15:48:08 mrs. davis tried to quit is mrs. davis. nobody else said 15:48:11 that in the materials he reviewed. 15:48:12 and their testimony was full of holes and 15:48:14 inconsistencies. i'm just going to cover a couple in the 15:48:16 interest of time. 15:48:17 but you remember dr. burns said on his direct that 15:48:21 mrs. davis was diagnosed by her doctors as addicted? 15:48:26 then on cross-examination he had to admit, you 15:48:29 could look through all the medical records you looked at, 15:48:31 and they say they sent him everything, and you are not going 15:48:34 to find the word addicted, addiction, addictive, anything 15:48:38 like that in the medical records. 209 15:48:39 1 because mrs. davis' doctors did not diagnose her 15:48:44 2 as addicted to nicotine. 15:48:46 3 the only people who diagnosed her are the people 15:48:49 4 who had never met her and are getting paid for their 15:48:51 5 testimony. 15:48:51 6 dr. burns also showed you this chart here, i 15:48:57 7 think, to convey that it is hard for people to quit smoking. 15:49:03 8 but what he had to admit was if he used the standard for 15:49:04 9 trying to quit that is used in this chart, by the rules of 15:49:07 the survey, you would have to classify mrs. davis as never 15:49:12 having made a quit attempt until 2005. 15:49:15 by the rules of the survey he used in his direct 15:49:16 examination, he told you she was trying to quit over and 15:49:19 over and over again, but the rules of his survey would not 15:49:23 count her as ever trying to quit until she did quit. 15:49:26 now, dr. cummings sat here and tried to say that 15:49:28 there was a reference in her medical records to her trying 15:49:31 to quit smoking. 15:49:32 you might remember he was sitting up there. he 15:49:34 had his medical records, and he is thumbing through and 15:49:36 thumbing through, and we are all sitting, waiting and 15:49:39 waiting and waiting for him to find one. 15:49:41 and then he finds one. and he has to admit it 15:49:44 does not say that she actually tried to quit. all it said 15:49:48 is that she said she will quit smoking. there is not a 210 15:49:52 1 single reference in her medical records that she ever tried 15:49:55 2 to quit smoking before she quit in 2005. 15:49:57 3 and, of course, with dr. cummings we had the 15:50:05 4 moments where he was shown medical records, after 15:50:08 5 testifying she wanted to quit and wanted to quit and wanted 15:50:11 6 to quit. 15:50:11 7 it turned out that the plaintiff's lawyers did not 15:50:14 8 send him the medical records where she told her doctor she 15:50:17 9 was not interested in quitting smoking. they did not give 15:50:20 that to him before he came here and said she wanted to 15:50:23 quit. 15:50:24 they did not give him the medical record from 2003 15:50:26 where she said she was confident she could quit smoking. 15:50:30 remember, this is year 18 of the supposed failure -- failed 15:50:34 quit attempt using waterpik filters. and she is telling her 15:50:37 doctor, i'm confident i can quit smoking. 15:50:39 they did not give that to dr. cummings. they 15:50:42 did not give him this one. she is not receptive to the 15:50:46 message to quit smoking. 15:50:48 and they did not give him any of those records that 15:50:51 we showed where she said she was smoking half a pack a day, 15:50:54 where she admitted if he had scored her using that, she 15:50:57 would have had the lowest level on his test, not the 15:51:00 highest level. 15:51:03 so the jury instruction requires you to find that 211 15:51:05 1 she was a compulsive smoker and that she had physiological 15:51:09 2 withdrawal symptoms. and there simply is not evidence of 15:51:12 3 either. 15:51:13 4 for that reason, if you get this far, if you get 15:51:15 5 past this question on the verdict form, your answer to 15:51:18 6 question two should be no as well. 15:51:20 7 the third question has to do with whether 15:51:24 8 plaintiff has proved that mrs. davis' addiction -- this 15:51:30 9 assumes you found her addicted -- was a legal cause of her 15:51:33 copd. and this is the instruction the court will give you. 15:51:38 that question gets at if she was addicted, was she 15:51:41 heavily addicted? was she addicted enough that her 15:51:45 addiction contributed substantially to her continuing to 15:51:48 smoke so that if she had not been addicted, she would not 15:51:56 have gotten copd? 15:51:57 and we have gone through a lot of the evidence 15:51:59 relating to this. but mrs. davis' addiction was not a 15:52:04 cause of her copd, and she smoked because she enjoyed 15:52:07 smoking. that is why she smoked. she did not smoke because 15:52:09 of an addiction. 15:52:10 mr. byrd: objection. violation of jury 15:52:14 instructions. causation. 15:52:22 the court: so i'm going to just read you in 15:52:23 advance to clarify this, ladies and gentlemen, that -- that 15:52:27 portion of my instruction that deals with legal causation. 212 15:52:33 1 i think you have already seen it on the board. 15:52:38 2 but one of the things that you will be asked is 15:52:45 3 whether or not the plaintiff has shown that it is more 15:52:48 4 likely than not, quote, that her addiction was a legal 15:52:53 5 cause of her copd in the sense that her continued smoking 15:52:59 6 of cigarettes was, at least in part, a natural and direct 15:53:06 7 result of her addiction. 15:53:07 8 in this regard, plaintiff need not prove that 15:53:12 9 addiction was the only reason miss davis continued to smoke 15:53:16 cigarettes. 15:53:16 she may, for example, have partly smoked them 15:53:21 because she enjoyed smoking. but plaintiff must prove that 15:53:24 her addiction contributed substantially to her continuing 15:53:29 to smoke so that but for the addiction, her copd would not 15:53:34 have occurred. 15:53:34 so the -- i do not think -- what you have seen is 15:53:46 counsel for the plaintiff emphasize one part of that 15:53:48 instruction, defense counsel's emphasizing a different part 15:53:53 of that instruction. 15:53:54 when you get it, you should look at the 15:53:56 instruction as a whole. that is the way to figure out the 15:54:00 answer to these questions. 15:54:01 but counsel may continue. 15:54:04 mr. mccarter: thank you, your honor. 15:54:05 addiction did not prevent mrs. davis from quitting 213 15:54:07 1 because she was not interested in quitting smoking. and 15:54:14 2 the cause of her copd, mrs. davis' free choice is what 15:54:18 3 caused her to smoke cigarettes and ultimately to get copd. 15:54:22 4 so if you get this far in the verdict form, your 15:54:26 5 answer should be no. 15:54:27 6 i'm going to skip to question five because 15:54:33 7 miss patterson is going to talk about question four. 15:54:35 8 question five gets to this allocation of fault 15:54:39 9 that was talked about earlier. 15:54:41 and if you get this far, i've asked you to 15:54:43 consider mrs. davis' own statements about her smoking, what 15:54:47 she knew about it, why she smoked, whether she wanted to 15:54:51 quit, when you consider this question. 15:54:53 because this is what she said to people when they 15:54:57 talk to her about her smoking: 15:54:58 leave me alone. 15:55:00 i know it is bad for my health. 15:55:03 it is my decision to smoke. 15:55:04 i enjoy smoking. 15:55:08 i do not want to quit. 15:55:11 i'll quit smoking when i want to quit smoking. 15:55:16 those are statements made by somebody who is 15:55:20 one hundred percent responsible for the choices they make and the 15:55:24 consequences that flow from those choices. 15:55:29 that is what people say when they are responsible 214 15:55:30 1 for their choices. it is their decision. they know it is 15:55:34 2 bad for them. they want to do it. they will stop doing it 15:55:38 3 when they do not want to do it anymore. and that was 15:55:41 4 mrs. davis. 15:55:45 5 and so if you get this far in the verdict form, i 15:55:47 6 would ask you to put down one hundred percent of the responsibility 15:55:51 7 on mrs. davis, 0 percent on philip morris, 0 percent on 15:55:59 8 r.j. reynolds. 15:56:00 9 mr. byrd: objection, your honor. improper legal 15:56:01 argument. 15:56:13 the court: we will take this up at the end of 15:56:15 summation. 15:56:16 mr. mccarter: now, plaintiff's counsel talked 15:56:18 about, well, they are going to come up here and say it is all 15:56:21 her fault. they are going to blame mrs. davis for her 15:56:24 smoking. 15:56:25 i am not blaming mrs. davis. i am not blaming 15:56:28 mrs. davis. but she filed this lawsuit. and she is 15:56:30 one hundred percent responsible for the choices she made and the 15:56:34 consequences that flow from those choices. 15:56:36 on the verdict form, the next questions, six and 15:56:42 eight, get at the same issue. it is this fraudulent 15:56:46 concealment and the conspiracy claim. and i want to show 15:56:48 you one of the important instructions here. 15:56:50 and that is what the plaintiff has to prove is 215 15:56:54 1 that the defendant created the misimpression that cigarette 15:56:56 2 smoking was not a health hazard or was not addictive. 15:57:02 3 there is no evidence that mrs. davis ever had a 15:57:05 4 misimpression about either of those things. 15:57:06 5 she did not testify that she was confused about 15:57:09 6 the risks of smoking at some point in time or she was 15:57:11 7 confused about addiction. there is absolutely no evidence 15:57:14 8 that mrs. davis was ever confused about anything. 15:57:17 9 the second half of this -- they have to prove 15:57:20 both -- is that she has to prove that she relied on a 15:57:23 misrepresentation and decided to continue to smoke. 15:57:27 that is where we get out of this issue of did she 15:57:30 actually hear and rely upon -- did she rely upon anything 15:57:33 the tobacco company said about the health risks of smoking? 15:57:37 and i covered this earlier, but the answer is 15:57:41 good. this is from her own testimony. this is from her 15:57:45 own testimony, and it is an admission that these questions 15:57:48 must be answered no. 15:57:49 she does not remember seeing or hearing a statement 15:57:52 from anyone from the tobacco companies at any time. 15:57:58 and we have gone through this, but you know she knew 15:58:01 from the mid-1960s on that smoking was dangerous. and 15:58:06 you have seen this evidence and heard it over and over again, 15:58:09 the warnings. 15:58:10 she heard about cancer sticks. what she talked 216 15:58:13 1 about with her sons and doctor and husband. what she 15:58:15 2 talked about with fran craft and her doctors in 2004 when 15:58:19 3 she said she did not want to quit. 15:58:21 4 advertising did not influence her to start smoking 15:58:24 5 or to smoke either. i've gone through that. 15:58:26 6 and so on these questions, the answer should be 15:58:29 7 not liable as well, if you make it this far. 15:58:32 8 compensatory damages. you should know that the 15:58:37 9 plaintiffs are not asking for any money for mrs. davis' 15:58:42 medical bills. they are not asking for money for medical 15:58:45 bills. they are not asking for money for lost income when 15:58:48 she could not work. 15:58:49 what they are asking for is that $7 million for 15:58:52 pain and suffering that they say should be computed based 15:58:56 on how many puffs she took off a cigarette. 15:58:59 you are going to read the jury instructions. the 15:59:01 number of puffs she took off a cigarette have nothing to do 15:59:03 with it. it is completely irrelevant to that calculation. 15:59:07 and the $7 million is ridiculous. 15:59:10 finally, there is a question on punitive damages on 15:59:13 here. and this has a higher standard that the plaintiffs 15:59:17 have to prove by clear and convincing evidence. there is 15:59:20 going to be an instruction in the packet about clear and 15:59:23 convincing evidence. 15:59:25 but they proved nothing in this case about clear 217 15:59:27 1 and convincing evidence. and they certainly did not prove 15:59:30 2 that they should get more money in the form of punitive 15:59:33 3 damages. 15:59:34 4 so that question also should be no. 15:59:35 5 now, i want to talk about two more things. and 15:59:43 6 that is i think -- i'm not sure we needed dr. kyriakoudes 15:59:47 7 here for three or four hours to talk about things that had 15:59:50 8 nothing to do with mrs. davis. but he had something useful 15:59:54 9 to say, i submit, on this historical method. 15:59:56 and what he said is if you actually want to know, 15:59:59 get accurate information about what happened in the past, 16:00:01 what you do is you look at what people were saying and 16:00:04 doing at the time. 16:00:05 and i asked him, i said, well, that statement 16:00:08 applies not just to tobacco companies but to individuals. 16:00:12 and he agreed. 16:00:13 and that is essentially your task, is to go back 16:00:17 and try to figure out what is the truth with respect to 16:00:20 mrs. davis' smoking and her copd several years ago. 16:00:24 so i would submit what you ought to do is to look 16:00:27 at what she was saying back then, what she was telling her 16:00:30 friends and her doctors, and what her medical records say, 16:00:32 not what people are saying now that a lawsuit is filed and 16:00:35 you want $7 million. what people were saying at the time, 16:00:38 before they had no interest and maybe twisting things in a 218 16:00:44 1 way that might help their case. 16:00:45 2 and if you do that in this case, what you see is 16:00:48 3 that she knew smoking was bad for her health. she was 16:00:51 4 warned for 39 years. there is no evidence that anybody saw 16:00:54 5 her try to quit smoking. she never told anybody. there is 16:00:57 6 no evidence she told anybody she wanted to quit smoking. 16:01:00 7 what she told people is that she enjoyed smoking 16:01:05 8 and did not want to quit. and the records show she did not 16:01:08 9 have shortness of breath and copd until 1998. 16:01:12 now, the whole time i've been here, i've been 16:01:14 resisting the temptation to grab that board and bring it 16:01:16 over here. and i'm going to do it. i know you have seen it 16:01:19 enough, but i want to point out one thing to you. 16:01:36 do you remember when dr. burns was here? he was 16:01:38 asked to assume that she had copd in 1993 and 1994. 16:01:46 remember when he was asked to assume it. they did not have 16:01:49 evidence of it. they said assume it. and i guess they will 16:01:52 put on evidence later. 16:01:53 what they did here is they wrote on here, and they 16:01:57 left room. for what? what did they leave room for? a 16:01:59 sticky. where is the sticky? if they proved she had copd 16:02:04 back then, where is the sticky? they would have put it on 16:02:08 there. 16:02:09 that is enough to show you that in addition to all 16:02:11 the other evidence, when you go in the jury room, ask 219 16:02:14 1 yourself, where is the sticky? because if they had given 16:02:17 2 you evidence she had copd back then, you know, you know 16:02:20 3 they would have put a sticky on there. 16:02:22 4 they certainly did not run out of paper. it is 16:02:24 5 because there is no evidence, there is no evidence that she 16:02:28 6 had copd before november 1996. 16:02:32 7 and as i said earlier, i submit that is the first 16:02:35 8 question and the last question you need to answer in this 16:02:38 9 case. 16:02:41 so i appreciate your time and your attention. 16:02:43 and when you go back into the jury room, i ask you 16:02:46 to return a verdict for my client, philip morris, and for 16:02:50 miss patterson's client, r.j. reynolds. 16:02:51 thank you very much. closing argument by the defense 16:03:19 ms. patterson: may it please the court? 16:03:20 good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. it is a 16:03:23 pleasure to speak with you all again. as you know, my name 16:03:25 is jordon patterson, and i represent r.j. reynolds tobacco 16:03:30 company. and you probably know at this point that i'm 16:03:33 going to be brief today. 16:03:34 before i begin, i just want to take a moment to 16:03:37 sincerely thank you for the time that you spent, your 220 16:03:40 1 service in this case. and i want to thank you personally 16:03:42 2 and on behalf of my client, reynolds. 16:03:46 3 now, during opening statements, i said that you 16:03:49 4 would not hear a lot from me during this trial, one, because 16:03:53 5 mr. mccarter would go first and he could cover the points, 16:03:55 6 and i want to be respectful of your time and not waste your 16:03:58 7 time. 16:03:58 8 so mr. mccarter just thoroughly walked you through 16:04:02 9 the evidence in this case. and what he said applies with 16:04:05 equal force to reynolds, so i do not want to retread that 16:04:09 ground. 16:04:09 but you also did not hear a lot from me in this 16:04:12 case for another reason. and that is because miss davis did 16:04:16 not smoke reynolds cigarettes for any substantial amount of 16:04:22 time, and that is what i want to focus on this afternoon. 16:04:25 now, you are going to hear from judge rakoff that 16:04:27 you all are the judges of the facts. and when it comes to 16:04:30 my client, the facts are of critical importance. and 16:04:34 plaintiff has the burden to prove those facts to you. 16:04:37 now, inside of a courtroom, in a lawsuit for money 16:04:40 damages, plaintiffs must give you proof. and there just 16:04:44 is not much proof in this case about miss davis' use of my 16:04:48 client's cigarettes. 16:04:49 so when i talked to you last time at the beginning 16:04:51 of this case, i told you that the only conclusion that 221 16:04:55 1 you would be able to draw from the evidence about my client, 16:04:58 2 reynolds, is that to the extent miss davis smoked reynolds' 16:05:03 3 cigarettes, it was not for a long amount of time and it was 16:05:05 4 a very long time ago. 16:05:07 5 so what did we hear from miss davis about 16:05:10 6 reynolds' brands? 16:05:12 7 can we have the first slide, please? thank you. 16:05:16 8 when miss davis first started, she puffed on 16:05:20 9 cigarettes that her older brother had hidden under the 16:05:22 house. she was not a regular smoker at this point in time. 16:05:25 she was not really smoking at all. she was not inhaling. 16:05:28 she said she was just puffing. 16:05:29 she testified that her brother had a box of 16:05:32 cigarettes, and in that box were a couple of different 16:05:37 brands. there was some marlboro, some philip morris, 16:05:40 camel, and pall mall cigarettes. 16:05:42 and only two of those brands were reynolds brands, 16:05:46 pall mall and camel. 16:05:48 now, miss davis testified that she only smoked 16:05:53 pall mall one time. that is it. that is all plaintiff told 16:05:56 you about pall mall. 16:05:58 now, what about camel? camel was just one of 16:06:01 several brands that were in her brother's box of cigarettes 16:06:04 when she first started. 16:06:05 and miss davis did not tell you that she ever 222 16:06:07 1 smoked camel exclusively. she was smoking other brands at 16:06:13 2 the same time. 16:06:13 3 and out of those many different brands, camel was 16:06:15 4 not her preferred brand. in fact, miss davis testified 16:06:19 5 that in the beginning of her smoking, she already had a 16:06:21 6 preference for a different brand, not camel. 16:06:24 7 plaintiff did not bring you any proof that 16:06:27 8 miss davis smoked a reynolds cigarette after that period 16:06:32 9 when she first started smoking. 16:06:34 her only testimony as to when she smoked camels 16:06:36 was when she first started smoking. that is all you heard. 16:06:40 that is all the proof that plaintiff brought. and you cannot 16:06:43 assume that she smoking any brand, much less a reynolds 16:06:46 brand, at any point in time unless plaintiff proves this. 16:06:50 and she did not. 16:06:50 now, the summary i just gave you is the extent of 16:06:53 the testimony that miss davis gave about my client's 16:06:57 brands. 16:06:57 so looking at the evidence, the absolute most that 16:07:01 you can fairly conclude is that miss davis smoked reynolds 16:07:06 cigarettes for about a year, because she only smoked camel 16:07:09 right when she first started smoking. she was not even 16:07:12 inhaling. and she was not smoking camels exclusively. she 16:07:16 was smoking other brands as well. 16:07:17 so that is about a year out of a 55-year smoking 223 16:07:21 1 history. 16:07:23 2 now, you have also heard no evidence that miss davis 16:07:26 3 had any abnormal lung function when she was smoking or 16:07:30 4 puffing reynolds cigarettes. 16:07:34 5 and that is important because dr. burns testified 16:07:36 6 that if a smoker quits while they still have normal lung 16:07:40 7 function, they will not develop copd. 16:07:42 8 so that means that if miss davis quit smoking all 16:07:46 9 together, when she stopped smoking reynolds cigarettes, she 16:07:50 would not have gotten copd. 16:07:51 now, i would like to focus on our chart about what 16:07:54 we heard about the limited amount that she smoked. and i'm 16:07:57 going to tell you why that is important to my client and why 16:08:00 it is important for you guys to understand why that, that 16:08:04 limited amount, matters. and it is because of something 16:08:07 called legal cause. 16:08:08 and as judge rakoff will tell you in some of his 16:08:11 instructions, plaintiff has the burden to prove to you that 16:08:14 smoking reynolds cigarettes was sufficient to be a legal 16:08:17 cause of her copd. 16:08:20 now, legal cause is a cause, like the way that you 16:08:25 or i might use it, it is a term that has special legal 16:08:29 significance. and you will hear that in judge rakoff's 16:08:31 instruction. 16:08:32 you will hear that plaintiff must prove that smoking 224 16:08:37 1 r.j. reynolds cigarettes substantially contributed to 16:08:40 2 miss davis' copd. 16:08:42 3 so look for that language when you hear it from 16:08:45 4 the judge. and i want to show you now where that is going 16:08:47 5 to fit on the verdict form. and that is going to be 16:08:49 6 question number four. 16:08:50 7 so, again, i'm not going to go back over the 16:08:52 8 evidence that mr. mccarter has already talked with you 16:08:54 9 about. for the reasons he discussed, you should not even 16:08:57 get to this question. you should answer no to the first 16:09:02 three questions. 16:09:03 but if you get here, this is where you will have to 16:09:06 decide if cigarettes made by my client, reynolds, were a 16:09:09 legal cause of miss davis' copd. 16:09:11 now, as you know, plaintiff has the burden to 16:09:15 prove that smoking my client's cigarettes legally caused or 16:09:18 substantially contributed to mrs. davis' copd. 16:09:22 so listen for that language in judge rakoff's 16:09:25 instructions. a moment ago, you heard from plaintiff's 16:09:30 counsel, and i believe that he said that the essential part 16:09:33 of this question is whether or not miss davis smoked any 16:09:38 cigarettes made by reynolds or philip morris. 16:09:40 and i'd ask you to pay close attention to judge 16:09:45 rakoff's instructions when he gives them to you. and when 16:09:49 you go back in the jury room, look at those instructions, 225 16:09:51 1 and i think you will find that more proof is required than 16:09:54 2 plaintiff insinuated. 16:09:56 3 so based on the limited evidence that plaintiff 16:09:57 4 brought you, you cannot fairly conclude that smoking 16:10:01 5 reynolds cigarettes was a substantial contribution to her 16:10:04 6 copd. 16:10:04 7 now, i would like to offer you a way to think 16:10:07 8 about whether something is a substantial contribution. 16:10:13 9 i'm a coffee person, so i'm going to use that as 16:10:16 an example. so imagine that you and a friend decide that 16:10:19 you really, really want a cup of coffee. and only the best 16:10:23 will do. so where are you going to go, other than seattle, 16:10:28 washington, to get the best cup of coffee you can? 16:10:32 so you start your road trip. your friend starts 16:10:35 driving. things are going pretty smoothly. and about an 16:10:37 hour in, your friend decides that she is tired of driving 16:10:40 and she asks you to drive. 16:10:42 now, this is a 55-hour trip from ocala, florida, 16:10:50 to seattle, washington. so do you know how far that you have 16:10:53 gotten into this 55-hour trip when your friend tells you 16:10:56 that she is tired of driving? 16:10:58 you have gotten to just a little bit north of 16:11:00 gainesville if you left from ocala. that is not even to the 16:11:03 florida-georgia line. 16:11:05 you are still going to have to drive through 226 16:11:07 1 florida, through georgia, tennessee, missouri, all the way 16:11:10 2 up iowa/nebraska border, across south dakota, across 16:11:15 3 montana, through idaho. and then you are finally going to 16:11:19 4 go through washington until you finally get to seattle, and 16:11:22 5 you finally get your delicious cup of coffee. 16:11:25 6 now, would you say that your friend who stopped 16:11:27 7 driving 54 hours ago when you were only an hour away from 16:11:30 8 ocala substantially contributed to driving this trip? i 16:11:35 9 would suggest no. 16:11:36 the same is true here. at most, reynolds' 16:11:40 contribution in this case is no greater than the friend's 16:11:45 contribution in the cross-country road trip in my example. 16:11:48 the one year that miss davis smoked reynolds 16:11:51 cigarettes out of the 55 years that she smoked was not a 16:11:54 substantial contribution to her developing copd. 16:11:57 and there is another question on the verdict form 16:11:59 where you should consider the limited amount of reynolds 16:12:03 brands that miss davis smoked, and that is going to be -- 16:12:09 will you pull up the next slide, please? 16:12:11 it is going to be on question number five. 16:12:16 so the evidence will show -- or with everything 16:12:18 that mr. mccarter has already talked with you about, those 16:12:21 reasons are going to apply equally to reynolds. 16:12:24 but for an additional reason, reynolds should have 16:12:27 zero responsibility. and that is because of the limited 227 16:12:29 1 amount that she smoked. and for the additional reason that 16:12:32 2 you heard from dr. burns, that if she had quit smoking 16:12:36 3 before she ever developed any lung decline, which is when 16:12:39 4 she would have been smoking reynolds cigarettes, she would 16:12:42 5 not have gotten copd. 16:12:44 6 mr. byrd: objection, your honor. same objection 16:12:47 7 you said we would discuss -- 16:12:48 8 the court: all right. 16:12:51 9 mr. byrd: -- after summation. 16:12:53 the court: go ahead. 16:12:55 ms. patterson: now, i want to move forward 16:12:56 quickly to some other questions on the verdict form. and 16:12:58 mr. mccarter and i agree that you should not even get to 16:13:01 these questions. 16:13:01 but if you do, i would like to ask you to focus on 16:13:05 one word, and that word is relied. 16:13:07 now, this key word relied is going to be in judge 16:13:12 rakoff's instructions. so listen to those and then look 16:13:15 for it on the jury instructions when you go back to the 16:13:18 jury room. 16:13:18 the judge's instructions require you -- or require 16:13:21 plaintiff to prove to you that plaintiff relied on 16:13:23 something that reynolds said or did. it had to make 16:13:27 miss davis take some kind of action. and it is only about 16:13:31 miss davis, not someone else. 228 16:13:32 1 that miss davis got copd because she relied on 16:13:36 2 something that reynolds said or did. and miss davis simply 16:13:41 3 has not proven this. 16:13:42 4 now, first, there is no evidence that miss davis 16:13:44 5 ever heard or read any statement from a tobacco company. 16:13:49 6 none of the advertisements or tobacco companies' statements 16:13:52 7 that plaintiff's counsel showed you had anything to do with 16:13:55 8 the choices that miss davis made. 16:13:57 9 so let us talk for a minute about the evidence that 16:13:59 plaintiff did bring you. you heard from dr. kyriakoudes, 16:14:01 who knew nothing about miss davis. 16:14:04 in fact, he told you himself that his opinion was 16:14:06 not specific to miss davis in any way. he showed you 16:14:10 advertisements that were from before she was born and for 16:14:13 brands that she never smoked. 16:14:15 maybe you will remember the flintstone ad that 16:14:17 advertised winston cigarettes. she did not watch 16:14:21 flintstones. she did not smoke winstons. you did not hear 16:14:25 that from plaintiff. 16:14:26 and dr. cummings and dr. burns showed you various 16:14:29 documents and statements from tobacco companies, but 16:14:31 neither one of them said that miss davis heard or saw, much 16:14:35 less relied on, any of those. 16:14:37 and remember relied is the key word that you are 16:14:39 looking for. 229 16:14:40 1 in fact, many of the documents and the video clips 16:14:43 2 that plaintiff's lawyer showed you were well after 16:14:47 3 miss davis stopped smoking or puffing reynolds cigarettes. 16:14:50 4 for example, you were shown an advertisement in 16:14:54 5 the "new york times." it was called, can we have an open 16:14:58 6 debate about smoking? 16:14:59 7 you did not hear any evidence that miss davis read 16:15:01 8 the "new york times." and you did not hear any evidence 16:15:04 9 that she saw this article. 16:15:05 and this was at least 20 years after she had 16:15:08 stopped smoking reynolds cigarettes. 16:15:11 the same thing happened when they showed you a 16:15:14 snippet of congressional testimony in 1994. you did not 16:15:17 hear that miss davis ever heard that testimony. and this 16:15:19 was at least 30 years after she had stopped smoking 16:15:22 reynolds cigarettes. 16:15:24 so who is the one who could have told you whether 16:15:26 she relied? it is miss davis herself. 16:15:29 so what did miss davis say about whether she 16:15:31 relied? she said she did not hear or read any statement 16:15:35 from a tobacco company. 16:15:37 mr. byrd: objection, your honor. misstates 16:15:40 testimony about statement from a person or -- 16:15:45 the court: yeah, i think -- i do think that is an 16:15:47 overstatement on counsel's part. but the jury's 230 16:15:49 1 recollection will recall. but i think the evidence was not 16:15:58 2 quite as unequivocal as counsel remembers. but we will let 16:16:02 3 the jury decide. 16:16:04 4 ms. patterson: she also said that she did not 16:16:05 5 start smoking because of an advertisement. in fact, the 16:16:09 6 evidence was quite the opposite. 16:16:10 7 she said she started smoking because her brother, 16:16:13 8 her older brother, gave her cigarettes. and she told you 16:16:16 9 that she never bought a brand of cigarettes based on an 16:16:20 advertisement. 16:16:21 you saw some camel advertisements yesterday. but 16:16:24 none of those camel advertisements impacted her brain 16:16:27 choice. and that is because she was already smoking camel. 16:16:30 so something that she saw after she already began 16:16:33 smoking a brand could not have influenced her decision to 16:16:35 start. 16:16:36 so plaintiff's theory is that reynolds has -- if 16:16:41 reynolds had said something publicly that was in its 16:16:44 internal documents, that that would have somehow made a 16:16:46 difference to miss davis. but the story just does not add 16:16:49 up. 16:16:51 miss davis is the type of person who, when her 16:16:53 friends and her family members would urge her to quit, she 16:16:56 would say, leave me alone. and she would say, i'll quit 16:17:03 when i get ready. she said she loved smoking. that is the 231 16:17:06 1 type of person that miss davis is. 16:17:08 2 for these reasons, you should mark no to question 16:17:10 3 number six and question number eight. because no reliance 16:17:15 4 means no liability. 16:17:21 5 now, there is also one additional reason i'd like 16:17:25 6 to talk to you about there. and mr. byrd and plaintiff's 16:17:27 7 experts spent a great deal of time talking with you about 16:17:31 8 filtered cigarettes. 16:17:32 9 and i'm not going to spend any time talking about 16:17:33 that for one simple reason, and that is because miss davis 16:17:37 never smoked a single cigarette that was filtered by my 16:17:40 client. she never smoked one filtered reynolds brand. 16:17:44 both the camel and the pall mall cigarettes that 16:17:46 she smoked were unfiltered. 16:17:48 now, mr. byrd has suggested an award of an 16:17:55 enormous amount of money against my client, reynolds, 16:17:57 despite the fact miss davis only smoked a reynolds product 16:18:02 about a year out of a 55-year smoking history. 16:18:06 my client should not pay any money for the limited 16:18:08 amount of smoking history. you should not award miss davis 16:18:13 any money from reynolds based on these facts that you have 16:18:16 heard in this case. 16:18:17 reynolds did not substantially contribute to 16:18:20 mrs. davis' copd. and if she had chosen to quit smoking 16:18:24 cigarettes altogether when she stopped smoking reynolds 232 16:18:27 1 brand, she would not have copd today. 16:18:29 2 so for all the reasons that mr. mccarter talked 16:18:31 3 with you about, and that i talked with you about, i'm 16:18:34 4 asking you to return a defense verdict in favor of r.j. 16:18:40 5 reynolds. 16:18:40 6 thank you very much for your service and for your 16:18:42 7 attention.
