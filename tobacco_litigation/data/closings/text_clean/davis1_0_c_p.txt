closing argument by the plaintiff 13:15:19 mr. byrd: good afternoon, everybody. and we 13:15:20 thank you for your time. it is not much longer now. and we 13:15:23 appreciate all the listening that you have done. 13:15:27 we know we gave you a lot of evidence, a lot of 13:15:30 materials. and i want to explain to you for a little bit 13:15:32 why i think it is all relevant and why i think it plays into 13:15:35 your decision making. 13:15:36 so i hope -- i said at the beginning of this trial 13:15:40 that i thought that by the time this trial was over that 13:15:43 everyone would have learned something they did not know 13:15:47 about cigarettes and about this history of cigarettes that 13:15:50 everybody sort of has ideas about and think they know 102 13:15:53 1 about, but maybe they have not seen all this material. 13:15:56 2 and i promised you that we would see some 13:15:58 3 documents that not a lot of people have seen. and, of 13:16:02 4 course, we could not bring you ten courtrooms full of 13:16:06 5 documents. we would be here for a year to do that. but we 13:16:10 6 tried to bring you samples and examples. 13:16:13 7 and that is why, i hope you remember, our experts 13:16:16 8 testified several times that there were -- you know, i 13:16:19 9 would ask them about an example. they would say there are 13:16:22 hundreds of examples like this. 13:16:24 so there is plenty more evidence in the record that 13:16:26 we did not have time to bring you, but that we tried to pick 13:16:29 out some of the most -- the ones that were the good 13:16:32 examples of that. 13:16:34 in a little bit this afternoon, but probably more 13:16:38 likely tomorrow given our timing, you are going to begin the 13:16:40 real hard work in this case. and that is your 13:16:44 deliberations. and nothing could be more important. 13:16:47 miss davis is truly proud, and i'm proud to be 13:16:51 here on her behalf, and her team, to get her day in court 13:16:54 and present her case to you. 13:16:55 and when you do those deliberations, you know, 13:17:01 they are not easy. but they are important. this is a -- 13:17:05 this is a hugely important case. 13:17:08 mr. mccarter: objection. 103 13:17:12 1 the court: overruled. 13:17:15 2 mr. byrd: and when, you know -- we have people 13:17:18 3 say all the time, there is three branches of government: 13:17:20 4 there is the executive, the congressional. we have heard 13:17:23 5 different things from the surgeon general's office, from 13:17:28 6 congress, and things like that. 13:17:29 7 and then there is the third branch, which is this 13:17:31 8 branch, the judicial branch. and in our country, the 13:17:33 9 judge, at least in this case, the judge does not make the 13:17:36 decision here. you are. you are the judge. you are the 13:17:39 third branch. you are the third branch of government today 13:17:42 for miss davis and for the defendants, to make the 13:17:47 determinations about this case and the years and years of 13:17:50 history that we have tried to show you. 13:17:51 and so when you -- the judge will instruct you on 13:17:57 the law. i'm going to give you my interpretation of that. 13:18:00 but obviously if there is ever anything that i pass over or 13:18:03 go too quick or i say something a little bit differently 13:18:07 than it was, we are going to try to show you what his 13:18:08 instructions are. the judge rules. the judge is the final 13:18:10 word on what the law is. 13:18:11 and i say that because it is important. and, john, 13:18:14 if you can put up the instructions. 13:18:17 in this case, when you deliberate -- and you made 13:18:24 this vow when you came to court the first day. i do not 104 13:18:27 1 know if you remember, but the judge asked several questions 13:18:29 2 of you all, about whether you could put aside biases, to 13:18:33 3 make sure that we get a fair day in trial. 13:18:35 4 and all of you swore that, you know, you can put 13:18:37 5 anything aside. you can come in here. you know, if you 13:18:40 6 get back in the jury room and you think you are doing 13:18:45 7 deliberations and somebody starts bringing in biases, you 13:18:48 8 know, they do not believe people should be -- get to file 13:18:51 9 lawsuits like that, that this is wrong, things like that 13:18:54 that you know the judge has already said you are supposed to 13:18:56 leave at the door, i hope you remind them. 13:18:58 there is a jury instruction -- 13:19:00 can you show us? can you zoom in on that? 13:19:03 -- that regardless of the law, it is your sworn 13:19:06 duty to follow the law as i give it to you. 13:19:08 i, meaning the court. that is his instructions. 13:19:11 it is going to be his instructions. 13:19:12 and you can point them back, that the way we make 13:19:14 our decisions in a court of law, and in this case, no 13:19:17 matter what your biases are, is with the jury instructions. 13:19:20 and you have to follow just those and nothing else. 13:19:23 and if somebody is unable to do that, that is 13:19:26 something that the judge will instruct you how to do this, 13:19:28 how you can bring it to the court's attention. 13:19:31 and so we hope you use the jury instructions as a 105 13:19:35 1 guidebook. it is the guidebook for you to deliberate. and 13:19:38 2 nothing -- you cannot consider anything outside what that 13:19:41 3 guidebook permits you to consider. 13:19:44 4 and so we appreciate you doing what you said you 13:19:47 5 could do to give us, everybody, a fair shake. not just 13:19:51 6 miss davis, but the tobacco companies, too, to be fair. 13:19:55 7 now, when i first came, i said that we had come to 13:19:58 8 sue philip morris and r.j. reynolds for a few reasons. 13:20:01 9 just briefly, i had mentioned that, you know, because we 13:20:03 thought that it is wrong when a company hides -- knows about 13:20:08 a danger and does not tell its customers about it, in its 13:20:11 product. 13:20:12 and we said that, you know, it is wrong for the -- 13:20:15 for companies to needlessly endanger the public, and that 13:20:20 it was wrong for them to conceal information it knows about 13:20:23 its product. we do not think any company should be able to 13:20:26 do that. 13:20:27 and that we thought it was especially wrong for a 13:20:30 company, in any setting, to understand the dangers and 13:20:34 vulnerabilities of a product that they have hidden and then 13:20:40 make them even more addictive or harder to quit to the 13:20:43 public. 13:20:43 and then, finally, we were here because, taking 13:20:47 all that into account, it seemed especially wrong and is 13:20:51 wrong for a company to then target that type of product to 106 13:20:56 1 children, and to use and manipulate their knowledge, their 13:21:01 2 superior knowledge of their product, of their own product, 13:21:04 3 to get children hooked on what they know was a dangerous 13:21:07 4 product. 13:21:07 5 and i told you you had to take yourself back in 13:21:11 6 time in this case. and i hope you have. we tried -- we 13:21:15 7 played you a lot of videos. i'm sure some of it gets 13:21:18 8 boring and old. but we had to show you about a different 13:21:21 9 time and a different -- and different culture and different 13:21:24 era in american history. 13:21:27 and i'll get into this in just a little bit, but i 13:21:31 hope you realize, i hope you got the idea that there was a 13:21:35 time when things like lung cancer, copd, they did not exist. 13:21:40 in the early 1900s, they just did not exist. it 13:21:44 was the rarest form of disease and types of disease you 13:21:47 could see. and something happened. okay? 13:21:49 and so we showed you the chart. the consumption 13:21:51 of cigarettes go out of control, and 20 years later, these 13:21:54 diseases -- or it is an epidemic. it is an epidemic. 13:21:58 this did not just happen out of the blue. this 13:22:02 did not just come out of nowhere. 13:22:04 and you had to understand the culture. you have 13:22:06 to judge this case -- you have to judge this case by not 13:22:10 just what philip morris and r.j. reynolds did or what 13:22:15 miss davis did, but you have to go back and judge it at the 107 13:22:17 1 appropriate time of what was known and the appropriate time 13:22:22 2 in their life of what they did. 13:22:24 3 you know, miss davis, when she was ten years old 13:22:27 4 was not sitting in the boardroom of the largest companies in 13:22:32 5 the world, cigarette companies. she was not sitting in 13:22:36 6 there. 13:22:36 7 and you have to make that determination and judge 13:22:39 8 about when -- you are going to look at comparative fault. 13:22:41 9 we will get there in a minute. the fault of both sides. 13:22:44 that is one thing you are going to look at. it is 13:22:46 going to be, i'm sure, something that is very important in 13:22:48 your deliberations to look at both sides of that equation. 13:22:50 she was not sitting in a boardroom. but the 13:22:53 cigarette companies had a boardroom, and they were making 13:22:56 decisions during that time. and you have to look at those 13:22:59 decisions versus ten-year-old evonne davis. 13:23:03 what she was doing at the time, she was under a 13:23:03 board. if you remember her testifying, she was under her 13:23:06 house board as a ten-year-old smoking cigarettes. that was 13:23:14 her perspective, looking up at a board, the cigarette smoke 13:23:15 going into her mom's house. that is how she started. 13:23:17 maybe eight years old when she was starting to 13:23:20 puff. and then ten, eleven is when it started becoming 13:23:23 routine, regular, every day. half pack, and then grew. 13:23:27 now, the judge is going to instruct you, but let us 108 13:23:29 1 talk about a couple things in the instructions. 13:23:33 2 john, if you could bring up the instructions on 13:23:36 3 burden of proof. 13:23:36 4 the judge has talked briefly about this, but i 13:23:38 5 want to point it out. the judge is going to instruct you 13:23:41 6 what our burden of proof is. and he is already told you 13:23:43 7 this is not a criminal case. this is not beyond all 13:23:46 8 reasonable doubt. 13:23:46 9 and i want to be really clear about that, because 13:23:48 if you get into the jury room and somebody says, you know, 13:23:50 i have some doubt. i did not think that was whatever. i 13:23:53 have a little doubt here whether she actually did x or saw 13:23:57 x, whatever it is. you can have doubt in a case like this. 13:24:00 we are in a different standard. 13:24:02 you have to apply these rules. and you can have 13:24:05 some doubt. and if somebody says, i have a little doubt, 13:24:08 you know, please remind them, well, let us look at what the 13:24:10 jury instruction says. 13:24:11 obviously we cannot bring this up. we do not have 13:24:14 it on a screen, but it says, to establish an element of a 13:24:20 claim by preponderance of the evidence, that is the standard 13:24:23 -- preponderance of the credible evidence means to prove 13:24:26 that the element is more likely true than not true. 13:24:29 okay. it is just more likely true than not true. 13:24:33 i'll give an example. you know, it is like the scales, the 109 13:24:37 1 scales of justice. if it tilts just ever so slightly in 13:24:40 2 our favor, you have to find in our favor. that is how civil 13:24:43 3 cases work. that is how this law works. 13:24:45 4 you know, it is maybe a poor analogy, but, you 13:24:49 5 know, you have to bet all the money in the world that you 13:24:51 6 have on one thing. you can either choose a or b. you bet 13:24:56 7 all the money in the world on a or b, okay, with the 13:24:59 8 evidence you have. which one are you going to go with? 13:25:02 9 it is just what is more likely true than not true. 13:25:04 now -- and you have to pick. you have to pick one 13:25:10 side or the other. you have got to do the one that is just 13:25:13 -- which one has tipped the scales ever so slightly. 13:25:17 now, the first question -- actually, it is not the 13:25:22 first question. the first question you are going to be 13:25:23 asked is about manifestation. 13:25:25 you have heard about that, about when did her 13:25:27 symptoms, her symptoms of copd, first arise, and was it 13:25:32 before november of 1996. 13:25:34 okay. and there is a reason for that date that, 13:25:36 you know, you do not need to worry about. but the main 13:25:39 reason is was it before november 21, 1996. 13:25:42 and i'll get to that point in a minute. okay. 13:25:44 but i want to go to a couple of other questions 13:25:46 that are going to determine whether miss davis receives the 13:25:49 benefit of what we have been talking about, some of the engle 110 13:25:52 1 findings. 13:25:53 2 okay. the engle findings are critical to this 13:25:55 3 case. the judge is going to instruct you what they are. 13:25:59 4 but they do not mean anything, they do not mean anything 13:26:01 5 unless miss davis proves that she is entitled to receive 13:26:06 6 their benefit. 13:26:07 7 we refer to it as a member of the class, a member 13:26:10 8 of the engle class. if she proves these things -- and 13:26:14 9 we are going to go over those questions -- then she gets the 13:26:16 benefit of those findings. and when she gets the benefit 13:26:20 of those findings, you have to apply them. it is the law. 13:26:22 you cannot question or speculate as to anything 13:26:24 about them, or whether you agree with them or somebody 13:26:28 disagrees with them. 13:26:29 you need to remind them or even tell the court if 13:26:31 you have to, that once she receives the benefits of the 13:26:34 findings, they cannot be questioned. you have to apply 13:26:37 them. that is the way this case works under the law. 13:26:39 so let us look at -- the first question i'd like to 13:26:43 look at, it will be on your verdict form here -- if you can 13:26:46 show, john -- it will be whether it is more likely than not 13:26:50 that miss davis was addicted to cigarettes containing 13:26:54 nicotine, okay? 13:26:55 now, it will actually be question two. as i said, 13:26:57 i'm going to get to the manifestation question later. that 111 13:27:01 1 will be question one. 13:27:03 2 question two will be, we, the jury, find that the 13:27:05 3 plaintiff has proved that it is more likely than not that 13:27:08 4 miss davis was addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes. 13:27:10 5 okay? 13:27:12 6 now, what was the evidence -- remember, we just 13:27:14 7 have to show more likely than not. what was the 13:27:17 8 evidence -- 13:27:17 9 and actually, can you just pull this up so they 13:27:20 can see it? slide part one. 13:27:26 remember, this is the standard we looked at. it 13:27:27 was, to establish a claim by a preponderance of the 13:27:29 evidence means to prove something is more likely true than 13:27:32 not true. 13:27:33 and then let us talk about what it means to be 13:27:35 addicted. the judge is going to give you an instruction on 13:27:38 what addiction means. 13:27:40 jeff, can we bring up this slide, four? 13:27:44 now, this is the definition that the judge is 13:27:46 going to instruct you on. a compulsive need for and use of 13:27:52 a habit-forming substance, characterized by tolerance and 13:27:56 by well-defined physiological symptoms upon withdrawal. 13:28:00 that is the definition of addiction. 13:28:01 and you heard first from dr. burns. and dr. burns 13:28:04 is -- was a medical doctor, you know, in the surgeon 112 13:28:08 1 general's office dealing with tobacco matters and smoking 13:28:11 2 and health before any litigation ever happened. years and 13:28:14 3 years before he ever worked in litigation, he was an expert 13:28:17 4 in this field of smoking and health and worked in the 13:28:19 5 surgeon general's office and -- and helped contribute to 13:28:25 6 all the reports. 13:28:26 7 and, you know, those reports -- we are going to 13:28:28 8 show you some things from those reports. but the thing 13:28:30 9 about those reports is, they are the truth. they speak the 13:28:36 truth about science on smoking and health. 13:28:38 and if there is any doubt, we will show you some of 13:28:41 these. this is one. this is the 2010 surgeon general's 13:28:45 report. okay? and on our side, with miss davis, we stand 13:28:48 with the surgeon general of the united states. and when 13:28:51 you look at these reports, that is where we are. that is 13:28:54 where we stand. 13:28:55 and we are going to talk a little bit -- in a 13:28:57 little bit about where philip morris and r.j. reynolds 13:29:00 stood over the years and even currently with the surgeon 13:29:03 general's office of the united states and their findings. 13:29:05 and it is a stark difference that we want you to 13:29:08 understand. 13:29:08 but on addiction, have we proved that it is more 13:29:11 likely right than wrong or more likely than not that she 13:29:16 was addicted? dr. burns came in and he talked about how 113 13:29:18 1 changes in the brain happen. your brain is changed 13:29:21 2 forever. 13:29:23 3 that children and young people, the younger you 13:29:25 4 start, that your brain is still forming, and that that has 13:29:28 5 all the more reason why nicotine can take its hold on you 13:29:31 6 and get a hold on you. 13:29:32 7 and it is a predictor how young you smoke, how 13:29:35 8 young you start smoking, about whether you will be able to 13:29:38 9 quit or not, and how hard it will be for you to quit down 13:29:41 the road. 13:29:42 and dr. burns explained to you that nicotine comes 13:29:44 into the lungs. and, you know, we are created in this -- 13:29:49 this goes to the second and third question really, 13:29:51 addiction, whether she was addicted, but whether the 13:29:54 addiction caused the disease. 13:29:56 you know, dr. burns described about the lungs. 13:29:58 and, you know, when you think about it, we are made in an 13:30:02 amazing way. we are created in a special, special way. 13:30:06 we have these lungs. and he drew them for you. 13:30:11 remember, he -- you know, he drew kind of how the lungs 13:30:14 work and everything that spreads out. 13:30:16 and what he told you was, when you spread -- it is 13:30:18 like a tree. it is like the leaves on a tree. when you 13:30:21 spread all that out, if you opened up all the airways where 13:30:25 air can get in your lungs, you just put it all out. it is 114 13:30:25 1 as big as a tennis court. that is how we are made. 13:30:28 2 and that is what dr. burns told you. if you spread 13:30:31 3 it all out, he said it was as big as a tennis court. he 13:30:35 4 meant that literally. it is like if you imagine a tree in a 13:30:37 5 park, all of those branches are going out in your organs, 13:30:40 6 you take those leaves, you spread it out, you can cover a 13:30:43 7 tennis court. 13:30:43 8 that is the surface area that the cigarette smoke 13:30:47 9 is hitting. okay? and when the cigarette smoke goes in, 13:30:51 okay, what else -- what other defense mechanisms do we have 13:30:56 that we are created with when we are born? 13:30:58 okay. miss davis, she was born 1940, had the same 13:31:01 thing we all do. we have these cilia in the lungs. you 13:31:06 remember dr. burns talked about cigarettes come in, and 13:31:09 they freeze that. okay? they freeze the cilia. 13:31:12 so even on the first cigarette, even on the first 13:31:15 cigarette miss davis ever had, which was, you know, camel 13:31:18 cigarettes, which is an r.j. reynolds product, you heard, 13:31:23 and she smoked some marlboros, too. she smoked camels for 13:31:27 quite a while in the early years. those are the formative 13:31:30 years. 13:31:30 you are going to hear some -- in a little bit, 13:31:30 we will get to this. you are going to hear some statements, 13:31:33 i'm sure, from r.j. reynolds' counsel, who you have not 13:31:35 heard a lot from, but i've got to tell you, they are here 115 13:31:38 1 for a very serious reason. 13:31:40 2 and it is serious because those are the cigarettes 13:31:44 3 that really start forming the addiction in a young child. 13:31:48 4 and those are the -- while your brain is still forming. 13:31:52 5 and they are among the most cigarettes that she smoked. 13:31:55 6 and they are also here for some very serious 13:31:58 7 reasons about what they did in conjunction and in 13:32:00 8 coordination and in agreement that we allege formed a 13:32:02 9 conspiracy and was a conspiracy with philip morris and 13:32:06 other cigarette companies to do the things that are on this 13:32:10 timeline that we will get into. 13:32:12 but those initial cigarettes are important. and 13:32:15 dr. burns told you every cigarette, even from the first 13:32:18 cigarette, it freezes the -- every cigarette you smoke, it 13:32:20 freezes the cilia and damage starts to be done. 13:32:23 so then every time you smoke, these carcinogens, 13:32:27 these chemicals, these irritants are coming in and 13:32:29 irritating your lung. remember, he spent a long time 13:32:33 telling you about how that works. 13:32:34 and the cilia no longer can throw -- they cannot 13:32:37 throw the irritants out. and it just starts gathering and 13:32:41 gathering and gathering. 13:32:42 and the mechanisms that we are made with to stop 13:32:44 this from ever happening that never happened back before 13:32:47 the 1920s, '30s because we did not have cigarettes, those 116 13:32:51 1 mechanisms break down, and people die. and people get 13:32:54 2 diseases and fatal diseases. 13:32:55 3 so you heard dr. burns talk about how that works. 13:32:59 4 and then you heard dr. cummings mention that the cigarette 13:33:03 5 companies had mastered that they can get it down -- you 13:33:05 6 know, nicotine gets into your blood, goes into the lung, 13:33:08 7 deep inhalation, seven to ten seconds it hits your brain. 13:33:14 8 and when it hits your brain, it goes to these 13:33:15 9 nicotine receptors. and these nicotine receptors grow and 13:33:18 grow and grow, and they change your brain permanently. 13:33:21 the nicotine receptors grow, and come and go, 13:33:24 depending on the smoke; but the pathways that have been 13:33:27 created, the physical pathways that have been created with 13:33:30 those receptors, never leave your brain. 13:33:32 dr. burns testified we know this because they have 13:33:35 done studies and studies on the brain. modern studies that 13:33:39 show us that. 13:33:40 so what do you have? they talked about compulsive 13:33:43 need for use. you heard that from dr. burns, and you heard 13:33:46 that from dr. cummings. they talked about it is a 13:33:49 habit-forming substance. 13:33:51 they talked about tolerance. you remember 13:33:54 dr. burns and dr. cummings talked about this concept of 13:33:55 when you start, you know, you maybe start at a half a pack 13:33:57 like she did, and you grow and you grow and you grow 117 13:34:00 1 because your body is building up a tolerance and you need 13:34:03 2 that much more until you get to that level that really 13:34:05 3 feeds your addiction. and then physiological symptoms upon 13:34:09 4 withdrawal. 13:34:09 5 and what did dr. burns and dr. cummings say that 13:34:13 6 then miss davis came on the stand and supported as well? 13:34:16 7 when she tried to quit, she would get jittery. she would 13:34:19 8 get nervous. she would get agitated. she would get angry. a 13:34:21 9 little bit upset to be around. 13:34:24 and those are all classic defined withdrawal 13:34:26 symptoms that dr. cummings told you about, that dr. burns 13:34:28 mentioned to you. and she had them. it was throughout the 13:34:33 records. 13:34:33 and so let us look at some of the evidence about 13:34:38 addiction. i told you, remember, just more likely than 13:34:42 not. 13:34:43 can you bring this up, jeff? 13:34:45 so we have the scales of justice here that i put 13:34:48 on about, you know, what is the evidence in this case, 13:34:50 okay, that you are looking at, that you are going to look at 13:34:53 to make your determination from plaintiff, evonne davis. 13:34:57 and then we have on the other side for the 13:34:59 defendants, philip morris and r.j. reynolds. 13:35:01 and let us look at -- you have dr. burns, okay? 13:35:11 we brought you dr. burns, and it tips the scales 118 13:35:13 1 ever so slightly. he read the records. he read all of the 13:35:16 2 medical records, by the way. 13:35:17 3 i know there was some suggestion about, you know, 13:35:20 4 dr. cummings was cross the other day about we had not given 13:35:22 5 him all the medical records. and that is true, we had not 13:35:24 6 given him all the medical records. that is our bad. 13:35:27 7 but the medical records he had not been provided, 13:35:29 8 the only ones they showed him that he had not been provided 13:35:33 9 were after 19 -- were after her copd when it said half a 13:35:36 pack, half a pack. 13:35:38 and he had plenty of medical records -- he did 13:35:38 have a lot of those records that said half a pack a day, 13:35:41 half a pack a day. but they tried to make this a big point 13:35:44 that we just did not show all the records that said half a 13:35:46 pack a day. 13:35:46 and they made a point that, oh, she was not 13:35:48 receptive to quitting. okay? we will talk about whether 13:35:50 that even comes into play in your determination at all or 13:35:54 not on these questions. all right? 13:35:55 but dr. burns, he had all the medical records 13:35:58 because he is the medical doctor. and we gave dr. burns 13:36:01 each and every one of the medical records. and he saw 13:36:04 tobacco abuse in the records. he saw tolerance. he saw 13:36:08 the withdrawal symptoms in the records. and he saw the 13:36:10 pack history that developed over that. 119 13:36:12 1 and he did not stop there. he read the 13:36:14 2 depositions. okay? he read the depositions of everybody 13:36:17 3 in the case that miss davis -- and you heard -- there were 13:36:22 4 some long depositions -- that defendants did to find out 13:36:25 5 everything they could about miss davis. 13:36:27 6 and he read those. and he determined easily, he 13:36:31 7 said, again, no doubt in his mind, no doubt in his mind, 13:36:36 8 that she was addicted and heavily addicted. 13:36:37 9 and then what else did we bring? we brought 13:36:40 dr. cummings. he came at it from a -- he is not a medical 13:36:42 doctor. he came at it from a behavioral science 13:36:46 perspective. he was more focused on the depositions and 13:36:49 what they said and the medical records as well to determine 13:36:51 pack-year history. okay? but he got what he needed on the 13:36:53 pack-year history. 13:36:55 and we brought you dr. cummings, and that tips the 13:36:57 scales. and, you know, they are going to -- the cigarette 13:37:00 companies are going to come up here and mention and 13:37:04 criticize that these people make money and they are in a war 13:37:07 against tobacco and, you know, they make all of this money. 13:37:10 and i submit to you, well, of course they do. 13:37:14 because -- you heard them. dr. cummings said he testified 13:37:18 once and thought he would never have to testify again in 13:37:20 the original engle litigation, and did it pro bono. he 13:37:24 did not know it was going to be brought up in all of these 120 13:37:26 1 cases. he is having to spend every day on this. 13:37:27 2 but we brought you the best experts there are out 13:37:29 3 there. the best. and we brought you -- remember, i told 13:37:32 4 you there is only a handful of people -- and you heard that 13:37:35 5 from dr. cummings. 13:37:36 6 there is only a few people that have even been able 13:37:37 7 to review these medical records in this kind of way. he 13:37:41 8 was the first -- dr. cummings was the first one to receive 13:37:44 9 them, really. you heard the new york attorney general's 13:37:48 office sent him the records. he got them, and he had to 13:37:50 start the catalog for everybody else. 13:37:52 and dr. burns, he is worked with the surgeon 13:37:55 general's office forever. they are renowned experts. 13:37:58 nothing -- the fact that they have to charge money for all 13:38:01 the time that they have to spend to give defendants their 13:38:04 depositions, to consult us, to advise, to review the 13:38:07 records does not take away from what they said. 13:38:09 and we will get to it in a minute. but, you know, 13:38:13 it does not take away from these documents over here. they 13:38:16 say what they say. 13:38:17 i mean, if we had misrepresented something in 13:38:20 these documents, they would have brought somebody from 13:38:23 r.j. reynolds and philip morris to tell you that. and they 13:38:25 did not. 13:38:26 so we brought dr. cummings. 121 13:38:28 1 and then what else did we show you? we brought 13:38:31 2 miss davis. miss davis came, and she was willing to come 13:38:35 3 in here and sit on the stand and go through any question we 13:38:38 4 wanted. and she told us about when she started smoking, 13:38:41 5 what she felt like, how much it was. 13:38:44 6 and then she confirmed one of the largest things 13:38:46 7 about this compulsive use, you know, despite harm, which 13:38:50 8 they talk about. she continued to smoke after she had 13:38:53 9 copd. okay? after she had copd, she kept smoking. 13:38:59 and so is the defendants' argument really, you 13:39:00 know, she had copd. she cannot breathe. every doctor, 13:39:04 every time she goes in, is telling her she needs to quit, 13:39:07 she needs to quit. and that she just -- she seriously just 13:39:12 kept doing it because she did not give a crap. i mean, 13:39:14 really? 13:39:15 she was trying -- she was trying to quit from '85 13:39:17 on. the fact that she continued to smoke after a disease, 13:39:22 after something she knows is caused by smoking and hurting 13:39:25 her, you heard it from dr. burns, is a key indicator that 13:39:28 you are addicted. 13:39:29 because you are smoking compulsive use despite 13:39:32 harm. go back to the addiction definition. it is plain 13:39:36 language, and it is what the judge will give you. 13:39:39 so we brought miss davis to testify. and you 13:39:41 heard her testify about what she smoked, when she smoked, 122 13:39:44 1 how much. it grew over time. it got as much as two packs 13:39:48 2 a day, or maybe more, maybe two and a half packs sometimes. 13:39:51 3 and then she told you, after copd, exactly what 13:39:53 4 the records defendant showed, everyone confirms. she was 13:39:57 5 trying to cut back. and she was using the waterpik system 13:40:00 6 starting in '85. and she cut back and went down to a half 13:40:03 7 a pack a day. you saw that in the records. that was her 13:40:07 8 cutting down in those years after her copd. 13:40:09 9 but she could not stop it all the way. that is what 13:40:12 she was trying to do. but she could not stop it all the 13:40:14 way. and she told you about one of those times when she 13:40:18 tried to quit, the symptoms of withdrawal that she had, 13:40:20 what she experienced. 13:40:21 and, finally, we brought you the 2010 surgeon 13:40:27 general report. remember, that is the one that says 13:40:30 nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason. okay? 13:40:33 now, we heard some -- i'll let you decide about 13:40:37 mr. jupe and mr. gentry. we had to play long depositions 13:40:41 for you. i apologize. i apologize for long depositions. 13:40:43 but, you know, we kind of thought that we may not 13:40:46 hear from philip morris and r.j. reynolds, and we needed to 13:40:48 bring you what they say currently. and what they say 13:40:51 currently is they are still arguing with the surgeon 13:40:54 general's office of the united states. 13:40:56 oh, they will tell you, we believe it is -- we 123 13:40:58 1 believe cigarettes are addictive. and they will tell you, 13:41:01 2 well, smoking causes diseases. and addiction causes people 13:41:05 3 to smoke more. oh, but we will not say addiction caused 13:41:09 4 disease. we cannot say that. we are not going to say that. 13:41:11 5 that is just wrong. 13:41:12 6 even though every public health authority says 13:41:15 7 it is the number one issue that we have to deal with. why? 13:41:18 8 because most people would quit if they could. most smokers 13:41:21 9 are addicted. 13:41:22 and nicotine, we showed you in this report right 13:41:24 here -- and by the way, the surgeon general's report, at 13:41:29 least the ones we introduced, the 2010 surgeon general's 13:41:31 report, it is going to be back in your deliberating room for 13:41:34 you to review. 13:41:35 read it. there is a great chapter. it is exhibit 13:41:37 237. 237. it will be in your exhibits. there is a great 13:41:42 chapter on nicotine addiction. 13:41:43 and if you glance at the summary -- and there is a 13:41:47 great chapter on the changing cigarette. and if you look 13:41:50 at these chapters and review them, you can see what we are 13:41:54 talking about. 13:41:56 and, again, you take that as the truth that 13:42:01 nicotine addiction is the primary reason people smoke. and 13:42:03 we brought you that. and it was the reason miss davis was 13:42:06 smoking for all those years and throughout even when she 124 13:42:09 1 was sick and could, you know, barely breathe, with her 13:42:13 2 shortness of breath and her copd. 13:42:15 3 and then we brought you the 2014 surgeon general 13:42:19 4 consumer guide. 13:42:20 5 actually, can we bring that up, that one page? 13:42:22 6 and what are the 2014 -- modern science. okay? 13:42:33 7 now, the cigarette companies will challenge these things, 13:42:35 8 but this is modern science. the reality -- this is 2014. 13:42:39 9 the surgeon general says, the reality is that 13:42:41 smoking is not usually a choice. for most smokers, tobacco 13:42:45 use is an addiction, and nicotine is the primary drug in 13:42:49 tobacco that causes addiction. 13:42:51 and i -- there is no evidence brought by the 13:42:54 cigarette companies to challenge that piece of evidence. 13:42:56 not one. 13:42:56 what is more likely right than wrong? do you have 13:43:00 to have -- have the scales been tipped ever so slightly? 13:43:04 and if so, you have to find in our favor that she was more 13:43:06 likely than not addicted. 13:43:08 and, finally, we brought you miss davis' medical 13:43:13 records. remember, they showed you the medical records 13:43:15 about whether she was receptive to quitting or not. 13:43:18 and, you know, if you have some questions about 13:43:19 how hard she tried to quit, whether she tried to quit 13:43:22 enough, should she have tried more, was she dedicated 125 13:43:25 1 enough or motivated enough to quit, i understand that. 13:43:28 2 we are not here to tell you that miss davis has, 13:43:31 3 you know, no blame whatsoever. she is willing, at least for 13:43:37 4 her part, on her side of this case, to stand up and accept 13:43:40 5 some responsibility for her own choices, although she 13:43:43 6 started when she was ten. but she is willing to stand up 13:43:46 7 for that. 13:43:47 8 but the part -- the place for you to consider that 13:43:49 9 is in what is called the comparative fault section, which we 13:43:52 get to when you weigh the fault of all the different 13:43:55 parties. it is not an easy question. 13:43:57 okay. that is where we submit that you should make 13:43:59 that consideration about her motivation to quit and all 13:44:02 that. that is in comparative fault. 13:44:04 and do not confuse those issues. 13:44:06 so we brought you the medical records. 13:44:09 can we show the tobacco -- the october 7 record 13:44:13 that -- remember, defendants kept showing it to people up 13:44:16 here. they kept pulling it out. 13:44:17 and they did not highlight one portion of that 13:44:19 record. they did not highlight the portion that said 13:44:23 tobacco abuse. 13:44:23 from a doctor. her treating doctor. before any 13:44:29 litigation. before any lawsuits or anything like that. 13:44:32 tobacco abuse. right there, from her own medical doctor, 126 13:44:37 1 made that own determination. more likely right than wrong. 13:44:42 2 do we trust doctors? do we trust doctors who 13:44:44 3 treat us? do you think they put these things in there 13:44:47 4 willy-nilly? 13:44:48 5 that is what they meant. and, you know, what if 13:44:48 6 the defendants said, we do not know what they meant by that. 13:44:52 7 we do not know what that means? that is going to be 13:44:55 8 the argument? we do not know what that means? 13:44:58 9 so when you read the jury instructions, the jury 13:45:00 instructions are going to say use your common sense. you 13:45:02 can make reasonable inferences. reasonable inferences. 13:45:05 i'm not asking you to do anything unreasonable here. 13:45:08 what is the reasonable inference? look at the jury 13:45:11 instructions. what is the reasonable inference from that 13:45:14 alone? even if i had not brought -- even if we had not 13:45:17 brought any of the other evidence, that should do it right 13:45:19 there. 13:45:20 so we go back to our scales. 13:45:27 how am i doing on time? 13:45:31 mr. walburg: forty-nine left. 13:45:33 mr. byrd: when you go back to the scales, let us 13:45:35 see how it is tipped. and we have to tip it ever so 13:45:39 slightly. so if you are in the jury deliberation room and 13:45:42 somebody says, well, i have doubts about whether she is 13:45:44 addicted, well, press them. 127 13:45:46 1 on what? based on what? all they have to prove, 13:45:49 2 it is more likely right than wrong, more likely than not. 13:45:53 3 they do not have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. 13:45:54 4 and then what evidence did -- what evidence did 13:46:03 5 defendants bring? okay. one witness that they read. 13:46:07 6 that is it. one witness that they read, miss fran craft. 13:46:13 7 and you know, she said, well, you know, i never 13:46:15 8 saw her try to quit. 13:46:16 9 did not say anything about addiction. you are not 13:46:18 going to see the word quit. you are not going to see 13:46:21 whether -- you are not going to see if she could quit or not 13:46:24 or whether she tried hard to quit in the definition of 13:46:27 addiction. 13:46:27 and you have to use the judge's definition of 13:46:30 addiction. quitting is not in there. 13:46:33 and so they brought miss craft by deposition. 13:46:37 they had someone come up here and act like she was 13:46:39 miss craft, to read it for you so you can read what she 13:46:43 said. 13:46:43 and the thing you have got to remember about 13:46:45 miss craft, she met her in '88. met her. she testified, 13:46:50 what the deposition testimony said is that she did not spend 13:46:52 any time with her meaningfully until 1998. 13:46:55 i'm sorry. '99. it was '99. she said 1999. but 13:47:00 by 1999, miss davis has copd. she is been trying the 128 13:47:04 1 waterpik filter for years and years and years, and she is 13:47:07 2 down to a half a pack. 13:47:08 3 that is their evidence. that is the only evidence 13:47:11 4 they brought. and if they thought that they could bring in 13:47:14 5 here an addiction expert like dr. burns, a medical doctor, 13:47:19 6 or a behavioral scientist expert like dr. cummings, if they 13:47:22 7 had somebody that they could find to say that she was not 13:47:26 8 addicted, they would have brought them in here and told 13:47:28 9 you. and they did not. 13:47:34 now, the second question is going to be whether 13:47:36 addiction caused the disease. and dr. burns talked to you 13:47:41 about the fact -- and we have already gone over it. it is the 13:47:44 repeated exposure to smoke. okay. it is not just one 13:47:48 cigarette. it is every cigarette that combines. 13:47:50 you cannot pick out what years or times that it did 13:47:52 it. it is every cigarette combines. why? every cigarette 13:47:56 -- for two reasons. because every cigarette -- 13:47:59 you can take that down. 13:48:00 every cigarette helps contribute to the addiction. 13:48:05 okay? and every cigarette contributes to stopping the 13:48:09 cilia, doing irritants and damage, and that it all leads up 13:48:13 over time to creating copd. 13:48:15 and, john, if you can show the instructions real 13:48:17 quick on -- no, the instructions on addiction causation. 13:48:31 and the instruction says that her addiction was a 129 13:48:35 1 legal cause -- this is one of the things she has to show to 13:48:38 2 get the benefit of the findings, that her addiction was a 13:48:41 3 legal cause of her copd in the sense that her continued 13:48:44 4 smoking of cigarettes was, at least in part, a natural and 13:48:48 5 direct result -- a natural and direct result of her 13:48:53 6 addiction. 13:48:53 7 and now, he goes on to explain in this regard, 13:48:58 8 plaintiff need not prove that addiction was the only reason 13:49:00 9 miss davis continued to smoke cigarettes. she may, for 13:49:04 example, have partly smoked them because she enjoyed 13:49:08 smoking. 13:49:09 okay. so if somebody said, well, she enjoyed 13:49:12 smoking, i think she enjoyed smoking, that is fine. we 13:49:15 explained all the reasons why smokers enjoy smoking and why 13:49:18 they say that. of course, they are going to enjoy smoking 13:49:21 if you are addicted. 13:49:22 but even if somebody said, well, i think she just 13:49:23 did it for enjoyment, no other reason, the judge has 13:49:27 instructed you, and you must follow them, that even if she 13:49:30 enjoyed smoking, that does not matter. they can act in 13:49:34 concert and have more than one reason why she smoked them. 13:49:37 and as long as addiction was a substantive reason, 13:49:42 a substantial contributing reason -- and it was, because it 13:49:46 was the repeated exposure to the smoking cigarettes that 13:49:49 caused it -- then we have proved addiction. 130 13:49:52 1 and i submit to you i could line up the scales 13:49:54 2 again. and i will not do that. all the evidence we brought. 13:49:57 3 and what evidence did they bring? zero. zero. 13:50:04 4 where was the medical doctor to come in and say, 13:50:07 5 you know, this was caused by something else? 13:50:11 6 and, in fact, the judge is even going to instruct 13:50:13 7 you -- it is somewhere different, but the judge is going to 13:50:17 8 instruct you that neither party disputes, okay, cigarettes 13:50:20 9 caused her disease. 13:50:21 and then dr. burns said 95 percent of copd is 13:50:24 caused by smoking. no one disputes that in this case. it 13:50:27 is undisputed. cigarettes caused mrs. davis' copd, end of 13:50:32 story. it cannot even be questioned. 13:50:34 and so if cigarettes caused it, well, then what 13:50:37 caused her to keep smoking? 13:50:39 addiction. 13:50:40 but addiction need not be the only cause. it only 13:50:42 has to be a cause. you can have other causes. because i'm 13:50:46 going to show you some other causes, too, where i think 13:50:49 some of their lies and concealments and their potential 13:50:51 things they did, they also contributed. 13:50:53 you can have more than one cause. it just needs 13:50:55 to be a cause. just a cause. and so the question, is it 13:50:58 more likely than not -- and remember, you know, make sure 13:51:02 the standard is followed when you all deliberate. 131 13:51:04 1 is it more likely than not that addiction was a 13:51:08 2 cause of her disease? 13:51:10 3 we submit to you that it is not even a close call. 13:51:12 4 and dr. burns said that, and everyone else backed 13:51:19 5 that up. and the medical records back that up as well. 13:51:22 6 now, the only other question that we need to show 13:51:26 7 to become what is known as an engle member and get the 13:51:29 8 benefit of these findings is the manifestation question. 13:51:32 9 and it will be your first question. 13:51:34 did her disease manifest prior to november 1 -- 13:51:37 november 21 of 1996? 13:51:38 and let me just say, you know, there are -- you 13:51:46 know, everyone would love to have medical records, you 13:51:50 know, somewhere between 1993, '94, '95, '96 in this case. 13:51:54 we would love to have them. they do not exist. we do not have 13:51:57 them. 13:51:57 you know, any medical doctor she saw, those 13:52:01 records are gone. not by anybody's fault. but they are 13:52:04 gone. and nobody has them. neither side has them. 13:52:06 and so, you know, we are unable -- because it is so 13:52:10 long ago, to be able to show you those records. but what 13:52:13 we can do is, the first record we do have, okay, is from 13:52:16 march of 1998. 13:52:18 and i'll show that. this is the first record 13:52:22 that is available, related to copd anyway, for either side. 132 13:52:25 1 all right? 13:52:25 2 and i do not know if you can bring that up. 13:52:34 3 the medical record says, it is from march of 1998. 13:52:39 4 and history, okay, now when you go into a doctor here, it 13:52:42 5 says history of present illness. history means past, in 13:52:46 6 the past. she is already been diagnosed with this. we just 13:52:49 7 do not have the records. she is already been diagnosed. 13:52:52 8 you do not say history of something that you have 13:52:55 9 in the past that you have not -- that there has not already 13:52:59 been a diagnosis for. doctors are not, you know, careless 13:53:04 about what they say in medical records. they are not. 13:53:07 and if the cigarette companies are going to say 13:53:10 they are, okay, maybe you should think back to what 13:53:16 historically the cigarette companies have said about 13:53:18 doctors. maybe you should think historically about what 13:53:25 they have challenged doctors said. think about that. 13:53:30 doctors are not willy-nilly here on this record. 13:53:33 so it says miss davis is a 58-year-old white 13:53:35 female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary 13:53:39 disease. it does not say suggested disease. it says 13:53:42 history of it. 13:53:43 and then dr. burns, the really important part of 13:53:45 this, too, that dr. burns was able to decipher for you, was 13:53:49 pulmonary function tests were suggesting -- okay, so she 13:53:52 had pulmonary function tests -- were suggesting 133 13:53:55 1 mild-to-moderate obstructive ventilatory defect. 13:54:00 2 and if you remember, i'm glad he explained this to 13:54:05 3 you because way outside my ability on how the lung actually 13:54:09 4 works, and how -- the breathing and all that. 13:54:10 5 the court reporter: could you please slow down? 13:54:15 6 mr. byrd: okay. and i speak notoriously fast as 13:54:21 7 well. i'm sorry. 13:54:23 8 so i apologize to you. 13:54:24 9 dr. burns, remember he explained to you how the 13:54:27 breathing capacity works and how long it takes over time 13:54:30 for that to develop that you have symptoms. 13:54:32 and remember he said -- he drew this picture. and 13:54:39 he said let us find out -- i asked him about 13:54:41 mild-to-moderate obstructive disease, right, which is what 13:54:45 she had in march of 1998. and it was a history of that. 13:54:48 and he pointed out that, you know, if you have 13:54:50 this, you are talking about down here. symptoms start up 13:54:53 here. because you are going to have shortness of breath. 13:54:55 you are going to have these beginning symptoms that you 13:54:58 would have around the eighty percent mark. 13:55:01 and then he said, but she was already here, in the 13:55:03 sixty percent zone. okay. that is what mild-to-moderate 13:55:07 means. 13:55:08 and so then i said, what is this time period right 13:55:10 here? okay? what is that? what is this time period? 134 13:55:13 1 what can we say about march of '98. 13:55:16 2 and put up dr. burns' testimony on this. 13:55:19 3 dr. burns said -- i asked him about what does that 13:55:26 4 mean about timing. 13:55:28 5 his answer was that if you get folks who were 13:55:29 6 short of breath and that is why they came in to be detected, 13:55:32 7 and say they are hovering around this 50 to 60 range -- he 13:55:37 8 was pointing to that -- they may have had copd that we 13:55:40 9 could detect for ten or fifteen years, or they may have had 13:55:45 it for four or five years. 13:55:46 if you have moderate disease, okay, we know you have 13:55:50 had it for at least two or three years. 13:55:52 that is what he said. if you have moderate 13:55:59 disease, we know you have had it for at least two or three 13:56:04 years. 13:56:05 and so i did not pull this out of nowhere. 13:56:10 in '98, in march of 1998, she has the moderate 13:56:15 disease. two to three years, it will be '96. three years 13:56:18 will be '95. 13:56:19 okay. so at least, at least certainly before 13:56:23 november 21 of 1996 is it more likely than not from 13:56:26 dr. burns' testimony that she had it? of course it is. 13:56:31 she said her symptoms started in '91 or '92. 13:56:34 okay. there were some suggestions that they denied it 13:56:36 then. 135 13:56:36 1 but if you take the middle point of her saying 13:56:38 2 '91, '92 it was happening, and then i remember, she said i 13:56:42 3 went to -- i went to my training in october of 1993, went 13:56:46 4 to st. petersburg for the police training. and that is when 13:56:52 5 i really noticed it. and i went to dr. velasquez right 13:56:55 6 after that or shortly after that. 13:56:56 7 so that is in october of '93 she is having these 13:56:59 8 problems. and she is goes to velasquez who then said you have 13:57:02 9 got to stop smoking. velasquez says you have got to quit 13:57:06 this smoking for this shortness of breath. that was copd. 13:57:09 that was the symptoms and manifestations of copd right 13:57:11 then. 13:57:12 and all you have to do is listen to what dr. burns 13:57:14 said. he took the march -- you know, we have the march of 13:57:18 1998 record. and if you believe dr. burns in the medical 13:57:23 field -- and i submit to you that you should -- it goes 13:57:26 back at least two or three years. 13:57:28 and all i need to show is -- you know, all 13:57:30 miss davis needs to show is november 21, 1996. so that is 13:57:33 even less than two years. that is a year and a half, 13:57:36 whatever that is. 13:57:37 okay. so is it more likely than not? more likely 13:57:41 than not? 13:57:42 what did -- you know, what was the defense case on 13:57:46 this? zero. they brought in no medical doctor. if there 136 13:57:51 1 was a doctor who could come in here and tell you what that 13:57:54 2 march of '98 record meant, or that it meant that she only 13:57:57 3 had it for a few months, do you think you would have heard 13:58:00 4 about it? where is that person? 13:58:03 5 well, what they did do, what they are going to do, 13:58:05 6 is try to say miss davis, who is elderly -- and we sat her 13:58:08 7 through nine hours of deposition -- she said some things, 13:58:11 8 we just do not believe it. she is wrong. 13:58:13 9 who they did not attack, not one question, not one 13:58:18 iota of them taking dr. burns on in this concept. if they 13:58:23 thought that dr. burns was wrong, why did not they ask him 13:58:26 and press him on it? why did not they ask him? 13:58:31 where was the medical thing to take to dr. burns? 13:58:34 here, dr. burns, you said it would have been at least two 13:58:36 or three years, right? well, then, have you considered 13:58:39 this? have you thought about that? 13:58:41 they did not do that because they cannot challenge 13:58:44 dr. burns. all they can do is put doubt, let us put doubt 13:58:49 in your mind. let us put doubt. 13:58:52 and, you know, when you hear the evidence that 13:58:57 goes on throughout the history and all this timeline we have 13:59:04 done, all the way up to gentry, mr. gentry and mr. jupe you 13:59:08 heard from -- and that is 2011. and then, you know, it goes 13:59:10 on. 13:59:12 you are going to hear this ringing, gentry and jupe 137 13:59:15 1 and others, philip morris and r.j. reynolds, of doubt. 13:59:18 2 okay? 13:59:19 3 mr. mccarter: i'm going to object, your honor, of 13:59:20 4 the comparison of counsel to -- 13:59:24 5 mr. byrd: i did not compare counsel. 13:59:25 6 the court: i do not think that is quite what he 13:59:26 7 did. but anyway, go ahead. 13:59:31 8 mr. byrd: okay. what is one of the products we 13:59:32 9 showed you? an internal secret document, never come out 13:59:35 before until the late '90s. doubt is our product. that 13:59:39 was in 1969. 13:59:40 okay? doubt is our product. 13:59:49 well, i'll get into the doubt campaign later. it 13:59:54 goes to something else, and i'll talk about that later. 13:59:57 okay. so have we proved all of these things that 14:00:00 we need, these three things? have we proved it beyond a 14:00:03 reasonable doubt? no. although, i think all of our 14:00:06 experts said i have no doubt in my mind. i think they went 14:00:09 way further and said they have no doubt. 14:00:11 but have we proved it more likely than not, the 14:00:15 standard that you have to use? the standard that everybody 14:00:18 in that jury room uses? yes, we have. 14:00:20 now, the next question you are going to deal with, 14:00:27 if you find those things, okay, then we have shown that 14:00:32 miss davis gets the benefit of the findings. okay. 138 14:00:35 1 and there is various findings. i'm going to 14:00:37 2 mention a few of them. but the findings are going to be in 14:00:40 3 the jury instructions as they are relevant to whatever 14:00:43 4 question you are answering. 14:00:44 5 and for the first question -- 14:00:45 6 john, if you can, show us the first finding. 14:00:51 7 strict liability and negligence. 14:00:58 8 well, the first finding is that nicotine is 14:01:04 9 addictive. okay. 14:01:06 cigarettes and nicotine -- nicotine and cigarettes 14:01:09 are addictive. and that they cause -- that the cigarettes 14:01:14 cause copd. diseases like copd. 14:01:17 okay. and that is going to be -- 14:01:20 actually, do not worry about it. it is too hard to 14:01:22 blow it up. you will read it in the jury room. 14:01:24 that is the finding. okay? 14:01:26 and the judge is going to inform you that that 14:01:28 means that if -- that the defendants will be liable for 14:01:34 strict liability and negligence as long as, you know, we 14:01:37 were smoking their cigarettes. 14:01:38 okay. now, the reason we have -- you are going to 14:01:41 be asked then a question. 14:01:42 and, john, you can put that up. 14:01:44 are they liable for negligence and strict 14:01:46 liability? well, the finding will be that they were 139 14:01:48 1 negligent because they were negligent. 14:01:51 2 and the other finding is that they put defective 14:01:53 3 and unreasonably dangerous products on the market. okay. 14:01:57 4 that is the other finding. 14:01:58 5 and i wish i had the findings in a nice, 14:02:00 6 wrapped-up way for you, but i do not. they are in the 14:02:03 7 instructions. 14:02:03 8 but when you put those findings together, it means 14:02:05 9 that they are liable for negligence and strict liability as 14:02:10 long as we showed you that she smoked their products. 14:02:13 okay. and we showed you -- that is the only 14:02:17 question you will see in the instructions. you will see in the 14:02:19 instructions what you have to consider. 14:02:21 all we basically have to show in that question is, 14:02:23 did she smoke philip morris products? and did she smoke 14:02:28 r.j. reynolds products which contributed to her injuries. 14:02:32 okay? 14:02:33 and we do not have any other cigarette companies in 14:02:35 this room. we did not bring anybody here that does not make 14:02:38 the brands that she smokes. 14:02:40 r.j. reynolds makes camels. and that was a 14:02:42 stipulated fact. we read that to you. 14:02:45 those were among the most important of her brands 14:02:47 because they were in her early years. 14:02:49 and then she smoked the raw majority of her time 140 14:02:52 1 philip morris cigarettes, because they make marlboro and 14:02:55 2 they make marlboro lights. 14:02:57 3 so, are they liable when you read the instructions 14:02:59 4 to what the judge is going to give you? of course they 14:03:01 5 are, because she smoked philip morris cigarettes and she 14:03:04 6 smoked camel cigarettes made by r.j. reynolds. okay? 14:03:08 7 and that is the real question that you will see. 14:03:11 8 you will see in the instructions, the judge will tell you the 14:03:13 9 only thing for your determination is whether she smoked the 14:03:16 cigarettes manufactured by these defendants. and that is 14:03:18 it. that is the essential part of that question. 14:03:20 and then you get to the next question on the 14:03:22 verdict form. 14:03:23 john? 14:03:25 whether -- the comparative fault question here on 14:03:31 the bottom, okay. this is the real thing i'm trying to get 14:03:34 to as quick as i can. i think it is the most important 14:03:37 aspect of the verdict form here, the how you weigh the 14:03:40 fault of all of these parties. all right? 14:03:44 does miss davis bear some responsibility? maybe. 14:03:46 okay. if you think she should have tried harder 14:03:49 to quit -- this is where i was telling you, if you think 14:03:52 maybe she was not motivated enough or she should have tried 14:03:55 harder or she should have done other things, this is where 14:03:57 you put it. this is where you discuss that kind of thing. 141 14:04:00 1 and let us think a little about how you answer this 14:04:07 2 question. all right? because as we showed you over here, 14:04:09 3 and i want to explain to you, the cigarette companies had 14:04:12 4 one hundred percent of knowledge about their product. 14:04:17 5 okay. they had one hundred percent knowledge about their 14:04:21 6 product. and miss davis had zero, zero knowledge. she is a 14:04:25 7 ten-year-old girl. 14:04:26 8 remember, when you determine this question of 14:04:29 9 comparative fault, you have to -- at the time, what was the 14:04:30 comparative fault in the 1950s compared to, you know, what 14:04:33 was evonne davis, ten-year-old, versus philip morris and 14:04:38 r.j. reynolds? what about when she was 15? what about 14:04:40 when she was 20? what about later? 14:04:42 and, you know, imagine it is like -- you know, 14:04:50 people have probably heard -- everybody uses cell phones. 14:04:55 okay? and cell phones, you know, as you have read or heard, 14:04:58 you might hear if you hold cell phones to your ear it might 14:05:02 cause brain cancer. it is been in newspapers. it is been in 14:05:05 news articles. you have heard it. everybody keeps using 14:05:08 them. everybody in the world is using them. okay. 14:05:10 now, what if, you know, 30, 40 years from now we 14:05:12 find out that cell phones actually do cause brain cancer, 14:05:17 number one? and number two, what if we find out that the 14:05:21 people that made cell phones knew it, knew it from day one 14:05:30 and never told us? 142 14:05:31 1 does not it make a difference when the people who 14:05:33 2 manufactured the things you use know about it and they 14:05:35 3 do not tell you? and they hide it from you? 14:05:39 4 it makes all of the difference in the world. and 14:05:41 5 you have to imagine, back then, the defendants' argument 14:05:43 6 here is, well, she knew it was bad for her. really? 14:05:46 7 we are going to blame a ten-year-old? is that what 14:05:48 8 we do in this country? do we blame children in this 14:05:51 9 country because they should be fully aware of the decisions 14:05:56 they are making or something? 14:05:57 especially back in the 1950s and '60s when this 14:06:01 culture of smoking that you heard from dr. kyriakoudes 14:06:04 arose. is that what we do? 14:06:07 so i would suggest to that when you take this 14:06:11 consideration into account, you have to understand what 14:06:15 their knowledge was about their product and versus what her 14:06:19 knowledge was. and understand that -- you know, take that 14:06:25 into consideration as you determine the percentage of 14:06:27 fault. 14:06:28 now, what choices did they make? you know they are 14:06:30 going to tell you that miss davis came in every morning and 14:06:33 that she made choices in her life. she woke up every 14:06:38 morning and made a choice in her life about whether she was 14:06:40 going to smoke or not. 14:06:41 again, i submit to you i do not think we should do 143 14:06:43 1 that to her from the ages of ten to eighteen at least. i 14:06:48 2 just do not. we submit you just do not do that to children. 14:06:51 3 but let us look at exhibit 832. 14:06:58 4 let us look at the choices that the cigarette 14:07:08 5 companies made. we showed you, back in 1950, when she is 14:07:12 6 ten, they make a choice. 14:07:14 7 remember? reports linking cigarettes to disease 14:07:16 8 and cancer. the tobacco companies internal scientists know 14:07:21 9 that it causes this stuff. what choice did they make? 14:07:24 when they woke up, looked themselves in the 14:07:27 mirror, went to the boardroom, what choice did they make? 14:07:30 and if we are going to talk about the choices 14:07:32 miss davis made, make sure the people in the jury 14:07:34 deliberation room are thinking about the choices -- every 14:07:36 time they talk about a choice miss davis makes, please ask 14:07:40 what choice were the cigarette companies making at the same 14:07:44 time. 14:07:45 okay. when the surgeon general came out, he came 14:07:47 out with a warning. he asked them to provide information. 14:07:49 what choice did they make? to withhold that information. 14:07:53 undesirable. undesirable. do not submit it to the 14:07:58 surgeon general. it is undesirable. 14:07:59 and then when the surgeon general came out and 14:08:02 said, everybody look -- and you can see this as the 14:08:05 consumption goes up. everybody, cigarettes may be 144 14:08:08 1 hazardous. 14:08:09 2 if the cigarette companies had come out then and 14:08:12 3 said, you know what, we agree. we have got to get -- we are 14:08:15 4 sorry. we agree. we stand with -- we stand with the 14:08:18 5 surgeon general of the united states. and everybody needs 14:08:20 6 to listen to it. 14:08:21 7 they did not do that. they made a choice not to do 14:08:23 8 that. 14:08:24 9 and dr. burns told you about what that means when 14:08:26 people are in lockstep, trying to give a warning, a public 14:08:31 health warning, what that means. 14:08:32 then they made a choice. they made a choice to 14:08:35 make filters. they knew they did not work. 14:08:38 we showed you the documents. and they even said, 14:08:41 it does not matter -- do you remember why would they do 14:08:46 this? we must provide a psychological crutch and a 14:08:50 self-rationale to continue smoking. 14:08:52 that was their secret internal documents. they 14:08:56 did not tell people they were providing a psychological 14:08:58 crutch in public. 14:08:59 we must do that. and they start making filters. 14:09:01 okay? 14:09:03 and then they make lights to do the same thing. 14:09:09 all along this map of her lifetime, they made 14:09:11 choices, too. and then they made a choice -- 145 14:09:13 1 they talked to her about she should have tried 14:09:16 2 harder to quit. 14:09:17 3 and, oh, it was 1985. remember that? 1985 she 14:09:22 4 was doing the waterpik filter. 14:09:24 5 they said she is not trying to quit. and, oh, did 14:09:27 6 you ever participate in the great american smokeout? 14:09:30 7 remember, they made this big thing about the great american 14:09:32 8 smokeout. okay? 14:09:34 9 they are talking to her, why did not she do things 14:09:36 like that to quit in 1985. okay? 14:09:40 nicorette gum. why were not you doing that kind of 14:09:44 stuff? okay. well, she did, by the way, use nicorette gum 14:09:47 and did the great american smokeout. it did not work. 14:09:49 what were the cigarette companies doing at the 14:09:54 same time? 14:09:55 jeff, exhibit 1501. 14:09:57 oh, they were sending this to their customers. 14:10:04 your great american smoker's kit. remember? 14:10:06 jeff, just flip through. 14:10:06 a message. sincerely, from your friends at philip 14:10:09 morris. 14:10:10 you do not need to participate in the great 14:10:11 american smokeout. you know what? if your friends are 14:10:16 egging you on and telling you to participate and try to 14:10:18 quit, you know, let us give you some clever comebacks. 146 14:10:23 1 do you know what people who do that are? do you 14:10:25 2 know what they are doing? here's a little sticker. do not 14:10:28 3 nag me. i'm a great american smoker. that is what they 14:10:31 4 sent out in '85, the mid-'80s. 14:10:34 5 and then go on. if you have somebody bothering 14:10:37 6 you, here's what you tell them. okay? this is what you 14:10:40 7 do. this is their message in the mid-'80s. 14:10:43 8 sure, they get to come in today into court and 14:10:45 9 say, well, look, smoking is addictive. 14:10:47 we are not -- we do not agree with that. smoking is 14:10:49 bad for you. everybody should quit as soon as they can. 14:10:51 of course, they are going to say that now. 14:10:54 but this is not a case about now. this is a case 14:10:57 about what they said over the lifetime of miss davis. 14:11:01 and then nicorette gum. you know, this is brought 14:11:06 to you by the cigarette companies. brought to you by the 14:11:10 cigarette companies that say, you know -- 14:11:15 by the way, essentially their argument is -- 14:11:17 you know, imagine, they are going to get up here to 14:11:19 talk. so one of the reasons i'm doing this is i'm not 14:11:21 going to get to talk to you after. so i do want you to 14:11:24 think about when they talk, you know, what would i say in 14:11:27 response because i cannot get back up and talk to you again 14:11:29 to counter anything they say. so i'm trying to predict a 14:11:32 little bit. 147 14:11:33 1 but, you know, people can just -- their central 14:11:40 2 defense is, you know, yeah, we make this horrible thing and 14:11:43 3 it is awful. but do you know what? it is our customers' 14:11:47 4 fault for buying them. 14:11:48 5 i want you to listen and see if you do not think 14:11:51 6 that is essentially the argument. i mean, imagine, this 14:11:55 7 is -- you know, we are coming into court. there is certain 14:11:59 8 things that a company should not do. and this is an 14:12:02 9 argument. okay? and you all need to make a determination 14:12:04 about this. it is important. 14:12:05 a company is going to come in and say, you should 14:12:10 have known better than to believe us and buy our product. 14:12:13 you are crazy. why did you buy our product? 14:12:15 that is the argument. that is the argument we are 14:12:18 going to check on the box and say, okay, okay, go home. 14:12:22 they are going to come in here and say you just 14:12:25 check a box no on the class membership and you get to go 14:12:28 home. 14:12:29 they are going to tell you that. just come in 14:12:30 here, check a box and go. hoping you will not want to look at 14:12:34 the evidence. hoping you will not want to read all the 14:12:36 documents and materials here. 14:12:38 read it. you are a better jury than that. you are 14:12:40 a better jury than that. there will be plenty of time to 14:12:44 go home. but this is your time to make a determination 148 14:12:48 1 from documents that a lot of people do not see. and it is 14:12:51 2 your time to give miss davis her fair trial, the tobacco 14:12:55 3 companies their fair trial. read the documents. 14:12:58 4 read the documents. i put the exhibit numbers on 14:13:01 5 here. you are not going to be able to have this back in the 14:13:04 6 room with you, this timeline. 14:13:05 7 read the documents that i put up there. make your 14:13:08 8 own determination. 14:13:08 9 what were they doing to nicorette gum? okay. 14:13:11 think about this. 14:13:12 jeff, bring up exhibit 34. 14:13:16 do you remember the dow chemical store, the 14:13:19 nicorette gum? they are going to talk about what she should 14:13:22 have done in the mid-'80s. let us look at what they were 14:13:26 doing 1982 through '85. 14:13:27 they were telling the people making the nicorette 14:13:30 gum, nicorette gum should not be a problem. because the 14:13:33 cigarette companies say you can just put your cigarettes 14:13:35 down whenever you want. all you have to do is throw your 14:13:36 ashtray out and you are done. that is their argument, is not 14:13:38 it? really? 14:13:40 because i think they are really concerned about 14:13:42 nicorette gum here. and i wonder why they are concerned 14:13:45 about nicorette gum. 14:13:47 and, you know, the deal they find -- if you can 149 14:13:50 1 read this. 14:13:51 2 jeff, can you bring it up bigger? because i'm 14:13:51 3 having trouble reading it that far away. 14:13:51 4 you know, they were threatening to take away their 14:13:56 5 business from dow chemical, because they get all these 14:13:59 6 chemicals to make cigarettes from dow chemical. 14:14:01 7 through a series of meetings over the past few 14:14:03 8 years, dow has been repeatedly advised of our displeasure 14:14:07 9 over the anti-smoking nature of dow merrill's nicorette 14:14:11 program. 14:14:12 we had been assured that nicorette would have a 14:14:15 low-key introduction and would be aimed only at those 14:14:20 smokers who had to stop for medical reasons. 14:14:24 this is what they are doing. they are cutting 14:14:30 arrangements with dow chemical. you know, you can use 14:14:33 nicorette gum, but please do not give it to anybody unless 14:14:36 they are sick already. 14:14:37 where is the free choice in that? 14:14:41 so we will keep everybody else addicted. you can 14:14:44 help people once they get too sick and they are on their way 14:14:47 to the grave. 14:14:48 how about that? that is the choice they make. 14:14:50 because miss davis did not wake up in the morning 14:14:52 and make that decision. 14:14:53 and they cannot just wipe that off the table. they 150 14:14:56 1 made decisions, too. and they brought you nobody, zero. 14:14:59 2 nobody from their company came in here to explain what was 14:15:02 3 going on in this thing. or to explain it away, say 14:15:05 4 something was not what they were doing. because they 14:15:08 5 cannot. 14:15:08 6 so you can make a determination -- 14:15:12 7 you can put that down. 14:15:13 8 when you make a determination on the percentage of 14:15:15 9 fault, here's what i would suggest. 14:15:20 you know, miss davis, i believe -- i think you 14:15:25 should look at the time that she smoked. and from 1950, 14:15:30 okay, to 1966, there were no warnings on cigarettes at all. 14:15:35 and, by the way, she is a child. 14:15:38 and then from 19 -- all the way to 1985, okay, 14:15:41 1985 is the first time, okay, that she was told on a 14:15:49 cigarette pack. you know, she said she saw the warning on 14:15:51 a pack every day. 14:15:52 okay. let us buy that. the first time she was 14:15:54 told that it may cause or that it causes emphysema, 1985. 14:15:59 so from 1950 to 1985, for 35 years of her smoking 14:16:03 history, okay, i submit to you that because she was a 14:16:07 child, because of the activities they were engaging in, 14:16:10 because the warning did not come on until here about 14:16:13 emphysema, that she should bear no responsibility for that. 14:16:17 okay. if you want to bear some responsibility for 151 14:16:19 1 her, look at the years, divide it up and see the percentage 14:16:22 2 of time. 14:16:22 3 from 1985 on. okay. you know, apply some fault 14:16:27 4 to her because you think she did not try hard enough. she 14:16:30 5 was doing the waterpik filter. 14:16:32 6 but do not forget, all along they did not even admit 14:16:36 7 it causes cancer or other diseases. they did not do that 14:16:38 8 until after her copd. 14:16:39 9 so when you look at what she was doing between '85 14:16:44 to '99, look at what they were doing, too. 14:16:46 and i would submit that an appropriate division -- 14:16:50 you know, you are going to set the division. you are going 14:16:53 to set the percentage of fault. 14:16:55 i would submit that miss davis bears no more than 14:16:58 10 to twenty percent responsibility. okay? and then you 14:17:01 divide it up among philip morris and r.j. reynolds based on 14:17:05 what they did. 14:17:06 she smoked philip morris for the longest, no 14:17:09 doubt. she did marlboro and marlboro light. and maybe 14:17:11 they are 50 or sixty percent responsible. 14:17:13 and maybe r.j. reynolds is, you know, 20 or 30 14:17:15 percent responsible. but do not forget, r.j. reynolds is 14:17:18 going to come up here and say, well, she did not really -- 14:17:18 there is no evidence she smoked hardly any camels. well, 14:17:21 that is not true. she smoked camels when she was a kid. 152 14:17:25 1 do not forget the reason that they need a 14:17:27 2 percentage of fault that is meaningful and lets them know 14:17:31 3 about their part in this, because of their knowledge as 14:17:34 4 well that they had. do not forget, this is when your brain 14:17:39 5 is forming, and how important those early cigarettes are. 14:17:42 6 so, you know, we say, sure, miss davis take some 14:17:47 7 fault, 10 to twenty percent fault? and we think that when we 14:17:51 8 really view the evidence, that that is appropriate. 14:17:52 9 do not forget, they had one hundred percent of the 14:17:54 knowledge. and they tried to do everything they could to 14:17:57 keep her knowledge as low, as close to zero as possible. 14:18:00 they deliberately played down the role of 14:18:03 nicotine, they said. and they went out on television, they 14:18:08 lied. they said if we ever find anything, we are going to 14:18:10 take it out. they did not. 14:18:12 and think about all that -- you know, they built 14:18:14 this thing up as a -- dr. kyriakoudes showed you what they 14:18:17 did in their advertising. they did not show anybody walking 14:18:21 around with a breathing problem. everybody was happy, 14:18:23 playing sports, running around. 14:18:26 now, we are going to go on to -- let us talk about 14:18:34 this advertising, because you are going to be asked 14:18:37 questions about what is known as the intentional torts. 14:18:40 and i guess i'm going to have to -- i'm rushing here. 14:18:42 how much time do i have? 153 14:18:46 1 i'm not going to go over the -- this in-depth. 14:18:50 2 but you are going to basically be asked -- there is two more 14:18:53 3 sections you are going to be asked about, fraudulent 14:18:55 4 concealment. 14:18:56 5 and what we suggest to you is that they hid, and 14:18:58 6 we showed you on the timeline where they hid and lied about 14:19:01 7 the dangers of the product. they lied whether it caused 14:19:03 8 disease or not. 14:19:05 9 they also hid -- remember, these yellow tags here 14:19:08 represent the studies that they were doing. okay? they 14:19:10 were studying to see how well can they manipulate the 14:19:13 levels of nicotine. miss davis did not know about that. 14:19:16 how can they -- how can they get the lowest -- how 14:19:20 low can they go to get a habituating level of nicotine. 14:19:23 they knew what they were doing. 14:19:25 miss davis did not know they were setting the 14:19:27 nicotine level and adjusting the ph and engineering this 14:19:30 product and putting filters and vent holes on it. 14:19:32 i mean, have you ever seen vent holes on these 14:19:35 things? 14:19:35 i mean, what were they used for? we showed you in 14:19:39 the evidence. and she did not know about that. 14:19:41 and so these questions go to their concealment and 14:19:45 fraud. and did that play a role in what happened to her? 14:19:49 of course it did. 154 14:19:50 1 and then you are going to have to make a 14:19:51 2 determination. it is honestly a lot of legal mumbo jumbo 14:19:57 3 that i do not want to get into. 14:19:58 4 but here's the deal. you are going to have to 14:20:00 5 answer questions about may 5 of 1982. there is no reason 14:20:03 6 you need to be concerned about. nothing important happened 14:20:06 7 on may 5 of 1982. 14:20:08 8 but all you need to be asked is when did their 14:20:10 9 agreement, when did their fraudulent concealment happen? 14:20:13 and then when we get to the conspiracy question, you are 14:20:15 going to be asked when did the conspiracy happen. 14:20:18 of course, it happened before 1982. we showed you 14:20:21 all that. 14:20:21 and did it continue? of course it did. 14:20:23 they kept lying. lied to congress in '94. they 14:20:27 did not do anything until 2000. 14:20:29 of course, it kept going on and on. okay? 14:20:31 now, so we submit to you that, yes, they are 14:20:33 liable, that their fraud and concealment was before and 14:20:36 after. okay. it was both, before and after. 14:20:38 and then their conspiracy, you are going to be 14:20:40 instructed that for this question and the next question, 14:20:42 the engle findings, remember, they will be -- they will 14:20:45 have taken hold. and you have to give her the benefit of 14:20:48 those findings. 155 14:20:49 1 and you are going to be instructed that they 14:20:52 2 concealed information. you cannot question it. it is 14:20:55 3 already been determined. 14:20:56 4 and you are going to be instructed that they 14:20:57 5 engaged in a conspiracy, an agreement with each other. 14:21:00 6 remember that plaza hotel meeting in 1954? and it 14:21:04 7 continued. they said -- you know, they got their plan for 14:21:07 8 their campaign of doubt and their truth squad. remember 14:21:11 9 all of that? that is what they did. and that conspiracy 14:21:13 continued and continued and continued. until at least 14:21:17 after she had copd. if not further. at least until 1999. 14:21:25 now, let us go to -- let us go to damages. you 14:21:33 know, you have heard about -- actually, let us talk about -- 14:21:37 can you bring up exhibit 177? and then 129? 14:21:41 these are the two ftc reports. 14:21:45 dr. kyriakoudes talked about advertising. and i 14:21:48 do not want you to forget, one thing the ftc determined, 14:21:52 okay, well, they are going to tell you that miss davis 14:21:54 did not hear any of this. miss davis did not know anything 14:21:56 about -- she cannot remember an advertisement she relied on 14:21:59 and that kind of stuff. she cannot remember. 14:22:01 well, i mean, who can remember. i mean, let us 14:22:04 think about like cereal. can you remember what fruit loop 14:22:09 commercial you saw as a kid? what day you heard it? what 14:22:12 time? all of these questions. no. 156 14:22:13 1 but do you know that cereal advertising had an 14:22:15 2 impact? probably. 14:22:18 3 you think people advertise for no reason? 14:22:20 4 remember dr. robert heimann said -- he was the 14:22:25 5 deposition where he said the surgeon general is wrong, dead 14:22:27 6 wrong. and i disagree with the cancer society and medical 14:22:31 7 doctors. and i know better than medical doctors. remember 14:22:34 8 that guy? 14:22:35 9 he said, we expect people to trust our 14:22:38 advertising. it is truthful. it is our promise to the 14:22:40 customer. that is what he said. 14:22:41 and then what did they do in the advertising? 14:22:41 cigarette advertising reaches virtually all americans who 14:22:44 can either read or understand the spoken word. 14:22:47 cigarettes are advertised on both network and spot 14:22:49 television, on radio, in magazines, and in newspapers, in 14:22:53 outdoor media, and by means of many types of points of sale 14:22:56 of advertising aids. 14:22:58 so pervasive is cigarette advertising that it is 14:23:01 virtually impossible for persons of almost any age to avoid 14:23:06 cigarette advertising. 14:23:07 they ramped it up, too. that is the '67 surgeon 14:23:10 general report. 14:23:10 the '81 surgeon general report -- jeff -- that is 14:23:13 the one -- i will not read it. that is the one that tells us 157 14:23:16 1 they spent more than one day on advertising than the public 14:23:20 2 health authority spent in a year, telling people not to 14:23:24 3 smoke. 14:23:24 4 that is a lot of power. that is a lot of money. 14:23:29 5 and all for what? because -- 14:23:37 6 we will not pull this document up. but it was 14:23:39 7 exhibit 72. exhibit 72 i submit to you is worth reading. 14:23:42 8 and if you can pull exhibit 72. it is a 1982 14:23:46 9 document, after the may 5, 1982, date. 14:23:49 december 1982. talks about the exit and entry 14:23:52 gates. you know, if the exit gates are ever opened, our 14:23:56 people flood out, our business will be out of business 14:23:58 overnight. 14:23:59 read the document. exhibit 72. it will be back 14:24:02 there with you. you can read it. 14:24:04 we cannot ever be comfortable selling a product 14:24:06 which most of our customers could stop using if they could. 14:24:12 so then that comes down to damages that we are 14:24:21 going to see in this case. and you will be instructed. i'm 14:24:23 not going to waste my time. you read the jury 14:24:24 instructions. 14:24:25 i mean, i cannot emphasize enough that when you 14:24:27 have a question on the verdict form, first go to the jury 14:24:30 instructions and read exactly what you are instructed to do, 14:24:33 because that is your bible, so to speak, on this issue. 158 14:24:36 1 and, you know, i told you originally when i came 14:24:39 2 in that i was going to, you know, have to ask for a 14:24:42 3 substantial number, and i thought the evidence would 14:24:46 4 support that. 14:24:47 5 and, you know, it is not easy to come up with a 14:24:50 6 number that you ask for in a case like this. you know, if 14:24:53 7 somebody had -- if somebody had like a car injury, hurt 14:24:57 8 themselves and broke a leg or something, and they were out 14:25:00 9 of commission for a week or two, and then maybe i'd have to 14:25:04 come in here and ask for thousands of dollars or $10,000 or 14:25:07 something like that. 14:25:09 you know, the amount and what is the injury, how 14:25:11 debilitating, and how long is the recovery period is how i 14:25:15 would look at that. 14:25:16 but then, you know, i guess if somebody has some 14:25:18 sort of injury, you know, their leg is completely -- it 14:25:20 will never be better again. it is been destroyed. it has 14:25:25 pins in it. they will never walk the same again. and that is 14:25:27 going to be for a long time. or maybe it is going to be ten 14:25:30 years of rehabilitation to ever get back. it is a longer 14:25:34 period of time, serious injury. then i have to come in and 14:25:37 ask for hundreds of thousands for something like that. 14:25:39 but, you know, when an injury is fatal, you are 14:25:43 never going to get better. it is only going to get worse. 14:25:45 you are going to have to live with it forever. you are going 159 14:25:49 1 to die with it prematurely. you are going to leave people 14:25:52 2 behind. that kind of injury is where i have to get in the 14:25:57 3 millions. 14:25:59 4 and, you know, miss davis, she -- you know, you 14:26:03 5 can talk about comparative fault. she is taken her part of 14:26:10 6 the fault. she got copd. she is a vibrant, you know, 14:26:14 7 firefighter -- or tried to become a firefighter and was a 14:26:19 8 police officer. 14:26:19 9 and then ultimately, you know, had the rib injury. 14:26:23 but then she had the copd, and her breathing problems got 14:26:27 worse and worse. 14:26:28 and dr. burns told you what happened. showed you 14:26:30 the graph. she is down to thirty percent now, and she is going 14:26:33 to be hospitalized more and more and more. she is been 14:26:36 tethered to an oxygen tank like this for years. 14:26:40 she puts a breathing tube in her nose. and that 14:26:46 breathing tube she has to breathe with constantly leads to 14:26:51 bloody noses all the time, dry noses. she is got to have 14:26:55 it. she is got to do breathing treatments constantly. 14:26:57 she will never get better. she will only get worse. 14:27:00 she has to think about leaving her lovely son, tommy, 14:27:02 behind, who has a severe brain injury, and worried about 14:27:07 who is going to take care of him when she is gone. 14:27:10 remember, you heard her testify, i just want 14:27:12 somebody who is not going to make fun of him, not going to 160 14:27:14 1 give him a rough time. that is something she thinks about 14:27:17 2 every night. 14:27:17 3 and she is going to have these copd exacerbations. 14:27:21 4 you know, chest. cannot catch a breath. dr. burns 14:27:24 5 explained what happens in the copd exacerbation. 14:27:27 6 when i have to get to that kind of number and i 14:27:30 7 have to ask in the millions, you know, i would encourage 14:27:33 8 you -- it is a number for you to decide. you can go higher 14:27:36 9 than i ask, by the way. but you can go lower, of course, 14:27:39 too. 14:27:40 but i would submit the number, the minimum number, 14:27:42 should correlate to the number of puffs of cigarettes that 14:27:46 we calculated she had. 14:27:48 mr. mccarter: objection, your honor. that is not 14:27:49 a proper basis. 14:27:50 mr. byrd: well, i can explain the basis, your 14:27:51 honor. 14:27:51 the court: okay. 14:27:52 mr. byrd: let me explain the basis. because 14:27:55 dr. burns explained that every puff of a cigarette freezes 14:27:59 the cilia. that is dangerous. and every puff lets 14:28:02 irritants and chemicals and carcinogens come in. every 14:28:07 puff, he said. and it goes over and over. and each one of 14:28:10 those cause damage to your cells and then to your airways, 14:28:13 which lead to copd. 161 14:28:15 1 so it is not one puff that does this. it is 14:28:18 2 7 million puffs doing their job of freezing your cilia and 14:28:21 3 loading you up with irritants over and over and over. 14:28:24 4 so i would ask and submit the appropriate amount 14:28:26 5 of damages for miss davis is $7 million. 14:28:32 6 and the judge will tell you you do not reduce for 14:28:35 7 comparative fault. so if you find that that number is 14:28:39 8 accurate, $7 million, but let us say you found her 14:28:41 9 fifty percent at fault, or whatever; i'm just using that 14:28:44 example. i do not think you should come near fifty percent. 14:28:47 but let us say you use fifty percent fault. that 14:28:49 does not mean you put in $3.5 million. the judge will deal 14:28:52 with those kind of issues. you will put in the full 14:28:56 $7 million and let him deal with comparative fault. 14:28:58 and the comparative fault will go to the first two 14:29:00 claims. they are going to be one hundred percent liable, by the 14:29:04 way, for their intentional torts, for their fraud and their 14:29:06 conspiracy. they will be one hundred percent responsible for that. 14:29:08 now, the last question -- 14:29:11 your honor, could i get an additional minute or 14:29:13 two? 14:29:14 the court: all right. i will give you an 14:29:16 additional five minutes, but i'm going to cut you off in 14:29:19 midstream if you go beyond that. 14:29:20 mr. byrd: sure. that is fine. so that means i'm 162 14:29:22 1 11 minutes. 14:29:23 2 now, there is a final question to be asked about 14:29:31 3 whether punitive damages are warranted. 14:29:33 4 and punitive damages -- if you can get the 14:29:35 5 instruction here, john, the punitive damage instruction. 14:29:47 6 and i apologize. 14:29:54 7 paragraph two says -- here's the standard. you 14:29:59 8 need to read the whole thing. but punitive damages are 14:30:02 9 available if the cigarette companies' conduct is so gross 14:30:06 and flagrant as to show such a reckless disregard of a 14:30:10 conscious indifference to human life or health that an 14:30:13 award of compensatory damages is insufficient to punish 14:30:17 that defendant for its misconduct -- and this is the 14:30:19 important part -- or to deter it from engaging in such 14:30:24 misconduct in the future. 14:30:25 and this is to deter this company and other 14:30:32 companies from doing things like this. a deterrence. 14:30:36 and that is why, you know, you do not put -- we are 14:30:38 not talking about any amount or anything like that. that 14:30:40 would -- is it warranted? did they show reckless disregard 14:30:45 for human life? of course, they did. 14:30:49 and when you consider this question of, you know 14:30:51 -- of this kind of conduct to deter them, you can consider 14:30:59 the kind of conduct that hurt miss davis does not hurt 14:31:02 others. and it does. 163 14:31:04 1 and you even heard from mr. jupe and mr. gentry. 14:31:08 2 pick that up. they both confirmed to you. it is from their 14:31:12 3 own mouths. they know. philip morris and r.j. reynolds. 14:31:16 4 they killed -- 400,000 american customers die every year. 14:31:19 5 they both said it. and dr. burns actually gave 14:31:21 6 you the most recent numbers are 480,000 a year. twenty 14:31:26 7 million have died prematurely. okay? 14:31:30 8 and, you know, we showed you that graph. 14:31:35 9 if you could show the consumption chart, you know, 14:31:38 that lung cancer -- 14:31:40 here's the thing. you know, when miss davis picks 14:31:43 up a cigarette or an individual picks up a cigarette and 14:31:46 you take a smoke, and maybe eventually when you do 14:31:49 understand that there are hazards, you may not know what 14:31:52 hazards mean. you think it is a scratchy throat or a cough 14:31:55 or bronchitis and get over it. 14:31:57 when you really understand this is a lifelong 14:31:59 disease that you will never recover from and that is what 14:32:02 you are dealing with. 14:32:03 you know, you take this puff of the cigarette and 14:32:04 you know of -- you know, you go, well, what are the odds. 14:32:07 maybe i get it, maybe i do not. 14:32:09 you know, the odds are probably worse than a 14:32:11 smoker really wants to acknowledge. but they do think, 14:32:13 well, you know, chance is i do not get anything. i'll be 164 14:32:15 1 fine. that is kind of what they are looking at. that is kind 14:32:17 2 of how they think about it. 14:32:23 3 but when philip morris and r.j. reynolds, they go 14:32:26 4 into the boardroom -- and miss davis wakes up in the 14:32:29 5 morning. philip morris goes into the boardroom, and they 14:32:31 6 sit down, it is not an if. they know it is certain, 400,000 14:32:36 7 a year. 14:32:36 8 they may not know which ones. they may not know 14:32:43 9 which ones or who. they know for certain, that not an if, 14:32:48 400,000 a year. 14:32:49 that is disregard for human life. i cannot think of 14:32:55 a better example for facts to meet the definition. read 14:33:00 the definition of punitive damage and try to explain how 14:33:03 that is not a disregard for human life to keep up this kind 14:33:07 of conduct. 14:33:09 and then to start, you know, let us go find the 14:33:13 children. why? because we showed you the evidence. 14:33:18 the children start -- 95 percent of their business 14:33:21 starts between 14 and 25. 14:33:26 and let us get the children. because they know 14:33:28 they are the only place for replacement smoker. today's 14:33:31 teenager is tomorrow's regular customer. they are saying 14:33:34 that in '81. 14:33:35 the surgeon general report from 2012 -- i'm not 14:33:38 going to pull it back up here. they said it continues. 165 14:33:40 1 they are still doing it. 14:33:41 2 back here, they were studying kids. remember, we 14:33:44 3 put up -- it is exhibit 595. it is not on the board. 14:33:48 4 exhibit 595. they were studying children with add. in 14:33:53 5 elementary school. what is that? 14:33:57 6 studying kids with add. not to help them with 14:34:00 7 add; to sell them cigarettes. 14:34:02 8 mr. mccarter: objection, your honor. documents 14:34:08 9 said the opposite. 14:34:10 the court: well, i do not remember. it is the 14:34:16 jury's recollection to recall, but, of course, you are free 14:34:17 to refer to that in your summation. 14:34:18 mr. byrd: smoking behavior they were studying. 14:34:20 okay? smoking behavior of children. that is what they were 14:34:24 saying. go find them. 14:34:25 and when we study them, by the way, go get them at 14:34:29 the recreation centers, soda fountains, the lakes, the 14:34:32 pools. why? i did not make this up. it was in the 14:34:35 documents. the parents will not be there. give some more 14:34:36 truthful answers. the parents will not be there. 14:34:39 is that the kind of conduct that needs deterrence 14:34:41 in this country? do we need to deter that kind of conduct 14:34:45 when the 2012 surgeon general report says it still goes on? 14:34:53 yes, i think we do. 14:34:54 this graph is the last thing i'll say. this graph 166 14:34:57 1 shows a tragedy in america. okay? these companies have 14:35:03 2 killed grandparents. they have killed grandmothers. they have 14:35:10 3 killed aunts and uncles. they have killed mommies and 14:35:16 4 daddies. they have killed cousins and siblings, brothers and 14:35:29 5 sisters. 14:35:29 6 and make no mistake, the replacement smokers are 14:35:37 7 children. 14:35:38 8 one of them many years ago was miss davis, eight, 14:35:44 9 ten years old she starts smoking. loses her mom. dad 14:35:52 cannot take care of them. goes into a juvenile home, an 14:36:00 orphanage, a juvenile hall. and she smokes away there. 14:36:02 why? because everybody did it. because back then 14:36:02 they thought -- because that is what you did back then. you 14:36:06 let kids smoke. 14:36:07 this case warrants punitive damages. and 14:36:15 precisely because of the exact same type of conduct that 14:36:18 they engaged in that hurt miss davis. 14:36:22 can she point to a specific advertisement? no. 14:36:26 do you think any of the 400,000 people -- do you think 14:36:30 anybody can point to the specific ad that they remember? 14:36:33 but, you know, i promise you, people of that 14:36:34 generation, people who -- you all are young. but there is a 14:36:40 lot of people from a different generation. if you were 14:36:42 alive during this time in the '30s, '40s, and '50s and 14:36:46 you heard call for philip morris, you knew that. everyone 167 14:36:53 1 knew that. 14:36:54 2 walk a mile for a camel. you knew it. it did not 14:36:58 3 just not have an impact. of course it had an impact. 14:37:01 4 reliance? what was miss davis' reliance on this, 14:37:06 5 you are going to be asked? did she rely before 1982, after 14:37:13 6 1982? 14:37:16 7 every time. she lit and puffed this away. here's 14:37:21 8 her reliance. one after the other. from 1950 until 2005. 14:37:27 9 thank you for your time. miss davis appreciates 14:37:30 your time and your careful consideration of all the 14:37:34 evidence as long as you need to make sure you do the right 14:37:38 thing.
