11 mr. persons: counsel, mrs. ellis, ladies and 12 gentlemen, good afternoon. 13 jurors: good afternoon. 14 mr. persons: this case is about clarence 15 ellis and unfiltered lucky strikes. when i came 16 before you for opening statement, that is what i 17 said, and that is still true, and that is what i plan 18 to spend my time before you talking about. 19 before i get into the meat of my argument, i 20 would be remiss if i did not say thank you for the 21 time that you have devoted to this case, taking time 22 out of your lives for the past two weeks and one 23 day, and on behalf of i think everyone associated 24 with this process, i simply want to say thank you 25 for that. 3230 1 now, on to the case at hand. and -- put up a 2 board. i think that the information that you need 3 in order to answer the questions on the verdict 4 form are contained in this list. and the evidence 5 in this case has shown that mr. ellis did not start 6 smoking or continue smoking because of anything 7 that the tobacco companies said or did. 8 for one thing, he grew up on a tobacco -- a 9 farm that raised tobacco and raised it 10 commercially. he grew up around it. his father 11 smoked roll-your-own cigarettes. he began smoking 12 when he was 18. we will get into that in a minute. 13 that is going to be what the overwhelming evidence 14 demonstrates. 15 and there was not anything in advertising that 16 caused him to start smoking or to continue to 17 smoke. he was warned about the dangers of smoking 18 throughout his life, ever since he was a small 19 child, because his father urged him not to smoke. 20 and we will talk about that. 21 despite knowing that smoking was dangerous, he 22 continued to smoke. there is no dispute about 23 that. mr. ellis did not have primary lung cancer. 24 you heard dr. okun testify about how the workup was 25 such that you could not conclude that it was, in 3231 1 fact, a cancer that started in his lung, and that is 2 what a primary lung cancer means, that it started 3 there. 4 mr. ellis had the ability to quit smoking and, 5 thereby, to prevent his death. lots of evidence 6 about that, including what dr. jaffe shared with 7 you, but also some other evidence that came from 8 mrs. ellis. 9 now, you heard a lot about the engle findings. 10 the court: is everybody able to see the 11 screen? okay. 12 mr. persons: and if you cannot -- thank you, 13 judge. 14 the court: okay. 15 mr. persons: but it was not necessary to 16 reprove the engle findings, because as i mentioned 17 before in opening, engle findings have already been 18 proven, they were considered by another jury. they 19 do not come into play in this case until there is a 20 determination that mr. ellis is a member of the 21 engle class. that has to be done. that is the 22 first thing that has to be done before the engle 23 findings come into play at all. 24 now, let me talk about some of the things that 25 this case is not about but you heard some things 3232 1 about. 2 you heard about filters, when dr. cummings was 3 testifying he talked about filtered cigarettes. 4 well, mr. ellis primarily smoked unfiltered lucky 5 strike cigarettes. if he bummed a filtered 6 cigarette, he would tear the filter off. 7 he smoked less than two cartons of any other 8 cigarette, including winston. it was a filtered 9 cigarette. so it was all unfiltered lucky strike 10 that he smoked. so evidence on filters has nothing 11 to do with the case. 12 addiction design. it is been known that 13 cigarettes are inhalable since the 1800s when they 14 were invented in turkey back in the 1860s. and 15 from there they went to england and then to the 16 united states. reynolds did not make its first 17 commercial cigarette until 1913. 18 cigarettes are by definition inhalable. there 19 is no such thing as a cigarette that is not 20 inhalable, as opposed to other forms of tobacco. 21 chewing tobacco or smoking cigars. most cigar 22 smokers do not inhale because it is too harsh. 23 cigarettes with or without additives are 24 equally dangerous. we heard that concession from 25 dr. cummings when he was on the stand. whether 3233 1 they have got additives or they do not have additives, 2 they are equally dangerous because there is no such 3 thing as a safe cigarette. 4 and while we are talking about additives, lucky 5 strike between 1974 and 19 -- and for the rest of 6 the time that mr. ellis smoked lucky strike, they 7 did not have ammonia. 8 and you can look at that list of ingredients 9 that is in the interrogatory answer that will be in 10 evidence and you will not find for lucky strike 11 anything about levulinic acid. it simply is not 12 there. so those are red herrings. they have 13 nothing to do with mr. ellis or with unfiltered 14 lucky strikes. 15 roll-your-own cigarettes are more dangerous 16 and addictive than commercial cigarettes. it took 17 some doing to get that from dr. cummings and to 18 confront him with several transcripts from prior 19 testimony but he conceded that, that roll-your-own 20 cigarettes are more dangerous and more addictive 21 than commercial cigarettes. 22 no surgeon general in the history of the 23 united states has said that a no-nicotine cigarette 24 is somehow safer than a cigarette containing 25 nicotine. it is just never been said. surgeon 3234 1 general said a lot of things, but he is never said 2 that. 3 smokers today are no more addicted than prior 4 generations. that is just a simple fact. and 5 bottom line, cigarettes cannot be made safe. 6 cigarettes are a dangerous product, they are an 7 addictive product. there is no such thing as a 8 safe cigarette. 9 now, dr. cummings on cross-examination 10 testified, i asked him, in fact, dr. cummings, you 11 do not know whether it is even possible to achieve a 12 concentration of levulinic acid in tobacco that is 13 low enough to result in increased binding of 14 nicotine to the nicotinic receptors in the brain, 15 do you, sir? 16 and he said, "no." because you see the more 17 levulinic acids you have, the less binding effect 18 it has on the nicotine to the acetylcholine 19 receptors, and the lower it is, the inverse is 20 true, the greater the binding effect. 21 and he simply did not know that. he does not 22 know at what level the levulinic acid has to be to 23 result in an increase of the binding effect. and 24 that is very important. 25 you heard a lot about marketing to youth, 3235 1 marketing to people between the ages of 14 and 24. 2 well, mr. ellis started smoking at age 18 or after. 3 mrs. ellis tells us that, that it was after he 4 graduated from high school. i think she is in a 5 position to know. 6 they started dating when they were 16. she 7 was a smoker before he was. if he was smoking or 8 was attempting to smoke, he could have bummed a 9 cigarette from her. but she never saw him smoke 10 until after he graduated at 18. 11 barbara dixon, longtime friend, who grew up 12 with the ellises said it was after he graduated 13 from high school. 14 martha dukes, sister, said she first saw him 15 with a cigarette in his hand after he got married. 16 he got married in 1956. 17 martha jean martin, who met them in the '60s, 18 that is the first time she saw him smoke. 19 the only person who has him smoking at the age 20 of 17, was richard harvey, who was in the first 21 grade at the time, and he is recounting something 22 that happened 60 years ago because the man is now 23 67 years old and said that he saw him smoke a 24 cigarette when he was in the first grade. that is 25 the only evidence there is of him smoking prior to 3236 1 the time that he was 18 years old. 2 so to claim that he was smoking as a 12 or 3 13-year-old, as a teenager as opposed to as an 4 adult at the age of 18, is simply not supported in 5 the evidence. 6 we have heard a lot about advertising. and 7 there is nothing illegal about advertising. it is 8 legal to advertise cigarettes just like it is to 9 advertise other products. there are other products 10 that are dangerous that were advertised. there is 11 no evidence that mr. ellis began smoking because of 12 advertising, none whatsoever. 13 dr. cummings testified that the most 14 influential factor to start smoking is family and 15 friends who smoke. if you have got a girlfriend or a 16 boyfriend or you have got some other friend or you have 17 got a parent who smokes, that is a much greater 18 predictor of who will begin smoking than 19 advertising. dr. cummings testified to that 20 effect. that is the most influential factor. 21 there is no evidence that he continued smoking 22 because of cigarette advertising. none. none 23 whatsoever. 24 mrs. ellis testified it was his decision to 25 start smoking, even though she was a smoker before 3237 1 he was, she said she did not do anything to 2 influence him to start smoking, that the decision 3 to start smoking was his decision. 4 now let us get back to mr. ellis and the issues 5 that you have to decide in this case. 6 and our position is that the plaintiff failed 7 to meet her burden of proof. and remember the 8 plaintiff has the burden of proof on each and every 9 one of these issues. 10 plaintiff has to prove class membership. and 11 in order to do that, plaintiff has to prove medical 12 causation, addiction, and addiction causation. 13 then the next issue, concealment, agreement to 14 conceal, the plaintiff has to prove that there was 15 something that was concealed from mr. ellis that 16 but for that information, he would not have died of 17 what the plaintiff contends is a smoking-related 18 disease. that is the plaintiff's burden. and i'm 19 going to walk through each of those things right 20 now. 21 the first question that you will have on the 22 verdict form, "do you find that clarence c. ellis 23 was addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine and 24 that mr. ellis had lung cancer," that is a cancer 25 that started in the lung, "and if so, that his 3238 1 addiction was a legal cause of his lung cancer and 2 his death?" 3 in order to demonstrate that, the plaintiff 4 has to prove medical causation. number one, the 5 plaintiff has to prove that clarence ellis died 6 from lung cancer and it was caused by smoking. 7 number two, the plaintiff has to prove that 8 clarence ellis was addicted to nicotine. 9 and then number three, even if he was 10 addicted, even if clarence ellis was addicted, 11 plaintiff must prove addiction was a legal cause of 12 clarence ellis's death. we are going to walk 13 through the evidence on each and every one of those 14 issues. 15 let us talk about medical causation. plaintiff 16 failed to prove that mr. ellis died from a primary 17 lung cancer caused by smoking. it is not r.j. 18 reynolds' burden to prove that he did not die of a 19 primary lung cancer, it is plaintiff's burden to 20 prove that he did. 21 the only board certified medical oncologist 22 specializing in the treatment of cancer, including 23 lung cancer, and who sees cancer patients on a 24 daily basis and has treated tens of thousands of 25 cancer patients was dr. david okun. and dr. david 3239 1 okun said that the pathologic diagnosis was 2 generic. to say that it is a large undifferentiated 3 carcinoma is a generic diagnosis. it does not tell 4 you anything about where the cancer started. 5 he said the presentation and clinical course 6 were inconsistent with primary lung cancer. and 7 presentation is how the symptoms that the patient 8 presented with to the doctor's office. 9 mr. ellis did not have the signs or symptoms of 10 a primary lung cancer. you remember dr. okun said 11 that if that were the case, he would have had 12 coughing, a certain kind and not the kind that you 13 would call a -- associated with copd. said there 14 would be a cough that he would have. he would have 15 wheezing. he would have hemoptysis or coughing up 16 blood. he would have those symptoms if, in fact, 17 he had a primary lung cancer. 18 he said if he had a primary lung cancer, it 19 would have been larger than this singular 1 1/2 20 centimeter nodule in his chest. he said the 21 information from the medical workup was 22 insufficient to establish primary lung cancer, and 23 he said it was not the quantity of the number of 24 records, but the quality. 25 and what he meant by that was looking at the 3240 1 pathology, because you have got to look at it under 2 the microscope to determine what kind of cancer 3 cell it is, and then determine where the cancer 4 came from, and they were unable to do that based on 5 the pathology. 6 and let us look at some of the records. now, 7 dr. okun, one other thing before we leave dr. okun, 8 dr. okun said that you could not tell where the 9 cancer started. and i believe plaintiff's counsel 10 said, well, they did all of these scans in the 11 abdominal region and the pelvic region and they 12 did not see any masses. 13 well, they did a bone scan and they missed the 14 mass in his spine. dr. okun testified that these 15 scans are not always accurate, that you can miss 16 things on these scans, and probably the best 17 evidence of that or illustration of it was when 18 they missed the mass in his spine when they did the 19 bone scan. it was only later that they made a -- 20 did subsequent scans and found the mass in his 21 back, at the cervical and thoracic regions of his 22 spine. 23 now, dr. bilek prepared and signed these 24 records. there are some other records in here that 25 have some inconsistent things on them that were 3241 1 prepared by other people that have dr. bilek signed 2 off on them. but he prepared himself and signed 3 these records and in each of these instances, he 4 says "unknown primary, question, mark lung." 5 now, this was the radiation oncologist who was 6 treating this patient. not someone who saw him on 7 one or two occasions but the person who was 8 treating his cancer. and the radiation that he 9 administered to him was to that mass in his back. 10 at no time did he ever treat or administer 11 radiation to the nodule in his lung. he treated 12 the mass in mr. ellis's back. 13 now, what did dr. sheedy and mccoy have to 14 say? well, dr. sheedy, who is involved in 15 palliative care, he saw mr. ellis two times, but 16 there is only one note in the record, by 17 dr. sheedy. he had no role in diagnosing mr. 18 ellis's cancer. he decided whether mr. ellis 19 should undergo chemo. 20 and he is not certified in oncology, and then 21 he did not pass the hematology exam. that is no 22 knock on him, that is just a fact in terms of 23 qualifications, and those are the kinds of things 24 you are to take into account. 25 in that expert witness jury instruction it 3242 1 says you are to take into account the witness's 2 skill, knowledge, education, experience, and 3 training. and so that goes to that in terms of 4 whether you credit that testimony or discredit it, 5 his qualifications have bearing on it. 6 dr. mccoy involved in family practice handed 7 off mr. ellis to the other doctors in september of 8 1992. he had ten-minute visits with him in 9 september and october. there are no records of his 10 beyond october of 1992, and there is no evidence 11 about how he went about completing the death 12 certificate. 13 while we are talking about death certificates, 14 let me say a thing or two. a death certificate is 15 not conclusive proof of the cause of death. if 16 that were the case, we would not have heard from all 17 these doctors in this case. it is not conclusive. 18 that is just his opinion, dr. mccoy, who is in 19 family practice and is not involved in oncology. 20 that is not his specialty. 21 dr. sheedy did not prove the plaintiff's 22 theory, he did no research on cancer causation in 23 individual patients. he said i believe it was 80 24 percent of the people who have lung cancer are 25 smokers, but while that applies to a population of 3243 1 people, it does not necessarily apply to an 2 individual. you have to judge an individual on 3 that individual -- on an individual basis. 4 he does not know the generally-accepted 5 scientific criteria for determining cancer 6 causation in an individual patient. and this was 7 an individual patient. we are talking about 8 mr. ellis. 9 this formula was a rather crude one, smoking 10 history of 34 years at two packs a day or two to 11 three packs a day plus lung cancer means that, 12 well, the cigarettes must have caused the lung 13 cancer. well, it is not that simple. 14 it is a lot more complicated than that, as 15 dr. okun testified, there are 140 different kinds 16 of cancer, and you have to look at cells. all lung 17 cancers are not the same kind of cell type. so it is 18 a lot more complicated than just saying somebody 19 smoked, they got lung cancer, so the smoking must 20 have caused it. 21 and dr. sheedy was asked this question, "what 22 have you done to rule out the possibility that this 23 is a case of unknown primary?" and his response 24 was, "i have done nothing. i was not his treating 25 physician. i was a consultant." and this was read 3244 1 back to him and he agreed that that was read 2 correctly, that had been his testimony in a 3 deposition. 4 let us look at dr. mccoy. dr. mccoy testified 5 that mr. ellis did not have any other risk factors 6 for cancer, but then he turned around and he 7 admitted that family history of cancer was relevant 8 to an individual cancer incidence. 9 and we know from the evidence that mr. ellis's 10 mother died of uterine cancer at the age of 44 and 11 that his sister had both colon cancer and she also 12 had cervical cancer. so he had that particular 13 risk factor. 14 dr. burns offered contradictory opinions on 15 the medical issue. dr. burns explained that the 16 cancer in mr. ellis's lung spread when the tumor 17 broke through the lining and entered the 18 bloodstream. 19 he did not mention anything about the lymph 20 system, which, as dr. okun pointed out, it would go 21 first to the hilar lymph nodes and the mediastinal 22 lymph nodes before it would go to any other part of 23 the body, and he did not have any signs of enlarged 24 lymph nodes in those regions of his body. so 25 that is a contraindication of a primary lung cancer. 3245 1 and then a second opinion on this, dr. burns, 2 said that mr. ellis's tumor was isolated and it did 3 not break through the lining of the lung. it cannot 4 be both things, but he gave conflicting views on 5 that. 6 the bottom line, plaintiff failed to prove by 7 a preponderance of the evidence, greater weight of 8 the evidence, that mr. ellis had a primary lung 9 cancer caused by smoking. 10 now let us talk about addiction. in order to 11 establish class membership, not only must plaintiff 12 prove that mr. ellis had a primary lung cancer 13 caused by smoking, it also has to prove that 14 mr. ellis was addicted to cigarettes containing 15 nicotine. 16 the only expert who came in this case to 17 testify who has expertise in substance abuse was 18 dr. jaffe. a psychologist who came down. he is 19 treated smokers for nicotine addiction for 30 20 years. and while he has not published as much as 21 some of the other experts, he is spent a lot of time 22 treating patients, because that is how he spends his 23 time, treating patients. 24 he applied the american psychiatric 25 association diagnostic criteria to mr. ellis and 3246 1 found no clinically-significant impairment. and 2 that is what you have got to do, that is the threshold 3 determination before you can get into those 11 4 factors that mr. -- that dr. jaffe discussed that 5 are set out in the dsm-5. 6 the threshold determination is did the 7 substance cause the patient clinically-significant 8 impairment or distress. and he did not find signs 9 of it. we will talk about what did cause 10 clinically-significant impairment or distress to 11 mr. ellis. it was the alcohol, it was not the 12 nicotine. 13 his opinion was that mr. ellis was not 14 addicted according to the diagnostic statistical 15 manual of mental disorders, which is the reference 16 that people in that field use to diagnose substance 17 abuse in their patients in treating their patients. 18 plaintiff's expert said he was addicted 19 basically because he smoked a lot. dr. cummings 20 said he smoked a lot and he smoked early in the 21 morning, first cigarette within the first five 22 minutes of getting up, and so, therefore, under the 23 fagerstrom test that he was addicted. 24 dr. burns said, well, he smoked a lot, he 25 smoked two to three packs over 34 years then he 3247 1 must be addicted. dr. sheedy testified that he 2 applied a subjective method. 3 said the man had discoloration on his fingers 4 and on his tongue and on his mouth, smoked two to 5 three packs a day for 30-some years, therefore, 6 he is addicted. well, it is not that simple, as 7 dr. jaffe pointed out. it is a lot more complicated 8 than that. 9 therefore, plaintiff failed to prove that 10 mr. ellis was addicted to cigarettes. 11 next hurdle that plaintiff has to get over, 12 proving that addiction was a legal cause of 13 clarence ellis's death. and here is the jury 14 instruction for class membership. 15 "an addiction to smoking cigarettes containing 16 nicotine is a legal cause of cancer and death if it 17 directly and in a natural and continuous sequence 18 produces or contributes substantially to producing 19 such cancer and death so that it can be reasonably 20 said that but for an addiction to cigarettes 21 containing nicotine, the cancer and death would not 22 have occurred." 23 but for. that is what it means when something 24 is a substantial contributing factor. it has to 25 rise to that level. that but for the addiction, 3248 1 that he would not have died. and that is assuming 2 addiction. so even if you found that he was 3 addicted, plaintiff would have to demonstrate that 4 but for the addiction, mr. ellis would not have 5 died. 6 and that assumes that he was unable to quit in 7 time to save his own life. and we know that he was 8 capable of quitting, because millions and millions 9 of addicted, heavily-addicted smokers have quit, 10 they do quit. 11 dr. david burns, who has been involved in all 12 these surgeon general's reports, came in here and 13 testified, he said millions and millions of smokers 14 who quit were heavily addicted to nicotine. 15 dr. cummings said ninety percent of the people -- 16 well, he and dr. burns said ninety percent of the 17 people who quit were heavily addicted. and they 18 both agree that millions of smokers quit cold 19 turkey. in fact, ninety percent of them do. not only 20 are ninety percent of them heavily addicted, but 90 21 percent of them quit cold turkey. but in order to 22 do that, you have got to be motivated. 23 now, you heard some statistics during the 24 trial. and i want to recap some of that now. 25 between 1955 and 1965, 17.6 million people 3249 1 quit smoking. between 1964, the surgeon general's 2 report came out, and 1979, some 30 million people 3 kicked the habit. and as of 2014, 60 million 4 people have quit. there are more former smokers 5 than current smokers. 6 and just to illustrate the numbers, if you 7 were to put all those 60 million smokers who quit, 8 it would fill doak campbell stadium 729 times, 9 that is how many people kicked the habit. and 90 10 percent of them did it without the benefit of any 11 aids, cessation tools, they did it cold turkey. 12 now, plaintiff has admitted that the acts of 13 mr. ellis relating to the duration and frequency of 14 his efforts to stop smoking were a partial legal 15 cause of mr. ellis's cancer and his death. 16 plaintiff has admitted that. that his acts 17 relating to the duration of his smoking and the 18 frequency of his efforts to stop smoking were a 19 partial legal cause of mr. ellis's death. 20 now, mrs. ellis testified during the course of 21 the trial and when asked, "you believe it is his 22 fault for not quitting sooner and for not starting 23 to begin with, do not you?" and she said yes, that 24 was his fault. it was not the fault of r.j. 25 reynolds that he started smoking or that he did not 3250 1 quit sooner. it was his fault. 2 now, what does this admission mean, when you 3 break it down? that mr. ellis knew that smoking 4 was dangerous, yet he continued to smoke. he was 5 not confused about the dangers and addictiveness of 6 smoking. mr. ellis had the ability to quit smoking 7 earlier. and he could have tried harder to quit 8 smoking. mr. ellis had the ability to quit smoking 9 at a time that would have prevented his death. 10 it comes down to this, did mr. ellis have the 11 ability to quit but chose to continue smoking? 12 evidently, he did, because if you are saying that 13 he is partly at fault for not making a greater 14 effort to quit sooner, then he had the ability to 15 quit. 16 mr. sales: object, your honor, that misstates 17 the plaintiff's admission. 18 the court: overruled. 19 mr. persons: it means did he have the ability 20 to quit but chose to continue smoking, or did 21 nicotine control mr. ellis and leave him no choice 22 no matter how hard he tried, but to continue 23 smoking until his death? 24 and even their experts, dr. cummings and 25 dr. burns, said -- they used -- dr. cummings used 3251 1 the term "constrained choice". and i remember 2 asking him, "well, does the surgeon general use 3 that term?" he said, "no, it is something i made 4 up." 5 constrained choice. even he did not say that 6 the smoker had no choice. he never said mr. ellis 7 had no choice. mr. ellis would have to have no 8 choice in order to be compelled to the point that 9 addiction controlled him to the point that he 10 smoked until he died. 11 you cannot say on the one hand, that he had the 12 ability to quit and was somewhat addicted but 13 somehow the addiction controlled him to the point 14 that he could not quit. 15 dr. cummings said a smoker is fully 16 responsible for making the choice to quit. that is 17 plaintiff's expert. 18 a smoker is fully responsible, not partly 19 responsible, fully responsible for making the 20 choice to quit. mr. ellis never made that choice. 21 dr. burns also said that smokers, including 22 addicted smokers, are responsible for their smoking 23 behavior. addicted smokers do not lose control 24 over their behavior. that was his testimony. and 25 so what was it about mr. ellis that was different 3252 1 from those 60 million people who quit? why is he 2 different than the 60 million who quit? 3 were the cigarettes he was smoking more 4 addictive than the other cigarettes that the other 5 60 million people were smoking? no. 6 was mr. ellis's brain affected differently 7 than the smokers who quit? no. 8 was mr. ellis exposed to advertising that was 9 different than the people who quit? no. 10 was he exposed to tobacco company statements 11 different than the smokers who quit? no. 12 did mr. ellis smoke more or longer than the 13 smokers who quit? no. 14 was mr. ellis somehow different from 15 mrs. ellis, who chose to quit and successfully 16 quit? no. 17 did mr. ellis choose to continue smoking 18 because he liked it and did not want to quit? yes. 19 he enjoyed smoking. there is nothing wrong 20 with that. and we certainly do not impugn anything 21 by his character or that he is somehow wrong to do 22 that. of course not. this is a free country. if 23 you want to enjoy something and you can go into the 24 store and get it, that is your business. in fact, 25 that was the view that mr. ellis took according to 3253 1 mrs. ellis. "you tend to your business and i'll 2 tend to my business." 3 and the evidence is any smoker can quit. 4 there is nobody that is come into this courtroom and 5 testified that a smoker cannot quit. none of these 6 experts have come in here and said that, well, a 7 smoker cannot quit. 8 they say any smoker can quit. dr. cummings 9 said, "anyone who wants to quit can quit." 10 dr. burns said, "it is up to the smoker to continue 11 smoking or to make the decision to quit." 12 now, some smokers just want to smoke. 13 dr. cummings, "some smokers enjoy smoking and they 14 want to continue smoking." even some of the people 15 who would come in or call in on the help line when 16 he was working in new york, and he said, "some 17 people would come in and they would say, well, 18 yeah, i want to, i want to quit, but they did not 19 want to quit, they enjoyed it." 20 dr. sheedy said, "some smokers have no desire 21 to stop smoking." 22 dr. mccoy acknowledged that some smokers do 23 not want to quit. and dr. jaffe, i think it was 24 one of the last questions he answered yesterday 25 afternoon said that even heavy smokers enjoy 3254 1 smoking. 2 i believe the question was, "do you know 3 anyone or have you had a patient who smoked for 34 4 years, two to three packs a day, who did not enjoy 5 smoking?" and he took a moment to think about it 6 and he said, "no, i've never had a patient who 7 presented with that history who did not enjoy 8 smoking. some smokers just want to smoke." 9 we know that mr. ellis made his own decisions. 10 an intelligent man, very determined man, extremely 11 hard working, described as a workaholic, strong 12 minded and strong-willed individual. in the words 13 of i think it was martha dixon, either she or 14 martha jean martin, said he had good old common 15 horse sense, or as what some of the folks used to 16 say just walking-around sense. 17 he was independent. he would be more 18 persistent if someone told him something would not 19 work. if you told him -- you wanted to challenge 20 him, you would tell him that something that he had 21 proposed would not work, and he would work harder 22 and demonstrate to you that it would work. i 23 believe his nephew said that anything he put his 24 mind to, he could do it. 25 now, we know he did not want to quit smoking. 3255 1 we know that he enjoyed smoking. he told people 2 that he did. mrs. ellis did not believe mr. ellis 3 when he said he was going to quit. she quit 4 smoking in the mid '70s for a year. and then in 5 the early '80s, about 1981, she quit again. and at 6 that point in time, she approached him and said, 7 "well, you going to quit?" he said, "yeah." but 8 she did not believe him. 9 and then on another occasion, she approached 10 him about quitting and he said, "i'm not ready to 11 quit. i'm not ready to quit." he did not say "i 12 cannot quit. it is too difficult to quit." he said, 13 "i'm not ready to quit." 14 now, mrs. ellis said that mr. ellis was aware 15 of the health risks when he tried to quit. she 16 testified that mr. ellis attempted to quit 10 to 15 17 times over the course of their married life 18 together. some of these quit attempts would last 19 two hours, some of them would last as long as two 20 days. 21 you heard a lot of evidence about people 22 telling mr. ellis to quit smoking. when one of his 23 sisters, i believe it was sally opal harrison, told 24 him that if he continued to smoke cigarettes, he 25 would get cancer, he shrugged his shoulders. 3256 1 when his daughters urged him to quit smoking, 2 he ignored them. when others approached him about 3 quitting, he would point to articles on the 4 refrigerator, and basically tell them to leave him 5 alone. mrs. ellis described it as to "stop messing 6 with me." 7 people would mess with him about his smoking, 8 that is what he would do. all evidence of the fact 9 that he did not want to quit. you know he did not 10 want to quit. 11 going back to mrs. ellis's testimony, "because 12 smoking was his business, was not it? 13 "that is correct. 14 "and he felt that smoking was not their 15 business; right?" 16 answer was, "right." 17 question: "he was the type of person who was 18 of the opinion that you tend to your business and 19 i'll tend to mine?" 20 answer: "yes." 21 he made his own smoking decisions. did not 22 want people to bother him about it. and that was 23 his prerogative, that was his prerogative. 24 we know that he was not motivated to quit, and 25 we know that that is an essential ingredient in 3257 1 order to quit. you have to be motivated to quit 2 and you have to be persistent about it. 3 dr. jaffe told us that "motivation is 4 critically important to quitting. many smokers do 5 not want to quit and try to quit only because their 6 family members are bugging them." i think he 7 called that external motivation. 8 "motivated smokers seek help from others when 9 they try to quit." and just because you are a 10 quiet person does not mean that you do not seek help 11 trying to quit. there is no evidence that 12 mr. ellis ever sought any help trying to quit 13 smoking. mr. ellis's behavior did not show a 14 desire to quit. 15 now, when mr. ellis was motivated to quit 16 drinking, he did. his family members acknowledged 17 that he was addicted to alcohol and it was a 18 problem for his family and for his marriage. he 19 had problems at work because of drinking. 20 and when mrs. ellis -- when mrs. ellis gave 21 him an ultimatum about his drinking and told him to 22 quit drinking or she would leave him, at that 23 point, mr. ellis had sufficient motivation to go 24 into the detox facility for 30 days, and when he 25 left there, he never took another drop of alcohol. 3258 1 that is motivation to quit. 2 and when dr. jaffe was talking about 3 substantial impairment or distress, he said it had 4 to rise to the level of something that would affect 5 your relationship with your family, affect your 6 relationship with your job. and that is what 7 alcohol did to mr. ellis. that is substantial 8 impairment or distress, a clear illustration of 9 substantial impairment or distress. 10 so let us contrast and compare the two. 11 motivated to quit smoking, question mark. 12 motivated to quit drinking. the smoking, he 13 recognized the risks. for the drinking, he 14 recognized the impact on family and his work. 15 smoking, he did not seek any assistance from 16 anyone. for the drinking, he sought medical 17 assistance. 18 smoking, he quit from two hours to two days. 19 for drinking, he went to a 30-day inpatient rehab 20 facility. 21 he was not motivated to quit smoking. once he 22 got the ultimatum from mrs. ellis, he was motivated 23 to quit drinking. he decided to continue smoking, 24 and he decided to give up drinking. 25 and so the bottom line is once he made a 3259 1 commitment to do something, he followed through on 2 it and he did it. he never made a commitment to 3 quit smoking, and he did not. and that is not 4 because of addiction. that is because he made the 5 decision he did not want to give up the pleasures 6 of smoking. 7 the plaintiff failed to prove that mr. ellis's 8 addiction was the legal cause of his death, that he 9 was somehow robbed of the ability to quit smoking 10 because of addiction. 11 all right, let us see here. can you help me 12 with this? this is a little fuzzy. 13 mr. smith: yes. 14 mr. persons: okay. i hope everybody -- 15 everybody cannot see it. 16 all right. 17 and the first question on the verdict form, 18 "do you find that clarence c. ellis was addicted to 19 cigarettes containing nicotine and if mr. ellis had 20 lung cancer, and if so, that his addiction was a 21 legal cause of his lung cancer and death?" i 22 submit to you the answer to that is no. 23 before i turn to the next topic, let me say 24 something. we do not dispute that mr. ellis told 25 his wife that he wanted to quit smoking for health 3260 1 reasons and that he made an effort to, but he 2 did not have the motivation to follow through and to 3 quit. he was not motivated to quit. 4 the next question, question number 2 on the 5 verdict form, "was r.j. reynolds tobacco company's 6 concealment or omission of material information 7 about the health effects or addictive nature of 8 smoking cigarettes, or both, a legal cause of 9 clarence ellis's death?" 10 number 3, "was r.j. reynolds tobacco company's 11 agreement with other cigarette manufacturers and 12 corporations to conceal or omit information 13 regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their 14 addictive nature a legal cause of clarence c. 15 ellis's death?" 16 the evidence demonstrates that nothing 17 reynolds concealed from mr. ellis or agreed with 18 others to conceal was a legal cause of mr. ellis's 19 death. and i'll walk through that, we will turn to 20 that now. 21 in order to meet her burden of proof on this 22 issue, the plaintiff has to prove that there was 23 something that was concealed or that reynolds in 24 concert with others agreed to conceal that was a 25 legal cause of mr. ellis's death, that had 3261 1 mr. ellis known the -- but for this information, 2 mr. ellis would not have died. 3 and here is the jury instruction. "fraud by 4 concealment or omission is a legal cause of cancer 5 and death if it directly and in a natural and 6 continuous sequence produces or contributes 7 substantially to producing cancer and death so that 8 it can reasonably be said that, but for such fraud 9 by concealment or omission, the cancer and death 10 would not have occurred." 11 so let us look at it this way. because it 12 cannot be both ways. starting in the 1970s, 13 mr. ellis tried to quit smoking because he believed 14 it was bad for his health. mrs. ellis tells us 15 this. that was her testimony. 16 it is either that or starting in the 1970s, 17 mr. ellis put articles on the refrigerator because 18 he believed smoking was safe. we know why he put 19 the articles on the refrigerator, not because he 20 believed smoking was safe. 21 at the same time she is saying he is going 10 to 22 15 times trying to quit for health reasons, that is 23 inconsistent. so how do you reconcile the 24 inconsistency? he put the articles on the 25 refrigerator so people would leave him alone and 3262 1 stop bothering him about smoking, that is why he put 2 the articles up there. 3 and we know very little about those articles. 4 very little about the content of those articles. 5 for one thing, we never saw one of them during the 6 plaintiff's case. not that we would expect them to 7 have those things around all these years, but you 8 can locate old newspaper articles. they located 9 some. but not one that mrs. ellis identified as 10 having been on the refrigerator. 11 we do not know when these articles were 12 published. ms. ellis did not remember what they 13 said. we do not know any details about those 14 articles. 15 and dr. jaffe said they were not a crutch but 16 a shield, because he used them to get people off 17 his back about smoking. 18 we know some things about the dangers and 19 addictiveness of tobacco. and we know that they 20 were no secret. people have been saying for 21 centuries that tobacco is harmful to your health. 22 it is been known for centuries that once you start 23 using tobacco, it can be difficult to give it up. 24 and people have been talking about tobacco 25 being addictive and causing cancer for over 150 3263 1 years. dr. burns told us these things. that was 2 dr. burns's testimony, one of the plaintiff's 3 experts in this case. 4 you can go back to the counterblaste of 5 tobacco back in the 1600s when king james, same 6 king james associated with the king james version, 7 is talking about the health hazards of smoking. 8 dr. cummings admitted that studies about 9 smoking and lung cancer received coverage in 10 newspapers, magazines, and scientific journals by 11 the early 1950s. 12 so a lot of these confidential memos that were 13 inside the companies about the scientific research, 14 that scientific research that dr. rodgman was 15 looking at, a lot of that scientific research was 16 the same research that got covered in newspapers, 17 magazines, and scientific journals. 18 and, in fact, dr. cummings at one point said 19 that sometimes the results of these research would 20 be in the popular press before it was released to 21 the scientific community because somebody would 22 leak it. so it was in the information environment. 23 it was not hidden from anybody. 24 in the 1950s, the public health authorities 25 began providing information about the dangers of 3264 1 smoking. about the dangers of smoking. that is 2 dr. cummings' testimony. and we know as early as 3 1915, the surgeon general of the united states was 4 saying that smoking is addictive. did not have to 5 wait until 1988. that was not the first time the 6 surgeon general had reached that conclusion. 7 the first time was back in 1915 when they 8 studied the garment workers in new york and they 9 wanted to find out why they had a higher incidence 10 of illness and disease, and they linked it to 11 smoking, and that was what the surgeon general 12 reported, smoking is addictive. and that is almost 13 a hundred years ago. 14 now, i want to go decade by decade and talk 15 about mr. ellis. 16 put it over here. let me move this out of the 17 way. 18 we know that he was born in 1936 in moultrie, 19 georgia. started school in the '40s, and meets 20 mrs. ellis in 1948. going to talk about the first 21 13 years of his life. we know that he had public 22 warnings about cancer and addiction, that was in 23 the public realm of knowledge. 24 we talked about the reader's digest articles, 25 we talked about time magazine articles, some of 3265 1 those newspaper articles. there was warnings in 2 popular culture. one of the things was this song 3 that came out in 1947 by tex williams. and we know 4 that his parents forbid their children to smoke, so 5 we know that was going on in the household. 6 so let us look at some of what was going on 7 prior to the '50s, media warnings about the dangers 8 of smoking. 9 reader's digest was the most popular magazine 10 in the united states of america in the '40s, '50s, 11 and '60s, and reader's digest was very 12 anti-tobacco. they hated smoking. and they 13 refused to accept any advertising from the tobacco 14 companies, absolutely refused to. and they carried 15 articles warning the public about the dangers of 16 smoking. 17 the scientific research that would find its 18 way into the scientific journals, they took it and 19 put it in form that laypeople could understand and 20 put it in their magazine. and here are just a 21 sampling of some of the articles. 22 this is 1935, "on giving up smoking." 1940, 23 "i quit smoking, cooper's last stand." 1924, 24 november, "does tobacco injure the human body?" 25 and here is an excerpt from that issue of reader's 3266 1 digest. "tobacco is injurious to the human body. 2 its use sometimes induces cancer." "sometimes 3 induces cancer." and then here is time magazine, 4 march 7, 1938 "coffin nails", another name for 5 cigarettes. 6 and even though mrs. ellis did not remember 7 receiving the reader's digest, information in the 8 reader's digest would be in the realm of discussion 9 that people would have because people talked to 10 each other about things. 11 it certainly was not a secret if it is in the 12 reader's digest. 13 here is an article in a magazine called 14 reader's scope, 1946, "cigarettes cause cancer?" 15 "some years ago roffo and the chemist luchetta 16 isolated a substance called benzopyrene. 17 benzopyrene, they report, is present in and can be 18 isolated from tobacco tar, which is produced by the 19 heat in the burning end of a cigarette, cigar or 20 pipe, and benzopyrene has the lethal power to start 21 cancer. it is a cancer-producing substance, a 22 carcinogen." 23 this is in 1946. so it is no secret that 24 cigarettes and other forms of tobacco including 25 pipes and cigars contain carcinogens, 3267 1 cancer-causing chemicals, and that is in the late -- 2 that is in 1946 in reader's scope. no secret. 3 there is no question that the information was 4 pervasive throughout the country, information about 5 the dangers and addictive nature of smoking and it 6 made its way into the popular culture. 7 when something gets into the popular culture, 8 it is widespread, especially when something becomes 9 a number one song in the whole united states of 10 america, top of the charts, and stayed there for a 11 long time. mr. ellis used to sing this song. 12 (video clip played as follows:) 13 singer: now, i'm a feller with a heart of 14 gold, 15 the ways of a gentleman i've been told, 16 the kind of feller that would not even harm a 17 flea. 18 but if me and a certain character met, 19 the guy that invented the cigarette, 20 i'd murder that son of a gun in the first 21 degree. 22 now, it ain't cause that i do not smoke myself. 23 i do not reckon they hinder your health. 24 i've smoked them all my life and i ain't dead 25 yet. 3268 1 but nicotine slaves are all the same, 2 at a pettin' party or a poker game, 3 everything's got to stop while they have that 4 cigarette. 5 smoke, smoke, smoke, that cigarette. 6 puff, puff, puff and if you smoke yourself to 7 death. 8 tell saint peter at the golden gate that you 9 hates to make him wait, 10 but you have just gotta have another cigarette. 11 (video clip stopped.) 12 mr. persons: thank you. 13 got the '50s? 14 thank you, sir. all right. let us look at the 15 1950s. and we will look at what is going on with 16 mr. ellis and what is going on in the united states. 17 wynder graham studies 1953, that is where they 18 painted the backs of the mice, they shaved the 19 backs of the mice and painted the tar from smoke 20 condensate on them and developed tumors. that was 21 covered in life magazine. 22 the first tobacco lawsuit was in 1954, so 23 people had enough information about the hazards of 24 smoking to start bringing suits. [#deleted onjection dialogue#] 2 mr. persons: that is right. technology. 3 so anyway, lawsuits and dr. cummings testified 4 about special projects that were conducted to 5 defend lawsuits. and at least special projects 6 that were funded by the tobacco industry research 7 committee. 8 mr. ellis graduates from high school in 1954, 9 starts smoking after the age of 18, after he turned 10 18, he gets married in 1956. so what is going on in 11 the united states with respect to smoking and 12 health at that time? we know that between 1954, 13 after the mouse skin painting studies came out in 14 '53, people started to quit smoking. and they 15 started quitting by the millions. 16 between 1954 and 1964, 17 million americans 17 quit smoking. we know that there were public 18 warnings about cancer and addiction during this 19 era. i'm going to talk about some of it. we know 20 there were warnings in the popular culture, in 21 music, and in literature, about the dangers of 22 smoking. 23 yet during this time, we know that mr. ellis 24 made no effort to quit smoking, at a time when 25 millions of people were giving it up, beginning in 3274 1 1954, he was taking it up. we know this. that is 2 the 1950s era. 3 we know in the 1950s, reader's digest 4 continued its mantra against smoking and warning 5 the public about the dangers of smoking. january 6 1950 reader's digest, "how harmful are cigarettes?" 7 december 1952, "the growing horror of lung cancer." 8 in fact, the article is entitled "cancer by the 9 carton." 10 nothing could be more graphic, nothing could 11 be more explicit about the dangers, the deadly 12 nature of cigarette smoking than cancer by the 13 carton. in other words, you buy a carton of 14 cigarettes, you are buying a carton of cancer risk. 15 that is what it says, "cancer by the carton." it is 16 no secret. 17 "the growing horror of lung cancer," reader's 18 digest march 1959. time magazine, december 22nd, 19 1952, "smoking and cancer." time magazine 1965, 20 "smoking and cancer." remind you, this is at a 21 time when there were -- you did not have any 22 internet. people tended to read a lot of print 23 media. that is how you got your news. there were 24 only three networks, abc, nbc, and cbc. people 25 read papers. most major cities had a morning paper 3275 1 and an evening paper. 2 and people read magazines, because most folks 3 did not have a color television, and the only way 4 you would see something in color would be to look 5 in a magazine to see it. and that is how you kept 6 abreast of events. 7 and by the time it reaches the magazines and 8 newspapers, it is widely disseminated. it is 9 certainly no secret. 10 we talked about this, i will not belabor it, but 11 this big magazine with these graphic images of 12 these mice with tumors on their backs after being 13 painted with the tar from cigarette smoke. 14 mr. ellis and mrs. ellis are living in 15 moultrie in the 1950s. and so we went to the 16 moultrie observer to see what kinds of information 17 was given to the citizens of colquitt county, 18 georgia, in the 1950s, and this is what we find. 19 these are headlines, it is not something buried 20 somewhere in the paper from some unidentified 21 source about taking a contrary position to what is 22 in the headline. this is a headline. 23 and there was a thing at a time in this 24 country called newspaper boxes. i think they have 25 become obsolete now. but there was a newspaper 3276 1 machine. and you would put a coin in it and you 2 would get a newspaper out of it. 3 and the newspapers would be folded, and you 4 would see the headline, and hence the term above 5 the fold, because you could walk by it and you would 6 see the headline and make a decision about whether 7 you wanted to buy the page or not. these are 8 headlines. "cigarette smokers die sooner, the 9 american cancer society says." 10 "do cigarettes add to the cancer danger?" 11 that is another article, december 1955, in the 12 moultrie observer. atlanta paper, "bears report on 13 cigarettes." they picked up something from the 14 atlanta constitution in atlanta and they 15 republished it in the moultrie paper about the link 16 between cigarettes and cancer. 17 "cancer group cites" -- i mean -- "cancer 18 group cites cigarette hazards", that is 1954 {sic} 19 in moultrie. 20 here is dr. cummings, plaintiff's expert, "by 21 1954, virtually everyone knew that smoking could 22 cause disease, did not they, sir?" 23 answer: "knew and heard i think are the same. 24 they knew it by 1954." 25 that is his testimony. it is no secret. the 3277 1 public health leaders, the surgeon general at the 2 time was leroy burney, testified before congress, 3 and so did john heller, the director of the 4 national cancer institute. dr. leroy burney said, 5 "our position is that we have informed the public 6 through the excellent coverage of the press, radio, 7 and tv." 8 dr. john heller said, "newspapers, radio, tv, 9 and other media have done an excellent job covering 10 this problem, and a very objective job. this is an 11 exceedingly valuable way of informing the public." 12 these were people who were there in real time, 13 not looking back, not with the benefit of 20/20 14 hindsight or doing a retrospective of people who 15 were there on the ground. people whose job it was, 16 the responsibility it was to protect the public 17 health and get out this message and this is what 18 they are saying at that time in 1957 in testimony 19 before congress. 20 reverend billy graham had a column in the 21 moultrie observer called my answer. and here's 22 what he said in 1959 in october in the moultrie 23 paper. 24 "the medical profession has done an excellent 25 job in alerting the american public to the dangers 3278 1 of smoking. a multitude of magazine articles and 2 medical reports have established the relationship 3 of the habit with the occurrence of lung cancer." 4 he made in abundantly clear that the american 5 public had been duly alerted to the dangers of 6 smoking. 7 thank you, sir. 8 that brings us to the 1960s. 1960, the 9 ellises are still living in moultrie. their first 10 child is born in 1960 and that would be tammy. 11 their daughter pamela is born in 1963. we know 12 that in 1964, the surgeon general's report on 13 smoking caused -- the link between smoking and lung 14 cancer in men came out, and that was widely 15 covered. 16 that was the most widely covered health news 17 in the history of the country. it was huge, huge 18 news? it made the front page of all the major 19 newspapers. it was covered on all three of the 20 television networks. it was on the radio. it was 21 widely covered in the press, in the media. 22 we know that by 1964, 17 million americans had 23 quit smoking. the first warning label went on a 24 pack of cigarettes in 1966. president johnson 25 signed the legislation in the summer of 1965. 3279 1 their daughter kimberly was born in 1966. 2 and beginning in the late '60s, his daughters 3 pamela and tammy started to get on mr. ellis about 4 his smoking. 5 between 1966, after the warning label went on, 6 to 1970, 13 million smokers quit. that is the most, 7 that is the highest number of quitters in a 8 four-year period in the history of our country. it 9 had not happened before nor since, that many people 10 quit. 11 now, when dr. cummings was on the stand and 12 dr. burns, they want to say it was a caution label 13 as opposed to a warning label. but it had the 14 effect of warning people about the dangers of 15 smoking, because so many of them quit. so if there 16 was a mixed message, it was not very effective, 17 because people were quitting in huge, huge numbers. 18 during the '60s, the public warnings about 19 smoking and cancer continued. there were continued 20 warnings in the popular press. yet during this 21 era, there was no effort to quit smoking by 22 mr. ellis. 23 and significant development in 1962, even 24 though he is living in moultrie, he goes to work for 25 the florida publishing company. and so access to 3280 1 news, delivering the news. 2 he started working at florida publishing 3 company in 1962. we know that he was an avid 4 reader of newspapers and magazines. he watched the 5 nightly news on television. we talked about the 6 surgeon general's report, which concluded that 7 "cigarette smoking is causally related to lung 8 cancer in men." 9 that was the conclusion. that is 1964. 1964, 10 mr. ellis was 28 years old. he is fully grown. 11 father of two daughters. and here is what the -- 12 harry reasoner had to say about the surgeon 13 general's report. 14 (video clip played as follows:) 15 mr. reasoner: in this kind of a country, it 16 comes down to you, whether you like it or not. no 17 one is going to forbid an adult to smoke, and it is 18 now quite clear that no one is going to tell him 19 it is good for him, either. the decision is his, 20 the decision and the health that may depend on it. 21 this is harry reasoner, good night. 22 (video clip stopped.) 23 mr. persons: here is the coverage in the 24 moultrie observer. "government panel sees 25 smoking-disease danger." and in that article, 3281 1 "smoking cigarettes is a health hazard that calls 2 for corrective action and is a major cause of lung 3 cancer and other death-dealing disease." 4 it is no secret. 5 and here is the 1966 warning: "cigarette 6 smoking may be hazardous to your health." and 7 mrs. ellis testified that she was sure mr. ellis 8 saw this warning and was not surprised by it. 9 she is in the best position to know that it did not 10 come as any surprise to him. 11 show the public service announcement. 12 (video clip played as follows:) 13 speaker: we receive many warnings in our 14 life, and sometimes they can save our life. 15 this message is brought to you by the american 16 cancer society. 17 (video clip stopped.) 18 mr. persons: these public service 19 announcements were rampant during this era 20 informing the public about the dangers of smoking 21 and particularly the link between cigarette smoking 22 and cancer. 23 some more warnings from the local media. 24 moultrie observer, where he lived. the florida 25 times-union paper that he worked for. 3282 1 "smoking-related diseases killing at a higher rate, 2 public health service reports." 3 "government panel sees smoking-disease 4 danger," that is in 1964. 5 "cancer toll rise blamed on smoking." that is 6 the florida times-union 1969. 7 "cigarette smoking held grave hazard to health 8 in the united states. one pack a day doubles your 9 chances of death, expert says." 10 "'64 report on hazards of smoking backed up." 11 then you have got dr. daniel horn who said that 12 "you could stand on a rooftop and shout 'smoking is 13 dangerous' at the top of your lungs and you would 14 not be telling anyone anything they did not already 15 know." 16 and this is something he said in november of 17 1968. "you would not be telling anyone anything 18 they did not already know." so the word was out 19 there. and these public service announcements were 20 very personal. some of them were extremely 21 personal, accounts from people who had developed 22 smoking-related disease, who were dying, warning 23 others to give up smoking. 24 (video clip played as follows:) 25 mr. talman: this is the house we live in. 3283 1 this is billy. he is pretty handy to have around. 2 steve, home from college. barbie, looking after 3 her brother timmy. debbie, who will soon graduate 4 from high school. susan, our youngest. and my 5 wife, peggy, who looks after all of us. and that is 6 me, bill talman, with a friend of mine you might 7 recognize. 8 you know, i did not really mind losing those 9 courtroom battles, but i'm in a battle right now i 10 do not want to lose at all, because if i lose it, it 11 means losing my wife and those kids you just met. 12 i've got lung cancer. 13 so take some advice about smoking and losing 14 from someone who has been doing both for years. if 15 you do not smoke, do not start. if you do smoke, 16 quit. do not be a loser. 17 (video clip stopped.) 18 mr. persons: pretty powerful message from 19 bill talman, and that was a very, very popular 20 television show, perry mason, back in that era. 21 we will turn now to the '70s. 22 thank you, mr. smith. 23 all right, we know in 1970, the second warning 24 label goes on. also in 1970, 38 percent of us male 25 smokers have kicked the habit. 1971, television 3284 1 advertising for tobacco ads banned on tv and on 2 radio. 1971, that is when the ellises first moved 3 to florida. 4 1972, there were warnings put in the billboard 5 advertisements and the magazine advertisements, 6 newspaper ads for cigarettes. in the mid '70s, 7 mrs. ellis quit smoking for one year. 8 in 1977, we know they had the great american 9 smokeout which was a nationwide effort, campaign to 10 get people to quit smoking for a day in hopes that 11 they would continue refraining from smoking and 12 kick the habit. 13 in 1978, the ellises had moved to tallahassee. 14 and in 1978, '79, mr. ellis catches his daughter 15 pamela smoking and sets her straight. 16 now, between 1965 and 1979, 30 million people 17 quit smoking. the surgeon general's report comes 18 out in '64, beginning of '75, to '79, 30 million 19 quit. public warnings about cancer and addiction 20 continue. mr. ellis gets warnings from his family 21 about smoking. and there is a question about just 22 how motivated he was to quit. 23 and so now we will look at some of the 24 information that was coming out there in the '70s. 25 this warning, "the surgeon general has 3285 1 determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to 2 your health" came out in -- this was in the '70s. 3 and we know that mr. ellis saw this warning because 4 his daughter tammy made sure that mr. ellis was 5 aware of this warning. 6 and here is a -- another public service 7 announcement, with a father and daughter, and the 8 daughter is warning the father about the dangers of 9 smoking. 10 (video clip played as follows:) 11 daughter: my father smoked so much he smelled 12 of it, i mean his face, his hair, his clothes. 13 everything had that yucky smell. and he was always 14 coughing. 15 father: sorry, but that is the way it was. 16 daughter: i worried about him, because in 17 school we learned about what cigarettes could do to 18 your lungs. 19 father: she sure let me and my lungs know. 20 daughter: so one day i wrote to the lung 21 association for help, and they sent me this free 22 information about how to quit smoking. 23 father: i did not think it would help, but i 24 promised to try. 25 daughter: it was not easy. 3286 1 father: the understatement of the year. 2 daughter: but he quit. 3 father: i really did. 4 daughter: and if he can. 5 father: you can. but remember, it was tough. 6 daughter: lung disease is tougher. so if you 7 know someone who smokes, write to your lung 8 association for help. whether it is smoking, air 9 pollution, or any lung problem, your lung 10 association cares about every breath you take. 11 father: take it from me, they really do. 12 (video clip stopped.) 13 mr. persons: again, just one of many public 14 service announcements that were shown on television 15 during that time. 16 and the media, print media continued to cover 17 this subject. and publicizing the research. here 18 is dr. ochsner stressing the perils of tobacco. 19 the florida times-union, "cancer, a disease of 20 terror and hope." 21 tallahassee democrat, "ten commandments to 22 prevent cancer. number one, do not smoke." surgeon 23 general warns "we are killing ourselves" with 24 smoking. tallahassee democrat, 1979. florida 25 times-union, 1970, "stop smoking clinic set by 3287 1 cancer unit." 2 they felt they would done a good job of informing 3 the public about the dangers of smoking. and so 4 the public health officials started moving toward 5 efforts to get people to quit, and so that became 6 the focus, how do we get people to quit smoking? 7 now we have told them, we broadcast the dangers of 8 smoking, now let us focus on how to get people to 9 quit and directing them to resources to stop 10 smoking. 11 "cancer unit sets clinic on smoking." that is 12 the florida times-union. "quit smoking clinic to 13 tell you how and why to quit." "no-smoking class 14 begins monday." that is the tallahassee democrat, 15 that is march of 1979. 16 mr. ellis is living in tallahassee at the 17 time. but there is no evidence that he attended 18 any of these no-smoking classes or other smoking 19 cessation sessions. forums here to show how to 20 quit smoking. 21 if you have any sincere desire to quit or you 22 are motivated to quit, you can go and avail 23 yourself of that. 24 here we have the florida times-union. we have 25 got the lung association launching a new 3288 1 antismoking campaign. and "jacksonville firms," 2 including the florida times-union, "cooperating 3 with the lung association and promoting the program 4 among their employees to get them to stop smoking." 5 so his employers urging him and his coworkers 6 to stop, employees of the florida times-union were 7 urged to quit smoking, they had an antismoking 8 campaign they were conducting. 9 now we look at the decade of the '80s. 10 all right, let us look at the 1980s. 1980 to 11 1993. 12 mr. ellis is continuing to work at the florida 13 publishing company. in 1985, rotating warnings go 14 on the packs of cigarettes. by 1985 also, 42 15 million smokers have quit smoking. we know that 16 the public warnings about cancer and addiction 17 continue. mr. ellis gets warnings from his family 18 members. there is still a question about 19 motivation to quit. in 1992, he is diagnosed with 20 cancer. so we will be discussing those items at this 21 time. 22 here are the rotating warnings. and they 23 would appear an equal number of times on each 24 cigarette product in the course of a year. 25 and so you have got "smoking causes lung cancer, 3289 1 heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate 2 pregnancy. smoking by pregnant women may result in 3 fetal injury, premature birth and low birth weight. 4 cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide. quitting 5 smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your 6 health." so the benefits of quitting are set out 7 on that warning, one of the four that appeared in 8 1985. 9 dr. burns testified that the anti-smoking 10 campaign that began with the release of the 1964 11 surgeon general's report has been a major success, 12 one of the most profound health accomplishments in 13 the last century. he said that by 1989, the public 14 health community had achieved more success with 15 tobacco addiction than with addictions to alcohol 16 and hard drugs. by 1985, almost half of all living 17 men who had ever smoked had quit. 18 and so in the words of dr. burns, the campaign 19 had been a major success. the anti-smoking 20 campaign he described as a major success. and we 21 can just look at the numbers. 22 by 1954, everyone knew that smoking causes 23 disease, according to -- and that is according to 24 dr. cummings, he testified to that effect. 1957, 25 the surgeon general, the public was informed 3290 1 through excellent coverage of press and radio and 2 tv about the dangers of smoking. 3 1964, when the surgeon general's report comes 4 out, and between '55 and '65, 17.6 million people 5 quit. by 1965, 31 percent of male smokers had 6 quit. warning label goes on in 1966. 7 and 1968, this is -- dr. heller says, "you 8 could stand on a rooftop and shout 'smoking is 9 dangerous'" -- daniel horn, i'm sorry, "you could 10 stand on a rooftop and shout 'smoking is dangerous' 11 at the top of your lungs and you would not be 12 telling anyone anything they did not already know." 13 warning label is changed in 1970 to say 14 "smoking is hazardous to your health." warnings in 15 all the advertising in 1972. and in 1975, more 16 americans knew smoking was dangerous than knew the 17 name of the president of the united states of 18 america. 19 so the psychological crutch did not stop 20 millions of people from quitting smoking. 21 dr. cummings was asked this question during 22 the course of this trial, said, "perhaps it was 23 unclear." i said: "notwithstanding that 24 psychological crutch," that he had been talking 25 about, "for a 15-year period, an average of 5,000 3291 1 to 6,000 people quit a day; right?" 2 and he admitted that, yes, that was true, that 3 notwithstanding the psychological crutch that he 4 had been testifying about, people continued to 5 quit, and they quit in huge numbers. 6 so warnings, very specific warnings, back to 7 mr. ellis in particular, we know that he got 8 warnings, word of mouth warnings. we know that he 9 was described as being someone with common sense. 10 we know he got warnings from family members. we. 11 know he was -- he read newspapers and 12 magazines and watched the tv news so he got 13 warnings from the mass media. we know he got 14 warnings from the popular culture. we know he got 15 warnings from the federal and state government and 16 regulatory agencies, the public health groups. we 17 know he got warnings from the american lung 18 association and cancer society, we know because we 19 have seen these public service announcements and 20 pieces in the newspapers. 21 your honor, do you want to take a break? 22 the court: yes. why do not we take a 23 20-minute break, and then defense can complete its 24 close and then we will have the last rebuttal close 25 of the plaintiff, and then we will go to the jury. 3292 1 why do not we make it a 15-minute break. 2 mr. persons: okay. 3 the court: we will be back about five till. 4 mr. persons: thank you. 5 the court: okay. 6 (the jury left the courtroom.) 7 (recess taken from 2:42 p.m. to 2:51 p.m.) 8 the bailiff: all rise, court is back in 9 session. 10 the court: everybody have a seat. 11 (off the record from 2:52 p.m. to 2:52 p.m.) 12 the court: we ready to go. 13 mr. persons: yes, your honor. 14 the court: if the jury's ready. let us see if 15 they are ready. if they are, deputy rudd, we will 16 bring them back in. 17 the bailiff: all right. 18 the court: mr. persons, you have almost 19 another 40 minutes or so to go. 20 mr. persons: i thought i had more time than 21 that. 22 the court: you started at 1:08. 23 the clerk: yeah. 24 mr. persons: okay. 25 mr. kreiner: we broke at 2:40, that is an hour 3293 1 and a half. 2 the court: i will not charge the 15 minutes 3 against you, but you started at 1:08. 4 mr. persons: okay. thanks for that, letting 5 me know. 6 the court: now, that is how much time you 7 have. now, you are not required to use it. 8 mr. persons: i probably will not use that much. 9 i would be surprised if i do. 10 the court: all right. because we are going 11 to go to the jury today. 12 mr. persons: okay. 13 the court: also, i'm going to -- once they do 14 go in there, i'm going to have the bailiff let them 15 know about ordering supper and we can get that 16 process started, too. 17 mr. persons: okay. 18 the court: so. 19 mr. persons: okay. 20 the court: by the time they want something to 21 eat, they should have something here. 22 mr. persons: excellent. then that will give 23 us time to look at the -- 24 the court: right. we will do that. 25 the clerk: do you have like a set time that 3294 1 you are going to let them go to or is it going to be 2 up to them? 3 the court: it is going to be up to them. 4 we are going to go tonight until they either get 5 finished or they tell me they are too tired to go 6 on. 7 the bailiff: all rise for the jury. 8 (the jury entered the courtroom.) 9 the court: all right, everybody have a seat. 10 i'll note the jury has returned, the lawyers are 11 here, ms. ellis is here. you may continue, sir. 12 mr. persons: thank you, your honor. 13 the court: okay. 14 mr. persons: all right. when we broke, we 15 were talking about mr. ellis's knowledge of the 16 dangers of smoking. and in mrs. ellis's words, she 17 said that he knew that smoking could lead to his 18 demise. mr. ellis's daughters continually told 19 mr. ellis that smoking was bad for his health and 20 encouraged him to quit smoking. 21 his sisters got on him about smoking and 22 encouraged him to quit. sally harrison told 23 mr. ellis that smoking causes cancer and that he 24 should not smoke. mr. ellis told martha jean 25 martin that smoking was a nasty habit meaning it 3295 1 was addictive and dangerous. barbara dixon told 2 mr. ellis that smoking might be harmful to him. 3 so lots of personal warnings from people close 4 to him, people who care about him, about the 5 dangers of smoking and the need to quit smoking. 6 mrs. ellis believed -- mr. ellis believed the 7 risks of smoking. mrs. ellis testified that 8 mr. ellis knew that smoking could lead to his 9 demise. martha jean martin testified mr. ellis 10 knew that smoking was hazardous to his health. 11 dr. mccoy testified that mr. ellis was already 12 aware of the risks of smoking before he sought 13 treatment with dr. mccoy. 14 now, let us talk about concealment. because 15 that is a question on the verdict form that you are 16 going to have to deal with. and it involves a 17 material fact. the omission or concealment of a 18 material fact. 19 and what is a material fact? a material fact 20 is one that is of such importance that mr. ellis 21 would not have acted as he did but for the 22 concealment or omission of that fact. in other 23 words, it could have -- it would have affected the 24 outcome, that he would have acted in a different 25 way had he been aware of a material fact. 3296 1 a material fact is one that would have changed 2 his behavior. that would be a material fact. 3 and so what does this mean in terms of the 4 concealment case that you have to decide? and 5 remember, i told you earlier about the requirement 6 that it is a but for, that for something to be a 7 legal cause, a substantial cause, a 8 substantially-contributing cause, it has to be a 9 but-for cause, that but for this particular thing, 10 then mr. ellis would not have died. 11 there is no evidence of any concealment, that 12 the concealment led mr. ellis to start smoking. 13 there is no evidence that anything, that any 14 concealment caused him to continue to smoke. there 15 is no evidence that mr. ellis was in the dark about 16 information related to the dangers and 17 addictiveness of smoking. 18 as he told his daughter tammy, "i've heard it 19 all before," when she would, in her words, nag him 20 about smoking and say "i've heard it all before." 21 that is the evidence in the case. 22 what the plaintiff was trying to convince you 23 is that somehow the tobacco company messages 24 confused mr. ellis and tricked him into smoking. 25 that somehow the internal information the tobacco 3297 1 companies had would have led mr. ellis to quit 2 smoking if only he had known about it. 3 and here is the most important admission on 4 the issue of concealment. mrs. ellis told us, she 5 told you that she did not think there was anything 6 that anyone could have told mr. ellis, said to him 7 to make him quit smoking before he became ill. 8 nothing anyone could have told him that would have 9 caused him to quit smoking before he became ill. 10 think about that for a moment. nothing the 11 tobacco industry research committee, nothing r.j. 12 reynolds ever said, nothing that brown & williamson 13 or liggett or lorillard said, nothing philip morris 14 could have said, nothing the council for tobacco 15 research could have said, nothing anyone could have 16 said to make mr. ellis quit smoking before he 17 became ill. 18 that was her testimony from that witness stand 19 in this trial after days of evidence had come in 20 about secret documents and things that were 21 allegedly concealed and withheld in the way of 22 scientific information in discovery about the link 23 between smoking and cancer, testimony about 24 ammoniated tobacco, testimony about levulinic acid, 25 testimony about nicotinic receptors and 3298 1 upregulation in the brain, nothing anyone could 2 have said to make mr. ellis quit smoking before he 3 became ill. 4 that is the testimony, and it is the testimony 5 from someone who knew him better than anyone who is 6 testified in this case. and i venture to say knew 7 him better than anybody in the world. nothing 8 anyone could have said could have caused him to 9 quit smoking. 10 there is absolutely no way the plaintiff can 11 meet the burden of proving that concealment of 12 information or an agreement to conceal information 13 somehow would have convinced mr. ellis to quit 14 smoking in time to avoid illness. 15 did i do something wrong? 16 mr. smith: no. 17 mr. persons: oh. thought i had messed up. 18 now, if your question -- your answer to 19 question number 1 is no, and i submit to you it 20 should be, then that would be the end of the 21 process and you should proceed no further except to 22 sign and date the verdict form and return it to the 23 courtroom. 24 if you answer yes, only then would you proceed 25 to the next question that appears on the form, 3299 1 question number 2. "was r.j. reynolds tobacco 2 company's concealment or omission of material 3 information about the health effects or addictive 4 nature of smoking cigarettes, or both, a legal 5 cause of clarence c. ellis's death?" and the 6 answer should be no. 7 number 3, "was r.j. reynolds tobacco company's 8 agreement with other cigarette manufacturers and 9 corporations to conceal or omit information 10 regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their 11 addictive nature a legal cause of clarence ellis's 12 death?" answer, no. 13 thank you, sir. 14 now, the next question on the verdict form 15 will be question number 4. "please state the 16 percentage of any fault that was a legal cause of 17 clarence c. ellis's death that you charge to r.j. 18 reynolds tobacco company, clarence c. ellis," and 19 it has to add up to a hundred percent. 20 let us talk about allocation of fault. and it 21 is only if you find for the plaintiff on this class 22 membership question against reynolds do you even 23 get down to answering these other questions, 24 including this one. i mentioned to you earlier and 25 i showed you on where mrs. ellis submitted that 3300 1 mr. ellis would bear fault for his illness and 2 death. 3 the evidence will show or has shown that it is 4 mr. ellis who was at fault in his death and not 5 r.j. reynolds. r.j. reynolds, assignment of fault 6 relates only to actions that were a legal cause of 7 his death. r.j. reynolds cannot be assigned fault 8 for actions that were not a legal cause of his 9 death. 10 so that the secret documents, the stupid 11 comments, denials by the tobacco executives, if 12 they were not a legal cause of his death, then fault 13 cannot be assigned r.j. reynolds for those things. 14 however inappropriate, no matter how offensive, no 15 matter how stupid those things were, there has to 16 be a causal nexus between those things and the 17 death of mr. ellis. 18 and you know the evidence. you know that 19 mr. ellis made the choice to start smoking because 20 mrs. ellis told us so. you know that he made the 21 choice to continue smoking because mrs. ellis told 22 us so. you know that mr. ellis made the decision 23 not to try to quit smoking because the evidence 24 tells us so. 25 you know that the choice to stop smoking is 3301 1 one hundred percent in the control of the smoker because 2 dr. burns, their expert, told us so. 3 mr. ellis's choices were the only cause of his 4 death. let us look at them. 5 plaintiff admits that mr. ellis's actions were 6 a cause of his death. mr. ellis chose to smoke 7 after his parents told the children not to smoke. 8 mr. ellis considered smoking to be his business. 9 and please do not overlook that. that is very 10 significant. that is very, very significant. and 11 i'm going to urge you to do the right thing, too, 12 but i know that you will. 13 it is very telling. "it is my business. you 14 tend to your business and i'll tend to mine." in 15 other words, you leave me alone. 16 mr. ellis responded to warnings with 17 indifference, whether it was a shrug of the 18 shoulders when sally opal harrison, his sister, his 19 big sister, one of the people who raised him after 20 he lost his mother, told him that if he kept 21 smoking, he could get cancer. they are living in 22 moultrie at the time. he shrugged his shoulders. 23 mr. ellis chose to smoke despite the package 24 warnings. we know that mr. ellis was aware of the 25 warnings, we have got direct evidence of it. 3302 1 mr. ellis chose to continue smoking when millions 2 and millions of other smokers were quitting. he 3 chose to ignore the constant warnings from the 4 media and the public health community. 5 there is nothing anyone could have said that 6 would have made mr. ellis quit. 7 tammy and kimberly, his daughters, 8 continuously begged mr. ellis to quit, and then he 9 chose to keep smoking. 10 mr. ellis was at fault for choosing to start 11 and continuing to smoke. 12 the decision to try to quit was a hundred 13 percent in his control. plaintiff admits that he 14 had the ability to quit sooner. that is part of 15 their partial admission of fault, that he had the 16 ability to quit sooner. 17 mr. ellis chose to continue smoking after 18 mrs. ellis quit smoking. mr. ellis refused to seek 19 help to quit. mr. ellis said "i'm not ready to 20 quit." plaintiff admits that he could have 21 prevented his own death and he could have done it 22 by quitting sooner. 23 dr. burns testified that had mr. ellis quit 24 smoking as late as 1978, his chances of dying of 25 lung cancer would have been those of someone who 3303 1 had never smoked. he could have essentially 2 avoided the disease. now, that is assuming that he 3 did have a primary lung cancer. that is assuming he 4 had a primary lung cancer. so even if you assume 5 he had a primary lung cancer, he could have avoided 6 that eventuality, he could have avoided his demise 7 had he quit smoking as late as 1978. 8 mrs. ellis quit in 1977 using information from 9 the american heart association, a pamphlet. no 10 chantix, it did not exist at the time. no gum. no 11 patch. but delaying each day that first cigarette 12 to the point that she quit, and she stayed quit for 13 a whole year. 14 so that is how the fault stacks up. 15 and here is dr. burns' testimony. "the bottom 16 line, sir, would you agree that if mr. ellis would 17 have quit smoking as late as 1978, 15 years before 18 his death, in your opinion, it is more medically 19 likely than not he would have avoided his lung 20 cancer; is that true?" 21 answer: "that is correct. looking backwards 22 from his having the lung cancer, yes." 23 we know some things about mr. ellis's 24 relationship with his smoking, mrs. ellis shared 25 with us. "after he became sick, mr. ellis never 3304 1 said that he was sorry that he smoked, did he? 2 "no. 3 "he never said that if he would known what was 4 going to happen, he would not have smoked? 5 "no. 6 "and he never expressed any regret for having 7 smoked? 8 "no, he did not verbalize it." 9 that is consistent with the things we have heard 10 about the kind of person mr. ellis was, because 11 smoking was his business. 12 his choices are the only legal cause of his 13 death. there is nothing r.j. reynolds could have 14 done that would have prevented mr. ellis from 15 dying. only mr. ellis had the ability to prevent 16 his death, and he is one hundred percent responsible for 17 the choices that he made. 18 and when you get to question number 4, "please 19 state the percentage of any fault that was a legal 20 cause of clarence c. ellis's death," that you 21 charge a hundred percent to clarence ellis. 22 the next question has to do with damages. and 23 i suggest you will not get there, but if you do, i 24 have to talk about it, because if i do not, that 25 will be one of the first things somebody says is, 3305 1 well, he did not even talk about damages. 2 just because i talk about damages does not mean 3 that they ought to be awarded. but if you do award 4 damages, they have to be just and reasonable in 5 light of the evidence. that is what the judge will 6 charge you. 7 let us see what the plaintiff -- any damages 8 must be fair and just in light of the evidence. 9 plaintiff's claim for $10 million defies 10 common sense. they are not asking for damages 11 related to medical expenses or funeral expenses, 12 economic damages for mrs. ellis, lost services for 13 mrs. ellis, copd, or mrs. ellis's pain and 14 suffering. they are asking damages for loss of 15 support and pain and suffering to mrs. ellis. 16 mrs. ellis. not mr. ellis's pain and suffering. 17 i submit to you plaintiff is attempting to 18 inflate her damage award by asking you for a huge 19 amount of money that has no basis in the evidence. 20 so to be fair and do the right thing and to do the 21 right thing to them means $10 million. 22 no one should be awarded millions of dollars 23 because their spouse chose to smoke cigarettes for 24 decades knowing they were dangerous. just ask that 25 you use common sense. 3306 1 i apologize, there was something i thought i 2 had and yet i did not have it. 3 when we examined dr. cummings, he talked about 4 a pamphlet that he had prepared for the american 5 cancer society that he used in instructing people 6 on how to quit smoking, and telling them that they 7 could quit smoking. he said that, "any smoker can 8 quit if they are willing to put up with some uneasy 9 moments after stopping." 10 is it worth putting up with some uneasy 11 moments to save your life? and should someone 12 receive millions of dollars because someone, a 13 loved one was unwilling to put up with some uneasy 14 moments? uneasy moments that could have saved 15 their life and avoided their demise. 16 question number 5, "what is the amount, total 17 amount, one hundred percent, of any damages sustained by 18 plaintiff betty jean ellis for the loss of clarence 19 c. ellis's companionship and protection and for her 20 pain and suffering as a result of clarence ellis's 21 injury and death?" 22 i'm not going to put a number in there. if 23 you get to that part of the verdict form, you will 24 use your own judgment about what is fair and just in 25 light of the evidence. and in light of the 3307 1 testimony of dr. cummings about someone's 2 willingness to put up with a few uneasy moment 3 after they stopped smoking. 4 mr. sales: excuse me, your honor, objection, 5 there is no damage to be awarded for the decedent. 6 the court: true, but i'm not sure i heard 7 that, but overruled. overruled. hold on, let me 8 look at the -- 9 overruled. 10 mr. persons: all right. let us talk about 11 punitive damages. the sixth question on the 12 verdict form, "under the circumstances of this 13 case, state whether you find by clear and 14 convincing evidence that punitive damages are 15 warranted against r.j. reynolds tobacco company." 16 punitive damages can only be awarded -- can be 17 awarded only for any concealment or agreement to 18 conceal that was a legal cause of mr. ellis's 19 death. punitive damages can be awarded only to 20 mrs. ellis. and punitive damages are in addition 21 to damages that fully compensate mrs. ellis. 22 let us talk about clear and convincing 23 evidence. "clear and convincing evidence differs 24 from the greater weight of the evidence in that it 25 is more compelling and persuasive." 3308 1 the judge will instruct you. "greater weight 2 of the evidence means the more persuasive and 3 convincing force and effect of the entire evidence 4 in the case. in contrast, clear and convincing 5 evidence is evidence that is precise, explicit, 6 lacking in confusion, and of such weight that it 7 produces a firm belief or conviction without 8 hesitation about the matter in issue." 9 "evidence that is precise, explicit, lacking 10 in confusion, and of such weight that it produces a 11 firm belief or conviction without hesitation about 12 the matter in issue." 13 so if there is any hesitation whatsoever about 14 whether punitive damages should be awarded, i 15 submit to you there is not clear and convincing 16 evidence. clear and convincing evidence, that is a 17 heavier burden than the greater weight of the 18 evidence. 19 well, i submit to you r.j. reynolds should not 20 be punished. 21 the council for tobacco research funded more 22 than $500 million worth of research. they funded 23 6,000 published articles, many of them in 24 prestigious journals. we talked about that with 25 dr. cummings. the new england journal of medicine 3309 1 was one of them. the journal of the american 2 medical association was another. 3 more than 600 of these articles were cited in 4 the surgeon general's reports. they funded nobel 5 prize winners, scientists of that caliber. they 6 funded research in universities across the country. 7 dr. cummings shared this with you. "and when 8 those scientists received grants from the council 9 for tobacco research and they conducted their 10 research, they were given complete independence as 11 to whether or not they published articles, were not 12 they? 13 "yes." 14 they had complete independence from the source 15 of the funding, the tobacco companies. 16 here is one such article. some of that money 17 went to fund articles like this one. when it said 18 nicotine -- this is 1963, american journal of 19 psychiatry. "nicotine is an active agent; it 20 appears to have certain addictive qualities. heavy 21 cigarette smokers thus appear to be true addicts." 22 "our subjects also showed a compulsion to 23 continue to smoke in increasing amounts." and then 24 they gave credit to the ctr. "supported in part by 25 grants from the council for tobacco research." 3310 1 that is in 1963, that is 25 years before the 1988 2 surgeon general's report that was dedicated to or 3 focused on the addictive nature of nicotine. 4 reynolds developed a less mutagenic cigarette. 5 mutagenic meaning cancer causing. 6 question, i put this to dr. cummings, "you 7 told the jury that it would be a good thing to 8 develop cigarettes that were less mutagenic?" 9 answer: "yes." 10 "you said such a product could cause less 11 cancer; correct? 12 "yes." 13 reynolds developed such a cigarette. it 14 developed premier and eclipse. they used a 15 heating, not burn, technology. because when you 16 burn tobacco or any organic material, you generate 17 these compounds, many of which are cancer causing. 18 they spent over a billion dollars developing 19 this product. and premier was released in the late 20 1980s. eclipse was a second generation of that 21 product, but failed commercially because people 22 refused to buy it. 23 they did not like the way it tasted. they 24 did not like the way it smelled. they refused to 25 buy it. you cannot force people to buy something. 3311 1 you put it on the market, you cannot make them buy 2 it. it is still a free country. 3 you heard during dr. burns' testimony, and he 4 showed you the reynolds website. reynolds tells 5 consumers, it says, "rely on the surgeon general, 6 the centers for disease control, and other public, 7 health, and medical officials when making decisions 8 regarding smoking." that is what they are told to 9 do. 10 punitive damages are not warranted in this 11 case. cigarettes have carried warning labels since 12 1966 about being hazardous to your health. 13 reynolds has reported the ingredients in cigarettes 14 since 1985 and has displayed the ingredients on its 15 website for years. 16 reynolds has not disputed the dangers or 17 addictiveness of tobacco for more than a decade. 18 and punitive damages are not necessary to prevent 19 reynolds from concealing the dangers of tobacco. 20 that is well known. 21 and this business about, well, we looked to 22 reynolds for information about the health effects 23 of tobacco. i do not think anybody enjoys a nice, 24 cold beer more than i do. 25 mr. sales: objection, your honor. counsel's 3312 1 enjoyment is irrelevant, it is argumentative. 2 the court: okay. 3 mr. persons: it is argument. 4 the court: he can talk about cold beer but 5 not that he enjoys it. 6 mr. persons: okay, i will not say that i enjoy 7 it. 8 mr. sales: although i believe you. 9 mr. persons: but you do not look -- you do not 10 look to anheuser-busch to give you advice about the 11 dangers of alcohol consumption, no more than you 12 would look to johnny walker or jack daniels for 13 such advice. 14 i do not know whether they still run the 15 commercial, but the beef association used to run a 16 commercial called "what is for dinner?" but i 17 did not see anything in those commercials about red 18 meat and how bad it is for you and all of that. i 19 mean, you run a business and advertising a product, 20 you are trying to encourage people to buy it, that is 21 the whole idea, not to discourage them from buying 22 it. 23 and common sense tells us and life experience 24 tells us that we do not go to the egg counsel, egg 25 producers for health information about the 3313 1 cholesterol content of eggs or go to the beef 2 counsel for information about the cholesterol 3 content of beef. 4 and we do things that we are told may be bad 5 for us. it is like harry reasoner said, "in a 6 country such as this, nobody is going to prevent an 7 adult to smoke," because people choose to do 8 certain activities, there is nothing wrong with 9 that, but oftentimes there are consequences 10 associated with those activities that can be 11 adverse to one's health. 12 sometimes it is a hard choice between having 13 that key lime pie for desert or not having that 14 hamburger or driving by popeyes and not stopping 15 for some popeyes chicken, knowing that it is not the 16 healthiest choice. but no one is to be faulted for 17 it in a free country. 18 and so i want to leave you with this. so 19 1955. and this is dr. cuyler hammond, one of the 20 leading research -- medical researchers in the 21 country. he is talking about the dangers of 22 smoking. 23 (video clip played as follows:) 24 dr. hammond: it is now established, in my 25 opinion, beyond a reasonable doubt that cigarette 3314 1 smoking greatly increases the probability of 2 developing lung cancer. in my opinion, people 3 should be warned of the dangers, and they are being 4 warned. what they then want to do, whether they 5 wish to smoke or not, is their own business. 6 (video clip stopped.) 7 mr. persons: so i submit to you a verdict for 8 the plaintiff in this case will say that it is okay 9 to knowingly engage in a risky behavior and then to 10 blame others for your demise. i submit to you that 11 the only just verdict in this case would be one in 12 favor of the r.j. reynolds tobacco company. 13 i thank you for your kind attention.
