13 mr. gustafson: good morning. 14 jurors: good morning. 15 mr. gustafson: been a long two weeks. 16 juror erato: yes. 17 mr. gustafson: y'all have learned a lot. 18 juror holden: oh, yeah. 19 mr. gustafson: clarence sonny ellis. the 20 evidence says he started smoking between 1948, when 21 he was 12 years old, and 1953, 1954, when he was 22 16, 17 years old, a senior in high school. he was 23 smoking daily by the age of 18. 24 by the age of 19, when he was married to betty 25 ellis, he was showing clear signs of addiction, 3151 1 smoking when his feet hit the floor on the way to 2 the bathroom first thing in the morning. 3 the tobacco company documents tell you they 4 intended to sell their addictive product to kids. 5 they knew that if you got a teenager addicted to 6 nicotine, they were going to get a lifetime of 7 profits. 8 that is exactly what they intended. that is 9 exactly what they accomplished to an entire 10 generation of americans. he was a teenager like 11 all those others, and they enjoyed decades of 12 profits off his lungs. 13 and as we all know from growing up, peer 14 pressure is real. peer pressure gets to young 15 people. the defendant knew that and the other 16 companies knew that, and they exploited it in their 17 search for replacement smokers. 18 you add a little marketing, you add a little 19 nicotine, just the right amount, and lo and behold, 20 seventy percent of the people in sonny ellis's age group 21 were smokers. 22 now, it would have been unusual if sonny ellis 23 was not a smoker. he would have been in the 24 minority. that is how accepted and normal this was. 25 the decision to start smoking in 1948 or 1949 or 3152 1 1954 or whatever it was for sonny ellis, that 2 decision is nothing like a decision to start 3 smoking today. 4 what we know today, what you know now is more 5 than you knew when you walked in here two weeks 6 ago. they want to tell you that sonny ellis knew 7 all of that back in the '70s and '80s and '90s. 8 it would have been really unusual if sonny 9 ellis were just able to put cigarettes down and 10 walk away like the defendant says he should. and 11 you know why that would have been really unusual. 12 they engineered cigarettes to be addictive, 13 through technology, through additives, through 14 monkeying with what they put in their product, they 15 engineered cigarettes to be hard to give up. they 16 knew exactly what they were doing long before the 17 public health authorities who testified here knew. 18 long before the experts knew. long before the 19 tobacco control people who studied this and lived 20 this in their professional lives. 21 long before they knew, the tobacco companies 22 knew because they were doing it on purpose. but 23 they say sonny ellis should have known all along. 24 they spent the next few decades perfecting 25 ways to make cigarettes as addictive as they could. 3153 1 they take the nicotine out when they process the 2 tobacco. they put just the right amount of 3 nicotine back in so they can maintain addiction, 4 because the documents you have in evidence show you 5 that if they did not put enough nicotine back in to 6 maintain addiction in their customers, their 7 customers would stop smoking, because nicotine is 8 why people smoke. they ain't smoking for the 9 turkish blend, they are smoking for the nicotine. 10 they changed the ph level of the smoke to make 11 the smoke more inhalable because the more inhalable 12 it was, the more addictive it became. they added 13 ammonia compounds so that their customers would 14 freebase nicotine to the brain. 15 they added levulinic acid to increase nicotine 16 binding in their customers' brains. they tried 17 their best to make quitting as hard as they could. 18 and they were successful because only 3 percent of 19 people who try to quit are successful long term. 20 they have to try over and over and over again for 21 years, and many of them are never successful. 22 despite that evidence, despite the unrebutted 23 evidence on these points, they say it was sonny 24 ellis's free, unfettered choice to continue 25 smoking. and there is strong evidence in this case 3154 1 of sonny ellis's addiction. excuse me. 2 there is no question, this is unrebutted, 3 uncontested evidence, that the defendant and the 4 other companies designed cigarettes to be 5 addictive. they intended people like sonny ellis 6 to get addicted when they used the product. that 7 was the point. 8 it was unrebutted, uncontested evidence that 9 they concealed what they did to make cigarettes 10 addictive. and that they lied for decades to keep 11 it going. and they want you to give them a pass. 12 there is no question that what they did 13 worked. their own documents that we have in 14 evidence here and showed you in this trial showed 15 they knew it worked. they knew it was working, 16 they congratulated themselves on how well it was 17 working. and it not only worked, it made them a 18 lot of money. they congratulate themselves on 19 that. 20 the only question now is what are y'all going 21 to do about it? 22 you are going to have to decide whether you are 23 going to tolerate lies and liars because that is 24 just business. you are going to have to decide 25 whether it is right or wrong to design something to 3155 1 be addictive and then lie about it; market it as 2 safe when you know it will kill people; and exploit 3 addicted people to keep doing what they are addicted 4 to by lying to them and telling them that it ain't 5 proven that what you are addicted to is even 6 harmful. all the while knowing that their business 7 plan is going to result in millions of people 8 dying, and they did not care. 9 did you see any evidence from r.j. reynolds in 10 this trial that they cared? things do not square up 11 till your verdict speaks that you are not going to 12 let the defendant profit from lies and deceit. 13 every r.j. reynolds executive who testified in 14 this trial, either on videotape or on the documents 15 they wrote, their statements show that what they 16 did was intentional. their statements show it was 17 all something they knew was false. and it was 18 something they knew was working. and it was all 19 done for money. 20 they knew what they were doing was wrong. 21 they knew that when they were doing it. and we 22 found out what they did, and now y'all know what 23 they did. you have just got to decide what you are 24 going to do about it. 25 so why do people smoke? well, you learned in 3156 1 this trial that the reason people smoke cigarettes 2 is for nicotine. even though they have known for 3 decades how to take the nicotine out, the defendant 4 keeps putting it back in there at just the right 5 amount to maintain addiction. 6 even though they have been able to grow tobacco 7 with no nicotine in it, they keep growing the kind 8 that has the nicotine in it. they not only choose 9 to keep the nicotine in their product, but they 10 engineer the cigarettes to maintain addiction and 11 make it as hard as they can for people to quit. 12 they were doing all they could to take choice 13 away, and then they tell you that smokers like 14 sonny ellis simply choose to keep smoking. they 15 want to have it both ways. 16 they add things to cigarettes to engineer 17 addiction, and then they tell you that sonny ellis 18 should have just quit. 19 and you know now why it is that people smoke 20 until they die from lung cancer. you know now why 21 it is they make adapters for tracheostomies for 22 people to put a cigarette in and smoke it through 23 their throat. they are not doing that because 24 cigarettes are so much fun to smoke. they are doing 25 that because they are addicted. and they lied about 3157 1 cigarettes being addictive and they lied about 2 cigarettes causing cancer. 3 now, all those lies were just designed to 4 speak to people like sonny ellis who were addicted 5 smokers, to give them a psychological crutch to 6 keep doing what it is they are addicted to. that 7 was the whole point of their conspiracy. that was 8 the whole point of all of them banding together to 9 lie about cigarettes not being proven to cause 10 cancer or copd or anything else, to create that 11 controversy. 12 and they lied about addiction, because it gave 13 them an excuse to blame smokers for their behavior, 14 all the while they are back there with chemists and 15 everybody else engineering these things to make 16 them as addictive and hard to quit as they can. 17 they do not get it both ways. 18 you have got to take yourself back in time, 19 though. they promised, they promised, in the 20 videos we showed you, if there is anything bad in 21 it, we are going to take it out. if there is 22 anything bad in it. and then promised your health 23 is of paramount concern to us. 24 trust us, we are going to work with the public 25 health authorities, we are going to set up these 3158 1 tobacco research institutes and we are going to hire 2 all these esteemed scientists, we are going to be 3 first to let you know if what we find out. 4 we are going to hire the most esteemed 5 scientists, people like clarence cook little, who 6 lied. we are going to set up this research 7 committee and fund it and it lied. we are going to 8 spend all this money to research all of this and 9 tell you what our findings are, and they withheld 10 the findings. 11 they withheld the findings from us, and they 12 withheld the findings from the public health 13 authorities. they promised to look out for 14 everybody and cooperate with the public health 15 authorities, and they did everything but. 16 hugh cullman said "we want to be the 17 detectives just as much as the surgeon general and 18 the ama, and we will cooperate in every way." ask 19 yourself, what evidence did they bring you? that 20 they were detectives just as much as the surgeon 21 general and the ama and that they cooperated in 22 every way. what evidence did r.j. reynolds bring 23 you in this trial that that is what they did? 24 they knew this message was a powerful one. 25 they said things like, you saw the document from 3159 1 the '60s, "if it causes lung cancer, we will stop 2 making cigarettes tomorrow." 3 they knew that message is a powerful one for 4 addicted smokers. they designed it that way. they 5 knew that if you are addicted and you try to quit 6 and you fail, that it can be so overpowering and 7 crushing the idea of failing so many times, you 8 latch onto a message that gives you a psychological 9 crutch to keep doing what you are doing. 10 their customers, though, the difference in 11 this kind of addiction and this kind of product is 12 that the customers can be addicted to nicotine in 13 cigarettes, but they can still be productive 14 members of society. can be a good parent, good 15 father, good mother, could be a good employee. 16 could be all the things that sonny ellis was, a 17 good breadwinner, devoted family member and friend, 18 do all the things that life requires and you can be 19 an addict, a nicotine addict. and sonny ellis was 20 that kind of person. 21 you heard all the words to describe him. he 22 was intelligent, he was honest, he was loyal, he 23 was determined, he was a hard worker, he was kind, 24 he was a quiet man, he meant what he said and said 25 what he meant and did not say any more. he could not 3160 1 have been a lawyer. he could not have talked for 2 two hours. 3 but he was trustworthy and he is someone -- 4 he is someone that you would want as a friend. 5 that is the kind of person that was described to 6 you. and he was addicted. 7 you heard all the things about how determined 8 he was and how he was somebody who could do all 9 these things. well, the one thing that he could not 10 beat, he could beat alcohol, got in that wreck, got 11 hit by that steamroller, cement truck, whatever it 12 was, in 1984, developed a drinking problem, goes to 13 a rehab center, he is able to quit drinking, but he 14 cannot quit smoking. what does that tell you about 15 the type of addiction that he had to nicotine? he 16 never touched alcohol again, but he smoked until he 17 died. 18 addiction to nicotine is why he smoked two 19 cartons of cigarettes a week for 34 years. it is 20 what caused the smoking. it caused the lung cancer 21 that metastasized and killed him. and what did 22 r.j. reynolds bring you to dispute that? 23 they brought you dr. jaffe. did dr. jaffe 24 explain to you that mr. ellis did not freebase 25 nicotine to his brain? did dr. jaffe explain to 3161 1 you that all that ammonium hydroxide and diammonium 2 phosphate and rat poison they were putting in lucky 3 strikes cigarettes, the interrogatory with the 4 recipe is in evidence, did he tell you that that 5 stuff somehow did not affect sonny ellis? 6 did he explain to you how it is even possible 7 to be exposed to a powerfully addictive drug, 8 hundreds of doses a day for decades, every day, did 9 he explain to you how it was possible you could do 10 that and not become addicted? 11 did he explain that sonny ellis was impervious 12 to this powerfully addictive drug? because, you 13 know, nicotine addiction, and by the surgeon 14 general and folks that write on this, they compare 15 the pathways of addiction to heroin and cocaine, 16 which are illicit drugs, illegal to buy, unlike 17 cigarettes, you get them at the winn dixie, 18 convenience store, wherever you go, you can get 19 cigarettes. 20 if sonny ellis had been dosing himself with 21 cocaine hundreds of times a day for 30 years, would 22 we even be having this conversation? would there 23 be any question that he was addicted? 24 and the reason why we look at it differently, 25 i submit, is because we all grew up with 3162 1 cigarettes. we have got pockets on our shirts to put 2 cigarettes in. we used to put ashtrays out in our 3 homes. if we did not even smoke, we put ashtrays 4 out for people to come over and smoke in our house. 5 even if we did not smoke, we owned the ashtrays. 6 we used to -- we made cigarette ashtrays for 7 our fathers when we were in seventh grade shop 8 class. we brought them home to our dads who were 9 trying to quit. 10 it was such an accepted part of american life, 11 unlike these other types of drugs, that the idea 12 that it was addictive was just foreign to everyone 13 except the defendant and the other companies. 14 sonny ellis grew up when everybody smoked. 15 heroes smoked, athletes smoked, actors smoked. at 16 his school, when he is in high school, the joint 17 board of education took a picture in his high 18 school yearbook, it is in evidence. what is on the 19 table in front of these gentlemen, the role models 20 in sonny ellis's life as a teen, were smoking 21 cigarettes. 22 all the role models smoked. it was how boys 23 wanted to look like men and it was how girls wanted 24 to look like women and be glamorous. it seems 25 silly now knowing what we know today in 2014, 3163 1 knowing what we know about cigarettes now, it is a 2 completely different mindset than what it was like 3 back then. 4 imagine, imagine if leon high school's 5 yearbook or godby or whoever had their deans and 6 principals in the yearbook with ashtrays on the 7 table in front of them. there would be a public 8 outcry. it is a very different time. 9 so as the plaintiff in this case, we have got to 10 prove certain things. y'all have heard me talk 11 about this in jury selection, and the judge just 12 read you the instructions. we have got to prove 13 sonny ellis was a member of the engle class. 14 and we have got to prove that by the greater 15 weight of the evidence. not by beyond and to the 16 exclusion of all reasonable doubt, like we are 17 sending someone to jail or something. it is a 18 different standard. it is a lower standard in a 19 civil case than in a criminal case. so did we tip 20 the scales in our favor in this case? did we 21 provide the more convincing evidence of sonny 22 ellis's class membership? i submit to you that we 23 did. 24 first question on the verdict form is "do you 25 find that clarence c. ellis was addicted to 3164 1 cigarettes containing nicotine, and that mr. ellis 2 had lung cancer, and, if so, that his addiction was 3 a legal cause of his lung cancer and death?" i 4 want to point out to you, it says "that his 5 addiction was a legal cause of his lung cancer and 6 death." 7 you get that question repeatedly on this 8 verdict form, and you are going to see that in the 9 instructions "a legal cause", not "the legal 10 cause." 11 and it is important. and i talked about this 12 in opening statement. his addiction does not have 13 to be the only cause of his death. the addiction 14 can be one of the causes of his death as long as it 15 contributes substantially. 16 it can work in tandem with other causes. r.j. 17 reynolds' concealment. r.j. reynolds' 18 participation in the conspiracy all those years and 19 lying about what these companies knew to be true 20 about their product in order to keep addicted 21 smokers smoking. 22 it works in tandem with sonny ellis's failure 23 to try harder to quit. mrs. ellis comes to this 24 trial telling you her husband bears responsibility 25 here, but not alone. 3165 1 and so we do not exclude all these other 2 causes. they all work in tandem together because 3 the law recognizes that life is complex and that 4 events do not just happen usually from one single 5 event, usually it is a bunch of events that work 6 together. the law recognizes the complexities of 7 that, and that is why you get this kind of 8 instruction about "an addiction to smoking 9 cigarettes containing nicotine is a legal cause," 10 not the legal cause, "a legal cause of cancer and 11 death if it directly and in natural and continuous 12 sequence produces it." 13 but then it says, in the bottom paragraph, "in 14 order to be regarded as a legal cause of cancer and 15 death, an addiction to cigarettes containing 16 nicotine need not be the only cause." these things 17 all work together. you are going to get this 18 instruction on every claim in this case. 19 "an addiction to cigarettes containing 20 nicotine may be a legal cause of cancer and death 21 even though it operates in combination with the act 22 of another or some other cause if the addiction 23 contributes substantially to producing the cancer 24 and death." 25 so what was the evidence in this case on sonny 3166 1 ellis's addiction? dr. burns, who writes the 2 chapters in the books in our doctors' offices on 3 nicotine addiction. dr. burns said mr. ellis was 4 addicted. dr. cummings, who is a cancer researcher 5 and teaches physicians how to do this, set up the 6 new york state quitline, has worked with 7 something -- i think if he said 10,000 smokers in 8 his 30-year career doing this. he says that 9 mr. ellis was addicted. 10 dr. mccoy, his family doctor, dr. sheedy, his 11 oncologist, dr. martin and dr. bianco. betty ellis 12 said, not a doctor, but i think he was addicted. 13 and sonny ellis told us that. 14 sonny ellis in the depositions you saw, and 15 i'll show you the transcripts in a minute, "i wish 16 to goodness i could quit. i've been doing it so 17 long, i just cannot." ms. ellis said that her 18 husband would get tearful at times when he failed 19 to quit. sonny ellis wanted to quit, sonny ellis 20 tried to quit. 21 listening to dr. jaffe, wherever it is 22 dr. jaffe comes from, whether it is michigan or 23 connecticut or wherever it is, you know, he made it 24 sound like in order for someone to be addicted and 25 in order for someone to demonstrate they want to 3167 1 quit smoking they have to talk to everybody about 2 it. do you remember him saying that? 3 if he is not talking about it, that means he 4 does not want to quit. and that is not fair. we are 5 not all talkative, we are not all like dr. jaffe. 6 some of us are quiet. some of us do not talk about 7 every problem we have. 8 and so you heard the evidence about mr. ellis 9 being a quiet man like his father. and so he 10 did not talk about quitting smoking with everybody. 11 but that does not mean he did not want to quit. 12 we use the fagerstrom test, dr. cummings 13 talked about it, and you are going to learn that the 14 evidence, r.j. reynolds tobacco company uses the 15 fagerstrom test to evaluate nicotine addiction in 16 their own internal company studies, when they bring 17 addicted smokers in and want to migrate them off 18 cigarettes onto another product called snus, they 19 evaluate these people at r.j. reynolds with the 20 fagerstrom test, not this dsm thing that dr. jaffe 21 uses. r.j. reynolds uses the fagerstrom. 22 what does the -- sonny ellis's medical records 23 say about his smoking history? two packs a day for 24 34 years. two packs of lucky strikes per day. 25 smokes two packs per day tobacco habit for 34 3168 1 years. 2 dr. cummings, "no doubt in my mind that he was 3 addicted and heavily addicted. not a shred of 4 doubt in that regard." 5 dr. burns, "was he addicted? 6 "yes. 7 "the continuous exposure sustained the 8 addiction. he was addicted to lucky strikes and 9 the winstons." 10 dr. sheedy, "he was addicted to nicotine 11 contained in cigarette smoke." 12 dr. mccoy, "there is no doubt in my mind he 13 was addicted to nicotine and smoking." 14 betty ellis, "he said, 'i'd just fail.' he 15 said, 'i just attempted and i could not quit, and 16 i'm not going to do it again right now.' and i'm 17 not a doctor so i could not say he was addicted, but 18 i believe with all my heart he was." 19 barbara dixon. he told her he tried to quit. 20 "i wish to goodness i could quit." 21 martha martin, "i've got to give up this nasty 22 habit. i've been doing it so long, i cannot." 23 so what was his fagerstrom assessment, how 24 soon do you wake up, remember, this was the one 25 thing that was most predictive about whether 3169 1 someone was going to be successful at quitting or 2 not. 3 the one thing that identified how addictive it 4 was, "how soon do you smoke?" within five minutes 5 he gets three points. "he would get out of bed, 6 and cigarettes next to the bed, and he would pick 7 them up on his way to the bathroom and light up, 8 and he kept cigarettes in the bathroom." 9 dr. cummings scored him a three because he would 10 smoke within five minutes of waking. 11 did he find it difficult to refrain from 12 smoking in places? well -- where it was forbidden. 13 what was the testimony on that? he left a funeral 14 to smoke, he left his daughter's graduation to 15 smoke. and tammy said, as dr. jaffe was being 16 cross-examined, tammy testified in any social 17 setting, if it was indoors, he would end up outside 18 smoking. he left friends' homes to go outside and 19 smoke. 20 now, you did not hear any evidence in this case 21 that sonny ellis was one of those people who was an 22 inconsiderate man? so he would leave, but he would 23 have to leave. 24 which cigarette would he hate most to give up? 25 he is not here to tell us that and nobody knew, so 3170 1 we have to give him zero. how many cigarettes did 2 he smoke a day? 3 he smoked two to four packs -- two packs a 4 day, which is 40 cigarettes a day. dr. jaffe 5 admitted it was two to three packs. dr. cummings's 6 testimony was two to three packs, and betty ellis 7 said it was two to three cartons a week. so he 8 gets three points on number 4. 9 do you smoke more frequently during the first 10 hours after awakening than during the rest of the 11 day? well, the testimony was he chain smoked in 12 the morning when he got up. he did not chain smoke 13 all day. that is a trick. you would have to smoke nine 14 packs a day or something if you chain smoked all 15 day long. 16 what you heard was people go to sleep, the 17 nicotine levels in their receptors get low, and 18 when they wake, they got to replenish it, and they 19 replenished it first thing and then they chain -- 20 (snaps fingers), (snaps fingers), (snaps fingers), 21 and he chain smoked in the morning to replenish 22 his. and he chain smoked at night before he went 23 to bed. and you will hear, he got up in the middle 24 of the night to smoke cigarettes. 25 next one, jeff. 3171 1 did he smoke when he was sick? well, we know 2 he smoked when he was diagnosed with lung cancer 3 and told to stop smoking. but he also smoked when 4 he was sick with the flu and was staying home. 5 dr. jaffe admitted to that. and he continued to 6 smoke after his diagnosis. 7 so a total score is eight points, which under 8 the fagerstrom is heavily addicted, heavily 9 addicted, using the test that r.j. reynolds uses in 10 its own clinical studies to evaluate nicotine 11 dependence. 12 so the evidence in this case, every doctor who 13 testified in this case, all four of them testified 14 that he was addicted. dr. jaffe confirmed that on 15 the stand. dr. mccoy, dr. sheedy, dr. martin, 16 dr. bianco, they all say he was addicted. 17 ask yourself if dr. jaffe was believable. 150 18 hours in this case? 19 let us talk about lung cancer. the evidence 20 was that he had lung cancer, bronchogenic carcinoma 21 caused by cigarette smoking. it was undisputed, 22 uncontroverted evidence that smoking was the only 23 exposure sonny ellis had in his life to cause lung 24 cancer. was not exposed to asbestos. he was not 25 exposed to radon. 3172 1 he was not exposed to these other things that 2 cause lung cancer. he smoked two packs a day for 3 over 30 years. the evidence was undisputed and 4 uncontroverted that it looked like a primary lung 5 cancer, a bronchogenic carcinoma. "solitary left 6 upper lobe nodule. this is very worrisome for a 7 bronchogenic carcinoma." not a metastatic 8 carcinoma from somewhere else, but a bronchogenic 9 primary lung cancer. 10 it was undisputed, uncontroverted evidence 11 that when they stuck a needle into that spot in the 12 lung and drew the tissue out of that lesion in his 13 lung, it came back as large cell undifferentiated 14 carcinoma compatible with lung primary. 15 it is undisputed, uncontroverted evidence that 16 this cancer did not start in his brain, it did not 17 start in his spine, it did not start in his 18 shoulder, it did not start in his orbit. 19 their own expert admitted that none of those 20 went to the lung. that they could have -- that it 21 could have started in the lung, he called it a 22 distinct possibility. 23 but you remember this whole thing about them 24 wanting to have it both ways. first he said, well, 25 that tumor in the lung was only a centimeter and a 3173 1 half, 2 centimeters, small he said. 2 centimeters 2 to an inch, i believe. it was too small to spread 3 to all those parts, so it needed to be a bigger 4 tumor. 5 well, they did a ct scan of the abdomen, they 6 did a ct scan of the pelvis, and they did not find 7 any big tumor anywhere else. he gave a whole list 8 of things, that it could have come from his testes. 9 well, he spent two months in the hospital, saw 15 10 doctors, do you hear anything about testes cancer 11 in any of these records? everybody poking him and 12 prodding him and running him through all these 13 tests? 14 nobody said anything about kidneys. and he 15 had a scan that did not show a big tumor in his 16 kidneys or in his bladder or in his pancreas or in 17 his esophagus. they scanned him and it was normal. 18 the only place they saw was that spot in the lung, 19 which they biopsied, and i think dr. okun said the 20 tissue is the issue, and it darn sure is, and the 21 tissue was lung cancer. and there is no question 22 about that. 23 they pulled it out and he said it is a large 24 cell carcinoma compatible with lung primary. 25 and so after saying it needed to be a big 3174 1 tumor, then they say, well, this was a really 2 aggressive one because it was undifferentiated. 3 and that is the part that we agree with him on. it 4 was undifferentiated, you darn right, that is 5 aggressive. 6 you heard dr. burns talk about it, you heard 7 dr. okun talk about it, it is very aggressive. you 8 can have a centimeter and a half, 2 centimeter or 3 9 centimeter nodule lesion in your lung that is cancer 10 and it can go to all those places because it is very 11 aggressive. 12 they did not find a single tumor anywhere else 13 other than the metastatic sites and the spot in his 14 lung. and they could not tell you where it came 15 from, and they admitted that it was lung -- that it 16 was -- they admitted that it was a distinct 17 possibility that it was lung cancer, but every 18 single one of his doctors said it was lung cancer. 19 and showing you mr. ellis's medical records is 20 not an exercise in quantity over quality that 21 dr. okun said. that was -- you evaluate what you 22 think of that statement in the context of the 23 physicians who worked hard trying to help 24 mr. ellis, whether that was not quality, it was 25 just quantity. 3175 1 and you evaluate the way he would say it was a 2 fact if he liked it, but if he did not like it, it 3 was just an opinion. when he liked what dr. bilek 4 said about unknown primary, that was a fact. 5 when he did not like it when dr. bilek said it 6 was a bronchogenic -- biopsy-proven bronchogenic 7 carcinoma in september and december and late 8 january and on february 8, two weeks before 9 mr. ellis died, his office is calling it lung 10 cancer and he is signing off on it? they did not 11 show you that. we had to show you that. 12 but evaluate dr. okun, who, on direct 13 examination, could tell you the thought processes 14 of the doctors who were writing these medical 15 records but somehow lost that ability when he was 16 on cross-examination. 17 ask yourselves how it was that r.j. reynolds' 18 expert knew what dr. burgert meant. on direct exam 19 when dr. burgert -- if you can put that path report 20 up, jeff, when dr. burgert said that it was a large 21 cell undifferentiated cancer compatible with lung 22 primary, to dr. okun that somehow meant that it was 23 not lung cancer. 24 but then all the other doctors who knew 25 dr. burgert and worked with dr. burgert, all of 3176 1 them interpreted that same path report as primary 2 lung cancer. in fact, dr. bilek said that it was a 3 biopsy-proven bronchogenic carcinoma. 4 every doctor that knew dr. burgert, the 5 pathologist who made that diagnosis, knew that he 6 meant lung cancer. 7 and here is where the evidence really comes 8 down on this. more doctors than we can even 9 identify in the medical record said it was lung 10 cancer. the best they have got is i ain't sure. 11 it is a distinct possibility. 12 so was cancer the cause of his death? 13 dr. okun is not sure, but he did say, if you 14 recall, that the cancer is what caused his death, 15 he is just not sure if it started in the lung. but 16 dr. sheedy, dr. mccoy, and dr. burns, and the death 17 certificate is in evidence, that he died from 18 metastatic lung cancer. 19 and ask yourself, you know, what else does 20 addiction do but cause you to repeatedly expose 21 yourself to what it is you are addicted to? and 22 the problem with smoking is if you are addicted to 23 the nicotine and you expose yourself to that 24 cigarette smoke over and over again and get that 25 nicotine and, unfortunately, all the carcinogens 3177 1 come with it. 2 that is why nicotine addiction causes people to 3 die, and that is why nicotine addiction causes 4 people to get diseases like copd. and we are not 5 claiming damages for mr. ellis's copd, the law 6 would not allow us to do that because he died of 7 lung cancer and that is our claim. 8 but did you hear any evidence in this case 9 from r.j. reynolds that cigarette smoking did not 10 cause his copd? you heard the testimony, 11 uncontroverted testimony that copd was caused by 12 cigarette smoking, but then they turn around and 13 say that, oh, well, we are not sure cigarette 14 smoking causes lung cancer. 15 so we have two packs a day for 34 years. and 16 let us show the dosage demonstrative. you get eight 17 to ten inhales per cigarette. so eight to ten 18 inhales per cigarette -- per -- per cigarette, and 19 20 cigarettes in a pack, two packs a day, that is 40 20 cigarettes, 40 times eight, that is 320 to 400 hits 21 of nicotine every day. 4 million hits over his 22 lifetime. and with each one of those doses of 23 nicotine comes all those carcinogens. 24 and the defendant did not call anyone to say 25 that mr. ellis was immune to this powerfully 3178 1 addictive drug. they did not explain to you how it 2 would even be possible to expose yourself to a drug 3 like that that many times for that long and not be 4 addicted. 5 so on verdict form question 1, you know, the 6 issue there is not whether mr. ellis had free 7 choice. the plaintiff has not come here saying that 8 he lacked the ability to make a choice. 9 the issue is not whether sonny ellis was unable 10 to control himself, because we know he was 11 physically able to control his actions. the issue 12 is not whether addiction took over sonny ellis's 13 life completely. the issue is whether addiction 14 was a substantial contributing factor, one of many 15 causes. 16 and ask yourselves, if sonny ellis was not 17 addicted to nicotine, would he have exposed himself 18 to dozens of carcinogens day after day after day 19 for 40 years? 20 and if sonny ellis was not addicted to 21 nicotine, would he have smoked until he died while 22 undergoing surgery to remove vertebral bodies out 23 of his spine that had cancer in them? because he 24 wants to live. and he is undergoing all this 25 treatment. 3179 1 look at the medical records. he had a 2 horrible, horrible time in the last five months of 3 his life trying to live. why would -- what other 4 reason would he have to smoke other than nicotine 5 addiction? 6 was r.j. reynolds wrong when they told 7 themselves that people smoke for nicotine, that 8 "nicotine is the sine qua non of cigarettes, 9 without which cigarettes would not exist"? were 10 they wrong? were they wrong when they said, "if we 11 take the nicotine too low, people will stop 12 smoking"? were they wrong when they said, "most 13 people cannot quit"? 14 their internal documents show that is what r.j. 15 reynolds believes when they are talking to 16 themselves. they were right about nicotine being 17 addictive. they were right about why it is people 18 cannot stop. and they were right about it causing 19 cancer. and without addiction, people do not smoke 20 until they get these diseases and die. 21 now, if you answer yes to question 1 on the 22 verdict form, sonny ellis -- you will have found 23 sonny ellis is a member of the engle class. if you 24 answer no, then mrs. ellis loses and r.j. reynolds 25 wins and it is over, you will have pinned a blue 3180 1 ribbon on r.j. reynolds. 2 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 3 the court: sustain. 4 mr. persons: it is an improper argument. move 5 to strike. 6 the court: it is granted. 7 mr. gustafson: a yes answer, though, that 8 means that the engle findings apply. 9 the engle findings are that "cigarette smoking 10 causes lung cancer" and it lists the one that sonny 11 ellis had, large cell carcinoma. "nicotine in 12 cigarettes is addictive. r.j. reynolds placed 13 cigarettes on the market that were defective and 14 unreasonably dangerous. r.j. reynolds was 15 negligent. r.j. reynolds concealed or omitted 16 material information not otherwise known or 17 available, knowing that the material was false or 18 misleading or failed to disclose a material fact 19 concerning the health effects or addictive nature 20 of smoking cigarettes or both. 21 and that reynolds agreed with other cigarette 22 manufacturers and corporations to conceal or omit 23 information regarding the health effects of 24 cigarette smoking or the addictive nature of 25 cigarettes with the intention that smokers and 3181 1 members of the public would rely on this 2 information to their detriment." 3 those findings are binding on the jury and the 4 court and parties if you answer yes to question 1. 5 now, the engle findings were the result of a 6 trial lasting over a year. there was not any effort 7 to reprove engle findings in this trial. we had a 8 four and a half days of the plaintiff's case. 9 there is no way we could try to reprove the engle 10 findings here. 11 what we did was show you how those kinds of 12 things affect people like sonny ellis and how they, 13 in fact, affected sonny ellis, how he responded to 14 their message, how it was that cigarettes are so 15 addictive that sonny ellis smoked until he died. 16 this is one of those stories that only has one 17 side. there is no other side to the story of this 18 tobacco company and the other co-conspirators and 19 what they did. agreeing to lie to smokers, 20 agreeing to conceal what they knew to be true about 21 causing cancer and addiction, carrying that scheme 22 to lie to the american people for almost 50 years, 23 all for money, did not matter who died, did not 24 matter how many, they did not care. money. 25 question 2 on the verdict form is concealment. 3182 1 "was r.j. reynolds' concealment or omission of 2 material information about the health effects or 3 addictive nature of smoking cigarettes, or both, a 4 legal cause of clarence c. ellis's death?" 5 when an addicted smoker tries to quit smoking 6 and they fail and they are told it is just because of 7 their behavior, that they are choosing to pick 8 cigarettes up one more time, that they do not know 9 how powerfully addictive nicotine is, they do not 10 know that the company that they are buying the 11 cigarettes from is putting ammonia in the 12 cigarettes so they freebase the nicotine to their 13 addicted brain, they do not know that the company is 14 putting things like levulinic acid in it and 15 monkeying with the ph to make it more inhalable, 16 therefore, making it more addictive, they do not 17 know that. 18 all of that stuff is withheld from sonny 19 ellis. ask yourselves if you knew that when you 20 showed up for this trial, did you know those 21 things, it is 2014, and if you learned those things 22 here, ask yourself how it is that r.j. reynolds can 23 say sonny ellis should have known himself. 24 mr. persons: objection, your honor. golden 25 rule. 3183 1 the court: sustained. 2 mr. gustafson: you know now that reynolds 3 sold defective and unreasonably dangerous 4 cigarettes. you know now what reynolds was doing 5 to those cigarettes. you know now that reynolds 6 knew that their cigarettes were addictive and that 7 they designed them to be that way, and they lied 8 about it. you know now that reynolds knew that 9 addiction made it so most of their customers 10 could not stop. and reynolds lied about that. 11 and you -- reynolds knew that their customers 12 would get addicted and that addiction would lead to 13 what they call unattractive side effects, like lung 14 cancer. and they lied about that. and those are 15 exactly the things that happened to mr. ellis. 16 and you know that, that when they say that 17 smoking is a choice, that they were doing 18 everything they could to engineer cigarettes and 19 add things to them to make it really, really hard 20 to carry through on that choice. 21 because what they say is very different than 22 what they do. you know that now. [#deleted recess#] [#deleted motion for mistrial#] 12 mr. gustafson: may it please the court? 13 the court: yes, sir. 14 mr. gustafson: sonny ellis died february 26, 15 1993. two days ago was the 21st anniversary of 16 sonny ellis's death. he died in 1993. and was 17 there any evidence that sonny ellis knew that the 18 defendant was putting additives in his cigarettes? 19 was there any evidence that he knew there was 20 ammonia being added to it? 21 was there any evidence that he knew that they 22 were manipulating the ph? was there any evidence 23 that he knew that they were engineering the 24 cigarettes he smoked to be addictive? and there is 25 not because they kept that to themselves. and so 3188 1 sonny ellis blamed his behavior on himself. he 2 would get tearful when he tried to quit. because 3 the message from the companies was it is your 4 behavior, it is not anything we do, even though they 5 know they are doing it, this is your behavior. 6 but, you know, knowledge is a powerful thing. 7 when you know why it is that you cannot quit, when 8 you know why it is that you keep smoking, just like 9 dr. daniel horn said in that slide that we showed 10 you and in dr. burns's testimony, when dr. horn 11 said people need to know why it is they cannot stop 12 smoking, they need to know why it is they smoke. 13 sonny ellis did not know those things. 14 the defendant kept those things to themself. 15 and they tell you it is just sonny ellis's behavior, 16 it is just his choice. well, that is true -- if 17 that is true that smoking is just a choice, and 18 addiction does not play a role in it, nicotine 19 does not have nothing to do with it, you know, lay 20 aside why they are monkeying with it, doing all the 21 stuff they are doing to cigarettes to increase 22 addiction and maximize -- let us put all that aside, 23 if it is really true what r.j. reynolds is saying, 24 people just smoking because they want to smoke and 25 nicotine addiction does not got nothing to do with 3189 1 it and it is just your behavior, it is just your 2 fault, if that is true, why would sonny ellis need 3 to go to the doctor to stop doing something that he 4 just was voluntarily doing? why would he need to 5 go to the doctor. 6 it kind of gives you a window into his thought 7 process. why would he need to go to the doctor if 8 it is just, hey, i'll just change my behavior? but 9 i keep failing. and i do not like failing in front 10 of my family. i do not like failing in front of my 11 wife. 10, 15 times betty said he tried to quit, 12 over and over and over again. and you know now why 13 it is he could not do it. 14 now, the concealment instruction, the 15 instruction that goes with this question number 2, 16 is a long instruction, but it is that important 17 thing again. it has to be a legal cause if it 18 directly and in a natural and continuous sequence 19 produces or contributes substantially to producing 20 mr. ellis's lung cancer and death. 21 and then there is that instruction again that 22 i told you about before where the law recognizes 23 the complexities of life and how more than one 24 thing works together to create an outcome. the law 25 recognizes that. in order to be regarded as a 3190 1 legal cause of cancer and death, the fraud by 2 concealment or omission need not be the only cause. 3 it can be a legal cause even though it operates in 4 combination with the act of another or some other 5 cause. 6 here the addiction combines with the 7 defendant's concealment of the truth. and then 8 with their conspiracy with the other companies to 9 conceal the truth and to create the tobacco 10 institute to go out and lie to people and put stuff 11 in the newspaper. and council for tobacco 12 research. research that does not have nothing to do 13 with cigarette smoking. 14 you get to question number 3 on the verdict 15 form, which is similar to the concealment question, 16 except this time it is the conspiracy to conceal. 17 "was r.j. reynolds' agreement with the other 18 cigarette manufacturers and corporations to conceal 19 or omit information regarding the health effects of 20 cigarettes or their addictive nature a legal cause 21 of clarence c. ellis's death?" 22 similar to concealment except this time 23 they are all conspiring to do it. so they get to 24 borrow everything their co-conspirators did 25 bringing in here with you. and that is why we show 3191 1 you philip morris documents, lorillard documents, 2 documents of other companies, because they were all 3 in this together. 4 and the issue here is not whether information 5 on the harms of smoking was available. we know 6 that. we know that the information was out there. 7 you did not hear the plaintiffs say -- we brought 8 the people that tried to get the information out 9 there, their whole career, that is who our expert 10 witnesses were. 11 the issue is not whether sonny ellis ever saw a 12 warning on a pack of cigarettes. the issue is 13 whether reynolds's false controversy was a 14 substantial contributing factor, one cause among 15 many causes. and that gets us to those articles on 16 the refrigerator. betty ellis said her husband 17 would try to quit smoking and he failed. and then 18 he would not be ready right now because he would just 19 failed, and that can be a shattering experience. 20 and it is in those times that addicted people, 21 like sonny ellis, latch onto things, like a 22 psychological crutch. here is a philip morris 23 document, right, in 1964, when the surgeon 24 general's report is going to come out, the first 25 big one in 1964 that says cigarette smoking causes 3192 1 lung cancer in men, and they are all trying to 2 figure out what are we going to do, and here we go, 3 "we must in the near future provide some answers 4 which will give smokers a psychological crutch and 5 self-rationale to continue smoking." then when 6 somebody actually does what they want, they come in 7 here and say, well, it is your fault, should not do 8 this. 9 do they get it both ways? are y'all going to 10 tolerate that? 11 they continued his whole life. what was the 12 testimony on it? he repetitively brought home 13 cuttings out of the newspaper articles, he put them 14 on the refrigerator door. when they said you ought 15 to quit, he would bring them over and say, here, it 16 had not been proven, the evidence is not there. 17 betty ellis, "he started gathering articles on 18 smoking and health. numerous times he would put it 19 on the refrigerator with a magnet. they would 20 reference not being harmful. he wanted people to 21 know he was not doing anything wrong." 22 the defendants admit that it was reasonable 23 for sonny ellis to rely on what they said, not just 24 back in the '60s, but in the '70s and '80s and 25 '90s. robert heimann was the ceo of american 3193 1 tobacco company at one point. "our advertising is 2 truthful. we anticipate they would rely on it if 3 they chose. 4 "it is a promise as to what the consumer can 5 expect from their product? 6 "yes, it is." 7 and then what does he say? 8 "would you put the warning on there if 9 congress did not require it? 10 "no. we believe our product is not injurious 11 to health." 12 he says, "the surgeon general is misguided in 13 telling them they got to put warnings on there. 14 "not being polite about it, in your opinion, 15 the surgeon general is wrong?" 16 he says, "dead wrong." 17 that was their message and they wanted people 18 to rely on it. it was reasonable to rely. 19 look at james johnston, the ceo of r.j. 20 reynolds tobacco, 1992 testimony. "we expect our 21 customers to take in all available information and 22 make their own judgments about the risks versus the 23 benefits." 24 it is reasonable. 25 "specifically you think it was reasonable for 3194 1 your customers, the smokers of your cigarettes, to 2 believe what you said and rely upon what you 3 publicly said in these advertisements?" 4 and that is a 1984 tallahassee democrat, full 5 page ad, "can we have an open debate about 6 smoking?" 7 and he said, "that would be reasonable, that is 8 why they put them out." 9 this program of deceit made a difference with 10 a lot of americans, and sonny ellis was one of 11 them. where else would mr. ellis have gotten the 12 message that it was not proven that cigarettes cause 13 disease? what evidence did you see that someone 14 else was saying that other than the defendant and 15 its co-conspirators? 16 nothing. you know now where that message came 17 from. they brought you nothing to show it was 18 somebody else. that industry message capitalized 19 on this american tradition, fairness that we have. 20 you do not just level accusations at people unless 21 you are darn sure that you are right and you can 22 prove it. 23 and they made it seem like the proof was 24 lacking. and they tried to make a controversy here 25 that somehow mr. ellis, whose only exposure was 3195 1 smoking cigarettes, somehow got cancer from 2 something else. but they brought you nothing on 3 what it was. 4 they made it seem unfair to blame cigarettes 5 for something that was not proven, and it started 6 when sonny ellis was a child. r.j. reynolds, 7 "let us look at the growing importance of the young 8 adult in the cigarette market. in 1960, this young 9 adult market, this 14 to 24 age group, represented 10 21 percent of the population." that was sonny 11 ellis's age group. 12 "they represent tomorrow's cigarette business. 13 as this group matures, they will account for a key 14 share of the total cigarette volume for at least 15 the next 25 years." that is why they use ammoniated 16 reconstituted tobacco and levulinic acid and monkey 17 with the ph, because these people represent their 18 business for the next 25 years and they want to 19 keep them. 20 "ammonia is the key to competing in smoke 21 quality with philip morris worldwide. the us 22 cigarette industry uses about 10 million pounds of 23 it a year. 10 milligrams of ammonia compounds per 24 cigarette produced." that is how much they go 25 through. 3196 1 "smoke ph and free nicotine." dr. teague. "a 2 cigarette is a system for delivery for nicotine to 3 the smoker in an attractive, useful form. at 4 normal smoke ph, below 6. all the smoked nicotine 5 is chemically combined with acidic substances and 6 it is non-volitive and slowly absorbed. 7 as the smoke ph increases above 6, an 8 increasing proportion of the smoke occurs in free 9 form, which is volatile, rapidly absorbed by the 10 smoker and believed to be instantly perceived as 11 nicotine kick." 12 they made it so people freebased nicotine, not 13 just smoking a cigarette, they were freebasing 14 nicotine. "in addition to enhancing nicotine kick, 15 increasing the ph of the smoke above 6 causes other 16 changes, particularly when the increase in smoke ph 17 is achieved by adding ammonia to the blend." 18 "recent investigations indicate that natural 19 or added ammonia and its salts in tobacco and smoke 20 play an important role in determining the acidity 21 or alkalinity, the ph, of the smoke. this in turn 22 determines the amounts of free and combined 23 nicotine present in smoke, which strongly 24 influences the way in which the nicotine is 25 perceived by the smoker." 3197 1 "recent experience in smoking cigarettes known 2 to deliver abnormally high concentrations of 3 ammonia or ammonium salts indicates that a 4 significant stimulation occurs. increased rate and 5 force of heartbeat, tremor, and sweating, similar 6 to that caused by increased adrenaline." 7 "if, as suggested, ammonia and its salts in 8 smoke are found to make desirable contributions to 9 the physiological satisfactions derived from 10 smoking, we will want to optimize this effect in 11 existing and slash or new products." 12 and what was in sonny ellis's products? 13 ammoniated reconstituted tobacco. 14 and what do they put in their cigarettes today 15 on their website? ammonium hydroxide. ethyl 16 levulinate, which you have learned was levulinic 17 acid. 18 but you know how it began because in 1953, you 19 see that dip on the blue line, 1953 there is a drop 20 in sales because the new information is coming out 21 that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer. now, 22 they say everybody had known for hundreds of years. 23 but when it hits the newspaper, people stop 24 buying cigarettes. so they hire a public relations 25 firm, and they go to the plaza hotel and they come 3198 1 up with their plan. the pr firm finds out what it 2 was the companies knew. 3 you will find some interesting opinions. one of 4 the men said, "it is fortunate for us that 5 cigarettes are a habit that they cannot break. 6 would not it be wonderful if our company was the 7 first to produce a cancer-free cigarette." 8 they needed to keep this knowledge to 9 themselves while making others think they were 10 being honest so they come out with the frank 11 statement. we accept an interest in people's 12 health. our products are not injurious. 13 this has been going on for 300 years and every 14 one of those claims that tobacco causes disease has 15 been abandoned for lack of evidence. they are 16 going to accept responsibility for the health of 17 their customers. 18 they knew they were lying. they reflected on 19 how they were lying. "our basic position in the 20 cigarette controversy is subject to the charge that 21 we are making false or misleading statements to 22 promote the sale of cigarettes." 23 they knew someday they were going to get 24 caught. chickens do come home. 25 1968, they attack the surgeon general with 3199 1 their report on "it is a shockingly intemperate 2 defamation of an industry which led the way in 3 research." they were withholding research. they 4 were withholding what they knew to be true about 5 cigarettes causing cancer and being addictive. 6 they called the surgeon general a liar in 7 1972. "the extent to which the public health 8 officials may knowingly mislead the american 9 public." how did this work for them? 10 you saw all those newspaper articles, and i 11 ain't going to go through all that again, but you 12 saw it, they had tv time, they had newspaper time, 13 they got their say too. how did it work? they 14 tell us how it worked. they tell us for nearly 20 15 years, we employed a single strategy to defend 16 ourself on three major fronts: litigation, 17 politics, and public opinion. it was brilliantly 18 conceived and executed over the years helping us 19 win important battles. we want to create doubt 20 about the health charge. 21 we learned that the industry outspent public 22 health authorities in the us government by several 23 hundred times. "the national commission on smoking 24 and public policy reported in 1978 that the tobacco 25 industry spent more on advertising cigarettes in 3200 1 one day than the national clearinghouse on smoking 2 and health, the government's primary agency working 3 in this area, spent in one year." they spent more 4 in a day than the government spent in a year. 5 they agreed to conceal what they knew. that 6 their customers had physiological requirements for 7 nicotine. that they applied nicotine to cigarettes 8 to meet that requirement. they agreed to conceal 9 cigarettes were addictive, caused cancer. they 10 agreed to conceal that they experimented with 11 freebasing nicotine. they likened their customers 12 to rats in a lab cage, where the rat pushes the 13 lever for food. 14 it continued into the '80s. nationwide media 15 campaign in 1984. "can we have an open debate 16 about smoking?" this is published by r.j. 17 reynolds. "over the years, you have heard so many 18 negative reports about smoking and health and so 19 little to challenge these reports, you may assume 20 the case against smoking is closed. but this is 21 far from the truth." 22 and it continued into the '90s. they lied to 23 congress. 24 (video clip played as follows:) 25 speaker: i would like you to rise and those 3201 1 who will be testifying as well with you to rise. 2 would you raise your right hand? do you swear that 3 the testimony you are about to give is the truth, 4 the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? 5 the witnesses: i do. 6 speaker: please consider yourself to be under 7 oath. 8 representative wyden: let me begin my 9 questioning on the matter of whether or not 10 nicotine is addictive. let me ask you first, and i 11 would like to just go down the row, whether each of 12 you believes that nicotine is not addictive. i 13 heard virtually all of you touch on it and just yes 14 or no, do you believe nicotine is not addictive? 15 mr. campbell: i believe nicotine is not 16 addictive, yes. 17 mr. wyden: mr. johnston. 18 mr. james johnston: congressman, cigarettes 19 and nicotine clearly do not meet the classic 20 definitions of addiction. there is no 21 intoxication. 22 representative wyden: we will take that as a 23 no. and again, time is short if you can just -- i 24 think each of you believe nicotine is not 25 addictive, and we just would like to have this for 3202 1 the record. 2 mr. taddeo: i do not believe that nicotine or 3 our products are addictive. 4 mr. tisch: i believe nicotine is not 5 addictive. 6 mr. horrigan: i believe that nicotine is not 7 addictive. 8 mr. sandefur: i believe that nicotine is not 9 addictive. 10 mr. donald johnston: and i too believe that 11 nicotine is not addictive. 12 representative waxman: mr. campbell, you were 13 also deposed, and you said, quote, to my knowledge, 14 it has not been proven that cigarette smoking 15 causes cancer. this is a rather passive and 16 puzzling approach especially in light of the 17 consensus, not by some but all of the scientific 18 community. 19 will you ever be convinced? and what evidence 20 are you waiting for? and let us have the microphone 21 passed over, please. 22 mr. campbell: yes, i may be convinced. we 23 do not know what causes cancer in general right now, 24 so i think that we may find out what causes cancer 25 and we may find out some relationship, which is yet 3203 1 to be proven. 2 (video clip stopped.) 3 mr. gustafson: the evidence in this case is 4 that from time to time, sonny ellis would take 5 these kinds of statements and he would cut them out 6 of the newspaper and put them on his refrigerator. 7 there is not any evidence that he did not do that. 8 everyone said he did that. his wife said it. his 9 kids said it. he relied on what these people were 10 saying. 11 when you get to questions 2 and 3 on the 12 verdict form, given the evidence in this case, the 13 answers to those questions ought to be yes. 14 and that brings us to question 4. as ms. 15 ellis has said all along, her husband shares in the 16 responsibility. the judge read to you what her 17 position was in this case, is that he bears 18 responsibility in combination with reynolds. 19 she came here insisting on her husband sharing 20 in that responsibility. now, the defendant tries 21 to say that he is totally at fault. and what is he 22 totally at fault for? because their -- their 23 defense in this case, what they presented to you, 24 was he is not addicted, he does not have lung cancer, 25 and if he did have lung cancer, it was not caused by 3204 1 cigarette smoke. 2 so how could it be that mr. ellis has any 3 fault in this case if reynolds is taking those 4 positions? how can they say that he is at fault if 5 they are saying that cigarette smoking did not cause 6 his lung cancer? what is he at fault for? if 7 smoking did not do it, why is he at fault? 8 listen carefully to what they say about that. 9 because they do not get it both ways, see. 10 so you -- you contrast ms. ellis taking 11 responsibility. and even though the defendant 12 promised in 1954 they accepted responsibility -- 13 mr. persons: objection, your honor, and i 14 have a -- 15 the court: okay, let us go sidebar. 16 (the following is at the bench.) 17 mr. persons: object to the comment about the 18 refusal to take responsibility. that was on the 19 very tips of his lips when the objection was made. 20 the preface to it was that even though they had 21 promised back in 1954 before the frank statement, 22 which had just been shown to the jury in the past 23 few minutes, and then he was going to couple that 24 with they still refuse to take responsibility. 25 that is clearly improper, and i move for a 3205 1 mistrial on that basis. there is no requirement 2 that the defendant in this case at this trial has 3 an obligation to take responsibility for what 4 happened to mr. ellis. 5 mr. gustafson: i have not said that. he said 6 i was fixing to say it, but i did not say it. and i 7 ain't going to say it. i was going to say i'm 8 allowed to comment on the evidence. 9 the court: um-hum (affirmative). 10 mr. gustafson: and the evidence is they 11 promised to take responsibility, accept 12 responsibility. 13 mr. sales: in 1954. 14 mr. gustafson: in 1954, and that is what i 15 said, and then they did not take responsibility 16 during his lifetime. i was not going to say that 17 they ain't taking responsibility here, because i 18 know there is an order in place where i'm not 19 allowed to say that and i did not say that. 20 so he is a little quick on the draw moving for 21 a mistrial on something i did not say and was not 22 going to say and ain't going to say. 23 the court: what is your position if he 24 says -- if his argument is they promised to take 25 responsibility in 1954 and did not during mr. 3206 1 ellis's life, and he stops there, what is your 2 position on that? 3 mr. persons: i think he -- i think that is 4 permissible. 5 the court: okay. 6 mr. persons: i think that is within the ambit 7 of the order. 8 the court: okay. here is what i think. 9 actually, i think mr. persons' objecting quickly is 10 a good thing, not a bad thing. so i think he -- 11 i'm going to overrule the objection, deny the 12 motion for a mistrial, with the notation that the 13 statement was not completed by plaintiff's counsel, 14 and i think we have an understanding on that topic 15 what is permissible and what is not. 16 mr. sales: okay. 17 the court: so just leave it. 18 mr. gustafson: i would appreciate it if i got 19 to make my closing argument without people 20 objecting to things i have not said. i'm entitled 21 to make a closing argument, and any objection 22 should come on things i say, if i say something 23 wrong, not something they think i'm going to say. 24 the court: well, okay. but that goes both 25 ways. 3207 1 mr. gustafson: sure. 2 the court: all right. i just think we ought 3 to keep going. 4 mr. persons: all right, sir. 5 the court: okay. 6 (in open court.) 7 the court: you may proceed. 8 mr. gustafson: please the court, your honor. 9 as i was saying, ms. ellis takes 10 responsibility for her husband's role in this. but 11 even though the defendant promised in 1954 that 12 they accepted responsibility for the health of 13 their customers and they were going to look after 14 their customers, they never did that in sonny 15 ellis's lifetime. they never did that. sonny 16 ellis relied on them. 17 now, the hearing, the congressional hearing 18 where the executives testified to congress, that 19 occurred the year after sonny ellis died. they 20 continued the same program long after sonny ellis 21 died, for years after he died. but he relied on 22 the things that they said. 23 so when you get to the comparative negligence 24 question, you are going to have an instruction on 25 it. the plaintiff has admitted that her husband 3208 1 bears partial fault here in combination with the 2 acts of reynolds and that you should determine the 3 extent to which mr. ellis's negligence was itself a 4 contributing legal cause of his cancer and death 5 and then you should write on the verdict form the 6 percentage of fault chargeable. 7 now, reynolds can deny that their program of 8 deceit contributed to causing sonny ellis's 9 addiction and death. they can say that. and none 10 of my comments are ever made about reynolds's 11 lawyers. this has nothing to do with their 12 lawyers. this has to do with r.j. reynolds tobacco 13 company. this is what i'm talking about. 14 you know, behind closed doors in their board 15 rooms and in their science labs, they celebrated 16 how successful their lies and deceit were in 17 keeping people smoking because what they say is 18 very different from what they do. their own 19 documents tell you that. they design these 20 cigarettes to be as addictive as possible. 21 you heard testimony about those additives and 22 how they take the nicotine out in the process and 23 put it back in, and the ammonia, making the smoke 24 easier to inhale. all of that was to make 25 cigarettes more addictive and keep smokers smoking, 3209 1 making quitting as hard as they could, take away 2 someone's choice. 3 and so if you compare the parties, sonny ellis 4 was someone who was honest and loyal and 5 trustworthy, and meanwhile r.j. reynolds is 6 engineering cigarettes to be addictive, putting 7 additives in them, celebrating how successful their 8 plan was in keeping people smoking, you are going to 9 have to have a decision to make about how it is 10 you are going to divvy up the fault for that on that 11 claim. 12 and so you know that the companies recognize, 13 you know, internally, that they "cannot defend 14 continued smoking as free choice if the person was 15 addicted." but they are going to tell you that he 16 had an unfettered free choice to stop smoking here 17 and that addiction had nothing to do with it. 18 because to these companies, they are so accustomed 19 to knowing one thing and saying another. 20 to them, it did not matter what sonny ellis did 21 as long as he went to the store and bought another 22 pack. if he quit, he should have quit sooner. if 23 he did not quit, he chose to smoke. heads, they 24 win, tails, everyone else loses. 25 and you need to keep in mind this jury 3210 1 instruction tells you that r.j. reynolds is legally 2 responsible for the american tobacco company and 3 brown & williamson tobacco corporation, because 4 they all merged. those three companies are now 5 r.j. reynolds. 6 and so it is three of them and it is one of mr. 7 ellis. and ask yourself, who knew more? who knew 8 more about addiction? who knew more about 9 monkeying with cigarettes? who knew more about 10 causing lung cancer and copd and other diseases? 11 was it sonny ellis or was it those guys? 12 this decision is yours and yours alone when 13 you get to this. as all these answers to all these 14 questions are. these are your decisions. i'm 15 going to make a suggestion to you that you put 20 16 percent on sonny ellis and you put eighty percent on 17 reynolds. look at the documents. look at what 18 happened here. the defendant is going to tell you 19 to put a hundred percent of fault on mr. ellis. 20 and if you do that, mrs. ellis loses and r.j. 21 reynolds wins. 22 i want you to think about this. the defendant 23 says that mr. ellis did not die from lung cancer 24 despite the evidence from all his treating doctors 25 that lung cancer is what he had and what killed 3211 1 him. the defendant says that mr. ellis died from 2 something that had nothing to do with smoking. 3 and then the defendant tells you it is all 4 sonny ellis's fault because he chose to smoke. 5 now, if he did not die from smoking, how is it all 6 sonny ellis's fault choosing to smoke if you take 7 their position? how can it possibly be both? it 8 cannot. it cannot. it is neither. 9 so you get to question 5 on the verdict form, 10 "what is the total amount of damages sustained by 11 plaintiff betty jean ellis for the loss of clarence 12 c. ellis's companionship and protection and for her 13 pain and suffering as a result of clarence c. 14 ellis's injury and death?" 15 this is always the hard part because the 16 instruction which you need to follow when you 17 answer this question -- you know, the instruction 18 tells you there is no standard way of measuring 19 this. 20 so what happens when your best friend, person 21 you grew up with, person you had children with, 22 person you raised a family with and spent your life 23 with, what happens when you learn that they are 24 dying and there is not much time left? 25 you hang onto every day, you try to make the 3212 1 most of every day, and you try not to think that 2 this is really happening and the end is really 3 coming and you watch the love of your life waste 4 away in front of you. 5 sonny ellis died a relentless, painful, 6 frightening death. you heard dr. sheedy say he was 7 in a wheelchair when he started seeing him in 8 january. he had spine surgery and radiation and 9 all. 10 what happens when your spouse dies at 56 years 11 old? betty ellis lost everything. she is been 12 alone for 21 years. 21 years two days ago. that 13 house she loved that sonny bought her that day, she 14 could not live there anymore. 15 she is lived alone for 21 years, she has not 16 dated, she did not want to, she is never been 17 interested in anybody else, and you know you would have 18 heard about it if she was. she spent 15 years 19 trying to figure out what he was trying to say to 20 her from his deathbed. 21 and the fact that he died at 56, a really 22 young age, 21 years ago, really only magnifies the 23 enormity of that loss that she has experienced for 24 21 years. he was supposed to live another 22 25 years. 3213 1 the mortality tables we published to you say 2 that. they are not binding on you, as the jury 3 instruction says, but that is the best we have got to 4 go on. he had a 22-year life expectancy at the 5 time of his death. 21 years two days ago. he is 6 supposed to still be here with her. 7 and the decision of what you put on question 5 8 again is yours and yours alone. i'm not going to 9 suggest a number to you. i've got three things to 10 say to you about answering this question. the 11 first one is, y'all need to follow the jury 12 instruction. you need to do what the judge tells 13 you to do if you are going to answer this question. 14 follow that instruction. 15 the second thing that you do, and i'm not 16 suggesting a number to you, but i'm asking you, 17 please, whatever you do, do not you award more than 18 $10 million. that would be too much. we do not 19 want you to do that. whatever number you are going 20 to put on question number 5 should not be more than 21 $10 million. 22 the other thing, the third thing i want to 23 tell you about answering question number 5 is if 24 you choose to answer that question, the number that 25 you put there needs to be respectful of betty 3214 1 ellis's loss. i'm not going to suggest a number to 2 you. y'all have more life experience than me. 3 if you get to question number 6, "under the 4 circumstances of this case, state whether you find 5 by clear and convincing evidence that punitive 6 damages are warranted against r.j. reynolds tobacco 7 company." 8 the entire time that sonny ellis smoked, from 9 the time he drew on his first cigarette as a boy to 10 the last one he smoked, this defendant knew that 11 cigarettes were highly, powerfully addictive and 12 caused lung cancer, and they lied about it. 13 and behind closed doors, when the rest of us 14 were not around to hear what they were saying and 15 see what they were writing in their little 16 documents to one another, they bragged to each 17 other about how smart and successful they were in 18 this whole program, how much money they were 19 making. without even looking at their internal 20 documents that tell us they knew their plan worked, 21 you can see what a difference the truth makes 22 today. 23 in sonny ellis's generation, seventy percent of 24 people in his age group smoked cigarettes. today, 25 these companies are required to tell the truth. 3215 1 today, one in five americans smoke. one in five. 2 it used to be one in two back when they were lying. 3 see, the truth, the truth is powerful, and the 4 truth makes a difference. 5 and reynolds's deceit made them a whole lot of 6 money. and they spent a lot pedaling the lives 7 that we have been showing you. remember i showed you 8 that interrogatory answer. the money that reynolds 9 and american tobacco and brown & williamson tobacco 10 corporation spent just on the tobacco institute 11 from 1958 till they went out of business in 1998 or 12 '99 was $330 million. 13 they do not have a problem spending money on 14 stuff that works for them. and it does not matter 15 to them how many people die, it does not matter how 16 they die, as long as they make money. 17 do you think they would have spent $330 18 million on that program if it was not working? 19 these are publicly held corporations, they have to 20 report to people. they have to report when they 21 spend that kind of money. you think they would 22 have done it if it was not working? 330 million. 23 and we are talking about money not 330 million in 24 today's dollars, we are just talking about the 25 numbers that they spent way back then and adding 3216 1 them up, that is how we get to 330. 2 the result, as you heard, was 20 million 3 americans dead. 443,000 americans die each year 4 from smoking-related diseases. now, we have never 5 had anything in the history of this country quite 6 like that. 7 and i do not know if r.j. reynolds is going to 8 tell you that the united states of america 9 suddenly, in 1913, had a rash of people that did not 10 want to live very long, and everybody decided to 11 run over the cliff and all smoke cigarettes and 12 kill themselves, because that is essentially what 13 amounts to their argument to you. 14 people all knew they were doing it to 15 themselves and they did not care, they just did not 16 care about living, they liked their cigarettes more 17 than their wives and their children and husbands 18 and everyone else. it happened because of 19 addiction. it happened because they could not go 20 without it. 21 you could fill this room, and you could ask 22 them to raise your hand if you lost someone you 23 loved to a smoking-related disease, and most of 24 that room would raise their hand. and you could do 25 that in every room across the united states of 3217 1 america, and the same thing would happen. that is 2 how many people they killed. 3 the jury instruction on this is long, but it is 4 important. i want to show you something about 5 this. the first one is that "punitive damages are 6 warranted if you find by clear and convincing 7 evidence," and i tell you there had not been any 8 evidence otherwise, it is the only evidence. 9 "the conduct causing injury to clarence ellis 10 was so gross and flagrant as to show a reckless 11 disregard of human life or of the safety of persons 12 exposed to the effects of such conduct; or the 13 conduct showed an entire lack of care that reynolds 14 must have been consciously indifferent to the 15 consequences; or the conduct showed such an entire 16 lack of care that r.j. reynolds must have wantonly 17 or recklessly disregarded the safety and welfare of 18 the public; or the conduct showed such reckless 19 indifference to the rights of others as to be 20 equivalent to an intentional violation of those 21 rights." 22 the reason i emphasize "or" is any one of 23 those things will work, and they did all four. you 24 wrap a blindfold around you and give you a dart, 25 you could throw it at that screen and no matter 3218 1 which one it hit, they did it. the law recognizes 2 that any one of those things is reprehensible. any 3 one of them is reprehensible. 4 you have only got to do one of the four, you 5 do not have to do all of the four, just one subjects 6 somebody to punitive damages, whether it is a 7 corporation or a person like you and me. they did 8 all four. 9 there is only one way to answer question 7, 10 and that is yes. 11 mr. sales: 6. 12 mr. gustafson: i'm sorry, question 6, i'm 13 sorry. 14 this is not a situation where they did not mean 15 it or it happened by accident and they did not know 16 that their conduct was going to cause people to 17 die. they knew. they knew. they lied. they 18 conspired to make more money. they did not care 19 that people were going to die, they did not care how 20 many. 21 i'm not going to describe that conduct to you. 22 you know what that is. they want you to give them 23 a pass. those 20 million people who died were real 24 people, those ones who died. they were real 25 people. they had children. they had spouses. the 3219 1 law says you get to take that into account when you 2 decide how to answer this question. you get to 3 take that into account, should they be punished. 4 sonny ellis was one of those people. 5 there is unrebutted, undisputed evidence in 6 this case that this conduct was exactly what you 7 know it to be. i'm not even going to describe it. 8 the evidence is clear and convincing that the only 9 truly acceptable answer to that last question on 10 this verdict form is yes. 11 i hope i did not miss anything. i hope i 12 did not go too long. this is my last chance to say 13 anything to you in this trial. i'm not going to do 14 the rebuttal argument. i want to tell you thank 15 you. i've never seen a jury ask so many questions. 16 i've never seen a jury so attentive. i've never 17 seen a jury so engaged in the case. 18 so i do not get to say anything else when i 19 leave this podium. y'all need to do what is right. 20 follow those instructions and do what is right. 21 thank you. 15 mr. sales: thank you, good afternoon, 16 everyone. 17 i want to say first of all in talking about 18 the time, i am known to be, as the court has 19 reminded me a few times, loquacious, and talk a 20 little bit too much. and it is likely that i will 21 use the entire hour that remains and probably 22 could, to the distress of all, stand at this 23 lectern and talk about sonny ellis and all of these 24 matters until it was far too late to do so. 25 i have a lot to cover, and i apologize, madam 3316 1 court reporter, because my words may come out a 2 little bit quickly. 3 i want to begin, if i could, please, by 4 thanking you, like everyone else, on behalf of 5 ms. ellis. so let us get after it. 6 i want to start also by talking a little bit 7 about the things where mr. persons just left off 8 because one of the things he asked you, and we will 9 be showing some of these, and when you look at them 10 and see the remarks stretched across "for exchange 11 purposes only," that is perfectly fine, we traded 12 things before we got started, but that is what they 13 showed you just a few moment ago. 14 and the question that you were asked was in 15 this slide "should rjr be punished?" and i submit 16 to you that this defendant in this case, standing 17 toe to toe for decades with its co-conspirators, 18 what it wants is credit in this lawsuit about sonny 19 ellis, that is what he told you, for things that 20 have nothing to do with them. 21 because cigarettes have carried warning 22 labels, as you heard from robert heimann, the 23 former chairman of american tobacco, only because 24 congress made them do it. and they want credit for 25 that and to escape punishment for that. 3317 1 you have been told that they have reported their 2 ingredients. and you will recall from the testimony 3 of dr. cummings, that is since 1985, but only 4 because they were forced by law to do so. 5 and it was just suggested to you that the 6 information that is available today for cigarettes 7 since 1985, because congress has made them post 8 these long lists of ingredients that are not 9 specific to cigarettes, you can get that today if 10 you go on their website, but is it like when you 11 open your carton of eggs where it tells you what 12 the cholesterol is? it is not like that. 13 and yet they want credit to suggest to you 14 that they are just like the beer companies who even 15 now in our more enlightened era will tell you to 16 drink responsibly, will suggest to you to have a 17 designated driver. 18 where was the television ad, where was the 19 print ad, where was the anything from this company 20 or any of its co-conspirators for a period of four 21 decades providing that same kind of information? 22 because mr. persons says to you "we do not listen to 23 the manufacturer to know anything about our 24 product. we listen to everybody else." 25 i submit to you that, yes, of course it is true 3318 1 that we care what our loved ones tell us, but 2 sometimes when people are addicted to a highly 3 addictive drug, the messages from others, and i'm 4 pointing to counsel? no, i'm pointing to r.j. 5 reynolds. the message from others interferes. 6 so what do we know? we know also that the 7 posting on their website that they want credit for 8 has only been in the last several years and after 9 mr. ellis died. they want credit for that. 10 "reynolds has disputed -- not disputed the dangers 11 or addictiveness of tobacco for more than a 12 decade." we will give them credit for 1999 because 13 that is when it happened, 15 years ago. they want 14 credit for something that happened in this case 15 after mr. ellis died. 16 "punitive damages are not necessary," this is 17 very important, "to prevent reynolds from 18 concealing the dangers of tobacco." i've written 19 "says who?" where is the evidence in this case, in 20 this trial, that they are doing anything today to 21 help contribute to those matters? they brought 22 you, as mr. gustafson likes to say, nothing. 23 you heard a little bit about premier and 24 eclipse, these cigarettes that if you wander the 25 streets of tallahassee, everywhere where cigarettes 3319 1 can be bought, for days, you would not be able to 2 find one. they want credit for selling a cigarette 3 product that supposedly is healthier, that no one 4 can buy. 5 but this last one is very important for 6 another reason, because, as you have heard from the 7 court, and you already have heard -- had these read 8 to you, this is the law, these are the things that 9 you are obliged to consider as the principle of law 10 when you decide your verdict whether or not they 11 deserve to be punished in this case. 12 and if you go back to what i just showed you, 13 they say do not punish us because you do not have to 14 do anything to prevent reynolds from concealing the 15 dangers of tobacco? 16 well, you know what, the instruction actually 17 says that your award, excuse me, verdict, if you 18 award punitive damages, if you find them to be 19 deserving by the -- by clear and convincing 20 evidence, that that is for punishment to reynolds 21 for what they have already done and as a deterrent 22 not to reynolds, but to others. 23 so the suggestion, just to get started on 24 this, that they do not need to be assessed punitive 25 damages because they do not need to be prevented 3320 1 from doing anything, that is not the law in this 2 case, that will not be part of the instructions. more 3 on that in a few moments. 4 finishing also, starting, rather, where 5 mr. persons sort of finished in this, the wind-up 6 to the punitive damage argument was, before he 7 started talking about them, you know, what we did 8 was stupid. 9 we would submit to you that there is nothing 10 stupid about the evidence in this case. the 11 documents that you were shown in the plaintiff's 12 case reveal calculated, coldness, design, and every 13 effort possible not only to hide the addictive 14 effects of nicotine, which remained disputed in the 15 public eye at least until 1988, long after you just 16 heard it was too late for mr. ellis, not only for 17 those purposes, but also meanwhile, 20 million 18 souls perished from this product. 19 you are told it was stupid when they wrote in 20 their own documents that this is what we are all 21 about, we have got to protect our turf, we have got to 22 figure out a way to keep people from quitting and 23 get more people to start, hook young people and 24 keep them smoking. and you are told that that was 25 stupid. 3321 1 well, in fact, the evidence in this case, we 2 would submit to you, by clear and convincing 3 evidence, is that that was calculated and 4 purposeful. and i wrote some adjectives down that 5 i thought, most respectfully, fit what you have seen 6 in this case. outrageous, depraved, and greedy. 7 this was not stupid, conduct which resulted in 8 more than 400,000 people dying every year. 9 this is a slide that was provided. you know. 10 and one of the things about this quitting business, 11 those quitting statistics do not explain how many 12 people relapse. and you have heard that this is a 13 relapsing brain disease, addiction to nicotine. 14 so they want to count everybody in there who 15 quits, quits for a while, stays off cigarettes, the 16 way it is reported, goes back to smoking cigarettes, 17 quits for a while, goes back to smoking cigarettes, 18 quits for a while. 19 and some of those same quitters actually are 20 in those same 20 million people who died. and they 21 want credit for the people even though they did 22 nothing for a period of 50 years to help people 23 quit smoking, they want credit for that. 24 and, in fact, i would submit to you that that 25 would not fill doak that many times, but even if it 3322 1 did, you have, by clear and convincing evidence, 2 heard in this case, they brought you nothing, the 3 fact that 20 million people have perished as a 4 result of what they have done. that would fill the 5 same stadium 243 times. 6 now, before mr. persons started talking about 7 those matters, he was talking to you about the 8 issue of the fault allocations. 9 and one of the things you have heard, may not 10 remember it, you will hear it again or you will be able 11 to read it certainly with the jury instructions 12 that you have, is that the court, after your 13 verdict, if there is a verdict for the plaintiff, 14 will look at the percentages of fault and make 15 adjustments in the amount of the recovery that the 16 plaintiff makes in accordance with the law that is 17 applicable to each claim. 18 we are not allowed to discuss that with you 19 right now, but that is part of your instruction. 20 the court: sidebar. 21 mr. persons: thank you. 22 the court: you are not allowed to discuss it. 23 you should not be discussing it. 24 mr. sales: it is in the instruction, your 25 honor. 3323 1 the court: let us go sidebar. 2 (the following is at the bench.) 3 mr. sales: that was my intent. yeah, right 4 here, judge. 5 the court: just a second. 6 that does not say "adjust" anywhere. 7 mr. persons: no. 8 mr. sales: is that the word i used? 9 the court: yes. you said "i will adjust." 10 i'm going to instruct the jury not to consider 11 that. 12 mr. sales: and i'll correct it afterwards, 13 enter a judgment. 14 the court: that is what we spent an hour on 15 last night making sure we did not convey. 16 mr. sales: i'm going to put that right up on 17 the board so everybody can see it, judge. 18 the court: okay. 19 (in open court.) 20 mr. sales: i'm going to put the -- 21 the court: wait, wait. 22 mr. sales: i'm going to put the exact 23 language up there. 24 the court: hold on a second. 25 mr. sales: sorry. 3324 1 the court: so the objection is sustained. 2 you are instructed to disregard that last remark 3 about what i'm going to do after the trial. i'm 4 going to read you what the law is. 5 "in determining the total amount of damages, 6 you should not make any reduction because of the 7 comparative fault of clarence c. ellis. the court 8 will enter a judgment based on your verdict and the 9 law applicable to each claim." period. that is it. 10 disregard, do not consider any other comment other 11 than that on that topic. 12 you may proceed. 13 mr. sales: thank you, your honor. and for 14 the record, that instruction that the court just 15 read is displayed in front of you now and i want to 16 repeat that. "the court will enter a judgment 17 based upon your verdict and the law applicable to 18 each claim." and that relates to the issue of the 19 comparative fault allocations that are on the 20 verdict form. 21 so counsel discussed with you all, and they 22 had this sort of metered thing going up and down. 23 and we would just indicate to you that when those 24 matters are considered, when the comparative fault 25 allocation is made by you in assigning percentages, 3325 1 that there are other matters -- 2 mr. persons: objection, your honor. may 3 we -- 4 the court: let us go sidebar. 5 (the following is at the bench.) 6 the court: you are very, very close to 7 getting a mistrial. 8 mr. persons: yes. 9 mr. sales: what is the issue, judge? 10 mr. persons: the grounds for the objection is 11 that those things have to be tied to a legal cause 12 of the death of mr. ellis. and what i'm hearing is 13 an argument on punitive damages. it is as though 14 you are assuming that they have checked yes on 15 entitlement, and you are going into a punitive 16 damages counterpart. 17 the court: here is what i took, that we were 18 on the verge of talking about adjusting anything. 19 we are not going to talk about adjusting damages. 20 so i'm going to -- i'm going to give you-all 21 latitude in arguing. i'm going to overrule 22 mr. persons' at this time on that point. 23 just be very, very careful about any 24 indication that anything is going to be adjusted. 25 we do not know what i'm going to do. 3326 1 mr. sales: may i just make a brief record? i 2 was referring to counsel's slide 104, which is the 3 comparative fault allegations, i was not discussing 4 any adjustment of a judgment. 5 the court: i know, but i was concerned that is 6 where we were headed. 7 mr. sales: no, your honor. 8 the court: okay. 9 mr. sales: your honor, may i put this back up 10 and continue this comparative fault. 11 the court: yes, you may. 12 mr. sales: thank you. 13 (in open court.) 14 the court: all right, the objection is 15 overruled. you may proceed under the guidelines 16 that i indicated. 17 mr. sales: yes, your honor. thank you. 18 members of the jury, when you go to consider 19 the issue of comparative fault, my suggestion to 20 you is that there are more things to consider than 21 that were on the slide that was shown to you by 22 counsel. 23 among the things to consider are the things 24 that you heard about in this case, the way in which 25 the design of cigarettes affects smoking behavior, 3327 1 the way in which cigarettes are engineered, and 2 importantly, from the perspective of the plaintiff, 3 the motivations behind the defendant's conduct and 4 that of their co-conspirators with respect to 5 addicting smokers and causing their death. 6 you have been told that if you find for the 7 plaintiff on the issue of class membership, that 8 you will be bound by the engle findings. i think 9 everyone recalls that. one of those findings, if 10 you recall from the instructions, are that, let me 11 make sure i get it right, "if you find for the 12 plaintiff on the issue of class membership that 13 cigarettes produced by r.j. reynolds were defective 14 and unreasonably dangerous." 15 and counsel indicated that there was nothing 16 r.j. reynolds could have done that would have 17 prevented mr. ellis's death. that is what was 18 argued to you. 19 well, we would submit to you that there are 20 choices in this case on the part of the plaintiff, 21 which has been argued extensively by mr. persons, 22 but there were also choices on the part of the 23 manufacturer. you have heard evidence in this case 24 that going back very early in the 20th century that 25 all of the major manufacturers of tobacco products 3328 1 had the ability to remove nicotine. and you have 2 also heard evidence that they did not do it because 3 it would have impaired their ability to sell 4 tobacco products. 5 but clearly the evidence in this case is that 6 it was within the power of r.j. reynolds tobacco 7 company to make cigarettes that are not defective 8 and unreasonably dangerous. and, in fact, 9 mr. persons concluded his argument by suggesting to 10 you that r.j. reynolds has done just that with its 11 products premier and eclipse. 12 the argument of the defense counsel as i was 13 listening to it occurred to me to sort of be 14 divided into four parts. there was a part of it 15 that talked about mr. ellis's addiction, but before 16 that, the first part, counsel indicated that 17 everybody knew that cigarettes were addictive all 18 this time, despite what the evidence has shown with 19 respect to what they and their co-conspirators 20 concealed from the public. 21 so there were two parts to this. there was a 22 part that suggested that mr. ellis knew all along, 23 but even if he knew, he was not addicted. and there 24 was a part of it that suggested, argued directly, 25 in fact, that mr. ellis did not have lung cancer, 3329 1 primary lung cancer, bronchogenic cancer, whatever 2 we are going to call it because we know that those 3 things are all the same as dr. okun explained to us 4 yesterday. 5 so there were two parts to that as well. one, 6 there is no proof that cancer was caused in this 7 case, but even if there was, it was all mr. ellis's 8 fault because he knew that that could happen all 9 along. 10 i'm going to talk in a few minutes about how 11 it was that the defendants were able to do what 12 they did not only in relation to the public and all 13 those people who suffered as a result of what the 14 defendant and its co-conspirators did, but i want 15 to suggest to you for a moment that we go right 16 back to the beginning of counsel's argument and 17 talk about what he said the case was about, which 18 was mr. ellis and lucky strike cigarettes. 19 can you switch over? 20 the picture with the lucky strike and 21 mr. ellis. sorry. 22 there may be some others in evidence, i'm not 23 quite sure about that, that actually show mr. ellis 24 with his lucky strike cigarettes, but this one 25 clearly does. and you will recall that there was 3330 1 some testimony in the case, i think it was from 2 dr. jaffe, about this period of time and assessment 3 of even then whether mr. ellis was addicted to 4 nicotine. so here is a picture of mr. ellis at the 5 end of his life suffering from lung cancer. that is 6 the plaintiff's position, certainly. 7 and you can take that down. 8 so from the notes that i took, in thinking 9 about that photograph, this is what i wrote with 10 respect to the defense argument in the case if one 11 were, during mr. ellis's life, trying to explain 12 the defense position, this is what might be 13 explained to mr. ellis. 14 if you did have cancer in your lung, r.j. 15 reynolds is not going to say that it started there, 16 so it was not lung cancer. if it was lung cancer, 17 it was caused by smoking. but if it was caused by 18 smoking, it was not because you, mr. ellis, were 19 addicted to nicotine. 20 but if you were addicted to nicotine, it is 21 still all your fault because you chose to smoke, 22 you failed to quit using our products, exactly the 23 way we wanted you to, lighting them, smoking them, 24 and inhaling the smoke. 25 and there was very little said about the 3331 1 things that r.j. reynolds actually did in this case 2 in closing by the defense, but the comments might 3 continue that it is true that we lied, but you 4 should have known better, and you should have not 5 believed anything that was put out by us or any of 6 the tobacco companies, tobacco institute. 7 but even if you did believe those things, even 8 if you were putting them on the refrigerator 9 because you were really sincerely, which was 10 consistent with your character, trying to 11 demonstrate your belief to your friends and family 12 who were trying to help you, you should have tried 13 harder to quit. 14 but even if you did try and quit, and the 15 evidence in this case is that there were at least 16 10 to 15 quit attempts, and we believe that, 17 counsel just said, he believes, unlike dr. jaffe, 18 that those quit attempts actually took place, that 19 mr. ellis -- it would not have mattered because you 20 smoked, smoked, smoked our cigarettes until you 21 were dead. 22 and i would submit to you that that is actually 23 what the defense case is here. and one of the ways 24 it is demonstrated in a trial with the development 25 of all the technology, it is of great benefit, one 3332 1 of the things the court instructed you on before we 2 started with closing arguments, was a reminder that 3 what the lawyers say is not evidence. 4 so when the lawyers, and they do it together, 5 we all do it, get together with the witnesses, put 6 together these slides, it is the lawyers' 7 perspective as to what the case has been all about. 8 and i mention that to you because we had a 9 witness in the case who -- 10 will you switch back, please? 11 -- who said something, it was dr. jaffe, and 12 you may remember that he was talking about in 13 redirect from mr. kreiner, as we went over with him 14 quite a bit about some of the things that were 15 different from the long summaries of the testimony 16 that he gave. he talked about the part that he 17 wanted to talk about, and he did so extensively. 18 and then we showed some of the things that 19 did not fit with what he was saying. and when mr. 20 kreiner asked him some questions about that on 21 redirect, what he told you, members of the jury, is 22 that "my job is to resolve the discrepancies, and 23 that is what i did." 24 and i would submit to you, members of the 25 jury, that the instructions that you are going to 3333 1 get are actually a little bit different. as his 2 honor has told you, i've got this underlined, that 3 was part of what you heard already "i am now," the 4 court speaking, "going to tell you about the rules 5 of law that you must use in reaching your verdict." 6 one of them is what the lawyers say is not 7 evidence. 8 but also, there was not any instruction in 9 there to suggest to you that the experts tell you 10 the way that it is. in fact, contrary to what 11 dr. jaffe says, some of those things are your 12 decision. "you decide the issues that are 13 submitted for your determination." 14 and then the court told you what the evidence 15 in the case is. and then the court told you one of 16 the ways in which you do that. you measure 17 people's believability. counsel mentioned some of 18 those things. the demeanor. the frankness. the 19 intelligence. interests they may have in the 20 outcome. the means and opportunity the witness had 21 to know the facts about which the witness 22 testified. the ability of the witness to remember. 23 and the reasonableness of what they have to say in 24 light of your own -- i think it says common sense 25 and experience. 3334 1 and then below that, it says for experts, you 2 can accept or reject that. and that is up to you. 3 so when you are in a case where you have two 4 types of testimony, one type of testimony is sworn 5 testimony from folks who were there, and one type 6 of testimony is testimony from people who are 7 summarizing all of that, counsel just mentioned 8 that, we would suggest to you that if it is a 9 question about evaluating all of the evidence, the 10 evidence that is submitted for your consideration, 11 that you should rely on your recollection best of 12 what the witnesses said and not what witnesses who 13 came into court said that they said. 14 one more point about that. and your honor, 15 respectfully, that is also an instruction that was 16 given earlier in the case, because some of the 17 testimony that you heard was in the form of 18 depositions. 19 and as the court indicated at that time, "the 20 deposition testimony is sworn testimony of a 21 witness that is given before trial, and that is going 22 to be read to you. 23 and you should consider and weigh this 24 testimony -- deposition testimony as you would any 25 other evidence in the case. it is as if that person 3335 1 is actually here, but you are going to hear the 2 sworn testimony read to you by the parties." 3 and so as you have heard, in advance of trial, 4 one of the things that we all do is get together 5 and lawyers, sometimes they are subpoenaed, 6 sometimes they show up, and sworn statements, 7 depositions, you have seen these transcripts, the 8 lawyers use to help the witnesses or sometimes 9 challenge them, that is the record in the case. 10 and when those depositions have been read to 11 you, they are to be considered by you as though the 12 witnesses had come live. 13 now, a couple more things about dr. jaffe, 14 because as you remember, we were sort of, i guess, 15 criticized or mocked for going through all the 16 things that people who knew mr. ellis, that they 17 swore to before trial, had said before trial and 18 revealing those instances in which they did not fit 19 with what dr. jaffe had to say. 20 and his answer to that was, as you just heard 21 on redirect, "i resolved the discrepancies." no, 22 sir. members of the jury, that is up to you. 23 so what do you do when you get some of these 24 things that do not fit in the case? because i want 25 to stay, if i can, and pick just a little bit more 3336 1 on dr. jaffe. mr. persons told you about how he 2 was the -- you know, the only person with substance 3 abuse training, and he is the witness that you ought 4 to rely upon most when you get to that very first 5 and essential question in the case about addiction, 6 was mr. ellis addicted, we are going to talk a 7 little bit more about that. 8 and he kind of cast aspersions on the 9 fagerstrom test, and you have just heard about it 10 again in closing argument by counsel for r.j. 11 reynolds. 12 well, what do we know about that? it was not 13 discussed during the trial, but mr. gustafson 14 mentioned this to you. 15 i do not remember the exhibit number, it is 16 ans-00 -- 17 mr. gustafson: 1324-a. 18 mr. sales: -- 1324. and this is in evidence. 19 that is one of those documents that the court 20 instructed you when you go back to deliberate 21 you are going to get a chance to look at. 22 mr. gustafson mentioned it briefly, but since 23 counsel mentioned the fagerstrom test, i would like 24 to talk about it a little bit more. 25 and what it is, is a document that describes a 3337 1 program to figure out if another product of r.j. 2 reynolds, which is called snus, that is an oral 3 tobacco, a pouch you put under your tongue, is 4 helpful in clinical trials and can they use it 5 possibly as a product as a means to move people 6 from oral tobacco -- excuse me, from smoking to 7 oral tobaccos. 8 and so one of the things that they did is they 9 had 600 people in this study. and the issue in the 10 case for them was whether or not there was nicotine 11 dependence. and you know from dr. jaffe and all 12 the other witnesses -- well, for everybody prior to 13 nine months ago, dependence and addiction meant the 14 same thing. for dr. jaffe and i guess some 15 psychologists now, they are two different things. 16 but anyway, for the purposes of this study, 17 and you had to be male or female, 21 to 65, and the 18 protocol in the study, it was not to use the dsm-iv, 19 which would have existed five years ago, still 20 exists, it was to use the ftnd cigarette. and if 21 you look further in the document, you figure out 22 what that means, because they tell you. 23 in order to assess dependence, they measure it 24 for their own study internally, not with one of 25 these, that one or this one, they use it, the same 3338 1 one, as one of the ones this guy talked about. 2 oh, and by the way, and just going back to 3 what we were talking about a few minutes ago, we are 4 talking about, you know, use your own memory of 5 what the testimony is and that the slides are not 6 actually the evidence? you see how it looks like 7 this comes from this transcript? 8 the question's in there, "now he never -- your 9 husband, mr. brown, just so i'm clear, mr. brown 10 never said anything to you about any specific 11 cigarette." 12 this is from -- and i'm not fussing with 13 counsel over it, but this particular transcript 14 that you were shown obviously has nothing to do 15 with the testimony that was described to you. and 16 that is one of those instances where you-all need to 17 rely on your recollection about whether or not the 18 witnesses have said what is represented in the 19 closing arguments of the lawyers. 20 but anyway, getting back to this thing, what 21 do we know? we talk about the fagerstrom score and 22 the impacts of it. and what they did was they used 23 the same questions that you saw dr. cummings go 24 over and mr. gustafson mentioned and mr. persons 25 mentioned. 3339 1 and that is the test that r.j. reynolds, they 2 do not invite dr. jaffe, they do not invite 3 psychologists or psychiatrists who are using these 4 things, they do what people, real scientists do in 5 the real world when they want to find out if 6 tobacco products are addictive and how people get 7 off of them, that is what they use. 8 so that is one of those instances in which, 9 yeah, it is true that there is a discrepancy in the 10 evidence, and you-all have to make a decision. 11 does it matter what r.j. reynolds says and does 12 outside the context of the courtroom? and we 13 submit that it does. we submit that it is a 14 verification of the reliability of this. 15 and these measures are not the touchy, feely 16 things that dr. jaffe talked about. these are 17 facts. and you know what, because mr. ellis is not 18 with us, we cannot even ask him about two of these 19 questions. 20 these are objective facts, and what did they 21 bring you, as mr. gustafson would say? they 22 brought you nothing to challenge any of these 23 things. it does not involve those things that they 24 say are in dispute. 25 and so what the folks participating in r.j. 3340 1 reynolds' studies would hear when they are being 2 assessed to see if they are a good candidate to go 3 to another moneymaking product for r.j. reynolds, 4 they would say if they had an 8 like sonny ellis, 5 "your level of dependence is high. you are not in 6 control of your smoking, it is in control of you. 7 when you make the decision to quit, you may want to 8 talk with your doctor about nicotine replacement 9 therapy or other medications." 10 and that is one of those discrepancies in the 11 evidence, that is one of those disputed issues of 12 fact which we suggest that you should resolve in 13 favor of the plaintiff, because that is a very 14 reliable test that you-all do not need help with to 15 do that. 16 talk a little bit about these, though. and 17 certainly, if i contributed to making this 18 confusing, i apologize to everyone, but i think 19 just to review this very briefly, this dsm-iv, they 20 used to use that, and it was a measure for nicotine 21 dependence, and it was a measure of nicotine 22 dependence that psychologists and psychiatrists, 23 according to dr. jaffe, used and he used in 24 lawsuits until nine months ago. it is a synonym for 25 addiction. 3341 1 this (indicating) is a measure of what he 2 calls, the book calls tobacco use disorder. it is 3 not a measure of addiction or dependence. and do 4 you recall his testimony, which was "i know it says 5 you need two, but you really need six to work up to 6 addiction, because without that, it is not severe." 7 and one of the explanations for that was, you 8 know, addiction changes. science changes. and i 9 want to be up to date and keep up with things. and 10 certainly that is true. 11 but what you know from mr. gustafson's 12 presentation is that the thing, contrary to what 13 dr. jaffe tells us that is changed the most is what 14 we know about what they do, and that is why the 15 content of public health messages today, like that 16 2010 booklet that tells you that they used design 17 features, they may be using those to hijack the 18 brains and bodies of smokers, that is what is 19 changed. human bodies have not changed. brains 20 have not changed. 21 and in the last nine months, i would submit to 22 you that there is not anything different about 23 whether or not someone is or is not addicted to 24 nicotine. and certainly just five years ago, 25 reynolds thinks fagerstrom is the way to go. 3342 1 but i do want to spend just a minute talking 2 to you about that, because one of the interesting 3 things about this is that, you know, if you went 4 with the old book, and this is interesting, you 5 only needed three to be addicted or dependent. 6 now, they have this little thing they do with 7 the "as manifested by." remember what dr. jaffe 8 told you, you know, we can all read some of these 9 things. and i would submit to you that some of 10 these things do not require a phd in psychology. 11 mr. persons: your honor, may we approach? 12 the court: okay. 13 (the following is at the bench.) 14 mr. guest: your honor, the objection is 15 dsm-iv is not in evidence and he is showing a 16 document that is not in evidence. 17 the court: i actually thought about that, but 18 i believe that page was displayed to the jury, i 19 recall -- 20 mr. persons: i could not recall. 21 the court: i recall seeing it. so i'm going 22 to overrule. it is not in evidence, but i do recall 23 seeing that page displayed -- 24 mr. sales: right. 25 the court: -- to the jury when 3343 1 cross-examining dr. jaffe. 2 mr. sales: right. i used it. 3 mr. gustafson: i have a question. do we get 4 charged for the sidebars on our time? 5 the court: i charged him on his time, yeah. 6 mr. gustafson: i was not sure what the court 7 was doing, that is all i was asking. he has got 8 about 20 minutes left, 30 minutes. 9 the court: 72 minutes and it started i think 10 at 3:31 so that is 60 minutes so you have 12 past 11 that. 12 mr. sales: 20, 25, like that? 13 the court: yeah. now, again, it is up to 14 y'all whether you want to use it. 15 mr. sales: i need to keep zipping. i'm ready 16 to go. 17 the court: this is y'all. i'm not going to 18 require you to use it, but if you want to use it, 19 you have got it. okay? 20 (in open court.) 21 mr. sales: all right. and this would have 22 been equivalent with the diagnosis of addiction. 23 and this language "as manifested by." 24 now, they tell you that you do not even get to 25 these criteria unless someone already is getting 3344 1 fired or breaking up with their wife or not being 2 able to go to every event or something like that. 3 but actually, those are the things that define 4 whether or not there is a clinically-significant 5 impairment. i would submit to you that as 6 manifested by three or more of the following 7 occurring within a 12-month period is if any -- 8 three or more of those are there, that means you are 9 dependent. that means you are addicted. 10 and you could go over those, because 1(b) he 11 gave the plaintiff, tolerance, and there is a 12 suggestion, mr. ellis never had withdrawal. i 13 would submit to you you know that that is not so 14 because when he got up in the morning, he chain 15 smoked. that was undisputed evidence. 16 he needed to fill his brain, as mr. gustafson 17 explained. often taken in larger amounts or over a 18 longer period of time than was intended. 19 dr. jaffe's thing on that is he never reported it 20 so we do not know. i submit to use your common 21 sense on that. 22 does anybody who does this to themselves, 23 because they are addicted and because they believe 24 the lies of this defendant and its co-conspirators 25 start out smoking two to three packs a day? nobody 3345 1 does. 2 a great deal of time chain smoking. he says 3 that ain't chain smoking because he did not do it 4 all day. mr. gustafson has disputed and explained 5 that. 6 and then 6, it is important things like social, 7 occupational, rec, that are given up or reduced. 8 so you know from the portion of tammy ellis's 9 deposition that was read to dr. jaffe yesterday, 10 confronted him with it that it was not a one-time 11 thing, it was every time they went out he had those 12 problems. 13 so those are just the ones that are 14 self-evident in this record, one, two, three, four, 15 five. even if you use this psychologist's text or 16 book, that is what you get. but you know what, 17 because they say that this is a mental disorder and 18 this is another thing that i asked dr. jaffe about 19 nicotine dependence used to be addiction -- 20 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 21 mr. sales: that was displayed to the jury, 22 your honor. 23 the court: was this page displayed -- 24 mr. sales: this very page was and questions 25 were asked of dr. jaffe on it. 3346 1 the court: hold on. is that the basis of the 2 objection? 3 mr. persons: yes, your honor. 4 the court: i'm going to take counsel at his 5 word that it was displayed to the jury, and it will 6 be up to the jury to make a determination as to 7 whether they recall actually seeing this. 8 mr. persons: all right, sir. 9 the court: okay. 10 mr. sales: because they say that our case is 11 subjective. well, certain things in the dsm, even 12 if you get past the touchy, feely part of it, 13 they are not subjective, they are objective just 14 like -- remember that stuff about facts and 15 opinions? facts, physical exams, and doctors did 16 that in this case. 17 nobody is saying that he did not have tobacco 18 odor. he and his family complained about it. 19 there is evidence of cough. they say it is not 20 enough. you rely on your memory about that. 21 evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 22 well, he had it. it appears that he did not 23 know that he had it, but he had it. and it is 24 documented, no dispute about it. and it was caused 25 by smoking. tobacco stains on finger, that is rare, 3347 1 but he had that too. 2 so we submit to you no matter what measure 3 that you use, plaintiff has proved addiction. 4 let us talk a little bit about lung cancer. 5 because their position in this case is it is not 6 proven, and that this entire medical community, i 7 do not know how many physicians it is, but it is lots 8 of them, that every single one of them who saw this 9 guy, mr. ellis, got it wrong, that their language 10 is imprecise -- 11 mr. persons: objection, your honor, not 12 supported by the evidence. 13 mr. sales: that is what dr. jaffe said and 14 dr. okun said, they were wrong. 15 the court: dr. okun said that dr. bilek was 16 correct. 17 mr. sales: oh. 18 the court: so i think that is not totally 19 accurate. 20 mr. sales: okay. we are going to clear that 21 up right now. 22 it is true dr. okun said dr. bilek was wrong 23 some of the time and right some of the time. more 24 on that in a moment. 25 but i would like to urge you, and, you know, 3348 1 i'm famous for being a poor artist, and i apologize 2 to ms. ellis for suggesting that that is a 3 representation of her husband. let us think about 4 this a little bit. because what we know in this 5 case and you are urged in the jury instructions to 6 use your common sense about whether or not this man 7 had lung cancer. 8 and even dr. okun admits that a primary lesion 9 found in the lung is atypical for metastasis, that 10 means coming from somewhere else, that would be 11 unusual, all right? and he also told us that there 12 was cancer in the head, skull, brain, orbit, also 13 the scalp, he also told us that it was in the 14 thoracic spine in many places, it was in the 15 shoulder, and it was in the lung. 16 he told us that it cannot go from the head to 17 the lung. it cannot go from the t spine to the 18 lung. it cannot go from the shoulder to the lung, 19 but it can go from the lung to the shoulder, the 20 lung to the t spine and from the lung to the -- 21 the court: you are talking so fast i'm not 22 sure the court reporter is getting this down. i'm 23 trying to follow the real time. 24 are you doing okay? 25 the court reporter: yes, sir. 3349 1 the court: okay. 2 mr. sales: and we heard from dr. mccoy, he 3 said i did everything. i did the blood work, i 4 ordered the scans, this man's entire body, not 5 including his arms and legs, i guess, the skin. 6 and we know all those places that dr. okun said the 7 cancer could have come from, the genitals, the 8 bladder, the other places in the abdomen, the 9 stomach, the colon, all of those were scanned. and 10 so their answer to that is, well, you know, cancer 11 can be so small when it starts that you might have 12 missed it. 13 and by the way, and this is a trick, i would 14 submit to you, we did not have the technology that 15 we now have to have provided us with the 16 information that we need to make this diagnosis. 17 so we would submit to you that there is no question 18 about it. 19 and do you remember that dr. bilek was asked, 20 you know, what is the last record that dr. -- 21 excuse me, dr. okun was asked what is the last 22 record that has information from dr. bilek? and 23 when you go back and look at the medical records, 24 see if you cannot identify the signatures, see if 25 you cannot identify the handwriting. 3350 1 and what does he call it as late as february 2 of 1993, ca lung. and you know from the 3 examination that we did of dr. okun what that 4 means. 5 more evidence. dr. bilek ordered on january 6 29th, 1993, a test. he ordered a test that was a 7 ct scan of the brain and the orbits. and it was 8 reviewed by the radiologist, dr. ostrov. 9 so dr. ostrov gets an order from dr. bilek to 10 clear all this up about the stuff that was in the 11 middle when he was putting a question mark by 12 things, because the last two records that we have 13 from this man, what do they tell us? he orders the 14 test from dr. ostrov who reviews it and tells us 15 "history of cancer of the lung with a known mass in 16 the region of the left orbit." 17 and if this were not enough, dr. bilek, why did 18 he say that? because earlier, he knew this, he 19 knew that it was a primary -- excuse me, 20 biopsy-proven bronchogenic carcinoma of the left 21 lung. the greater weight of the evidence on that 22 matter should be clear. 23 i want to talk a little bit about whether or 24 not these matters made a difference. and when i 25 discuss those things with you, i want you to 3351 1 remember something, which is that these matters 2 were not matters of stupidity for the defense, which 3 was the suggestion and final argument by 4 mr. persons. 5 these were not the matters of stupidity. these 6 were matters of design, not only the product and 7 hijacking the brains and bodies of smokers, but 8 also in the way in which they communicated with the 9 public. 10 one of the things that is in evidence, because 11 it reflects something from the time, what people 12 back then believed, what smokers believed and 13 nonsmokers believed, we reviewed it extensively, is 14 chapter 3 of the 1981 ftc report, there is chapter 15 2 and there is chapter 3, this is from chapter 2, 16 which relates to advertising. 17 chapter 3 relates to public attitudes and 18 knowledge and information about smoking and the 19 health risks of smoking. and what it tells you is 20 that a majority of smokers did not know that 21 cigarettes were addictive. more on that in a 22 moment. 23 and what it also tells you about advertising 24 is that they were outspending the public health 25 community by i guess about more than 300 to 1, or 3352 1 at least the government, in trying to get out some 2 of these messages that you have seen. 3 well, how did they do it? 4 you know, for every one of those articles, and 5 they are all in evidence, you can take a look at 6 them from the moultrie observer, there are 7 highlighted quotes here, but mr. gustafson showed 8 some of them to you previously when he put 9 dr. burns on, it was over and over and over again 10 and it was all with an eye toward this. 11 remember who this was from? this was from 12 george weissman to the head of -- mr. cullman. 13 he is that same guy who went on meet the press or 14 one of those sunday shows, i think it was meet the 15 press, and said it is not been proven, and by the 16 way, people like smaller babies, suggesting that 17 even the most vulnerable of the population are not 18 harmed by cigarette smoke, do not worry about it, 19 everybody? 20 why were they doing those things? they were 21 doing it because smokers needed to believe. it is 22 never been the position of the plaintiff in this 23 case that people did not know that cigarettes could 24 cause disease. 25 if you remember back to the forwarding memo 3353 1 back in 1953, the industry was not trying to 2 persuade people that cigarettes did not cause 3 disease, they were just trying to give them enough 4 doubt to pick up the next cigarette. 5 and, in fact, they told you things like, 6 through their own words, that "what is truth to one 7 is false to another." they told you, and this is 8 in evidence, that "doubt was their real product." 9 they told you, and these are all in evidence, that 10 their position was that they could be subject to a 11 finding that they were making false statements. 12 you saw documents relating to the lawyers. 13 you heard about how the lawyers controlled the 14 messages. you heard about how the lawyers were 15 responsible for the 6,000 articles. they brought 16 you one. and if you go to the end of it, 1963, it 17 confirms the plaintiff's case that smokers are true 18 addicts. out of 6,000 pieces of science, one 19 apparently escaped the review and the attention of 20 the lawyers sufficient that it could be brought to 21 you in this case to suggest that they were never 22 really lying about it. 23 and, you know, we showed you documents that 24 reflected that they predicted in monetary terms how 25 much money they would have to spend to counter the 3354 1 public health messages about the risks of smoking. 2 and how were they doing, how did they do it? 3 you know, in this day and time it seems almost 4 quaint and difficult to believe that someone could 5 pull this off. and yet here we have a case, and we 6 know, because if counsel's position and r.j. 7 reynolds' position about this case is true, all of 8 these people who continued to smoke were just 9 smoke, smoke, smoking themselves to death. 10 so in this day and age, like counsel himself 11 said, with the internet and everything else, it 12 seems a little bit difficult to believe, okay? 13 they put out all this scientific work. this was 14 the real product of ctr and all of those projects. 15 they reported that there was progress, that 16 the statistics did not prove it, that papers 17 challenged lung cancer, that your constitution was 18 the issue, that the mobile home -- risk among 19 mobile people and white collar workers was higher. 20 they had books that they published. 21 they did animal studies. they talk -- they 22 told people it was viruses. they told people it 23 was whether or not you were extroverted or 24 introverted. they told people it had to do with 25 whether you were married, if that is not ironic in 3355 1 this case. 2 as we told you in opening statement these are 3 all in evidence. they told people it had something 4 to do with whether people were bald or not. and 5 this one. 6 you know, it may seem incredible to believe, 7 but in 19 -- in the 1960s, they were telling people 8 that it was not only a issue of personality but 9 these things always were coming from britain, you 10 can look in there, some foreign country, you know 11 what, "carcinogens do not cause lung cancer." 12 now, it may seem, you know, somewhat 13 preposterous to suggest to you that these things 14 matter. that here we have an undisputed record 15 that sonny ellis was posting things on his 16 refrigerator into the 1990s and the parties in this 17 case to try to pull together these things and say, 18 well, he must have seen this, he must have seen 19 that, but what do we know? 20 and counsel himself just reminded you this was 21 a florida newspaperman. and remember something he 22 said about the fold of the paper? well, i guess 23 it is true that this is below the fold, but front 24 page news in 1979, on the cover of a florida paper, 25 it is true it was in gainesville, please do not hold 3356 1 that against the plaintiff, horace kornegay, former 2 congressman, he is front page news saying the 3 surgeon general is all wet. those kinds of 4 stories, these are in evidence, you can take a look 5 at them, continued well into the 1970s, the 1980s. 6 and by the way, it was not just company say-so. 7 mr. ellis was not the only person, this is in 8 evidence as well, who was reading about, thinking 9 about these things, and believing them. this is 10 from the orlando sentinel, in 1985. you will be able 11 to see that when you have it. it is an editorial on 12 the op ed page. 13 and this writer tells his readers, among other 14 things, "the claim that cigarette smoking causes 15 lung cancer is a good example. it may or may not, 16 but no scientific study has yet established a 17 causal relationship. the only thing researchers 18 have done is establish a correlation, association, 19 based on epidemiological studies, which are not 20 scientific experiments, but merely sociological 21 studies." 22 so when you get to that, and when you are told 23 in a case where you would have to be a fool, sonny 24 ellis would have had to have been a fool to believe 25 an industry that could outspend the government 365 3357 1 to 1 in trying to get its message and its word out 2 through the most devious of means, because that is 3 the defense in this case. 4 and, you know, we have not talked much about it 5 in rebuttal but i want to spend a little bit 6 talking about addiction, because what you will see 7 when you look at the instructions in the case, when 8 you get a chance to look at them again, the verdict 9 form too, there are two parts to this case. one 10 part is about the risks, the health risks of 11 smoking, and the other part is the part about the 12 addictiveness of nicotine. 13 and it was not just that the industry was 14 trying to create a controversy about whether or not 15 cigarettes caused disease just like this editorial 16 writer said even into the 1980s when according to 17 counsel it was already too late for mr. ellis, they 18 absolutely did not want people to believe that this 19 was an addictive drug. 20 and the undisputed evidence in this case in 21 that 1981 ftc study is that the majority of 22 americans did not think it was. 23 can you put up the horn slide, please? 24 your honor, are you going to cut me off right 25 at 4:30? 3358 1 the court: well, hold on a second. at 4:31 2 you will have 12 minutes left. 3 mr. sales: oh, sorry. 4 the court: so you have about 15 minutes, 5 approximately. 6 mr. sales: you may remember -- sorry, judge. 7 the court: that is all right. 8 mr. sales: you may remember that when 9 dr. burns was here and after counsel talked about 10 dr. daniel horn, he said, you know, those matters 11 really need to be put in context. he said when 12 we are talking about shouting from the rooftops, the 13 important part of the message was, you know, we are 14 trying to inform people, but something's missing. 15 do you have that slide about the cigarette 16 consumption? go back just a moment. 17 so in 1978, when, according to counsel, it was 18 already too late for mr. ellis, -- 19 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 20 the court: sustained. that is not actually 21 what he said. 22 mr. sales: according to counsel, dr. burns's 23 opinion suggests that by 1978, it was already too 24 late for mr. ellis -- 25 mr. persons: same objection. 3359 1 the court: sustained. that is not what he 2 said. the argument was if he had stopped smoking 3 by 1978, he would not -- he would have had a good 4 chance to survive. 5 mr. sales: well, let us just take a look -- 6 thank you, your honor, i'm sorry. thank you for 7 the correction. 8 in 1978, that is still relatively speaking at 9 the peak level of consumption in the country, and 10 it is consistent with, a hundred percent consistent 11 with that chapter 3 of the 1981 ftc report, and 12 it is only really after that point in time when 13 there is a steep decline in the rate of smoking in 14 this country. and what is the reason for that? 15 go back, if you would, please, to dr. horn. 16 "it is crucial for a person to know why he 17 smokes if he is to quit. if you do not have any 18 understanding of why you do it, the problem's more 19 serious." 20 in this case, in that declining consumption of 21 cigarettes is proof of that very fact. because 22 this was in 1965. and as you heard, dr. horn was a 23 leading public health official. it was not until 23 24 years later when dr. koop, who was the surgeon 25 general then, first issued the report that is in 3360 1 evidence indicating that nicotine is an addictive 2 drug. 3 and that, we suggest to you, is an important 4 part of understanding not only the decline in 5 consumption rapidly after that point in time, 6 because what do we know from the record in this 7 case that happened? 8 you have heard in the evidence in this case that 9 it was at that point in time and thereafter that 10 people, doctors, scientists, researchers, began to 11 address the issue of smoking as one of addiction. 12 and that meant the development of therapies that 13 had not existed during the overwhelming majority of 14 sonny ellis's lifetime. 15 but importantly, and it could not have been 16 said any better by the same fellow that you have seen 17 in slide after slide during this trial by dr. horn. 18 he was not saying why people are smoking. he was 19 saying it is important to understand why they do. 20 and in that respect, we would ask that when 21 you go back into the jury room, you take the 22 opportunity to review document after document after 23 document or at least on behalf of mrs. ellis some 24 of them. 25 dr. jaffe told you that smoking -- the 3361 1 nicotine in the smoke is not a big deal. that is 2 not right. it is the only thing that matters. 3 you have in evidence not only the 1988 surgeon 4 general's report, but this was mentioned yesterday, 5 but you have portions of the 2010 surgeon general's 6 report as well. and what they teach us is that 7 nicotine is the reason that people smoke. 8 not a plaintiff's lawyer, not a plaintiff's 9 expert, not a defense lawyer, not a defense expert. 10 a neutral scientist studying the consensus of all 11 the scientific evidence in the community. and what 12 they tell us, as you recall, i think it was raised 13 even yesterday in dr. jaffe's cross-examination, is 14 that nicotine is the reason that people smoke. 15 but there is more to it than that. because 16 when you get to the question of cause, the but-for 17 issue in this case, and i would ask you to consider 18 the question, the same question that mr. persons 19 asked you when he was asking you to compare 20 mr. ellis to all of those folks who quit, some of 21 whom quit over and over again, as i've suggested to 22 you, but i would ask you to compare mr. ellis to 23 some of those folks who did not, some of those folks 24 who continued to smoke in those decades prior to 25 1988, and with the other curve that you saw from 3362 1 lung cancer, how many of them passed away. 2 and why do we ask you to do it that way? 3 because, members of the jury, just as the industry 4 acknowledged and mr. gustafson touched on some of 5 that, i'm not going to repeat these points, they 6 believed what they were doing worked. 7 is there any party, is there anybody, is there 8 a major corporation that spends untold millions of 9 dollars outspending the united states government in 10 the way that they did, even with the urgency of the 11 lung cancer epidemic, is there any party that 12 spends that kind of money for no reason at all, and 13 the executives for american tobacco, predecessor to 14 r.j. reynolds, r.j. reynolds, they told you the 15 answer to that, and the answer is no. 16 so when you get to the issue of causation on 17 the fraud claims, the fraud by concealment and the 18 conspiracy to conceal, i urge you to consider these 19 questions. did not sonny ellis have the right to 20 know that whether it was 1972 to '78 and now and 21 then, but did not he have the right to know? and 22 there are american tobacco documents in evidence, 23 not all of them were gone over with you. 24 what they were doing with what they called 25 compound w? it is in evidence. did not he have the 3363 1 right to know about the removal of the nicotine? 2 there was not any label on these products explaining 3 these things. and how they put it back in? 4 did not he have the right to know that 5 reconstituted tobacco actually makes cigarettes 6 more addictive? did not he have the right to know 7 that cigarettes with ammonia compounds changes the 8 way that the nicotine enters your brain? 9 and ask yourself if, during the 1960s and '70s 10 and '80s, when the defendants' co-conspirator was 11 comparing mr. ellis and all of his fellow smokers 12 to lab rats motivated to push a lever for another 13 reward of nicotine, if he had known that is the way 14 that he was being treated as a customer of this 15 company, ask yourself whether or not it would have 16 made a difference to him. 17 you have the information, because they have 18 taken extraordinary measures to tell you how smart 19 sonny ellis was and what he did when he needed to 20 do something when he was armed with the right 21 information. 22 i want to say one thing about motivation and 23 then i want to say one thing about money. 24 this case does not paint a picture of a man 25 who stubbornly refused to quit smoking. that is 3364 1 their case. 2 this case paints a picture of a man who 3 believed, at least to some extent, and just enough 4 to grab the next cigarette, that these things maybe 5 just were not causing him the harm that he was 6 hearing about. 7 and there is no evidence in this case that he 8 ever knew, contrary to what counsel says, this 9 was not reported at the time of king james, what 10 they do to their cigarettes. 11 there is no evidence that he knew those 12 things. and we ask you to consider whether he or 13 any person armed with the information that we have 14 today, when you look at the 2010 surgeon general's 15 booklet for consumers and you see what is reported 16 now, cigarettes are designed for addiction. and 17 what is the prevalence of smoking in this country 18 today? twenty percent. 19 and they want to tell you in every instance, 20 whether it is the lung cancer, whether it is the 21 addiction, whether it is the lung cancer causation 22 on every one of these things, sonny ellis is an 23 outlier. he is an aberration. he is in that tiny 24 minority of folks who do not get addicted. he is in 25 that tiny minority. 3365 1 i think dr. okun said it was 3 percent of 2 people whose cancer is a mystery. he is in that 3 3 percent. he is in that tiny minority of people. 4 look at what happened in the population when the 5 defendants' co-conspirators lies unraveled over 6 time. 7 and just lastly a couple things about money 8 and about punitive damages. 9 mr. gustafson did not tell you to award a 10 particular amount of money. what he told you 11 instead was to do what you think is right, but he 12 asked you to place a ceiling on what you might 13 consider as a fair and just award based on the 14 instructions and the law that his honor has given 15 you, and that is our request. 16 our request is that you do that and that you 17 by your verdict speak not only to the loss that 18 mrs. ellis has experienced in these 20-plus years 19 on her own, and the nature of her loss in what she 20 had to observe as her husband literally, the way 21 they would argue it to you, smoke, smoke, smoked 22 that cigarette. 23 and finally, on comparative fault and punitive 24 damages, this case is not a case that suggests zero 25 responsibility for this defendant. the measure 3366 1 that mr. gustafson suggested to you, eighty percent 2 fault on this defendant, in light of their superior 3 knowledge, because dr. jaffe said, you know, 4 mr. ellis knew as much as anybody else. 5 and you know that to be false. you know that 6 they knew so much more about their products and 7 what they were doing to sonny ellis than he ever 8 could, unless he had lived to see all of the things 9 that you have seen in this courtroom. 10 finally, punitive damages. have we proven by 11 the clear and convincing evidence, because it is a 12 different standard, that these -- this defendant 13 deserves to be punished for the things that they 14 did, not stupid things, but outrageous things. 15 and your decision in that regard should speak 16 in accordance with the court's instructions, not to 17 deter reynolds from doing something which is now 18 out in the light. members of the jury, no, that 19 would be an unjust verdict. to punish them for 20 what they did and to deter, as the law says, others 21 from ever doing something like that again. 22 i think, your honor, i hit it about on the 23 head, did i? 24 the court: yeah, you have got four -- well, 25 you have actually got three and a half minutes if you 3367 1 want to use them. 2 mr. sales: it would be the first time that a 3 rebuttal argument has concluded with time left 4 over, hopefully i will not be criticized by my 5 colleagues for that, but thank you very much 6 everyone. and on behalf of ms. ellis and 7 mr. norton, miss stark, mr. scott, mr. norton, last 8 but not least certainly, mr. telofski, thank you 9 very much. 10 mr. norton: you forgot mr. gustafson. 11 mr. sales: oh, sorry. 12 mr. norton: but you gave me twice. 13 mr. sales: oh.
