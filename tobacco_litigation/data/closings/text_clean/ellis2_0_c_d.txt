11 mr. geise: may it please the court? 12 the court: yes, sir. 13 mr. geise: ms. shamp, ms. bryan, mr. ellis. 14 good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 15 the jurors: good afternoon. 16 mr. geise: i think when we met three weeks 17 ago, i had a similar spot to introduce myself and 18 that was right after lunch. so it is after lunch 19 again. i'm hoping you did not fill up on a lot of 20 food and you are going to fall asleep on me because i 21 do have a few things to say today, and i'm going to 22 be up here probably longer than you want me to be. 23 but i think they are important things to say, and i'm 24 going to take my time talking about the case. so i 25 ask you once again for your time and your attention 3623 1 and your patience while i address you. 2 and once again, it is not only after lunch, but 3 it is the bottom of an inning. and once again, i 4 want to thank you for your service. as i said in 5 voir dire, as i said in opening, we could not have a 6 jury trial without a jury. 7 the lawyers, we have to be here. we -- we 8 choose to do this for a living. mr. ellis is here 9 because he chose to file this lawsuit. but you 10 did not choose to do this. we chose you to do this. 11 and there are a lot of ways in this country that 12 people can contribute. 13 on the eve of september 11, i think we think of 14 the first responders and the people serving in the 15 military as really paying that highest price. many 16 of us vote on election day, as it was a couple weeks 17 ago during voir dire. 18 in the past three weeks, you have done your 19 duty of serving on a jury. so whatever you decide, 20 whatever the verdict, you can go home to your 21 friends, to your family and to your co-workers, and 22 you can feel proud that you have helped make this 23 country work because you have. 24 and for the three weeks that you have dedicated 25 to this process, by being here, by paying attention, 3624 1 by taking notes, by asking questions, we thank you. 2 on behalf of myself, my client and my team, we thank 3 you. 4 when this case started two weeks ago, i told 5 you that this case is not about other smokers. it is 6 only about betty owens. and in particular, this 7 case is about the choices she made when it came to 8 smoking. as this case now comes to a close, that is 9 what it is still about. and, yes, i am going to talk 10 about betty owens today. i'm going to talk about 11 her a lot. 12 two weeks ago, i told you that you would hear 13 an avalanche of information and testimony about 14 things that had nothing to do with betty owens. and 15 you sure did. in fact, you heard about some of 16 those things again today, things that judge norton 17 said had already been resolved in that other lawsuit 18 in the findings, things that i told you in my 19 opening statement were not an issue and were not 20 going to be issue. 21 dr. burns and dr. wright spent a lot of time 22 telling you that smoking causes lung cancer. you 23 heard that from judge norton and from me on day one. 24 it was not an issue then. it is not an issue now. 25 dr. werner and dr. burns told you that 3625 1 cigarette smoking is addictive. you heard that from 2 judge norton and from me on day one of this trial. 3 it was not issue an then. it is not an issue now. 4 and this case is not about whether cigarettes 5 should be or are legal. they are. they are legal to 6 make. they are legal to advertise and they are legal 7 to sell. and in this case, you heard that reynolds 8 manufactured, advertised and sold cigarettes, all 9 legal acts. you can look at page 18 of your jury 10 instructions. it will tell you that. 11 and cigarettes are also legal to smoke. 12 everyone has the right to smoke or not smoke. and 13 smokers like mrs. owens made the choice to smoke 14 cigarettes, all legal acts. 15 you may recall in my opening statement that i 16 told you that the plaintiff had the burden of proof 17 and needed to provide all the pieces to the puzzle. 18 in my closing argument, we are going to look at the 19 pieces that mr. ellis failed to provide, and in 20 addition, the pieces they offered that just do not 21 fit this case. 22 i also told you you would hear two sides of the 23 story, the two sides about who betty owens was. 24 now, the plaintiff tried to tell you that betty 25 owens was a weak, naive, uneducated woman who was 3626 1 unaware of the risks of smoking and unable to stop 2 smoking. 3 we provided evidence that paints a different 4 picture of mrs. owens, a picture of a -- of a 5 woman who faced adult matters from a very young age, 6 made adult decisions from a very young age, but used 7 her determination to overcome personal hardships in 8 her life to support a family and have a life of her 9 own. 10 and it was also a picture of a woman who was 11 repeatedly told about the risks of smoking, but was 12 never interested in quitting because she enjoyed 13 smoking and she wanted to continue smoking. 14 and i also told you in my opening statement 15 that the plaintiff would only tell you half of the 16 story, and you would probably have to wait until we 17 asked questions into our case to hear the whole 18 story. 19 and the plaintiff did just that. it started 20 with their first witness, dr. proctor. now, you may 21 remember him. he is the $2 million man who had that 22 travel plan mr. carter took him through that is 23 already seen dozens of trials this year, including 24 five in the month of august. 25 and when he took the stand, he started by 3627 1 telling you about -- you remember the rocks falling 2 from the sky and things from the cosmos. and he 3 said -- he was talking about something called the 4 celestial realm of the fifth essence. i have no 5 idea what that means. i did not know then; i do not 6 know now. 7 but dr. proctor also said that one of his 8 specialties was "the history of ignorance." and i 9 thought that was pretty telling because when it came 10 to betty owens, ignorance was right up dr. proctor's 11 alley. he was completely ignorant of any and all 12 facts about betty owens. you recall mr. carter 13 walked him through things he did not know. 14 "as a result, you have no opinion for this jury 15 as to why mrs. owens began smoking, correct. 16 "that is right. i do not have an opinion about 17 her biography one way or the other. 18 "that includes not having any information about 19 whether she ever tried to quit smoking? 20 "that is right. 21 "you do not have any understanding as to why she 22 chose any particular brand of cigarettes, do you? 23 "that is right. as i said, i do not have any 24 biographical information about her in general." 25 that is dr. proctor. 3628 1 the second live witness you heard was 2 dr. goldberg. but just like dr. proctor, he 3 could not tell you anything about mrs. owens either. 4 "so with respect to specific advertising, you 5 cannot identify any specific advertising campaign for 6 any brand of cigarettes that mrs. owens, in fact, 7 saw, read or heard at any point in time, correct? 8 "that is correct. 9 "and you cannot identify any specific statement 10 from the tobacco industry that mrs. owens, as an 11 individual, in fact, heard, read or saw, correct? 12 "that is correct." 13 but saying nothing at all might be better than 14 just saying half the story. how many times did we 15 have to show the rest of the story with dr. proctor 16 and dr. goldberg? they would plant the seed with 17 you on direct examination and wait to see if we 18 would bring out the whole story on cross. 19 ms. shamp showed you the winston ad with the 20 flintstones twice in her opening statement, and 21 dr. goldberg mentioned it during his direct exam. 22 it is just planting a seed that reynolds had 23 advertised with cartoons and focused on kid shows. 24 i called this half story in opening statement. i 25 told you they were going to do it and by golly, they 3629 1 did it. 2 so on cross, you had to learn the other side of 3 the story. you learned that the flintstones were 4 originally an adult comedy, modeled after the 5 honeymooners. and it aired in the evening, not 6 saturday morning. and that the flintstones were 7 cosponsored by alka seltzer and one a day vitamins, 8 hardly targeted at kids. we showed you the ad for 9 alka seltzer and one a day. 10 and you also learned reynolds never advertised 11 on the show when it moved to mornings. 12 now, dr. goldberg did not know either one of 13 those facts, or if he did, he just did not share them 14 with you. so we had to show you and him the other 15 side of the story. 16 and one other part of that story that relates 17 to betty owens, you heard that she was a grown 18 woman, on her second marriage and had already raised 19 three kids by the time the flintstones debuted. and 20 the last part of the story they did not share, there 21 was no evidence in this courtroom that she ever saw 22 or watched the flintstones or saw that ad. 23 another half story, teague, '53, one of the 24 first documents that ms. shamp showed you in 25 opening, one of the first documents she showed you 3630 1 today. she told you that dr. teague did a research 2 project and found all of this information about 3 cigarettes and that reynolds did not make that 4 research public. 5 but on cross, you heard that all 78 articles 6 cited by dr. teague were publicly available. now, 7 dr. proctor said, well, some of them were in german, 8 so he had to work a little harder to find those. 9 well, dr. teague should not be criticized for doing a 10 thorough job on his research paper. 11 another example of telling you only half the 12 story is about internal company research on 13 nicotine. they suggested during dr. proctor's 14 examination and again today that this research was 15 done to find a level of nicotine -- nicotine to keep 16 smokers addicted or that the ph level was adjusted 17 in a way to drive market share. do you remember 18 that? 19 again, on cross, and through cross of 20 dr. proctor and through dr. figlar's testimony, you 21 heard the other side of the story. the research was 22 done at the urging of the public health authorities 23 in conjunction with the nci with their tobacco 24 working group that was looking to find a less 25 hazardous cigarette and that it was at the 3631 1 instigation of the surgeon general to do that as 2 well. and you also saw that later studies showed 3 that there was no connection between ph and market 4 share. 5 ms. shamp calls it nicotine manipulation. but 6 the nci called it progress. dr. proctor did not tell 7 you any of that on direct. 8 dr. burns, dr. proctor, dr. goldberg showed you 9 lots of memos from bench level scientists and other 10 people at reynolds, but they failed to show you this 11 one. this is from the president of r. j. reynolds 12 to the head of r&d in 1968. and what did it say 13 that the plaintiff's experts did not tell you? "in 14 cooperation with others, you should push the work 15 concerning tobacco and health. you should prepare a 16 plan to foster any relationship with government 17 personnel in the quest for mutual understanding of 18 facts, ultimately to gain their cooperation in 19 proper research of the subject. if there is a safer 20 cigarette, let us continue and increase our efforts 21 in this program. please prepare a plan to carry it 22 out." 23 this was not a memo that was prepared to be a 24 trial exhibit. it was a directive to continue, 25 which means the work had already started, and to 3632 1 increase their efforts to develop a safer cigarette. 2 and you heard from dr. figlar about those efforts. 3 dr. burns, dr. proctor, dr. goldberg, they knew 4 about this document, but they kept it from you. 5 why did you have to wait for cross examination 6 or for our witnesses to get the full story, the side 7 the plaintiff did not tell you? why? the answer is 8 simple, to get you mad, to upset you. 9 the first three witnesses had three things in 10 common. they were here to reprove the findings that 11 do not need to be reproven and get you mad. they 12 could not and did not say a single word about 13 mrs. owens. and, finally, they each became 14 millionaires testifying in cases against the tobacco 15 companies. 16 those three were not here to offer a single 17 opinion about mrs. owens. in fact, they could not. 18 they were here to get you mad so that you would 19 decide this case based on emotion rather than on the 20 facts of the case of betty owens. 21 because if you focus on the facts of betty 22 owens, unlike these three, mr. ellis loses. he 23 loses because he cannot meet his burden of proof that 24 mrs. owens' adenocarcinoma was caused by smoke. he 25 loses because betty owens was not addicted. she 3633 1 maintained control over her smoking choices and 2 smoked because she enjoyed it, never expressed an 3 interest in quitting and was not motivated to quit. 4 and he loses because any addiction mrs. owens 5 had was not the legal and substantial cause of her 6 injury. instead, her adult choice to do what she 7 wanted to do was the legal cause of her actions and 8 whatever consequences came from them. 9 finally, mr. ellis loses because he cannot prove 10 a link between anything reynolds said or did and any 11 smoking decision made by mrs. owens. 12 i showed you this slide in opening. and it is 13 the burdens that the plaintiff has to meet in this 14 case. and ms. shamp identified these three in her 15 closing argument to you today. and as i said in 16 opening statement, the plaintiff has the burden of 17 proof. it was true then and it is true now. 18 and -- and let me tell you something about the 19 burden of proof. ms. shamp tried to suggest it is 20 just a tipping of the scales. it is not. it is not. 21 it is not a comparison of how many pieces do you have 22 here versus how many documents over here? that is 23 not how it works. 24 if you look at your jury instructions, when you 25 go back to deliberate, on page 4, it tells you that 3634 1 the greater weight of the evidence means the more 2 persuasive and convincing force and effect. it 3 does not talk about a scale. it does not talk about a 4 tally. it does not talk about size. 5 and when you look at the burden of proof and 6 you consider the evidence, consider what you saw, 7 but consider what they could not show you. i do not 8 know how you weigh missing evidence, but you need to 9 consider it in this case. 10 if mr. owens fails -- or mr. ellis fails to 11 prove that mrs. owens' adenocarcinoma was caused by 12 smoking, he loses. but if he meets that burden, he 13 also has to prove that she was addicted. and if he 14 meets that, that her addiction was a legal cause of 15 her death, not other factors, such as her choice to 16 smoke in the face of multiple warnings and constant 17 hounding from her children because she did what she 18 wanted to do. 19 these three burdens are all contained in that 20 first question on your verdict form. all three are 21 separate hurdles. all three are separate burdens. 22 if the plaintiff fails to meet his burden on any one 23 of those issues, he fails to prove his entire case. 24 in order to check -- check yes on that first 25 question, the plaintiff needs to clear all three 3635 1 hurdles by the greater weight of the evidence. 2 and one by one, i will address each of those 3 burdens and show you why the answer to that question 4 should be no. 5 now, in my opening statement, i said there 6 would be no dispute that mrs. owens had lung cancer 7 and was a smoker. that is not in dispute. but i 8 told you that the plaintiff would not be able to 9 meet his burden of proof because the available 10 medical evidence is scant, and important pieces of 11 the medical puzzle are missing altogether. and i 12 asked you to hold the plaintiff to its burden of 13 proof instead of jumping to that knee-jerk reaction 14 that anytime a smoker gets lung cancer that it has 15 to be caused by smoking. 16 now, instead of hearing from any doctor whoever 17 met, saw or treated mrs. owens, you heard from 18 dr. wright. dr. wright's another professional 19 witness. he is testified over 1600 times, most often 20 in cases involving electrocutions. he gets 100 21 percent of his income from litigation. and he said 22 he stopped treating patients to be a full-time 23 expert because he did not like sharing his money with 24 his hospital. that is who they brought to talk to 25 you, not her doctors, but dr. wright. 3636 1 and dr. wright told you that this case was 2 aberrant. it was abnormal. it was unusual. he 3 told you the records were scant. he admitted that 4 he had just a few smattering of things, hardly any 5 medical records, and he said everything appears to 6 be basically gone. that is what he had. 7 he admitted that the gold standard for 8 diagnosing cancer is tissue analysis, but then he 9 could not meet that standard because there was no 10 tissue for him to analyze. that was just one 11 missing piece for dr. wright. there were others -- 12 no pathology, no pathology reports, no tissue from 13 the bronchoscopy, the lobectomy or the wedge 14 resection -- resection, no radiology, no films and 15 no autopsy. 16 with all of the pieces missing, dr. wright 17 could not do an independent evaluation and could not 18 put the puzzle together himself. he told you that. 19 so what he did is he had to take the word of another 20 doctor that mrs. owens had adenocarcinoma. but he 21 never tried to get a word in with that doctor. he 22 told you he did not bother to try to talk to her 23 doctors. 24 now, the words that those doctors did use in 25 the scant records we do have are pretty telling. 3637 1 dr. wright was asked this. okay? 2 "regardless, there is no indication here on the 3 death certificate that ms. owens' lung cancer was 4 caused by tobacco or smoking cigarettes? 5 "correct. 6 the medical records here which were filled out 7 by ms. owens' treating physicians also do not report 8 on the cause of her lung cancer being smoking or 9 tobacco? 10 "no. 11 "and similarly, none of the medical records 12 list adenocarcinoma secondary to or caused by 13 smoking? 14 "correct." 15 so the only word you had in this case linking 16 mrs. owens' adenocarcinoma to cigarette smoking 17 comes from dr. wright. 18 and you might recall, dr. wright was asked in 19 his deposition, did he think that the medical 20 records at some point referred to mrs. owens having 21 small cell cancer. you might remember that. and on 22 the stand, he said, yeah, that is what i believed at 23 the time; i was wrong. 24 dr. wright was wrong on other things too. to 25 link mrs. owens' adenocarcinoma to her smoking, he 3638 1 said he had to base his opinions on epidemiology. 2 but look at what he said about epidemiology and his 3 experience. 4 "now, you do not have a degree in epidemiology? 5 "no. 6 "you talked about your board certifications. 7 you are not board-certified in the field of 8 epidemiology? 9 "i am not. 10 "you have not published on the topic of 11 epidemiology? 12 "i've published in epidemiology. 13 "have you published on the epidemiology of 14 cancer? 15 "no, just gunshot wounds. gunshot wounds." 16 so as a result, dr. wright had to admit this. 17 "so today, do you believe yourself to be an 18 epidemiologist in cancer? 19 "no." 20 and this case involves cancer, specifically 21 mrs. owens' cancer. it does not involve gunshot 22 wounds. 23 so despite a complete lack of expertise and 24 with only scant records, dr. wright told you that 25 mrs. owens' adenocarcinoma was caused by smoking. 3639 1 but you know the opinion he tried to tell you is 2 directly contrary to an opinion he offered in a 3 different case just a couple years ago when he said 4 this. he was asked, about his transcript in that 5 other deposition: "what types of cancers are 6 associated with lung cancer? 7 "answer: squamous cell, small cell, 8 undifferentiated and large cell too. adeno, close 9 call." 10 the next question: "when you say close call, 11 you mean you do not believe there is sufficient 12 evidence to link smoking?" 13 his answer: "i do not. some people may. 14 adeno, it is pretty not clear. to me, it is not 15 clear. 16 "was that your testimony in november? 17 "that was my testimony." 18 that was his testimony then. which was the 19 truth, his testimony then or his testimony to you? 20 is this something else that he must have believed at 21 the time, but was wrong about? 22 and ms. shamp will criticize r. j. reynolds for 23 not saying until 2000 that smoking caused lung 24 cancer. this was 2012 for their expert. 25 now, not surprisingly, dr. wright, when he 3640 1 comes in here to testify, admits he was previously 2 wrong when he needs to for purposes of his opinion 3 in this case. 4 ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, 5 there are too many missing pieces for mr. ellis to 6 satisfy his burden of proving his mother's 7 adenocarcinoma was caused by smoking by the greater 8 weight of the evidence. the tissue and records that 9 would allow you to prove that are missing. the 10 records we have do not say anything about smoking 11 being the cause of adenocarcinoma, of her 12 adenocarcinoma. and dr. wright lacks the expertise 13 to offer an opinion about the cause of her cancer, 14 and, more importantly, lacks the credibility to do 15 so since he testified exactly the opposite in a 16 different case when a different opinion was called 17 for. 18 for all these reasons, the plaintiff fails to 19 meet his burden of proof of cause -- of -- of 20 proving what caused mrs. owens' adenocarcinoma and 21 death. and for that reason, the answer to question 22 number 1 should be no. 23 now, if you move beyond that, you move into the 24 question of addiction. and you will need to decide 25 what addiction means in this case. the court will 3641 1 not define it for you. we went through the jury 2 instructions. there is not an instruction on what 3 addiction means. 4 ms. shamp asked, where is the evidence that she 5 was not addicted? i'm going to talk about the 6 evidence that showed that she was not addicted. 7 first, you heard from dr. hayes and dr. werner. 8 there is no medical record from any doctor who 9 treated mrs. owens that reveals a diagnosis of 10 addiction, of dependence, of tobacco use disorder, 11 nothing. i do not know what you do with that. you 12 cannot put that on a scale because it does not exist. 13 it is a burden they have that they cannot prove. 14 and you heard that people who are addicted 15 experience a loss of control and become 16 significantly impaired and distressed. mrs. owens 17 had the ability to control her smoking and you saw 18 evidence of that. martha did not allow smoking in 19 her house and her mom complied. mr. ellis did not 20 allow smoking, she respected his wishes. he did not 21 allow smoking in his car, she did not. both martha 22 and ken did not want her smoking around their kids, 23 she did not. she went to baptist services every 24 sunday, you could not smoke at church, she did not. 25 i told you in opening statements you would hear 3642 1 some simple facts about nicotine and nicotine 2 addiction, and you did. nicotine addiction does not 3 permanently change brain receptors. it does not. it 4 does not interfere with a smoker's ability to 5 understand the risks of smoking. it does not 6 interfere with the smoker's ability to make a choice 7 to quit or to make a choice to continue smoking. 8 and it does not prevent a smoker from quitting. any 9 smoker can quit. everybody agreed to that -- 10 dr. burns, dr. werner, dr. hayes. 11 on cross examination, even dr. werner admitted 12 that millions of smokers, over 60 million smokers, 13 have quit smoking and millions of them were addicted 14 and yet they were able to stop for good. 15 i want to talk a little bit about dsm-5. both 16 dr. werner and dr. hayes talked about it yesterday. 17 ms. shamp said in her closing -- i wrote down -- she 18 said, dsm-5 is the book; it is the book. well, 19 oddly, despite using it, dr. werner does not think 20 that the book is authoritative. you remember i 21 asked her that question yesterday, i believe. 22 and -- and her back story on dsm-5 is 23 interesting. first, she has never, never used dsm-5 24 to treat one of her own patients, never. she only 25 uses it for litigation. and then she explains why 3643 1 she cannot use it in her practice by saying, it is 2 impossible. and remember, you she said those 3 diagnostic codes, the icd codes, are different from 4 dsm-iv-tr and dsm-5. but -- but you saw the truth 5 yesterday. i showed you the dsm-iv-tr and i showed 6 you the dsm-5. and i do not know if you will remember, 7 but the code in both of them is 305.1. it is the 8 same code. 9 and i showed you where the american psychiatric 10 association told practitioners to use the dsm-5 11 immediately, and that is when it came out, in the 12 spring of 2013. 13 leaving that aside, what does the book say 14 about addiction? the book, dsm-5, says that 50 15 percent of daily smokers are addicted. so that 16 means fifty percent of daily smokers are not addicted. 17 now, in her rebuttal, ms. shamp may come back 18 and say, well, let us go back and look at an earlier 19 version or let us go back to this one. let us not 20 look at the new -- the book, the dsm-5. let us not 21 look at that. let us base it on something else. 22 look, the earth is not flat. you can base your 23 decision in this case on the current thing, the book 24 that both addiction experts in this case used. 25 now, dr. werner agreed that different mental 3644 1 health professionals can look at the same set of 2 facts and apply dsm-5 and reach different opinions. 3 and she said each professional has to apply their 4 own critical judgment based on their experience, 5 their background and their training. 6 now, after telling you that dsm-5 cannot be used 7 as a cookbook, dr. werner did exactly that with 8 ms. shamp, and ms. shamp showed you it again today. 9 they put up a list of things. they check the boxes 10 and say, that is what it adds up to; it must mean 11 addiction. 12 well, first of all, even though i questioned 13 dr. werner on this, you remember the -- the 14 checklist that -- that they used where it said, 15 dsm-5, addiction? dsm-5 does not have a diagnosis of 16 addiction. it has tobacco use disorder. but never 17 mind. set that aside. 18 the second step in using this cookbook is 19 dr. werner misapplied it. the dsm says right up 20 front that you must look for clinically significant 21 impairment or distress. and i do not recall 22 dr. werner telling you that mrs. owens was 23 clinically significant impaired or distressed. 24 now, in her closing argument today, ms. shamp 25 said that dr. hayes never told you why mrs. owens 3645 1 was not addicted. so she may not have been 2 listening when mr. carter put dr. hayes on direct, 3 when she walked through the reasons she said that. 4 but she also was not listening to the question from 5 one of you. and i do not know which one of you asked 6 it, but in your questions to dr. hayes, one of you 7 asked, explain how you came to your conclusion. and 8 she did. she told you that mrs. owens was not 9 distressed. she was not impaired, she retained the 10 choice to smoke, and she did not make the choice to 11 stop. 12 dr. hayes used her experience, her background 13 and her training, and she told you that mrs. owens 14 was not clinically significantly impaired or 15 distressed and she told you why. 16 now, in addition, when dr. werner walks through 17 the cookbook and tries to pick it off, she did not 18 even follow the recipe correctly. you remember, in 19 dsm, it says, you have got to look for those criteria 20 in the same 12-month period? well, dr. werner 21 picked something from the '60s, something from '80s, 22 something from the '90s and tried to mix it 23 altogether. it does not work that way. 24 and moreover, dr. werner admitted this. 25 "and, in fact, ms. owens would say that she 3646 1 enjoyed smoking. it relaxed her and she liked to 2 smoke, correct? 3 "yes." 4 choosing to do something you enjoy is not a 5 sign of significant impairment or distress. doing 6 what you want to do is not a disorder. it is a 7 decision. and betty owens had the choice and the 8 control to make a different decision if she wanted 9 to. dr. hayes told you it takes motivation, 10 determination and persistence. you heard that 11 mrs. owens' quit attempts, if any, were not 12 motivated, were not determined and were not 13 persistent. 14 yesterday, ms. shamp asked dr. werner to 15 speculate. do some people try to quit and not tell 16 anyone? it is complete speculation in this case 17 because the facts and the proof in this case tell 18 you differently. do not accept speculation. look at 19 the proof. 20 martha told you her mother never went a full 21 day, 24 hours, without smoking a cigarette. she 22 does not recall her mother making any attempt to quit 23 at any time before she moved out of the house in 24 1968. and after she moved out, she recalled one 25 time coming home, and her mom was sucking on a 3647 1 lozenge in between smoking two cigarettes. she 2 was not necessarily trying to quit, but just sucking 3 on a lozenge. not only is that not an attempt to 4 quit; it was not a quit at all. 5 mr. ellis only recalls two times when his 6 mother may have been trying to cut down. in the 7 1960s, he recalls her sucking on something, a pill, 8 a lozenge, something, and in that time, she never 9 told him she was trying to quit. and in the 1980s, 10 he was not around, but he heard that she tried 11 something again, but he was not there to observe 12 her. 13 ladies and gentlemen, that was the evidence you 14 heard. that was it. two times over the course of 15 30-plus years. that is not persistence. 16 and these attempts, whenever they may be, had 17 one thing in common. her method to allegedly quit 18 smoking was to keep smoking. no other steps. no 19 plan, no motivation, no determination. she never 20 took the step of throwing away her cigarettes or her 21 ashtrays in an attempt to quit smoking. she never 22 made what the surgeon general calls a "serious quit 23 attempt" of 24 hours. and when cessation aids 24 became available in the '80s, mrs. owens did not try 25 them. and before cessation aids and after cessation 3648 1 aids, the most popular way to quit is cold turkey. 2 mrs. owens never tried that either. 3 now, the plaintiff said that his mother 4 appeared to be moody or agitated when she was 5 sucking on that lozenge in the 1960s. well, first, 6 again, one of you asked a great question. smokers 7 who are not addicted can also have withdrawal 8 symptoms. and, secondly, mr. ellis told you his mom 9 was going through a divorce at that time, a divorce 10 that he and his sisters knew nothing about even 11 though they were living in the same house. 12 you heard a little bit this morning, and i 13 guess you will probably hear it this afternoon, about 14 when mrs. owens asked for cigarettes when she was in 15 the nursing home. now, you also heard from martha 16 that during that visit in the nursing home, what 17 were the other two things that they got mrs. owens? 18 they got her a nightgown and they got her a 19 television, things to make her comfortable, things 20 that she enjoyed. and as mr. ellis wrote on that 21 letter that we will talk about in a little bit, he 22 said his mom enjoyed it. 23 and you also heard about many other times where 24 mrs. owens was unable to smoke, and no one told you 25 that she asked for cigarettes, complained or 3649 1 experienced any withdrawal symptoms. and that was 2 her hospital stays. you heard from dr. hayes. she 3 was in the hospital for different treatment for 20 4 days in april of 1991, six days in july of that 5 year, 19 days in september of that year, 14 days in 6 june of 1992 and 28 days in january of 1993, five 7 different stays. 8 and on each of those occasions, neither ken nor 9 martha testified that she was moody or fidgety. 10 nobody testified she had any cravings. there was no 11 evidence that she asked, somebody get me cigarettes 12 or somebody take me outside so i can have one. no 13 evidence. 14 more importantly, because of the lengths of 15 some of these stays, you know that all of the 16 nicotine was completely out of mrs. owens' system at 17 that time. when she returned to smoking after those 18 stays, it was because she wanted to, not because of 19 addiction. that is evidence she was not addicted. 20 now, one other point. through some of the 21 witnesses, the plaintiff tried to suggest that there 22 was a genetic reason for mrs. owens' initiation and 23 her continued smoking. well, if -- if that is true 24 and that theory applies to mrs. owens, you know that 25 ken and martha bucked their genes. they never 3650 1 smoked. and you know that uncle bernice bucked his 2 genes because he quit smoking. and dr. werner had 3 to admit yesterday that uncle bernice's quit is a 4 good indicator of success for mrs. owens, but it 5 would only be successful if she wanted to quit. 6 mrs. owens was always in control of the 7 decision to quit. dr. werner said this yesterday on 8 direct examination. ms. shamp asked her: 9 "now -- and i heard you say that smokers have 10 control over their decision to quit." 11 and dr. werner said: "that is correct." 12 mrs. owens never experienced a loss of control 13 over that decision. she never lost the ability to 14 quit. she was never significantly impaired. she 15 was never significantly distressed. she was not 16 addicted. 17 now, because the plaintiff did not prove she 18 was addicted, he did not clear that second hurdle 19 either, and for this additional reason, the answer 20 to the first answer on the verdict form has to be 21 no. 22 let us move to the third hurdle. if you find 23 that mrs. owens was addicted, the third hurdle is to 24 determine if her addiction was the legal cause of 25 her death. 3651 1 and you have it in your jury instructions at 2 page 12, i think, and the instruction says: an 3 addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine is a 4 legal cause of betty owens' lung cancer and death if 5 it directly and in a natural and continuous sequence 6 produced or contributed substantially to producing 7 betty owens' death so that it can reasonably be said 8 that but for that addiction, her death would not 9 have occurred when it did. 10 you have that in your instructions. and the 11 evidence here proves that addiction is not the "but 12 for" reason for any of mrs. owens' smoking 13 behaviors. 14 the "but for" cause of her smoking was her 15 choice, her decision to smoke for as long as she did 16 because that is what she enjoyed and wanted to do. 17 now, ask yourself this question: if mrs. owens 18 was not addicted, would she have continued to smoke? 19 and i think from the evidence you heard in this 20 case, the answer is, of course, she would have. for 21 this reason alone, addiction cannot be the legal 22 cause of her death because it was far from the 23 substantial cause of her smoking. if her smoking 24 behavior would be the same whether she was addicted 25 or not, then addiction cannot be a substantial cause 3652 1 because it did not make a difference. 2 as you look at this question in this case, keep 3 something in mind. this case is about mr. ellis 4 seeking money on account of mrs. owens' decision to 5 do what she wanted to do for years. ms. shamp said, 6 just because you make a choice does not mean it is a 7 good decision. well, in this trial, it really 8 does not matter whether you think mrs. owens' choices 9 were good choices or bad choices. what matters is 10 that they were her choices and we should not 11 second-guess them. 12 yes, mrs. owens started smoking as a teenager. 13 there is no dispute about that. dr. werner told you 14 yesterday, though, that she was mature enough at 13 15 or 14 to make the decision to get married and to 16 start a family and also mature enough to make the 17 decision to smoke. we should not second-guess the 18 choice. 19 now, in response to the constant nagging and 20 hounding she received, mrs. owens told her children 21 that she enjoyed smoking; it relaxed her and she 22 liked to smoke. those are the reasons she offered 23 for smoking. she did not say she was addicted. she 24 did not say she was unable to quit. when asked, she 25 responded she enjoyed it; it relaxed her and she 3653 1 liked it. 2 when mrs. owens chose not to sleep over at 3 mr. ellis's house, it was not because of an 4 addiction. it was because it was her decision. she 5 was a homebody who liked to be home. as i covered 6 with mr. ellis on monday, mrs. owens would say that 7 she preferred to go home where she could relax, 8 where she could be in her own house and do what she 9 wanted to do. it sounds like the things that 10 homebodies like to do. and the other thing is she 11 never expressed any interest in quitting so she 12 could spend the night. 13 you heard from martha about how close she was 14 with her mother, and you heard how she asked 15 mrs. owens to stop smoking every time she saw her. 16 if mrs. owens wanted to quit smoking and just 17 could not do it, do you think she would have asked 18 her daughter, a nurse, for help in quitting? of 19 course, she would have. but she never did. why? 20 because she did not want to quit. martha told you 21 that. this is the evidence in this case. 22 "you never heard your mother say that she 23 wanted to quit smoking? 24 "never. 25 "your mother never told you, i'm trying to quit 3654 1 smoking, did she? 2 "no, she did not." 3 and mr. ellis told you he does not think anybody 4 could have said anything to mrs. owens to make her 5 quit. mrs. owens was smart enough to know the risks 6 of smoking, but she was not motivated enough to want 7 to stop. she smoked for as long as she did not 8 because she was addicted, but because she wanted to. 9 and mr. ellis should not be awarded money for 10 mrs. owens' decisions. so even if you decide betty 11 owens was addicted, that addiction was not a legal 12 cause. 13 and here's another way to look at what legal 14 cause requires, as you are instructed. it requires 15 that it naturally, directly, continuously and 16 substantially caused it. you saw that did not occur 17 in mrs. owens' case. you saw that mrs. owens' 18 choices were the direct, the natural, the continuous 19 and the substantial causes of her injury. 20 why? because she made the choice to begin 21 smoking against her father's wishes. she made the 22 choice to continue smoking despite the health 23 warnings and hounding from her children. she made 24 the choice to control her smoking. and she made the 25 choice to not make a serious quit attempt. and 3655 1 that is just not me saying this. the plaintiff's 2 experts agree that the decision and the choice lies 3 with the individual. 4 dr. burns, you saw him by videotape. 5 he was asked: "all right. and you see what he 6 wrote at the last paragraph, e. koop or surgeon 7 general koop, wrote 'cigarette smoking is an 8 addictive behavior.' 9 "yes. 10 "'and the individual smoker must decide whether 11 or not to continue that behavior?' 12 "you agree with that statement, do not you?" 13 and dr. burns said: "absolutely, sure." 14 dr. werner agreed with that very statement 15 again yesterday. 16 mrs. owens had a decision to make, and her 17 decision was to continue her smoking. she never 18 said she wanted to decide otherwise and quit. and 19 even mr. ellis admitted it was his mother's decision 20 to make. 21 you might remember this testimony from monday. 22 he answered one of my questions. 23 "well, i did not allow her to smoke in my house. 24 i do not tell adults what they should or should not 25 do." 3656 1 and then i asked: "is smoking an adult 2 decision?" 3 and mr. ellis said: "well, when you are an 4 adult, whatever decision you do is your decision. i 5 do not make decisions for people." 6 that is the plaintiff in this case talking about 7 his mother, said whatever decision you do is your 8 decision. 9 but now, 21 years after her death, mr. ellis 10 does not want to respect mrs. owens' decision. in 11 this lawsuit, to get money for his mother's choices, 12 mr. ellis tells you that his mother's decisions were 13 not her own, that she lost control, and her decision 14 to smoke was based on addiction. that is not what he 15 told you on the stand. 16 and dr. koop reported, who is in control: 17 "ultimately you are the one that has control over 18 your behavior. the cigarette is not going to light 19 itself and jump into your mouth, nor are you going 20 to go into a brain-induced hypnotic trance and light 21 the cigarette. no matter how much you have smoked 22 or how much you smoke, the choice to light up is 23 always yours." 24 ladies and gentlemen, the cigarette did not jump 25 into mrs. owens' mouth. she made each and every 3657 1 choice, despite the knowledge of the harm it could 2 do to her. whatever decision she made was her 3 decision. when mrs. owens made that choice to 4 smoke, her choice was the legal cause, the direct, 5 the natural and the substantial cause. as a result, 6 any disease or death brought about by her smoking 7 was not legally caused by addiction. 8 i want to look at the verdict form, and you 9 have a copy with you. based on the evidence in this 10 case, looking at question 1, the answer to number 1 11 is no for three separate reasons. because the 12 plaintiff can only bring you a professional expert 13 who relies on aberrant and scant records that cannot 14 be confirmed and more importantly because that 15 expert has testified in the past that he does not 16 believe there is sufficient evidence for a link 17 between adenocarcinoma and smoking, the first hurdle 18 is is not met. because mrs. owens did not suffer from 19 a loss of control or significant impairment or 20 distress, she was not addicted, and that hurdle 21 was not met. and because addiction was not the "but 22 for" cause of mrs. owens' smoking or death, the 23 plaintiff failed to prove that addiction caused it, 24 so that hurdle is not met. 25 so be -- can i get the elmo, please, michael? 3658 1 because the plaintiff failed to clear all three 2 of these hurdles, the answer should be no to 3 question 1, which you can see it has all three parts 4 in it. the cause of her lung cancer; was she 5 addicted and was addiction a legal cause for lung 6 cancer. because they failed to clear any of those 7 three hurdles, the answer to question 1 should be 8 no. 9 now, you will also see on the verdict form that 10 if your answer to question 1 was yes, you continue. 11 but if your answer to question 1 was no, you proceed 12 no further. i represent that the evidence in this 13 case shows you you should check no and proceed no 14 further. 15 but i'm going to continue anyway. if you 16 continue past that first question and clear those 17 three hurdles, you need to consider mr. ellis's 18 concealment and conspiracy to conceal claims in 19 questions 2 and 3. and i think we have a slide of 20 those. these are the two questions pulled off your 21 verdict form on pages 2 and 3. 22 now, one thing i'll tell you upfront, when you 23 look at these two questions, you will notice 24 specifically that betty owens' name is in both of 25 those. these questions relate only to betty owens, 3659 1 not to some other smoker who is not in this 2 courtroom. they relate only to betty owens. and 3 there essentially two parts to these questions. 4 first, you need to determine if information 5 about the health risks and the addictive nature of 6 smoking was a secret to mrs. owens, and if so, 7 you will need to determine if she reasonably relied on 8 any statement to her detriment. here, the 9 information was not a secret to mrs. owens, and she 10 did not rely on anything any tobacco company said. 11 so let us start with that first question. were 12 the dangers of smoking a secret? you will remember 13 that ms. shamp told you in opening statement that 14 the evidence would show that the public did not know 15 smoking was harmful, but the other side of the story 16 showed just the opposite. it showed the public did 17 know about the risks of smoking and its addictive 18 nature, and more importantly, so did mrs. owens. in 19 fact, it was drummed into her over and over by her 20 children. 21 and we need to even start this story before 22 mrs. owens was born. you heard this from 23 dr. proctor. he said before reynolds even existed, 24 it was known tobacco contained nicotine. it was 25 known for hundreds of years that it could be 3660 1 addictive and it could be hard to quit. it was 2 known for a long time smoking can be bad for you. 3 and since the beginning of the 20th century, it was 4 common to refer to cigarettes as "coffin nails" or 5 "cancer sticks." 6 and incidentally you heard from mr. ellis 7 that -- the growing up, he heard the term "coffin 8 nails" and "cancer sticks." and it would be used to 9 make fun of people because they smoked, because 10 there were health ramifications. 11 you saw this, florida health notes, 1906. 12 "today, the cigarette is looked upon by all smokers 13 as the very worst form of tobacco addiction. and 14 dr. proctor told you that in that early 1900s, the 15 movement after alcohol prohibition, the crowds would 16 chant "nicotine next, nicotine next." and he said 17 nicotine was synonymous with tobacco because 18 everyone knew it was a drug in tobacco that made it 19 hard to quit. 20 in the 1930s, you saw the three stooges in that 21 movie scene involving what? the coffin nails 22 cigarette company from the 1930s. now, dr. proctor 23 can call it a joke, but the material information 24 that the stooges had and all of their fans 25 understood was that smoking could kill you and put 3661 1 you in your coffin. if people did not understand 2 that, nobody would get the joke of coffin nails 3 cigarette company. 4 you heard that mr. owens -- or mrs. owens' 5 father did not want his children to smoke. mr. ellis 6 told you that his mom told him that if she got 7 smoking, she would be disciplined, and she would 8 likely get the belt. as a result, she started 9 smoking behind her father's back so she would not get 10 caught and punished. 11 you saw the coverage in the reader's digest. 12 reader's digest, a magazine that mrs. owens not only 13 read, but she collected. you saw the coverage -- 14 ms. shamp showed you a mouse this morning. you saw 15 the coverage from the mouse skin painting that 16 appeared in life magazine in 1953. again, a 17 magazine that mrs. owens read and collected. 18 the messages made it to the papers in 19 tennessee. you saw these from the 1950s. and 20 illinois, when they moved there after she married 21 mr. owens, it made it there in the 1950s. and it 22 followed them to virginia when they went to roanoke. 23 ann landers said "anyone who can read or hear knows 24 by now that there is a definite link between lung 25 cancer and cigarettes." 3662 1 now, they can try to minimize mrs. owens' 2 education all they want, but there is no doubt that 3 mrs. owens could read and hear. 4 now, not surprisingly, the public health 5 officials in the 1950s recognized this widespread 6 dissemination and awareness of the information. you 7 saw these quotes from two of the pioneers back then. 8 leroy burney, who was the surgeon general said: 9 "our position is that we have informed the public 10 through the excellent coverage of the press, radio 11 and tv." 12 and dr. heller, who was the head of the 13 national cancer institute, said: "newspapers, radio 14 and tv and other media have done an excellent job 15 covering this problem and a very objective job. 16 this is an exceedingly valuable way of informing the 17 public." 18 when mr. carter pressed dr. proctor on these 19 statements, what did he say? dr. proctor said that 20 dr. burney was engaging in -- and i wrote it down -- 21 self-congratulating, and he said that dr. heller was 22 ignorant. 23 his theory is that these giants and pioneers in 24 public health work -- remember, he said they were 25 beating their chests when they made these comments. 3663 1 now, these were guys making history in the 1950s, 2 the head of the nci and the surgeon general. but 3 now 60 years later, dr. proctor, a guy who studies 4 history, said they were way off base. these 5 officials had their boots on the ground back then 6 and were eyewitnesses for what the public knew. and 7 at the time, they said the public knew. 8 now, instead of praising these public health 9 officials for their contributions, dr. proctor calls 10 them ignorant chest-beaters. 11 in 1964, 50 years ago, the first surgeon 12 general's report linking smoking with lung cancer 13 was published, and you saw that it was front-page -- 14 a front-page story around the country. in florida, 15 in 1964, the times-union. and you know who was a 16 paper boy for the times-union from 1964 to 1968. we 17 know who that was. it was mr. ellis. it was not 18 just in the paper. it was in life. they covered 19 the 1964 surgeon general's report, again, a magazine 20 that mrs. owens read and collected. 21 and that night, it was on the evening news on 22 all three stations and there were only three. so if 23 the tv was on in the owens' household that night, 24 that story was on. 25 and -- and it was communicated in big red 3664 1 letters at the very spot that mrs. owens bought her 2 cigarettes. this sign was posted at each of the 3 navy exchanges. so if you bought cigarettes, you 4 were going to see the words from the surgeon 5 general's report in big red letters. 6 from 1960- -- january 1966 and every day 7 thereafter, every pack mrs. owens had in her hand 8 came with a warning label. and we know mrs. owens 9 was aware of this warning label. how do we know? 10 the evidence in this case. martha told us. 11 "when you first saw that warning label on a 12 package of cigarettes, you mentioned it to your 13 mother? 14 "correct. 15 "you mentioned it to her during one of your 16 conversations when you asked her to quit smoking? 17 "correct. 18 "and you told her specifically that even the 19 packet says that cigarette smoking could be harmful? 20 "correct. 21 "your mom had already seen the warning label on 22 cigarettes; is that correct? 23 "yes, she said that she saw it." 24 ken told you about it too in his testimony on 25 monday. 3665 1 and you heard that when that warning label came 2 out, in the next four years, 13 million people made 3 the decision, made the choice to stop smoking. they 4 had that warning in their hand, and they took 5 matters into their own hands and quit. mrs. owens 6 could have too. 7 now, this message was being communicated to 8 americans in towns large and small around the 9 country. you remember dr. horn, his "you could 10 stand on a rooftop and shout 'smoking is dangerous' 11 at the top of your lungs, and you would not be 12 telling anyone anything they did not already know." 13 that is dr. horn. 14 dr. burns also got on his own rooftop. he was 15 the plaintiff's expert in this case. 16 and he was asked: "now, in 1981, you gave a 17 speech to a lung association group about the 18 percentage of smokers who were aware of the risks, 19 correct?" 20 "yes. i'm well familiar with that group. 21 "all right. and you told that group in 1981 22 that 95 percent of smokers were thoroughly aware of 23 the health risks, and ninety percent thought that it 24 might affect their own health, correct? 25 "that is correct. and i believe i said that 3666 1 more smokers know that cigarette smoking causes 2 disease or cancer than know the name of the 3 president of the united states." 4 that is the plaintiff's expert in this case. 5 and dr. burns also told you that he knew dr. horn, 6 and dr. horn had told him on a number of occasions 7 the same thing he said about people shouting it from 8 the rooftop and not telling them something you 9 would not know. 10 now, i suppose if we had asked dr. proctor, he 11 would probably say dr. burns and dr. horn were 12 ignorant chest-beaters as well. 13 and you know the warnings kept coming, 1970, 14 1985. through all this time, on top of all these 15 warnings you see, mrs. owens was receiving repeated 16 warnings and messages from whom? her children. 17 even before martha graduated from high school, 18 before she got married and before she moved out of 19 the house in 1968, she talked to her mother about 20 smoking. and she told you how those conversations 21 continued every time she saw or talked to her 22 mother, especially when she was going to nursing 23 school. 24 let us look at what martha told you in this 25 case. 3667 1 "something you learned during nursing school, 2 that smoking was associated with lung problems? 3 "correct. 4 "and as you just said, you saw healthy lungs 5 versus damaged black lungs? 6 "right. 7 "and you learned that it was the chemical -- 8 chemicals in tobacco smoke that caused that damage 9 to the lungs? 10 "correct." 11 martha continued. 12 "and these things that you were being taught, 13 you shared what you were learning in nursing school 14 with your mother? 15 "yes. 16 "you told her that cigarette smoking was not 17 healthy for her? 18 "yes. 19 "you told her about the damaged lungs and the 20 chemicals in the tobacco smoke that you learned 21 about? 22 "yes. 23 "you told your mother if she kept up smoking, 24 she would have respiratory issues? 25 "yes, i did. 3668 1 "you told her about chronic obstructive 2 coronary disease, copd, that would get if she kept 3 smoking? 4 "correct. 5 "you told her about the possibility of cancer 6 if she kept smoking? 7 "correct. 8 "you also told your mother that there was a 9 possibility she would have to wear oxygen if she 10 kept smoking? 11 "correct. 12 did mrs. owens ever respond to martha by 13 saying, well, i saw a story somewhere else that 14 conflicted with what you just told me you learned in 15 nursing school? 16 no, not once. 17 now, martha tried to tell you she did not know 18 if her mother received the paper, but as we 19 established, mr. ellis was a paper boy. and you 20 remember when i asked if he thought his mom received 21 the paper prior to the time he was a paper boy and 22 we had that exchange over what it means to believe 23 or not believe, well, i'm not sure how mr. ellis 24 would finally define the word "believed." but 25 martha testified that her mother "believed" 3669 1 everything that anyone would tell her. remember 2 that testimony? 3 if that is true, that would include life. that 4 would include reader's digest. that would include 5 the navy exchange. it would include the warnings on 6 the packs. but more importantly, it would surely 7 include what her own flesh and blood told her. her 8 own children, including her daughter, the nurse, 9 told her over and over and over about the risks of 10 smoke and the need to quit. if she believed 11 everything that anyone would tell her, she certainly 12 would have believed everything that her son and 13 daughter told her about cigarette smoking. 14 when we talk about material information and 15 when you try to answer questions 2 and 3, page 15 of 16 your jury instructions tells you what material 17 information is. and it says: material information 18 is information that is of such importance that betty 19 owens would have considered it significant in her 20 decision-making process. 21 the information that betty owens was getting 22 from her daughter was material information. she had 23 the material information about the dangers of 24 cigarette smoking and its addictive nature. 25 so on the first prong of questions 2 and 3, was 3670 1 that -- were the dangers a secret? the plaintiff 2 cannot prove the material information about the 3 health effects or addictive nature were secrets from 4 mrs. owens. they assured me they did not. so for 5 that reason alone, the concealment claims, 6 questions 2 and 3 on your verdict form, the answer 7 has to be no on those. 8 now, that alone is enough to deal with those 9 two questions, but there is a separate reason why the 10 answer has to be no there. and the second component 11 to these is the issue of reliance. and ms. shamp 12 spent some time talking about that this morning. 13 to -- to let you know what that means, 14 jacksonville's called the "river city," and as a 15 result, jacksonville has a number of bridges -- the 16 main street bridge, the acosta bridge. to prevail 17 on questions 2 and 3, the plaintiff needs to build a 18 bridge in this courtroom. they need to build the 19 betty owens bridge. 20 and for the second part of the concealment and 21 conspiracy claims, they need to build a bridge 22 between statements, something that was said and on 23 the other side of the bridge, something mrs. owens 24 did. and they need to build that bridge with 25 evidence. 3671 1 for purposes of the verdict form, the bridge is 2 called "legal cause." it is defined as reliance. 3 and you have to decide if the reliance, if they can 4 show any, is reasonable. now, the plaintiff then 5 has to prove that reynolds' conduct caused 6 mrs. owens, not some other smoker, but mrs. owens to 7 take some action to rely on something that was or 8 was not said and then get a disease caused by smoking 9 that she otherwise would have avoided. if the 10 plaintiff cannot build that bridge, then they will 11 have failed to meet their burden of proof with 12 regard to the concealment and conspiracy claims in 13 questions 2 and 3. ladies and gentlemen, the 14 evidence you heard never let the plaintiff make the 15 first step towards building that bridge. 16 i told you in opening statement to keep this 17 question in mind: what does this have to do with 18 betty owens? dr. proctor came here and spent hours 19 telling you about statements from industry 20 representatives to the public. now, dr. figlar told 21 you that some of those positions, whether they were 22 based on science or not, were -- were clung to for 23 probably too long. and in some other smoker's case, 24 one of these other cases that dr. proctor's in, 25 maybe those statements matter. maybe they are 3672 1 relevant. but not in mrs. owens' case. 2 for the second and third claims, the plaintiff 3 has to build their bridge between something reynolds 4 said or did and mrs. owens. and mr. ellis did not 5 do that. fact witness after fact witness confirmed 6 that fact. 7 no witness testified that mrs. owens ever saw, 8 heard, read or relied on any of these things, not 9 the frank statement, nothing from ctr, tirc, ti, 10 press releases, anything from reynolds, anything 11 from brown & williamson or anything from the 12 american tobacco company. that was the evidence in 13 this case. 14 now, the plaintiff will argue that even though 15 there is no evidence specifically about betty owens 16 hearing, reading, seeing, or relying on something 17 that reynolds ever said that you can assume it 18 happened. but assumptions are not facts. someone 19 who has proof does not need to rely on an inference 20 or an assumption. but ms. shamp said, well, maybe 21 you can infer that. ladies and gentlemen, do not 22 infer something that is contrary to the facts you 23 heard in this case. 24 and i'm going to show you some of the facts in 25 betty owens' case. as mr. ellis would say when i 3673 1 asked him questions, these are what you would call 2 the one hundred percent true facts. ms. shamp asked in her 3 closing, what evidence did we put up? i'm going to 4 show you that. evidence we put up from martha. 5 "and it is fair to say you do not know anything 6 r. j. reynolds said or did that caused your mother 7 to smoke her first cigarette? 8 "since i was not born yet, no, i cannot say. i 9 do not know. 10 "your mother never talked to you about why she 11 chose a brand of cigarette; is that correct? 12 "no." 13 what evidence did we put up? this is from 14 martha. 15 "you never heard your mother say that something 16 a tobacco company said or did caused her to start 17 smoking? 18 "no. 19 "or to continue smoking? 20 "no. 21 "in fact, your mother never talked about 22 statements that she heard or read from any tobacco 23 company? 24 "no. she did not talk to me about anything, 25 no." 3674 1 what evidence did we put up? how about this 2 from mr. ellis? and this is hard to read and i'll 3 summarize. he basically said he never had any 4 conversation with his mother about tirc, ctr, frank 5 statement, any -- any contact with a tobacco 6 company, hill & knowlton, british american tobacco, 7 philip morris, lorillard, reynolds, american, 8 brown & williamson, nothing. 9 there is no evidence in this case, nothing, 10 nothing from ctr, nothing from ti, nothing from 11 reynolds or any of its companies, nothing. that is 12 the evidence that was put up here, the evidence that 13 there is no reliance because she never saw anything 14 or heard anything that they could identify in the 15 first place. 16 i thought it was interesting in her closing 17 argument, ms. shamp put up and mentioned the -- the 18 testimony before congress. and that testimony 19 before congress was in 1994. you learned that 20 mrs. owens died in 1993. she could not have relied 21 on something that happened a year after she passed. 22 now, ms. shamp did and may continue when she 23 gets up later this afternoon -- she talked about 24 filters and menthol, maybe lights and low tar. she 25 may talk about that. but you know who never did? 3675 1 mrs. owens. and there is no evidence that that stuff 2 had anything to do with her selection of brands. 3 she asked what evidence did we put up? we put up 4 this, from martha. 5 "you never heard your mother say that filtered 6 cigarettes were safer or that they were healthier? 7 "no. 8 "your mother never told you that light 9 cigarettes were healthier or that they were safer? 10 "no. 11 "you mentioned menthol cigarettes. you never 12 heard your mother say that the menthol cigarettes 13 were healthier or safer? 14 "no. 15 "your mother never said to you that low-tar or 16 low-nicotine cigarettes were healthier or that they 17 were safer? 18 "no." 19 mr. ellis told you the same thing. these are 20 the one hundred percent true facts. there is no reliance. 21 instead, what you heard, the basis for mrs. owens' 22 decisions were based on price. martha -- or 23 mr. ellis told you. 24 "and price was the primary factor in your mom 25 in her selecting a brand of cigarette, was not it? 3676 1 "i would say so. 2 "and price is the only reason you can think of 3 of why she switched from one brand of cigarette to 4 another, correct? 5 "that would probably be true." 6 her decisions were not based on anything about 7 the filters or menthol or ads or coupons or 8 statements. her decisions were based on price. 9 ms. shamp told you in her closing this morning 10 that you would get evidence that is relevant and 11 evidence that is irrelevant. i'm going to talk 12 about evidence that is irrelevant right now. and 13 that is evidence about coupons. the plaintiff 14 attempted to make a big deal out of coupons. i 15 submit that the evidence about coupons is not 16 relevant to the issues you have to decide. 17 why? well, to begin with, there is nothing 18 illegal or fraudulent about coupons. they cannot be 19 a basis of liability if they are not illegal or 20 fraudulent. and as dr. goldberg told you, there is 21 nothing materially false about the coupons. 22 he was asked by mr. carter: "have you come 23 across any examples that you believed contained 24 materially false information with respect to the 25 coupons? 3677 1 "no. they promised goods and they delivered 2 the goods. 3 "so you have never seen a materially false 4 statement in a coupon that you have reviewed for 5 reynolds? 6 "they promised the goods and they delivered the 7 goods. that was the deal. that was the deal." 8 so moreover, even though coupons were legal and 9 delivered exactly what they promised, there is no 10 evidence that they impacted mrs. owens' smoking 11 decisions. did she collect coupons? sure. i do not 12 dispute that she had them. but what does it mean? 13 this was what martha told you. 14 "now, your mother never told you that she 15 started smoking a specific brand because it offered 16 coupons, did she? 17 "no. 18 "your mother never told you that she continued 19 to smoke a brand specifically because of the 20 coupons; is that correct? 21 "correct, no. 22 "and your mother never told you that she would 23 quit smoking if not for those coupons; is that 24 correct? 25 "oh, we never had that conversation, no." 3678 1 and ken told you he could not recall mrs. owens 2 sending in coupons to get something and not getting 3 what she wanted back. that was the deal. if she 4 smoked and -- and the cigarettes she happened to 5 smoke had coupons on them, she saved them. you 6 heard she also saved the s&h green stamps. from 7 whatever else she bought, she saved the stamps and 8 she turned in those -- turned those in too. coupons 9 cannot be a basis of liability here. 10 and it is a similar story with advertisements. 11 i told you that you would see a lot of ads from 12 dr. goldberg and you did. and they were trying to 13 upset you with allegations about youth marketing and 14 casting stones about ads being used by a variety of 15 consumer goods, whether it is santa claus or the 16 military or attractive women or people having fun. 17 and they showed you documents that contained 18 demographics on teens in the 1970s and the 1980s, 19 again, trying to tick you off. 20 but remember in the '70s and '80s, betty owens 21 was what, 40s, 50s? far from youth. she was a 22 mature adult with a job, had three grown children. 23 she had raised one to be a nurse, one to be a 24 successful person in the corporate business world. 25 and the other thing about ads, dr. goldberg 3679 1 could not link any statement or ad to mrs. owens 2 because he did not know anything about her. 3 and mrs. shamp -- ms. shamp said people in the 4 public smoke because of ads. well, this case is not 5 about people in the public. this case is about 6 betty owens. and we asked the witnesses who knew 7 mrs. owens if she ever discussed advertisements with 8 them or if she ever made any smoking decision based 9 on an advertisement. every witness said no; uncle 10 bernice, ken, martha. let us look at what they said. 11 martha was asked: "your mother never talked 12 about cigarette advertisements with you, correct? 13 "no. 14 "she never told you that she started smoking a 15 specific brand of cigarettes because of an 16 advertisement that she saw? 17 "you mean -- well, my mother was growing up, 18 there were no tvs in that home, so she never saw any 19 ads on tv, so no." 20 that is evidence in this case that she did not 21 see any ad or rely on any ad, and according to 22 martha, she never even saw them because they did not 23 have a tv. 24 and it is a similar story with mr. ellis. she 25 asked, what evidence did we put up? we put up this 3680 1 evidence. 2 "now, your mother never told you that she 3 smoked a particular brand because of an 4 advertisement she saw, did she? 5 "i cannot ever recall that. 6 "and you do not recall your mother ever telling 7 you that she smoked because of tobacco advertising, 8 correct?" 9 the answer: "correct." 10 those admissions where mr. ellis and 11 ms. schofield sealed the deal on any allegation 12 about advertising. 13 the important facts for this case are that no 14 witness who knew mrs. owens testified that she ever 15 smoked a brand of cigarette because of an ad or a 16 slogan or any statement by r. j. reynolds, not the 17 kool jazz festival, not nascar racing, not the 18 beverly hillbillies and not joe camel. 19 you heard a lot about joe camel both ways in 20 this case. the truth is at the time of the joe 21 camel campaign, mrs. owens was in her 40s and her 22 50s. nobody testified that she saw the joe camel 23 campaign. nobody testified that she smoked camel 24 cigarettes because of the joe camel campaign. and 25 over this back and forth, over what the stats show 3681 1 and what was in this book, what was in this, if you 2 look at anything on joe camel, look at am 2645. 3 that is a june 1994 study from the ftc, after the 4 surgeon general's report that ms. shamp mentioned 5 this morning. 6 and the ftc concludes -- you remember, 7 mr. carter did this with dr. goldberg. and the ftc 8 concluded, you know, look, we would like to think 9 that joe camel got kids to smoke and it really drove 10 initiation. but we looked at it, we investigated it 11 and the conclusion is it did not. 12 ladies and gentlemen, i do not want to go back 13 and forth all day on joe camel because it has 14 nothing to do with betty owens, but that was the 15 fact you heard from the ftc about joe camel. 16 and when it came to mrs. owens' choices with 17 cigarettes and brands, the only thing that mattered 18 to her was price. 19 another thing about advertisements, every 20 advertisement the plaintiff showed you in this case 21 was a legal advertisement. in fact, you will remember 22 dr. goldberg said he had not really looked at sports 23 illustrated, but for some reason this year, he 24 happened to pick up the swimsuit issue. do you 25 remember that? and he started to talk about it. 3682 1 and the judge cut him off and instructed you that 2 reynolds has not broken any law with sports 3 illustrated and ordered you to disregard 4 dr. goldberg's testimony. 5 but the final point on advertising is the 6 instruction you have in your jury instructions. 7 page 18, second paragraph, the court instructed you: 8 manufacturing and selling and advertising cigarettes 9 is a lawful activity. i, therefore, instruct you 10 that r. j. reynolds cannot be held liable for merely 11 manufacturing, selling or advertising cigarettes. 12 the plaintiff knew that was the instruction. 13 and worse yet, they knew that advertising had 14 nothing to do with mrs. owens' decisions, but they 15 still spent hour upon hour showing you ads in the 16 hope that it would upset you. 17 now, throughout the course of this trial, you 18 did hear two things that i think the plaintiff may 19 come back this afternoon and say, well, this shows 20 you that mrs. owens thought something different. 21 and you heard that when she was diagnosed with lung 22 cancer, they said that she did not believe she had 23 lung cancer. well, if mrs. owens really believed 24 everything that anyone told her, you would have to ask, 25 would she have believed her doctors; would she have 3683 1 believed when they told her those facts, when those 2 facts were the same ones that her daughter martha 3 had told her throughout her life? and finally, if 4 you do not think you have lung cancer, why would you 5 proceed with chemotherapy and radiation and lung 6 surgery? 7 second, i think martha testified that on one 8 occasion her mom told her that the government 9 would not allow something to be sold if it was 10 harmful. now, mr. ellis told you that mrs. owens 11 was skeptical of the government, but martha told you 12 she would not -- she did not think the government 13 would allow something to be sold that was harmful. 14 either way, it does not matter for -- for purposes of 15 this case. mr. ellis has a beef with the government 16 for selling cigarettes. that is not an issue in this 17 case. 18 ladies and gentlemen, use your common sense and 19 focus on the facts about betty owens. when the 20 plaintiff cannot produce a single witness to say 21 mrs. owens heard, read, saw and, most importantly, 22 relied on anything reynolds said or did not say, 23 do not infer otherwise. because when you get this 24 question, did concealment of information cause 25 mrs. owens' death, the answer has to be no. if 3684 1 there was any evidence that betty owens relied on 2 any statement from reynolds, do not you think they 3 would have given that information to dr. proctor or 4 dr. goldberg so they could talk about it? of 5 course, they would have. but they did not because 6 they cannot. that evidence does not exist in this 7 case. that is why ms. shamp kept talking about the 8 public and other smokers and not about betty owens. 9 now, after listening to dr. proctor and 10 dr. goldberg, it is not surprising that mr. ellis, on 11 the witness stand, spouted out a couple times 12 saying, well, there is conflicting stories. i 13 believe he probably picked that up here at trial 14 because there was no proof in his deposition or no 15 proof on the witness stand that his mom ever saw, 16 heard or relied on such a conflicting story. 17 where was the proof? there is not any. that 18 piece of the puzzle is completely missing from their 19 burden of proof. otherwise, mr. ellis and martha 20 would have shown it to you. this case is only about 21 mrs. owens, and there is no evidence at all that she 22 relied or heard statements from r. j. reynolds. 23 and no matter what some other smoker in some 24 other case might have done, the plaintiff has to 25 prove in this case that mrs. owens did. he has to 3685 1 provide the puzzle pieces. he did not. there is no 2 betty owens bridge in this case between statements 3 from reynolds and some action from mrs. owens. 4 there is no evidence. there is no proof of reliance. 5 and that is the one hundred percent true fact in this case. 6 can i get the elmo again, please? thank you. 7 so if you look at your verdict form, 8 questions 2 and 3, because mrs. owens knew the 9 material facts about the health effects and 10 addictive nature of smoking, the answer must be no. 11 and because there is no reliance or what is called 12 "legal cause" on anything reynolds said or did, the 13 answer has to be no. 14 so for those reasons, the only answer on 15 question 2 and question 3 is no. 16 i want to address a couple other points. i 17 told you in opening that the plaintiff would 18 overreach and force pieces into spots where they 19 do not fit and try to create pieces to fill in for 20 those that are missing. and i think he did it. 21 and one i want to talk about was one that 22 ms. shamp stressed in her closing and that is the 23 national enquirer. the national enquirer, a 24 magazine known for preposterous stories that elvis 25 is still alive; the next royal baby is going to have 3686 1 two heads; president obama's visited by martians, 2 whatever they have on a week-to-week basis. 3 and the plaintiff's story in this case was that 4 there was an article that ran in the national 5 enquirer that was a reprint of an article that ran 6 in true, and the article in the national enquirer 7 was -- said it was authored by charles golden. and 8 dr. proctor said that charles golden was a 9 fictitious name made up by hill & knowlton. 10 now, i do not dispute that mrs. owens read the 11 national enquirer. but no one suggested that 12 mrs. owens ever saw, read or heard that article that 13 appeared one time in the national enquirer or 14 discussed it with mr. ellis or ms. schofield, no 15 one. 16 now, martha did suggest that her mom may have 17 believed a different story about a woman turning 18 into a snake. she never suggested that her mother 19 heard or read any article in the national enquirer 20 about smoking. 21 and even if she had seen it, you would have to 22 decide if relying on a single article in the 23 national enquirer over the decades of health 24 warnings in the reader's digest that she read and 25 collected, the life she read and collected, the 3687 1 local newspapers that ken delivered, the information 2 on her cigarette packs, the information at the 3 checkout counter at the navy base and the constant 4 hounding from her children, you would have to decide if 5 that one article, if she saw it, it would be 6 reasonable to rely on that compared to everything 7 else. 8 again, getting back to the burden of proof, 9 what is the more persuasive and convincing force 10 there? i submit it cannot be that somebody would 11 rely on something in the national enquirer over the 12 wealth of other information that she had. 13 but this attempt to really create something out 14 of the national enquirer, all it really did was 15 expose two of the plaintiff's experts, dr. proctor 16 and dr. goldberg. this is what dr. proctor said 17 first. 18 "and that is exactly what my next question is. 19 i believe you said twice on direct and now again 20 that charles golden was not a real person and it was 21 a fictitious name, correct? 22 "yes. 23 "and you said it was invented by hill & 24 knowlton to conceal the fact that it was a version 25 of the stanley frank story, correct? 3688 1 "i think that is basically correct." 2 so dr. proctor said hill & knowlton invented 3 charles golden. 4 so on cross, you will remember mr. carter showed 5 him an article from the national enquirer from 6 1963 -- or from 1967 that linked a murder in miami 7 to the jfk assassination in 1963. and when 8 mr. carter showed dr. proctor that, dr. proctor had 9 to come clean. 10 and mr. carter asked him: "so you had not 11 bothered to look at the national enquirer to see if 12 charles golden existed and if he had written other 13 stories for the national enquirer before you came in 14 and told the jury that he was created by tobacco 15 companies for that story, did you?" 16 and dr. proctor said: "that is correct." 17 now, i think the plaintiff was not pleased that 18 that puzzle piece got ripped apart, and so i think 19 they tried to have dr. goldberg tape it back 20 together for them. so what they did is they 21 spoon-fed him documents the day before he testified 22 so -- documents he did not have at his deposition, 23 documents not on his reliance list, and they asked 24 him to clean up the mess that dr. proctor created. 25 this is what dr. goldberg said. 3689 1 "the national enquirer article, had you seen 2 that prior to yesterday? 3 "no. 4 "and, in fact, the first time you reviewed 5 those documents as a group to offer the opinions you 6 gave today was yesterday, correct? 7 "that is correct. 8 "they were provided to you by ms. shamp; is 9 that true? 10 "yes." 11 but that puzzle piece still did not fit. look 12 at what dr. goldberg said. 13 "is it your testimony that the tobacco industry 14 created charles golden as a cover for mr. frank, 15 that his identity and his use of a pseudonym was one 16 that was created by hill & knowlton? 17 "no. it was created by the national enquirer." 18 i do not think the national enquirer means 19 anything in this case, but those are the facts you 20 heard from their witnesses on two different stories 21 about who created it or who did not. and no matter 22 that, nobody ever said mrs. owens saw it. 23 so inquiring minds want to know, why did 24 dr. proctor stretch the story without checking the 25 facts first? and inquiring minds want to know, why 3690 1 did plaintiff's counsel have to give the documents 2 to dr. goldberg the night before he testified? and 3 inquiring minds want to know, why spend so much 4 effort on an article that neither ken nor martha 5 said mrs. owens ever saw or read? 6 and the answer, it was another attempt by the 7 plaintiff to force a puzzle piece, or worse, make 8 one where it does not exist because there is 9 absolutely no evidence that mrs. owens ever saw that 10 article or could have reasonably relied on an 11 article in the national enquirer. it is a misshapen 12 puzzle piece that does not fit in this case. 13 but that was not the only puzzle piece the 14 plaintiff tried to create. mr. ellis created his 15 own puzzle piece and sent it to his uncle bernice. 16 you saw mr. ellis's letter. you will have it in 17 evidence. it is ara 2091. 18 now, before bernice gave a deposition in this 19 case, a deposition you got to see, mr. ellis sent 20 him a letter to "jog his memory." but on the stand, 21 mr. ellis is like, i sat down five, ten minutes and 22 just sent it to him. but i do not know how good a 23 typist he is, but that is pretty good to pound that 24 out in five or ten minutes if you are not really 25 giving it any thought. 3691 1 but mr. ellis also said that mr. birdwell, he 2 could not read or write very well. well, why send 3 him a letter? either way, the letter contained 4 facts mr. ellis wanted to plant with his 5 uncle bernice. 6 now, one fact he got right in here was where he 7 said his mom smoked because she enjoyed it. but you 8 know that there were many facts in this letter that 9 were just fraud. wrong as to how much mrs. owens 10 smoked. wrong as to how many times she tried to 11 quit. and wrong as to what she did to try to quit. 12 all of the things he wrote in that letter would have 13 made their case here better if they were true, but 14 they were not. 15 ms. shamp said this morning she wanted to talk 16 about the truth. mr. ellis did not want to talk 17 about the truth in that letter to his uncle bernice. 18 now, not only were many of the statements in 19 that letter just wrong; they were directly contrary 20 to what mr. ellis had testified to under oath. so 21 inquiring minds want to know, why send the letter to 22 someone that you know contains wrong information and 23 is contrary to your own sworn testimony? inquiring 24 minds want to know, why fail to mention that you 25 sent the letter to your uncle in your deposition, 3692 1 and why did not you save a copy of it? the answer is 2 simple. the letter was an attempt by mr. ellis to 3 put words in his uncle's mouth, to make puzzle 4 pieces for use in this trial. 5 but you got to see and hear his uncle bernice. 6 you heard what he said about the letter. and you 7 heard what he said about his relationship with 8 mr. ellis. you can judge who to believe. 9 these pieces that the plaintiff tried to 10 manufacture in this case only bring his 11 believability and the credibility of their experts 12 into question. they do not help meet his burden of 13 proof, and instead, they shine a spotlight on the 14 gaping holes in this case and further support a 15 verdict in favor of reynolds. 16 now, if you get beyond the first three 17 questions, you will get to question 4 on comparative 18 fault. if you get there, you will have had to 19 decide that mrs. owens died of adenocarcinoma caused 20 from smoking, that she was addicted, that addiction 21 was a legal cause of her death and that reynolds' 22 conduct was the legal cause of her death. and i 23 submit that the evidence i'm showing you today that 24 you saw during the trial does not allow you to get to 25 this question. 3693 1 but if you do, you will have to allocate 2 responsibility between reynolds and mrs. owens. the 3 question is the allegation of -- allocation of fault 4 for her death. and there are a couple points to 5 keep in mind. the assignment of fault relegates 6 only to actions that were a legal cause of 7 mrs. owens' death. and r. j. reynolds cannot be 8 assigned fault for actions that were not a legal 9 cause of mrs. owens' death. these points are in 10 your instructions and they are very important. 11 comparative fault is not a global comparison of 12 conduct. it is not what did betty owens do over the 13 course of her life versus the global conduct of the 14 tobacco industry. it is a comparison of actions of 15 betty owens and r. j. reynolds that were the legal 16 cause of her death. it is a very narrow inquiry. 17 now, you may have seen things throughout this 18 trial that the tobacco company said in public or 19 wrote internally that you do not like, but the issue 20 in this case is whether they affected betty owens 21 and caused her death. if you find that something 22 reynolds did was wrong and you do not like it, but is 23 it connected to betty owens, it cannot be considered 24 part of your analysis under comparative fault. 25 now, ms. shamp raised the issue of the brands 3694 1 that mrs. owens smoked. and i told you that they 2 would have the burden of proving the brands she 3 smoked, when she smoked them, how long she smoked 4 them, why she smoked them. now, both mr. ellis and 5 ms. schofield identified a number of different 6 brands, but neither one of them could tell you how 7 long she smoked any of them. 8 you saw from martha. 9 "you observed that she would often buy 10 cigarettes that were on sale at the base? 11 "correct. 12 "and, now, the brand she bought depended on 13 whether the brand was on special at the base that 14 week? 15 "correct. 16 "but of those, there was not any particular 17 brand that you observed that would be her regular 18 brand? 19 "no. 20 "sometimes it would change from week to week, 21 sometimes two weeks it was the same? 22 "correct." 23 mr. ellis told you. 24 "you do not know what your mom's favorite brand 25 of cigarettes was, do you? 3695 1 "no. i have no idea of her favorite. 2 "and that is because she switched brands all the 3 time, right? 4 "well, she rotated with a certain more than 5 others. 6 "she never told you that she had a favorite 7 brand of cigarette, did she? 8 "we did not talk about cigarettes like that, 9 no." 10 then he was asked: "and you cannot put a time 11 frame on when she smoked any of those brands to the 12 exclusion of any other brand, correct? 13 "probably not. 14 "and you cannot tell us the order in which your 15 mother smoked any of the brands that she smoked, can 16 you? 17 "i did not study it that hard to know that 18 answer. no. i would say no. 19 "so you cannot identify a decade in which she 20 smoked any particular brand of cigarette? 21 "i just said i do not have the answer." 22 plaintiff failed to prove how long mrs. owens 23 smoked any of my client's brands. now, ms. shamp 24 pointed out to you a stipulation, a stipulation that 25 two other companies, lorillard and philip morris, 3696 1 that their brands were not a legal cause, and i'm not 2 here to tell you they were. but what i am here to 3 tell you is that stipulation does not say reynolds' 4 brands were a legal cause, and it is their obligation 5 to prove that. just because other companies are not 6 in this case, it does not mean we are responsible for 7 every other bit of smoking without them proving what 8 it was. 9 so that is something to keep in mind in this 10 case if you have to allocate fault for the acts that 11 caused mrs. owens' death because reynolds can only 12 be responsible for its conduct and its cigarettes. 13 so when they cannot even identify the decade that she 14 smoked any one of them, please consider that. 15 now, leaving the brand identification and 16 smoking history aside, mrs. ellis's [sic] attorneys 17 and ms. shamp today tried to play this question a 18 little cute, and they say it is up to you to 19 determine if mrs. owens is responsible at all. but 20 she never accepted or acknowledged any 21 responsibility for mrs. owens' decision to start 22 smoking and continue smoking, despite the knowledge 23 of the risks and ken and martha's nagging and 24 hounding, never. no responsibility at all for 25 someone who made her own decisions and did what she 3697 1 wanted to without regard to the risk to her health. 2 i come back to the words of their experts. 3 "dr. burns, you have said many times that smokers 4 are responsible for their own smoking behavior, 5 correct? 6 "that is correct. 7 "and even if they are addicted, the smokers are 8 still responsible for their own smoking behavior, 9 correct? 10 "that is correct. the fact that someone's 11 addicted is a barrier to behavioral change, but it 12 does not free them from responsibility for their own 13 behavior." 14 dr. burns says smokers remain responsible. he 15 does not say reynolds does. and -- and look at how 16 mrs. owens accepted responsibility during her life, 17 without blaming anyone. she left school. she got 18 married and accepted the responsibility of starting 19 a family when she was a teenager. 20 when her first husband killed herself [sic], 21 she did not seek to blame anyone. she got a job and 22 she accepted the responsibility of raising ken and 23 martha. 24 when she remarried, had another child and 25 ultimately decided to divorce mr. owens, she did not 3698 1 blame anyone. she accepted the responsibility of 2 raising three children, getting her ged and getting 3 a job. 4 now, ms. shamp has pointed out through a number 5 of witnesses in this trial that i called this 6 "street smarts" and i did. i did not call it street 7 smart as a way to demean mrs. owens, but as a way to 8 praise her. maybe instead of "street smarts," i 9 should have called all these accomplishments a sign 10 that she had and took personal responsibility 11 because that is what she did. when she was diagnosed 12 with lung cancer, she never placed the blame on 13 reynolds or any other tobacco company. you heard 14 martha on that. 15 "ms. schofield, last question. your mother 16 never blamed the tobacco companies for her decision 17 to smoke, did she? 18 "we never had a conversation of any kind 19 whatsoever like that, no." 20 and you know that mrs. owens never told 21 mr. ellis that she blamed the tobacco companies. in 22 fact, for 17 years after her death, it never entered 23 mr. ellis's mind to sue until he saw something in 24 the paper and embarked on what he said is a 25 vindictive personal vendetta. 3699 1 if mrs. owens had to assign responsibility, 2 would she accept it? of course, she would. 3 mrs. owens faced adult matters, she made adult 4 choices and she shouldered adult responsibilities 5 her entire life. smoking was no different. she is 6 responsible for her decision to choose to smoke and 7 keep smoking despite knowledge of the risks. and 8 she is responsible for the injuries she suffered 9 because of those choices. 10 i showed you a slide earlier for mr. ellis. 11 and you remember he said this: "when you are an 12 adult, whatever decision you do is your decision. 13 ultimately, you are the one who has control over 14 your decisions." 15 that is what dr. burns says and that is what 16 mr. ellis says. they do not say you have ten percent 17 control, they do not say you have fifty percent control, 18 but you have one hundred percent control of your decisions. 19 nobody made mrs. owens' decisions for her. 20 nobody could decide for her to choose to smoke, and 21 nobody could choose for her to stop smoking, not 22 burns, not martha and not ken. only mrs. owens 23 could make her adult decisions. 24 as mr. ellis told you, she was going to do what 25 she wanted to do, and there was not anything you 3700 1 could say to make her stop. she had the control and 2 she had the responsibility. so if you get to that 3 point on the verdict form, i ask you to give 4 mrs. owens one hundred percent responsibility for her 5 conduct. 6 now, i've got a couple minutes left. if you 7 find everything that i've said this afternoon 8 unpersuasive and decide to return a verdict for 9 mr. ellis, you will have to decide on an amount of 10 damages in question 5, an amount that you want to 11 award him for his mother's death 21 years ago. and 12 this is hard. we all feel compassion. it is sad 13 whenever anybody loses a loved one, and we all wish 14 mr. ellis the best, but compassion and good wishes 15 are not reasons to exceed common sense and good 16 judgment. 17 your instruction will tell you there is no 18 exact standard and that any such award should be 19 fair and just in light of the evidence. ms. shamp 20 did not suggest an amount. and it is not a question 21 of whether the defendant is a big company or not. 22 if you find reynolds liable, it is a question about 23 what damages mr. ellis and his sister have as a 24 result of their mother's death. and, again, your 25 instruction will say you need to be fair and just in 3701 1 light of the evidence. 2 the evidence you heard was that mr. ellis was 3 41 when his mother died and martha was 43. the 4 evidence you heard is that this lawsuit was not 5 martha's idea. the you evidence you heard was that 6 becky's family does not even know about the lawsuit. 7 the evidence you heard is that nobody has sought 8 counseling or grief therapy in the 21 years she is 9 been gone. you heard no evidence about any expenses 10 that mr. ellis or ms. schofield have. and the 11 evidence you heard is that mrs. owens was not 12 financially supporting either ken or martha at the 13 time of her death and had not been for over two 14 decades prior to that. 15 so that is the evidence you have to consider. 16 so if you make an award and you decide to compensate 17 mr. ellis, please compensate him based on the 18 evidence you heard, using your common sense and good 19 judgment. 20 finally, if you get all the way through the 21 verdict form, you have to decide whether punitive 22 damages are warranted. now, if we get that far, you 23 will have already fully compensated mr. ellis for 24 his mother's death. punitive damages are not about 25 compensation or making someone whole. punitive 3702 1 damages are about more money for mr. ellis. they 2 are damages in addition to damages that fully 3 compensate him. they can be awarded only for 4 conduct that was a legal cause of the harms suffered 5 by the plaintiff, and punitive damages cannot be 6 based on the findings. 7 now, since the plaintiff continues to stress 8 the findings, let me stress this: and this is in 9 the instructions that the judge gave you this 10 morning on page 21. it will tell you: the engle 11 findings may not be considered in any way when 12 determining whether punitive damages may be 13 warranted. you cannot consider the engle findings 14 in any way to make that determination, not at all. 15 ms. shamp said, punitive damages are designed 16 to punish and deter, punish for conduct that is 17 tantamount to reckless disregard for human life. 18 and to prove it, the plaintiff must meet a higher 19 level of proof called "clear and convincing 20 evidence." page 20 of your jury instructions talk 21 about it and i pulled it out here. 22 clear and convincing evidence differs from the 23 greater weight of the evidence in that it is more 24 compelling and persuasive. it requires evidence 25 that is precise, explicit, lacking in confusion and 3703 1 of such weight that it produces a firm belief or 2 conviction about the matter in issue. 3 when considering this, consider the testimony 4 you have heard. consider what you heard from 5 dr. proctor. he told you that dr. rodgman at 6 reynolds used the best available science to identify 7 constituents of cigarette smoke. his research was 8 excellent. he did not keep the research secret. and 9 the 1964 surgeon general's report relied on that 10 research. 11 you heard from dr. proctor. you heard from 12 dr. figlar. dr. rodgman was the first person to 13 identify many of the compounds and constituents in 14 cigarette smoke. he published the methods reynolds 15 invented to identify the constituents, submitted 16 them to the surgeon general's committee and even 17 gave a speech to the american chemical society 18 talking about them and drawing the compounds. 19 now, the plaintiff subpoenaed dr. figlar to be 20 here. he is the one witness who was not getting paid 21 to be here. and i'm glad you got to hear from him. 22 and please consider dr. figlar's testimony about 23 what he and others before him at reynolds have done 24 for decades to develop tobacco products that may 25 reduce risk and also talked about what reynolds has 3704 1 done in his time there. 2 dr. proctor also talked about other 3 contributions that the tobacco companies made, 4 larson, haag and sylvette. remember the green 5 monster? said it was a comprehensive account of the 6 world literature, summarized thousands of articles, 7 included information that was both favorable and 8 unfavorable. and it was also relied upon by the 9 surgeon general in the 1964 report. and dr. proctor 10 said he still uses not only the green monster, but 11 the red one, the blue one and the yellow one. 12 you also heard about reynolds' cooperation with 13 the public health community. you heard about the 14 nci's tobacco working group that reynolds 15 participated in from ten years, from 1968 until 16 1978, when the government shut it down. you heard 17 that reynolds has spent a fortune to make cigarettes 18 less hazardous and develop reduced-risk products. 19 and you heard that reynolds addressed every 20 suggestion from the public health community. in the 21 1970s, the low-tar medium-nicotine cigarettes, they 22 were suggested by the surgeon general, the nci and 23 dr. russell, who you heard was a pioneer in this 24 area. reynolds explored those things. 25 and it is interesting because i -- remember, i 3705 1 asked dr. figlar, in the surgeon general's report -- 2 and i held up the 2014. i'm like, does it tell you 3 in here what to do to make cigarettes safe or safer? 4 and he said no. if they did, reynolds would try to 5 do it. 6 and interestingly, while ms. shamp read 7 dr. figlar lots of quotes from the surgeon general's 8 reports that had nothing to do with cigarette 9 design, she never asked dr. figlar about this chart 10 on cigarette design in the 1979 surgeon general's 11 report. and i know it is really hard to read, but 12 you recall that dr. figlar walked you through this, 13 and he talked about all these different efforts that 14 reynolds had taken, some on their own, some at the 15 suggestion of the public health community and these 16 were efforts designed to try to make the cigarette 17 safer. 18 and where these ones were identified with a 19 plus or two pluses, these are ones that the surgeon 20 general gave a thumbs up to and said, this is a good 21 development; this is a step in the right direction. 22 in the 1980s, you saw reynolds' efforts and the 23 focus on -- on cigarettes that heat and did not burn 24 tobacco, with premier and then eclipse. and you 25 heard that reynolds still sells eclipse today, even 3706 1 though they lose money on every pack. dr. figlar 2 told you it is because they are committed to the idea 3 and think it is a step in the right direction. 4 you heard that reynolds discovered a way to 5 cure tobacco to lower tobacco-specific nitrosamines. 6 you remember how they talked about they noticed the 7 heat exchange and where it was coming back and it 8 was leading to higher tobacco-specific nitrosamines? 9 so reynolds came up with a way to change it so that 10 it lowered tobacco-specific nitrosamines. and 11 reynolds shared their research work. 12 and no matter what ms. shamp says now, during 13 the entire time mrs. owens was alive, the public 14 health community, including dr. burns, encouraged 15 reynolds to make lower tar and nicotine cigarettes. 16 you also heard about reynolds' involvement and 17 the -- and the tobacco industry's involvement in 18 publication. now, ctr, dr. proctor would call it 19 distraction research, but he had to admit that it 20 produced over 7,000 peer-reviewed articles. it had 21 research on -- it had substantial influence on the 22 public health community. the grantees were cited 23 repeatedly in the surgeon general's reports and that 24 the research funded 10 nobel laureates. 25 you heard about reynolds' publications that 3707 1 have been cited in -- in the surgeon general's 2 reports from the first one in 1964 till the most 3 recent one in 2014. 4 and dr. figlar told you that reynolds has taken 5 up dozens of patents, patents that are not secret, 6 but they are available for anybody to look at. 7 you saw that reynolds published a big book on 8 premier, the premier monograph, and it published a 9 book called the biology of nicotine that talked 10 about nicotinic receptors in the brain. 11 and in addition to traditional cigarettes, 12 dr. figlar talked about reynolds' mission to 13 transform tobacco, other focusing on snus and 14 e-cigarettes and nicotine replacement therapy. and 15 they are even now using tobacco technology to develop 16 drugs for diseases such as ebola. 17 ladies and gentlemen, this is not a record of a 18 wanton conduct or reckless disregard for human life. 19 this is a record of trying to lower the risks of an 20 inherently risky, but always lawful product. it is a 21 record of contributing to science that has been 22 recognized by the public health community. there 23 were some successes and there were some failures, 24 but they tried. and in trying to lower the risks of 25 an inherently risky -- i'm sorry. and in trying to 3708 1 lower the risks of an inherently risky, but legal 2 product, it should not be punished or deterred. 3 you also heard of an industry that reynolds had 4 changed and evolved to take steps in the last couple 5 decades. you heard that there was an agreement that 6 disbanded the organizations you heard about from 7 decades ago -- the ctr, ti and tirc. those 8 organizations are gone. the employees you heard so 9 much about, teague and horrigan and rodgman, they 10 long ago left the company and some of them are dead. 11 ms. shamp started today by talking about 12 documents. and one of the things she said is this 13 case is unparalleled because of the amount of 14 documents. even though they claim that documents 15 were destroyed, you have an unparalleled amount of 16 documents. and dr. proctor talked about previously 17 secret documents that are secrets no more. there is 18 a public website with millions and millions of 19 documents available. 20 when this trial is over, if you want to -- the 21 judge will let you -- you can go online, and you can 22 look at any document you want from reynolds. it is 23 online. you can do it in the comfort of your own 24 home. 25 now, if the company position on smoking and 3709 1 health and addiction throughout the years angers 2 you, dr. figlar told you that reynolds' position 3 changed over a decade ago, when it admitted that 4 smoking caused cancer and was addictive. and in the 5 past, industry representatives, they would challenge 6 the new surgeon general's reports, but not anymore. 7 you saw that reynolds has a link to the newest and 8 even the most recent surgeon general's reports on 9 its website and refers the public to them. 10 dr. proctor talked about industry restrictions, 11 and dr. figlar discussed how the many fda 12 regulations impact his job on a daily basis. 13 reynolds meets with the fda scientists and presents 14 to them and other government organizations on 15 product development. and those organizations 16 have not told reynolds, take this out of smoking and 17 make it safe, do this with that, get rid of this 18 combination. 19 looking at all of this, there is no need to 20 punish or deter for changes that have already taken 21 place over a decade ago. so if you get to this 22 point and you have already fully compensated 23 mr. ellis, i suggest that the evidence does not 24 justify awarding more money. with the higher 25 standard of proof of clear and convincing, i suggest 3710 1 that that standard will not be met. 2 and so if you get to question 6 -- 3 may i have the elmo, please? 4 thank you. 5 if you get to question 6, based on all the 6 evidence you have heard in this case, i submit that 7 your answer should be no. 8 in jury selection, each of you committed to 9 holding the plaintiff to his burden of proof, and if 10 the evidence warranted, committed to your ability to 11 enter a verdict in favor of my client. at the end 12 of this trial, the evidence compels a verdict in 13 reynolds' favor on every question. on the question 14 of the cause of death, on the question of whether 15 mrs. owens was addicted and on the question of what 16 was the legal cause of her death, the plaintiff 17 failed to meet its burden. 18 mrs. owens made adult decisions on adult 19 matters her entire life. she persevered and she 20 provided. she did what she had to do for her 21 family, and she did what she wanted to do for 22 herself. and one of those decisions was her 23 decision to smoke. but do not reward the plaintiff 24 by making mrs. owens a victim in this lawsuit 25 because of her decisions. 3711 1 this is the only and last chance i get to speak 2 with you. as the plaintiff had the burden of proof, 3 when i sit down, ms. shamp gets to get up and give 4 you a rebuttal. because i cannot respond to her, i 5 would ask one of you to be my advocate in the jury 6 room. you have seen throughout the last two weeks how 7 we have responded throughout this trial to give you 8 the other side of the story. and as you deliberate, 9 i ask you to keep the full story in mind and answer 10 ms. shamp as you think i would. 11 ladies and gentlemen, i'm going to end as i've 12 begun every stage of this trial and that is by 13 thanking you. i have enjoyed having the opportunity 14 to present this case to you. it is frustrating that 15 i do not get to talk to you personally and -- and get 16 your feelings about this. but i know you have done 17 your job, i know you have paid attention, and i know 18 you will do the right thing. and for your service 19 to this community and this county and this process, 20 we thank you very much.
