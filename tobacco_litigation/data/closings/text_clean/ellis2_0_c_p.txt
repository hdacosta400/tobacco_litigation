7 ms. shamp: thank you, your honor. 8 good morning, ladies and gentlemen. first i 9 want to thank you. this has been a pretty long two 10 and-a-half weeks, and a lot of evidence has been 11 presented to you, and i know that you were paying 12 attention. you were listening and you were taking 13 notes. 14 and so what i'm not going to do today is to 15 rehash all of the evidence that is been presented, 16 because i know that you were paying attention. but 17 what i do want to do this morning is to try and put 18 some of the evidence that you have been presented in 19 perspective, and i want to talk in detail about what 20 it is that you are going to be called upon to decide, 21 because you have got a lot of evidence that is 22 relevant to the questions that are on the verdict 23 form that the court just talked to you about, and 24 you have got evidence that is irrelevant and that 25 you are not going to be needing to decide. so what i 3533 1 want to do today is to talk about some of those 2 things. 3 now, when i got up here in the very beginning 4 of the case you will remember i said that you are going 5 to hear a lot of evidence, and some of it would 6 sound like a movie script. and you did. 7 you heard evidence about destroying documents. 8 you will remember that the evidence was presented. 9 and every time when i'm talking today you will see 10 that there is a number on the bottom of the screen 11 for the exhibit number. and you will have back with 12 you binders, and all of these documents will be back 13 in evidence with you so that you can look at them. 14 and you will remember p287. 15 once it becomes clear that such action is 16 necessary for the successful defense of our present 17 and future suits we will promptly remove all such 18 reports from our files. 19 you remember i asked dr. figlar about that. 20 and you saw documents about deceit. absolute 21 deceit committed against the american public. the 22 false and misleading advertising regarding filter- 23 tip cigarettes where the conclusion of the report to 24 congress was that cigarette manufacturers have 25 deceived the american public through their 3534 1 advertising of filter-tip cigarettes. 2 and you heard evidence about deception. you 3 heard evidence about how r.j. reynolds knew that 4 there were carcinogens in their tobacco smoke, that 5 they knew that there was a link between smoking and 6 lung cancer, and they submitted the frank statement 7 that went through -- and you saw how many newspapers 8 that was published in. and you will have those 9 documents where they said to the american public 10 that there is no proof that cigarette smoking is one 11 of the causes of lung cancer. 12 and you saw evidence of fraud. you saw these 13 documents where it said that very few consumers are 14 aware of the effects of nicotine because we have not 15 told them its addictive nature and that nicotine is 16 poison. they knew that their own customers did not 17 know this. 18 and you saw evidence of greed. it is fortunate 19 for us that cigarettes are a habit they cannot break. 20 it is fortunate for us because we make a fortune off 21 of it. you saw evidence of nicotine manipulation. 22 you saw their documents where they indicated they 23 were manipulating nicotine levels. 24 you saw evidence of conspiracy, where the very 25 heads of the greatest corporations themselves 3535 1 signalized the end of the old days when they linked 2 arms and walked together to consult with us. 3 i told you you would see evidence of a story of 4 greed that is unparalleled in american history. 5 unparalleled because of the scope of it, how long it 6 went on. unparalleled because of the amount of 7 documents that we now know, and that you are 8 entitled to see. and unparalleled in the cost of 9 human life. and you will have with you the surgeon 10 general's report where it talks about the cost of 11 that life. 12 and you will have that entire report from 2014. 13 you should look at it. it is exhibit 799. more than 14 20 million premature deaths are attributable to 15 smoking, and smoking-attributable mortality is 16 estimated to be about 480,000 a year. that is 1200 17 people in america, in america every day as a result 18 of smoking cigarettes. 19 and through the evidence we told you the story 20 about greed; how in the 1950's, when more than 50 21 percent of americans smoked cigarettes, when it was 22 advertised by athletes, celebrities, on television 23 programs, on cartoons, that wynder and graham 24 painted tobacco tar on the back of mice and 25 discovered that in more than sixty percent of the mice 3536 1 tumors developed, and that this was big news, and 2 that big tobacco was scared. 3 and so they sent their own researchers to 4 investigate what do we know, and claude teague came 5 up with this is what we know. and you will remember 6 he surveyed all the literature out there, and he 7 reported this to r.j. reynolds, that the studies 8 tend to confirm the relationship between heavy and 9 prolonged tobacco smoking and cancer of the lung. 10 1953 they knew that. and that benzpyrene and 11 (a)benzpyrene, both carcinogens, were identified in 12 distillates of cigarette smoke. r.j. reynolds knew 13 that. and they came to a fork in the road. they 14 came to a fork in the road and they decided to lie. 15 i suspect that you are going to hear a lot from 16 mr. geise in his closing argument about choice. and 17 i think this case is about choice. the choice they 18 made to lie. 19 they were the ones who had the power and 20 resources to know about their product, and they had 21 an obligation to tell us. and there is no dispute 22 about that. and that is fraud. 23 and remember, dr. figlar himself, when he came 24 and testified, said, all right -- i asked him: all 25 right. now, you agree, do not you, that r.j. 3537 1 reynolds has a responsibility to tell its customers 2 what it knows about the health consequences of the 3 use of its -- of the product it sells? he says, i 4 mean, i believe so, yeah. and you agree that it has 5 a duty to tell the truth? and he said, sure, yes. 6 and a duty to disclose what it knows. there is no 7 dispute about that, that they had a duty to tell. 8 and they lied. 9 they came to a fork in the road in the choices 10 they made, with the evidence that you have heard. and 11 you heard about how they lied and what they decided 12 to do. 13 they denied that cigarette smoking was 14 dangerous. and you saw the press releases. you saw 15 the individuals that went on television, ann browder 16 and cullman, denying it. and they declared that 17 there was doubt. and you will remember the papers 18 that they sent out, the white papers, declaring that 19 there was doubt about the harmfulness. 20 and they deceived the american public by vowing 21 to take out any harmful elements if they found it. 22 the great filter lie that kept america smoking. it 23 was hugely successful. and you will remember that 24 witnesses talked about that, about how many people 25 during that decade switched to filters, because they 3538 1 believed that that was not harmful. 2 you heard testimony about the meeting in 1953 3 at the plaza hotel where they decided, when they 4 knew that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer, to 5 hire a public relations firm. instead of deciding 6 how can we tell people, how can we get warnings on 7 the packages, how can we let people know, they 8 decided to hire a public relations firm. 9 and then through the next four decades they 10 sold doubt. was not really even important to sell 11 cigarettes anymore. what they sold was doubt to 12 keep people buying cigarettes. and that is their own 13 document. doubt is our product. 14 see, what they are trying to get is, sure the 15 surgeon general is coming out and saying things, and 16 other people are coming out and saying things, but 17 what they want to do is just plant that seed of 18 doubt. plant that little seed of doubt. 19 well, i do not smoke four packs a day. i'm 20 okay. i'm healthy. i exercise. i'm okay. i smoke 21 filters or menthols. i'm okay. 22 that is what they did. they planted that little 23 seed of doubt to keep people smoking, because they 24 knew they were addicted and they wanted that doubt. 25 these were lies that they told. 3539 1 so i said in the beginning of this case that i 2 would tell you a story about greed and fraud and 3 lies, and also a story about addiction. and you 4 heard that story. 5 you heard the story of betty owens in the 6 nursing home in the middle of the night calling her 7 children saying, i need cigarettes, bring them to 8 me. you heard the story about her leaving her 9 daughter's home to go down in the basement. just 10 image the picture. she is down in the basement 11 pulling on a cigarette. 12 you heard a story of addiction, and you also 13 heard testimony about how big a problem addiction is 14 in america and how we are trying just now to figure 15 out ways to treat it. 16 the lies that they told were intentional, they 17 were conscious, and it was a choice they made. and 18 i said it was about greed, because all of them were 19 for one reason. one reason. profit. to continue 20 to make more money, never once caring about the 21 public health of the country they lived in, never 22 once caring about who was getting addicted to their 23 product. 24 when i started this trial i asked you -- i said 25 one thing that concerns me is that we become jaded. 3540 1 we hear a lot of stories about corporate greed or 2 corporations make decisions. so the tendency to 3 kind of let these things wash over, especially in a 4 trial like this where you hear it so much. but i 5 ask you to pay attention to each of those documents 6 and look carefully at what they show, and how they 7 show a real callous indifference to human life for 8 their product. 9 and so today, finally today is the day that you 10 have to decide that that conduct needs to be 11 punished, that that conduct is not victimless, that 12 it caused harm. 13 you see, they want you to believe -- no, they 14 want you to decide that their greed and their fraud 15 and their lies is victimless. they want you to 16 decide that they did not harm anybody. 17 they want to blame -- no, they want you to 18 blame betty owens, not 5 percent, not a portion of 19 it. they want you to blame betty owens one hundred percent. 20 when i was working last night trying to think 21 about what i was going to say to you one word kept 22 coming up, and i thought i needed to talk to you 23 about it. and that word is the truth. that is what 24 we are here about. 25 what is the truth? and i'll assert that r.j. 3541 1 reynolds has had a very loose association with the 2 truth from the beginning. the truth. 3 so i want to talk about some things that 4 happened in this courtroom about the truth. joel 5 dubow. you remember him. he was the guy that wrote 6 this article that the defendants used to try and 7 cross marvin goldberg. you remember dr. goldberg on 8 the stand. and they tried to use this to say, oh, 9 what you say about joe camel's not true. there is no 10 studies that support that joe camel increased the 11 risk of smoking for kids. 12 and they put up this article, and you remember 13 me objecting to the article, and you also remember 14 my team starting to work when that happened. and 15 what we came up with was, well, in fact, joel dubow 16 was on r.j. reynolds' payroll. and you saw that 17 evidence, and we presented it on redirect after we 18 took a break and were able to come up with these 19 documents, these documents that show that he was in 20 communication with r.j. reynolds before he wrote the 21 article, documents that show that r.j. reynolds was 22 funding his research, documents that show that joel 23 dubow was actually looking for a job. 24 what is the truth? the evidence that they put 25 up, the truth? this is a document from 1996 saying 3542 1 we are going to give an all-expense paid trip up to 2 see r.j. reynolds. 3 and that is the document that they tried to 4 cross marvin goldberg with, was a document written 5 by joel dubow, their guy. 6 did they tell you that? did they tell you that 7 was their guy? no. 8 charles golden. you will remember when dr. 9 proctor was on the stand and he talked about that 10 stanley frank had written the true article. y'all 11 will remember that. and that true article, and 12 stanley frank was an employee of hill & knowlton, 13 and he wrote that article that said there was no 14 harm, that smoking did not cause lung cancer, that 15 the link had not been proven yet. and that article 16 was re-put in the national enquirer. and remember 17 dr. proctor talked about that. 18 then they got up and tried to cross examine dr. 19 proctor, and remember they showed him a national 20 enquirer from three years earlier that had the name 21 charles golden attached, and said to dr. proctor, 22 well, you are not right. charles golden is not a 23 made-up name. he was writing articles three years 24 before. 25 so we had to go to work again. and you will 3543 1 remember we came back -- that is the national 2 enquirer article. and you will remember we came back 3 with the ftc report after the ftc had done a study 4 and showed in fact it was stanley frank who had 5 written the national enquirer article, and, in fact, 6 charles golden was the name the national enquirer 7 used. 8 stanley frank, who at this time was an employee 9 of hill & knowlton, was contacted and persuaded to 10 write an article for the enquirer. the use of the 11 name charles golden was the normal house byline used 12 by the enquirer to keep the identity of the author 13 confidential. we told you the truth. and the list 14 goes on and on. 15 you will remember when dr. figlar got on the 16 stand he talked and talked about all the things r.j. 17 reynolds was doing to reduce harm. remember all of 18 that? we are designing our cigarettes differently. 19 we are doing all these different things to reduce 20 harm. 21 and then i got up and cross examined him with 22 the 1994 surgeon general report -- no, the 2010 23 surgeon general's report, which says -- and that is 24 p487, which says: moreover, subsequent research 25 demonstrated that the use of ventilation holes -- 3544 1 that is one of the things he talked to you about as 2 being a way to reduce harm -- the use of ventilation 3 holes produced higher levels of freebase nicotine, 4 which led to a more addictive product, as well as 5 deeper lung inhalation of cooler and less harsh 6 smoke. 7 what is the truth? and the list goes on and on. 8 and i think it is fair for you to ask, can i trust 9 any of the evidence that r.j. reynolds puts up? 10 they formed a united front against the truth in 11 1953, and today they are not giving you the truth. 12 mr. geise: your honor, i object. may we 13 approach? 14 (sidebar conference outside the hearing of the 15 jury.) 16 mr. geise: these are litigation tactics today 17 that have taken place in the past. 18 ms. shamp says question everything, ask if 19 they are telling you the truth, and all that. she 20 said it started in the 1970's. you should ask that 21 today. 22 it is directly a violation of the prior order 23 and it is an implication that something started in 24 the 70's is continuing in this courtroom today, and 25 it is not permitted. it is a violation of the 3545 1 pretrial order. 2 ms. shamp: i'm entitled to comment upon the 3 evidence and the truth upon the evidence. and what 4 i said was -- 5 the court: one at a time. 6 ms. shamp: well, i most certainly am entitled 7 to say if they put up evidence that was subsequently 8 found to be not true i'm mostly entitled to comment 9 on that. that is closing argument. 10 mr. geise: she can comment about all the lies 11 that she is put up during this. but the point of the 12 matter is she cannot say this was 1970 and they are 13 still doing it today. 14 the court: i think you can comment if you 15 believe a piece of evidence is not factual. i do not 16 think you can give the -- i think the way that was 17 stated i would have to agree with mr. geise, the 18 generality of the way it was stated i would have to 19 agree with mr. geise. 20 ms. shamp: i cannot say that -- i said in 1953 21 they formed the united front, and then i said -- i 22 believe i said and today they have put up evidence 23 that is not true. 24 the court: i think you can comment -- 25 ms. shamp: i can say that, today they put up 3546 1 evidence that is not true. 2 the court: i think you can comment on specific 3 evidence. i think under the pretrial order that in 4 general you are not allowed to comment on litigation 5 tactics. i think you can say the evidence presented 6 is not true. 7 ms. shamp: that is what i did. 8 mr. geise: when she linked it to something in 9 the past that is not what she is doing. 10 the court: i think what he is saying is in the 11 totality of it when it is linked today i think it is 12 violating the spirit of the pretrial order. i think 13 that is what he is saying. 14 mr. geise: and i was ready for it, because ms. 15 shamp has done this in the last two trials i've had 16 with her. we have been to sidebar. so i knew it was 17 coming, it was just a matter of when. 18 the court: all right. thank you. 19 (following sidebar.) 20 ms. shamp: is the evidence they put up the 21 truth? 22 now, r.j. reynolds has put up a lot of 23 distraction through this case. distractions like 24 she did not die from lung cancer, they are not our 25 cigarettes that she smoked, she knew it was harmful, 3547 1 ken ellis wrote a letter to his uncle, cancer was not 2 caused by smoking, it was caused by something else, 3 she smoked because she enjoyed it. they put up a 4 lot of distraction evidence. 5 so what i want to do now is i want to talk 6 about what the evidence is, because when you go back 7 in the jury room you are probably thinking you have 8 one job, and that is to deliberate and reach a 9 verdict. but you actually have two jobs back there. 10 the other job is that you have to discuss with your 11 fellow jurors why you hold the positions you do, 12 what the evidence is to support the positions that 13 you are going to take. 14 and so i want to talk about what the evidence 15 is and how it proves the things that we are supposed 16 to prove. 17 so before i do that i want to talk about the 18 burden of proof. and the court just instructed you 19 on the burden of proof, and the court told you that 20 the plaintiff has the burden of proof to prove his 21 claims by the greater weight of the evidence. 22 and since we are in a courtroom i like to think 23 of it like the scales of justice. we have to put 24 our evidence that tilts the scale. when you put -- 25 mr. geise: your honor, it is contrary to your 3548 1 order and the instruction you gave. 2 the court: why do not you all approach sidebar. 3 (sidebar conference outside the hearing of the 4 jury.) 5 the court: i believe that during jury 6 selection i sustained the defense's objection about 7 the issue of the scales of justice, that being not 8 an instruction on the law that is appropriate. 9 ms. shamp: well, i think it -- it was not 10 appropriate to talk about what our burden of proof 11 is when we are in -- before the court had instructed 12 them and we were in voir dire. 13 i'm certainly entitled to talk about what the 14 burden of proof is, what it means, what greater 15 weight of the evidence means. is not that what every 16 lawyer does in closing argument? 17 mr. geise: greater weight of the evidence 18 does not mean tipping the scales just a little bit. 19 that is misleading. that is the reason it was 20 sustained in voir dire and it should be sustained 21 again. 22 the court: since it is closing argument and i 23 do not think you are going to focus on the scales i 24 will allow you to continue. 25 (following sidebar.) 3549 1 ms. shamp: plaintiff has to prove his case by 2 a greater weight of the evidence. so what i'm going 3 to do throughout my closing argument is to talk 4 about what the evidence is on either side of the 5 issues that you are going to be called upon to 6 decide. line them up. what is the evidence over 7 here? what is the evidence over here? and where is 8 the greater weight. 9 all right. now, the judge just instructed you 10 about what the evidence is. okay. and in this case 11 you have got four categories of documents that are the 12 evidence presented. you have got internal documents 13 from r.j. reynolds. a lot of them. we will talk 14 about some of them today, but there is a lot more in 15 the binders that will go back with you. and all of 16 those documents are evidence, and that means you can 17 look at all of them, all of them in deciding the 18 various issues you are going to be called upon to 19 decide. 20 the second category is government documents and 21 other documents. and you have heard a lot about the 22 surgeon general's reports. all of those are 23 evidence. you can rely upon those reports in 24 deciding the issues you have to decide. 25 you have got ftc reports back there. look at 3550 1 them. those will contain evidence that will help 2 you in deciding the issues you are going to be called 3 upon to decide. 4 and all of that, not just the testimony from 5 the stand, but all of these things are evidence that 6 you can utilize in order to reach your decisions. 7 of course the testimony of the witnesses that 8 you have heard, and there is also medical records from 9 betty owens, including her death certificate. 10 so all of these things together are the 11 evidence that you have with you in order to consider 12 the issues that you are going to have to decide. 13 so the first issue that you have to decide is 14 class membership. and the judge talked to you about 15 that. so i want to talk to you about it just a 16 little bit again. the engle class action. 17 and you will recall we said in opening statement 18 that the engle class action began in 1994. okay. 19 again, just a year after her death this class 20 started. and the engle class action was tried to a 21 jury for over a year in 1999, and they heard all 22 kinds of evidence, some of the same evidence you 23 heard in this two and-a-half weeks, but a lot of 24 evidence. 25 and that jury made certain findings. and after 3551 1 the jury made findings those went up to the florida 2 supreme court, and the florida supreme court 3 affirmed the engle verdict, and then we brought this 4 case. 5 and what you have to decide is whether betty 6 owens is one of the people who fits within the class 7 membership definition so that she is part of -- i 8 put her picture there -- so she is part of the class 9 action. 10 that is the first issue you are called upon to 11 decide. and if you do then you get the benefit of 12 the engle findings. i'm not going to go through 13 each one of these now. you are going to have them in 14 your jury instructions. 15 so what is the definition of class membership? 16 the judge just instructed you. to prove that betty 17 owens was a member of the engle class, plaintiff 18 must prove by a greater weight of the evidence that 19 betty owens was addicted to cigarettes containing 20 nicotine, and if so, was such addiction a legal 21 cause of her lung cancer and death. pretty simple. 22 and that is question one on the verdict form. 23 when i was trying to figure out how i would 24 organize my comments to you today i decided that the 25 most effective way to talk to you about the issues 3552 1 that you were going to decide is to actually go 2 through the verdict form one at a time, and what 3 those questions are, and what the evidence is with 4 respect to each of those questions so that we can 5 talk about where the greater weight is, and what 6 evidence was presented on these issues. 7 so question one basically has three parts. the 8 first part is addiction. was betty owens addicted? 9 and you heard a lot of evidence about that. 10 but it is very important that you understand 11 what the question is not. the question is not 12 whether she could quit. 13 now, when you get to the part of the jury(sic) 14 form about comparative fault, those are some things 15 you might talk about, figure out, whether she could 16 quit. but it is not -- and nobody said that whether 17 or not she could quit determined whether she was 18 addicted. even dr. hayes said that addicted smokers 19 quit. addicted people who use heroin quit. 20 so the question is not on addiction whether or 21 not she could quit. the question is not whether she 22 tried hard enough to quit. it is not whether she was 23 motivated to quit. none of those things come into 24 play on question one. whether she knew smoking was 25 harmful, whether she chose to smoke. the question 3553 1 is was she addicted. it is quite simple. 2 so what is the evidence about addiction? one, 3 the evidence is that nicotine is an addictive drug 4 that changes the brain. it actually causes physical 5 changes that are measurable. we can look at them in 6 the brain. 7 we know that nicotine is a drug. everybody 8 agrees to that. we know nicotine is addictive. 9 everybody agrees to that. and we know it changes 10 the brain. all of the evidence on those things is 11 undisputed. you actually had pictures of pet scans 12 of the brain showing how the brain in an addicted 13 smoker is changed by the nicotinic receptors in 14 there. 15 you have evidence that eighty percent -- eighty percent 16 of smokers try and quit every year. it is sort of an 17 amazing statistic. and less than 5 percent are 18 successful. 19 you heard evidence that the longer you smoke, 20 the more you smoke, the greater the likelihood is 21 that you are addicted. 22 okay. so this is what we learned about 23 nicotine and addiction. we learned these things, 24 this evidence. we also learned that beginning 25 smoking in the early teens increases the likelihood 3554 1 of addiction. and you will remember the slide that 2 dr. werner showed you and talked about how the brain 3 is not fully developed, and because it is not fully 4 developed, if you introduce a substance into the 5 brain, not just nicotine, but any substance, 6 alcohol, that teens who start utilizing a substance 7 have a much higher risk of becoming addicted to 8 those substances. that is why it is so critically 9 important to keep drugs out of our children's lives. 10 and this is a picture that has the frontal 11 cortex of the brain, how it is not developed yet. 12 all right. so what is the evidence that she 13 was addicted? one, we have got nicotine is an 14 addictive drug that changes the brain. cigarettes 15 have nicotine in them. that is what she was exposed 16 to. we know those things. we know her brain was 17 changed by it. 18 we have evidence of betty owens smoking. now, 19 we know that from the witnesses who testified. so 20 we have evidence from martha schofield, her 21 daughter, from ken ellis, her son, and from bernice 22 birdwell, her brother. and they talked about her 23 smoking. we learned that she smoked between a pack 24 and a pack and-a-half a day. 25 all right. now, it is interesting to think 3555 1 about. if somebody enjoyed smoking, if they smoked 2 because they liked it, would they consistently smoke 3 a pack a day every day? no. and the defendants 4 know that. we know that from their documents. 5 we know she smoked for 44 years; that she was 6 ingesting that brain-changing drug for 44 years at a 7 pack and-a-half a day -- pack to a pack and-a-half a 8 day. 9 she began smoking when she was 13 years old. 10 undisputed. and we know she smoked first thing in 11 the morning, all during the day, smoked in the 12 evening, smoked in bed at night. so we know a lot 13 about her smoking behavior, the way she smoked. 14 we also know that she had withdrawal symptoms 15 and cravings. that is undisputed. undisputed that 16 she was fidgety, anxious, from the people who 17 observed her when she was not able to smoke. she got 18 fidgety, restless, anxious, irritable. and you 19 heard that from her daughter and from her son. and 20 that she had cravings. that is undisputed. in the 21 middle of the night calling and asking her son. 22 going downstairs in the basement at her daughter's 23 house. going in and out of her son's house when she 24 was there. she had cravings for nicotine. 25 undisputed. 3556 1 and she meets the dsm-5 criteria for nicotine 2 addiction. you will recall dr. werner actually took 3 the book and went through the criterion. and these 4 are the 11 criteria in the book. 5 it is the same book that dr. hayes said is the 6 book, and dr. werner said is the book. 7 dr. werner went through every category. did not 8 give her all the categories. gave her 8 of the 11. 9 and she talked about each one of those categories, 10 so that she met the dsm-5 definition for addiction 11 in the category severe. 12 and then of course you had dr. werner's opinion 13 that she was addicted. dr. werner testified to 14 that. 15 i'm listing what all the evidence is that she 16 was addicted on one side. 17 dr. werner, as you will remember, is a medical 18 doctor. she is board certified in two specialties, 19 she is double-board certified. she is the 20 vice-chairman of the department of psychiatry at the 21 university of florida. she is also an assistant 22 professor and director at the forensic psychiatric 23 division. she is the director there at the 24 university of florida. she teaches medical students 25 about addiction and about the dsm. she is the 3557 1 director of all inpatient psychiatric care at the 2 university of florida. 3 now, we kind of split up her testimony. she 4 did her qualifications one day and her testimony the 5 next day, but you will recall she said she is in charge 6 of all inpatient psychiatric care at the university 7 of florida, and that she currently sees, treats, and 8 prescribes for patients with addiction. sees, 9 treats, and prescribes for patients with addiction, 10 including nicotine addiction. she is published 11 journal articles on addiction, and she is been 12 appointed by the governor to review cases and 13 testify in court. she is a highly-respected expert 14 in the state of florida, and her testimony was that 15 betty owens was addicted, based upon the dsm-5 and 16 her clinical judgment. 17 but you do not only have that. you also have 18 r.j. reynolds' internal documents, which you can 19 consider when looking at the issue of addiction. 20 r.j. reynolds' own documents, p302, say that they 21 know nicotine is a potent drug. it is a potent drug 22 with pharmacological effects. 23 this is document p302: the tobacco industry 24 may be thought of as being specialized, highly 25 ritualized, and a stylized segment of the 3558 1 pharmaceutical industry. tobacco products uniquely 2 contain and deliver nicotine, a potent drug. 3 and you will see throughout their documents that 4 they describe their product as a nicotine delivery 5 device. it is a nicotine delivery device. 6 their document, p285, describes it as the sine 7 qua non. that means without which -- sine, without. 8 without which nothing. they describe a cigarette 9 without nicotine as without which there is nothing. 10 it is the reason that people smoke cigarettes, is to 11 get the nicotine. it is the sine qua non, nicotine, 12 of smoking. 13 and then they talk about in their own documents 14 how they have to put enough nicotine in the smoke of 15 their products sufficient to supply the necessary 16 requirements of the smoker. the requirements of the 17 smoker. it is their dose. their addiction and their 18 dose. 19 they know it is an addiction. fortunately for 20 us it is a habit they cannot break. they know that 21 their product is deeply addictive. not only know 22 it, they count on it. they design their products to 23 do that. and yet they come in today and say she is 24 not addicted. she smoked because she enjoyed it. 25 the evidence that we have put on that betty 3559 1 owens was addicted -- i said we should put them on 2 two sides of the scale. what is the evidence that 3 she was addicted? and we put -- we spent a lot of 4 time doing it, putting on evidence about addiction. 5 we put on a lot of evidence about addiction. 6 and what evidence is there that she was not 7 addicted? that is it. dr. jill hayes. 8 now, i say doctor because she is a psychologist. 9 she is not a medical doctor. remember that 10 testimony. she is not board certified in anything. 11 there are board certifications in psychology. she 12 has no board certifications. she is never written or 13 published about addiction. she is not listed as an 14 expert on addiction anywhere. remember when ms. 15 bryan pulled up the website? does not list 16 addiction. she does not treat patients with 17 nicotine addiction. i was surprised when she said 18 that from the stand. she does not even treat 19 patients who have nicotine addiction. she does not 20 currently teach. she cannot even prescribe 21 medications. she cannot prescribe medications to 22 treat nicotine addiction. 23 but what did she even say? she stood in front 24 of you -- sat in front of you and listed her five 25 factors. you remember. these are my five factors 3560 1 for why i say she is not addicted. 2 here are her five factors: cognitive capacity, 3 awareness, personality, smoking, and quitting. 4 where did she get these five factors? she 5 testified that it is the dsm-5. remember? she said, 6 i used the dsm-5. these are not in the dsm-5. her 7 five factors are not in any publication. her five 8 factors that she used she had no support for. she 9 did not even go through the dsm criteria. 10 i thought it was an extraordinarily telling 11 question from the jury, why did you decide she was 12 not addicted? because she did not even tell us. she 13 did not go through the dsm-5 criteria. she said she 14 thought she could quit. that was one of the reasons 15 she told you that she thought she was addicted, 16 because she thought she could quit. 17 if that is the standard, she could quit, no one 18 is addicted. nobody. everybody who testified said 19 that addicted people can quit. it is not the 20 question you have to decide. 21 so where is the greater weight of the evidence? 22 we suggest that the far greater weight of the 23 evidence is that betty owens was addicted. 24 okay. the second thing you have to decide is 25 whether addiction caused her smoking. the surgeon 3561 1 general's report you will have says that nicotine 2 addiction is the fundamental reason that people 3 persist in using tobacco products. for the typical 4 smoker, nicotine satisfaction is the dominant 5 desire. the dominant desire as opposed to flavor or 6 other satisfactions. 7 their own document says: we cannot defend 8 continued smoking as free choice if the person was 9 addicted. that is p363. 10 r.j. reynolds' own documents prove that the 11 addiction caused her to smoke, that that is why she 12 smoked. all the evidence regarding her smoking 13 behavior and dr. werner's testimony. 14 what was the evidence that she smoked for a 15 reasons other than addiction? dr. hayes. remember 16 what dr. hayes said. we asked her: dr. hayes, you 17 cannot rule out nicotine as a reason that betty 18 owens smoked; is that correct. no. no, it is not 19 correct, or, no, it is correct? no, i cannot rule out 20 that nicotine was potentially a reason that she 21 smoked. so even dr. hayes admits that she smoked -- 22 or that she cannot rule out that she smoked because 23 of nicotine. so all of the evidence is that she 24 smoked because of her nicotine addiction. 25 and finally the last question is that her 3562 1 smoking caused lung cancer and death. and of course 2 you remember a long time ago, several -- i guess the 3 first week, we put up -- the second week we put up 4 dr. wright. and you will remember dr. wright, he is a 5 pathologist and he was the chief medical examiner in 6 dade county for a long time. and dr. wright 7 testified that smoking was what caused her lung 8 cancer what caused her death. we of course put up 9 her death certificate that she died from lung cancer 10 that had metastasized to her brain. we also put up 11 medical records, and the medical records are in 12 evidence, that she died as a result of smoking and 13 lung cancer. 14 what is the evidence that something other than 15 smoking caused her lung cancer? none. nothing. 16 now, this is one of the things that the 17 defendants spent a enormous amount of time on. and 18 let me say this, this is a very simple question, and 19 that is, r.j. reynolds' brands are clearly one of 20 the causes of her smoking. 21 and i want to talk for just a minute about 22 this, because it is a point i think i need to clarify 23 that is not an issue that you have to worry about. 24 all right. the testimony is that betty owens 25 smoked this list of brands: belair, camel, salem, 3563 1 kool, lucky strike, winston, pall mall, benson & 2 hedges, raleigh, marlboro, and kent. okay? 3 mr. geise: your honor, i object. may we 4 approach? 5 (sidebar conference outside the hearing of the 6 jury.) 7 mr. geise: for the vast majority of the time 8 that mrs. owens was alive benson & hedges was a 9 liggett brand cigarette, not philip morris. 10 ms. shamp: my research shows that benson & 11 hedges was a philip morris product. now maybe 12 the -- 13 mr. geise: late in life they bought it. 14 ms. shamp: they bought it. 15 mr. geise: the brand, not liggett. 16 ms. shamp: well, if they bought the brand -- 17 mr. geise: they did not buy the liability, they 18 bought the brand. 19 the court: okay. this is outside of my scope 20 of knowledge. 21 mr. geise: i mean, it is just a -- again it is 22 just testimony that never came in the case about the 23 manufacturer of benson & hedges. ms. shamp just put 24 up a slide in front of the jury that said it is 25 philip morris. they have the stipulation on philip 3564 1 morris. i'm sure that is what she is going to go to 2 next. so it is misleading to put up a brand and 3 indicate it is manufactured by somebody else when 4 there is no evidence of that, there is no stipulation, 5 and then make whatever argument she is going to make. 6 the court: well, i mean, if that is accurate 7 then i do not believe you can show that, if what he is 8 saying is true. i do not have the knowledge of the 9 corporate structure of all of these cigarette brands 10 as you do, but if that is accurate, that would be -- 11 i have no reason to question that that is not right. 12 ms. shamp: what i know is that it is a philip 13 morris brand now. 14 mr. geise: now. 15 ms. shamp: it is a philip morris brand now. 16 and so you know -- 17 mr. geise: and there was no evidence about 18 that whatsoever in the trial. 19 the court: you are right. 20 mr. geise: so she is arguing evidence that is 21 not in this case. 22 ms. shamp: all right. i'll move on. 23 the court: all right. thank you. 24 (following sidebar.) 25 ms. shamp: so you heard a lot of evidence 3565 1 about these brands. all right. now, it is important 2 to know the vast majority of winston, salem, kool, 3 belair, those are all made either by r.j. reynolds 4 or by one of its predecessors, brown & williamson or 5 american tobacco. 6 all right. now, the court also read you a 7 stipulation, and what the stipulation says is that 8 belair, camel, kook, lucky strike, pall mall, salem, 9 and winston cigarettes were manufactured in the 10 united states by reynolds or its predecessor in 11 interest. that is not an issue. all those brands 12 are r.j. reynolds. they are responsible for all of 13 them. 14 now, the other brands that were discussed that 15 are philip morris brands, they have stipulated. 16 this is an agreement. and you remember the court 17 instructed you that you can consider all of the 18 evidence as well of the all the facts that parties 19 have agreed to. and you will have this in your jury 20 instructions. this is actually one of the jury 21 instructions. it says that any smoking by decedent 22 betty owens of any cigarette manufactured by 23 lorillard or by philip morris was minimal and did 24 not directly and in natural and continuing sequence 25 produce or contribute substantially to producing any 3566 1 injury sustained by betty owens, if any, that was 2 caused by smoking cigarettes. 3 all right. if there was use by philip morris 4 or lorillard, those two manufacturers, of those 5 brands of cigarettes, the defendant has stipulated 6 that it was minimal and did not contribute. 7 okay. now, i suspect that they might say 8 something about the off brands that she smoked, and 9 there was some testimony that very occasionally that 10 there would be smoking by an off brand. 11 all right. but what you have to understand is 12 read what the jury instructions say. okay. in 13 order to be regarded as a legal cause of death an 14 addiction to cigarettes need not be the only cause. 15 addiction to r.j. reynolds' cigarettes may be a 16 legal cause of injury and death even though it 17 operates in combination with the act of another, or 18 some other cause, if some other cause occurs at the 19 same time as the addiction and the addiction 20 contributes substantially to producing such injury 21 and death. 22 all right. even if there is some minor use by 23 somebody else, minor use of generic brands or off 24 brands. and the only testimony is that was very 25 occasional. the vast majority was rjr. that is what 3567 1 the evidence is. it was rjr brands. and you heard 2 that from martha schofield, and you heard that from 3 ken ellis, and heard that from bernice birdwell, 4 that she smoked lucky strikes when she started. 5 this is a nonissue that the defendants are trying to 6 make an issue of. their own stipulation -- their 7 own stipulation said that philip morris or lorillard 8 smoking was minimal. 9 all right. but even if there was some other 10 cause, the question you have to decide is was the 11 smoking of r.j. reynolds one of the causes. that is 12 all you have to decide. it is a red herring to your 13 deliberations. 14 in order to be regarded as a legal cause of 15 death addiction to cigarettes need not be the only 16 cause. 17 you know, i comment for a minute about how 18 versatile r.j. reynolds is. very versatile. so 19 1999 in the engle trial they argued that nicotine is 20 not addictive, and then once there was a finding, 21 that jury had to listen to testimony for a year and 22 had a finding. they came back and said nicotine is 23 addictive. r.j. reynolds said, okay, nicotine is 24 addictive, but this person is not addicted. okay. 25 all right. maybe if betty owens is addicted -- 3568 1 well, if she is addicted, she did not smoke because 2 of such addiction. they are versatile. they keep 3 moving it around, and we have to block them at every 4 turn. 5 the truth, ladies and gentlemen, is that betty 6 owens is a member of the class. that is the truth. 7 she was addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine. 8 she was part of the engle class. she is the reason 9 the engle class was brought on behalf of this group 10 of people. she is one of them. 11 that is what the evidence shows. that is the 12 question you have on question 1 of the verdict form. 13 was betty owens addicted to cigarettes containing 14 nicotine, and if so, was such addiction a legal 15 cause of her death? 16 the evidence is overwhelming she is a member of 17 this class. so if she is a member of the class then 18 the plaintiff is entitled to the benefit of the 19 engle findings. and what the court has instructed 20 you on is they cannot deny them, they cannot question 21 them, and the weight you give them is as if you had 22 decided them yourself. 23 and they are: that cigarettes cause lung 24 cancer, that nicotine in cigarettes is addictive. 25 these -- again, these are all in your jury 3569 1 instructions that you will have back with you. that 2 r.j. reynolds placed cigarettes on the market that 3 were defective and unreasonably dangerous. the 4 product itself. that r.j. reynolds concealed or 5 omitted material information not otherwise known or 6 available. 7 and that is important. that piece right there, 8 because the defendants are going to argue that betty 9 owens knew, she knew. but the finding that you are 10 bound by says they concealed information that was 11 not otherwise known. they hid things that people 12 did not know, knowing that the material was false or 13 misleading, or failed to disclose a material fact 14 concerning the health effects or addictive nature of 15 smoking cigarettes, or both. 16 five -- and this is the conspiracy where they 17 linked arms -- r.j. reynolds agreed with other 18 tobacco companies to conceal or omit information 19 regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their 20 addictive nature with the intention -- 21 intentionally, we talked about that -- intention 22 that smokers and the public would rely upon that 23 information to their detriment. 24 rely. remember i put up -- dr. figlar said we 25 expect people to rely, and they should be able to 3570 1 rely. it is our obligation. 2 they put out false information with the 3 intention that smokers and the public would rely to 4 their detriment. and that r.j. reynolds was 5 negligent. 6 these findings may not be denied or questioned. 7 they must carry the same weight they would have if 8 you had determined them yourselves. 9 all right. so what is the second question that 10 you are going to be asked? second question on the 11 verdict form is the fraud question. this is where 12 we start talking about their fraud. this is it 13 right here. 14 state whether r.j. reynolds' concealment or 15 omission of a material fact -- whether their 16 fraud -- about the health effects or addictive 17 nature of smoking cigarettes, or both, were a legal 18 cause of betty owens' death. this is where we get 19 to the important stuff. whether their conspiracy, 20 the agreement to conceal or omit a material fact 21 regarding the health effects of cigarette smoking or 22 the addictive nature of smoking cigarettes was a 23 legal cause of betty owens' death. 24 the judge read to you what does that mean, that 25 their conspiracy, and their fraud was a legal cause. 3571 1 well, it means reliance. it is that word we have 2 been talking about. this is from your jury 3 instructions. 4 the next issue for you to determine is whether 5 concealment or omission of material information 6 concerning the health effects or addictive nature of 7 cigarette smoking by r.j. reynolds was a legal cause 8 of the death of betty owens. 9 betty owens' reliance on such statements to her 10 detriment is a legal cause of the loss, injury, or 11 damage if it directly and in continuous sequence 12 produces or contributes substantially to producing 13 her loss, injury, or damages, so that it can be 14 reasonably said that but for betty owens' reliance 15 on her loss, injury -- her loss, injury, or damage 16 would not have occurred. all right. reliance. 17 and what the judge will instruct -- the judge 18 did instruct you is that when you are deciding that 19 issue you can consider all of the facts. 20 as to each of plaintiff's claims of concealment 21 and conspiracy to conceal i hereby instruct you that 22 you may consider all of the evidence in the case in 23 determining whether or not plaintiff has satisfied 24 the reliance question. 25 all right. so this is a very simple concept. 3572 1 okay. did their fraudulent conduct cause smoking? 2 did all the stuff they do cause people to keep 3 smoking? and did it cause betty owens to keep 4 smoking? 5 remember how i said they want to believe that 6 it was victimless? this is where you say no. your 7 fraud has victims, including betty owens. 8 what were the fraud messages that were put out? 9 we talked a lot about that. the evidence that we 10 put up that defendant's fraud was a cause of betty 11 owens -- now, again it does not have to be the only 12 cause, but whether their fraud was a cause of betty 13 owens' death. you have the engle finding that says 14 that they concealed or omitted information that was 15 not otherwise known. you have all of the statements 16 that they put out, and you will have all these 17 documents back there, and you will remember this whole 18 campaign, the frank statement, we believe the 19 products we make are not injurious to your health, 20 the campaign of doubt and denial. you actually had 21 videotape that will go back with you that we played 22 in court from howard cullman, you will remember, bill 23 dwyer, e. horrigan from rjr, ann browder. you 24 remember ann browder. the testimony in front of 25 congress. all that are the messages that they were 3573 1 putting out. a campaign of doubt and denial. the 2 press releases. the entire hill & knowlton 3 campaign. the white papers. you remember the 4 distribution of the white papers, how many people it 5 was sent to. smoking and health, the continuing 6 controversy. how it was sent to all the doctors. 7 but in addition to all of this information 8 about this campaign of doubt and denial that was put 9 out -- that is the circulation of how many doctors 10 it was sent to. 205,000 copies of the white paper 11 was sent to doctors. 178,000 doctors. 12 they knew that they had to try and create 13 confidence and public assurance. that was a hill & 14 knowlton document about how they were trying. but 15 not just those messages. the ti document, the tirc 16 documents, which you also have, is their massive 17 advertising campaigns. 18 you will recall dr. goldberg was on the stand for 19 two full days, and we talked about those messages 20 that the tobacco company was putting out, messages 21 that were determined to be false and misleading. 22 cigarettes are one of the most heavily marketed 23 products in the united states. between 1940 and 24 2005 u.s. cigarette manufacturers spent about 250 25 billion dollars on cigarette advertising and 3574 1 promotions. 2 cigarette advertising reaches virtually all 3 americans who can either read or understand the 4 spoken word. the amount of cigarette advertising in 5 the united states is the most heavily advertised 6 product in america. it has been estimated that the 7 six major cigarette companies spent more than one 8 billion dollars in 1980 to sell their product. the 9 commission believes the warning label on the 10 cigarette package has not succeeded in overcoming 11 the prevalent attitude toward cigarette smoking 12 created and maintain by the cigarette companies 13 through their advertisements, particularly the 14 barrage of commercials on television which portray 15 smoking as a harmless and enjoyable social activity 16 that is not habit forming and involves no hazards to 17 health. 18 these false messages were being sent out to the 19 american public. 20 can we play one of the ads now? play 121b-008. 21 (the video clip was played as follows.) 22 there is a wonderful world of softness, a 23 wonderful world of freshness. it is the wonderful, 24 wonderful, wonderful, wonderful salem cigarette. 25 salem softness freshens your taste. salem softness 3575 1 freshens your taste. smoke salem cigarettes. salem 2 gives you a modern filter plus rich tobacco taste, 3 smooth with menthol, softened with fresh air, for 4 salem's special paper breathes in fresh air with 5 every puff to bring you salems air-softened taste. 6 there is a wonderful world of softness, a wonderful 7 world of freshness. it is the wonderful, wonderful, 8 wonderful world of salem cigarettes. salem softness 9 freshens your taste. 10 (video clip concluded.) 11 ms. shamp: this is just one. you will have 12 plenty of those messages that we will send back that 13 this is a harmless activity, that the filter filters 14 out the bad stuff. 15 and i use that particular ad because how it 16 shows fresh air, you are smoking fresh air with the 17 salem cigarette. these were false, misleading 18 advertisements. 19 and we know that betty owens watched 20 television. we know she saw the commercials. we 21 know that she bought and collected belair coupons, 22 which were advertised. we know, and the evidence 23 shows, that this massive advertising campaign 24 created more smoking. 25 what is the evidence of that? the evidence 3576 1 that it created more smoking. we put up the 2 evidence from dr. proctor who said that their 3 advertising campaign and the messages of doubt and 4 denial kept people smoking. that is the evidence 5 that you have. dr. goldberg said that the massive 6 advertising campaign created more smoking. 7 we also have surgeon general reports, which we 8 read to you, which said that the advertising and the 9 messages of doubt and denial kept people smoking. 10 you will also have the ftc reports which 11 showed -- and i showed some of them earlier -- that 12 people continued to smoke even after the surgeon 13 general's report. 14 we also have rjr's internal documents. 15 mike, bring up p976 at page 58. 16 the reason i'm putting these things up, they 17 put this message out, not into the ether, they 18 were not putting this message out just for the heck 19 of spending billions of dollars. they did it to 20 keep people smoking. that is the causation. they 21 did it to keep people smoking. 22 bring up the top paragraph on that page. 23 the cigarette industry dramatically 24 demonstrates the force of advertising in the united 25 states today. we have millions of individual 3577 1 purchases every day of the year, and every consumer 2 is pre-sold specifying his brand by name. the rise 3 and fall of every brand of consequence has been 4 traced in detail, and their year-to-year success or 5 failure has shown to be the direct result of 6 consumer advertising. people smoke because of the 7 advertising. 8 if you will turn to page 60, please, michael. 9 bring up conclusion 3. 10 the basic human motivation, the strongest of 11 which is the desire for security. hence the 12 compelling success of campaigns such as no throat 13 irritation, camels never get on your nerves, et 14 cetera. contrary to popular belief, advertisers do 15 not instill fear into consumers to make them buy, 16 they simply recognize its existence and do their 17 best to profit by it. 18 their advertising of filters. people's fear. 19 and they profited by it. 20 look at the final paragraph on that page, 21 michael, please. 22 in every instance of vigorous aggressive 23 campaign presented with imagination and showmanship 24 has met with success regardless of copy theme media 25 or comparative size of appropriation. 3578 1 they are advertising what? it created more 2 smoking. 3 now, we also had in this case -- what is the 4 evidence that they presented that their fraud did not 5 cause people to keep smoking? [#deleted objection dialogue#] [#deleted recess#] 15 ms. shamp: thank you. 16 i think when we took our break we were 17 discussing questions 2 and 3 on the verdict form, 18 that is the fraud and the conspiracy questions. and 19 where i was talking about was what is the proof that 20 their fraud and conspiracy was a cause of betty 21 owens' death. 22 and again, we are going through the process of 23 weighing the evidence for each of the questions on 24 the verdict form. each of the questions on the 25 verdict form, what is the evidence that it was the 3587 1 cause of betty owens' death and what is the evidence 2 on the other side. 3 we went through a lot of trouble and put up a 4 lot of testimony and evidence about this. we 5 brought in dr. proctor from stanford university. 6 you will remember dr. proctor. he was, i think, our 7 first witness that we put up. dr. proctor from 8 stanford talked about the history of the tobacco 9 industry and put up a lot of the industry's internal 10 documents. 11 we also put up dr. goldberg, and dr. goldberg 12 talked about the mass marketing campaigns. 13 we also put up the surgeon general's reports, 14 various ftc reports, rjr's own internal documents. 15 we put up all of this evidence that their fraud was 16 a cause of betty owens' continued smoking and death. 17 i want to talk about one particular piece 18 because it relates specifically to betty owens. the 19 judge will instruct you that you may use reason and 20 common sense to reach your conclusions. and you can 21 draw reasonable inferences from the evidence. 22 common sense and you can draw reasonable inferences. 23 okay. we put up evidence that showed that 24 smokers are more likely to have incorrect beliefs 25 about the relationship between smoking and lung 3588 1 cancer than are nonsmokers. 2 we believe the inference is that the 3 defendant's conduct, the advertising, the message 4 they put out of doubt worked, that smokers are more 5 likely to have incorrect beliefs about the 6 relationship between smoking and lung cancer than 7 nonsmokers. 8 we also gave you the national enquirer. all 9 right. and it is very important that we put this in 10 context, all right? and the context we gave you was 11 the testimony of dr. werner yesterday. and you will 12 remember what dr. werner said about denial and 13 addiction, all right. 14 i think if you asked any person on the street 15 who is a more reliable sort of information, the 16 national enquirer or the surgeon general. i mean, 17 people on the street are going to say the surgeon 18 general. and what dr. werner talked about is how 19 denial factors into disease and the disease of 20 addiction. 21 and this was not news to r. j. reynolds. they 22 put this in the national enquirer on purpose and in 23 true magazine. 24 now, just enough -- and i asked dr. werner the 25 question, what -- how does this create an obstacle 3589 1 or barrier for somebody to quit? and it is like a 2 crutch they hold. r. j. reynolds gave people the 3 crutch. why? to keep selling cigarettes. it is a 4 little crutch. sure, people are quitting. we will 5 talk a minute in about youth marketing. and they are 6 trying to get new smokers for the ones that quit, 7 just give some of them a crutch. that is why they 8 did this. 9 and the national enquirer in particular, you 10 have evidence that she read the national enquirer. 11 read it. you have evidence of that, that during 12 this time, this is 1968, that she read the national 13 enquirer. 14 all right. and that in conjunction with 15 dr. werner's testimony that information like this 16 was a barrier to people quitting. that is evidence 17 of reliance that caused her disease. 18 but it is very personal, they will have a very 19 different argument. at first, before the engle 20 trial, they argued that there was no fraud, no fraud 21 at all. now that they have the engle findings, they 22 cannot argue that. now they argue, well, our fraud 23 did not cause betty owens to smoke. right? it 24 did not make any difference. all of that fraud 25 did not cause her to keep smoking. 3590 1 ask yourself, what is the evidence of reliance? 2 we put up dr. proctor, dr. goldberg, surgeon 3 general's reports, the ftc reports that their fraud 4 was a cause of betty owens' death and dr. werner. 5 what evidence did they put up that it was not? 6 we put up proof, you would expect them to 7 counter it. the greater weight of the evidence, 8 ladies and gentlemen, we put up proof they did not 9 counter. 10 now, the second question on the verdict form: 11 state whether r. j. reynolds' concealment or 12 omission of a material fact about the health effects 13 or addictive nature of smoking cigarettes or both 14 were a legal cause of betty owens' death. 15 the greater weight of the evidence shows it 16 was. that their fraud -- the conspiracy count goes 17 hand in hand with the fraud count, all right? the 18 first one is whether -- 19 the third question on the verdict form: 20 state whether r. j. reynolds' agreement to 21 conceal, that is, the conspiracy, the agreement to 22 conceal or omit a material fact regarding health 23 effects of cigarette smoke or the addictive nature 24 of smoking cigarettes was a legal cause of betty 25 owens' death. the greater weight of the evidence 3591 1 says it was. 2 now we move to question 4 on the verdict form. 3 and that is comparative fault question. and this is 4 the one where we start talking about whether betty 5 owens did not try hard enough to quit, what were her 6 efforts to quit, should she have tried harder, 7 should she have tried sooner. and you have to 8 decide how much responsibility to put on r. j. 9 reynolds and how much on betty owens. 10 so let us look at what the evidence is with 11 respect to these two parties' conduct because we 12 have to compare, right? let us compare. 13 r. j. reynolds lied, we know that, with the 14 intent that smokers would rely, with the intent, 15 that is the finding, with the intent that smokers 16 would rely to their detriment. 17 and dr. figlar said it. we expect people to 18 rely on us when we put out statements. they said, 19 fortunately for us it is a habit they cannot break. 20 i'll go through all of the evidence of the conduct 21 of r. j. reynolds on this side, think about their 22 conduct and compare it to betty owens. 23 she started smoking when she was 13 years old. 24 and now mr. geise will say that she was making adult 25 decisions because she got married at 13. i guess 3592 1 just because you make a decision does not necessarily 2 mean it is a good decision that you make. 13 years 3 old she started smoking. that -- that choice she 4 made at 13. 5 patches, medications, they were not available. 6 there was an early cessation clinic, that is what the 7 testimony was. there were very few things to help 8 somebody like betty owens to stop smoking. 9 so let us compare what they did, to what she 10 did. she did not try harder. compare that to their 11 intentional lies and deceit. compare what she did 12 when she was addicted buying their product, buying 13 their product, every day to what they did. 14 she was addicted. that has to factor into your 15 consideration of choice. what are the two choices 16 here that we are looking at? the choice of a 17 13-year-old who then became addicted to their 18 product, not to try harder to quit when she became 19 an adult, but when you talk about choice, you cannot 20 talk about choice without talking about informed 21 choice. 22 sure, she made a choice, but did she know -- 23 did they inform her about what was in their product? 24 was it an informed choice that she made to continue 25 smoking, or because of their deceit, because of 3593 1 their lies did she continue to smoke, making that 2 choice. 3 now, the defendants are very versatile, very 4 versatile. so now they want to argue that it 5 does not matter about all these things, this was her 6 choice, she should be one hundred percent at fault, 7 responsible, one hundred percent at fault. 8 so, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, i'm not 9 going to tell you what i think the numbers should be 10 for the percentage of fault. you are going to 11 assign some fault to betty owens. that is okay. but 12 we think the vast majority of fault has to go on 13 r. j. reynolds, that when you compare the conduct of 14 r. j. reynolds to that of our client's, the vast 15 majority has to be laid at their door given that the 16 evidence was that you heard about her smoking, given 17 what you heard. 18 now, the next question that you reach, question 19 number 5, is damages. and i want to talk for a 20 minute about what the evidence is with respect to 21 damages. and there are two questions on the verdict 22 form about damages, question 5. two sections to 23 question 5. 24 one is the amount, if any, that ken ellis 25 sustained and then that martha schofield sustained. 3594 1 they are both on the verdict form as her two 2 children. and, of course, becky is deceased so 3 she is not on the verdict form. 4 so you heard the mortality tables. 25 years to 5 life was what her life expectancy was in '93. she 6 died at 57. 25 years that ken ellis and martha 7 schofield lost the companionship of their mother. 8 now, we go to work every day and we do our 9 jobs, we go about our business, but the value of our 10 life is really about our connections with the people 11 we love, our connections with our family. that is 12 what makes our life really meaningful, makes it 13 important. and so that relationship, i submit, is 14 an extraordinarily important and valuable 15 relationship, and for ken and martha, you heard the 16 testimony, she was their only parent. she was the 17 only one they had. 18 so what -- 25 years lost of christmases with 19 your mother, 25 years of thanksgivings, birthday 20 parties, weddings, 25 years lost. and i will not 21 represent to you that i'm an expert in knowing how 22 to put a value on something like that. i'm going to 23 leave it to you, the collective consciousness of 24 you. but there is some things that you ought to 25 think about. 3595 1 when you think about harm and the amount of 2 harm, and the amount of harm, the amount of loss, 3 i'd like to think that there are things that are 4 small harm, you break your arm, right? and it is 5 small because it stops me from doing a couple of 6 things but it heals and it is better and after a 7 short time i'm going to be normal. 8 and then there is a group i call the medium 9 harms. you hurt your back on your job and you are 10 out for a year and troubled, i call that a medium 11 harm, but eventually you get back. 12 now talk about the harms that are large. and 13 those are the ones that are permanent, that cause 14 pain and suffering that lasts, and i think you saw 15 the evidence of that on the stand with martha and 16 with ken. this is a large harm. it is a pain that 17 lasts, and it is life altering. 18 now, it is very important to note what you write 19 on here really has nothing to do with what the other 20 evidence in the case is. this is the -- the full 21 amount. and the judge instructed you, that if you 22 reduce it, the percentages you put on the prior 23 question, they will be applied, but this has to be 24 the full amount. so when you are looking at this 25 question, really just that question, what is the 3596 1 loss of betty owens' value to ken ellis and martha 2 schofield, what is the -- the full amount? what is 3 the full amount of that loss? 4 it has two parts. the first part is the pain 5 and suffering as a result of her injury and death. 6 and that is the pain watching her die. and in this 7 case, that was pretty powerful. very powerful. 8 what is the total compensation for that loss? 9 and then the second part is the loss of his 10 parental companionship and instruction and guidance. 11 it is the same question for martha and for ken for 12 those two pieces. 13 and i'm going to let -- i'm not going to give 14 you a number. i think the number that collectively 15 you believe would be the full amount of that loss, 16 that is good for us. 17 but let me suggest that one way of thinking 18 about it is to ask, because we live in a capitalist 19 society, we are capitalists here. so what something 20 is worth is often what somebody would pay for it or 21 what you would give it up for. just ask yourself 22 what would you have to pay for somebody to say, i'll 23 give up 25 years with my mother, how much would you 24 have to pay somebody for them to raise their hand 25 and say, that is a good deal? i'll take that deal. 3597 1 of course, he was not given the choice to raise 2 his hand. it is a large harm. 3 and the last question is punitive damages. and 4 this is the part where you have to decide do they 5 get punished or do they get a pass. 6 and the stuff we have been talking about, their 7 conduct, their lies, their greed, their selfishness, 8 their profit motive, all of that goes into the 9 decision. under the circumstances, whether by clear 10 and convincing evidence, punitive damages are 11 warranted and the judge instructed you about that 12 and when those -- read those instructions, you have 13 to think, r. j. reynolds. the conduct causing loss 14 to the plaintiff was so gross and flagrant as to 15 show a reckless disregard for human life -- that is 16 r. j. reynolds -- or the safety of persons exposed 17 to the effect. 18 fortunately for us, our cancer-causing 19 cigarettes are a habit they cannot break. 20 the conduct showed an entire lack of care that 21 r. j. reynolds must have been consciously 22 indifferent to the consequences. 23 the conduct showed an entire lack of care that 24 r. j. reynolds must have wantonly or recklessly 25 disregarded the safety and welfare of the public. 3598 1 look at the surgeon general's report. the 2 conduct showed such reckless indifference of others 3 to be equivalent of an intentional violation of 4 those rights. that is the evidence that we have built. 5 and you have to decide do they get punished, or do 6 you give them a pass? 7 and the judge will tell you that it is about 8 punishing them but also deterring this kind of 9 conduct, deterring it. 10 in determining whether punitive damages are 11 warranted, you may consider similar harms suffered 12 by other parties -- persons not parties to this 13 lawsuit in assessing the reprehensibility or 14 wrongfulness of r. j. reynolds' acts as proven in 15 this case. 16 you can consider the amount of harm this 17 caused, 480,000 deaths every year, you can consider 18 that in determining if they should be punished, or 19 they get a pass. 20 so i do not want to talk again about all their 21 deceptions and lies. i want to focus on two things 22 they did that i think are particularly egregious in 23 addition to what i talked about, and, that is, they 24 marketed this product who they knew would kill our 25 kids, to people whose brains were not developed yet, 3599 1 people's brains they could establish that addiction. 2 you saw those documents, those intentional documents 3 marketing it to 14-year-olds. 4 manufacturers have studied the 14- to 5 20-year-old market. creating a fad in that market 6 is a bonanza. a bonanza because you can addict 7 those kids and sell them cigarettes for the rest of 8 their lives until they die from your product. a 9 bonanza. this conduct has to be punished. 10 they talked about the -- the delicate, 11 sensitive nature of our kids and how to market their 12 product to tie into that. the expected or 13 derived -- first, for the presmoker, those we 14 have not got yet, and learn the physical effects of 15 smoking are largely unknown, unneeded or actually 16 quite unpleasant or awkward. 17 the expected or derived psychological effects 18 are largely responsible for influencing the 19 presmoker to try smoking and provide sufficient 20 motivation during the learning period to keep the 21 learner going despite the physical unpleasantness 22 and awkwardness. 23 and they targeted their marketing and their 24 products at our kids. 25 and this one probably is the -- one of the 3600 1 hardest to read. 2 it says that: finally, the older establishment 3 is preaching against smoking -- if the older 4 establishment is preaching against smoking, the 5 anti-establishment sentiment discussed above would 6 cause the young to be defiant and smoke, thus a new 7 brand aimed at the young group should not in any way 8 be promoted as a health brand and perhaps should 9 carry some implied risk. in this sense, the warning 10 labels might actually be a plus for us. 11 they want kids to smoke. young kids. they 12 want young kids to smoke. 13 we also have the joe camel, and we talked about 14 the joe camel. 15 michael, if you will bring up p102a-194. 16 the evidence showed -- the evidence showed that 17 this type of advertising, smooth character appealed 18 to children and caused an increase in children's 19 smoking. the surgeon general's report talked about 20 it in the 1994 surgeon general's report. 21 all right. you can put that down. 22 bring up 387-05. the top paragraph. 23 younger adult smokers are critical to rjr's 24 long-term performance and profitability. therefore, 25 rjr should make a substantial long-term commitment 3601 1 of manpower -- it is hard to read, but that says and 2 money -- dedicated to younger adult smokers 3 programs. an unusually strong commitment from 4 executive management will be necessary, since major 5 volume payoffs may lag several years behind the 6 implementation of a successful younger adult smoker 7 strategy. 8 you will remember -- i will not go through all the 9 documents that said what they defined as younger 10 adult was 14 to 20-year-olds. it is document number 11 16, that is where they define the younger adult. 12 and the second thing i want to talk about is 13 manipulation of nicotine. 14 now, they said they did not add nicotine to 15 their product. you remember that testimony? what 16 the testimony is that they use the tobacco to blend 17 it so that they get the nicotine content they want 18 out of each cigarette. all right. they know that 19 the tobacco product is a vehicle for the delivery of 20 nicotine that they have to keep sufficient amounts 21 in there to supplier the smokers with necessary 22 requirements. and then they did studies about how 23 do we manipulate the nicotine levels in our 24 cigarettes. 25 you saw a document, p681, lucky 100 blend was 3602 1 treated with compound w to increase to yield 2.85 2 nicotine, a 21 percent increase. 3 this is document p240: 4 certainly the nicotine level of b&w, brown & 5 williamson, cigarettes given in the above table was 6 not obtained by accident. 7 they manipulate the nicotine level to keep 8 people addicted. 9 these are the additives that they put in their 10 product, including ammonia. and we talked about 11 ammonia and how it increases the effect of nicotine 12 in the cigarettes. 13 you now today get to decide do they get 14 punished for their lies, for their greed, for their 15 fraud or their marketing of their products to our 16 kids, for manipulating the nicotine to keep people 17 addicted? and then under clear and convincing 18 evidence, punitive damages have to be awarded in 19 this case. 20 now, i suspect that the defendants will talk a 21 lot about betty owens in their closing, talk a lot 22 about betty owens. they said in their opening that 23 she was street smart. i think the evidence showed 24 that betty owens is our most vulnerable. she is our 25 most vulnerable. the ones they aim our products 3603 1 towards the ones with an eighth grade education 2 struggling to make a life for themselves and their 3 kids in america. she is our most vulnerable, and 4 they want to blame her one hundred percent. that is who they 5 prey on, the eighth grade education, the working 6 people of our country, that is who they prey on. 7 they will talk a lot about betty owens, and i 8 suspect that mr. geise will. and when he does, i 9 want you to think what about rjr, talk about rjr. 10 they want to blame betty owens without accepting any 11 responsibility themselves. 12 i know you have listened to me for a long time. 13 mr. geise will get an opportunity to talk now, and 14 then i'll have a chance to come back and speak after 15 he does. i thank you for your attention, and i 16 appreciate the opportunity to be able to present 17 this evidence to you. 18 thank you. 16 rebuttal closing argument 17 ms. shamp: thank you. 18 good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. i know 19 that you are anxious to start deliberating, so i am 20 not going to speak for very long. i took a lot of 21 notes, responses to some of the things mr. geise 22 said, and i'm not going to go through all of them. 23 you have heard all the evidence and you have heard 24 argument from both of us. and now it is time for 25 you to go back there and make decisions based on 3721 1 what the evidence is that you heard. 2 i do want to touch on a few things that he 3 said just to point out some things that i think 4 were not correct or that there was more to the 5 story. he mentioned the flinstones and how we 6 had not told the whole story. i think if you 7 remember what the evidence was with respect to the 8 flinstones, we told you specifically it was a prime 9 time show, and then we had dr. goldberg talk about 10 the number of children who watch prime time shows. 11 and that that, in addition to the fact that 12 children associated cartoon characters with 13 increased smoking and there was testimony about 14 that. 15 but i also wanted to draw your attention to 16 something else, and that is exhibit 243. 17 you will remember that both mr. ellis and 18 ms. schofield said that they watched both gun smoke 19 and wagon train, and exhibit 243 is what 20 dr. goldberg put up during his testimony, which 21 showed the shows that were sponsored in 1963 by the 22 tobacco industry. and if you look there, both gun 23 smoke and -- gun smoke is on saturday at 24 10:00 o'clock, and they watched gun smoke, and 25 wagon train on the top part, there is it, monday, 3722 1 which was sponsored by r.j. reynolds, and that 2 started at 8:30 at night. 3 and so the evidence is that they were watching 4 shows at night that were sponsored by r.j. reynolds 5 or r.j. reynolds' predecessor in interest. 6 mr. geise said one thing i caught really 7 quickly. and he said this, he said, any addiction 8 she had did not cause her smoking. you remember he 9 said that. i think that sounds like he admits, of 10 course, that she did have an addiction, that she 11 was addicted, and that is of course question 1 on 12 the verdict form. 13 yeah, he talked about dr. wright and you will 14 remember that dr. wright did give a lot of 15 testimony because dr. wright was, in fact, the 16 chief medical examiner in miami dade county, and he 17 talked about the amount of testimony he gives 18 because he is the called in as the medical examiner 19 and what his expertise is in determining cause of 20 death. 21 and that is what he came in and told you was 22 the cause of death. and he told you that the cause 23 of death was lung cancer caused by smoking 24 cigarettes. i'm not going to go through all of the 25 lung cancer, i do not really think that is an issue 3723 1 in this case. she had lung cancer, it was caused 2 by cigarette smoking. you can look at exhibits 4 3 and 5. those are the medical records. they show 4 over and over again that she had lung cancer, that 5 she had lung cancer diagnosed in several different 6 ways, that she had lung cancer diagnosed at least 7 three times by biopsy or by bronchoscopy. 8 and i want to touch on the thing about what 9 the percentage is of the addiction today that was 10 listed in the new -- the brand new dsm v. and you 11 heard the testimony about that. the dsm v it is a 12 fifty percent, but in the dsm iv tr before that it was 13 80 to ninety percent, and we talked about that little 14 bit. 15 and then it is very likely that the percentage 16 of addicted smokers now is less than it was in 1993 17 and that is because we really changed -- 18 fortunately, the public health community has really 19 changed smoking behavior by limiting the places 20 that people can smoke. 21 it is very difficult for a person to smoke 22 throughout the day anymore if they are employed. it 23 is very difficult for them to smoke in just about 24 any public place. so that is forcing smokers to 25 cut back and cut back and cut back, and i just 3724 1 wanted to point that out. 2 i think the evidence is that in 1993, and 3 certainly in 1960, '70, '80 when ms. owens was 4 alive and smoking, that the prevalence of nicotine 5 addiction was 80 to ninety percent of regular smokers. 6 i also want to mention this idea about 7 relaxation and remind you about dr. werner's 8 testimony, that what happens when addicted smokers 9 goes without nicotine, when the nicotine substance 10 is withdrawn, that it causes the brain to go out of 11 balance, caused them to go out of equilibrium and 12 that feels bad, feels bad. 13 so that when they smoke and they tell people 14 it relaxes them, it is because their body is going 15 back to equilibrium. and so a report -- and 16 dr. werner testified to this -- of feeling relaxed 17 or calm or enjoying smoking is a feeling of going 18 back to equilibrium when an addicted smoker's body 19 has gone out of equilibrium because the nicotine 20 has been withdrawn. 21 it is interesting, mr. geise talked a lot about 22 the different choices that betty owens made and 23 whether she had tried hard enough to quit smoking. 24 but you will have the verdict form and that is not 25 on the verdict form, whether she tried hard enough. 3725 1 the question is whether she was addicted, that is 2 the question that you have to answer. 3 and again, he mentioned -- and i thought it 4 was a strange argument to make in 2014, but 5 mr. geise said that in america that teenagers who 6 have children are mature enough to make that 7 decision. i think that is a strange argument to 8 make, that a teenager who has to -- a child is 9 mature enough to make those choices. i think the 10 evidence that you heard is that the 13-year-old, a 11 15-year-old, brains are not fully developed when 12 she became a regular smoker. 13 another argument that he made -- and he showed 14 you a lot about the information that is publically 15 available, that there was information that the 16 surgeon general had said and various other people, 17 and he put up some articles from a long time ago 18 that people knew the hazards associated with 19 smoking, everybody knew because these people were 20 making these statements in the reader's digest, et 21 cetera. 22 well, look at your jury instructions. because 23 the jury instructions say that the defendant is not 24 entitled to question or challenge the engle 25 findings. and what the engle findings show -- pull 3726 1 up finding 4 for me, please. 2 the engle findings show that r.j. reynolds 3 concealed or omitted material information that was 4 not otherwise known. what they withheld are things 5 the public did not know and they are not allowed to 6 challenge that. that is established in this case 7 once you have established class membership. 8 mr. geise talked about the issue of reliance, 9 and it is an important point. i want to just 10 remind the court -- remind the jury about the 11 testimony of dr. figlar that said it is -- that r.j. 12 reynolds' customers both can and should rely upon 13 their statements and that they had an obligation to 14 tell the truth. 15 and essentially what the defendant is arguing 16 is, is that it does not matter. their argument is 17 it just does not matter that we did not tell people 18 what we knew. that is their argument that it 19 does not matter. even though they admit that 20 they are the ones that have to know about their 21 product, that they have to disclose what they know 22 about their product. 23 mr. geise talked about jacksonville being the 24 city of -- the river city and the bridges and that 25 there is no bridge. but mr. geise cannot get around 3727 1 the bridge that is the national enquirer. the 2 evidence shows that the national enquirer was 3 written by stanley frank -- this article was 4 written by stanley frank, who was an employee of 5 hill & knowlton, and that the activities of hill & 6 knowlton were directed by the tirc and dr. figlar 7 testified that anything the tirc did was approved 8 by r.j. reynolds. 9 all right. so this article is approved by 10 r.j. reynolds, okay? a statement by them in a 11 paper she read regularly. 12 that is a bridge. it is a bridge between their 13 conduct and betty owens. it is just one of the 14 bridges, but that is a bridge that they cannot 15 ignore. 16 as the court will instruct you, you have the 17 ability to make inferences from the facts and the 18 facts that are presented when she was a regular 19 reader of the national enquirer. 20 the evidence is also that during the 1950s and 21 '60s almost everybody switched to filters because 22 the public perceived that they were safer. and 23 you will have exhibit 977, which discusses that 24 specifically, that the defendants were falsely 25 advertising filtered cigarettes and it created a 3728 1 public perception that they were safer. 2 we talked about the coupons. and the reason 3 we put in the coupons and we showed you the coupons 4 is -- and we also showed you the advertisements, 5 that the coupons were on belairs. those are 6 cigarettes manufactured by the defendant and they 7 promoted the belair cigarettes. and we showed you 8 some of the advertisements for belair where it said 9 cleaner smoking and had the couple in the window 10 with the snow falling behind them, that was a 11 belair advertisement, and it connects betty owens 12 to r.j. reynolds advertising. the coupons connect 13 them together. all right. 14 and i hope i do not want to belabor this again 15 because i was surprised when mr. geise said that we 16 had to somehow tape something together with respect 17 to the charles golden writing this -- the national 18 enquirer story. we had to tape it together because 19 the defendants left you with the impression -- 20 until we came in and brought you that ftc report, 21 they left you with the impression that charles 22 golden had written something previously and he was 23 a real person. 24 and what proctor said and what goldberg said, 25 which was absolutely true, he was not a real 3729 1 person. it was the employee of hill & knowlton, 2 stanley frank, who wrote that. 3 again, i think you know what the evidence is 4 that all of the brands, lucky, winston, belair, 5 camel, kool, salem, all brands manufactured by r.j. 6 reynolds, there is a stipulation to that effect, and 7 the brands that were manufactured by either philip 8 morris or lorillard did not contribute or cause 9 injury in this case. 10 so finally, i want to touch on punitive 11 damages because mr. geise spent some time talking 12 about punitive damages. and what he said was -- 13 and he said it several times, was that mr. ellis, 14 if you get to that portion of the verdict form, 15 mr. ellis would have already been fully 16 compensated. 17 and that is because that section on the verdict 18 form which talks about the full amount should be 19 written in that section. all right. so when you 20 get to this section of punitive damages, mr. geise 21 was saying that mr. ellis had already been 22 compensated. 23 you will remember in voir dire, i asked that 24 question. i said that at the end of the case we 25 will ask for punitive damages and punitive damages 3730 1 go to the plaintiff, but that should play no role, 2 no role in your determination as to whether 3 punitive damages are warranted. where they go 4 should play no role. all right. 5 the question and the only question is whether 6 r.j. reynolds' conduct merits being punished and 7 whether you feel like -- that they need to be 8 deterred. that is the only question. and whether 9 or not he has been fully compensated should play no 10 role in your decision as to whether to award 11 punitive damages and whether plaintiff is entitled 12 to punitive damages. 13 i want to bring up 287 because i think 14 mr. geise talked about the new r.j. reynolds, a 15 different company. and i started my closing 16 argument with this document, the document which 17 shows that if -- i think -- sorry, "once it becomes 18 clear that such action is necessary for the 19 successful defense of our present and future suits, 20 we will promptly remove all such documents from our 21 files." 22 mr. geise relied upon dr. figlar's testimony 23 to say it was a new and improved r.j. reynolds so 24 that you do not have to punish them. but is that 25 really what r.j. reynolds -- what the testimony was 3731 1 from dr. figlar? the evidence is about all those 2 changes is right here. it is in the 2010 surgeon 3 general's report. all of those changes that they 4 talked about, unfortunately -- unfortunately, we 5 find out that the public health community is always 6 a step behind r.j. reynolds. 7 they will say things. and then we find out a 8 step behind that what they are doing is, in fact, 9 not what they say, that it is not aiding the public 10 health and that is consistent. 11 you remember i asked him about snus and he got 12 all angry about that because the public health 13 community said that that is actually a -- 14 contributing to young people smoking, initiation of 15 tobacco use. you remember on their website, they 16 say that nicotine is not harmful and yet the 17 surgeon general says, in fact, that nicotine harms 18 the fetus. it harms the brain of young people who 19 are smoking. nicotine itself. 20 we are always a step behind them, including the 21 2010 surgeon general's report where it says, "at 22 the same time tobacco company documents all are so 23 clearly demonstrate that the industry understood 24 that smokers would not achieve the claimed 25 deliveries because of smoker compensation. in 3732 1 contrast to industry awareness, the various ways 2 that cigarettes were physically modified and the 3 nature and level of compensation in response to 4 design changes were not well understood by the 5 parties outside of the tobacco industry itself. 6 "public health officials have little basis to 7 anticipate the degree to which manufacturers could 8 design cigarettes to allow the smoker to draw more 9 smoke and nicotine from cigarettes than was 10 represented by the machine-measured yields of tar 11 and nicotine." 12 we are always a step behind. they have not 13 made changes to make their product safe. 14 the question you have to ask, based on all the 15 evidence you have heard, is whether you punish them 16 or you give them a pass. 17 ladies and gentlemen, i want to thank you for 18 your service, and i want to thank you on behalf of 19 myself and my team and my client. but i want to 20 make it very clear that the service you provide is 21 not to us. it is not to me or my client or even to 22 r.j. reynolds. the service you provide, by sitting 23 in this jury, is a service to this country and to 24 this community and to our society. 25 and the decision you make, based upon the 3733 1 evidence you have heard in this case, is important 2 to all of those people. and how you respond to 3 that evidence, how you respond to the evidence 4 you have heard, is important to our community, to our 5 country, to our society. 6 ladies and gentlemen, the word "verdict" means 7 to speak the truth. "ver," it is from veritas, 8 which means true, and dict from dictaphone or 9 dictate, means speak. what it means is speak the 10 truth. and so we ask you when you go back in that 11 jury room to render a verdict that speaks the truth 12 in this case. 13 thank you so much.
