2 ms. parker: may it please the court. 3 good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. i have 4 an opportunity now to talk to you again at the end 5 of the case. i want to also thank you for your 6 service as jurors here, and i want to thank you on 7 behalf of my client, r.j. reynolds, and also on 8 behalf of our trial team, john walker and ben hill 9 over here as well. 10 you have all been sitting here day after day. 11 and, you know, it is two weeks tomorrow that you have 12 all been sworn in as jurors. you have been patient. 13 you have been paying attention and listening to the 14 evidence, and we appreciate it very much. 15 now, when i gave my opening statement, i told 16 you at the very beginning that i was only going to 17 talk about one person, that this case is about one 18 person and one person only, and that is alex gelep. 19 and that is still the case here. 20 this case is about alex gelep. it is about 21 his cancer. it is about his choices, his smoking, 22 his decisions. and ultimately this case is about 23 whether the plaintiff here is entitled to recover 24 money damages from reynolds and from philip 25 morris. that is what we are here about. 34 1 now, mr. acosta said in his opening that 2 reynolds and philip morris is the seller of the 3 cigarettes. and that is true. but that is only 4 part of the story. our society is fully aware 5 that cigarettes have helped -- have decided that 6 cigarettes should be a legal product for adults 7 who choose to smoke. 8 and i told you in my opening statement 9 cigarettes can cause lung cancer. we do not 10 dispute that. cigarettes can be addictive. we 11 do not dispute that. and some people who smoke are 12 addicted. we do not dispute that. 13 but this case is about mr. gelep. and 14 congress and our society already knows that 15 cigarettes cause lung cancer and that cigarettes 16 can be addictive. but we have freedoms here in 17 the united states. we have freedoms in the 18 united states to engage -- to choose to engage in 19 risky behavior. we can do that. we can choose to 20 drink alcohol. we can choose to smoke cigarettes. 21 we can choose to go snow skiing. we can choose to 22 race cars. we can choose not to eat right. 23 our society allows cigarettes to be sold. 24 and, in fact, you heard the evidence that 25 mr. gelep and his wife owned a store where they 35 1 sold cigarettes. and mr. gelep sold cigarettes in 2 that store because he believed that adults should 3 have the right to choose to smoke just like he 4 did. 5 he made the decisions when he wanted to 6 smoke, and he made the decisions when he wanted to 7 quit. and that is what he told his doctor. when 8 he wanted to quit, he quit. when he did not want 9 to cut down, he did not cut down. when he decided 10 to quit, he was able to do that with no 11 assistance. he was able to quit cold turkey 12 successfully with no assistance. 13 but rather than spend the trial talking about 14 mr. gelep, a lot of this case, a lot of what you 15 heard from the plaintiffs has been about cigarette 16 smoking in general terms. but as i said at the 17 very beginning, we do not dispute cigarettes cause 18 lung cancer. we do not dispute that cigarettes can 19 be addictive. but that does not answer the 20 question that we are here about today, which is 21 about mr. gelep. 22 now, what i'm going to do this afternoon with 23 my time is talk about mr. gelep and to go over 24 what the evidence has been about him. and you are 25 going to be given a verdict form, mr. acosta 36 1 showed you up there on the screen, with that one 2 question. and ultimately in order to answer this 3 question, you are going to have to consider 4 mr. gelep and the circumstances of his life. 5 now, after the lawyers finish the closing 6 arguments here, judge rondolino will give you the 7 instructions on what the law is, like he told you. 8 what i'm going to do is go over what we think 9 those instructions will be and apply those to the 10 evidence that you have heard in this case about 11 mr. gelep. 12 first of all, as judge rondolino has told you 13 the plaintiff here has the burden of proof. that 14 means the plaintiff has to prove to you every 15 element of the claim. every element of the claim 16 has to be proven to you by the plaintiff. 17 so if we will break this down, there is three 18 elements here. there is primary lung cancer, 19 addiction, and legal cause. all of those have to 20 be proven to you by the plaintiff, and all of 21 those are on the verdict form. and if the 22 evidence fails to establish any part of that -- 23 any part of it, then you should find in favor of 24 reynolds and philip morris. 25 and that is important. because if we had -- 37 1 if we had not stood up at all, if we had put up 2 zero evidence in the case, the plaintiff still has 3 to meet their burden of proof. they have to prove 4 to you everything that is in that question. but we 5 did put on evidence. and our evidence shows that 6 not only did the plaintiff fail to prove their 7 case, but they really do not have a case. 8 now, the threshold issue is whether mr. gelep 9 had primary lung cancer. and by that, i think we 10 all know we are talking about lung cancer that 11 originated in his lung, not cancer that spread to 12 his lung from some other part of his body. and if 13 the plaintiff cannot meet that threshold issue, 14 the case is over. 15 the plaintiff also has to prove that 16 addiction is the legal cause of mr. gelep's 17 illness. in other words, the plaintiff has to 18 prove that mr. gelep was addicted and that his 19 alleged addiction is the reason that mr. gelep 20 developed his illness. but the plaintiff is not 21 going to be able to do that -- has not been able 22 to do that, because even if you assume somehow 23 that mr. gelep had cancer caused by smoking, it 24 still cannot be said that that was but for the 25 addiction. there is more than one part here, more 38 1 than one thing the plaintiff has to prove. 2 now, in order to prove their case, the 3 plaintiffs are asking you to discount mr. gelep's 4 own words, what he told his doctors. they are 5 asking you to discount his own actions, what he 6 did in his life. and they are asking you to 7 discount the fact that mr. gelep believed that 8 other consumers also had the right to choose to 9 smoke. that is what he believed. that is what he 10 stood for. and that is why he sold cigarettes 11 himself. 12 so as i go over the evidence, i think that 13 you will see the plaintiff here just does not have a 14 case in this case about mr. gelep. 15 now, we have presented evidence to you so that 16 you would get to know mr. gelep, you could get to 17 know him as a person, you could get to know his 18 medical situation, you could get to know about his 19 illnesses so that you can make the decisions that 20 are going to be before you here. 21 remember this medical record. mr. gelep 22 does not want to cut down on smoking. and the 23 doctor who wrote that, dr. hansen, who was the 24 older doctor who came whose son is married to 25 gelep's daughter, on the stand, dr. hansen said 39 1 this is what mr. gelep told him. 2 now, as you are considering the case, it is 3 really important to remember what the 4 circumstances are about mr. gelep and what the 5 circumstances are not. this is not a gentleman 6 who tried everything in the book to quit but 7 was not able to. this is not the kind of person 8 who woke up in the middle of the night because he 9 needed a cigarette. he was not the kind of person 10 who was tormented by smoking, who hated smoking, 11 who wanted to quit but just could not. that is not 12 mr. gelep, and there is been no evidence that that 13 describes mr. gelep. and, in fact, the true 14 picture is exactly the opposite. 15 let me show you these photos. these are all 16 of mr. gelep. these are all in evidence. this is 17 a happy gentleman. this is a happy guy who 18 enjoyed smoking. he was not somebody who is 19 tormented by smoking. some smokers like mr. gelep 20 enjoy smoking and they do not want to quit. and 21 even the plaintiff's experts who came to court 22 agreed to that. and according to dr. seiden, who 23 came to court last friday and testified, 24 mrs. gelep said -- and mrs. gelep was the person 25 who knew mr. gelep the best -- if he wanted to 40 1 quit smoking, he would quit; if he did not, he 2 did not. it was a matter of what he wanted to do. 3 he was a willing smoker. he was a willing 4 smoker. he knew there were health risks to 5 smoking. he knew that from his own personal 6 experience starting with the kidney cancer back in 7 1969, but those risks were not important enough to 8 him for him to decide that he did not want to 9 smoke. and, again, he said he does not want to cut 10 down. 11 now, this case is not about whether 12 cigarettes can be addictive or whether some people 13 who smoke may be addicted because, as i've said 14 already, they can be. but unless you yourself 15 want to quit, you are not going to be successful. 16 so you have to look at the circumstances of 17 the particular individual instead of just talking 18 generally about cigarettes or about addiction. 19 and the fact that cigarettes are addictive and 20 maybe that some people who smoke may be addicted 21 is not a question on this verdict form. it is not 22 something that you are going to have to decide in 23 this case. 24 let me go now to the first point, and that is 25 the medical case. and that is that mr. gelep did 41 1 not have primary lung cancer. and that is he did 2 not have cancer that started, that originated in 3 his lung. the plaintiff has the burden to prove 4 that with evidence. but for the plaintiff's case, 5 where was the pathology? where was the pathology? 6 dr. groff testified. dr. groff came -- was 7 the first witness for the plaintiff. he said he 8 never reviewed the pathology. he said, i'm just a 9 psychiatrist. 10 dr. goldman -- dr. goldman is the one from 11 here in tampa that mr. acosta talked about. he 12 did not even know that there was pathology in 13 existence. he did not even know that until i told 14 him. and, of course, he had no opinion. 15 dr. cummings -- now, dr. cummings is the 16 expert that mr. acosta brought from buffalo, 17 new york. he is the one who was the public health 18 specialist who started a stop -- ran a 19 stop-smoking clinic. dr. cummings said he was not 20 qualified beyond public health epidemiology. he 21 had not reviewed the pathology. 22 dr. dunn, who is the first one of the 23 treating physicians who came that mr. acosta 24 called -- now, dr. dunn is the one who performed 25 that bronchoscopy procedure where they went in and 42 1 got the tissue. and dr. dunn said he did not look 2 at it. he sent it to a pathologist. and, also 3 dr. dunn, recall, did not even know that mr. gelep 4 had kidney cancer or had cancer that was in his 5 abdomen -- in his abdominal fluid. i had to tell 6 him that on cross when i asked him questions. he 7 did not even know that. he treated him for a very, 8 very limited period of time. 9 and then dr. hansen, again, the elderly 10 doctor whose son is married to the gelep girl, he 11 said he never reviewed the pathology either. 12 so ask yourselves. the plaintiff has the 13 burden of proof. why did not the plaintiff bring 14 the pathologist to testify? we had to bring the 15 pathology to court. we had to introduce this 16 evidence, what is left over, of the pathology. and 17 it is marked, and it is in evidence. 18 now, dr. bennett, who came to court monday, 19 yesterday, and he -- he looked under the 20 microscope and he showed you -- he demonstrated to 21 you what the pathology shows us about mr. gelep's 22 cancers. and mr. gelep had multiple cancers. 23 remember this chart. he had kidney cancer back in 24 1969. he was operated on in early 1970. he had 25 kidney cancer again in 1996. he had colon cancer 43 also in 1996. and, again, this is all that same 2 general area of your body. he had cancer in his 3 peritoneal fluid that was all throughout his 4 abdominal cavity. and he had cancer located in 5 his lung. but that cancer came from elsewhere. 6 it did not start with his lung. and the key point 7 is where that cancer originated. you need to know 8 where a cancer originated in order to determine 9 what caused it. 10 and i know you-all have heard this several 11 times throughout the trial, but if the cancer 12 starts in your kidney, it is called a kidney 13 primary or primary kidney cancer. if a cancer 14 starts in your colon, it is called a primary colon 15 cancer. if it starts in your lung, it is called 16 primary lung cancer. but a cancer that starts 17 somewhere else in your body and then spreads to 18 your lung is not a primary lung cancer. 19 the bottom line here is that mr. gelep did 20 not have cancer caused by smoking. his cancers -- 21 his multiple cancers, were all connected. they 22 were all related to the same disease process 23 caused by his genetic defect. that is what caused 24 him to have these cancers located all over. none 25 of mr. acosta's witnesses had reviewed the 44 1 pathology, and none of them had reviewed the 2 genetic dna background to this. 3 and in addition, besides not bringing a 4 pathologist, the plaintiff did not take steps to 5 preserve evidence that would have been useful in 6 this case. there could have been medical tests 7 conducted when mr. gelep was alive, but he refused 8 some of those tests, and he did not have others. 9 remember he did not have a colonoscopy. he refused 10 the chest x-ray. he refused a rectal exam. 11 there could be tests done on tissue samples 12 from his lung, but this is all we have. the lung 13 tissue was not preserved. there could have been 14 tests on his body, on his tissue through an 15 autopsy, but the family did not have an autopsy. 16 those are three different opportunities that 17 the plaintiff had. but instead, they are coming to 18 court and asking you to speculate that mr. gelep's 19 lung cancer started in his lung and was caused by 20 smoking. 21 and that is particularly troubling here when 22 you consider that the gelep's son paul -- paul 23 gelep is a lawyer. and you have heard the evidence 24 that he is the person who was behind filing the 25 lawsuit. he signed the complaint. he met with 45 1 the doctors. he attended the depositions. and, 2 remember, he named himself as the beneficiary of 3 the complaint. at first he said he did not know 4 that. remember i got the complaint and i showed 5 it to him to refresh his memory? and then he 6 agreed. he signed the complaint that started this 7 lawsuit that named himself as a beneficiary. 8 and, ladies and gentlemen, less than a week 9 before this trial started, paul gelep prepared a 10 document that you have not seen yet. this is a 11 document that his mother signed as the personal 12 representative of his father's estate and it 13 transfers property, real estate, from the estate 14 to herself. that is an official exhibit. it is an 15 official court document that is going to be in 16 evidence that you can take back with you to the 17 jury room. 18 so now on the one hand, the plaintiff is 19 saying she has the capacity to sign legal 20 documents that are filed in court transferring 21 property on march 4th, less than a week before 22 this trial started, but on the other hand, you 23 heard mr. acosta say during his opening that she 24 was confused. and that is their excuse as to why 25 you should discount what she said. so i encourage 46 1 you, when you go back to the jury room and 2 deliberate, look at this document that is in 3 evidence. 4 now, we are -- i said this in my openings. 5 we are very sorry that mr. gelep had cancer. and 6 it is always a tragedy when you lose a family 7 member. the judge is going to -- judge rondolino 8 is going to give you the legal instructions, and 9 that includes an instruction that you should not 10 be swayed from the performance of your duty by 11 prejudice, sympathy, or any other sentiment. so i 12 ask you to focus on the facts as you are evaluating 13 this evidence. 14 now, this has been a long trial. it is been 15 two weeks now, and you have heard a lot of evidence. 16 but i just cannot emphasize this enough. if the 17 plaintiff has not met her initial burden to prove 18 that mr. gelep had cancer -- primary lung cancer, 19 cancer that originated in his lung, then the case 20 is over. they did not call a pathologist, and 21 they did not preserve all the tissue. 22 now, mr. geraghty, on behalf of philip 23 morris, and i have both said in our opening 24 statements, and i've said again this afternoon, 25 cigarettes can cause lung cancer. and there are 47 1 many parts of our society that are involved and 2 engaged in selling cigarettes because they believe 3 that the public has a right to choose. and even 4 the plaintiff's own witnesses, their own experts 5 agree you cannot look at statistics alone. 6 statistics can only tell you about a population as 7 a whole, but they cannot tell you about a 8 particular individual like mr. gelep. 9 now, dr. cummings -- again, he is the one who 10 came from buffalo, new york, and he said his 11 specialty was epidemiology. and i asked him and 12 he agreed that that is the study of populations, 13 not the study of individuals. 14 so the plaintiff's position is, well, he had 15 cancer -- their position is he had cancer -- they 16 found the cancer in his lung. so that is it. he 17 was a smoker, so it must have been caused by 18 smoking. but that is not consistent with the 19 facts here. and the statistics and general 20 statements alone cannot satisfy the plaintiff's 21 burden of proof. 22 let me give you an example about why you 23 cannot rely on general statements and statistics. 24 if you looked at ten people -- just randomly ten 25 people and you knew they had died, if you looked 48 1 at just statistics, that would mean that six or 2 seven out of those ten people passed away from 3 heart disease, because that is six or -- 60 to 4 seventy percent of people die from heart disease. so 5 if that is all you knew as the statistics, the 6 general information, you can say, here are ten 7 people who have passed away; six or seven of them 8 must have passed away from heart disease. but if 9 you look at the specific facts of those 10 individuals instead of looking just generally, if 11 you look at those people, those ten people could 12 have been on an elevator that fell 20 floors and 13 all ten of them passed away not because of heart 14 disease, but from the injury of the elevator 15 crash. 16 you cannot just consider these general 17 statements about cigarettes causing lung cancer. 18 pardon me. you have to look at the individual, 19 about mr. gelep. 20 now, mr. gelep had cancer in his abdomen that 21 started in his colon. you have two parts to your 22 colon. there is the small intestine and the large 23 intestine. you heard dr. bennett say the most 24 likely origination point here was his colon, his 25 large intestine. and that cancer spread 49 1 throughout his body. and the medical term for 2 that is metastasize. 3 and one of the places it spread was his 4 abdominal fluid, his peritoneal fluid. and that is 5 throughout your abdomen. it goes all the way from 6 your diaphragm all the way down to your colon. 7 cancer cells were found in that abdominal fluid, 8 and here's the report that shows that. you have 9 seen that before. 10 both the plaintiff's experts, dr. goldman and 11 dr. hansen agree mr. gelep had cancer in his 12 abdominal fluid. there is the report. 13 now, there were tests done on those cells 14 that came -- those cancer cells that came out of 15 his abdominal fluid. 16 if we could pull that up. 17 that is the report about the special staining 18 that dr. bennett told you about, the special 19 staining here including this cea stain that was 20 done by mr. gelep's treating doctors on the cancer 21 cells that came from his abdominal fluid. and 22 those tests were strongly positive -- called it 23 strong positivity for this cea. as dr. bennett 24 explained, 95 five percent of colon cancers stain 25 positive for cea. 50 1 one key issue in this case are those stains, 2 because they show colon cancer was in -- had 3 already spread and was in his abdominal fluid. 4 but mr. acosta and the plaintiff did not bring an 5 expert to talk about those stains. 6 dr. bennett testified yesterday -- and i'm 7 going to go over his qualifications very briefly. 8 he is a medical doctor, pathologist, forensic 9 medical examiner, completed over 8,000 autopsies. 10 he is the only witness in this case who is qualified 11 to answer the questions here about the pathology, 12 about the staining, and about the big picture of 13 what happened. 14 now, dr. bennett prepared this list over here 15 that he showed you yesterday, and i want to go 16 over that briefly. this is why mr. gelep did not 17 have primary lung cancer. first of all, where it 18 was located. 19 if we could pull up that. 20 the expert report say it was in the 21 parenchyma, which is the tissue part of the lung. 22 it was not found in his airways. and that is where 23 primary lung cancer usually starts. 24 the cell type is the second thing that 25 dr. bennett listed. the pathologist who reviewed 51 1 the tissue from the lung -- because that tissue is 2 no longer available. that is not what is in these 3 boxes. they said that all they could -- all they 4 could say is that it is non-small cell. they could 5 not go further and say a particular type. 6 non-small cell is most consistent with this 7 being a metastasis as opposed to being a primary 8 lung cancer. most colon cancers are non-small 9 cell. and if this had been a primary lung cancer, 10 his doctors would have been able to determine 11 exactly what cell type it is instead of just 12 saying this general non-small cell description. 13 the third thing is the pattern of spread. 14 you heard dr. bennett talk about the footprint and 15 about the way it spread. the cancer spreads up. 16 it cannot spread down using the body's pathways 17 that dr. bennett explained to you. it is very 18 uncommon for lung cancer to spread without first 19 going to all those lymph nodes. and here there is 20 only a suggestion that it pushed up against one of 21 them. but there is plenty of evidence that his 22 cancer in his abdominal area had a footprint to go 23 to his lung. first of all, that is where the blood 24 goes and also the direct extension that 25 dr. bennett told you about. 52 1 number four, the symptoms. how many times 2 have we seen this record? when mr. gelep went to 3 the doctor in january, he told his doctor, cough, 4 nausea, diarrhea, seven-and-a-half-pound weight 5 loss. nausea, diarrhea, and weight loss are all 6 symptoms of colon cancer. 7 do you recall that when dr. goldman, the one 8 from moffitt here in tampa, was on the stand and 9 he at first disagreed with that. and then i asked 10 him what was on the moffitt cancer website, and 11 then he finally agreed those are symptoms of colon 12 cancer. 13 and number five is the pathology staining 14 that we talked about, the cea stain. that shows 15 this is a cancer that did not start in his lung, 16 that spread there from his colon. 17 those five reasons show why mr. gelep had 18 colon cancer that spread to his lung, not a 19 primary lung cancer. 20 now, why is there nothing in the medical 21 records about colon cancer? when mr. gelep got 22 sick in january of 1996, he went to his doctors. 23 that is when he told them he had those symptoms, 24 and they ran tests. and they found right there in 25 january he already had cancer located in his lung, excerpt - closing statements 3-24-09 53 1 located in his kidney, located in his abdominal 2 fluid, and he was terminal. it was inoperable, 3 and there was nothing that they could do other 4 than treat the symptoms. and so his doctors had 5 no reason -- they had no medical reason to conduct 6 tests to find out exactly where this cancer 7 started or what caused it. 8 and i also wanted to mention, in these 9 medical records from the plaintiff, this 10 exhibit 508 here, there is inconsistency from his 11 doctors -- from his treating doctors over what 12 kind of cancer that mr. gelep had. some records 13 say he had kidney cancer from 1969/1970, 20 years 14 ago, that metastasized -- that is "mets" -- to his 15 lung and to his kidney. you can go through those. 16 and one doctor said the cells from the cancer 17 in the peritoneal fluid looked more like the 18 kidney. so even under these medical records from 19 his doctors who were not even looking for it, the 20 cancer in mr. gelep's lung did not start there. 21 even under these records that the plaintiff has 22 put in evidence, these doctors say this was kidney 23 cancer that spread to his lung, that is not 24 primary lung cancer. 25 now, remember dr. bennett talked yesterday 54 about the role of fire fighters. and i hope 2 you-all remember that. he said fire fighters are 3 like the treating doctors. they are the ones who 4 get there on the scene and they have got to put the 5 fire out. and that is what mr. gelep's treating 6 doctors did. he came to them, he was sick, and 7 they took care of him. they treated him. 8 but dr. bennett is like the fire 9 investigators who come in after the fact and sort 10 through everything to determine what happened and 11 what started the fire. 12 remember this: mr. gelep never had a 13 colonoscopy. every witness has agreed that a 14 colonoscopy is the best way to determine whether 15 or not somebody has colon cancer. but he never 16 had one. his doctors never did that. he also 17 refused a rectal exam. and he also refused a 18 chest x-ray. nobody was -- none of his doctors -- 19 nobody was looking at the whole picture, and they 20 did not have any reason to have to. he was already 21 terminal. he was already inoperable at that 22 point. 23 but that is what a forensic medical examiner 24 like dr. bennett does. he comes in and he looks 25 at all these different things and he puts the 55 1 pieces together. 2 now, let me mention again, there is no lung 3 tissue here. and that is the gold standard. if 4 they had done an autopsy or they had preserved the 5 tissue from the lung, that lung tissue would be 6 available. and it could be tested and it could be 7 reviewed under the microscope. but we do not have 8 that. and the plaintiff is asking you to 9 speculate without that physical evidence that what 10 mr. gelep had was primary lung cancer that started 11 in his lung. 12 now, let us talk again about colon cancer. 13 because, remember, dr. bennett went over this part 14 with you. colon cancer is not caused by smoking. 15 it is associated with genetics, high fat diet, red 16 meat, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, family 17 history, age, chronic colon conditions, and 18 alcohol. remember, we went over that yesterday. 19 and dr. bennett said the same -- one of the 20 same genetic defects that causes kidney cancer 21 also causes colon cancer. all of mr. gelep's 22 cancers were related to his genetic predisposition 23 for cancer. 24 now, i want to talk for a minute about his 25 kidney cancer and tell you first and foremost -- 56 1 and you will see this on the verdict form -- there 2 is no claim in this case that you are going to have 3 to answer a question for about kidney cancer. the 4 only issue on the verdict form is about primary 5 lung cancer. there is no claim here on kidney 6 cancer. 7 the first kidney cancer was diagnosed when 8 mr. gelep was 42 years old in 1969. and we have 9 heard a lot of evidence about that. that is when 10 he had one of his kidneys removed. and then he 11 was diagnosed with kidney cancer again in 1996 12 when he was 68 years old. and you have heard that 13 over 50,000 people a year get kidney cancer, many 14 of whom are people who have never smoked. 15 all of these cancers are related because of 16 mr. gelep's genetic makeup. and all the evidence 17 points to this genetic defect that he was born 18 with that caused him to have these cancers. an 19 individual who develops -- who has that first 20 kidney cancer and then develops a second one, the 21 fact that you have that second kidney cancer is 22 strong proof -- you heard from the witness 23 stand -- strong proof there is a genetic component 24 to it. and then when you have an individual who 25 has all these different cancers located all these 57 1 different places, that is also evidence of 2 genetics. 3 now, here's the diagram dr. bennett went over 4 showing the cells that contain those genes. and 5 if you have a genetic susceptibility to cancer, 6 that means that you have a defect in one of those 7 genes. and mr. gelep, as you have heard, was 8 adopted. so we do not know his family history of 9 cancer. we do not have any way to find that out. 10 but we do know that family history and genetics 11 plays a significant role in the development of 12 cancer. and there are dna tests that could have 13 been performed to show whether mr. gelep had this 14 genetic defect, but we cannot do that because we 15 do not have that tissue. we do not have that 16 evidence to run the tests on. you heard 17 dr. bennett talk about that yesterday. and then 18 there was no autopsy. 19 even without those tests, though, we know 20 from the evidence we have, that mr. gelep's 21 cancers were caused by his genetic defect. 22 remember this chart that dr. bennett prepared. 23 the genetics are 10 to 13 times most likely to be 24 the cause. 25 now, you may be thinking, well, even if it 58 1 was genetics, his smoking played some role. and 2 when you hear the instructions on the law from the 3 court, the court is going to explain to you that 4 the question is whether addiction to cigarettes 5 that contain nicotine is a substantial 6 contributing cause. the legal question is not 7 whether smoking played any role, it has to be a 8 substantial contributing cause. and look at those 9 numbers. 10 so if you apply your common sense to the 11 facts of this case and if you base your decision 12 on this case about evidence about mr. gelep that 13 you have heard here in this courtroom, you will find 14 that the plaintiff has not met the initial 15 threshold burden to show that mr. gelep had a 16 primary lung cancer. and that means the case is 17 over and you would answer no. 18 again, we did not have to put up any evidence. 19 the plaintiff has the burden of proof. 20 i want to talk for a minute about the death 21 certificate. the death certificate was signed by 22 the older doctor who came in, mr. -- i'm sorry -- 23 dr. hansen, again, the one whose son is married to 24 the gelep's daughter. he signed the death 25 certificate. and the death certificate says that 59 1 the cause of death was adenocarcinoma of the lung. 2 but remember, there is not a single pathology 3 report, not a one that says that. all the 4 pathologist could say is that it was non-small 5 cell. we do not know where dr. hansen came up with 6 the idea that it was adenocarcinoma, but there is 7 no evidence in the pathology -- the pathology 8 reports to support that. he was just wrong. 9 mr. gelep's death was caused by this 10 abdominal fluid buildup. you recall -- and it is 11 in the medical records and dr. bennett talked 12 about it yesterday -- the doctors removed two 13 liters -- if you go to the grocery store and buy a 14 bottle of coke -- we are talking about two liters 15 that were removed on one occasion and four liters 16 that was drained on a different occasion. that is 17 a lot. 18 and so when you get to this question, again, 19 on the verdict form, the plaintiff has to prove 20 that but for the cigarettes that mr. gelep smoked, 21 this injury would not have occurred. and the 22 plaintiff is not going to be able to meet this 23 initial threshold issue of establishing that there 24 was a primary lung cancer. 25 let me turn now to the next issue in the 60 1 case, and that is, did mr. gelep smoke because he 2 could not quit or because he could quit and just 3 did not want to? but before i do that, i want to 4 address something briefly. 5 mr. acosta talked a lot about company 6 documents during his opening statement. he showed 7 you documents that are in evidence here. what do 8 those documents have to do with mr. gelep? ask 9 yourselves that. and are these documents finals 10 or are they drafts? one of the documents that 11 mr. acosta just showed you, which is 12 exhibit 545 -- it is not a good quality copy -- it 13 has a notation at the top that mr. acosta did not 14 show you. if you fill that in, it says "draft." 15 this is a draft. 16 so when you are looking at the company 17 documents, look at them carefully and ask, what do 18 they have to do with mr. gelep? are you just 19 being shown a cherry-picked sentence or two out of 20 a document? what do the documents have to do with 21 the cigarettes that mr. gelep smoked? my point 22 is, you need to look at the whole picture, not 23 just a cherry-picked sentence or two out of a 24 document that is marked "draft." 25 all right. let me talk now about addiction. 61 1 mr. gelep's death was not caused by an addiction 2 to cigarettes, it was caused by something else. 3 it was caused by his choice to smoke even though 4 he knew he was capable of quitting, because he did 5 quit. the best evidence there is about whether a 6 smoker can quit is whether they were able to quit, 7 whether they did quit. 8 we know mr. gelep was able to quit because he 9 did quit here, and that is documented in the 10 medical records. the evidence is that he quit at 11 least four times in his life. he quit in 1969 12 when he was diagnosed with kidney cancer. he quit 13 cold turkey. in 1974, he quit. and that is when 14 the attorney's son, paul, testified that they had 15 met for a duke-florida homecoming game and his 16 father had quit then. in 1987, he quit for six 17 months. and this is when the son, paul, sent the 18 letter from the grandson. this is mr. acosta's 19 letter that is in evidence where mr. acosta says 20 the longest time he quit was in approximately 1987 21 for six months. and he quit the fourth time in 22 january of 1996 for nine or ten months, and he 23 quit told cold turkey. plus, there is this medical 24 record that says he quit for eight years. 25 mr. gelep quit for good in january 1996 cold 62 1 turkey when he was diagnosed with cancer. when he 2 was personally motivated, he could quit with no 3 trouble at all. but he was never committed to 4 quitting before then. he did not want to quit 5 before then. he told his doctor he did not want to 6 cut down. 7 how can a smoker's family come to court and 8 ask for money damages when the smoker told his 9 doctor he did not even want to cut down? 10 mr. gelep knew that smoking was risky. he 11 knew it was bad for his health. he believed it 12 had caused his kidney cancer back in 1969, but he 13 decided to take those risks because he enjoyed 14 smoking. what is important in this case are the 15 circumstances of mr. gelep's life about his 16 smoking. and here's what the evidence showed 17 about that. 18 when mr. gelep applied himself to things that 19 he cared about, he was successful. that was 20 consistent throughout his life. he was a 21 successful man. he was a strong-willed man. you 22 heard his son, paul, say that he was his own man. 23 nobody could tell him what to do or what not to do 24 in any area of his life, not just smoking. and he 25 ran his own business. and obviously you have to 63 1 be an intelligent person -- you have to be smart, 2 savvy to run your own business and be successful 3 at it. and mr. gelep ran a number of businesses. 4 he ran -- the evidence was he ran a deli, a bar, a 5 liquor store. he ran that sundry shop called 6 gelep sundries where he and mrs. gelep sold 7 cigarettes. he invested in and he owned 8 commercial real estate. he owned an insurance 9 company. he was an intelligent man, and he 10 enjoyed smoking. 11 his habit was, you heard, to have a cigarette 12 with a cup of coffee in the morning. sometimes 13 that was at home. sometimes he had his first cup 14 of coffee when he got to work. and sometimes, 15 remember, he went to a number of restaurants and 16 he met his friends there to have a cup of coffee 17 and a cigarette. and he enjoyed smoking when he 18 played golf. and when he decided to quit, he did 19 so instantly, cold turkey, no assistance. he 20 never tried nicotine gum. he never tried a patch. 21 he never went to a stop-smoking clinic. he never 22 tried hypnosis. he never tried medication. he 23 never asked a doctor for help. and he never asked 24 anybody else for help, because he was able to quit 25 easily, with no assistance, cold turkey. 64 this is not somebody who has tried everything 2 in the book over and over and just cannot quit. 3 this is somebody who quit as soon as he decided 4 that he wanted to. 5 mr. gelep was a willing smoker who smoked 6 despite knowing about the health risks. and at 7 some points in his life, he chose to smoke and at 8 other points in his life, he chose to quit. 9 and i want to talk for just a minute about 10 when mr. gelep smoked. remember this navy record 11 in 1945, does not drink or smoke. now, the medical 12 records are inconsistent about how long, what long 13 of a period of time mr. gelep smoked. one record 14 says 10 years, another record says 18 years, 15 another record says 30 years, and then the record 16 that says 45 years. the records are just not 17 consistent, whether it is 10 years or 45 years. 18 but the earliest any record shows mr. gelep 19 smoking was 1951 when he was a 24-year-old adult. 20 however long he actually smoked, we know he was 21 able to quit without outside assistance, cold 22 turkey. and even the plaintiff's own expert, 23 dr. cummings, the one from buffalo, new york, said 24 that. dr. cummings said his definition was -- 25 remember this -- six months of no smoking equals a 65 1 quit -- a successful quit. and under -- this is 2 mr. acosta's -- this is the plaintiff's expert. 3 under the plaintiff's expert's definition, 4 mr. gelep successfully quit on at least two 5 occasions, 1987 when he had the six-month quit and 6 1996 when he quit for nine to ten months. 7 you heard from the witness stand that one 8 aspect of whether a smoker is motivated to quit is 9 whether that person is aware of the health risks 10 of smoking. mr. gelep's family and his doctors 11 encouraged him to quit smoking over the years. 12 did mr. gelep know that smoking was risky for his 13 health? yes. 14 i want to go over briefly what the evidence 15 was about that. mr. gelep was warned decade after 16 decade from his family and from his doctors that 17 he should quit smoking because of health concerns. 18 he knew smoking was bad for his health, but he 19 chose to smoke anyhow. he believed it firsthand 20 from his own cancer in 1969. and you may recall 21 dr. seiden said based on reading mrs. gelep's 22 deposition, he quit at that time because he did not 23 want it to kill him. 24 he owned a bar and a liquor store and a 25 sundry shop where he sold cigarettes. and those 66 1 cigarettes had warnings on the packages. 2 mr. gelep sold cigarettes even though he was aware 3 of the risks of smoking because he thought and 4 believed that smokers should have a choice. 5 in 1974, we heard the testimony about 6 mr. gelep catching his son john smoking. remember 7 that? john was 17 years old, and he said he was 8 coming out the door and his father was coming in 9 the door and he left his smokes there in the 10 garage, and his father caught him. and his father 11 left him a note the next day and kicked him out of 12 the house. that shows -- and he said -- let me 13 add this. and john gelep, on the stand, testified 14 that in that note his father told him that he was 15 kicking him out of the house that one of reasons 16 was because smoking was bad for him. that shows 17 right there mr. gelep knew in 1974 that smoking 18 was bad for his health, and he believed that his 19 son had a choice. and he could have quit smoking 20 if he had wanted to. 21 and mr. gelep's doctors told him to quit. 22 here are four medical records where his doctors 23 told him, discontinue cigarettes, discontinue 24 cigarettes, stop smoking. by not smoking, you 25 could keep it that way. and his son paul told him 67 1 he should quit because of his health over and over 2 again. and mr. gelep was aware of the warning 3 labels that were on the cigarettes that he smoked 4 starting in 1966. 5 we will put those on the screen. warnings were 6 on every single package of cigarettes that 7 mr. gelep smoked from 1966 forward. and he was 8 exposed to that package warning 365 days a year 9 for every year he smoked starting in 1966. the 10 evidence is overwhelming that mr. gelep knew about 11 the health risks of smoking. 12 on those times when mr. gelep quit, he was 13 able to function normally. and that is what he 14 told his doctors. we need to go by what he said, 15 not what somebody says way after the fact. he 16 only gained some weight because he ate more. and 17 he may have been what was described as restless or 18 jittery. those are not clinically significant 19 symptoms, nothing like what you hear about as 20 withdrawal. 21 let us look again at these medical records. 22 these are in mr. gelep's own handwriting. he had 23 quit two weeks before this record. he quit two 24 weeks before, and he said he was not depressed. 25 remember when some of the doctors -- some of the 68 1 experts for the plaintiff came in and said, oh, he 2 suffered from depression because he was -- because 3 of withdrawal. he said he did not. 4 and then the next record from 1988, his wife 5 did not seem to believe that when he was off 6 cigarettes, he was depressed. that is nothing 7 that comes close to what is described as withdrawal 8 by the medical doctors. 9 now, mr. gelep usually smoked, according to 10 the medical records, two or three packs a day. 11 but just because somebody smokes two packs a day 12 or three packs a day does not mean they cannot quit. 13 and we know that. we have proof positive in this 14 case. we have proof positive because mr. gelep 15 did quit. this is not a case of somebody who 16 never quit and could not quit. he did quit. he 17 quit on at least -- at least two occasions. and 18 the last time he quit, he quit for good in 19 january 1996 and never smoked again. 20 last friday we brought to trial dr. george 21 seiden who testified. remember he the one with 22 two doctor degrees. he is a medical doctor. he 23 also has a ph.d., board certified, treats 24 patients. and he said that he only called one 25 smoker addicted because he thought it was 69 1 pejorative term. he did not like to use that word 2 addicted because if you tell somebody they are 3 addicted, that gives them an excuse. they can 4 say, oh, i'm addicted. i cannot quit. and 5 dr. seiden said he did not like to do that. he 6 did not like to use that term addicted when 7 describing a smoker. 8 he studied all the records, all the 9 depositions, all the evidence in the case, and he 10 explained that mr. gelep did not lose control over 11 his smoking. it was his decision to smoke and his 12 complete lack of motivation to stay quit. and 13 that is why he smoked. 14 we know that mr. gelep controlled his 15 smoking. it did not control him. we know he 16 controlled his smoking because he did not smoke in 17 bed. he did not smoke in the bedroom. he did not 18 smoke until he had his first cup of coffee in the 19 morning. he did not smoke at the movies. he 20 did not smoke in church. he sat in the nonsmoking 21 section of restaurants. and he refrained from 22 smoking wherever it was forbidden like at his son 23 paul's house. and he did not complain about it. 24 that is somebody who can control their smoking. 25 this is not somebody who cannot go to the movies 70 1 because they need to smoke or cannot go out and eat 2 at a restaurant unless they were able to smoke a 3 cigarette. that is not mr. gelep. 4 and i said this in my opening and i'm going 5 to say it again. actions speak louder than words. 6 actions speak louder than words. mr. gelep 7 controlled his smoking. and we know that because 8 of what he did, his own actions in his life. 9 the plaintiff cannot prove that mr. gelep was 10 not capable of quitting because he did quit. 11 there was nothing about his smoking that impaired 12 his intelligence. there was nothing about it that 13 caused him to lose his power of reasoning or his 14 ability to quit if he wanted to. mr. gelep just 15 never made the decision to quit smoking for good 16 until january 1996. 17 and there is not a shred of evidence in this 18 case that he had any of these nicotine receptors 19 that you heard about. remember i asked the 20 experts? there is nothing in any radiology to 21 suggest that and we do not have an autopsy here. 22 there is no physical evidence to support that in 23 this case. 24 in the face of all these warnings that he 25 received over the years from his doctors, from his 71 1 family, from the warning labels on the packages, 2 mr. gelep had to make a decision for himself about 3 whether to smoke or not. and he decided to smoke 4 despite knowing that it was bad for him. why did 5 he do that? because for mr. gelep, with full 6 awareness about the health risks of smoking, 7 mr. gelep said -- decided for himself the 8 enjoyment, the pleasure i get out of smoking is 9 worth taking that risk. 10 everybody makes lifestyle choices. and many 11 of those choices are made, just like mr. gelep 12 did, despite known health risks. they are made 13 because of these intangible things that you cannot 14 measure like enjoyment and pleasure. that is why 15 some people decide to have a glass of wine or a 16 beer or being a couch potato and not getting 17 enough exercise or not eating the right foods or 18 smoking. now, we all do not make the same 19 lifestyle choices. that is up to the individual. 20 mr. gelep made that decision for himself to choose 21 to smoke. 22 and during jury selection, remember you-all 23 were seated out there and i was up here and i 24 asked everybody if you believed that individuals 25 should be permitted to make the choice to smoke 72 1 for themselves. and all of you said yes. whether 2 you agree or disagree with the choice mr. gelep 3 made is not the issue. the issue is whether any 4 of us should second guess the choices that 5 mr. gelep made. 6 some people weigh those benefits of pleasure 7 against the health risks and they say it is not 8 worth it. and those people do not smoke or they 9 quit smoking. other people weigh that and they 10 say, it is worth the risk to me. and i'm going to 11 smoke. and i choose to smoke. and that is what 12 mr. gelep did. 13 now, you heard during the trial there have 14 been a lot of labels used to describe smoking, 15 habit, dependence, addiction. and you heard that 16 the term addiction has changed over time. there 17 was one definition in the 1964 surgeon general's 18 report, and then they changed the definition in 19 the 1988 version of the surgeon general's report 20 to something different. but whatever you call it, 21 whatever you label it, it does not mean you cannot 22 quit. it does not mean that mr. gelep could not 23 quit. 24 and let me just talk for a minute about 25 nicotine. you heard from the witness stand 73 1 nicotine occurs naturally in the tobacco plant. 2 and even mr. acosta's -- even the plaintiff's 3 experts agreed nicotine does not cause cancer. 4 nicotine is not a carcinogen. 5 but this case is not about smokers in general 6 and whether nicotine might play a role with 7 respect to some other smokers. this case is about 8 mr. gelep and could mr. gelep have quit. and the 9 answer is, yes, because he did quit. and there is 10 no stronger evidence that you could have. 11 was mr. gelep's death caused by an addiction 12 to cigarettes? is that the legal cause? and 13 that is the question on the verdict form. did 14 mr. gelep smoke because he could not stop or 15 because he did not want to stop? 16 the evidence in the case has been that his 17 death was not caused by an addiction to 18 cigarettes, because he was capable of quitting, 19 because he did quit. and you cannot have stronger 20 evidence than that. he was able to quit when he 21 wanted to cold turkey. he had control. when he 22 wanted to stop, he stopped. when he wanted to 23 start and start smoking, he started. and he chose 24 not to quit for good until january of 1996. he 25 was aware of the risks. and for him, the benefits excerpt - closing statements 3-24-09 74 1 of smoking outweighed the risks. he was willing 2 to take those risks. 3 now, you have been listening to evidence for 4 two weeks now -- just about two weeks, two weeks 5 tomorrow. so you ought to have a good idea about 6 mr. gelep now and the kind of man he was and the 7 kind of smoker he was. there is no basis here to 8 conclude that addiction substantially contributed 9 to mr. gelep's cancer and that but for any alleged 10 addiction, he would not have gotten cancer. as 11 dr. seiden who testified on friday put it, there 12 was no clinically significant impairment. 13 nicotine does not control a person's choice. and 14 that was true for mr. gelep. 15 mr. gelep's death was not caused by an 16 addiction to cigarettes. mr. gelep made a series 17 of choices in his life, just like we all make 18 choices where we all take risks that might affect 19 our health. mr. gelep was in control of those 20 choices, and he chose to smoke. 21 that brings us to the verdict form. and the 22 verdict form, as we have shown you, has one question 23 on it. you are going to have this back in the jury 24 room. and it asks, was alexander gelep addicted 25 to cigarettes that contained nicotine; and, if so, 75 was such addiction a legal cause of a primary lung 2 cancer and his death? 3 the evidence that you have heard in this case 4 proves that the answer to that should be no, 5 because the plaintiff has not met their burden of 6 proof. when you are going back and you are 7 deliberating and you are evaluating the case, i'm 8 going to ask you to remember and focus on three 9 key facts. 10 he did not have primary lung cancer. he did 11 not have cancer that originated in his lung. he 12 had multiple related cancers all in the abdominal 13 area that spread to his lung, but that is not 14 primary lung cancer. and smoking was not the 15 cause of those multiple cancers in his abdomen. 16 that was genetics. 17 number two, mr. gelep was able to quit. we 18 know he was capable of quitting because did he 19 quit. when he was motivated to quit, he quit cold 20 turkey, no assistance, no trouble at all. 21 and number three, before 1996, in his own 22 words to his doctor, he did not want to cut down. 23 and dr. hansen confirmed that on the witness 24 stand. 25 now, i've tried with my time this afternoon 76 1 to go over everything that mr. acosta mentioned in 2 his closing argument. but if i have omitted 3 something, if i've forgotten something, do not let 4 the fact that i have not mentioned it make you 5 think that we are in agreement. 6 mr. acosta's going to have another 7 opportunity to talk to you after mr. geraghty for 8 philip morris finishes. that is because the 9 plaintiff has the burden of proof, as 10 judge rondolino has told you. and i think you have 11 seen from this trial you need to hear both sides 12 of the situation. you need to hear both sides of 13 the story, so to speak. 14 so if mr. acosta raises something new in his 15 rebuttal, knowing that i cannot respond to it, i'm 16 going to ask you to consider two questions. one 17 is, why did not he mention it already so i could 18 address it? and second, knowing the evidence 19 you have heard in the case, how would we have 20 responded if i had had an opportunity to? 21 when you listen to mr. acosta's rebuttal, 22 listen carefully and see if you hear answers to 23 any of these questions. how can the plaintiff 24 prove her case when they did not have an autopsy? 25 how can the plaintiff prove her case when they 77 1 did not have all the pathology tissue? how could 2 the plaintiff proof her case when mr. gelep 3 refused some of these medical tests and he did not 4 have others? how could the plaintiff prove her 5 case when it is undisputed that mr. gelep had 6 multiple cancers located in his body? how can the 7 plaintiff prove her case when they did not even 8 call a pathologist to testify? how could the 9 plaintiff prove that mr. gelep could not quit when 10 we all know did he quit at least twice, six months 11 in 1997 and nine or ten months in 1996? how can 12 the plaintiff prove her case when all the evidence 13 is he enjoyed smoking and he smoked because he 14 chose to do that? how could the plaintiff prove 15 that addiction was a legal cause when you heard 16 from mr. gelep himself in the medical records that 17 he did not want to cut down on his smoking? 18 that is what he told his doctor. and how could the 19 plaintiff prove that addiction prevented him from 20 quitting when he never ever had trouble quitting? 21 when he made up his mind to quit, he quit 22 successfully, cold turkey, no assistance, no 23 trouble. 24 now, none of us likes to consider or have to 25 consider the truthfulness of anybody. i mean, 78 1 it is just against our nature. but as jurors, 2 that is going to be something you are going to have 3 to do. that is your obligation to consider the 4 witnesses. and the court will instruct you -- 5 give you an instruction about the credibility and 6 the believability of the witnesses. and you are 7 going to have to decide for yourselves whether you 8 believe the plaintiff's witnesses when they did 9 not even look at the pathology and at least one of 10 them did not even know that there was pathology out 11 there. 12 i want to thank you again for your service as 13 jurors here. i want to thank you again on behalf 14 of myself and our trial team and also my clients, 15 reynolds. and i want to ask you when you go back 16 in the jury room to keep your focus on mr. gelep. 17 and i also want to ask you to keep something else 18 in mind. i do not know if you can see from where 19 you are seated here, but behind the court on the 20 wall, there is lady justice on the seal. you see? 21 she is blindfolded. and she is blindfolded because 22 when you make up your mind, when you deliberate 23 out there, you should consider the evidence 24 without taking into account sympathy or whether 25 you have any prejudice about any company or anyone 79 1 else. she is blindfolded so that the decision, 2 what is fair and what is just, is based on the 3 evidence and nothing but the evidence in the case. 4 i want to close with just one final thought. 5 if the plaintiff here can avoid these choices that 6 mr. gelep made, then the family of anybody who is 7 used a risky product can also claim that the 8 choice -- that their choices should be 9 disregarded. you, the jury, stand between us and 10 the question that you have to decide as to whether 11 the family of a smoker who had a disease that had 12 nothing to do with smoking, who enjoyed smoking, 13 who controlled his smoking, who understood the 14 risk of smoking all throughout his life, who told 15 his doctor he did not even want to cut down, who 16 quit when he decided to quit with no trouble, who 17 did not preserve the evidence or bring it to court 18 will be able to go forward with their case for 19 money damages. 20 so we are in your hands now. and we want to 21 just respectfully ask that you follow the law and 22 you listen to the evidence. and i want to thank 23 you again very much for your attention this 24 afternoon. 25 your honor, that concludes my closing. 80 1 the court: thank you. 2 mr. geraghty? 3 mr. geraghty: i'm just going to need a 4 couple more minutes to move things around. 5 the court: okay. then we will just wait. 6 anybody need a break or are we good? 7 the bailiff: you can stand up and stretch, 8 if you want. 9 mr. geraghty: may i proceed, your honor? 10 the court: please. 11 mr. geraghty: may it please the court. 12 good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 13 here, again, i'm the last lawyer that is 14 speaking to you, although by my clock it is a 15 little early. i think typically it is been 4:00 16 that i've normally been able to address you. so 17 the fact that it is only 3:30, i'm going to look at 18 as an advantage. 19 i will not be the last lawyer to speak to you, 20 as i think you have heard. because the plaintiff 21 bears the burden of proof, mr. acosta will have 22 one more time to address you. 23 now, i hope i do not disappoint you when i 24 tell you that i cannot promise you that i'll take 25 ten minutes or less. it is been a long trial, and 81 1 the evidence is such that i simply cannot summarize 2 what i believe are the important points in that 3 span of time; but i promise you i will not take any 4 more than about 25 minutes. and i also cannot 5 guarantee it, but i'll try my best not to trip 6 over a cord while i'm up here. 7 now, on behalf of my client, philip morris 8 usa, myself, and i think on behalf of all the 9 lawyers, i just want to thank you for the time 10 that you have spent here with us. it is been over 11 two weeks. you have been extremely attentive. 12 you have been very engaged throughout. and i think 13 i can speak for all the lawyers when i say that we 14 really appreciate your time and your attention 15 over the last two-plus weeks. it is been a long 16 trial. i know you are anxious to retire and go 17 deliberate and then hopefully go home, so i'm 18 going to try to address the important points as 19 quickly as i can. 20 now, this lawsuit is about alexander gelep -- 21 i think you-all know that at this point -- the 22 kind of man he was, the way he lived his life, and 23 his decision to smoke cigarettes. and i want to 24 show you the verdict form. ms. parker has already 25 showed it to you, and mr. acosta showed it to you. 82 1 can you-all see that clearly from where you 2 are? 3 and just so you know the case is about 4 mr. gelep, the verdict form refers specifically to 5 him. the question is "was alexander gelep 6 addicted to cigarettes that contained nicotine 7 and, if so, was such addiction a legal cause of a 8 primary lung cancer and his death?" 9 now, ms. parker has already talked to you 10 about the fact that there are three components to 11 this question, and she addressed specifically the 12 issue of whether or not the plaintiff had 13 primary -- the decedent had primary lung cancer as 14 the plaintiff contends or whether he had primary 15 colon cancer as the defendants contend. i'm not 16 going to address that issue. i'm going to address 17 the two other parts of the question; was mr. gelep 18 addicted to cigarettes that contained nicotine, 19 and if so, was his addiction a legal cause of his 20 death. 21 i talked to you about these three simple 22 truths in my opening statement: one, mr. gelep 23 enjoyed smoking; two, mr. gelep made a personal 24 choice to smoke; three, mr. gelep always had the 25 ability to quit smoking. the evidence you have 83 1 heard over the course of the last week and a half 2 to two weeks supports every single one of these 3 points. and i would submit to you that these 4 three points help you answer the question on that 5 verdict form. 6 i'm going to spend the time i have talking to 7 you about the evidence you heard and the evidence 8 you did not hear from the three fact witnesses. 9 and specifically i'm referring to paul gelep, john 10 gelep, and their sister helen diamandis. i call 11 them fact witnesses because i want, in your mind, 12 to distinguish them from the expert witnesses you 13 heard testify in the case. 14 i'm also going to talk a little bit about 15 some of the medical records you heard ms. parker 16 refer to. these medical records are key in this 17 case. because through his doctors, alexander 18 gelep actually speaks directly to us about how he 19 feels, what he wanted to do, what he did not want 20 to do, and what he intended to do. and these 21 records represent the only testimony we have for 22 mr. gelep himself. 23 alexander gelep enjoyed smoking cigarettes. 24 you do not have to take my word for it; you have seen 25 the evidence over the last two weeks. ms. parker 84 1 showed you a series of photographs, all of which 2 are in evidence, and those photographs demonstrate 3 that mr. gelep enjoyed his life. i would 4 encourage you to look at those photographs. he 5 enjoyed being in the company of his friends and 6 family, and he enjoyed smoking cigarettes. 7 but we have more than just pictures, we have 8 the testimony of mr. gelep's oldest son, paul. 9 what did paul tell you? paul said that his father 10 was the kind of man who, quote, never met a 11 stranger. never met a stranger. he told you his 12 father would spend time socializing with friends 13 and family, enjoying a cup of coffee, and smoking 14 cigarettes. those are three things -- three 15 things that alexander gelep enjoyed to do. 16 in fact, paul told you about the different 17 places on clearwater beach where mr. gelep would 18 go to meet his friends, drink coffee, and 19 socialize. the island house restaurant, young's 20 (phonetic) pit barbecue, and mcdonald's on 21 clearwater beach. during these visits mr. gelep 22 and his friends would talk about the day's events, 23 what was happening in their lives, and he would 24 enjoy a cup of coffee and smoking cigarettes. 25 there is no doubt that mr. gelep was a 85 personable, outgoing, and friendly man who chose 2 to spend time doing the things he enjoyed; and 3 smoking cigarettes was one of those things. 4 mr. gelep made a personal choice to smoke 5 cigarettes. he was an informed smoker. he 6 understood that there were significant health 7 risks associated with cigarette smoking. 8 we know that his wife mary quit smoking in 9 the mid 1960s in response to the 1964 surgeon 10 general's report. for years his son paul preached 11 to him about the dangers of cigarette smoking and 12 urged him to quit. and the evidence is clear that 13 despite being informed of the risks of cigarette 14 smoking, mr. gelep chose to continue smoking. you 15 have not heard any evidence to suggest that 16 mr. gelep did not understand the health risks 17 associated with cigarette smoking. 18 to the contrary, what we have learned about 19 mr. gelep over the last couple of weeks is that he 20 was an intelligent and successful businessman who 21 made a decision to smoke cigarettes. as his son 22 paul said from the witness stand, he said, quote, 23 my father, quote, had his opinions about things, 24 and he had his views. that was paul from the 25 witness stand. 86 1 you heard that both dr. hansen, who testified 2 here, and dr. smitherman told mr. gelep on a 3 number of occasions that he should cut down or 4 quit smoking. 5 ms. parker showed you the medical record from 6 1994 where dr. hansen wrote that mr. gelep told 7 him that he did not want to cut down on smoking. 8 dr. hansen testified here live right before you. 9 mr. acosta himself asked him very pointedly, did 10 alexander gelep tell you that he did not want to 11 stop smoking? and dr. hansen, without batting an 12 eye, told you, yes, he did say that. that comes 13 directly from dr. hansen. 14 alexander gelep always had the ability to 15 quit smoking. he always had the ability within 16 himself to quit smoking when he decided it was 17 time to do so. and how do we know that? because 18 he did. because he did. he quit smoking on 19 several occasions, and you have heard all about that 20 during the course of the evidence. and each time 21 he quit, he did it cold turkey, without any 22 assistance whatsoever. 23 paul gelep told us about several different 24 times that his father quit smoking. you heard 25 that he quit in 1969 when he was first diagnosed 87 1 with kidney cancer. you also heard from paul that 2 in the fall of 1974, he saw his father in 3 gainesville and his father was not smoking at the 4 time. paul was not sure why his father had quit 5 smoking at that point, but what we do know is that 6 alex gelep quit smoking for a period of time and 7 then later that year decided to resume smoking 8 again. 9 alexander gelep quit again in 1987. you have 10 heard about him receiving a letter from his 11 grandson. reading that letter motivated mr. gelep 12 to quit once again in 1987. the evidence shows 13 you that he quit for at least six months and maybe 14 longer. and the evidence you also heard from paul 15 was thereafter, his father told him that he wanted 16 to start smoking again. 17 in january of 1996, two weeks before he 18 learned that he had lung cancer, mr. gelep once 19 again decided to quit smoking, and this time he 20 quit for good. this time he quit for good. 21 according to paul, he never smoked another 22 cigarette again. that is paul's testimony. he 23 quit cold turkey. and you saw the record -- i 24 will not put it up there again, because ms. parker 25 has already showed it to you. but when he went to 88 1 see dr. dunn two weeks after he quit smoking, he 2 did not report a single significant withdrawal 3 symptom -- not a single significant withdrawal 4 symptom. 5 is there any reason why mr. gelep could not 6 have made the decision to quit for good at some 7 earlier point in his life? is there any reason 8 why? the evidence shows that the answer is 9 absolutely not. absolutely not. mr. gelep always 10 had the ability within himself to quit smoking 11 whenever he was motivated to do so, and the proof 12 is that he did. 13 now, you may recall from my opening statement 14 that i told you you would hear evidence that the 15 single most important factor that determines 16 whether somebody's going to be successful of 17 quitting smoking is motivation. motivation. 18 and who did you hear that from? well, you 19 heard it from dr. seiden, for one, but you also 20 heard it from dr. michael cummings, the expert 21 that the plaintiff brought to the courtroom. 22 dr. cummings and dr. seiden both agree that 23 motivation is the single most important factor in 24 determining whether a person can successfully quit 25 smoking. and then after motivation is 89 1 persistence. 2 now, during my opening statement i also 3 talked to you about three questions. three 4 questions. i told you about three questions from 5 the american cancer society. you may recall this 6 is a pamphlet called smart move published by the 7 american cancer society. it is actually written by 8 dr. cummings himself, the same dr. cummings who 9 testified in this case. dr. cummings told you-all 10 that this was one of the most widely distributed 11 stop-smoking pamphlets in the country. 12 and one of the questions that dr. cummings 13 and the american cancer society asks: number one, 14 do you want to stop smoking? number two, are you 15 willing to make some changes in your daily 16 routine? and number three, are you willing to put 17 up with some uneasy moments after stopping? and 18 if you can answer yes to all three of those 19 questions, according to the american cancer 20 society and dr. michael cummings, the plaintiff's 21 own expert, you can quit smoking. you can quit 22 smoking. 23 could mr. gelep have answered these three 24 questions? of course he could. of course he 25 could. and could he have answered them at any 90 1 point in his life that he decided that that was 2 the time to stop smoking? absolutely. 3 now, have you heard any evidence to 4 contradict what i've just told you? have you 5 heard any testimony from paul or john or helen 6 diamandis to dispute these three things? 7 significantly, you did not hear any evidence 8 from any one of mr. gelep's children to dispute 9 that he could have quit smoking whenever he was 10 sufficiently motivated to do so. none of them 11 testified that their father said he was addicted. 12 none of them testified that he said he wanted to 13 quit smoking. none of them testified that he 14 tried and failed to quit, ever. they never said 15 no, our father, he did not enjoy cigarette smoking. 16 you heard no testimony from them to that effect. 17 and after mary gelep -- are not they the ones 18 who knew their father best? and if they truly 19 believed that their father was hopelessly addicted 20 and incapable of quitting smoking, do not you think 21 you would have heard them testify to that fact on 22 the witness stand? you did not hear anything of 23 the sort from them. instead, all you heard them 24 talk about were the specific brands of cigarettes 25 that their father smoked. 91 1 and i want to spend a few minutes talking 2 about this testimony, because it is important. 3 it is important because it goes to the issue of 4 credibility, the believability of the witnesses. 5 and i will not put it back up there, but you saw the 6 instruction that ms. parker showed on the screen. 7 that is an instruction you are going to receive from 8 judge rondolino. and you will be the judges of 9 the believability of the witnesses in the case. 10 you may recall that i told you in my opening 11 statement that members of the gelep family were 12 going to come in here and change their testimony 13 about when their father smoked marlboro light 14 cigarettes. and you saw it happen right here in 15 this courtroom. 16 why this sudden change in their testimony? 17 well, perhaps it was because paul gelep knew that 18 his mother had provided sworn answers under oath 19 that his father only smoked marlboro lights from 20 1990 to 1996, and he was concerned that they would 21 be unable to prove their case against philip 22 morris. 23 so let me remind you of the evidence that you 24 heard. and as you listen, consider whether you 25 can believe the changed testimony you have heard 92 1 from john and paul gelep. 2 you heard from the witness stand, john and 3 paul testify about a matter that contradicted mary 4 gelep's sworn interrogatories. in those sworn 5 answers she said that her husband smoked marlboro 6 lights from 1990 to 1996. paul prepared those 7 answers originally back in 1999, and then mary 8 swore to them under oath in 2001. paul testified 9 that before he prepared those answers, he checked 10 with his mother, he checked with his brother john, 11 and he checked with his three sisters, including 12 helen diamandis. paul testified he would never 13 have had his mother sign that answer under oath, 14 back when their memories were fresh, if he did not 15 believe the answer she gave was honest, truthful, 16 and accurate. 17 paul confirmed the accuracy of those answers 18 as recently as december 2008 when he gave a 19 deposition in this case. that is just three months 20 ago. then in this courtroom they told you a 21 different story. 22 they told you that they believed their father 23 started smoking marlboro lights in the 1970s. 24 they told this new story based upon two 25 photographs that they claim show their father with 93 1 packs of marlboro light cigarettes. these two 2 photos have been admitted into evidence. they are 3 plaintiff's exhibit 662 -- i believe this one is 4 m, and this is 662-k. these are those two 5 photographs. 6 john flatly admitted that the photograph of 7 he and his father and his girlfriend from 8 las vegas does not depict a pack of marlboro 9 lights. he flatly admitted that. paul, on the 10 other hand, said he thought this particular photo 11 that shows a new year's day cake, 1980, he thought 12 this showed a pack of marlboro cigarettes. paul 13 said he and his brothers blew up these photographs 14 on march the 8th, 2009, the day before this trial 15 started. 16 now, paul did not bring the blown-up versions 17 of the photographs, but we have them now. they have 18 been introduced into evidence as defendant's 19 exhibit g, h, and i. and i encourage you to take 20 a look at them. 21 and what you will see when you look at the 22 back, is that on the very -- on the back of the 23 photograph, it indicates that these photographs 24 were created at a ritz camera on march the 8th, 25 2009 by paul gelep and his brother john and his 94 1 sisters. 2 what else did paul and john not show you? 3 well, they did not show you a photograph taken of 4 their father at about the same time on a boat. we 5 introduced that photograph into evidence. i 6 believe it is defendant's exhibit a. the 7 photograph is on your left-hand side. 8 this is the photograph we admitted into 9 evidence, and we showed the photograph to both 10 paul and john. and on the right-hand side is a 11 photograph -- a picture of true cigarettes. john 12 and paul both admitted that the pack of cigarettes 13 in their father's left breast pocket has a 14 circular blue emblem that looks an awful like -- 15 an awful lot like a pack of true cigarettes. true 16 cigarettes were not manufactured by either philip 17 morris or the r.j. reynolds tobacco company. 18 we have introduced some other photographs that 19 show mr. gelep with packages of cigarettes in a 20 left breast pocket that look like true cigarettes. 21 this photo was taken in 1979 or 1980, about the 22 same time that paul and john told you about the 23 two other photographs. 24 finally, i want to remind you that john 25 testified under oath twice before this photo excerpt - closing statements 3-24-09 95 1 jogged his memory -- excuse me, before this photo 2 jogged his memory, john gelep testified twice that 3 his father was smoking true cigarettes in 1979 or 4 1980. take a look at the two photographs; the 5 only two photos that john and paul brought to 6 support their changed testimony. paul told you 7 that they had hundreds and hundreds of photographs 8 of their father. and of those hundreds and 9 hundreds of photographs, these are the two 10 photographs they brought you to support their 11 changed testimony. you decide -- take a look at 12 these photographs when you go back and deliberate, 13 and you decide whether these photographs show a 14 package of gold and white marlboro lights. 15 so why do we have the sudden change in 16 testimony on the eve of trial? i would submit 17 again that it is because paul gelep was concerned 18 that there was insufficient evidence that his 19 father smoked marlboro lights long enough to be 20 the cause of his father's death; that 1990 to 1996 21 was too little too late. did john and paul 22 testify truthfully from that stand? well, that is 23 for you to decide. you are the judge of the facts 24 in the case, and you can accept or reject the 25 testimony as you deem appropriate. 96 now, frankly, i'll tell you now, there is no 2 question on the verdict form in this phase of the 3 case that asks you to decide what brands of 4 cigarettes mr. gelep smoked. this will only be 5 relevant in phase two of the case, if you even get 6 that far. i do not think you will based upon what 7 has happened in this phase. 8 but this changed testimony is important, 9 again, because it goes to the issue of 10 credibility. remember that the experts brought by 11 the plaintiffs relied upon the deposition 12 testimony of paul and john gelep. 13 and also remember dr. groff, the very first 14 witness you heard for the plaintiff who said that 15 mr. gelep was addicted, who did he rely upon? he 16 told you that he interviewed paul and john gelep. 17 that was the basis for his opinion that mr. gelep 18 was addicted. 19 now, mr. acosta spent a lot of time talking 20 about dr. farone and all the things that he had to 21 say. that has nothing to do with mr. gelep and 22 the question you are being asked to decide today. 23 it is simply a distraction. but i need to address 24 it, so let me just say a few things about that. 25 dr. farone testified that while he was at 97 1 philip morris, he and his coworkers did important 2 research that benefited the customers of philip 3 morris. he also told you that the work he did, in 4 his view, served the public's interest. he 5 testified that he spent eighty percent of his time -- 6 eighty percent of his time trying to make safer 7 cigarettes while at philip morris. he said he was 8 proud of the work he did. proud of that work. 9 did he want to leave philip morris? no. he 10 testified that he was hoping to become vice 11 president of research and development. that is the 12 position he was hoping to get. 13 but then dr. farone was fired; you heard him 14 testify about that. he was fired because he 15 complained to his coworkers and he threatened to 16 sue the company. he became angry and bitter 17 because he and his wife did not get promotions 18 that he believed they deserved. and now you hear 19 him tell a story that is completely at odds with 20 his statement that he expected to spend his entire 21 career at philip morris running its research and 22 development department. 23 he talked about ammonia. but what he did not 24 tell you is that philip morris obtained a patent 25 from the united states government in 1967 based on 98 1 its use of ammonia in cigarettes. this was no 2 secret. the government knew about it. the patent 3 is in evidence. you can take a look at it. and 4 as dr. farone told you, the government never told 5 philip morris or any other tobacco company that 6 they needed to take ammonia or any other 7 ingredient out of their cigarettes. 8 where is the document from dr. farone where 9 when he was employed at philip morris he said that 10 ammonia or urea or acid aldehyde made cigarettes 11 more addictive like he testified on that 12 videotape? where is that document where he 13 expressed any concern while he was an employee at 14 philip morris as to any of those issues? 15 mr. acosta did not show you such a document. i 16 submit to you he is not going to be able to show 17 you such a document. so despite the sensational 18 allegations you heard from dr. farone on that 19 videotape, dr. farone did not say any of those 20 things while he was an employee at philip morris. 21 and at the end of the day, recall what 22 dr. farone admitted during his cross-examination. 23 he admitted that despite everything he said on 24 that videotape, he said, quote, i'm not trying to 25 say whether or not one person is more addicted 99 1 than another. he told you he could not say that. 2 he was also asked a very pointed question 3 about all the ingredients that you heard 4 dr. acosta talk about. he was asked, and you 5 cannot tell that if there was some substance that 6 increased the rate of absorption by a matter of 7 only milliseconds, that that would make any 8 difference whatsoever in the level of a person's 9 addiction. right? and dr. farone said that is 10 correct. he admitted that was true. 11 more importantly, what does this have to do 12 with the issues in this case? what does this have 13 to do with mr. gelep? absolutely nothing. 14 absolutely nothing. 15 paul said that mr. gelep was a sports fan. 16 well, there is a saying in sports: keep your eye 17 on the ball. keep your eye on the ball. do not be 18 distracted. do not be distracted by things that 19 are not relevant to the case. so let us look at 20 the evidence that relates specifically to 21 mr. gelep; the evidence that shows that he quit 22 smoking for good in 1996 when he was motivated to 23 do so, when he decided it was time to quit. 24 i want to show you the verdict form again, 25 and then an instruction so you understand how the 100 1 two go together. this one may be hard to read, so 2 let me know if anyone cannot -- do i need to move 3 this one closer? no? okay. 4 let us talk again about the question you are 5 going to be asked to answer in this phase of the 6 case. 7 this is the verdict form. again, ms. parker 8 has addressed one aspect of it, and that is the 9 medical causation issue. but i want to talk to 10 you about the second -- the two other parts of the 11 question, whether mr. gelep was addicted to 12 cigarettes that contained nicotine, and if so, was 13 such addiction a legal cause of a primary lung 14 cancer and his death. 15 you are going to have to determine this 16 question based on the legal cause instruction that 17 the court gives you. let me read it to you. 18 "addiction to cigarettes is a legal cause of 19 an injury and death if it directly and in natural 20 and continuous sequence produces or contributes 21 substantially to producing such injury and death 22 so that it can be reasonably said that" -- and 23 this is the key phrase here -- "but for the 24 addiction to cigarettes, the injury and death 25 would not have occurred." 101 1 "but for" -- those are the key words. the 2 instruction continues: 3 "in order to be regarded as a legal cause of 4 injury and death, addiction to cigarettes need not 5 be the only cause. addiction to cigarettes may be 6 a legal cause of injury and death even though it 7 operates in combination with the act of another, 8 some natural cause or some other cause if such 9 other cause occurs at the same time as the 10 addiction to cigarettes and if the addiction to 11 cigarettes contributes substantially to producing 12 such injury and death." 13 that is a lot of words. but, again, the words 14 "contribute substantially" are in the second 15 paragraph, and they are all the way up here. and 16 the way it is defined, contributes 17 substantially -- "contributes substantially" is 18 defined "so that it can be reasonably said that 19 but for the addiction to cigarettes the injury and 20 death would not have occurred." that is the 21 standard you have to apply. 22 in order to satisfy this burden, the 23 plaintiff must establish that mr. gelep's claimed 24 addiction was an essential reason why he smoked -- 25 essential so substantial of reason that if he 102 1 had not been addicted, he would have quit in time 2 to avoid the injury, the injury that the plaintiff 3 occurs to place in this case. so substantial that 4 mr. gelep lost his free will and could not stop 5 smoking. is that mr. gelep? does that sound like 6 the mr. gelep you heard about in this case over 7 the course of the last week or two? 8 i would submit to you again that the answer 9 to that question comes from the very first board i 10 showed you. the simple truth -- i believe they 11 provided you with the answer to the question on 12 the verdict form. mr. gelep enjoyed smoking, 13 mr. gelep made a personal choice to smoke, and 14 mr. gelep always had the ability to quit smoking. 15 and ultimately he did quit, when he was motivated 16 to do so. and when he quit, he did so cold turkey 17 without any assistance whatsoever. the ability to 18 quit was always within mr. gelep himself. the 19 motivation, the persistence were always there. 20 if you believe that the evidence supports 21 these three points, then addiction could not have 22 been the legal cause of mr. gelep's death, and you 23 should check no on that verdict form. 24 if you believe these three simple truths, 25 then the plaintiff has failed to prove by the 103 1 greater weight of the evidence that mr. gelep's 2 claimed addiction was the but for cause of his 3 disease. 4 the court will define the greater weight of 5 the evidence as being "the more persuasive and 6 convincing force and effect of the entire 7 evidence -- the entire evidence you have heard over 8 the course of this trial." ask yourself, could 9 mr. gelep have quit smoking, whether or not he was 10 addicted, whenever he decided to set his mind to 11 do so? based on the entire evidence that you have 12 heard, i submit to you that there is no doubt that 13 when he was motivated to do so, when he decided he 14 wanted to do so, mr. gelep could have quit smoking 15 at any point -- at any point in time. and we know 16 that to be true because he did, in fact, quit 17 several times, and he ultimately quit for good in 18 1996. and, therefore, his claimed addiction is 19 not the but for cause of his death in this case. 20 why not? because alexander gelep always had it 21 within himself to quit smoking. 22 so for all the reasons ms. parker discussed 23 and all the reasons i've now explained to you, i 24 would ask that you answer the question on the 25 verdict form "no" and end this case now. answer 104 1 that question "no" and return a verdict in favor 2 of philip morris and r.j. reynolds, the only 3 verdict that i would submit to you is consistent 4 with the entire force and effect of the evidence 5 you have heard in this case. 6 i want to thank you very much for your time 7 and attention.
