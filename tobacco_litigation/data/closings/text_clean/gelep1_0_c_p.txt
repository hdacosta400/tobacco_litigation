3 mr. acosta: yes, i do, your honor. thank 4 you very much. 5 good afternoon. and i want to thank you, 6 first of all, for your service here and your 7 patience with us for this lengthy phase one. 8 phase two is going to depend on how you 9 answer the question that is before you to be 10 answered in phase one. and phase two would be 11 very short. i cannot tell you exactly how long it 12 would be, but i think it would be really short -- 13 very short, because a lot of the evidence that you 14 heard is evidence that may not actually apply to 15 the question that you have got to answer here in 16 phase one. and it would carry over, and then you 17 would consider that in phase two. for example, 18 the brand of smoke -- the brands that were smoked 19 is not relevant to the question you have to 20 answer. 21 and this is the question that you have to 22 answer in this phase of the trial. this is the 23 verdict. and the question is, "was alexander 24 gelep addicted to cigarettes that contained 25 nicotine and, if so, was such addiction a legal 5 1 cause of the primary lung cancer and his death?" 2 yes or no? 3 so that is what this first phase has actually 4 been about, is to have you answer that question. 5 and i'll show it to you one more time before i sit 6 down. 7 you will remember back in the opening, i said 8 that there were a number of things that we hoped 9 the evidence would show. you know, when you make 10 an opening and you tell juries what you think the 11 evidence things will show -- as the judge told 12 you, what we said then was not the evidence. what 13 was the evidence is what you actually saw, and 14 it is -- it is not always exactly the same. we 15 cannot predict with one hundred percent accuracy exactly 16 what is going to come into evidence and what is not 17 going to come into evidence and so forth. 18 so -- but there were a lot of things that we 19 did show you in the opening that we showed you in 20 evidence during this part of the trial. 21 one of them was how much mr. gelep smoked. 22 and if you recall, i had this board up previously. 23 and he smoked up to 60 cigarettes a day. that is a 24 tremendous amount of smoking by any measure. one 25 of the records said that he smoked three packs a 6 1 day for 45 years. and you probably remember 2 there is a lot of discrepancies, but by anybody's 3 measure, mr. gelep was a heavy cigarette smoker. 4 in fact, a couple of the records which are going 5 to be going back with you into the jury room -- 6 this big binder is filled with his records, and 7 they document his smoking history together with 8 this board here. 9 and these are photos that were introduced 10 into evidence. they are in this envelope that will 11 go back with you. and you can see what we did is 12 we put the dates on those that mr. gelep dated or 13 on those where the date was on the back of the 14 photograph. and, you know, here he is goofing 15 around. 16 what we tried to do is to put these in an 17 order from youngest to oldest. and you can -- in 18 every single one of these pictures, he is either 19 holding a cigarette or has a pack of cigarettes or 20 smoking a cigarette. i think one of them might 21 show that he had an ashtray sitting next to him, 22 this one right here with his daughter. 23 and you can see that -- you can see him grow 24 older. you know, every few years, there is a 25 picture of him smoking a cigarette or with a 7 1 cigarette from the earliest to the latest. 2 this was a man that needed to have a 3 cigarette with him basically all the time. 60 4 cigarettes a day is a cigarette every 10 or 5 15 minutes. so he was always with a cigarette. 6 and this chronicles, you know, the years. so you 7 can see it was pretty much continuous smoking back 8 from the time he had his first cigarette in his 9 mouth. and if you look closely, you can see this 10 one is lit. i think mr. gelep testified he did not 11 see that, but if you look closely, you can see 12 there is about a half, a quarter-inch of ash on 13 that one. 14 we must prove our case by the greater weight 15 of the evidence. and you will be getting a short 16 instruction on that. and, you know, lawyers, 17 they -- oftentimes they stand up and they -- they 18 weigh the scales and they say, you know, just a 19 grain of sand is enough to tip the scales. well, 20 that is true. all we have to do is win by the 21 greater weight, which does not have to be a big 22 weight. it can be a very small weight. but 23 you are the ones who decide what that is. so it is 24 not beyond a reasonable doubt. that is what you do 25 in a criminal case where somebody goes to jail. 8 1 this is different. this is different. if we win 2 by 51 to 49, we win. 3 so when you are looking at this evidence, 4 perhaps you should be thinking in terms of, well, 5 what is more probable? is the evidence that was 6 presented by the plaintiff in the case more 7 probably true or not? if you do not think it is 8 probable that mr. gelep was addicted to smoking as 9 much as he did, if you do not think that is 10 probable, then we would lose. if you think it is 11 probable that he had an addiction to nicotine, 12 which we think the evidence is pretty much 13 overwhelming that he was -- and i'll explain that 14 a little bit further in a minute, that he had an 15 addiction to nicotine and that it was a cause -- 16 if you remember on this verdict form -- i guess i 17 did not point this out, but it is a cause -- a legal 18 cause of his primary cancer and death. 19 so i'm going to talk a little bit about his 20 addiction, i'm going to talk a little bit about 21 his lung cancer, and then i'm going to talk a 22 little bit about how the two fit together. 23 one of the things that we did when we started 24 out in our opening is we put up this board here. 25 and this board, you know, is to show the different 9 1 reasons why people smoke. and dr. groff talked 2 about that. and i think dr. cummings -- you might 3 remember him -- he talked about some of these 4 things, too. the one thing that exists, underlies 5 all these other things is addiction. that is the 6 thing that drives smoking. 7 the defendants in the case have come out and, 8 as i mentioned in the opening, they deny 9 everything. they deny addiction. they deny it 10 was lung cancer. they deny the addiction was one 11 of the causes of the lung cancer. and, you know, 12 in their world, the seller goes free and the 13 person that uses the drug gets addicted and dies, 14 pays the price. and that is the way these 15 defendants have done business. they -- 16 ms. parker: objection, your honor. 17 the court: do you need to approach the 18 bench? 19 (the following proceedings took place at 20 sidebar:) 21 mr. geraghty: your honor, i do not see how 22 the way the defendants approach business is 23 relevant to the question that we are talking about 24 here. if he wants to talk about mr. gelep's 25 addiction or addiction in general, that is one 10 1 thing. but i think this is out of balance given 2 the issue in the case. 3 mr. acosta: there was certainly evidence of 4 it through dr. farone as to how they approach 5 business and what they do and how they do it, and 6 i think it is relevant. it goes to the choice 7 issue. 8 and, you know, i'm just arguing from the 9 evidence that is in the record. i do not see 10 anything wrong with that, judge. there certainly 11 was not anything wrong with that question. 12 ms. parker: company conduct should not be an 13 issue in phase one. we object under that basis. 14 the court: well, it is involved in phase one 15 to the extent that the company knows and admits 16 and is involved in the use of an addictive 17 substance in their product. so to the limited 18 extent that he touches on it in that way, it 19 does not appear to be fault-based argument. so 20 i'll permit a very limited discussion. 21 ms. parker: and we can respond in our 22 closing? 23 the court: okay. 24 (sidebar conference concluded.) 25 the court: all right. thank you, counsel. excerpt - closing statements 3-24-09 11 1 mr. acosta: may i proceed, your honor? 2 the court: yes. 3 mr. acosta: so these cigarette company 4 defendants, they are the seller. they are the 5 seller and mr. gelep was the buyer. and they did 6 things to their product. they did things to 7 cigarettes on purpose, deliberate. it was not an 8 accident. it is not just a natural product, you 9 know, some leaf that contains nicotine, there is a 10 lot more to it. and we showed that through 11 dr. farone and through some of the documents that 12 i've got. 13 but the proof of addiction not only comes 14 from some common sense because of the amount of 15 cigarettes that he smoked and what he tried to do 16 to stop, but you heard dr. groff. he was our 17 first witness. he was the man with the white 18 hair. he was the psychiatrist who met with the 19 family and interviewed them, reviewed materials, 20 and came to the conclusion that mr. gelep was 21 addicted. 22 dr. goldman, who is the chairman of the 23 department of internal medicine at the usf medical 24 school, who has treated thousands of smokers, you 25 know, has been in the tampa bay area since the 12 early 1970s, works at the va hospital where there 2 have been thousands of smokers on ailments, knows 3 that mr. gelep was addicted to nicotine and 4 cigarettes. he reviewed all the medical records. 5 he knows what smokers goes through. he knows how 6 hard it is to get smokers to refrain from 7 continuing to smoke. 8 then we had dr. cummings who came down from 9 the roswell park cancer institute up in buffalo 10 who runs clinics -- tobacco control clinics. he is 11 a public health doctor, a ph.d., who said that 12 mr. gelep was highly addicted. 13 these are people that deal with this issue 14 every day. dr. groff does not do it anymore 15 because he is retired now, but dr. goldman and 16 dr. cummings deal with it every single day. so 17 they felt that he was addicted. and even 18 dr. hansen, who was his family treating 19 physician -- he came in. you might remember him. 20 he was kind of quiet. he also felt that mr. gelep 21 was addicted. 22 and, you know, you might remember that 23 mr. gelep, toward the end of his smoking, told 24 dr. hansen that, you know, he did not want to cut 25 back. he had -- he had cut back and actually quit 13 1 a few years earlier in 1987 and then had gained 2 weight and then started smoking again. that is in 3 the medical records that you were shown. 4 and then he -- he was smoking some. there is 5 a record that says, i guess, in 1992 that he was 6 smoking some. but then by 1994, he is up to two 7 and a half packs a day. this is a resigned 8 smoker, somebody that had smoked and smoked and 9 tried and tried and was unable to stop. 10 you might remember that, you know, there were 11 questions asked about some of the witnesses from 12 this book, the dsm-iv. there were questions asked 13 from the 1988 surgeon general's report, which for 14 some reason is not in there, but that -- those 15 reports -- the surgeon general's report was all 16 about addiction. and the witness that the defense 17 put on was asked some questions about addiction 18 and how it influences the choices that smokers 19 make. it impairs their choice. you know, that is 20 what an addiction is. 21 the -- you know, the statistics about 22 addicted smokers are pretty incredible. we are 23 talking about 15 million people every year that 24 try to stop, and only 3 to 5 percent are 25 successful in that year to stay off cigarettes for 14 1 a year. that is a pretty -- pretty rough 2 statistic. and you might remember in this book, 3 the dsm-iv, you know, indicated that 45 percent 4 were able to quit, implying that 55 percent are 5 unable to quit -- 55 percent are unable to quit. 6 i think you saw this record briefly on the 7 screen. it is an r.j. reynolds record dated 1982. 8 and in this particular record, it indicates that 9 most of the people that smoke would like to stop. 10 you know, most of those who have for any 11 significant time smoked would like to stop. 12 that is what it says right here. but many -- but 13 not most of those who would like to stop smoking 14 are able to do so. so r.j. reynolds recognized 15 that most smokers were unable to stop. 16 there are other records that you will get to 17 take back with you. here's one in 1959 from 18 philip morris. it is called "psychological 19 research." even back then, the number three 20 reason that they thought people smoked was 21 addiction. 22 you were shown this record from philip morris 23 in 1990. and, again, this is going back with you. 24 this is one of those that says, all forms of 25 nicotine are not behaviorally or psychologically 15 1 equal. 2 remember we talked about free basing the 3 nicotine and what the cigarette companies do to do 4 that? well, we have another record in here which 5 you could look at. it is an r.j. reynolds record. 6 and this supports exactly what dr. farone told 7 you. as the ph goes up, as they change the ph, 8 you get more free-based nicotine. see, they do not 9 do that for nothing. 10 here's another reynolds record. the title of 11 it, "the nature of the tobacco business and the 12 crucial role of nicotine." here's one that 13 dr. farone discussed, "motives and incentives in 14 cigarette smoking." 15 you can look through these back in the jury 16 room. they are just something that you can look at 17 to verify what -- verify this other evidence that 18 you have been told. you know, this is basically 19 like -- it is worse than that. it is worse than 20 this. it is worse than the fraternity guy that 21 spikes the punch bowl with grain. you know, it is 22 worse than that. this is killing people, and it 23 killed mr. gelep. 24 ms. parker: objection, your honor. 25 mr. geraghty: objection, your honor. 16 1 ms. parker: same objection. 2 the court: same ruling. 3 mr. acosta: dr. farone talked to you about 4 some of the things that the cigarette companies do 5 to make cigarettes more addictive. they put 6 ammonia in them. they put acid aldehyde in them, 7 a chemical. they put the chemical urea in 8 cigarettes. they put licorice in them. they put 9 cocoa shells in them. they all have a purpose, 10 and that purpose is to addict the smoker. 11 these are choices. we talked about choices. 12 and the defense is, well, mr. gelep had a choice, 13 had a choice to, you know, stop smoking whenever 14 he wanted to. you know, he was finally able to do 15 it when he was sick with a -- what he thought was 16 an upper respiratory infection, it turned out to 17 be a big tumor in his lung. and he was very sick. 18 and then he goes on chemo, he is losing weight. 19 he -- if you look at those records, you will see he 20 lost about 40 pounds from somewhere around 168 21 down to somewhere around 130. 22 eventually he had to go on oxygen. you will 23 see in there that sometime in late spring, early 24 summer he is on oxygen. he had radiation. he had 25 chemo. he was sick. he was sick. 17 1 so we do have some records that suggest that, 2 you know, maybe -- maybe he did not quit in '95 or 3 early '96. the family does not remember him 4 smoking after that, but there is a couple records 5 that make you wonder whether he was still smoking 6 or not. one near the very end said he quit just 7 recently. now, does that mean nine months ago or 8 does that mean a few weeks ago? that was -- that 9 was dated in october of '96. 10 and there was one where it said he was -- 11 he is a smoker. and it was done in present tense. 12 and i think that was in february. in fact, it may 13 have been the one up at sloan-kettering. 14 we talked about dr. farone a little bit, and 15 so i want to show you some of the things that 16 dr. farone -- i just basically paraphrased these 17 things from the information we have. but 18 dr. farone said: 19 "was one of your understandings at philip 20 morris that the addiction to cigarettes altered 21 the ability of the smoker to make choices about 22 whether to continue smoking or not?" 23 "of course it did." 24 "from your conversations with philip morris 25 executives and scientists, did these executives, 18 1 the vice president, and the president, the ceo, 2 and other scientists from principal scientists on 3 up believe that nicotine was a highly addictive 4 drug back then when you were there?" 5 "certainly." 6 "did they accept the idea that the addiction 7 would cause philip morris to sell more 8 cigarettes?" 9 "yeah. in my opinion they did, yes. that is 10 why they kept it there, otherwise they would take 11 it out a long time ago" -- the nicotine. 12 "are those additives put into cigarettes by 13 the cigarette companies for that purpose, to 14 enhance the addictive nature of smoking?" 15 "in my opinion, yes." 16 "was urea added for that purpose, to 17 free-base the nicotine?" 18 "yeah. they did not need it for any other 19 purpose, so yes." 20 "was it thought at philip morris that 21 addiction was the reason people smoked?" 22 "yes." 23 "and why is that important?" 24 "because it indicates the rationale behind 25 the use of ammonia and other chemicals that raise 19 1 the ph and accelerate the delivery of free-based 2 nicotine." 3 "and does that pertain to the addictive 4 nature of smoking?" 5 "in my opinion, it does." 6 "did you have an understanding as to whether 7 or not the addiction affected the free will of the 8 smoker?" 9 "addiction always affects free will. i mean, 10 yes. an addiction is just what it says. it is 11 something that decreases your ability to stop 12 doing that which you are addicted to." 13 he was the one that was on the video. i 14 probably should have said that first. but that is 15 who those quotes were from, was that fellow who 16 was on the video that we had the technical 17 problems with a week ago monday. 18 now, one thing to consider is that mr. gelep 19 smoked for many years before the warning -- you 20 know, for many years. no matter when you think -- 21 no matter when you think this picture was taken, 22 he smoked for a long time. and so when the 23 warnings came out -- the first one is the caution 24 label, and then the second one is the warning. 25 and his son paul is on him, you know. paul says, 20 1 you know, "look, dad, you have got to quit." and 2 they would confront over it. 3 and finally in 1974, we know -- and i'm not 4 trying to skip over this. we know that he had 5 cancer of the kidney in 1970. the only testimony 6 about that came from mary gelep, who you heard 7 about. and when i confronted the defense witness 8 with the actual language in her deposition, which 9 is what he relied on, it was obvious that she did 10 not remember and was confused and did not know 11 whether he was talking about 1996 or 1970. and 12 she said that. 13 so aside from 1970, in 1974, paul is going to 14 duke. and they are playing the university of 15 florida football team for homecoming, and he comes 16 down and meets his mom and dad up there for the 17 game, and dad's not smoking. i think he said it 18 was a friday night to sunday morning or something 19 like that. but for a full day, his dad was not 20 smoking. they left, paul goes home at christmas, 21 and his dad is smoking again. 22 his brother john, he was the one with the 23 mustache. you might remember he said that his dad 24 told him he could not quit. and that was about 25 that same time frame. 21 1 so somebody tells you they cannot quit, what 2 are they telling you? there is no evidence that he 3 knew it was addictive. he just said, i cannot 4 quit. 5 then we -- you know, we are left with only the 6 recollections of the family. and they were 7 different when they lived at home in the later 8 years at different times. and we do not know if 9 mr. gelep tried to quit, who knows when? there is 10 just no evidence of it because nobody can 11 remember, you know, family history that well. 12 we do know that he certainly was smoking all 13 the time, but we also know that when paul had a 14 baby in 1987, his first son, who he named alex 15 after his dad, he writes a letter. he writes a 16 letter to his dad as if he is his baby. you know, 17 dear dad, you know, i really want to be around you 18 as you -- you know, as i grow older so you can, 19 you know, do things with me and so on and so 20 forth. it was a letter to get his father to try 21 again to quit smoking. 22 and mr. gelep was able to stay off cigarettes 23 for some period of time, maybe up to six months. 24 nobody knows exactly for sure. but we do know 25 that it was long enough for him to gain some 22 weight, and some significant weight, because the 2 medical record the next year indicates that he 3 feels better -- feels better now that he is 4 smoking. so he was not feeling good when he did not 5 smoke. 6 of course, that is one of the symptoms of 7 addiction. you know, smoking in the face of known 8 danger is certainly a symptom of addiction. 9 now, if -- if -- once he tried to stop -- and 10 we know that he knew it was not good for him back 11 in the early '70s because he threw john out of the 12 house because john was smoking. now, is that a 13 person who wants to smoke? you know, as a parent, 14 he is telling his kids do not do it, throws one of 15 them out because he is doing it, yet he does it. 16 you know, how does that make him feel? i mean, 17 this has happened to lots and lots of people, and 18 it happened to him. 19 i've used this example before. you know, 20 everybody talks about motivation. well, if you are 21 a smoker and you have smoked for ten years or so and 22 you think, well, i'm going to stop smoking, well, 23 how much motivation do you need? you do not know. 24 now, what do you need when you are smoke -- now, by 25 1970, if he started even in 1950, let us say, you 23 1 know, you have got 20 years at a pack a day or more. 2 that is a lot of smoking. so how do you know how 3 much motivation you need? if you are -- if you are 4 lighting up a cigarette every 20 or 30 minutes, 5 well, you need motivation for the first one, but 6 then the second time -- the second cigarette time 7 comes around, you need some motivation for that 8 one, too. and you need it for the third one and 9 the fourth one. 10 you need to keep fighting it and keep 11 fighting it until you get through those feelings 12 that you have of not feeling good, of not craving 13 the cigarette. and finally you get to the point 14 where those receptors which were talked about, 15 those receptors in your brain that when you smoke, 16 it grows these receptors -- and you already have 17 some to start out with, but when you smoke, it 18 grows more. and those receptors are craving the 19 nicotine. they have to be satisfied. and when 20 they are satisfied, you feel okay until you need 21 your next cigarette. and then the cycle just 22 keeps repeating and repeating. 23 well, is it like -- for some people, it is 24 like climbing mount everest. some people can do 25 that. there is probably people in this room that 24 1 could climb mount everest if they really wanted 2 to, but most probably could not do that. no matter 3 how much you want to do it, you have to work your 4 way up. you have to be motivated all the way up. 5 well, smoking for some people is like that. and 6 for mr. gelep, he never made it. he was -- he was 7 one of the 55 percent or, under this dsm book, was 8 unable to do it. or under the r.j. reynolds 9 document, he was one of the ones that was unable 10 to do it. 11 now, i want to talk just a second about the 12 defense witness the defense put on to say that he 13 was not addicted. that was dr. seiden just the 14 other day on friday. and dr. seiden came from 15 shreveport, louisiana, down here to tell you to 16 satisfy their denial, to tell that you that 17 mr. gelep was not addicted. 18 now, remember, this is a man who saw 19 thousands of patients and only diagnosed nicotine 20 addiction one time -- one time in his whole 21 career. only one -- he only met one addicted 22 smoker in his whole career. that is crazy. 23 now, i asked him about some of the things the 24 surgeon general said about how nicotine influences 25 the choice of the smoker, and he admitted it did. 25 1 we talked a little bit about personal 2 responsibility, you know, and i hinted at this 3 during the voir dire. i'm going to mention it 4 again. but i wanted first to tell you that, you 5 know, dr. seiden said, you know, there is 6 motivation and there is the behavior of the smoker 7 who seeks to quit; and at the same time, there is 8 the nicotine that is influencing that behavior. he 9 admitted that, you know. so you have this tension 10 there, and that tension is always there. 11 now, i just want to mention this personal 12 responsibility aspect for just a second, because, 13 you know, personal responsibility is connected to 14 something. who -- who are you responsible to? 15 you are responsible to yourself. you are 16 responsible to your family. you are responsible to 17 your community. you are responsible to the 18 united states of america. you may be responsible 19 to god. but should you have the same 20 responsibility toward the company that did the 21 things that these cigarette companies did to put 22 you in the position that you are in? i think that 23 personal responsibility sort of breaks down right 24 there, because they should be responsible, too. 25 they should be accountable for what they did, too. 26 1 ms. parker: your honor, objection. 2 mr. geraghty: join, your honor. 3 the court: sustained. 4 mr. acosta: let me talk about lung cancer 5 for a second. 6 you saw this board that was not in black and 7 color when i showed it to you, but it was black 8 and white. 9 too much weight there. well, this one is 10 just not going to behave for me, so maybe i can 11 get somebody to help me. 12 but you can see that the surgeon general had 13 in the 2004 report -- that was the big book. let 14 me grab this. it was in this big book here, the 15 2004 surgeon general's report. and it is model -- 16 ms. parker: objection, your honor. this was 17 impeachment, not evidence. 18 the court: it is limited to impeachment. 19 mr. acosta: i asked dr. seiden about this. 20 i asked him about this chart. it goes from 21 nicotine addiction, carcinogens, to dna, to 22 mutation and other changes, to lung cancer. 23 so what did the defense do? well, dr. seiden 24 knows about nicotine addiction, right? but he 25 says, well, i do not know about any of that other 27 1 stuff. of course, then they bring in dr. bennett. 2 he talked about lung cancer. he does not talk 3 about addiction. 4 well, this is the whole story right here. 5 now, dr. groff, the psychiatrist, he touched 6 on the lung cancer and how addiction leads to 7 that. 8 dr. goldman, i mentioned to you, the fellow 9 from usf, talked about smoking being a cause of 10 primary lung cancer. and that is what you are being 11 asked in this question -- that this was a solitary 12 nodule up in the upper right lobe of the lung. it 13 had gone in and made at least one lymph node one 14 centimeter in size, which is right at the dividing 15 line of abnormal. 16 we talked about how if cancer came from some 17 other place you would see multiple metastasis in 18 the lung. you would not see just one primary site 19 like that. and i think that dr. bennett 20 recognized that toward the end of the questions i 21 was asking him that it is very rare for a tumor to 22 come from some other place and just present as one 23 big nodule. it does not happen. it is very rare. 24 what is the probable thing? mr. gelep smoked 25 a lot. cigarettes contain carcinogens. it is a 28 1 dose response disease, which means the more you 2 smoke, the higher your risk. right? and by the 3 way, he had already smoked enough and a lot by 4 1970. that was a sufficient amount right there to 5 cause his lung cancer already. 6 he gets a big tumor that is found in his lung. 7 he goes to the doctor. they have chest x-rays, 8 ct scan. they do the broncho- -- bronchoscope, 9 putting that tube down his nose and into his lung 10 and looking around. you know, we know the lung is 11 a target organ for these carcinogens. 12 so what is the most probable thing? it is 13 probable that he has a primary lung cancer. all 14 the doctors that saw him, according to 15 dr. bennett, were wrong. he took little -- little 16 pieces of little statements in there and then 17 construed them a different way and showed you what 18 he thought was a different picture. 19 you know, you have got to remember, he said 20 he is a forensic doctor. well, that is a lawsuit 21 doctor. he is testified a thousand times before 22 1994. and then he said that he is testified about 23 500 times -- i think he said three times a month 24 times, what, 15 years? that is another 500 -- it is 25 1,500 times he is testified. 29 1 the doctors that saw mr. gelep were convinced 2 of lung cancer. dr. dunn, who you saw, was a 3 treating doctor. he is a treating doctor. he 4 treats patients every day, you know. he came down 5 and he told you that he looked and had that little 6 brush and pushed the scope in as far as it would 7 go and got to the point where he could not look any 8 further. he says that the bronchus was thickened 9 and that he found cancer cells inside. and he was 10 convinced that it was a bronchiogenic carcinoma. 11 well, even dr. bennett admitted "broncho" 12 means airway and "genic" means that is where it 13 starts. it is bronchogenic. it started in his 14 airway. it is a primary lung cancer. 15 mr. gelep wanted to live. they went up to 16 sloan-kettering in new york, one of 15 cancer -- 17 nci, national cancer institute, certified cancer 18 treatment centers in the country to get a second 19 opinion. he takes his stuff up there with him. 20 the pathologist up there in new york looks at 21 the same slides. what does he say? morphology is 22 bronchiogenic carcinoma of the lung. morphology 23 means, looks to me by just looking at the slide -- 24 just looking at these cells tells me that this is 25 cancer of the lung. that is a primary cancer of 30 1 the lung. dr. goldman said that it was a primary 2 cancer of the lung as well. that is what this man 3 had, was a primary cancer of the lung. 4 so think of it this way. in this case, based 5 on all this evidence and all this stuff in the 6 medical records, which is the more probable? is 7 it more probable he had a primary cancer of the 8 lung, or is it more probable that he had a colon 9 cancer which no one ever saw? 10 he had an mri of the abdomen. in that mri -- 11 it is one of the records in there -- they did not 12 see any colon cancer. 13 i'm just about done. 14 you know, it is cigarettes that caused the 15 epidemic of lung cancer. it does not come from 16 other things, and we know why. we know why. 17 because people that start smoking them -- at least 18 a lot of them -- cannot stop. a lot of them cannot, 19 you know, depending on what study you look at, 20 what statistic you look at. but, you know, when 21 somebody in a family finds out that they have got 22 cancer, you know, there is a -- there is a fear. 23 the whole family is afraid. the smoker's afraid. 24 mr. gelep, you know, had -- he knew where he 25 was headed, and he could not do anything about it. 31 1 you know, that is the tragedy of this is somebody 2 that smokes all the time, tried to quit a couple 3 times or more and is confronted with this 4 addiction -- he was chained to a giant; basically 5 chained to a giant. and he could not break from 6 the chains from these cigarette companies. 7 so what does he think? am i weak? am i a 8 weakling? what am i supposed -- what do you do? 9 what do you do when you cannot stop doing something 10 that you want to do? you know, it is a tragedy. 11 and now it is your turn. i'm going to ask, 12 what are you going to do about it? and what you 13 should do about it is check "yes" on this verdict 14 form. 15 we will come back, and i can just guarantee 16 that this second phase will be very short -- very, 17 very, very short. 18 thank you very much. 23 mr. acosta: may it please the court. this 24 will just take a few minutes. 25 one of the first things that ms. parker 105 1 talked about is the fact that cigarettes are 2 legal. everybody knows that they are legal. you 3 know, they -- there is a lot of legal products that 4 do not work well or a lot of legal products that 5 you might find are unreasonably dangerous or 6 defective or whatever, but they are still legal. 7 you know, if you think about some of the things 8 that have been -- pharmaceuticals, asbestos, 9 there is lots of things like that. they are all 10 legal. 11 you know, the government does not regulate 12 cigarettes. that is why there was some testimony 13 from dr. farone. there is nobody to tell philip 14 morris or reynolds or american tobacco how they 15 should make cigarettes, what they should put in 16 them, what they can put in them, what they cannot 17 put in them; they are just not regulated. they are 18 not regulated. so they make the choice of what 19 they put in it. 20 now, if they put a lot of bad things in it 21 and they do it on purpose to addict people, then 22 they can be held responsible for it. that is why 23 we are here. that is why we are here. we came to 24 court to ask you to ultimately hold them at least 25 partially responsible for this. 106 ms. parker: objection. same objection as 2 before. 3 the court: same ruling. 4 mr. acosta: now, one of the things that they 5 talked about was, you know, mr. gelep, you know, 6 this is about him. well, if you think about it, 7 mr. gelep smoked about a million cigarettes. if 8 he smoked, you know, 60 a day for 45 years, we are 9 getting pretty close to a million cigarettes. and 10 then you multiply that by what, eight to 12 puffs 11 per cigarette? what do you have then, eight 12 million doses -- eight million doses of 13 carcinogenic chemicals, up to 40 in every 14 cigarette smoke? eight million times. that is 15 plenty to cause lung cancer. 16 this was the board that was used by 17 ms. parker. and i want to tell you that the top 18 one, the location of the lung tumor, well, it was 19 central. the doctors said -- i think even 20 dr. bennett said, you know, that is where you find 21 cigarette tumors -- the centrally located tumors. 22 bronchiogenic is also where this was found, and 23 that makes lung cancer. 24 the cell type and the tumor. the death 25 certificate -- and you will see in the records there 107 1 are quite a few places where it is identified as an 2 adenocarcinoma -- adenocarcinoma of the lung. 3 well, that happens to be the most common kind of 4 lung cancer. so that is lung cancer. lung cancer. 5 pattern and spread. well, remember it was in 6 the upper right lobe, and it was spreading into 7 the mediastinum through the central part and they 8 thought that they needed to give him radiation 9 because of the possibility of what is called vena 10 cava syndrome. and that is where the tumor pushes 11 up against the -- it is a vein that comes back down 12 from the head so that your head does not fill up 13 with blood. so they radiated that area. but that 14 tumor was invading into the mediastinum, it 15 invaded into a rib, and you will see that -- the 16 fifth rib -- in the records, and then there was 17 the one centimeter node. that is the kind of 18 spread you see with lung cancer. that is what you 19 see with lung cancer. 20 presenting symptoms. presenting symptoms. 21 he had a cough. it did not go away. he had what 22 he thought was a cold. dr. hansen said that he 23 thought he had walking pneumonia. well, those are 24 the kind of symptoms you expect to have and 25 present with when you have lung cancer. 108 1 pathology staining. i showed you the report 2 about cea. cea is cea, whether it is staining onto 3 a slide or it is in a lab report. and it said it is 4 nonspecific, it is high in smokers -- which his 5 was -- found in smokers, it is not specific, and 6 you do not use it to screen. the -- you know, 7 dr. bennett said that he sent his own cases up to 8 sloan-kettering. this was the defense expert, the 9 guy that testified 1500 times as a forensic 10 pathologist -- he sent his cases to 11 sloan-kettering. sloan-kettering looked at these 12 pathology. if there was something wrong with this 13 staining, if it was not enough, they would have 14 said something. but you have got a second opinion 15 from one of the best hospitals in the country. 16 there was no necessity for dna testing. there was 17 no necessity for an autopsy. why would you get an 18 autopsy when everybody agrees it is lung cancer, 19 and you find out later the cigarette company comes 20 in and says it is something else? 21 just a couple more points, and then i'm going 22 to be done. 23 you know, i do not know if you caught this, 24 but a freudian slip is something that somebody 25 makes -- 109 1 the court: counsel, i think you need to 2 approach the bench. 3 (the following proceedings took place at 4 sidebar:) 5 the court: let me guess, you are going to say 6 that ms. parker has said that it caused his 7 cancer. 8 mr. acosta: she did. 9 the court: well, you are not going to be 10 attributing a freudian slip to her comments in 11 closing argument as some indication that somehow 12 she believed that that is what the case is. she 13 was in her counter alternative argument about 14 addiction, which is only applicable if they reject 15 her first argument about lung cancer. so i'm not 16 going to permit this argument. 17 mr. acosta: okay. 18 (sidebar concluded.) 19 mr. acosta: all right. we are going to 20 forget about the freudian slip. 21 and what we are going to talk about is 22 mr. geraghty's discussion about the brands. 23 one of the things that mr. geraghty did not 24 talk about is helen's testimony. you might recall 25 helen was up there testifying. and she is the one 110 1 that said back in her deposition a long time ago 2 that her dad switched to marlboro around 1975 -- 3 that is because she stole cigarettes from him 4 before she graduated from high school. you saw 5 her. and if you remember, john testified about 6 true in '79 and '80. there is not anything 7 sinister going on about these brands. what 8 happened is these folks got together before the 9 trial and looked at a bunch of -- all these photos 10 to refresh their recollection so that when they 11 came in here they would be giving the best 12 evidence that they could. 13 when they signed -- the mom signed 14 interrogatories a long time ago, they thought that 15 was true then. but, you know, like most people, 16 you think about it, you get in a lawsuit. and, 17 you know, it is ten years later in the same 18 lawsuit, so now you finally get to go to trial, 19 and you look at the photos to see if you can put 20 the whole thing together. 21 helen also testified about merit cigarettes, 22 which is, you know, another brand. so from '75 to 23 '95, there was some philip morris -- and you can 24 look at these photos and see what you think of the 25 packages on the originals. and a lot of them 111 1 look -- the '79/'80 one looks like a true, and 2 that fits with john's testimony. but some of 3 these others do not, they look like marlboro. so, 4 you know, that is what they said, and you just have 5 to take it for what it is worth, but it certainly 6 was not something that was said or done to be 7 something sinister in the case. 8 those are the only comments i have on this 9 part of the trial, and so i hope to see you again. 10 thank you.
