5 ms. parker: may it please the court? 02:55:01 6 mr. graham, and counsel, and ladies and gentlemen 02:55:09 7 of the jury, hello again. 02:55:12 8 i'm so appreciative. and i want to join mr. byrd 02:55:14 9 in thanking you for your service as jurors. my whole team 02:55:19 10 wants to thank you. you-all have been here for over a week 02:55:23 11 now. and we know you have been paying attention. 02:55:25 12 and i hope at the end of all this that you will 02:55:30 13 believe that you have enjoyed your service. it was a real 02:55:33 14 sacrifice, we know, for you to be here, and we appreciate it 02:55:35 15 very much. 02:55:38 16 now, when i started last monday -- and remember 02:55:42 17 that was the other time that i had a chance to talk directly 02:55:44 18 with you. and when we started last monday, i asked you then, 02:55:47 19 i said, this case is only about one smoker. remember i said 02:55:51 20 that? i said throughout the trial, please try to keep your 02:55:55 21 attention just on this one smoker. 02:55:59 22 that is what we are here about. we are only about 02:56:02 23 one smoker, and that is mrs. graham. 02:56:07 24 now, what did you hear at trial about mrs. graham? 02:56:09 25 what did her family members say? 02:56:14 210 vol 07 pm graham, earl 1 remember her daughter said, i knew mama was going 02:56:16 2 to do what mama wanted to do about smoking. 02:56:20 3 and remember that when mr. graham told her about 02:56:24 4 quitting, mrs. graham, according to him, just looked at him 02:56:27 5 and laughed. 02:56:31 6 remember mr. graham said, nobody forced the 02:56:33 7 cigarettes on her. 02:56:36 8 the testimony was unequivocal that she liked to 02:56:38 9 smoke. she enjoyed smoking. and when people told her -- 02:56:42 10 when her family members told her that smoking had health 02:56:46 11 risks and that she should quit, she told them to mind their 02:56:51 12 own business. 02:56:56 13 she called her cigarettes cancer sticks. and even 02:56:57 14 after she got sick with cancer, she never blamed, she was 02:57:00 15 never angry with the tobacco companies. 02:57:04 16 some people like to smoke cigarettes, and they 02:57:06 17 have that right to do it here in the united states. some 02:57:11 18 people just enjoy smoking. some people like to smoke. they 02:57:13 19 can quit if they want to, but they do not want to quit because 02:57:18 20 they enjoy it. 02:57:21 vol 07 pm graham, earl 21 and mrs. graham had the right here in the 02:57:22 22 united states to make that decision for herself. 02:57:24 23 now, most of the testimony that you heard during 02:57:27 24 the trial -- in fact, they put up one witness, dr. cummings, 02:57:32 25 who did not talk about mrs. graham at all. most of the 02:57:36 211 1 testimony that you heard from them at trial had absolutely 02:57:40 2 nothing to do with mrs. graham. 02:57:43 3 it is distraction testimony, to keep you from being 02:57:45 4 focused on the facts of mrs. graham. 02:57:50 5 but this case is only about her. and every 02:57:53 6 question on the verdict form asks about mrs. graham, whether 02:57:57 7 she was aware of the health risks of smoking, her life, what 02:58:02 8 she wanted to do with her life. 02:58:07 9 and so to decide the questions on the verdict 02:58:10 10 form, i would like to respectfully suggest that what you need 02:58:14 11 to do is to focus on mrs. graham and the facts of her life. 02:58:17 12 ladies and gentlemen, our witnesses in this trial 02:58:22 13 are the facts. all those facts that are in the medical 02:58:28 14 records, that her daughter admitted, that mr. graham 02:58:33 vol 07 pm graham, earl 15 admitted, the facts are our witnesses. 02:58:37 16 if anybody -- mr. byrd said something about our 02:58:39 17 not calling witnesses. if anybody goes back in the jury room 02:58:44 18 and anybody has a concern about that, judge treadwell himself 02:58:47 19 is going to tell you -- and this is a jury instruction that 02:58:50 20 you are going to hear from the court when the court gives you 02:58:53 21 the jury instructions. 02:58:56 22 the number of witnesses testifying concerning any 02:58:57 23 particular dispute is not controlling. 02:59:01 24 now, throughout this whole trial, what is been 02:59:03 25 happening is they have been telling this story that does not 02:59:09 212 1 fit the facts of mrs. graham's life. 02:59:12 2 and you-all have heard a lot since you have been 02:59:17 3 here last monday, but what i have tried to do for you this 02:59:19 4 afternoon is to boil all that down so that you will have -- i 02:59:23 5 can go over with you and you will have with you when you go 02:59:28 6 back to deliberate the information that you need to be able 02:59:30 7 to answer those questions on the verdict form. 02:59:34 8 after everything you have heard in this trial, i 02:59:37 9 would like to respectfully submit that it all boils down to 02:59:41 vol 07 pm graham, earl 10 five simple truths about mrs. graham that i would like to go 02:59:45 11 over with you. 02:59:50 12 here is truth no. 1: mrs. graham knew the risks 02:59:50 13 of smoking. 02:59:58 14 this is a woman who was intelligent. she kept up 02:59:59 15 with current affairs. there is no doubt whatsoever that she 03:00:03 16 knew that smoking was dangerous. but what they have tried to 03:00:06 17 do in their efforts to get $6 million is to come in here and 03:00:10 18 repackage her in a way that does not fit the facts about her 03:00:15 19 life. 03:00:20 20 now, she passed away in 1993. and, of course, 03:00:24 21 that was 20 years ago. 03:00:28 22 mr. graham testified he had -- when i asked him 03:00:30 23 here, he said it again in court, that even though warnings 03:00:34 24 were on every package she smoked, starting in 1966, 03:00:38 25 mr. graham said, right there on the witness stand, that 03:00:44 213 1 mrs. graham did not really know about the health risks of 03:00:47 2 smoking. 03:00:52 3 okay. what are the facts, our witnesses, what are 03:00:54 4 the facts about that? 03:00:57 vol 07 pm graham, earl 5 mr. byrd: objection. disclosure. i believe the 03:00:59 6 rule is clear. 03:01:06 7 the court: you are talking about the 03:01:07 8 demonstrative? 03:01:08 9 mr. byrd: right. 03:01:09 10 ms. parker: we have had no requirement about 03:01:12 11 exchanging any kind of demonstratives. i've got nothing from 03:01:15 12 them. we had no discussion about that at all. 03:01:20 13 mr. byrd: exactly. we have not seen anything. 03:01:22 14 we have used exhibits was all -- we were going to use the 03:01:27 15 verdict form and jury instruction. we did not get any 03:01:29 16 disclosure of this, i do not believe. there are certainly 03:01:31 17 local rules about -- i would just like to see them. 03:01:33 18 ms. parker: i'm happy to give him a copy now. 03:01:36 19 the court: well, give him a copy. 03:01:39 20 proceed. 03:01:54 21 ms. parker: let us go over the facts that you have 03:01:56 22 in this case about mrs. graham and her awareness of health 03:01:59 23 risks. 03:02:05 24 well, she was born into a world where the risks of 03:02:05 25 smoking were already known. remember back in 1899, the state 03:02:09 214 vol 07 pm graham, earl 1 of florida enacted a law. we showed you that law during 03:02:14 2 trial, a law that prohibits the sale of cigarettes because of 03:02:17 3 the dangers of smoking. 03:02:22 4 now, of course, that was later changed because the 03:02:23 5 state of florida decided that adults could have the choice to 03:02:27 6 smoke. 03:02:29 7 and then we know -- and i showed you this during 03:02:30 8 trial -- in 1906, remember, there was the official document 03:02:34 9 from the state of florida health department, and that 03:02:39 10 official document from the state of florida referred to 03:02:42 11 cigarettes as an addiction. and another one -- there it is. 03:02:45 12 another one that we showed you from 1912 referred to it as 03:02:49 13 coffin nails. 03:02:54 14 and then remember reader's digest. you saw the 03:02:54 15 reader's digest articles at trial. they started publishing 03:03:00 16 articles about the health risks of smoking starting in 1924, 03:03:04 17 and they continued to publish dozens and dozens of articles 03:03:09 18 about the health risks of smoking. 03:03:13 19 and, in fact, ninety percent of all americans in 1954, 03:03:15 vol 07 pm graham, earl 20 ninety percent from this poll that you were shown, june 1954, 03:03:24 21 said that they had heard or read that cigarette smoking may 03:03:29 22 be a cause of lung cancer. 03:03:34 23 and then remember the 1964 report came out. that 03:03:35 24 was front-page news. everywhere in the united states, 03:03:40 25 including here in jacksonville. remember, we showed you 03:03:43 215 1 these newspaper articles. and that same year, the american 03:03:46 2 medical association -- 03:03:52 3 mr. byrd: your honor, this slide i object to 03:03:53 4 under orders in the motion in limine about actual knowledge. 03:03:55 5 there is no -- can we discuss this? i've just never seen 03:04:00 6 these. 03:04:04 7 the court: i do not have it either. 03:04:05 8 mr. byrd: can you take it down? 03:04:08 9 the court: yes, take it down. 03:04:10 [#deleted sidebar#] 9 ms. parker: let me go back to where we were 03:13:21 10 before we took the break. 03:13:24 11 we were talking about the 1964 surgeon general's 03:13:26 12 report. remember when that came out, it was front-page news. 03:13:29 13 all across the country. including -- remember, you saw these 03:13:34 14 newspaper articles during trial during the actual -- will you 03:13:37 15 pull those up. the newspaper articles. 03:13:43 16 during the trial, you saw these newspaper 03:13:45 17 articles. 03:13:48 18 back. there you go. 19 remember those? this was front-page news here in 03:13:52 vol 07 pm graham, earl 20 jacksonville, as well as all around the united states. and 03:13:56 21 these were the newspapers, of course, that mrs. graham 03:14:00 22 herself read according to her family members. 03:14:04 23 that same year, the american medical association, 03:14:07 24 you heard this at trial, as well, said that the hazards of 03:14:12 25 cigarette smoking were common knowledge. 03:14:17 223 1 and we know about the television news reports on 03:14:19 2 it, and the public service announcements, like the ones you 03:14:23 3 saw from larry hagman. and then remember you saw this slide 03:14:28 4 when we cross-examined dr. cummings. this is from daniel 03:14:33 5 horn. remember, daniel horn was the head of the federal 03:14:38 6 government's national clearinghouse on smoking and health. 03:14:42 7 and he said, back in 1968, you should stand on a 03:14:45 8 rooftop and shout smoking is dangerous at the top of your 03:14:51 9 lungs and you would not be telling anyone anything they did 03:14:55 10 not already know. 03:14:58 11 now, in addition to this evidence, what have you 03:14:59 12 heard in this trial about mrs. graham? and, remember, no 03:15:08 13 amount of money that somebody spends on ads compares to what 03:15:12 14 you learn in your own life and with your own family members. 03:15:16 vol 07 pm graham, earl 15 what did she learn in her own life about the 03:15:21 16 health risks of smoking? well, remember the key testimony of 03:15:24 17 her daughter, barbara beaty, the one who knew her the best. 03:15:29 18 remember, ms. beaty came in here yesterday and she made it 03:15:34 19 clear over and over that her mother knew about the health 03:15:38 20 risks of smoking. 03:15:41 21 and mrs. graham called her cigarettes cancer 03:15:42 22 sticks. remember the testimony was she would go over to the 03:15:45 23 table and she would see her package of cigarettes and she 03:15:50 24 would say, let me light one of these cancer sticks. 03:15:53 25 and remember mrs. graham called her smoker's cough 03:15:58 224 1 a damn smoker's cough. remember that evidence? that is 03:16:03 2 another warning to her from her own body that smoking was 03:16:06 3 causing her to have a cough, and she acknowledged that. she 03:16:10 4 blamed that on smoking. 03:16:15 5 and remember her mother. remember the testimony 03:16:16 6 about her mother who was diagnosed with emphysema. as soon 03:16:19 7 as she was diagnosed with emphysema, she quit smoking, and 03:16:23 8 she put a sign on her front door that said "no smoking." 03:16:25 vol 07 pm graham, earl 9 that is another warning to mrs. graham about the 03:16:29 10 health risks of smoking from her own mother who told her and 03:16:32 11 her brothers and sisters that they should not smoke. 03:16:36 12 and then when her brother, charles herrin, took 03:16:40 13 the stand -- he was the very first witness for the plaintiff. 03:16:43 14 and mr. walker examined him. when mr. walker cross-examined 03:16:46 15 him, he admitted, plain as can be, she knew. he said that as 03:16:50 16 clear as day sitting right here on the witness stand. 03:16:54 17 and then mr. graham, yesterday, admitted that when 03:16:57 18 he quit smoking himself, he felt a whole lot better. he said 03:17:00 19 he felt healthier, and he said he told mrs. graham that. 03:17:05 20 again, more information to mrs. graham. 03:17:08 21 mr. graham told her that smoking could cause lung 03:17:14 22 cancer. you heard that yesterday. you heard yesterday that 03:17:17 23 mrs. graham warned her children that they should not smoke 03:17:20 24 and that smoking was a very bad habit and they should not 03:17:24 25 start. 03:17:28 225 1 you heard that mrs. graham read newspapers 03:17:29 2 throughout her life, cover to cover. she read magazines, and 03:17:32 3 she watched the news on tv almost every night. you heard 03:17:35 vol 07 pm graham, earl 4 mr. graham admit that, and her daughter said the same, when 03:17:38 5 they were living together. 03:17:42 6 and mrs. graham was exposed to these warning 03:17:44 7 labels every time she started smoking. remember the three 03:17:46 8 warning labels that you saw at trial. 03:17:51 9 now, after all of that mountain of information 03:17:54 10 there, you are going to have to decide if it is credible to 03:17:59 11 believe that mrs. graham did not know about the health risks 03:18:05 12 of smoking, which is what her husband, mr. graham, the one 03:18:10 13 who is here asking for money, that is what he said yesterday up 03:18:13 14 on the stand. 03:18:17 15 the real mrs. graham, the facts of the real 03:18:17 16 mrs. graham, was well aware of the risks of smoking, and 03:18:23 17 there was nothing that reynolds or philip morris did that 03:18:28 18 changed that. 03:18:31 19 now, the plaintiff has spent a lot of time in this 03:18:31 20 case trying to convince you that the public did not know 03:18:36 21 about the health risks of smoking because of something the 03:18:40 22 tobacco companies did. 03:18:44 23 well, let us talk about that for a minute. you 03:18:45 24 know, you do not need to know the minute details and all the 03:18:50 vol 07 pm graham, earl 25 scientific information that are in some of the documents you 03:18:56 226 1 were seeing to know what is really important, and that is that 03:19:00 2 smoking causes health problems, smoking can cause you to have 03:19:03 3 cancer, smoking can result in your death. 03:19:08 4 and one of the things that you can do in this case 03:19:10 5 when you are back in the jury room is to use your common 03:19:12 6 sense. so let me give you an example -- again, just use your 03:19:16 7 common sense when you think about that. 03:19:20 8 we all know that if you drink alcoholic beverages, 03:19:21 9 if you drink beer and go out and drink liquor, you do not know 03:19:26 10 those scientific minute technical parts of drinking, what is 03:19:31 11 in alcohol. you do not know exactly what the chemicals are in 03:19:34 12 beer or in liquor. you do not know exactly how beer or liquor 03:19:38 13 affects your brain. you know, you do not know all that 03:19:44 14 information. 03:19:46 15 but if you use your common sense, every one of us 03:19:49 16 knows what is important, and that is if you drink too much, 03:19:51 17 you can get drunk, and if you drink too much and you drive, 03:19:54 18 you can cause a wreck and you can kill somebody. 03:19:57 19 that is what is important. 03:20:00 vol 07 pm graham, earl 20 and it is the same thing with cigarettes. 03:20:02 21 mrs. graham knew what all the rest of the american public 03:20:05 22 knew, and that is what is important, and that is that smoking 03:20:09 23 had health risks. 03:20:11 24 you did not need to know the specific technical 03:20:13 25 aspects of how that worked to know the risks that were 03:20:16 227 1 associated with using that product. 03:20:21 2 at the end of the day, the simple truth is that 03:20:24 3 mrs. graham was fully aware of the health risks of smoking 03:20:28 4 and their efforts to repackage her as somebody who did not 03:20:32 5 know because of the tobacco companies is just not correct. 03:20:36 6 now, let us go to the second simple truth in this 03:20:40 7 case, and that is that mrs. graham was able to quit smoking. 03:20:44 8 now, mr. graham is required to prove that 03:20:48 9 mrs. graham was addicted to cigarettes, and -- and that the 03:20:54 10 legal cause of her cancer was an addiction to cigarettes. 03:20:59 11 those are two different things. those are questions 1 and 2 03:21:04 12 on the verdict form. 03:21:11 13 your answer to both of those should be no. 03:21:13 vol 07 pm graham, earl 14 what was the evidence? what evidence did you 03:21:16 15 hear? well, was the evidence that nicotine addiction 03:21:18 16 controlled mrs. graham and left her no choice, no matter how 03:21:22 17 much she tried, but just to keep on smoking until she passed 03:21:27 18 away? was that the evidence? or was the evidence that faye 03:21:31 19 graham liked to smoke? she enjoyed smoking. she did not 03:21:35 20 seriously try to quit, and she had the ability to quit at any 03:21:39 21 time. 03:21:42 22 now, this case is not about the general issue 03:21:43 23 about whether or not cigarettes can be addictive, because 03:21:46 24 they can be. and this case is not about other people or 03:21:49 25 someone else you may know who is addicted. that is not what 03:21:52 228 1 we are here about. we are only here about mrs. graham. 03:21:55 2 mrs. graham did not fit the profile of somebody 03:21:58 3 who was an addict. what were the facts of mrs. graham? 03:22:03 4 well, she was not someone who hated smoking. 03:22:07 5 remember the testimony from both her daughter and 03:22:11 6 her husband was that she liked to smoke. she enjoyed 03:22:14 7 smoking. remember her routine was that she had a cigarette 03:22:17 8 with a cup of coffee. her daughter said that cigarettes and 03:22:20 vol 07 pm graham, earl 9 coffee went together for her mother. 03:22:26 10 she is not someone who sincerely tried everything 03:22:29 11 she could to quit but she just could not. that is not her. 03:22:33 12 she was not someone who was unable to quit because she was an 03:22:39 13 addict, a person who lost free will about smoking. 03:22:42 14 she is not somebody who was tormented by her 03:22:46 15 smoking. as a matter of fact, the evidence was she was never 03:22:49 16 angry at a tobacco company even after she got sick. 03:22:53 17 the profile that they are describing does not fit 03:22:57 18 the facts of this case. 03:23:00 19 and the true picture, the true facts of 03:23:02 20 mrs. graham are just the opposite. she is a lady who enjoyed 03:23:05 21 smoking, who knew the risks, and who wanted to smoke. 03:23:10 22 now, you heard at trial there are a lot of 03:23:13 23 different labels for smoking. sometimes people call it a 03:23:16 24 habit. sometimes people call it an addiction. there have 03:23:20 25 been different definitions of addiction. 03:23:23 229 1 remember our federal government said that there 03:23:24 2 was a classic definition of addiction, and that definition 03:23:27 3 required intoxication. and smoking is not intoxicating. 03:23:32 vol 07 pm graham, earl 4 and then that definition has changed by the 03:23:35 5 federal government at a later time. 03:23:39 6 so there have been different labels. whatever you 03:23:41 7 call it, though, the question is and what is important is, can 03:23:45 8 the smoker quit? can smokers quit? and the answer is yes. 03:23:47 9 all smokers can quit. even addicted smokers. 03:23:53 10 of course, it may be more difficult for some 03:23:56 11 smokers than for others, but with sufficient motivation and 03:23:59 12 effort, all smokers can quit. and that is why there are over 03:24:03 13 60 million, 60 million former smokers, alive today in the 03:24:07 14 united states. 03:24:13 15 3,000 people quit smoking every day. 03:24:13 16 now, to get around the facts of mrs. graham, they 03:24:17 17 keep talking about this brain disease. okay. that is their 03:24:22 18 theory of their case, is that mrs. graham had a brain disease 03:24:27 19 and, therefore, she was not able to quit. let us talk about 03:24:31 20 that. 03:24:35 21 that story just does not fit the facts of 03:24:37 22 mrs. graham. here's what the evidence shows about 03:24:40 23 mrs. graham. nicotine does not permanently change your 03:24:44 24 brain. nicotine leaves your body after two to three days. 03:24:48 vol 07 pm graham, earl 25 nicotine does not prevent smokers from understanding the 03:24:52 230 1 risks of smoking. nicotine does not prevent smokers from 03:24:56 2 quitting. 03:25:00 3 so let us talk for a few minutes about the 03:25:00 4 witnesses. what was the evidence about the witnesses that 03:25:06 5 the plaintiff brought you on the issue of addiction? well, 03:25:10 6 there was dr. cummings. remember, dr. cummings has this 03:25:13 7 traveling show. he goes around from courtroom to courtroom 03:25:17 8 testifying. this is his 11th trial just this year. 03:25:21 9 remember this chart that i showed to dr. cummings 03:25:27 10 when he was here? this is just the amount of time he spent 03:25:29 11 the last six weeks testifying. sixty percent of his income 03:25:33 12 comes from testifying. he is made over a million dollars. 03:25:39 13 and i asked him when i cross-examined him, and he 03:25:44 14 agreed, he is not an independent witness. he admits he is 03:25:47 15 biased. he said he was rooting for mr. graham to win. and 03:25:50 16 he gave no opinions that are specific to mrs. graham. he 03:25:55 17 talked for, what, over two days just in general. 03:25:59 18 he has this one-size-fits-all presentation, and he 03:26:05 vol 07 pm graham, earl 19 goes from courtroom to courtroom to courtroom and puts it on. 03:26:08 20 and outside of the courtroom when he is not being 03:26:11 21 paid, he has a smoking clinic where he tells people to come 03:26:16 22 to his clinic, you can quit. he never tells anybody, hey, 03:26:20 23 leave, i do not want you to come. you cannot quit. 03:26:24 24 remember, i showed you this brochure when he 03:26:27 25 cross-examined him. this is his own brochure that he wrote 03:26:30 231 1 and it says, if you answer those questions, you can stop 03:26:33 2 smoking. so even their witness, dr. cummings, admits smokers 03:26:38 3 can quit. 03:26:44 4 who was their other witness on addiction? 03:26:45 5 dr. feingold. another professional witness. almost all he 03:26:47 6 does is come to court, also. remember, he said he made 03:26:53 7 almost $40 million testifying. much of it with 03:26:56 8 mr. lantinberg's law partner, mr. wilner. he and mr. wilner 03:27:02 9 have been working together for over 30 years. 03:27:07 10 and dr. feingold did not even know anything about 03:27:10 11 mrs. graham's children. the only deposition he had read in 03:27:16 12 the entire case was the deposition of the plaintiff, of 03:27:20 13 mr. graham, the person who is here asking for money. 03:27:23 vol 07 pm graham, earl 14 again, the facts are our witnesses. no medical 03:27:26 15 record says that mrs. graham was addicted. no treating 03:27:33 16 doctor of mrs. graham said that mrs. graham was addicted. 03:27:39 17 but dr. feingold is coming to court, disagreeing 03:27:44 18 with the medical records. 03:27:48 19 he was hired and he was paid to come into court 03:27:49 20 for one reason, and that is to take the stand and to say what 03:27:54 21 he needed to say so they could answer the legal requirements 03:27:57 22 that they have to make to meet their burden of proof. 03:28:01 23 but even dr. feingold, even he admitted two 03:28:04 24 things: mrs. graham was not a robot. and, of course, 03:28:10 25 mrs. graham could have quit smoking at any time. 03:28:15 232 1 it is still the responsibility of the smoker, 03:28:20 2 mrs. graham, to make that effort to quit. 03:28:24 3 so what is the evidence about mrs. graham's effort 03:28:28 4 to quit? well, you have to want to quit for yourself. 03:28:32 5 mrs. graham had to want to quit for herself. it does not work 03:28:37 6 if somebody else wants you to quit but you do not. you have 03:28:39 7 to be motivated for yourself. 03:28:42 8 mrs. graham is the person who was in charge of her 03:28:44 vol 07 pm graham, earl 9 decisions about smoking. 03:28:49 10 she never made a serious effort to quit because 03:28:50 11 she did not want to. she wanted to smoke. she liked to 03:28:55 12 smoke. that is how she decided she wanted to live her life. 03:28:58 13 remember, you heard every single witness agree, 03:29:02 14 she never made an effort to quit that lasted more than 24 03:29:05 15 hours. 03:29:09 16 her daughter, barbara, who testified yesterday, 03:29:10 17 who knew her better than anyone else, said she only tried to 03:29:13 18 quit one time in her entire life. and that happened when she 03:29:16 19 went to hypnosis, and that was after 1985. 03:29:22 20 just think about that. from when she first 03:29:26 21 started smoking all the way until sometime after 1985, her 03:29:29 22 daughter, who lived with her, most of the time, she only 03:29:33 23 tried to quit one time, and that is when she went to hypnosis. 03:29:39 24 what happened? when she went to hypnosis, 03:29:42 25 mr. graham went with her. mr. graham says when she got back 03:29:45 233 1 in the car -- as soon as she got back in the car, she started 03:29:49 2 smoking again. now, that is not a serious effort to quit. 03:29:52 vol 07 pm graham, earl 3 she never threw out her cigarettes. that is 03:29:56 4 absolutely undisputed here. 03:29:59 5 she enjoyed smoking. and smoking does not take 03:30:00 6 away personal responsibility. the smoker has control of her 03:30:03 7 own behavior. 03:30:10 8 addiction does not mean that you cannot quit. 03:30:12 9 addiction does not relieve a smoker of responsibility for her 03:30:16 10 own behavior. 03:30:20 11 and you know there is nothing wrong with the 03:30:20 12 decisions that mrs. graham made. it is legal to smoke. 03:30:25 13 that is how she wanted to lead her life. and we are not 03:30:28 14 second -- we ask that you not second-guess the decisions that 03:30:31 15 she made for her own life. 03:30:36 16 now, question 2 on the verdict form asks 03:30:38 17 specifically about legal cause. well, the answer to that 03:30:42 18 question on the verdict form should be no, because addiction 03:30:46 19 did not prevent her from quitting. she never made a serious 03:30:49 20 effort to quit. 03:30:53 21 that is going to be undisputed when you go back to 03:30:54 22 the jury room. no witness told you otherwise. 03:30:57 23 mrs. graham knew smoking had health risks, and she 03:30:59 vol 07 pm graham, earl 24 never made a serious effort to quit. 03:31:03 25 which brings us to truth no. 3, which is that 03:31:06 234 1 mr. graham did not prove his medical case. 03:31:10 2 the plaintiff has to prove to your satisfaction 03:31:13 3 that mrs. graham had lung cancer, and that it was caused by 03:31:18 4 smoking. and that is question 3 on the verdict form. 03:31:23 5 again, it was 1993 when mrs. graham passed away. 03:31:28 6 and you are going to have to decide if they have met their 03:31:33 7 burden of proof to prove to you that her cancer actually 03:31:36 8 started in her lung. those very first cancer cells started 03:31:39 9 in her lung, and that her cancer was caused by smoking. they 03:31:43 10 had the burden of proof on that. 03:31:47 11 well, ladies and gentlemen, let me just 03:31:49 12 respectfully suggest to you that that question, answering 03:31:51 13 that question is going to come down to who do you believe, 03:31:55 14 her doctors or dr. feingold? 03:31:58 15 now, dr. feingold was their witness that they 03:32:01 16 brought in. remember all that evidence on his background? 03:32:06 17 he is the 40-million-dollar machine. he did not treat 03:32:09 18 mrs. graham. he never talked to her doctors. he is not a 03:32:13 vol 07 pm graham, earl 19 pathologist. 03:32:19 20 compare that to the treaters. remember, this is 03:32:21 21 back in 1992 and 1993 when those medical records were 03:32:24 22 created. there was no lawsuit back then. nobody was trying 03:32:28 23 to get money back then. that is mrs. graham going to her 03:32:31 24 doctor trying to get well, trying to get better, and all her 03:32:34 25 doctors were doing was trying to treat her as a patient. she 03:32:38 235 1 was their patient. 03:32:42 2 and here's what these -- the facts, our witnesses, 03:32:42 3 the facts, here's what these medical records say. well, 03:32:47 4 there is no medical record that said her cancer was caused by 03:32:51 5 smoking. not a one. those are in evidence. and you can 03:32:56 6 look through all of them. there is not a place in there that 03:32:59 7 says it. 03:33:02 8 her treating doctors, not a one of them said her 03:33:03 9 cancer was caused by smoking. 03:33:06 10 and the death certificate, mr. byrd showed you the 03:33:09 11 death certificate when he was talking with you. her death 03:33:12 12 certificate does not say anywhere on there that her cancer 03:33:15 13 was caused by smoking. and that is something they have to 03:33:19 vol 07 pm graham, earl 14 prove. 03:33:23 15 remember about the clear chest x-ray? remember 03:33:24 16 this medical record that mr. walker cross-examined 03:33:29 17 dr. feingold on? it says down there, chest x-ray negative. 03:33:32 18 dr. feingold says he disagrees with the treaters. 03:33:37 19 remember, he said, well, this was an error. he said, it was 03:33:40 20 late at night -- and this was a neurosurgeon, for gosh sakes. 03:33:44 21 he says, this is an error. her lung was never biopsied. 03:33:48 22 there was never any tissue taken from her lung. they only 03:33:53 23 biopsied her brain. she had surgery on her brain, not on her 03:33:56 24 lung. 03:34:00 25 and her doctor said -- remember this medical 03:34:01 236 1 record that possible primary sites, that means where it could 03:34:05 2 have started, include the female reproductive tract, the 03:34:08 3 gi tract, breast, and lung. 03:34:12 4 and then remember about the signet ring cells. 03:34:14 5 that is really important. her doctor, her own pathologist, 03:34:19 6 again, not involved in any litigation back in 1992, he looked 03:34:24 7 at her actual tissue and he said in his report that there was 03:34:28 vol 07 pm graham, earl 8 areas of signet ring differentiation. 03:34:34 9 dr. feingold says that is another mistake by her 03:34:38 10 treaters. he says he disagrees with that. 03:34:41 11 and this is really important, dr. feingold 03:34:44 12 admitted that he may not have seen all the slides that her 03:34:48 13 doctors saw. 03:34:51 14 there was -- again, there was never a biopsy from 03:34:52 15 her lung. well, why is this important? why is this so 03:34:56 16 important -- 03:35:00 17 mr. byrd: objection, your honor. the order. 03:35:00 18 the court: overruled. 03:35:02 19 ms. parker: why is this so important about the 03:35:03 20 signet ring cells? it is because dr. feingold himself 03:35:07 21 admitted if you have signet ring cells present, it is more 03:35:10 22 likely that your cancer started in your gi tract. and they 03:35:15 23 never did any test of her gi tract. 03:35:19 24 and even when signet ring cells arrive in the 03:35:24 25 lung, dr. feingold admitted it has not been shown that those 03:35:28 237 1 cancers are caused by smoking. that is why it is so important 03:35:32 2 for him to come in here and say there were no cigarette ring 03:35:36 vol 07 pm graham, earl 3 cells, because if there were, they cannot meet their burden 03:35:40 4 of proof. 03:35:43 5 so, again, who are you going to believe? 03:35:43 6 dr. feingold, who looked at this tissue, says 03:35:45 7 he -- cannot even say he looked at all of it, 20 years later, 03:35:49 8 or her treaters who are independent. 03:35:53 9 again, the facts are our witnesses. 03:35:56 10 but it is not enough for them just to prove this 03:36:02 11 issue about the medicine. there are a lot of other things 03:36:05 12 they have to prove in the case, and so i need to go over 03:36:07 13 those issues with you, as well. 03:36:09 14 and that brings us to truth no. 4, which is 03:36:11 15 mr. graham cannot establish something called legal cause. 03:36:14 16 that is on the verdict form. 03:36:17 17 their claims require an established link or a tie 03:36:20 18 between mrs. graham and something that reynolds or philip 03:36:25 19 morris did. 03:36:29 20 it cannot be guesswork. it cannot be speculation. 03:36:30 21 it has to be proof, not doubt. they have to prove it. and 03:36:34 22 without that, there is no legal cause, and that is required on 03:36:38 23 the verdict form. 03:36:42 vol 07 pm graham, earl 24 well, they spent during the trial most of their 03:36:43 25 time talking about tobacco companies just in general. but 03:36:47 238 1 do not let that throw you off the fact of mrs. graham. 03:36:51 2 dr. cummings said there were 16 million documents 03:36:57 3 out there that he had looked at. remember that? 03:37:00 4 well, they have cherry-picked a few phrases and a 03:37:02 5 few sentences from some of the documents to come in here and 03:37:07 6 to make us look bad. that is all that they are trying to do. 03:37:10 7 they are trying to get you mad and upset so you will not 03:37:13 8 think about mrs. graham. 03:37:17 9 but in the end, you are going to see none of those 03:37:18 10 things that they talked about has anything to do with her, 03:37:23 11 and you are only here to decide issues about her. 03:37:25 12 for example, they do not -- they have only given 03:37:29 13 you half of the story, and they do not want you to hear the 03:37:33 14 rest of it. 03:37:36 15 even that chart that mr. byrd showed you, that big 03:37:37 16 chart he had here, the timeline, remember all of those pink 03:37:41 17 notes that i put on there about the rest of it, other things 03:37:44 18 that happened, he took those off. he does not want you to 03:37:47 vol 07 pm graham, earl 19 know that. he does not want you to think about that. 03:37:50 20 mr. byrd: objection. i did not take those off. 03:37:53 21 the court: i'll sustain that. 03:37:55 22 mr. byrd: move to strike that. 03:37:58 23 the court: no. just move on. 03:37:59 24 ms. parker: for example, you were shown this 03:38:01 25 document by dr. cummings from 1959. remember, they showed 03:38:03 239 1 you this document with dr. cummings. and he said, oh, this 03:38:07 2 is proof that we knew something that the public did not from 03:38:13 3 november 1959. and this is about some chemicals that were 03:38:16 4 known to produce cancer. 03:38:22 5 and when i cross-examined him, i'm the one who had 03:38:24 6 to bring out that very same year, the very same month in 03:38:28 7 reader's digest is the same information. 03:38:32 8 and then remember about the congressional 03:38:36 9 hearings. they showed you a tiny, little snippet for about 03:38:40 10 ten seconds where they went down the line and they asked the 03:38:44 11 ceos about addiction. and remember the ceo of reynolds was 03:38:47 12 cut off. he was trying to answer and he was cut off. and 03:38:51 vol 07 pm graham, earl 13 the congressman who was conducting the hearings said, i'll 03:38:55 14 take that as a no. 03:38:58 15 and then i had to come back and play the rest of 03:38:59 16 it, where he explained that when he said cigarettes were not 03:39:02 17 addicting, that is true under the classic definition, which 03:39:06 18 requires intoxication. 03:39:12 19 and i asked dr. cummings and he admitted that what 03:39:14 20 mr. johnston said on that video that you were shown was true. 03:39:19 21 cigarettes are not addictive under that classic definition. 03:39:24 22 again, they showed you a tiny, little snippet, not the whole 03:39:28 23 story, to try to make you mad at us. 03:39:32 24 mr. lantinberg said in his opening last monday, he 03:39:36 25 said, you know, we need to take you back in time. remember, 03:39:41 240 1 he said you need to go back in time, back in time. well, 03:39:44 2 that is true for the defendants as well. 03:39:47 3 reynolds and philip morris need to be judged by 03:39:49 4 what they knew and what was going on back then, not years and 03:39:53 5 years later when, you know, monday morning quarterbacking and 03:39:59 6 when you have hindsight, things might have been done 03:40:03 7 differently. 03:40:06 vol 07 pm graham, earl 8 i want to talk about what the evidence was about 03:40:07 9 this charge that they keep making that we manipulated 03:40:10 10 cigarettes. well, that is not correct. dr. cummings 03:40:14 11 admitted when i cross-examined him that cigarettes today are 03:40:18 12 no more addictive than cigarettes in the 1950s. 03:40:23 13 think about that. everything from the 1950s 03:40:28 14 forward that they claim we did, which i'm going to address in 03:40:32 15 a minute, he says notwithstanding all of that, cigarettes 03:40:36 16 today are no more addictive. again, it is just some phrases 03:40:39 17 that they want to use, like rigging cigarettes and all, to 03:40:45 18 get you mad at us. for example, about these light 03:40:49 19 cigarettes, and mr. byrd talked about those. 03:40:52 20 all of these people, all of these organizations, 03:40:55 21 told us that we should research this issue of lowering -- 03:40:59 22 lowering the tar-to-nicotine ratio as a way to try to develop 03:41:05 23 a safer cigarette. that is why we were doing this research. 03:41:09 24 because the surgeon general -- three reports said we should 03:41:16 25 do the research, and advocated this. 03:41:17 241 1 the national cancer institute -- remember that 03:41:19 2 tobacco working group, we were a member of it. the 03:41:22 vol 07 pm graham, earl 3 department of agriculture folks were a member. they 03:41:24 4 investigated this as well -- as well as all these other 03:41:27 5 people listed up here. 03:41:30 6 remember the jar i showed you of the reconstituted 03:41:37 7 tobacco. and i asked dr. cummings, and he finally agreed, 03:41:40 8 that process that he talked about is a way of manipulating 03:41:42 9 nicotine. in that process, the nicotine is taken off, less 03:41:47 10 nicotine is put back on. that process actually results in 03:41:51 11 tobacco that has less nicotine than when it started, and he 03:41:55 12 agreed with that. 03:41:59 13 ladies and gentlemen, there is a point about these 03:42:06 14 light cigarettes and the low-tar issue that i want to spend a 03:42:09 15 few minutes and talk to you about. you heard it this 03:42:14 16 morning, and i want to take some time and explain what it 03:42:16 17 means. 03:42:19 18 this morning you saw a video of dr. jupe. 03:42:19 19 remember, he was the philip morris witness -- it was the 03:42:24 20 first one they played this morning. dr. jupe said on the 03:42:27 21 video that in the e.u., that is the european union, of course, 03:42:31 22 in europe, that these light cigarettes are the only ones that 03:42:37 23 are allowed to be sold. think about that. 03:42:41 vol 07 pm graham, earl 24 if you travel to france or to europe or any other 03:42:45 25 country in europe today, these cigarettes that they claim 03:42:48 242 1 that we did all these bad things about, that is the only kind 03:42:51 2 of cigarettes you can buy, because in europe, they are 03:42:55 3 officially considered safer. 03:42:59 4 there is a good faith basis for reynolds and 03:43:03 5 philip morris to have done this research and to make the 03:43:06 6 claims that they made, which are the same claims that were 03:43:09 7 being made by the surgeon general, the national cancer 03:43:12 8 institute, and all these other people. 03:43:15 9 and dr. cummings never tied any of the claims he 03:43:17 10 made, any of those allegations he made up on the stand, to 03:43:21 11 mrs. graham. 03:43:26 12 now, they showed you some cigarette advertising. 03:43:26 13 advertising had nothing to do with mrs. graham's life. there 03:43:30 14 is no evidence at all that she started to smoke because she 03:43:35 15 saw an ad and ran out to buy a pack of cigarettes. there is 03:43:38 16 no evidence that she made any decision about smoking because 03:43:42 17 of ads. 03:43:45 vol 07 pm graham, earl 18 i asked her daughter that. her daughter said no. 03:43:46 19 i asked mr. graham that, and mr. graham said no. again, no 03:43:49 20 legal cause. 03:43:53 21 anything that she really did see is fair game, but 03:43:54 22 all of this other stuff that they keep talking about is not 03:44:00 23 fair game. there is no legal cause. there is no tie. there 03:44:03 24 is no link to mrs. graham. 03:44:06 25 here's what mr. graham and the daughter, barbara, 03:44:07 243 1 both agreed to. they both agreed on the witness stand that 03:44:12 2 mrs. graham never saw and never heard any kind of statement 03:44:17 3 from a tobacco company, never said anything a tobacco company 03:44:20 4 did caused her to start smoking or continue smoking. she 03:44:24 5 never had any communications with reynolds or any other 03:44:28 6 tobacco company. again, no legal cause. 03:44:31 7 which brings us to truth no. 5, which is the last 03:44:34 8 one, and that is that cigarettes are legal. cigarettes are 03:44:38 9 both dangerous and legal. 03:44:42 10 now, there is nothing that you have heard in this 03:44:46 11 case, none of those documents, none of that testimony, there 03:44:50 12 is nothing that you have heard in this case that is not 03:44:54 vol 07 pm graham, earl 13 already known by the federal government, by the surgeon 03:44:56 14 general, by the state of florida, by the national cancer 03:44:59 15 institute. 03:45:04 16 those documents are and they have been public. 03:45:04 17 they are available on a website. this is not some special 03:45:07 18 secret something that only you have seen. that was not 03:45:12 19 correct. 03:45:15 20 our government, the state of florida, and the 03:45:16 21 federal government knowing about the health risks of 03:45:19 22 smoking -- you know this number he keeps talking about, 03:45:25 23 400,000 people die every year from smoking, that is an 03:45:27 24 official federal government number. our federal government 03:45:31 25 knows that. 03:45:34 244 1 but our government, our society, has said, 03:45:35 2 notwithstanding that, people know about the health risks of 03:45:39 3 smoking and cigarettes should be a legal product. 03:45:43 4 mr. byrd: objection, your honor. the order. 03:45:47 5 the court: overruled. 03:45:50 6 ms. parker: in fact, in terms of what was known 03:45:51 7 in 19 -- the surgeon general said it was known back in 1920 03:45:55 vol 07 pm graham, earl 8 that nicotine was in tobacco in cigarettes. it is no secret. 03:46:01 9 and this is really important. reynolds cannot be 03:46:08 10 held liable merely for selling cigarettes or advertising 03:46:11 11 cigarettes. there has to be more. 03:46:17 12 and the court is going to give you those 03:46:19 13 instructions at the end of the case. 03:46:20 14 mr. byrd: same objection. 03:46:22 15 the court: overruled. 03:46:23 16 ms. parker: i want to take a few minutes and talk 03:46:25 17 to you about the engle findings from the other jury that 03:46:27 18 mr. byrd talked about. those findings do not decide the 03:46:30 19 questions that you have here. 03:46:34 20 just remember that other jury did not hear anything 03:46:35 21 about mrs. graham. they did not hear about her life. they 03:46:37 22 did not hear her name. they did not know what kind of 03:46:41 23 cigarettes she smoked. they did not know about the illness. 03:46:43 24 they did not know anything about her at all. and that other 03:46:46 25 jury did not decide the questions about mrs. graham. and 03:46:49 245 1 those are the questions that are here on the verdict form for 03:46:53 vol 07 pm graham, earl 2 you. 03:46:55 3 that brings us back to the law and the verdict 03:46:56 4 form. two important instructions you are going to get from 03:47:01 5 the court, one is that the plaintiff has the burden of proof. 03:47:05 6 there are two parts to that. burden and proof. 03:47:09 7 they have the burden. i do not have to bring a witness. i 03:47:12 8 do not have to do anything. they have the burden on every one 03:47:16 9 of their claims, and they have to prove -- that is the other 03:47:18 10 part. they have to prove to you every single part of every 03:47:21 11 one of the claims they are making in this case. 03:47:24 12 you are also going to see that there is an 03:47:26 13 instruction that the court will read to you about sympathy, 03:47:30 14 that you should not decide this case based on sympathy or 03:47:36 15 prejudice against any party. it should be decided based on 03:47:42 16 the facts. 03:47:46 17 so if you could pull up those five. 03:47:46 18 those five simple truths will answer every one of 03:47:49 19 the questions on the verdict form. 03:47:54 20 when you review the evidence in the case, you will 03:47:58 21 see that the answer to the first three questions about 03:48:01 22 addiction and what caused her lung cancer, was it addiction 03:48:03 vol 07 pm graham, earl 23 or was it her choice to smoke? and the medical part of the 03:48:08 24 case. those should all be answered no. 03:48:11 25 now, i want to talk about comparative fault very 03:48:17 246 1 briefly. when you get to that -- we say you should not even 03:48:21 2 get to that part of the verdict form, but if you do, a 03:48:26 3 hundred percent of the fault should be the person who made 03:48:30 4 the decisions. who made the decisions in her life about 03:48:33 5 smoking? who made all the decisions about whether to smoke, 03:48:38 6 whether to smoke when there are warnings? a hundred percent 03:48:42 7 of that should be on mrs. graham. 03:48:45 8 now, i'm not blaming mrs. graham by saying that. 03:48:47 9 we did not file this lawsuit. but the person who made those 03:48:50 10 decisions about smoking is the person who has responsibility 03:48:54 11 for those. 03:48:58 12 finally, in addition to damages they are asking 03:48:59 13 for -- damages here, they are asking for $6 million. that is 03:49:07 14 pulled out of thin air. totally pulled out of thin air. and 03:49:10 15 under the law you should consider their relationship in that 03:49:13 16 part of the case. this is a case where no damages should be 03:49:17 17 awarded. 03:49:21 vol 07 pm graham, earl 18 but on top of that, on top of the $6 million, they 03:49:22 19 are asking for punitive damages. they want to come back here 03:49:25 20 for another part of the trial. they want to put on more 03:49:27 21 evidence, and they want to try to ask for more money than 03:49:30 22 that. 03:49:32 23 there is no tie to any of these documents to 03:49:33 24 mrs. graham. your answer to that should be no as well. 03:49:37 25 now, i'm going to conclude now and sit down. and 03:49:40 247 1 mr. geary has a few comments he is going to make to you as 03:49:44 2 well. 03:49:47 3 but just in closing, i want to thank you for 03:49:48 4 listening to me this afternoon. and i want to just remind 03:49:50 5 you that mr. graham said nobody forced her to smoke. you 03:49:54 6 know, the cigarette did not light itself and just jump into 03:49:58 7 her mouth. she is the one who made those decisions. 03:50:01 8 so, again, thank you so much for your attention 03:50:05 9 this afternoon. 03:50:08 10 thank you, your honor. 12 mr. geary: good afternoon. 03:50:13 vol 07 pm graham, earl 13 you are just about finished. you have worked hard. 03:50:18 14 you have listened to the evidence, and we all thank you for 03:50:22 15 that. 03:50:24 16 you have heard the words of ms. parker. i agree 03:50:26 17 with everything that she said. i'm just going to talk to you 03:50:27 18 about some of the evidence and some of the claims. 03:50:31 19 i want to talk to you about question 2, first. 03:50:33 20 we will get that one up there. 03:50:36 21 question 2 involves the question: did the 03:50:38 22 plaintiff prove that mrs. graham's addiction legally caused 03:50:41 23 her death? 03:50:45 24 that is really two questions. did addiction cause 03:50:46 25 her death? and did smoking cause her death? 03:50:48 248 1 i think the answer to that is no for different 03:50:51 2 reasons. and you do not have to agree on what the reason is. 03:50:53 3 some might say it was not proved by reliable 03:50:57 4 evidence her cancer was caused by smoking. that would be 03:50:59 5 like saying dr. feingold was not reliable. or you could say 03:51:03 6 it is more likely her cancer was signet ring cancer. that is 03:51:07 vol 07 pm graham, earl 7 what the pathologist said. or you could say addiction was not 03:51:12 8 a direct cause of her death. not for someone who is as 03:51:16 9 capable and determined as mrs. graham. 03:51:20 10 so there are different ways you can decide that, 03:51:22 11 and the answer is no for any combination of those. 03:51:25 12 let us talk a little bit more about question 2. 03:51:28 13 we will go to the next one, matt. 03:51:30 14 the question here is: did the plaintiff prove 03:51:34 15 addiction directly caused her death? remember what dr. koop 03:51:36 16 said. he said cigarette smoke is addictive. but the 03:51:40 17 individual must decide whether to quit or not. what he is 03:51:44 18 saying there is addiction does not cause disease because each 03:51:47 19 person has a choice. 03:51:51 20 mrs. graham was intelligent, determined, capable. 03:51:53 21 she could have quit. dr. feingold said that. and it is 03:51:58 22 because of that that addiction does not directly cause death. 03:52:01 23 not in this case. and direct -- direct is a part of legal 03:52:04 24 cause. to be a legal cause, it must be direct. so the 03:52:09 25 answer to that question is no. 03:52:12 249 1 question no. 3 relates to brands. and the 03:52:14 vol 07 pm graham, earl 2 question there is whether smoking cigarettes made by that 03:52:19 3 defendant was a legal cause of death. 03:52:24 4 well, here there is no evidence specific to the 03:52:27 5 companies. the plaintiff must prove that philip morris 03:52:31 6 brands caused her death. that is something you cannot guess 03:52:33 7 about. 03:52:36 8 what dr. feingold said was that 15 years of 03:52:37 9 pack-year smoking could cause death. he talked about smoking 03:52:40 10 generally over a 20-year period of time, but he did not talk 03:52:44 11 about philip morris brands. there is only three in this 03:52:46 12 case: benson & hedges, virginia slims, and marlboro. 03:52:49 13 benson & hedges, maybe a few years, maybe less, 03:52:56 14 said barbara. 03:52:58 15 virginia slims, a few cigarettes, said barbara. 03:52:59 16 mr. graham did not quantify it. 03:53:03 17 the same with marlboro. mr. graham did not say how 03:53:04 18 much, and barbara said that she did not even smoke marlboro. 03:53:07 19 so barbara said, no virginia slims, no marlboro. 03:53:10 20 on that basis, the answer to question no. 3 is no, 03:53:15 21 because there is no evidence about that, and you cannot guess 03:53:19 22 about it. 03:53:21 vol 07 pm graham, earl 23 question no. 4, this is the concealment claim. 03:53:23 24 and you heard at the beginning of this case, this case is 03:53:27 25 about concealment. there has got to be reliance. did 03:53:30 250 1 mrs. graham rely on the companies for information about 03:53:34 2 smoking? was she waiting on philip morris to say something? 03:53:37 3 no. 03:53:41 4 you heard it from the witnesses. she did not rely 03:53:41 5 on anything they said. she did not hear statements. she 03:53:43 6 was not waiting on them. there was no reliance. nothing 03:53:46 7 philip morris or reynolds said impacted her. 03:53:49 8 the answer to this question is no, and that 03:53:51 9 applies to reynolds as well. 03:53:53 10 question no. 5: did reliance legally cause her 03:53:54 11 death? well, the issue there is would more information have 03:54:00 12 made a difference, because that is the question. well, you 03:54:04 13 heard the evidence. she knew cigarettes were dangerous. she 03:54:07 14 was familiar with the packs. she heard they were cancer 03:54:10 15 sticks. her family warned her. more information would not 03:54:13 16 have made a difference to mrs. graham. that is why the answer 03:54:16 17 to that is no. 03:54:19 vol 07 pm graham, earl 18 she said cigarettes were cancer sticks. 03:54:20 19 what would have made a difference? 03:54:23 20 the answer to that is no. and the same thing for 03:54:25 21 reynolds. 03:54:29 22 question 6 and 7, conspiracy to conceal. that is 03:54:29 23 like the concealment claim, we just talked about that. they 03:54:32 24 are the same issues. reliance, would more information have 03:54:36 25 made a difference. 03:54:39 251 1 the answer to that question is no, for the same 03:54:39 2 reasons we just talked about. no reliance or more 03:54:42 3 information would have made a difference. 03:54:46 4 again, the same thing for reynolds. the answer is 03:54:48 5 no. 03:54:49 6 no. 8, the percentage of responsibility. if the 03:54:50 7 answer to 1 or 2 is no, you do not get to this question. you 03:54:53 8 do not start balancing if 1 or 2 is no. 03:54:57 9 if you do, ask this question: who could have 03:55:00 10 caused mrs. graham to stop smoking? 03:55:02 11 there is only one person, and that is mrs. graham, 03:55:05 vol 07 pm graham, earl 12 and that is why it is one hundred percent for her. 03:55:07 13 now, let us go to question 10. the punitive 03:55:09 14 damages claim. and the question here is: did the plaintiff 03:55:14 15 prove by evidence that is clear and convincing that punitive 03:55:17 16 damages are warranted against the companies? 03:55:22 17 okay. well, the question here is this: punitive 03:55:25 18 damages award money beyond what is necessary to compensate. 03:55:30 19 the question is, is this a case for that? 03:55:33 20 the punitive damage claim under the instructions 03:55:36 21 is derivative of the concealment claim. the issues are the 03:55:38 22 same. here the evidence must be by clear and convincing 03:55:43 23 evidence. was there reliance? no. would more information 03:55:45 24 have made a difference? no. it is the same analysis. 03:55:49 25 so the answer to this question is no. 03:55:53 252 1 i think that you will see when you look at the 03:55:56 2 evidence, this is not a case for awarding extra damages to the 03:55:58 3 plaintiff. 03:56:03 4 the same analysis applies to reynolds. 03:56:03 5 just about finished. i want to talk to you about 03:56:06 6 cigarette design. you just heard about this. dr. cummings, 03:56:10 vol 07 pm graham, earl 7 their expert, who wanted you to think, and spent a lot of 03:56:14 8 time on this issue, that the companies design cigarettes to 03:56:19 9 make them more addictive. you heard a lot about that, and 03:56:22 10 this is what he said. cigarettes today are not more 03:56:26 11 addictive than they were in the '50s. and that is their 03:56:28 12 witness, dr. cummings. 03:56:31 13 and that answers a lot of issues in this case. 03:56:32 14 now, i'm just about finished. i know that is the 03:56:36 15 case. all right. i'm just about finished. 03:56:40 16 but the plaintiff is going to get one last chance 03:56:45 17 to talk to you. and that is fine, because the plaintiff has 03:56:47 18 the burden of proof. 03:56:50 19 when the plaintiff gets up here and talks to you, 03:56:51 20 i want you to think about the evidence we have talked about. 03:56:53 21 the fact that mrs. graham was a very determined, capable, 03:56:57 22 intelligent person. the fact that she was not motivated to 03:57:02 23 quit. she did not want to. barbara told you that. and who 03:57:05 24 knew her better than her? nobody. that is who. 03:57:09 25 we know that mrs. graham was definitely aware of 03:57:13 253 1 the health risks of smoking. her husband warned her. he 03:57:16 vol 07 pm graham, earl 2 asked her to quit. he quit in 1980, and then he started 03:57:20 3 asking her to quit, and she wanted no part of it. she wanted 03:57:24 4 no part of it. 03:57:28 5 she said, let us light up some of those cancer 03:57:29 6 sticks. 03:57:32 7 i want to say this: i'm not here to criticize her 03:57:33 8 choices. that is not what this is about. but this case is 03:57:36 9 about whether she knew about the health risks of smoking. 03:57:39 10 she knew what was on the warnings. she knew that cigarettes 03:57:42 11 were cancer sticks, and more information would not have made a 03:57:45 12 difference, and that is what this case is all about. 03:57:48 13 the concealment, the conspiracy claim, the 03:57:50 14 punitive damage claim is about that. would more information 03:57:52 15 have made a difference? and the answer is no. 03:57:55 16 when you hear about design, think about what 03:57:58 17 dr. cummings said. because that answers a lot of the 03:58:01 18 questions in this case. 03:58:04 19 now, when they talk to you, i want you to think 03:58:05 20 about this: think about that evidence and think about what 03:58:08 21 ms. parker would say, think about mr. walker's 03:58:11 22 cross-examination of dr. feingold and what you learned from 03:58:14 vol 07 pm graham, earl 23 that. 03:58:18 24 you might think about what i might say about it as 03:58:18 25 well, and look at the court's instructions. 03:58:21 254 1 now, i know it is almost time to finish. under the 03:58:23 2 evidence, the claims are not proof. these facts do not fit 03:58:30 3 the claims, and because of that, the answer to all the 03:58:32 4 questions before you is no. 03:58:35 5 thank you very much.
