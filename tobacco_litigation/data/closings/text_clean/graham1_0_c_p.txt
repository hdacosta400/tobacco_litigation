19 mr. byrd: may it please the court? 02:02:10 20 members of the jury, thank you so much for your 02:02:12 21 time this past week or so. we thank you, my colleague, 02:02:17 22 mr. lantinberg, and myself thank you for your time, and 02:02:22 23 certainly our client, mr. earl graham, thanks you for the 02:02:26 vol 07 pm graham, earl 24 time that you spent in listening to the evidence and hearing 02:02:29 25 the facts in the case. 02:02:32 171 1 when you go back to the room to deliberate, you 02:02:34 2 are essentially going to have three jobs we would submit. 02:02:38 3 you are going to answer questions on a verdict form. you are 02:02:41 4 going to talk amongst each other and try to make sure 02:02:45 5 everybody follows the instructions that the judge gives you. 02:02:48 6 and before you answer, before you -- you are going 02:02:51 7 to get to all talk together and make sure everybody has a 02:02:54 8 chance to explain why they feel the way they feel, and then 02:02:57 9 you are going to come to your conclusions. 02:03:02 10 so for the next 30 or 40 minutes here, i want to 02:03:04 11 try to offer you some ways and some suggestions about how we 02:03:07 12 view the evidence in this case. 02:03:11 13 if you remember when you first came here and were 02:03:12 14 selected by the jury and everybody sat back there, made some 02:03:17 15 commitments. in jury selection, you were asked by the judge 02:03:20 16 and there were questions asked by myself and ms. parker about 02:03:23 17 biases and any biases you had. 02:03:29 vol 07 pm graham, earl 18 and you told this court that you could remove 02:03:31 19 those. and you told this court that things like if it was -- 02:03:34 20 if you thought, well, i just do not believe that plaintiffs 02:03:38 21 should be able to sue for things like this, for somebody 02:03:41 22 that is something they chose to do. i just do not believe in 02:03:44 23 that. or i do not believe giving money to somebody that chose 02:03:47 24 to smoke tobacco and then sue the companies who did that. 02:03:50 25 everybody answered those questions, and said those kind of 02:03:54 172 1 biases and feelings you did not have and were not going to 02:03:57 2 come into play in this courtroom. 02:03:59 3 so we would ask -- thank you for that commitment 02:04:02 4 and make sure in the jury deliberation room that everybody 02:04:04 5 just focuses on the facts and the evidence that came in. and 02:04:07 6 if there are any of the outside biases or reasons, that those 02:04:10 7 are not reasons. because you have explained to the court that 02:04:13 8 you did not have those kind of biases. those would not come 02:04:16 9 into your deliberations. 02:04:19 10 you may wonder from time to time about evidence 02:04:20 11 you did not hear about, things that we are not able to tell 02:04:23 12 you. and the court has rules about that. there are rules of 02:04:25 vol 07 pm graham, earl 13 what kind of evidence both ms. parker and myself can give you 02:04:28 14 and tell you about. 02:04:31 15 and you do not need to wonder about things you 02:04:32 16 did not hear, because that -- or make up ideas or guess about 02:04:35 17 why you did not hear about things like that. just consider 02:04:39 18 the evidence, and then we will appreciate all the service 02:04:41 19 that you have given us to give us our shake here. 02:04:45 20 now, when we started, mr. lantinberg explained in 02:04:48 21 his opening statement about why we are here and why we were 02:04:51 22 suing the cigarette company, and he mentioned a few reasons 02:04:55 23 why we are suing the cigarette companies. 02:04:58 24 one is that we were suing the cigarette companies 02:04:59 25 because we submit that they violated basic safety concepts 02:05:02 173 1 that a company can never lie about a danger it knows about in 02:05:07 2 a product. 02:05:12 3 now, you heard some of the men in the video from 02:05:13 4 the very cigarette companies. you heard mr. colby. he had 02:05:17 5 the transcript underneath him. he was hard to understand. 02:05:22 6 he said the cigarette company has a duty to be truthful and 02:05:27 7 not to mislead. 02:05:30 vol 07 pm graham, earl 8 mr. heimann, one of the first videos you saw. 02:05:32 9 remember, he was the guy who got up there and said, you know, 02:05:35 10 he disagreed with every medical public authority, all these 02:05:38 11 medical groups, american medical association, anybody who 02:05:43 12 said cigarettes were injurious. he just did not believe it. 02:05:45 13 they were all wrong. they are all dead wrong. and he said 02:05:48 14 that our advertising is truthful. and we expect people to 02:05:51 15 rely on it. 02:05:56 16 now, that is one reason we are coming in here. 02:05:57 17 another reason is that the cigarette companies 02:06:01 18 violated another rule that we believe, a safety concept, if 02:06:04 19 you will, about not lying about the dangers that it knows 02:06:07 20 about. 02:06:10 21 so the cigarette companies, we submit, lied about 02:06:12 22 the fact that cigarettes cause cancer. they lied about that 02:06:17 23 cigarettes are addictive. the cigarette companies lied about 02:06:22 24 the fact that filters, things like filters, were somehow 02:06:25 25 safer. the cigarette companies lied about the fact that 02:06:28 174 1 light cigarettes or low-tar cigarettes were somehow safer. 02:06:32 vol 07 pm graham, earl 2 not only did they mislead the public at large, they misled 02:06:36 3 the public health authorities about that. 02:06:39 4 and the cigarette companies lied about the fact 02:06:42 5 that, you know, low-nicotine products were somehow any less 02:06:45 6 addictive than the regular cigarettes that they made. 02:06:49 7 the proof of this comes in straight from their own 02:06:53 8 records, their own business records. and we are going to 02:06:55 9 talk about the timeline in a minute. 02:06:57 10 but about when those business records came out, i 02:07:00 11 will say this: when those business records came out -- and 02:07:02 12 you heard dr. gentry from r.j. reynolds say they came out in 02:07:06 13 1998, formerly unknown, formerly not obtained. no one could 02:07:10 14 get them, because they were internal. many of them stamped 02:07:18 15 confidential you saw. no one was able to get them. 02:07:18 16 it changed the landscape of what people knew about 02:07:20 17 the cigarette industry and understood about what they had 02:07:23 18 been doing for so long. and we are going to talk about that. 02:07:28 19 but that is a pivotal moment in the late '90s when the truth 02:07:30 20 finally comes out. 02:07:35 21 now, another reason we sued, we mentioned, is the 02:07:36 22 cigarette companies violated this concept that a manufacturer 02:07:40 vol 07 pm graham, earl 23 should never hide a danger it knows about in its product. 02:07:42 24 and the cigarette companies, we will show you, as we showed 02:07:47 25 on the timeline, studies addiction for a long time. and, 02:07:50 175 1 remember, they did not even admit that cigarettes were 02:07:56 2 addictive until 1999. and we will talk about what they say 02:07:58 3 about addiction now. dr. gentry and jupe. they will not admit 02:08:01 4 addiction causes disease now, but they did not even admit 02:08:05 5 cigarettes were addictive until 1999. 02:08:08 6 yet, their own documents show back in the 1960s, 02:08:11 7 they started mastering the concept, the ability to rig and 02:08:17 8 engineer this product into a nicotine delivery system that 02:08:21 9 was designed to addict, designed to keep people from being 02:08:25 10 able to stop. and they even know -- this whole time they 02:08:29 11 know most of our customers would rather quit. most of 02:08:33 12 them -- in their own documents, they say that. most of them 02:08:37 13 wish they could quit. now, that does not sound like free 02:08:40 14 choice to me. 02:08:45 15 if there is a product that you want to stop buying 02:08:46 16 and you have to go start getting safety aids and drugs and 02:08:50 17 things to stop being able to buy -- let us say you want to buy 02:08:54 vol 07 pm graham, earl 18 a red car instead a blue car. that is a choice. nothing 02:08:58 19 stopping you from doing that. 02:09:02 20 most of their customers wanted to quit, and they 02:09:03 21 knew it, and they could not. 02:09:05 22 we are going to hear arguments from the cigarette 02:09:07 23 companies that this is about free choice. 02:09:10 24 so i would ask you, as we go forward, to have this 02:09:11 25 concept of what kind of choice are we talking about as we go 02:09:15 176 1 forward in this case. 02:09:20 2 now, the final reason we had to sue was because 02:09:23 3 the cigarette companies have not provided any full and fair 02:09:26 4 compensation. 02:09:29 5 ms. parker: objection, your honor. 02:09:30 6 the court: sustained. 02:09:31 7 mr. byrd: we are here in order to receive full 02:09:32 8 and fair compensation for mr. graham. 02:09:34 9 now, i want to talk a little bit about the jury 02:09:37 10 instructions. 02:09:42 11 i've asked -- mr. lantinberg is going to go over 02:09:42 12 to the elmo with these to the extent we need to show a few. 02:09:45 vol 07 pm graham, earl 13 i want to show you a little bit about the jury 02:09:49 14 instructions that the judge is going to read to you. you will 02:09:51 15 have them back in the jury room. and i believe everybody 02:09:54 16 will have their own copy so they can look at the jury 02:09:56 17 instructions themselves. 02:10:00 18 i want to point out a few things. the first thing 02:10:00 19 i want to point out is actually on the first page. it talks 02:10:02 20 about what kind of evidence you can consider, at the bottom. 02:10:05 21 and if you will see down in the bottom, it says, 02:10:09 22 in your deliberations, you should consider only the evidence. 02:10:13 23 and that is what we have talked about. 02:10:16 24 and it goes on to say, but as you consider the 02:10:17 25 evidence, both direct and circumstantial, you may make 02:10:19 177 1 deductions and reach conclusions which reason and common 02:10:23 2 sense lead you to make. 02:10:28 3 i want to point that out. because the judge will 02:10:30 4 instruct you about what we have to prove just if you want 02:10:33 5 to -- just more than fifty percent, more likely right than 02:10:37 6 wrong. this is not some beyond a reasonable doubt where we 02:10:41 vol 07 pm graham, earl 7 have removed every question. 02:10:43 8 he will explain to you what we have to prove. and 02:10:44 9 you can use your common sense. 02:10:46 10 i'm not talking about the kind of common sense 02:10:48 11 that we heard from the philip morris executives at the end of 02:10:50 12 the case: apple sauce can kill you. i know that sounds 02:10:53 13 "logical." 02:10:58 14 i'm talking about common sense from the evidence 02:10:59 15 that you see in the documents that we will submit to you -- 02:11:01 16 you will have back there, and we would submit that you should 02:11:05 17 read. 02:11:08 18 i will point out some of the ones that we suggest 02:11:08 19 you really focus on and read. i'm talking about that kind of 02:11:11 20 common sense. 02:11:15 21 and then the judge will go on to tell you about 02:11:15 22 direct evidence. direct evidence is the testimony of one who 02:11:17 23 asserts actual knowledge of a fact such as an eyewitness. 02:11:21 24 but there is also circumstantial evidence, which 02:11:24 25 is proof of a chain of facts and circumstances tending to 02:11:27 178 1 prove or disprove any fact in dispute. 02:11:32 vol 07 pm graham, earl 2 and the next line is what is extremely important. 02:11:35 3 the law makes no distinction between the weight you may give 02:11:38 4 to either direct or circumstantial evidence. you give them 02:11:42 5 the same weight. circumstantial evidence can be used just 02:11:45 6 like the direct evidence can be used. 02:11:49 7 we would submit as an example the cigarette 02:11:51 8 companies touting lights and low tars everywhere become one 02:11:57 9 of the highest selling products. they are advertising it all 02:12:00 10 over the place. lo and behold around the same time, 02:12:04 11 mrs. graham starts to smoke light and low-tar cigarettes. do 02:12:08 12 we have direct evidence that she saw an advertisement and 02:12:12 13 relied on it? i think so. but it is kind of tough. 02:12:14 14 mrs. graham has died. she is not here. she was 02:12:19 15 not able to be interviewed. we cannot tell you what was in 02:12:23 16 her mind because this case came about after that. 02:12:28 17 so you can use circumstantial evidence she started 02:12:32 18 smoking lights and low tars while they are making all these 02:12:36 19 health claims while she is wanting to quit and infer that 02:12:38 20 indeed she did rely on the things that the cigarette 02:12:43 21 companies did to push that. 02:12:46 22 i would ask you to consider that as you go forward 02:12:49 vol 07 pm graham, earl 23 and look at the facts in the case. 02:12:50 24 now, the next instruction talks about -- 02:12:53 25 instruction no. 5, page 7, talks about what we have to prove. 02:13:02 179 1 the preponderance of the evidence. you have heard this a 02:13:06 2 little bit. this is not a criminal case. this is what you 02:13:08 3 have to prove in a civil case such as this. 02:13:10 4 preponderance of the evidence simply means an 02:13:12 5 amount of evidence that is enough to persuade you that 02:13:17 6 mr. graham's claim is more likely true than not true. more 02:13:21 7 likely true than not. 02:13:25 8 in deciding whether -- well, that is where we come 02:13:27 9 up with this concept. we do not have to go a hundred percent 02:13:33 10 of the way. imagine a football field. you get to the 02:13:35 11 50-yard line, you get just an inch over the 50-yard line, we 02:13:39 12 have proved our claim. and we do not have to go all the way 02:13:43 13 to the 100-yard line, the goal line. we get right over the 02:13:46 14 50-yard line and we have proved our claim. we are more 02:13:51 15 likely true than not, with common sense. 02:13:53 16 so if in deliberations someone says, you know, i 02:13:56 17 have some doubts. i have some doubts. i heard about this -- 02:14:02 vol 07 pm graham, earl 18 well, they mentioned breast cancer. i have a doubt. 02:14:05 19 well, remind them, we have to look at the evidence 02:14:08 20 and say what was more likely right than not and remind them 02:14:10 21 that we do not have to prove all doubt. we do not have to 02:14:14 22 remove all doubt, because the judge will instruct you that we 02:14:17 23 do not have to remove every piece of doubt. we just have to 02:14:20 24 prove by a preponderance of the evidence. 02:14:24 25 so let us look at the verdict form. before we do, 02:14:26 180 1 if i may, i would submit the -- basically two avenues, two 02:14:29 2 routes of things to consider in the verdict form. i want to 02:14:35 3 draw this right up here. 02:14:38 4 the first question you are going to be asked -- 02:14:40 5 and we will look at it in a second, and i think the judge 02:14:43 6 will show you it -- is whether faye graham was addicted. 02:14:46 7 that is the first question you will be asked. 02:14:52 8 the next question will be whether addiction caused 02:14:55 9 the disease. 02:14:59 10 we submit this is lung cancer. addiction caused 02:15:03 11 lung cancer and her death. 02:15:07 vol 07 pm graham, earl 12 okay. and then the final piece of that whole 02:15:10 13 puzzle down that avenue, you will be asked to decide what is 02:15:15 14 called comparative fault. the fault of all the parties. 02:15:18 15 come in with -- you know, imagine everybody has shared 02:15:22 16 responsibility. we are going to look at this and we are 02:15:24 17 going to see who has what amount of fault. we will call that 02:15:26 18 comparative fault. 02:15:31 19 so i will talk more about this later, this concept 02:15:34 20 later. 02:15:39 21 but i'm going to address the addicted and the 02:15:39 22 addiction causing lung cancer first. 02:15:42 23 my next half of what i would like to talk about is 02:15:45 24 the other avenue that you are going to have to deal with on 02:15:47 25 the verdict form, which are what we call the intentional tort 02:15:50 181 1 claims. concealment, we will call it for short. 02:15:53 2 we claim that the defendants concealed and omitted 02:15:56 3 material facts. the engle findings have something to say 02:15:59 4 about all those. and i will point to those in a second. 02:16:03 5 the next claim will be conspiracy, that the 02:16:06 6 defendants engaged in an agreement together. we submit 02:16:11 vol 07 pm graham, earl 7 starting at the plaza hotel in 1953, which continued all the 02:16:14 8 way until faye graham died and beyond. 02:16:19 9 and then if you answer yes to those two questions, 02:16:22 10 we will address punitive damages. 02:16:31 11 we suggest that where the rubber really meets the 02:16:32 12 road in this case is punitive damages. and this is a case 02:16:37 13 about punitive damages. there is no competent evidence 02:16:39 14 anywhere that came into this courtroom to question this side 02:16:45 15 right here of the verdict form. 02:16:49 16 let us start with that. 02:16:50 17 show the first question on the verdict form. 02:16:53 18 let us do that. 02:17:03 19 the very first question on the verdict form will 02:17:04 20 say, was faye graham addicted to cigarettes containing 02:17:07 21 nicotine? okay. 02:17:10 22 so, remember, we have to prove this more likely 02:17:12 23 right than wrong. i think we would submit there is no 02:17:14 24 question about this. 02:17:17 25 what did you hear in the case? dr. feingold came 02:17:18 182 1 in and he concluded, you know, without any doubt at all that 02:17:21 vol 07 pm graham, earl 2 faye graham was addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine. 02:17:26 3 you heard from dr. cummings as well as 02:17:29 4 dr. feingold how nicotine works on the brain. 02:17:32 5 they have spent decades studying this and 02:17:35 6 researching this field. 02:17:38 7 dr. cummings has published countless articles in 02:17:40 8 the surgeon general -- he is edited surgeon general reports. 02:17:44 9 he has done peer-reviewed articles on this topic. he 02:17:48 10 helps -- actually helps addicted smokers try to quit smoking. 02:17:51 11 by the way, we happen to know faye graham was not 02:17:55 12 unlike other customers of the cigarette companies. she was 02:18:01 13 just like most of them. she wanted to quit and could not. 02:18:04 14 smoked until the day she died. after her lung cancer, 02:18:07 15 receiving radiation and chemotherapy treatment, continued to 02:18:14 16 smoke. 02:18:17 17 now, you have heard evidence about the definition of 02:18:19 18 addiction. addiction, as you heard from the experts in this 02:18:21 19 case, chronic relapsing brain disease, compulsive use despite 02:18:26 20 harmful consequences. that is the rough definition. this is 02:18:33 21 a chronic relapsing brain disease, compulsive use despite 02:18:36 22 harmful consequences. 02:18:41 vol 07 pm graham, earl 23 dr. feingold explained how cigarettes pass through 02:18:43 24 the blood brain barrier, okay, which we are all born with, 02:18:46 25 all created with. nicotine can get past that and make 02:18:50 183 1 changes to your actual brain structures and grow these 02:18:55 2 nicotine receptors, multiple of them in this thing called 02:18:59 3 up-regulation, as dr. cummings talked about. 02:19:03 4 nicotine receptors multiplying in the brain. 02:19:07 5 dr. feingold explained in great deal about how 02:19:10 6 nicotine gets from the lung within a matter of seconds up to 02:19:12 7 the brain and how the nicotine receptors start craving this 02:19:16 8 nicotine and demand more and more. 02:19:21 9 and then he told you how he concluded more likely 02:19:22 10 right than wrong that faye graham was addicted. he read -- 02:19:26 11 he did not need to read all the depositions in this case. 02:19:29 12 by the way, we will talk about the witnesses in 02:19:32 13 this case. the defendants did not bring one witness into 02:19:35 14 this courtroom. these family witnesses that they mentioned 02:19:38 15 to dr. feingold, did not bring one witness into this courtroom 02:19:42 16 to deny any fact at all that went to addiction and whether 02:19:45 vol 07 pm graham, earl 17 she was addicted. how much she smoked first thing in the 02:19:49 18 morning. did not bring one witness to contradict that in 02:19:52 19 this case, now, despite she smoked one to two packs a day for 02:19:58 20 more than 40 years. you heard mr. herrin talk about she 02:20:03 21 started smoking, i saw it, when she was in her mid-teenage 02:20:06 22 years. he was clear about that. 02:20:10 23 lo and behold, she had also told him, i started 02:20:11 24 smoking when i was 16. 02:20:15 25 and so she is not here, but we think the evidence 02:20:17 184 1 shows she started way back in 1951 when she was 16 years old. 02:20:21 2 smoked for roughly 40-some-odd years. 02:20:28 3 dr. feingold talked about how that means she is had 02:20:32 4 5.5 million puffs of nicotine, self-administered doses of 02:20:36 5 nicotine, to the brain. and every time she puffed in, every 02:20:43 6 single time, 5.5 million carcinogens flowing through to the 02:20:47 7 lungs. 02:20:54 8 you heard this compulsive use despite knowing 02:20:54 9 harmful consequences. faye graham tried all sorts of ways to 02:21:01 10 quit. she tried chewing gum. she tried hypnosis. spent a 02:21:05 11 lot of money for that family for a few days of actual 02:21:10 vol 07 pm graham, earl 12 earnings to go try hypnosis, and it did not work long at all, 02:21:14 13 but she tried over and over. she wanted to quit. her 02:21:18 14 husband asked her to quit. 02:21:21 15 of course, she knew that there were some harmful 02:21:23 16 consequences to smoking. she was desperate to quit. we are 02:21:26 17 not here to tell you she had no clue these things were bad 02:21:31 18 for her at all. i do not think she understood the full extent 02:21:35 19 of it. i do not think she understood the full extent of it 02:21:38 20 until much later, but, of course, eventually by the '70s or 02:21:41 21 '80s, she is trying to quit. she did not want to be smoking. 02:21:45 22 finally, dr. feingold said she smoked first thing 02:21:48 23 in the morning. that is one of the biggest signs, because 02:21:53 24 your nicotine receptors are empty and they are screaming 02:21:56 25 first thing in the morning. 02:21:58 185 1 and you heard earl graham testify, who was 02:22:00 2 actually in the same bedroom with her overnight. you heard 02:22:02 3 earl graham testify that that would be the first thing when 02:22:05 4 her feet hit the floor; when her feet hit the floor, she 02:22:09 5 would start smoking. last thing she did when she went to bed 02:22:11 6 at night. every time he saw her, she had a cigarette in her 02:22:15 vol 07 pm graham, earl 7 hand from the first time he met her. 02:22:18 8 this is the picture of addiction. this is not 02:22:20 9 smoking just because you like it. 02:22:25 10 and you can read in the 2010 surgeon general's 02:22:27 11 report. it is exhibit 237. we submit this is an exhibit 02:22:32 12 worth perusing. you will actually have your own copy of it 02:22:36 13 back there. 02:22:39 14 it looks like this. 02:22:40 15 there are a couple of chapters worth perusing. 02:22:43 16 exhibit 237. talking about the changing design of the 02:22:46 17 cigarette and what that did and talking about nicotine 02:22:50 18 addiction. we have heard it all -- the end of yesterday and 02:22:52 19 today, nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason. 02:22:55 20 no, maybe it is a. i do not know. 02:22:58 21 nicotine is the fundamental reason people smoke 02:23:00 22 and leads to disease. and that is what the surgeon general 02:23:04 23 report says. 02:23:07 24 and if this addiction concept is so unbelievable 02:23:08 25 and so remarkable that mrs. graham could not be addicted -- 02:23:18 186 vol 07 pm graham, earl 1 you know, we believe generally that somebody could be 02:23:23 2 addicted, but it is not mrs. graham. not mrs. graham in this 02:23:26 3 case. 02:23:30 4 if not that many people are addicted out there, 02:23:31 5 then why -- why did the cigarette companies have in 1985, 02:23:33 6 1984 and '85, why were they so concerned about nicorette gum 02:23:41 7 coming out? if it is such a free choice, and if you can just 02:23:46 8 lay them down, then why do they need to be concerned about 02:23:50 9 nicorette gum hitting the market and hitting their customers? 02:23:55 10 by the way, what about the free choice to use 02:24:00 11 nicorette gum? is that free choice to stop that from getting 02:24:04 12 to the market or trying to stop it from getting to the 02:24:07 13 market? you can make it, but do not advertise it to our 02:24:10 14 customers. 02:24:14 15 and you saw those documents. those are internal 02:24:14 16 records that had never come out before. you are somebody -- 02:24:16 17 the few people who have seen this. you can go onto a website 02:24:20 18 now, database, and find all these documents. you do not do 02:24:25 19 that while you are deliberating, but down the road anybody 02:24:29 20 can do that. 02:24:31 21 but nobody knew about this until these documents 02:24:32 vol 07 pm graham, earl 22 came out that this is the kind of behavior they were doing. 02:24:37 23 and they still denied cigarettes were addictive in 1984 when 02:24:39 24 they were telling dow chemicals, no, no, no, we are going to 02:24:43 25 stop dealing with you if you start doing this nicorette gum 02:24:47 187 1 thing. 02:24:50 2 now, is it more likely right than wrong that faye 02:24:51 3 graham was addicted? yes. you heard no evidence to say 02:24:56 4 otherwise. earl graham testified. charles herrin testified. 02:25:00 5 barbara beaty testified about seeing her smoke. 02:25:04 6 we will talk about barbara in a minute, because 02:25:06 7 she had a couple of other things to say. 02:25:08 8 let us go on to the next question. question 2 will 02:25:15 9 be: was faye graham's addiction to cigarettes containing 02:25:20 10 nicotine a legal cause of her death? 02:25:23 11 now, you are going to have an instruction about 02:25:25 12 legal cause. and it is no. 9. i believe there is an 02:25:33 13 instruction on addiction being the cause. 02:25:55 14 no. 7. page 9. page 9 at the bottom. in order 02:26:04 15 to prove that addiction to smoking cigarettes containing 02:26:28 16 nicotine was a legal cause of mrs. graham's death, mr. graham 02:26:31 vol 07 pm graham, earl 17 must prove that such addiction directly and in natural and 02:26:35 18 continuous sequence produced or contributed substantially to 02:26:39 19 producing such death so it can be reasonably said but for the 02:26:43 20 addiction, the death would not have occurred. in order to be 02:26:47 21 regarded as a legal cause of death, addiction need not be the 02:26:50 22 only cause. addiction may be a legal cause of death even 02:26:53 23 though it operates in combination with the act of another, 02:26:57 24 some natural cause, or some other cause if the addiction 02:27:00 25 contributes substantially to producing such death. 02:27:04 188 1 so there you have it. addiction need not be the 02:27:09 2 only cause. it just needs to be a cause that substantially 02:27:13 3 contributed to causing her death. 02:27:16 4 and how did it cause her death? you heard from 02:27:17 5 dr. feingold. we are created in an amazing way. the blood 02:27:21 6 brain barrier, it is supposed to keep chemicals out. except 02:27:28 7 it does not work on nicotine. nicotine gets through. 02:27:30 8 our lungs -- you heard him explain the lungs -- 02:27:32 9 have these bronchial tubes that come out and they are filled 02:27:35 10 with all this blood, all these vessels, going everywhere, and 02:27:38 11 these bronchial trees develop. and if you were to take the 02:27:42 vol 07 pm graham, earl 12 leaves of these trees -- this is where air hits in the lung 02:27:48 13 and you breathe in -- take the leaves of these trees and 02:27:51 14 spread them out, it would be as large as a tennis court. we 02:27:55 15 have things inside us that are as large as a tennis court for 02:27:58 16 breathing. we are made in an amazing way. 02:28:02 17 and dr. feingold talked about how cigarettes come 02:28:03 18 in and are designed to defeat the very way we are made to 02:28:07 19 deflect things like this that happen to us. 02:28:13 20 what happens is we have cilia in the lungs that 02:28:15 21 operate to try to remove chemicals and toxins that come in 02:28:19 22 and pushes it up and out and gets rid of it. until you smoke 02:28:23 23 cigarettes -- and the cigarettes, what do they do? they 02:28:27 24 bring in carcinogens that freeze the cilia. your cilia cannot 02:28:31 25 do that action that it normally does, which is designed to 02:28:36 189 1 do, and is completely defeated. 02:28:39 2 and dr. feingold explained how repeated exposure 02:28:41 3 to cigarettes, over and over and over, is what leads to the 02:28:43 4 cancer and what leads to the cells being in such a way to set 02:28:49 5 the stage for mutation to occur where cancer develops, and 02:28:55 vol 07 pm graham, earl 6 then because of all the blood vessels in there, it breaks up. 02:28:58 7 it breaks off into the bloodstream and moves on into other 02:29:04 8 organs of the body, including the brain. and that is what she 02:29:09 9 had. 02:29:12 10 now, the defendants will talk about, oh, this lung 02:29:14 11 cancer came from somewhere else. dr. feingold came in here. 02:29:17 12 and they did not bring you one person. they had a lot to say 02:29:20 13 about dr. feingold. they do not like him. he makes money. 02:29:23 14 have a lot to criticize him about. and if there was anybody 02:29:26 15 on the defense side who had tested these slides like 02:29:30 16 dr. feingold, and who had looked at the slides like 02:29:34 17 dr. feingold, who could come in here and actually show you 02:29:38 18 with science this was not lung cancer, trust me, you would 02:29:40 19 have heard it. and you did not. 02:29:43 20 dr. feingold came in here and he explained, he 02:29:46 21 went through the medical records in detail that this is 02:29:49 22 adenocarcinoma. 02:29:52 23 what happened? what happened? they looked at 02:29:53 24 this. they took a biopsy. and, yes, there are different 02:29:57 25 options of where this could come from. and what is one of 02:30:01 190 vol 07 pm graham, earl 1 the first things they do? a mammogram, an x-ray of the 02:30:03 2 breast, and see no cancer whatsoever. 02:30:07 3 they even go as far as to do a female -- a doctor 02:30:09 4 comes in and does an actual physical test of the breasts. no 02:30:12 5 cancer. 02:30:16 6 he said if this had been breast cancer, this would 02:30:16 7 have gone -- this would have gone -- would not have spread to 02:30:18 8 the brain like that. he said there is no question this was 02:30:22 9 lung cancer. look at the medical records. 02:30:24 10 the medical records will be in evidence. they are 02:30:26 11 exhibit 1362 from plaintiffs. look through them. we showed 02:30:29 12 you all of them. 02:30:33 13 defendants, their exhibit, they are going to have 02:30:35 14 a medical record exhibit, too. i do not know what number it 02:30:38 15 is. it has two pages. because they do not want you to see 02:30:41 16 all the medical records. 02:30:43 17 look at our medical records. it has all of them 02:30:44 18 in there. 02:30:47 19 and then look at exhibit 1365. those are the 02:30:47 20 photomicrographs that dr. feingold showed you. and he showed 02:30:51 21 you what he saw. lung cancer. and then he went a step 02:30:53 vol 07 pm graham, earl 22 further. you know, we just have to go to the 50-yard line on 02:30:56 23 the football field. he went all the way to the goal line. 02:30:59 24 he took a ttf-1 test, okay. and nothing was 02:31:02 25 stopping defendants from doing these same tests. defendants 02:31:07 191 1 had every opportunity to have -- they had everything 02:31:11 2 available to them that we did. 02:31:13 3 and he went and did this test. and after the 02:31:15 4 ttf-1, he says, it confirms exactly what all the treating 02:31:19 5 doctors say. ttf-1, 99 percent sure this is lung cancer, not 02:31:23 6 from somewhere else, not from gi tract, not from 02:31:27 7 reproductive, lung cancer. 02:31:30 8 then he goes a step further. crosses the goal 02:31:32 9 line. takes a napsin a test to completely remove any doubt. 02:31:34 10 says we are done. sat down and said we are done, a hundred 02:31:38 11 percent conclusive. 02:31:42 12 they have done nothing to bring that back from the 02:31:43 13 goal line to the 50-yard line, much less the other way. this 02:31:45 14 is lung cancer. 02:31:48 15 the death certificate, exhibit 1351. 02:31:49 16 edward, bring that up, please. 02:31:52 vol 07 pm graham, earl 17 the death certificate says, non-small cell lung 02:31:55 18 cancer with brain metastasis. exactly what dr. feingold saw. 02:32:07 19 exactly what she had. and after all the tests, the doctors 02:32:11 20 all agreed. 02:32:14 21 now, the next question you are going to face on 02:32:15 22 the jury instruction form is whether smoking cigarettes of 02:32:17 23 philip morris and r.j. reynolds were the legal cause. 02:32:20 24 well, okay, that is obvious. 02:32:23 25 we read you the stipulations. all the brands you 02:32:24 192 1 heard about, from charles herrin, from barbara beaty, who 02:32:27 2 listed some brands as well, and from earl graham, all of 02:32:31 3 these brands are philip morris and r.j. reynolds. 02:32:37 4 and dr. feingold -- you remember it was that 02:32:39 5 question i asked him. and i had to ask him three times. 02:32:41 6 there were about a hundred objections. and i said, you know, 02:32:44 7 if she had just smoked the brands from when earl knew her, 02:32:46 8 1974 on, would just those brands of cigarettes she smoked 02:32:50 9 during that time, was that enough to substantially contribute 02:32:54 10 to the disease? 02:32:57 vol 07 pm graham, earl 11 he said, yes, absolutely. 02:32:58 12 why? because it is the repeated exposures over 02:32:59 13 time. 14 but even barbara beaty talked about philip morris 02:33:01 15 and r.j. reynolds cigarettes before then. 02:33:04 16 question 3 is a no-brainer. we would submit 02:33:06 17 question, 1, 2, and 3 are no-brainers. she was addicted. 02:33:09 18 the addiction caused the disease. and smoking their 02:33:12 19 cigarettes -- it was smoking these defendants' cigarettes 02:33:16 20 that created the diseases. 02:33:20 21 now, once that happens, a very important thing 02:33:22 22 happened. 02:33:24 23 turn to page 12 of the jury instructions. 11. 02:33:24 24 i'm sorry. page 11 of the jury instructions. 02:33:28 25 well, i'm sorry, after you answered question 1 and 02:33:31 193 1 2, was she addicted and addiction caused the disease, these 02:33:34 2 findings, the engle findings, apply. so before you answer 02:33:37 3 question 3, these findings apply. 02:33:40 4 smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer including 02:33:43 5 adenocarcinoma. that nicotine in cigarettes is addictive. 02:33:45 vol 07 pm graham, earl 6 it goes on. 02:33:49 7 but the next topic i want to talk about is that 02:33:50 8 the engle defendants concealed or omitted material 02:33:52 9 information not otherwise known or available. i highlight 02:33:56 10 that. not otherwise known or available. knowing that the 02:34:00 11 material was false or misleading or failed to disclose a 02:34:02 12 material fact concerning the health effects or addictive 02:34:06 13 nature of smoking cigarettes or both. 02:34:08 14 the next finding says that they agreed to conceal. 02:34:10 15 these are findings that had been made. the judge will 02:34:13 16 instruct you you cannot question them. you have to accept 02:34:16 17 them. and after you have answered the first two questions in 02:34:18 18 the affirmative, they apply. 02:34:22 19 so any other decision you make, you need to go 02:34:23 20 back and read these findings and say, we have to accept 02:34:25 21 these. these are the law. this is what it is. 02:34:28 22 now, we would submit -- let us go to the timeline. 02:34:31 23 this is when you go to the timeline. you are on the next 02:34:36 24 group now. concealment and conspiracy. 02:34:39 25 and we built this timeline here for you to see. 02:34:41 194 vol 07 pm graham, earl 1 we did not have all the 60 million pages of documents that 02:34:44 2 dr. cummings talked about. we could not show you all of them. 02:34:48 3 we had time limits in this case. 02:34:51 4 but he said, many times, there is a lot of 02:34:53 5 examples of this type of document or that type of document. 02:34:55 6 there are tons of these documents. we could only show you a 02:34:57 7 few. 02:35:00 8 but the conspiracy started back here at the plaza 02:35:01 9 hotel where they agreed to create these entities, the tobacco 02:35:05 10 industry research committee and the tirc, to lie about 02:35:10 11 whether cigarettes cause cancer. oh, it is not true. the 02:35:11 12 science is not there. you heard from the philip morris 02:35:17 13 executive from the last video. science is not there. it is 02:35:19 14 not true. it went on all the way to when faye graham died. 02:35:22 15 and you can see these exhibits, you know, 02:35:26 16 exhibit 166. in 1961, the cigarette scientists -- this is 02:35:29 17 the document that they say there is these carcinogens and we 02:35:34 18 cannot remove them. we cannot get them out. 02:35:38 19 you heard dr. gentry and dr. jupe say we are 02:35:41 20 trying -- it is not addiction. it is the carcinogens in the 02:35:43 21 cigarette we are trying to get rid of. but they knew back 02:35:47 vol 07 pm graham, earl 22 then they cannot remove them. it is impossible. dr. jupe said 02:35:50 23 it is impossible. they knew it in 1961. but what they will not 02:35:54 24 work on is addiction. 02:35:58 25 you go on. they started selling doubt as our 02:35:59 195 1 product. they said it in their own internal documents, and 02:36:03 2 they continue. 02:36:06 3 now, what did they do about making their product 02:36:06 4 addictive? first, they lied about whether it causes disease 02:36:10 5 and is injurious. what do they do about making their product 02:36:13 6 addictive? all these. exhibit -- 1962, exhibit 77. we now 02:36:16 7 possess a knowledge about how to -- about nicotine addiction 02:36:24 8 and how it works. 02:36:27 9 and by 1982 -- i'm sorry, 1982, they have this 02:36:29 10 document where they talk about we can improve our share of 02:36:37 11 the market by targeting our products to the crucial entry and 02:36:41 12 exit groups. exit groups, addicted people trying to quit. 02:36:45 13 nicorette gum coming out. these are the exit groups they are 02:36:49 14 worried about. this is exhibit 72. we would submit that is a 02:36:53 15 document worth reading. 02:36:56 16 and then finally, exhibit 210, in 1984, because 02:36:58 vol 07 pm graham, earl 17 you are going to be asked this question in the concealment 02:37:03 18 conspiracy claims: did she rely on things that happened 02:37:06 19 after 1982? of course she did. the whole conspiracy started 02:37:09 20 way back here and continued way past 1982. 02:37:14 21 in 1984 -- can we bring up that document? 02:37:17 22 in 1984 -- okay. if you can bring that up a 02:37:36 23 little bit bigger. 02:37:40 24 this document is a study that is being done 02:37:41 25 internally in the cigarette industry, confidential, not out 02:37:47 196 1 there, where they are discussing all the ways they can 02:37:52 2 manipulate and control the design of the cigarette. control 02:37:56 3 the nicotine delivery to keep people addicted. 02:37:59 4 and by the time you get to '84, they are laughing 02:38:02 5 at their customers. they are laughing at their customers. 02:38:06 6 they are poetic about it. a cigarette is the perfect type of 02:38:11 7 perfect pleasure. it is exquisite and leaves one 02:38:16 8 unsatisfied. what more can one want. they quote. 02:38:20 9 and then it goes on to say, let us provide the 02:38:23 10 exquisiteness and hope that they, our customers, continue to 02:38:27 vol 07 pm graham, earl 11 remain unsatisfied. 02:38:30 12 well, they know they will because many of them are 02:38:33 13 addicted. 02:38:36 14 all we would want then is a larger bag to carry 02:38:37 15 the money to the bank. 02:38:41 16 okay. at the same time, 400,000 body bags -- 02:38:42 17 ms. parker: objection. argument. 02:38:49 18 the court: overruled. 02:38:52 19 mr. geary: excuse me, your honor. additional 02:38:54 20 objection as to the williams objection we talked about 02:38:55 21 before. 02:38:59 22 the court: overruled. 02:38:59 23 mr. byrd: dr. gentry admitted 400,000 deaths a 02:39:02 24 year. one in two smokers are going to get a disease. it was 02:39:06 25 a little bit vague in his mind, and then he remembered 02:39:09 197 1 400,000 deaths a year. 02:39:12 2 faye graham was one of them. 02:39:15 3 now, you are going to get to a question, question 02:39:16 4 number -- let me go to the comparative fault question. 02:39:19 5 so we would submit to you, have we proved more 02:39:24 vol 07 pm graham, earl 6 likely right than wrong that they agreed -- that they 02:39:26 7 concealed information? of course we did. because there was 02:39:29 8 information that was not otherwise known or available as 02:39:33 9 given to you by the engle findings once you find she is a 02:39:35 10 member of the engle class. 02:39:40 11 was it a conspiracy? you will be instructed on 02:39:42 12 that. they did agree. you will be instructed on what a 02:39:44 13 conspiracy is. 02:39:47 14 one of the next questions -- 02:39:48 15 ms. parker: objection as to the term that is used. 02:39:48 16 it is an agreement. 02:39:51 17 the court: overruled. 02:39:52 18 mr. byrd: it is a conspiracy claim we have. 02:39:53 19 agreement -- the jury will be instructed about what a 02:39:57 20 conspiracy is. 02:40:00 21 now, the next question you will be asked about was 02:40:00 22 whether -- was the reliance a legal cause of faye graham's 02:40:06 23 death in each of these questions? of course it was. 02:40:11 24 you will go to the jury instruction again where 02:40:13 25 they tell you what is legal cause. and legal cause does not 02:40:14 198 vol 07 pm graham, earl 1 have to be the only reason. it has to be a reason. the 02:40:17 2 concealment and omissions and lies that you see on this 02:40:21 3 timeline just had to be a reason that contributed to her 02:40:23 4 disease and death. and we submit that that is true. 02:40:28 5 now, let us get to comparative fault. 02:40:31 6 incidentally, barbara beaty came in here and she is about the 02:40:36 7 only -- you know, only person that the defendants wanted to 02:40:41 8 use for anything, and came in here and she said some pretty 02:40:45 9 harsh charges about mr. earl graham. well, he beat my mom. 02:40:49 10 now, let us say a couple of things about that. she 02:40:54 11 never said anywhere in her deposition that was all day 02:40:57 12 long -- she had an all-day deposition. 02:41:00 13 ms. parker: objection, your honor. not in 02:41:02 14 evidence. objection. 02:41:03 15 the court: do you mean her testimony? 02:41:04 16 mr. byrd: she was asked whether -- was not she -- 02:41:06 17 in a deposition for how long it was, and she was asked 02:41:10 18 whether she said anything like that. 02:41:13 19 ms. parker: no, your honor. no evidence. 02:41:15 20 the court: well, that is overruled. there was a 02:41:18 21 question about her deposition. there was not any specific 02:41:21 vol 07 pm graham, earl 22 reference to anything in her deposition, but you did ask her 02:41:24 23 about her deposition testimony. 02:41:27 24 the jury will remember what her testimony was 02:41:28 25 specifically. 02:41:31 199 1 mr. byrd: she was -- she came in here and she 02:41:33 2 said -- mr. lantinberg asked her: you gave a deposition, a 02:41:37 3 full-day deposition; is that right? 9:00 to 5:00 or 02:41:42 4 something like that. 02:41:44 5 yes, i did. 02:41:45 6 and you did not say anything about this in that 02:41:46 7 deposition? 02:41:47 8 well, she said, well, i do not think i was asked. 02:41:48 9 okay. a full-day deposition, i submit to you 02:41:52 10 everything would be covered, and she had nothing to say about 02:41:56 11 that. 02:41:59 12 but what she did do is the day before she came in 02:41:59 13 to testify, she talked to the cigarette companies' lawyers 02:42:02 14 and then came in here and testified. 02:42:06 15 now, what did she testify about? one incident -- 02:42:07 vol 07 pm graham, earl 16 did she describe any circumstances about what happened? did 02:42:10 17 she describe any specifics about what happened? any of the 02:42:13 18 facts surrounding it? exactly when, where, what the 02:42:16 19 situation was? no. you did not hear that. 02:42:19 20 you did hear from mr. earl graham, who came up and 02:42:21 21 he acknowledged one incident they had when they first met, 02:42:25 22 and he told the defendants about it in his deposition. this 02:42:28 23 is how they knew. so mr. graham said nothing ever like that 02:42:31 24 ever happened again. 02:42:35 25 and so i would submit, no. 1, it did not happen. 02:42:36 200 1 nothing happened like that. there is all sorts of reasons 02:42:41 2 why family members come in and have disputes and -- 02:42:43 3 ms. parker: objection. no evidence. 02:42:48 4 mr. byrd: -- you did not hear -- 02:42:50 5 the court: i'll sustain that. 02:42:52 6 mr. byrd: -- you did not hear any evidence. 02:42:54 7 certainly not enough evidence to say likely right than wrong 02:42:56 8 to say what she said was true. 02:42:59 9 you heard evidence from mr. graham, too. 02:43:00 10 regardless, what does it matter right now to your 02:43:04 vol 07 pm graham, earl 11 questions of addiction and to whether addiction caused her 02:43:07 12 disease? is this a distraction? does this really matter to 02:43:09 13 what you have to decide in this case? 02:43:12 14 now, on the comparative fault issue, this is where 02:43:15 15 you will be asked what percentage of fault should be 02:43:18 16 attributed to faye graham and what comparative fault should 02:43:21 17 be attributed to reynolds and philip morris. 02:43:27 18 here's what we would submit to the jury here. 02:43:30 19 this is the place where if you have a problem with whether -- 02:43:33 20 you know, how hard she tried to quit, whether she should have 02:43:37 21 known to quit earlier, or what she should have done in 02:43:40 22 quitting, this is the place for you to put that in. 02:43:43 23 we would submit to you that the first warnings 02:43:46 24 were not until 1966. she started smoking in 1951. for 15 02:43:49 25 years there were no warnings on packages. okay. for the 02:43:54 201 1 rest of the years, there was a warning that said it may be 02:43:58 2 hazardous. the surgeon general says it may be hazardous. 02:44:01 3 it was not until 1985 when the surgeon general -- i 02:44:04 4 mean, when the surgeon general demanded that a warning be on 02:44:07 5 that said it causes lung cancer. it was the first time. 02:44:09 vol 07 pm graham, earl 6 so for seven or eight years, eight years of her 02:44:12 7 smoking history, from '85 to 1993 when she died, that warning 02:44:15 8 was on the package. 02:44:20 9 mr. geary: excuse me, your honor. objection, 02:44:21 10 preemption. 02:44:22 11 the court: overruled. 02:44:23 12 mr. byrd: that is twenty percent of her smoking 02:44:25 13 history. 02:44:28 14 what we would argue is that, look, they made the 02:44:28 15 cigarettes. she smoked them. we would start at 50/50 for 02:44:31 16 everybody. 02:44:35 17 but if you take -- you know, take the twenty percent 02:44:36 18 history that she had that knowledge of between 1958 and 1992 02:44:39 19 about lung cancer, take that twenty percent and split it 50/50. 02:44:44 20 why? because of what they were doing. they did not even 02:44:49 21 admit it until 1999 that it caused cancer. 02:44:53 22 if you split it two ways, that is ten percent fault 02:44:57 23 to mrs. graham. she has paid with her life already. that is 02:45:00 24 ten percent fault to mrs. graham and ninety percent fault to 02:45:04 25 r.j. reynolds and philip morris. and we would submit 02:45:10 202 vol 07 pm graham, earl 1 equally. 02:45:13 2 now, i will be back up here when i can, but i need 02:45:14 3 to talk to you about -- well, as you consider that 02:45:17 4 comparative fault, i want you to remember, you know, the 02:45:20 5 cigarette companies had a hundred percent of the knowledge of 02:45:25 6 what they were doing with their cigarettes in designing the 02:45:28 7 product, and they worked as hard as they could to push her 02:45:31 8 knowledge down to zero with what she had. 02:45:36 9 they did everything they could with their 02:45:38 10 advertising. they spent -- all the pink sheets in the world 02:45:40 11 that the defendants put on this board, all the pink sheets in 02:45:44 12 the world, okay -- we read you the ftc report. the cigarette 02:45:49 13 companies spent in one day what the public health authorities 02:45:55 14 spent in a year to warn people. now, think about that. 02:45:58 15 all the pink sheets in the world cannot undo that. 02:46:03 16 and there is a reason why they are sending this advertising 02:46:07 17 out while these claims are coming out in newspapers. they 02:46:10 18 are bombarding a hundred times. if we had played the 02:46:13 19 advertisements here comparable to the psas that were out 02:46:16 20 there, we would have been here for weeks. a hundred times 02:46:22 vol 07 pm graham, earl 21 the number of ads for one psa. 02:46:25 22 so think about that. they had a hundred percent 02:46:28 23 of the knowledge and worked so hard through advertising and 02:46:30 24 other ways to push our knowledge down to zero. 02:46:33 25 now, how do you judge the damages in this case? 02:46:36 203 1 you will get to the spot in the verdict form where you were 02:46:40 2 asked to state the total amount of damages you find for earl 02:46:48 3 graham's loss of support. and the judge will instruct you 02:46:51 4 about how you are supposed to determine that. 02:46:54 5 you are just supposed to look at the losses to 02:46:56 6 be -- the full, just, and reasonable compensation. and we 02:47:01 7 are not asking you for sympathy. we are not asking you -- 02:47:05 8 the time for sympathy is gone. we want you to talk about 02:47:08 9 just the losses that he suffered. 02:47:11 10 here's a man, okay, who, by the way, should not 02:47:13 11 be -- no one wants to be judged -- even if it is -- even if 02:47:17 12 there is any remote truthfulness to anything that ms. beaty 02:47:21 13 said, and there is not. 02:47:24 14 no one wants to be judged by the worst day in 02:47:26 15 their life. he had 20-some-odd years -- or about 20 years, 02:47:28 vol 07 pm graham, earl 16 from '74 to '93, with faye graham. love at first sight, and 02:47:34 17 went on. and she was independent herself. she loved earl 02:47:38 18 graham. they did things together. they drove an rv. they 02:47:44 19 traveled around together. 02:47:49 20 it was one of the last things they were able to 02:47:50 21 do. she just wanted to get in the car and drive around with 02:47:52 22 him. it was as if they were married since 1974. he had the 02:47:55 23 watch that you saw. he had the rings that she gave him in 02:47:58 24 1974, and he is never taken them off. never remarried and 02:48:02 25 never taken them off. she did everything for him. 02:48:05 204 1 she did one of the things that is probably the most 02:48:07 2 embarrassing and hardest things to discuss with people you 02:48:09 3 do not know. he could not read. she read for him since they 02:48:12 4 knew each other. she did all of the stuff to deal around the 02:48:16 5 house, even as much as reading his entire life. now he goes 02:48:19 6 down the street to a friend with his mail. 02:48:23 7 so, you know, if i were here asking you for -- if 02:48:25 8 i were here asking you to compensate mr. graham because he 02:48:29 9 loss somebody he loved for a week, maybe that would be 02:48:32 10 something that i would ask in the thousands for. 02:48:34 vol 07 pm graham, earl 11 if i were here asking you to -- you know, 02:48:36 12 mr. graham lost somebody for a few months because she is in 02:48:40 13 the hospital and this is a tough recovery period, you know, 02:48:43 14 maybe we would get in the tens of thousands. but you have to 02:48:45 15 measure the level of harm here that was suffered. 02:48:49 16 here we have somebody who lost, as you heard 02:48:52 17 mr. lantinberg read the tables and that is why we did that, 02:48:55 18 lost somebody who had a life expectancy of 25 years. she had 02:48:59 19 another 25 years to live. she died in 1993. she would still 02:49:03 20 be here with us today. how do you measure that? you have to 02:49:09 21 do that. you have to measure that. 02:49:12 22 but that is why we suggest a number of $6 million. 02:49:15 23 5.5 million puffs, that is about a dollar a puff. $6 million. 02:49:20 24 you may choose to do more than that. you may 02:49:26 25 choose to do a little bit less than that. that is in your 02:49:29 205 1 hands, but we suggest to you that that is the number. 02:49:32 2 and then the final question that you are going to 02:49:34 3 be asked is about punitive damages. 02:49:38 4 the punitive damage question is whether their 02:49:40 vol 07 pm graham, earl 5 conduct -- it is very simple. the judge is going to instruct 02:49:46 6 you. 02:49:49 7 the standard is if you find that mr. graham has 02:49:51 8 proved by clear and convincing evidence -- it is a higher 02:49:59 9 standard than beyond more likely right than wrong. it is a 02:50:02 10 little bit higher standard. everything else is on the more 02:50:05 11 likely right than wrong. 02:50:08 12 we have to show you by clear and convincing 02:50:10 13 evidence that the defendant had -- the defendants had actual 02:50:11 14 knowledge of the wrongfulness of their conduct and that there 02:50:15 15 was a high probability of injury or damage to mrs. graham, 02:50:17 16 and despite that knowledge, intentionally pursued that course 02:50:20 17 of conduct resulting in mrs. graham's death. 02:50:23 18 all we ask you to do is see this timeline. by the 02:50:26 19 way, this is not evidence. this is not going to go back in 02:50:32 20 the jury room with you. it is here right now for you to see. 02:50:34 21 all we would submit to you, of course, this was 02:50:37 22 intentional. they were designing the products intentionally 02:50:39 23 for addiction. 02:50:42 24 by the time you get to 1984, they are laughing 02:50:43 25 about it. all we need is a bigger bag to go to the bank. 02:50:46 206 vol 07 pm graham, earl 1 and today, dr. gentry and dr. jupe, you know, they 02:50:50 2 cannot even admit addiction causes the disease. they cannot 02:50:57 3 even admit addiction causes the disease. oh, it is addictive, 02:51:01 4 and we admit smoking causes cancer and that smoking can be 02:51:05 5 addictive. 02:51:08 6 but you heard the attorney ask him, what about 02:51:09 7 chain of causation? does not addiction, then, cause the 02:51:12 8 disease? 02:51:15 9 no, no, no, we would not say that. we cannot say 02:51:15 10 that. 02:51:18 11 and that is their current dispute. that is what 02:51:19 12 they dispute now, because what they will say is anybody can 02:51:22 13 quit. 02:51:25 14 now i'm going to sit down. i thank you for your 02:51:25 15 time. i will only have a few minutes to come back. i took 02:51:27 16 more than i expected. i am only going to have a few minutes 02:51:30 17 when i get back up here. 02:51:33 18 but you will hear from the attorneys on the other 02:51:34 19 side, and they are very good attorneys, and you will hear 02:51:36 20 from them. and i will just ask a couple of things when you 02:51:39 vol 07 pm graham, earl 21 listen. 02:51:42 22 one, remember this campaign of doubt, okay? 02:51:42 23 remember they are going to come up here with arguments and 02:51:47 24 say, oh, we do not know if it was lung cancer. maybe it was 02:51:50 25 this. 02:51:52 207 1 ms. parker: objection, your honor. we have a 02:51:53 2 right to defend ourselves. 02:51:54 3 the court: i'll overrule that. 02:51:56 4 mr. byrd: we do not know if this is lung cancer. 02:51:59 5 we do not really know if she ever -- we do not know if she ever 02:52:01 6 really saw any of our advertising. 02:52:05 7 what is more likely right than wrong is what you 02:52:07 8 have to look at. and i want you to think about that as you 02:52:09 9 hear their arguments. 02:52:12 10 every time -- she is going -- i believe they will 02:52:13 11 talk to you about faye graham's choices that she made. and 02:52:17 12 they are going to use the word "choice" over and over. 02:52:20 13 every time they talk about faye graham's choices 02:52:22 14 that she made, i want you to think about the exact same 02:52:24 15 timeline of when they are talking about what choices they 02:52:28 vol 07 pm graham, earl 16 made. what choices faye did during that same time. 02:52:31 17 finally, as they argue, we would submit that the 02:52:35 18 argument in this case, really, from the tobacco companies is 02:52:42 19 this -- and i want you to think about this in a common sense 02:52:45 20 way. back to common sense. the argument from the tobacco 02:52:49 21 companies is: faye graham, what were you doing? you were 02:52:53 22 just dumb to buy our product and use it. why did you do 02:52:59 23 that? 02:53:05 24 think about that and where we are in this 02:53:05 25 courtroom. what you are going to do is important. you are 02:53:08 208 1 the last stop for this -- for mr. graham's claims. 02:53:10 2 the president, he is one branch of government. the 02:53:15 3 congress is another branch -- 02:53:17 4 ms. parker: objection. 02:53:19 5 the court: i'll sustain that. it is not the last 02:53:19 6 stop, necessarily. 02:53:22 7 mr. byrd: okay. maybe appeal. 02:53:24 8 the court: i'm sorry? 02:53:26 9 mr. byrd: it may be appealed. 02:53:28 vol 07 pm graham, earl 10 the court: you understand the objection and you 02:53:30 11 understand the ruling because we talked about it. 02:53:32 12 mr. byrd: okay. 02:53:34 13 you are the third branch of government for us. 02:53:35 14 ms. parker: objection, your honor. 02:53:40 15 the court: that is fine. but, mr. byrd, you need 02:53:42 16 to make your point and move on. 02:53:45 17 mr. byrd: okay. 02:53:47 18 and we ask that you consider the evidence 02:53:48 19 carefully. read the evidence and the documents we have put 02:53:52 20 forward and that you will take back in the jury room with 02:53:55 21 you. and return a verdict of -- what we would suggest is $6 02:53:57 22 million for mr. graham's losses and a yes on punitive 02:54:03 23 damages. 02:54:08 24 thank you very much. 7 mr. byrd: so that is the argument. she 03:58:55 8 should not -- she should have known better than to smoke the 03:59:11 9 very products we wanted her to smoke and gave to her to 03:59:13 10 smoke. 03:59:17 11 now, you heard some arguments here from them 03:59:17 12 that -- you know, you heard ms. parker say they want you to 03:59:20 13 come back for more evidence. you can just check no, no, no, 03:59:22 14 and then you can go home. you are better than that. 03:59:26 15 mr. graham has asked for more than that. we want 03:59:31 16 you to look at the evidence. take the time you need to look 03:59:33 vol 07 pm graham, earl 17 at the evidence and make a decision that you want. 03:59:37 18 they mentioned the word "quit" over and over. the 03:59:39 19 word "quit" is not in the verdict form. if anything, it goes 03:59:44 20 into the comparative fault section. the percentage of fault. 03:59:47 21 if their definition of "addiction" were true, 03:59:52 22 guess what? then there is no addiction. we all agree that 03:59:57 23 people can quit. any addict of any drug can quit. it 04:00:01 24 does not mean that you were not addicted. and that is the 04:00:05 25 question that you will face. 04:00:08 255 1 i heard them mention the 60 million people that 04:00:10 2 have quit smoking. they did not tell you about the definition 04:00:14 3 of how that was determined. you only had to have smoked a 04:00:16 4 hundred cigarettes ever to have been a smoker. only a 04:00:19 5 hundred. 04:00:22 6 they did not talk to you about how many of those 04:00:23 7 people relapsed. we did not hear about all the people that 04:00:28 8 relapsed of the 60 million, which is what the experts say, 04:00:30 9 chronic relapsing disease. 04:00:35 10 the medical records -- let us go to the medical 04:00:39 11 records. 04:00:42 vol 07 pm graham, earl 12 by the way, you heard the stipulations of fact. 04:00:44 13 there is no stipulation of fact that r.j. reynolds is legally 04:00:49 14 responsible for these companies you heard about, the american 04:00:52 15 tobacco company, brown & williamson. those are the companies 04:00:56 16 that -- they were the previous names, but they own them now, 04:00:58 17 and they are legally responsible for them. there is no 04:01:01 18 dispute about that whatsoever. that is the law. 04:01:04 19 now, the medical records you talked about, they 04:01:07 20 wrote -- in the first medical record, they wrote plus 04:01:13 21 30-year-pack history. they said there was nothing in the 04:01:17 22 medical records about addiction. what do you think they 04:01:19 23 wrote that for? of course, it relates to her lung cancer. 04:01:22 24 they only talked to you about two medical records. 04:01:25 25 in their exhibits, there are only two records. 04:01:29 256 1 we gave you all the medical records, exhibit 1365. 04:01:31 2 of course, they pick the first ones when they are 04:01:35 3 first starting to test. after they test, their doctors, her 04:01:37 4 treating doctors, said lung cancer. adenocarcinoma. you 04:01:41 5 have engle finding caused by smoking. adenocarcinoma of the 04:01:44 6 lung, the treating doctors did say that. 04:01:47 vol 07 pm graham, earl 7 dr. feingold is not disagreeing with them. he 04:01:50 8 went on to test it and prove it further. you heard nothing 04:01:52 9 from the defendants to counter that. 04:01:56 10 the last people who can blame faye graham for 04:01:58 11 smoking cigarettes, surely, are the companies that gave them 04:02:04 12 to her. 04:02:08 13 you heard mr. heimann say, i would not blame a 04:02:09 14 smoker for smoking one pack. i will not blame them for smoking 04:02:12 15 two. but that is what they are doing to faye graham right 04:02:16 16 now. 04:02:19 17 now, you heard them talk about -- briefly about 04:02:19 18 medical issues. oh, now it came from a different part of the 04:02:22 19 body, the gi tract. but the medical records, when you look, 04:02:26 20 you know that -- you remember dr. feingold said if it had 04:02:30 21 come from down here, the stomach, or the gi tract, 04:02:33 22 reproductive tract, it would have hit the liver first, but 04:02:36 23 the liver was all clear. 04:02:39 24 read the medical records. the liver was all 04:02:41 25 clear. and that is why they were able to test and the 04:02:43 257 vol 07 pm graham, earl 1 treating doctors said adenocarcinoma of the lung and that is 04:02:45 2 why dr. feingold was able to seal it with testing. 04:02:49 3 seal the deal a hundred percent, ttf-1, napsin a, 04:02:52 4 no question. 04:02:57 5 now, you heard the defendants talk about these 04:02:59 6 documents that we brought up. oh, just a few documents. 04:03:01 7 well, we did not have time to bring you all of them. of 04:03:04 8 course not. and that would be wasting some time if we sat 04:03:07 9 here forever. 04:03:11 10 no witness from r.j. reynolds or philip morris 04:03:11 11 came in here to tell you any different than what we showed 04:03:15 12 you in those documents are what they meant. they brought no 04:03:17 13 witness. and if there was a good explanation, they would 04:03:21 14 have brought it. 04:03:24 15 they read some documents, cherry picked things 04:03:25 16 from the stuff they wrote and gave to people to mislead them. 04:03:27 17 there is -- speaking of which, there is no evidence in here 04:03:31 18 at all about why they talk about the e.u. made this decision 04:03:33 19 about light and low tars. we have heard no evidence about 04:03:37 20 what the circumstances were or what information they had, if 04:03:40 21 they even made that decision. 04:03:43 vol 07 pm graham, earl 22 now, you heard no evidence at all from the 04:03:44 23 defendants to contradict the videos you heard from their own 04:03:49 24 executives. you know, if these pink sheets are so obvious 04:03:53 25 that they put on there and mrs. graham should have known, 04:03:58 258 1 what were the cigarette executives doing? closing their eyes 04:04:04 2 and ears? they did not hear it? 04:04:07 3 mr. heimann and the philip morris executives, what 04:04:10 4 were they doing? did they not read reader's digest? there 04:04:12 5 was no evidence that faye graham ever read reader's digest. 04:04:15 6 if it was so obvious, what were they doing? why were they 04:04:18 7 marketing cigarettes saying that they are so good for you and 04:04:22 8 that they are okay for you and they will not hurt you if they 04:04:25 9 knew all these pink sheets were true? 04:04:29 10 now, it is like this, an analogy -- cell phones. 04:04:31 11 everybody uses cell phones today. okay. and let us say 04:04:38 12 reports come out if you use your cell phone all the time, you 04:04:42 13 might get brain cancer. you see it in newspapers sometimes. 04:04:45 14 a few articles here and there. 04:04:50 15 what if 30, 40 years down the road, we find out 04:04:51 16 that lo and behold, the cell phone companies knew they had 04:04:57 vol 07 pm graham, earl 17 these documents that said it causes brain cancer and they hid 04:05:03 18 them? they did not tell us. they waited while everybody kept 04:05:06 19 using it, developing this stuff, and they did not say a word 04:05:09 20 about it. 04:05:12 21 and then we try to hold them accountable, and they 04:05:12 22 go back and go, well, you knew. you knew. you heard it in 04:05:15 23 newspapers it causes brain cancer. 04:05:20 24 and you are trying to come back and trying to say, 04:05:22 25 well, hold on, but everybody was using cell phones. nobody 04:05:25 259 1 really believed it. 04:05:28 2 well, it is in the newspaper right here. here's an 04:05:30 3 article. here's an article. here's an article. what were 04:05:32 4 you doing using that cell phone? 04:05:34 5 it changes everything. these documents change 04:05:36 6 everything because now we know they knew. 04:05:39 7 and all these pink sheets -- repackaging. 04:05:43 8 repackaging. now, ms. parker says we are repacking. faye 04:05:46 9 graham, earl graham. 04:05:52 10 ed, bring up advertising. 04:05:54 11 the court: two minutes, mr. byrd. 04:05:56 vol 07 pm graham, earl 12 mr. byrd: from the greatest -- this is 04:05:58 13 exhibit 1060. you will have it back here. you will have all 04:06:07 14 these print ads you can just flip through. 04:06:10 15 if they knew that this stuff was hurting people 04:06:12 16 and killing people, what were these ads doing? more doctors 04:06:14 17 smoke camels. 04:06:18 18 look through them, please, ed. keep going. 04:06:20 19 oh, this will help your throat. no throat 04:06:23 20 irritation. what were they doing advertising this? 04:06:25 21 keep flipping through, ed. over and over. keep 04:06:29 22 flipping through, because we do not have the time to go 04:06:33 23 through all of them. 04:06:35 24 if they knew that this stuff was bad, why were 04:06:35 25 they doing this? $250 billion. they spent more in one day 04:06:39 260 1 than the public health authorities could spend in a year to 04:06:43 2 warn people. 04:06:46 3 you think -- i mean, the cell phone companies, 04:06:47 4 more newspaper reports or more advertisements to buy cell 04:06:53 5 phones? which one blankets? 04:06:57 vol 07 pm graham, earl 6 now, i appreciate your time. 04:06:59 7 the last thing i'll say, the defendants argue that 04:07:02 8 there is no reliance. there is no proof of reliance. there 04:07:05 9 is no communication here that she relied on. reliance? 04:07:09 10 5.5 million puffs. the communication from the cigarette 04:07:16 11 company after 1982? after they said the exit gates are open. 04:07:20 12 oh, no, december 1982, look at exhibit 72 about this. 04:07:25 13 exhibit 72, read it. it is a great document. 04:07:29 14 the connection? every time she opened one of 04:07:34 15 these and puffed them. every time. there is the 04:07:37 16 communication. every time she opened one of these and puffed 04:07:41 17 on it. a new reliance on their product. 04:07:45 18 just like when you open a bottle of water and you 04:07:50 19 assume that what is in it is what they have told you about. 04:07:52 20 that is the reliance. the cigarettes that she smoked. 04:07:55 21 the court: time, mr. byrd. 04:08:00 22 mr. byrd: we appreciate your time, and we request 04:08:01 23 a verdict in our favor for mr. graham, as we said. thank 04:08:04 24 you. thank you for your time.
