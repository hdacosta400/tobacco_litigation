4 mr. kaczynski: thank you, your honor, 5 counsel, mrs. gray. 6 ladies and gentleman of the jury, we have 7 come a long way together. it is been a very 8 interesting trial, i would imagine. i see we are 9 finally winding down and as we do, let me sort of 10 start here where i started the first time around, 11 and that is to thank you for the attention you have 12 paid. thank you for your service. 13 you know, in our country there is a scale or 14 a range of ways you can serve your country or 15 your state or your county. it could be as simple 16 as paying your taxes, ranging all the way up to 17 the ultimate sacrifice. you folks are on the 18 upper end of that scale with your jury service 19 because as i said before, we literally could not 20 do this without you and your willingness to 21 serve. i'm sure i speak for everyone, we are 22 grateful for it. thank you. 23 in my opening i told you that this case was 24 about charles gray and the choices he made. 25 since then we have seen a lot of paper put up on 1 the screen, a lot of witnesses in the witness 2 chair. you have heard from m.d.s, and ph.d.s, a 3 psychiatrist, mr. gray's family and friends, 4 either live or by deposition. but even after all 5 that, this case is still about charles gray and 6 the choices he made, the choice to smoke, the 7 choice to continue to smoke, and ultimately the 8 choice to accept personal responsibility for his 9 actions. 10 in this case as you are the finders of 11 fact, it is up to you and only you to look at the 12 testimony, to look at the witnesses; and in this 13 case you have actually had a witness who came out 14 and said he was rooting for the plaintiffs to 15 win. 16 you can employ your god-given common sense 17 to the testimony of the witnesses that you have 18 heard to decide that first question you were 19 shown a moment ago, and that is whether mr. 20 gray's death was caused by an addiction to 21 cigarettes containing nicotine or whether mr. 22 gray's death was on account of the choices he 23 made. 24 you are also going to have to decide whether 25 the plaintiffs built that bridge i talked about 1 in opening, that bridge between mr. gray and r.j. 2 reynolds. you see out here going over the bay, 3 the bridge over the bay is built with concrete 4 and steel. the bridges in this courtroom have to 5 be built with evidence and proof. evidence and 6 proof that charles gray relied upon something 7 that r.j. reynolds did. evidence and proof, not 8 guesswork, not to use dr. cummings' word of 9 wallpaper. evidence and proof. 10 now, what is the evidence and proof? well, 11 you cannot look at the evidence and proof until 12 you look where it came from. and on the subject 13 of addiction, the first issue you are going to 14 have to deal with, the plaintiffs called three 15 doctors, dr. cummings, dr. burns and 16 dr. benowitz. 17 let me just start out by saying that in 18 their respective fields and what they do when 19 they deal with patients, these men have all made 20 great contributions to society. 21 dr. benowitz, he is a cardiologist, and he is 22 done a lot of nicotine research, particularly in 23 heart-related issues. dr. burns, an author or 24 coauthor or editor of several surgeon general 25 reports, a pulmonologist or lung doctor. 1 dr. cummings, although he is not a medical doctor 2 or a psychiatrist or a psychologist or board 3 certified in anything, to the extent the clinic 4 he runs helps people quit smoking, he is 5 performing a valuable service. 6 but when they step away from their 7 professions and they step into a courtroom, as 8 they have many, many, many times, when they 9 decide to help lawyers rather than people, they 10 become the plaintiff's dream team. 11 you do not see a team like this very often. 12 look at the number of trials, smoking and health 13 trials, not trials overall, 20, 20, 40. 70 14 depositions, over 100. lectured to lawyers, 15 recruit other witnesses, and there is their 16 billing rate. 17 this is not the portrait of a dispassionate 18 group of experts who come in here to share their 19 expertise. you heard from each of them, they 20 help the plaintiffs formulate their case, pick 21 the evidence, rehearse their case before mock 22 jurors and recruit others to the cause. 23 and dr. cummings called it a cause. 24 dr. cummings called it the war against 25 cigarettes. dr. cummings compared it to the war 1 against terrorism, and he accepted the title of 2 general in that war. these are the things you 3 consider when you weigh the testimony they gave 4 you. 5 now, what did they tell you? dr. benowitz 6 did not say anything about mr. gray. dr. cummings 7 called mr. gray highly addictive. dr. keefe, who 8 is the only psychiatrist you heard from, the only 9 person who is trained specifically in evaluating 10 people for their mental condition, he said 11 there is no such term known to medical science, 12 there is no medical meaning. 13 dr. cummings took it a step further. he 14 said he could reach that conclusion that mr. gray 15 was highly addictive on the basis of one 16 question. when did he have his first cigarette 17 in the morning? does that sound like science to 18 you? 19 dr. burns looked at more factors than that 20 and he came out and called mr. gray powerfully 21 addicted. you also heard from dr. keefe that 22 that is another term with no medical significance 23 whatsoever. 24 and dr. burns reviewed only five 25 depositions -- only five of the 15 witnesses who 1 had been deposed in this case. he missed some of 2 mr. gray's siblings. he missed some of mr. 3 gray's children, and he missed some of mr. gray's 4 close friends. 5 even for this team, what was their bottom 6 line? dr. benowitz said heavy smokers can quit. 7 dr. benowitz said, would you agree there is 8 nothing about cigarettes that causes a smoker to 9 lose the ability to be responsible for their own 10 action; that is correct, is not it? answer, yes. 11 dr. benowitz says that the nicotine 12 receptors in the brain are not permanent unlike 13 what dr. cummings said. as far as we know they 14 go back to normal within a few weeks. so after a 15 smoker quits smoking, the nicotine receptors do 16 come back to normal within two full weeks, right? 17 yes. 18 dr. burns, he says it is possible to quit 19 smoking, even for someone, as he said, who was 20 powerfully addicted. he does not imply that it is 21 impossible to stop. and like dr. benowitz, 22 dr. burns says, just because someone is addicted 23 to nicotine does not relieve that person of 24 responsibility for their own behavior. even an 25 addicted behavior, they have to decide to try to 1 quit and then make a decision to quit. they have 2 to make an effort to quit. smokers are 3 responsible for their choices. 4 even dr. cummings, the anchor of the 5 plaintiff's case, he says -- even he says that 6 that is right, it was not impossible for mr. gray 7 to quit at any point in his life. 8 dr. burns told you about the benefits of 9 quitting smoking and it is a long quote that 10 basically says, it has immediate benefits for 11 people of all ages and a person who quits smoking 12 before the age of 50 would have half the risk of 13 dying in 15 years as compared to continuing 14 smokers. the risk goes down and goes down 15 dramatically. 16 but the best evidence we had of quitting 17 smoking was a gentleman who sat in that chair 18 about a week ago, john gray, mr. gray's older 19 brother. he told you the story of how he was 20 given a diagnosis that was not too favorable and 21 he said he quit to save his life, and he did. he 22 did quit and he did save his life and he was here 23 to tell you that. 24 as i said, dr. cummings was the key to the 25 plaintiff's case, the anchor of their case, all 1 aspects of their case. you got a good look at 2 him. he testified here for seven hours on direct 3 examination. i cross-examined him for over four. 4 he admits that testifying has become like a 5 second job to him that takes him away from his 6 first job, the job where he helps people rather 7 than helping lawyers. this was his third trial 8 in pensacola. he will be back next month for his 9 fourth, such that almost like testifying has 10 become his second job, pensacola has become his 11 second home. 12 he is the guy that told you in his view a 13 just verdict is a plaintiff's verdict. in this 14 case you are rooting for mrs. gray to win, right? 15 well i -- yes. 16 ladies and gentlemen, you can sit on a jury 17 every week of your life for the rest of your life 18 and you will never hear an answer like that. 19 mr. loehr: objection, your honor. that is 20 inappropriate. 21 the court: sustained. 22 mr. kaczynski: dr. cummings, you will 23 learn, received training on how to avoid 24 answering questions. you saw that on display 25 here. sixteen times i asked the court to strike 1 part of his answer as nonresponsive. sixteen 2 times the court granted that and struck part of 3 his answer as nonresponsive. 4 dr. cummings received training on how to 5 create controversies. you saw a little about 6 that on display here too. he created a 7 controversy by using school children to write 8 letters to the tobacco companies. my client had 9 the courtesy to respond, but not to the kids, to 10 the principal and the principal did not -- the 11 principal shared it with the school nurse. the 12 school nurse shared it with dr. cummings and now 13 dr. cummings shares it as a trial exhibit all 14 across the country. he created a controversy. 15 he learned well. 16 now, you saw the materials he uses when 17 he is counseling smokers. when he is dealing with 18 people instead of lawyers, you see the things are 19 motivational, they are positive in nature. they 20 warn about withdrawal and how to get over it. 21 they warn about relapses and tell you to hang in 22 there and start again. you heard when he 23 testified in a cigarette trial ten years ago, 24 that he tells his patients, the people who come 25 into his clinic, that the success rate for truly 1 motivated smokers is one hundred percent. 2 on that witness stand he called it a joke. 3 now that he is here helping lawyers, he said 4 people called it a joke. 5 he also came up with a phrase "constrained 6 choice." you want to talk about phrases with no 7 medical meaning, that is a phrase that not only 8 has no medical meaning, but has been adopted by 9 nobody, not the surgeon general, not the dsm, 10 nobody. that is dr. cummings' own term that he 11 uses in courtrooms like this one. you will not see 12 that term anywhere in his smart move booklet. 13 now that he is in a courtroom helping 14 lawyers instead of people, he paints a very bleak 15 picture for anyone who smokes a pack or more a 16 day of cigarettes. you get the sense from his 17 testimony that smokers of that level almost lose 18 their freewill, that their smoking is almost 19 involuntary, that there is not a person standing 20 between addiction and disease. 21 remember what the surgeon general said. 22 the surgeon general said cigarette smoking 23 represents a category of health problems that can 24 be called personal choice behavior. again, 25 cigarette smoking is an addictive behavior and 1 the individual must decide whether or not to 2 continue that behavior. the individual can 3 decide whether or not to continue that behavior. 4 you saw some instances when dr. cummings 5 tried a little hard to help the lawyers. for 6 example here, he talked about how one of mr. 7 gray's grandsons said, well, he got rid of all 8 the cigarettes in the house. i showed you the 9 transcript. you saw no such thing. 10 he suggested that the daughter angela's 11 testimony said that mr. gray used a patch about 12 the same time of his bladder cancer diagnosis. 13 that is not just false. that is impossible. the 14 patch, we know, did not come out until 1993. the 15 bladder cancer and relapses were all in the 16 1980s. there were other instances where he 17 talked about the patch without indicating exactly 18 when it was used. 19 he cited one grandson to say he lighted one 20 cigarette after the other. well, in so doing, he 21 did not tell you about the fact that his son 22 mickey, another grandson, his sister betty said 23 they never saw that happen. he ignored the 24 testimony that mr. gray did not smoke while he was 25 hunting. he ignored the testimony of gene allen 1 jones who said when mr. gray would go hunting, he 2 would be out there for a period of time, half 3 day, hours, a half day, depending on how long a 4 hunt would last, when he would not smoke. 5 so what he cobbled together for his chart 6 did not seem to include anything to suggest that 7 mr. gray could control his smoking. but we saw 8 there was plenty of evidence that mr. gray could 9 control his smoking. 10 he did not smoke during short periods like 11 church and the movies. he did not smoke when he 12 was out hunting, as we heard, up to a half day. 13 he did not smoke in the restaurant kitchen, did not 14 smoke in the kitchen of his home and did not smoke 15 in the country and western shows he went to with 16 his brother. 17 dr. cummings talked about withdrawal. more 18 restless, more at night. he is trying to suggest 19 that mr. gray was getting up in the middle of the 20 night to have a cigarette. it was on 21 cross-examination that we found out that him 22 getting up at night probably had nothing to do 23 with his cigarettes and everything to do with his 24 changing work patterns, changing from the fishing 25 job where he was up before the crack of dawn to 1 the restaurant job where he went in in the 2 afternoon and stayed until perhaps as late as one 3 in the morning. and then they opened the 4 restaurant early for lunch and so his sleeping 5 patterns changed again. 6 it was on cross-examination that 7 dr. cummings told us, no, he could not say that 8 the reason mr. gray was getting up was to smoke, 9 but he certainly suggested it there. 10 now, there was one monumentally huge fact 11 that you did not hear. you did not hear it from 12 dr. burns. you did not see it on any of 13 dr. cummings' slides. you did not even hear it on 14 the direct examination of mrs. gray, and that 15 monumentally huge fact is that we know mr. gray 16 could quit smoking because mr. gray did quit 17 smoking. 18 we heard in the cross-examination of 19 mrs. gray that mr. gray quit smoking for around a 20 year. that is a huge fact that neither 21 dr. cummings, nor dr. burns saw fit to share with 22 you. if this case is supposed to be about 23 concealment, that is a huge thing to conceal from 24 the jury. 25 here is what mrs. gray said. and at one 1 point your husband decided he was going to try to 2 quit smoking? yes. you think he quit for about 3 a year? almost a year? um-hum. and when he 4 quit, by the way, did you observe any personality 5 changes? well, he chewed the gum. no, roughly 6 no. 7 so there was no withdrawal. he quit 8 smoking for a year with no withdrawal. you 9 did not hear that either. 10 ladies and gentlemen, when you go back to 11 smoking after you have quit for a year, we are not 12 talking about days or weeks here, a year. it is 13 because you choose to. you heard a lot of talk 14 about relapse in this courtroom. this is a year 15 we are talking about. when you go back to smoking 16 after a year, all the nicotine is out of your 17 blood in 72 hours. 18 as you saw from dr. benowitz, whatever 19 changes there were with nicotine receptors in the 20 brain are back to normal in a couple of weeks. 21 if you have withdrawal, which apparently he 22 did not, that is long since gone. if you go back 23 to smoking after a year, it is because you want 24 to. it is because you choose to. and it does not 25 really matter whether he chose to because he 1 enjoyed smoking. it does not really matter if he 2 chose to because the scare of the bladder cancer 3 had worn off, as dr. keefe suggested the kind of 4 thing he is seen in his patients. 5 it does not matter the pressure of opening a 6 new business, opening mesquite charlie's. and it 7 really does not matter if it was a social aspect 8 of smoking with your employees which was the 9 situation when mrs. gray caught him. it does not 10 matter what the reason is. it was his reason. 11 it was his choice and that is a choice that you 12 really should not second guess. 13 when he went back to smoking about 1985, 14 there is been a lot of testimony from a lot of 15 people that he wanted to quit and he was trying 16 to quit. i do not for a moment doubt the 17 sincerity of any of those people who came into 18 the courtroom or you heard by deposition. he 19 probably convinced them of that. 20 from everything we heard, mr. gray was a 21 gregarious guy, a sociable guy. you have to look 22 behind his words to his acts. look at what he 23 did and look at what he did not do. and then 24 apply your common sense as to whether these were 25 real. 1 between the time he quit in 1985 and the 2 time he quit in 1993, the second time, what was 3 going on in there? was he really trying to quit? 4 were these serious quit efforts? in this you are 5 aided by the advice that dr. cummings and 6 dr. benowitz give the people they are dealing with 7 who are trying to quit, when they are dealing with 8 people rather than coming into courtrooms and 9 helping lawyers. 10 they say to throw out your cigarettes. did 11 mr. gray? no. they say to throw out your 12 ashtrays. did mr. gray? no. they say to throw 13 out lighters. no. not buy cigarettes. no. 14 tell others not to buy cigarettes. no. change 15 your routine. no. go to a smoking cessation 16 clinic. no. he did chew nicotine gum, but we 17 heard he was chewing that gum while he was still 18 smoking, and you heard that even mrs. gray 19 observed that and remarked to him, i see you 20 chewing gum and i see you smoking, i do not think 21 you are serious. she was right. it is common 22 sense. 23 now, you heard from dr. keefe, this is a 24 man who diagnoses people every day, who is 25 trained to do it, who teaches people to do it. 1 he is the chief of psychiatry at tampa general 2 hospital, the boss. he teaches at usf. he makes 3 competency determinations. he is asked by judges 4 to make those determinations. this is what he 5 does. 6 now, he is not as polished or practiced a 7 witness as dr. cummings. this is his first 8 cigarette case, not his 20th or his 50th. he 9 diagnoses people like mr. gray. he deals with 10 people, not a word processor. no, he is not 11 published peer-reviewed stuff. but he is dealt 12 with patients and he does it every day. 13 and what he told you is something you ought 14 to think hard about. he said addiction is not 15 like aids. it is not like a germ. it is not like 16 a virus. it does not cause your death. it is a 17 label for clusters of behaviors that are 18 determined by consulting the dsm. but standing 19 between addiction and injury is a person, a you, 20 a me, a mr. gray. a person with freewill, a 21 person with ability to make their own decisions, 22 and even in this age of victimhood, smoking is a 23 voluntary act as the surgeon general said. 24 personal choice behavior. addiction is a label 25 for that behavior. 1 but the responsibility for that behavior 2 rests with the person who acts, not a little, not 3 fifty percent, not twenty percent, but totally. 4 the evidence in this trial more than shows 5 that mr. gray was perfectly capable of exercising 6 that freewill. perfectly capable of changing 7 that behavior because he did. and then he chose 8 not to refrain from smoking anymore. 9 this was a man who knew how to accomplish 10 something when he really wanted to. not a little 11 bit, but totally. in every business venture he 12 embarked on, he planned, he organized, he 13 executed and he was successful. trucking, 14 fishing, electronics, restaurant, planned, 15 organized, executed successfully. and on 16 smoking, he did the same thing for a year. he 17 planned, he organized, he executed successfully. 18 do you see a plan here for the time period 19 between 1985 and 1993? planning, execution, 20 organization or do you see half-heartedness, lack 21 of commitment and lack of that word we heard 22 bandied about a lot the last couple of weeks, 23 motivation, or is it simply a choice to continue 24 to smoke? 25 you have got to want to quit for yourself. 1 you have got to insert yourself between the 2 addiction and the potential disease. you have got 3 to make your own decision. you have got to make 4 your own choices, for yourself not for somebody 5 else. mrs. gray wanted him to quit. his son 6 mickey wanted him to quit. his brother john 7 wanted him to quit and dr. martin wanted him to 8 quit. but can you really look at this chart and 9 conclude that in the period between '85 and '93 10 mr. gray wanted to quit? that he had the same 11 commitment that he did when he did quit? that he 12 could have honestly checked yes to the boxes in 13 dr. cummings' booklet? do i have what it takes 14 to quit smoking? 15 if you look at the facts rather than the 16 words, common sense dictates the answer. the 17 answer is no. he could quit smoking. he proved 18 it. he did it. but then he chose to continue to 19 smoke, not for the nicotine which was gone, not 20 because of brain receptors which were back to 21 normal, not because of withdrawal because he 22 never had anyway, not because of a relapse, but 23 because of choice, an exercise of freewill for 24 whatever reasons that were good and sufficient 25 for him. mr. gray accepted responsibility for 1 that choice to continue to smoke. 2 you did not hear any evidence in this case, 3 any testimony in this case that this was the kind 4 of guy who would seek to blame somebody else for 5 things that happen to him. in fact, every word 6 we heard suggested the opposite. this was a 7 stand-up guy. this was not a person who thought 8 themselves a victim. this lawsuit is trying to 9 turn him into a victim. 10 he absolutely knew he had lung cancer and 11 he absolutely knew it was caused by his 12 cigarettes, and he absolutely knew who 13 manufactured those cigarettes, but he never sued 14 them. i asked mrs. gray on the stand, he did not 15 file a suit, he did not talk about filing a suit. 16 this was not mr. gray's idea. 17 he accepted personal responsibility for his 18 actions. you are being asked to say he made his 19 choices, his choices were wrong and somebody else 20 should pay money for those choices. do not second 21 guess charles gray. he made his choices and 22 those choices resulted in his injuries and death, 23 not his addiction. 24 had he chosen to stay off those cigarettes, 25 he would have realized the benefits that 1 dr. burns talked about. he did not, and he did not 2 relapse either. he chose to continue to smoke. 3 he chose to accept personal responsibility. so 4 when you get to that first question on the 5 verdict form, i would ask you to check no. 6 now, the second point i talked to you about 7 in opening statement was the plaintiffs had to 8 build a bridge between mr. gray and r.j. 9 reynolds, that something reynolds did or did not 10 do caused mr. gray to do something. he had to 11 rely on some action of what reynolds did. 12 the question here is, did they build that 13 bridge by proof and by evidence between r.j. 14 reynolds and mr. gray? and the first point to be 15 made, i guess, is it is r.j. reynolds that is in 16 this courtroom today. you saw a lot of 17 documents, you saw a lot of people who work for 18 philip morris. you saw a lot of documents that 19 were internal to philip morris. the judge will 20 instruct you under the circumstances that you can 21 consider those documents and for what purposes. 22 dr. cummings spent a lot of time talking 23 about philip morris and the words philip morris 24 used. he used the term psychological crutch. he 25 showed you the document on psychological crutch, 1 but that was not a term used by reynolds. as we 2 saw, it was coming from an internal philip morris 3 document, and dr. cummings admitted it. it was 4 from a philip morris employee to a philip morris 5 employee in philip morris files. those are 6 philip morris words. not r.j. reynolds words. 7 he showed you a document, and in fact, you 8 saw it with mr. loehr in his closing, about the 9 best program for ctr. once again, a memo from a 10 philip morris employee to a philip morris 11 employee with a copy to a philip morris employee, 12 a document only found in philip morris files. 13 not reynolds words. 14 the mere fact that one of these authors may 15 have also held a job in the tobacco institute or 16 the tobacco institute research committee, that 17 does not turn philip morris files into reynolds 18 files or philip morris words into reynolds words. 19 mr. loehr: your honor, i object. that is 20 contrary to the jury instruction in this case. 21 the court: sustained. 22 mr. kaczynski: you saw some tv footage of 23 mr. bowling, a philip morris executive, on a 24 documentary about philip morris business. you will 25 be instructed the circumstances in which you can 1 consider this, but just bear in mind those were 2 not reynolds people. 3 so focusing on reynolds. how do they try 4 to build that bridge? two ways. advertising and 5 what dr. cummings called the 50 year cover-up. 6 we are going to take a look at both and oddly 7 enough dr. cummings is right there in the middle 8 of both. 9 when he switched to advertising, he took 10 off his addiction counselor cap and put on his 11 marketing and advertising cap. of course, he did 12 this without ever having a degree in marketing or 13 advertising, without having marketed anything 14 apart from advertising for the new york state 15 quit line. and what did he do? well, he showed 16 you a lot of pictures, some ads. he said that 17 cigarette ads during world war ii had military 18 themes, just like other products. 19 he showed you they used celebrities, just 20 like other products. around christmas they used 21 santa claus, just like other products. in fact, 22 you saw some in that life magazine article from 23 the issue in 1953 that came out just before 24 christmas. that proves nothing. 25 they showed you some pictures of ads from 1 doctors in the 1950s, but what he did not tell you 2 about is what the surgeon general's report in 3 1994 said about those ads. "with greater public 4 concern about cancer, however, these continuing 5 health claims, although intended to reassure 6 consumers, were very likely increasing consumer 7 awareness of the suspected risks of smoking." 8 they said articles of fortune was so riddled with 9 warnings, it appeals to fear that the cigarette 10 industry could think that it was an inside job. 11 those ads scared people. those ads reminded 12 people of the smoking and health issue. 13 he showed you the flintstones, but he 14 did not tell you until cross-examination that it 15 was supposed to be an adult comedy like the 16 family guy today. he did not tell you it was on 17 at night rather than on a saturday morning and he 18 did not tell you it ran in 1960 when mr. gray was 19 already 25 years old. 20 what does that have to do with mr. gray? 21 nothing. 22 he showed you two r.j. reynolds memos a 23 research and development scientist wrote to 24 marketing people. one was from claude teague. 25 one was from frank colby. but he had to admit 1 that in neither case did anything happen. you 2 can find no evidence that this was followed up on 3 in any way? no. unless you buy the idea that 4 was suggested yesterday that reynolds sat on this 5 idea for 30 years when they came out with camel 6 crush, unless you buy that, nothing happened and 7 it proves nothing. 8 he showed you some demographic information 9 from the national opinion organization. then he 10 had to admit it was collected for the company, 11 not specifically for the marketing department. 12 he admitted the company could not need information 13 like that for all variety of purposes other than 14 marketing, like knowing -- like for forecasting 15 purposes, like to know how much tobacco to buy, 16 what types of tobacco to buy, what types of 17 menthol or other flavorants to buy. having that 18 survey information proves nothing. 19 the fundamental point that he was trying to 20 make was that you have got to get a cigarette 21 smoker young because they are so brand loyal that 22 if you do not get them when they are young, you are 23 not going to get them at all. but the very 24 document that he was using undermined that 25 proposition. 3088 1 now, if you remember, he used only selected 2 pages from one particular reynolds document. 3 when i crossed him, i used the whole thing. and 4 in the whole thing, not the portion he had, it 5 talks about loyalty rates from the 1993 sds 6 percentage of smokers who smoke marlboro at age 7 18 still do. it shows that marlboro loses about 8 28 percent of its 18 years olds by age 20, and 9 another 14 percent by age 24. a total loss of 10 42 percent over that six-year period. they lose 11 almost half their smokers. that is not brand 12 loyalty. 13 so there is plenty of switching going on 14 here. at the end of the day all this marketing 15 stuff comes back to the question i asked you to 16 ask yourself right in the beginning. what does 17 any of that stuff have to do with charles gray? 18 and the answer is nothing. 19 to claim he was exposed to an ad, the 20 wallpaper theory you heard from dr. cummings, is 21 not to say he relied on it or he chose to smoke 22 or not to smoke based on it. there were no ads 23 for the roll your owns that he started smoking 24 with his brother and their friends. if you want 25 to blame somebody for him starting smoking, blame 1 the hayes boys. they are the ones that john gray 2 said gave them the roll your own materials back 3 when they were young. 4 and there is no testimony whatsoever, no 5 testimony whatsoever about why after that he 6 chose the brands he chose. none. 7 in fact, the only testimony about mr. gray 8 and advertising is that he was not likely to be 9 influenced by it. this is from his former 10 son-in-law who knew him very well. he was smart. 11 there were a lot of ads out there and mr. gray 12 probably saw some. so what? so what? they 13 needed to prove reliance and they did not. they 14 needed proof and they did not have it. and 15 dr. cummings' wallpaper theory will not make up for 16 that. 17 so did advertising have anything to do with 18 charles gray? it did not. it is one of those 19 bridges to nowhere. 20 last we come to the so-called 50 year 21 cover-up that dr. cummings talked about and, of 22 course, dr. cummings was the heart of this 23 testimony too. the first question we should ask 24 him, exactly what it is that was covered up, and 25 he says it was what was known about the health 1 risks of smoking and the addictive nature of 2 cigarettes. those are the primary things that 3 were covered up. 4 the question you have to ask yourself is 5 whether there was something that reynolds knew 6 that mr. gray did not or could not that would have 7 made a difference to him. and common sense is 8 going to be the simplest answer to this question. 9 you heard testimony that every time 10 mrs. gray talked to mr. gray about his smoking or 11 telling him that he ought to quit, did he ever 12 argue with her? did he ever say, no, the tobacco 13 industry research committee says it is okay; no, 14 the tobacco institute says it is okay; no, r.j. 15 reynolds says it is okay. 16 take a look at the first one. when you 17 told him he should quit smoking, he never argued 18 with you saying smoking was harmless or smoking 19 was safe? no. he never told you he heard 20 something from, say, the tobacco institute that 21 said smoking was safe, right? no. 22 then there is a question, the next one. 23 mrs. gray remembered when the surgeon general's 24 report came out in 1964 and she remembers when 25 the warning labels came out. and she pointed out 1 the warning labels to her husband. you remember 2 calling your husband's attention to the warning 3 labels on cigarette packs? yes. and he did not 4 argue and say this is meaningless or anything 5 like that, did he? i do not remember any response 6 he made. 7 now, if he had reacted as his brother john 8 did that this is a lot of bull, do not you think 9 you would have heard about it? 10 finally, and this is the best one. while 11 you were on the road, you suspected he was 12 smoking, he was driving all hours of the day and 13 night. it is boring out on the road, he might 14 have been smoking, right? yes. and at some 15 point you said to him, i do not think you ought to 16 be smoking, right? i probably did, yes. and his 17 response was, i know. i know. he did not argue 18 because he knew. 19 and then when you had the instance with his 20 son mickey, what about addiction with his son 21 mickey. this, again, is the best evidence of 22 all. his son mickey was caught with candy 23 cigarettes. he told mickey not to smoke. he 24 told him that if he did smoke, he would not be 25 able to stop, and he must have made a strong 1 impression because mickey never became a smoker. 2 now, should not that be the end of the 3 inquiry? i mean, does not this prove they have 4 not built that bridge? the evidence was 5 undisputed that mr. gray was intelligent, that he 6 read the newspaper, that he watched the evening 7 news, and he never argued with mrs. gray about 8 his smoking because he was aware of the risks of 9 smoking. 10 he took those candy cigarettes away from 11 his son saying if you start, it would be tough to 12 stop. he may not have understood the term 13 addiction, but he certainly understood the 14 concept way back in 1963. 15 this is the only proof in the case, not 16 dr. cummings' wallpaper. there is no evidence, 17 and dr. cummings admitted he does not have any 18 either, that mr. gray relied on anything that the 19 cigarette industry did. there is none. no 20 direct evidence. 21 but we have this evidence that when 22 confronted with his behavior, he did not assert 23 as a defense, well, i know, regardless of the 24 source, he did not say, well, i know this is not 25 harmful, i do not believe this is harmful. he 1 said, i know. 2 this is the only evidence in the case on 3 this issue, and i would suggest that this is the 4 evidence you should rest your verdict on on this 5 issue. there is no evidence that mr. gray relied 6 on anything that anybody in the cigarette 7 industry said. he told his wife he knew. they 8 have not built that bridge. 9 okay. so what was covered up? let us take 10 a look at the health risks of smoking. let us 11 start by seeing what was known and this is going 12 to be kind of a lightning round through the '30s, 13 '40s, '50s and '60s. next one, time magazine 14 coffin nails in 1938. smoking associated with 15 longevity. reader's digest articles throughout 16 the '30s and '40s. 17 next, chain smoker for years. coffin nail. 18 reader's digest, 1954. reader's digest on 19 smoking and health throughout the 1950s. smoking 20 and cancer in time magazine from 1952 to 1959. 21 next, pensacola journal coverage of the lung 22 cancer studies in 1954 and 1957. 23 next, reader's digest kicked off the 1950s 24 with this article. january 1950, how harmful are 25 cigarettes? was anybody paying attention to this 1 stuff? they reran the article, saying the 2 subject of this article in january aroused more 3 discussion and approval than any recent magazine 4 feature. 5 next, smoking and cancer in time in 1953, 6 epidemiological studies. beyond any doubt, skin 7 painting in 1953 in time magazine. in life 8 magazine. you saw the actual magazine. of 9 course, broadcast into people's living rooms on 10 see it now. 11 next, hammond and horn, the 1954 studies in 12 magazines. in the columbus ledger, columbus 13 being the area where mr. gray grew up and the 14 paper they took. were people paying attention? 15 george gallup says yes. 16 george gallup, as you heard from the 17 polling expert, dr. geer, they would not be 18 polling on an issue. they had limited resources. 19 polling was in its infancy in these days. they 20 only had the resources to poll on issues of major 21 public interest. this was one. 22 have you heard or read anything recently to 23 the effect that cigarette smoking may be a cause 24 of cancer of the lung? ninety percent said yes. now 25 there was some suggestion to say, oh, they are 1 reacting to the frank statement because that was 2 out in january. june 1954 is when the first 3 american cancer society results came out. do not 4 think it is a coincidence. 5 next, 1955 see it now. you saw clips from 6 two half-hour shows consecutive weeks. the 7 experts began to get together and compare notes 8 in 1957 and those results were published all over 9 the country. 1957 hammond and horn report came 10 out in this time magazine coverage of it. were 11 people paying attention to that? we know they 12 were. 77 percent had heard about that very 13 specific study. not something by the tobacco 14 institute, but that very specific study. 15 next, smoking and cancer continue. this is 16 the first government study. they studied what 17 was referred to as the veteran study. they 18 studied the insurance records of world war i 19 veterans and they found as the others did that 20 smokers got lung cancer more often than 21 nonsmokers. 22 next, the question then becomes were people 23 paying attention? was the information out there? 24 was it widespread or was it some special need to 25 go above and beyond the publicity to get the 1 message out? dr. hammond said, no. in my 2 opinion, people should be warned of the danger 3 and they are being warned of the danger. 4 next, the surgeon general of the united 5 states 1957. "our position is that we have 6 informed the public through the excellent 7 coverage of the press, radio and tv." and the 8 director of the national cancer institute, 9 "newspapers, radio, tv and the other media have 10 done an excellent job covering this problem and a 11 very objective job. this is an exceedingly 12 valuable way of informing the public." 13 and the american medical association, "the 14 health hazards of excessive smoking have been 15 well-publicized for more than ten years and are 16 common knowledge. labeling will not alert even 17 the young cigarette smoker to any risks of which 18 he is not already aware." 19 okay. back to the coverage. the 1960s, 20 reader's digest. lung cancer and cigarettes, 21 what are the latest findings. royal college of 22 physicians in britain is covered in reader's 23 digest and is covered in the pensacola journal, 24 which also covered it for the appointment, as you 25 see in the title, on the surgeon general's 1 committee on smoking and health. that was 1962 2 and then a year and a half later in 1964 the 3 surgeon general's report came out. 4 when it did, it was front page news in 5 pensacola. it was reported in magazines across 6 the nation. a special report was broadcast on 7 nbc, abc and cbs. that was watched by mrs. gray. 8 and then we had warning labels. the 1966 label, 9 the 1970 label and the rotating warnings in 1985. 10 warnings that dr. burns called clear -- 11 clear warnings, concise message and a frequent 12 message. it is a message that -- this is the 13 message that mrs. gray pointed out to her 14 husband. warnings that were covered in the 15 pensacola paper. warnings that were on every 16 single pack of cigarettes he smoked from 1966 17 forward. 18 cover-up? consider what dr. daniel horn 19 said. dr. horn along with dr. hammond were in 20 charge of those studies that were released by the 21 cancer society in 1954 and 1957. he became the 22 head of the federal government's national 23 clearinghouse on smoking and health. he said in 24 1968, "you could stand on a rooftop and shout 25 smoking is dangerous at the top of your lungs, 1 and you would not be telling anyone anything they 2 did not already know." 3 so what was covered up? well, let us go 4 back to claude teague's memo. of course, this 5 has been pointed out. this is not original 6 research. this was stuff in the library. the 7 majority of these or a large part of these being 8 by dr. raffo from argentina written just before 9 or during world war ii. this stuff was on 10 library shelves, but nowhere in this memo does he 11 conclude that smoking causes cancer. 12 what else? well, dr. cummings said the 13 meetings with hill & knowlton in 1953 and the 14 formation of tirc, later tcr, were part of the 15 cover-up because they were done in secret, that 16 the companies really believed smoking caused lung 17 cancer and this was a humongous fraud, the frank 18 statement was a lie, the frank statement 19 reassured smokers. 20 let us take those one at a time. secret: 21 he did not tell you on direct examination, but on 22 cross-examination, it turned out that the 23 government was informed of the formation of tirc. 24 the government was informed that hill & knowlton 25 had been employed as a public relations agency 1 and the government was informed that legal 2 counsel were involved in guiding the tirc. the 3 formation of it was no secret. 4 did they really believe that smoking caused 5 lung cancer? here is a document that 6 dr. cummings concealed from you. this is another 7 hill & knowlton document i showed him on 8 cross-examination. the hill & knowlton person 9 said, they point out that the national cancer 10 institute of the u.s. public health 11 administration, which is a government agency and 12 supported by congressional appropriations, has 13 officially refuted the tie-up between cigarette 14 smoking and cancer. that is the report they were 15 referring to. 16 what did they conclude? "the association 17 between cigarette smoking and lung cancer seems 18 real. the significance remains unestablished." 19 the other conclusions, "the etiological 20 significance of these associations remains 21 unestablished." he did not tell you about that 22 until cross-examination. 23 was the frank statement a lie? first 24 paragraph talks about the reports on the mouse 25 skin painting with wide publicity. he said, 1 well, that is true. next, "although conducted by 2 doctors of professional standing, these 3 experiments are not regarded as conclusive in the 4 field of cancer research." at that point 5 dr. hammond agreed with that, dr. mayo of the 6 mayo clinic agreed with that, and dr. heller, the 7 director of the national cancer institute agreed 8 with that, that they were not conclusive. 9 next, "however, we do not believe that any 10 serious medical research, even though its results 11 are inconclusive, should be disregarded or 12 lightly dismissed." he called that a responsible 13 statement. that is the frank statement. 14 now, he says that tirc and ctr was a fraud, 15 a gimmick. well, let us look at some facts. tirc 16 funded the green monster, the key research source 17 for the 1964 surgeon general's report. they have 18 funded seven nobel prize winners. they have 19 funded thousands of research grants, including 20 many grants to universities right here in the 21 state of florida, resulting in thousands of 22 articles published in peer-reviewed journals. 23 they resulted in studies that were cited like 600 24 times in surgeon general's reports. 25 not related to smoking and health? let us 1 take a look. this is an article in the journal 2 of psychiatry from 1963 on addiction and nicotine 3 that was cited in the 1988 surgeon general's 4 report on nicotine addiction. it seems pretty 5 related to smoking and health. dr. cummings 6 did not show you that either. 7 another thing that you heard was a secret 8 that reynolds kept, benzopyrene was in cigarette 9 smoke or there were carcinogens in cigarette 10 smoke. was it a cover-up? it was in reader's 11 digest in 1950 that benzopyrene was in cigarette 12 smoke. 13 did reynolds know something the public 14 did not about constituents? november 1959, 15 reynolds internal, eight of the polycyclic 16 hydrocarbons isolated from the smoke are known to 17 produce cancer in mice. this is private. 18 public, the coming chemistry discusses, 19 last sentence, eight carcinogenic polycyclics in 20 tobacco smoke and they are on the trail of others. 21 same thing. he showed you an incomplete 22 draft of a memo by dr. rodgman. the version he 23 showed you actually ended in midsentence. it was 24 six pages long and ended in midsentence. what he 25 did not show you but i did on cross-examination 1 was the complete version that was 24 pages, and 2 he distorted it a bit by what was in the memo. 3 in his version, there is one sentence in the 4 paragraph. that is it. in this version, look at 5 the size of the paragraph that follows it. he 6 left a lot out that qualifies what he read to 7 you. 8 you know, there is more than this. i think 9 this kind of makes the point. you saw and you 10 can read in the jury room all the newspaper 11 articles, all the magazine articles. you can 12 watch see it now. you can watch like mrs. gray 13 did on the reports of the '64 surgeon general's 14 report. 15 the notion that these isolated appearances 16 by tobacco institute personnel on some random 17 news shows or in front of congress, which might 18 not have even been covered, somehow negated this 19 barrage of publicity we just ran through, that is 20 just against common sense. 21 again, remember when mrs. gray confronted 22 mr. gray about his smoking, he did not argue. he 23 said i know. now we can see how he knew. he got 24 the message. 25 did mr. gray rely on anything that r.j. 1 reynolds said? no. that is another bridge to 2 nowhere. 3 addiction: dr. cummings says the addictive 4 nature of smoking was covered up. you saw quite 5 a different story. 6 dr. benowitz, nicotine occurs naturally in 7 the tobacco plant. it is been known for over 100 8 years that nicotine is in tobacco. it is been 9 known for 100 years that nicotine has a 10 pharmacological effect on the human body. people 11 have known for hundreds of years that using 12 tobacco could be difficult to quit. 13 you saw that even before cigarettes were 14 popular the notion that tobacco was addictive was 15 well known. john quincy adams knew it in 1845, 16 even uses the word addicted. 17 the state of florida knew it and publicized 18 it in 1906. you see the term addiction referring 19 to cigarettes. this is even before r.j. reynolds 20 was even formed. 21 surgeon general reports reported the 22 scientists were comparing nicotine to hard drugs 23 as long ago as the 1920s and 1930s. and then we 24 run through reader's digest 1935 -- back up, 25 1935. you say you were a slave to this drug. 1 next, wrestling with an addiction, 1938. 2 next, 1941, comparing the lift you get from a 3 cigarette to the reaction you get from cocaine, 4 heroin or marijuana. 5 next, 1950, nicotine is the essential 6 ingredient of tobacco. it is what makes tobacco 7 tobacco and not just another weed. 8 next, it talks about the original urge is 9 purely psychological. soon the psychological 10 urge is reinforced by a pharmacological urge, the 11 true physical craving for tobacco. 1952, long 12 before the surgeon general's report on nicotine. 13 newsweek, smoking is a serious sort of drug 14 addiction with a real psychological basis. 1964, 15 the surgeon general's report summed it up. "it 16 has psychological and social drives, reinforced, 17 perpetuated by the pharmacological acts of 18 nicotine on the central nervous system." 19 you saw the newspaper coverage on the great 20 america smoke-out. pensacola, you saw ads for 21 noncharlatan smoking cessation clinics in 22 hospitals. all this was known. dr. benowitz 23 says it is been known for over 100 years. 24 what exactly was concealed that mr. gray 25 could not know about in the concept of addiction? 3105 1 well, they showed you over and over again that 2 1994 clip of the ceos in front of congress when 3 they refused to use the word addiction. in 4 particular you saw the reynolds ceo was cut off 5 when he started talking about the 1964 6 definition. even dr. cummings conceded that 7 that is what happened. 8 mr. johnston, using the '64 definition, 9 cigarette smoking is not addiction, it is a habit, 10 right? they called it a habit. the last word 11 out of mr. johnston's mouth was intoxication. he 12 was talking about the '64 surgeon general's 13 definition of addiction. a difference of opinion 14 over a definition is hardly a cover-up. 15 but the heart of this cover-up, the most 16 cynical part of this case is the argument that 17 reynolds was trying to figure out how much 18 nicotine a smoker wants in order to keep them 19 addicted. cynical and it is false. 20 let me bring you back to the war against 21 tar i talked about in opening. tar was the 22 culprit. something in tar causes cancer. tar 23 was the target. tar had to be lowered. and it 24 was lowered by something like sixty percent. but 25 those low tar cigarettes did not have much of a 1 market. smokers would not smoke them. 2 so scientists from both sides of the 3 atlantic, dr. michael russell, dr. richard sir 4 doll, dr. gio gori of the national cancer 5 institute, they advocated lowering tar as much as 6 possible while maintaining an acceptable level of 7 nicotine. 8 you heard about that from dr. figlar and 9 even dr. cummings admitted that that happened and 10 that was the theory for why that happened. 11 the challenge for the companies was to 12 figure out what was that level of nicotine. it 13 was discussed in surgeon general's reports. 14 a threshold value for acceptability of the 15 consumer, 1981 surgeon general's report. next, 16 it is important to determine the lowest ratios 17 that still produce a satisfying cigarette. 18 that is not coming from claude teague. that is not 19 coming from a r.j. reynolds internal document. 20 that is coming from the surgeon general of the 21 united states. and that is what dr. teague was 22 doing in the 1970s with those memos. 23 next, please. i'm sorry, go back. find a 24 level of nicotine where they would not smoke 25 more, not switch to a higher tar cigarette in the 1 same year that dr. russell and others, including 2 the surgeon general we saw here, were advocating 3 such a thing. 4 the challenge was to find that level of 5 nicotine, not to hook people, but to follow these 6 recommendations, to determine the lowest ratios 7 that still produced the satisfying cigarette as 8 the surgeon general said. his words, not 9 reynolds. a less harmful cigarette that smokers 10 would actually smoke. 11 you heard from dr. figlar that whole effort 12 did not work. in the end the war against tar 13 became the war against nicotine and documents 14 like claude teague's became trial exhibits all 15 over the country. and i will concede that 16 dr. teague used some stupid language on occasion. 17 and it is the stupidity of that language that 18 makes the document so attractive as trial 19 exhibits. 20 but the bottom line is all that effort was 21 trying to do with the surgeon general and 22 prominent scientists were suggesting, lower the 23 exposure of smokers to harmful substances not to 24 keep them addicted. even dr. benowitz agrees 25 that he would not criticize a company for pursuing 1 research like that. 2 in the end all of this is a side show. 3 what reynolds was doing or not doing had nothing 4 to do with charles gray. there is no evidence he 5 heard any of it. even if you buy dr. cummings' 6 wallpaper theory that somehow, somewhere at some 7 time and some place mr. gray somehow heard 8 something that someone from the tobacco institute 9 or any other industry organization said, there is 10 no evidence that he relied on it. none, zero. 11 and nothing that came out of dr. cummings' mouth 12 filled that gap. he cannot create reliance where 13 it does not exist. 14 to the contrary the evidence here is that 15 when he was confronted with his smoking behavior 16 by the person closest to him, he never, ever, 17 ever defended his smoking behavior by saying, 18 well, it is really not that bad; it is not going to 19 hurt me; it has not been proven it causes cancer; 20 any such thing. never, not once. 21 what did he say? he said, i know. and he 22 did know. he knew and he did not rely. there is 23 no proof, no evidence, no building materials for 24 a bridge in this courtroom. no proof that he had 25 relied on it and you have to check no on question 1 four on the verdict form. 2 there are five questions on the verdict 3 form and i'm arguing here you should never get to 4 question five because question five deals with 5 punitive damages. if you get to question five, 6 you will have already on the form fully 7 compensated mrs. gray for her loss. 8 question five is not about compensation for 9 loss. question five is about more money. if you 10 check question five, you will come back on monday 11 to see how much more money you will be giving 12 mrs. gray. 13 punitive damages, damages designed to 14 punish, damages for conduct that is tantamount to 15 reckless disregard for human life, and you have 16 to meet a higher standard of proof, the judge 17 will tell you about it, clear and convincing 18 evidence. obviously we are here arguing they have 19 proven no such thing. 20 punish reynolds? well, you heard that 21 reynolds engaged in a 50 year effort to make 22 safer cigarettes through all those various forms. 23 and they did reduce tar and nicotine in 24 mr. gray's winston. 25 yesterday mr. loehr asked dr. figlar 1 several times, do you have an addiction reduction 2 program? have you ever had a nicotine reduction 3 program? well, here it is. the bottom line. 4 when tar comes down, nicotine comes down. 5 there is some isolated years, and you heard about 6 it from dr. cummings where nicotine might have 7 went up, but the overall picture for mr. gray's 8 smoking history is it is gone down. it is gone 9 down and when tar goes down, nicotine goes down. 10 there is your nicotine reduction program. 11 reynolds cooperated with the federal 12 government in the tobacco working group. they 13 worked to develop a less hazardous cigarette, and 14 the important part is it was not just they 15 cooperated. the cooperation was directed by the 16 president of the company. 17 take a look. if there is a safer 18 cigarette -- they never wrote anything about 19 health, they never wrote anything about people's 20 health -- if there is a safer cigarette, this is 21 the president, let us continue and increase our 22 efforts in the program. please prepare a plan to 23 carry it out. 24 and the interesting thing is this memo went 25 to dr. murray senkus. yesterday you heard a lot 1 of quotes from a speech of dr. senkus saying, we 2 were not interested in helping people's health. 3 we did it for health reasons. we did it because 4 of market share. well, the president of the 5 company told him to do it and he told him to do 6 it to get a safer cigarette. 7 this is not the kind of document that is not 8 written, intended to be a trial exhibit. the 9 president of the company did not write this in 10 1968 thinking it would be a trial exhibit in the 11 year 2010. 12 this is what he directed his subordinates 13 to do, to cooperate to try to do a safer 14 cigarette. about a safer cigarette, not about 15 market share. 16 reynolds scientists published articles. 17 they attended conferences. they gave talks about 18 reynolds product development efforts. you heard 19 that from dr. figlar yesterday. 20 they made a revolutionary break-through in 21 the '80s with premier. incredible reductions. 22 we have been hearing about benzo(a)pyrene for weeks 23 now, 99 percent reduction. tobacco specific 24 nitrosamines, ninety percent and above reduction. 25 benzene, 92 percent of reduction. this was not 1 done -- this was done specifically to try to get 2 down the harmful constituents in cigarette smoke. 3 it was heated instead of burned tobacco. 4 it was endorsed, as you saw yesterday, by 5 dr. michael russell of great britain. he had a 6 long-standing interest in premier. he thought it 7 had tremendous potential for low risk long-term 8 nicotine use. the response to it in this country 9 was political and irrational. he writes because 10 it would be very sad if reynolds were to abandon 11 further development of such a valuable product. 12 well, reynolds did not let dr. russell down 13 because next came eclipse. it is on the market 14 today. again, tremendous reductions, not as deep 15 as premier, but tremendous reductions in 16 nitrosamines, benzene and any number of the 17 suspect compounds that are in cigarette smoke. 18 on the market today. 19 is this reckless disregard for human life? 20 well, dr. benowitz does not think so. he is 21 testified here there was some research conference 22 at duke to look at eclipse as a harm reduction 23 strategy with smoking, right? sponsored by 24 reynolds and duke? i guess so. and following 25 the conference, am i correct that it was your 1 opinion that most participants at the conference 2 agreed that a eclipse is less likely to be 3 harmful than smoking regular cigarettes with 4 respect to cancer and lung disease, although 5 there may be no impact on risk of heart disease? 6 yes, less harmful than smoking regular cigarettes 7 with respect to cancer and lung disease. 8 dr. benowitz having good things to say about 9 eclipse. this is not a reckless disregard for 10 human life. 11 and finally something you also heard from 12 dr. benowitz. targacept. reynolds developed and 13 refreshed and spun off a company that did work 14 and is doing work on pharmaceuticals using 15 nicotine in treating alzheimer's and parkinson's 16 disease. 17 this is not a reckless disregard for human 18 life. dr. benowitz agrees. would you agree with 19 the bottom line point, dr. benowitz, that using 20 the nicotine related research that reynolds did 21 to try to develop therapeutic products that are 22 interactive nicotine receptors, is that good 23 research to be done? i think it could be 24 valuable, yes. 25 ladies and gentlemen, this is not a record 1 that indicates indifference to human life. it is 2 not a record that warrants an award of punitive 3 damages. so when you get to question five on the 4 verdict form, i'm asking you to check no. 5 wrapping up. by all accounts, ladies and 6 gentlemen, mr. gray was a smart and decent and 7 honorable man. he made choices throughout his 8 life. he accepted the consequences for them. 9 some of those choices related to smoking. he 10 chose to smoke with his brother with roll your 11 own that he got from the hayes boys. we should 12 respect that choice. 13 he chose to continue to smoke. he made 14 that choice every day, every time he opened a 15 package of cigarettes, a choice he made for the 16 last 28 years of his life staring at a warning 17 label in his face, a warning label that dr. burns 18 called clear, concise and frequent. 19 he made that choice to continue to smoke 20 after quitting for a year. and we know that that 21 choice was not made because of nicotine, because 22 the nicotine was out of his system, because of 23 brain receptors, because they were back to 24 normal, and because of withdrawal, because he 25 actually had no withdrawal; and if he had had it, 1 the symptoms would long since be gone. 2 this was a choice that dr. keefe says was 3 the cause of his death, his choice. we should 4 also respect his choice to accept personal 5 responsibility. he did not file a lawsuit. we 6 should respect that choice as well. 7 charles gray was not a victim during his 8 life. you should not make him a victim in his 9 death. 10 this is the only chance i get to speak to 11 you. mr. loehr, representing the plaintiff, with 12 the burden of proof, will get an opportunity for 13 rebuttal. i would ask, however, since i cannot 14 respond to what he is going to say, that one of 15 you serve as my advocate in the jury room and 16 perhaps for discussion sake answer him as you 17 think i would. 18 again, i thank you for your service. i 19 thank you for your attention. and once again we 20 just could not do it without you. thank you very 21 much.
