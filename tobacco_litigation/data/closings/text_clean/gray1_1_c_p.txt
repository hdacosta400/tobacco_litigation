7 mr. loehr: may it please the court, 8 counsel, and ladies and gentlemen of the jury. 9 we have been together for several weeks now and 10 it is been a real pleasure, and i hope you have 11 appreciated the way this case has been tried by 12 both sides. it is quite obvious here that the 13 stakes are very high. 14 closing argument is a time when we get a 15 little bit more adversarial than we have been in 16 the past. i'm sure i speak for mr. kaczynski 17 when i say nothing i say here this morning is 18 meant as any sort of a slight to the defense 19 counsel in this case. they have all been 20 extremely -- they are extremely talented, 21 competent, and they have done an excellent job of 22 presenting their case. 23 that being said, it is now your job as 24 jurors to decide right from wrong in this case, 25 to take a look at all the evidence that you have 1 seen. you have got to decide truth from lies, 2 sense from nonsense, reality from illusion. 3 you have heard a lot that goes into all those 4 categories in the last several weeks. 5 you will actually reach your decision with 6 a verdict form that i'm going to show you in a 7 minute. the verdict form simply asks you a 8 number of questions. you will go back into a room, 9 quiet by yourselves, nobody knows what goes on, 10 no court reporter, and you will do justice as 11 jurors have been doing for over 1,200 years in 12 our system, for 1,000 years over in new england 13 before we brought the system here with us. 14 the case really boils down to some simple 15 issues. we walked into the courtroom and 16 actually when we filed our complaint, carolyn 17 gray admitted that her husband made choices, that 18 those choices contributed to his death and that 19 he is responsible for those choices. there will 20 be a place on the verdict form for you to address 21 that. but r.j. reynolds in this case claims 22 they are blameless. they claim that you should 23 put a zero next to the spot on the verdict form 24 for them. 25 it is very important as we go through this 3019 1 that we understand what the law is regarding what 2 caused charles gray's death because it is very, 3 very different from what you heard from dr. keefe 4 on behalf of the defendants. 5 in fact, the first question on the verdict 6 form, if i can have the elmo. the first question 7 is, was addiction to r.j. reynolds tobacco 8 company cigarettes a legal cause of the death of 9 charles gray? 10 so you have to ask yourself, number one, 11 what does legal cause mean and how does it play 12 into a case like this? you will be instructed, 13 you will be given specific instructions by the 14 court on that issue. 15 we talked about this at the very beginning 16 in jury selection. i gave you an example that 17 i'm going to repeat here in just a moment. 18 "addiction is a legal cause of death if it 19 directly and in a natural and continuous sequence 20 produces or contributes substantially to 21 producing such death, so that it can reasonably 22 be said that but for the addiction to cigarettes 23 containing nicotine, the death would not have 24 occurred." 25 if it directly and in a natural and 1 continuous sequence produces or contributes 2 substantially to producing the death. but that is 3 not the end of the instruction. 4 "in order to be regarded as a legal cause 5 of death, addiction need not be the only cause. 6 addiction may be a legal cause of death even 7 though it operates in combination with the act of 8 another or some other cause, if such other cause 9 occurs at the same time as the addiction and the 10 addiction contributes substantially to producing 11 such death." 12 i will talk about that more in a few 13 minutes, but it is very important to keep that in 14 mind because addiction combined with charles 15 gray's choices did cause his death. the two of 16 them combined together. he never would have 17 gotten there without both of them. we will talk 18 about that more in a few minutes. 19 but that is the way our law has evolved. 20 we talked in jury selection about the fact that 21 we used to have a law in florida that says if a 22 drunk driver was careening down the road in a 23 residential neighborhood doing 60 miles an hour, 24 someone came from a side street, a horrendous 25 accident occurred and the person coming from the 1 side street was killed, everybody recognized that 2 the drunk driver should be held legally 3 responsible. but our old law in florida said if 4 that person rolled through a stop sign, if that 5 person did anything wrong, one percent wrong, 6 then the drunk driver got off scot-free. 7 it was called contributory negligence, any 8 contributory negligence and it absolved the other 9 person of any responsibility. our law has done 10 away with that now. 11 we have changed entirely to a comparative 12 negligence analysis that was just shown to you 13 that says it recognizes real life. it recognizes 14 reality. it recognizes that life is difficult. 15 it is messy, it is sloppy. and sometimes it is 16 wonderful, sometimes it is not, and most of the 17 time things are complicated. they happen for 18 various reasons. they are not black and white. 19 they are not cut and dried. it is not simple cause 20 and effect. things combine together to bring 21 about results, and our law says the question that 22 you have to answer is whether addiction was a 23 substantial contributing factor to the death of 24 charles gray. 25 would he ever have died of lung cancer if 1 he had not been addicted to cigarettes? and we will 2 go through that in more detail as we go along. 3 you will be instructed by the court there 4 are several findings that help you answer that 5 first question. one finding is that charles gray 6 was, in fact, addicted to cigarettes containing 7 nicotine and that his smoking of cigarettes was 8 the medical cause of his death. those are not 9 issues here. nobody is claiming he died of 10 anything else. believe it or not nobody is 11 claiming he died of bladder cancer or that the 12 bladder cancer would have done anything to 13 shorten his life in any way, shape or form. 14 those are not even issues in this case. 15 to begin to look at this case, you have to 16 do something that is very difficult and that is 17 you have to envision america as it existed way 18 back in the '30s, '40s, '50s, times when i 19 certainly was not here, times when things were 20 different. then you have to take yourself into a 21 little rural town called smith station, alabama 22 just outside the bigger town of phenix city, 23 alabama to a place where charles gray was born 24 and grew up. if we could see gra521.28. 25 you have seen the photograph of the kind of 1 humble beginnings of charles gray with his family 2 back in alabama. they had some animals, lived in 3 a very rural setting. his life was simpler, but 4 in some ways it was very, very different than it 5 is now. 6 eighty percent of the people born in the 7 era of charles gray, nearly eighty percent, dr. burns 8 said 79 percent of them became regular cigarette 9 smokers. far different than it is now. the vast 10 majority of them started very young, just like 11 charles gray did. 12 it is a different place. we would be 13 smoking in the courtroom right now. doctors 14 smoked in their offices. there were no 15 nonsmoking areas anywhere. women were not smoking 16 as heavily then as now. they took up the habit a 17 little bit later. but in order to envision the 18 choices that charles gray made, it is only fair to 19 look at him in the context that he grew up. 20 to assist you in answering that first 21 question whether addiction was a legal cause of 22 charles gray's loss, we brought into the 23 courtroom what you would have to conclude were 24 the most qualified men anywhere, the most 25 qualified doctors, both medical doctors and a 1 ph.d. on public health to tell you what they have 2 told physician's groups all over the world, to 3 give you the same kind of information that they 4 lecture about routinely, to give you the same 5 kind of information that they have written about 6 in scientific studies. 7 dr. benowitz was the first witness, a full 8 professor at the university of california in san 9 francisco. he is authored over 350 peer-reviewed 10 articles, vast majority of them dealing with the 11 issues of nicotine addiction. over 70 book 12 chapters. he was the editor of the 1988 surgeon 13 general's report on addiction. he is lectured all 14 over the world. i read a long list of them, 15 throughout europe. i think he lectured in china. 16 i'm not sure even how you do that, but he did. 17 he is consulted with the world health 18 organization, national cancer institute, national 19 institutes of health. 20 he took the stand and he gave and showed 21 you the very same things that he tells anyone, 22 the patients that he treated and the doctors that 23 he teaches, the public health officials that he 24 teaches. 25 dr. cummings took the stand. a ph.d. in 1 public health. he runs one of the largest 2 cessation clinics around up in new york. the 3 attorney general of the state of new york chose 4 him to be the recipient of all the documents that 5 came from the tobacco institute, the group that 6 was formed years ago to carry out the wishes of 7 the tobacco industry and serve as their public 8 relations arm. 9 dr. cummings has written over 250 10 peer-reviewed articles. he, too, has contributed 11 to multiple surgeon general reports. 12 then david burns took the stand, professor 13 of medicine, now in emeritus status at the 14 university of california at san diego. dr. burns 15 has authored over 150 peer-reviewed articles. 16 he is written the two articles on nicotine 17 addiction and its effects in the leading internal 18 medicine textbooks that are used in virtually 19 every medical school in the united states. he 20 studied from them when he was a medical student 21 at harvard, and now medical students at harvard 22 read his words on nicotine addiction and its 23 effects. 24 not surprisingly, these men are often 25 called upon to provide testimony to juries just 1 like you. who else would you have us bring? is 2 there anyone else that you have seen or heard in 3 any of this trial that would be more prepared to 4 tell you -- and what did they each tell you? a 5 consistent story. 6 dr. benowitz did not give an opinion about 7 mr. gray individually. he just taught us 8 generally about addiction. both dr. cummings and 9 dr. burns told you with no hesitation, no doubt 10 whatsoever that addiction was not only a 11 contributing cause of charles gray's death, but 12 addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine was 13 the overwhelming cause of his death. they used 14 words like it drove his smoking. they used words 15 like it clearly was a heavy contributing factor. 16 he would not have died without it. 17 and it all makes sense when you think about 18 it, and when you look at what they told you and 19 what we all knew anyway before we even came in 20 about addiction. 21 if we could see visual number two, please. 22 it is common sense, but each of these witnesses 23 who have spent their life studying it agreed that 24 this is what happens. you start out with 25 experimentation of a drug that has an addictive 1 quality. as you move further and further along, 2 you get to where you are using it regularly. then 3 you finally get to a point where you are using it 4 every day. every step along that way you are 5 beginning to lose some of the control that you 6 have. 7 now, let me make it clear from the outset. 8 no witness for the plaintiff's side, and it never 9 came out of my mouth, told you it is impossible to 10 quit smoking. that is sort of something that the 11 defense has built up so that they can knock it 12 down and act like they won on an issue. 13 we never told you it was impossible to quit 14 smoking. none of our witnesses said it was 15 impossible to quit smoking. if it was, we 16 would not have admitted that charles gray shares 17 in the blame for his death. 18 but your control is affected. you start 19 losing some of your control. it is no longer a 20 free choice and your chance of relapse goes up 21 and up and up. these are not my words. they are 22 words of men who have written over 800 23 peer-reviewed articles on these very issues. 24 if we could go to number three, please, 25 ryan. they explained to you why, especially dr. 1 benowitz, took a lot of time explaining the brain 2 changes that go on with nicotine addiction, just 3 like any other drug, anything that causes 4 dependence, that causes addiction sets off things 5 in the brain. it sets off the release of brain 6 hormones in the reward centers of the brain. 7 those brain hormones after you do it time 8 and time and time and time and time and time 9 again, the brain starts trying to regulate 10 itself. it turns down the release of those 11 hormones striving for normality which causes 12 tolerance. 13 there is another part of your brain that 14 wants that feeling. that is why they are 15 addictive. that is why it works. so you start 16 smoking more or you start using more heroin or 17 you start drinking more. what that brings about 18 is when you try to stop, when you try to stop the 19 drug, the brain does not return to normal, 20 especially if you have done it over and over again 21 for years and years and years. the brain returns 22 to a lower level of those brain hormones, which 23 sets off withdrawal symptoms, which brings about 24 cravings, which brings about the compulsion to 25 smoke. 1 anyone who enters this process, it is 2 different. it is different for everyone. 3 dr. benowitz told you some of it is genetic, some 4 people have no control over it. i think the 5 picture is very clear that charles gray was 6 heavily and strongly addicted. 7 with nicotine it comes about -- see number 8 22, please -- it comes about in different ways 9 with different forms of nicotine. leaf tobacco, 10 which is used in pipes and cigars is not inhaled. 11 it is not designed to be inhaled. it is not 12 engineered to be inhaled. so people take it into 13 their mouth, a little bit into the windpipe. it 14 causes very slow delivery through the mucous 15 membranes up to the brain. it brings in very few 16 receptors. you have very low amounts that get to 17 the brain and obviously there is no lung 18 involvement. 19 cigarettes have been designed from the very 20 beginning -- number 20 is up next -- cigarettes 21 on the other hand were designed from the 22 beginning all the additives that they use, all 23 the treatments that they use, all the flavorants 24 that they use, careful blending of the 25 cigarettes, they are designed to be deeply inhaled 1 into the lungs. the lungs are a vascular organ. 2 they have tons of blood running through them. 3 you heard that the nicotine gets to the brain in 4 a matter of seconds when it goes through the 5 lung. it gets to the brain in much higher 6 concentrations and it sets off far more of these 7 nicotinic receptors and that sets off hormonal 8 brain changes that are a hallmark of addiction to 9 nicotine. 10 you saw with dr. benowitz the slides that 11 he showed comparing the brain of a smoker with 12 the brain of a nonsmoker. it had all of that 13 yellow lit up, all the nicotinic receptors the 14 smoker's brain had and nonsmoker's did not have. 15 it causes physical changes in the brain. 16 some of them are short-term. those yellow things 17 you saw on the slide that were so lit up in the 18 smoker and not in the nonsmoker, they go back to 19 normal after a while. but dr. benowitz told you 20 about neuroplasticity. the memory circuitry that 21 becomes built into the brain that does not go 22 away. it is permanent. 23 dr. keefe even told you, he said he had not 24 seen it on pet scans, but he read studies that 25 you could see on pet scans that that is what 1 causes cravings for people years after they stop 2 smoking. they walk by someplace that reminds 3 them of a cigarette and if you happen to have a 4 pet scan handy, you will see the brain start to 5 light up. the actual brain changes never go 6 away, and again this is not me saying it. it is 7 the world renowned experts who testified to you. 8 number 30, please. they also told you that 9 there is a range of levels of addiction and that 10 cannot be a surprise to anybody. it seemed to be 11 a surprise to dr. keefe, but certainly some 12 people have a much more difficult time dealing 13 with addictions than others. and there is a whole 14 body of literature, some of it written by the men 15 you saw, some of it written by others, that deal 16 with looking at what factors go into making one 17 person more heavily addicted than another person. 18 how can we predict it and what does it mean? 19 they look at things like if you are older 20 when you start, you are generally going to be less 21 heavily addicted. if you are a lighter smoker, 22 you are going to be less heavily addicted. if you 23 do not smoke for very long, that is a sign of less 24 heavy addiction; and if you do not crave a 25 cigarette first thing in the morning, which is a 1 sign of withdrawal because you have been all night 2 without it, you are likely to be a less addictive 3 smoker. 4 on the other hand, people who start very 5 young, people who smoke more for a longer 6 duration are likely to have those withdrawal 7 signs that cause them to go for a cigarette very 8 quickly in the morning. 9 when you look at that and ask yourself 10 where does charles gray fit on that scale, why 11 did dr. cummings and dr. burns, who have spent 12 their life studying this issue, tell you that he 13 was very heavily addicted? because he started 14 very young, nearly 15 years before the first 15 warnings ever went on cigarettes. 16 he was a heavy smoker. he smoked for a 17 long time. it showed itself through the fact 18 that first thing in the morning when he got up, 19 he would grab a cigarette. you heard that he 20 smoked in bed sometimes. you heard that 21 sometimes he woke up in the middle of the night 22 to smoke. whatever the factors are that cause 23 someone to be heavily addicted, they were all 24 there with charles gray. 25 if we can see the next slide. so what did 1 that mean? what does it matter whether he is 2 strongly addicted or not? 3 you heard numerous times that addiction, 4 cigarette addiction is a chronic relapsing 5 disease, a chronic relapsing disease. well, does 6 the strength of addiction have anything to do 7 with that? you know, all of this was common 8 sense, was not it? it would not be very difficult 9 to do all of these things without 800 10 peer-reviewed articles, surgeon general reports. 11 dr. burns has been involved in every one since 12 1975, the surgeon general reports on smoking. 13 the more strongly addicted you are, the 14 more likely you are to relapse. we saw that with 15 charles gray. it makes common sense. it is 16 difficult to deny. it just happens. you see it 17 with alcoholics. you see it with drug addicts. 18 it is a common factor in addictions to anything. 19 you are likely to have more and stronger 20 cravings. it shows up with more compulsion with 21 heavier smoking. you have more marked brain 22 changes, especially when you start smoking when 23 you are a teenager, a young teenager back in the 24 late '40s when cigarettes had three times as much 25 nicotine as they have now. 1 have you asked yourself why does it seem 2 like this is a generational disease? why does it 3 seem like so many people who are older have such 4 a hard time stopping smoking? nearly ninety percent 5 of them started before their 18th birthday. 6 unfortunately, that is still true today. but they 7 started smoking cigarettes that had three times 8 as much nicotine. all of the things that go on 9 in the brain that dr. benowitz talked about were 10 supercharged back in the '40s, back in the '50s. 11 all of those things with charles gray pointed to 12 the fact that his addiction played a very 13 powerful role in his smoking. 14 now, his choices did too. there is no doubt 15 about that. his choices played a role. they 16 function together with his powerful addiction, 17 the two of them combined, to cause his death. 18 you will hear that he was not motivated. he 19 did not do anything to try to quit, he did not do 20 this or he did not do that. the evidence shows 21 that he used the only two smoking cessation aids 22 available to him at the time. he used nicorette 23 gum. he was chewing it at the restaurant. he 24 was chewing it during the year that he stopped 25 smoking. he was chewing it later. he used 1 patches after his lung cancer diagnosis. that 2 was it. that is what was there. 3 he is been criticized for not going to a 4 stop smoking clinic. that is fine. he should 5 have gone. you are doggone right. he should have 6 been stronger. he should not have been so human. 7 he should not have been so weak. we admit it. we 8 admitted it from the onset. 9 but to say that addiction did not play any 10 role in it, the only way you can do that is if 11 you do what dr. keefe did on that witness stand. 12 come up with some odd form of definition of 13 causation that was not contained in the dsm-iv. 14 it was not contained in any of the books that he 15 had, any of his reliance materials. every time i 16 asked him, it says here addiction causes disease, 17 it says here that nicotine kills more people than 18 all the other drugs of abuse combined. the 19 dsm-iv says that. it is your book, dr. keefe, 20 from the american psychiatric association. 21 he says, oh, no addiction does not kill 22 people and nicotine does not kill people. it is 23 the smoke that kills people. he disagrees with 24 everything on his reliance list. he could not 25 point to one thing, one peer-reviewed article, 3036 1 one surgeon general's report, anything that backs 2 him up. 3 that is the only way you can reach the 4 conclusion that they are going to ask you to 5 reach. dr. keefe, who has never written anything 6 on the subject matter. he is never studied it to 7 any extent. he took his reliance list from the 8 lawyers at shook, hardy and bacon who served on 9 the board of directors of the tobacco institute, 10 the very organization that sponsored the video 11 clips that you have seen, and you will see again in a 12 moment. 13 dr. keefe, who told you addiction to heroin 14 has never killed anybody, addiction to alcohol 15 has never killed anybody. he says addiction is a 16 construct. it is a group of symptoms put together 17 in the dsm-iv. how could that kill someone? 18 well, that is not the law. that is not the 19 science. that is not medicine. i'm not sure what 20 to call it. but he sure as heck would not write 21 it down anywhere and try to have it peer-reviewed 22 because it goes against every single thing in the 23 literature. he could not point out one thing to 24 back him up. 25 unfortunately, relapse is the norm not the 1 exception. this is what happened on chantix, the 2 new, the best drug that we have been able to come 3 up with at this point. it actually blocks the 4 affinity of some of the nicotine receptors in the 5 brain. it is a great idea, and it seems to work 6 for some people. it has a relapse rate, you 7 heard, of 75 to eighty percent in the first year. 8 the wonder drug, the best we can do has turned 9 that 95 into 75 or eighty percent relapse, still 10 leaving a very small number of people. 11 it is hard to understand. the doctors did 12 the best they could to teach us. you may still 13 be saying, gosh, i just do not see it. all these 14 people are not smoking to kill themselves. 15 charlie gray did not smoke because he did not like 16 his life, because he was ready to leave his wife 17 or wanted to leave his children. unfortunately, 18 he smoked because he got caught up in an 19 addiction when he was very young, an addiction 20 that he was unable to deal with and unable to 21 handle. 22 he is not alone. can we see number nine, 23 please? in the united states we still today have 24 45 million people who are smoking cigarettes. 25 50 million people in the red circle have smoked 1 at least five packs in their life, that would 2 include social smokers, light smokers in college, 3 but do not currently smoke. unfortunately, as you 4 saw from the relapse numbers, those groups move 5 back and forth. they are not mutually exclusive. 6 the smokers quit, the quitters smoke, kind 7 of like dr. figlar, who went to work for a 8 cigarette company, stopped smoking, started using 9 oral things, chewing tobacco first and then snus, 10 and after years started smoking again. so it 11 happens. 12 the overwhelming evidence in this case, 13 overwhelming, is that charles gray, his addiction 14 was a substantial contributing factor to his 15 death. it did not happen by itself. it went 16 together with his own choices, if you want to 17 call it that, his relapses, his inability to 18 break out of that addiction process, his human 19 weakness, call it what you will; but if charles 20 gray had not been addicted, he would have simply 21 been what, a social smoker. 22 we actually met one in jury selection, 23 smoked about a pack a month. no one dies from 24 that. it takes 30 years of that kind of smoking 25 to get one pack year, one pack year. it takes a 1 minimum of somewhere around ten pack years, you 2 heard, to even start the risk, any serious risk 3 of lung cancer. that kind of smoker would have 4 to smoke 300 years to run the risk. 5 it is addiction that makes people stand 6 outside buildings in the rain and cold to puff 7 down a cigarette during their cigarette break. 8 it is addiction that makes people smoke when 9 they are shunned, like they are now. it is 10 addiction that makes people smoke when they have 11 to go out in their backyard to smoke a cigarette, 12 out on the back porch. they are not just choosing 13 to die. it is addiction that plays a heavy role, 14 and unfortunately that addiction, see number 10, 15 kills 440,000 americans every year. 16 dr. cummings told you it is killed over 12 17 million people since the surgeon general's report 18 in 1964. charles gray is certainly not alone. 19 charles gray is one of many. 20 let us see number 22, please. this is 21 simply an illustration of what we have been talking 22 about. this is an illustration of concurring 23 cause, the instruction that judge terrell will 24 give you that you must follow in this case. two 25 things occurred to cause death and death could 1 not have occurred without both of them. 2 death would not have occurred if charles 3 gray had managed to stop, if he had managed to 4 put those cigarettes down early enough, he 5 would not have died. that is why we admitted that 6 his own choices were a part of the cause. but 7 you never would have got to that point, you never 8 would have gotten to him even wanting to quit, 9 there would have been no reason to quit had he 10 been a social smoker. you remember that visual 11 we put up. the social smoker has such a small 12 exposure to cigarette smoke compared to the 13 addicted smoker. it never would have happened 14 without both of them. 15 as we move through the verdict form, the 16 second question says, "state the percentage of 17 any fault that was a legal cause of charles 18 gray's death that you charge to the two parties." 19 that is what so much of the evidence was 20 about that we showed during the trial. the 21 history of addiction in america. how in the 22 world did we get where we got to, where we had 23 eighty percent of charles gray's age group smoking, 24 nearly fifty percent of adult americans smoking, 25 4,000 cigarettes sold for every person over the 1 age of 18 in the united states on a yearly basis, 2 billions and billions and billions of cigarettes 3 sold? 4 you saw the document that claude teague did 5 in 1953. if we could see lp395, please. claude 6 teague in 1953, the birth of the r & d department 7 at r.j. reynolds is what you have been told. if we 8 can go to page 13, please. 9 claude teague was charged as a new chemist 10 at the company in looking around to see what 11 information was out there, the scientific 12 literature about cancer, about smoking and 13 cancer, about tobacco and cancer, and what he 14 found is an indictment of r.j. reynolds plain and 15 simple. 16 all the way back to the early 1900s, all 17 the way through 1932, all the way through the 18 '30s and the '40s, study after study after study 19 showing cancer, cancer, carcinoma, papilloma, 20 metaplasia, carcinoma, some of them no effect, 21 tumors, cancer. 22 all of this at a time when you have been told 23 r.j. reynolds did not do the first thing to 24 research their own products. nothing. they were 25 selling billions of them at this point. and the 1 testimony you have heard is we had no idea. we 2 did not know. 3 you are going to hear something from judge 4 terrell that tells you when you hear testimony, 5 especially expert testimony, from the chemists 6 like dr. figlar, you can accept it, you can 7 reject it, or you can give it the weight you 8 think it is worth. is it possible that r.j. 9 reynolds did not sit around and discuss it, they 10 did not do anything, they did not look at it, they 11 did not have these in their files? 12 the bibliography at the back of this was 78 13 articles long. most of them available in the 14 '30s and '40s. most of them available back at 15 the time when charles gray was a child. 16 r.j. reynolds got drug into creating an 17 r & d department when it became front page news. 18 they did not care who they killed. they did not 19 care who they addicted before that. they did not 20 care what their products did to anybody until it 21 was front page news with some mice on the front 22 of the newspaper that grew tumors on their back 23 and they could not ignore it any longer. 24 then i asked dr. figlar, did r.j. reynolds 25 ever -- were you ever the first one to point out 1 any carcinogen? no. were you ever the first one 2 to point out any ciliastat, the damages to the 3 reparative structure of the lung? no. were you 4 ever the first one to point out phenols? no. 5 were you the first one to point out that 6 flue-cured, the way you cured your tobacco, was 7 increasing cancer? no. 8 they got drug along the whole way. they 9 did not publish anything first. you saw some of 10 the reasons why. the legal department was 11 involved over and over again. the legal 12 department would say, you cannot do that, it will 13 affect our ability to defend cases. 14 but what they did do, what they did do once 15 they knew in 1952, 1953, they knew what was going 16 on, they could not deny it anymore, the 17 epidemiological studies came out showing huge 18 increases of cancer -- you remember the line, 19 cigarette use is like this and lung cancer was 20 like this, rising along with it 20 years later. 21 what did they do? they got together with 22 all other competitors at the plaza hotel in new 23 york city, december of 1953, and they all made a 24 decision and what they decided is chilling. they 25 decided to withhold the information that they 1 had. they decided to never release, never admit, 2 never tell anybody what we know. do not share 3 claude teague's conclusions that it is probably 4 these things that are causing cancer. it looks 5 like the relationship has been shown between 6 smoking and lung cancer, keep all of that quiet 7 and fight like heck. form a new group, tirc and 8 fight. 9 that decision has caused more suffering and 10 more death than any other decision in the history 11 of america and you would have to look hard to find 12 any other decisions that devastating. 12 million 13 people since 1964. 14 they decided to make it as easy as possible 15 for people to start smoking and as hard as 16 possible for people to stop smoking and as easy 17 as possible for people to relapse. 18 if we could see lp185, please. this is a 19 forwarding memo from hill & knowlton, the public 20 relations firm that all the major manufacturers 21 met with in december. they did not meet with 22 doctors. they did not meet with scientists. i 23 guess they did not have an r & d department at the 24 time, but they met with a public relations firm, 25 a public relations firm that they had a long-time 1 relationship from that point forward. turn to 2 page 2, please, ryan. 3 the first paragraph of this, this is a 4 hill & knowlton supervisor writing, "the attitude 5 of the men we must direct is one interesting and 6 important for us to understand. this is why 7 notes of the four interviews with research 8 directors are given at some length. you will get 9 from them little real information about lung 10 cancer, pro or con, but you will find some mighty 11 interesting opinions." one of them said, "it is 12 fortunate for us that cigarettes are a habit they 13 cannot break." 14 they have just learned indisputably that 15 cigarettes are causing lung cancer in alarming 16 numbers, not just the epidemiological studies, 17 the mice that have tumors on their backs. "it is 18 fortunate for us that cigarettes are a habit they 19 cannot break. said another, boy, would not it be 20 wonderful if our company was the first to produce 21 a cancer free cigarette? what we could do to the 22 competition." 23 sometimes sentences say more than they 24 seem. the first part of that is not so bad, 25 would not it be wonderful if we would be the first 1 to come up with a cancer free cigarette. but the 2 second part portrays the true motive, what we 3 could do to the competition. not what we could 4 do to save lives. not what we could do to stop 5 the horror and suffering of cancer death, one of 6 the worst you can imagine. man, we could make 7 more money. 8 the next one says, "suppose everyone smoked 9 just one cigarette less a day, that would be 10 maybe 40 billion a year." 11 they made a decision that day. it is 12 reported on the very next page, bottom paragraph. 13 this is hill & knowlton's charge from r.j. 14 reynolds, philip morris and the other companies 15 that were there. 16 "there is only one problem, confidence and 17 how to establish it; public assurance and how to 18 create it, and then perhaps a long interim when 19 scientific doubts must remain, and most important 20 how to free millions of the americans from the 21 guilty fear that is going to arise deep in their 22 biological depths regardless of any pooh-poohing 23 logic every time they light a cigarette. no 24 resort to mere logic ever cured panic, whether on 25 madison avenue, main street or in a 1 psychologist's office, and no mere recitation of 2 arguments pro, or ignoring of arguments con, or 3 careful balancing of the two together is going to 4 deal with such fear now. that, gentlemen, is the 5 nature of an unexampled challenge to this 6 office." 7 it is a challenge that they took on. it is a 8 challenge that they continued all the way up 9 through 1998, over 45 years of denial. 10 they hid all the knowledge that they had 11 over and over again. they made public statements 12 that were completely contrary to the information 13 that they had in their own files showed and they 14 did it over and over and over and over again. 15 they did it first through tirc, but very 16 quickly it became the center for tobacco 17 research, i lose track sometimes. the important 18 one is the tobacco institute. 19 the tobacco institute was formed and the 20 video clips you have seen and i'm about to show you 21 in a moment all came from the tobacco institute. 22 the tobacco institute acts as the official 23 spokesman for the industry, always reflecting 24 official strategy positions agreed upon by all 25 members. 1 you remember i showed some of those clips 2 to dr. figlar and i asked him, were those rjr's 3 positions? he said, yes, it is my understanding 4 that each of these statements had to be approved 5 by r.j. reynolds. 6 so who was the tobacco institute? it was 7 r.j. reynolds. it was philip morris. it was 8 lorillard. it was all of the manufacturers who 9 contributed to it, who controlled it and it was 10 the very top of each organization. the executive 11 committee members over time included the 12 presidents, vice presidents, board of directors, 13 ceos of all the major corporations, including 14 r.j. reynolds. 15 a.h. galloway, bowman gray, jr., who you 16 heard from dr. figlar, ed horrigan, gerald long, 17 collin stokes, all of them over time served in 18 the very top levels of ti. 19 and what was ti doing during that time? 20 publicly tirc, predecessor of ctr and ti, issued 21 a frank statement. they are pledging aid and 22 assistance to the research efforts into all 23 phases of tobacco and health. they are forming 24 the tobacco industry research committee and 25 they are putting up scientists of impeachable 1 integrity and national repute. 2 what was going on privately? next slide, 3 please. the tirc was conceived as a public 4 relations gesture and it has functioned as a 5 public relations gesture. another document, 6 these are all in evidence that you can see. 7 they are either from r.j. reynolds or their fellow 8 members who joined into that group, joined into 9 that agreement. "let us say that we are interested 10 in the evidence which we believe denies the 11 allegation that cigarette smoking causes 12 disease." 13 next slide, please. ctr began an 14 organization called tobacco industry research 15 council. it was set up as an industry shield in 16 1954. "it has always been a holding strategy 17 consisting of creating doubt about the health 18 charge without actually denying it." exactly what 19 you saw in hill & knowlton's document. 20 privately we know some of the things that 21 r.j. reynolds put out. we have publicly again 22 tirc in 1955. it would be made public, speaking 23 of anything they found, any hazards in 24 cigarettes, it would be made public immediately 25 and just as broadly as we could make it and 1 efforts would be taken to attempt to remove it. 2 we cannot possibly eliminate an agent that has not 3 yet been identified. 4 we have claude teague in 1953 pointing out 5 the carcinogens, labeling the carcinogens, saying 6 looking at those other studies, indicating that 7 they know that cigarettes are causing cancer. 8 but it continued. next slide. 1964, same 9 year the surgeon general's report came out. "if 10 there are bad elements, we hope we can find them 11 and if they are found, they will be removed. but 12 at this point, we do not know." 1964. 13 privately, the five pahs have been isolated 14 and identified in cigarette smoke condensate from 15 camel blend tobacco. they knew not only tobacco 16 in general had carcinogens, r.j. reynolds knew 17 that camel had carcinogens. "we consider the 18 zero level of pahs impossible to achieve." 19 publicly they are saying there is nothing bad. and 20 if there is something bad. privately, they know 21 that carcinogens are there and they know they 22 cannot remove them. 23 next slide, please. publicly in 1984, 24 "science does not know what role, if any, smoking 25 may play in production of disease. only through 1 much more research can cases and mechanisms be 2 established and cigarette controversy resolved." 3 while privately, the company is studying in 4 detail the composition of cigarette smoke. much 5 data remains unpublished because they are 6 concerned with carcinogenic and co-carcinogenic 7 compounds. 8 ryan, could you play the video clips. 9 you have going to see some clips you have already 10 seen. each of them came from high ranking 11 members of the tobacco institute and you have heard 12 from dr. figlar that r.j. reynolds approved every 13 one of these statements. 14 (video clips played) 15 mr. loehr: dr. figlar, on the stand i 16 showed him some of those clips. i gave him every 17 opportunity over and over again, that is not 18 right, is it, dr. figlar? that should not have 19 happened, should it? every time, no, no, that is 20 exactly what we did. they are still doing it now. 21 they do not admit they did anything whatsoever 22 wrong. 23 but what difference did all that make you 24 ask yourself. you have heard us talk several times 25 about global warming and the divisiveness we have 1 in society right now regarding whether that issue 2 is real or not. you heard polling testimony from 3 dr. geer for the defendants saying that back 4 during this time period, ninety percent -- back in 5 the early '50s, ninety percent had heard or read 6 something about the fact that cigarettes might be 7 harmful, might cause cancer. 8 he said that is an unbelievable number until 9 cross-examination when he found out that 10 99 percent had heard or read something about 11 ufos. but then in that poll when they were 12 asked, what harm do you associate with 13 cigarettes, 1954 after the mouse painting 14 studies, after the epidemiological studies, after 15 the front page news, after the reader's digest, 16 what harm do you associate with it? seven 17 percent of the seventy percent had heard or read 18 something, 7 percent of the 70 said lung cancer. 19 that is 4.9 percent. that was the question that 20 dr. geer said, you cannot pay any attention to 21 that. that is not a good question. 22 actually it is probably the best question to 23 ask. sure, everyone had heard or read something, 24 but what did they think in 1954 and why did they 25 think that? 1 why did it matter to charles gray? because 2 back in 1953 when all this was going on, he was 3 18 years old. he had just gotten to the point 4 that he was becoming more heavily addicted, maybe 5 entered that circle at the age of 15 or 16, but 6 look at all those factors, how long do you smoke, 7 how heavily do you smoke, for how long have you 8 smoked that way? the dsm-iv said pack years were 9 important in whether you relapse or not. how 10 much easier would it have been to break out of 11 that addiction cycle if everyone had come clean 12 in the early '50s? 13 i used global warming as an example because 14 we know what happens when there is a controversy. 15 we know what happens when the sides line up and 16 everybody starts going at it. when there is a 17 whole lot that suggests that we are destroying 18 this planet with our carbon emissions and then 19 there is a whole other group of people that say 20 we are not doing anything. if there is any warming 21 at all, it is all natural. they both look at each 22 other and say that is full of bull, that is full of 23 bull. 24 you heard from a very colorful witness in 25 this case, john gray, charles gray's brother. 1 what did you think about all those warnings? 2 that was a bunch of bull. what was the only 3 voice saying that? what was the only place 4 anybody could get that information back in the 5 1950s? you know the answer. it came directly 6 from the industry. it came from r.j. reynolds 7 and the trade groups they put together, the tirc, 8 the tobacco institute. they kept it up for 40 9 years. 10 did it make a difference to charles gray? 11 the only way to look at it is did it make a 12 difference to america? if it did not matter to 13 charles gray, it did not matter to anyone. this 14 is a young man who started smoking camel, the 15 most heavily advertised cigarette of its time and 16 the most popular. what did he do then? he 17 switched to winston. 18 you have seen all the information about 19 winston, their advertisements. they became the 20 most heavily advertised around. he followed the 21 trends. he did exactly what r.j. reynolds wanted 22 him to do, just as millions and millions and 23 millions of other americans did. 24 if we could go back to the elmo for a 25 moment, please. 1 i would suggest the appropriate percentages 2 here comparing the intentional targeting, the 3 intentional misconduct of r.j. reynolds, doing 4 exactly what they knew they should not have done, 5 coming into this courtroom and telling you 6 everything they did was consistent with the 7 concern for public health, i would suggest the 8 appropriate percentages are eighty percent on r.j. 9 reynolds and twenty percent on charles gray. 10 those matters are entirely up to you. you 11 use your own judgment, your own common sense. 12 but you are comparing intentional conduct of 13 someone, one of the most powerful corporations in 14 the world with their own public relations firm, 15 their own advertising firms on madison avenue. 16 you saw the advertising, i'm not going to show it 17 all over again. they overwhelmed america with 18 their message visually through the movies, 19 through tv, the i love lucy show, beverly 20 hillbillies -- by the way, none of which made it 21 on dr. parssinen's list, the historian, that he 22 got from shook, hardy, bacon, the law firm that 23 served on the board of directors of the tobacco 24 institute. and he told you, i did not see any 25 problem with it. 1 he found 11 movies that said anything about 2 smoking. you did not find all of the movies that 3 glamorized it, you did not find the tv ads, the 4 radio ads, you did not find any of that? no. he 5 said that he thought shook, hardy and bacon was 6 just as reliable as the library of congress. 7 the next question on the verdict form that 8 you will have to answer is probably the most 9 difficult question. what is the total amount, 10 one hundred percent, of any damages sustained by carolyn 11 gray caused by the death of her husband charles 12 gray? 13 you know, we talked a lot in this trial 14 about charles gray, but some of the things that 15 make the law so difficult are the things that we 16 do not talk about so much. yeah, he was a very 17 successful businessman, opened a number of 18 businesses successfully. they will have you 19 believe, i guess that is how he could have quit 20 smoking, somehow that fits together. but right 21 by his side the whole time, when times were good, 22 and long before that when times were very, very 23 bad was carolyn gray. 24 she followed that man all over the country 25 when he did not even have a job. they trusted 1 each other. they were together till death do 2 them part. in a way, i suppose, all too common, 3 they are still together too. carolyn could never 4 go out and try to date anyone else. she was 5 young, very young in the '50s, beautiful, 6 intelligent, funny. what are you going to do, go 7 try to find another charlie gray? 8 they were partners in business. they were 9 partners in raising their children. they were 10 partners in life. i'll show you just a few 11 family photos that we put together. 12 carolyn said that when she pictures her 13 husband now it does not bring as much pain as it 14 used to, and sometimes it actually brings good 15 feelings to her. she pictures him when he is in 16 his 50s, but not sick. i think this is what 17 carolyn sees. 18 there is no exact number that we can tell 19 you. there is no exact figure to put there. you 20 use your best judgment. we have talked about the 21 scales of justice and you have to place something 22 on one side of the scale, and somehow in some 23 crude fashion it tries to make up for her losses. 24 we do not ask you for some record setting 25 verdict that is going to be in newspapers or 1 anything else. i would suggest $7 million for 2 what she suffered in the past. whatever you feel 3 is appropriate for the future. the numbers are 4 suggestions. they are entirely up to you. 5 the last two issues on the verdict form 6 deal with reliance. did what the tobacco 7 industry did, did it have anything to do with 8 charles gray? and we have already talked about it. 9 we have already talked about the fact that all of 10 this was occurring when he was young, all the 11 formation of tirc and later ti, all of these 12 things were happening at a time when charles gray 13 had a chance, when whatever genetic 14 susceptibility he may have had to addiction 15 had not had a chance to completely take him over. 16 what would have happened in the global 17 warming situation if everyone had joined hands on 18 that stage? if the evidence was as compelling as 19 it was back then? now global warming is 20 everywhere. al gore and sarah palin, george 21 bush, barack obama, the presidents of gm, if 22 everybody was on that stage saying, we have a 23 tremendous problem and we have to do something 24 about it, how would our views of that be 25 different today? 1 the same way that the views of america 2 would have been different in 1953 if that had 3 happened. can you imagine how it would have been 4 different and what it would have done to the 5 lives of so many americans? 6 they want you to conclude that it meant 7 nothing, that it did nothing, because if it 8 did not mean something to charlie gray, it did not 9 mean anything to anyone. 10 the last question on the verdict form deals 11 with punitive damages. it asks you whether by 12 clear and convincing evidence you believe that 13 the conduct related to this cover-up, this 45 14 years of misconduct, whether you believe that 15 that conduct shows willful and wanton behavior. 16 callous disregard, in other words, is it worse 17 than negligent? is it worse than accidental? 18 when you hear that jury instruction, think 19 about the opposite of those words. if it is not 20 callous, what was it? careful? if it was not 21 intentional, what was it? accidental? 22 throughout everything you heard in this 23 trial, from all of those old documents, all the 24 way through to the testimony, did you ever see 25 anybody say, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a 1 minute, we are killing people by the millions, we 2 cannot do this? we have got to stop. we have got to 3 look at addiction. we know what is causing this. 4 it does not take a rocket scientist to figure it 5 out. people are addicted and that is why they are 6 smoking themselves to death. 7 why did not r.j. reynolds ever look at ways 8 to reduce the affinity of the nicotine receptors? 9 why did not they look for ways to take the kick 10 out of nicotine instead of putting more kick in 11 the nicotine? 12 never once in any of those documents or 13 anything else that you have seen did you see any 14 concern for human life whatsoever. it was all 15 just driven by profits. punitive damages are 16 appropriate in this case. 17 you will now get a chance to hear r.j. 18 reynolds' version of this case, and i would 19 suggest to you that their version is one that 20 comes from their witnesses, from dr. parssinen. 21 the court: your one hour cue, mr. loehr. 22 mr. loehr: thank you. from dr. parssinen 23 and dr. keefe. they got their reliance materials 24 from shook, hardy and bacon. they relied upon 25 it. dr. keefe did not really rely upon them. but 1 in this world of r.j. reynolds all you have to do 2 to quit is just want to, all it takes is 3 motivation to quit. addiction has nothing to do 4 with it. addiction cannot kill anybody. 5 in r.j. reynolds' world they did nothing 6 wrong. they caused no harm to anyone. the 7 tobacco institute was a valid contribution to 8 public health. 9 they will go through the evidence that 10 you have heard. they will criticize dr. burns and 11 dr. benowitz and dr. cummings because of their 12 willingness to come into a courtroom like this 13 and testify. they will pick and choose out of 14 the testimony that you heard to try to cobble 15 together a version of events that would allow you 16 to rule in their favor, and they will ask you to 17 exonerate them, to walk out of this courtroom 18 completely and totally blameless. 19 somehow that does not seem fair. 9 mr. loehr: thank you, your honor. very 10 briefly, i do not have a whole lot of time. but 11 what you just heard basically is that r.j. 12 reynolds did nothing wrong for all those years. 13 the one thing you heard that maybe they regret is 14 some of the language that claude teague used. 15 maybe claude teague should have been a little 16 more careful in some of the things that he wrote. 17 you know, if you compress 20, 30, 40 years 18 worth of intermittent warnings that basically 19 come sporadically after a big study, it makes it 20 look as if every single day people woke up in the 21 morning, walked out and picked up the newspaper 22 and went, oh, my god, cigarettes cause lung 23 cancer. 24 look at reader's digest. well, of course, 25 charles gray did not have reader's digest. it 1 was not one that anyone ever said that he read, 2 but the fact is when you put them all together, 3 it can create this image. 4 they put up time magazine, the slide said 5 1952 to 1959. seven years and there is six or 6 seven of them up there. one per year, one 7 article someplace in there. it makes it look as 8 if everybody knew, does not it? 9 and then they showed us some very selected 10 testimony of some of the family members to 11 suggest that everybody knew, but you heard the 12 evidence. you listened to it. but since they 13 put that up, i need to put a few things up. 14 can i have the elmo, please? this is from 15 betty truitt, mr. gray's sister. "was it common 16 knowledge when you were growing up that smoking 17 was dangerous to your health? no, it was not. 18 it was a social thing to do." 19 francis driver, another sister, "but back 20 in that day i do not think people understood. 21 they did not have the information that is 22 available to people today about the hazards of 23 smoking." 24 jimmy baggett, you saw some direct quotes 25 from mr. baggett, a brother-in-law. "did you 1 ever talk to mr. gray about the potential hazards 2 or risks of cigarette smoking? we talked about 3 it sometime. what would you say? tell me the 4 nature of the conversation. one of us would say, 5 i wish i could quit these things. they make me 6 feel bad and probably are going to give me 7 cancer; they are gonna kill and all like that. 8 did you have those conversations in the early 9 '80s when you came back to pensacola? no, not 10 that early on." 11 this is the testimony you heard in the 12 courtroom, not the little selected pieces of it. 13 his brother david gray. "have you ever 14 heard that smoking is not harmful to your health? 15 yes. where did you hear it? grew up on it. can 16 you think of someone who specifically told you 17 that, for example? that was -- that was -- that 18 was just the environment." 19 same brother, david. "and i think that bob 20 had that mindset and at one time i know he had 21 the mindset that it did not matter where we went 22 that they would always have a cure for it. but 23 he truly believed for years that smoking was not 24 harmful." 25 now, where would they have gotten all of 1 that information? where did that come from? 2 this is why it mattered. he kept saying why 3 would we withhold? my goodness, we did not look 4 at the carcinogens until other people already 5 looked at them. it was already in the press 6 before we started doing our research on them. 7 but they withheld the fact that they agreed. 8 they withheld the fact that they knew. they 9 created a controversy. they are the reason people 10 did not believe it. they are the reason that 11 people grew up thinking that cigarettes were not 12 that harmful for them because they constantly 13 heard that. it was constantly out there, 14 especially in the deep south, especially in 15 alabama. 16 by the time he began discussing these 17 matters with his wife, you have heard the 18 testimony, when he got serious about this, when 19 they started having conversations, he had been 20 diagnosed with bladder cancer. and at that point 21 in time, yeah, he knew the risks. we never said 22 he did not. he got it slapped in his face and he 23 tried awfully hard to quit. 24 they kept saying what did this have to do 25 with charles gray? all of that advertising, i 1 guess it was for nothing. i guess nobody paid 2 any attention except, let us see camel was their 3 most heavily advertised brand and that is what he 4 started smoking and then winston became the most 5 heavily advertised brand and that is what he ended 6 up smoking his entire life. 7 they said it had a filter that would help 8 with the health problems. it did not. in fact, 9 they had a document that they looked at. could 10 we see that slide? 11 you looked at this during our case. this 12 was a strategic research report from 1984 from 13 r.j. reynolds, but it was looking back. how did 14 we capture the youth market in the past? the 15 young adult smokers are the key factor for rjr. 16 young adult smokers are the only source for 17 replacement smokers. that is a charming term, 18 is not it? 19 people die. some of them manage to quit. 20 replacement smokers. this is a significant 21 growth opportunity. winston, the hit of the '50s 22 and '60s. advertising dollars were a key 23 advantage for winston. younger adult and older 24 smokers alike responded promptly to winston's 25 positive proposition. 1 can we see the next slide, please? one of 2 the advertisements they used for winston talked 3 about the winston secret. the filter blend, 4 ahead of the filter, that is the winston secret. 5 what is the secret? what did they withhold? 6 from their own documents, the polycyclic 7 aromatic hydrocarbon content of the smoke from 8 winston cigarettes was two and a half times that 9 of the smoke from camel cigarettes. 10 those are the carcinogens. their filter, 11 their highly effective, pure white filter, two 12 and a half times the amount of carcinogens in the 13 cigarettes he was smoking. what did it have to 14 do with charles gray? it had everything to do 15 with charles gray. 16 it is a voice, it is an enabling voice. what 17 would it be like if bacardi started doing public 18 announcements, they formed an organization, let us 19 call it the alcohol investigation committee, and 20 they started issuing statements saying, this 21 whole thing about alcoholism, do not listen to it. 22 alcohol is not addictive. people do not get 23 dependent on it. it is your right to drink. 24 drink all you want. 25 if they attacked every single message from 1 the public health community trying to help people 2 stop drinking, trying to help alcoholics stop and 3 then what would they say? well, you cannot prove 4 it did anything. you cannot prove that that is why 5 these alcoholics started drinking because after 6 all, everybody knows once a person who is 7 addicted -- once they stop for a while, they are 8 not addicted anymore, are they? 9 an alcoholic who goes on the wagon for some 10 time, falls back off the wagon. well, it cannot 11 be because he is an alcoholic, can it? because 12 that is not how addiction works. 13 they told you that because charles gray 14 quit for a year and then relapsed, it could not 15 possibly have to do with his addiction. and 16 mr. kaczynski told you over and over again those 17 neural, those receptors, they go back to normal. 18 dr. benowitz told you in no uncertain terms 19 about neuroplasticity, about how it can last a 20 lifetime, about how it is permanent; and their own 21 expert, dr. keefe, that was the conversation i 22 was having with him about pet scans, that you can 23 actually see that on pet scans. it does not go 24 away. 25 it is why once you are an alcoholic, you are 1 always an alcoholic. it is why once you are 2 addicted to cigarettes, you are always addicted. 3 how responsible do you think it would be to 4 encourage someone who has finally broken out of a 5 cigarette habit, here, it is the super bowl, 6 sunday afternoon? smoke a few, you are not 7 addicted anymore. what the heck? 8 you know, there is a lot of criticism about 9 the expert witnesses we put on the stand. some 10 of it related to the fact that they were not in 11 r.j. reynolds words dispassionate. yeah, guilty 12 as charged. how in the heck could those men be 13 dispassionate? they have sat their entire careers 14 and watched people die from this addiction. a 15 pulmonologist, a cardiologist and a man who works 16 in a cancer institute trying to help people stop 17 smoking. 18 and then they discover in the late '90s 19 when finally it gets bludgeoned out of this 20 industry, they find out all the secrets they held 21 all those years. they find out what they were 22 doing. they find out what they knew all along, 23 that there never was a controversy. 24 remember dr. burns' chart where he showed 25 that cigarettes were going through the roof, and 1 then they come down a little bit in 1953. then 2 what happens? oh, we have got new filters, do not 3 worry about it. boom, it goes up even though the 4 cigarettes have more carcinogens and more 5 nicotine than they started with. it comes down a 6 little bit again after 1964. boom, it starts 7 going back up. low tar, low nicotine. there is 8 always an answer. there is always a way. there is 9 always a voice from this industry to help people 10 keep smoking. 11 you know, you heard some stuff about how 12 they are not responsible for anything from philip 13 morris, but i want you to listen very carefully 14 when the court instructs you regarding the 15 findings in this case because what you are going 16 to find out is that philip morris and the other 17 manufacturers were, in fact, part of an 18 agreement. and if you find that charles gray was 19 a class member, that they were all part of an 20 agreement to do this, and you have seen the 21 agreement, and that because of that anything they 22 did in furtherance of that agreement is r.j. 23 reynolds' fault just as much as philip morris' 24 fault. they were all doing it together. they 25 were all approving it from the very top to the 1 very bottom of the comments. 2 you were told that if you look at the 3 philip morris of today, you should look at the 4 premier and you should look at the eclipse. can 5 we see -- this is the memo from claude teague 6 that i handed to dr. figlar right at the end of 7 his testimony. did you wonder what in the world 8 was going on in this courtroom? what in the 9 world was going on when that man would not agree 10 with me that putting a little blast of menthol on 11 a filter so somebody could squeeze it and get a 12 blast of flavor, he would not agree that was a 13 novelty? it took five, six, seven questions and 14 i'm not sure he ever agreed. i think i got him 15 to admit it was novel. 16 why would not he agree with it? because 17 claude teague made a blueprint, we are going after 18 the youth market. like you saw earlier, they 19 looked at in 1984, looking back to the past. 20 claude teague had a wonderful idea and the idea 21 was we need to come up with something. most of 22 the product specifications -- if we could go to 23 page 11. 24 most of the product specifications defined 25 are achievable with present technology. those 1 which require new technology would appear to be 2 control of irritancy and related mouth feel 3 factors to produce a bland smoke and creation of 4 some useful demonstrable novelty in filter, 5 mouthpiece, package or the other aspects of the 6 product system. 7 earlier he talked about the name -- 8 the court: two minutes, mr. loehr. 9 mr. loehr: the name has double meaning, a 10 meaning in regular society and one that might be 11 a little different in the youth society. 12 this is the philip morris of the year 2010. 13 just as much as the eclipse, just as much as the 14 premier. this is it. old habits die hard. 15 89 percent of their users begin smoking before 16 the age of 18, and i gave him every opportunity, 17 are you doing anything to try to reduce the 18 addictiveness? have you tried to lower the 19 binding affinity of the nicotine receptors? how 20 would we do that? we will never know if you do not 21 look. have you done anything to reduce the 22 nicotine? no. 23 just like they said so long ago. it is a 24 good thing for us it is a habit people cannot kick. 25 just like claude teague said, happily for us it is 3128 1 addictive. 2 you know, the suggestion that i suppose 3 since carolyn gray brought this lawsuit, the 4 suggestion that she made a victim of her husband. 5 you know what? there is things in a courtroom 6 that really ought to be off limits and that is one 7 of them. to accuse this woman of making a victim 8 of her husband. the only man she ever loved. 9 the man she spent her whole life with. 10 i guess he was supposed to run out and file 11 a lawsuit while he was dying of cancer. he had a 12 few other things on his mind and when you go back 13 in that jury room and you think about everything 14 that happened in this trial, i want one thing to 15 stay in your mind. 16 i want you to picture carolyn gray on her 17 way back to branson, missouri after she buried 18 the only man she ever loved, going back to face 19 what she was facing in branson, the restaurant 20 half built, loans half put together, the entire 21 family depending upon her, and i want it to ring 22 in your ears that r.j. reynolds tells you that 23 she made a victim out of charles gray. 24 thank you.
