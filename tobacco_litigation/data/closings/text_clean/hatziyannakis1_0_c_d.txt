16 mr. reilly: thank you, your honor. 17 well, good morning, everybody. 18 you know, i think it is appropriate for me 19 to begin my closing argument somewhat like 20 mr. johnstone did, by saying, as i said to you 21 in voir dire -- and i am the one who said it to 22 you -- that you take on a tremendous 23 responsibility, along with the very power that 24 we give you when you get chosen as jurors in 25 cases. 1 and what i want to spend just one minute 2 talking about is our hopes as litigants and 3 judiciary in civil cases like this. 4 in order for this system to work at its 5 best, what we hope for is that we will luckily 6 select jurors that pay very close attention to 7 the evidence. 8 and, frankly, while i try very, very hard 9 not to look at you during any part of the 10 trial, because i think that is your space, and 11 whatever you are doing is your -- was what 12 you are doing, sometimes when i was standing at 13 the podium, either examining somebody or 14 cross-examining somebody, i would glance in 15 your direction, i would see you taking lots of 16 notes; and you asked lots of questions, and you 17 obviously paid great attention in this trial, 18 and that is what makes this system work. 19 so, on behalf of lucy and me, philip 20 morris, all the lawyers, all the parties, the 21 judge, everybody, you are making the system 22 work; but you got your toughest work ahead of 23 you, right? this is the hard part of your job. 24 not that sometimes i'm sure the evidence was not 25 a little -- a little tedious and a little 1 complicated and -- 2 but, anyway, now we come to the hard part 3 of the job, okay? 4 now, in my opening statement, i said that 5 i look forward to the moment in time -- i 6 reviewed -- 7 i walked you through what i thought was 8 going to be the evidence in the case, right? 9 and i said i look forward to the moment at the 10 end of the trial when, in closing argument, we 11 get to walk together -- and i'm not going to 12 walk through a week of evidence, but we get to 13 walk together again through the evidence that 14 occurred in this trial, and see if it did not 15 turn out to be pretty much what i told you it 16 was going to be. 17 and, in fact, with one area of exception, 18 the evidence turned out to be, frankly, just 19 exactly what i told you it was going to be. 20 just exactly. and we will go over that, and 21 we will go over the one exception. 22 and i told you that at the end of the 23 case, you were going to get written 24 instructions read to you by judge streitfeld, 25 and then given to you by judge streitfeld, and 1 you are. there are going to be multiple pages 2 of dense legal language. 3 but in my opening statement, i said, i 4 think that you can boil all that down to these 5 three words. and i also said, you know what? 6 i'm a guy that uses boards, and you know that i 7 said you can -- well, i said you are going -- 8 you are going to see many of the same boards 9 that i used in my opening statement once again, 10 because that is exactly how the evidence turned 11 out. i do not have to change a thing. 12 but i said all this -- all this legal 13 language can be condensed down into these three 14 words: "control," "causation" and 15 "responsibility." and i said, what is control? 16 control is who was in control of 17 mr. hatziyannakis' decisions regarding smoking. 18 the decision to begin smoking, the decision to 19 smoke multiple cigarettes, the decision to 20 become a regular smoker, the decision to smoke 21 in the various countries in which he smoked, 22 the decision, if he ever decided he wanted to 23 quit smoking, to make an effort to quit 24 smoking, to quit smoking, who made all those 25 decisions? 1 the brand choice decisions, who made 2 brand choice decisions? who made brand choice 3 decisions in every country in which he lived? 4 who made all those decisions? that is who was 5 in control of all those decisions. 6 causation: it is, basically, two 7 questions. two questions in this case were, 8 and are, was he addicted, and was addiction the 9 cause. and you are going to see this term, 10 "legal cause," was it the legal cause of 11 mr. hatziyannakis developing his lung cancer 12 and dying. 13 and you also have the second question of 14 whether or not philip morris played some role, 15 some substantial role, some legal cause role, 16 in mr. hatziyannakis developing his lung cancer 17 and dying. that is causation. bless you. 18 and then i said, once you know the 19 answers to these two questions, as we walk 20 through the evidence, then you are going to be 21 able to assign responsibility in this case. 22 and you heard mr. johnstone say in his 23 closing argument, well, we accept 24 responsibility on the part of 25 mr. hatziyannakis. he said, we accept 1 responsibility for all the smoking history he 2 did outside the united states. 3 you know, there are manufacturers of the 4 cigarettes, who made the cigarettes that he 5 smoked outside the united states, but they 6 accept all the responsibility for all the 7 smoking he did regardless of whether he was in 8 venezuela, greece, or canada. 9 in his closing argument, as he spoke to 10 you just, what -- this was about ten minutes, 11 20 minutes into his argument, he said, we 12 accept the responsibility of all his smoking in 13 all these foreign countries. 14 but in this case, they want to change 15 that situation when mr. hatziyannakis steps off 16 the plane in new york, and now they want to 17 hold philip morris responsible for the 18 decisions that mr. hatziyannakis made while he 19 was here in the united states. that is what 20 this lawsuit is all about. all right? 21 they say, mr. hatziyannakis is 22 responsible for his smoking behavior outside 23 the united states. what does it mean when they 24 say that they are accepting responsibility on 25 mr. hatziyannakis' part? 1 i put this board up in my opening 2 statement. i said what it means is that 3 they are acknowledging that mr. hatziyannakis' 4 decisions were a direct substantial cause of 5 him getting his lung cancer, only they want 6 that to stop at the border of the united 7 states. 8 they accept that mr. hatziyannakis could 9 have quit smoking in time to avoid his lung 10 cancer, but they want that to stop at the 11 border of the united states. 12 i said, you will not see these two -- these 13 three words on the verdict form, and you will not. 14 you will not. instead, what you are going to see 15 on the verdict form -- and mr. johnstone showed 16 it to you -- are multiple pages of questions. 17 and i'm going to put up the first two 18 questions -- first page. this is the first 19 page of the verdict form. 20 and i just want to walk through the first 21 two questions on the verdict form, especially 22 the first question, because, you know, 23 mr. johnstone said, well, you can go back in 24 the jury room and you can immediately go to the 25 page that tries to apportion responsibility; 1 but you cannot. 2 the court's instructions tell you what to 3 do. and that is your responsibility as jurors. 4 judge streitfeld's going to read you this 5 verdict form, and it is going to tell you how 6 you walk through the verdict form, what your 7 responsibility as jurors is, what you are 8 supposed to do. 9 and what you are supposed to do is answer 10 this question first: was mr. hatziyannakis -- 11 was christos hatziyannakis addicted to 12 cigarettes containing nicotine; and, if so, was 13 such addiction a legal cause of his death? 14 that is actually two questions, is not it? 15 the first question is -- 16 let us just break it up right there. the 17 first question is, was he addicted. was he 18 addicted. and if he was, then you have to 19 answer the second question of whether or not 20 addiction was a legal cause of his death, a 21 legal cause of his death. 22 as we go through the evidence, i'm going 23 to -- we will talk more about whether or not he 24 was addicted. obviously that was a point of 25 significant discussion in this courtroom. 1 evidence was presented on the issue of 2 addiction from two very distinct points of 3 view. one came from a respected member of the 4 public health community, dr. david burns, who 5 the plaintiffs brought you; and the other came 6 from, frankly, in spite of what mr. johnstone 7 said, a very respected member of the medical 8 community, a board-certified psychiatrist, 9 psychiatrist with a subspecialty in addiction 10 psychiatry, a very respected member. 11 he is a former medical school professor, 12 he currently remains a medical school professor 13 on a voluntary basis, yet mr. johnstone 14 characterized him as somebody that -- 15 i do not know. it was odd. odd. 16 they came to this issue in a very 17 different way. dr. burns came from a public 18 health standpoint; dr. dosovitz came from the 19 perspective of a guy, as he described it, a guy 20 in the trenches, a guy who sees people coming 21 to them every day who have -- who use 22 substances. 23 he said, i do not treat heroin patients 24 anymore, they are just too tough. he said, the 25 methamphetamine patients, there are -- 1 virtually a hundred percent of them are 2 addicted. it must be a terrible drug. he 3 treats cocaine, he treats nicotine. 4 what did he say about his patients who 5 come to him, the number of patients who come to 6 him to deal with stopping smoking? he said, 7 look, they represent -- half of my patients are 8 addiction patients, substance abuse patients of 9 one form or another. i have to evaluate them, 10 i have to decide whether they are or are not, 11 and then i have to create a treatment plan for 12 them. 13 matter of fact, i thought it was very 14 interesting, dr. burns was reporting on when he 15 treated patients who had any kind of substance 16 abuse issues, he said, well, it was when i was 17 in the critical care unit; and i said, well, 18 what would you do? 19 he said, oh, well, when we were in the 20 critical care unit, if we had somebody that we 21 thought had a substance abuse problem, we would 22 call for a psych consult. 23 and what was that? i asked dr. dosovitz, 24 what is a psych consult? he said that is where 25 they call for me, people with my expertise, and 1 we come in and we tell the pulmonologists, the 2 internists of the world, is this person really 3 addicted, is this -- how do you deal with this 4 person? 5 and that is the guy that i brought you. 6 and he gave you, from his perspective, after 7 30-something years of doing this, what he 8 thinks about. and, granted, neither he nor 9 dr. burns ever got an opportunity to examine 10 mr. hatziyannakis; he died many, many, many 11 years ago. 12 mr. johnstone said that dr. dosovitz 13 never even asked to interview the family. 14 nobody says interview the family. if you can 15 interview the patient, you interview the 16 patient. there is no opportunity in this case 17 to interview the patient. 18 there is no law in the state of florida 19 that allows us to require or ask for an 20 interview of the family. i do not know why he 21 said it. there is no opportunity to do that. 22 mr. johnstone: i object. that is a 23 misstatement of the law. i object. 24 the court: restate it. continue. 25 mr. reilly: the bottom line here is, you 1 have to answer this question: was he addicted; 2 and if so, was that addiction a legal cause of 3 his lung cancer and death. 4 and, by the way, if the answer to this 5 question is "no," that ends your work in this 6 case, you will go home. 7 now, mr. johnstone went all the way 8 through the verdict form. i'm sure i'll go all 9 the way through the verdict form, as well; but 10 i just want to point out to you right away, 11 that is a decisive question right there. if 12 the answer to that question is "no," you do no 13 more work in this case and you go home. 14 all right. what does legal cause 15 require? this is the same board i used in my 16 opening statement. i said, look, this is a 17 shorthand way of thinking about legal cause. 18 in order for something to be a legal cause -- 19 and you are going to see the complex 20 language in the instructions the court gives 21 you. 22 law students go to law school for three 23 years to try to figure that out, and lawyers 24 like me try to explain it for the rest of our 25 lives to jurors. it is dense. 1 the shorthand of it is, in order for 2 something to be a legal cause, there has to be 3 a direct connection between whatever it is and 4 whatever the outcome is. 5 for example, for philip morris to have 6 been a legal cause of injury to 7 mr. hatziyannakis, there has to have been a 8 direct connection between philip morris so that 9 there was a substantial impact on 10 mr. hatziyannakis, and then philip morris can 11 be a legal cause. 12 let me give you just an example. 13 mr. johnstone put up a number of documents, a 14 number of old philip morris documents. do you 15 know how many of those were even created during 16 the time that mr. hatziyannakis was here in the 17 united states? i think there might have been 18 one. how many of those -- 19 i'll get to it later. 20 the bottom line is, for philip morris to 21 be a legal cause of injury to 22 mr. hatziyannakis, there has to be a direct 23 connection between something that philip morris 24 did that had a substantial impact on him that 25 resulted in an outcome, the legal cause. and 1 that is true for the addiction as well. and 2 we will go through that in detail. 3 but i said, you know, in order to know 4 the answer to this question, was he addicted 5 and whether or not the addiction was the legal 6 cause of his injury, you have got to know his 7 smoking history, right? you have to know his 8 smoking history. 9 the next question asks, basically, the 10 same thing, but it asks it specifically about 11 cigarettes manufactured by philip morris, 12 period. did he become addicted to cigarettes 13 manufactured by philip morris, and was that 14 addiction a legal cause of his injury. 15 now, you heard mr. johnstone tell you 16 that mr. hatziyannakis became addicted to 17 cigarettes outside the united states, before he 18 ever got here, before he ever got here. 19 did he tell you that that addiction 20 caused mr. hatziyannakis to develop his lung 21 cancer and die? no, you did not hear that. 22 did he tell you that when he set foot on 23 american soil, that all of a sudden the 24 addiction that he said began outside the united 25 states went away? no, he did not say that. 1 did he tell you that when he went back to 2 greece, that the addiction was not there, or 3 that when he came back to the united states, 4 the addiction was not there, that it started 5 here. and where, we will talk about that in just 6 a minute. no, he did not. 7 so, now let us just take a little bit of 8 our time -- because mr. johnstone did not do 9 this -- let us just walk through 10 mr. hatziyannakis' smoking history. 11 and, you know, when this case started, 12 during the discovery phase, when the 13 depositions were being taken, and even straight 14 on through the direct examination, when 15 mrs. hatziyannakis was on the witness stand, 16 what she told everybody was, my husband was not 17 smoking when i met him in 1965, and he did not 18 begin smoking until 1967 in canada. 19 on cross-examination, she said to lucy 20 mason, well, my husband was sneaking some 21 cigarettes in '66 in venezuela. 22 harry hatziyannakis and clio 23 hatziyannakis both came here, and they both 24 reported that mr. hatziyannakis told them -- 25 told them directly that he began smoking as a 1 young man. their impression was it was in 2 greece. at this point, that is the most likely 3 beginning point for mr. hatziyannakis beginning 4 his smoking. 5 you have these pictures of him. now, 6 mrs. hatziyannakis has had these pictures since 7 she moved to toronto in 1967. so, she said, 8 well, these pictures are in venezuela and these 9 are mr. hatziyannakis. does he look like he is 10 sneaking those cigarettes? no. 11 here's mr. hatziyannakis in venezuela in 12 december of 1966, he is smoking cigarettes with 13 a cigarette holder. 14 i'm sorry, i'm probably in your way. 15 here he is with mrs. hatziyannakis at 16 christmastime in december of '66. here he is 17 at christmastime, again, or sometime in 18 december of '66, with mrs. hatziyannakis, and 19 here he is smoking a cigar, there is the smoke 20 from the cigar, in january of 1967, a month 21 later. 22 now, that is clearly not sneaking 23 cigarettes. mr. hatziyannakis was clearly 24 smoking. here he is, what is he in his early 25 20's? i do not know exactly how old he is. is 1 he in venezuela? did he start smoking in 2 greece? 3 he told his family, i started smoking as 4 a young man. so we still do not know whether 5 the beginning is in greece or venezuela, but 6 here he is in his 20's. that is in the 50's. 7 that is in the 50's. 8 and whoever made these cigarettes, 9 whatever company, we do not know what company 10 made the cigarettes or the cigar that he was 11 smoking in venezuela or greece, but 12 mr. hatziyannakis, based on counsel's 13 statement, he is taking full responsibility for 14 those cigarettes that he smoked, full 15 responsibility. these are the cigarettes -- 16 and that is the question that i was asking 17 dr. burns. he said that i said it did not 18 matter where he began. 19 the question i asked dr. burns was, is 20 mr. hatziyannakis fully responsible for 21 beginning smoking cigarettes? 22 and dr. burns and i at that time were 23 talking about the fact that who knew where he 24 actually began; and so, sure, i said, for that 25 purpose, for the purpose of that question, does 1 it really matter where he started? 2 and dr. burns said, no, it does not 3 matter, because he said, wherever he starts, 4 he is fully responsible for the decision to 5 begin smoking. 6 of course, that is true. whether it is 7 venezuela or greece or canada, it does not 8 matter, he is fully responsible for the 9 decision, of course. 10 all right. and that is exactly what i 11 asked -- sorry -- that is exactly what i asked 12 dr. burns. i said, if, in fact, 13 mr. hatziyannakis began smoking -- and this is 14 a misprint by the court reporter, but it is in 15 the transcript -- in 1967, it should have been, 16 in canada, because that is what 17 mrs. hatziyannakis -- 18 remember, he was the first witness to 19 testify in this case, so we did not have the 20 testimony of mrs. hatziyannakis yet, so that is 21 why i said, in 1967, in canada, the decision to 22 begin smoking there would have been his 23 decision, would not it? 24 and he said the first cigarettes he 25 smoked in canada would have been his decision, 1 sure. sure. 2 and then i went through with dr. burns, 3 well, the decision to continue smoking. in 4 fact, if it took him a period of time to 5 become, in your opinion, addicted, the 6 cigarettes he smoked during that time would 7 have been solely an unencumbered decision on 8 his part to continuing smoking at that point in 9 time; correct? 10 yes. he was being urged on by friends, 11 but it was certainly not an addiction-driven 12 choice. now, how long did that last? 13 there was another question i asked of 14 dr. burns. let me make this real simple. 15 for whatever period of time 16 mr. hatziyannakis was not addicted, the decision 17 to smoke each cigarette he smoked was his 18 decision alone, was not it? and he said, yes. 19 dr. burns thinks he was addicted, but he 20 says, look, until he is addicted, he is the only 21 one who makes the decision. 22 i said, how long is that going to take? 23 do you have an opinion -- 24 oh, this is a question by mr. johnstone: 25 do you have an opinion, more likely than not, 1 when chris became addicted to the nicotine that 2 was contained in the cigarettes he was smoking? 3 now, those cigarettes are in either 4 greece or venezuela, right? he probably became 5 addicted within the first four or five years of 6 the time he was smoking. 7 now, we still do not know when that four- 8 or five-year time frame expired, but just to 9 make sure that the design of the cigarettes was 10 not of any significance in differentiating 11 cigarettes in the united -- the marlboro 12 cigarettes in the united states, or any of the 13 foreign cigarettes that he smoked, to make sure 14 there was no design difference of any 15 significance in this case, i asked this 16 question of dr. burns. 17 i said: no cigarette has a greater or 18 lesser propensity to develop addiction in 19 smokers, does it? no cigarette, whether it is 20 in venezuela, greece, canada, or a marlboro in 21 the united states, no cigarette has a greater 22 or lesser propensity to develop addiction in 23 smokers, does it? 24 and his answer was: as far as we know 25 currently, we cannot distinguish any addiction 1 potential for different cigarettes. it is 2 possible that might exist, but we cannot 3 distinguish it at this point in time, period. 4 is there anybody that said anything 5 different? one guy, an ex-employee of philip 6 morris that was fired more than 25 years ago. 7 but here is their public health expert, 8 the guy who is written all these chapters, the 9 guy who is done all this work, here he is 10 telling you there is no difference. 11 and mr. johnstone just acknowledged, and 12 dr. burns has already said, this guy is 13 addicted to the nicotine in his cigarettes in 14 wherever it is. is it greece, is it venezuela, 15 is it canada? 16 i went further with dr. burns on this 17 point. i said: are all cigarettes equal in 18 terms of their propensity to cause lung cancer? 19 i said: the cigarettes in greece caused 20 people who smoked them in greece to develop 21 cancer of the lung and other diseases? 22 certainly did. 23 just as readily as cigarettes in 24 venezuela? 25 as far as we are able to determine at 1 this point, yes. 2 they certainly all had that capability. 3 they certainly all caused large numbers of lung 4 cancer deaths in their population. the same is 5 true in canada, and the same is true in the 6 united states. both canada and the united 7 states have also had large numbers of people 8 who died from smoking cigarettes manufactured 9 in their own country. no difference, no place, 10 no design difference, period. and that came 11 from their expert. 12 did the cigarettes that he smoked in 13 venezuela, greece, canada, play a substantial 14 role in mr. hatziyannakis developing his lung 15 cancer? 16 this is their expert, dr. burns. i said: 17 doctor, if he had quit smoking in 1981, would 18 he more probably than not have developed lung 19 cancer anyway? 20 and he said: maybe yes, maybe no, cannot 21 tell. 22 the fact is, he did not quit smoking, and 23 consequently all the smoking he did before 24 1981, ends up contributing to his ultimate 25 development of cancer; correct? 1 and he said: all before and all after, 2 because he did not quit, yes. because he did not 3 quit, yes. 4 that is their expert. that is their 5 expert. here he is. if he is smoking in 6 greece, when he gets to venezuela, and he gets 7 off the plane, this is -- 8 you remember i did this with dr. burns? 9 unfortunately, we had many steps because -- we 10 had many stops; right? 11 and i said: doctor, when he gets off the 12 plane, this time in venezuela, he is got two 13 decisions to make; i'm going to stop smoking or 14 i'm going to continue to smoke; and if i'm 15 going to continue to smoke, i've got to select 16 a brand, right? and dr. burns said, that is 17 right. 18 1965, mrs. hatziyannakis meets 19 mr. hatziyannakis. they meet in greece, they 20 date. she says, in trial, he is not smoking. 21 you see the pictures. you see the pictures. 22 now, in trial, she said, yes, in 1966, he 23 started to sneak cigarettes, he was sneaking, 24 that is what she said. 25 lucy mason was cross-examining her. you 1 see the pictures. why she characterized it 2 that way, i have no idea, honestly; but 3 pictures are worth a thousand words, so i'll 4 save you a thousand words. 5 but the bottom line is, obviously, he was 6 a regular smoker in venezuela, and now you know 7 that, unfortunately, because of the earthquake 8 the family moves to canada. 9 and, again, when mr. hatziyannakis gets 10 off the plane in canada, where he is going to 11 start new businesses and have a new life, he is 12 got two smoking decisions to make. 13 and you know from mrs. hatziyannakis' 14 testimony that as soon as she saw him smoking 15 in venezuela, she told him, look, i hate 16 smoking, smoking is bad for your health, 17 smoking is addicting, you are going to -- you are 18 not going to be able to quit, and what did she 19 say he said? 20 she said he said, well, i'm only going to 21 do it for a while because i'm under a lot of 22 stress. she said, do not do it, i hate it, it is 23 bad for your health, you can die. 24 how did she know? because she learned it 25 in sunday school and she learned it from her 1 dad. so, ten years before mr. hatziyannakis 2 ever gets here to the united states, his 3 fiancee, future wife, now his wife, tells him, 4 do not smoke. 5 and you heard my exchange with dr. burns. 6 i said, you know, he has a choice, does not he? 7 he can do what his wife asks him to do, or he 8 can decide not to, cannot he? 9 and dr. burns says: yes, he should have 10 listened to her advice, husbands oftentimes 11 should, but he chose not to. 12 anybody else play a role in that 13 decision? is philip morris anywhere in this 14 picture? 15 mr. johnstone has said they accept full 16 responsibility for the decisions he made when 17 he gets off the plane in canada and chooses a 18 brand. 19 now, the manufacturer, whose brand he 20 chose, makes a cigarette called du maurier. my 21 french is worse than terrible, far worse than 22 terrible. 23 no one is attempting to hold the 24 manufacturer of du maurier cigarettes 25 responsible in this case, their cigarettes are 1 just as addicting, just as capable of causing 2 cancer, and they played just as much a role in 3 mr. hatziyannakis getting his lung cancer in 4 this case, but no one is holding them 5 responsible in this case. no one is trying to. 6 mr. hatziyannakis -- 7 or they are accepting full responsibility 8 for the decisions that mr. hatziyannakis made 9 in smoking every du maurier cigarette that he 10 smoked, every cigarette he smoked in canada, 11 every cigarette he smoked in venezuela. 12 is there any evidence in this case that 13 there were any warnings on the du maurier 14 cigarettes? none. but mrs. hatziyannakis is 15 there, telling him, do not smoke, do not smoke, 16 frequently, you heard it, frequently, 17 vigorously, angrily. 18 is mr. hatziyannakis a guy, before he 19 even gets to the united states, that does not 20 know that there is a risk in smoking, that 21 there is a risk in developing illness and dying 22 or becoming addicted? his wife has told him a 23 thousand times. 24 1971, he smoked in canada for four years 25 and moved to greece; right? he wanted to get 1 out of the cold climate of canada, wanted to go 2 home, go to greece. once again, he gets off 3 the airplane, he has a couple of decisions to 4 make about smoking. 5 my decisions are, am i going to continue 6 to smoke. if i'm going to continue to smoke, 7 what brand am i going to smoke. and when he 8 gets off the plane, he makes the same 9 decisions, right? i'm going to continue to 10 smoke, i'm not going to do what my wife says, 11 i'm going to continue to smoke. he chooses a 12 brand. 13 we do not know what brand he chose. there 14 was a discussion of karelia cigarettes, a greek 15 cigarette, but i do not think there was a real 16 identification for sure that that was the brand 17 that he smoked there. 18 but whatever he smoked, for some reason 19 they distinguish between the full 20 responsibility they take for every cigarette he 21 smoked in greece, but not the marlboros he 22 smoked in the united states. 23 did philip morris play any role in his 24 decision to smoke greek cigarettes? absolutely 25 none. you know that. he is nowhere near the 1 united states yet. nowhere near there. 2 you know he opens new businesses in 3 greece, he stays -- the family stays in greece 4 until 1974, when they move to the united 5 states. now, this is the first time they will 6 have set foot on american soil. and let us stop 7 for a moment and ask ourselves, so what is the 8 situation before he ever smokes his first 9 marlboro? 10 well, the situation is they have already 11 said he is -- they have said he is addicted, 12 addicted to the cigarettes that he smoked 13 outside the united states. so, if he is 14 addicted, as they say he is, he is addicted. 15 they say -- 16 well, by this time, how many cigarettes 17 has he smoked in greece? mrs. hatziyannakis 18 said he was smoking two packs a day. that is 40 19 cigarettes a day. she said he was smoking a 20 pack and a half in greece, but you guys figured 21 out that is 25 cigarettes to the pack, a pack 22 and a half is really two packs of 20 cigarettes 23 a day. or a cigarette off. 24 so, mr. johnstone says, well, that is -- 25 he does a calculation. you can do the same 1 calculation. going back how many years now? 2 are we back to the mid- to late 50's, has he 3 been smoking for 15 or 20 years? how old is he 4 before he sets foot -- 5 the moment he steps foot in the united 6 states, how old is he, and makes the decision 7 to smoke his first marlboro? he is 38 years 8 old. after having smoked for 15 or 20 years, 9 here's a marlboro ad. they want you to 10 conclude that somehow this marlboro ad, with a 11 warning right on it, caused mr. hatziyannakis, 12 at age 38, to do what? 13 he is already been smoking at the rate of 14 two packs a day in greece, he is gone to the 15 store to buy more cigarettes in the united 16 states. what did -- what impact -- 17 i mean, you guys did not leave your common 18 sense at the front door. what impact did that 19 have on a guy that they say was addicted and 20 has now been smoking cigarettes at the rate of 21 two packs a day for how long? fifteen years, 22 20 years. that is a puzzle. 23 what about all the advertising that 24 occurred in greece and venezuela? they are not 25 claiming any responsibility on the part of the 1 manufacturers who advertised their cigarettes 2 in greece or venezuela or canada. what about 3 the du maurier ads? 4 oh, and by the way, just so we are 5 perfectly clear about this, mrs. hatziyannakis 6 said he smoked some cigarettes called marlboro 7 in canada. there is no relationship between 8 the cigarettes called marlboro in canada and 9 philip morris' usa manufactured marlboros. 10 there is no dispute about that. let us clear 11 that up. now -- 12 and, by the way, here are the pictures of 13 mr. hatziyannakis smoking in canada. here are 14 the du maurier cigarettes. here he is smoking 15 pipes. he smokes pipes, he smokes du mauriers. 16 there you go. 17 all right. now, what is the situation in 18 terms of a warning when he gets off the 19 airplane in the united states? 20 let me just take these down. 21 well, the situation is that there is a 22 warning not only on every pack of cigarettes, 23 there is a warning on every ad in a magazine, 24 there is a warning on every billboard here in 25 the united states. 1 what is that warning? it says: warning: 2 the surgeon general has determined that 3 cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health. 4 now, somebody might say, oh, well, that 5 warning's kind of little, but that warning was 6 spotted by mrs. hatziyannakis, and she read it, 7 she understood it, she translated it, she said 8 it to her husband in greek. 9 she said, look, look, there it is, a 10 warning on every pack of your marlboros says 11 this is dangerous for your health. 12 if her message had not gotten through to 13 mr. hatziyannakis in venezuela or greece or 14 canada, there it is, in black and white, on 15 every ad, on every billboard, on every pack of 16 cigarettes here in the united states, every 17 marlboro pack of cigarettes he smoked, every 18 marlboro pack of cigarettes he bought. 19 now, they say -- they say 20 mr. hatziyannakis -- that somehow this ad 21 caused him to do something. i cannot figure out 22 what the something is, though, because he is 23 already, by their description, a committed, 24 addicted smoker, right? so, that ad, 25 obviously, does not make him begin to smoke, and 1 he is already smoking. 2 but i asked -- i asked harry 3 hatziyannakis, the eldest son, i said, why did 4 your dad pick marlboros? i said, your father 5 never told you why he selected any given brand 6 of cigarettes, did he? he said we really -- we 7 never had a conversation about it. 8 you could stop that answer right there. 9 we never had a conversation about it. but he 10 went on to say, but i -- he always liked going 11 with big name brands -- well, there is no 12 question that marlboro is a big name brand -- 13 thinking that, you know, it is always a safer 14 way to go when you buy name-brand stuff. for 15 quality? yes. there you go. 16 i'm going to run out of space here. all 17 right. so, now, what is different about the 18 situation and the responsibility when 19 mr. hatziyannakis lands in the united states? 20 why is it that now all of a sudden, in 21 this courtroom, that is supposed to be a 22 different situation than -- 23 here's all the blue. you see the colors? 24 this is all the blue smoking that he is -- that 25 they say he is responsible for, before he gets 1 to the united states. and then they say, well, 2 when he steps off the plane -- 3 every morning in the mirror when 4 mr. hatziyannakis gets up in greece, venezuela, 5 canada, and he looks in the mirror and he says, 6 today i'm a smoker, i'm smoking today, i'm 7 smoking my two packs today, in all those 8 foreign countries, he is the only person in the 9 mirror, the only person to be held responsible. 10 but when he steps into the bathroom in 11 the united states, all of a sudden they want 12 you to put philip morris in the mirror with 13 him. their cigarettes are no more dangerous, 14 no more addicting than all the cigarettes he 15 smoked right here. 16 but for some reason they are now supposed 17 to be in the mirror, too. why is that? does 18 his responsibility change when he gets to the 19 united states? does it change when he is 20 addicted? 21 this is their expert, dr. burns. i asked 22 him: even after in your estimation he became 23 addicted, mr. hatziyannakis does not lose the 24 responsibility for smoking his cigarettes, does 25 he? this is their expert. that is his complete 1 answer: he does not. that is his complete 2 answer. 3 all right. the warning stays on every 4 pack, every ad, et cetera. mr. hatziyannakis 5 creates new businesses, they move from new york 6 city, to arizona and back, and then because of 7 an illness in her family, and because they want 8 to have -- be closer to home, and new business 9 opportunities, they move back to greece. 10 now, i cannot imagine what it is that 11 differentiates mr. hatziyannakis and his 12 responsibility when he gets back to greece; but 13 mr. johnstone said, you know what? when he 14 does his foreign smoking, he is completely 15 responsible. 16 so, when he gets off the airplane in 17 athens, all of a sudden because he goes to the 18 store and instead of buying marlboros, he buys 19 karelias, or some other greek brand, he is fully 20 responsible again. what -- what happened? 21 he is in greece now for another three 22 years, '78 to '81, smoking two packs a day. he 23 opens that bicycle carrier business. you know, 24 this guy is smart, he is entrepreneurial, he is 25 disciplined, he is successful, he is intelligent. 1 what happened that makes this difference? 2 it certainly is not because he ever heard or saw 3 anything from philip morris or any other 4 american cigarette manufacturer other than ads 5 with warnings on them. 6 how do we know that? well, first of all, 7 no family member -- and they all came here -- 8 not one family member came here and said my 9 father ever heard or saw anything from a 10 cigarette manufacturer ever, other than the ads 11 for marlboros. nothing. 12 so, all these things that mr. johnstone 13 puts up -- and remember, look at the dates on 14 them -- but all these things that mr. johnstone 15 talks about, nobody ever came here and said 16 that anything that philip morris ever said, 17 other than those ads, was ever seen by 18 mr. hatziyannakis. 19 and i confirmed that with -- i'm going to 20 leave it there -- i confirmed that with their 21 expert, dr. burns, who said, i read all the 22 depositions of all the family members in this 23 case. 24 and i said, doctor, you saw in the 25 depositions of his family members that they 1 testified at no time did he tell any of his 2 family members that he ever saw any statement 3 by philip morris or any other cigarette 4 manufacturer or the tobacco institute or 5 anybody else connected with the tobacco 6 industry during the time that he lived in the 7 united states, right? 8 dr. burns said: i think that is a bit of 9 an overstatement. what is clear is he never 10 saw a statement by the tobacco industry that 11 was significantly important to him that he 12 would have discussed it with his family members 13 in a way that was significantly memorable to 14 those family members that they remembered it 15 and reported it in deposition. 16 that is a long-winded way of saying no. 17 no. 18 all right. and besides, since at least 19 1965 or 6, mr. hatziyannakis has been hearing 20 from his wife regularly, loudly, angrily, 21 you are killing yourself, you are addicting 22 yourself, i do not want you to smoke. now he 23 hears it -- 24 when he goes back to greece, he is hearing 25 it from his own parents, he is hearing it from 1 his in-laws. during the time that he was 2 living in the united states, '74 to '78, every 3 pack told him, every ad told him. 4 there is no failure to warn claim in this 5 case. they are not claiming philip morris 6 failed to warn him about something. 7 1981, family moves back. when he steps 8 off the plane, they want to have a new 9 situation. they want to go back to now 10 mr. hatziyannakis is not fully responsible for 11 all the cigarettes that he smokes, now philip 12 morris is supposed to be back in the mirror. 13 what is different? there is still a 14 warning on every pack. there is still no -- no 15 seeing -- 16 and is it any surprise -- 17 mr. hatziyannakis, you heard, does not 18 really read english very well. is there any 19 surprise on the part of anybody that no family 20 member came here and said mr. hatziyannakis 21 ever said, i heard anything from philip morris 22 or any other cigarette manufacturer or anybody 23 else connected with the tobacco industry here 24 in the united states that misled me in any way? 25 in any way. never said that. 1 all right. 1981 to 1988, they say 2 mr. hatziyannakis smokes two to three packs a 3 day. maybe he does. i do not know. but what i 4 do know is that the testimony was, from harry 5 hatziyannakis and clio hatziyannakis, that 6 around 1988, or thereabouts, mr. hatziyannakis 7 says, i quit. he quit for a period of time, 8 and then for the next five years, until his 9 death, nobody sees him smoking. 10 now, occasionally -- now, occasionally, 11 there are exceptions to that. when harry goes 12 off to the gulf war for a period of time, his 13 dad was then smoking openly. when 14 mrs. hatziyannakis' has gallbladder surgery, he 15 resumes open smoking. 16 but the rest of the time they do not see 17 him smoking, and occasionally they see 18 indications that he is smoking, because they see 19 the packs of cigarettes around, or they see 20 ashes and they confront him with it. 21 not just one family member, but as a 22 group. you heard about it. as a group, they 23 would come to him and say, hey, husband, hey, 24 dad, hey, father-in-law, i see residue, i see 25 indications that you are smoking. 1 and what was his answer? he would say, 2 i'm smoking one or two. now, maybe he was 3 smoking more than that; but what you know is 4 that if you are not smoking in front of your 5 wife, if you are smoking in front of your 6 children, that means when you get up in the 7 morning, you cannot smoke. 8 that means when you are having breakfast 9 and coffee, you cannot smoke. it means that 10 when you are driving with your wife to the shop, 11 you cannot smoke. 12 the only time you can smoke is when 13 you are driving -- after you dropped her off, 14 you can drive on to the mobil station, you can 15 smoke at the mobil station, and you can smoke 16 from the mobil station back to the shop. 17 that is how long he can smoke, and that is a 18 half-day job for him. and that is it. because 19 the rest of the day you are with your wife, and 20 you cannot smoke. 21 that means you cannot smoke before dinner, 22 you cannot smoke after dinner, you cannot smoke 23 in the evening, you cannot smoke on the patio 24 when you are listening to music. you cannot 25 smoke. you cannot smoke before you go to bed. 1 and you remember that harry, even though 2 he is a student, even though he is not spending a 3 lot of time at home, he is still at home until 4 he gets married in 1992. 5 and you did not hear any different 6 information from mrs. hatziyannakis. in 1993, 7 when he is diagnosed, does he quit? it is a 8 little unclear. mrs. hatziyannakis said he 9 quit. did he quit -- did he quit because he 10 could not smoke? i do not know. 11 you know, i asked dr. burns -- 12 oh, and by the way, in 1985, you know 13 that the warnings on the packs changes. in 14 1985, the warnings on the packs changes, and 15 now it says: smoking causes lung cancer, heart 16 disease, emphysema, and can complicate 17 pregnancy. smoke contains carbon monoxide. it 18 says: quitting now greatly reduces your -- can 19 greatly reduce your risk of disease. it is 20 rotating warnings. 21 all right. all right. you know, i asked 22 their expert, dr. burns. can every smoker 23 quit? this is what i asked dr. burns. 24 i believe that nicotine addiction can be 25 overcome, and there is no addiction that cannot 1 be overcome. that is their expert. 2 this goes to the question of control and 3 legal cause. will people quit smoking -- 4 excuse me -- if they are not motivated to quit? 5 if you do not want to quit, are you going to 6 quit? 7 i asked harry, his son: but, frankly, 8 you do not even think your dad was motivated to 9 quit until the late 80's, do you? 10 his answer was: i do not think so. 11 back to that original word "control." 12 who is in control of mr. hatziyannakis' 13 decisions regarding his smoking? who is in 14 control? well -- 15 and remember what harry went on to say 16 was, i believe the only reason why 17 mr. hatziyannakis became motivated to quit 18 smoking after that was because he just wanted 19 to avoid all the argument that we were giving 20 him. he wanted to get us off his back. 21 that was exactly what he said, get us off 22 his back. you know, you would think, based on 23 mr. johnstone's argument, that dr. dosovitz and 24 dr. burns were completely at odds in this case, 25 would not you; but, in fact, they agree -- let 1 me see if i can get out of everybody's way -- 2 that the decision to begin smoking was 3 mr. hatziyannakis' alone. 4 the decision to continue smoking was 5 mr. hatziyannakis' alone. mr. hatziyannakis 6 continued to smoke for years without being 7 influenced by addiction. 8 obviously, dr. dosovitz believes he 9 continued to smoke his entire smoking career 10 without addiction. he could have quit anytime, 11 if he was sufficiently motivated, expended 12 enough effort, and had the right circumstances 13 and support to quit. they both agreed on that. 14 who was in control? what is different -- 15 what is different about what happens in the 16 united states versus what happens in any one of 17 those other countries? what is different? 18 mr. hatziyannakis is totally responsible 19 in every other country, but he has no 20 responsibility here. how can that be? all. 21 right. on this issue -- 22 let me put this down. 23 addiction was described as compulsive 24 smoking, right? compelled smoking. loss of 25 control. 1 when dr. dosovitz was describing his 2 determination that he thought that 3 mr. hatziyannakis had not truly been addicted, 4 he said, look, i looked at several factors, 5 because i try to get as much in-depth 6 information as i can. 7 for dr. burns it was, if you smoked a lot 8 of cigarettes over a long enough period of 9 time, and i see that you tried to quit and you 10 did not quit, you are addicted. very simple. 11 works for the public health guy. that is okay. 12 for dr. dosovitz, who has to deal with 13 these people every day, every day, he said, you 14 know what? and he said, i apply this criteria 15 across the board, whether i'm dealing with 16 somebody that is a heroin -- or he does not do 17 heroin anymore -- a cocaine addict or a meth 18 addict, an alcoholic, somebody that wants to 19 quit smoking, i look to see, you know what, do 20 they have a loss of control, really? 21 and he looked at, in particular various 22 instances that he talked to you about, 23 especially the end of '88 through '93, where 24 mr. hatziyannakis does not smoke in the presence 25 of his family, except on those few occasions, 1 and he said, you know, that is to me -- to me, 2 that is real control, that is not compulsive 3 smoking. 4 withdrawal symptoms, he said, you know 5 what, i need to know whether or not -- 6 the hallmark of addiction is you are going 7 to have withdrawal symptoms. what are they? 8 he said it is not the shakes, that is not what 9 people get. you can get that with alcoholism, 10 you can get that with a lot of other 11 addictions, but what you are going to get is 12 irritability, sleeplessness, anger, loss of 13 concentration, that sort of thing. 14 and that was asked of jim and harry, and 15 nobody reported it. they said his personality 16 never changed. clio, personality never changed 17 when he was smoking, when he was not smoking. 18 failed self-motivated quitting. well, 19 there never was any failed self-motivated 20 quitting because harry said he was not really 21 interested in quitting until '88, until the 22 late 80's, and he said, even then it was to get 23 us off his back. that is what dr. dosovitz 24 found significant. 25 mr. johnstone, on cross-examination, 1 asked him about, well, did not it materially 2 affect his lifestyle? were not there people 3 that would not come over to his house because 4 they did not want to go to a house where a guy 5 smoked? 6 and dr. dosovitz said, well, you know 7 what, the guy had a rich social life. you 8 remember he went to minos' restaurant to sit 9 and chat with minos and his wife, jeanne, in 10 greek, smoking cigarettes, drinking coffee. 11 he was described as a guy who had a 12 social life, went to church, et cetera. 13 dr. dosovitz said, you know what, a two-hour 14 long service, if you get up at an hour and go 15 and get a cigarette, that is, to me, an 16 indication of control, not an indication of 17 addiction. 18 it is a judgment call. it is a true 19 judgment call. and that is exactly what you 20 guys now have to make, because judge streitfeld 21 is not going to give you an instruction that 22 says this is how you determine whether or not 23 somebody -- whether or not mr. dos -- i'm 24 sorry, whether or not mr. hatziyannakis was 25 addicted or not. 1 you are going to have to -- you have 2 listened to all the evidence, now you are going 3 to have to make a determination. i know that is 4 kind of hard, because ordinarily on everything 5 else, you are going to get guidance. on this 6 one, you do not. 7 okay. dr. dosovitz also said, you know 8 what, i also look to see exactly how committed 9 you are to quitting, and so i look for how many 10 methods you have attempted in order to quit. if 11 you are really committed to quitting, if you try 12 cold turkey and you fail, you know if you are 13 really committed to quitting, you are going to 14 do something else. 15 you are going to try the patch, you are 16 going to go for professional help, you are going 17 to ask for a prescription, you are going to go 18 to a clinic, you are going to do something. 19 he talks to these folks every day. every 20 day. but mr. hatziyannakis did not do any of 21 those things. they suggested because he did not 22 know about any of them. 23 i leave that to you to decide whether 24 that seems credible or not for an intelligent 25 guy. you know, when he got here in 1981, how 1 old was he? he was 45 years old. forty-five 2 years old, in 1981, when he came to the united 3 states and became a permanent resident, a 4 citizen. forty-five years old. he is no kid. 5 this is not a case involving somebody who is 15 6 and deciding, without information, whether or 7 not he is going to smoke a marlboro or not. 8 this is a gentleman who is 45 years old, 9 making the decision when he returns here from 10 greece, whether he is going to smoke a marlboro 11 or not. 12 okay. i'll go to the verdict form and 13 i'm just going to walk through it. you have been 14 very patient with me. i appreciate it. 15 all right. mr. johnstone said both of 16 these questions should be answered "yes." i 17 would suggest to you that both of these answers 18 should be answered "no." in fact, if you 19 answer this one "no," you do not have to do 20 anything else, because that is the end of it. 21 even if you were to decide that 22 mr. hatziyannakis was addicted and that his 23 addiction was a legal cause of him getting 24 cancer and dying, you have got to ask yourself, 25 well, what addiction was it? 1 i mean, they have already said he was 2 addicted before he ever got to the united 3 states, so what addiction compelled him to 4 continue to smoke? if that is what you 5 conclude, what addiction compelled him to 6 continue to smoke? 7 so, i think the answer to that one would 8 be "no" even if the answer to that one was 9 "yes." 10 and this one says: please state whether 11 the negligence of philip morris was -- 12 oh, and by the way, any findings that -- 13 by another jury at another point in time have 14 nothing to do with answering these questions. 15 these are just yours to answer alone, period. 16 next question says: was the negligence 17 of philip morris a legal cause, a legal cause, 18 a legal cause, a legal cause, of 19 mr. hatziyannakis' death. 20 well, you would have to find -- 21 and here's a guy who they have said has 22 full responsibility for everything he does, 23 except when he is here in the united states; and 24 then they are claiming that philip morris ought 25 to take on the responsibility because they are 1 the maker of the cigarettes that he smokes in 2 the united states. puzzling. 3 you would have to find that all of a 4 sudden they become the legal cause, they become 5 the substantial reason why he gets lung cancer. 6 does that make any sense? but the 7 manufacturers of the cigarettes that he smokes 8 in greece, canada, venezuela, are not, even 9 though dr. burns said they all contributed to 10 him getting his cancer. 11 so, i think the answer to all of these 12 questions is "no," and then you come to, please 13 state whether mr. hatziyannakis reasonably 14 relied to his detriment -- reasonably relied to 15 his detriment on any statement by philip morris 16 which concealed or omitted material information 17 concerning the health effects or addictive 18 nature of smoking cigarettes; and, if so, 19 whether such reliance was a legal cause of his 20 death. 21 well, dr. burns told you the answer to 22 this one. no one came to the stand and said, 23 yes, he relied on some statement by philip 24 morris. the answer to this one is so obvious, 25 no, that it is -- i mean, all you have got to do 1 is look at the testimony of dr. burns and you 2 know the answer to that one. 3 that is the same thing right here. please 4 state whether mr. hatziyannakis reasonably 5 relied to his detriment, reasonably relied to 6 his detriment, on an act done in furtherance of 7 an agreement to conceal or omit information 8 concerning the health effects or addictive 9 nature of smoking cigarettes; and, if so, 10 whether such reliance was a legal cause of his 11 death. 12 dr. burns just told you there is nothing 13 that anybody reported that mr. hatziyannakis 14 ever said that he relied in any way, that he 15 even heard anything from philip morris or any 16 other cigarette manufacturer, much less relied 17 on something that was said or unsaid. 18 number 8 says: was there gross 19 negligence by philip morris; and, if so, was 20 that gross negligence a legal cause of 21 mr. hatziyannakis' death. 22 and, again, you have to make up your own 23 mind about this entirely. what is it? what is 24 it that philip morris did in connection with 25 mr. hatziyannakis that mr. hatziyannakis 1 ever -- 2 what was his total interaction with 3 philip morris? it was he saw ads with cowboys, 4 and he bought cigarettes manufactured by philip 5 morris. that is it. 6 the same type of cigarettes that he 7 bought everywhere else in the world, the same 8 cigarettes that dr. burns said equally 9 contributed to him getting his cancer and 10 dying; and yet those companies are not being 11 held responsible in any way, no claim, they are 12 accepting full responsibility for his smoking 13 of those companies' products, those companies' 14 cigarettes. 15 and yet philip morris does the same 16 thing, makes the cigarettes that he buys, and 17 they are supposed to be grossly negligent now. 18 then you have to assign a percentage of 19 responsibility of mr. hatziyannakis and to 20 philip morris, if you get this far on the 21 verdict form. 22 and mr. johnstone said, well, i think 23 that the split should be 25/75, 75 percent on 24 philip morris, although he accepts full 25 responsibility for all the cigarettes 1 manufactured by all the companies outside the 2 united states. how can that be? how can it -- 3 i mean, it is -- 4 the idea that all of a sudden when he 5 gets to the united states, he looks in the 6 mirror -- 7 up to that point, it is only 8 mr. hatziyannakis looking in the mirror, 9 deciding whether he is going to smoke; and now, 10 all of a sudden philip morris takes on a 75 -- 11 must be more than that, it must be a hundred 12 percent responsible to get a 75/25 split. must 13 be a hundred percent responsible for 14 mr. hatziyannakis deciding he is going to smoke 15 cigarettes in the united states. 16 i just do not understand how it is 17 different for the manufacturers outside the 18 united states, the manufacturers -- and philip 19 morris inside the united states, when the 20 products are the same, the results are the 21 same, and mr. hatziyannakis sees nothing more 22 than ads with warnings on them. that is the -- 23 that is the entire interaction. 24 now, i'm not standing here and telling 25 you that everything that philip morris ever 1 said or failed to say about the health risks of 2 smoking was right or that they would do it 3 today or they have done it in the last ten years, 4 i'm not doing that. i told you that in my 5 opening statement. but there has to be a legal 6 cause requirement. it has to have an impact on 7 mr. hatziyannakis. it has to. and you cannot 8 overlook that in doing your job. that is just 9 the way it is. that is the law. and that is 10 your responsibility. 11 if you get this far in the case, 12 mr. johnstone said you should put 10 million 13 here, 10 million here, two-and-a-half million 14 here, two-and-a-half million here. you know 15 what? i'm not going to comment on that. 16 you are a wise jury, you will make a wise 17 decision. 18 yes, this number is 114,000, we agreed to 19 it, but that does not mean we agree that that is 20 a number that -- that you should award in this 21 case. that is all controlled by the prior 22 answers to the prior questions. 23 and then we come to the final question: 24 under the circumstances of this case, please 25 state whether you find by clear and convincing 1 evidence that punitive damages are warranted 2 against philip morris usa. 3 and this is the punitive damage standard. 4 intentional misconduct -- and you will get this 5 exact language -- intentional misconduct means 6 that philip morris usa, incorporated, had 7 actual knowledge of the wrongfulness of the 8 conduct and there was a high probability of 9 injury or damage to christos hatziyannakis, 10 and, despite that knowledge, it intentionally 11 pursued that course of conduct, resulting in 12 injury or damage. 13 philip morris made the same kinds of 14 cigarettes that all the other manufacturers 15 did. there is not even a whisper of 16 responsibility on our part. 17 mr. hatziyannakis has accepted full 18 responsibility for doing the very same thing 19 that they did, they want to hold -- 20 in connection with mr. hatziyannakis, 21 they want to hold philip morris and punish 22 them, punish them. 23 all right. you know what? you have been 24 very patient and very attentive, once again, as 25 usual, and, so, let me conclude this. 1 and lucy was very kind to let me make the 2 entire closing argument. you know she wanted 3 to do this. 4 okay. i'm going to sit down. 5 mr. johnstone gets a second bite at the apple, 6 he gets to get back up and he gets to talk to 7 you again. why? because they have the burden 8 of proof in this case. they have the burden to 9 prove to you that everything i just said to you 10 is wrong, everything i just said is just flat 11 wrong. 12 they have the burden of proving this case 13 to you, most of it by the greater weight of the 14 evidence. this punitive damages -- some of 15 these punitive damage issues are by clear and 16 convincing evidence, an even much higher 17 standard. 18 and that is why he gets a second bite. i 19 do not know what he is going to do in his closing 20 argument. he may show you more old documents, 21 he may say, well, here's the difference between 22 the manufacturers in europe and south america 23 and canada and philip morris. 24 but you know what? at the bottom, 25 bottom, bottom line, ask yourself -- number 1 one, ask yourself, what is the interaction with 2 mr. hatziyannakis? he saw these ads, he smoked 3 their cigarettes. that is it. in canada, he 4 sees their ads, he smokes their cigarettes. 5 they are equally as dangerous, equally as 6 potentially addictive. in greece, same story. 7 in venezuela, same story. same story. 8 he may get up and show you more old 9 documents. i just ask you to ask yourself 10 this: when you are looking at that document, 11 ask yourself, where is mr. hatziyannakis? what 12 does this document have to do with 13 mr. hatziyannakis? 14 for example, the testimony of the ceo's 15 before congress, where was mr. hatziyannakis? 16 he had already died. that -- that clip, he 17 did not show you the clip, he gave you the quote 18 of the guy commenting on the -- being 19 interviewed after the surgeon general's report, 20 where was mr. hatziyannakis in 1964? he is in 21 either greece or venezuela. he is not here, 22 watching american television. 23 he may put up an old ad or something. 24 ask yourself, where is mr. hatziyannakis? does 25 mr. hatziyannakis see this? 1 he showed you the frank statement. 1954. 2 where was mr. hatziyannakis? he is either in 3 greece or venezuela. is there any evidence in 4 this case that mr. hatziyannakis saw the frank 5 statement? 6 the clerk: you are at 75 minutes, 7 counsel. 8 mr. reilly: thank you. i'm so close to 9 done, as you can tell. 10 okay. please just ask yourselves that, 11 because neither lucy nor i get to get back up 12 again, and say, wait a minute, wait a minute. 13 okay. thank you very much.
