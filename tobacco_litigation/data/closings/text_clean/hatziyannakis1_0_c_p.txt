14 mr. johnstone: good morning, counsel. 15 ladies, good morning. 16 our firm has represented clients here in 17 fort lauderdale, broward county, miami, palm 18 beach, for 50 years. and we are proud to speak 19 for folks that believe in good faith that 20 they have been injured or killed or harmed by the 21 reckless or intentional misconduct or 22 negligence of others. 23 and i'm proud to appear in court before 24 you and his honor, and i thank you, and, more 25 importantly, the family thanks you for your 1 service. 2 you folks have taken notes day in and day 3 out, you have been here on time, you all have 4 jobs -- 5 the court: mostly. 6 mr. johnstone: college students have 7 other things going on. in any case, you folks 8 have been fantastic. 9 and i want you to remember that when we 10 went back through the jury selection process, 11 each of the attorneys, mr. reilly and i had a 12 chance to speak directly with you, and with the 13 judge's help -- and we have gotten a lot of his 14 help, things you do not even know about, with 15 the law -- we were able to agree on you seven 16 folks that everyone seemed to believe would be 17 the most suited, the most qualified to sit as 18 jurors in this case, and we thank you very 19 much. you have done a fantastic job. 20 mr. reilly told you in his opening 21 statement that you wield tremendous power, and 22 that is one of the things that he and i can 23 agree on in this case. 24 you are judges of the facts, and that is 25 why each time you came and went, we rose, just 1 as we did for his honor. 2 you are not wearing black robes, but, in 3 essence, really, you serve as judges of the 4 facts; and then, as you have been told and will 5 learn a little bit more today, you will have a 6 chance to take all of the law -- and some of 7 it is a little bit confusing, a little bit 8 complicated -- and apply it to the facts, to do 9 what? to reach a verdict that is just and true 10 based on the evidence that was presented. 11 now, this is one of the very few, if not 12 the only, countries in the world, that give lay 13 people in the community, citizens that live in 14 the same area as those involved in the case, 15 the power to make decisions of this magnitude. 16 and you do wield tremendous power. 17 and we believe, the family believes, that 18 that power that you wield will be wielded in 19 this case justly and fairly, and that based on 20 the evidence you will hold philip morris 21 responsible to some degree for chris' death. 22 now, when we pursued this case against 23 this tobacco company, we made it very clear 24 from the outset, to anybody and everybody 25 involved, that chris hatziyannakis is, to some 1 extent, responsible for his own death. and 2 we have said that since day one. 3 the first decision that he made, put a 4 cigarette in his mouth when he was being 5 pressured, as so many people are, with peer 6 pressure from friends, guys he works with, was 7 his decision alone. he had the control to do 8 that, and it was a mistake. 9 and chris hatziyannakis paid for that 10 mistake. he paid the ultimate price by 11 developing a particularly aggressive, virulent 12 deadly lung cancer that killed him over about a 13 six-month period, from the time when he first 14 started hacking and coughing up blood, until 15 the time that he died at the hospital, holding 16 his wife's hand, he paid the price. 17 now, we have admitted some fault, and i'll 18 talk to you about that a little bit later, and 19 ask you to consider the fault of philip morris. 20 now, philip morris has not accepted the 21 slightest responsibility at any time, ever, for 22 chris' death. they have continued to argue 23 since the day that we have attempted to hold 24 them responsible, that it is his problem, it is 25 his wife's problem, it is the family, jim's 1 problem, his son, it is not their problem. 2 and they do not -- you can tell from the 3 evidence and by what they have done in this 4 case -- they do not care that their product 5 killed this man. 6 mr. reilly: objection, your honor. 7 "care." 8 the court: overruled. 9 mr. johnstone: philip morris called a 10 single witness, an expert witness that was 11 hired in the washington area, near one of their 12 offices, to come in and tell you what? that 13 this man was not addicted to any cigarettes and 14 was not addicted to philip morris' cigarettes, 15 marlboros. 16 they did not even have a corporate 17 representative, anybody from the company, 18 sitting here during this trial. and that is 19 evidence that they do not care. 20 the court: okay. that is sustained. no 21 more of that. 22 mr. johnstone: yes, sir. they called -- 23 the court: they have a right to defend 24 themselves. 25 mr. johnstone: indeed, they do. 1 the court: so, focus on the evidence. 2 mr. johnstone: the evidence is they did 3 not call any witnesses of any kind after 14 4 years, 15 years, chris has been dead, they did 5 not call a single witness to go through all of 6 their documents, their statements, their 7 positions, to explain them to you, to describe 8 what their thinking was or anything. they 9 did not do that. 10 and even today, as mr. reilly gets up, 11 he is going to suggest to you that philip morris 12 bears no responsibility whatsoever for this 13 man's death, and that is not what the evidence 14 has been. 15 now, i want to show you the verdict form 16 and i want to show you a little bit of law, so 17 you understand what you are being asked to do. 18 let us take a look, if we can, at cl40, 19 please. 20 now, this is the verdict form. i do not 21 think you folks have seen this, and i think 22 it is important that as we go through this 23 closing argument that i'm offering here on 24 behalf of the family this morning, that you get 25 a better feel of what it is you are being asked 1 to do, so we can discuss the issues in light of 2 what the verdict form and the law is. 3 now, can you enlarge that so that we can 4 see what the -- what it says, please? 5 this is the verdict form. now, each of 6 you jurors that retire to deliberate will have 7 a chance to go over all the evidence and the 8 law and to talk among yourselves to reach a 9 unanimous verdict. you must reach a decision 10 that all of you agree on on each of these 11 issues. this is not a state where you can come 12 back four to two or something like that. each 13 of you have to agree on each of the issues. 14 so, the first issue you are being asked to 15 decide in this case: was christos 16 hatziyannakis addicted to cigarettes containing 17 nicotine; and, if so, was such addiction a 18 legal cause of his death. 19 what has the overwhelming evidence been 20 in the case? we know that by the time chris 21 got to canada and smoked in canada before 22 coming to this country in 1973, '74, he was 23 addicted to cigarettes. that is when he smoked 24 full time, that is when he had cigarette packs 25 in his pocket. 1 and you know from the evidence and from 2 your own experience and your own common sense 3 that he was addicted to cigarettes by the time 4 that he got to this country. 5 and he stepped off the plane in 1973, and 6 the first thing he saw in times square was the 7 huge billboard with the smoke billowing from 8 the cowboy's mouth that he saw with his son, 9 harry. 10 and he became addicted to what? the next 11 question. he became addicted, in this country, 12 to cigarettes containing nicotine manufactured 13 by philip morris. 14 he was addicted to all of the cigarettes 15 that he smoked, including philip morris 16 marlboro cigarettes in this country. 17 so, these are the first two questions. 18 and how are you to decide this? you are to 19 decide these two questions by the greater 20 weight of the evidence, what is more probable. 21 was he probably addicted to cigarettes 22 containing nicotine; and was he probably, more 23 likely than not based on all the evidence, 24 addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine 25 manufactured by philip morris? 1 those are the first two questions. and 2 they are very, very important. and all of your 3 subsequent decisions in the case really, for 4 the most part, are based on answering these 5 first two questions. 6 can we see the next page, please? 7 the court: if i might make a suggestion, 8 the verdict form, of course, will be given to 9 you in the jury room, as will my instructions, 10 so i see you feverishly notetaking. the idea 11 is to still be able to move your right or left 12 hand by noon. so, just some caution there. 13 mr. johnstone: that is a good point. 14 thanks, judge. appreciate it. 15 you guys were able to take notes, and you 16 guys were able to ask questions, and you are 17 going to get the instructions and you are going 18 to get the jury verdict form. 19 so, i'm just trying to get you acclimated 20 right now as we listen to the evidence and 21 what is been in the case as to what you are being 22 asked to do. 23 so, those are the first two questions. 24 was he addicted to cigarettes containing 25 nicotine at all, period; and was he addicted to 1 the marlboros. 2 and i'll show you, in due course, that he 3 was, indeed, addicted. in fact, if chris 4 was not addicted, who was? if chris 5 hatziyannakis was not addicted to cigarettes, 6 and addicted to marlboros that contain 7 nicotine, for all those years that he smoked, 8 who in the heck is? 9 we learned from both experts and from the 10 dsm that the vast majority of people who smoke 11 with any regularity are what? dependent. 12 i'll talk about dr. dosovitz in a minute, 13 but he made it clear that when we are talking 14 about the word "addiction," it means dependent, 15 was he dependent on. 16 now, there is no agreement in this case 17 about what addiction is. you will get different 18 definitions and different phrases and different 19 descriptions of addiction depending on who you 20 speak to. 21 but what is very simple and very easy to 22 remember is that everyone agrees that if you 23 are dependent to any degree on cigarettes, you 24 are addicted. 25 and that is the word i would like you to 1 remember when you try to figure out was he 2 addicted, was he dependent. 3 third question: you are going to be asked 4 to decide whether philip morris was negligent; 5 you are going to be asked, in number 4, to 6 decide if the product that they sold was 7 defective and unreasonably dangerous. 8 then can we go to the next page, please? 9 you will be asked to decide whether the 10 cigarettes that philip morris sold to chris for 11 all those years, beginning in '73, up through 12 '78, '79, and then again from '81 up until the 13 time of his death, were defective due to being 14 unfit for the uses intended or reasonably 15 foreseeable. 16 all right. number 6. did chris 17 reasonably rely to his detriment on any 18 statements of philip morris in this regard. 19 may we see the next, please? 20 i hope this helps you understand what 21 you are being asked to decide. 22 number 7: please state whether chris 23 reasonably relied to his detriment on any act 24 done. we will talk about that. was there gross 25 negligence by philip morris; and, if so, was 1 that gross negligence, was that intentional 2 misconduct a cause of chris' death. 3 all right. and let us see the next 4 question. there will be, on the jury verdict 5 form, an opportunity for you to hold both 6 parties responsible, both chris and philip 7 morris. 8 there is no other party, no other 9 manufacturer, both within this country and 10 manufacturers of cigarettes outside the 11 country, that anyone is suggesting is 12 responsible legally for this man's death. 13 so, let me say it again. the only two 14 decisions you have to make on the apportionment 15 of responsibility is between chris and philip 16 morris. there will be no other manufacturers 17 or cigarette brands in this case on this 18 verdict form for your consideration. 19 and you may, if you like, when you get to 20 the jury verdict room, go right to this page 21 and check for chris hatziyannakis, "yes," 22 absolutely, was he negligent. 23 we have conceded that and admitted that 24 since day one. and it will be up to you folks 25 to determine what that percentage is. we will 1 talk about that a little bit later; and then 2 you will have a chance, at this point, to 3 actually determine to what extent the family is 4 entitled to compensation. 5 and, further, whether philip morris acted 6 recklessly, acted with knowledge that their 7 behavior may well have hurt their customers, 8 whether they were grossly negligent, whether 9 they committed fraud, all right? 10 and if you find that, you may check that 11 in this case philip morris, to some extent, 12 should be punished for its behavior by the 13 award of punitive damages. so, i hope that 14 helps. 15 now, let us go up to cl3, please. 16 now, you will hear from his honor that if 17 you find in the first two questions that we 18 talked about, was there negligence -- excuse 19 me, was chris addicted to cigarettes that 20 contain nicotine, and was he addicted to 21 marlboros, if you find that that is true, that 22 he was, based on the evidence in the case, 23 which i'll talk about, you must consider these 24 findings. these findings are binding on you, 25 and i'm going to read them to you very quickly. 1 if you make those determinations to the 2 first two questions, then you will consider 3 this: smoking cigarettes -- 4 because these have been findings in 5 another case that your honor told you about 6 that are binding in this case. 7 smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer. 8 now we know that now. nicotine in cigarettes 9 is addictive. it is addictive. and, in fact, 10 the first two have been admitted in this case 11 by philip morris. 12 dr. dosovitz wanted to argue about 13 whether nicotine may be addictive or is 14 addictive. it is. they admit it, their expert 15 would not, but they admit it. and these are 16 findings binding on you. 17 next, philip morris placed cigarettes on 18 the market that were defective and unreasonably 19 dangerous. 20 next, philip morris concealed or omitted 21 material information not otherwise known or 22 available, knowing that the material was false 23 or misleading, or failed to disclose a material 24 fact concerning the health effects or addictive 25 nature of smoking cigarettes or both. 1 next, you will consider, and it is binding 2 on you jurors in this case, philip morris 3 agreed to conceal or omit information regarding 4 the health effects of cigarettes or their 5 addictive nature with the intention that 6 smokers and the public would rely on this 7 information to their detriment. 8 these are all findings that have already 9 been made. and, again, they are binding on you 10 if you answer "yes" to the first two questions. 11 he was addicted to cigarettes, and he was 12 addicted to philip morris' marlboros. 13 you also must realize that you are bound 14 by this finding: philip morris sold or 15 supplied cigarettes that were defective. 16 philip morris sold or supplied cigarettes that, 17 at the time of the sale or supply, did not 18 conform to representations of fact made by 19 philip morris. 20 and, lastly, you are bound by the finding 21 that philip morris was negligent. 22 now, what i would like to do is to go 23 through some of the evidence with you now, 24 please. and i'm going to stand over here out 25 of the way, so you all can see. 1 i would like to go and discuss with you 2 kind of in chronological order, so we can kind 3 of remember what we talked about, beginning -- 4 i think it was -- i think it was wednesday of 5 last week with dr. burns. we are going to pick 6 up kind of there. 7 now, a lot of information, but it is 8 important information, so i'm going to spend a 9 little time with you on it. 10 in this case, philip morris has admitted 11 the following: these are stipulated facts that 12 they have decided to admit in this case. 13 here's what they have said: we agree with 14 despina that nicotine in cigarettes is 15 addictive. we agree that smoking cigarettes 16 can cause lung cancer. we agree that chris 17 died from a primary lung cancer for which 18 cigarette smoking was the medical cause. 19 now, that is been the evidence, you have 20 seen the medical records, portions of them, and 21 the death certificate. 22 he died of cigarette smoke that he 23 consumed for more than 30 years, most of which 24 were comprised of marlboro cigarettes. 25 number 4: marlboro cigarettes, which 1 were manufactured by philip morris usa, and 2 sold in the u.s., were a substantial 3 contributing of chris hatziyannakis' lung 4 cancer. 5 all right. that is important, because the 6 first two questions are was he addicted to 7 cigarettes that contain nicotine and marlboros 8 that were a legal cause of his death. that is 9 what you are going to see on the verdict form i 10 showed you, and the law that is given you by the 11 judge. 12 and philip morris has actually admitted 13 in this case everything but the last element, 14 that he was addicted. and they have done that 15 because if you find that he was not addicted, 16 despite the overwhelming evidence, they walk 17 out of the courtroom and they are not legally 18 responsible for compensating the family. 19 marlboro cigarettes, which were 20 manufactured by philip morris and sold here to 21 chris, were a contributing, substantial 22 contributing cause of his lung cancer and 23 death. 24 he did not die of any other lung cancer, 25 from any other cigarettes, he died of lung 1 cancer from marlboro cigarettes that he smoked 2 predominantly in his adult life. 3 the last thing that philip morris has 4 admitted and has stipulated to is the 5 following: philip morris admits that it is not 6 claiming and will not suggest to you here in 7 this courtroom that any other american brands, 8 kent, camel, winston, or any other cigarettes 9 smoked by chris in america caused or 10 contributed to cause his lung cancer. 11 and they did that, of course, because for 12 the last 50 years they have worked in unison -- 13 mr. reilly: objection, your honor. 14 the court: sustained. 15 mr. johnstone: now, mr. reilly may try 16 to attempt to tell you that foreign brands of 17 cigarettes caused or contributed to cause his 18 death, and that is for you to decide, and it may 19 or may not be true; but the major competent, 20 substantial contributing cause of chris' death 21 was smoking marlboros. 22 and it is important, after we go through 23 this evidence, on judgment day, that you hold 24 this company accountable for its conduct, and 25 for its behavior and for its peddling of this 1 poison to this man. 2 now, let us go to the next exhibit. 3 (thereupon, the video clip was played and 4 taken down to the best of the reporter's 5 ability as follows:) 6 let me begin my questioning on the matter 7 of whether or not nicotine is addictive. let 8 me ask you first, and i would like to just go 9 down the row, whether each of you believes that 10 nicotine is not addictive. 11 i've heard virtually all of you touch on 12 it, and just "yes" or "no," do you believe 13 nicotine is not addictive? 14 i believe nicotine is not addictive, yes. 15 mr. johnston? 16 congressman, cigarettes and nicotine 17 clearly do not meet the classic definitions of 18 addiction. there is no intoxication. 19 we will take that as a "no," and, again, 20 time is short, if you could just -- i think 21 each of you believe nicotine is not addictive, 22 i just would like to have this for the record. 23 i do not believe that nicotine or our 24 products are addictive. 25 i believe nicotine is not addictive. 1 i believe that nicotine is not addictive. 2 i believe that nicotine is not addictive. 3 and i, too, believe that nicotine is not 4 addictive. 5 mr. johnstone: there is the philip morris 6 ceo, who sells marlboros, testifying under 7 oath, in a congressional hearing, that 8 cigarette smoking is not addictive. it is a 9 lie. it is a lie. it is addictive, and this 10 man was horribly addictive, and there are 11 grades of addiction. 12 dr. dosovitz's testimony the other day 13 regarding whether he was addicted and whether 14 there are degrees of addiction makes no sense. 15 you know better. you have common sense that 16 you can use in this case. we all know smokers 17 who are addicted, we have all seen it, we can 18 smell it, we know what it looks like. 19 and like justice potter, the supreme 20 court justice, who, when asked to describe what 21 pornography is and said, i'm not sure exactly 22 what it is, but i know it when i see it, we 23 know addiction in this courtroom when we see 24 it. 25 and chris hatziyannakis was addicted to 1 cigarettes, the vast majority of his life, and 2 to the cigarettes that philip morris sold him 3 when he got off the plane in new york. 4 next exhibit, please. 5 so, in public -- in public, philip morris 6 is saying nicotine is not addictive. and they 7 did that right up until the time that they were 8 involuntarily made to admit the truth, after 9 chris' death. 10 they never told chris or their other 11 smokers, their other customers, that this was a 12 powerful drug, as powerful as cocaine, 13 morphine, heroin, and that addiction would hook 14 him and make it very, very difficult, if not 15 impossible, to quit smoking. they never told 16 him that. they did the exact opposite. but 17 they knew better. 18 and inside, for years, going back to the 19 50's and 60's, their private documents, their 20 corporate documents that were generated by 21 many, many of their employees, that we finally 22 were able to show you in this courtroom, said 23 what? 24 can you blow up the first two, please? 25 this is their internal documentation that 1 they never shared with chris or anybody else 2 until they were made to. 3 nicotine is a powerful pharmacologic 4 agent with multiple sites of action and may be 5 the most important component of cigarette 6 smoke. 7 the cigarette should be conceived not as 8 a product but as a package. 9 the product is nicotine. internal 10 document: i am told, that the entire matter of 11 addiction is the most potent weapon a 12 prosecuting attorney can have in a lung cancer 13 case. we cannot defend continued smoking as 14 free choice if the person was addicted. 15 now, i want you to think about that for 16 just a minute. i'm not a prosecuting attorney, 17 but i am an attorney speaking on behalf of the 18 hatziyannakis family. and mr. reilly, and his 19 able partners, are speaking on behalf of philip 20 morris; and he has told you repeatedly, in 21 essence, both in opening and through his 22 questions to the witnesses, that chris had free 23 will, that chris could quit smoking any time he 24 wanted, that chris had a choice, a free choice, 25 to smoke or not to smoke. that is not true. 1 the internal documents -- bless you -- the 2 internal documents, going way back to the 60's 3 and 70's, show that philip morris knew that we 4 cannot defend continued smoking as free choice, 5 which is what is being done in this courtroom if 6 the person was addicted because that free 7 choice is eroded, it is impeded. 8 chris did not know that there are 9 nicotinic receptors in his lungs and his brain, 10 and that every time he took a hit of nicotine 11 that washed through his lungs and in his brain, 12 he was becoming more deeply addicted. he had 13 no idea. not a clue. 14 and philip morris knew and continued to 15 sell these products, knowing that they would 16 hook the most vulnerable, and that there was a 17 strong likelihood over time that they would die 18 of some smoking-related disease. 19 at the bottom, another internal document. 20 do we really want to tout cigarette smoke as a 21 drug? they did not want to do that, but it is, 22 of course. they say it is, of course. 23 next document, please. this is blown up, 24 so that you can see. 25 my remarks in this summation are not 1 directed at any of the defense attorneys. fine 2 attorneys, reputable folks. do not mistake what 3 i'm saying. but, in fact, the attorneys acting 4 on behalf of philip morris are attempting in 5 this courtroom with you to defend the 6 indefensible. that is what they have done for the 7 entire week and a half, two weeks we have been 8 here. 9 we cannot defend continued smoking as 10 free choice if the person was addicted. but 11 that is what they are doing in this courtroom 12 today, despite knowing for 25 or 30 years that 13 that is an illegitimate position to take. 14 next document. 15 (thereupon, the video deposition was played 16 and taken down to the best of the reporter's 17 ability as follows:) 18 q. were you employed by philip morris usa? 19 a. yes. 20 mr. reilly: objection. 21 the court: i'm sorry? 22 mr. reilly: i do not believe you permit 23 playing videos. 24 the court: overruled. incorrect. 25 mr. johnstone: would you start again, 1 please? 2 the court: that is testimony they may 3 present. 4 (thereupon, the video deposition was played 5 and taken down to the best of the reporter's 6 ability as follows:) 7 q. were you employed by philip morris usa? 8 a. yes. 9 q. do cigarettes contain nicotine? 10 a. yes. 11 q. does nicotine find its way into the lungs 12 through anything other than tobacco? 13 a. not that i'm aware of, no. 14 q. are there receptors for nicotine in your 15 lungs? 16 a. yes. 17 q. are there things added to the tobacco 18 that goes into cigarettes which contribute to the 19 addictive properties of cigarettes? 20 a. in my opinion, yes. 21 q. are those additives put into cigarettes 22 by the cigarette companies for that purpose, to 23 enhance the addictive nature of smoking? 24 a. in my opinion, yes. 25 q. is the rate at which nicotine enters the 1 body and gets into the system, to the brain, so to 2 speak, something that the cigarette companies enhance 3 or control? 4 a. they control them, yes. and enhance it. 5 q. all right. and who is in control of 6 these design parameters? 7 a. the manufacturer. 8 q. earlier in your testimony you mentioned 9 that nicotine was manipulated. 10 a. yes. 11 q. is urea another additive that is used in 12 cigarettes? 13 a. yes, it is. 14 q. and what was the purpose of putting urea 15 in the cigarette? 16 a. when you burn urea, it makes ammonia. 17 and ammonia, as we have talked about a little bit 18 earlier, can change the characteristics of nicotine. 19 it can help remove nicotine from tobacco, and it can 20 also change it to the free-base form, which makes it 21 transmit across tissue faster. 22 q. was urea added for that purpose, to 23 free-base the nicotine? 24 a. yeah. they did not need it for any other 25 purpose. so, yes. 1 q. and did the people that you worked with 2 at philip morris, that were involved in it, did they 3 believe or express to you that they believed that that 4 helped them sell cigarettes? 5 a. yes. 6 q. and did they express to you that they 7 knew that smoking was, in fact, addictive? 8 a. yes. 9 q. and did they think that -- that these 10 compounds, ammonia, urea and so forth enhanced the 11 addictive nature of cigarettes? 12 a. yes. 13 mr. johnstone: that is outrageous. was 14 chris hatziyannakis in control of how these 15 cigarettes were manufactured, so that the smoke 16 was like free-base that hit his lungs and then 17 his brain and hooked him right up until the 18 time that he died? 19 this was a man who was so addicted to 20 marlboro cigarettes that even after he got the 21 lung cancer diagnosis, and was shocked and 22 frightened, his addiction was so strong, he 23 continued to smoke. 24 and we know that from clio, who was 25 sitting next to him as he met with his 1 physician before radiation therapy. 2 the only time that he quit smoking 3 permanently after these cigarettes were 4 manipulated and additives were included with 5 the tobacco to hook him was when he had 6 radiation therapy to his chest, which made him 7 so deathly ill, so sick, he could not swallow, 8 he could not eat, and he certainly could not 9 smoke. that is how addicted this man was. 10 do any of you really believe for an 11 instant, after hearing all of this evidence, 12 that chris was never addicted to any degree on 13 cigarettes? he was not dependent on marlboro 14 cigarettes, that he was hiding from his family? 15 do you really believe that? 16 and why would you believe a witness that 17 is brought in from washington, dr. dosovitz, 18 who is the only person you heard from to ever 19 say he was not addicted? 20 why would you believe a word he said when 21 he is been hired by philip morris, who has lied 22 to us for 50 years? would you really believe 23 what he said? was he credible? did you think 24 that his demeanor was convincing? do you think 25 he really believed what he was saying? 1 juxtapose his comments and his testimony 2 with dr. burns. and we will talk about 3 dr. burns, who has worked in the public health 4 service, and has helped edit or write at least 5 five separate surgeon general reports. 6 every question that was asked of him, he 7 was cordial and polite, and answered the 8 question truthfully and quickly and honestly. 9 is that what you watched dr. dosovitz do the 10 other day? and, yes, i was upset. 11 now, i apologize to any of you if i've 12 said or done anything in this courtroom in any 13 way to upset either the court or you jurors; 14 but, yes, i was upset, because i watched him, 15 you saw him. 16 mr. reilly: objection, your honor. 17 the court: overruled. 18 mr. johnstone: now, let us go to the next 19 exhibit, please. 20 going back -- and i'm going to move along 21 here -- going back to the 50's, the public 22 statement that philip morris offered to all of 23 its customers, and this is an environment that 24 they helped create. you younger folks may not 25 recall the 50's, 60's and 70's, when everybody 1 smoked everywhere. 2 but the public statement that was being 3 offered by philip morris was: we accept an 4 interest in people's health as a basic 5 responsibility paramount to every other 6 consideration in our business. we have -- we 7 have and always will cooperate closely with 8 those whose task it is to safeguard the public 9 health. 10 people like dr. burns. a harvard 11 graduate who wrote a huge chapter in harrison's 12 textbook. people like dr. burns, who have 13 spoken out in the public health interest since 14 the 70's. 15 their private remarks, 1977, when the 16 man's here smoking, in new york, hits the 17 tarmac, he is addicted to cigarettes, that is 18 right, and you can hold him responsible for 19 that addiction as he comes to this country. 20 and you must hold these people 21 responsible for the continued addiction that 22 they fostered in him and helped him with and 23 encouraged him with throughout the rest of his 24 lifetime in this country. 25 this family has lived as citizens doing 1 the right things, as immigrant greek citizens 2 in this country, going back to the early 70's. 3 and i'm asking you to hold philip morris 4 responsible to this family for their 5 misconduct, because look what they did. 6 smoker psychology program. first every 7 undertaking has to have some mission. i would 8 state our charter from philip morris in this 9 fashion: study the psychology of the smoker in 10 search of information that can increase 11 corporate profits. 12 yeah. that does not sound to me as though 13 they will cooperate closely with those whose 14 task it is to safeguard the public health. 15 when i asked dr. dosovitz, their paid 16 expert, who they paid something like 70 grand 17 or something to, in this case alone, whether 18 the surgeon general is a recognized medical 19 expert in this country, he said "yes" on the 20 stand; and we went back to a depo he gave two 21 months ago where he said no, he was not, i do not 22 agree with that; is that cooperating closely 23 with those whose task it is to safeguard the 24 public health? 25 look what else they say at the bottom. 1 our position should obviously be supportive of 2 jet's for the primitive reason of "who ain't 3 for more money?" 4 once again, i'm forced of the opinion 5 that the program -- 6 this is the tobacco research council that 7 they set up, that was actually starting to 8 disclose how bad cigarette smoke was and how 9 addictive it was, one of the folks that worked 10 for philip morris said that program seems to be 11 misdirected since its main mission seems to be 12 to prove that smoking causes cancer. 13 well, of course, it does. their 14 cigarettes, they have admitted, caused his lung 15 cancer, but they were not telling the public 16 that. 17 next document. now, this is another 18 employee of philip morris, just like the fellow 19 whose video we just watched a minute ago. and 20 he was asked in deposition, on the stand, and 21 you can read this for yourself. two hundred 22 thirty billion cigarettes philip morris sells a 23 year. we know that they have fifty percent market 24 share, they are the single biggest manufacturer 25 by distribution by volume of cigarettes in the 1 country. 2 next document. they spent $200 million a 3 year, at least during this five-year period, 4 when chris was smoking their cigarettes, they 5 spent in or around $200 million a year in 6 advertising. 7 next document. james morgan was deposed, 8 and john and steve hammer read portions of 9 this, and i want to enlarge the second and 10 third paragraph. bring it down, please. right 11 there. those two paragraphs. thank you. 12 and there is -- this is all in evidence, 13 you can read them for yourselves. 14 early on, we were talking about 15 marketing, and i think i used the word 16 "integration." i think marlboro integrates its 17 products and total proposition extremely well. 18 what does that mean? it means it floods 19 the marketplace with their cigarettes and with 20 their advertisements, all of which chris 21 hatziyannakis saw in this country all through 22 the 70's and 80's. 23 secondly, i think its packaging is 24 excellent. i believe its advertising is 25 excellent. i believe its sales promotion 1 programs are excellent. 2 can you go to the next paragraph? right 3 down there at the bottom. 4 we spent -- we spend a lot of money 5 making sure that things like the tear tape on 6 the cellophane are always in the right 7 position, not defective. we really try to make 8 that brand the highest quality brand that we 9 can make. 10 so, if you are asking yourselves, yes, 11 chris was addicted to cigarettes when he came 12 to this country, why did he start smoking 13 marlboros, it is because of the concerted 14 attempt to make their brand the most 15 interesting, most well advertised, easiest to 16 open, most consistently addictive, both 17 visually and physically, cigarette that you can 18 buy in america. and they did it on purpose. 19 and they knew that. and that is wrong. it is 20 outrageous. 21 next exhibit, please. and so when chris 22 gets off the airplane, and as he drives down 95 23 and as he heads to miami or tampa or to his 24 son's school, what does he see? 25 you may not recall this, some of the 1 younger folks. these advertisements were 2 plastered all over south florida, and they were 3 in magazines, and he saw them, and we know that 4 as a young father he was taken by the american 5 cowboy, clint eastwood and others, that he 6 admired and tried to emulate. 7 and what does he see? he looks at these 8 and says, gee, that guy looks pretty healthy, 9 he does not look like he is got lung cancer to 10 me, my dad's 98 years old. 11 and he did believe he was going to 12 continue living, and he paid the price. he 13 paid the ultimate price. he is in a grave in 14 memorial -- in hollywood, after leaving 15 memorial, that his wife continues to visit all 16 these years later. he paid the price. 17 what did she do wrong? her name is not on 18 the jury verdict form. 19 mr. reilly: objection, your honor. 20 the court: sustained. 21 mr. johnstone: what did she do wrong? 22 the court: sustained. 23 mr. reilly: motion, your honor. 24 the court: step in the jury room, 25 please. 1 (whereupon, the following proceedings 2 were had outside the hearing of the jury:) 3 the court: i can barely hear you, 4 mr. reilly. 5 mr. reilly: i appreciate -- 6 the court: you need to keep your energy 7 level up for at least another day, sir. 8 mr. reilly: okay. 9 the court: now, what are you talking 10 about? 11 mr. reilly: this is the third improper 12 argument that counsel has made. there is a 13 cumulative effect. even though your honor has 14 sustained my objections to each of his improper 15 arguments, there is a cumulative effect. he is 16 violated -- 17 the court: denied. denied. denied. 18 mr. reilly: well, the argument -- 19 the court: in fact, the first one i 20 admonished him in front of the jury. 21 mr. reilly: you did. 22 the court: so, it had the exact opposite 23 effect. it not only cured any prejudice, it 24 let the jury know he did something wrong. 25 overruled, denied. 1 bring the jury out. you have got to be 2 careful, mr. johnstone. 3 mr. johnstone: yes, your honor. thank 4 you, judge. 5 (whereupon, the following proceedings 6 were had within the hearing of the jury:) 7 mr. johnstone: ladies, on the jury 8 verdict form, as you look at the jury verdict 9 form, there are two parties or two entities 10 that you are to determine were at fault. chris 11 and philip morris. that is it. those are the 12 only two parties that you are going to be 13 considering respective fault. 14 and if you make an award in this case, 15 the verdict will be reduced by that respective 16 fault. for instance, if you were to award a 17 hundred dollars, for the sake of argument, and 18 you found chris 25 percent responsible, the 19 award to the family would be $75. 20 so, when you attach comparative 21 negligence to the respective parties, and weigh 22 their respective fault, please remember that. 23 that is what happens. that is what your verdict 24 means. you hold chris a percentage 25 responsibility and the award is diminished by 1 that. 2 next exhibit, please. 3 again, do not see an oxygen bottle 4 trailing behind this cowboy. looks pretty 5 healthy, virile, another chiseled cowboy 6 galloping across the colorado hillside. 7 and this is what he saw over and over and 8 over again, day-in and day-out, and he made a 9 connection between the strong cowboy actors he 10 saw on tv or in the movies and these 11 advertisements. 12 and so what did he do? 13 next video, please, or next image. 14 he actually dressed his kid, harry -- i'm 15 not so sure about jim, but we know harry -- in 16 cowboy outfits. 17 now, it is not the marlboro outfit, but 18 for a young boy it is pretty close. he is got 19 his badge and his two six-shooters on his hips; 20 and you cannot see it in that photo, but he is 21 got cowboy boots on and his cowboy hat. 22 and even years, years later, 12, 15 years 23 later, chris had around the house -- or harry 24 did, because his father had encouraged him to, 25 a cowboy hat, and he is got jeans on and boots, 1 as well. 2 next image, please. 3 and, so, as chris, with his addiction 4 that he is responsible for, that we agree he 5 should be held responsible for, for smoking 6 brands outside the country, comes to this 7 country to raise his two sons, he starts buying 8 cigarettes by the carton because he is so 9 addicted. 10 he is terrified that he is going to be 11 without cigarettes during the normal day, so he 12 goes to the seminole reservation, out on 441, 13 and picks up as many as two or three cartons at 14 a time, so that he is always got cigarettes; and 15 after they go shopping, he hands it to his 16 wife, and you can see the bag with marlboros 17 inside. 18 next image, please. now, this is the 19 sworn testimony in this courtroom that you 20 heard from dr. burns. again, you will have the 21 ability, as you speak to one another in the 22 back, to talk about dr. burns and whether you 23 found him to be believable, whether you found 24 him to be a credible witness, whether he 25 answered questions directly, whether he had the 1 knowledge and experience to comment on 2 addiction. 3 this is a pulmonologist who has spent 4 many years in intensive care units taking care 5 of smokers with emphysema, and with lung 6 cancer, and with chronic obstructive pulmonary 7 disease, who is written and spoken widely on 8 cigarette smoke, cancer-causing agents, 9 addiction, and actually contributed, as i said, 10 to many of the surgeon general reports by 11 either writing portions of it or editing. 12 and he says, when asked: do you know 13 approximately when chris returned to this 14 country and began smoking the marlboros 15 predominantly, if not exclusively? 16 and he is right, the undisputed evidence, 17 since 1973, '74, folks were living in new york, 18 he says: chris hatziyannakis died of lung 19 cancer because he was addicted to the nicotine 20 in marlboro cigarettes. absent that addiction, 21 absent that addiction, he never would have 22 continued the repetitive exposure to all those 23 cancer-causing substances that ultimately 24 resulted in his cancer. 25 question: is there any question in your 1 mind that chris was addicted to philip morris' 2 cigarettes, the marlboros that led directly to 3 his death in 1994? 4 none whatsoever. 5 if philip morris had actually 6 manufactured a cigarette that it did not add 7 ammonia to, urea to, if it did not create a 8 free-base effect that hooked people like 9 chris -- for instance, if they had sold 10 cigarettes that did not contain nicotine or much 11 less nicotine -- chris would not have been 12 addicted to their cigarettes; but they did not 13 do that because they know why people smoke 14 cigarettes. it is not for the flavor or the 15 taste, not really. it is for the nicotine that 16 they manipulate in the cigarettes that they 17 sell the public, including chris, and that is 18 why he was addicted to their cigarettes and 19 that is why he was hooked and that is exactly 20 what they wanted. 21 and now it is time for them to be held 22 responsible. because without you, they will 23 not accept responsibility of any kind. not 24 one percent, not one percent will they say, 25 yes, we have some responsibility, we accept 1 that, we are willing to be held accountable. 2 you jurors are the only people in this 3 case that are able to hold this company, philip 4 morris, accountable. 5 next exhibit, please. 6 the clerk: you are at 50 minutes, 7 counsel. 8 mr. johnstone: thank you. we know that 9 he smoked mostly marlboros, it is undisputed. 10 they have admitted their cigarettes caused his 11 death. 12 next exhibit, please. 13 and there he is, smoking their 14 cigarettes. we gave them everything in the way 15 of documentation, photographs, that we had. we 16 gave them the photographs that they never sent 17 to their expert. 18 the gentleman that they brought to this 19 courtroom, who is supposed to use the dsm-iv as 20 a guide to help him make a determination as to 21 whether chris was addicted, never interviewed 22 or asked to interview the family or to look at 23 photographs -- 24 mr. reilly: objection, your honor. 25 there is no legal basis for interviewing family. 1 the court: overruled. 2 mr. johnstone: he did not ask at any time 3 to interview the family as a psychiatrist. 4 mr. reilly: objection, your honor. 5 mr. johnstone: he did not ask -- 6 the court: overruled. 7 mr. johnstone: he did not ask for the 8 photographs, and they did not send them to him. 9 nor did they send him any of the internal 10 documents that we have been talking about for a 11 week. that is the expert, the only person after 12 all these years, that philip morris has brought 13 in the courtroom. 14 cross-examination by mr. reilly of 15 dr. burns. so, when i finished, mr. reilly got 16 up and he began to ask questions. that was 17 first his chance to examine the witness to make 18 sure that the jury had all the information that 19 he thought was important. 20 and this is what he asked: if, in fact, 21 mr. hatziyannakis -- this is mr. reilly -- 22 began smoking in greece as a young adult, the 23 decision to begin smoking would have been 24 mr. hatziyannakis'; correct? 25 answer: i'm not sure why it would make a 1 difference where he started smoking cigarettes. 2 and what did mr. reilly say? it probably 3 does not. 4 he is just putting a time frame on it. it 5 probably does not matter where he started 6 smoking cigarettes. 7 now, think about that for a minute. it 8 does not matter. not in this case. not in the 9 family's lawsuit that they have brought against 10 this company. it does not matter where he 11 began. 12 they do not walk out of this courtroom 13 because he began to smoke outside the country. 14 that is not the issue you are being asked to 15 decide. 16 what did we learn? was he addicted to 17 cigarettes that contain nicotine, and, later, 18 was he addicted to marlboros? the overwhelming 19 evidence is yes. it does not matter. 20 so, listen carefully when mr. reilly gets 21 up to address you in his summation. and remind 22 yourselves mentally, he is talking about foreign 23 cigarettes, we are talking about issues that he, 24 himself, has admitted does not matter. what 25 else is he going to talk about? 1 they have already admitted that he died 2 from smoking their cigarettes. they already 3 admitted that he was a resident of the state of 4 florida. they have already admitted that 5 cigarettes are addictive. they have already 6 admitted that the cigarettes that are addictive 7 can cause lung cancer, like he had. 8 what else are they going to talk about 9 when they will not accept responsibility? 10 things like whether he started smoking in 11 greece, or whether he smoked earlier in life. 12 it probably does not matter, he said, and he is 13 right, it does not make the slightest difference 14 in this case. so keep that in mind. 15 next exhibit, please. 16 now, dr. burns explained that people 17 smoked everywhere. it was in the environment. 18 it was normal. and we have this belief, as 19 human beings, that things that are normal cannot 20 be very dangerous. 21 what happens is people then consider it 22 normal, it is normal to smoke. and part of what 23 "normal" means is it cannot be very dangerous 24 for you. i mean, it might have a little bit of 25 risk, you know, maybe something's out there, 1 but it cannot be really bad for you because 2 everyone does it. 3 and especially when, as in this case, the 4 tobacco company, philip morris, continued to 5 bomb the public with misinformation and 6 denials. 7 next exhibit. 8 psychological crutch. this is a memo, 9 philip morris, way back in 1964. at some 10 point, reflecting the same seriousness with 11 which we met the report -- the surgeon 12 general's report, '64 -- we must in the near 13 future provide some answers which will give 14 smokers a psychological crutch and a 15 self-rationale to continue smoking. 16 and they did. they said you can quit any 17 time, nicotine is not addictive, it is a choice. 18 you have free will. you like the flavor, 19 everybody smokes. we disagree it is dangerous, 20 it does not cause cancer. you have heard that. 21 and that is not true, and they have known it since 22 1964, when i was living in winter haven as a 23 five-year-old. 24 next exhibit. 25 mr. reilly: objection, your honor. 1 the court: sustained. do not 2 personalize again, sir. 3 mr. johnstone: yes, your honor. 4 tobacco institute, fraud and concealment. 5 may 1st, 1972. for nearly 20 years, this 6 industry has employed a single strategy to 7 defend itself on major fronts. internal 8 documents from the tobacco institute directly 9 aligned with philip morris. 10 politics and public opinion. while the 11 strategy was brilliantly conceived and executed 12 over the years, helping to win important 13 battles, it is only fair to say that it is not, 14 nor was it intended to be, a vehicle for 15 victory. 16 on the contrary, it has always been a 17 holding strategy, consisting of creating doubt 18 about the health charge, without denying it; 19 advocating the public's right to smoke, without 20 actually urging them to take up the practice, 21 1972. 22 next document. chris did not know about 23 nicotinic receptors. i wanted you to 24 understand that it is not free will whether you 25 smoke addicting cigarettes like marlboros. 1 it is not just free will. 2 the free will is eroded by the release of 3 chemicals and the pickup in the lungs and brain 4 of the nicotine that sends a cascade or shower 5 of dopamines and other chemicals to the brain. 6 and that is what hooks you, and that is 7 what causes you to have terrible withdrawal 8 symptoms and shakes and nervousness and upset, 9 when you cannot get your fix. when you cannot 10 get your drug delivery device, and get your 11 fix, your brain screams for nicotine. that is 12 what this exhibit was about. it is 13 physiological as well as psychological. 14 next exhibit, please. broken promises. 15 philip morris accepts an interest in people's 16 health. philip morris will cooperate closely. 17 we find -- if we find any components of tobacco 18 smoke that we consider harmful, we will remove 19 them. way back in 1955. 20 we want to be the detective just as much 21 as the surgeon general and the american medical 22 association, we will cooperate in any way. 23 if we find any bad elements in tobacco, 24 we will remove them. 25 it is not true. it was a conspiracy by 1 philip morris with the other tobacco companies 2 in this country to spread misinformation for 50 3 years. 4 next exhibit. 5 mr. farone. i think we have looked at 6 this. maybe not. have we looked at this? i 7 think we did. that was the testimony. 8 dr. burns, control. philip morris 9 certainly controlled -- 10 this is dr. burns on the stand, the 11 fellow that came in from the university of 12 california san diego where he is still a 13 professor emeritus at the university. 14 philip morris certainly does control the 15 amount of nicotine in their product very 16 closely as part of the manufacturing process. 17 they do it with a variety of different 18 approaches, and they do it very carefully; and 19 then they test it to make sure they have done it. 20 so, they do control the amount of nicotine 21 present in cigarettes. 22 philip morris knew it had to control the 23 amount of nicotine to ensure that people would 24 continue to come back and buy their product. 25 now, on the issue of chris -- and he is 1 worked with hundreds of addicted people -- 2 chris felt, in a sense, angered at the 3 cigarettes for controlling him. that is what 4 throwing them away and stomping on them or 5 stepping on them means. 6 if you are not addicted, you do not see 7 cigarettes as controlling your life and 8 something you need to attack by destroying 9 them. 10 he knew that he was addicted. he told 11 people like george that he was addicted. he 12 even used -- and i cannot pronounce it -- he 13 used a greek phrase to describe his own 14 addiction. 15 and what did their expert say just 16 yesterday to one of you jurors' questions about 17 the following? do addicts come to you and try 18 to deny that they are addicted? and 19 dr. dosovitz admitted, no, they actually tell 20 me they are addicted, they know better than 21 anyone. they are actually very intelligent 22 about that and recognize that they are 23 addicted. 24 i do not remember which one of the jurors 25 asked the question, but that was the question 1 and answer that came yesterday. 2 chris knew he was addicted. he was so 3 addicted, he thought of the cigarettes as some 4 third-party entity, that he had to kill. he 5 threw them on the ground and jumped on them. 6 if you are not addicted, you do not see 7 cigarettes as controlling you. 8 and at the bottom, often when somebody is 9 addicted and quits and says to their family 10 they have quit, when they relapse back, they 11 often try to hide that because they are 12 embarrassed about the fact they cannot control 13 their own behavior. 14 their expert, dosovitz, admitted on the 15 stand that he relapsed. he relapsed. he was 16 dependent on cigarettes. 17 next exhibit. this is important because 18 way back in '64, this gentleman, who was the 19 philip morris ceo at the time, said the 20 following: obviously, a filter -- 21 if you look at the bottom sentence at the 22 top, obviously, a filter takes out certain tar 23 and nicotine. 24 and there was an illusion that philip 25 morris tried to give the public that if you 1 smoked filtered cigarettes, tar and nicotine 2 and other cancer-causing agents would be 3 absorbed by the filter and they would be safer. 4 that is what the testimony has been, and that is 5 what that means. that is the public remark. 6 the private remark is the illusion of 7 filtration is as important as the fact of 8 filtration. 9 it was an illusion. it was not true. 10 despina thought it was true. she spoke 11 directly with her husband, and said, look, if 12 you are going to have to smoke, try to smoke 13 these cigarettes that are filtered; and he did, 14 both du maurier in canada, and marlboros here. 15 and she told us he was under the 16 impression, by smoking those cigarettes, he 17 would please me, and that those filters would 18 protect him from additives and cancer-causing 19 agents. 20 next exhibit. 21 and it was not true. it is a lie. 22 knowledge of carcinogens. philip morris has 23 said since '64, if there are bad elements 24 through our laboratories, we hope we may find 25 them; and if they are found, they will be 1 removed. 2 well, that is preposterous because they 3 had known three years earlier that by that time 4 there were at least 20 known cancer-causing 5 agents, and we need to go to the next exhibit. 6 okay. let us go to the next exhibit. 7 1968, our basic position in the cigarette 8 controversy is subject to the charge, and may 9 be subject to a finding that we are making 10 false and misleading statements to promote the 11 sale of cigarettes. they knew that back in 12 '68. that it may come to light someday. and 13 they still did it. 14 next example. let us go to the next 15 example. 16 (thereupon, the video clip was played and 17 taken down to the best of the reporter's 18 ability as follows:) 19 we asked philip morris, r.j. reynolds, 20 brown & williamson and lorrilard to appear on 21 this program. none would. they told us to 22 talk to the tobacco institute. the institute 23 said anne browder would speak for them. 24 the case is still open. the jury has not 25 come in. 1 it may not be harmful. you are not 2 convinced? 3 it may be or it may not be. we do not 4 know. 5 mr. johnstone: now, i could go on for 6 another half an hour, but there is not adequate 7 time, and i need to save a little bit of time 8 to speak to you later. 9 and so i'm going to ask you to bear with 10 me for a couple of minutes as we go through the 11 verdict form, and i'm going to ask you to 12 follow along, as i show you what the family 13 recommends that you consider in this case, if 14 we could, please. 15 can we turn this elmo on, please? 16 thanks. 17 this verdict form is, i believe, 18 identical or very, very similar to the one that 19 you are going to get. 20 thank you. thank you very much. 21 we see that judge streitfeld, our judge, 22 is at the top of the verdict form. we, the 23 jury, return the following verdict. 24 one of you will be chosen to serve as the 25 foreperson, and will announce your verdict in 1 open court when you have reached the conclusion 2 or the decisions that you have all decided on. 3 was chris addicted to cigarettes 4 containing nicotine, to any degree was he 5 dependent on cigarettes? 6 of course he was. that is been the 7 overwhelming evidence. they called no 8 witnesses, other than dosovitz, to tell you he 9 was not. his testimony, i will suggest to you, 10 was not credible. 11 next question: was chris hatziyannakis 12 addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine 13 manufactured by philip morris usa; and, if so, 14 was such addiction a legal cause of his injury, 15 his death? the overwhelming evidence is of 16 course that it was. 17 now, this is important, please. one of 18 the instructions that you are going to get, the 19 law in the case, on both of these issues will 20 read, essentially, as follows: in order to be 21 regarded as a legal cause of death, addiction 22 need not be the only cause. addiction may be a 23 legal cause of death even though it operated in 24 combination with some natural cause or some 25 other cause, if such other cause occurs at the 1 same time. 2 now, this is what this means: these 3 folks are going to get up and say, the sole 4 cause of his death was his own decision. and 5 we know that is not true. we know that there 6 are two responsible parties in this case. one 7 is chris, we have acknowledged that, and one is 8 philip morris. 9 and i want you to understand that you 10 have the evidence and you have the law to hold 11 both of these folks responsible, and i'm asking 12 you to do that based on the overwhelming 13 evidence in this case. 14 if you look at the next page that you 15 folks are going to get, please state whether 16 the negligence -- forgive me -- please state 17 whether the negligence of philip morris usa -- 18 let me get my glasses -- was a legal cause of 19 chris' death. the answer is yes. 20 and i went through these with you a 21 little earlier; and i'm asking, as you go 22 through the evidence in the case, that you hold 23 philip morris responsible in this case for each 24 of the claims that have been made by the 25 family, both jim and his wife, despina. 1 and you will see as you go through them 2 there are a number of separate claims, and 3 whether he relied to his detriment on 4 misstatements that we have been talking about ad 5 nauseam for days. 6 again, if you get to the bottom, as i 7 believe the evidence suggests you will, if you 8 look at number 8: was there gross negligence 9 by philip morris; and, if so, was that gross 10 negligence a legal cause. was it "a," not the 11 only legal cause, was it a legal cause. 12 please do not be confused by that. there 13 may be more than one reason for chris' death. 14 his own behavior and decision-making, and the 15 acts and fraud and misrepresentation and 16 purposeful hiding of facts without any concern 17 for the consequences of their actions by philip 18 morris. the answer is "yes." 19 please state the percentage of any 20 responsibility for chris' death that you charge 21 to philip morris. 22 now, i have suggested to you based on 23 their superior knowledge, their information 24 going back to the 60's, that they hid from the 25 country, from their fellow americans, and from 1 this man when he moved to this country in the 2 70's and lived here all through the time of his 3 death in the 90's, that an appropriate 4 distribution of responsibility in this case is 5 philip morris 75 percent, and chris 6 hatziyannakis, 25 percent. 7 all of these decisions on the 8 apportionment of fault, and the compensation to 9 which the family is entitled in this case are 10 your decisions. and you may exercise that 11 power as you deem appropriate based on the 12 facts and the law given to you by the court. 13 what is the total amount of damages 14 sustained by despina hatziyannakis for the loss 15 of her husband's companionship and protection 16 and for pain and suffering as a result of her 17 husband's death? 18 and i suggest to you that you consider in 19 the past, for the 16 years that she is lived 20 without her husband, a figure of $10 million. 21 we know that she is healthy, and that she is 22 going to live, more likely than not, another 23 15, 20, 25 years. and i ask you to consider 24 compensating her for the death of her husband 25 in the future with $10 million. 1 this is a woman, after her husband's 2 death, who continued to work and goes to 3 hollywood to this day to open and close her 4 shop, and steps out into the dark alone at 5 night, and goes home to her quiet home at 6 eleven, 12:00 at night. she has a picture of 7 her husband at her bedside that she speaks to 8 and prays to each night. she continues to 9 visit his grave. 10 she has told you that he was her life, he 11 is the father of her sons, and she never 12 considered remarrying. she loves him dearly to 13 this day, and philip morris is responsible to 14 some significant degree for that man's gruesome 15 death. 16 the clerk: you are at 70 minutes, 17 counsel. 18 mr. johnstone: thank you. 19 because the eldest son, harry, who you 20 heard from, was over the age of 25 at the time 21 of his father's death, the law in florida does 22 not recognize his claim, and that is why 23 although you heard from harry, and he is a son, 24 he does not have a legal claim in florida 25 because that is what the legislature determined. 1 because jim was 22 when his father died, he 2 does have a claim in florida that is 3 recognized. 4 now, you know how much both of those boys 5 loved their father, you heard from both of 6 them. i'm asking you to consider in this case 7 jim's claim for the loss of his father, his 8 guidance and companionship, his father's 9 inability to ever come to his wedding, meet his 10 wife, see what he does in life, give him help 11 and guidance, and speak to him as fathers and 12 sons do. he is lost that all these years, and 13 will never have a father again. he was taken 14 away from him in 1994. 15 and the figures that i've suggested to 16 you are $2.5 million in the past, and 17 $2.5 million in the future. 18 we already know, because the defendants, 19 philip morris, have already agreed that the 20 total amount of economic damages sustained by 21 mrs. hatziyannakis' husband's estate is 22 $114,609. 23 these decisions that you make are yours 24 alone, and we will respect your decision. 25 the last decision that you have to make 1 today as you retire is the following: under 2 the circumstances of this case, state whether 3 you find by clear and convincing evidence that 4 punitive damages are warranted against philip 5 morris usa. 6 the clear and convincing evidence in this 7 case is that they lied and manipulated and 8 disseminated misinformation and confused and 9 created an environment all through the 60's, 10 70's, 80's, up and through the time of chris' 11 death, that encouraged smokers to smoke, they 12 directed their message to those that are 13 addicted. 14 their message was not focused on those 15 that do not smoke. their message was focused on 16 the most vulnerable, who were looking for a 17 psychological crutch and reassurance that 18 smoking was not addictive, it would not cause 19 death. that was an outrageous lie. 20 outrageous. and i'm asking you to hold these 21 folks in this courtroom, in this case, 22 responsible. 23 we respect your decision and we thank 24 you. and i'm going to have a couple of minutes 25 to speak to you when mr. reilly is through. 1 i'll have a couple of remarks for you. i've 2 tried very hard to give you the information 3 that you need to make an intelligent, just 4 decision as jurors in the case. i believe that 5 we have been able to do that for the family. 6 thank you. 4 mr. johnstone: okay. i just have a few 5 minutes that i'm going to speak with you before 6 lunch. i know everybody's hungry, you all have 7 been here for the better part of two weeks. 8 please let me respond for a few minutes, 9 and we will get the law and your jury verdict 10 form, and you can get to work on reaching a 11 fair and just verdict in the case. 12 the only personality that does not really 13 change is mr. reilly's. he is a very nice guy, 14 and he is an able spokesperson for philip 15 morris, and he has attempted in his closing 16 statements to, essentially, change the focus 17 and to continue to defend the indefensible. 18 there have been some statements that he made 19 that i would like to address, if i may. 20 the family has accepted responsibility to 21 some extent for all the cigarettes that chris 22 smoked. it is not as though we are suggesting 23 that he is not responsible for cigarettes that 24 he smoked abroad. 25 i told you in opening statement that we 1 provided evidence to the other side and 2 photographs that he smoked certainly in 3 venezuela, and in canada, and we know he smoked 4 in the u.s. 5 now, mrs. hatziyannakis, when she took 6 the stand, never indicated, never told you that 7 he had never smoked at all outside of greece, 8 outside of canada. 9 what she said was that he became a 10 full-time smoker and started actually having a 11 pack of cigarettes in her pocket -- his pocket, 12 rather, he did, in canada, when he started 13 smoking du maurier. that is the testimony, and 14 that is what we have been telling you since the 15 case began. 16 now, let me focus on a few things that 17 were said about what changed, what is different. 18 there is no evidence whatsoever, although i 19 suppose if mr. reilly had chosen to, he could 20 have brought you evidence and spoken to you 21 folks about the advertising and about the 22 public statements that were made by foreign 23 tobacco companies. he did not do that. 24 what changed when mr. hatziyannakis 25 looked in the mirror in 1973, '74, '75, '76, up 1 through 1979, and then all through the 80's and 2 early 90's, is that philip morris, in this 3 case, purposefully targeted, with advertising, 4 people like mr. hatziyannakis, who were the 5 most vulnerable to that advertising. 6 we know why he started smoking marlboros. 7 we know that he was addicted to cigarettes 8 before he came to the country, and we know he 9 was addicted to marlboros throughout his entire 10 life here in this country for the last 20 years 11 of his life. 12 now, there were remarks made by 13 mr. reilly about nicotine patches, professional 14 help. there is been no evidence or testimony 15 that nicotine patches were even available in 16 the last years of this man's life. what 17 testimony was there? 18 professional help? this is a fellow that 19 never went to the doctor. he had been 20 perfectly healthy up until the time that he got 21 sick with his lung cancer and the hacking and 22 the blood in his sputum started to cause him 23 problems and sent him to the doctor. 24 we accept full responsibility for his 25 attempts and his failures to quit smoking. 1 we have heard that he tried to quit as many as 2 ten times. 3 you folks know in your hearts that he was 4 addicted to cigarettes, that is the first 5 question; and you know that he was addicted to 6 marlboros. he smoked them for the last 14 7 years of his life, almost exclusively. the 8 jury verdict form, the first two questions that 9 you answer, are those first two questions. 10 and it is critical that you understand 11 that dr. burns, a foremost expert in the 12 country on this topic, made it crystal clear 13 that he was addicted to cigarettes and to 14 marlboros. 15 the fellow that they brought from 16 washington, d.c., mr. -- or dr. dosovitz, used 17 for his diagnosis and his opinion that this man 18 was not addicted, the dsm. that diagnosis can 19 be made using the dsm, if you obtain a detailed 20 history from the individual, or if you 21 interview the family and speak to them. he 22 never did any of that. 23 when they put him on the stand to say 24 that he was not addicted to cigarettes and 25 was not addicted to marlboros, he never even 1 went through the criteria with you. they 2 talked about one or two of them and stopped 3 dead. 4 i went through all seven criteria that 5 they used for addiction to marlboro cigarettes, 6 and mr. hatziyannakis met every single one of 7 those criteria. 8 they never told you, for instance, when 9 he tried to suggest that chris was not addicted 10 to cigarettes, or to marlboros, they never 11 discussed with you the following: the most 12 common signs of nicotine dependence are tobacco 13 odor, cough, stains on the finger -- fingers, 14 all of which he had, and you know, from the 15 evidence, is undisputed. 16 this fellow was addicted to both 17 cigarettes and marlboros, and i'm asking that 18 you do your duty and go through the remainder 19 of the jury verdict form and get to the other 20 issues. 21 let us put up a couple of exhibits for 22 just a couple of minutes, please. put up, if 23 you would, cl22, please. 24 now, mr. reilly started talking to you 25 fairly early in his closing remarks about the 1 issues in the case according to philip morris. 2 control: philip morris controlled and 3 manipulated the levels of nicotine in marlboro 4 cigarettes to make them particularly addictive 5 for this man. 6 we know that he struggled for many years 7 to try and quit, he was ashamed of his smoking, 8 it caused tremendous upset in his family; and 9 because of the way in which these cigarettes, 10 with the level of nicotine in them, affected 11 his brain and his willpower, he was unable to 12 control his smoking and able to quit. 13 philip morris controlled and manipulated 14 the levels of nicotine in marlboro cigarettes. 15 on causation, philip morris admits, in this 16 case, that their marlboro cigarettes were a 17 cause of chris' death. 18 so, on the first couple of questions, was 19 he addicted, that is crystal clear. you guys 20 know he was addicted. 21 and then in an attempt to divert your 22 attention, perhaps, from the next easy issue, 23 was he addicted to marlboros, and did that 24 addiction cause his death, as dr. burns told 25 you, he tries to suggest that it is complicated 1 or difficult to understand. 2 they stipulated in the case, admitted -- 3 please put up cl35. 4 they have admitted in number 4 that 5 marlboro cigarettes manufactured by their 6 company, sold in the u.s. to chris, were a 7 contributing cause of chris' lung cancer. 8 so, you have the addiction, you have the 9 medical cause, and you have the legal cause. 10 there is no debate about it, there is no 11 question; and if you permit dr. dosovitz to 12 come in and suggest to you that he was not 13 addicted, it will be a terrible miscarriage of 14 justice. 15 the overwhelming evidence that you know 16 in your hearts to be true, is that he was 17 addicted to cigarettes, and to their cigarettes 18 in particular. 19 dr. burns -- cl8 -- is there any question 20 in your mind that chris was addicted to philip 21 morris cigarettes that led directly to his 22 death in 1994? none whatsoever. that is the 23 legal cause. 24 take a look at cl11, please. mr. reilly 25 put a lot of testimony, a lot of exhibits up to 1 recount what dr. burns had to say. he put up 2 very little about what his expert said, but he 3 consistently wanted to draw your attention to 4 dr. burns. 5 and this is important, because whether he 6 knew it or not, during his questioning of 7 dr. burns, he conceded, through the questions 8 and answers, the following: 9 question: if mr. hatziyannakis began 10 smoking in greece as a young adult, the 11 decision to begin smoking would have been 12 mr. hatziyannakis'; correct? answer: i'm not 13 sure why it would make a difference where he 14 started. 15 and it does not in this case. we are not 16 in this courtroom holding anyone responsible 17 for this man's death but the company that 18 marketed these cigarettes to him for going on 19 20 years, that he smoked two to three packs of 20 a day for the last several years of his life. 21 they have a legal responsibility to this 22 family that they have shirked for the last 16 23 years, and it is your -- most respectfully, your 24 duty to hold them responsible to some extent 25 today in this courtroom. 1 please put up cl39. now, we learned in 2 the videotape deposition of one of their 3 employees, the chemist that worked for many, 4 many years with philip morris, that ultimately 5 was fired by philip morris when he spoke out, 6 we learned the following: philip morris has a 7 motto -- and we see the twin horses there, 8 opposing one another -- and it is veni, vidi, 9 vici. philip morris' motto is, i came, i saw, 10 i conquered. 11 now, it is probable that that motto has to 12 do with its battle with other tobacco companies 13 that it was in competition with, but it is also 14 true of what these folks are trying to 15 accomplish in this courtroom in this case. 16 they expect you, essentially, to ignore 17 the last 20 years of this man's life, and all 18 of the misconduct and outrageous behavior of 19 their executives going back to the 1950's. 20 and i suggest to you that if you permit 21 them to do that in this case, then there will 22 not be justice for this family. there will not 23 be a fair verdict reached if you let them leave 24 this courtroom without accepting any 25 responsibility whatever. 1 this gentleman had a chance today to 2 accept some responsibility for this man's 3 death, and he accepted none. he refuses to, 4 and continues to stiff arm the family on any 5 liability by philip morris. 6 the reason that this company is 7 responsible to this family -- put up cl24, 8 please -- because they marketed and sold for, 9 essentially, the entire time this man lived in 10 this country as an american citizen, their 11 cigarettes, knowing that they would hook him, 12 knowing that he may well get sick, and knowing 13 that he would die. that is why they are 14 responsible. 15 take a look, please, at cl36-1. on 16 christmas day, this photograph was taken -- and 17 the actual photographs are in evidence, and you 18 can take a look for yourself -- the effects of 19 this cancer that ravaged this man's body, that 20 they admit they caused, they admitted that, not 21 voluntarily, but -- 22 mr. reilly: objection, your honor. 23 that is not correct. 24 the court: sustained. 25 mr. johnstone: they admitted eventually 1 in this case that the cigarettes they sold this 2 man caused his lung cancer and caused his 3 death; and if you go through the records, 4 you will see, among many other medical terms and 5 descriptions of what happened to this man, 6 you will see that he experienced what is called 7 temporal wasting, which means his head and the 8 temple areas of his head actually began to cave 9 in. 10 the cancer that they caused to some 11 extent in this man's lungs ate his brain from 12 the inside out, and he had seizures, and he 13 died on dilantin, in seizures, unable to 14 breathe, because of the cigarettes they sold 15 him for the better part of 15 years. 16 now, you have the opportunity when you go 17 to your jury verdict form and read the law, you 18 have the opportunity to hold both of the 19 parties in this case responsible. 20 you determine to what extent this 21 particular company is responsible after they have 22 admitted that they caused his death, and you 23 hold chris responsible to the degree that you 24 believe he was. 25 and if you do that, and if you speak to 1 one another and look at the evidence, you will 2 have done your duty, and we respect that and we 3 thank you for that. take care.
