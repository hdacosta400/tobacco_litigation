3 mr. kaiser: may it please the court, 4 counsel, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, good 5 morning. 6 jurors: good morning. 7 mr. kaiser: what i'm going to do is to 8 track the verdict form that you will have, 9 you will be able to read it and you are going to 10 consider it when you go in and deliberate in 11 this case. 12 and i'd like to start off with the first 13 question you are going to be asked, and it goes 14 to class membership. so we are going to talk 15 about addiction, and we are going to talk about 16 the medical issues. 17 and your first question on the verdict 18 form is going to be: "is david ellsworth a 19 member of the engle class? that is, was mr. 20 ellsworth addicted to smoking cigarettes 21 containing nicotine; and, if so, was such 22 addiction a legal cause of his lung cancer?" 23 so in order to begin our discussions on 24 engle class, let us talk about addiction. and 25 you will recall the evidence, because the 1 evidence showed the following: 2 you will recall that david ellsworth 3 started smoking at a young age. there are 4 medical records that you have that show he 5 started perhaps as young as 14. there is been 6 other testimony as well that, suffice it to 7 say, david ellsworth was a child, was a kid, 8 when he started smoking back in the '40s or the 9 '50s. we know that. 10 david ellsworth started smoking as a young 11 kid at a time when his brain was not yet fully 12 developed. we know that. 13 we know that when david ellsworth started 14 smoking as a kid and whose brain was not 15 developed, he became more susceptible to 16 becoming addicted quicker and having a stronger 17 addiction that, according to dr. o'brien, would 18 be harder to treat. we know that. 19 we know that throughout david ellsworth's 20 life, he smoked from morning, noon till night. 21 we know that he smoked a lot of cigarettes. we 22 know that he smoked at least two packs of 23 cigarettes a day, maybe more. we know that he 24 smoked two packs of cigarettes, maybe more, 25 every day of his life without a day off. 1 i ask you, do you know is it feasible that 2 anybody can engage in an activity or use a 3 substance with such frequency as david 4 ellsworth was able to do smoking a cigarette 5 every single day of his life without taking a 6 day off that is not addicted? 7 and it is humanly impossible because no one 8 on the face of the earth was able to engage in 9 an activity with such frequency, and no one is 10 able to use a substance with such frequency. 11 no one can eat that much food, no one can 12 drink that much drink. it is just humanly 13 impossible. and if someone uses something 14 frequently, they do not have to do it every day 15 of their life if they are not addicted. the 16 bottom line here is: do you really think that 17 david ellsworth smoked every single day of his 18 life without taking a day off just because he 19 liked it? 20 that is silly. he smoked every single day 21 of his life without a day off because he was 22 addicted, because it affected his brain to such 23 an extent that he could not stop. 24 and just think of this. if you have any 25 lingering doubt about whether or not this was 1 just for enjoyment or not, maybe for another 2 reason. 3 do you think when david ellsworth had 4 pains in his ribs, and he was coughing up blood 5 for three weeks before he went to a doctor to 6 get diagnosed with lung cancer, do you think if 7 he was not addicted that maybe he would not be 8 smoking a cigarette knowing full well this is 9 probably a lung problem, i'm coughing up blood 10 and i've got really serious rib pain, and the 11 man is smoking. that is addiction beyond 12 doubt. 13 now, remember dr. o'brien. dr. o'brien 14 testified. he testified about changes to the 15 brain. he testified about memory. he 16 testified about learning, that each puff of a 17 cigarette is a learned behavior. it is a 18 memory. it is not like doing some activity that 19 you will adapt to. 20 and that is why he explained, you can look 21 at a sunset, and that releases dopamine, and 22 that activates the pleasure zone in your brain; 23 but you adapt to it so that after a thousand 24 times the sunset is not a real big deal. 25 with cigarettes, dr. o'brien told you, 1 with each puff it is the same reinforcing 2 effect, it is the same learned behavior, it is 3 the same memory; and when you have millions and 4 millions of those memories stored in the brain, 5 you do not adapt, you become addicted, and that 6 changes your brain permanently. 7 now let us take a look at what he said, 8 briefly, and we will move on to medicine. 9 dr. o'brien said, you know, addiction is 10 very often a lifelong problem. of course it is 11 because it changes your brain for years, and 12 that explains why, after quitting smoking for 13 20 years, 25 years, one day the person 14 relapses, starts smoking, does not know why. 15 the drug activates this reward system and 16 it tends to produce learning. just like he 17 said, with any of the cues that are also 18 present that a person learns to associate with 19 the effect of the drug. that is dr. o'brien 20 talking about that whole reward system and the 21 cues. 22 remember what else he said? sometimes 23 these cues are involuntary, you do not even see 24 it and yet you are smoking a cigarette. and 25 when he is trying to counsel people to stop, he 1 tells them that, and they cannot believe it. 2 that is an involuntary response, that is a 3 diminished control in your ability to control 4 your smoking. it is a loss of control. if you 5 do not see a cue and you automatically smoke 6 because of that, that is not something you are 7 doing on your own volition. 8 well, based on what i know, it is believed 9 that younger people, when they start smoking, 10 become hooked, become -- develop the disorder 11 much more rapidly than older people. 12 we know in this case, david ellsworth 13 started as a young person. does one's 14 addiction cause a diminished or loss of 15 control? yes, that is pretty much part of 16 addiction. 17 well, what it has to do with, the fact 18 that you have this reflex activation of the 19 reward system, which produces craving, and some 20 of it is at the unconscious level. so you are 21 not consciously deciding to do something. like 22 dr. o'brien said, it is an involuntary response 23 to a condition. 24 addiction is a disease that impairs free 25 will. it is not that they want to do it. it 1 often seems that they are pushed to do things 2 that are against their own -- their own 3 benefits, their own life circumstances. 4 and finally, when dr. o'brien testified, 5 "i've never seen anybody who had this much 6 evidence and was not addicted." 7 and remember in response to one of the 8 questions by you as the jurors: "do you think 9 david ellsworth could have quit?" and what was 10 his response? "i do not think so." he may have 11 had such a smoking history, smoked so long, 12 that dr. o'brien thought he probably could not 13 have quit smoking. 14 there is no question, based on the evidence 15 you have heard in this case, ladies and 16 gentlemen, that david ellsworth was addicted to 17 the nicotine in his cigarettes. that he smoked 18 day in and day out almost every day of his 19 life, without a day off, never got bored, never 20 enjoyed it, he was addicted. 21 let us talk about the medical evidence in 22 this case. 23 the dispute is whether or not david 24 ellsworth had this bac you heard about or the 25 adenocarcinoma along with the squamous 1 carcinoma. that is the issue. not whether he 2 had squamous carcinoma, that is undisputed. 3 that is undisputed. he had squamous cell lung 4 cancer. 5 it is also undisputed that smoking caused 6 that. there was not one question asked of 7 dr. okun during his direct examination about 8 other risk factors other than smoking, and he 9 agreed, that is about an 85 percent chance with 10 smoking. so that is not an issue. 11 let us talk about the issues. 12 remember, this is the initial pathology 13 report from september of 1993 before he had the 14 operation and they took the lobe out. this is 15 just the needle biopsy. this is very important 16 because look at what it is showing. remember 17 dr. cerfolio. the needle biopsy is showing 18 poorly differentiated carcinoma, not oat-cell 19 type. 20 remember dr. cerfolio was saying that the 21 pathologist is telling you what he sees, and 22 he is saying that it is not oat cell. that is 23 that small cell lung cancer that is extremely 24 deadly, with prominent fibroblastic reaction. 25 so we know in september this is a poorly 1 differentiated lung cancer, a carcinoma. 2 now, by definition, like dr. cerfolio 3 said, cannot be a bac, because a bac is a 4 well-differentiated tumor carcinoma. cannot be. 5 now, this is the proof in the pudding. 6 this is the saline washings, the left lung 7 needle biopsy, and what does it tell you? 8 it says, these features are suggestive of 9 adenocarcinoma differentiation, and most 10 importantly, malignant cells present consistent 11 with origin, not evolving, but origin from 12 poorly differentiated carcinoma, not oat-cell 13 type. 14 there is not one word, ladies and 15 gentlemen, that this cancer evolved from 16 anything. the only word you see and that what 17 the pathologist read was that this was 18 consistent with an origin from poorly 19 differentiated carcinoma. and even dr. okun 20 said: bac is a well-differentiated carcinoma. 21 even before the pathology from the 22 lobectomy, it is demonstrated here that this 23 was not a bac, this was an adenocarcinoma and a 24 poorly differentiated one at that. 25 and like dr. cerfolio said, everything is 1 against the bac. bac is not a poorly 2 differentiated cancer, so there is nothing there 3 for bac. 4 these features are suggestive of 5 adenocarcinoma differentiation. 6 just really based on this, it is clear, 7 there is no bac. the bac is nothing but a red 8 herring in this case. 9 now we come to the pathology report. 10 remember the october 1993 pathology report we 11 spent a lot of time on? and we see that 12 there is no issue. there were two separate 13 tumors. we know that. there is an issue -- 14 there is an issue with the location of the 15 types of tumors. 16 remember dr. cerfolio, when he had the 17 diagram, he drew this one large circle, and 18 inside the circle was another circle. there 19 was the large mass, which was the squamous 20 cell, and this adenocarcinoma right on it. 21 dr. okun drew two circles, one bigger, one 22 smaller, one next to each other, totally 23 different location than dr. cerfolio. they 24 differed greatly in their interpretation of 25 where the cancer was and how it was. 1 but at any rate, we know they were two 2 separate ones, regardless of where they were 3 located. we know that this pleural-based 4 poorly differentiated carcinoma was a squamous 5 cell. we know it was an invasive carcinoma. 6 we know that it invaded the wall of a large 7 blood vessel, we know that it invaded ribs, we 8 know that it invaded the chest wall. there is 9 no issue that david ellsworth had an aggressive 10 squamous cell carcinoma that occurred. 11 we also know there was a second lesion, 12 again, this non-oat cell discrete from the 13 first. and it does say: predominantly a 14 bronchioloalveolar, but has focal large cell 15 differentiation as well. 16 remember when i was talking to dr. okun 17 and he had talked about this evolving and the 18 bac evolves into the aggressive tumor. and he 19 distinguished the different kinds of non-small 20 lung cancer. remember there is a squamous cell 21 that is totally distinct, there is an 22 adenocarcinoma that is totally distinct, and 23 there is a large cell carcinoma that is totally 24 distinct. 25 and remember dr. okun said, "well, a bac 1 can evolve into an adenocarcinoma." he said 2 that. 3 he said, "a bac cannot evolve into a 4 squamous cell because they are different." 5 and he said, "most importantly, a bac 6 cannot evolve into a large cell." 7 and remember the pathology report? we have 8 got large cell differentiation that belies any 9 contention that this bac somehow evolved into 10 an adenocarcinoma when, before it even goes to 11 the lymph node, there is large cell 12 differentiation. there is no bac. 13 and then when we get to the lymph node, 14 the lymph node seems to be associated with this 15 second lesion, which is the large cell 16 differentiation, but this time what the 17 pathologist sees is adenocarcinoma 18 differentiation. 19 and remember what dr. cerfolio said. lung 20 tumor, unique to most tumors, lung cancer 21 unique to most cancers, are heterogeneous. 22 most tumors everywhere else in the body you 23 have one type. lung cancer you can have many 24 different types in one cell. you can have an 25 adenocarcinoma, you can have a squamous cell 1 carcinoma, although they are distinct, it is 2 called an adenosquamous. you can have an 3 adenocarcinoma and you can have a large cell 4 carcinoma. they are heterogeneous. and that is 5 what dr. cerfolio said, and that is often seen, 6 and it is a big problem in lung cancer because 7 these are invasive cancers. 8 and so dr. cerfolio was saying, people who 9 smoke have a more poorly differentiated cancer, 10 you commonly see an aggressive tumor, bigger 11 than three or four centimeters, commonly poor, 12 dedifferentiated, and very aggressive. that is 13 the squamous cell. 14 ninety percent of squamous cell carcinomas are 15 from people who smoke. so it is by far the 16 number one. he differs with dr. okun by five 17 percentage points. dr. okun said it was 18 85 percent; dr. cerfolio said it was 19 ninety percent. 20 and then dr. cerfolio is telling you 21 there is a second lesion discrete from the 22 first, and he explained why this is not a bac. 23 you might see some bac in a heterogenous tumor, 24 you might see some bac along with adeno and 25 large cell, but that does not mean it evolved 1 from anything. 2 and remember i asked dr. cerfolio: "where 3 does it start? how can you tell us where it 4 starts?" 5 and he said: "no one knows, only the good 6 lord knows," is what he said. 7 and that is the pathology. 8 and, finally, we have the report of the 9 radiation oncologist. and the radiation 10 oncologist, what he was doing was he was 11 cutting and pasting from the pathology report, 12 but then when he did not cut and paste, he 13 referred to that second lesion that we just saw 14 that it was a poorly differentiated carcinoma, 15 non-oat cell type similar to the 16 adenocarcinomatous differentiated lesion. 17 so when he was not cutting and pasting, he 18 said the same thing, this was an 19 adenocarcinoma, not a bac. 20 so certainly more likely than not, this 21 was not a bac. there is no doubt this was not a 22 bac. 23 anyone who thinks that maybe he had this 24 bac just lingering and nobody knew because 25 they are so slow growing. remember dr. cerfolio 1 said: these are indolent, slow-growing, 2 nonaggressive tumors, that when he sees them, 3 and he is seen a lot, he does not do anything, he 4 watches them. 5 and like he said in this case, if david 6 ellsworth, that is all he had was a bac, he would be 7 sitting here today, because he would have lived 8 a long time, because these are nonaggressive 9 tumors. 10 so if you think there might have been this 11 bac lingering for many years, look at this. 12 david ellsworth was getting tested. so we know 13 in 1993 they tested his left lung. they found 14 no fungus, everything was negative for tb. 15 do not you think at that time they might 16 have seen another growth if there was a bac? 17 they did not see anything. everything was 18 negative. so there is no lingering bac that 19 nobody knew about that was just lying there. 20 and, finally, just some of the things that 21 dr. cerfolio said. of course you are to 22 consider all of the testimony, but this is just 23 some of them. 24 and what did dr. cerfolio say? "bac, 25 usually in middle-aged women who do not smoke." 1 and his testimony was in all of the patients he 2 has, he has never had a man with a bac. 3 and dr. okun, in response to one of your 4 questions, said, "bacs are commonly found more 5 in women than in men." 6 without treatment of a bac, how long can a 7 person live? they can go forever. 8 when you are treating someone with cancer, 9 is it the case where a person's lung cancer is 10 always either a squamous cell, an adeno, or 11 some other type exclusively? and his answer 12 was: no, that is what makes lung cancer -- and 13 it should be "unusual" -- if you really look 14 under the microscope, it is almost always 15 heterogeneous. it is got all of these things 16 there. 17 what is your opinion with regard to both 18 of these cancers and their contribution to the 19 death, in this case, of mr. ellsworth? i think 20 both the squamous cell that was growing through 21 the ribs and was very aggressive and growing 22 through arteries, and the adenocarcinoma that 23 metastasized to the lymph nodes, both of those 24 together took his life. that is dr. cerfolio's 25 opinion. 1 you have no question about addiction in 2 this case. there is no question about the 3 medical causation this not being a bac. 4 how, then, is addiction a legal cause of 5 the disease? and remember what dr. o'brien 6 said. when you are addicted, it causes you to 7 smoke more cigarettes; when you smoke more 8 cigarettes, you get more toxins; when you get 9 more toxins, you have more of a risk for 10 developing an illness. and in this case, 11 that is exactly what happened to david 12 ellsworth. 13 he was addicted to the nicotine in the 14 cigarettes. it compelled him to smoke more 15 than he would, he developed, he got more toxins 16 from inhalation of these toxins, which 17 ultimately caused his lung cancer, resulted in 18 his lung cancer, and he died. that is class 19 membership. 20 so in answer to question number 1 on the 21 verdict form: "was mr. ellsworth addicted to 22 smoking cigarettes containing nicotine; and, if 23 so, was such addiction a legal cause of his 24 lung cancer?" the answer is beyond doubt, not 25 just more likely than not, it is beyond doubt 1 here, yes. 2 "was david ellsworth's death legally 3 caused by lung cancer that was caused by 4 smoking cigarettes manufactured by r.j. 5 reynolds tobacco company?" well, the evidence 6 in this case was that the only cigarettes david 7 ellsworth smoked were manufactured by r.j. 8 reynolds tobacco company, or subsidiaries that 9 became r.j. reynolds tobacco company. 10 lucky strikes we have evidence he smoked, 11 viceroys we have evidence he smoked, winstons 12 we have evidence he smoked. nothing more, all 13 rjr products. the cigarettes, if they killed 14 him, were cigarettes manufactured by r.j. 15 reynolds. the answer to question number 2, 16 obviously that is yes. 17 the next thing that you have to consider 18 then is what we call the reliance element. 19 and what i want to do is once we prove 20 class membership, remember, you are now 21 entitled to consider the engle findings. they 22 are binding on you, we did not need to prove 23 any of these facts independently. 24 and so you know, smoking cigarettes causes 25 lung cancer, does not cause bac, does not cause 1 bac. there was not a bac in this case. that 2 cigarette -- that nicotine in cigarettes is 3 addictive. 4 the fact that the cigarettes manufactured 5 by r.j. reynolds are what killed david 6 ellsworth, we have demonstrated that there has 7 been negligence and the strict liability we 8 have proved. so those two claims, done. you 9 do not need to consider them again. 10 what else do we have to do? for reliance. 11 we know, because of the engle findings, that 12 defendant concealed or omitted material 13 information not otherwise known or available, 14 knowing that the material was false and 15 misleading, or failed to disclose material fact 16 concerning the health effects or addictive 17 nature of smoking cigarettes, or both. and 18 that defendant agreed to conceal, agreed to 19 conceal and omit information regarding the 20 health effects of cigarettes or their addictive 21 nature with the intention that smokers and the 22 public would rely on this information to their 23 detriment. 24 so let us talk about reliance. what we do 25 know from the evidence in this case is that 1 r.j. reynolds had more information about their 2 product than david ellsworth did. r.j. 3 reynolds, for a long time, knew that their 4 product would cause lung cancer, and david 5 ellsworth did not. r.j. reynolds knew for a 6 long time what their product contained, what 7 chemicals, what toxins, what was in their 8 cigarette; and we have no evidence that david 9 ellsworth knew that. and so we know as a 10 given, r.j. reynolds had more information about 11 their cigarettes, and they concealed 12 information about their cigarettes. 13 we know, number two, that david ellsworth 14 was exposed to mass media. we know david 15 ellsworth was exposed to radio, we know david 16 ellsworth was exposed to television when he was 17 a kid, in the '40s and the '50s, and we know 18 david ellsworth would have seen commercials for 19 cigarettes on television. we know he would 20 have heard commercials for cigarettes on radio. 21 we know he did because his brother said he did, 22 because his brother, richard, said they 23 remembered, they would sit together, listen to 24 the radio at the house, they would hear 25 commercials, and, in fact, richard ellsworth 1 remembers the lucky strike commercials and to 2 this day still remembers the jingles. he still 3 remembers the lsmft, "lucky strike means fine 4 tobacco." even today he remembers that jingle. 5 why do you think so? because they probably 6 heard that a lot back in the day. 7 and what did he say? he smoked luckys, 8 his brother, david, smoked lucky strikes. 9 clearly david ellsworth got the message. he 10 heard something. he started smoking lucky 11 strikes. 12 we also know that david ellsworth smoked 13 viceroys. we know viceroys, at one time, was a 14 popular cigarette. 15 we know david ellsworth smoked winstons. 16 we know at one time winston was the leading 17 selling cigarette. david ellsworth got the 18 message somewhere. we know he was exposed to 19 mass media. 20 and you also heard, you listened to his 21 deposition, and you saw robert heimann, this 22 representative, this president from american 23 tobacco company, which is now rjr. and what 24 did robert heimann say? 25 robert heimann said: "we spend all this 1 money, millions of dollars on advertising our 2 products because we want people to buy them." 3 that is what he said. 4 and he also said: "we spent all this 5 money, we want people to buy cigarettes, we 6 want them to smoke a lot of cigarettes, and we 7 want them to rely on our advertisements. we 8 want them to rely on our advertisements." 9 and that is what david ellsworth did. he 10 did everything r.j. reynolds asked him to do. 11 he saw these ads on television. he saw these 12 ads that were pitched by famous actors and 13 actresses. he saw these ads that were pitched 14 by athletes that people looked up to. 15 he was exposed to all of this information, 16 and he did everything that r.j. reynolds wanted 17 him to do. he started smoking young, he smoked 18 a lot, and he smoked for a long time. and you 19 know what they want? you know what r.j. 20 reynolds wants right now? they want to be able 21 to come up here and say: ladies and gentlemen, 22 david ellsworth did everything we wanted him to 23 do, but he should have known we were lying. he 24 trusted us. it is too late for that. 25 it is too late, at this juncture, to say 1 that to you. because at the time they were 2 feeding him this information, they wanted him 3 to trust in what they were saying. 4 only now they want you to believe that 5 david ellsworth should have known better as a 6 kid and not believe what he saw because they 7 were -- because the tobacco companies were 8 lying to him. 9 and so even when david ellsworth, at some 10 point had to find out that cigarettes were 11 dangerous, well, herein lies the problem. 12 david ellsworth was addicted, david ellsworth's 13 brain had changed, david ellsworth could not 14 stop smoking, david ellsworth was compelled to 15 smoke. 16 and we know since 1980, that the tobacco 17 industry, including r.j. reynolds, knew that 18 the entire matter of addiction is the most 19 potent weapon a prosecuting attorney could have 20 in a lung cancer cigarette case. why? because 21 they knew it then and they know it now, we 22 cannot defend continued smoking as free choice 23 if the person was addicted. pretty powerful in 24 1980. 25 so not only did david ellsworth rely on 1 what you saw, not only did he get the message, 2 but by the time he might have found out the 3 truth, he was addicted, and you cannot defend 4 free choice when a person is addicted. he was 5 addicted and could not trust them. 6 so the question you have to ask is: what 7 happens if the tables were turned? what 8 happens if this climate of normalcy did not 9 exist back then? what happens if cigarettes 10 were not normal behavior when david ellsworth 11 was a kid? what happens if the cigarette 12 companies, like r.j. reynolds, had provided 13 what they knew about their products back then 14 when david ellsworth was a kid? what happens 15 if they were honest with the public when david 16 ellsworth was a kid? what happens if there 17 were restrictions on smoking when david 18 ellsworth was a kid, because it was known at 19 that time that smoking was dangerous? what 20 happens if parents were more vigilant because 21 they knew about the dangers because rjr was 22 honest back then? what would happen if 23 teachers were more vigilant because they knew 24 about the dangers of smoking because rjr was 25 honest back then? 1 the question is: if all of these things 2 were going on back then, would this kid have 3 started smoking, and with his intelligence? 4 you know the answer is no. everyone says he is 5 smart. he did not have that back then. he 6 did not have that back then because rjr was not 7 being honest with him. 8 that is what reliance is. that is all you 9 have to do is reliance. if the tables were 10 turned and this information was out there, 11 would the man -- would the kid have smoked? 12 and it is the same exact thing with the 13 conspiracy. so the first question is -- that 14 just goes to the reliability of r.j. 15 reynolds -- did david ellsworth reasonably 16 rely, to his detriment, on any statement made 17 by r.j. reynolds tobacco company, which 18 concealed or omitted material facts not 19 otherwise know or available to him concerning 20 the health effects or addictive nature of 21 smoking cigarettes; and, if so, was such 22 reliance a legal cause of his death? 23 and we know in the '50s and '40s when 24 david ellsworth was a kid, and if he was 25 exposed to these tv ads and if he was exposed 1 to these ads that were on the radio, with these 2 beautiful, famous people pitching r.j. reynolds 3 products, beautiful women and athletes pitching 4 these products that are somehow safe and good 5 and beneficial, and all the time making these 6 representations about their product, you never 7 heard them during that time say: by the way, 8 these are going to kill you. by the way, 9 you are going to get addicted and not stop. 10 that is the information they were not 11 telling him back then. so that he did rely to 12 his detriment because he became addicted and he 13 died. 14 it is the same exact information with the 15 conspiracy, except the difference is, it is not 16 just r.j. reynolds, it is r.j. reynolds and all 17 the other tobacco companies that joined 18 together on december 14th, 1953, at the plaza 19 hotel, and they decided: we are not going to 20 tell the truth to the public, we are going to 21 create doubt for the next 50 years so that all 22 these consumers, like david ellsworth, will 23 continue to smoke our products. and it is the 24 same reliance, it is the same argument, and it is 25 the same but-for. 1 if only on december 14th, 1953, the 2 cigarette companies had decided, it might hurt 3 our business, but we have to be truthful with 4 our consumers and our shareholders, it might 5 hurt our bottom dollar, it might hurt our 6 profit, but it might save lives, maybe we just 7 would not be here today. that is what reliance 8 is. so on that question on the conspiracy, 9 yes. individually? yes. 10 next we talk about comparative fault. who 11 is to blame in this case? does david ellsworth 12 have fault? does r.j. reynolds have fault? 13 that is what we have to decide. 14 and we are going to start with december 14 15 of 1953, because that is when the tobacco 16 companies, including r.j. reynolds, got 17 together and they made a decision what they 18 were going to do in response to all of this 19 negative information about cigarettes, about 20 this health scare, as they call it. 21 you heard dr. proctor talk about this, 22 this was the frank statement to smokers, 23 january of 1954 -- can everyone see that? 24 and this was what they shared with the 25 public in every major newspaper in the country, 1 and they made promises to the public what they 2 were going to do in response to this health 3 scare that were alarming people, because at 4 this time, cigarette sales were dropping. 5 people, all of a sudden, were not buying 6 cigarettes with the same frequency they were 7 before this health scare, because there was 8 information out in the public about the dangers 9 of cigarettes. 10 and, perhaps, if the cigarette companies, 11 including r.j. reynolds, had acted differently, 12 enough people would have known early on instead 13 of the '70s and '80s and '90s when it was too 14 late. 15 and so what were some of the promises that 16 r.j. reynolds made with the other tobacco 17 companies? 18 well, one was that we accept an interest 19 in people's health as a basic responsibility 20 paramount to every other consideration in our 21 business. that was a big promise they made to 22 a lot of people. that due to this health 23 scare, we are very interested in your health, 24 and we are going to do everything we can to make 25 sure we get to the bottom of this problem. 1 that was a promise they made publicly. 2 now, at that time, we did not have the 3 benefit of their internal confidential 4 documents, no one did except for them. those 5 confidential documents were secret and no one 6 knew then, no one knew in the '60s, no one knew 7 in the '70s, no one knew in the '80s, no one 8 knew until the '90s what exactly they did, what 9 exactly the tobacco companies knew. 10 so let us just see how this they accepted 11 an interest in people's health from 1953 on. 12 in 1953, december, there was a forwarding 13 memo that resulted from this meeting, and what 14 do we know from that forwarding memo? that the 15 tobacco companies, including r.j. reynolds, 16 knew that their products were dangerous, and 17 they knew that they were addictive, because the 18 research directors made comments that were 19 recorded. and what were these comments? 20 fortunate for us -- not sadly, fortunate -- 21 fortunate for us, cigarettes are a habit they 22 cannot break. 23 they accepted an interest in people's 24 health. they know that their products are 25 addictive, that cigarettes are a habit they 1 cannot break. boy, would not it be wonderful if 2 our company was the first to produce a 3 cancer-free cigarette? not only in '53 did 4 they know that their product caused cancer, 5 that it was addictive, but they were happy 6 about it. and how were they going to show an 7 interest in people's health when they knew this 8 information? by not telling anybody, by 9 keeping it to themselves. that was in 1953. 10 we move on to 1964 when the surgeon 11 general's report came out, when the surgeon 12 general's report was going to come out and the 13 tobacco companies had wind of it, what did 14 philip morris do? all their concern was for 15 the public's health was: we have got to give 16 smokers a psychological crutch to continue 17 smoking cigarettes. that was the interest they 18 had in people's health. 19 in 1972, claude teague, the roper 20 proposal -- this was a tobacco institute memo, 21 not claude teague -- this is almost 20 years 22 after they began this campaign of doubt, 23 promising they accepted an interest in people's 24 health. 25 what did they say? their strategy was 1 brilliantly conceived and executed, and what 2 did it consist of? creating doubt about the 3 health charge. that was the interest that they 4 promised that they were going to take in 5 people's health. 6 but there is more. we move on. they 7 promised: we accept an interest in people's 8 health. and yet they knew, in 1972, that their 9 product was just a dosage of nicotine. they 10 were in the business of selling nicotine. and 11 they accepted that and they knew that. and 12 their accepting an interest in people's health 13 consisted in the fact that they not only knew 14 that their product was addictive, they not only 15 knew it but rjr was happy, they were downright 16 happy that their product was habituating and 17 unique. and they were happy because they were 18 going to get a lot of smokers who were not 19 going to be able to quit smoking their product 20 and would be smoking their product for a long 21 time; and when they die, they would be replaced 22 by younger smokers. that is the interest they 23 showed in the public. 24 so they knew in 1972, 20 years after this 25 conspiracy on which they entered that their 1 product was addictive, they accepted an 2 interest in people's health, according to their 3 credo, and they did not tell a soul. 4 they accepted an interest in people's 5 health, and in 1982, they realized many but not 6 most of those who would like to stop smoking 7 are unable to do so. most people they knew 8 could not stop smoking, could not stop smoking. 9 and they also said, if people started to 10 be able to quit, they would go out of business, 11 because people smoke cigarettes for nicotine. 12 and they were worried because they were all of 13 a sudden getting wind that there was 14 development of these new techniques to help 15 people stop smoking their products. 16 and what did they say? if somehow this 17 happens, what can happen? we might go out of 18 business, because people smoke for nicotine, 19 despite what the defense expert on addiction 20 said. and what else? they would have to find 21 a way to eliminate the desire for smokers to 22 stop smoking. they want smokers to keep 23 smoking their product. they accepted an 24 interest in people's health in 1953, and this 25 is what they were saying in 1982. 1 and robert heimann. you saw robert 2 heimann during his video deposition from 3 december 19th of 1986. and what did he say: 4 congress is wrong in requiring these warnings. 5 is that correct? we do not think they are 6 justified. 7 now this is the president, chief executive 8 of american tobacco company, which became r.j. 9 reynolds tobacco company, and to show they are 10 accepting an interest in people's health, when 11 he is asked about the warnings on the 12 cigarettes, he says they are not justified. 13 that is how much they had an interest in 14 people's health. 15 secondly, the promise that they made, are 16 the credo statement that we included in the 17 frank statement was: "we believe the products 18 we make are not injurious to health." 19 they were telling the public, have no 20 fear, we do not think our products are 21 dangerous. you could rely on us. 22 well, was that the truth? we know that is 23 not. 1953, before this meeting at the plaza 24 hotel, claude teague, the research chemist at 25 rjr, did a survey of all this cancer research, 1 and what did he conclude in his paper? studies 2 of clinical data tend to confirm the 3 relationship between heavy and prolonged 4 tobacco smoke and incidence. and they knew it. 5 and yet, what did they say to the public? we 6 believe the products we make are not injurious 7 to health. they lied. 8 here is the forwarding memo again. not 9 only were they aware that this was bad, that it 10 could cause cancer, but they were joking, 11 would not it be -- boy, would not it be wonderful 12 if we made a cancer-free cigarette? of course 13 we are not going to tell the public right now. 14 and they did not. it is fortunate for us, 15 cigarettes are a habit they cannot break. 16 and here's something else in the 17 forwarding memo, knowing full well the dangers 18 of their product, and denying that their 19 products were not -- that do not cause health 20 problems, what they wanted to do, most 21 important, how to free millions of americans 22 from the guilty fear that is going to arise 23 deep in their biological depths regardless of 24 any pooh-poohing logic every time they light a 25 cigarette. 1 so their interest was not on health, their 2 interest was not on safety, their interest was 3 to how to convince the public to do not fear any 4 health consequences from smoking our product. 5 and they also acknowledged, in 1963, 6 internally, secretly, confidentially that they 7 know their product is addictive, and they know 8 they are in the business of selling nicotine, 9 and that is why they made cigarettes, and that is 10 why cigarettes were popular. 11 and that is why we know they were lying to 12 the public when they said we believe the 13 products we make are not injurious to health. 14 and we talk about fault here. you get the 15 impression that this is not david ellsworth's 16 fault. this is not the man's fault. 17 this is r.j. reynold's conduct, and 18 you-all promised me early on in jury selection, 19 you would not only consider the choices that 20 david ellsworth made, you would consider the 21 choices that r.j. reynolds made. these are 22 some of the choices that we are considering 23 right now. 24 another example, 1972. again, without 25 nicotine, no one is going to smoke. no one has 1 ever become a cigarette smoker by smoking 2 cigarettes without nicotine. i mean, why on 3 earth would someone smoke if they did not get 4 the nicotine? they would not get the feel-good 5 effect. they would not get the satisfaction. 6 they would not be addicted. 7 what do they think about their cigarettes? 8 what did r.j. reynolds think of their 9 cigarettes? that it was a supply of nicotine, 10 that it was a dispenser for a dose unit of 11 nicotine. that is all they thought. to the 12 detriment of the public, including david 13 ellsworth when they said: these products 14 are not harmful, they are not harmful, folks, 15 trust us. 16 only now, they want you to think, david, 17 you should not have trusted us, you knew we were 18 lying then. 19 very few consumers -- they knew in 1978 -- 20 very few consumers are aware of the effects of 21 nicotine, its addictive nature that nicotine is 22 a poison, it is a poison and yet their public 23 stance was: they are not injurious to health. 24 and dr. o'brien, even he said, when he got 25 involved in researching nicotine, it was not 1 until late, because no one knew about it. it 2 was in the '70s, the '80s, that is when he got 3 involved. he was involved in heroin and 4 cocaine abuse, but nicotine became an interest 5 of his in the '70s and the '80s, just like the 6 memo said, people are not aware, if they were 7 aware, maybe they would try to quit or maybe 8 they would not start. 9 what else did they promise in the frank 10 statement? we always have and always will 11 cooperate closely with those whose task it is 12 to safeguard the public health. 13 i mean, how else to ensure confidence from 14 the public by promising these things? we are 15 going to cooperate fully with anyone whose task 16 it is to safeguard the public health. that is 17 a promise they made. would not the public feel 18 comfortable with that promise? 19 and so what does the evidence show in this 20 case? 21 number one, it showed in 1964, when they 22 did not cooperate with the surgeon general's 23 report, they ridiculed it. that was in 1964. 24 in 1972, when the surgeon general's report 25 was issued, they ridiculed it. 1 now, publicly they were going to 2 cooperate, and yet they ridiculed it. 3 robert heimann testified: what do you 4 think of the '64 report? you, being his 5 company. 6 i would use the term misguided. 7 and if he was misguided, then i take it 8 that your opinion is that he is wrong? talking 9 about the surgeon general. 10 i was simply trying to be polite about it. 11 all right. but not being polite about it, 12 in your opinion, is he wrong? 13 dead wrong. 14 that is what mr. heimann said, "dead 15 wrong." and yet they promised the public, and 16 david ellsworth, we are going to cooperate 17 closely with those whose task it is to 18 safeguard the public health. 19 what else did they promise in the frank 20 statement? they were going to hire the most 21 reputable scientists, they were going to grant 22 money, they were going to do research, they 23 were going to hire the best and the brightest, 24 and they were going to create this research 25 committee called the tirc, the tobacco industry 1 research committee. and, folks, they were 2 going to get to the bottom of the problem. 3 that is what they told the public in their frank 4 statement. they were going to do research; 5 they have got this committee that they are going 6 to employ with the best scientists. 7 and what did they do? we know what they 8 did. in 1963, brown & williamson, which is rjr 9 now, the tirc cannot, in my opinion, provide 10 the vehicle for such research. it was 11 conceived as a public relations gesture. it 12 has functioned as a public relations operation. 13 the promise they made was: we are going to 14 get to the bottom of this with the best 15 research scientists that we have; and, yet, 16 they were nothing more than a public relations 17 gimmick. 18 1978, 25 years later, what do we learn 19 from the council for tobacco research meeting, 20 which was just the same as the tobacco 21 institute industry research committee? the 22 tirc was set up as an industry shield in 1954. 23 they knew it well back in '63, they knew it 25 24 years later, and yet they assured the public 25 that they were going to hire all of these 1 people to do research, all of these reputable 2 scientists to do research. and like 3 dr. proctor said, they did do research. there 4 was billions of dollars spent on research, 5 except it had nothing to do with smoking and 6 health. 7 and to the extent that some of these 8 research projects did concern smoking and 9 health, dr. proctor referred to that as nothing 10 more than a leakage. and those institutions 11 would not get grants anymore, those institutions 12 would not get grants anymore, those colleges 13 would not get grants anymore. do you remember 14 that? that was the end of them for doing 15 something like leaking information that might 16 be truthful to the public. 17 and, finally, what did they promise? this 18 statement, this frank statement to smokers is 19 being issued because we believe that people are 20 entitled to know where we stand on this matter 21 and what we intend to do about it. they wanted 22 the people to be assured, look, we are not going 23 to lead you astray, we are going to tell you 24 exactly what we believe and where we stand on 25 this matter of your safety and of your health. 1 and what do we know? we know that they 2 knew their product was dangerous, they knew 3 that they were selling nicotine, we know that 4 they were aware that consumers who were using 5 their products were not aware of the effects of 6 nicotine. and we also knew from robert 7 heimann: would you blame a person for smoking 8 two packs a day? would you? 9 no. 10 you would not fault it for smoking one pack 11 or two packs; is that correct? 12 i think so. 13 and that is what they are going to do. they 14 want people to know where they stand. well, we 15 know where the american tobacco company and 16 r.j. reynolds stood. we want people to smoke a 17 lot of cigarettes; we want people to smoke two 18 packs a day; we want people to smoke as much as 19 they want to smoke, because we are not going to 20 tell them the truth. 21 and, finally, 1994, 1994, at a time when 22 david ellsworth is dying of cancer 23 representative waxman is convening hearings, 24 and under oath, each of the major executives of 25 the tobacco companies, including rjr, swore, 1 no, our products do not cause cancer. no, we 2 do not believe our products are addictive. 3 1994 they are still saying this. and it 4 was not until 2000 that they finally admitted 5 the truth. 6 so we talk about fault. we talk about 7 fault. where in here is david ellsworth's 8 fault? where in here did david ellsworth do 9 anything? 10 i've got some examples that i want to 11 share with you that we will talk about. let us 12 talk about fault more, let us ask some 13 questions, because the defendants are going to 14 have a chance to talk to you -- 15 mr. persons: your honor, before he moves 16 into this next argument -- 17 the court: i'm sorry? 18 mr. persons: before opposing counsel 19 moves into this next argument, i would like to 20 make an objection. 21 the court: okay. let us go sidebar. 22 (thereupon, the following proceedings were 23 held at side bar:) 24 the court: i believe this is the chart 25 that we talked about. 1 mr. persons: that is right, the fault 2 chart, and i just wanted to renew that 3 objection and ask for a continuing objection so 4 i do not have to keep doing this. 5 the court: that is great. you can do 6 that. 7 and you started about 10 after 11, i 8 think, so as soon as you are done, i think we 9 should take a lunch break, and -- and you come 10 back and you give yours, and your rebuttal 11 closing. 12 (thereupon, the sidebar was concluded and the 13 following proceedings were held in open court:) 14 mr. kaiser: so the defense is going to 15 have an opportunity to talk to you, and i'm 16 going to pose some questions because you are 17 going to have to listen intently to see how 18 they are going to respond to these questions. 19 and you know what? they will not. they will not. 20 you know why? they do not want to talk about 21 their conduct. they have not in this case once, 22 have they? 23 they have made this case into a david 24 ellsworth case, for one reason, because if they 25 talk about this conduct, it is not going to be 1 good, and they will not do it. they will not do it. 2 mark my word. every one of these questions, 3 wait for their response, wait for their 4 answers, see if you get one. and if you do not 5 get one, you know what that means? that is 6 fault. they cannot talk about it. they cannot 7 talk about their fault. they want to talk 8 about mr. ellsworth. he did not quit. quit is 9 just simple. he just did not throw his 10 cigarette packs away. he did not throw his 11 ashtrays away. he did not want to quit. he 12 enjoyed smoking with coffee, he enjoyed smoking 13 while drinking, he enjoyed smoking while 14 eating, he enjoyed smoking doing every activity 15 he was going to engage in because the man 16 smoked a lot of cigarettes. 17 when r.j. reynolds knew of the dangers of 18 smoking in the '50s, like i've shown you, by 19 1953 they knew. they had a choice and the 20 question is: why did you choose not to tell 21 the public? why? 22 see what they tell you when they get up 23 here and tell you why they did not. and write 24 in your notes when they do not tell you why 25 they are admitting fault. 1 now, when they did not tell david ellsworth 2 or anybody else about the dangers of their 3 products, when they knew it, is david ellsworth 4 at fault? certainly not. it is like the car 5 analogy, that car hypothetical. when the 6 seller sells that defective car, they do not 7 tell you about it, is it the buyer's fault? of 8 course not. 9 but in this case it is different, because 10 at some point, i'm not going to deny it, david 11 ellsworth had to have learned that the product 12 he was smoking was dangerous, but the problem 13 was, it was too late. the man's brain had 14 changed. he had millions of memories in his 15 brain by no fault of his own. we cannot hold 16 him at fault for that. the evidence will not let 17 you. 18 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 19 the court: grounds? 20 mr. persons: objection to that argument. 21 the court: okay. 22 (thereupon, the following proceedings were 23 held at side bar:) 24 mr. persons: here what we have now is 25 he is going beyond the realm of what the court 1 said that it would permit him to do when we 2 raised these arguments this morning. the court 3 said, well, you can use that but you have got to 4 offer some explanation, put it in context; and 5 now he is saying that each of these, if we do not 6 respond to them, then that is an admission of 7 fault. that is out of bounds. that gets into 8 the realm of calling into question the way we 9 are defending our case, and that is 10 impermissible. 11 mr. kaiser: i was commenting on the 12 evidence. they are not going to be able to 13 respond to the evidence. 14 the court: okay, that objection is 15 overruled, but it is noted for the record. 16 thank you. 17 (thereupon, the sidebar was concluded and the 18 following proceedings were held in open court:) 19 mr. kaiser: question number 1. 20 question number 2: when r.j. reynolds 21 knew of the addictive nature of smoking in the 22 1950s, and we know they did, why did not they 23 tell the public? why did they choose not to, 24 and is that david ellsworth's fault, for their 25 negligence? when they knew it and they did not 1 tell him, that is their fault, not ours; and i'm 2 telling you, we will not accept responsibility 3 for it. 4 david ellsworth does not accept 5 responsibility for not having been told in the 6 '50s, when he was a young kid, what r.j. 7 reynolds knew. 8 listen to how they address that question, 9 how they answer it. i bet they will not. 10 why did r.j. reynolds choose not to 11 voluntarily warn the public and david ellsworth 12 about the dangers of smoking with warnings on 13 the packs in the 1950s? you know, those 14 warnings on the packs, that was mandated by 15 congress in 1966, not the cigarette companies. 16 well, in the '50s no one was mandating 17 anything. 18 and you heard mr. kreiner yesterday ask 19 his witness, every time that mr. ellsworth 20 picked up a pack of cigarettes, he would have 21 seen the warnings or read them. how many 22 times? assuming the man is going to look at 23 the warnings when he picks up a pack of 24 cigarettes, who on earth does? well, maybe if 25 the cigarette companies were honest in the 1 '50s, and they voluntarily told people their 2 product was addictive, and put warnings on the 3 packages themselves, david ellsworth would have 4 been in a position of maybe being able to quit 5 then because maybe his brain was not so changed 6 at that time. 7 maybe he would not have started, maybe he 8 was not a regular smoker, maybe he had the 9 ability then, if he knew the truth, to stop 10 with no difficulty, but he did not get that 11 chance because they did not tell him the truth. 12 why did r.j. reynolds choose not to 13 voluntarily warn the public about the addictive 14 nature of nicotine with warnings on their packs 15 in the '50s? same question. they knew it, but 16 the answer is clear, they thought first about 17 profit than safety. that is clear. that is 18 clear as can be. 19 is that david ellsworth's fault that you 20 had a company that was worried more and 21 concerned more about their profit than safety? 22 no. no. 23 why did r.j. reynolds normalize and 24 glamorize its cigarettes in advertising 25 campaigns using famous actors and actresses, 1 athletes during the '30s, '40s and '50s? 2 what do these types of advertising 3 campaigns appeal to? what do they appeal to? 4 when someone looks at an athlete pitching a 5 cigarette product, when someone looks at a 6 beautiful actress pitching a cigarette product, 7 when someone looks at an actor pitching a 8 cigarette product, when someone looks at a 9 politician pitching a cigarette product, do not 10 you think kids might be vulnerable to that type 11 of advertising, kids like david ellsworth whose 12 brain has not been developed yet? 13 and yet, why did they continue to do that, 14 especially in the '50s when they knew their 15 products were bad? why did they continue to 16 pitch their products instead of saying, by the 17 way, these are glamorous but they will kill 18 you, too? 19 and then the onus is on david ellsworth, 20 but it is not now because they did not tell him, 21 and we do not take fault or responsibility for 22 their negligence. 23 why did r.j. reynolds choose not to 24 voluntarily warn the public about the dangers 25 of their cigarettes in the early '60s before 1 congress mandated those warnings? why did not 2 they do it then? 3 by the '60s, rjr will tell you, there was 4 more information out to the general public so 5 that everybody would have known. 6 dr. proctor did not tell you that. 7 remember what dr. proctor said? look, this 8 took a long time before the public actually 9 knew about the risk of smoking and the 10 addictive nature of smoking. even though there 11 was information out there, the tobacco industry 12 responded in kind. they spent billions of 13 dollars to advertise, they had executives 14 talking on news shows, they had all sorts of 15 these publications, and they had newsletters, 16 they were reaching millions and millions of 17 people with their strategic campaign that began 18 in 1953. 19 so this information might have been out 20 there, but certainly it was overburdened by the 21 information that was being put out there by the 22 tobacco companies in their denialist campaign. 23 and that is why you have got people like dr. 24 o'brien saying, people did not know until the 25 '70s and the '80s. 1 and so maybe if r.j. reynolds had chosen 2 when they knew their products were dangerous, 3 and in the '60s when they knew even more about 4 their products, maybe david ellsworth would 5 have been young enough to be able to quit then, 6 but he did not get the chance. 7 the same thing on addiction. why did not 8 they -- why did rjr, when they made their 9 choice, do i tell or do i not tell the public, 10 they chose not to warn the public about their 11 addictive cigarettes. they did not voluntarily 12 put warnings on their packs in the early '60s. 13 they had that choice to make, and they did not 14 make that choice. and perhaps if david 15 ellsworth was given that choice back then, to 16 either smoke then or heed the warning in the 17 '60s, he was able to quit because his brain 18 was not so changed yet. but he did not get that 19 chance; and for that reason, we do not take 20 responsibility for r.j. reynolds' behavior. 21 why did r.j. reynolds choose to conspire 22 with other tobacco companies and create doubt 23 about the health risks of smoking for 50 years, 24 despite knowing its cigarettes were deadly? 25 why did r.j. reynolds join these other people 1 instead of saying: you know what, our 2 responsibility is to tell our shareholders and 3 our consumers about our products. but they 4 chose not to, and they chose not to for 50 5 years; and now they want to come in here and 6 tell you: david ellsworth is to blame because 7 he did not know -- he did not believe we were 8 lying back then, he should have known, he 9 trusted us. it is too late for that. 10 why did r.j. reynolds choose not to reduce 11 nicotine amounts in their cigarettes to levels 12 that would not sustain addiction when it had 13 that capability well before david ellsworth 14 started smoking? why did not they do it? they 15 had a chance to reduce nicotine so that people 16 could smoke as many cigarettes as they wanted 17 and they would not get addicted, so that the 18 blame would be totally on them if they did not 19 quit. because if they were not addicted, if 20 there was not enough nicotine to cause 21 addiction, they could quit at any time they 22 want. 23 and so knowing that formula, for a long 24 time, before david ellsworth even started to 25 smoke, they knew it. that is their fault. 1 that is not ours. 2 and you heard evidence in this case. they 3 actually tried it later on. and it was not 4 commercially feasible, because people did not 5 want to smoke a non-nicotinized cigarette. 6 well, the problem is they waited so long to do 7 that. had they done it in the '40s, had they 8 done it in the '50s when all of these people 9 were starting to smoke, maybe they would not 10 have those numbers of people starting to smoke 11 again. therein lies the problem. and we do not 12 take responsibility for r.j. reynolds' 13 negligence in not reducing nicotine way back 14 when, when cigarettes were first becoming 15 popular. 16 why did r.j. reynolds take this public 17 position about cooperating with public health 18 authorities in 1964 when they knew their 19 products were bad and they did not share all of 20 the information they could about what they knew 21 with the surgeon general? why did not they do 22 that? just think. maybe if they shared all 23 the information they knew in '64, maybe if they 24 shared all the information with public health 25 officials way back when, maybe it would have 1 been a more restrictive environment way back 2 when, so that people could not smoke in 3 restaurants, so that people could not smoke in 4 public buildings, so that people could not smoke 5 on public buses, so that people could not smoke 6 in a movie theater, so that people could not 7 smoke on airplanes. just think, if that had 8 happened back in the '50s or the '60s, there 9 would be a lot of lives that would have been 10 saved. but that did not happen because r.j. 11 reynolds chose, back in the '50s and the '60s, 12 not to cooperate with public health officials. 13 why did r.j. reynolds urge people to 14 switch to filtered cigarettes rather than quit 15 smoking when they knew that filters were not 16 effective, when they knew that in the '50s? 17 and this is another example of how david 18 ellsworth relied on the information that was 19 being put out there. because we know that 20 david ellsworth smoked lucky strike cigarettes 21 that were a nonfiltered cigarette. and at some 22 point when he switched to winstons and 23 viceroys, they were filtered cigarettes. and 24 we know that the cigarette companies, including 25 r.j. reynolds, advertised filtered cigarettes 1 as being safer without really telling people it 2 was safe, because they did not want to admit 3 that they knew their products were dangerous. 4 but they pushed filters. they pushed 5 filters to such an extent that unfiltered 6 cigarettes were not even part of the market 7 anymore. maybe 3 percent of the public were 8 smoking unfiltered cigarettes after a period of 9 time; that is because everybody in their right 10 mind, instead of quitting cigarettes, was 11 buying into this advertising campaign that 12 perhaps you should switch to a filter that 13 takes out all these bad things. 14 and so just think, maybe if they were 15 honest with david ellsworth back then, and 16 instead of pitching filtered cigarettes that 17 they knew did not work, they would say: you would 18 better think about quitting or smoking 19 responsibly because nothing is going to help. 20 so instead of encouraging people to maybe 21 quit, they put filters on there so that these 22 people, rather than quit, would smoke filters, 23 thinking it was taking the bad stuff out, when 24 r.j. reynolds knew it was not. 25 if the tobacco industry, which was partly 1 funded by r.j. reynolds, you have heard, if they 2 maintained that since 1980, it cannot argue 3 free choice when the smoker is addicted, then 4 why does david ellsworth have any fault? 5 remember, what the defendants want to do 6 with this case, is harp on david ellsworth not 7 trying hard enough to quit. they want to 8 concentrate on his quitting behavior. you need 9 to concentrate on his starting behavior, 10 because if david ellsworth had been given 11 truthful information before he ever started 12 smoking, or even when he had started, it was 13 early enough to where he could have quit, we 14 would not be here today. because if he had quit 15 back then, he would not have had enough toxins 16 in his lungs to get lung cancer. but that 17 did not happen. so the defendants want to harp 18 on this quitting, his quitting behavior. it is 19 too late to harp on it because they know they 20 cannot argue free choice when he was addicted. 21 and so the only possibility of david 22 ellsworth's fault in this case, ladies and 23 gentlemen, is: did he try hard enough to quit? 24 and we know from his daughter kerri, he told 25 her, he did try, and he was unsuccessful, and 1 he was trying to suck on lollipops and could not 2 do it. 3 now, if he did not try 10,000 times, does 4 that make it his fault? if this man tried 5 twice and he was not successful, what did dr. 6 o'brien say? he said: that is evidence to 7 someone -- and dr. o'brien, in his mind, he 8 said when someone knows that they have to quit 9 for some reason and they make a concerted 10 effort to try and quit for some reason, and 11 they are unsuccessful in quitting, they are 12 addicted and they could not quit. 13 and like dr. o'brien said, "this man 14 probably could not quit because of his 15 addiction." 16 so what do we do about fault? 17 the clerk: one hour lapsed, counsel. 18 mr. kaiser: i submit to you, ladies and 19 gentlemen, that the fault in this case, the 20 brunt of the fault in this case, the totality 21 of the fault in this case, is on r.j. reynolds, 22 because of his conduct that we have talked. 23 about. if they had been truthful in the 24 '50s, if they had been truthful in the '60s, 25 perhaps david ellsworth's life would have been 1 saved, but it was not. and for that, we do not 2 accept responsibility. and so when you are 3 asked to apportion fault in this case, and 4 you are asked: please state the percentage of 5 any fault that was a legal cause of david 6 ellsworth's death that you charge to david 7 ellsworth? respectfully, based on the evidence 8 in this case, zero. zero. and r.j. reynolds, 9 because of the evidence in this case, 10 one hundred percent. because if they had acted earlier 11 and responsible, we would not be here today. 12 but they did what they wanted to do and 13 david ellsworth bought into everything they 14 wanted to do, and he smoked their cigarettes 15 and he smoked them for a long time, and he 16 smoked them hard, and he got addicted and 17 could not quit. that is why they are responsible 18 and david ellsworth is not. 19 now we get to damages. there are two 20 types of damages in this case. 21 if you find, and we contend that david 22 ellsworth died from adenocarcinoma and squamous 23 carcinoma, and you find that we have met our 24 burden, by the greater weight of the evidence, 25 that kerri ellsworth is entitled to recover for 1 the loss of support and services from her 2 father. 3 you heard the testimony of dr. raffa, and 4 he talked about this amount of support and 5 services. and you heard the testimony of 6 kerri, and you heard the testimony of others, 7 and what did dr. raffa tell you? 8 dr. raffa computed this on a conservative 9 basis, and he came up to this figure of 10 $1,299,461. that is for the loss of support and 11 services. 12 the loss of support is not very much, 13 because he was only able to obtain certain 14 social security information, and david 15 ellsworth did not have that much reportable 16 income. that is why that number is low. 17 the services for the period of the 18 expected lifetime of david ellsworth, if he 19 had not died, amounts to $1,254,376. 20 and remember dr. raffa, the way he did it, 21 he did it in a conservative fashion by getting 22 the market value for the type of care that 23 someone with cerebral palsy would need. that 24 does not mean that you have to accept this 25 figure. you can go higher. and the reason you 1 can is because you can consider the 2 relationship that -- 3 mr. persons: objection, your honor. may 4 we have a sidebar? 5 the court: sure. 6 (thereupon, the following proceedings were 7 held at side bar:) 8 mr. persons: on economic damages, unlike 9 noneconomic damages, you cannot go high up. 10 that is the number he is put out there and that is 11 the number plaintiff is going to have to live 12 with. 13 mr. kaiser: well, dr. raffa testified it 14 was a conservative estimate and because the 15 relationship between kerri and her father is 16 relevant, they might very well say we want to 17 go higher. 18 the court: okay, but i would ask you to 19 clarify that for the jury, it has to be based 20 on the evidence, and if they agree or accept 21 his representation that it is conservative, then 22 that sort of thing, but that is to be based on 23 the evidence. 24 mr. persons: well, based on that, i move 25 for a mistrial. 1 the court: based on what? 2 mr. persons: based on that statement that 3 he made that they must -- they can go higher. 4 i do not know that you can cure that. 5 the court: okay. he can and he will. 6 but thank you. it is overruled. denied. 7 (thereupon, the sidebar was concluded and the 8 following proceedings were held in open court:) 9 mr. kaiser: why do i say he can go 10 higher? because one thing you can do here is 11 you can consider the relationship that kerri 12 had with her father. 13 and remember the testimony of dr. raffa, 14 this was a conservative approach, conservative. 15 and who on earth would have the relationship 16 that kerri had with her father? 17 remember the evidence, the testimony you 18 heard? this was the father who wanted to make 19 sure that his daughter, despite having these 20 infirmities from her cerebral palsy, was 21 treated like a normal kid, like she did not have 22 any disability. he made sure that is the way he 23 treated her. and that is why you heard evidence 24 that he would take her camping and he would 25 take her fishing and he would treat her as any 1 normal part of the family, just like any other 2 normal kid. and he taught her how to bowl. 3 and all of these things for his daughter that 4 he loved, and even kerri said, that was my 5 primary caregiver. that was my father who at a 6 very young age cut the tips out of my shoes 7 because those braces hurt. and that is her 8 first memory of her caregiver, her father, 9 cutting the toes out because it hurt her at two 10 years old, or three years old, when she had to 11 wear those heavy braces that were painful. 12 that is her recollection. 13 and she talked about all of these things 14 that she would do with her father trying to 15 make her normal. and she tried -- she talked 16 about the fact that she was able to confide in 17 him, even more so than she was with her mother. 18 like she said, i could tell him anything. 19 i could talk to him about anything, and she 20 did. 21 and so when you look at this conservative 22 number that dr. raffa testified about, consider 23 also, based on the evidence, the relationship 24 aspect and you might decide that, no, dr. raffa 25 was too conservative, we want to go higher. 1 now, this is on damages for support and 2 services if you find, in this case, that david 3 ellsworth died from adenocarcinoma and squamous 4 cell carcinoma. there is an alternative. 5 if you have any qualms in this case, if 6 you think, you know what, maybe he did have a 7 bac. the inquiry does not end. there is an 8 alternative damages here. 9 if you are confused for a minute, if you 10 are uncertain for a minute about his cause of 11 death. if you think there was a bac, well 12 do not even worry any further than that, because 13 you are entitled then to consider the 14 survivorship claim in this case. 15 and that is, david ellsworth's survivors, 16 david ellsworth's pain and suffering while he 17 was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma and 18 while he suffered with squamous cell carcinoma. 19 and you are entitled to consider that. 20 and you remember the evidence in this 21 case. first of all of, there is no dispute, 22 this is a certainty, david ellsworth had 23 squamous cell carcinoma. 24 it is a certainty that this was an 25 aggressive cancer. this was in his ribs. this 1 was in his chest wall. this is what was 2 causing his pain that prompted him to finally 3 go see a physician, because he was also 4 coughing up blood. and dr. cerfolio said, "the 5 coughing up blood was because this was an 6 aggressive tumor that invaded his artery." 7 now, the pathologist used that word, not 8 me. the pathologist did not use the word enter, 9 the pathologist said, "this cancer invaded a 10 major artery." 11 not like dr. okun said, "well, it did not 12 go around, it grew inside and clotted." no. 13 this was an invasion, like a war, it invaded an 14 artery. 15 dr. okun said, "one of the ways that 16 cancer spreads from one place in the body to 17 another is via vascular invasion, blood vessel 18 invasion"; and that is what this was called -- 19 even dr. okun admitted -- this was called a 20 "vascular invasion." it invaded this major 21 artery. 22 it caused this man to be coughing up 23 blood, it caused this man to have terrible 24 pain, it caused this man to go to a doctor and 25 he was finally diagnosed with cancer. and he 1 was diagnosed with squamous cell cancer and he 2 suffered. and he suffered miserably. only he 3 knows how bad he suffered, but he did. 4 and you heard from family members. you 5 heard this debilitating cancer. you heard from 6 dr. cerfolio what this does to you. it took 7 this strapping, 180-pound man and took him down 8 to nothing, to 140-pounds so that when his son, 9 rickey mayou came to see him, who had not seen 10 him in ten years, he could not believe what his 11 father looked like. he had shrunk into 12 nothing. this is this horrible disease 13 process. this man could not eat, this man 14 could not lay down, this man had to sleep 15 sitting up in a chair. this is how he spent 16 the last 13 months of his life, in constant 17 pain. 18 and you can look at the medical records 19 and see, even the pain pills were not helping 20 this man. he was taking different kinds of 21 pain pills and it did not help. 22 and dr. cerfolio explained to you, when 23 they went in there and they took his ribs out, 24 to try and get this cancer, that is one of the 25 most painful operations that a person could 1 endure. and he explained, they go in there and 2 they take this huge tool and they chop his 3 ribs. and they chop these ribs to take them 4 out and he had to recover from that. and he 5 said that is extremely painful. 6 and his family members said he did not 7 recover from that. and he still had to go 8 through these other tests and having things 9 stuck down his throat and going through 10 radiation, which in and of itself is another 11 problem. 12 so you get it from the evidence, this man 13 suffered quite a bit in 13 months. so the 14 question then becomes: how do you quantify 15 that? how do you put a damage amount on that 16 amount of pain and suffering? 17 and there is a way to do it, and i'm going 18 to suggest a way to do it. i'm going to 19 suggest a way to do this, and i say suggest 20 because you can do a number of things. you can 21 say that is a good suggestion and you might go 22 along with it; you can say, no, we have our own 23 method that we are going to employ; or you might 24 do a hybrid and say you will take part of mine 25 and you can do what you want. 1 and my suggestion is this: 2 we live on units of time. everything we 3 do in our life is based on time. david 4 ellsworth had a certain time that he lived. we 5 sleep certain hours, seven hours, eight hours, 6 we get up and go to work, six, seven, eight 7 hours. everything is done on hours. sporting 8 events are done in minutes and hours. college 9 kids take classes 12 to 15 hours. everything 10 we do, that is why we watch -- wear a watch -- 11 is based on increments of time. 12 and so one of the things that you can do 13 is equate this suffering on a time component. 14 what does that mean? people go to their jobs, 15 they get paid by the hour. nurses, they go and 16 they take care of people, they get whatever 17 salary they make, they do their job for how 18 many hours it is, they go home. 19 professors, they teach kids maybe about 20 medicine, they get paid money for doing it, 21 they might enjoy their work. they do their 22 eight hours, they teach for the nine months 23 that school is in session, and then they go 24 home for three months. 25 expert witnesses, they testify, they do a 1 job, they come into court, they testify, they 2 do the best they can, they go home. they 3 testify, they are paid by the hour. 4 athletes, famous people, they are paid huge 5 sums at an hourly rate. they do whatever they 6 have to do, and they do it well and then they 7 go home. 8 well, it is the same thing here, basically. 9 why do i say that? because the evidence here 10 shows that david ellsworth was given a job. 11 david ellsworth, because of his smoking r.j. 12 reynolds cigarettes, was given a job, and that 13 job was to suffer for 13 months before he died. 14 that was his job. he did not ask for that job, 15 he did not apply for that job, he did not want 16 that job, but that job was given to him. 17 would anybody want a job like that? of 18 course not. no one in their right mind would 19 say: sure, i will suffer for 13 months with 20 terrible squamous cell cancer. but that was 21 his lot in life, for 13 months, that was his 22 job because of the cigarettes that he smoked 23 that were manufactured by r.j. reynolds. 24 the lucky strikes, the winstons, the 25 viceroys, all caused his squamous cell 1 carcinoma, and he got this job. that job is 2 not part-time, it was full-time. that job had 3 no vacations. that job had no early 4 retirement. that retirement came when he died. 5 that job had no vacation, that job was 24 hours 6 in the day, he needs to be -- his pain and 7 suffering, the estate needs to be compensated 8 for that. 9 so how do you do it? you do it the same 10 way you do it for anybody else who has a job in 11 this lifetime; and that is you apply a wage, an 12 hourly wage. and what do you apply? and this 13 is my suggestion. and i'm going to show you, 14 there is low range, a medium range and a high 15 range, and this is what you come out with. 16 for the damages for his pain and suffering 17 and mental anguish. below range, take for 18 example what an expert witness might get 19 paid -- 20 mr. persons: objection, your honor. 21 (thereupon, the following proceedings were 22 held at side bar:) 23 mr. persons: it is improper to do a per 24 diem based on what an expert who has testified 25 in the case charges. i object. 1 the court: where are you going with this, 2 because you did not finish your sentence? 3 mr. kaiser: a per diem argument where i 4 am going to suggest a wage that they could 5 imply and that is damage figures. 6 the court: what is the relationship though 7 to the expert witness? 8 mr. kaiser: no basis other than pick it 9 out, he makes his money, does his job, well, 10 let us take that. 11 the court: you are not going to suggest 12 that he should get paid the same amount as an 13 expert witness? 14 mr. kaiser: you know, i'm objecting to 15 this, i gave counsel my slides at 9 o'clock. 16 he knew it was in there, he flagged me and he 17 waits to sandbag me when i am doing my closing 18 argument, and i object to that. 19 mr. persons: that is false. i did not say 20 anything about it because he did not make any 21 reference to expert witness. i saw raw 22 numbers. i did not have a basis for objection. 23 the court: overruled. thank you. 24 (thereupon, the sidebar was concluded and the 25 following proceedings were held in open court:) 1 mr. kaiser: like i said before, you are 2 free to do anything you want to this model. 3 you can take a different amount, you can take 4 different hours, you can do whatever you want. 5 i am merely suggesting what i think is a good 6 approach based on the evidence in this case. 7 and what it shows you, ladies and 8 gentlemen, is at a rate of $650 an hour, times 9 24 hours, times 395 days, which is 13 months 10 before he died, it amounts to $6,162,000. 11 i say 24 hours because suffering with 12 squamous cell cancer is a 24-hour-a-day job. 13 the median rate, $750 an hour times 24 14 hours in a day, times the number of days before 15 he died, 395 days, is 7,110,000. 16 and finally, at a higher rate, $850 an 17 hour, times 24 hour, times 395 days, equals 18 $8,058,000. 19 so in total you have got your low range of 20 6,162,000, your midrange at 7,110,000, and your 21 high range of $8,058,000, and that is your 22 damages. that is compensatory damages. 23 and, finally, before i sit down, there is 24 one other aspect of damages; and that is, the 25 entitlement to punitive damages. 1 compensatory damages, you are considering 2 the pain and suffering of david ellsworth. 3 support and services, you are considering 4 kerri ellsworth. 5 punitive damages, you are not considering 6 the plaintiff, you are considering solely the 7 acts of the defendant. 8 and you have to determine whether or not 9 our evidence, by clear and convincing evidence, 10 supports our entitlement for punitive damages 11 so they can be punished for their actions and 12 to deter future conduct. 13 and i've got examples of what we have proven 14 by clear and convincing evidence that we are 15 entitled to punitive damages in this case. 16 and we have already been over this, so i 17 will be quick. when r.j. reynolds knew about 18 the health risks of smoking and cigarettes, 19 they chose not to tell the public. when they 20 knew it and they made this choice, that is 21 reprehensible. that was intentional. that 22 was not by accident. they wanted -- r.j. 23 reynolds -- they wanted smokers to become 24 addicted to their cigarettes. you have seen the 25 documents. they did not just acknowledge that 1 their product was addictive, they were happy 2 about it. 3 in that claude teague document, remember, 4 "happily for us, it is addictive." how much 5 care did they have for the public, people like 6 david ellsworth, in a situation like that? is 7 that not a reckless indifference to human life 8 when their attitude is: we are happy that it is 9 going to addict these people, because they will 10 be smoking our cigarettes for a long time and 11 they will be lining our pockets with money. 12 that is why we are entitled to punitive 13 damages. 14 r.j. reynolds, they marketed their 15 cigarettes to people in general, but who 16 else -- who else is going to be influenced by 17 these famous people pitching their ads? young 18 people. young people whose brains have not 19 developed. and they know that, they know that 20 young people are going to be impressionable to 21 famous athletes and actors and actresses and 22 politicians; and that is just what they did. 23 when they engaged in a conspiracy to 24 create doubt instead of being honest with the 25 public and not becoming part of this 1 conspiracy. instead, for 50 years they 2 participated in this denialist campaign instead 3 of telling the truth with the american public 4 and david ellsworth. 5 that is another example, by clear and 6 convincing evidence, why we are entitled to 7 punitive damages. 8 r.j. reynolds lied to the public about the 9 health risks of smoking. in 1994, in the 10 waxman committee, they lied about the health 11 risks of smoking. when they made this promise 12 with the frank statement, they lied to the 13 american public in 1953. that is lying when 14 they knew full well their cigarettes were 15 deadly and they were addictive as well. 16 r.j. reynolds lied to the public about 17 nicotine not being addictive. same time 18 period. up to 1994, they did not admit it until 19 2000. 20 and for that, we should be entitled to 21 punitive damages, because david ellsworth 22 did not have the chance to learn about this 23 stuff from r.j. reynolds, from the people that 24 were selling him the products back in the '50s. 25 millions of people have been harmed from 1 r.j. reynolds' intentional acts. just think, 2 in the '50s, if they had given david ellsworth 3 this information that we have talked about 4 already, what could have happened? but it 5 did not, because of the indifference they have 6 to the american public, because at the expense 7 of health and safety, they were more interested 8 in their bottom dollar. 9 and that is exactly the last reason. r.j. 10 reynolds chose profits over health and safety. 11 and you know that from 1953 forward for the 12 next 50 years where it was more important for 13 them to go on a 50-year public relations 14 campaign instead of a health and safety 15 campaign. 16 and i'm going to wrap it up, ladies and 17 gentlemen, and just ask you one thing: 18 consider the evidence in this case, if you 19 will. please consider the evidence in this 20 case, consider the testimony in this case, and 21 based on that testimony, based on that 22 evidence, we have proven to you by a greater 23 weight of the evidence that r.j. reynolds is 24 responsible for david ellsworth's death. 25 and r.j. reynolds, based on the evidence, 1 needs to compensate the estate and they need to 2 compensate kerri ellsworth. 3 i thank you for your time. mr. kaiser: everyone ready? the panel: yes. mr. kaiser: good afternoon. i will be brief, and i want to just respond to some of the issues that were raised. number one, i want to mention a couple of things about this name you keep hearing, carole mayou. the defense likes to rely on carole mayou. you have read some of her testimony in this trial. and you may recall, carole mayou is the person who recalls listening or hearing cigarette advertisements on tv in the late 4422 '70s, when they had been banned six or seven years before from the airways. this is in her testimony when she was listening and watching a football game, remember, and she swore she saw these tv commercials, but it was about seven years after they were banned from television. so that is the credibility that ms. mayou has on which the defense relies. carole mayou was the only single person whose testimony in this case revealed that david ellsworth smoked doral cigarettes. not one word from anybody else that you heard in this courtroom or through deposition testimony that david ellsworth smoked anything other than lucky strikes, winstons and viceroy, and this woman comes up with doral and did not see him smoke anything else. the doral came up because david ellsworth worked at the doral country club. she was wrong on that. doral country club, remember that, he was a landscaper at doral country club? the next thing you know, carole mayou is saying i remember he smoked doral cigarettes, and i do not remember him smoking anything else. 4423 that is the kind of credibility we are dealing with, with ms. carole mayou. carole mayou is the ex-wife of ricky mayou. carole mayou is the ex-wife who does not remember when she was separated. carole mayou is the ex-wife who does not remember when she was divorced. carole mayou is the person who said she saw david ellsworth sporadically. that is the carole mayou that they want you to rely on. this is the woman who, when we asked her questions, said, i guess i was just assuming that david ellsworth liked smoking, because he never said it to me. that is what carole mayou is all about. let me say a couple of things on concealment. and remember, we do not have to prove this. we do not have to prove number four and five. this is a given. this has been proven. this has to be accepted once we prove class membership, which we have. defendants concealed or omitted material information. they did that. not otherwise known or available. they did that. knowing that the material was false and misleading or failed to disclose a material fact concerning 4424 the health effects or addictive nature of smoking cigarettes or both. now, this does not matter in the 1980s or the 1990s. what is relevant here, folks, is that the concealment took place in the '50s. the concealment took place when r.j. reynolds was advertising their cigarettes in the '50s, knowing full well that their products could kill people, knowing full well that their products were addictive, and when they were advertising on the airways with their beautiful celebrities and their beautiful actors and actresses and their athletes pitching products so that young people could see who they idolize and say, look, this looks good, i'm going to smoke. what was the material omission from those advertisements in the '50s? this stuff can kill you. that is pretty material. now, do you think that david ellsworth knew, in 1953, that cigarettes could kill him? is there any evidence that he knew in 1953 that cigarettes could kill him? absolutely not. that is the concealment. and the question for you, like i mentioned earlier is, if he did 4425 know cigarettes could kill him in 1953, when he was a kid, if he did know that these are addictive and if you start, you might not be able to stop and die, then maybe the shoe would be on the other foot, and maybe he would have quit. that is concealment. and what the defense wants you to see is all this information that was out there, what did i tell you? they would not talk about their conduct. so when rjr does not exist, yes, it looks like there is a lot of information out there, there is a lot of bad information about cigarettes, there is a lot of bad information about addiction. that came from dr. proctor. he told you about it. they did not call a historian. you did not hear anything about their historian. we called ours. and he told you, yeah, there was bad information, but tobacco responded. see, they do not want to talk about their response. they cannot talk about their response. now, what did dr. proctor tell you? well, why on earth would there be news coverage of these important issues in the '60s, in the 4426 '70s, in the '80s? because people did not know. that is why it is called newspapers and not old papers, because if it is covered, people do not know, and they have to learn. otherwise, there would be no use covering information. if it was so well-known, it would not be worthy of press. that is why dr. proctor said, it was not a question that this was common knowledge, because no one knew until late. if all this information was so well-known in the '50s and '60s, how come ricky mayou, in miami, florida, in junior high school, was able to smoke on school grounds? why? do you think people did not care? no, people did not know. if all this information was out there in the '50s and the '60s and the '70s, how come there were not restrictions on where people could smoke until the '80s and the '90s? because people did not know. people were not complaining. people did not know. the government did not act. it was not until the '80s and the '90s, folks, that you could not fly on an airplane and not smoke, where you could not go into a restaurant, 4427 finally, and smoke a cigarette, could not go into an office building and smoke. you could not go on public transportation and smoke, could not come into this courtroom and smoke. it took a long time, because it was not known, and that is the whole idea of concealment. and that is all i've got to say about that. addiction, mr. persons proved our addiction for us, and the way he did that was he read something from one of these leakage documents that dr. proctor talked about, and he read, "heavy cigarette smokers are true addicts." that is what he read from a long time ago. and remember what dr. o'brien said? all you need to know is how much the man smoked and how often he smoked, and that is enough, and he tried and could not quit, he is addicted, he is addicted. so that answers that question. some of the medical issues. why do they quote dr. cerfolio and not their own expert? why do they quote dr. cerfolio and not their own expert? they do not quote dr. cerfolio, they do not 4428 quote his testimony because it is going to be out of context. remember what they are saying? dr. cerfolio would not rule out a, b and c. he would not rule out. when dr. cerfolio was on the stand, remember what his answer was to every question where it was premised with, you cannot rule out, he goes, counsel, anytime it is prefaced with rule out, you are right, i cannot, i cannot rule out anything. so when you ask me those questions, the answer is always no. that is what he said. now, the defense did not quote any testimony from dr. cerfolio on these risk factors because it would be taken out of context, because simply dr. cerfolio said, squamous cell carcinoma is caused by smoking, end of story. and he did talk about these risk factors, but he said, in this case, it did not happen. the best expert in this case, dr. okun, who was called by the defense, he is the one you need to rely on for these risk factors of dust, because dr. -- oh, dr. okun did not say a word. they did not ask him any questions about dust, 4429 remember? they did not ask dr. okun, the defense, one question about dust. they did not ask dr. okun, their expert, one question about tb. why did not they ask him about that? he did not say one word, because that, ladies and gentlemen, is what is called a red herring. that is not an issue. if you want to think that david ellsworth was up to his eyeballs in dust, go right ahead and think that, because it did not have anything to do with his cancer in this case. if it did, dr. okun would have said, sure, that probably played a substantial part in this case. he was not asked, it is not an issue. tb, dr. okun was not asked, it is not an issue. and if it was an issue, what did dr. cerfolio say? it is not additive where one and one is two. when you have got tb and smoking and they are both inflammatory responses, it is one plus one equals eight. that is called synergy. the tobacco and the scarring from the tb act together, so they both can cause cancer and they both are substantial causes of cancer. 4430 but, in this case, what did dr. cerfolio say? smoking; squamous cell, smoking; squamous cell, aggressive; squamous cell, deadly; no bac; adenocarcinoma; no evolving. it is a heterogenous tumor that you are going to see bac, you are going to see adeno, you are going to see squamous. that is just the nature of the beast with lung cancer. so what the defense did not show you was the medical record, the pathology. i did. which talked about this was origin of poorly differentiated cancer, not bac. this was anything but a bac. this was two deadly cancers, an adenocarcinoma and a squamous carcinoma. and on the issue of fault, remember i said they would not respond to my questions? they cannot respond to my questions. although they want to assign one hundred percent fault to david ellsworth, they cannot respond to questions about their conduct. the only answer to that, folks, is because they are at fault one hundred percent. and so i'm going to answer the questions because mr. persons did not have enough time to 4431 do so. and so what is the answer? why, in the '50s, when rjr knew that smoking was bad, that they knew it could kill, they chose not to tell david ellsworth and the public? it is simple. because they were more interested in making money than they were in protecting people. they were more interested in their profits than health and safety. that is the reason. and that is why they cannot come up here and tell you that. because it is their fault, not david ellsworth's. and the same thing for number two. when they knew it was addictive in the '50s, why did not they tell people then? then they could say, you were warned in the '50s. we put warnings on our packs in the '50s. we told you in our advertisements, when we had these beautiful actresses pitching our products, and they said it is going to kill you. we did everything we had to do. but they did not, because they did not want to lose sales. they did not care about health and safety. that is why they did not tell the public. and 4432 that is why they did not want to answer these questions for you today, because what else can they say? why did not they warn? same reason. every one of these, it is the same answer. they were more interested in the bottom dollar. they were more interested in their profits than they were health and safety. that is why, on december 14th of 1953, when r.j. reynolds met with the other tobacco companies, it was a public relations problem to deal with and not a health and safety problem, and that was the issue. and they decided, we are not going to tell the public the truth, because we need to make money. i mean, how often is it that you get these fierce competitors in this type of industry coming together instead of fighting and competing? they joined forces in 1953 to deceive the public for 50 years. and for that, they should be praised because now they are good citizens? hogwash. because they admit their product was dangerous and deadly in 2000, six years after david ellsworth is dead, and now they are good 4433 citizens and should not be published? hogwash. and so when you look at all these questions, you know what the answer is. r.j. reynolds bears fault. r.j. reynolds made a choice. and they did not tell david ellsworth. and for that, they are at fault, and we accept none for that. they want to dwell on the issue of he could have quit at any time because he quit in 1993. why do you think he quit? this man had devastating cancer invading his body. now, do you know how he felt? does anyone know how he felt? does anyone know whether he even had the strength to inhale a cigarette at that time? and these people are telling you he quit because he wanted to because of his cancer, and he was able to quit cold turkey. he was dying, folks. he was dying a miserable, horrible death because of r.j. reynolds. and he quit in '93 and they are telling you he could have quit at any time. how does anyone know that? how does anyone know if he quit sometime in 1993, he could have quit the day before? how could someone tell you if someone quit 4434 in 1993, they could have quit a month before? how could someone tell you if someone quit in '93, they could have quit a year before? no one can tell you that. because he was fortunate enough to be able to quit when he was dying does not mean he could have quit the day before, a month before, a year before, a decade before. and no one could tell you otherwise. so, yeah, he quit. and i'm sure he wanted to quit before that, because the evidence shows he tried. he tried twice at least and could not quit, and we do not know how many more times he might have tried when he did not tell anyone and still could not quit. and so they did not tell david ellsworth this information in the '50s, and if they did, maybe he would not have been in the position he was in 1993, and maybe he would not have started, and maybe if he did, he had not been smoking long enough, so that he could have quit. but by the time this information started coming out in the '70s and '80s and '90s, it was too late, because he was already addicted. 4435 and it was already too tough for him to even stop smoking at that point because of that learned behavior, that reinforcement, those cures, that involuntary reaction to smoking that these defense attorneys are telling you he liked it. so when you consider all of these examples of the defendant's fault, you have got to consider why they did not answer these questions. and you know why, because they would have to admit they are at fault. why did not they choose to just take their nicotine out of those cigarettes in the '50s, in the '40s, in the '30s, so that people could smoke as much as they want, as long as they want, and quit when they want? because they would not be addicted. but they did not do it because they know that people smoked for nicotine, and it is going to affect their bottom dollar. that is why they did not do it. they had the wherewithal -- mr. persons: objection, your honor. may we have a sidebar? the court: sure. (discussion sidebar.) 4436 mr. persons: the basis of the objection, plaintiff's counsel says that r.j. reynolds should have admitted fault. i mean, that is tantamount to saying that r.j. reynolds should admit responsibility. that is inappropriate and, therefore, i move -- i object to it and move for a mistrial. the court: he said they did not answer these questions because they would have to admit they were at fault. so what is your answer to that? mr. kaiser: that is right. i'm not saying they need to admit fault. i'm saying the evidence is, look at all this stuff, and so they cannot respond because they would have to admit they were wrong and at fault. that is the truth. the court: objection is overruled. just be careful with your words. (sidebar concluded.) mr. kaiser: so that is why they do not respond to these questions, because it is simple. because these are tough questions to answer for r.j. reynolds. they cannot answer them truthfully without admitting fault. 4437 remember, this whole idea about filters, that is another example. why mislead people like david ellsworth? when you know your product is bad and you know filters do not help, just because they wanted to line their pockets, now they are saying the filters would take all this bad stuff out. do not quit if you are going in that direction, smoke our filters. and people did and people died. that is not david ellsworth's fault. that is their fault. david ellsworth switched from a non-filtered cigarette to a filtered. if he enjoyed smoking his luckies, what would prompt him to change all of a sudden to a filtered cigarette? what would prompt anyone to change? it was this marketing effort, where they kept inundating the people, the public, david ellsworth with this safety idea of filtered cigarettes, and that is why we have 97 percent of people smoking filters and 3 percent smoking non-filtered after a number of years, because of this advertising campaign to get people not to quit because of this health scare, but to smoke something that is going to prolong life, 4438 to not kill you, to take all this bad stuff out when they knew it was just the same as a non-filtered cigarette. it did not filter anything. like dr. proctor said, you cannot filter smoke. so that is another example, and they cannot answer that. then, finally, the answer is, even when the man knew, and at some time, he had to know, because he tried to quit, he tried to quit and could not. but the problem is, they cannot argue free choice when he was addicted, and they have known that since 1980. so that is the fault. these people are not good citizens. they were not good citizens back then, and it does not matter what they have done since 2000. it does not matter because david ellsworth died in 1994. and the whole issue of punishment is you punish the defendant for their behavior. you punish them for deterring others in the future. they are punished for what they did. and they did a lot in this case. we are entitled to punitive damages in this case based on the clear and convincing evidence. now, i just want to finish up. you have got 4439 dr. cerfolio saying something. dr. cerfolio's opinions, you have heard. you have got dr. okun making his opinion. reasonable minds can differ. what does it mean? maybe it is qualifications. maybe it is the qualifications that cause people to differ in their opinions. what do we have here? cerfolio, he specializes in oncology and lung cancer. remember he said oncology is cancer. he treats cancer. he operates on cancer. he takes care of lung cancer patients. 98 to 99 percent of the patients he treats have non-small cell lung cancer. that is why he was able to talk about that. he is the chief of thoracic surgery at the university of alabama at birmingham. he teaches high school students, medical students, residents, fellows. he is a full professor. he lectures to medical students. he is authored 150, more than that, 200 articles, almost all on lung cancer. remember he was telling you, all of his surgeries. he does studies. he writes about them. bacs, non-small lung cancer, adenocarcinomas, 4440 squamous cell, he writes. he publishes. he is written 40 to 50 book chapters on lung cancer. mostly about non-small lung cancer. he is an editor of two peer-reviewed journals. he lectures at other medical schools around the world on his specialty. remember what else he said he does. he does this robotic surgery. he is pioneered and approached this robotic surgery to where he travels all over the world to teach other surgeons how to do it, and they come to him at the university of alabama at birmingham to watch him operate using this robotic technique. he lectures at grand rounds all across the world to teach other people and to talk about lung cancer. he is performed 16,000 operations. remember he was saying sometimes he does a thousand a year. he is done more than anyone in the world. he is seen 33,000 patients. he is the endowed chair on lung cancer research. research. that is robert cerfolio. that is his credentials. what do we have for david okun? he is 4441 never published a peer-reviewed article on bac or any other lung cancer, and, yet, he is going to come up here and explain to you why this cancer was a bac. he is never served as a peer reviewer for any medical or scientific journals on articles having to do with bac or other lung cancer. he is never lectured at any medical school on lung cancer. he is never lectured to any professional societies on lung cancer. he has not published any articles in 30 years or over 30 years. he is never been a principal investigator on any clinical studies involving lung cancer. dr. cerfolio said he is a clinical -- he is been a principal investigator on hundreds of studies. he is not been invited by any other med schools around the country to participate in grand rounds involving cases dealing with lung cancer and cancer treatment, and ninety percent of the cases he treats have nothing to do with lung cancer. because 10 to 12 percent, he says, he is treated for lung cancer. that is the extent of 4442 his oncology practice. so when you weigh their credentials, who do you believe? who is the authority to be able to come in here and talk to you about non-small lung cancer and bac? and the evidence overwhelmingly supports it is robert cerfolio. same with dr. o'brien and the defense expert that they called. again, it boils down to credentials. because on the one hand, dr. o'brien comes up with an opinion that mr. ellsworth is addicted. on the other hand, the defense expert comes up with the opposite opinion. and, yet, that man says, well, that is my opinion, and that probably should be the opinion of every clinician, because i'm right. that is what he told you. and so let us look at the credentials and see who is right. and we see dr. o'brien has written 520 peer-reviewed articles, mostly about addiction, 520. that is a lot of writing. he is the editor of journals, including a journal called addiction. he lectures worldwide on addiction. he created a medical school course on addiction that is required of 4443 medical students at penn and elsewhere. he is an endowed chair in psychiatry at the university of pennsylvania. he is got a building named after him. it is the charles o'brien building at the university of pennsylvania, bestowed on him in his honor for his work in addiction. he is been elected to the institute of medicine of national academy of science for his work on addiction. he is served on drug abuse counsel for national institute of drug abuse. 40 years much research he is done, including nicotine addiction. his interest. he is been a principal investigator for hundreds of clinical studies concerning addiction and nicotine addiction, in particular. he is been invited to the white house to consult on substance abuse. he is been knighted by the french government with the chevalier award on his work on addiction. he is treated individual patients on his own since 1971 for things like addiction, including nicotine. he was the chair of the substance abuse 4444 disorder committee for the dsm-5. he is the man that helped write the criteria under which they spoke of yesterday and when he testified. he wrote it. he is written 40 to 50 book chapters on addiction. this is the man who you saw testify. this is dr. charles o'brien. roger samuel, he has never written a peer-reviewed article on nicotine addiction or substance abuse and, in total, has written three articles in his career. he has never been board-certified in addiction psychiatry. he has never been a reviewer on any peer review committee. he has never been an editor for any professional journals. he has never lectured before any professional societies on nicotine addiction. he has never done any research on nicotine addiction. he has never been on any committees for the dsm-5, 4 or 3, like dr. o'brien has. he has never written any criteria for substance abuse or tobacco use disorder. he has never served on any government committees related to substance abuse. 4445 he has never run any clinical studies on addiction. he has never taught a course solely on substance abuse or addiction. he has never written any chapters or textbooks on addiction. he has seen maybe two people in the entirety of his career solely for nicotine addiction. that is dr. samuel's credentials. and you know what else you know about dr. samuel, is that dr. samuel is paid as an expert witness, and dr. samuel, in his entire career, in deposition and trial testimony, has found a total of zero people addicted. that is the expert that they called. he never finds anyone addicted. finally, when you consider the testimony, consider how he answered questions. this is a man who conducts this workshop on cross examination. but let us see what he is learned. he answers the questions on direct examination with yes or a no and when he is asked to, he will explain. does that well. on cross examination, did he ever answer one question directly? and you know the answer to that. he wanted to just turn away and 4446 lecture you. not answering the question directly, but saying whatever he wanted to say, regardless of what the question was, so that almost every response, i had to say, okay, now, my question, i guess the answer is what, yes, no. every time. that is what he is learned in his workshop and cross examination. do not ever answer a question on cross directly. do not even answer the question. you say what you want to say to the jury to get your point across. what kind of points did he want to get across? this man had the audacity, the audacity, the unmitigated gall to sit there and tell you, their own expert agreed with me, and said the man was not addicted, he agreed with me. now, if that were true, if that was not a bald-faced lie, do not you think, when dr. o'brien was on that stand, mr. kreiner, who is the best attorney in this courtroom, would have said, now, dr. o'brien, do you recall when i took your deposition? well, let us read your deposition, because today you are saying that david ellsworth is addicted, but, in july, you 4447 said he was not; is that correct? well, it did not happen, because that was not the testimony. and, yet, their own expert is telling you that under oath. that is the kind of expert they called for addiction. and, finally, lastly, on the issue of fault. since 1963, the defendants have known this is an issue of fault. since 1963. why? that memo i keep referring to as the battelle hippo that i showed you today? what does it say? "it is difficult to assess the effect of the report on causes of action arising prior to its issuance. "logically, it would be argued the report does no more than to collate preexisting knowledge, knowledge as available to the buyer as the seller. but logic might, in the minds of a jury, yield to the emotional reaction that if this knowledge was available to the seller, it was up to him, having the means to do so, to make the product safe. "a jury might, whether instructed or not, operate on the theory of comparative negligence. true, the buyer was negligent in 4448 smoking a product he knew was dangerous, but he was lulled by the seller, and the seller's negligence was the greater in failing to make this product safe." that is exactly what the evidence has shown in this case. the seller, r.j. reynolds, knew in the '50s their product was not safe, and they did not tell david ellsworth. and in 1963, they knew, we are more at fault than david ellsworth. based on the evidence in this case, they are one hundred percent at fault, david ellsworth has none. now, with respect to damages, mr. persons talked briefly about damages and said you should not award any. well, he has not come up with a suggestion of his own for how you should. so you can take my suggestion, as i said, leave it as it is with our number, or you can take whatever number you would like. i ask that you consider the evidence, the testimony, find rjr responsible, award compensatory damages to kerri ellsworth for her loss of support and services for her father. and alternatively, for some reason, for some 4449 happenstance, you find that we have not proven that was not a bac -- that this was a bac, if you find it was, and we have not met our burden, then you look at the survivorship claim, the pain and suffering of david ellsworth. and, lastly, we ask that you find that we are entitled to punitive damages based on the evidence we have shown. thank you again.
