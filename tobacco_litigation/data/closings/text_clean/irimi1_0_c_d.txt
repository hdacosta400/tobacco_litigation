18 mr. boyce: thank you, your honor. 19 good morning. 20 jurors: good morning. 21 mr. boyce: may it please the court. 22 counsel. 23 ladies and gentlemen, i want to start by 24 thanking you for your time and your patience 25 and, most importantly, your attention in this united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 case. you have been a remarkably professional 2 and attentive jury, and that is one thing 3 everybody here agrees on. 4 so before i get started with my review of 5 the evidence, i want to make sure that you 6 understand on behalf of myself, miss amadi, and 7 mr. harrison, we appreciate your willingness to 8 serve in this case. 9 what i want to do today is go through the 10 evidence. and as you may recall in opening 11 statements, i used this board that i entitled 12 four key issues. 13 sorry, can you see it down there? 14 the court: do you want the easel, 15 counsel? 16 mr. boyce: no, i'll be okay. i want to 17 use it for a second. 18 i want to use this as a roadmap to help 19 us go through the evidence, try to point out 20 the evidence that i think will help you decide 21 the questions that you have to decide now that 22 we have a verdict form. 23 but i want to spend a moment at the 24 outset to remind you as we talked about in 25 opening statements, there are really four key united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 issues. 2 the first thing we will talk about is 3 evidence in this case that shows mr. moyer is 4 not a member of the engle class. 5 the second issue is the evidence that 6 proves that mr. moyer at age 83 passed away 7 from skin cancer unrelated to smoking 13 years 8 after he decided to stop smoking. 9 the third main topic is the evidence that 10 prevents plaintiffs from ever being able to 11 close that drawbridge that we talked about; the 12 evidence that prevents plaintiff from being 13 able to connect any of the stuff that 14 mr. schlesinger spent so much time talking 15 about yesterday to mr. moyer in a direct, 16 continuous and substantial way. 17 and lastly, we will talk about the evidence 18 you saw that shows that mr. moyer is 100 19 percent responsible for the consequences of his 20 smoking-related decisions. 21 in my opening statements, i tried to make 22 it clear that this case was about dale moyer 23 and dale moyer alone. 24 it is not about tobacco. it is not about 25 whether cigarettes should be banned. it is not united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 about cigarette advertising. it is not about 2 other smokers and what may or may not have 3 happened to them. 4 it is a case exclusively about mr. moyer, 5 the reasons he smoked, and what happened in his 6 life. 7 and the verdict form, as you will see when 8 we go through it, each and every question on 9 that verdict form is about mr. moyer. 10 there is one question at the end, punitive 11 damages, and that is where mr. schlesinger would 12 have you start. 13 but there is a whole host of questions 14 before then, and each and every one of them 15 relates exclusively to mr. moyer and the 16 decisions he made about smoking throughout his 17 life. 18 what we saw from the evidence time and 19 time again, as we talked about in opening 20 statements, is that mr. moyer was a smart, 21 willing and informed smoker. 22 from the time he very first started 23 smoking at age nine, he knew to hide it from 24 his parents, he knew to hide it from his 25 father's congregation. he knew that it was united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 inappropriate and something that he should not 2 be doing. 3 in the early '50s, when he was in college 4 and in his early 20s, he starts to believe that 5 smoking is linked with a variety of health 6 problems. 7 and as we saw, by 1964, 1965, he believes 8 that smoking causes lung cancer, and that 9 belief never changes once for his entire life. 10 he never even heard of the agencies that 11 mr. schlesinger talked about yesterday. 12 mr. moyer never heard of tirc or ctr or 13 ti, and we have the video clip for you. 14 can you get it for me, cliff? 15 16 17 follows:) 18 q. have you ever heard of an entity called 19 tobacco industry research committee or tirc? 20 a. no. 21 q. have you ever heard of an entity called 22 council for tobacco research or ctr? 23 a. no. 24 q. have you ever heard of an entity called 25 tobacco institute or ti? united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 a. no. 2 (video clip concluded.) 3 mr. boyce: he never even heard of the 4 organizations. mr. moyer's beliefs about 5 smoking never changed based on anything the 6 tobacco companies ever said or did not say. 7 and when we go through the instructions, 8 you will see how time and time again you are told 9 to focus on that connection. 10 did plaintiffs prove a connection between 11 mr. moyer and the conduct? 12 and with all due respect, the 13 instructions are not mumbo jumbo. they are 14 long, and it is a complicated case, but that is 15 the law that you have to follow here. it is the 16 law of the case. 17 they are easy to understand if you take 18 your time and go through them. but they are not 19 mumbo jumbo. they are very important, because 20 they are the law that you have to apply to the 21 facts. 22 secondly, we asked mr. moyer if he had 23 ever even spoke to an employee of a tobacco 24 company. 25 and you can see at the bottom that she united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 said: you have never spoken to any agent or 2 employee of any of the other co-defendants in 3 this case. and he said no. 4 he never spoke to anybody at reynolds, he 5 never heard of ti, he never heard of ctr, he 6 never heard of the tirc. 7 we saw also from the facts that the first 8 time in his life that mr. moyer put in a 9 concerted and continuous and serious effort to 10 stop smoking, he did. and never smoked again. 11 he was in control of his smoking. 12 the first time he went more than a day or 13 so without smoking, he stopped smoking 14 permanently and never started again. 15 and we saw time and time again how 16 mr. moyer was a willing smoker, smoked because 17 he liked it and enjoyed it. smoked because he 18 wanted to. 19 he was the one that led the jokes and 20 wrote the cheers. mr. hammer described him as 21 a ball of fire at the party. that is who he 22 was. 23 he was a man who enjoyed smoking, he was 24 a man who enjoyed having fun, restaurants, 25 vacations every summer, and as mr. hammer put united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 it, he is the ball of fire at the party. 2 but most importantly, he was a ball of 3 fire who passed away at 83 from skin cancer; 4 not from smoking. and when he passed away at 5 83, it was 13 years after he stopped smoking. 6 and he stopped smoking by following through on 7 a program that lasted one week. 8 there was another piece of evidence in 9 here that i think was very important, and it 10 showed just how willing and happy mr. moyer was 11 with his smoking behavior. and that is the 12 story that ms. rodd told us about the visits to 13 the r.j. reynolds tobacco plant sometime in the 14 mid '70s. 15 in the mid 1970s, mr. moyer is in his mid 16 50s, and he decides to take his family on a 17 tour of a tobacco plant. that evidence shows 18 that mr. moyer was not a smoker tortured by an 19 inability to quit smoking. somebody smoking 20 against his will because he could not stop. 21 it shows that it is somebody who is very 22 comfortable with his smoking, very comfortable 23 with the smoking decisions he made. 24 you heard her describe it as important to 25 him. it was a big deal. he wanted to go and united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 look at how cigarettes were made. but it shows 2 his attitude about smoking as of that time. 3 an alcoholic trying to stop would not 4 tour a jack daniels factory. 5 mr. hammer: objection. 6 the court: overruled. this is argument. 7 ladies and gentlemen, this is just 8 counsel's take on the facts in evidence. 9 proceed. 10 mr. boyce: it underscores that for the 11 vast majority of his life, as he put it, when 12 it hit the fan, he was happy smoking, in 13 control of his own behavior and smoking because 14 he wanted to. 15 and those are the two fundamental reasons 16 why mr. moyer is not a member of the engle 17 class. he knew everything he needed to know 18 about smoking from a very early age, he was in 19 control of his smoking and smoking willingly 20 because he wanted to. 21 the only legal cause, a direct and 22 continuous and substantial cause of his 23 smoking, was mr. moyer. that is why he is not an 24 engle class member. 25 there are engle class members. there are united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 people that maybe heard of ti or ctr, or ctr or 2 tirc? 3 mr. hammer: objection. 4 the court: sustained. 5 mr. boyce: people who have difficulty 6 stopping and are tortured over a long period of 7 time by an inability to put it down. that was 8 not mr. moyer. 9 we also saw a variety of evidence that 10 when mr. moyer wanted to control his smoking, 11 he had no problem doing that. 12 we talked about his early jobs at the 13 department stores, the clothing stores. we 14 talked about how in church and when he was at a 15 nonsmoking restaurant or a nonsmoking hotel, he 16 did not smoke cigarettes. 17 he told you, and his brother echoed this, 18 that after he stopped working in the stores, he 19 became a traveling salesman. 20 one of the things he liked about being a 21 traveling salesman was that he set his own 22 schedule, that he was his own boss, and he was 23 in charge of his own day. and larry moyer 24 explained to you that smoking was part of that 25 lifestyle. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 but what appealed to mr. moyer was being 2 in control. he was always in control of every 3 aspect of his life. it was life well led; it 4 was a long life; and it was one that at every 5 turn, mr. moyer did what he wanted to do on his 6 own terms. 7 i want to point out brooks brothers 8 quickly. he started working at brooks brothers 9 in 1986. 10 in 1986, mr. moyer is about 57 years old. 11 56 or 57 years old. 12 plaintiffs would have you believe that 13 he is 30 or 40 years into an addiction that is 14 controlling his own hands in a way he cannot 15 stop. 16 but he decides to go and work at brooks 17 brothers. we know there is no smoking at brooks 18 brothers. there is no stepping outside every 19 ten minutes to have a cigarette. he takes a 20 job where he knows he is not going to be able to 21 smoke for big portions of the day, and he does 22 it in the mid '80s. 23 we have heard time and time again in this 24 case if you can go a day, you can go a week. 25 if you can go a week, you can go a lifetime united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 without quitting -- without smoking. 2 on the other side of the coin, we saw 3 time and time again that mr. moyer enjoyed 4 smoking. picture after picture shows him 5 living a happy and full life of which smoking 6 was a part, not a life that was controlled by 7 and led by an addiction to cigarettes. 8 here he is at the beach, with his golfing 9 friends, winning a box of balls with a friend, 10 singing at the piano table, singing with 11 ms. hedberg, in the barbershop quartet. 12 and importantly, it was not just 13 cigarettes. you heard from his brother that he 14 smoked a pipe in the late '50s and '60s. 15 you heard from ms. hedberg he smoked a 16 pipe in the '80s. 17 it is not just cigarettes. there are a 18 variety of smoking that appealed to mr. moyer. 19 but it was not just cigarettes. 20 you have heard the concept of legal cause 21 needs to be direct, continuous and substantial. 22 but another way to look at that is if you take 23 it out, if you take the cause away, would it 24 have made anything different? 25 and when you think about whether united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 addiction is the legal cause of mr. moyer's 2 smoking, remember the pipe smoking, remember 3 that he smoked other forms of tobacco, and that 4 it was not just cigarettes. 5 and remember the pictures that show him 6 time and time again enjoying himself in a 7 variety of settings, of which smoking was a 8 part. 9 contrast that with the very limited 10 evidence that you saw that mr. moyer ever 11 missed out on any activities or spent time 12 alone because of his smoking. smoking did not 13 control mr. moyer. 14 now, addiction does not change it. talk 15 about how mr. moyer is in control of his own 16 behavior, but addiction does not change it. 17 plaintiffs want you to believe that addiction 18 takes away choice, that it takes away control. 19 but every single doctor in this case said 20 the opposite. dr. seidman, dr. mascarenhas, 21 dr. proctor, dr. wolek, dr. civantos and 22 dr. policzer. all agreed that every smoker can 23 quit. they all have the ability to stop if 24 they are properly motivated. 25 dr. wolek, i thought, put it pretty good. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 the idea that mr. moyer was too addicted to 2 stop is right here from dr. wolek. 3 he says: certainly mr. moyer would be a 4 good example of that. he, at the end of his 5 addiction, was at three and a half packs a day, 6 according to his testimony, you know, up to 7 four packs a day and he was able to quit. so 8 there is proof right there. 9 that is plaintiff's expert witness, 10 dr. wolek, telling you that mr. moyer himself 11 is proof that every smoker can quit when 12 they are properly motivated. 13 you saw this from the surgeon general. 14 studies suggesting that everyone can quit 15 smoking. and smokers quit by the millions over 16 the years, between 1955 and 1965, almost 18 17 million people quit smoking. they are smoking 18 the same cigarettes as mr. moyer. smoking 19 cigarettes in the same amount of mr. moyer. 20 thirty million people quit between 1964 21 and 1979, and by 2014, there is 60 million 22 former smokers in this country. that is the 23 largest change in any one health behavior in 24 this country's history. period. 25 there are not 60 million people who united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 did not jog and now jog. there are not 60 2 million people who have lost weight or stopped 3 drinking or stopped drinking coffee or anything 4 else. 5 this is by far the largest change in any 6 one health behavior in the history of this 7 nation. 8 there is nothing about the cigarette that 9 stops this. those people smoked the same 10 cigarettes as mr. moyer. mr. moyer himself 11 quit smoking the same cigarettes he smoked from 12 sometime in the late 1970s. 13 a couple points about the cigarette, and 14 i'll get back to mr. moyer. 15 you heard that nicotine occurs naturally 16 in the tobacco plant. dr. proctor explained 17 that the defendants do not add extra nicotine 18 to tobacco. they process it, but they do not 19 add extra nicotine to tobacco. 20 dr. seidman told you pretty clearly 21 there is nothing magic about a cigarette; it has 22 no power other than what the smoker gives to 23 it. but there is nothing magic in it. 24 dr. seidman explained that after two or 25 three days, all the nicotine is out of your united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 body after you stop, and in two or three days, 2 all the nicotine is gone. 3 in a couple weeks, the brain begins to 4 rewire itself. the brain rewires itself within 5 a couple of weeks. 6 the idea that there is a permanent change 7 is just not supported by the evidence. 8 but most importantly for mr. moyer, none 9 of this mattered on day 8 in 2000. he used 10 zyban for seven days. there is no nicotine in 11 zyban. zyban is an antidepressant. it is 12 called wellbutrin. and wellbutrin was around 13 for a long time. but it is not nicotine 14 replacement therapy. 15 that means the first day he went without 16 smoking, there is no nicotine in his body. he 17 uses the zyban for seven days. on the eighth 18 day, none of this is in any way powerful enough 19 to make mr. moyer pick up a cigarette or make 20 mr. moyer want to smoke or make mr. moyer go 21 back to smoking, and he stays that way for the 22 last 13 years of his life. 23 there is no such thing as a subset of 24 hyper addicted smokers. and we talked about 25 this with dr. proctor. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 the national cancer institute wrote 2 monograph 15. this document is in evidence. 3 you can review it yourselves. 4 we have a quote from page 24. as you 5 recall, i talked about it with dr. proctor, and 6 what they looked at was people that were still 7 smoking, and they tried to figure out are these 8 people still smoking more addicted than the 9 60 million that have put it down. and they 10 found no. 11 they said there is little evidence to 12 suggest there is an increasing level of 13 addiction in the residual smoking population as 14 measured either by the number of cigarettes you 15 smoke each day, or how quickly you smoke when 16 you wake up. no evidence. 17 when i asked dr. proctor about it, he 18 said: that is what the national cancer institute 19 set out to study. they were looking at whether 20 there was a group of super addicted residual 21 smokers who will never give it up, and they 22 said they did not find any support for that 23 hypothesis. 24 but dr. proctor went on. i asked him: 25 you do not dispute that the fundamental united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 conclusion of monograph 15 is that there is no 2 support for this hardening hypothesis? 3 and he said: oh, for sure. that is a 4 mythology. there is no body of smokers who 5 absolutely cannot quit. that is why the level 6 is continuing to fall right through that 7 mythical layer. 8 and the level he is talking about is the 9 number of people who smoke in this country. 10 they set out to see if there was some way to 11 explain why people kept smoking. 12 and he said: look, the level of people 13 who quit continues to fall right through it. 14 it is a myth, from plaintiff's own expert. it is 15 a myth to suggest that there is a group of 16 smokers who are so addicted they cannot stop. 17 and the same thing goes for mr. moyer. 18 dr. wolek told you he is proof of this. the 19 national cancer institute and monograph 15 and 20 dr. wolek are saying the same thing. 21 if you look at what it takes to stop 22 smoking, you see the same thing. dr. seidman 23 described mr. moyer as an emotion-triggered 24 smoker. his advice for those smokers is that 25 wanting a cigarette will not hurt you. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 there is a saying: do not just do 2 something, sit there and let the feeling pass. 3 that is what he is up against if he tries to quit 4 smoking. 5 and that is why motivation is the key. 6 there is nothing in withdrawal that overwhelms a 7 smoker who is serious about stopping. 8 if you could switch me to the elmo, 9 please. 10 technician: sure. 11 mr. boyce: you can see it at the bottom 12 from dr. seidman's chart. without a cigarette, 13 mr. moyer was nervous, irritated, angry, edgy 14 and upset. 15 on day 8 when he stopped in 2000, he is 16 experiencing those feelings. but since when 17 did those feelings become a legitimate reason 18 not to do something that you wanted to do? 19 if being irritated was an excuse for not 20 doing something you were committed to do, would 21 any of us have graduated high school or been 22 able to park in the garage -- 23 mr. hammer: objection. golden rule. 24 the court: objection noted. overruled. 25 mr. boyce: you would not make it to work united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 if being irritated or a little upset was a 2 reason not to follow through. not to put in a 3 little continuous effort to stop smoking, none 4 of us would be here. 5 you can switch me back, please. thank 6 you. 7 dr. seidman also had mr. moyer as the 8 scared to quit smoker. this is the smoker who 9 has no end of reasons and excuses to put off 10 smoking. if you can quit for a day, you can 11 quit every day. but it is the smoker that says, 12 no, not today, i'm too busy, too stressed. 13 they have no end of excuses. 14 that is what plaintiff's own addiction 15 expert classified mr. moyer as. 16 dr. seidman went on to say that even if 17 hardcore smokers, if you just go a day, they 18 are surprised by how easy that first day of 19 nonsmoking really is. 20 now, dr. mascarenhas i thought was a very 21 important witness in this case. he is not just 22 mr. moyer's longest term treating physician. i 23 think he knew him for more than 20 years. he 24 also knew him personally. he knows him 25 personally, he knows him professionally. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 he also is the only doctor in the whole 2 case who ever met mr. moyer when mr. moyer was 3 a smoker. so he knows him personally and 4 professionally, but he is the only person in 5 this case, the only doctor, that knew mr. moyer 6 when he was a smoker. 7 and dr. mascarenhas said quite clearly: 8 quitting smoking is a function of willpower. 9 do you agree that mr. moyer, during any 10 period of smoking, that he could have quit? 11 i believe he could have quit if he had 12 been motivated. 13 he always had that capability to be 14 motivated? 15 correct. and it was not until 2000 that 16 he found the actual motivation and actually 17 quit. that is dr. mascarenhas. 18 that is important, because the only 19 difference between 2000 when mr. moyer quit 20 permanently and all the other times that he 21 thought about quitting or threw cigarettes out 22 the window until he got to the next town, 23 that is not a quit attempt. 24 throwing your cigarettes out the window 25 while you are driving down the road and buying a united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 pack in the next town is not a serious effort 2 to quit. it is a passing thought at best. 3 but dr. mascarenhas says it quite 4 clearly. he always had this ability, always 5 had this power. did not choose to exercise it 6 until 2000. 7 now, in 2000 mr. moyer was properly 8 motivated, and he told you why in his own 9 words. 10 i want to look at four key dates to see 11 why it is the defendants' position that 12 throughout mr. moyer's life until 2000 he is 13 smoking because he wants to, not because of an 14 addiction. 15 the first is 1964, '65. this is when 16 mr. moyer starts to believe that smoking causes 17 lung cancer. that is a belief that never 18 waivers. 19 what else does he need to know? he 20 believes that it causes lung cancer, emphysema, 21 way back in the '60s. the ingredients, stuff 22 that people find on the websites. if you 23 understand that it causes lung cancer, that is 24 all you need to know. 25 there was no evidence of a motivated, united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 serious, continuous effort to stop smoking in 2 1964. 3 in 1979, he turned 50 years old. this is 4 when he gets separated from mrs. moyer, and in 5 1984 he retires. you saw the photo where 6 mrs. moyer kept working until 1996, but 7 mr. moyer actually retired full time in 1984, 8 except for the job at brooks brothers for a 9 period there in 1986. 10 so he turns 50 years old. at a time when 11 millions of americans are making choices about 12 their health. if they are interested in what is 13 going to happen to them at the end of their 14 lives, they are making different choices. 15 and mr. moyer separated from his wife and 16 spent the next 20 years, actually from about 17 1979 to 2003, golfing every day, traveling 18 internationally, traveling around the united 19 states, playing cards with his friends at the 20 club in the afternoon, going out to dinner each 21 night, and having a couple martinis. 22 mrs. hedberg described him as the dean 23 martin type, the drink in one hand and the 24 cigarettes in the other. 25 but for that period of time, 24 or 25 united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 years, he is not trying to stop. he is doing 2 what he wants to do. 3 it is not until he gets motivated that 4 anything changes. nothing changed in the 5 cigarettes, and do not forget there is no 6 nicotine in zyban. zyban is not nicotine 7 replacement. 8 in 1985 is when the warning labels start 9 to say smoking causes cancer. mr. moyer told 10 you he stopped reading it. he believed the 11 warnings, and we will get to that in a minute. 12 but he stopped reading them. 13 more importantly, 1985 is when his uncle 14 tommy passed away from emphysema. larry moyer 15 told you how repeatedly he explained to 16 mr. moyer, this is what is going to happen to 17 you. 18 but you did not see any evidence of a quit 19 attempt, something serious, motivated, 20 continuous, a couple days in a row connected in 21 any way to what happened with uncle tommy or 22 the warning labels in 1985. 23 1984 is when dr. mascarenhas tells him 24 you have got to quit smoking. it is the first 25 time we see copd in a medical record and united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 dr. mascarenhas tells him: you need to stop. 2 dr. civantos explained to you that these 3 dates are important. because '64, '79, '85, if 4 he stopped smoking then, we are not here. 5 but dr. civantos also said if he had 6 stopped in 1994, he had a pretty good chance of 7 avoiding the injury that the daughters are 8 suing for today. 9 but from 1994 to 2000, mr. moyer kept 10 smoking. and there is no evidence that he ever 11 put in a continuous and sustained and serious 12 effort to stop for those six years. 13 we talked about the patch. look at the 14 medical records. in these five boxes that 15 mr. schlesinger was pointing to yesterday, you 16 will not find one record, ever, where the reason 17 for the visit was smoking cessation assistance. 18 his cardiologist tells him to stop 19 smoking in 1994. never asked mascarenhas for 20 help. never asks any doctor for help. not one 21 record where the reason for visit is patient is 22 here to quit smoking. 23 never goes to a cessation clinic. never 24 sees a psychiatrist or psychologist. never 25 asks anyone for help. has friends who are united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 former smokers, does not reach out to them, hey, 2 how did you do it? do you have any tips? hey, 3 doc, i'm struggling with this, can you give me 4 a hand? 5 we have two patch records from 1992. one 6 is from february and it says 30 patches. if 7 mr. moyer was serious, there would be another 8 one from march. 9 the next one is december 31st of 1992. 10 no evidence he ever filled that prescription. 11 in mr. moyer's own words, he used the patch one 12 time. 13 we were talking about the patch you said 14 you took. do you remember what time frame it 15 was? 16 he said: i think i tried it just once. 17 the reference to the patch is two years 18 later. we have february of '92, december of 19 '92. two years later. it says: offer patches 20 asap. 21 no evidence that prescription was ever 22 filled, and certainly no evidence that from '92 23 at any point in time he put in a serious, 24 continuous effort to stop. 25 same thing with the gum. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 how long did you use the gum? 2 he said: it tasted awful. i did not 3 finish what i bought. 4 chews the gum one time. does not finish 5 what he buys. but this period between '94 and 6 2000 is the one that i think underscores it. 7 the only difference between what happened in 8 the past and what happened in 2000 is 9 mr. moyer. 10 because there is no evidence of that 11 continuous, sustained effort for a period of 12 six years after he is told quite clearly from 13 his long-time friend, long-time cardiologist, 14 you have got to put them down. no follow-up for 15 help, no request for assistance. in those six 16 years, all we have are two patch records, a 17 year apart, and then two years later on, the 18 patch. 19 when he finally quits, nobody knows. his 20 daughters told you they did not know that he 21 quit. 22 this is dr. civantos. i read this 23 quickly. he says: i think there was a 24 reasonable chance if he had stopped in '94, we 25 would not be here today. when you stop smoking, united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 your body starts to heal itself immediately. 2 your risk of getting diseases from smoking goes 3 down every day that you go without smoking, so 4 after a long enough period of time you are 5 basically down at the same level of somebody 6 who never smoked. you may not decline as 7 quickly. may take a longer period of time. 8 but if you quit smoking, the benefits start 9 immediately, and they get better every day you 10 go without cigarettes. 11 that is what dr. civantos is saying, and 12 you can see that in the surgeon general report 13 for yourself if you want to review them. 14 we asked his daughters, what did he do to 15 quit in 2000. miss irimi said: i was busy at 16 the time. i had a one-year-old child. 17 miss rodd said: i was not there at that 18 time. 19 and miss mumtaz explained: i do not know 20 how long it took him to quit. i do not know 21 what he used. 22 i asked her: were you surprised when you 23 learned sometime later that he stopped? 24 and she said: i never really had a 25 thought about it. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 the significance of that testimony is 2 that it shows that mr. moyer was not fighting a 3 50-year battle against addiction and losing. 4 think about it the other way. think if 5 you had a family member that was trying to 6 fight an addiction, and they finally beat. 7 that would be the talk of the family. 8 mr. hammer: objection, judge, golden 9 rule. 10 the court: thank you. overruled. 11 mr. boyce: if you had an alcoholic in 12 your family and they drank against their will 13 for 50 years and they put down alcohol, that 14 would be all you would talk about. that would 15 be everything. 16 mr. hammer: judge, again, objection, 17 golden rule violation. 18 the court: thank you. 19 why do not you come sidebar. 20 mr. boyce: i'll move on, your honor. 21 the court: thank you. 22 mr. boyce: thank you, sir. 23 one of the daughters mentioned that she 24 saw him with a patch on one time and never 25 mentioned it to him. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 in the '90s. sees him with a patch. 2 does not even mention it. hey, dad, what are 3 you doing? keep it up. way to go. nothing. 4 no conversations about the health risks 5 of smoking with their father, no conversations 6 about cessation from smoking with their father. 7 the only possible explanation for that is 8 outside this courtroom they accepted that 9 mr. moyer, and mr. moyer alone, was in control 10 of his smoking. 11 we have seen the clip before. this is what 12 mr. moyer said he did. he followed the 13 instructions. he took the pills and quit. 14 took about a week. never smoked after that. 15 and we asked him why. 16 you can fast-forward. i do not want to 17 play the clip. thanks. you can fast-forward 18 to the first medical chart, please. 19 when we asked mr. moyer why he quit in 20 2000 -- you are all familiar with the clip -- he 21 said that it hit the fan for him. that was it. 22 told him he had emphysema. it was 23 different. for the first time in his life, he 24 was motivated to stop. 25 he was on zyban for one week, and after united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 that the only person standing between mr. moyer 2 and resuming smoking was mr. moyer. that is the 3 only thing for 13 years, and he never smoked 4 another cigarette. and you heard him say in 5 this case that he never wanted to. 6 if you can flip to the elmo, please. 7 technician: push the button on the side, 8 the white button. 9 mr. boyce: thanks. 10 that is the evidence that shows that 11 addiction is not a direct and continuous 12 substantial cause of mr. moyer's smoke. he 13 knows what he is doing. he is doing it 14 willingly. he is touring tobacco plants with 15 his family. 16 and no evidence of a continuous, 17 sustained effort to stop until 2000, and that is 18 when he stops. 19 and that is why whatever you want to call 20 his smoking -- mr. hammer is right, you can 21 call it addiction, you can call it habit, you 22 can call it behavior. whatever you want to 23 call mr. moyer's smoking, that is up to you 24 guys. 25 the second part of this question: and if united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 so, was addiction a legal cause of the copd, 2 emphysema and heart disease? right? 3 first part is, was he addicted. that is 4 entirely up to you. whatever definition you 5 want to apply. he might need it, he might not. 6 what is really important for class 7 membership is the second part. was addiction a 8 legal cause? 9 to be a legal cause, it has to be direct, 10 continuous and substantial. and here, because 11 mr. moyer knew what he was doing and smoked 12 willingly and did not put in the continuous 13 effort to stop, the only direct and continuous 14 substantial cause of his smoking is himself. 15 and that is why he is not an engle class member. 16 that is why your answer to this 17 question -- and i know i skipped ahead a little 18 bit -- has to be no. 19 mr. moyer is in control of his smoking, 20 not an addiction. regardless of what you call 21 it, even if you call it addiction, it is not a 22 direct continuous cause of mr. moyer's smoking. 23 there is only one of those in this case, and 24 it is mr. moyer. 25 now i want to switch gears a little bit. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 if you could flip it back over, please. 2 technician: sure. 3 mr. boyce: you got it. 4 technician: the first medical record? 5 mr. boyce: yes. 6 7 8 follows:) 9 voice: what was it that -- 10 (video clip concluded.) 11 mr. boyce: we will start right there. 12 the actual first question -- you can go 13 ahead and put it up. 14 the actual first question on the verdict 15 form, and rather than switching back to the 16 elmo, i'll read it for you. 17 was smoking cigarettes a legal cause of 18 mr. moyer's heart disease. 19 there is two introductory questions on 20 there. one about heart disease and one about 21 when mr. moyer got copd. if you answer those 22 questions no, the case is over. you would come 23 back in, and the case would be over. 24 we talked about the timing of mr. moyer's 25 copd, and you see the evidence on both sides. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 one thing that is important to consider as you 2 look at that question is that mr. moyer never 3 saw a lung doctor until 2003. 4 the first time he goes to see a 5 pulmonologist, the guys that treat lungs, is 6 2003. and that is the first time he had the 7 formal test, the pulmonary function test, that 8 diagnosed his copd and emphysema. 9 i do not want you to think that because 10 they are separate on the verdict form, there is 11 any difference. emphysema is a form of copd. 12 they are listed separately. but emphysema is a 13 form of copd. 14 with respect to the heart disease, with 15 respect to whether it was a legal cause, the 16 answer has to be no. 17 we asked dr. mascarenhas. as part of 18 your care and treatment of mr. moyer, did you 19 determine what caused his coronary artery 20 disease? 21 dr. mascarenhas said: nobody can tell 22 you. all i can tell you is he was a coronary 23 profile. 24 if you look at all of the things in his 25 coronary profile, looking at all of mr. moyer's united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 risk factors, he had multiple risk factors. 2 dr. mascarenhas said he had five out of 3 the seven. smoking is one of them. family 4 history, obesity, high cholesterol, 5 hypertension. he is got five of the seven. 6 alcohol is also a risk factor, and you have 7 seen the alcohol records in this case. 8 but we asked dr. mascarenhas, can you 9 look at those and say that one of these is a 10 legal cause, that one of these is more 11 likely -- 12 mr. schlesinger: excuse me, your honor, 13 i object. that is not what it says. 14 the court: thank you. 15 ladies and gentlemen, you are to rely on 16 your own recollection of the evidence. the 17 testimony of dr. mascarenhas is on the screen 18 as well. 19 proceed. 20 mr. boyce: they asked him, could you 21 look at those risk factors and say that one was 22 more likely a cause than the others? 23 he said: no. 24 asked him again: you said no? 25 and he said: that is correct. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 that is dr. mascarenhas telling you he is 2 got a list of risk factors, and i cannot tell 3 you which one of these risk factors caused the 4 disease. 5 in that situation, that is a gentleman 6 that if you take smoking out of the picture is 7 going to get heart disease anyway. that is 8 but-for causation. 9 if you take smoking out of the picture, 10 because of the other risk factors, he gets 11 heart disease anyway. that should be an easy 12 "no" for you on the verdict form for heart 13 disease. that is mr. moyer's own cardiologist 14 telling you that it is not a legal cause. 15 dr. mascarenhas says that, you know, his 16 heart never even gave him a problem. having it 17 written in the medical records does not mean 18 that it is manifested or that it is causing you 19 problems such that you could recover for it in 20 a court of law. 21 this is his cardiologist saying, 22 fortunately, his heart never gave him a 23 problem. 24 and we heard this from mr. moyer himself: 25 you have had heart problems? united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 not really. 2 when you say not really, it lends me to 3 believe -- well, he had been told he had a 4 heart problem, but it never showed up as being 5 one. 6 that should be an easy no for you on the 7 first question there with respect to heart 8 disease. 9 i want to talk quickly about the lung 10 cancer. mr. moyer was lucky when he went in 11 for his hip. they found the mass in his lung 12 on a chest x-ray. they found it in october of 13 2003. he had surgery november 12, 2003. never 14 had another treatment for lung cancer after 15 november. 16 in fact, in 2008 he tells dr. alvarez 17 that he is not going to follow up any longer. 18 he will not do any diagnostic studies and will 19 accept whatever happens. 20 mr. moyer did have a variety of health 21 problems that were unrelated to smoking, but i 22 want to spend a couple minutes talking about 23 his lung condition. 24 and then we will talk about the next 25 question on the verdict form, which is whether united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 he had parotid cancer, and if so, did the 2 parotid cancer cause his death or was it 3 smoking-related diseases that caused his death. 4 first, i want to talk a little bit about 5 mr. moyer's pulmonary condition. first, let me 6 say he obviously had copd and emphysema. but 7 the one thing i think that is clear from the 8 record in this case is that he did not die from 9 copd or emphysema, and that he did not suffer 10 debilitating symptoms from copd or emphysema 11 every day from sometime in the '90s until 2013. 12 and the evidence there starts with 13 mr. moyer himself. 14 in 2003, he said: 15 16 17 follows:) 18 q. do you think the hip surgery had more of 19 an impact on preventing you from playing golf or the 20 copd? 21 a. oh, the hip surgery. the copd was not 22 really evident yet, as far as slowing me down. i was 23 in great shape up till then, i thought. 24 q. up until 2003? 25 a. yeah. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 (video clip concluded.) 2 mr. boyce: so that is mr. moyer himself 3 saying up until 2003, the copd did not slow him 4 down. 5 i also want to make a point there is no 6 evidence, no testimony in this case that 7 mr. moyer's smoking has anything to do with his 8 hip trouble. 9 you can see in the medical records his 10 hip gives out after a lifetime of golfing. 11 it is not related to smoking, not a 12 smoking-related disease. 13 but it continues. the first time he sees 14 a pulmonologist is in '03. the first time he 15 has a pft is in '03. 16 you have seen this record from february of 17 2003 where he is still golfing without any 18 shortness of breath unless he is on a hilly 19 course. 20 mr. moyer was 74 years old in 2003. he is 21 a 74-year-old man golfing, walking without any 22 shortness of breath unless he is on a hilly 23 course. 24 that is in 2003. it continues. you saw 25 the pictures. that is mr. moyer in 2006 with united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 his daughters and mrs. moyer. he is not wearing 2 oxygen. he is out of the house, part of family 3 events, doing things he wants to do. 4 in 2008, mr. moyer was 79 years old. 5 that is his youngest grandson, who is seven or 6 eight years old -- excuse me, about six years 7 old in this photo. i think he was born in 8 2002. 9 again, mr. moyer, not on oxygen, part of 10 the family, living a life. he is 79 years old 11 at that point. that is eight years after he 12 stopped smoking. and the pictures tell you 13 what you need to know about this. 14 he also had other problems like his 15 weight and his sleep apnea. problems with his 16 spine that further exacerbated the breathing 17 problems that he did have. 18 when he gets to see dr. civantos in 2011, 19 he is not on oxygen, and dr. civantos's first 20 thought is that his lung condition may not be 21 as severe as we were worried. 22 but you think golfing in 2003, no oxygen 23 in '06, no oxygen in '08, does not wear the 24 oxygen at least all the time because he did not 25 take it with him to see dr. civantos. and united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 that is june of 2011. june of 2011, he had just 2 turned 82 years old. 3 the reason he went to see dr. civantos is 4 he had the mass on his neck, and this is what 5 ultimately caused mr. moyer's death. and it is 6 the only cause of mr. moyer's death. 7 mr. moyer had a mass on his neck. he 8 went to see dr. civantos. dr. civantos told 9 you that his first thought was it was squamous 10 cell carcinoma. 11 and here is a brief summary of the 12 history of all the squamous cell carcinomas 13 that mr. moyer had on his skin from 1999 to 14 2012, 13 years. squamous in '99, '01, '05, 15 '07, '09, and '11. and there was a big one in 16 2008 on his left cheek. and it spread. 17 this is what dr. civantos told you. he 18 said that when he came in, he was worried about 19 the fact that what happened in his neck had 20 come from his cheek, and he wanted to get a 21 core biopsy. 22 but first we have a biopsy from what they 23 took out of his cheek in 2008. this is what 24 dr. rosic was talking about. 25 these are the slides from what they took united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 out of mr. moyer's cheek in 2008, and these are 2 the slides that show that they did not get it 3 all. 4 that is a cancer cell. you can see 5 dr. rosic, who is the only pathologist in the 6 whole case -- in fact, the only witness in the 7 entire case that does not agree that the 8 squamous cell carcinoma that he had here, here 9 and here and here over 12 years is not the same 10 cancer that he had behind his ear in 2011 is 11 dr. policzer, a guy who saw him four times in 12 2013, never looked at any pathology, looked at 13 one inch of medical records that he got from 14 mr. gdanski. 15 dr. policzer is the guy who sat in that 16 chair and said: people did not know about 17 sunscreen until the '80s. 18 mr. harrison asked him: where did you get 19 that? 20 he said: i was guessing. 21 just guessing. dr. policzer is the only 22 doctor in this case who does not acknowledge 23 that what happened on his cheek spread to his 24 ear. 25 but that is the cancer cells in the 2008 united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 cancer. that is what dr. rosic explained is the 2 lymphatic system, the way cancer spreads, it 3 gets into your lymph system or your blood 4 vessels. 5 that is a cancer cell in mr. moyer's lymph 6 symptom in 2008. 7 these are cancer cells in mr. moyer's 8 bloodstream in 2008. he was out and about. 9 that is where dr. civantos stands right on 10 this. 11 when dr. civantos sees him in 2011, he 12 said: i was suspicious because of the history 13 of this patient, and i wanted to know myself. 14 so i took a core biopsy. 15 the core biopsy is cutting the skin off 16 first, going in and getting a core. not just a 17 needle. you want to make sure it does not come 18 from the skin. cut the skin off and go get a 19 core. 20 he said: look, i want to make sure i know 21 what i'm dealing with. 22 when the report came back, dr. civantos 23 said it was spread out squamous cell carcinoma. 24 dr. arguelles, mr. moyer's cancer doctor 25 said: this is a periparotid metastatic tumor. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 periparotid means it is around the parotid. 2 when we go back to the elmo, i'll show 3 you what these questions are. 4 periparotid means it is not in the 5 parotid, and it is around it. 6 and finally, dr. arguelles says: judging 7 by the history of the large skin cancer 8 resected from the left cheek, this may well 9 represent a relapse of cancer, of which 10 mr. moyer is aware. 11 he told him this on the ground. 12 only policzer came in and second-guessed 13 any of this. there is policzer, the primary 14 parotid tumor. the only guy in the whole case 15 that had that opinion. 16 dr. civantos puts it another way. 17 mr. moyer has squamous cell carcinoma. 18 correct? 19 started on his skin, correct, and 20 metastasized to his parotid? 21 correct. 22 that is dr. civantos. 23 there is a question on the verdict form 24 that says -- maybe if you could switch me to 25 the elmo. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 these are the questions on the verdict 2 form that relate to the parotid cancer. 3 the first is: did mr. moyer have a 4 primary parotid cancer? if you think that 5 dr. civantos and dr. arguelles and dr. rosic 6 are right and what happened was that the cancer 7 on his cheek spread and got into the area of 8 his parotid gland, your answer on this one has 9 to be no. 10 but what is important, if you answer no 11 for number 4, you skip number 5. 12 as you can see from the directions -- or 13 certainly you will be able to see from the 14 directions a little bit better in the jury 15 room, if your answer is no for mr. moyer on 16 primary parotid, then the cancer on his ear, 17 the cancer in his neck, the cancer that caused 18 his death is not related to smoking. 19 the only theory -- everybody acknowledges 20 smoking does not cause skin cancer. 21 the only theory linking smoking with the 22 cancer is dr. policzer saying, well, it started 23 in the parotid gland. 24 if it came from the skin, this one has 25 to be no. but when you answer it no, which is united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 in, i think, all honesty, the only fair 2 interpretation of the evidence in this case, 3 that means it is not a smoking-related disease 4 and you skip question number 5. 5 now, you can switch me back, please. 6 there is a couple reasons that we know 7 it is not primary parotid cancer. the first is 8 dr. rosic took a look at his parotid. that is 9 his parotid gland right there. those are 10 actually normal gland cells. there is no 11 cancer in the parotid gland. 12 dr. policzer, who never looked at the 13 pathology, did not know that. there is no cancer 14 in the parotid gland. 15 that is why arguelles is right. there is 16 no cancer in the parotid. it is behind his ear 17 and around the neck. 18 finally, dr. rosic explained to you the 19 neck mass. those are the things called horn 20 pearls that are characteristics of skin cancer 21 spreading. we have cancer getting in the 22 bloodstream in 2008. we have the same cancer, 23 the same cell type coming back in 2011. 24 and when they look in his parotid to see 25 if there is anything, policzer says there is no united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 cancer. 2 there is also no evidence that smoking 3 causes parotid cancer. you can look through 4 these books, the surgeon general reports, not 5 in there. not an engle disease, but that is a 6 different matter. 7 the real reasons are, civantos told you 8 this is a metastatic skin cancer. had nothing 9 to do with smoking, and these pathology slides 10 prove it. 11 that means that the only way that 12 plaintiffs can link smoking to mr. moyer's 13 death is to say, well, he could have had 14 surgery if he did not have copd. 15 we talked about his pulmonary condition, 16 we talked how dr. civantos when he first saw 17 him thought he could have the surgery. we know 18 the surgery did not go forward. 19 one of the problems here is they cannot 20 connect copd to mr. moyer's death in a direct 21 and continuous and substantial way because 22 there is no guarantee with the surgery. 23 dr. policzer even said it: we do not know 24 what would have happened if he had undergone 25 the surgery. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 i want you to remember this was not 2 surgery or radiation. dr. civantos's original 3 plan was surgery followed by radiation. but 4 this surgery was far from a magic bullet. far 5 from a cure. 6 he told you it was six to eight hours. 7 he had to flip the ear up and work around the 8 bony structure. the nerve was going to be 9 sacrificed. the paralysis was never going 10 away. 11 all of these problems were not related to 12 smoking. that is what happened. skin cancer is 13 a nasty disease. cancer is tough on any 14 patient, regardless of whether they have copd 15 or not. 16 but this six- to eight-hour surgery where 17 the ear gets flipped up and muscle gets 18 reworked and all the bony structures, it is a 19 very tough surgery at any age. and do not 20 forget, mr. moyer is 82 years old at this time. 21 dr. civantos said the surgery would have 22 given him a fighting chance, and it was 60 23 percent shot at success. not 60 to 70, not 70. 24 he begrudgingly said 60. it is an either-or 25 proposition. he has a fighting chance if he united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 does both. it is not just surgery. 2 the idea that there was a quick fix 3 surgery that copd stopped is just not supported 4 by the evidence. 5 we also know what happens. dr. civantos 6 reports there is a rare possibility mr. moyer 7 could end up on a ventilator after the surgery. 8 and in his addendum, he indicates that 9 mr. moyer was scared of that. he did not want 10 to take a risk of surgery. and he did not want 11 to end up on the ventilator. 12 and that the family, after consulting 13 with dr. alvarez, made a plan to proceed with 14 radiation outside the university of miami. 15 he goes and starts the radiation. so 16 he is scared to go on a ventilator. he goes and 17 has it. but you have to understand that the 18 surgery was at best a fighting chance 19 proposition. 20 his age, his other health problems, the 21 fact that this was metastatic cancer that had 22 been coming back since 1999, all that stuff 23 plays into his decision. 24 he decides to go with radiotherapy, and 25 the doctors tell him, this is a good choice. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 this is where dr. policzer told you: i 2 know what doctors mean when you say try and 3 eradicate, you do not mean eradicate. 4 eradicate means eradicate. you get to 5 decide for yourselves what is credible and what 6 is not. this record says chemotherapy is a 7 good choice in trying to get rid of this 8 patient's cancer. 9 dr. policzer explained to you, though, 10 this type of radiation to the head and neck 11 certainly for an 82-year-old man is tough 12 treatment. a nasty disease and tough treatment 13 for people that never smoked cigarettes ever. 14 radiation on itself can make people walk 15 away from treatment, whether they have copd or 16 not. it is not the copd that stops mr. moyer 17 from having the radiation. 18 dr. civantos said this pretty clearly. 19 we asked him. is it the copd that stopped 20 mr. moyer from continuing with the radiation? 21 and he said: no. i do not think i could 22 say it as strongly as that. 23 reasonable degree of medical probability, 24 you are not getting that far? 25 and he said: i do not know. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 dr. civantos is telling you the copd is 2 not a direct, continuous, substantial cause of 3 why mr. moyer had trouble with the radiation. 4 surgery is a fighting chance, but it was always 5 going to be combined with radiation, and this 6 is dr. civantos telling you pretty clearly that 7 the copd did not prevent him from continuing 8 the radiation. 9 he starts the radiation, he gets past the 10 worst of it. i think he is past the nadir. he 11 decides to discontinue the radiation. 12 and these are the letters where his 13 doctors at the time say: look, you are past the 14 worst of it. please come back and finish your 15 treatment. by not completing it, you might 16 compromise the final outcome. we recommend you 17 resume as soon as possible. 18 he discontinued treatment in october of 19 2001. this is dr. arguelles and dr. tache. 20 they say at the bottom: he tolerated the 21 treatments reasonably well with the expected 22 skin reaction and mild to moderate mucositis. 23 the parotid tumor did appear to be showing good 24 response at the time of the last exam. 25 so he tolerates it well. it is working. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 it is shrinking the tumor. 2 dr. policzer says the cancer was 3 responding to the treatment. 4 dr. civantos says the tumor was 5 responding to the radiation treatment. 6 dr. civantos said: look, if he was my patient, 7 i would have recommended that he complete the 8 radiation, and his chances of survival would 9 have been better if he completed the treatment. 10 now, you know that mr. moyer did not 11 complete the treatment, but you have seen that 12 copd is not the legal cause of that. he is 82 13 years old. there is a variety of things going 14 on. 15 the plaintiff's own witnesses, 16 plaintiff's own doctors told you quite clearly 17 copd is not the reason he could not complete the 18 radiation. he cannot complete the radiation, 19 which is part of civantos's original plan to 20 give him a fighting chance, and they cannot link 21 copd or any smoking-related disease to the 22 cause of death. 23 the cause of death is skin cancer. copd 24 did not stop anybody from saving mr. moyer's 25 life. he was 82 years old. it had spread and united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 come back half a dozen times. it is a tough 2 disease. 3 your answer on those questions: did he 4 have a primary parotid? did the parotid cause 5 his death? they have to be no. it is not a 6 smoking-related disease. 7 and because they cannot link copd to his 8 death, your answer on whether the smoking 9 caused mr. moyer's death has to be "no" as 10 well. 11 now, dr. policzer told you that after 12 mr. moyer stopped the radiation treatment is 13 the first time that he ends up in hospice. 14 it is the fall of 2011 when mr. moyer decides to 15 stop the radiation treatment, and you saw the 16 evidence after 2011, 2012, mr. moyer's living 17 by himself, got the roommate from -- the 18 snowbird roommate from canada. excuse me. 19 he is got the snowbird roommate from 20 canada, but he is living on his own. he is 21 driving himself around town. cooking for 22 himself. he is shopping for himself. paying 23 his own bills. 24 you saw him driving away in january of 25 2013, about six weeks before he passed away. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 but in 2011, 2012, mr. moyer is living by 2 himself. it is not until april of 2012 that we 3 see the first hospice record. 4 but in april of 2012, he is getting home 5 care. i think ms. irimi said they had a girl 6 taking care of him. that woman's name was 7 alicia lord. she spent time with mr. moyer 8 starting in april. 9 but policzer said there was no reason for 10 mr. moyer to come to hospice without the 11 cancer. before mr. moyer had cancer, a cancer 12 not related to smoking. before mr. moyer had a 13 nonsmoking-related cancer, he was never being 14 recommended to hospice? 15 that is correct. 16 it is after he stops the radiation therapy 17 for the nonsmoking-related cancer that we start 18 seeing the hospice records? 19 dr. policzer says: correct. 20 they start in april, but it is not until 21 the next year of 2013 that he is actually in 22 the facility. so he gets admitted in the 23 hospice, and the primary diagnosis is end-stage 24 head and neck cancer, specifically parotid 25 gland cancer. that is the skin cancer. the united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 nonsmoking-related cancer. 2 the records continue. these are 3 dr. policzer's own records. he is got 4 metastatic cancer, metastatic cancer, 5 metastatic cancer, metastatic cancer, 6 metastatic cancer. always, every time in 7 hospice, the number one diagnosis is metastatic 8 cancer. 9 you can see that respiratory distress 10 shows up number three, number two, and then 11 it is off the chart all the time. 12 that is what i mean by direct and 13 continuous. when you see respiratory distress 14 come and go, that is acute symptoms. that is not 15 chronic. that means he is having trouble 16 breathing this day, but not the next day. 17 nothing on the 15th. number two on the 18 16th. number two on the 17th. nothing on the 19 20th. nothing on the 21st. 20 the one thing that stays constant 21 throughout his time in hospice is the cancer, 22 the nonsmoking-related cancer. 23 disseminated cancer. this record comes 24 from march 1st, which is six days before 25 mr. moyer passes away. the primary diagnosis united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 is still cancer of the head and neck. 2 end-stage head and neck carcinoma. 3 the patient is stable with shortness of 4 breath. he is got the end-stage copd. seems to 5 be comfortable with his breathing. 6 the number one diagnosis is always 7 metastatic cancer, unrelated to smoking. 8 whether it is in hospice, whether it is from 9 dr. civantos, whether it is the medical record. 10 that is the direct, continuous and substantial 11 cause of mr. moyer's death, a metastatic skin 12 cancer. 13 he had copd. he died from skin cancer. 14 they cannot connect any of the 15 smoking-related diseases to his death. he had 16 copd, but he died of skin cancer. 17 and that is where we come to the death 18 certificate. 19 frankly, i do not know why we had such a 20 hullabaloo about the death certificate in this 21 case. you guys get to decide why it was 22 important to mr. moyer's daughters that copd be 23 on the death certificate. that is a call for 24 you to make. 25 what is important is you are going to get united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 an instruction that says death certificates 2 do not decide the issue of what caused 3 somebody's death. 4 they show the date, the time, the age, 5 give you some other background information, but 6 in here, in this court, the death certificate 7 you will read in the instructions, it does not 8 decide the issue. you decide the issue. 9 and when you decide the issue, remember 10 civantos. remember the skin cancer here and 11 dr. civantos telling you that is what this was, 12 the skin cancer got out. i could have maybe 13 given him a fighting chance, but i cannot tell 14 you that the copd stopped him from having the 15 treatment that i would have given him. 16 that should be all you need to know about 17 the wrongful death issues in this case. 18 now, your answer is no, we want to talk 19 about pain and suffering. the wrongful death 20 damages, that is the reason that we ask. i 21 think i asked it first and mr. batista, and i 22 think by the end mr. hammer was asking. 23 that is why the ages of the daughters are 24 important. when you talk about a wrongful 25 death, one of the things you are supposed to united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 keep in mind is how long was the life. 2 mr. moyer got to see his daughters grow 3 into middle age. he saw his grandkids grow to 4 be teenagers. it was a full life, full of 5 vacations every summer, restaurants every 6 weekend, country clubs, new houses, new rugs, 7 new skates, new cars, fun and exciting things, 8 heat games, dolphins games. 9 it was a full life. he lived to be 83 10 years old. and when he died, he died of 11 metastatic skin cancer 13 years after he 12 decided to quit smoking cigarettes. 13 he is not an engle class member, and 14 smoking did not cause his death. 15 now, i want to switch gears a little bit. 16 there is four questions on the verdict form. 17 and thank you for your patience, i know 18 it is a lot of talking. i have about a half 19 hour left, and then we will hear from ms. ruiz 20 and mr. woods. 21 i want to switch gears and talk a little 22 bit about questions 8, 9, and 10 on the verdict 23 form. 24 i lost the sheet of paper here. there it 25 is. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 if you would switch me to the elmo, 2 please. 3 while i'm here, this is: did mr. moyer 4 have primary parotid? there is not even cancer 5 in that parotid gland. 6 when you talk about the legal cause for 7 number 12, were any of mr. moyer's 8 smoking-related diseases a legal cause of his 9 death? that answer is no as well. it is the 10 skin cancer, and the copd did not stop it. 11 question number 8. there is four of 12 these. they ask whether, as to each defendant, 13 mr. moyer reasonably relied to his detriment on 14 a statement or omission made by a defendant 15 after may 5 of 1982. 16 there is two of these questions that asked 17 if he relied on a statement from one of the 18 defendants, and then there is two of these 19 questions that ask whether he relied on a 20 statement as part of the conspiracy. 21 the date 1982 is important. you have the 22 questions for before, but when you read the 23 instructions, it makes it perfectly clear that 24 the important issue here is whether plaintiffs 25 had proved mr. moyer relied on a statement united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 after 1982. 2 but the first thing -- and keith, you can 3 switch me back over, please. 4 the first -- this is the jury instruction 5 on what reasonable reliance means. may 5, 6 1982, will be in the instructions for you. and 7 i'll get to it in a second. i know it is just a 8 weird technical date. 9 but on these reliance questions, 1, 2, 3, 10 4, the real issue is whether plaintiffs have 11 showed you he relied on anything after may of 12 1982. 13 but in order to rely on something, 14 there is a very important limitation. 15 the jury instructions say quite clearly 16 that mr. moyer cannot be found to have relied 17 on a statement or omission if he knew it was 18 false or its falsity was obvious to him, or if 19 the fact allegedly concealed was already known 20 to him. 21 put in simple terms, you cannot hide 22 something from someone if they already know 23 it is true. 24 and that is the biggest reason your answer 25 for all of these reliance questions from united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 mr. moyer has to be "no." 2 mr. moyer knew everything he needed to 3 know about smoking, from at least the '50s, the 4 '50s and '60s. every single fact that they 5 talk about with ti and ctr and tirc, the 6 organizations he never heard of, every single 7 one of those facts was known to him for decades 8 before they were even made. 9 he cannot rely on something -- even if 10 that statement is not true, he cannot rely on it 11 if he knows the truth. and he did. 12 this is the drawbridge. it is not a 13 castle. it is the 17th street causeway. we have 14 all been stuck there more times than we can 15 probably remember. 16 but that is the problem. they cannot 17 connect anything that went on with conspiracy 18 that dr. proctor talked about to mr. moyer. 19 the drawbridge stayed open through the 20 whole case. it is not just the lack of him 21 seeing it or knowing about it or hearing about 22 it. the fundamental reason is you cannot 23 conceal something from someone if they already 24 know the truth. 25 let us just go quickly through all the united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 stuff that mr. moyer learned about smoking in 2 his life. 3 these are the articles from detroit in 4 the '50s, linking lung cancer to smoking. they 5 are not just articles that we picked. these 6 are from the newspapers that were in 7 mr. moyer's own home. 8 witness after witness told you he was a 9 smart man, stayed up on current events, knew 10 what he was doing. 11 reader's digest in the '50s. how harmful 12 are cigarettes. cancer by the carton. 13 instructions on quitting. it is not just 14 linking smoking with cancer, heart disease, 15 emphysema. going this far back. 16 when you look through the evidence, 17 you will see that these articles have advice on 18 how to stop. 19 this is a magazine in mr. moyer's house 20 way back in the '50s. you have seen this one 21 where in 1957 the surgeon general said there 22 had been excellent coverage, and the head of 23 the national cancer institute indicated that 24 the media and the newspapers, radio had done a 25 terrific job covering this and informing the united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 public. 2 1964, the surgeon general's report comes 3 out. mr. moyer remembered himself, remembered 4 the coverage, remembers edward r. murrow a year 5 later. 6 this is the cover from the fort 7 lauderdale sun-sentinel. want to quit smoking? 8 read on. men who know best cure is not easy. 9 that is from the fort lauderdale papers. 10 this is mr. moyer talking about edward r. 11 murrow and the impression it made on him. 12 13 14 follows:) 15 q. do you remember seeing anti-smoking 16 advertisements? 17 a. yeah, i remember several instances of 18 people who -- i remember specifically the edward r. 19 murrow, when he sat and talked about dying of lung 20 cancer. i think it was after he was already dead. 21 there was a commercial that they had, that he was 22 telling you to quit, and it made a very big impression 23 on me. so big that i quit about 30 years later. 24 q. did you believe what he was saying? 25 a. i believed it. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 (video clip concluded.) 2 mr. boyce: he believed it. '64, 1965. 3 he believes that edward r. murrow died from 4 lung cancer from smoking. 5 mr. schlesinger: judge, may i approach, 6 please. 7 the court: sure. 8 (the following discussion was held at 9 sidebar:) 10 mr. schlesinger: sounds to me like he 11 cut that man's answer off right in the middle 12 of the answer. i'm not sure. but i have a 13 feeling the man seemed like he was still 14 talking. i do not think that was the man's full 15 answer. 16 the court: but i do not know what his 17 complete answer is. 18 mr. schlesinger: page and line and just 19 stopped. 20 the court: what is his full answer? 21 mr. hammer: his full answer was: i 22 believe he had lung cancer. 23 the court: let me see it. 24 mr. boyce: judge, on their 25 representation, i'll add it. it does not united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 matter. 2 the court: thank you. 3 (sidebar discussion concluded, and the 4 following was held in open court:) 5 mr. boyce: the video clip got cut off a 6 little bit there. the rest of his answer is 7 that, i believed mr. murrow had lung cancer. 8 and i think what he added was: he had no 9 reason to lie. 10 believes edward r. murrow. believes the 11 psa. believes that edward r. murrow gets 12 smoking (sic) from lung cancer. 13 and the last part of it is, he knows that 14 murrow has no reason to lie. huge impression 15 on him. 16 heard that from seidman, heard that from 17 larry moyer, heard that from mr. moyer himself. 18 that edward r. murrow clip made a very, very 19 big impression on mr. moyer. that is 1965. 20 remember, there is no quit attempt 21 attached to that. that is willing smoking. 22 that is why addiction is not a legal cause 23 of this man's behavior. you hear about 24 something like that. it makes an impression on 25 you. you do not respond by trying to stop. you united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 are responsible for it. addiction is not the 2 reason. 3 1966, the warning labels go on the pack. 4 smoking may be hazardous to your help. 5 congress has acted. the next step is yours. 6 mr. moyer, we asked him: did you believe 7 the warning? 8 i think i did, for the most part, you 9 know. i would say yes. 10 believes the warning back in 1966. it is 11 on every pack of cigarettes afterwards. on 12 every pack of salem cigarettes he ever smoked. 13 you can skip this one. 14 1970 warning label, surgeon general has 15 determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous 16 to your health. 17 again, mr. moyer turns 40 in 1970. and 18 again, no quit attempt connected to that one. 19 this is uncle tommy. we talked about 20 this a little early on. again, no quit 21 attempts. 22 larry moyer is telling him this is going 23 to happen to you. this is the disease that 24 mr. moyer ended up with, emphysema. 1985. 25 uncle tommy's condition went on for ten years, united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 and it was general knowledge among the family. 2 no quit attempt attached to that. that 3 kind of awareness prevents mr. moyer from 4 relying on anything that ti or ctr or tirc 5 says. 6 somebody takes you to see your uncle and 7 tells you he is got emphysema from smoking, and 8 this is going to happen to you, you cannot 9 conceal that fact as a matter of law from that 10 person anymore. 11 lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease. 12 he knew everything he needed to know throughout 13 his smoking career. 14 the '85 warning labels, smoking causes 15 lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema. smoking 16 by pregnant women results in fetal injury and 17 premature birth. smoking contains carbon 18 monoxide. 19 and the same one that dr. civantos talked 20 about, the reason the four key dates of '64 and 21 '75 and '85 and '94 are so important: quitting 22 smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to 23 your health. 24 those go on in 1985. and mr. moyer stops 25 reading them. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 this shows how he already knows what is 2 going on. nothing shows you know it more when 3 you stop reading them. 4 he believes them in '66. by the time we 5 get to the '80s, i did not read them. 6 you just stopped reading what was on the 7 package? 8 and he says: right. 9 you cannot conceal a fact from someone if 10 they already know it is the case. 11 i want to talk now fundamentally, that 12 reason applies to all defendants. you will see 13 on the verdict form -- and if you could switch 14 me back over to the elmo -- actually, never 15 mind, keith. thank you. 16 when you go through the questions on 17 reliance, and these are 8, 9, 10, 11 on the 18 verdict form, you will see that they list out 19 each defendant. 20 and because of what we just talked about 21 and the jury instruction, how you cannot 22 conceal something from someone that they 23 already know, your answer should be "no" for 24 each defendant for each one of those questions. 25 but in particular, this is where the date united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 of 1982 comes in. and i want to talk about 2 reynolds a little bit specifically. 3 plaintiffs played the clip of mr. moyer 4 saying he thought salem lights were a step in 5 the right direction. they are going to suggest 6 to you in rebuttal that you should answer these 7 questions yes. 8 the first and fundamental reason is the 9 jury instruction. you cannot rely if you know 10 the truth. 11 but there is a second reason for it. 12 one, mr. moyer told you, in his own words, that 13 by the time he switched to salem, he was aware 14 that smoking caused lung cancer. 15 i would have to say yes. 16 and were you also aware before you ever 17 smoked a salem that it could cause breathing 18 difficulties? 19 yes. 20 we asked him: why did you go to menthol? 21 you can skip this one. 22 what did you like about salem? 23 he said: i got to where i liked the taste 24 of menthol, rather than non-menthol, which was 25 not the case when i first started. i always united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 liked menthol and wondered why they did not make 2 ten-packs instead of twenty for people who 3 did not want to smoke menthol all the time. 4 the last two i think are very important 5 when you consider reynolds on the reliance 6 questions. 7 i would have wound up with menthol 8 anyway. mr. moyer's own words. 9 not necessarily with salem? 10 no. 11 we asked him -- you can skip these 12 videos, thank you. 13 do you remember why you picked salem? 14 first he said: you know, i liked menthol. 15 i probably would have ended up with it anyway. 16 and it is possible -- says it is a distinct 17 possibility, down at the bottom, that he 18 started smoking salems because irma becker was 19 smoking salem, and he gradually began to smoke 20 some of hers. 21 he said: i cannot honestly answer that, i 22 do not recall, but it is a distinct possibility. 23 he is not quite sure if it was irma or his 24 like for menthol. there is one thing that is 25 perfectly sure about it. reynolds united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 advertisements had nothing to do with it. 2 can you say with any certainty that salem 3 lights ads affected your decision to smoke 4 salem lights? 5 no. 6 clear as can be. when you get to 7 reliance, remember when he knew, remember this 8 testimony. no. 9 can you say with any certainty that salem 10 ads affected your decision to smoke salems? 11 i cannot say that the ads did. no. 12 remember what mr. moyer knows and 13 remember this testimony when you look at 14 reynolds on that verdict form for those 15 reliance questions. 16 lastly is the timing -- well, first, i 17 do not want anybody to think that mr. moyer 18 thought lights were safe. 19 we heard about diet coke and salad 20 dressing and low calories and that kind of 21 stuff. not clear where that came from from 22 mr. moyer. certainly did not come from reynolds 23 advertisements. his testimony is unequivocal 24 on that point. 25 we said: you did not think it was safe, united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 did you? 2 he said: no. 3 you did not think it was going to 4 eliminate your risk? 5 no. 6 and you did not think it was completely -- 7 mr. moyer steps in and says: no, i did 8 not. 9 final point on the timing. one thing we 10 know about in this case is that mr. moyer 11 switched to salem and salem lights before may 12 of 1982. 13 miss rodd took the stand and told you 14 that she remembered pretty clearly that she had 15 come home from college in her junior year. she 16 started 1979, graduated in 1983. 17 she said she distinctly remembers coming 18 home sometime in her junior year, going to 19 lunch with her father and seeing him with salem 20 lights. 21 if may of '82 is the end of her junior 22 year, he is obviously made the switch to salem 23 well before may 5 of 1982. 24 if he is got salem lights out with his 25 daughter sometime in the school year of 1982, united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 he is made that switch to salem lights well 2 before may 5 of 1982. 3 you have got the reliance point for all the 4 defendants. but the reynolds on salem, would 5 have ended up with menthol anyway. there is a 6 good chance he got them from miss becker. 7 and lastly, we know, according to the 8 testimony of his own daughter, that for 9 whatever reason he switched to salem lights 10 before may 5 of 1982. 11 now, the good news is that gets us 12 through three of the key issues. 13 thank you for your patience, and i've got 14 one more topic and i want to turn to that now. 15 this is where plaintiffs would have you 16 start. it is with punitive damages. 17 mr. schlesinger said a couple times that 18 dale moyer is a conduit to punitive damages. 19 he is not a conduit. he is not a fish either. 20 he is a person who lived 83 years, making his 21 own decisions on his own terms. but he is not 22 just a conduit to punitive damages. 23 in this case, all of the damages -- well, 24 in this case we have been talking about the 25 compensatory issue. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 the punitive damages are different. 2 punitive damages are above and beyond what you 3 may or may not award to mr. moyer's daughters 4 because of the smoking. and all of the money 5 that you do or do not award would go to the 6 daughters -- 7 mr. hammer: objection, judge. it is not 8 an issue of money. it is an issue of 9 entitlement to punitive damages. 10 the court: thank you. 11 objection noted. sustained. 12 mr. boyce: punitive damages are 13 different here. they are different, and they 14 have a different purpose. we are going to talk 15 about how in order to award punitive damages, 16 they have to connect something to mr. moyer. 17 but first, i want to tell you about the 18 burden of proof of punitive damages. 19 this is dr. proctor here -- and let me 20 just get to this point real quick. all of the 21 stuff that dr. proctor talked about, he 22 admitted in this slide he could not connect to 23 mr. moyer. 24 he said right here: i did not do anything 25 to prepare for this case. i do not know united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 anything about his biography. 2 do you know what newspapers he read? 3 no. 4 is it really important to your opinion as 5 to how far the tobacco companies affected 6 people? 7 it is not relevant at all what his 8 particular life was for my expertise. 9 that is dr. proctor. it is not relevant at 10 all what mr. moyer's life was. no relevance at 11 all. 12 this, i think, is a good example of just 13 how wide the drawbridge is. plaintiffs talked 14 a lot about youth marketing. you are going to 15 hear more about it in mr. schlesinger's 16 rebuttal. 17 this is the last time i get to talk to 18 you. so i want to give you a couple things to 19 think about as you hear from mr. schlesinger in 20 rebuttal. 21 but this chart, more than any other one, 22 shows just how far removed the real life that 23 mr. moyer led is from mr. schlesinger's attack 24 on the tobacco industry. 25 underneath the blue, it says: defendants' united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 marketing practices at time dale was a youth. 2 the first one is from 1927, just a year 3 and a half before mr. moyer was even born. 4 the second one is from 1928, which is 5 from a full year before mr. moyer is even born. 6 dr. proctor told you he had looked, and 7 that those were very rare documents. he 8 searched for more, he could not find them. 9 but we have got two on the left from before 10 he is even born. we have got one from 1973, when 11 mr. moyer was 44 years old, and one from 1984, 12 when mr. moyer is 55 years old. 13 he is 44 and 55 years old. 14 it is not about other smokers. this is 15 the burden of proof. it has to be evidence for 16 punitive damages that is precise and explicit, 17 lacking in confusion and produces a firm 18 belief. it is a much higher burden. 19 we have preponderance of the evidence on 20 the other issues. we have a much higher burden 21 for punitive damages, because they are 22 different. they are different damages. 23 here, the judge is going to explain to 24 you perfectly clear, you cannot use the engle 25 findings to decide whether punitive damages united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 should be awarded in this case. you cannot use 2 harm to others. 3 and this is the objection i've made 4 throughout this case, and this is the 5 instruction as it is going to be in your 6 pamphlets: in deciding whether punitive damages 7 are warranted, you may not seek to punish a 8 defendant for any harms suffered by individuals 9 other than mr. moyer. 10 this is the drawbridge. this is where 11 they have to connect something that dr. proctor 12 talked about, something from a document to 13 mr. moyer, and they just cannot do it. 14 they never came close. 15 it is not just his knowledge; it is that 16 there is no connection. so much of the stuff we 17 saw in this case, all of the philip morris 18 documents. he never smoked a philip morris 19 brand. all the tv shows he never saw, the 20 flintstones, the hillbillies. 21 once it goes to saturday morning, 22 reynolds pulls the sponsorship. once the kids 23 start watching, they pull the sponsorship. 24 that is the stuff you hear on cross. 25 you do not hear that on direct. you never united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 heard any direct connection. never heard of ti 2 and ctr, never heard of tirc. never saw any of 3 the ads, all the philip morris ads and 4 statements, none of that stuff with any 5 connection with mr. moyer at all. 6 this case is not about other smokers, 7 it is only about mr. moyer. and that is why here 8 on the facts of his life, punitive damages are 9 not warranted. 10 you also get to consider mitigating 11 evidence. 12 in determining whether punitive damages 13 are warranted, you can consider mitigating 14 evidence, which shows that there is no need to 15 do it. 16 i'll go through this quickly. 17 we talked about quite a bit of mitigating 18 evidence here. quite a bit. 19 with dr. proctor and his presentation 20 that he is given 50 times, that is 21 extraordinarily one-sided on direct. 22 you saw on cross, that i have to show the 23 other side of the coin, but you also saw how he 24 sees those documents coming. he knows the 25 other side. he is been through this drill 50 united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 times and made more than $2 million. he knows 2 the documents i'm going to show him before 3 time. but he does not give them to you. 4 but this evidence you get to consider. 5 the first is all the publications from 6 ctr, nobel prize winners trying to figure out 7 what causes cancer, 7,000 articles published, 8 600 of them cited in the surgeon general's 9 reports. 10 you heard about the green monster, where 11 brown & williamson and american published a 12 compendium on all the published literature on 13 smoking and health. gave it to the surgeon 14 general's report. the committee writing the 15 report in '64. 16 you heard about dr. rodgman from reynolds 17 publishing his findings, giving speeches to the 18 american cancer society, sharing that 19 information with the public health community. 20 you heard how there are no secrets. this 21 is one of dr. teague's everything stamped 22 secret and confidential. these companies were 23 competitors. this is business, saying this is 24 a confidential company document. but no secret 25 on the substance. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 1942. tobacco is a means of 2 administering nicotine. 3 dr. teague, tobacco products a vehicle to 4 deliver nicotine. 5 i want to talk about filters just 6 quickly. 7 plaintiffs made it seem like yesterday 8 for every minute of every time there was a 9 filter on a cigarette, it was an intentional 10 effort on the part of the tobacco industry to 11 addict and kill smokers. 12 and the truth could not be farther away 13 from that allegation. starting way back in the 14 '50s and '60s, the public health community and 15 tobacco companies started looking at ways to 16 make cigarettes better. and filters was one of 17 the things they came up with. 18 you can see in 1979, a document that is 19 in evidence, which is on page xii. 20 the average tar and nicotine deliveries 21 have continued to decline. 22 this was encouraged by a series of 23 government actions beginning in '66. they are 24 talking about using filters to reduce the 25 amount of tar and nicotine that smokers get. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 in 1996, the national cancer institute in 2 monograph 7, again a document in evidence, 3 says: today's filter-tipped and lower-tar 4 cigarettes produce lower rates of lung cancer 5 than in the higher tar and nicotine 6 predecessors. 7 the more recent case-control evidence 8 remains consistent with the first component of 9 this conclusion. 10 that is 1996. 11 mr. schlesinger read you 2013, and what 12 the surgeon general says today. this is where 13 presentism works against plaintiffs. you cannot 14 go back and judge the guys that were trying to 15 make cigarettes safer based on what they write 16 in 2014. 17 in the '60s and '70s, the public health 18 community was encouraging tobacco companies to 19 develop lower-tar cigarettes, to put filters on 20 them. 21 the bad stuff comes from burning tobacco. 22 if you can get that out of there, you would 23 solve a lot of these problems. but it was a 24 joint effort. 25 the 2014 sgr does not change the united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 legitimacy of the effort to make cigarettes 2 better. 3 this is the document we talked about 4 where the head of r.j. reynolds in 1968 to the 5 head of reynolds science department said: if 6 there is a safer cigarette, let us continue and 7 increase our efforts in this program. please 8 prepare a plan to carry this out. 9 the document that dr. proctor has seen 10 dozens of times does not show it to you on 11 direct examination. let us get a plan in place. 12 this is dr. rodgman. you heard about how 13 he worked with the national cancer institute. 14 national cancer institute writes him a 15 letter and says thank you. i would like to 16 express my thanks and appreciation at the 17 national cancer institute for your substantial 18 contributions to this committee. 19 that is 1972. 20 now, the national cancer institute closed 21 down the tobacco working group. but reynolds 22 kept going. you heard this from dr. proctor. 23 reynolds developed premier and later 24 eclipse. that is the monograph they published 25 showing all their research about it. that united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 document is in evidence. 2 dr. proctor told you that premier and 3 eclipse reduced the carcinogens in smoke. 4 premier went on the market in 1988. 5 dr. proctor told you -- i asked him: 6 would you agree that reynolds made a concerted 7 effort through premier to address the concept 8 of bad things in smoke coming from the burning? 9 yeah, i agree. he said: the flaw is that 10 they did not remove the other cigarettes. 11 he wants to ban cigarettes. 12 but with respect to mitigating evidence, 13 you have no connection to mr. moyer. 14 so you have got the other side of the coin. 15 the other side of the coin is a legitimate 16 effort from the folks at reynolds and elsewhere 17 to try to reduce the risks of smoking, and 18 eclipse is a big part of that. 19 and dr. proctor told you that was a 20 concerted effort. 21 the instructions also explain to you that 22 one of the reasons you might consider awarding 23 punitive damages is to deter future conduct. 24 and i want to take a little bit of time 25 to talk about how we are in a different world united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 today. 2 the first reason we are in a different 3 world you have heard repeatedly, there have been 4 a variety of settlements over the years. all 5 the general conduct that you heard that is not 6 connected to mr. moyer. that is what is behind 7 those settlements, that debt has been paid. 8 you can see this in the surgeon general's 9 report. 10 mr. schlesinger: objection, judge. 11 the court: sustained. 12 mr. schlesinger: move to strike the 13 comment about that. 14 the court: thank you. 15 jury is to disregard. 16 proceed, counsel. 17 mr. boyce: we will go through the 18 documents. 19 now there is no more ti, no more ctr, no 20 more tirc. the advertising is restricted, and 21 the fda controls the manufacture, design, 22 nicotine level, ingredients and advertising of 23 cigarettes. period. 24 this comes from the documents in 25 evidence. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 2012 surgeon general reports says that 2 the 1998 master settlement agreement resulted 3 in taking down billboard advertising, transit 4 advertising, as well as advertising that 5 targeted underage youth. 6 it also created the american legacy 7 foundation, which implemented a nationwide 8 anti-smoking campaign targeting youth. 9 it worked. due in part to these changes, 10 there was a decrease in tobacco use among 11 adults and among youth following the master 12 settlement agreement, which is documented in 13 this report. the master settlement agreement 14 is from 1998. 15 in 2009, the fda was given authority over 16 the manufacturing, marketing, distribution, 17 design of tobacco products. it restricts where 18 they can be sold and how they can be 19 advertised. 20 the fda could establish product standards 21 for nicotine yields, take out any ingredients, 22 do anything they want to do. 23 but today in this country, it is the fda 24 that decides what goes in cigarettes. it 25 decides how they are made, it decides how much united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 nicotine is in them. they are in control of 2 all of this. 3 dr. proctor disagrees, because the fda 4 has not done anything yet. but they are in 5 control of all of this. there is nothing to 6 deter. 7 the fda controls the way cigarettes are 8 made, designed, and how much nicotine is in 9 them. 10 they have not made any changes. okay? 11 they have not made any changes since 2009. they 12 have not taken nicotine out. you have heard 13 repeatedly they have not said: take this 14 ingredient out. 15 and the simple fact of that is there is no 16 such thing as a safe cigarette. when you burn 17 tobacco, you get bad things in there. 18 but the mitigating evidence shows that 19 there was a legitimate effort to make 20 cigarettes better. 21 and this stuff, from the fda being in 22 charge, shows you there is nothing to deter. 23 there is no need in this case for punitive 24 damages. 25 no connection between what united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 mr. schlesinger talks about and mr. moyer, 2 mitigating evidence that dr. proctor did not 3 show you. 4 finally, no need to deter it because the 5 fda controls the way they are designed, the way 6 they are made, what goes in them, the way 7 they are sold and the way they are advertised. 8 last topic. 9 thank you again for your attention. i 10 know i've been talking for a long time. i 11 really do appreciate it. i know it is hard to 12 sit there and listen to charts and go quickly. 13 you guys are remarkable. you always pay 14 attention. every time i look around, everybody 15 is right there, engaged, and that is something 16 when this is over, that you all should be proud 17 of. you all should be proud of the way you 18 performed as jurors in this case. 19 the last topic i want to talk about is 20 who is responsible for this. this is question 21 number 7 on the verdict form. you are going to 22 be instructed. 23 it says: state the percentage of any 24 responsibility for any of dale moyer's 25 smoking-related diseases. united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 you are going to be instructed, because 2 mr. moyer admits that he has some 3 responsibility in this case, that you have to 4 put down a number for mr. moyer. you cannot put 5 zero. 6 but i want to make another point about 7 this. 8 the only way these percentages come into 9 play is if you answer no on the reliance 10 questions. 11 if you answer yes on the reliance 12 questions, you will be eliminating any 13 responsibility you think mr. moyer should bear 14 for his smoking. you will see it in the 15 instructions. 16 it is actually on page 29. 17 and it tells you that the court will 18 enter a judgment based on your verdict, and 19 unless you found for plaintiff on her 20 fraudulent concealment or conspiracy claims, 21 the court in entering the judgment will reduce 22 the total amount of damages by the percentage 23 of negligence which you find attributable to 24 mr. moyer. 25 so your first instruction, that you have united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 to put something down because mr. moyer admits 2 that he has some responsibility here. 3 but i want you to understand that on 4 those reliance questions, those fraud and fraud 5 concealment questions where reliance is a part 6 of that. if you answer yes on that, you are 7 finding that the defendants are one hundred percent 8 responsible for everything mr. moyer did on the 9 smoking. 10 mr. schlesinger: objection, judge, move 11 to strike. that is -- just -- 12 the court: thank you. 13 objection sustained. 14 mr. boyce: it is on page 29. it says: 15 unless you find for plaintiff on her fraudulent 16 concealment and conspiracy claims, the court 17 will reduce the total amount of damages. 18 you can figure out for yourself the flip 19 side of that when you review the instructions. 20 but i want to start -- excuse me, i want 21 to finish sort of where we started. that is the 22 concept of personal responsibility. 23 the idea that smoking is a choice. the 24 idea that people make a decision whether to 25 smoke cigarettes, and they most importantly united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 make their own decisions about when to stop and 2 how to do it. 3 we know that it takes continuous effort. 4 we know that it takes motivation. 5 but i want to talk a little bit about 6 personal responsibility. 7 when mr. hammer filled out the chart of 8 responsibility, he had forty percent for reynolds, 9 forty percent for lorillard, 15 percent for 10 liggett and 5 percent for mr. moyer. 11 5 percent out of 100. 12 i will leave this to your sound 13 discretion. 14 but what mr. hammer is basically 15 suggesting is when mr. moyer got up in the 16 morning, looked at himself in the mirror, only 17 5 percent of mr. moyer is there, that 18 95 percent of the mirror, the person looking 19 back at him, as he decided what to do with his 20 life and his day, whether he was going to smoke 21 or drink or gamble or eat or exercise or golf 22 or play cards, the person looking back in the 23 mirror, according to plaintiffs, is 95 percent 24 tobacco companies. 25 i leave it to your sound discretion. you united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 do not leave your common sense at the door. is 2 that the way we lead our lives? is that the 3 way we lead our lives in this country? 4 when you look in the mirror at the 5 beginning of your day, there is only one person 6 looking back at you, and it is you. 7 a person with free will. it is not a 8 fish. 9 addiction does not change this. in this 10 case, addiction means he smoked a lot. he 11 smoked in the morning. if you took it away 12 from him, he was irritable. it is not a legal 13 cause. 14 you look in the mirror, there is one face 15 looking back at you. not 5 percent of a face. 16 one hundred percent of a face, a man, a life. 17 the thing plaintiffs want you to skip 18 right over, ignore the drawbridge and use him 19 as a conduit for punitive damages. 20 that is not what this case is about. 21 that is not the way life is led. it is not what 22 personal responsibility means in this country. 23 we saw it throughout this case. 24 did i go too fast? 25 united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 2 follows:) 3 voice: in my opinion, people should be 4 warned of the dangers, and they are being 5 warned. what they then want to do, whether 6 they wish to smoke or not, is their own 7 business. 8 (video clip concluded.) 9 mr. boyce: that is dr. hammond way back 10 in 1955. 11 this is harry reasoner in 1964 making the 12 same point. 13 14 15 follows:) 16 voice: in this kind of a country, it 17 comes down to you, whether you like it or not. 18 no one is going to forbid an adult to smoke. 19 and it is now quite clear that no one is going 20 to tell him it is good for him either. 21 the decision is his. the decision and 22 the health that may depend on it. 23 (video clip concluded.) 24 mr. boyce: it is the same thing 25 dr. seidman told you when we looked at his app united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 that he sells to smokers to help them quit 2 smoking. 3 4 5 follows:) 6 voice: urges and cravings to smoke are 7 not choices. however, the action you take in 8 response to the urges and cravings is a choice. 9 the cigarette has no magical power, 10 except which you give it. when not acted on, 11 urges to smoke, no matter how powerful, occur 12 less often and become easier to ignore. 13 by not acting on the urge to smoke, you 14 choose voluntarily to protect your body and 15 your health. you choose not to act on the urge 16 to smoke because you truly believe this will 17 make life better. 18 (video clip concluded.) 19 mr. boyce: that is a choice. that is 20 plaintiff's addiction expert in the app he 21 sells to smokers saying quite clearly, wanting 22 to smoke, feeling an urge, that may not be a 23 choice. 24 but what you do, that person in the 25 mirror, what you do in response to it is a united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 choice. because it is a choice, you are 2 responsible for it. 3 this is the same attitude mr. moyer took 4 when he decided to buy a nightclub and sell 5 cigarettes himself. it is the same attitude the 6 mumtazes had when they sold cigarettes at a 7 chain of convenience stores. 8 mr. hammer: objection, judge. 9 the court: thank you. 10 sustained. that is not the issue. 11 mr. boyce: and it is the same attitude 12 mr. moyer had for his smoking and his life. 13 if there is one piece of evidence i would 14 encourage you to keep in your mind when 15 mr. schlesinger gets back up here, mr. moyer 16 quit smoking the first time he put a continuous 17 effort to stop, and that mr. moyer passed away 18 at age 83, after a life full of fun and 19 enjoyment. smoking never made him miss 20 anything. he saw his daughters grow to middle 21 age. his grandkids grow to 16. 22 most importantly, when he passed away, it 23 was 13 years after he decided to stop smoking, 24 and he died from a metastatic skin cancer. i 25 want to thank you again for your time and united reporting, inc. 954.525.2221 1 attention. 2 i hope you have enjoyed your time as jurors 3 half as much as i've enjoyed the opportunity to 4 present reynolds' case to you. i look forward 5 to your verdict. 6 but again, on behalf of miss amadi, 7 mr. harrison, mr. gentile on the computer 8 there, thank you for your time and attention. 3 ms. ruiz: thank you, your honor. may it 4 please the court. 5 good morning, everyone. 6 jurors: good morning. 7 ms. ruiz: you will be glad to hear that, 8 as you have seen during this trial, i'm going to 9 try not to repeat what you have already heard. 10 it is been a pleasure to be before you in 11 judge murphy's court, and i also want to thank 12 you on my behalf, on ms. manseur's behalf, on 13 liggett's behalf, for the careful attention 14 that you have paid to this case. 15 when this trial began, i gave a brief 16 opening statement, where i told you a little 17 bit about my client and what the evidence was 18 going to show about mr. moyer. 19 now we are at the end of this trial, and 20 mr. boyce did an excellent job of explaining to 21 you why plaintiff failed to meet her burden on 22 all of her claims against all defendants, but 23 it is plaintiff's burden to prove her case 24 against each defendant, so i need to cover what 25 the evidence was with respect to my client, 1 liggett. 2 we all have sympathy for the moyer 3 family. that does not mean that liggett is 4 responsible because mr. moyer chose to smoke 5 its cigarettes for such a short period of time. 6 when you consider the evidence in this 7 case, please use your natural reason and your 8 common sense. you did not check that at the 9 door when you got here, and i ask that you 10 please rely on that when you return to the jury 11 room to deliberate and evaluate the testimony 12 of the various people who came here to talk to 13 you during this trial. 14 so, with that in mind, what did the 15 evidence show? 16 this case is about two things: first, of 17 course, it is about mr. moyer and the way he 18 lived his life; and, second, it is whether 19 liggett, or any of the other defendants, did 20 anything or said anything that influenced 21 mr. moyer or his decisions. 22 nothing that liggett did influenced 23 mr. moyer's decisions or his behavior. 24 mr. moyer talked to you about that first 25 cigarette that he smoked. it was a lucky 1 strike. that is not a liggett brand. in fact, 2 the only liggett brand you heard throughout 3 this trial was chesterfield. 4 mr. moyer did not decide to smoke that 5 first lucky strike cigarette because of any 6 liggett advertising. mr. moyer did not mention 7 a liggett ad once in the hours of testimony 8 that you saw from him. 9 after that first cigarette, mr. moyer 10 told you that he smoked occasionally with his 11 friends. and, again, those cigarettes were 12 also lucky strikes. 13 after that, for about a 14-year period, 14 mr. moyer smoked three brands: lucky strike, 15 old gold, and chesterfield. 16 at first, he was smoking two cigarettes a 17 week; then he worked himself up to a cigarette 18 a day; and then later, towards the end of that 19 period, he was smoking a pack to a pack and a 20 half a day. 21 now, dr. seidman, plaintiff's expert, 22 came here and showed you that chart of all the 23 brands that he thought that mr. moyer smoked. 24 he tried to convince you that the only brand 25 mr. moyer smoked while he was in the army was 1 chesterfield. 2 as you saw on cross-examination, he had 3 to agree that was an oversight on someone's 4 part, because mr. moyer told you that 5 chesterfield was his least favorite of these 6 three brands, and that he smoked them, at most, 7 12-and-a-half percent of the time during that 8 early period. 9 so we know from his testimony that 10 mr. moyer smoked very little liggett 11 cigarettes. he was, predominantly, a lucky 12 strike smoker. 13 to avoid doing the math, let us just 14 assume that mr. moyer was smoking a pack a day 15 during that 14-year period of time. we know 16 that is more than what he was smoking, because 17 he started out smoking only two cigarettes a 18 week, and it was not towards the end that he 19 worked himself up to a pack to a pack and a 20 half a day. 21 but just to make it easy, let us be 22 generous and say he was smoking a pack a day 23 for the entire period. that would give him 24 1.75 pack-years of liggett smoking. that is 25 less than two pack-years, compared to the over 1 100 pack-years that drs. seidman and wolek told 2 you that he smoked. 3 as you heard, he switched to kent in the 4 1950s. he did not smoke a liggett brand after 5 that. 6 now, as i said, plaintiff has the burden 7 of proving that liggett cigarettes caused 8 mr. moyer's illnesses. she must prove 9 causation as to each defendant by the greater 10 weight of the evidence. 11 here's the jury instruction. it is a 12 mouthful. plaintiff, essentially, has to prove 13 that, but for mr. moyer's smoking of liggett 14 cigarettes, he would not have gotten sick. 15 so, ask yourself, did his use of 16 chesterfield cigarettes make a difference in 17 mr. moyer's outcome? 18 as one of plaintiff's own treating 19 physicians told you, the answer to that 20 question is no. 21 here's what dr. wolek said. he was 22 asked: if mr. moyer had smoked five pack-years 23 less than what he did smoke, do you think he 24 still would have developed copd? 25 his answer: i have no idea. i do not 1 think anybody can answer that question, but 2 would assume that the amount that he smoked, it 3 would not have made a difference. 4 plaintiff did not present any evidence to 5 you to establish that, but for mr. moyer's 6 smoking of chesterfield cigarettes, he would not 7 have gotten sick. and because she did not meet 8 her burden on this point, if you get this far 9 along in the verdict form, you should check 10 "no" next to liggett for question 6. 11 beyond that issue, there was not any 12 evidence that liggett did or said or failed to 13 do or say anything that affected mr. moyer and 14 his smoking decisions in any way. 15 you heard a lot of arguments about 16 tobacco companies, and what they did or did not 17 do. i would like to talk about liggett, and 18 what did liggett do. 19 the evidence showed that liggett was a 20 responsible tobacco company, took its own path. 21 we saw evidence that, in the 1950s, and 22 culminating with the 1964 surgeon general's 23 report, there was emerging scientific evidence 24 about the risks of cigarette smoking. 25 one of the most widely publicized studies 1 was that wynder/graham mouse skin painting 2 study in 1953. 3 what does liggett do in response to that 4 study? liggett did not attend the plaza hotel 5 meeting, for example. mr. schlesinger did not 6 mention that when he talked to you about the 7 plaza hotel meeting in his closing. 8 liggett did not have anything to do with 9 the frank statement. when he showed the frank 10 statement to you, he did not tell you that 11 liggett was not a part of that frank statement. 12 liggett did not join the tirc. instead, 13 liggett responded to that new information 14 coming out by taking an independent path. 15 remember this 1958 document that 16 plaintiff put into evidence? this is 17 plaintiff's exhibit 3289. 18 it is authored by british scientists who 19 visited the united states, they visited 20 liggett, and here's what they report about 21 liggett: liggett felt that the problem was 22 sufficiently serious to justify large-scale 23 investment by the company directly in 24 experimental research on smoking and cancer. 25 they go on to report: we were told that 1 liggett has already invested considerably more 2 in this work than the combined donations of the 3 rest of the industry to the tirc. 4 that is at page 5 of that document. 5 liggett invested enormous resources in a 6 biological testing program with its consultant, 7 arthur d. little. 8 adl was a preeminent scientific 9 consulting firm of its time. 10 and, together, liggett and adl set out to 11 do two things: they wanted to see if the mouse 12 skin painting test results could be replicated, 13 and they wanted to see if there was anything in 14 cigarette smoke that was causing the problems. 15 this was an ongoing process, and both 16 liggett and adl shared their research with the 17 public, ultimately turning all of it over to 18 the surgeon general's committee in april of 19 1963. 20 you might remember that stack of paper 21 that i had when i was talking to dr. proctor. 22 it is in these boxes. it is liggett exhibit 231. 23 liggett provided almost 10 years of 24 research to the committee in that submission. 25 it covered a lot of ground. 1 the members of the advisory committee 2 repeatedly praised liggett and adl for the 3 quality of the work and the amount of ground 4 that they covered in that research. 5 here's the assistant surgeon general, 6 writing to dr. kensler at adl. this is liggett 7 exhibit 219. 8 the assistant surgeon general writes to 9 liggett: we feel that simple acknowledgment of 10 the receipt of the nine volumes which you 11 submitted to us is not sufficient. please 12 accept, on behalf of liggett and adl, our 13 special gratitude for the tremendous time, 14 effort, and expense in the production of this 15 material for our use, and that they were 16 grateful for the oral presentation made. 17 here, in liggett 2398, these are minutes 18 from a 1963 meeting of the surgeon general's 19 committee. and they report, in those minutes, 20 they cannot possibly record the massive amount 21 of data in these reports. the committee 22 thanked drs. kensler and hainer on behalf of 23 the committee for their comprehensive and 24 well-organized presentation, as well as the 25 documents that had been prepared, and those 1 still to come. 2 here again, in a memo from the u.s. 3 department of agriculture -- this is liggett 4 6965 -- the chief of the tobacco laboratory for 5 the government said this about the submission: 6 the report contains a wealth of information, 7 especially with regard to the biological 8 responses of animal systems to cigarette smoke. 9 he goes on to report: in view of the 10 voluminous amount of material contained in the 11 report, it would be impossible to record here 12 the many findings obtained in the 10-year 13 period of productive collaboration. 14 now, dr. proctor shared with you this 15 document: l&m: a perspective review. it is 16 plaintiff's exhibit 2138. 17 and he told you that liggett did not share 18 that there are biologically active materials 19 present in cigarette smoke that are 20 cancer-causing, cancer-promoting, poisonous, 21 stimulating, pleasurable, and flavorful. 22 he told you that liggett did not share 23 these top conclusions with the surgeon general. 24 i invite you to look at the submission. again, 25 it is 231. i think you will see that dr. proctor 1 just did not know what was in there. 2 there is a lot of information in there. 3 it is 700-plus pages. i'm not going to go 4 through the whole thing. just to give you a 5 general idea of what is in there, i'll just 6 highlight a couple of them with you. 7 this is volume 1 at page 3. you will see 8 that liggett's researchers concluded, there is 9 an association between cigarette smoking and 10 overall death rates. 11 they go on to say that the effect 12 increases with the amount smoked. liggett also 13 reported its finding with regard to filters. 14 liggett never said that filters were safe. 15 instead, liggett told public health 16 officials -- this is liggett 2398 -- that 17 condensate from filtered smoke is just as or 18 almost as carcinogenic as that from unfiltered 19 smoke. 20 here, in the submission -- this is volume 21 3, table of contents -- materials which have 22 been suggested as possible carcinogens for the 23 human lung. it lists arsenic in there. we 24 heard a lot of talk about arsenic. 25 liggett also presented the results of its 1 own mouse skin painting studies, showing that 2 it produced carcinomas. liggett discusses 3 nicotine in the report. 4 here, in the submission, volume 3, 5 appendix a, liggett reports: the action of 6 nicotine on the central nervous system is 7 complex. it varies with the dose administered. 8 there is little doubt that nicotine is a potent 9 central nervous system stimulant, reporting 10 here that it works on the brain. 11 the submission goes on to say, in volume 12 4: nicotine is a highly active pharmacologic 13 agent in tobacco. the pleasurable effects of 14 nicotine are the reasons why people smoke. 15 nicotine is a potent stimulant of various 16 chemoreceptors, and one of the most potent 17 central nervous system arousal agents known. 18 clearly, this information was not 19 concealed by liggett from the public health 20 officials whose job it was to protect the 21 health of the country. 22 even with this information, public -- the 23 public health community did not change the 24 definition of "addiction," or did not find that 25 nicotine was addictive until 1988. that is when 1 they changed the definition of "addiction," so 2 that cigarettes would fall within the -- within 3 that definition. 4 so, you see, contrary to what dr. proctor 5 tells you, liggett's researchers showed the 6 committee that -- that -- that painting tar on 7 mouse skin backs causes tumors, that they 8 identified components of cigarette smoke that 9 are poisonous, they talked about how nicotine 10 is the reason that people smoke, they talked 11 about it being flavorful, stimulating, 12 pleasurable, and habit-forming. liggett was 13 not hiding the ball here. 14 now, switching gears a little bit, you 15 heard a little bit about industry 16 organizations. you heard that liggett was not 17 a member of the tobacco industry research 18 committee. 19 liggett did belong to the council for 20 tobacco research, from march 1964 to march -- 21 to january 1968. the evidence showed that 22 liggett was a minor player, at best, with these 23 organizations, contributing .3 percent to one 24 of them. 25 ask yourself, what documents did you see 1 from any liggett personnel, directing any of 2 these organizations to do anything. not a 3 single one. no evidence of liggett hiding the 4 ball here. not a single document shows liggett 5 keeping secrets. 6 so when you go back to the jury room and 7 you evaluate liggett's conduct, along with the 8 conduct of some of these other companies, ask 9 yourself, is there any evidence of liggett's 10 involvement in concealing information? 11 the answer to that is no. 12 of course, there is a crucial test for 13 evaluating these claims. did any of the 14 statements by any tobacco company, including 15 liggett, play any role in mr. moyer's decision 16 to start and continue smoking. 17 the short answer is no. 18 we know that, from 1966 on, there were 19 warning labels on the packs. they did not make 20 a difference to mr. moyer. as you heard, he 21 simply ignored them. 22 ask yourself, what statement, what 23 advertising, what conduct whatsoever would have 24 made a difference. 25 he never identified anything that he saw 1 from liggett. there is nothing liggett could 2 have done, that he would have relied upon, that 3 would have changed his mind. 4 and despite this information, dr. proctor 5 came here and he talked to you about 6 advertising in movies. it is up to you to 7 decide whether dr. proctor had his own agenda. 8 as mr. boyce told you, he is been paid 9 handsomely to come here and tell you that 10 advertising drives market share. think about 11 how much dr. proctor's been paid to come and 12 tell you that, and please consider that when 13 weighing his credibility. 14 he is an advocate. he advocates for the 15 abolition of cigarettes. that is his choice, 16 but it is something you get to consider in 17 weighing his credibility. 18 obviously, the goal of advertising is to 19 sell a product. this was not unique to the 20 tobacco companies. all companies do it. 21 liggett was allowed to advertise its products. 22 that is not evidence of wrongdoing. 23 you heard a lot from plaintiff's counsel 24 about marketing to youth. and, on that point, 25 i would just highlight, there is not a single 1 document from liggett, showing any marketing to 2 youth. so please remember that when you are 3 considering that issue. 4 because plaintiff did not meet her burden 5 of proving that mr. moyer relied on any liggett 6 statements or omissions, if you get this far 7 along in the verdict form, you should also 8 check "no" next to liggett for questions 8 and 9 9. 10 one of the last things i want to touch 11 upon with you is punitive damages. mr. boyce 12 touched on it. 13 as you have heard, punitive damages are 14 intended to punish a defendant. they must be 15 based on liggett's conduct and how liggett's 16 conduct impacted mr. moyer. 17 the burden here is on the plaintiff to 18 prove by clear and convincing evidence that 19 she is entitled to punitive damages. we do not 20 think there is a basis for awarding punitive 21 damages, and we do not think you should even get 22 there; but, if you do, you need to decide 23 whether there is any evidence that any of the 24 alleged wrongful conduct by liggett caused any 25 damage to mr. moyer, and whether it is necessary 1 to punish liggett, or send a message to 2 liggett, for the way it is currently doing 3 business. 4 based on everything i've just told you, 5 punitive damages are not warranted here. 6 you have heard about liggett's research in the 7 '50s. dr. proctor told you that this was an 8 honest response to the mouse skin painting 9 studies when they came out. 10 after warnings were on the packs, liggett 11 continued doing research. it was the first 12 cigarette company to put voluntary warnings on 13 its cigarette packs. i think the plaintiff 14 elicited that information from dr. proctor on 15 direct. 16 and today, of course, liggett is the 17 smallest of the tobacco companies. it has 18 about two percent of the market. there is no 19 need to punish or deter liggett here. 20 so i ask you, again, to please use your 21 intelligence, your common sense, looking at the 22 evidence in this case, and when you do that, 23 you will find that there is no support for 24 plaintiff's claim for money damages or 25 punishment against liggett. thank you. 3 mr. woods: thank you, your honor. may 4 it please the court. 5 good afternoon. 6 jurors: good afternoon. 7 mr. woods: again, my name is david 8 woods. and on behalf of mr. batista and 9 lorillard tobacco company, i also want to thank 10 you for the time that you have put in, the 11 attention that you have paid so far, and for the 12 work that you will do in deliberations. we 13 really do appreciate it. 14 now, if you will excuse me for a second, i 15 do need to grab one thing over here. 16 you will remember, during opening 17 statements, i told you that this case, when 18 you -- when you really strip it down, when you 19 look at it fundamentally, that it is about two 20 things: control and responsibility. 21 mr. moyer was the only person in control 22 of his smoking decisions. he was the person 23 who was in control of when he was going to try 24 to quit, how long he was going to try to quit, 25 the effort he was going to put into trying to 1 quit. 2 because he was the only person in control 3 of his smoking decisions -- and other decisions 4 in his life that he made, that came with 5 risk -- he is the one who is ultimately 6 responsible for the decisions that he made. 7 now, i think the evidence has shown that 8 his family understood that throughout the 9 entire time that he was smoking. they 10 respected his choices. 11 now, no doubt, they did not like his 12 smoking. they thought it smelled bad, they 13 thought it was disgusting, it stained the 14 walls. 15 but when it came down to asking him to 16 quit, helping him to quit, i think the evidence 17 was clear that they respected his decisions and 18 understood that it was his decision, and his 19 decision alone, to smoke, or to quit, or when 20 to quit. 21 now, mr. moyer was not a man who could be 22 forced to change course in his life. he made 23 decisions. he made decisions about a lot of 24 aspects of his life: whether to smoke, whether 25 to drink, whether to lose weight, take care of 1 himself, and in other aspects of his life. and 2 he understood that those choices came with 3 risks. health risks, other risks. 4 and we saw his perspective on risk, which 5 is understandable. there is a risk in 6 everything. you take the risk. 7 and i want to be clear here. i'm not 8 criticizing, and nobody from the defense is 9 criticizing, any of the decisions that 10 mr. moyer made throughout his entire life. 11 what we are saying is that he is one hundred percent 12 responsible for the decisions that he made. 13 now, i'm not going to repeat everything, 14 thankfully, everything that mr. boyce said, or 15 that ms. ruiz said. they spent a lot of time 16 talking to you, and so i do not want to go back 17 and replow that same ground. 18 although, i did want to show question 19 number 3, because this is important. this is a 20 key component to the class membership question. 21 let me get out of the way here. 22 and you really see this is a two-part 23 question. the first part is: was dale moyer 24 addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine? 25 was he addicted? that is the first 1 question. 2 and, on that, plaintiff's counsel is 3 right, there is no definition. there is no 4 definition in the jury instructions. that is up 5 to you. and we will respect your decision on 6 that. 7 where i want to focus on is the second 8 part, the second part of the question, which 9 is: if so, even if he was addicted, was his 10 addiction a legal cause of his smoking-related 11 illnesses? 12 and, again, the concept of legal cause is 13 not necessarily the same as medical cause. and 14 i used an example in opening statement of a 15 person who walks across the street and gets hit 16 by a truck. 17 well, spending a little more time, seeing 18 the water, seeing the beach, i have another 19 example to help illustrate legal cause and how 20 it is different from and can be different from 21 medical cause. 22 if somebody goes down to the beach, goes 23 down las olas boulevard, goes down to the 24 beach, and they decide to go swimming, and they 25 see that the red flag is up and they see that 1 there is surf, but they have gone into that surf 2 all their life, swam all the time, every day -- 3 first time they went in, they swam, they 4 did not get -- they did not get pulled out in a 5 rip current, they did not drown. they hear 6 about other people drowning, they hear about 7 people that go and get pulled out in rip tides, 8 but it is never happened to them. they do not 9 think it is going to happen to them; it happens 10 to other people. 11 and, so, time after time, they go in and 12 they swim, despite the red flag, despite the 13 current; and then, one time, an unfortunate 14 thing happens and it does happen to them. they 15 do get pulled out in the rip current and, 16 unfortunately, they drown and they die. 17 the medical cause -- the medical cause of 18 that person's death, no doubt, it is drowning; 19 but what is the legal cause? what is the legal 20 cause of that death? 21 the legal cause is going in the water to 22 swim. even if you do not think it is going to 23 happen to you, going in the water to swim, 24 despite the red flags, despite maybe people 25 telling you, hey, you should not go in the water 1 because there are rip currents. 2 not believing that it is going to happen 3 to you does not absolve you from the 4 consequences of the choices that you make. 5 and, again, i'm not going to go through 6 all the evidence on addiction, i'm not going to 7 go through all of the evidence on mr. moyer's 8 attempts to quit, what he said and -- what he 9 said about how hard he tried to quit, because 10 we all know that he did quit. he quit in 2000. 11 he quit in 2000, when, as he said, it hit the 12 fan for him. and, so, there is no doubt that he 13 could quit. there is no doubt that he could 14 quit when he was motivated. 15 and motivation comes from within. when 16 he was finally motivated, he quit smoking. he 17 quit smoking for good. he never relapsed, day 18 after day, week after week, month after month, 19 for 13 years. never smoked a single cigarette 20 again. 21 now, as you heard from dr. civantos, 22 that is important. and, interestingly, it was 23 actually in response to one of your own 24 questions. 25 when dr. civantos was asked: if he would 1 have quit, if mr. moyer would have quit in 1993 2 or 1994, when plaintiff's counsel said he was 3 first diagnosed with copd, could he have 4 avoided his injury? 5 and dr. civantos said: probably, yes, 6 things would have been different for mr. moyer 7 if he would have quit at that point. legal 8 cause. 9 now, i want to talk a little bit about 10 mr. moyer and his awareness of the health risks 11 of smoking. and it is clear that he was aware 12 of the health risks of smoking for a long, long 13 time; back into the 1950s, at least. 14 you know, when i first started off, i 15 thanked you. i also want to apologize. i've 16 been over there, coughing. since the first day 17 of trial, i've had a cold. and so if i've 18 annoyed you with my coughing, i apologize. 19 but, fortunately, the trial's about over. 20 but, anyway, here's why -- 21 and you have seen this -- and i'm not going 22 to belabor it, but you have seen why awareness is 23 important, because it comes down to the issue 24 of reasonable reliance. 25 and mr. boyce showed you the instruction 1 that -- and i will not show it to you again -- 2 but, in essence, it said: if you -- if you 3 know that smoking causes lung cancer, if you 4 believe that smoking causes lung cancer and 5 emphysema and disease, you cannot have relied on 6 any statement to the contrary. and that is -- 7 that, frankly, goes back to 1965. 8 mr. moyer said -- and this is -- 9 frankly, i put this up here because i 10 did not want there to be any concern whatsoever 11 that mr. boyce or any of us would somehow cut 12 off an answer or leave a misleading impression. 13 so i want to put up what -- what the entire 14 question and answer was, which i think 15 mr. boyce intended to read, but we have been 16 having technical difficulties all day. 17 but, again, here it is. you can see it. 18 at the time you saw edward r. murrow's 19 commercial, you believed it? 20 yeah. he had no reason to lie about it. 21 and, again, that was in 1965. so, as of 22 1965 -- 23 and you saw these questions. and there 24 are, i think, maybe four of them, on the 25 verdict form. they go to reasonable reliance. 1 and in order for the defense to be liable for 2 any alleged concealment, any conspiracy, 3 anything like that, mr. moyer has to have 4 relied on a statement by that defendant, for 5 that defendant to be liable, after 1982. 6 there are questions that relate to before 7 1982. i think, on the evidence, given what 8 mr. moyer believed himself in 1965, the answers 9 to all these questions about reasonable 10 reliance, whether before may 5, 1982, or after 11 may 5, 1982, it is all no. 12 but, again, i want to walk through 13 particularly -- 14 and for most -- for most of my time, i 15 want to focus on lorillard and what the 16 evidence was about lorillard, but -- 17 i want to talk about lorillard and the 18 evidence you saw; but, before i say that, i 19 want you to think about this: the -- 20 all of the documents that mr. schlesinger 21 went through in his closing argument, 22 everything that he flashed up, other than some 23 kent advertisements which i'll talk about in a 24 minute, everything that he flashed up was not a 25 lorillard document. 1 i think, with dr. proctor, i counted over 2 80 documents total that were used on direct 3 examination with mr. gdanski. of those, i 4 think i counted about five or so lorillard 5 documents. and we will talk about some of those 6 today. again, not including ads, but i'll get 7 to those in a second. 8 but, again, all of those documents, not 9 from lorillard. but i would submit to you, 10 even if you took all those documents -- 11 if you took every document -- company 12 document over here, you boxed it up, and if you 13 gave it to mr. moyer years and years ago, it 14 would not have made a difference to him in his 15 smoking decisions, because he knew smoking 16 could cause lung cancer, emphysema, other 17 diseases. and he knew it as far back as 1965, 18 so -- 19 and there is no surprise why. as you have 20 seen -- 21 rather than show you a bunch of them, i 22 wanted to do it this way; but you have seen, 23 there are -- 24 and they are all in evidence. you have 25 seen newspaper articles, magazine articles, on 1 the tv, the health risks of smoking were 2 something that were talked about in the '40s, 3 '50s, '60s, a long time ago. a long time ago. 4 now, mr. moyer said that he switched to 5 smoking -- or switched to kent, sorry, in 1955. 6 he smoked kent from 1955 to 1975. 7 i think mr. schlesinger said 25 years in 8 his closing, but i think he misspoke. twenty 9 years, 1955 to 1975. 10 so, you will remember the advertisements, 11 the kent advertisements that plaintiff's 12 counsel showed to dr. proctor. bob cousy -- 13 bob cousy was a great basketball player; 14 not so much of an actor. but you had bob 15 cousy, you had more scientists and educators 16 smoked kent; but what you also saw, on 17 cross-examination, those kent advertisements 18 ran in 1960, one year, 1960, five years 19 after -- five years after mr. moyer says that 20 he switched to kent. 21 so he did not rely on more scientists and 22 educators, or bob cousy, or those 23 advertisements in his decision to smoke kent. 24 and, again, 1960 is 22 years before -- 22 25 years before 1982. 1955, when he switched to 1 kent, 27 years before 1982. 2 and to be clear, in case there is any 3 doubt, mr. moyer said the last kent 4 advertisements that he -- that he recalls 5 seeing were from the 1950s and the 1960s, years 6 before that 1982 cutoff. 7 it is not even close on the issue of 8 reasonable reliance on a lorillard statement. 9 the connection between lorillard and mr. moyer 10 in this case is the kent brand of cigarettes. 11 the kent -- a brand that he stopped smoking in 12 1975. clearly, no reliance on anything 13 lorillard said after 1982. 14 now, i want to talk to you -- i want to 15 switch gears and i want to talk a little bit 16 about punitive damages and comparative fault, 17 because plaintiff's counsel spent, frankly, 18 more time talking about punitive damages than 19 they did talking about dale moyer. 20 you have seen the instructions on punitive 21 damages, and i'm not going to go over them with 22 you again; but, again, it is a higher burden of 23 proof on the plaintiff to prove punitive 24 damages. 25 you can only punish for harm to dale 1 moyer, not for any number of smokers out there. 2 it is harm to dale moyer. and the standard for 3 punitive damages has to be based on intentional 4 misconduct. intentional misconduct. 5 and you are instructed, i think, on 6 negligence, and those types of things. 7 negligence is like -- 8 and the judge has instructed you, but 9 negligence is like when you get in your car and 10 if you are texting or you are not paying 11 attention, or you are fiddling with the radio, 12 or you speed and you hit somebody. that is 13 negligence. 14 recklessness -- which is not even 15 enough -- recklessness would be if you got in 16 your car, drunk, and hit somebody -- 17 mr. hammer: objection. 18 mr. woods: -- and caused an injury. 19 the court: thank you. 20 ladies and gentlemen, this is just 21 argument. it is not an instruction on the law. 22 proceed. 23 mr. woods: thank you. 24 intentional misconduct would be driving 25 your car and intending to hit somebody. that is 1 not what we have here. 2 now, i want to walk through some of the 3 evidence about lorillard, i want to walk 4 through some of the evidence about lorillard's 5 effort in the past to understand what was in 6 cigarettes, to try to reduce the hazards of 7 cigarettes. and you saw this evidence when i 8 cross-examined dr. proctor. 9 but before i talk about that, i want to 10 talk a little bit about youth marketing. and, 11 again, documents that you may have seen, either 12 with dr. proctor or by mr. schlesinger in his 13 closing argument, none of those documents were 14 from lorillard. 15 frankly, you saw a lot of documents about 16 philip morris, who mr. moyer never smoked their 17 products. 18 and one piece of evidence you heard was 19 this idea of product placement, that philip 20 morris may have paid money to put marlboro in 21 the superman movie, so that if somebody was 22 watching superman, they would see marlboro in 23 the background. 24 well, what you heard from dr. proctor is 25 that lorillard not only did not do that, but 1 had a policy not to do that, at least as far 2 back as the 1970s, for at least 40 years, and 3 up through today, not to do product placement. 4 but i want to talk to you about 5 lorillard's efforts to try to understand what is 6 in cigarettes and to try to reduce the hazards 7 of cigarettes. 8 you heard a lot about dr. wynder. 9 dr. wynder -- wynder, graham, and croninger, 10 you remember they were the ones that did the 11 big mouse skin painting study back in 1953. 12 they were the ones who plaintiff's 13 counsel said caused all the companies to go to 14 the hotel and to have a big meeting to -- to 15 put out the frank statement. 16 but when dr. wynder, and graham, and 17 croninger did their study in 1953, the mouse 18 skin painting study, lorillard did not say, oh 19 my goodness, dr. wynder's come up -- he is going 20 to find out the truth. we have got to shut this 21 down. we cannot have him doing this. 22 no. what lorillard did was, they said, 23 he is doing good research. we are going to send 24 him cigarettes so that he can continue doing 25 his research. in fact, we are going to work 1 with him for the next 15 or so years, looking 2 at things like phenols. 3 you remember the phenols. those were 4 the -- that was the compound in cigarette smoke 5 that scientists thought might interfere with 6 the clearance mechanisms to get -- help get the 7 tar and the gunk out of the lungs after you 8 smoke. 9 lorillard was doing that research, doing 10 it with dr. wynder, who you remember 11 dr. proctor called a giant, a big deal, a huge 12 scientist at the time. also dr. hoffmann, who 13 was one of -- a public health scientist who was 14 an expert on cigarette design and cigarette 15 chemistry. 16 lorillard actually patented filters to 17 remove phenols from cigarette smoke, put them 18 on its brands, actually published the results 19 of its research on phenols. and you may recall 20 during the cross -- or the redirect 21 examination -- 22 i think you have seen that where -- when 23 the plaintiff calls a witness -- 24 because they have the burden of proof, 25 they go first. then we go, and then they get 1 the last word. and, frankly, we cannot respond. 2 and it will happen again today. and 3 that is the way the rules are, and that is fine. 4 but understand that when mr. schlesinger gets 5 up, there is no way for us to stand up and rebut 6 anything that he says. 7 it is the same way with witnesses. it was 8 the same way with dr. proctor. and, so, after 9 i was done, i sat down. mr. gdanski, at the 10 very end of his redirect examination of 11 dr. proctor, he showed a document that 12 suggested that dr. spears of lorillard was told 13 by his boss, you cannot publish your phenols 14 research. 15 and you may recall, i jumped up and said, 16 judge, one question, just one question on 17 recross. 18 dr. proctor knew exactly where i was 19 going, because -- 20 mr. hammer: objection, judge. 21 the court: sustained. 22 mr. woods: -- we had actually 23 discussed -- 24 we had actually discussed the publication 25 of the phenols, the same one at issue in that 1 document, during the -- during my 2 cross-examination of dr. proctor. it was the 3 quantitative determination of phenols in 4 cigarette smoke. 5 dr. proctor said, without me having to 6 stand up, yes, that was actually published. 7 and, so, lorillard published its research 8 on phenols. it continued its work with wynder 9 and hoffmann for years. 10 you heard about liggett's submission to 11 the surgeon general's advisory committee. you 12 also saw, with dr. proctor, lorillard had a 13 submission to the surgeon general's advisory 14 committee, identified various compounds in 15 smoke. among them, benzo(a)pyrene, which 16 lorillard identified as a potential carcinogen, 17 as well as phenols. 18 lorillard gave its research on phenols to 19 the surgeon general's advisory committee, and 20 the surgeon general's advisory committee also 21 thanked lorillard. 22 lorillard's research continued. you 23 remember the research on pmo -- i think it is 24 phenylmethyl oxidase, pmo -- that lorillard was 25 looking into as a potential way to counteract 1 the effect of phenols again. they actually 2 made a presentation to the national cancer 3 institute on that. 4 lorillard developed a highly 5 sophisticated smoking machine to help 6 scientists do research on smoking and cancer, 7 to better do animal research. to better do 8 animal research. they made this machine 9 available to other researchers and to other 10 labs. 11 now, you saw a bunch of documents with 12 dr. proctor, and you saw a bunch of documents 13 in mr. schlesinger's closing argument, that 14 talked about nicotine. people smoke for 15 nicotine. you know, addiction, sine qua non, 16 all those documents. 17 well, first of all, of the documents that 18 you saw with dr. proctor on nicotine and 19 addiction, and that type of thing, i think 20 there were two lorillard documents, which i'm 21 going to talk about. during -- 22 all of the documents that you saw with 23 mr. schlesinger during closing argument, none 24 of those were lorillard documents. 25 like i said when i stood up in opening 1 statement, i'm not going to try to defend 2 what -- what every -- what people may have said 3 in documents years ago. 4 some of them may be taken out of context; 5 other of them may be just stupid things that 6 people said. but the key is, the plaintiff has 7 to connect that to mr. moyer, and he just 8 simply has not done it. so -- 9 but in terms of lorillard and lorillard's 10 nicotine research, when you look into the 11 evidence, you will see no documents -- you will see 12 no documents from lorillard, saying, we think 13 smoking is addictive, we are trying to 14 manipulate nicotine to addict smokers. you 15 will not see it. 16 what you will see is, you will see 17 documents like this: lorillard's nicotine 18 augmentation project. 19 now, you see something like "nicotine 20 augmentation project," and you think, that 21 does not sound good. that sounds like lorillard 22 is manipulating nicotine in an effort to hook 23 smokers. 24 as you heard from dr. proctor on the 25 stand during my cross-examination, that is 1 what -- not what this was about at all. that 2 was about recommendations from health-oriented 3 agencies. 4 you remember, it was a -- the idea of the 5 low tar, medium nicotine, that people were 6 smoking lower and lower tar and nicotine 7 products. and the thought was, well, if 8 they are smoking for nicotine, if they are 9 compensating and smoking more to get more 10 nicotine, then why do not we try to have a 11 lower-tar cigarette, but raise the level of 12 nicotine so that people will not compensate, so 13 that they will not smoke more, so that they will not 14 get more of the tar; because, again, the tar is 15 the bad stuff. the tar is what causes cancer, 16 what causes disease. nicotine does not cause 17 cancer. just -- just inhaling nicotine does 18 not cause cancer. 19 so, again, the idea behind this nicotine 20 augmentation project was not an effort to hook 21 smokers or addict smokers; it was trying to be 22 responsive to what the public health community 23 was telling lorillard and the other companies 24 to do: try out this idea of a low-tar, 25 medium-nicotine cigarette. 1 and, again, it was not just lorillard's 2 idea. sir richard doll -- the "sir" in front 3 of his name, he was actually knighted -- he 4 was -- he was involved in some of the earliest 5 statistical epidemiological research on smoking 6 and lung cancer back in the day, back in the 7 1950s. and he continued his research for 8 years. he was actually knighted for that. he 9 thought the idea of low-tar, medium-nicotine 10 cigarettes were a good idea. 11 dr. russell, i spoke about him with 12 dr. proctor. he was an expert in nicotine, a 13 pharmacologist. he also thought this idea had 14 potential, was a good idea. consumer 15 reports -- 16 it was not just the scientists who were 17 talking about these issues; it was also in the 18 public arena, whether this was a good idea, 19 whether this could be a way to help reduce the 20 health risks of smoking. 21 the 1981 surgeon general's report, as 22 well, also talked about the potential for 23 low-tar, medium-nicotine cigarettes. 24 now, plaintiff's counsel talked to you 25 about the fact that the companies control the 1 amount of nicotine in cigarettes. and that is 2 true. there is no doubt about that, and there is 3 no secret to that. 4 anybody who is ever been a smoker knows 5 that some cigarettes, unfiltered cigarettes, 6 for example, higher tar and nicotine, have a -- 7 they are much stronger than maybe a light 8 cigarette or something that has very little tar 9 and nicotine. 10 the companies, if you have a light, you 11 always want it to be light. if you have a 12 full-flavored, or an unfiltered, you always 13 want it to taste like a full-flavored or an 14 unfiltered. 15 if you were selling kent, like lorillard, 16 you would want to make sure that every pack of 17 kent had about the same amount of tar and about 18 the same amount of nicotine. 19 now, kent, you have different levels, you 20 have higher-tar and lower-tar kents; but if 21 you are smoking kent, you do not want to go to 22 your kents one day and find one pack is super 23 strong and your next pack is super weak. you 24 want product consistency. 25 the tobacco companies make sure that they 1 have a consistent amount of tar and nicotine in 2 every cigarette, in the same way that 3 starbuck's makes sure that it blends its beans 4 to have the same amount, roughly, of caffeine, 5 or the same strength. 6 likewise, with the coca-cola company, 7 when they put together coca-cola, same amount 8 of caffeine, same amount of sugar in every 9 bottle. it is a matter of product consistency. 10 for years, the amount of tar and nicotine 11 were measured by -- by the ftc; and, so, 12 whatever amounts of tar were in there, and 13 whatever amounts of nicotine were in there, 14 were reported for years. 15 so this idea that the companies 16 super-engineered cigarettes to make them, i 17 think, what dr. proctor calls one of the most 18 highly engineered small products in history, i 19 just have one word to say about that: iphone. 20 a cigarette compared to an iphone. it is not 21 even close. 22 but i digress. i want to move on -- 23 now, when you get to issues of 24 comparative fault -- the same things i've been 25 talking about, when you get to the issues of 1 comparative fault, think about that. think 2 about the lack of evidence against lorillard in 3 this case. think about dr. wynder. think 4 about nap. think about the research that 5 lorillard was doing. 6 if you get there -- and i do not think you 7 should get there, and i do not think you will 8 get there -- but if you do get there, think 9 about that when you are thinking about a number 10 to put down for lorillard. 11 and i think, as mr. boyce said, the 12 amount that needs to go for the plaintiff, 13 there needs to be something there. there 14 does not need to be any other number for any of 15 the defendants, because mr. moyer, while he was 16 alive, admitted that he was partially 17 responsible for his health-related problems. 18 the last thing i want to talk to you 19 about is damages. mr. boyce, i thought, did a 20 good job of walking through the medical issues 21 in the case. i do not want to -- 22 i do not want to repeat any of that, but i 23 did want to say this: when you retire back to 24 the jury room, i do not think you will get to 25 damages, but i'm not doing my job if i do not 1 talk about it. if you get back there, i would 2 suggest to you, based on this record, based on 3 mr. moyer's other health problems, i would 4 suggest -- 5 plaintiff's counsel, i think, asked for 6 $7.5 million and $10 million. i would suggest 7 to you that an appropriate number in this case 8 would be not in the millions, it would be in 9 the thousands side. and, so, that is within 10 your discretion, and i am -- 11 before somebody stands up and accuses me 12 of saying that these three ladies did not love 13 their father, that is not what i'm saying at 14 all. please understand, that is not what i'm 15 saying at all. but i'm just trying to give you 16 a perspective on damages for -- if you get 17 there back in the jury room. 18 again, it is been -- it is been a long 19 time, and so i really appreciate the time that 20 you have -- that you have spent. i appreciate the 21 attention you have given to all of us. i know we 22 appreciate that. 23 when it comes down to it, though, the 24 case really is about mr. moyer and the fact 25 that he was in control of his decisions, the 1 fact that he was in control of his decisions 2 whether to try to quit and how hard to try to 3 quit. 4 he quit for good in 2000. if he would 5 have quit 10 years earlier, six years earlier, 6 from what dr. civantos said, things would have 7 been different. legal cause. 8 so, again, thank you so much for your 9 time. mr. schlesinger is going to get up next. 10 i think yesterday he talked about unleashing 11 the demon, unleashing the demon of nicotine. 12 and, so, when he unleashes the demon 13 against the defense, just think to 14 yourselves -- because we cannot respond -- what 15 would the defense say? what would the defense 16 say to that? 17 and so, again, thank you very much. 18 that is all i have. 19 the court: counsel, thank you. ladies 20 and gentlemen of the jury, we have the rebuttal 21 argument to continue with. i know it is about 22 our lunchtime. i would like to, if it is all 23 right -- 24 i do not know if any of you are -- feel 25 famished and you need to take a break. if you 1 do, we will break. otherwise, i would like to 2 just finish it. 3 mr. schlesinger is going to go on for 4 about a half hour. is it all right if we 5 continue? 6 yes? yes? 7 all right. counsel, thank you.
