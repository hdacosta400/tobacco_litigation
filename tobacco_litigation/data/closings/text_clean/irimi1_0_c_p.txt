9 mr. hammer: thank you, judge. may it 10 please the court. 11 good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 12 jurors: good afternoon. 13 mr. hammer: it is been a long road to get 14 here, and it is been a long time since dale 15 first felt that first shortness of breath when 16 he was up there in north carolina. 17 he climbed that hill in north carolina, 18 felt shortness of breath, came home, went to 19 his doctor, dr. mascarenhas. we heard from 20 him, read from his deposition. 21 and dr. mascarenhas, along with several 22 other doctors, determined that dale had copd 23 and determined that dale had copd caused from 24 his smoking. 25 for the doctors, you saw them testify, 1 all the doctors, all the records reflect, there 2 was really a no-brainer for the doctors. he 3 had copd, it was caused by his smoking. 4 all the doctors that testified in this 5 case all determined that he was addicted, too. 6 it was really a no-brainer for them. 7 well, back 20 years ago, dale had a 8 smoking-related disease, he was a smoker for a 9 long period of time. and by virtue of those 10 facts alone, he was basically considered part 11 of the engle class. 12 mr. boyce: objection. 13 the court: excuse me. 14 again, ladies and gentlemen, this is 15 closing argument. this is plaintiff's 16 counsel's take on the evidence. 17 thank you. 18 objection noted. overruled. 19 mr. hammer: thank you, judge. 20 as the engle case wound its way through 21 the courts, it was tried and went up to the 22 supreme court. you heard the judge describe 23 that. 24 the supreme court said: we are going to 25 keep the findings. you guys have all heard the 1 findings, and we are going to talk a lot about 2 the findings. 3 the individual smokers that are part of 4 the class get to file their own individual 5 suits. so dale moyer did that. he followed 6 the instructions of the supreme court, and here 7 we are. his own individual suit. 8 now, dale was hoping to be around long 9 enough to meet the jury that was going to hear 10 his case. we were fortunate enough to hear 11 from dale. you heard his testimony. it was 12 played over the course of several hours, and 13 i'm going to talk about that a lot. but, 14 unfortunately, dale did not make it. 15 so instead, his daughters heather and 16 lisa and dawn, they are here, they took over his 17 case, and they proudly stand before you, as do 18 their lawyers, and we are making this argument 19 to you. 20 now, dale basically waited 20 years to 21 get into this class. 1994 is when he was 22 diagnosed. 23 now it is your opportunity to put him 24 where he belongs. that is all we are asking you 25 to do. 1 there are a couple simple questions that 2 are going to be asked with regard to that, and 3 that is, as the judge read to you: was smoking 4 cigarettes a legal cause of dale moyer's heart 5 disease? 6 did dale moyer's copd or emphysema first 7 manifest on or before november 21, 1996? 8 and was dale moyer addicted to cigarettes 9 containing nicotine? 10 and if so, was such addiction a legal 11 cause of his copd or emphysema or heart 12 disease? 13 now, dale smoked cigarettes for a long 14 time. started out smoking these, lucky 15 strikes. 16 and he developed disease as a result. 17 now, these cigarettes, unfiltered, as were the 18 old gold, as were the chesterfield that he 19 smoked. 20 he smoked those for the first parts of 21 his life. started smoking when he was nine 22 years old. nine years old. 23 now, i'm going to talk to you for a 24 little while about what the evidence showed, 25 and then scott schlesinger is going to stand up 1 and talk to you a lot about some of the conduct 2 that the tobacco companies displayed in this 3 case. 4 but i want to focus on dale. 5 there is been a lot of talk in this case 6 about choice, a lot of talk about fault, a lot 7 of talk about failures to quit, a lot of talk 8 about the ability to quit. 9 but those are not really questions that 10 go to addiction. those are questions that 11 might go to the level of addiction. 12 but the question of whether or not dale 13 was addicted, that is a pretty basic question. 14 and a lot of us, there is not going to be -- and 15 you heard -- the judge gave you all the 16 instructions, and you have got the packet there. 17 you can look through that. i think there is 32 18 pages. 19 you are not going to see one definition of 20 addiction. so addiction is what you all say it 21 is. 22 now, you have heard dr. seidman. we 23 brought in dr. seidman, he is an addiction 24 specialist. works up there in columbia, 25 teaches about addiction, teaches all the 1 doctors, he is an expert. 2 and he told you that based on his 3 analysis of the evidence in this case, based 4 upon his review of the documents in the case, 5 based upon his conversation with dale -- he got 6 an opportunity to speak to dale -- he 7 determined that dale was one of the most severe 8 nicotine addicts he is ever dealt with. 9 and that is what is in these packages. 10 nicotine. 11 now, nicotine, as you learn, it naturally 12 occurs in the tobacco plant. but the problem 13 is, the plant itself contains a certain amount 14 of nicotine, but the problem is that the 15 tobacco companies, they control the amount of 16 nicotine that goes in each one of these things. 17 and that is what is important. because 18 what they do is they control it to such an 19 extent that it keeps smokers addicted. gets 20 them addicted and keeps them addicted. 21 now, dale started smoking at nine years 22 old. remember the story he told? it was in 23 his deposition how when he was nine, he and a 24 group of friends snuck a couple of lucky 25 strikes from his friend's dad's cigarette 1 stash, ran out to this makeshift fort. it is 2 ironic, their makeshift fort was a coffin crate 3 that they built the fort up. 4 and that is, unfortunately, where dale 5 ended up as a result of that first cigarette. 6 it led him on the path of addiction. 7 that is what these defendant companies count on. 8 they count on people like dale, nine years old, 9 trying their first cigarette. 10 some people try it, they do not like it. 11 some people cough, they say oh, that stuff is 12 disgusting, i never want to do it again, but 13 some people continue doing it. 14 there is all sorts of reasons why people 15 smoke, initially at least. they want to fit 16 if, it is peer pressure. it is cool. the ads 17 make it look cool. at least they did back 18 then. the movie stars, sports stars. you have 19 seen the ads. 20 you will see a lot during your closing 21 argument. they make it look great. they make 22 it look fun. alive with pleasure, lots of fun. 23 there is nothing pleasurable about what 24 dale experienced at the end of his life as a 25 result of these things, and that is the harsh 1 reality of the cigarette. 2 it kills people. it is a product, it is a 3 legal product, but it kills people, and they 4 know it. and they have known it for a long time. 5 and that is the problem here. and that is why 6 we are here before you. 7 now, like i said, people smoke for 8 enjoyment, a whole lot of reasons. but they 9 put the nicotine in here for one reason and one 10 reason only. it is to keep people hooked. 11 now, the choice of these defendants to 12 market tobacco known to be both addictive and 13 cancer causing -- we know that now. we did not 14 know it back in the '30s and '40s. dale sure 15 did not know it as a nine-year-old boy. 16 it raises the question of fault. which 17 there is a section on the verdict form where you 18 determine the percentages of fault. 19 but, when it comes to that question -- 20 and mr. schlesinger is going to address a lot 21 about that, he will go into great detail about 22 the fault of the tobacco companies. 23 but right now, you want to talk more 24 about dale. the choice of a child like dale to 25 start smoking these things, to try it and 1 become a regular smoker, buying packs of 2 cigarettes by age 14, that should not be 3 considered by you as far as fault, but why he 4 started smoking in the first place. because of 5 what was out there. 6 but why are not i talking about choices? 7 the choice he made when he was 14 to buy his 8 first pack. it is because the tobacco companies 9 want to pretend that dale was not addicted. 10 they want to pretend he was not addicted at all; 11 that his choices is what drove him. 12 if he was addicted, it was his choice to 13 continue to smoke long enough to get sick. 14 that is what they want to argue to you. but 15 that is ridiculous. 16 there was not one piece of evidence that 17 was presented to you by either side that dale 18 moyer's addiction was his choice. nobody 19 chooses addiction. quite simply, nobody 20 chooses addiction. nobody wants to be 21 addicted. 22 it is often a terrible side effect of the 23 choice to smoke. and just like the addiction 24 some people get from prescription pain 25 relievers, medicine, they get addicted. 1 but it frequently happens as an 2 unintended consequence of the use of the drug, 3 and the drug in this case is nicotine. 4 lawful but dangerous drugs can have awful 5 side effects, side effects like addiction. and 6 that is why people say, if you are taking that 7 medication, if you are smoking, be careful, you 8 might get hooked. 9 why do people say that? because 10 addiction is just exactly that. it is like a 11 fish getting hooked. the fish chooses to 12 strike the bait. and then gets caught by the 13 hidden hook. the hook starts to pull the fish 14 along. the fish starts fighting the hook and 15 tries to get off. 16 some fish that were only, say, hooked 17 through the lip, they wiggle their way out of 18 the hook. they are fortunate. 19 but the ones that are hooked all the way 20 through, those fish are goners. that is what 21 it is all about. fishermen know that. that is 22 why they use the hook. that is why they use the 23 bait. it covers the hook. 24 that is exactly what the tobacco companies 25 did. no fisherman would ever say that the fish 1 was caught because the fish chose to get 2 hooked. of course not. the fish died because 3 they did not see the hook in the first place. 4 and dale moyer at nine years old and 14 5 and all those years, he did not see the hook. 6 dale was diagnosed with copd, as i said, 7 in 1994, and he died a horrible death at age 8 84. march 7th, 2013. 9 and it was not until six years after dale 10 was diagnosed with copd, in 2000s, that the 11 tobacco companies finally acknowledged, by 12 virtue of putting it up on their website, that 13 cigarettes are addictive and it causes disease. 14 that was their first true acknowledgment. 15 certainly it was on the packs. but you 16 know what? there was never a warning about 17 addiction on any of the cigarette packs that 18 dale moyer smoked. never. 19 and there was not a warning about it being 20 harmful until 1966. and that was not even a 21 warning, that was a caution. 22 remember, we saw the different warnings 23 over the years. caution: cigarettes may be 24 hazardous to your health. 25 by that time dale was 37 years old, he 1 was already hooked. he was already gone. he 2 was already addicted. 3 but the interesting thing is, he did try 4 to get away many times over the years. and you 5 heard about that. but he was hooked. and it 6 eventually killed him. 7 and that is the sad thing about this. 8 now, the tobacco companies, they want to tell 9 you that being hooked had nothing to do with 10 dale's death, had nothing to do with his 11 disease, nothing at all. that is absurd. 12 that is crazy. 13 dale moyer chose to start smoking 14 cigarettes at nine years old. that was his 15 choice. a fatal choice in the end. 16 but you know what? nobody thinks when 17 they first try a cigarette when they are a kid, 18 nine, nine years old, ten years old, whatever 19 it may be, that they are going to be smoking for 20 the next 30, 40, 50, 60 years of their life. 21 everybody thinks it is no big deal, i'll put it 22 down when i want. 23 some people cannot do that. dale 24 could not, and we heard how many times he tried. 25 you know, maybe you think dale should 1 have tried harder. maybe. but you heard how 2 many times he tried. but that goes to fault. 3 not to addiction. 4 so the first question in this case, the 5 threshold question we talked about, talks about 6 was smoking cigarettes a legal cause of dale 7 moyer's heart disease? 8 we heard doctors talk about the heart 9 disease. it is really a no-brainer. cigarette 10 is the number one cause of heart disease in 11 this country. and dale had it. 12 did dale's copd or emphysema manifest 13 itself before november 1996? well, of course. 14 it manifested itself when he was walking up 15 that hill and became short of breath. 16 so those questions should easily be 17 answered by you. 18 and was dale addicted to the cigarettes 19 containing nicotine? and if so, was such 20 addiction a legal cause of his copd or heart 21 disease? yeah. 22 and those questions themselves are 23 answered yes, and they put him as a class 24 member, which is where he belongs. it is as 25 simple as that. 1 let us go to slide 149, please. 2 this is the question you are going to be 3 asked on the verdict form. and it should 4 absolutely be checked off yes. 5 you are going to get a verdict form in 6 this case, and that is the main question: is 7 dale moyer a class member? absolutely. 8 and we have to prove that to you by a 9 greater weight of the evidence. 10 slide 3, please. 11 so we start out even. we start out 12 balanced. and then civil case law says we have 13 to prove it by the greater weight of the 14 evidence. we have to tip the scales. 15 now, in this case we believe we have 16 presented evidence of addiction, evidence of 17 cause of death, evidence of his disease, 18 evidence of his heart disease, copd, the 19 emphysema, his cancer, linking all of it to 20 smoking cigarettes. 21 we believe we have presented evidence that 22 tips these scales quite a bit. but really all 23 we need to do is tip it ever so slightly. 24 51 percent. 25 mr. boyce: objection, your honor, 1 misstates the burden of proof. 2 the court: objection noted. overruled. 3 this is just argument. the instructions 4 on the law that i gave you are controlling. 5 this is counsel's thoughts and comments about 6 it to persuade you to reach a verdict in this 7 case. 8 proceed. 9 mr. hammer: thank you, judge. 10 now, in a case like this, you are the 11 jurors of the facts. and we do not know what 12 you need to hear from us. we present the 13 evidence as much as we possibly can and hope 14 that we give you enough evidence to convince 15 you. 16 and so we do not know how much to give 17 you, how little to give you, and we present a 18 lot of evidence. 19 slide number 4, please. 20 there is some facts that are undisputed in 21 this case, and the judge read them to you, and 22 clearly a lot of this evidence we presented 23 might have been repetitious, and we apologize 24 for that. 25 a lot of the evidence you say, well, we 1 already heard that, why are we hearing this 2 again. and again i say, because we do not know 3 what you were expecting to hear from us. 4 we want to make sure we give you all the 5 evidence you need to make a proper decision in 6 this case, and i apologize to you if we did get 7 repetitive. 8 now, in the next hour or so, scott and i, 9 we are going to go through the evidence, but 10 before i do that, i want to -- i actually want 11 to talk about a very important legal principle, 12 and that is addiction as a legal cause. 13 because the judge read to you that, and it is in 14 your packet quite a bit. 15 you know, generally, as i said, you get a 16 definition of everything, but you do not get a 17 definition of addiction. so you all use your 18 judgment about what addiction is and whether or 19 not dale moyer was addicted to the nicotine in 20 cigarettes. it really should be a no-brainer, 21 and all the witnesses say he was. 22 and if you think about -- if you think, 23 you know somebody that smokes a pack or two or 24 three packs of cigarettes a day for 60 years, 25 if you think that in and of itself is enough 1 for addiction and that meets your definition, 2 that is enough. 3 if you think you need more, that is fine 4 too. 5 but, you know, a person does not smoke 6 three packs a day for 60 years because they 7 like the taste. they do not smoke three packs a 8 day because they want to hang out with their 9 friends smoking. they smoke three packs a day 10 because they are addicted to the nicotine. they 11 need the nicotine. 12 and you heard how dale described how 13 much he needed it. 14 slide 16, please. 15 slide 16 talks about addiction being a 16 legal cause of injury if it directly in a 17 natural and continuous sequence produces or 18 contributes substantially to produce the injury 19 so that it can reasonably be said that but for 20 the addiction to the cigarettes containing that 21 nicotine, the injury would not have occurred. 22 so what that is saying is, did the 23 addiction, his continued smoking, his 24 dependence on the nicotine, did it contribute 25 substantially to producing his injuries? 1 of course it did. that is a question 2 you will have to answer, but i think we presented 3 enough evidence for you to answer yes. 4 and you are also told in the packet, it 5 talks about in order for it to be regarded as a 6 legal cause of injury, addiction need not be 7 the only cause. 8 and so we -- i do not want you to get 9 confused that -- when we talk about cause of 10 injury, it could be in combination with other 11 things, and that is what is explained to you in 12 the packet. it is a legal cause. one of the 13 causes. 14 and so you are given an instruction also 15 on intervening cause. and i would ask you to 16 go back there in the jury room, look at those 17 instructions, because it is important. because 18 it says it may also be a legal cause of heart 19 disease or copd or emphysema or cancer, even 20 though it operates in combination with some 21 other natural cause or some other cause 22 occurring after the addiction to the cigarettes 23 containing nicotine in combination with it. 24 and contributes substantially. 25 that means did the addiction to nicotine 1 play an important role. that is really what 2 that means. 3 did it play an important role in 4 contributing to him getting those diseases? 5 of course. of course it did. because 6 that is what caused him to continue smoking. if 7 he was not addicted, he would not have continued 8 to smoke those cigarettes. 9 those cigarettes contained the toxins, 10 bathed his lungs every day, caused lung damage, 11 copd and emphysema, caused lung cancer, and 12 caused heart disease. and also, we allege, 13 parotid cancer. 14 now, addiction must be a factor that 15 comes into play. his choices to smoke, and 16 maybe you think, you know, well, part of it was 17 his choice. and that is fine. 18 but part of it was his addiction that 19 drove him to smoke. part of it might have been 20 his failure to quit, had he quit earlier. but 21 part of it also was driving his addiction. 22 so it could be part and parcel of why he 23 continued to smoke. but addiction certainly 24 was the substantial reason why he continued. 25 and that is what the legal cause means. 1 it can get confusing, because it is a bunch of 2 pages in there. a bunch of legal mumbo jumbo. 3 it gets confusing. 4 in fact, there is one paragraph that is 5 about 12 lines long, and it does not even have a 6 period. it is all run-on sentence, and a 7 grammar teacher would probably give us an f for 8 that. the fact of the matter is, it does get 9 confusing. but i'm trying to simplify it for 10 you. 11 the question is, as we have down there: 12 if he was not addicted to nicotine, would he 13 have smoked two or three packs a day every day 14 for 60 years? 15 that is where you have to use your common 16 sense. the common sense would tell you that it 17 was the nicotine that drove him to do that. 18 there might have been other things too, but it 19 was definitely the nicotine that was a 20 substantial factor. 21 now, i want to talk a little bit about 22 dale. and as i said, scott is going to talk 23 about the tobacco companies and their conduct. 24 i want to talk about dale. because this 25 case is about dale moyer and his family, and 1 what he meant to them. 2 i want to put up photo number 102, 3 please. 4 you know, we all heard how much dale 5 loved life. the guy, he was always the ball of 6 fire at the parties, at the family gatherings, 7 at the occasions. they loved him down at the 8 merchandise mart. 9 this is dale when he was just a little 10 kid. he was born in 1929, he grew up in 11 pennsylvania. his father was a minister. and 12 through his dad, through that family 13 background, he instilled a lot of values in 14 dale. and dale instilled those values in dawn 15 and lisa and heather. you know? 16 that is important. that is an important 17 consideration. we are going to be asking you to 18 give us money for their pain and suffering. 19 for dale's pain and suffering. 20 number 104. 21 here is a picture of dale right about the 22 time -- he was probably about six or seven, 23 eight. just shortly after this, he tried his 24 first cigarette. nine years old. 25 number 112. 1 and we heard from dale that he loved 2 music, he loved to sing. he was in the 3 barbershop quartet. we saw this picture 4 already. 5 remember dale talked about in his 6 deposition that was played for you all, he 7 talked about listening to the radio, watching 8 tv, listening to the music shows. he talked 9 about watching bandstand. 10 it was actually called the lucky strike 11 hit parade, sponsored by lucky strike 12 cigarettes. as were all the tv shows back 13 then. 14 we saw some of them. even the 15 flintstones, the tv cartoon sponsored by 16 winston. 17 so it should not surprise you to learn 18 that when dale is listening to lucky strike and 19 he tries his first lucky strike, he continues 20 to smoke lucky strike, along with old gold and 21 chesterfield. 22 but he smokes lucky strike. why? it was 23 the popular cigarette. it was what he listened 24 to on the radio, lucky strike hit parade, and 25 it kept him going with the nicotine. 1 and he also smoked the old gold, and he 2 also smoked -- excuse me, the chesterfields. 3 remember we heard about the fact that he 4 joined the army. 5 let us look at photo -- actually, before 6 we go there, let us go to photo 016, please. 7 he loved -- i'm sorry, not that one. 8 take that down. go to 107. i apologize. 9 he joined the army, and he became a 10 paratrooper. army airborne. that is the elite 11 of the army, so they say. i do not want to 12 offend anybody that might be part of the other 13 branch. but army airborne is the elite. he 14 joined it, he volunteered for it. he joked 15 around, yeah, they paid more money. 16 but, you know, he joined it. he 17 volunteered for it. and he was proud of that. 18 he was proud of that. and well he should be. 19 and while he was in the army, he got 20 hurt. and he told the story that while he was 21 in the hospital laid up for three months, they 22 were handing out free cigarettes. 23 chesterfield, a liggett product. lucky strike, 24 an r.j. reynolds product. and old gold, a 25 lorillard product. 1 and that is what he basically started 2 smoking on. an r.j. reynolds product. lucky 3 strike, old gold, and chesterfield. and that is 4 what created that addiction. those cigarettes 5 together. 6 one cigarette after the other, until 7 eventually he started smoking packs, buying 8 packs at age 14, in the army, smoking a pack or 9 two a day. and he was getting them for free. 10 that is what created that addiction. 11 and so r.j. reynolds from lucky strike, 12 liggett for chesterfield, and lorillard for old 13 gold, they all helped create that addiction in 14 dale moyer. and they are all to blame for that. 15 go to photo number 68, please. 068. 16 he got married to corinne, we heard about 17 that. we heard about his wife. and shortly 18 after, a few years after they got married in 19 1955, she got polio. she had a child dane, who 20 has now since passed away, and they had three 21 beautiful daughters that you all heard and got 22 to meet. and heard about their life and how 23 dale affected their life. 24 but they learned from dale to put family 25 first. that is what he always did. it is 1 important to him. and it is been important to 2 these girls. that is what he instilled in these 3 girls. 4 you heard about how their family was 5 important to them. you heard about how 6 important all the events were for dale. 7 photo 061, please. 8 went to their softball games. you heard 9 about how he went to all their softball games. 10 he was smoking all the time. 11 photo 045 and 047, 115, and 116. 12 birthday parties, so important to the 13 family. they always got together. and going 14 to church together. always important to them. 15 and they went every sunday. 16 family was so important to dale moyer. 17 and yet, he left his wife after a while for a 18 number of years, and we heard about the fact 19 that he had a relationship with irma and with 20 loretta. 21 but he never actually left his family. 22 he left the house, but never left his family. 23 and that is important. because these girls were 24 his world, heather, dawn and lisa. they were 25 his world. 1 and he made it a point to come home, go 2 to church with them on sundays. he made it a 3 point to come home for their birthday parties. 4 he made it a point to remain a family. even 5 though he was not living in the family home. 6 that is pretty unique. that is an 7 impressive type of guy. 8 that shows how important family was to 9 him. and it shows how important these girls 10 were. 11 so he switched -- and he started 12 smoking -- he smoked those brands, and then he 13 switched to kents because he believed what the 14 tobacco companies said, that they were safer. 15 and he smoked those for 20 years until he 16 switched to salem menthols and then salem 17 lights. based upon the health assurances by 18 these tobacco companies. 19 and it only -- slide number 2, please. 20 these are the brands he smoked. and 21 you will see r.j. reynolds makes lucky strike. 22 liggett makes chesterfield. lorillard, old 23 gold. lorillard made kent. 24 he switched to kent and then switched to 25 salems in the later years, r.j. reynolds 1 products. 2 and you heard it from dale's mouth about 3 how addicted he was. 4 number 21. 5 6 7 follows:) 8 q. was there ever a point in time as you sit 9 here today that you recall that you actually did enjoy 10 smoking? 11 a. it is a really hard line between, you 12 know, enjoy, and i came to realize that i had to 13 smoke. i mean, that is -- i wanted to quit. there was 14 a hassle. it was expensive, it was dirty, it was a 15 filthy habit, and all my family did not like it, and i 16 did not like it, and i wanted very much to quit. but i 17 was smoking because i was addicted to cigarettes. 18 (video clip concluded.) 19 mr. hammer: put up slide number 20, 20 please. 21 and we heard the evidence in the case. 22 he chain smoked. he smoked first thing in the 23 morning, last thing before bed. he burnt the 24 couches and sofas with cigarette ashes. he 25 smoked after he was diagnosed with the various 1 diseases. he was never without a cigarette. 2 when he was, he was nervous, he was 3 agitated. he was uptight, angry, edgy; all 4 withdrawal symptoms. 5 and we heard -- number 22, please -- all 6 the evidence in the case, all the witnesses. 7 every single witness that was actually called 8 and even the witnesses that the defense called. 9 larry moyer, his brother, and loretta hedberg, 10 which they read their depositions in. they all 11 said he was addicted. 12 and what did we hear from the defense? 13 absolutely nothing. they did not present any 14 evidence to the contrary. dale moyer was 15 absolutely addicted to the nicotine in 16 cigarettes. no question about it. 17 and you heard that he tried to quit many 18 times. 19 let us do slide 19, please. 20 he tried all sorts of things: patches, 21 nicorette gum, habitrol, hypnosis, cutting 22 down, throwing away cigarettes, lighters, his 23 ashtrays. throwing them out the car window. 24 and he finally quit with zyban, a 25 prescription drug. thank goodness. he needed 1 zyban to quit. thank goodness that came 2 around. 3 and the two witnesses that the defense 4 put on, larry and loretta. loretta said 5 certainly his behavior was not of a person who 6 could not do without his ciggies. remember she 7 said that? that he smoked a lot, and 8 consistently. 9 and larry testified: we all encouraged 10 dale to smoke (sic) over the years, as early as 11 the '70s. 12 and he said -- he said: i do not know if 13 my brother ever used the word "addicted," but 14 that is basically what his problem was. he 15 could not quit. 16 and he said he made several attempts. he 17 was making an effort. and he even said when 18 something would be introduced on the market, he 19 would try it. that is what larry told us, his 20 own brother. 21 and larry made it clear that he believed 22 dale smoked because he believed him to be 23 addicted, and it was his opinion that dale was 24 addicted to cigarettes because, quote, "given 25 the difficulty he had with giving them up, i 1 know from public awareness and public knowledge 2 that cigarettes are addictive, and he is a 3 lifelong smoker. put the two together." 4 that is what larry responded to questions 5 asked by the defense. 6 remember that testimony? basically a 7 no-brainer, put it together. he was addicted. 8 of course. 9 now, we heard discussions about dale's 10 sickness and you saw him testify. and you saw 11 and we talked about the fact that he finally 12 quit with zyban. but unfortunately for dale, 13 it was too late. 14 slide 34. 15 the disease process that had gotten so 16 far advanced as a result of his addiction that 17 he could not breathe without the aid of oxygen. 18 these are some of the medical records 19 that talk about just how bad his copd had 20 gotten, that he needed 24-hour oxygen. he 21 became a respiratory cripple, and eventually 22 the end-stage copd literally took his breath 23 away, and he died. 24 now, you saw the death certificate and 25 you saw -- there was discussion about how it 1 was amended to reflect the proper reason why he 2 died. he died from the copd. 3 and you heard lisa and heather and dawn 4 talk about what their father meant. we are not 5 here looking for sympathy. we are not here 6 asking you to feel sorry for heather or lisa or 7 dawn, even dale. we are asking you for justice. 8 we are asking for justice. 9 you can put that down. 10 you know, fortunately, dawn and lisa and 11 heather, they have got each other, and they 12 turned to each other when dale passed away, and 13 they turned to each other to grieve, and 14 they have been here for each other every day. 15 and they will continue to be here for each 16 other. but they lost their father. 17 and, you know, it was asked a lot of 18 times: well, how old were you when your father 19 passed away? 20 and each of them were in their 50s. it 21 was only last year. 22 and how old was dale when he passed away. 23 they kept making a point that dale was 84 years 24 old, as if, hey, he lived long enough. that is 25 the point they were trying to make. and, hey, 1 you are 50 years old. you know, you had enough 2 time with your father. 3 there is never enough time. because when 4 dale was 84, last year, they were looking 5 forward to spending his 85th birthday with him 6 in june of this year, as opposed to preparing 7 for this trial. that is what they were looking 8 forward to, but he never made it. 9 and they were looking forward to having a 10 90th birthday with him. and you heard what the 11 table said, 6.7 years. he could have lived 12 until 90. 13 but that is taken away from them. and 14 it is taken away from them because of what 15 cigarettes did to him. and that is why we are 16 here. 17 now, the verdict form i want to go 18 through very quickly with you. 19 can we turn this on? 20 technician: sure. 21 mr. hammer: i already talked about these 22 questions. these are the class membership 23 questions. 24 was smoking cigarettes a legal cause of 25 dale moyer's heart disease? of course. 1 did dale moyer's copd or emphysema first 2 manifest on or before november 21, 1996? of 3 course it did. that was back in '93, '94, when 4 he was diagnosed. 5 was he addicted to cigarettes containing 6 nicotine, and if so, was such addiction a legal 7 cause of his copd or emphysema or heart 8 disease? of course. 9 those are the threshold questions to make 10 him a class member. that is why we are here. 11 the next page is going to have -- there is 12 a question: did dale moyer have primary parotid 13 cancer? and you heard evidence about that. 14 you heard evidence from the defense who called 15 their only medical expert, a doctor who said 16 no, that was skin cancer. 17 well, you also heard from dr. -- from -- 18 name escapes me. 19 mr. schlesinger: policzer. 20 mr. hammer: policzer. thank you, scott. 21 from dr. policzer. he said based on his 22 experience, he is an oncologist, that parotid 23 cancer was basically caused by smoking. that is 24 for you to determine. 25 we think we have submitted sufficient 1 evidence to show by a greater weight of the 2 evidence that parotid cancer was caused by 3 smoking, and that he had primary parotid 4 cancer. 5 now, did the cigarettes that these 6 defendants made, lucky strikes, chesterfields, 7 the old gold, the kents, the salems, did they 8 cause dale's smoking-related illnesses? of 9 course they did. no question about it. so you 10 should check off yes there. 11 the next question, percentage of fault. 12 and that is something you will need to think about 13 yourselves. but dale accepted fault for his 14 smoking, for his inability to quit, perhaps. 15 but think about dale's choices and then 16 think about the tobacco company's choices that 17 they made. 18 the court: five minutes, counsel. 19 mr. hammer: i would suggest to you, 20 since he smoked reynolds products and lorillard 21 products for most of his life, the kent, lucky 22 strike, salems, they are forty percent. liggett 23 is 15, and dale is 5. 24 did he reasonably rely on these 25 statements that were made? well, he certainly 1 switched to kent filters based on their 2 assurances, health assurances. 3 he certainly switched to salems after 4 '82. so he relied before and after '82. 5 so these questions should be absolutely 6 checked off yes all the way down, because he 7 relied on what these companies said about their 8 health effects, health reassurances. 9 i know i'm going through this fast, but i 10 want to get to this part. and that is: were -- 11 were dale's smoking-related diseases a legal 12 cause of his death? 13 and we say that as a result of the 14 parotid cancer, which we say was caused by 15 smoking, and the copd that prevented him from 16 having the surgery to remove the parotid 17 cancer, that led to his death. so we say yes. 18 so, therefore, heather and dawn and lisa 19 should be entitled to compensation for the loss 20 of their father. 21 and how do you put a dollar figure on 22 somebody's life? how do you do that? because 23 it is not going to bring them back. 24 but you talk in the only way that we can, 25 and that is money. 1 i would suggest to you that $2.5 million 2 is fair and just compensation to each of these 3 girls for the loss of their father. and that 4 the medical expenses that were incurred, we 5 heard was $373,436.55. and then you total that 6 up, and that would be 7.873,436. 7 but if you do not think -- if you do not 8 think that cigarette smoking, his addiction 9 caused his death, but rather something else 10 did. if you believe it was all the skin cancer 11 that they are talking about, we will accept that. 12 we will respect that. and if that is the case, 13 you go to dale moyer's suffering. 14 and how do you compensate dale? he is 15 dead. but how about those years he went 16 through, 20 years, 1994 until just last year 17 when he died, of gasping for air, gradually 18 getting worse over the years, where it got to 19 be that he was on 24/7 oxygen. 20 now, you saw him. he testified. you saw 21 him testify five different days. november 18 22 into december, december 5th and 6th, and into 23 january, and then he testified march 7th, 2012. 24 a year before he died. exactly a year. 25 so you got to see what he looked like 1 over a period of time. you saw from that short 2 period of time, he declined quite a bit. 3 but then we got a year later in january 4 and had the day in the life video you saw. you 5 saw how much worse he was. 6 that is what dale moyer was going through 7 every day. gasping for air. how do you 8 compensate somebody for that? 9 he did not choose that. nobody chooses 10 that. 11 we think fair and just compensation to 12 dale would be $10 million. 13 that is fair for what he suffered through 14 on a daily basis for nearly 20 years. that is 15 certainly fair. 16 and you may think that is too much. you 17 may think it is not enough. that is totally your 18 province, your decision. and we respect 19 whatever decision you might make. 20 and, of course, the medical bills again 21 were $373,436.55, for a total of 10,373,436.55. 22 now, scott is going to talk to you about 23 punitive damages and why they should be 24 punished. but i think after he talks to you, 25 you all will feel comfortable in saying yes, 1 they do -- these companies do deserve to be 2 punished for what they did and continue to do 3 today. 4 thank you. 25 mr. schlesinger: may it please the 1 court, counsel, ladies and gentlemen. 2 i talk faster than steve hammer, and i've 3 got a lot more to cover. so i'll try to let it 4 come out. some of it will wash over you, but 5 i'll go as fast as i can. 6 i'll go to the first slide. 7 dale moyer never knew that cigarettes 8 contained paint stripper, welding torch 9 chemicals, ant poison, napalm, lighter fluid, 10 car batteries, car exhaustion, insecticide, 11 embalming fluid, and so on and so forth. 12 polonium 210 used in nuclear weapons, rocket 13 fuel, things like that. he never knew that. 14 so you know, today you have in evidence 15 in this case these documents, including this 16 document right here. this is the latest 17 surgeon general report. this is from 2014. it 18 came out into evidence, it came out in the 19 public in january of 2014. 20 every two years, they put one out. so 21 this is current information. you have the last 22 four years: 2010, 2012, and 2014. 23 and in the most recent order of things 24 that are important to know what is happening in 25 this country with regard to cigarette smoking, 1 when this group, the surgeon general, the chief 2 medical officer of the united states, who is 3 the one who is in charge of looking after the 4 public health, wants to tell you what the 5 current status of information that you need to 6 know, he says in his major conclusion of the 7 report, on page 6 of that report in evidence -- 8 page 7, excuse me. 9 you can write these down. you are going 10 to have them. you can see them. if you want 11 to write them down, you can see them. 12 this is the conclusion: the tobacco 13 epidemic was initiated and has been sustained 14 by the aggressive strategies of the tobacco 15 industry, which has deliberately misled the 16 public on the risks of smoking cigarettes. 17 that is current information as of today. 18 so that our research, our understanding, 19 the surgeon general's 2010 report, the surgeon 20 general's 2012 report, the entire report is 21 about teen smoking. 22 what is smoking? smoking is drug 23 addiction. pure and simple. it is hard to wrap 24 your minds around it, but that is all it is. 25 what has it been since tobacco has begun, 1 the inhalation process to unleash the demon of 2 deep addiction? that is all it is ever been. 3 they know it. that is what they sell. 4 the epidemic of addiction-driven disease 5 is what we have in this country today 6 unchanged. 7 his honor talked about are you going to 8 punish them? well, you can consider mitigation 9 if you punish them, meaning what have they done 10 different? 11 what have they done different? nothing. 12 the surgeon general's report as of the last few 13 months says as a scientific conclusion: that 14 this epidemic that we have in our country of 15 losing a half a million people a year, over 16 1200 people a day, 20 million people since 17 1964, that these deaths, these scourges, these 18 unnecessary deaths have all been because of an 19 industry that initiated and sustained 20 aggressive strategies and deliberately misled 21 the product -- the public on the risks of 22 smoking cigarettes. 23 now, let us go to -- i'm going to start 24 with 6 and then i'm going to click. okay? 25 okay. so this is addiction causation. 1 we are going to talk about that real briefly. 2 this is just 2004, nicotine addiction leads 3 directly to cancer through a bunch of 4 biological pathways. 5 question 1. addiction drives smoking. 6 addiction is the center of the universe of the 7 tobacco business. of course that is how you get 8 diseases. you get it from smoking. do not 9 forget class membership -- 10 is this going to work -- do i have the 11 clicker? 12 technician: yes. 13 mr. schlesinger: class membership, this 14 is important, is not about the fault of either 15 party, the reliance on statements from the 16 tobacco industry, whether addicts lose total 17 control over their minds, and whether addicts 18 can quit. that is not what class membership is 19 about. 20 where am i supposed to point this to get 21 it to work? 22 technician: you should be able to click 23 it. 24 mr. schlesinger: was that me or you? 25 technician: that was me. 1 mr. schlesinger: is this thing working 2 or not? i've got no time to waste. heck. 3 technician: you accidentally turned it 4 off. it is on. 5 mr. schlesinger: okay. 6 very simply this. addiction to nicotine. 7 a legal cause of smoking leading to copd, heart 8 disease, lung cancer. and as dr. policzer 9 said, head and neck cancer, parotid cancer. 10 you heard about that. 11 it is an epidemic of addiction-driven 12 disease and death. 13 how do we know that? if you go to this 14 book here, the authoritative, definitive 15 reference, the admitted in evidence because of 16 its validity to you in your decision making, 17 the bottom line is that nicotine addiction is 18 the fundamental reason that folks persist in 19 using tobacco products, and that persistent use 20 contributes to many of the diseases described 21 in this report. 22 addiction leads to disease. they said it 23 in 2004 in the surgeon general's report. they 24 say it here on page 77: nicotine maintains the 25 addiction and thereby leads to ongoing 1 exposures of smokers to come up with compounds 2 with known adverse effects. 3 and what do the tobacco companies know in 4 this unbelievable conspiracy and fraud that 5 took 50 years by an industry that utterly lost 6 its moral compass, that acted utterly -- 7 mr. boyce: objection. morality, 8 your honor. 9 the court: i'm sorry, counsel? 10 mr. boyce: objection to the reference of 11 morals. 12 mr. schlesinger: in the supreme court 13 opinion. 14 the court: objection noted. overruled. 15 this is argument. proceed. 16 mr. schlesinger: when we ask you to get 17 through compensatory damages, that is 18 restorative damages for the family members, the 19 conduit to punitive damages, a call for you to 20 look at this as an expression of moral 21 condemnation. 22 it calls for a day of reckoning, a time 23 where there is a punishment for past misdeeds, 24 so a tobacco industry wants them -- they have 25 an instruction and they want to be considered 1 as people. they have the rights of people, and 2 we agree. they have the rights of people. 3 and we agree, they have the rights of 4 people. 5 well, you know what comes the rights of 6 personhood and humanity? the responsibilities 7 of personhood and humanity. which means, be 8 decent. act decently to one another. you do 9 not trade lives for money. you do not act 10 where unmitigated greed takes over and somebody 11 embarks upon a plan where they will addict 12 children, hook them for life, kill them and 13 replace them with more children? 14 mr. woods: objection. 15 mr. schlesinger: that is the business in 16 this country? 17 the court: take it down a notch, 18 counsel. 19 mr. schlesinger: yes, sir. sorry. 20 i'll speed it up, but i will not get too 21 fired up. 22 that is not an appropriate business model 23 in this country, and that is their model. lure, 24 entice, addict. turn your addicted customer 25 into a cash flow for a period of time. and 1 when they meet the demise that you fully know 2 they will, replace them with more youth and 3 children. 4 that is not a business model. they say 5 it is a legal product. it is a legal product. 6 but it is not legal to sell it to minors. and 7 the entire basis of the business is minors. 8 the surgeon general 2012 again, even now, 9 even in 2012, even this recently, we have to 10 have the surgeon general putting out reports 11 saying we have got to do something about youth 12 initiation. 13 all smoking. it is right in the preface 14 of this document. all smoking begins in youth 15 and adolescents. 16 if you took away cigarette smoking from 17 anyone under 21 years old, if no one under 21 18 years old could get a cigarette, cigarette 19 smoking would go down ninety percent in this 20 country. ninety percent in this country. 21 they would still have a business. 22 instead of making the money they are making, 23 they would make less. but it still would be a 24 going business. that is a very important thing 25 to consider. 1 everything here. they say it is a rat in 2 the cage. they compare their customers to a 3 rat in the cage. they humanize themselves. 4 they talk about the health of their country -- 5 of their company. the health of their profits. 6 they are giving birth to new smokers. 7 the language of anthropomorphizing 8 characteristics to themselves where they 9 describe their customers as rats in a cage. 10 there is even a document there where they talk 11 about the crop of new youth. 12 this is the kind of language they have used 13 over the years in secret documents that nobody 14 ever thought would see the light of day. 15 no one has ever become a cigarette smoker 16 by smoking cigarettes without nicotine, and 17 very few consumers are aware of the effects of 18 nicotine. 19 do you think that my client, dale moyer, 20 ever had any idea when he was nine years old 21 what was getting himself into? 22 you want to know about, did they 23 contribute to cause by managing the information 24 environment and getting folks to think that 25 they were having a good time and having 1 satisfaction that mr. moyer had any long-range 2 understanding of what he was getting himself 3 into? 4 remember, they said $250,000 billion 5 dollars -- no -- $250 billion on advertising. 6 if they had spent $250 billion telling the 7 truth, would my client have been a long-term 8 smoker and gotten sick? 9 they said they would go out of business 10 if it was ever proven that this was a dangerous 11 commodity that they were selling, this tobacco. 12 if they had told the truth and stopped 13 making it, would my client have died from any 14 cigarette-related diseases? absolutely not. 15 would he have been sickened to the point 16 where his life deteriorated in the last 20 17 years? he was only in his 60s when he got 18 sick, and solely but surely began gasping for 19 air. 20 did my client know that there is over 70 21 carcinogens, and over half of all smokers die 22 from tobacco-related disease? and as the 23 current surgeon general's report says, 480,000 24 a year dying, 20 million, 1200 a day. 25 one of the things you will learn when we 1 read about this, and you will see it in these 2 reports. i encourage you to look at them as 3 you think about this. 4 the numbers numb. they are so huge. if 5 we have a tragedy that makes it on to the 6 evening news and a few people get hurt or there 7 is a bad killing abroad or something and 8 several people get hurt, people know about 9 that. it is evening news. 10 and yet this is a tragedy. this is an 11 irrational madness that hides in plain sight. 12 we have this scourge living in our country that 13 happens every single day. over 1300 people are 14 dying, 20 million have died, even since the 15 1964 surgeon general report. does not make 16 sense, but it is happening right under our nose. 17 everything the surgeon general explains 18 is there is no free choice in smoking. and 19 that is the tautology, that is the logical 20 thing that you must take into consideration. 21 i do not know that the defendants are 22 always being anything but a little hypocritical 23 about it -- 24 mr. woods: objection. 25 ms. ruiz: objection. 1 the court: sustained. 2 mr. schlesinger: you do not have a choice 3 when it comes to smoking. it is not a matter of 4 free choice. 5 kids cannot make long-range plans. their 6 brains are developing. they do not know where 7 they are. they do not know what they are getting 8 themselves into. 9 here is what they say in their own 10 internal documents. you remember shook hardy, 11 the lawyer that hired the pathologist that came 12 to testify. that is a law firm. 13 mr. woods: objection, your honor. 14 the court: i overruled the objection. 15 mr. schlesinger: right here. right 16 here, internal secret document. we got these 17 documents in the year 2000. we have the goods 18 on them now. smoking is going down as we learn 19 more. 20 these books are full of research. what 21 we are learning from what tobacco knew all 22 along. they were light years ahead. they were 23 light years ahead of the public health 24 community. they knew more about nicotine. 25 they knew more about cancer. they knew more 1 about those filters that did not work. they 2 knew that the light cigarettes did not work. 3 they beat the ftc machine. 4 that is in this book right here, the 5 national cancer institute book number 13. read 6 the pages from 200 to 233, and you will see what 7 a fraud it was that filters and lights would 8 reassure the health. 9 and what do they do now? what has 10 changed? has anything at all changed? now 11 they have american spirit. today. right now. 12 american spirit. one hundred percent additive free 13 organic tobacco. 14 in our modern world in the year 2014, 15 what do we think when we hear "organic, 100 16 percent additive free"? 17 oh, by the way, with menthol, which we 18 know in this book makes cigarettes more 19 addictive, one-third of all sales of cigarettes 20 are menthol. the fda is considering banning 21 menthol, and dr. proctor testified -- 22 mr. boyce: objection, your honor, 23 further tpsac report. 24 mr. schlesinger: i'm not talking about 25 the tpsac report. 1 mr. boyce: move to strike. 2 the court: counsel. 3 you are to rely on your own recollection 4 of the evidence. thank you. 5 proceed. 6 mr. schlesinger: yes. 7 menthol makes cigarettes more addictive. 8 one-third of cigarettes are menthol. 9 dr. proctor testified it makes it more 10 addictive. he talked about it. 11 mr. moyer was a smoker of menthol. 12 thought they would be better for him. like he 13 thought the lights would be better for him. 14 like he thought the filters would be better for 15 him. 16 he smoked kents. kents were a health 17 reassurance brand. they had the american 18 medical association advertising, the journal of 19 the american medical association advertising 20 how smart people and scientific it was to have 21 this micronite filter. 22 and dale moyer jumped all over that, and 23 he testified that was part of the reason why he 24 continued to smoke. 25 and that was what they were planning. he 1 fit their -- he fit their marketing plan to a 2 tee. 3 there is the simple truth. do we have 4 to -- does it take more than that? it does not. 5 it does not take more than that. but this looks 6 like a consumer product. it is invisible to 7 people who do not notice it, but it is just 8 sitting back behind the counter there. 9 but that is the simple truth. he did 10 that. i did that. dale smoked a million 11 cigarettes. a million cigarettes. nobody 12 smokes a million cigarettes except for the 13 compulsive use of a drug. eight puffs of 14 cigarette, 8 million direct hits of nicotine to 15 the brain. 16 this is the chain -- you played this, 17 right? 18 technician: yes. 19 mr. schlesinger: this is heart disease. 20 very interesting about the heart disease. 21 there is no doubt that he had a manifestation of 22 heart disease before 1996. 23 for class membership, i'm doing it real 24 quick. ascvd, that is atherosclerotic vascular 25 disease. and the fact is, you are not going to 1 be asked a question about manifestation. he 2 had cigarette -- he had a heart disease before 3 '96. 4 that is not in dispute. that is one of the 5 things that should be not in dispute. but what 6 you do have to figure out is whether or not the 7 heart disease was caused from smoking. 8 here is what we know about it. i'm going 9 to do it quick. 10 mascarenhas and civantos both testify 11 about it. civantos came in here. this guy was 12 a top doc. and i know you know it, because 13 that man was a professor, he was credentialed. 14 he was a scholar. i hope you found him 15 credible. he appeared to be. 16 he said within a reasonable degree of 17 medical probability, smoking was a substantial 18 contributing cause to dale moyer's heart 19 disease. 20 all by itself, if that is true, and 21 addiction leads to heart disease, which it is 22 the number one cause of heart disease, he is a 23 class member just on the heart disease. 24 and mascarenhas said it too. but 25 mascarenhas said it is the number one cause 1 factor. and he said as the number one cause 2 factor, it acts in combination with whatever 3 other cause factors the defendants were trying 4 to establish. 5 mr. boyce: objection, misstates the 6 evidence. misstates dr. mascarenhas's 7 testimony. 8 the court: excuse me. 9 ladies and gentlemen, rely on your own 10 recollection of the evidence. 11 counsel. 12 mr. schlesinger: we will come -- what is 13 interesting is, i'm a lumper, because the law 14 in this case calls for us to be lumpers, not 15 splitters. 16 what does that mean? the contributing 17 cause, in order to be the cause of something, 18 it need not be the only cause. it can be a 19 contributing cause. many things can combine to 20 cause something. that is lumping. 21 when it comes to heart disease -- and 22 i'll point it out to you, it is in this book. 23 it is in the surgeon general 2010. 24 the number one factor for smoking, for 25 heart disease, is smoking. it acts in 1 combination with family, with family history, 2 with all these other things. and you will see 3 that it is the number one factor, and 4 dr. mascarenhas said it acted in combination. 5 the questions they asked him tried to 6 make it seem like there is only one thing, was 7 it the cause. that is not the law. it is was it 8 a cause? could it have contributed with a 9 family history, which by the way, they said 10 assume hypothetically his father never smoked. 11 well, you heard dale and his brother 12 testify that his father did smoke. so take 13 that away from it. this is the perfect place 14 to learn about lumping. 15 when you guys saw that lengthy jury 16 instruction read to you over and over again 17 about contributing cause, acting in combination 18 with other causes, that is what lumping together 19 was, and we will go through that. 20 this -- all the places where -- before 21 1996, dale was diagnosed with chronic lung 22 disease, severe chronic lung disease secondary 23 to emphysema, chronic obstructive lung disease, 24 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 25 discrete effort capacity probably 1 secondary to associated copd. i assume they are 2 not going to spend time talking about this at 3 all, because they have no evidence whatsoever 4 to contradict it. they did not bring anybody 5 in. nobody, nothing. 6 this is manifestation for class 7 membership. these are the symptoms. you heard 8 the judge instruct you. signs, symptoms, or 9 the diagnosis. 10 so there is eight places in the key 11 relevant time period before '96 when the 12 diagnosis was made, and here's nine places 13 where he was having wheezing and rales and 14 rhonchi and all that congestion and nasty stuff 15 in his lungs, which goes along with the 16 existence of the condition which he had. 17 so he had the disease in the relevant 18 class period. 19 and let me tell you how much evidence 20 they have to contradict it: nothing, zero, 21 nada, zip, zilch. 22 now, nine visits, he had symptoms of copd 23 all in the class period. 24 so this is what -- this is what 25 mascarenhas said. i'll do it real quick. i 1 should not have to spend the time on it. i 2 will. 3 remember, this is the defense asking the 4 questions. you agree looking at those risk 5 factors you cannot say to a reasonable medical 6 probability which one was the cause? no. he 7 does not agree. 8 you lump them together. there is a point 9 score which does put cigarette smoking at 10 number one. 11 i'll let them read the rest to you. 12 but the fact is, dr. civantos said: it is 13 a well-known, recognized fact that smoking 14 increases it. 15 and i asked him: did it substantially 16 contribute to the production of his heart 17 disease, and it is true within a reasonable 18 degree of medical probability. 19 all by himself, addiction to cigarettes 20 causing heart disease is a class membership 21 qualification. 22 he was a heavy smoker, that means 100 23 pack years of smoking. 24 you know, if he is not an addicted smoker 25 who is sick from smoking -- he had the big 1 three: heart disease, lung cancer, emphysema. 2 he had the big three. if he is not a class 3 member, nobody could be a class member. 4 how big is the class? do the math. it is 5 in the books. how many people get sick every 6 year. 7 mr. boyce: objection. 8 the court: what is the objection? 9 mr. boyce: improper argument, misstates 10 the class definition and reference to harm to 11 others. 12 the court: thank you, counsel. 13 ladies and gentlemen, i have instructed 14 you on the law. my instructions are 15 concerned -- this is counsel's take on what the 16 evidence presented. 17 proceed. 18 mr. schlesinger: may it please the 19 court. 20 i suggest to you -- here is what i do. i 21 rebut the logic of the defendants' arguments. 22 if you take their arguments to the logical 23 conclusion, and it is old like aristotle 24 philosopher way of doing logic: reduce it to 25 its most basic components. 1 reductio ad absurdum. it is latin. 2 you have probably heard of it. it means, let us 3 take it all the way to its logical conclusion. 4 their defense in this case will reveal 5 that under no set of circumstances could 6 anybody ever be a class member. 7 mr. boyce: objection. 8 the court: sustained. sustained. 9 mr. boyce: move to strike and request a 10 curative instruction, please. 11 (the following discussion was held at 12 sidebar:) 13 mr. schlesinger: hold my time, please. 14 the court: it is running time. 15 listen, a couple things. number one, you 16 talk about what defense will argue. do not be 17 talking about -- they have not argued. you are 18 going into rebuttal and they have not done their 19 argument yet. you are saying -- going through 20 this. do not denigrate whatever defense they are 21 putting on. i'm not going to tolerate it. 22 mr. schlesinger: yes, sir. 23 mr. woods: your honor, while we are here, 24 the objection that i had to the shook hardy 25 document was this. mr. schlesinger said that 1 shook hardy hired that expert that came in to 2 testify. 3 first of all, that is not true. it was 4 brent filbert. he was with my firm. 5 but second, that is exactly the concern 6 that i had with that document, the tie-in to 7 attorneys in this case, and that is exactly what 8 happened. 9 the court: yes, sir? 10 mr. schlesinger: i just want to go. 11 the court: thank you. 12 (sidebar discussion concluded, and the 13 following was held in open court:) 14 the court: ladies and gentlemen, 15 regarding the last comment of counsel, just 16 disregard it. all right? 17 resume your closing statement. 18 mr. schlesinger: okay. 19 so civantos talks about cause of death, 20 and he explains it is a combination of parotid 21 cancer and the copd, and they both played a 22 role and they went hand in hand. 23 remember what civantos said. and i asked 24 him, because we did not get to get dale here. 25 we would have liked to have dale here. he 1 did not make it here. you cannot help that. you 2 know what, 20 years after lawsuits are filed 3 for sick smokers, a lot of them die. 4 mr. boyce: objection. 5 the court: counsel. sustained. 6 counsel, it is not relevant in this case. 7 come on. 8 mr. schlesinger: dale died before he 9 could get to court. however, he was sick for 10 20 years from smoking. 11 when he died, he died from a 12 tobacco-related complexity of illness. when 13 you get sick and you die of tobacco diseases, 14 like lung cancer and things like that, they 15 combine and they make it difficult to treat 16 you. 17 so as dr. civantos said, i could have 18 treated that condition. i could have done 19 surgery on the cancer on his face, and given 20 him a high of 60 to seventy percent likelihood of 21 cure and additional life expectancy, but under 22 no set of circumstances could i do the 23 procedure because the pulmonologist would not 24 let me. 25 and there is many records throughout there 1 that said he was not a candidate for surgery. 2 he was not an ideal candidate. 3 now, he also said -- because we want to 4 be transparent with all the evidence. we gave 5 it to you as it came in so you guys could 6 evaluate it -- that on balance, civantos said: 7 i do not think -- i thought that cancer came 8 from his skin cancer. 9 remember policzer said: i think it is a 10 smoking-related cancer. a head and neck 11 smoking-related cancer in the parotid. that is 12 what dr. policzer said. he was very forceful 13 about that. that was his stated testimony. in 14 it came. 15 civantos said -- and i said: on balance, 16 how do you fall down on whether it is in the 17 parotid or not from something else, could be 18 from skin? 19 he said: more likely than not, i think 20 it is from skin. 21 and we presented that to you. 22 now, if you decide the end-stage copd on 23 top of the smoking-caused cancer, which by the 24 way, i remember in opening statement hearing 25 something about he had lung cancer for three 1 weeks. there is no such thing as lung cancer 2 for three weeks. i think that underplays what 3 the severity of the disease was. 4 he had lung cancer and surveillance of 5 successful treatment for five years. okay? 6 i do not think you can compare lung 7 cancer, something that comes and goes like the 8 flu for only three weeks. he had lung cancer 9 on top of copd, profoundly diminished lung 10 function, was not a candidate for the surgery on 11 his cancer that civantos said was skin, more 12 likely than not. 13 but despite that, he could have saved him 14 seventy percent, 60, seventy percent, except for the fact 15 he could not withstand surgery. 16 and policzer said: it is a head and neck 17 from smoking. 18 if you say -- if you decide, hey, you 19 know what? we know he was sick from smoking. 20 we know he paid a price for those cigarettes, 21 but we do not think that his death had anything 22 to do with it, if that is how you see the 23 evidence and that is why we provided it all to 24 you, we feel the greater weight of the 25 evidence -- that is why i brought these 1 scales -- it is what is more likely, what weighs 2 more, what persuades me more. 3 if you feel on balance the greater weight 4 of the evidence is clearly that cigarette 5 smoking played an important role in his death, 6 then the damages are death damages. 7 but if you do not go that route, the 8 damages are survival damages, for all of the 9 pain and suffering that dale went through 10 during the years he was alive. 11 here's all the records, they are all in 12 evidence. just so you know, you see this: 13 one, two, three, four, five, six. you see 14 this, that is six gigantic bankers boxes, and 15 they are all for you. all for you. take as 16 long as you like. 17 you can look through any of them. all 18 the evidence is in there. all the records are 19 in there. all the internal documents are in 20 there. anything you want to know, take a 21 little work to find it. you can all verify it. 22 it is all there. 23 but the bottom line for all of it, he is 24 not a surgical candidate. dr. civantos 25 explained clearly the choice is surgery, not 1 radiation, and he had less than a 25 percent 2 chance of cure with the -- with chemotherapy, 3 because he knew it was palliative only. 4 that is what dr. policzer said. you 5 were not going to save dale by going the route 6 of radiation when you were not able to cure him 7 with the surgery, which was the primary 8 treatment. 9 which is why when dale had such a 10 terrible reaction to the radiation and he 11 already knew he was not really likely going for 12 cure, he knew he was in a rock and a hard 13 place. that is what dr. civantos said. 14 they had to make a decision. the 15 anesthesiologist was not going to put him to 16 sleep. alvarez told dr. civantos: there is no 17 way we can give this guy the surgery. 18 and as a result, he lived for a little 19 longer and he died. 20 this board here, i think that mr. hammer 21 showed you really quickly, you can look at it 22 from '95 all the way through 2013, chronicles a 23 progressive deterioration of this man's ability 24 to live a life because of chronic obstructive 25 pulmonary disease, destructive emphysema, which 1 is what cigarettes do to you. nothing else 2 does it. there is no dispute it was caused by 3 it. 4 and his life got worse and worse and 5 tougher and tougher. even at the end in that 6 little day in the life film, you could see him 7 gasping for air. even in his depositions, you 8 saw him and you knew he lost function. 9 he lost those 20 years of life. he could 10 have been out smelling the roses, doing all 11 that. he lost all that. 12 we already covered this. he is a class 13 member. here are the engle jury findings. 14 you know, these were all disputed. these 15 all had to be proven. but they caused all 16 these diseases. nicotine in cigarettes is 17 addictive. these cigarettes are defective and 18 unreasonably dangerous. more dangerous than 19 they have to be. 20 they are inhalable. they are highly 21 addictive. they deliver a dose of nicotine 22 faster than any other way to the system, and as 23 a result, you can engineer them differently. 24 dr. proctor said: take away the 25 inhalability. take out the addictiveness. 1 give people a real choice. 2 they could do that, but they will not do 3 that. that is the basis of their business and 4 the center of their universe. that is the fraud 5 finding, because they lied about what they knew 6 and they lied intending for folks to rely on 7 it. 8 down here the conspiracy, they all got 9 together and did it. liggett was part of the 10 conspiracy. they all worked together, they all 11 paid the tobacco institute, the tobacco 12 research institute, the tirc. 13 the tirc, they paid them to put out all 14 those phony papers. they paid off the ama. 15 they did a lot of stuff that does not meet with 16 the bounds of reasonable human decency in this 17 country. 18 extraordinarily reprehensible conduct. 19 but all of these are findings that are 20 preclusive. they cannot deny them. and you can 21 listen to hear how they talk about them to you 22 when they have a chance to talk. 23 this is the business, the lumper. this 24 is the lumper -- instruction. and then -- oh, 25 my goodness. there is too many words there. 1 let me tell you this. let us talk about 2 dale moyer. tobacco companies created a new 3 product for this, a new market for this altered 4 product, these inhalable cigarettes that 5 unleashed the dragon of nicotine addiction and 6 ingrained it into the fabric of society so that 7 it became the social norm to smoke. 8 young dale moyer in the '30s, in the 9 '40s, in the '60s, all the way up to 1966, 10 there was not a single word on the pack of 11 cigarettes that said there was anything wrong 12 with it. 13 everybody was smoking; doctors, 14 hospitals, you could smoke everywhere. it was 15 the social norm. more than half of men smoked. 16 he started smoking in an era of innocence. 17 smokers most commonly switched to the 18 brands -- the leading brands that are 19 advertised more frequently and gained market 20 share in the popularity of the market. that is 21 exactly what he did. just like dale moyer. 22 a majority of smokers fell prey to the 23 filter fraud of the '50s, and it was a filter 24 fraud. just like dale moyer. 25 and many smokers switched to kent with 1 the micronite filter and lorillard marketed it 2 as a safer cigarette. 3 this is page 201 from monograph 13. 4 right here. look at that advertisement. the 5 american medical association voluntarily 6 conducted their own laboratory and independent 7 tests and reported in jama. these tests proved 8 of all the filters tested, one was the most 9 effective for removing tars and nicotine, the 10 filter used by kent. just like dale moyer. 11 he was on those cigarettes for 25 years. 12 he was given the illusion of filtration. they 13 never intended for the filters to work. it was 14 a gimmick. 15 but dale did not know it was a gimmick. 16 he relied on it being something to help him. 17 he did not know it was a gimmick. 18 smokers switched to menthol, thinking 19 they were better for them. they advertised 20 menthol as medicinal. that is also in this 21 book. they were also aware that menthol 22 cigarettes were much more addictive. 23 you know why? the incredibly additional 24 addictiveness that menthol, which represents 25 one-third of the cigarette market in the united 1 states. one out of every three cigarettes 2 smoked is menthol. and they are smoked by teens 3 and youth. they ease youth initiation, but 4 they deepen addiction and make it harder to 5 quit. 6 mr. boyce: objection, your honor. 7 mr. schlesinger: it is in this book. 8 the court: counsel. 9 ladies and gentlemen, you are to rely on 10 your own recollection of the evidence. 11 thank you. proceed. 12 mr. schlesinger: just like dale moyer. 13 many smokers were fooled by the illusion 14 of safety created by lights and switch, rather 15 than keep trying to quit. just like dale 16 moyer. 17 many smokers were unaware that the 18 cigarettes they were smoking were no better and 19 quite possibly the worst from the full flavor 20 alternative they switched from. just like dale 21 moyer. 22 cigarette smokers were unaware that the 23 cigarette companies had gamed the systems as to 24 lights. just like dale moyer. 25 and fooling the ftc machine is right here 1 in monograph 13, on page 233. fooling the 2 machines, and using the data to fool smokers. 3 this is the national cancer institutes of 4 health. the book is in evidence. it lays it 5 out specifically. 6 most smokers were unaware that the 7 cigarette had been engineered for addiction. 8 they did not know about ammonia, flavorants, 9 flue curing. they did not know this is what the 10 cigarettes were being -- done, and neither did 11 dale moyer. 12 dale was one of the millions of smokers 13 that fell into their marketing plan, followed 14 their marketing plan to a tee, stayed in the 15 holding strategy that they created. 16 they had no idea what the companies were 17 up to behind closed doors to manipulate the 18 information, environment and manipulate the 19 truth. just like dale. 20 and it is in the book, over 95 percent of 21 daily smokers who try to quit fail because they 22 cannot overcome the powerfully addictive effects 23 of nicotine. just like dale. 24 millions are caught in the web of deceit. 25 and more than that, this surgeon general's 1 report, the new one, on page -- on the 2 introduction -- introductory section from 3 howard koh, assistant secretary of health: on 4 the other hand, cigarette smoking remains the 5 chief preventible killer in america. 6 this is 2014. 7 with more than 40 million americans 8 caught in a web of tobacco dependence. 9 that is -- i saw the web, it reminded me. 10 there is over 40 million smokers, and the 11 surgeon general says there is over 40 million 12 caught in the web of tobacco dependence. 13 i explained that dependence and addiction 14 are synonymous terms. and they are. that is 15 because smoking is addiction. that is what it 16 is. that is all it is. 17 there is dale. 18 in cases like this, the truth matters, 19 and you are supposed to have consequences for 20 the truth. and when companies do not tell the 21 truth, there should be consequences. 22 when companies engineer for addiction, 23 there will be consequences. when companies 24 target and addict teens, there should be 25 consequences. when companies engineer for 1 addiction, there should be consequences. 2 when they offer up safe alternatives for 3 trying to quit, knowing they do not work and 4 they are just as dangerous, there should be 5 consequences. 6 when they choose to keep selling an 7 addictive, defective, unreasonably dangerous 8 product rather than fix it -- and as 9 dr. proctor said, take out the inhalability, 10 change the ph, lower the levels to subaddictive 11 levels, there should be consequences. 12 when companies sugarcoat and trivialize 13 the powers of nicotine addiction to hook the 14 next generation of teenagers, putting them at 15 unnecessary risk, there should be consequences. 16 when you sell a product and millions of 17 americans, and there is still over 40 million 18 smokers, the truth matters. 19 and there are devastating consequences of 20 these companies' actions driven by 21 eyes-wide-open greed. and that is why 22 punishment is appropriate. 23 i read that to you. that is in the book. 24 that is hot off the press surgeon general. 25 do not forget presentism. look at this 1 case through the eyes of dale moyer in the 2 years he lived at the time he was there. not 3 all of us are anywhere near his age. there is 4 no one in the courtroom here that is that old. 5 i think i'm probably the oldest lawyer in the 6 courtroom. i did not know that was going to 7 happen. it does. 8 but for those of you that have been 9 around and know something about what it used to 10 be like then, work with your fellow jurors and 11 say, let us look at it like dale was able to 12 look at it. 13 the case is about dale moyer, but the 14 case is much more -- 15 mr. boyce: objection, your honor. 16 the court: what is the objection? 17 mr. boyce: can we approach? 18 the court: sure. 19 (the following discussion was held at 20 sidebar:) 21 the court: what is the objection? 22 mr. boyce: he is encouraging jurors to 23 look at their personal experience based on 24 their age. that is the golden rule, personal 25 life. they just said some of you are older 1 than others, bring that experience in and help 2 the jurors -- 3 the court: i agree. all right. go 4 ahead. objection noted. sustained. 5 (sidebar discussion concluded, and the 6 following was held in open court:) 7 mr. schlesinger: i know i'm going fast. 8 i'm sorry. i'm going to give you as much as i 9 can. i know there is a lot of evidence here. 10 some of the information you need to know. 11 one-third of all cancers in the united 12 states are caused by addiction to cigarettes 13 containing nicotine, and that is in this book. 14 if we eliminated cigarettes in this 15 country, it would be the same thing as finding 16 a vaccine that cured one-third of all cancer. 17 $200 billion every year are spent in 18 direct medical costs for the needless diseases 19 caused by the epidemic of nicotine addiction. 20 $200 billion a year are lost in this 21 country every year because of lost 22 productivity -- 23 mr. boyce: objection, your honor. 24 the court: what is the objection? 25 mr. boyce: relevance. 1 the court: overruled. 2 mr. boyce: not appropriate basis for 3 punitive damages in this case. 4 the court: thank you. 5 objection noted. overruled. 6 mr. schlesinger: and as you know, 7 dr. proctor, when they were asking questions 8 about it said it is a defective, unreasonably 9 dangerous product. it is too dangerous to be 10 marketed. it should not be, it should not exist. 11 and his book calls for the abolition of 12 tobacco. that is part of the title of his book 13 that he read to you, the cigarette catastrophe 14 and the case for abolition. 15 well, guess who agrees with dr. proctor? 16 surgeon general 2014. major conclusion -- 17 mr. woods: objection, beyond the scope. 18 the court: sustained. 19 mr. schlesinger: let me read this one 20 excerpt to you from the book: the burden of 21 death and disease from tobacco use in the 22 united states is overwhelmingly caused by 23 cigarettes -- combustible cigarettes and rapid 24 elimination of their use will dramatically 25 reduce this burden. 1 so as an evidence-based standard, the 2 most modern science, the surgeon general calls 3 for rapid elimination of the use of cigarettes. 4 that is just a scientific fact. 5 we talked about their design for 6 addiction with levulinic acid, ammonia 7 compounds and flavorings, menthol and special 8 filtration with tiny holes and bronchodilators 9 so your lungs will open up and see that 10 nicotine. you saw that in opening. 11 they created this market for inhaled 12 nicotine that did not exist, and they made 13 people, through this information, that were 14 affected by it. dale acted in direct 15 accordance with their plan. 16 and as his honor read to you from the 17 description of the jury instructions, it 18 does not have to be any specific, exact ad that 19 went right to dale. it is whether it got there 20 indirectly, inferentially. 21 and it was not a one in one operation. 22 this $250 billion was -- go ahead and play 23 that -- was being spent to influence all of 24 america. 25 5894 1 2 follows:) 3 voice: what cigarette do you smoke? 4 you will be interested to know how the doctors of 5 america answered that question. 6 doctors in every branch of medicine were 7 asked: what cigarettes do you smoke? do you 8 inhale? then you are better off smoking philip 9 morris, and here is how you can prove it. 10 light up a philip morris. take a puff. get a 11 good mouth of smoke. 12 voice: join the men who know. nothing 13 satisfies like the big clean taste of top 14 tobacco -- 15 voice: do not miss the bottom smoking: 16 (inaudible). 17 voice: let us take a winston break. 18 voice: that is it. winston is the one 19 filter cigarette that delivers flavor 20 times 20 a pack. winston has that blend (inaudible). 21 voice: yeah, fred. 22 voice: take a good smoke. sure wish you 23 could taste it. 24 voice: i am tasting it, granny. 25 voice: kent with the micronite filter is 1 smoked by more scientists and more educators 2 than any other cigarette. 3 why not discover for yourself that for 4 good smoking taste, it makes good sense to 5 smoke kent. would not it make good sense for 6 you, too? 7 (video clip concluded.) 8 mr. schlesinger: that was a minute 20. 9 to me it seemed like about six. play it out, 10 please. 11 12 13 follows:) 14 q. when did you switch to kent? 15 a. as soon as i found out about it, they 16 came out with a big advertising program about the 17 micronite filter, and i jumped right on. because 18 that is when it started to become apparent that there 19 was a health problem due to smoking. i never gave 20 that much thought before then. 21 (video clip concluded.) 22 mr. schlesinger: so there is lots of 23 advertising showing it is fun, it is hip. santa 24 claus was selling cigarettes. santa claus is 25 selling cigarettes. 1 salem. salem cigarettes. there is an old 2 carton. salem. merry christmas. people used 3 to buy these for gifts. prewrapped, ready to 4 go. with an advertisement that says -- with a 5 warning: caution, cigarette smoking may be 6 hazardous to your health. 7 but then again, it may not be. that was 8 the doubt campaign -- 9 mr. boyce: objection, your honor. 10 mr. schlesinger: -- of uncertainty. 11 the court: excuse me, what is the 12 objection? 13 mr. boyce: preemption, violation of the 14 instructions. 15 the court: thank you. 16 ladies and gentlemen, objection noted. 17 overruled. you rely on my instructions, ladies 18 and gentlemen. 19 proceed, counsel. 20 mr. schlesinger: so again, we talked 21 about dale being a smoker for -- he was 36 22 years old. smoked for 28 years by the time the 23 first caution came on the pack. 24 remember, during this time, from '53 on, 25 they embarked upon the holding strategy. the 1 doubt campaign. they say it is an open 2 question. we do not know what causes smoking. 3 we are bound to find out. 4 and the only caution said was: it may be 5 harmful to your health. well, then again, it 6 may not. 7 one of the things they talked about was 8 dale should have quit. they should have quit 9 too. they should have quit lying. 10 right here, 250,000 -- 250 billion. when 11 i say 250,000, it is because 250 billion is 12 $250,000 million. that is just a lot of money. 13 and this is from the ftc, the federal 14 trade commission, you know, the effect of 15 advertising, saying tobacco spends more money 16 on marketing in one day than the public health 17 authority spends in a year. 18 so in terms of who is drowning out the 19 message, who is muddying the water, who is 20 creating this atmosphere of confusion, tobacco 21 certainly was. 22 let us see what dale says about it. 23 please. 24 25 5898 1 follows:) 2 q. when you switched to salem cigarettes, 3 why did you switch to salem? 4 a. i thought -- i do not know whether it was 5 right or wrong. i thought that they were a better -- 6 another step in the health direction. being less 7 harmful. 8 q. and you said at some point you switched 9 from salem to salem lights; is that right? 10 a. yes. 11 q. why did you do that? 12 a. again, because i thought there was less 13 health problems. 14 q. and what gave you that idea, that there 15 was less health problems? 16 a. they were light, the same way you -- the 17 connotation that you get with beer, thinking that 18 there is less calories or less whatever. 19 (video clip concluded.) 20 mr. schlesinger: and remember, they knew 21 all along that the filters did not do a thing. 22 remember claude teague, one of the 23 documents? he invented a color-changing 24 filter. when you put the dye in it and when 25 the warmth comes to it, it would turn brown 1 because people attach great significance to 2 what is in the filter. 3 even though it had no effect, the 4 marketing advantages are obvious. so a fake 5 gimmick color-changing filter to make people 6 think something bad was being taken out of the 7 cigarettes. 8 mr. boyce: objection, your honor. 9 mr. schlesinger: that is a document in 10 evidence. 11 mr. boyce: misstates the evidence on 12 whether that was ever used in any product. 13 mr. schlesinger: come on. 14 the court: ladies and gentlemen, you are 15 to rely on your own recollection of the 16 evidence. 17 proceed. 18 mr. schlesinger: may it please the 19 court. 20 that guy there, he won a gold medal in 21 the 400 in track, and he is smoking a kent. he 22 was advertising it. scientists and educators. 23 they are telling dale moyer through this 24 wallpaper advertisement, the 1967 ftc talks 25 about, the immersive advertising that nobody 1 could escape, that smart guys smoke kent 2 because it is got the scientific micronite 3 filter. 4 and then all along internally they said, 5 cullen said, oh, if there is anything bad, we will 6 take it out. filters are coming along now. 7 there were no filters back before the 8 health scare came out in the '50s. now it is 99 9 percent filters even today, 99 percent filters. 10 and they do not make things better, they make 11 things worse. 12 but they knew in their internal documents 13 that smokers were getting as much nicotine and 14 tar, but it abandoned the regular cigarette on 15 the grounds of reduced risks to health. 16 they knew it was an illusion of 17 filtration. they said: we are going to say, 18 here is our triple filter. here is our 19 quadruple filter. and incidentally, a nice 20 jolt of nicotine. and if we could pull that 21 one off, how much will we be able to charge for 22 kent? 23 that is the kind of stuff that they talked 24 about. 25 page 20. important page in the blue book 1 says that: the designs with filters and lights 2 were used by the tobacco industry as a tool to 3 undermine cessation and prevention efforts. 4 says there -- and this is the filter 5 cancer. the filters made the particles 6 smaller. it is in the book. people draw in 7 deeper, deeper into the tiny air sacs of the 8 lung, the alveoli. 9 the only thing supposed to go in our 10 lungs is air. but the poisons, the toxins go 11 in there. the nicotine is what addicts and 12 drives the smoking. the tar is the poison that 13 deteriorates the lung, causes the lung cancer. 14 and they see, wait a second. when we 15 first had that cancer square in the '50s, 20, 16 30 years after people were smoking, we were 17 getting squamous cell carcinoma in the lung. 18 now, since filters came out 20, 30 years 19 later, we are getting adenocarcinoma. 20 adenocarcinomas are because of the change in 21 the filters. so not only did not they work, not 22 only were they never intended to work, but they 23 made things worse. 24 oh, and by the way -- by the way, you may 25 not have seen this. what kind of lung cancer 1 did dale moyer have? filter cancer. he had 2 malignant adenocarcinoma, and it took until 3 2014 in that book, if you look up relative 4 risk, that the relative risk of cancer is 5 worse, cigarettes are more dangerous now than 6 they ever were because of these deeper 7 adenocarcinomas directly from filters. 8 and that is what happened to dale. 9 can you -- can your actions speak any 10 louder? he lived it, he proved it, he did what 11 they told him to do. he went to the kents, he 12 went to the salem lights, he got the filter 13 cancer that even doctors today are reporting as 14 recently as 2014. 15 this talks about ftc reports in evidence. 16 it talks about how people were made to think 17 cigarettes were safer with filters. 18 and finally, when this came out in 19 2001 -- and everything is a holding strategy. 20 everything is a delay. 21 when this came out in 2001, it was still 22 seven more years before they finally rescinded 23 the guidance from the federal government saying 24 if you are going to smoke, smoke those filters. 25 because the surgeon general had been duped by 1 that smoking machine. 2 mr. boyce: objection. 3 the court: what is the objection, 4 counsel? 5 mr. boyce: speaking about what the 6 surgeon general knew, about the surgeon general 7 being duped. 8 the court: sustained as to what the 9 surgeon general knew. 10 other than what is in the report, 11 counsel. thank you. 12 mr. schlesinger: in any event, when the 13 ftc in 2008 put out his press release saying it 14 was no longer going to let tobacco companies 15 say what the government ratings were on tar and 16 nicotine in cigarettes. they said that the ftc 17 will not be a smoke screen for tobacco 18 companies' shameful marketing practices because 19 of the misleading tar and nicotine ratings that 20 had previously been cloaked in government 21 sponsorship. that is 2008. 22 that is not me, that is the federal 23 government saying it. the ftc will no longer 24 be a smoke screen for tobacco companies; 25 shameful marketing practices. and who was a 1 victim of that? millions of people. who was 2 one of those millions? my client, dale moyer. 3 you know they went after teens and youth. 4 i've explained that. you heard a lot about it. 5 and to me that is one of the things that is -- 6 in terms of reprehensibility -- unforgivable. 7 and when we heard -- i remember hearing 8 in voir dire, folks talked about when did you 9 start smoking, when did you start smoking. one 10 of the gals that did not make it on the jury 11 said -- 12 mr. woods: objection. 13 the court: objection. 14 mr. woods: what happened in voir dire is 15 not in evidence. 16 the court: sustained. 17 mr. schlesinger: in any event, it is not 18 kid stuff to start smoking. that very first 19 cigarette can start the process of addiction. 20 that is also in surgeon general '2. 21 the very first puff of the very first 22 cigarette can start the process of addiction 23 for kids. that is why the menthol is good for 24 teen initiation. and once they get hooked -- 25 and they do not know they are going to be smoking 1 30 years later. it is a dangerous -- it is a 2 dangerous road. 3 and i remember mr. boyce had a drawbridge 4 up in his opening statement. and i looked at 5 it. it looks to me like it is a castle with a 6 drawbridge up and you cannot overcome that. 7 i say it is not a drawbridge up. the 8 bridge is out and the kids that are lured over 9 that bridge that is out end up in the river of 10 addiction and end up down the stream -- 11 mr. boyce: objection, your honor. 12 the court: thank you. 13 mr. boyce: improper argument. harm to 14 others, no connection to dale moyer. 15 the court: thank you. 16 that objection is overruled, counsel. 17 mr. boyce: thank you. 18 it is not a proper basis for punitive 19 damages. 20 the court: thank you. that objection is 21 overruled. 22 mr. schlesinger: they end up going 23 downstream to that river of addiction, 24 ultimately to demise and to be replacement 25 smokers. so to me the bridge is out. 1 and here is what you do when it comes to 2 thinking about kids, tender age, things like 3 that. 4 if you have the package, products, 5 remember, it was not until 1985 that there was 6 ever a warning on a side of a cigarette that 7 said it caused lung cancer, emphysema. before 8 1985 never said that. never said that. said 9 it may be hazardous, is hazardous, but never 10 said how it was hazardous . 11 but the kids that can get addicted of 12 this at a young age is -- that is the thing 13 that is reprehensible. we will talk about it some 14 more. 15 there is a claude teague document, 16 pt01040, is great. realistically, if our 17 company is to survive and prosper over the 18 long-term, we must get our share of the youth 19 market. 20 by the way, how do you warn a child, if 21 you really want to warn a chile? 22 if a child is on a diving board and he is 23 getting ready to go into a pool that is empty, 24 and they jump off the diving board and the pool 25 is empty and there is a sign that says "no 1 diving." 2 are people that really want to protect 3 the child, that really want to warn a 4 12-year-old or 14-year-old, let us say, going to 5 see him walk by that sign and say, hey, you have 6 been warned. 7 or are they going to say, "stop!" are 8 they going to yell, are they going to run to 9 try to get to the ladder to grab the kid? are 10 they going to do everything they can to stop 11 the child? 12 the message coming out from tobacco 13 companies was one of seduction, lower your 14 fears, steal your fears, anything to make you 15 not worry about smoking. keep on smoking. 16 here, this is claude teague. claude 17 teague rose to the ranks of rjr. he was senior 18 there. there for his entire career. they said 19 something like a few stupid people said a few 20 stupid things. 21 this is a master plan, a brilliantly 22 conceived conspiracy that lasted for decades 23 and made untold amounts of money. and this is 24 what claude teague said, in his youth marketing 25 document in evidence. 1 it says: we have deliberately played down 2 the role of nicotine. this is in the '70s. 3 hence, the nonsmoker has little or no knowledge 4 of what satisfactions it may offer him. no 5 desire to try it. 6 then he said: we must convince him of 7 the wholly irrational reasons that he should 8 try smoking, in the hope that he will, for 9 himself, then discover the real satisfactions 10 obtainable. 11 now, you are entitled to decide whether 12 this kind of conduct is reprehensible, and 13 you are entitled to look at that and ask what 14 they are doing with satisfactions we know means 15 addiction. and you can say to yourself, and i 16 submit that that is true, that that is cold 17 blooded, for a youth; that you are going to lure 18 him with something, and then he will find the 19 real satisfactions obtainable. 20 and then there is that -- this year's 21 crop. they call youth "the crop." 22 now, has anything changed? here are the 23 replacement smokers. that is kind of a callous 24 way of referring to 12-year-old, 13 year-old, 25 14-year-old, replacement smokers. 1 and then you have got over here, as 2 recently as 2010, this is in evidence. there 3 is a pediatrics article in evidence. these are 4 the barbie camels, camel no. 9, light and 5 luscious. 6 there is an article in pediatrics saying 7 when that campaign came out, the percentage of 8 girls that were 12 to 16 years old that were 9 interested in these cigarettes doubled; and 10 that the result in the pediatric scientific 11 article in evidence was that this was marketing 12 to youth, to children. and they were bypassing 13 it. and that was in '07, '08. 14 for a period of time, rj stopped 15 advertising in magazines. but we talked about 16 entitlement to punitive damages. have they 17 mitigated? have they changed? 18 now, they say: well, as long as there is a 19 certain percentage of the readership over 18, 20 we can advertise. this is glamour. it is in 21 evidence. that is one direction. 22 this is known as a boy band, the one 23 direction. people know that as a boy band. 24 here is the organic hundred percent 25 additive-free tobacco, "organic" being the 1 modern health reassurance of our times. 2 even though it has menthol, which is an 3 additive. and if you go here, this is in 4 evidence, you will see it. these are the kinds 5 of glamorous ads that they have in these 6 magazines today. dozens of magazines since 7 middle of 2013 come out. you can pick them up. 8 last week's people had these ads. you can pick 9 them up anywhere. 10 inspiration, where a moment becomes a 11 memory. discover the unexpected. celebrate 12 the unforgettable. 13 it is glamorizing smoking, and it is 14 glamorizing smoking in magazines that get to 15 youth. 16 one of the things we heard in opening 17 from mr. boyce -- i want to do this real 18 quick -- was something about dale said it is 19 going to happen to the other guy. that is why 20 he kept smoking, because he had been warned, he 21 knew it was bad, but he figured it would happen 22 to the other guy. 23 there was scientific basis behind that. 24 and i did not want to leave the impression that 25 dale was some sort of callous individual that 1 wished something bad on somebody else. 2 could not be -- to the contrary. the ftc 3 explained -- consumers incorrectly believed 4 that while smoking may be hazardous to others, 5 it is not hazardous to themselves. 6 that was part of the campaign the tobacco 7 companies tried to put on people so they would 8 be confused. and dr. seidman, he said this on 9 his own during cross-examination: smokers have 10 self-exempting beliefs because they are afraid. 11 they do not think it is relative to him. 12 that is the nature of the addict. it is 13 the denial of the addict. it is the 14 psychological crutch that the tobacco companies 15 wanted to give the addict, so they could keep 16 smoking. because if you keep smoking, you keep 17 selling. they never wanted their smokers to 18 quit smoking. they did everything they could 19 to keep their smokers smoking and everything 20 they could to stop them from quitting. 21 it was like operation stumbling block. 22 if you want to get an addict to quit, it has to 23 be a clear, concise, direct, red hot and 24 nonstop message. you cannot give them a place 25 to retreat in the world of denial, or they 1 will not get off the drug. 2 and even what is more, how about with 3 tobacco? it was not until 1988 that the surgeon 4 general finally figured out this is as 5 addictive as heroin and cocaine. 6 it was a secret addiction. people did 7 not know even how addicted they were. they 8 did not understand it. do you think dale moyer 9 knew he was taking a drug in his body when he 10 was breathing those cigarettes 40 or 60 times a 11 day, that he was getting direct hits of 12 nicotine to his brain and a rewired brain since 13 he was nine years old? 14 anyway, it is all about the nicotine. 15 look at this. here is one of the 16 dr. tamil (phonetic), one of the big 17 scientists. let us determine the minimum 18 nicotine required to keep the normal smoker 19 hooked. right here they know people cannot stop 20 smoking. they use levulinic acid. 21 do you think my client knew they were 22 using levulinic acid? 23 who ain't for more money? do we really 24 want to tout cigarette smoking as a drug? it 25 is, of course, but there are dangerous fda 1 implications for going beyond these walls. and 2 yet, when the fda got them in 2009, dr. proctor 3 said they have had no effective regulation 4 whatsoever in the last five years. 5 mr. boyce: objection. 6 the court: excuse me. 7 mr. boyce: misstates federal law, 8 misstates the reach of the fda's authority. 9 misstates the evidence in this case. 10 the court: thank you. 11 ladies and gentlemen, you are to rely on 12 the evidence as you understand it in this case. 13 thank you. proceed. 14 mr. schlesinger: may it please the 15 court. 16 so, and then, of course, what they said 17 internally. these are secret internal 18 documents that jed wilson, je wilson, one of 19 the big guys up there in the companies. these 20 were all well-regarded individuals. as 21 dr. proctor said, the cullmans were a 22 celebrated family. 23 claude teague, may he rest in peace, was 24 a beloved member of the rjr family. nobody was 25 censured, nobody was punished. you will not 1 see in evidence one single piece of paper 2 anywhere from their internal documents that 3 comes out and says, oh, we cannot do this. this 4 is wrong. this is something we have to 5 retract. i have to censure this guy. 6 that does not exist anywhere. this was a 7 business plan. this was a model business plan 8 that has cost 20 million americans since 1964. 9 and as doctor -- 10 so anyway, they knew they would go out of 11 business if they did not have the essential 12 chemical compound, nicotine. they knew that. 13 and then merrell dow. i'll do this real 14 quick. these documents are in evidence. big 15 chemical company. they came out in the early 16 '80s with nicotine gum, and they were 17 boycotted. one of the members of the 18 conspiracy boycotted them because they did not 19 like what merrell -- what nicotine gum was all 20 about. because they did not want their smokers 21 quitting, and they did not want somebody coming 22 out with a product. 23 so they actually impaired and impeded the 24 entry into the marketplace of smoking cessation 25 aids to help people. 1 mr. boyce: objection, your honor. 2 mr. schlesinger: it is in evidence. 3 the court: excuse me, counsel. 4 mr. boyce: philip morris, harm to 5 others, no connection to mr. moyer. 6 the court: thank you. those objections 7 are overruled. 8 ladies and gentlemen, i have instructions 9 or anything about reprehensibility and what 10 import, it is in the jury instructions. you 11 rely on your recollection of what the evidence 12 is, and you rely on my jury instructions. 13 proceed. 14 mr. schlesinger: so, remember, he read 15 to you the act of one conspirator in 16 furtherance of the conspiracy are acts of all 17 the conspirators in furtherance of the -- 18 mr. boyce: objection. that misstates 19 the jury instructions. the jury instructions 20 in this case are for statements and omissions 21 only. there is nothing about acts in this 22 case. that is a misstatement. 23 the court: thank you. 24 objection noted. overruled. 25 proceed, counsel. 1 mr. schlesinger: may i proceed? 2 in any event, they felt the nature of 3 nicorette gum was offensive to their business. 4 and dale, remember, he tried the gum. 5 and this shows -- that is youth. i'm 6 going to skip that. 7 this talks about they knew internally. 8 there was no doubt in the '50s and '60s that 9 cigarettes caused cancer. they knew that. 10 even before the business comes up about 11 nicotine addiction in the late '80s, this 12 business about causing cancer, every class of 13 smoke, there was no evidence to the contrary, 14 and they knew that it had the unattractive side 15 effect. and remember, they promised we will go 16 out of business. 17 but here is what they said amongst 18 themselves, because they celebrated their 19 business: it is fortunate for us that 20 cigarettes are a habit they cannot break, and 21 would not it be wonderful if our company was the 22 first once to produce a cancer-free cigarette? 23 but that is what they were saying. you 24 let the scientists do the work and you keep 25 going, enjoy. but they were concerned. if we 1 smoked one cigarette less a day, it would be 40 2 billion a year. they were worried about losing 3 are business and profits. 4 and of course they got together. they 5 did the frank statement, they talked about 6 that. i'm not going to do it again. they made 7 a lot of promises to the country that were not 8 true. and they said, in this case you will see 9 at least 11 or a dozen times dr. proctor talked 10 about, they promised they would stop making it. 11 well they -- if they had told the truth 12 and been truthful about that promise, what a 13 different world we would live in today. 14 and cannot you see dale moyer saying, if 15 he was here before you today: if i knew now 16 what i learned in this courtroom that you guys 17 learned in the last couple weeks, if i knew now 18 what i did not know -- if i knew then what i 19 know now, would i ever be a smoker? would i 20 have been able not to start, or done definitely 21 everything i could to quit? 22 and again, the doubt and confusion. they 23 employed a single strategy, defend itself on 24 three fronts: litigation. it was brilliantly 25 conceived and executed. they won battles. but 1 it was always a holding strategy. they held 2 dale all along. he was in their holding 3 strategy, and the whole organization was a 4 front and a shield. it was nothing to do with 5 smoking and health. 6 telling -- not telling the truth about 7 disease. here is what they said, and this 8 addresses something that was said in opening. 9 that was that paper where they said there is 10 cancer in every part of smoke. you burn that 11 cigarette, you inhale that smoke. there is 12 cancer everywhere, and we cannot filter it. 13 but when they sent the information to the 14 surgeon general, it says: we did not find 15 anything that is unhealthy. we did not find any 16 cancer in there. and by the way, we will filter 17 it out if there is something in there. 18 i do not know what that is. here it is. 19 oh, this is the kind of information they wanted 20 to give to the surgeon general, to be as 21 burdensome and vague and irksome to the reader. 22 they were looking to confuse, confuse the 23 public health authority, confuse america. 24 and what did r.j. reynolds do? they 25 would say in their public statements: we do not 1 want that -- surgeon general, we do not want the 2 public being hoodwinked. they are unjustifying 3 emotional campaigns and health scares. it is a 4 gross insult to the scientific community. 5 there is no honest disagreement among experts on 6 the effects of smoking. it is all false. 7 the number one problem is the extent to 8 which these officials knowingly mislead the 9 american public. there is an old saying: if 10 you do not have a leg to stand on, break the 11 other guy's leg. 12 so they undertook a campaign to knock out 13 the surgeon general and -- go ahead and play 14 that -- and create an atmosphere of doubt and 15 uncertainty, which works great on guys like 16 dale. 17 18 19 follows:) 20 voice: it was suspect from the start. 21 hew secretary califano launched his 22 anti-smoking campaign a year ago with all the 23 zeal of a reformed sinner. 24 and now, in an apparent attempt to bring 25 some science to the side of his new evangelism, 1 the former three-pack-a-day secretary told the 2 surgeon general: prepare a new report. 3 "its issuance," an internal hew memo 4 said, and i quote, "would be a media event." 5 closed quote. 6 turning a significant health question 7 into a publicity stunt is an insult to serious 8 science. america, beware if joe califano ever 9 gives up drinking or other pleasure pursuits, 10 even the most intimate. 11 (video clip concluded.) 12 mr. schlesinger: so they went ahead and 13 they would talk about how they preempted the 14 surgeon general's report. he would announce 15 it. 16 they would get out in front of him, they 17 would capture the media spotlight and preempt 18 with a first strike conference. and they had 19 speakers covering millions of miles and logging 20 hundreds of hours on the air and hundreds of 21 appearances, because they were letting the 22 world know, hey, the surgeon general does not 23 know what he is talking about. it is an open 24 question. no one knows what causes lung 25 cancer. just keep on smoking. 1 and that river of cash kept on flowing. 2 then when he finally came out and said, in 3 1988, and surgeon general koop, i think you saw 4 him, hey, this is as addictive as heroin and 5 cocaine. people have to realize that. 6 even doctors were not hearing him. 7 remember, doctors used to smoke. claims that 8 cigarettes are addictive is irresponsible and 9 scare tactics. that is what they called the 10 important announcements from the surgeon 11 general. 12 '88 is in evidence and '89 is in 13 evidence. and '89 says it is not free choice. 14 because when you start smoking you get 15 addicted, it is not a free choice. 16 but addiction is their business. the 17 cigarette is defective, unreasonably dangerous. 18 how could you make it less defective and 19 unreasonably dangerous? make it not addictive. 20 raise the ph so you are not inhaling it deeply 21 into your lungs. but they will not do that. 22 and then they go through here, subjects 23 to be avoided. 24 mr. woods, your head is in the way of my 25 slide. 1 mr. woods: sorry. 2 mr. schlesinger: thanks. 3 attempts to relate human disease to 4 smoking, subject to be avoided. 5 return to your original position. 6 and this is what the center for tobacco 7 research was doing. they were not doing any 8 good for anybody. they were a front 9 organization. 10 and here's what is really interesting. i 11 will do this super quick with ya. some doc 12 named abood was doing some research. he came 13 up with, sort of like merrell dow, an 14 antagonist to nicotine. or he thought he might 15 be able to come up with a chemical compound 16 that would block the nicotine. 17 they said: if he comes up with a way to 18 block the nicotine, you will have the potential 19 of putting the tobacco manufacturers out of 20 business. so they would not fund the study and 21 they blocked it. 22 but they said right there, if the 23 progress this guy is claiming is what it is, we 24 are in the progress of digging our own grave. 25 again, anthropomorphizing themselves. 1 mr. boyce: same objection, to philip 2 morris -- 3 the court: overruled. 4 mr. boyce: -- documents and the 5 conspiracy instructions in this case. 6 mr. schlesinger: and now remember, if 7 one in five deaths in this country are related 8 to premature death from cigarette smoking, 9 picture in your mind what it would be like if 10 every single cemetery in the united states had 11 a little "no smoking" sticker on one out of 12 every five headstones. 13 i'm trying to think of ways to imagine 14 numbers that numb, because when you talk about 15 a few people dying, everybody knows about it. 16 when you talk about 20 million, it starts to 17 become numbing. yet it is the number one killer 18 in our country. 19 this i read to you. you know about that. 20 this was in 1980, by the way. remember 21 in '88 the surgeon general came out with the 22 warning that it was addictive? 23 in 1980 they were still worried about it. 24 they knew the public health authority was 25 coming out with this. and it still took 1 another eight years to get out, because they 2 had great powers. dr. proctor said they could 3 undermine and slow down the information getting 4 out to the public. 5 this is teague. he admitted that what 6 they did was -- the pharmaceutical industry. a 7 cigarette is a nicotine delivery device. do 8 not think of the cigarette as the product. the 9 cigarette is the package. the product is 10 nicotine. 11 and then all through here they sew doubt, 12 confusion, deceit. they said: doubt is our 13 product, because it is a means of establishing a 14 controversy. 15 the key word is confusion. anything we 16 could do to confirm that will work to our 17 advantage. 18 we have got to give these smokers a 19 psychological crutch to begin smoking, and if 20 it was not for the tirc, we would be in 21 deplorable position. it is been a successful 22 defensive operation. 23 look what they say here. this is in 24 evidence, pt05837: nothing we can say can 25 adversely affect our litigation position. for 1 purposes of litigation, the industry is not 2 willing to concede anything. 3 in the litigation venue we will require 4 the plaintiffs to prove causation, both legally 5 and scientifically. we intend to play hard 6 ball with the victims of cigarette smoking when 7 they press their claims in the courtroom. 8 this is the industry's ultimate public 9 relations sham. 10 our position continues to mislead the 11 public, with a wink. 12 at the end there, it is not shame, it is 13 sham. and it is the ultimate public relations 14 sham. you will see the document, pt05837. you 15 will see it. you can read it. 16 i do not know if i want to listen to this 17 guy. is it the montage? 18 technician: i think it is the montage. 19 mr. schlesinger: play it. 20 21 22 follows:) 23 voice: (inaudible.) 24 we will cooperate in every way. 25 voice: well, obviously, a filter takes 1 out certain tar and nicotine. 2 mr. schlesinger: (in open court.) 3 faster, if you can. go to the next part. 4 voice: (inaudible.) 5 because when, as, and if any ingredient 6 in cigarette smoke is identified as being 7 injurious to human health, we are confident 8 that we can eliminate that ingredient. 9 voice: do you believe the cigarettes are 10 safe? have they been proved to be safe, 11 mr. cullen? 12 voice: i believe they have not been 13 proved to be unsafe. 14 we do talk to the question of whether or 15 not cigarettes are hazardous. we do not 16 believe that cigarettes are hazardous. we 17 do not accept that. because when, as, and if 18 any ingredient in cigarette smoke is identified 19 as being injurious to human health, we are 20 confident that we can eliminate that 21 ingredient. 22 voice: do you believe that cigarettes 23 are safe? have they been proven to be safe, 24 mr. cullen? 25 voice: i believe they have not been 1 proved to be unsafe. and i concluded from that 2 report that it is true, that babies born to 3 women who smoke are smaller. but they are just 4 as healthy as babies born to women to do not 5 smoke. and some women would prefer having 6 smaller babies. 7 (video clip concluded.) 8 mr. schlesinger: before we play this, 9 the industry is based on deception and nicotine 10 addiction, and the basic bottom line is, with 11 youth being where the seed corn is where people 12 start smoking, the design of cigarettes, highly 13 engineered legal nicotine delivery device to 14 make it as easy as is humanly possible to begin 15 smoking an as hard as humanly possible to quit. 16 why should it be so hard? 17 and the industry claimed during all those 18 years it did not know, it did not know, it was 19 unknown. and now you hear them make what i 20 call the big pitch and say: everybody knew. 21 everybody knew. 22 dale moyer should have known what they 23 did not know and what they refuse to admit. 24 when all he did was be the perfect customer 25 they wanted in the era of innocence. well, by 1 the time the information was getting out there, 2 he was terribly addicted. 3 go ahead and play that. 4 5 6 follows:) 7 voice: here's the controversy about 8 cigarettes. in the 91st congress, a house 9 committee heard testimony from leading experts 10 on smoking and health. the record shows that 11 most of the country's most respected doctors 12 openly challenged anti-cigarette claims. 13 voice: and i'd have to disagree with you 14 in that we do not know what causes the ailments 15 that have been attributed to cigarette smoking. 16 voice: cigarette smoking does not cause 17 cancer; yes or no? 18 voice: it is not known whether 19 cigarettes cause cancer. has not been causally 20 established. 21 voice: cigarette smoking -- no causal 22 relationship between cigarette smoking and 23 emphysema? 24 voice: despite all of the research to 25 date, there has been no causal link 1 established. 2 voice: the case is still open. the jury 3 has not come in. 4 voice: it may not be harmful? you are 5 not convinced? 6 voice: it may be, or it may not be. we 7 do not know. 8 voice: do cigarettes cause cancer? i 9 do not know if they do not. 10 voice: i'm not in a position to give you 11 a does or does not. 12 voice: the medical experts agree that 13 smoking causes emphysema. do you agree? 14 voice: it may. 15 voice: they agree that smoking causes 16 lung cancer. do you agree? 17 voice: it may. 18 voice: we have looked at the data, and 19 the data -- 20 (video clip concluded.) 21 mr. schlesinger: you have seen it. i'm 22 only going to go a few more minutes with this. 23 but the -- they worked out a plan. the 24 plan worked. my client was a victim of the 25 plan. he belongs in the class. he deserves a 1 right, as a conduit, so you guys can go to the 2 next phase, find that these folks not only hurt 3 him, probably killed him, and leave behind 4 folks that are grieving, compensate them fairly 5 with whatever you think, and then go to the 6 important question, which is really the 7 question that i want to talk about. and have 8 we shown by clear and convincing evidence that 9 this is reprehensible conduct? does not meet 10 the bounds of human decency, and merits a 11 strong expression of moral condemnation? 12 so this is just manipulating nicotine, 13 this is sales correlated with nicotine, this is 14 when they got that, you know, freebased 15 nicotine, they got more sales out of more 16 nicotine. 17 these were all the opportunities over the 18 years for the tobacco companies to come forward 19 and tell the truth. they could have come 20 forward and told the truth. they could have 21 taken it upon themselves to say we are not going 22 to let 21-year-olds -- anyone under 21 get the 23 cigarettes. 24 they could have helped people. they 25 could have said, you know what? you have been 1 our customers since you are 14, 16 years old, 2 you are 30 years old. the guy that is 30, says i 3 want to start a family, comes to them. they 4 could have helped him quit cigarettes and had 5 cessation and still had a business. 6 they could go back to a non-defective 7 product, a cigar-like product. they could go 8 to a non-addictive product. 9 so, when it comes to choice, it is a 10 two-way street. my client had choices, they 11 had choices. for class membership, it is only 12 whether or not he was dependent upon that drug. 13 then you can go to comparative fault 14 relative -- that mr. hammer talked about. he 15 talked about compensatory damages. 16 i'm not allowed to talk to you about 17 punitive damages or an amount that would be 18 fair and appropriate until you decide that 19 punitive damages may be warranted, and that is 20 the last question. 21 and there is dale. this is a picture i 22 always liked of dale. i like that picture of 23 dale. 24 so this is what it says. that they are 25 warranted if you find by clear and convincing 1 evidence that the defendant was guilty of 2 intentional misconduct which was a substantial 3 legal cause of mr. moyer's smoking-related 4 illness. 5 so with everything they did, the kind of 6 thing that makes them guilty. and this is -- 7 this is in evidence. it is the 1964 life 8 magazine back when the surgeon general's report 9 was coming out. and there is a "government 10 report nails down smoking hazards. verdict on 11 cigarettes: guilty as charged." this is in 12 evidence. 13 and i submit to you that it is 1964. and 14 we are here 50 years later. and as far as this 15 particular decision that you all can make -- 16 because i wanted to come up with something -- i 17 wanted to say something beautiful and american 18 and meaningful, and instead i read a bunch of 19 boards to you, and i'm sorry for that. 20 but they are guilty. and the clear and 21 convincing evidence shows this does not meet 22 with the bounds of human decency. 23 we ask you when you get to that last 24 question, check off yes. we will come back, 25 talk to you for a little bit more. and you all 1 can say to them in the strongest possible 2 terms, we do not want you to do this. 3 clear and convincing evidence is that 4 which is precise, explicit, lacking in 5 confusion and of such weight that it produces a 6 firm belief or conviction, without hesitation, 7 about the matter in issue. 8 and there is no illusion about the 9 confusion. there is no doubt about the doubt. 10 so the fact that they produced confusion for 11 decades does not get them off the hook in this 12 courtroom, because now you have seen what some 13 folks thought they knew, but now you know. 14 you come in here, many -- many are 15 called, but few are chosen. we went through a 16 lot of jurors. we chose you. and you might 17 have thought you knew. but now that you have 18 entered into the college of tobacco knowledge 19 for these last three weeks, now you know. 20 and when you consider whether or not 21 punitive damages are warranted, and you want to 22 know about reprehensibility and whether a day 23 of reckoning, punishment for past misdeeds is 24 justifiable in this case, you may consider 25 similar harms suffered by other persons not 1 parties to this lawsuit in assessing the 2 reprehensibility or the wrongness of the 3 defendants' acts as proven in this case. 4 that is why you heard so much evidence 5 from dr. proctor, a day and a half laying out 6 the entirety of the conspiracy, how it was 7 formed, how it was enacted, how it was a 8 holding strategy. how it maintained all the 9 way through and how successful it was. 10 how many cigarettes they are able to sell 11 to so many people, despite intentionally 12 knowing full well that their customers were 13 dying and calling the youth that would pick up 14 the habit and pick up the addiction to sustain 15 their profits replacement smokers. 16 and what did they say? because the 17 holding strategy is one that you know 18 eventually you are going to get caught. 19 they said: our basic position in the 20 cigarette industry, in the cigarette 21 controversy is subject to the charge and may be 22 subject to a finding that we are making false or 23 misleading statements to promote the sale of 24 cigarettes. 25 we are not going to play this. you have 1 already played it. 2 technician: that is the end. 3 mr. schlesinger: this guy here. that 4 guy, his fault. seven, eight years old. 5 that is the guy. he had a chance? what chance 6 did he have? 7 so i hope i stitched it together for you, 8 and if you see it our way, i hope not only will 9 you follow through this difficult verdict form, 10 through the compensatory damages, but get to 11 the question that to me is the most important 12 question and reason why we are here, which is 13 the concept of punishment, the day of reckoning 14 for them. 15 and if you do, we will come back for 16 another day or so, and we will talk about it a 17 little bit more. 18 i ask you to give the same kind of 19 attention to defense during their closings that 20 you have given to me. 21 but i do get one more chance to talk to 22 you. so i will say this. save a little room 23 for dessert. thank you. 17 mr. schlesinger: please the court, 18 counsel. 19 okay, folks. home stretch. 20 my dad was a trial lawyer for really -- 21 many years. he is in his 65th year of 22 practicing law. 23 he tells a story about an old-timey, 24 tough judge in broward county. and we had some 25 old-timey, tough guys back then, where he 1 explained to me, when you are in the courtroom, 2 in front of that trial judge, you are in front 3 of the most powerful man on the earth. 4 and these early judges, in the '60s, they 5 knew who they were and they knew what they 6 were. and, one time, dad was working in a 7 case, and they were getting ready to give, i 8 guess, opening statement or -- or, no, picking 9 a jury, or something like that, and dad's like, 10 we can break for lunch, judge, because it was 11 getting on 1:00, and the jury was antsy and 12 they were hungry; and the judge said, well, 13 we will break for lunch when you are done with 14 your voir dire examination, mr. schlesinger. 15 so he moved it along. 16 and that is what i'm going to try to do 17 with you. and i would like you to start by 18 looking at the findings in this case, the engle 19 findings from -- i guess, 36, if you would put 20 it up -- and let us keep our eye on the ball, 21 because i heard a lot of things that are what i 22 consider to be nothing more than denials of the 23 truth -- 24 mr. woods: objection. 25 mr. schlesinger: -- of why we are here. 1 the court: counsel, this is argument. 2 proceed. 3 mr. schlesinger: and, remember, we are 4 bound by -- 5 the jury instruction says, these findings 6 are if -- as if you found them yourselves. 7 now, if you tell a lie to a public health 8 authority, and submit a bunch of distraction 9 research to them and a bunch of phony baloney 10 nonsense that does not get to the question of 11 smoking and disease as part of a conspiracy to 12 keep people smoking, and you get away with it, 13 and the healthcare -- the innocent national 14 cancer institute healthcare official writes 15 back, hey, thanks for all this information you 16 sent, because that is a salutation, and you 17 conned them, you do not get credit for that. 18 if, in the '70s and '80s, you conned the 19 surgeon general, the national cancer institute, 20 and the federal trade commission into saying, 21 if you are going to smoke, smoke light 22 cigarettes, and then billions were adver -- 23 billions of dollars were advertised, showing 24 how light cigarettes deliver less tar and 25 nicotine, and that fraud is not exposed until 1 the national cancer institute does it in the 2 year 2000, in this -- in this monograph, and 3 explains very clearly that that is exactly what 4 it was, fooling the machines and using the data 5 to fool smokers -- 6 this is page 233: filters and cigarette 7 papers were developed starting in the '50s that 8 air conditioned the smoke by diluting the smoke 9 column with side stream air. when smoked by 10 the machines, as in the ftc tests, low-tar, 11 low-nicotine numbers resulted. a desirable 12 outcome for promotional purposes, but higher 13 yields were ingested by real smokers, a 14 desirable outcome for maintaining nicotine 15 addiction. 16 my client, you will see from the 17 instructions, in terms of reliance, does not 18 have to have a direct connection between a 19 particular ad and his behavior. his behavior 20 is the reliance, in context with the 21 conspiracy. 22 now, lorillard, liggett, philip morris, 23 r.j. reynolds -- 24 mr. boyce: r.j. reynolds. 25 mr. schlesinger: -- i was not going to 1 forget -- they bought american tobacco company, 2 brown & williamson, and they assumed the 3 liabilities -- these folks were -- 4 not these folks. these folks are 5 lawyers. they may be nice guys, but they are 6 not rjr, they are not the tobacco company. 7 they can bring any witness they want down here, 8 but they did not bring -- 9 mr. woods: objection. 10 the court: excuse me. sustained. 11 mr. schlesinger: they can choose to 12 bring any witness, and i'll tell you -- 13 mr. woods: objection. 14 the court: sustained. 15 mr. schlesinger: you did not hear from 16 them, on any evidence -- 17 mr. woods: objection. 18 mr. schlesinger: -- from any -- 19 the court: sustained. 20 mr. woods: burden of proof. 21 the court: why do not you move on, 22 counsel. 23 mr. schlesinger: all of the witnesses 24 that testified, dr. civantos, dr. policzer, 25 dr. wolek, who was not an expert, he was a 1 treating, dr. rozynes, who signed the death 2 certificate was a treating, dr. civantos was a 3 treating, right? dr. policzer was a treating 4 doctor. 5 what does that mean? back at the time, 6 in the '90s and the 2000s, those guys were men 7 on the street, watching something unfold. they 8 have credibility. they have the unbiased 9 approach that comes from men that were just 10 trying to take care of a patient. they were 11 just trying to take care of mr. moyer. 12 you heard no evidence to the contrary. 13 everybody that testified -- 14 and we just went and brought, for the 15 most part -- 16 except for daniel seidman, a true 17 authority on addiction, who had never been in a 18 courtroom before, and came in here and told you 19 that dale moyer was highly addicted. they came 20 right in and told you, this man was addicted, 21 these addictions contributed to cause the 22 disease, that is what drives the smoking, and 23 that is the only thing that matters with being a 24 class member. 25 and they blurred some distinctions here, 1 in terms of could he quit, and whether or not 2 he could quit, and that goes to the question of 3 fault. that is the next set of questions on the 4 comparative negligence form. 5 and if you think that he should have quit 6 harder, more -- he could have quit more, you 7 can adjust the percentage of his relative 8 responsibility any way you want. but ability 9 to quit has nothing to do with what the 10 unrebutted testimony -- 11 mr. woods: objection. 12 mr. boyce: objection, your honor. 13 the court: overruled. 14 mr. boyce: class membership -- 15 mr. schlesinger: the unrebutted 16 testimony of his addiction-driven disease, a 17 heavy, heavy smoker, smoking for the nicotine 18 that you know their business is built on, is 19 his entitlement to be in the class. 20 similarly, they did not present any 21 evidence to counter the fact that everybody, 22 including dr. mascarenhas, said he was 23 addicted, and said that his chronic obstructive 24 pulmonary disease was in the class period, was 25 before 1996. that is unrebutted. there is 1 no -- nothing to the contrary. 2 mr. boyce may have made some of his own 3 opinions that -- 4 remember, the court says, it is not law 5 when the lawyer says it; it is got to be 6 evidence in the case. 7 dr. civantos was a great witness. take 8 what he had to say. he said, this man does not 9 get parotid surgery to save him because he 10 cannot withstand it because of lung disease. 11 and that is what dr. alvarez told him. i 12 can quote the testimony, if i can find it, but 13 there is no doubt the man was not a candidate 14 for surgery. 15 there is no doubt the chronic obstructive 16 pulmonary disease and his inability to breathe 17 was a contributing cause. 18 they said, oh, skin cancer is a terrible, 19 terrible disease. well, so is lung cancer, and 20 so is emphysema, which is a severe form of 21 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 22 that is what dale suffered from, to the point 23 where, in 1999, when he saw dr. mascarenhas, 24 his major problem was problems with breathing. 25 in 2003, he went on supplemental oxygen, 1 which he used as he needed it. so this -- 2 and then, in 2000 -- by 2008, he was 3 described as a respiratory cripple by 4 dr. mascarenhas. the man had a very severe set 5 of diseases from smoking. there is no -- and 6 there is just no evidence to the contrary. 7 the -- the -- 8 this instruction says: each defendant is 9 legally responsible for every act by each of 10 the co-conspirators taken in furtherance of 11 their agreement to conceal or omit material 12 information regarding the health effects of 13 cigarette smoking or the addictive nature of 14 smoking cigarettes. 15 these companies and organizations include 16 the defendants, as well as philip morris usa, 17 brown & williamson, american tobacco company, 18 the tobacco industry research committee, the 19 council for tobacco research usa, and the 20 tobacco institute, and rjr and lorillard and 21 liggett. 22 they were all part of the conspiracy. so 23 they concealed and omitted material information 24 not otherwise known or available. i went 25 through a lot of their internal documents that 1 demonstrate it. 2 and these books here are replete with 3 data about it, and i encourage you to look at 4 them. 5 if you want to look at something, look at 6 page 105 of surgeon general '10. there is an 7 entire chapter on nicotine addiction. that is 8 all smoking is. it is nicotine addiction. 9 think about it -- 10 i said yesterday, reductio ad absurdum, 11 reducing to the absurd. i said it was an 12 aristotelian sort of philosophical form of 13 logical analysis. 14 under their standard, nobody could ever 15 be a class member, because everybody could 16 quit. therefore, they cannot be a class member, 17 if class membership is based on quitting, which 18 his honor, who gave you the law, did not say 19 that it was. 20 so, you know, they just do not seem -- 21 they are using different language. and 22 the law says -- 23 just like they tried to say, he caused -- 24 his heart disease was not the cause -- smoking 25 was not the cause of his heart disease; smoking 1 was a cause of his heart disease. 2 and if we go to -- 3 i know where it is. 4 this is what i want to do. i think it is 5 page 353 of the book. hammer, if you want to 6 try to find it for me, okay? 7 let me see if i can get it here. 8 there is a section here on page 355, 9 tobacco use and cardiovascular disease. and it 10 explains that each risk factor is 11 multiplicative of the other risk factors. 12 if you have one risk factor, it is 2x; if 13 you have two risk factors, it is 4x; and that 14 tobacco cigarette smoking is the number one 15 risk factor. and that is what mascarenhas said 16 and that is what dr. civantos said. 17 it is another way into class membership. 18 he absolutely had it manifested before 1996. 19 you can look in this book. it is an absolute 20 combination, a lumper. it is a multiple cause 21 that contributes to cause the disease. smoking 22 is one of the contributing causes. that is -- 23 that is what is covered by the law in the case. 24 they talked about this magazine. it is in 25 evidence, you will look at it. it is full of 1 advertisements for cigarettes. front and back, 2 there must be four or five full-page 3 advertisements for cigarettes in here. and 4 you will see it. the -- 5 when they talked about the philip morris 6 documents do not apply to them, they do. 7 everything -- everything the tirc does applies. 8 baron (sic), do you have that clip about 9 the tirc, please? 10 technician: sure. 11 (the video clip was played and taken 12 down to the best of the reporter's ability as 13 follows:) 14 voice: that brings us to the here and 15 now. you may take for granted a great many 16 aspects of the tobacco institute, if you knew 17 of them at all. most organizations would feel 18 at a disadvantage with such a low profile, but 19 this is entirely appropriate to our work, since 20 most of what we do takes place out of sight of 21 the public and the rest of the industry, even 22 though our concerns are very much those of the 23 public and the industry. 24 (video clip concluded.) 25 mr. schlesinger: mr. moyer is not 1 supposed to know what they are doing. he is just 2 supposed to be part of that information 3 environment that affects him. and he was. 4 mr. boyce: objection, your honor, 5 improper argument. 6 the court: overruled. 7 mr. schlesinger: now, the reliance part 8 on the statements, remember, his actions spoke 9 louder than words. he followed the company 10 plan. 11 when they came up with the filters, which 12 were a fraud all along, the illusion of 13 filtration -- they even invented a fake, 14 color-changing filter that did not work -- they 15 knew all along, they knew well in advance of 16 the surgeon general -- they were light years 17 ahead of him -- they took advantage and wrapped 18 themselves in the surgeon general and the ftc's 19 approval, and finally the ftc came out -- i 20 showed you that press release in 2008 -- 21 saying, they can no longer wrap their shameful 22 marketing practices in an appearance of 23 approval by the federal government. we will no 24 longer be a smokescreen for them. 25 this here says that -- it is not just a 1 fact, but it is a concealment or an omission. 2 mr. boyce kept saying "statements," he did not 3 rely on a statement; but he relied on 4 statements and omissions. 5 his behavior was, when they came up with 6 filters, and kent was safer, he went to kent 7 because he thought it was safer. and that is a 8 stumbling block to actually trying to quit. 9 and those were the years before the concept of 10 addiction came out. the concept of addiction 11 did not come out until 1988. and, by the way -- 12 1985. 13 can i have the elmo? 14 in 1985, it never said addicted -- 15 "addictive" on it, never said "copd," never 16 has. the warning has not changed in the last 30 17 years, and the ftc says, the warnings are of no 18 effect. it is the beautiful advertising. the 19 warnings are worn out. that is what the ftc 20 says. it is in evidence. look closely. 21 zoom in on that, can you? 22 technician: yep. 23 mr. schlesinger: you see what that says? 24 that there is a zebra, my friends. you 25 do not -- 1 you will not see that anywhere, on a pack of 2 cigarettes anywhere. but right before the 3 master settlement agreement in 1996, bennett 4 lebow, the ceo of liggett, did come clean about 5 some things, and he is the one that unmasked a 6 lot of the conspiracy. 7 and he said, you know what? i'm going to 8 put, "warning: smoking is addictive" right on 9 the front of the pack. 10 and you know what? it is not there 11 anymore. philip morris bought this brand. you 12 cannot find it, and you cannot -- 13 mr. boyce: objection, your honor. 14 the court: it is not in evidence. 15 sustained. 16 mr. boyce: and move to strike. 17 mr. schlesinger: it is in evidence from 18 dr. proctor, who testified that -- 19 the court: ladies and gentlemen, you are 20 to rely on your own recollection of the facts. 21 mr. schlesinger: yes. and i will submit 22 to you that dr. proctor testified -- look at 23 your notes -- that if you buy a pack of 24 chesterfields today, you will not see "smoking 25 is addictive" on a pack of cigarettes, because 1 it is not there. 2 they can put anything they want on it, 3 but addiction is the center of their business. 4 they want to tell you that -- you want to talk 5 about dale moyer, this is about dale moyer? 6 sure. but it is also about them. 7 otherwise, you would not have heard all this 8 evidence about their conduct over the years. 9 otherwise, you would not have seen those 10 findings -- go back to the screen -- that talk 11 about their -- they are all culpable of fraud 12 and conspiracy to hide the truth, and it 13 would not be the kind of thing that is now a 14 major conclusion in the recent surgeon 15 general's report. the -- 16 a material fact is one that is of such 17 importance that mr. moyer would not have 18 acted -- acted as he did, but for the 19 concealment or omission. it is not necessary 20 for -- that a direct statement be made to 21 mr. moyer in order to give rise to the right to 22 rely upon the statement. it is immaterial 23 whether the statement passes through a direct 24 or circuitous channel in reaching mr. moyer, 25 provided the statement is made with the intent 1 that it reach him and he acted on it. 2 and remember what it says there: these 3 were meant to be relied on. they expected 4 folks -- 5 they expected folks, when they lied about 6 the addictive nature, that the public would 7 rely to their detriment. 8 and you did not hear one single reference 9 to an acknowledgment of any of these, when the 10 law says that you embrace them as if you found 11 them yourselves. 12 and they wanted to talk about mr. moyer, 13 but mr. moyer's one of all the similar 14 cigarette smokers, millions of them, that have 15 all fallen into the same trap. that is the 16 nature of the business. the -- 17 this slide (indicating). these slides, 18 please. 19 okay. i want to show you something. on 20 page 1 of surgeon general '10 -- 21 this is my reading copy. you will have a 22 clean copy. 23 on page i, roman numeral i, my copy, it 24 says: tobacco smoke damages every organ in the 25 body and causes disease and death. okay? 1 now, these records are in evidence. 2 remember we talked about the hip, okay? 3 and we know the man was -- was -- had a hip 4 injury. 5 take a look at this. when he came in for 6 the problem with his hip, he had aseptic 7 necrosis of the left hip, okay? 8 you know why? the patient does have a 9 history of long-term steroid use for bronchitis 10 and emphysema, aseptic necrosis of the left 11 hip. hip osteonecrosis. left hip 12 osteonecrosis. 13 go to the next one. where is the 14 surgical -- the surgical report? 15 go to the next one. 16 mr. woods: your honor, i would object. 17 it is not in evidence. 18 mr. schlesinger: this is all in 19 evidence. 20 mr. woods: any connection between -- 21 mr. schlesinger: excuse me. this is in 22 evidence. 23 mr. woods: can we have a sidebar? 24 the court: sure. 25 mr. schlesinger: can you hold my time, 1 judge, please? 2 mr. woods: it will be quick. 3 (the following discussion was held at 4 sidebar:) 5 the court: yes, sir, mr. woods? 6 mr. woods: your honor, i have an 7 objection because there is absolutely no 8 medical evidence in this case whatsoever 9 connecting his hip problems, his hip surgery, 10 with smoking. none. he cannot make this -- 11 the court: excuse me. i do not think the 12 emphasis was there. he is asking -- 13 these are medical records in evidence, 14 correct? 15 mr. schlesinger: yes. 16 the court: he is allowed to talk about 17 these. 18 (sidebar concluded.) 19 mr. schlesinger: put it back up. 20 do you have the surgical report, as well? 21 technician: that is the -- 22 the court: excuse me, counsel. 23 mr. schlesinger: i need the full page. 24 yes? 25 the court: ready to proceed? 1 mr. schlesinger: yes, i am, please the 2 court. 3 the court: go ahead. 4 mr. boyce: just for the record, there is 5 no claim that smoking caused -- 6 mr. schlesinger: excuse me. it is a 7 speaking objection. 8 the court: hold on. 9 mr. boyce: there is no claim that smoking 10 caused bone disease in this case. 11 mr. schlesinger: excuse me, judge. 12 the court: thank you. 13 counsel, we went sidebar. the objection 14 was made; i overruled the objection. we are 15 moving on, all right? 16 thank you. 17 mr. schlesinger: i need the operative 18 report, please, with the language from the 19 operative report. 20 may i proceed? 21 the court: yes, sir. 22 mr. schlesinger: i'm sorry, guys. 23 rebuttal is tough because, on the fly, 24 i'm trying to catch all these points. 25 but i'm trying to show you this: he went 1 in for the hip, he had hip osteonecrosis, he 2 was found to have aseptic necrosis of the left 3 hip because the patient had a long-term history 4 of steroid use for bronchitis and emphysema. 5 at his operative note, it said that his 6 hip -- and you will see it in the record -- total 7 osteonecrotic collapse of the hip at surgery. 8 and then there is another record in here where 9 it uses the term "osteoporosis." 10 that is the next slide. put up the next 11 slide. if you can find the operative note, 12 you will put it up, okay? 13 osteoporosis. now, do you remember i 14 spoke to dr. civantos about the side effects of 15 osteoporosis? we talked about the side effects 16 of osteoporosis. 17 i'll get there. 18 and he explained, among other things -- 19 and we have records on this -- part of this 20 man's weight gain was from his steroid use, 21 long-term steroid use, to try to help him 22 breathe better. 23 and there are records in there -- i may 24 not be able to put my hands on them -- where 25 the poor fellow is complaining about his 1 difficulty gaining -- losing weight, because 2 he is been on steroids, and they are adjusting 3 steroids. and abnormal body fat deposition was 4 one of dr. civantos' opinion. 5 i said: what else does it do? 6 he said: it washes out your bones and 7 gives you osteoporosis. this man had 8 osteoporosis, with a resultant osteonecrotic 9 collapse of his hip, and surgery, secondary to 10 steroids for emphysema and copd. 11 and, by the way -- 12 can i have the elmo? 13 in evidence, page 4 -- 14 and i said that smoking hurts every 15 single part of the body. 16 let us get the whole head in there. 17 that is fine. that is good enough. 18 you see one of the things that -- the 19 health consequences causally linked to smoking 20 and exposure to secondhand smoke: hip 21 fractures. 22 mr. woods: objection. 23 mr. schlesinger: when a man smokes -- 24 the court: the objection's noted. it is 25 overruled. 1 mr. boyce: same objection. 2 mr. schlesinger: when a man smokes for 3 55 years, up to three packs of cigarettes a 4 day, he is not doing it for the advertising and 5 marketing terms of "enjoyment" and "pleasure" 6 and "satisfaction," okay? 7 he is doing it because, as claude teague 8 said, nicotine is the sine qua non of smoking. 9 the sine qua non. that is latin. it means, 10 without which, there is nothing. that is what 11 smoking is. 12 there is no acknowledgment here. call it 13 what you want, addiction, make up any term you 14 want -- 15 mr. woods: objection. 16 mr. boyce: objection, your honor. 17 mr. schlesinger: -- this is not -- 18 the court: excuse me. this is argument, 19 counsel. overruled. 20 mr. schlesinger: so, you want to talk 21 about personal responsibility? let us talk 22 about personal responsibility. let us focus on 23 that. because corporations are treated as 24 persons under the rights of the law of this 25 case and, therefore, they also have the 1 responsibilities of persons. 2 and i said, if you want to be a person, 3 act like a person. behave with decency towards 4 your fellow man. and this -- this industry has 5 not, and they continue to not do so. 6 and what you should do is, you should 7 protect children. you should not mislead them 8 or prey on them. children should be protected, 9 right? we should help people. we should not 10 hinder attempts to quit. 11 zyban was a new drug that was not around 12 that long. by the time he got to it, it helped 13 him quit. but, also, he had to learn that 14 his -- his disease process of copd had 15 progressed to the point where it was so bad 16 that he quit -- he finally quit using zyban 17 when the "s" hit the fan -- they love to say 18 that over and over about this guy, okay? -- but 19 you saw this man testify for hours. remember, 20 he was only questioned by his adversaries. 21 there was no question -- 22 mr. woods: objection. 23 the court: sustained. 24 mr. schlesinger: -- by his lawyers 25 there. the questioning was -- 1 the court: excuse me. 2 mr. woods: he had every opportunity -- 3 the court: counsel, i ruled, all right? 4 i do not want you to keep talking after i ruled. 5 mr. woods: sorry. 6 mr. schlesinger: the treaters in the 7 records that you saw are contemporaneous. 8 mr. moyer was questioned, as an elderly man, in 9 2012, 2011. his last deposition was a year 10 before he died. and he was reflecting back 11 into the '90s. 12 but those records in evidence were every 13 one of the treating doctors that we brought in 14 to tell you he had this disease process in his 15 lungs, in the class period, and he was addicted 16 to smoking, he was a heavily addicted smoker, 17 and that that smoking addiction was a direct 18 and continuous cause of his disease process, 19 all testified to you, unrebutted, as credible 20 experts who were just there taking care of him 21 at the time. so the -- 22 and you met the client. he seemed like 23 he was a straight shooter, if you watched him, 24 in the records; and, quite frankly, he did say 25 something that was facetious. i do not know why 1 they kept talking about it. he said, i was so 2 impressed by what the fellow had to say that i 3 finally quit 30 years later. so, the -- 4 the court: five minutes, counsel. 5 mr. schlesinger: in this book, on page 6 517, it says here: the cigarette industry has 7 been artfully maintaining that cigarette 8 advertising -- did i read this to you guys 9 yesterday? -- 10 the court: counsel -- 11 mr. schlesinger: -- that cigarette 12 advertising has nothing to do with total sales. 13 this is complete and utter nonsense. the 14 industry knows it is nonsense. i'm always 15 amused by the suggestion that advertising, a 16 function that has been shown to increase 17 consumption of virtually every other product, 18 somehow miraculously fails to work for tobacco 19 products. 20 mr. moyer continued to smoke the salems 21 after 1982, he testified, because he thought 22 they were safer. lights connoted safety. he 23 relied on that. his behavior and his actions 24 speak louder than anything else. just like he 25 smoked filters. 1 he fit their company marketing plan to a 2 tee. therefore, he relied, but he got sick. 3 if you think he should have tried harder, then 4 all you have to do is, on the comparative 5 negligence comparisons, give him a higher 6 percentage. 7 but all mr. hammer suggested was 8 five percent, because i think that, reasonably, 9 what they did, not just negligently, but 10 intentionally, through conspiracy and fraud and 11 intentional concealment and selling a 12 dangerously defective product, more dangerous 13 than it needs to be, is at least 20 times worse 14 than what they did. 15 he was an innocent. if his human 16 weaknesses were such that, try as he might -- 17 and he did try -- try as he might, he was 18 unable to quit until he came down with a 19 devastating disease, then you take that into 20 consideration and you give him the percentages 21 of fault you feel are attributable to him. 22 but i would say that you could equally 23 argue that what they did was a hundred times 24 worse, because they did it on purpose and they 25 did it for money. 1 if you want to talk about personal 2 responsibility, what about the personal 3 responsibility of all of these executives and 4 all of these scientists and all of these men, 5 who spent all of this time making all of this 6 money on the backs of addicted smokers, knowing 7 full well that what they were doing was going 8 to result in the death of millions of 9 americans? 10 how about the personal responsibility of 11 a corporation to make decisions to cure cancer, 12 not cause cancer? 13 and here's -- here's a shout out to 14 liggett, because liggett's role in the 15 conspiracy is a little bit less -- although, 16 they are an active part of the conspiracy -- 17 but despite the industry's arguments about -- 18 about smoking, there are times when cigarette 19 company executives, themselves, have 20 acknowledged that marketing reaches and 21 influences underage adolescents. 22 for example, in 1997, bennett lebow, ceo 23 of the holding company that owns liggett, 24 stated: liggett -- 25 ms. ruiz: objection, your honor. 1 mr. schlesinger: -- acknowledges the 2 tobacco industry markets to youth -- 3 the court: i'm sorry. excuse me. 4 ms. ruiz: objection. that is not in 5 evidence, your honor. 6 mr. schlesinger: this is in evidence. 7 the court: it is the surgeon general's 8 report? 9 ladies and gentlemen, you are to rely on 10 your own recollection of the evidence. 11 counsel's representing to me he is reading from 12 something in evidence. 13 mr. schlesinger: thank you, judge. 14 the court: the objection's noted. it is 15 overruled. 16 mr. schlesinger: page 518. for example, 17 1997, bennett lebow, ceo of the holding company 18 that owns liggett, stated: liggett 19 acknowledges that the tobacco industry markets 20 to youth, which means those under 18 years of 21 age, and not just those 18 to 24 years of age. 22 later that year, mr. bennett lebow 23 further testified that cigarette companies -- 24 all the cigarette companies -- targeted young 25 people to try to keep people smoking, keep 1 their business going. 2 so that is an admission that he finally 3 came out with, but it is true that that is an 4 important basis of their business, and it 5 always has been. the -- 6 you cannot deny in this courtroom that 7 this is an addictive drug, because the findings 8 say so, every -- every witness that testified 9 says so. 10 and if not mr. moyer, who? everybody 11 could try harder to quit under that scenario. 12 everybody could smoke more cigarettes. if they 13 smoked one pack a day, that is not enough, you 14 got to smoke two packs a day. if you smoke two 15 packs a day, it is not enough, you got to smoke 16 three packs a day. if you tried 30 patches, 17 that is not enough, you got to try 60 patches. 18 even if you think that some of that is 19 true and some of the human weaknesses of 20 mr. moyer apply, it is on the fault part of the 21 question. but in terms of, is he a class 22 member, engle has class members. 23 was he someone whose dependence on 24 smoking was a cause, a part of the drive that 25 led him to consume a million cigarettes into 1 his lungs and get sick? you bet he was a class 2 member. 3 does he bear some responsibility? yes. 4 but we think the evidence is it was far less 5 than what they bear. i think if -- 6 you saw our client, mr. moyer, up there. 7 i thought he was a straight shooter. you can 8 make your own decisions. 9 mr. woods: objection. 10 the court: thank you. 11 mr. schlesinger: i take that back. 12 the court: counsel -- 13 mr. schlesinger: you can make your -- 14 the court: you need to start wrapping 15 up, counsel. 16 mr. schlesinger: okay. and, then, in 17 19 -- 18 one of the documents by lorillard, that 19 they did not read, that is in evidence, talks 20 about: by taking advantage of these 21 opportunities, we can forcefully refute 22 reader's digest criticism related to smoking. 23 there was a handful of smoking articles 24 in reader's digest, but lorillard was out there 25 trying to knock them down, just like they 1 knocked down the surgeon general. 2 there is also a document in evidence that 3 says: we now possess a knowledge of effects of 4 nicotine far more extensive than exists in the 5 public -- in the public literature. they 6 had -- 7 in 1990, there is a school letter to 8 fifth-grade students, from rjr to the school 9 children of willow ridge school, in evidence: 10 despite all the recent research going on, the 11 simple and unfortunate fact is scientists do 12 not know the cause or causes of the chronic 13 diseases sought to be reported and associated 14 with smoking. 15 if everybody was supposed to know, why 16 did not the tobacco companies know? 17 and what a difference the world -- it 18 would have made if they had been morally honest 19 with their customers and done what they knew 20 they needed to do. and that was do something 21 about this deadly, cancer-causing product. 22 the surgeon general, 2010, says -- 23 mr. boyce: objection, your honor. 24 the court: excuse me. what is the 25 objection, counsel? 1 mr. boyce: the objection is, your honor, 2 quoting from the surgeon general's report. 3 none of this stuff has been talked about with 4 the jury, with a witness. there is no context 5 for it. 6 the court: thank you. it is in evidence, 7 counsel. your objection's noted. it is 8 overruled. 9 mr. schlesinger, i do remind you, you 10 need to wrap it up. 11 mr. schlesinger: all right. the preface 12 to the surgeon general '10: the way tobacco is 13 grown, mixed and processed today has made 14 cigarettes more addictive than ever before. 15 here, page 355. i knew i would find it, 16 on the -- on the heart disease: beyond its 17 status as an -- 18 page 355, surgeon general '10, the blue 19 book: beyond its status as an independent risk 20 factor, smoking appears to have a 21 multiplicative interaction with the other major 22 risk factors for coronary heart disease, high 23 serum levels of lipids, untreated hypertension, 24 and diabetes mellitus. 25 and then, also, in surgeon general 1 2012 -- 2 and i embrace it. they wanted to quote 3 from surgeon general -- 4 mr. boyce: your honor -- 5 mr. schlesinger: -- 2012. please review 6 it. 7 mr. boyce: -- can we go sidebar for one 8 quick second? 9 the court: sure, counsel. 10 mr. schlesinger: thanks, judge. 11 (the following discussion was held at 12 sidebar:) 13 mr. schlesinger: sorry, judge. 14 the court: the problem is -- 15 mr. woods: by my count, his time expired 16 a minute ago. we all worked very hard to get 17 in under two-and-a-half hours. 18 your honor told him five minutes ago -- 19 you told him to wrap up. he then read two more 20 exhibits, another quote from the surgeon 21 general, and he just keeps going. he is out of 22 time. 23 the last thing he should get to say to 24 this jury is "thank you," or give five more 25 minutes to each defendant. but we worked 1 really hard last night to get in under 2 two-and-a-half hours. he is out of time now. 3 it ought to be over. 4 the court: counsel, i guess part of the 5 thing is, i have a running clock here, and i 6 know mr. schlesinger's asked for something 7 different than that, but we have had at least 8 three sidebars here during his rebuttal 9 argument. that takes time from what is going 10 on. i have told him, i want you to wrap it up. 11 mr. schlesinger: okay. 12 (sidebar concluded.) 13 mr. schlesinger: again, this will be in 14 the -- 15 the court: hold on, hold on. 16 mr. schlesinger: yep. 17 the court: madame, you all set? 18 court reporter: yes, sir. 19 mr. schlesinger: time limit to a lawyer 20 talking is agony, but i have to wrap up. 21 there is a few things -- 22 again, you will see them in the record. i 23 was reading to you that -- 24 i read to you about the heart as a 25 multiplicative risk factor. in terms of 1 addiction causing disease, i pointed out a 2 bunch of stuff from surgeon general '10. 3 surgeon general '12, the red book, on 4 kids: one of the most significant health 5 effects is addiction to nicotine that keeps 6 young people smoking longer, causing increased 7 physical damage. 8 that is right in the preface, the 9 introductory pages of that book. 10 and on page 871 of the surgeon general 11 2014, it says: the cigarette is also a 12 defective product, meaning, not just dangerous, 13 but unreasonably dangerous, killing half of its 14 long-term users, and addictive by design. 15 and the fda, as dr. proctor has 16 testified, has not been able to put through any 17 regulation. and if you look at the -- 18 mr. boyce: objection. 19 mr. woods: objection. 20 mr. boyce: objection, your honor. 21 the court: excuse me. sustained. 22 counsel, you need to wrap it up, all 23 right? 24 that does not mean going on to new topics, 25 all right? 1 mr. schlesinger: all right. let me just 2 see if i've got one more here, judge, and i'll 3 call it a day. 4 there is only one thing i want to read. 5 it will take me less than a minute. 6 george orwell wrote a book called "1984." 7 and in that -- 8 one of his quotes in that book -- 9 mr. boyce: your honor -- 10 the court: overruled. 11 mr. schlesinger: thank you. in that -- 12 in that book, he had a quote that, you 13 know, was a post-apocalyptic quote, and it 14 talked about ignorance is strength. 15 there is another counter quote by a famous 16 person i do not remember now: knowledge is 17 power. 18 and george orwell said this: in -- 19 and it was played by richard hurt and -- 20 no. richard burton and john hurt. 21 and richard burton was leaning over john 22 hurt, and whispering in his ear before they 23 were going to torture john hurt, and he said: 24 you must stop imagining that posterity will 25 vindicate you, winston. posterity will never 1 hear of you. you will be lifted clean out from 2 the stream of history. we shall turn you into 3 a gas and pour you into the stratosphere. 4 nothing will remain of you. not a name in a 5 register, not a memory in a living brain. you 6 will have been annihilated in the past, as well 7 as in the future. you will never have existed. 8 by your verdict, you can see to it that 9 when mr. moyer, in his death, has -- 10 mr. woods: objection. 11 mr. schlesinger: -- risen up against the 12 tobacco company -- 13 the court: overruled. 14 mr. schlesinger: -- you can see to it 15 that he will not be forgotten and he will not 16 be absent as a name in a register. 17 you will be able to register he was one of 18 millions. and like so many millions of others, 19 you can consider harm to others in 20 determining -- 21 mr. boyce: objection. 22 mr. schlesinger: -- the reprehensibility 23 of the conduct -- 24 it is in the instruction. [#deleted objection dialogue#] 18 mr. schlesinger: i want to say that i 19 will not presume to tell you what you must do, 20 nor what i believe you absolutely will do. 21 i will tell you what i have told many 22 juries that i've had an opportunity to speak 23 to: i wish you great luck at arriving at a 24 just result in this case, and i hope to get to 25 be able to talk to you again. thank you.
