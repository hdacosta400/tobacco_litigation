19 mr. geraghty: may it please the court. 20 good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 21 you know my name is bill geraghty. on behalf of 22 myself, my partner, frank cruz-alvarez, and philip morris, i'm 23 going to start by thanking you for your jury service. 24 our legal system depends on good people like you who 25 are willing to give up their time to help us decide a civil 1 lawsuit like this. i know that you have all paid very close 2 attention to the evidence, and everyone involved in the case 3 really appreciates your time and effort. so let me start 4 simply by just saying thank you very much for your service in 5 this case. 6 we are getting close to the end of the case, which 7 i'm sure is music to all of your ears, and it is almost time 8 for you to retire to the jury room and deliberate. 9 judge ungaro will give you a set of legal 10 instructions and a verdict form, and then you are going to be 11 asked to decide the issues in this case. but before you head 12 off to deliberate, i'd like to take this opportunity to 13 summarize the evidence that we have seen and heard during the 14 course of the trial. 15 now, remember during my opening statement i told you 16 that the plaintiff would spend a good amount of time talking 17 about statements or representations made by philip morris, 18 lorillard and other tobacco companies, many of which were made 19 more than 30, 40 or 50 years ago, and i told you, ladies and 20 gentlemen, i would not try to defend those statements. philip 21 morris and lorillard made statements and had ideas that today 22 neither you nor i would say or think. but i also told you 23 that if that was what this case was really about, we all would 24 have gone home two weeks ago. 25 but we did not, and that is because this case is not 1 about all cigarette smokers. it is not about the general 2 public. it is about one former smoker, fred jacobson, and it 3 is only about him. 4 and now, ladies and gentlemen, after having heard all 5 of the evidence, you know that fred jacobson was not paying 6 attention to anything that philip morris or lorillard was 7 saying. 8 judge ungaro is going to instruct you that the 9 plaintiff bears the burden of proof in this case to prove to 10 you that a cigarette company's statement made by a cigarette 11 company, or something that they failed to say, had a direct 12 connection and a substantial impact on fred jacobson's 13 decisions about cigarette smoking; and there was simply no 14 evidence to support that in this case. 15 just as i told you in my opening statement, you heard 16 from mr. jacobson's family and friends that he was strong, 17 intelligent and well informed. that is what they told you. 18 from an early age, mr. jacobson was well aware that cigarette 19 smoking came with significant health risks, and despite those 20 risks, he chose to smoke for many years. 21 he was not waiting for philip morris or lorillard to 22 tell him, you know what, smoking is dangerous, you need to 23 quit. he heard from his family, his friends and from his 24 doctors that cigarette smoking was bad for his health and that 25 he should quit. 1 but fred jacobson for many years enjoyed smoking and 2 was not interested in quitting. but the key point here, 3 ladies and gentlemen, is that was fred jacobson's decision and 4 his decision alone. 5 now, let me say something about the findings you have 6 heard from this class action, and there is no debate about 7 this. those findings do not tell you how to answer any of the 8 questions on the verdict form, and that is because by your 9 verdict you will decide, ladies and gentlemen, you get to 10 decide, whether those findings have any meaning in the context 11 of fred jacobson's life and the decisions that he made. 12 after all, this case is about fred and ronnie 13 jacobson. mrs. jacobson is the one who filed this lawsuit and 14 she is the one asking you to award her millions of dollars for 15 her husband's decision to smoke cigarettes. and you are the 16 only jury, ladies and gentlemen, that has heard fred 17 jacobson's story. 18 now, i started my opening statement two weeks ago 19 with a list of issues that were not in dispute in this case. 20 we can add one more item to the list. everyone in this 21 courtroom feels sympathy for mrs. jacobson for the loss of her 22 husband. we are all human. it is only natural to feel 23 sympathy for someone who has lost a loved one. 24 but as judge ungaro instructed you at the beginning 25 of the case, and she is going to remind you one more time, you 1 have to set those natural feelings of sympathy aside and 2 decide this case based only on the evidence you heard from 3 that witness stand during the course of the trial and from the 4 legal instructions that you are about to get from the judge. 5 and knowing how hard and diligent you have worked so far in the 6 trial, we all have no doubt that you are going to be able to do 7 that. 8 now, before we get into the evidence, i want to 9 remind you what we discussed about the sources of evidence 10 that you heard during the course of this trial, and i asked 11 you to pay close attention to that first source of evidence. 12 the medical records that were written by the doctors 13 who treated fred jacobson and the patient questionnaires and 14 insurance forms that mr. jacobson himself filled out, you now 15 know why that evidence is so important, because it is the only 16 evidence we have today in this case that comes directly from 17 fred jacobson himself. and this evidence was created many 18 years before anyone was thinking about filing a lawsuit, 19 before anyone had a financial interest in remembering things 20 in a way that was favorable to their case. 21 now, judge ungaro is going to tell you, you can 22 choose to believe or disbelieve any witness you hear, and 23 she is going to tell you to think about a series of questions 24 to help you decide that. and i put some of these questions on 25 this board. this is what judge ungaro is going to tell you to 1 ask yourself as you listen to the evidence. 2 did the witness impress you as one who was telling 3 the truth? did the witness have any particular reason not to 4 tell the truth? did the witness have a personal interest in 5 the outcome of the case? did the witness seem to have a good 6 memory? and finally, did the witness' testimony differ from 7 other testimony or evidence you heard during the course of the 8 trial? 9 and as you saw throughout this trial, much of what 10 you heard from ronnie jacobson about her husband and his 11 cigarette smoking was contradicted by what fred jacobson told 12 his own doctors, by what he wrote down in his own records, and 13 by what his friends and family members told you about 14 mr. jacobson. 15 and mrs. jacobson's testimony was contradicted on 16 important points in this case: for example, whether he read 17 the warnings and knew that cigarette smoking was dangerous 18 many, many years ago; whether he quit smoking several times 19 for more than a year or two; and whether he was ever, ever 20 diagnosed by any of his doctors with copd. 21 just as i told you she would, mrs. jacobson confessed 22 to you that today there are many things she cannot remember 23 because it has been so long ago, more than 20, 25, and in some 24 instances more than 30 years ago. 25 and so, as you think about the evidence you heard, 1 please consider that judge ungaro will instruct you that you 2 get to decide whether you find each witness to be believable 3 or whether you think some of the things the witness said were 4 influenced by an interest they have in the outcome of the 5 case. the judge will instruct you that you can accept or 6 reject any testimony you have heard during this trial, in whole 7 or in part. that is your job, ladies and gentlemen, and your 8 job alone. 9 now, you will remember that at the beginning of the 10 case i told you it was about two words: "control" and 11 "responsibility," "control" and "responsibility." and we are 12 going to walk through all of the evidence you have heard during 13 the course of this trial. and just as i did in my opening, i 14 want you to consider a series of questions as we talk about 15 the evidence. 16 who was in control of fred jacobson's lifestyle 17 choices, including his choice to smoke cigarettes? who was in 18 control of his efforts to quit smoking? who controlled fred 19 jacobson's motivation to quit? was fred jacobson addicted, 20 and if so, was he someone whose addiction was so strong, so 21 substantial, that it overpowered his ability to quit? and 22 finally, did fred jacobson rely on anything, anything that 23 philip morris or lorillard said or failed to say about the 24 health risks of smoking? 25 now, we have heard a lot of testimony about the 1 lifestyle choices that fred jacobson made. he made those 2 choices, no one else. fred jacobson was strong and 3 independent. he lived his life the way he wanted, and that 4 included smoking cigarettes. 5 you now know that fred jacobson enjoyed smoking 6 cigarettes and you know now that his wife, ronnie jacobson, 7 also enjoyed smoking cigarettes. smoking was simply something 8 that fred and ronnie jacobson wanted to do, and for many years 9 it was not something that mr. jacobson wanted to give up. 10 like many people, fred jacobson knew that smoking was 11 dangerous. yet, as you heard, his attitude with family and 12 friends was: mind your own business. let me live my life the 13 way i want to live it. and he had every right to do so. 14 we all have the right to make decisions for 15 ourselves, even decisions that today, with the benefit of 16 hindsight, we might say were not in his best interests. we 17 believe in the freedom to make choices. that is a fundamental 18 principle upon which our country was founded. but with that 19 right, ladies and gentlemen, comes the obligation to accept 20 personal responsibility for the consequences of those choices. 21 now, let me talk to you very briefly about the burden 22 of proof. you have seen documents. you have seen medical 23 records. you have heard several days' worth of testimony. 24 the plaintiff bears the burden to prove each of her 25 claims in this case by what is called a preponderance of the 1 evidence. that is what the judge is going to tell you. so, 2 what does that mean? 3 that means to tip the scales in her favor, the 4 plaintiff was required during this trial to produce more 5 evidence and more persuasive evidence than the mountain of 6 evidence that we have presented to you during the course of 7 this trial, the mountain of evidence that shows fred jacobson 8 was always in control; that fred jacobson did not have copd; 9 that he was not hopelessly addicted; and that his claimed 10 addiction was not the legal cause of copd. and we are going to 11 walk through all the evidence you have heard during the course 12 of this trial, and i'm going to show you, ladies and 13 gentlemen, that the plaintiff has failed to carry her burden 14 of proof. 15 now, during my opening statement i showed you a 16 timeline, and we used that timeline to walk through all of the 17 significant events in fred jacobson's life, and i'm going to 18 show you that timeline again, and i'll show you that 19 everything we told you about fred jacobson we proved it during 20 the course of this trial. 21 but before we do that, i want to remind you of one 22 last thing. i told you during my opening statement that there 23 were four key points, four key points, about the evidence you 24 would hear that summarized all of the evidence you would hear 25 about fred jacobson, and i told you that those four key points 1 were all that you needed to know to decide the issues in this 2 case. and i've now put on the board. you heard about all 3 this during the course of the trial. 4 number 1: fred jacobson knew that smoking was 5 dangerous and potentially addictive for many years before he 6 developed lung cancer. 7 number 2: fred jacobson enjoyed smoking cigarettes 8 and he did not want people pestering him to quit doing 9 something that he enjoyed. 10 number 3: when he was motivated to quit, 11 mr. jacobson quit smoking several times for more than a year, 12 and he finally quit for good in december of 1996, before he 13 was diagnosed with lung cancer. 14 and finally, ladies and gentlemen: mr. jacobson did 15 not have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or copd, and 16 he certainly did not have it before november 21, 1996. 17 now, let me show you the timeline one more time. 18 this is the very same timeline out of the same series of four 19 boards that i showed you during my opening statement, and you 20 heard about all of this during the course of the trial. 21 you know, ladies and gentlemen, fred jacobson was 22 born on may 6, 1943, in queens, new york. his father, william 23 jacobson, was a dentist. his mother, dorothy jacobson, was a 24 homemaker. he had an old sister, lois jacobson. she was born 25 four years before him. you know that fred jacobson was raised 1 by loving parents who placed a premium on educating their 2 children. 3 we move into the early 1950s. you heard he was 4 diagnosed with asthma. his sister told you, his sister told 5 you, that he was allergic to many things and many things 6 caused him to have asthmatic reactions. 7 you have also now seen the medical records and you have 8 heard the testimony of dr. feinberg and dr. frazier, fred 9 jacobson continued to have bouts of intermittent asthma as an 10 adult. 11 now, let us drop from this point below the gray bar. 12 and remember, mr. kaiser said it again today. he said to you 13 that philip morris and lorillard somehow hid the fact that 14 cigarette smoking was dangerous and addictive for more than 50 15 years and that the american public did not know that cigarette 16 smoking was dangerous or addictive. and he brought you 17 dr. proctor. but after hearing dr. proctor and all the other 18 witnesses testify, you know that is simply not the case. 19 you heard that as far back as the mid to late 1800s, 20 before philip morris even existed as a company, people in this 21 country were smoking what is called roll-your-own or hand- 22 rolled cigarettes. dr. proctor told you those cigarettes were 23 inhalable and they were just as addictive and dangerous as 24 manufactured cigarettes. 25 i heard mr. kaiser refer to flue-curing. remember 1 what dr. proctor told you. he told you long before flue-cured 2 tobacco was being used, people smoked turkish tobacco, 3 cigarettes made of turkish tobacco. they were inhalable as 4 far back as the 1850s. 5 he told you in other countries, cuba and in other 6 countries in south america, they smoked cigarettes made out of 7 something called black tobacco. those cigarettes also are 8 inhalable and cause the same lung cancer and diseases that 9 flue-cured tobacco causes. that is what you heard from their 10 expert, dr. proctor. 11 what else did dr. proctor tell you? dr. proctor told 12 you before fred jacobson was even born, people in this country 13 referred to cigarettes as coffin nails, meaning every 14 cigarette you smoke is another nail in your coffin. he said 15 they referred to cigarettes as cancer sticks. they referred 16 to cigarette smokers as nicotine fiends. these were terms 17 that were introduced more than a hundred years ago, long 18 before fred jacobson was ever born. you heard that fred 19 jacobson's family and friends heard cigarettes referred to as 20 coffin nails and cancer sticks by at least the early 1950s. 21 you also saw that popular magazines, like reader's 22 digest, published articles in the 1930s and 1940s that talked 23 about the health risks of smoking and the addictive nature of 24 smoking. this was not hidden. this was not some secret. 25 dr. proctor told you that reader's digest was the most popular 1 magazine in this country in the '30, '40s and 1950s. 2 he told you that as we moved into the early 1950s, 3 some of the early scientific research is being conducted that 4 specifically links cigarette smoking with what? lung cancer, 5 lung cancer. this was front page news on newspapers and 6 magazines throughout the country. so widely covered was this 7 information that dr. proctor told you, by 1954, when fred 8 jacobson was 10 or 11 years old, ninety percent of the people in 9 this country had heard that cigarette smoking was a cause of 10 lung cancer, ninety percent. 11 now, let us go back up above the gray bar. you heard 12 in this period of time, in the mid 1950s, fred jacobson's 13 mother, his father and his older sister, lois, all smoked 14 cigarettes. you heard that many of his friends were 15 experimenting with cigarettes. so it is no surprise, ladies 16 and gentlemen, that fred jacobson himself later becomes a 17 cigarette smoker. 18 dr. proctor told you, dr. proctor told you that many 19 people begin to smoke, they are more likely to smoke, if their 20 friends and family also smoke cigarettes. 21 so we move into the mid to late 1950s, and about 22 1957, you heard from his friend, alan weidberg, fred jacobson 23 tries cigarettes for the first time. 24 what else did mr. weidberg tell you? he told you 25 that many of their friends were experimenting with cigarettes. 1 he also told you, you know what, we knew, we knew we should 2 not be smoking. our parents told us we should not be smoking, 3 but we smoked anyway. that is what you heard from alan 4 weidberg. 5 now, about two years later, you heard that fred 6 jacobson attends a private high school in manhattan called 7 roads prep. he begins to read the new york times newspaper to 8 and from school on the subway every single day. you heard 9 from his wife that he was a voracious reader and he reads the 10 newspaper every single day for the rest of his life. 11 he graduates high school in about 1961, and a year 12 later, in 1962, he tries to enlist in the army and he is 13 rejected by the military because of his asthma. and how do we 14 know that, ladies and gentlemen? we do know that. we know 15 that because that is exactly what fred jacobson wrote in the 16 life insurance application he filled out years later in 1991. 17 that is how we know that. 18 he starts working on wall street for a couple of 19 years, and then in about 1964 or 1965 he is hired as a salesman 20 for a company called superior linen company. you heard that 21 he rose through the ranks of that company very, very quickly 22 and he ultimately becomes a senior executive. 23 now, that brings us to 1964, and let us drop below the 24 gray bar here, and we are in january of 1964. you heard that 25 in january of 1964, the surgeon general of the united states 1 issues a landmark report on smoking and health. that report 2 concludes cigarette smoking causes lung cancer and chronic 3 bronchitis. and you now know chronic bronchitis is a type of 4 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 5 now, dr. proctor told you that this report was front 6 page news on newspapers across the country, including new york 7 where fred jacobson was living. this is the front page of the 8 new york times on january 12, 1964, the day after the surgeon 9 general's report is released. here's what it says: 10 "cigarettes peril health. u.s. report concludes remedial 11 action urged." this is what is being said in newspapers 12 across this country nearly 50 years ago in 1964. 13 you also heard that this report was the lead news 14 story on every television station: abc, nbc, and cbs. we 15 showed you the special broadcast from cbs and the coverage by 16 harry reasoner. 17 mr. jacobson was 20 years old when this report was 18 released. his friend, alan weidberg, his good childhood 19 friend, told you it was scary when this report was released. 20 he told you that within his circle of friends, which included 21 fred jacobson, they all knew that cigarette smoking caused 22 lung cancer. that is in 1964. 23 so, let us move forward. that brings us to 1966, two 24 years later. we are still below the gray bar here. in 1966, 25 congress passes a law which requires a warning label to appear 1 on every pack of cigarettes. that warning reads: "caution: 2 cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health." this 3 warning label appears on all cigarette packs when fred 4 jacobson is 22 years old. and from this point forward, every 5 pack of cigarettes he buys carries a government mandated 6 warning that tells him cigarette smoking is hazardous to his 7 health. 8 now, you heard mr. kaiser talk about an ftc report. 9 well, ladies and gentlemen, what did fred jacobson's family 10 and friends tell you about the impact that this warning label 11 had? alan weidberg told you, when he saw this, it caused him 12 to take notice and to think twice, think twice about the 13 possibility that if he smoked he could get sick from cigarette 14 smoking. 15 you heard from his good friend, dr. michael weiner. 16 he told you he quit around the same period of time, 1965, 17 1966, because of all of the information that was out there 18 about cigarette smoking and disease. 19 and finally, what did ronnie jacobson herself tell 20 you? she recalled this warning and in her deposition she 21 remembered the language of this warning nearly word for word 22 almost 50 years later. that is what the people who knew fred 23 jacobson told you about that warning. 24 now, let us go above the gray bar here. that same 25 year, in 1966, you heard that fred jacobson meets his first 1 wife, bonnie shulman. they got married a year later, in 2 1967. two years later, in about 1969 or 1970, they move to 3 miami. fred jacobson is transferred to miami by his company, 4 superior linen, because they want him to help expand their 5 sales throughout the state of florida. 6 now, let us move from here to below the gray bar. in 7 1970, congress changes the warning label on cigarettes. it 8 now says: "warning: the surgeon general has determined that 9 cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health." that is the 10 warning as of 1970. 11 one year later, in 1971, all cigarette advertisements 12 are taken off of television and radio, as of 1971. 13 one year later, in 1972, every ad in the newspaper or 14 magazine or billboard is required to carry this surgeon 15 general's warning. that is the information that was out there, 16 ladies and gentlemen. 17 the plaintiff would have you believe that these 18 warnings and health messages were being drowned out by 19 statements made by cigarette companies. but the evidence 20 you have heard has demonstrated just the opposite. 21 remember what dr. proctor told you, dr. proctor, the 22 plaintiff's historian. there we go. i put it on the screen 23 in front of you. 24 we asked dr. proctor all about this. he told you 25 that as of 1970, 13 million americans had quit smoking, in the 1 four-year period from the time this warning went on until 2 1970. he told you that between 1964 and 1979, from the first 3 surgeon general's report, 30 million americans quit smoking. 4 that is two million people every single year. 5 he told you that as of today, fifty-five to 6 sixty million americans have quit smoking. he said the 7 surgeon general called this a revolutionary change in health 8 behavior. 9 the people who quit smoking heard the same 10 information as fred jacobson. it may have taken many of them 11 more than one try to quit. but many make the choice to quit 12 and they quit for good, but not fred jacobson. fred jacobson 13 enjoys smoking and at this point in time he is not interested 14 in quitting. 15 now, shortly after moving to miami in 1970, you heard 16 his daughter, jennifer dill, is born in 1970. two years 17 later, his son, jeffrey jacobson, is born in 1972. 18 you heard that the jacobsons live in kendall lakes. 19 they are part of the social group that includes lots of other 20 young and educated professionals, including doctors. 21 one of their good friends and neighbors is a doctor 22 by the name of dr. michael weiner. we read his deposition to 23 you. he told you that he told fred jacobson, when they met in 24 the early 1970s, that cigarette smoking is dangerous and you 25 need to quit. that is what he told fred jacobson. 1 did fred jacobson respond by saying, you know what, 2 i'm not convinced; i do not think so; i do not believe that 3 cigarette smoking causes lung cancer? of course he did not. 4 dr. weiner told you that based on what mr. jacobson told him, 5 it was clear fred jacobson knew all of this long before they 6 had those conversations, long before they had had those 7 conversations. 8 what did you hear from fred jacobson's children 9 themselves? they told you that they were both well aware that 10 cigarette smoking was bad for their health at a very young 11 age. they begin to urge their father to quit smoking in the 12 mid to late 1970s because that is what they are being taught in 13 school. 14 you heard that jennifer and jeff bought their father 15 a sign at a school bake sale. that sign said: "thank you for 16 not smoking." "thank you for not smoking." 17 and you will recall jennifer jacobson's testimony about 18 this. this is what was played to you. jennifer jacobson was 19 asked the following questions, ladies and gentlemen: 20 what is the youngest age at which that was something 21 that you knew, "that" meaning that cigarette smoking is bad 22 for your health? 23 her answer was: maybe 8 or 9 years old. 24 the next question is: when you bought that thank you 25 for not smoking sign for your father, at that point in time 1 did you already know that cigarettes could be bad for you and 2 could kill you? 3 her answer: i believe so. i believe so. 4 so she is eight or nine years old. 5 you heard jennifer dill testify that her teacher in 6 school showed her a pair of pink healthy lungs of a nonsmoker 7 and the brown and diseased lungs of a longtime heavy cigarette 8 smoker. jennifer dill said that was a very vivid 9 demonstration of the health risks of smoking. that is what she 10 told you. 11 you heard that she draws her father a birthday card. 12 she draws a brown heart on the birthday card and she tells her 13 father, please stop smoking, daddy. i want you to be 14 healthy. that is what his daughter tells him in the late 15 1970s. 16 you have heard from dr. proctor that it was part of the 17 curriculum of the school system, the public school system here 18 in miami-dade county, that children, elementary school 19 children, were taught the health risks of smoking. and 20 jeffrey and jennifer jacobson dill all confirm that to you. 21 they confirm that to you. 22 in fact, you know that mrs. jacobson, ronnie jacobson 23 herself, was an elementary school teacher right here during 24 the same period of time in the 1970s in miami-dade county. 25 now, let us move forward to the early 1980s. you 1 heard that in 1982, fred jacobson's first wife, bonnie 2 jacobson, is diagnosed with leukemia. she is treated for about 3 a two-year period, but unfortunately she passes away in 4 november of 1983. she is treated by a doctor named alan 5 feinberg. that is the same doctor who ultimately treats fred 6 jacobson when he is diagnosed with lung cancer many years 7 later. while he is treating bonnie jacobson for leukemia, he 8 tells fred jacobson cigarette smoking is bad for your health; 9 you need to quit. 10 and you know what? fred jacobson does quite smoking 11 at this point in time. he quits for approximately one year. 12 and how do we know that? we know that because that is what 13 fred jacobson tells his own doctor. 14 you have seen the record before. let me show it to you 15 again. this is a june 30, 1988, medical record written by 16 dr. morton korn. dr. korn was fred jacobson's primary care 17 physician. you will remember mrs. jacobson told you he was my 18 doctor first and i recommended that fred jacobson go to see 19 him. 20 well, he has an appointment in 1988. the first time 21 he sees dr. korn, dr. korn asks him if he smokes cigarettes, 22 and here is what fred jacobson tells dr. korn. unfortunately, 23 he smokes cigarettes. he had stopped for one year when his 24 first wife died and then unfortunately he went back to it. 25 that is what dr. korn wrote that is what fred jacobson told 1 him. so in 1988, fred jacobson tells his doctor that he quit 2 for about a year in 1982 or 1983, when his wife was diagnosed 3 with leukemia and passed away. 4 now, i heard mr. kaiser say this. mrs. jacobson and 5 her lawyers want to suggest to you that somehow this record is 6 not accurate. but mrs. jacobson herself told you she knows 7 nothing about her husband's cigarette smoking before they met 8 in 1984. she also told you it is difficult for her to 9 remember these things because it is almost 30 years ago. 10 you now know, after listening to all the evidence in 11 this case, that what fred jacobson told his doctor in 1988 is 12 far more reliable than mrs. jacobson's memory of what occurred 13 30 years ago. you know that, ladies and gentlemen. 14 now, we know that at some point, about a year later, 15 fred jacobson decides to start smoking again. what do we know 16 specifically? we know that his first wife, bonnie shulman, 17 was a nonsmoker. less than two months after she passes away 18 in november 1983, fred jacobson meets the plaintiff. she was 19 known as ronnie jackowitz at that point. you heard they hit 20 it off immediately, they begin dating, and less than six 21 months later they are married. 22 ronnie jacobson herself told you i enjoyed smoking 23 cigarettes. she told you that during her testimony. and it 24 certainly makes sense that at least one of the reasons why 25 fred jacobson would decide to start smoking again is because 1 he is now dating a woman who enjoys smoking cigarettes just 2 like he does. 3 now, mrs. jacobson refused to admit to you when she 4 testified that her husband enjoyed smoking. but ladies and 5 gentlemen, judge ungaro is going to tell you, you get to use 6 your common sense. you can use your common sense. you heard 7 the testimony. you saw the pictures. there is no doubt that 8 fred jacobson and ronnie jacobson enjoyed smoking cigarettes. 9 they enjoyed smoking together. mrs. jacobson had to admit 10 that to you. 11 their own witness, dr. proctor, told you a person is 12 more likely to smoke and less likely to want to quit if their 13 spouse also smokes cigarettes. that is what their own doctor, 14 dr. proctor, told you. 15 now, let us move forward. we are in 1985 here. we are 16 below the gray bar. in 1985, congress changes the warning 17 label on cigarettes again. there is now a series of four 18 rotating warnings. one of those warnings says: "surgeon 19 general's warning: smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, 20 emphysema and may complicate pregnancy." that is in 1985. 21 let us move to the late 1980s. we know that in either 22 1989 or 1990, fred jacobson quits smoking for several years. 23 how do we know that? because that is what fred jacobson tells 24 us in a life insurance application that he fills out in may of 25 1991. 1 you have seen this life insurance application before. 2 it is in evidence. fred jacobson signs this. he signs the 3 document in may of 1991, jackson mutual life insurance 4 application. he is asked a very simple question: have you 5 smoked cigarettes in the past 12 months? he checks the box 6 that says no, i have not smoked cigarettes in the past 12 7 months. 8 there is another page of the application where he is 9 asked a very similar question too. again, this is signed by 10 fred jacobson. he is asked: has any person proposed for 11 insurance smoked cigarettes within the last 12 months? he 12 writes or he checks the box no, and then he tells the 13 insurance agent: quit several years ago. fred jacobson 14 indicates on this life insurance application that he quit 15 several years ago. 16 so, sometime in 1989 or 1990, mr. jacobson quits 17 smoking again for several years. but this is another record, 18 ladies and gentlemen, another record that mrs. jacobson and 19 her lawyers in this lawsuit want to tell you is just wrong, 20 just wrong. 21 she tells you she remembers this is wrong from the 22 late '80s, early '90s, when remember, she could not even 23 husband that her husband quit smoking for good in 1996 just a 24 few months ago in her deposition. 25 but think about what mrs. jacobson and her lawyers 1 are really saying when they tell you this record is wrong. 2 she is saying that she and her husband made a false statement 3 under penalty of perjury. to save what? a few hundred 4 dollars on a life insurance premium? that is what she is 5 saying at the same time that she and her lawyers are now 6 asking you to award her millions of dollars, millions of 7 dollars. 8 you heard that fred jacobson made a comfortable 9 living. they went out to dinner several times a week. they 10 went on many cruises. after everything you have heard about 11 fred jacobson during this trial, there is absolutely no reason 12 to believe that he would have put false information in this 13 application to save a few bucks. 14 the fact of the matter is, mrs. jacobson does not 15 remember when or for how long her husband quit smoking over 16 the years. take a look at the document. page through the 17 document. you will see the life insurance company has a doctor 18 perform a physical exam on fred jacobson. they take a blood 19 sample. they take a urine sample. 20 so, ladies and gentlemen, consider the source of the 21 evidence: an application that is filled out by fred jacobson 22 and signed under penalty of perjury by fred jacobson many 23 years before anyone was thinking about filing a lawsuit versus 24 the testimony of someone who has a financial interest in 25 remembering things that are helpful to her case and is asking 1 you to award her millions of dollars in damages in this case. 2 now, that brings to us 1996. and one of the 3 questions you are going to be asked to decide is whether or not 4 fred jacobson had copd on or before november 21, 1996. i'm 5 going to talk about that, but i'm going to talk about that 6 when we get to the question on the verdict form in just a 7 moment. 8 so that brings us to december 17, 1996. and on that 9 day, fred jacobson quits smoking for good. and again, we know 10 that because that is what fred jacobson said in his own health 11 insurance -- or, excuse me, patient health history 12 questionnaire. you have seen this document. i'm highlighting 13 the passage. we have highlighted -- this is filled out by fred 14 jacobson himself in his own handwriting. 15 under tobacco use he says he smoked one pack of 16 cigarettes a day for 35 years. and at the very bottom he 17 says: if you have stopped smoking, when? he says: december 18 17, 1996. 19 and mrs. jacobson, when this was presented to her, 20 said, yes, i agree, that is when he quit. that is when he 21 quit. mrs. jacobson acknowledged that her husband simply said 22 enough is enough and made the decision to quit. 23 and as you heard, when he quit smoking for good in 24 1996, he did it without any assistance whatsoever, with no 25 serious withdrawal, and apparently with little difficulty. it 1 was such not a big deal that mrs. jacobson did not even 2 remember that this is when he quit when she gave her 3 deposition just a few months ago. 4 now, that brings us to may of 1997. you heard that 5 while working in his backyard, fred jacobson has a sudden 6 onset of shortness of breath and cough. mrs. jacobson 7 testified this is the very first time, the very first time he 8 ever had any breathing difficulties that she is aware of. and 9 look at the date compared to this date. 10 he immediately goes to the doctor. they find that he 11 has a large tumor in his chest, and unfortunately, he is 12 diagnosed with lung cancer. 13 you heard that he does reasonably well for the next 14 three years, and despite aggressive treatment, there is 15 ultimately a recurrence of the cancer and he passes away in 16 february of 2001. 17 ladies and gentlemen, that is the story. that is the 18 entire story you have heard about fred jacobson during the 19 course of this trial. 20 now, what i would like to do with the time i have 21 remaining is walk you through the specific questions that 22 you are going to be asked to decide on the verdict form, and 23 let us start with the very first question, that question that 24 we have talked about several times. 25 question number 1 says -- can you all read that from 1 there or i do need to move it closer? i'm going to move it a 2 little bit closer. i saw somebody leaning in a little bit 3 over there. 4 the question is: did fredric jacobson have chronic 5 obstructive pulmonary disease, copd, and, if so, did his copd 6 first manifest itself on or before november 21, 1996? 7 and this word "manifest" simply means did it exist, 8 did it appear, did it occur -- 9 mr. finger: your honor, i'm objecting. that is not 10 the verdict form that this jury is getting. 11 the court: i cannot see it. so i do not know. 12 mr. finger: that is not the question. 13 the court: but we have made the verdict form available 14 to everyone. so the first question is: did fredric jacobson 15 have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and, if so, did 16 his copd first manifest itself on or before november 21, 1996? 17 mr. geraghty: that is exactly what i have. 18 the court: i just read from the verdict form. 19 mr. finger: all right. i have trouble seeing it 20 from a distance. i'm sorry. 21 the court: well -- 22 mr. geraghty: ladies and gentlemen, this is the 23 question you are going to be asked to decide on the verdict 24 form. you will see the verdict form. 25 now, i'm sure it must have seemed odd that in a case 1 in which it is undisputed that fred jacobson died of lung 2 cancer, that the parties spent so much time talking to you 3 about copd and emphysema. so let me see if i can explain that 4 to you. 5 the judge is going to tell you in her instructions 6 that the plaintiff wants to take advantage of certain 7 procedural benefits, benefits that enabled her to file this 8 lawsuit and benefits that relieve her of the obligation to 9 prove certain things that she would otherwise have to prove. 10 but she is only entitled to do that if she can prove that fred 11 jacobson had a qualifying disease, and that qualifying disease 12 is copd. so, mrs. jacobson has the burden to prove to you by 13 a preponderance of the evidence that her husband had copd on 14 or before november 21, 1996. 15 if you answer "no" to this question, if you answer 16 "no," your verdict is for the defendants, the case is over 17 and we all go home. 18 so, let us talk about the evidence that you heard. 19 and i told you in my opening statement, i told you in my 20 opening statement, that the plaintiff would base her entire 21 argument that fred jacobson had copd on or before november 21, 22 1996, on this single medical record from dr. neil schneider. 23 you now know, ladies and gentlemen, that this is the 24 only medical record of dr. schneider's that mrs. jacobson and 25 her lawyers asked him to keep after all of his other records 1 were destroyed. you heard that after they asked him to keep 2 this record, all of his other records were destroyed. you 3 have to ask yourself why was that so. there is no good 4 explanation for that in this case, ladies and gentlemen. 5 so, all of the other evidence, all of the other 6 evidence in this case points to the fact that fred jacobson 7 did not have copd, and he certainly did not have it on or 8 before november 21, 1996. 9 so, let us talk about dr. schneider's record first. i 10 told you that dr. schneider would tell you that he made a 11 tentative diagnosis of copd, a tentative diagnosis, and that is 12 exactly what dr. schneider said when he testified. 13 i've put the testimony now in front of you. this is 14 dr. schneider's testimony. i asked him the following 15 question: 16 is not it true that you said you made a tentative 17 diagnosis of copd when you gave your deposition in this 18 case -- which you know is under oath testimony -- back in may, 19 just a few months ago? 20 his answer was: yes. 21 i then repeated it: that was the words that you used 22 was "tentative diagnosis"? 23 dr. schneider said: yes. 24 remember what else what dr. schneider told you. you 25 heard that a "tentative diagnosis" means uncertain. he was 1 not sure. 2 and what else did dr. schneider tell you about the 3 examination that he performed on april 24, 1996? he told you 4 the entire examination was one hundred percent normal. the history, 5 the physical exam, his examination of mr. jacobson's lungs, 6 the chest x-ray, one hundred percent normal. 7 so, what other evidence did you hear on this issue? 8 i tried to summarize the evidence you have heard on this board. 9 this is all the evidence that conclusively establishes he did 10 not have copd and he did not have it on or before november 21, 11 1996. 12 so, let us start with number 1. it is undisputed fred 13 jacobson did not have any symptoms, no symptoms of copd or 14 emphysema, on or before november 21, 1996. and we know that 15 because mrs. jacobson told you that in her testimony right 16 during the course of this trial. 17 here's her testimony. i asked her the following 18 questions: 19 the bottom line is, before he was diagnosed with 20 cancer, you never saw him experience any breathing 21 difficulties of any kind? 22 his answer -- her answer, excuse me: correct. 23 and you do not recall him ever being treated for 24 emphysema or copd? 25 her answer: no. 1 and you do not recall him taking any kind of 2 medications for copd or emphysema, right? 3 her answer: correct. 4 that was ronnie jacobson's testimony. her husband 5 had no breathing problems before november 21, 1996. 6 so, second, you now heard that dr. feinberg, his 7 oncologist, and three pulmonologists never diagnosed fred 8 jacobson with copd or emphysema. none of them diagnosed him 9 with that. 10 you have now heard, ladies and gentlemen, that fred 11 jacobson was treated by three different pulmonologists, 12 doctors who specialize in diagnosing copd and emphysema. you 13 heard about dr. bruce krieger, you heard about a dr. latanae 14 parker, and you heard about a dr. louis gidel. 15 here is dr. feinberg's testimony on this point. i 16 asked dr. feinberg these questions. 17 question: during the period of time that you treated 18 mr. jacobson, that three-year period, he was evaluated by 19 three separate pulmonologists, right? 20 his answer: at least. 21 the next question: all right. and we could go back 22 and look at their notes, but none of these three 23 pulmonologists ever diagnosed fred jacobson with either 24 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema, is not that 25 right? 1 his answer is: on clinical examination, no, they did 2 not diagnose him. 3 mr. kaiser and mr. finger can pull out references 4 where people say they suspect copd, they say something is 5 suspicious of emphysema or consistent with emphysema. find 6 the medical record, find the medical record where a single 7 doctor diagnosed fred jacobson with copd. it does not exist. 8 you heard about this dr. louis gidel. his final 9 diagnosis was asthmatic bronchitis. and the judge is going to 10 tell you asthma and asthmatic bronchitis are not qualifying 11 diseases. they are not qualifying diseases. they are not 12 caused by cigarette smoking. 13 dr. feinberg himself told you he did not diagnose fred 14 jacobson with copd or emphysema at any point during the three 15 years he treated him. 16 this dr. feinberg's testimony: 17 you never diagnosed fred jacobson with either chronic 18 obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema, is not the true? 19 his answer is: i -- no, i did not make a diagnosis 20 of that. 21 do not you think if any of these other pulmonologists 22 from miami had diagnosed fred jacobson with copd or emphysema, 23 the plaintiff would have him here in this courtroom and they 24 would tell you that from that witness stand? dr. krieger, 25 dr. latanae parker, dr. gidel, they did not testify. they 1 did not testify because they did not diagnose fred jacobson with 2 copd and the plaintiff knows that. that is why you did not hear 3 any of those doctors testify. 4 now, third, ladies and gentlemen, you heard fred 5 jacobson had intermittent asthma, intermittent asthma. 6 we presented the testimony of dr. william frazier. 7 he is a board-certified lung specialist, the only 8 pulmonologist, the only doctor you heard from during this 9 entire trial who treats people for copd and emphysema. he 10 walked you through all of the medical records. he showed you 11 all of the pulmonary function tests. 12 he told you that fred jacobson had mild obstruction 13 but that that obstruction improved significantly -- the word 14 he used was it reversed -- it reversed when fred jacobson was 15 given that medication called a bronchodilator and he repeated 16 the pulmonary function tests again. 17 mr. kaiser can pull statements out of these things 18 and tell you he thinks they know what they mean. but you 19 did not hear a single doctor support any of the things that 20 mr. kaiser told you. 21 dr. frazier came in. he explained it all told you. 22 he told you that the pulmonary function tests were a sure sign 23 that fred jacobson had asthma. he said he did not have 24 emphysema or copd. 25 now, you know that many of the records in the case 1 show that fred jacobson continued to have bouts of 2 intermittent asthma as an adult. here's dr. korn's record. 3 you saw this records just a moment ago. i highlighted another 4 passage. but this is dr. korn in 1998. he writes -- this is 5 fred jacobson, tells him these things. that is the only way 6 dr. korn gets the information. he says: he had childhood 7 asthma and occasionally he does wheeze. when he wheezes, he 8 has some shortness of breath, and then he writes further down 9 he wheezes occasionally. this is in 1988, when fred jacobson 10 is 45 years old. he is 45 years old. 11 here's another record. i do not believe this was 12 discussed during any of the testimony. but this is the record 13 from dr. latanae parker. he is a pulmonologist, a 14 pulmonologist who treated fred jacobson for intermittent 15 breathing problems in november of 1997 at baptist hospital. 16 and what does dr. latanae parker write: it is possible that 17 he could have a recurrence of his underlying childhood 18 asthma. 19 dr. frazier explained that to you. he explained the 20 whole thing to you. dr. parker does not diagnose fred 21 jacobson with copd or emphysema. ask mr. kaiser and 22 mr. finger to show you the record. they cannot because there 23 is no such record. it does not exist because it did not 24 happen. 25 now, finally, ladies and gentlemen, the most 1 persuasive evidence that fred jacobson did not have copd or 2 emphysema is that neither he nor mrs. jacobson ever believed 3 that he had copd or emphysema. 4 let me remind you what dr. schneider told you. let us 5 go back to dr. schneider's testimony. dr. schneider told you 6 that if he did in fact make a definitive diagnosis of copd 7 back in 1996, what did he tell you he would have done? he 8 said, i would have sat mr. and mrs. jacobson down. i would 9 have explained the results of the tests and told him you have 10 emphysema, and he said i would have done that because that is 11 the way medicine is practiced in this country. 12 here is dr. schneider's testimony. he here's the 13 question i asked him: 14 are you telling us, then, that if you did in fact, 15 definitively diagnose fred jacobson with mild copd on april 16 24, 1996, you would have sat him down, showed him the test 17 results, and explained to him the significance of what those 18 test results were? 19 his answer was: i would have showed him the test 20 results, yes. 21 that is what dr. schneider told you. 22 and ronnie jacobson herself claims, she claims she 23 remembers this conversation. she says, yes, he did tell us 24 that fred jacobson had emphysema. here is her testimony. 25 this is ronnie jacobson during the trial. 1 i asked her: 2 so, dr. schneider told you and your husband in april 3 of 1996 that he had emphysema or copd? 4 her answer: correct. 5 i asked her again: you are sure about that? 6 her answer: correct. 7 that is what ronnie jacobson said. 8 so, she claims she remembers this conversation taking 9 place in april of 1996, when again, ladies and gentlemen, she 10 could not remember that her husband quit smoking for good just 11 several months later. that is her testimony. 12 so, what evidence did you hear? neither fred nor 13 ronnie jacobson ever told a single doctor, a single doctor, 14 that he had emphysema or copd, despite the fact that you now 15 know that they had dozens of medical appointments with many, 16 many doctors over the next four years. 17 so, let us go through the records very carefully. i 18 did not blow this particular record up, but you saw it several 19 times. you know that the first time fred jacobson saw 20 dr. feinberg was on june 18, 1997. this record is in 21 evidence. this is the first time he went to see dr. feinberg 22 about his lung cancer. 23 ronnie jacobson told you, we never told dr. feinberg 24 that fred jacobson had copd or emphysema. and you can look 25 through the record. there is not a mention of it, not a 1 mention of it. that is june of 1997. 2 three months later, remember, three months later, in 3 september -- i'm going to move this down here -- you will recall 4 that three months later, in september of 1997, mr. and mrs. 5 jacobson went to dana farber cancer institute in boston for 6 him to have a second opinion about the treatment for his lung 7 cancer, and ronnie jacobson told you this was a serious 8 matter. it was life and death. fred jacobson filled out a 9 patient health history form. mrs. jacobson told you this was 10 in his own handwriting. 11 fred jacobson was asked specifically, do you have 12 emphysema. he said, i did not have emphysema. he leaves it 13 blank. but what does he check? he checks the box that says 14 allergies or asthma. 15 so fred jacobson remembers being diagnosed with 16 allergies and asthma as a young boy in the '50s, but he 17 does not remember that his primary care doctor told him he had 18 emphysema a year earlier? ask yourself if that makes any 19 sense, ladies and gentlemen. does that make any sense? 20 six months later, you heard that fred jacobson fills 21 out a social security disability application. we showed you 22 that application during mrs. jacobson's testimony. he was 23 asked about all of the medical conditions he had never been 24 diagnosed with. he puts a laundry list of things in this 25 answer. this is in his own handwriting. he even mentions 1 that he has high cholesterol and that he has an itching 2 condition. but anywhere in this application does he say i've 3 been diagnosed with emphysema or copd? of course not, because 4 he had not, ladies and gentlemen. 5 finally, i'm going to show you one more. this is 6 june 6, 2000. this is when he is admitted to the hospital by 7 dr. feinberg. dr. feinberg has been treating him now for 8 three years. he knows his past medical history extremely 9 well. he actually asks him, he asks, have you ever been 10 diagnosed with copd or emphysema. he asks ronnie jacobson and 11 fred jacobson that question. 12 what do they tell him? here's what dr. feinberg 13 writes: he has a history of tobacco abuse but no history of 14 any chronic lung disease. his wife stated that there was a 15 history of asthmatic bronchitis in the past. 16 dr. feinberg asked them the question point-blank, and 17 they tell him, no history of any chronic lung disease. 18 and what does ronnie jacobson tell him? he has 19 asthmatic bronchitis, asthmatic bronchitis, which is not a 20 qualifying disease in this case. 21 now, ultimately, mrs. jacobson had to acknowledge at 22 the end of my cross-examination of her that she never told a 23 single person, not one of his doctors, that he had copd or 24 emphysema while he was alive. this is ronnie jacobson's 25 testimony under oath before you about a week and a half ago, 1 ladies and gentlemen. 2 i asked her: now, ma'am, is not it true that while 3 your husband was alive, you never told anyone, anyone, not any 4 of your family members, not doctors, that fred jacobson had 5 emphysema or copd? is not that right? 6 her answer: correct. 7 that was her testimony under oath in this case. but 8 her lawyers stand up and tell you the answer to this question 9 ought to be yes. 10 so, despite claiming that dr. schneider told her and 11 her husband in 1996 that he had emphysema, she never told a 12 single person, not one of his doctors, that he had it. and 13 the reason, ladies and gentlemen, she never told anyone that 14 fred jacobson had copd is because he did not have it. the 15 conversation with dr. schneider never took place. he had 16 asthma and asthmatic bronchitis, just like she told 17 dr. feinberg in june of 2000, and those are not qualifying 18 diseases, as judge ungaro will tell you. 19 mrs. jacobson knows all of this to be true, but she 20 cannot admit it to you, ladies and gentlemen, because she knows 21 what the effect of that will mean for her lawsuit. 22 remember, when her lawyers and she filed the written 23 document that started this lawsuit in this court a year ago, 24 in 2012, they did not mention that fred jacobson had copd. you 25 think that was an oversight? 1 when mrs. jacobson gave her deposition under oath 2 just a few months ago, a few months before this trial, she was 3 asked by mr. pedrosa, did your husband have chronic 4 obstructive pulmonary disease? her answer was no, no. then 5 several hours went by. they had breaks. she had an 6 opportunity to talk to her lawyers, and then she comes back 7 and says, whoops, i forgot, i always knew it as copd. that is 8 what she said. 9 ladies and gentlemen, the answer to this first 10 question is no, and if you answer no, the case is over and we 11 all go home. 12 now, i'd like to talk to you about the next two 13 questions on the verdict form and i put them together because 14 they kind of go together. 15 question number 2 says: was fredric jacobson 16 addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine? 17 yes or no. 18 and if you answer yes, the next question is: 19 was his addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine a 20 legal cause of fredric jacobson's copd? 21 now, let us start with the first question, was fred 22 jacobson addicted. and let me remind you, the court is not 23 going to give you a definition of what it means to be addicted 24 in this case. and i told you in my openings the plaintiff 25 would not present an expert to you, a medical expert who would 1 explain to you from a medical standpoint what it means to be 2 addicted. instead, you heard mr. kaiser refer to passages 3 from a surgeon general's report. 4 well, that 1988 surgeon general's report actually has 5 a set of diagnosing criteria. it is on page 249, if you want 6 to bother to look, and it talks about the fact that 7 psychiatrists, addiction medicine specialists, have a series 8 of medical criteria that they use to diagnose some long term 9 heavy cigarette smokers as addicted. 10 but the plaintiff never presented an expert to you in 11 this case and she gave you no real information to conclude 12 that her husband was addicted. instead, you heard from ronnie 13 jacobson and her two children that, in their personal opinion, 14 he was addicted. that is it. that is all you have heard in this 15 case. 16 now, we read to you the deposition of dr. michael 17 weiner. he is a medical doctor and an old, old friend of fred 18 jacobson's. and we read his deposition to you in part because 19 he said hey, look, i know that addiction is a medical 20 diagnosis, and even though i know fred jacobson smoked about a 21 pack of cigarettes a day for many years, i cannot tell you 22 whether he is addicted. that is an honest opinion coming from 23 someone who does not have an interest in the outcome of the 24 case. 25 so, let us focus on mrs. jacobson's testimony. she 1 told you she knows her husband is addicted. she is sure that 2 he is addicted. but she refused to acknowledge anything, 3 anything else that might be harmful to her case that might 4 lead you to conclude that he knew the health risks and that he 5 was not addicted. 6 let me remind you of some of the things that she 7 said. she is sure that her husband was addicted. she claims 8 he was addicted. but remember, she told you, i do not really 9 know why my husband was trying to quit smoking. she told you, 10 i could not get inside of his head. she also told you, i do not 11 know when he quite smoking for good. we had to remind her 12 with the medical record. 13 she also said, i do not know whether he ever discussed 14 the health risks of smoking with anyone. 15 she told you she was not even sure whether he ever saw 16 or read the pack warnings. she said, i assume but i cannot 17 tell you for sure whether my husband enjoyed smoking 18 cigarettes. 19 so, ladies and gentlemen, she does not know any of 20 these things, any of these things, but she is darn sure he was 21 addicted. 22 so, when you evaluate mrs. jacobson's testimony, 23 please keep the following in mind: the same person who is 24 telling you he was addicted is asking you now to award her 25 millions of dollars. 1 she cannot remember or will not acknowledge things that 2 your common sense tells you, ladies and gentlemen, a wife 3 would know about her husband. and many of the things she is 4 told you about her husband and the cigarette smoking were 5 contradicted by what he told his own doctors and what he wrote 6 down in his own records many years before this lawsuit was 7 ever filed. 8 so, ask yourself, is that sufficient in a court of 9 law or do you believe actual evidence, tangible evidence from 10 a source that has no interest in the outcome of the case 11 should be required? i think the answer is obvious. the 12 plaintiff has simply failed to carry her burden to prove to 13 you that her husband was hopelessly addicted and the answer to 14 this question ought to be no, it ought to be no. 15 but even if you ultimately decide that fred jacobson 16 was addicted, your work is just beginning, because the 17 plaintiff has to prove more than that. the plaintiff bears 18 the burden to prove this question by a preponderance of the 19 evidence. they have to prove that fred jacobson's claimed 20 addiction was a legal cause of his so-called copd. 21 now, i put the instruction -- i'm going to put it up 22 here so you see what the instruction on legal cause says. and 23 frankly, ladies and gentlemen, i'm not going to read it all 24 out to you now. it is difficult to follow, no question about 25 it. 1 i highlighted the words "directly," "substantially" 2 and "but for," because i told you those words would appear in 3 the instruction. but to understand what this concept of legal 4 cause is all about, i think the best example is the one that i 5 gave you in my opening statement. 6 imagine someone walks across the street and they get 7 hit by a bus. the bus is the medical cause of why they were 8 injured. but to understand the legal cause, you need to know 9 more than that. was the light green when they tried to cross 10 the street? was the person paying attention or were they 11 distracted? were they talking on their cell phone? were they 12 texting? did the person look both ways before they crossed 13 the street? did the person know the bus was coming and yet 14 still try to beat the bus across the street? 15 you need to know all of those things to know what 16 legal cause is in this case. 17 now, in this case, ladies and gentlemen, the question 18 of legal cause really boils down to the issue of quitting. 19 was fred jacobson's claimed addiction so strong, so 20 substantial that it prevented him from quitting? 21 addiction is not the legal cause of mr. jacobson's 22 claimed copd if you find that fred jacobson was capable of 23 quitting when he was motivated to do so. instead, it is his 24 informed decision to smoke cigarettes for many years and his 25 decision not to quit for good until it was too late. 1 we all know that fred jacobson could quit smoking 2 because he did quit smoking several times for more than a year 3 or two without any assistance. 4 mr. jacobson smoked for more than 30 years not 5 because he was forced to do so by an addiction. he smoked 6 because he enjoyed it and for many years he had no real 7 interest in quitting. 8 remember the testimony you heard. he never tried a 9 nicotine patch. he never used nicotine gum. he never went to 10 a stop smoking clinic or class. he never asked his doctors or 11 anyone for help in quitting. these were all methods that were 12 available to him if he was truly motivated to quit and if, as 13 his wife would have you believe, he was struggling to quit. 14 the truth is fred jacobson was strong, independent 15 and intelligent and for many years he did not listen to what 16 his friends, his family or his doctors told him when it came 17 to cigarette smoking. 18 you heard that his old friend, alan weidberg, told 19 him, you know what, you should quit smoking. fred jacobson 20 responded, you know what, you should lose some weight. when 21 his daughter, jennifer, pestered him to quit, he said to her, 22 quit hawking me, jen, quite hawking me. alan weidberg, his 23 oldest and dearest friend told you, his attitude was, mind 24 your own business; let me live my life the way i want to live 25 it. 1 mr. jacobson demonstrated to everyone in this 2 courtroom that he was capable of quitting when he decided he 3 wanted to quit. he quit for a year in 1982, he quit for 4 several years in 1989, and he quit for good in december of 5 1996 with no assistance, no serious withdrawal and little 6 difficulty. and we know all of those things, ladies and 7 gentlemen, because that is what fred jacobson told his doctors 8 many years ago. 9 you heard dr. proctor tell you that fifty-five to 10 sixty million americans, longtime cigarette smokers, have quit 11 smoking in this country. many of them smoked more than fred 12 jacobson. the nicotine in cigarettes did not prevent these 13 people from understanding that smoking is dangerous and from 14 exercising their free will and making a decision to stop and 15 to stop for good. and you have heard no evidence during the 16 course of this trial that fred jacobson was any different. 17 in fact, even ronnie jacobson had to admit that when 18 he quit smoking for good, it was because he decided it was 19 time to quit. it was his decision and his decision alone. 20 the evidence shows fred jacobson was always in 21 control, not philip morris, not lorillard, not the nicotine in 22 cigarettes. your answer to question number 3, ladies and 23 gentlemen, should be no, and if you answer no, the case is 24 over and we go home. 25 now, if, however, you answer the first three or four 1 questions, yes -- i do not think you will get that far in this 2 case, but i want to talk to you about a couple of questions 3 that appear later on the verdict form. 4 question number 5, i put on the board here. it is 5 going to ask you to assign a percentage of responsibility for 6 fred jacobson's lung cancer and death. there is a line for 7 fred jacobson, a line for philip morris, and a line for 8 lorillard. 9 now, you heard mr. kaiser tell you that the plaintiff 10 admits that fred jacobson was partially responsible for his 11 own cancer and death, and the judge is going to repeat that in 12 her instructions. 13 so, what does that mean? it can only mean one 14 thing. it means that fred jacobson knew that cigarette 15 smoking was dangerous and caused disease, and that he had the 16 ability to quit smoking in time to avoid his injury. 17 otherwise, how could he be responsible. 18 the fact that they tell you he is partially 19 responsible is an admission that he knew the risks and he 20 could quit when he was motivated to do so. 21 you heard from his good friend, dr. michael weiner. 22 he told you fred jacobson was not the kind of person who 23 blamed other people for the decisions he made in life. he was 24 the kind of person who took full responsibility for his 25 actions. 1 and based on all of that, i respectfully suggest that 2 if you get to question 5, you assign one hundred percent of the 3 responsibility to fred jacobson. the plaintiff tells you he 4 is responsible, and that is what taking full responsibility is 5 all about, ladies and gentlemen. 6 let me show you questions 6 and 7 on the verdict 7 form. now, again, i do not think you are going to get this far 8 on the verdict form. but if you do, let me read to you 9 questions 6 and 7. they go together. these are the reliance 10 questions. i'm going try to read it. it is long. 11 please state as to each defendant whether 12 mr. jacobson relied to his detriment -- i highlighted that -- 13 on representations made by that defendant on or after may 5, 14 1982, that concealed or omitted material information 15 concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking 16 cigarettes, and, if so, whether such reliance was a legal 17 cause of his lung cancer and death. 18 so this concept of reliance is in here, legal cause. 19 now, let me make three quick points, three quick 20 points about this. if you answer yes to either question 6 or 21 7 -- i think the evidence supports the answer should be no -- 22 but if you answer yes, that percentage of responsibility that 23 we just talked about with the earlier question, question 5, 24 goes out the window; and if you decide that you want to award 25 any money to ronnie jacobson, she keeps one hundred percent of the 1 money irrespective of that assignment of responsibility. 2 second, these questions look very similar to one 3 another. so you may be asking yourself what is the difference 4 between the two. well, this question refers to each 5 defendant. it says, please state as to each defendant whether 6 mr. jacobson relied to his detriment on representations made 7 by that defendant. 8 so they are talking about the two defendants in this 9 case, philip morris and lorillard. this question is limited 10 to representations made by philip morris and lorillard. 11 question 7 broadens it a little bit to include 12 statements and representations made by other cigarette 13 companies. 14 finally, ladies and gentlemen, i want to focus you on 15 the date. there is a date in both of these questions, may 5, 16 1982, may 5, 1982. that is a requirement of florida law. so 17 the gist of what you should be thinking about with respect to 18 both of these questions is as follows. ask yourself if fred 19 jacobson made any decision about cigarette smoking because of 20 a representation made by a cigarette company after may 5, 21 1982. 22 the evidence is undisputed in this case, ladies and 23 gentlemen. fred jacobson never saw, read or heard a single 24 statement about smoking and health made by a cigarette 25 company, and certainly not after may 5, 1982; and we know that 1 because ronnie jacobson told us. her testimony on this point 2 was crystal clear, crystal clear. these are the questions i 3 asked her: 4 mr. jacobson never told you that he ever saw, read or 5 heard a single statement about smoking and health made by 6 either lorillard, philip morris, r.j. reynolds or any 7 cigarette company, for that matter, is not the true? 8 her answer was: correct. 9 well, i did not stop there. we asked her additional 10 questions. 11 you heard about some of these industry organizations 12 that dr. proctor talked about. so we asked her about those 13 too: 14 he never told you that he had ever seen, read or 15 heard a single statement put out by either the council for 16 tobacco research, the tobacco industry research committee, or 17 the tobacco institute? 18 and her answer was: yes. 19 mr. kaiser talked about all kinds of statements, 20 talked about everything dr. proctor said. mrs. jacobson told 21 you, as far as my husband told me, he never saw, he never 22 read, he never heard a single statement from a cigarette 23 company. 24 and you know now, after hearing the whole story, he 25 was not influenced by anything that cigarette companies were 1 saying or doing. mrs. jacobson told you, my husband was not 2 the kind of person who was going to be influenced by 3 advertising. he was a salesman. he understood what it was 4 all about. 5 you know that long before may 5, 1982, fred jacobson 6 was told by many people that cigarette smoking caused disease 7 and was addictive. he was told by the surgeon general in 8 1964. he was told by his friends, alan weidberg and 9 dr. michael weiner. he was told by his own children. every 10 cigarette pack from 1966 forward told him that. and 11 dr. feinberg told him in 1982. 12 you now know that for many years fred jacobson did not 13 listen to what anyone told him about cigarette smoking. so, 14 if he was not listening to his friends, his family or his 15 doctors, what makes anyone think he would have paid attention 16 to anything a cigarette company had to say? 17 he was well informed and independent. fred jacobson, 18 and only fred jacobson, made the decision to make cigarettes 19 and ultimately he was the only person that made the decision 20 to quit. 21 your answer to questions 6 and 7 should be no, ladies 22 and gentlemen, should be no. 23 now, i do not think you are going to get that far. but 24 if you get this far, you will consider the issue of compensatory 25 damages. the issue is to determine the amount of money to 1 compensate mrs. jacobson for the loss of her husband. 2 and you heard mr. kaiser ask you to award millions of 3 dollars. and frankly, i do not even know what to say about 4 that, ladies and gentlemen. but use your common sense. 5 recall mrs. jacobson's testimony under oath in this 6 courtroom. remember the things she refused to acknowledge to 7 you about her husband under oath. remember that her testimony 8 was contradicted by what her husband told his doctors many 9 years ago, by what he wrote down in his own records, and by 10 what she said in her own deposition under oath just a few 11 months ago. 12 i would respectfully suggest that if you get to the 13 issue of compensatory damages, you write in zero, zero, ladies 14 and gentlemen. we all make lifestyle choices and we have to 15 live with the consequences of those lifestyle choices. 16 now, the final issue is punitive damages and let me 17 just address that briefly. what you are being asked to decide 18 today is whether or not punitive damages should be awarded. 19 you are not deciding the amount. if you say yes that you 20 think punitive damages should be awarded, there will be an 21 additional phase of this case; there will be additional 22 evidence and witnesses presented to you; and you will have a 23 second round of deliberations to decide what the amount ought 24 to be. any punitive damages that you ultimately decide to 25 award would all go to mrs. jacobson, and only mrs. jacobson. 1 the purpose of punitive damages is to punish and 2 deter, not to compensate. so, if you decide ultimately that 3 you think mrs. jacobson is entitled to receive money for her 4 husband's decision to smoke, you will compensate her fully 5 through an award of compensatory damages. punitive damages 6 are an additional amount above and beyond any compensatory 7 damages you might award. 8 now, the court will instruct you that there is a 9 higher burden of proof. it is called clear and convincing 10 evidence. it will be defined for you in the instructions. 11 the gist of it is you have to be really, really, really 12 convinced based on the evidence you have heard that punitive 13 damages are appropriate. 14 now, let me make one last point. punitive damages 15 are warranted based only on conduct that you heard that 16 specifically affected fred jacobson. this is mr. jacobson's 17 case and only mr. jacobson's case. it is not a class action 18 anymore. it is not about other people. so this is about 19 whether the conduct you heard during the trial harmed 20 mr. jacobson specifically. 21 now, based on the evidence you have heard in this case, 22 ladies and gentlemen, there is simply no basis to award 23 punitive damages. fred jacobson was strong, independent, 24 intelligent, well informed. there is absolutely no dispute 25 about that. 1 you know that philip morris and lorillard had nothing 2 to do with the decisions he made about cigarette smoking. 3 fred jacobson made his own lifestyle choices. so there should 4 be no question that if you get to the question of punitive 5 damages, your answer should be no. 6 the court: i can only give you five more minutes, 7 mr. geraghty. 8 mr. geraghty: i'm going to be done in 45 seconds. 9 the court: okay. 10 mr. geraghty: i am going to sit down in a moment, 11 and after mr. pedrosa addresses you, mr. kaiser and mr. finger 12 will have one more opportunity to speak to you and that is 13 because the plaintiff bears the burden of proof in this case. 14 as you listen to either what mr. kaiser or mr. finger 15 says on rebuttal, i want to you remember the four key points. 16 these four key points have been proved very clearly to you 17 during the course of this trial, and they tell you everything 18 you need to know to decide the issues in this case, everything 19 you need to know. 20 we enjoy a tremendous amount of freedom in this 21 country, ladies and gentlemen. we have the right to make 22 decisions and lifestyle choices for ourselves that are not in 23 our best interests, and with that freedom comes the obligation 24 to accept personal responsibility for the consequences of 25 those decisions. 1 and at the end of the day, that is what this case is 2 all about: are we going to hold philip morris and lorillard 3 legally responsible for the informed decisions of a strong, 4 intelligent and independent man who lived his life exactly the 5 way he wanted to live it. 6 based on the evidence you have heard, i think the 7 answer is clear. the evidence supports a verdict in favor of 8 philip morris and lorillard, and i would ask you, ladies and 9 gentlemen, to return a verdict in favor of philip morris and 10 lorillard. 11 now, i am just about done and i want you to 12 understand that it has been an honor and a privilege to be 13 able to present this case to you. you have been extremely 14 attentive and patient during everything i've done during the 15 trial, and i want you to know one final time that i appreciate 16 it very much and i thank you very much for your jury service. 17 thank you. mr. pedrosa: good afternoon, everyone. on behalf of my partner, david batista, and my client, lorillard, i want to join mr. kaiser and mr. geraghty in thanking you for your service, and, in particular, in thanking you for being so attentive. you know, i owe you, i think, probably a little bit more thanks than anyone else because i'm always the last one to get up, and i usually have the least to say. so thank you for paying attention from beginning to end, even to me. you know, mr. geraghty was very thorough in going through the evidence with you from start to finish and in going through the verdict form with you. i certainly agree with everything that he said, so i'm not going to go back and cover all of that. but in thinking about where i would kind of end with you all, i figured i would end where i started. at this point it is not a real surprise what i'm going to say, but i do want to take a moment to talk about the evidence that we saw about mr. jacobson. that evidence was that mr. jacobson was a person who was informed at a very early age that there were health risks associated with smoking. we heard evidence going all the way back to the 1950s, the type of environment that his parents created, the type of environment that existed in the schools where they were required to teach about the health effects of smoking. we learned over the course of this trial that mr. jacobson was a smart man, that he was intelligent, and he understood risks and understood the risks of smoking. he was a smart, savvy businessman who was independent and made his own decisions. we learned over the course of this trial from every witness that knew mr. jacobson that he was the type of person that in all aspects of his life took charge, took control of his own decisions, and was in control of his choices including the decisions that he made about smoking. you know, for a lot of years in the 1960s and '70s mr. jacobson was aware there were risks to smoking, but he was not interested in quitting. that is what he would tell the people that would talk to him about it, like his friend alan weidberg. alan, you should go lose some weight. i will live my life, you live your life, and that is the way it is going to be. that is okay. because when mr. jacobson decided that he wanted to quit smoking in the early 1980s when his first wife bonnie was sick, he was successful and he quit. and he stayed quit for as long as he wanted to stay quit. on that particular occasion he stayed quit for about a year until the time that he met the woman that would go on to become his second wife, ronnie jacobson, who was also a smoker back then. when mr. jacobson after a year of being quit did go back to smoking, it was not nicotine that led him back to smoking. he had not had a cigarette in about a year. the nicotine was all out of his system. it was not advertisements that led him to go back to smoking. you heard the testimony from mrs. jacobson and from mr. jacobson's daughter, jennifer. he did not pay attention to advertisements. he was a salesman. he knew all about advertising, and he taught his daughter, jennifer, when she was a little girl not to trust advertisements. when mr. jacobson made the decision to go back to smoking in 1984, '83, '84, he was in control, and he did it because it was something he enjoyed doing, even though he understood that there were some risks associated with smoking. you know, mr. kaiser told you that if mr. jacobson had stayed quit at that point, had quit in the early 1980s and stayed quit, we probably would not be here because as soon as someone quits smoking, their body starts to repair itself, and the risk of getting any disease from smoking starts to go down. that is true. but i want to be very clear about one thing. we are not here to second guess mr. jacobson's decisions about how he was going to live his life. the questions that you are going to answer on that verdict form are not about whether or not you agree with the decisions that he made. nobody is here to blame him for his decisions. they were his decisions to make. you know, like everyone in this room, like everyone who lives in this country, mr. jacobson had the freedom to decide to do things that he enjoyed doing, even though they might be risky, even though they might have some long-term health consequences. you know, everyone in this country has to make those same decisions for themselves every single day. am i going to smoke or not? am i going to drink alcohol or not? how fast am i going to drive? am i going to engage in hobbies that might be dangerous or have some risks associated with them? but with the freedom to make those kinds of decisions for ourselves comes responsibility. mr. jacobson was no different. you did not hear any evidence in this case that made him any different than the 55 or 60 million americans who have quit smoking. ladies and gentlemen, those decisions were his decisions to make. it was up to him and no one else. and the evidence in this case has been clear, addiction did not control mr. jacobson. addiction did not control him when he quit smoking for a year in the early 1980s. addiction did not control him when he quit smoking for several years in the late 1980s, and addiction did not control him when he quit smoking for good in 1996. mr. jacobson was informed about the health risks of smoking. he was intelligent and understood those risks, and he made independent decisions because he was always the one in control. ladies and gentlemen, thank you.
