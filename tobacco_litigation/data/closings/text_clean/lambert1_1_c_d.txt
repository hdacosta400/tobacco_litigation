15 ms. luther: thank you, judge. 16 good afternoon, everyone. 17 may it please the court. 18 this case is not about all smokers. it is not 19 about the general public. it is not about 20 whether you believe people should smoke 21 cigarettes or not. and it is not about whether 22 you believe there are cigarette smokers out 23 there who are influenced by things that you saw 24 or heard in this trial. this case is about one, 25 and only one, cigarette smoker, jayme 4001 1 westmoreland. 2 when we started this trial almost three 3 weeks ago, i told you that there would be a main 4 story to this case and a side story. the main 5 story, of course, is ms. westmoreland, the 6 decisions and choices she made about smoking, 7 why she started, why she continued to smoke for 8 over 20 years, when did she learn about the 9 health risks of smoking, her ability to quit 10 smoking and ultimately her decision to finally 11 stop. 12 the side story and the story that plaintiff 13 wants you to focus on is the conduct of liggett 14 as a manufacturer of lark cigarettes, liggett's 15 role and the roles of other tobacco companies in 16 the industry, liggett's role in the scientific 17 issues concerning smoking and health, liggett's 18 research efforts, and ultimately, what impact 19 did liggett's statements or actions have on 20 ms. westmoreland and the decisions she made 21 about smoking. 22 i'm going to do my best this afternoon to 23 try and tie the evidence that we have seen to talk 24 about what we learned during the case and how we 25 see the facts and then talk about some of 4002 1 instructions judge day gave you and the 2 questions that you are going to be asked on the 3 verdict form. 4 now, let me say something about the findings 5 from the earlier engle case you heard about. 6 there is no debate about this. those findings do 7 not establish that liggett is liable, meaning 8 legally responsible to the plaintiff in this 9 case. 10 you now know, because judge day instructed 11 you, that you get to decide by your verdict in 12 this case whether those findings have any 13 applicability to ms. westmoreland, whether those 14 findings have any context in the story that 15 you have now heard about her and how she lived her 16 life. after all, this case is about 17 ms. westmoreland. 18 her daughter filed this lawsuit and now is 19 asking you to award her and her brother up to 20 $20 million for their mother's decisions to 21 smoke cigarettes for more than 20 years. and 22 you are the only people who have heard 23 ms. westmoreland's story. the engle jury did not 24 hear a thing about ms. westmoreland. 25 so what is ms. westmoreland's story? she 4003 1 smoked for reasons known only to herself. she 2 was aware from the first time she picked up a 3 cigarette at her aunt's house that smoking was 4 dangerous. 5 she demonstrated the ability to quit, if 6 that was what she wanted to do. 7 there is nothing that liggett did that made 8 ms. westmoreland start smoking or kept her from 9 quitting for all those years, and there is 10 nothing that liggett, or anyone else, for that 11 matter, could have done or said that would have 12 made ms. westmoreland choose to stop smoking any 13 sooner than she did. 14 ms. westmoreland did not follow the urgings 15 of her father and her brother not to start 16 smoking or later to quit, and she did not heed 17 the warnings that went on every single pack of 18 cigarettes she smoked starting in 1966, shortly 19 after she first experimented with her first 20 cigarette. 21 notwithstanding the extensive information 22 available to her throughout the entire time that 23 she smoked regarding the health risks of smoking 24 and the benefits of quitting, ms. westmoreland 25 chose on her own terms to smoke, just like she 4004 1 did everything else in her life. 2 given that backdrop, should liggett be held 3 responsible for ms. westmoreland's death? 4 should liggett be required to pay money to 5 ms. lambert and mr. westmoreland for their 6 mother's lifestyle choices over the decades that 7 she smoked? 8 i told you in jury selection that it is 9 liggett's position that ms. westmoreland was 100 10 percent responsible for the choices she made and 11 her ultimate illness. that has not changed. 12 we also discussed during jury selection and 13 i mentioned again in my opening, this is a very 14 sad case. it would be impossible not to feel 15 sympathy for mrs. lambert and mr. westmoreland. 16 it is never easy to lose a parent, and it is 17 especially difficult to do so under these 18 circumstances. but that does not mean that 19 liggett is responsible for ms. westmoreland's 20 injuries or that liggett should be required to 21 compensate mrs. lambert and mr. westmoreland for 22 that loss. 23 now i want to highlight a couple of the 24 instructions that judge day gave you. and i'm 25 not very good with the elmo, so let us see how i 4005 1 can manage this. 2 so, "you may use reason and common sense to 3 reach conclusions." 4 can you all see that? i know i'm kind of 5 blocking. okay. let us see. okay. 6 "you may use reason and common sense to 7 reach conclusions. you may draw reasonable 8 inferences from the evidence. and in evaluating 9 the believability of the witnesses and what 10 weight to give the testimony of any particular 11 witness, you may properly consider the demeanor 12 of the witness while testifying, the frankness 13 or lack of frankness of the witness, the 14 intelligence of the witness, any interest the 15 witness may have in the outcome of the case, the 16 means and opportunity the witness had to know 17 the facts about which the witness testified, the 18 ability of the witness to remember matters about 19 which the witness testified, and the 20 reasonableness of the testimony of the witness 21 considered in light of all the evidence in the 22 case and in light of your own experience and 23 common sense." 24 reason and common sense. you all did not 25 leave that behind you when this trial started. 4006 1 we ask that you rely on that when you evaluate 2 the testimony of the various witnesses who 3 testified in this case. 4 with that in mind, what did the evidence 5 show? what kind of person was jayme 6 westmoreland? everyone who came into this 7 courtroom, either live or by deposition 8 testimony, who knew ms. westmoreland described 9 her the same way. 10 mrs. lambert said her mother was 11 intelligent, disciplined. she was both smart 12 and had street smarts and she took 13 responsibility for her actions. 14 mr. westmoreland said his mother was a strong 15 person. she was strong-willed. she was 16 intelligent. she had common sense. and if she 17 set her mind to accomplishing something, she did 18 it. 19 roxan, her sister, said that she was smart 20 and also said that she had street smarts. she 21 was intelligent. and, importantly, roxan told 22 us that ms. westmoreland was not gullible. and 23 on two occasions she volunteered that ms. 24 westmoreland essentially did what she wanted. 25 this was a series of questions that was 4007 1 asked during trial. 2 "identified a problem for herself. 3 "yes. 4 "and set about resolving that problem for 5 herself. 6 "yes, she did. 7 "she did not need any help from anybody to do 8 that, did she? 9 "no, she did what she wanted." 10 ms. luther: am i in your way, ms. bjostad? 11 juror bjostad: no. 12 "did you ever have a conversation with jayme 13 about the warnings on the cigarette packs? 14 "no. she would do what she wanted to do." 15 that is what roxan said about her sister. 16 wayne westmoreland, her brother, 17 corroborated all of this. 18 i thought it was interesting that the 19 plaintiff did not call wayne westmoreland to 20 testify on their side of the case. i mean, in 21 all of this he was the person who was closest to 22 ms. westmoreland when she started smoking. so 23 we brought his testimony so you would get the 24 full picture. 25 and he said his sister was intelligent and 4008 1 had common sense and if she made her mind up to 2 do something, she did it. and in case you 3 were not already getting this picture, he told us 4 that she was not easily led. like roxan said, 5 she would do what she wanted to do. 6 even dr. pell, one of the treating 7 physicians who came here to testify live, agreed 8 that she was intelligent. and he did not agree 9 with much of anything that we asked him. 10 the bottom line of all of this was that 11 ms. westmoreland was no one's dupe. 12 so what have we learned from the witnesses 13 about when ms. westmoreland started smoking and 14 why? you might remember the timeline that i had 15 put up during my opening. so right about here, 16 in 1965, ms. westmoreland smokes her first 17 cigarette. ms. westmoreland was with her 18 brother, wayne, when she had her first cigarette 19 when she was 14 or 15 years old. and remember, 20 you were told she was born in 1951. 21 what happened when she stole that parliament 22 cigarette from her aunt, lit up, breathed 23 cigarette smoke into her lungs for the first 24 time? she coughed. and her brother laughed at 25 her, and he asked her if she was sure she wanted 4009 1 to do that. she coughed. she only took three 2 hits off the cigarette and she put it out. and 3 he did not see her smoke again until she was 17 4 years old, which was consistent with what roxan 5 also said. and she was around roxan all the 6 time because she was her surrogate mother. 7 the first time roxan saw ms. westmoreland 8 smoke was when roxan was about seven or eight 9 years old, which would have made 10 ms. westmoreland about 17 or 18 years old 11 because there was a ten year difference between 12 the two of them. this was around the time 13 ms. westmoreland was a senior in high school, so 14 we are talking about 1968 or 1969. 15 even the medical records, based on 16 information ms. westmoreland personally provided 17 to her treating physicians, corroborate that she 18 started smoking regularly in the 1970s when she 19 was in her 20s. 20 here is a compilation of the medical records 21 that are going to go back to the jury room with 22 you. she stated she had smoked a pack and 23 one -- a pack and a half a day for 21 years. 24 this is what she told dr. pell on november 25th. 25 and she smokes one to two packages daily and has 4010 1 done so for the past 20 years, november 26, 2 1993. 3 and we know that her first regular brand was 4 parliament. that was the brand she stole from 5 her aunt, and that is the brand she continued to 6 smoke until sometime shortly before she moved to 7 south carolina when she was about 18 years old. 8 parliament is not a liggett brand. 9 plaintiff makes a big deal about the fact 10 that her brother only actually witnessed her 11 with 40 total parliament cigarettes. they 12 emphasized that in wayne westmoreland's 13 testimony. but wayne was very clear that this 14 was her first regular brand. this is what he 15 said about this. 16 "when she was smoking at age 17, what brand 17 was she smoking? 18 "it was not lark. it was something else. i 19 think she was smoking parliament back then. 20 "and do you recall how many occasions you 21 saw her smoke parliament back then? 22 "when i saw her smoke whatever, it was 23 parliament." 24 and then one more segment, which we may or 25 may not have. we do. great. 4011 1 "and during the time until she went away to 2 south carolina, what brands of cigarettes? 3 "the one i recall most from that period of 4 time would have been parliament." 5 wayne was also very clear that when she 6 moved to south carolina she was smoking less 7 than he was at the time, and he was smoking 8 about a half a pack a day. so by 1969 or so 9 she is only smoking about a half a pack a day. 10 plaintiff claims that liggett concealed 11 material information from ms. westmoreland, and 12 if she had the information that was supposedly 13 concealed, she would have been able to avoid her 14 lung cancer. that is just not credible. 15 we have a wealth of information available to 16 us that demonstrates the falsity of this claim. 17 the timeline sets out all the relevant dates. 18 we have got the 1964 surgeon general's report 19 before she even smokes her first cigarette. we 20 have a caution label on packs in '66. and at 21 this point in time she is not even a regular 22 smoker. 23 in the early 1950s emerging scientific 24 information linking cigarette use with lung 25 cancer was so well-publicized that it started a 4012 1 cancer scare. you saw the graph that mr. 2 gustafson put up earlier this morning and the 3 decline. it is not a big decline on the graph, 4 but it was a decline. there was a precipitous 5 decline of people who were smoking in the 1950s 6 because of the mouse skin-painting studies and 7 the other studies that were coming out linking 8 the tar and cigarette smoke to cancer. 9 in the mid 1950s with the publication of the 10 wynder and graham mouse skin-painting study, 11 cigarette use declined in the united states. 12 and throughout the 1950s and '60s, as more 13 scientific evidence emerged showing the 14 relationship between lung cancer and cigarettes, 15 there was more information that was publicized 16 by newspapers, magazines, television news and 17 the like. 18 you know, by 1963 the information regarding 19 lung cancer and cigarettes was so widely known 20 that it was a common association in popular 21 movies and television programs. and you may 22 remember this clip. 23 (video clip was played and taken down to the best 24 of the reporter's ability as follows:) 25 paul newman: you know, i'm going out pretty 4013 1 soon and my credit is kind of shaky. 2 geraldine page: i would like to smoke, 3 please. no, no. just one of the ordinary 4 cigarettes that only give you cancer. 5 (video clip concluded.) 6 ms. luther: just one of the ordinary 7 cigarettes. they only give you cancer. 8 the story culminated with the publication of 9 the 1964 surgeon general's report, which we have 10 talked a lot about in this case. this is one of 11 the most important news stories of the 20th 12 century. mrs. westmoreland started smoking 13 after that report came out. news that the 14 surgeon general had concluded that smoking 15 caused lung cancer in men was everywhere you 16 turned back then. 17 she watched the television news every night. 18 as wayne testified, their father told them to 19 shut up and learn something when the news was 20 on. and the 1964 surgeon general's report was 21 news everywhere, on television and in the 22 newspapers. 23 you saw examples of that coverage when 24 dr. dibacco was on the stand. and wayne 25 westmoreland confirmed that coverage of the 1964 4014 1 surgeon general's report was everywhere where 2 they lived, even in red bank, new jersey. 3 if there was any question regarding the 4 impact of the 1964 surgeon general's report, all 5 you had to do was look at what was happening to 6 the rates of cigarette smoking in the four years 7 after it came out. 8 smoking rates started to decline 9 precipitously, even before the surgeon general's 10 report came out in '64. when huge numbers of 11 smokers across the united states were quitting 12 smoking cold turkey, jayme westmoreland made a 13 different choice. she started smoking and 14 became a regular smoker. 15 professor dibacco explained in 1964 16 information regarding health and cancer risks of 17 cigarettes was flooding the public through 18 newspapers, magazines and news stories. in that 19 year the american medical association stated 20 that the health hazards of excessive smoking 21 have been well-publicized for more than ten 22 years and are common knowledge. 23 and i know mr. gustafson took a shot at the 24 ama because they were receiving money from the 25 tobacco companies for doing research into 4015 1 issues of smoking and health, but would they 2 have been able to get away with a statement like 3 that? do you think they really would have been 4 able to surmount scrutiny for a statement like 5 that if it were not accurate? 6 by 1964 professor dibacco explained that the 7 not-proven statements by the tobacco institute 8 and other industry representatives were not given 9 much credibility or even prominence in the 10 public press. nobody got their health 11 information from tobacco representatives or paid 12 cigarette advertisements. 13 by the late 1960s the american cancer 14 society and other not-for-profit groups 15 published public service announcements spreading 16 the message about health risks and lung cancer 17 risks of smoking cigarettes. and we showed you 18 some of those. this is just one to remind you 19 of what some of those messages were. 20 (video clip was played and taken down to the best 21 of the reporter's ability as follows:) 22 voice: you lose. 23 (video clip concluded.) 24 ms. luther: the message of this public 25 service announcement is pretty clear. you buy a 4016 1 pack of cigarettes, you are gambling with your 2 life. this was 1969, when jayme westmoreland 3 was 18 years old, around the time that she 4 became a regular smoker. 5 by the early 1970s the federal trade 6 commission was monitoring and regulating 7 cigarette advertising. and every cigarette ad 8 and every cigarette pack was required to include 9 its tar and nicotine values as measured by the 10 ftc method. 11 by 1972 cigarette companies were no longer 12 permitted to advertise on television or radio. 13 the surgeon general's 1964 was one of the top 14 stories of the 20th century. and she started 15 smoking after that report came out. 16 when huge numbers of smokers continued to 17 quit, jayme westmoreland continued to smoke. 18 and throughout the years that she continued to 19 smoke, the rates of smoking in the united states 20 continued to drop. more than half of ever 21 smokers have quit. more people have quit 22 smoking than not. and around the time that she 23 started smoking, the debate was raging about 24 putting warnings on the packs. and they 25 actually went on the packs years before she was 4017 1 a regular smoker. 2 and before i go any further, i want to make 3 it clear, liggett is not criticizing jayme 4 westmoreland for her decision to smoke. it is 5 something that we are -- we live in america. we 6 live in the united states. these are decisions 7 that we are all entitled to make. and she made a 8 decision, and she smoked. and now her children 9 are trying to get money for it. but liggett is 10 not criticizing jayme westmoreland for her 11 decision to smoke cigarettes. 12 now, she saw the warnings on the packs 13 starting in 1966. and this is what the first 14 warning said: "caution: cigarette smoking may 15 be hazardous to your health." and this warning 16 was a warning that was required by congress, 17 written by congress. and it ran from january 1, 18 1966 through october 31st, 1970. 19 then in 1969, around the time that she 20 became a regular smoker, the warnings changed 21 again. and every time she picked up a pack of 22 cigarettes, it said, "warning: the surgeon 23 general has determined that cigarette smoking is 24 dangerous to your health." 25 again, this is language, verbiage that 4018 1 congress dictated we were required to put on the 2 packs. it was not information that the companies 3 put on voluntarily. there were congressional 4 hearings and they talked about the content of 5 the warnings. and this is what congress decided 6 that the companies were going to put on the 7 packs. 8 the reason it said this as opposed to 9 smoking causes lung cancer, i suspect, is 10 because at the time there was information that 11 smoking impacted other aspects of people's 12 health, so rather than limit it to lung cancer, 13 they wanted to get the broader message out that 14 it caused health hazards. 15 her father told her she should not smoke 16 because it was bad for her health. 17 and with all of this personal information 18 available to her, she clearly knew that smoking 19 carried real health risks. 20 ms. westmoreland knew that smoking came with 21 health risks in the 1960s, and she started 22 smoking and continued smoking and never tried to 23 quit once in the 1960s. and she knew that 24 smoking came with health risks in the 1970s. 25 and she continued smoking and never tried to 4019 1 quit in the 1970s. and she started -- she 2 continued smoking in the 1980s. and the 3 evidence is that it was not until at least the 4 mid 1980s that she tried to quit for the very 5 first time. 6 she did not have to start smoking and she 7 could have chosen to stop smoking at any point 8 in time before she finally stopped in 1993, 9 months before she was diagnosed with lung 10 cancer. 11 plaintiff would have you believe that she 12 could not stop smoking because of an addiction to 13 nicotine. 14 so what do we know about nicotine? we know 15 that it occurs naturally in tobacco. and we 16 know that nicotine is out of the bloodstream of 17 a smoker within 12 to 48 hours of smoking 18 cessation. we know that its existence was not a 19 secret nor was it a secret that nicotine was the 20 reason why people smoke. 21 it is not information that the tobacco 22 companies were hiding from the world. and it 23 certainly was not information that liggett was 24 hiding from the public health community. 25 liggett actually told the surgeon general in 4020 1 its 1963 submission to the surgeon general's 2 committee, which i'll discuss in more detail in 3 a bit, that nicotine had physiological effects 4 and that people did not smoke other things 5 because they did not have nicotine in them. 6 in volume four of the submission, and i have 7 some excerpts from the submission which is in 8 evidence as defendant's exhibit 42, this is what 9 liggett told the surgeon general about 10 nicotine's effect on the smoker. 11 "the highly active pharmacologic agent 12 characteristically in tobacco and its smoke, the 13 pleasurable effects of low doses of this 14 alkaloid, as well as tobacco aroma and flavor 15 characteristics presumably are the reasons why 16 people smoke tobacco instead of some other 17 material." 18 and they go on to say, "it is been found to 19 be one of the most potent central nervous system 20 arousal agents known." 21 that sounds like a lot like what dr. hurt 22 and dr. brady were telling you in this 23 courtroom. liggett was not hiding the ball. 24 that is in the 1963 submission to the surgeon 25 general's committee. 4021 1 even though the surgeon general in 1964 2 declined to call nicotine addictive, he did say 3 it was habituating, meaning it was 4 habit-forming. this was information that was 5 available to everybody. and he was very careful 6 to point out that just because he was calling it 7 habituating does not mean it is easy to quit. 8 here are a couple of excerpts from the 1964 9 surgeon general's report that say just that. 10 "the tobacco habit should be characterized as a 11 habituation rather than an addiction. 12 discontinuation of smoking, although possessing 13 the difficulties attendant upon distinction of 14 any conditioned reflex, the behavioral aspects 15 of smoking is accomplished best by reinforcing 16 factors." 17 then is that 351? do you also have -- was 18 it 34, josh? 19 "thus, correctly designating the chronic use 20 of tobacco as habituation rather than addiction 21 carries with it no implication that the habit 22 may be broken easily." 23 they knew this. this was not something that 24 was being hidden by the tobacco companies. 25 professor dibacco -- actually, let me back 4022 1 up. 2 dr. brady told us that even today, 50 years 3 later, we are learning how nicotine impacts the 4 question of addiction. but regardless of that 5 fact, it had been known for a very long time 6 when jayme westmoreland started smoking in the 7 1960s that once you start it can be difficult to 8 stop. dr. brady confirmed that, and dr. dibacco 9 showed you that. and you just saw that liggett 10 told the surgeon general in 1963 what it knew 11 about the subject. it was not hiding the ball. 12 professor dibacco testified that the 13 addiction risks of cigarettes were well-known in 14 the united states before 1950 and even before 15 ms. westmoreland was born. by the 1930s and 16 '40s terms such as "nicotine addict" and 17 "nicotine fiend" were understood and accepted in 18 popular culture, so much so that we saw an 19 example of the term "nicotine addict" in the 20 1942 alfred hitchcock film saboteur. 21 (video clip was played and taken down to the best 22 of the reporter's ability as follows:) 23 voice: hey, buddy, hold the wheel a while, 24 will you, while i elevate this thing. i'm a 25 nicotine addict. 4023 1 (video clip concluded.) 2 ms. luther: professor dibacco also 3 illustrated the extent to which the addiction 4 risks of cigarettes were understood by showing 5 the elementary textbooks from the 1930s were 6 required to teach children that cigarettes pose 7 significant health risks, including that 8 nicotine is habit-forming and makes people want 9 to smoke all the time. 10 this is an excerpt from one of those 11 textbooks. "tobacco does no one any good. it 12 does some people a great deal of harm." 13 scrolling down to the bottom. "the tobacco 14 habit grows on most people. that is, it gets 15 worse. they smoke more and more until they are 16 smoking nearly all the time. bad habits are 17 hard to stop. do not start them." 18 by the early 1960s there was widespread 19 information in magazines and newspapers 20 referring to the addiction risks of cigarettes 21 and advocating different methods to quit. we 22 saw numerous articles in time, newsweek, life 23 magazine and reader's digest, periodicals that 24 had widespread national circulation in the 25 1950s, '60s and '70s that recommended and 4024 1 proposed methods on how to stop cigarette 2 smoking. and this is illustrated in defendant's 3 exhibits 24, 25, and 26, just a sampling of the 4 articles about how to quit smoking. 5 we saw numerous references in the press to 6 nicotine as the addictive agent of cigarettes, 7 and we saw that by the 1960s there were already 8 smoking-cessation clinics that were opening up 9 all around the country. 10 there were no secrets regarding the 11 addictive nature of cigarettes. by the 1950s 12 everyone understood that cigarettes were 13 addictive and could be extremely difficult to 14 quit. 15 the only thing that was not well-settled was 16 the terminology, whether cigarettes should be 17 formally labeled with the term "addiction" or 18 whether they should instead be referred to by 19 the terms "dependence" or "habituation." 20 in 1964 the surgeon general did not believe 21 that "addiction" was the appropriate term for 22 cigarettes and instead used "habituation," 23 because back then it was felt that if you label 24 somebody an addict you are essentially consigning 25 them to a mental health disease. and that 4025 1 was not considered appropriate at the time. and 2 that is in the 1964 surgeon general's report. 3 so it was not until 1988 that the surgeon 4 general decided to make a change and formally 5 adopt the word "addiction" for cigarettes. the 6 dsm-5, which was revised in 2014 and was shown 7 to you during the testimony of dr. hurt and 8 dr. brady and in mr. gustafson's closing, is 9 used by physicians and clinicians today to 10 diagnose numerous forms of substance abuse and 11 uses the term "tobacco use disorder." it 12 does not use "addiction" either. 13 during the trial plaintiffs showed you the 14 video of the ceos from the different companies 15 testifying before congress in 1994 where they 16 were told, "we have your written statements, so 17 we just want the sound bite for the news. so 18 you can only answer yes or no to this question. 19 is nicotine addictive?" 20 and then they go down the line. "is 21 nicotine addictive?" yes or no? yes or no? 22 yes or no? yes or no? 23 you were showed a clip where mr. johnston of 24 the r.j. reynolds tobacco company tried to 25 expound on his answer and he started to say, 4026 1 "nicotine is not addictive using the traditional 2 definition of addiction, which requires 3 intoxication," and he was cut off. they said, 4 yes or no. yes or no. 5 so, you know, you heard the sound bite, but 6 you did not hear the written statements of the 7 companies which explained what their full 8 positions were. 9 regardless, 1994, this happened after 10 ms. westmoreland quit smoking. we should not get 11 caught up in these terms of art. the plain fact 12 is that it was well-known and widely accepted by 13 the 1950s that cigarettes were habit forming, 14 addictive and difficult to quit, irrespective of 15 what words were used to describe it. 16 mr. gustafson talked about the testimony of 17 dr. lebow and dr. dietz, who engaged in an 18 intellectual exercise about the word 19 "addiction." and both said something along the 20 lines of if a smoker is addicted then they do not 21 have free choice. 22 neither of them is an addiction expert, like 23 dr. brady and dr. hurt. they answered that 24 question as lay people. they were led down a 25 garden path by attorneys in litigation and they 4027 1 fell into the trap that plaintiff wants you to 2 fall into here. 3 one more thing on addiction. plaintiff 4 talked about the research liggett was doing 5 using calcium hydroxide to increase the free 6 nicotine available in the cigarette smoke. at 7 this point in time when this research was being 8 conducted, all of the companies and some of the 9 public health officials were all doing research, 10 working hard to find a cigarette that would be 11 less hazardous. and this is one of the ideas 12 that liggett researchers were working on in this 13 regard. 14 you also heard that at one point liggett 15 added lactic acid and diammonium phosphate -- 16 i'm just going to call that dap -- to lark 17 cigarettes. dr. cummings confirmed that these 18 substances are used in products other than 19 cigarettes, things like baked goods and corn 20 tortillas. and this is another example of what 21 you did not hear anyone say, and that is that 22 adding either of these things made cigarettes 23 more addictive. no one said that. 24 but you did hear them say that adding both 25 of these things impacted the taste of 4028 1 cigarette. we know dap made more sugar 2 available. 3 now, dr. dietz confirmed in his deposition 4 that was read to you that liggett never used 5 additives to affect the ph, which in turn 6 affects the free nicotine in any commercially 7 available cigarette, including lark. he 8 confirmed liggett used these substances to 9 smooth the taste of the smoke. 10 the design of these -- excuse me. 11 the design of these cigarettes is no 12 different than the design of all the cigarettes 13 smoked by the 60 million people who quit 14 smoking. but you have had the benefit of hearing 15 expert testimony before you have to answer this 16 question. and you know that every one of 17 plaintiff's expert witnesses who talked about 18 addiction came in here and confirmed that even 19 people who are addicted can and do quit every 20 day. while dr. brady said it is a constrained 21 choice, it is still a choice. and only the 22 smoker can make the decision to stop. 23 60 million people have quit smoking since 24 the 1964 surgeon general's report. 1.3 million 25 people quit every year. and according to 4029 1 dr. brady, the vast majority of these people 2 were nicotine dependent when they stopped. 3 everybody can quit smoking. and jayme 4 westmoreland did quit smoking. 5 even surgeon general koop, the surgeon 6 general who changed the definition of addiction 7 to eliminate the requirement of intoxication, 8 has stated that the individual smoker has to 9 make the decision whether to stop engaging in 10 the behavior. 11 so was ms. westmoreland addicted to 12 nicotine? it is true that the more advanced 13 therapies that are available today to help 14 people quit smoking were not available before 15 ms. westmoreland passed away. but there were 16 things that were available that she could have 17 tried if she had been inclined. 18 smoking-cessation clinics were available 19 going back to the 1960s. dr. hurt, who was 20 smoking three to four packs a day, stopped 21 smoking by going to one of those clinics in the 22 1970s. there is absolutely no evidence that 23 ms. westmoreland even tried to stop smoking 24 before the mid 1980s. her brother told her to 25 quit after 1980 when he quit smoking, and she 4030 1 essentially ignored him. 2 now, nicotine gum was available starting in 3 the early 1980s. i think 1982 was the date that 4 we were told. but she did not even try it until 5 sometime when cydne was in elementary school in 6 the mid to late 1980s. and no one knew whether 7 she used it the way she was supposed to use it. 8 she used the nicotine patch at some point, 9 too, but neither mrs. westmoreland or 10 mrs. lambert could say she used it regularly. 11 mrs. lambert remembered only three different 12 instances of seeing the patch on her mother's 13 arm, and she did not know if it was from one 14 prescription or multiple prescriptions. 15 what we do know is while she was using those 16 products she was getting nicotine in her system, 17 so there was clearly something she was getting 18 from the cigarettes other than nicotine that 19 kept her smoking. 20 we know she -- that she stopped smoking for 21 days at a time and quit for about two weeks in 22 1990. but for reasons known only to 23 ms. westmoreland, she returned to smoking after 24 the nicotine was out of her system. there is the 25 rub. all of the plaintiff's experts concede 4031 1 this. in order to quit you have to decide you 2 want to quit. when she finally decided she was 3 going to stop smoking, she did stop. she did it 4 cold turkey. she did it before she felt sick. 5 you heard from the people closest to 6 ms. westmoreland about this, her children. 7 their memories on this were consistent. 8 mrs. lambert told you she quit sometime before 9 her diagnosis. mr. westmoreland told you that 10 she quit four to six months before her 11 diagnosis. both agreed she quit before she 12 started to feel sick. 13 remember, these are the people who were 14 closest to her. they were living with her day 15 in and day out. mrs. lambert was even working 16 with her during this period of time at the 17 lobster pot. so she did not see her smoking at 18 home and she did not see her smoking at work. 19 and the medical records indicate that she 20 made significant lifestyle changes about three 21 months before she was diagnosed. right here. 22 "she is a person who in the past three months 23 has changed the quality of her life greatly. 24 she stated that she had smoked a pack and a half 25 a day for 21 years." 4032 1 if she had still been smoking, her children 2 would have known. you can tell these things. 3 you can smell the smoke on her clothes or in her 4 car or in her hair. 5 the plaintiff wants you to believe that she 6 was still smoking when she was diagnosed. she 7 bases that theory on the testimony of dr. pell 8 and dr. paonessa, recalled 20 years after they 9 last saw and treated her. 10 this is one of the things that you get to 11 evaluate, the instruction that i put up when i 12 first started, regarding the credibility of a 13 witness. 14 continued smoking is something that a doctor 15 treating a patient for suspected lung cancer is 16 going to document in his records. it is just 17 common sense. and dr. paonessa told you that 18 accurately documenting her smoking history was 19 important to her treatment. if she really was 20 still smoking and it was important to her 21 treatment and important that she stop, why 22 did not either of them offer to help her stop 23 smoking, offer to prescribe her 24 smoking-cessation aids, which neither of them 25 did? instead, dr. pell did just the opposite. 4033 1 he recorded that she quit smoking in his 2 records. "and has quit for the past several 3 weeks." 4 neither dr. pell, who saw her only twice 5 before she was admitted to the hospital where 6 she was not allowed to and did not smoke, nor 7 dr. paonessa ever saw her smoke. but plaintiff 8 would have you accept the doctors' testimony on 9 this matter over her own recollections and the 10 recollection of her brother. 11 now, with this as the framework for the 12 evaluation of the claim for addiction, let us 13 talk about the dsm-5, which dr. brady agreed is 14 the bible that psychiatrists use when diagnosing 15 mental disorders. 16 mr. sales: objection. no such word was 17 used by the evidence. 18 ms. luther: actually, i can pull the 19 transcript, judge, if you would like to see it. 20 the court: i -- overruled. 21 ms. luther: to qualify for a diagnosis of 22 tobacco use disorder -- remember i told you they 23 do not use the word "addiction" in the dsm -- 24 ms. westmoreland had to exhibit a problematic 25 pattern of tobacco use leading to clinically 4034 1 significant impairment or distress. 2 so you have to have a problematic pattern of 3 using tobacco within a 12-month period of time, 4 so you are looking at symptoms in a 12-month 5 period of time. 6 you heard the pattern of symptoms. 7 mr. gustafson had them up on the board when he 8 went through his closing. they involve impaired 9 control, social impairment, risky use and 10 pharmacologic dependence. and these symptoms 11 have to rise to the level of clinically 12 significant distress or impairment. 13 here there is no evidence that 14 ms. westmoreland had a problematic pattern of 15 using tobacco that rose to the level of 16 clinically significant impairment other than the 17 fact that she smoked a pack to a pack and a half 18 a day. 19 and dr. brady herself confirmed that the 20 amount that a person smokes alone is not enough 21 to diagnose addiction. 22 and there is no evidence that her use of 23 cigarettes resulted in social impairment. she 24 went to work. she took care of her kids. she 25 took care of her house. she took care of her 4035 1 dogs. 2 and there is no evidence of risky use. i 3 think they tried to say something along the 4 lines that there was evidence she had smoked in 5 bed. but that evidence really is not clear. 6 there is evidence she kept her cigarettes 7 near the bed and when she got out of bed as she 8 was walking to the bathroom, she had a 9 cigarette. so smoking in bed would be a risky 10 behavior. fires start. smoking when you are 11 pumping gas would be a risky behavior. smoking 12 when you are in the bathroom of an airplane would 13 be a risky behavior. there is no evidence of 14 that in this case. 15 when she returned to smoking after 16 successfully stopping for periods of days or 17 even weeks, no one knows why she started smoking 18 again. 19 dr. brady confirmed that the physiologic 20 withdrawal symptoms one experiences from 21 nicotine withdrawal typically peak within 12 to 22 72 hours and most are gone after only a couple 23 of weeks. so her return to smoking after she 24 had stopped for a few days or a couple of weeks 25 likely had nothing to do with relieving 4036 1 withdrawal symptoms. 2 so looking at the evidence from this 3 perspective, it is clear plaintiff cannot meet 4 her burden to the greater weight of evidence 5 that ms. westmoreland was addicted, meaning that 6 she had severe tobacco use disorder. 7 giving her the benefit of the doubt, at most 8 she had mild tobacco use disorder. even though 9 she was addicted to nicotine, did that addiction 10 cause her lung cancer? definitely not. 11 like mr. gustafson, i want to go over a 12 couple of the more important jury instructions 13 and the verdict form that you will take back 14 into the jury room with you. 15 now, you heard it in jury selection and i've 16 already said it once, but i'm going to say it 17 again. plaintiff has the burden of proof in 18 this case. you already know this. it is up to 19 her to prove that ms. westmoreland was addicted 20 to smoking and that her addiction to smoking was 21 the legal cause of her death, not the medical 22 cause, the legal cause. and plaintiff has to 23 prove this by the greater weight of the 24 evidence. 25 so what does it mean for something to be a 4037 1 legal cause? here's the instruction. 2 "addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine was 3 a legal cause of ms. westmoreland's lung cancer 4 if it directly and in natural and continuous 5 sequence produced or contributed substantially 6 to producing such lung cancer so that it can be 7 said that but for -- but for the addiction to 8 cigarettes containing nicotine the lung cancer 9 would not have occurred." 10 we submit that plaintiff cannot satisfy that 11 burden. now, it is a little hard to follow with 12 all the legalese in it, but you will see the words 13 provided -- or sorry, "produced or contributed 14 substantially to producing." so the addiction 15 has to produce or contribute to producing -- 16 substantially to producing the lung cancer. 17 rather than parse the words, let me give you 18 an example. if someone walks across the street 19 and gets hit by a bus, clearly the bus is the 20 medical cause of whatever injuries they sustain. 21 but in order to understand the legal cause, you 22 have to know more about what is going on. was 23 the person texting while they crossed the 24 intersection? was the light red or green when 25 they crossed the intersection? you need to know 4038 1 more information. and were they talking on 2 their cell phone? were they paying attention? 3 the simple point being, you need to know 4 more about the circumstances of the individual 5 before you can determine that the addiction is 6 the legal cause. you need to know all of these 7 things before you can determine whether 8 addiction was the legal cause in this case. 9 here you get to consider whether 10 ms. westmoreland's decision to continue smoking 11 despite warnings all around her was the legal 12 cause of her lung cancer. you get to consider 13 whether she could have tried harder to quit. 14 and as mrs. westmoreland (sic) has admitted, 15 told you herself when she was on the stand, she 16 certainly could have. 17 so here is the verdict form, and these are 18 the first two questions you are going to have to 19 answer. 20 "was ms. westmoreland addicted to cigarettes 21 containing nicotine?" 22 we submit that your answer to that question 23 is no. if your answer was yes, you would go on 24 to answer question 2. 25 and that question is: "was an addiction to 4039 1 cigarettes containing nicotine a legal cause of 2 ms. westmoreland's lung cancer and death?" 3 i would submit to you your answer to that 4 question should also be no. if you answer no to 5 either one of these questions, you are done. you 6 sign the verdict form and we thank you for your 7 service. 8 if you agree that plaintiff has not satisfied 9 her burden of proof and answer question -- 10 either of -- if you answer either of those 11 questions yes -- well, actually, no. 12 if you answer question 2 yes -- if you 13 answer either of those questions yes, then 14 you will go on to consider the next group of 15 questions, which deal with what the plaintiff 16 wants you to focus on in this case, the side 17 story. 18 so let us discuss the side story so i can put 19 everything you heard from mr. gustafson in his 20 closing in perspective. 21 company statements. i told you in my 22 opening that the plaintiff would spend a great 23 deal of time talking about the statements made 24 by companies like philip morris, r.j. reynolds, 25 american tobacco company, brown & williamson 4040 1 tobacco company, lorillard tobacco company and 2 even a couple made by liggett. and just as i 3 told you they would, they pulled out the worst 4 sound bites from those documents that they could 5 find. 6 out of approximately 60 million pages of 7 documents, that is what dr. cummings told you, 60 8 million pages of documents, you will have, i do not 9 know, a stack about this high (indicating) back 10 in the jury room with you, maybe a couple 11 hundred thousand pages. 12 regardless, i'm not going to try and defend 13 the statements. frankly, i'm not in a position 14 to defend the statements of the other companies' 15 internal documents. liggett was not privy to 16 their internal documents and had no control over 17 what they were saying amongst themselves or how 18 they were running their companies and the things 19 that they said and expressed in those documents. 20 i mean, frankly, a lot of what they said and 21 expressed are things that we would not say or 22 even think today. but it was a different time. 23 interestingly, there really are not such 24 inflammatory statements made by liggett itself. 25 in order to find sound bites from liggett, they 4041 1 were compelled to go to liggett's annual reports 2 that were issued to shareholders regarding the 3 annual status of the company. really? i mean, 4 jayme westmoreland was not looking at liggett's 5 annual reports. she certainly was not getting 6 her health information from them. 7 now, you may remember that judge day already 8 instructed you on this. he told you, "ladies 9 and gentlemen, you will be shown documents and 10 statements that were created by tobacco 11 companies and entities other than defendant 12 liggett. it is for you to decide whether these 13 documents or these statements were made as a 14 part of the agreement between liggett and other 15 tobacco companies to conceal information 16 regarding the health risks of smoking and the 17 addiction -- addictiveness of tobacco. to the 18 extent you find they were not made as part of 19 such an agreement, you should not consider these 20 documents or statements against liggett." 21 annual reports and other internal documents 22 did not have anything to do with jayme 23 westmoreland. 24 in an attempt to make a connection, 25 plaintiff hired dr. hurt, a medical doctor, to 4042 1 come here and talk about advertising. he tried 2 to convince you that those ads meant something 3 to jayme westmoreland. he clearly has his own 4 agenda, again, going back to the instruction i 5 showed you in the beginning. that is one of 6 things you get to do; you get to evaluate when 7 weighing the weight to give the testimony of a 8 witness. 9 i mean, it was abundantly clear that he 10 does not like tobacco companies, and i get that. 11 i mean, really, he treats patients who get sick 12 on a daily basis, and it is got to be frustrating 13 for him to see people engaging in a behavior 14 that has a real chance of making you sick. but 15 this is an example of one of the things you get 16 to determine or you get to consider in 17 determining the weight to give his testimony. 18 does he have an agenda? absolutely. he would 19 love to see my client out of business. 20 dr. hurt showed us a large number of 21 advertisements from the past 70 years, and i'm 22 not going to spend much time talking about other 23 companies' ads because dr. cummings agreed that 24 liggett did not participate in the marketing of 25 its competitors' brands. liggett is not 4043 1 responsible for the content of other companies' 2 brands. 3 now, obviously, liggett brands did not 4 experience an increase in their market share 5 because the marlboro man was a hugely successful 6 ad campaign. in fact, we know liggett's ad 7 campaigns did not work as the years went by 8 because its market share continued to decline. 9 dr. cummings confirmed that by the 1990s 10 liggett's market share was about 2 percent. the 11 ads you saw attempted to portray specific 12 company brands as positively as possible so that 13 the different companies who were in pitched 14 competition with each other could gain market 15 share and sell their brands. there is nothing 16 illegal or improper about that. 17 it is not illegal to have attractive people 18 or glamorous people attempting to market your 19 products. all the companies do it. each one of 20 those ads you saw complied with ftc regulations, 21 and every one of them was legal. 22 what do those other company brands have to 23 do with liggett? for that matter, what do they 24 have to do with ms. westmoreland? and the 25 answer to both questions is, absolutely nothing. 4044 1 none of the ads that were shown to you during 2 plaintiff's case had anything to do with 3 ms. westmoreland or the facts of this case. 4 you may recall that in my opening i 5 acknowledged that in the past there was a lot of 6 cigarette advertising. i told you that you 7 might have to decide if cigarette advertising 8 had anything to do with why ms. westmoreland 9 continued to smoke. more to the point, was 10 there anything false in liggett's advertising 11 that mrs. westmoreland saw and relied on in 12 making her decisions to smoke? did liggett fail 13 to warn ms. westmoreland of anything that it had 14 a legal obligation to do? 15 ms. westmoreland evidently did have 16 conversations with her children regarding her 17 smoking over the years. but she never told them 18 or anyone else she was close to over the course 19 of her life that she started smoking because of 20 an advertisement or because of anything any 21 tobacco company said or did. not a single 22 witness ever said she told them she saw a 23 tobacco company statement, let alone that she 24 relied on it. but she did tell them that she 25 started smoking to fit in with the boys in 4045 1 neighborhood, her friends, who nicknamed her 2 moose, to be cool and to fit in. 3 both mrs. lambert and roxan confirmed that 4 mrs. westmoreland -- ms. westmoreland told them 5 this. that is why ms. westmoreland -- that is 6 ms. westmoreland's own explanation for why she 7 started smoking. 8 now, speaking of advertising that had 9 nothing to do with ms. westmoreland, you saw a 10 series of l&m ads in mr. gustafson's closing and 11 you saw a lot of lark ads. and plaintiff 12 emphasized ads for lark's gas-trap filter. 13 plaintiff claims ms. westmoreland somehow relied 14 on lark advertising and because of that 15 advertising somehow believes she was smoking a 16 safer -- not a safe, but a safer cigarette. 17 let us talk about the lark filter and what 18 liggett knew at the time. the lark cigarettes 19 that ms. westmoreland used were one of many 20 types of filtered cigarettes that were available 21 on the market beginning in the 1960s. 22 we heard testimony that in the 1960s 23 legitimate scientists outside of the tobacco 24 industry were advocating the use of filters to 25 reduce tar and nicotine in cigarettes and to 4046 1 attempt to selectively filter out carcinogens 2 and toxins in cigarette smoke. 3 dr. cummings testified about the national 4 cancer institute's tobacco working group in the 5 1960s. that was a coordinated joint effort by 6 public health scientists and industry scientists 7 to use filters and other cigarette design 8 modifications to try to come up with ways to 9 make cigarettes safer. that was all part of an 10 effort to reduce the risks of cigarettes and 11 create a less hazardous or potentially safer 12 cigarette. 13 despite these efforts by scientists for the 14 last 50 years, we know today that no one has 15 developed a way to make a safer cigarette, one 16 that removes the carcinogens and toxins in 17 cigarette smoke that cause lung cancer and other 18 diseases. 19 but in the 1960s liggett and 20 arthur d. little were trying in earnest to 21 identify what was potentially dangerous in 22 cigarette smoke and trying to figure out a way 23 to remove it. one of those efforts was the lark 24 charcoal filter. 25 we saw evidence that the 1964 surgeon 4047 1 general's advisory committee was very interested 2 in liggett's research concerning filters. we 3 saw dr. hamill, who worked for the advisory 4 committee, record in a 1962 memorandum that he 5 specifically asked dr. kensler, who was then 6 working with liggett, for the information they 7 had on the possibility of creating improved 8 filters. this is liggett's exhibit 44. 9 "the l&m chemists have done a great deal of 10 work on the effect of filtration. absolutely 11 sure they will make available all of their 12 information to us." 13 and then on page 2, "their two primary areas 14 of expertise," referring to liggett and arthur 15 d. little, are number one, "subjecting animals 16 and other biologic systems to exposures to 17 various kinds of smoke, and ciliary motility 18 studies in which kensler thinks they have 19 developed some unique methodology." 20 so as of 1962 surgeon general's committee 21 was aware that liggett was doing its own mouse 22 skin-painting studies and was saying that that is 23 one of liggett's areas of expertise. 24 liggett and dr. kensler responded to the 25 request from dr. hamill, and a fair amount of 4048 1 liggett's 1963 nine-volume submission discussed 2 the possibility of reducing the health risks of 3 cigarettes by the use of a special filter using 4 activated charcoal. 5 the charcoal was designed to remove certain 6 toxins that are found in the gas phase of the 7 cigarette smoke. 8 dr. kensler and liggett found an innovative 9 charcoal filter that was designed to reduce 10 cilia toxicity, which is damage to the little 11 pulsating hairs in the throat and lungs that 12 were caused by the cigarette smoke, and we did 13 this in opening to demonstrate the movement of 14 the cilia hairs to get the bad stuff out of the 15 lungs. 16 dr. kensler reported his research on the 17 charcoal filter to potentially reduce risks in 18 his landmark 1963 new england journal of 19 medicine paper that you heard about. and one 20 entire volume of liggett's submission to the 21 surgeon general was devoted to the possible 22 benefits of using an activated charcoal filter. 23 this is just the cover of one of the nine 24 volumes. "effects of gases and cigarette smoke 25 on mammalian ciliary activity." 4049 1 the surgeon general discussed in the 1964 2 report and cited dr. kensler's new england 3 journal of medicine article. and i think we 4 have a cull out on that. 5 "kensler and battista describe development 6 of a method of bioassay for inhibition of 7 ciliary transport activity involving exposure of 8 the trachea of a rabbit to the test material." 9 so this is just evidence that the research 10 that he was doing on the lark cigarette on the 11 charcoal filter was information they were 12 sharing with the surgeon general's committee. 13 the surgeon general actually went further 14 and specifically found that the activated 15 charcoal filter that was identified by 16 dr. kensler was promising and could potentially 17 reduce the harm arising from cigarettes. 18 "activated carbons differ markedly in their 19 absorption characteristics. carbon filters 20 previously employed in cigarettes do not have 21 the specific power to scrub the gas phase. it 22 has been reported that a filter containing 23 special carbon granules removes gaseous 24 constituents which depress ciliary activity." 25 that is liggett's research that we are talking 4050 1 about there. 2 dr. cummings and dr. hurt did not want to 3 tell you about dr. kensler's research and the 4 discussion of it in the 1964 report when they 5 criticized lark's charcoal filter and, 6 significantly, neither one of them could point 7 to any evidence by the surgeon general or any 8 scientist in any peer-reviewed journal over the 9 past 50 years that challenged dr. kensler's 10 research, his methodology or his conclusions 11 that were set forth in that important 1963 new 12 england journal of medicine article. 13 dr. cummings and dr. hurt knew about 14 dr. kensler and liggett's work on charcoal 15 filtration, but they ignored it and did not want 16 to talk about it. 17 mr. sales: your honor, may we approach, 18 please? 19 the court: you may. [#deleted sidebar#] [#deleted recess#] 3 ms. luther: thank you. if i had known you 4 needed a break, i would have drawn an objection 5 earlier. 6 the point of what i was talking about before 7 is not that the charcoal filter was successful, 8 but that it was a good-faith effort on liggett's 9 part to try and find something that was going to 10 reduce the risks of cigarette smoking. 11 now, going back to dr. cummings and 12 dr. hurt. dr. cummings and dr. hurt, on 13 cross-examination you may remember mr. feiwus 14 talked with them about a 2005 article that was 15 performed by scientists working for the united 16 states public health service. they were still 17 investigating in 2005 the potential use of 18 charcoal filters as a way to reduce lung cancer 19 risks. 20 this 2005 paper looked at the prevalent use 21 of charcoal filters in japan. you may recall 22 this. and they found that in japan where they 23 smoke a lot more charcoal-filtered cigarettes 24 than we smoke here, they have a much lower 25 incidence of lung cancer. so in 2005 they are 4069 1 still exploring the vitality of the 2 possibilities presented by the charcoal filter. 3 the bottom line with regard to the charcoal 4 filter is this: the lark charcoal filter, no 5 one can tell for sure whether it is any safer 6 than any other conventional cigarette, but what 7 we can say is that it was a good-faith effort by 8 liggett and dr. kensler in the early 1960s to 9 try to make the cigarette safer and to reduce 10 risk. 11 and, again, the bottom line is no one knows 12 where ms. westmoreland got her information that 13 lark cigarettes were safer than any other 14 cigarette on the market. 15 to put the lark story in context, let us go 16 back in time to when the debate began. what 17 does the evidence show about what liggett did 18 and what does the evidence show about what the 19 other major tobacco companies did? 20 did the -- the evidence showed that liggett 21 took a path independent from the rest of the 22 industry during critical parts of the story. we 23 saw evidence that beginning in the late 1940s 24 and culminating with the 1964 surgeon general's 25 report there was emerging scientific evidence 4070 1 concerning the lung cancer risks of smoke, 2 cigarette smoke. 3 the first widely publicized story was the 4 1950 statistical study of wynder and graham, 5 which was followed by a study by doll and hill 6 in 1952. and i've said all of this ad nauseam 7 probably, but the bottom line is that the 8 scientists that were performing those studies 9 back then agree that just because of their 10 isolated results that was not the end of the 11 story, that you had to do the studies again to 12 try and reproduce the results that they were 13 getting. 14 mr. gustafson even mentioned this. you have 15 to do correlation studies, you know, it is a 16 building upon a consensus. 17 so what did liggett do in response to this 18 information coming out? we hired arthur d. 19 little. well, let me back up. 20 liggett responded by investing enormous 21 amounts of money in research, biological testing 22 program with its preeminent consultant, arthur 23 d. little. it was -- arthur d. little was a 24 reputable scientific firm doing work for major 25 corporations in america at the time and 4071 1 united states government. 2 the man in charge of liggett's testing 3 program, dr. kensler, was a preeminent scientist 4 from sloan-kettering in new york with impeccable 5 credentials. and together liggett and arthur d. 6 little set out to do two things. first, to 7 coordinate with dr. wynder himself and to see if 8 the wynder mouse -- wynder-graham mouse 9 skin-painting -- try to say that five times 10 fast -- could be reproduced. the second, to see 11 if they could identify what, if anything, in the 12 cigarette smoke could be identified as the 13 problem. 14 we have talked about this. you want to -- you 15 have to identify what the problem is in order to 16 try and remove it. essentially if the 17 wynder-graham tests were reproduced, what in 18 cigarette smoke was responsible for those test 19 results? 20 now, the wynder graham mouse skin-painting 21 test was a landmark experiment. and when those 22 results were released, labs around the country, 23 not just liggett and arthur d. little, but 24 people at yale, people at sloan-kettering, the 25 cancer research institute and roswell park where 4072 1 dr. cummings started his career, they all began 2 to try to reproduce dr. wynder's studies. 3 wynder himself said reproducing his studies 4 was an important scientific endeavor. and he 5 himself participated with liggett and arthur d. 6 little and weighed in on the research that 7 liggett and arthur d. little were doing. 8 you saw the report by arthur d. little and 9 liggett concerning the results of their testing. 10 they were, in fact, able to replicate 11 dr. wynder's results, but in significantly lower 12 numbers than what wynder got. and they used 13 lower concentrations of tar or no tar at all. 14 you heard dr. kensler was reluctant to 15 publish those results because he did not want to 16 undermine the information that was already in 17 the public record about dr. wynder's test 18 results. 19 we know liggett continued in earnest with 20 its biologic testing throughout the 1950s. and 21 we know the researchers were able to identify 22 important carcinogens in cigarette smoke that 23 they believed were contributing to the 24 biological activity in wynder's tests and the 25 other tests. 4073 1 and at the appropriate time liggett made 2 that science publicly available by publishing 3 its results at the new york academy of science 4 in 1960, and even more significantly, providing, 5 voluntarily, all of its research, all of its 6 data to the surgeon general's advisory 7 committee. 8 plaintiff's experts tried to turn liggett's 9 positive efforts, its extensive research and 10 consultation with dr. wynder and its cooperation 11 with the surgeon general's committee on its 12 head. instead of congratulating liggett on 13 doing what no other tobacco company did, 14 plaintiff's experts criticized us because we 15 tried to do the right thing. 16 we did independent science on the important 17 issues at hand and made this research available 18 to the public health authorities. 19 even though dr. cummings has clearly not 20 read liggett's submission to the surgeon general 21 committee in its entirety, he was still willing 22 to come into this courtroom and testify under 23 oath that we did not tell them that smoking 24 causes cancer and we did not tell them that we 25 produced results similar to dr. wynder in our 4074 1 mouse skin-painting test and we did not tell them 2 that nicotine is important in why people smoke. 3 that is just flat-out wrong. you, again, 4 are going to have liggett's submission with you 5 back in the jury room. i just want to highlight 6 a few things that demonstrate just how wrong 7 dr. cummings is on this. 8 the members of the advisory committee 9 repeatedly praised liggett and arthur d. little 10 for both the quality of the work and the amount 11 of ground that was covered by their research. 12 in defendant's exhibit 46, this is -- these 13 are minutes from a 1963 meeting of the surgeon 14 general's committee. and you will see that 15 this -- the minutes reported, "these minutes can 16 not possibly record the massive amount of data 17 in these reports." then it goes on to say, "the 18 chairman thanked drs. kensler and hainer on 19 behalf of the committee for their comprehensive 20 and well-organized presentation, as well as for 21 the documents which had been prepared, and those 22 still to come." 23 then in defendant's exhibit 40, the 24 assistant surgeon general at the time wrote to 25 dr. kensler at arthur d. little. "we feel that 4075 1 simple acknowledgment of the receipt of the nine 2 volumes which you submitted to us is not 3 sufficient. please accept on behalf of 4 liggett & myers tobacco company and arthur d. 5 little our special gratitude for the tremendous 6 time, effort and expense in the production of 7 this material for our use." 8 then in defendant's exhibit 47, this is a 9 memo from the united states department of 10 agriculture, the chief of the tobacco laboratory 11 for the government said this about liggett's 12 submission. "the report contains a wealth of 13 information, especially with regard to the 14 biological responses of animal systems to 15 cigarette smoke." those are liggett's mouse 16 skin-painting studies. he goes on to report, 17 "in view of the voluminous amount of material 18 contained in the report, it would be impossible 19 to record here the many findings obtained in the 20 ten-year period of productive collaboration." 21 now, dr. cummings showed you a 1961 arthur 22 d. little document called "l&m: a prospective 23 review." and mr. gustafson talked about that in 24 his closing. that is plaintiff's exhibit 112. 25 and this is what the front of that document 4076 1 looks like. dr. cummings told you that liggett 2 did not share the information contained in this 3 introductory paragraph, that "there are 4 biologically active materials present in 5 cigarette tobacco. these are cancer causing, 6 cancer promoting, poisonous, stimulating 7 pleasurable and flavorful." 8 again, i urge you to look at liggett's 9 submission, because after you have done so i 10 submit you will conclude dr. cummings was not 11 sufficiently familiar with what liggett 12 submitted to the surgeon general to offer the 13 opinion that we did not tell them this in that 14 document. there is a tremendous amount of 15 information, 700 plus pages. 16 just to give you a flavor of what is in the 17 submission itself, we looked at the nicotine 18 excerpts. let us see what else liggett talked to 19 them -- or told them about. 20 in defendant's exhibit 42, if you look at 21 volume i on page 3, you will see that liggett 22 researchers concluded that there is never 23 less -- "nevertheless, we find enough of the 24 results relating cigarette smoking to death 25 rates to have been obtained in studies 4077 1 adequately meeting our standards for sound 2 inquiry and analysis to satisfy us with respect 3 to the overall conclusion that a gross 4 statistical association exists between cigarette 5 smoking and overall death rates." 6 and they go on to tell the committee that 7 that effect "increases with the degree of 8 smoking, and very probably with the number of 9 years smoked, the amount of each cigarette 10 smoked, the degree of inhalation and (inversely) 11 with the amount of filtration." 12 now, filters. liggett also told the surgeon 13 general's committee what it found with regard to 14 filters. this is defendant's exhibit 46. 15 liggett never said filters were safe. this is 16 what liggett told public health officials about 17 filters. 18 "condensate from filtered smoke" -- 19 condensate is the tar -- "from filtered smoke is 20 just as or almost as carcinogenic as that from 21 unfiltered smoke. filters can, however, reduce 22 the amount of condensate for cigarettes, meaning 23 lower the amount of tar that you are getting per 24 cigarette. additives have been found which 25 appear to reduce carcinogenicity of smoke, but 4078 1 none are yet practical." 2 so we are acknowledging that smoke was 3 carcinogenic. this is what liggett told the 4 surgeon general's committee about filters. 5 "but it was still thought that there could 6 be health benefits to removing as much of the 7 bad stuff as could be identified in cigarette 8 smoke as possible." 9 now, here is the table of contents of 10 volume iii of the submission. it lists 11 materials which have been suggested as possible 12 carcinogens for the human lung and it lists 13 these seven items: arsenicals, pesticides other 14 than arsenicals, beryllium, nickel, chromium, 15 free radicals, radioactivity. 16 and then contrary to what dr. cummings told 17 you, liggett did present the results of their 18 own mouse skin-painting studies showing that 19 they had produced carcinomas. that column all 20 the way on the left there shows cigarette -- 21 control cigarette produced nine carcinomas, 22 fifteen papillomas. you just go down the list 23 there. so we told them that we were getting 24 results from our mouse skin-painting studies. 25 i touched on nicotine earlier. i showed you 4079 1 what we told them about nicotine when i first 2 started and was talking about nicotine. but 3 clearly this information was not concealed by 4 liggett from the public health officials whose 5 job it is to protect health of the country. 6 even with this information, the public 7 health community did not find that nicotine was 8 addictive until they decided to eliminate the 9 requirement of intoxication so that they could 10 call cigarettes addictive. 11 so let us look at the l&m perspective again. 12 just based on this quick review of a few pages 13 out of a 700-volume submission, i have 14 demonstrated to you that liggett told the 15 surgeon general's committee that there are 16 biologically active materials present in 17 cigarette tobacco that are cancer causing, 18 cancer promoting, poisonous, stimulating, 19 pleasurable and flavorful and habit forming. 20 it is very easy for dr. cummings and hurt to 21 come in here 50 years later and apply 22 present-day scientific standards about what we 23 know about disease causation to liggett in the 24 1950s and '60s, but that is not a fair judgment 25 and it is not accurate. 4080 1 the scientists working for liggett did 2 exactly what legitimate scientists do. they 3 replicated an important experiment and then 4 built upon that research with new experiments, 5 testing new hypotheses, and then they shared 6 their data, the information they had regarding 7 their testing program, and they identify for the 8 public health authorities specific carcinogens. 9 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, they mention 10 that in the submission. benzo(a)pyrenes, they 11 mentioned that in the submission and a host of 12 others that they found in cigarette smoke. it is 13 all in the submission. 14 now, let us contrast liggett's responsible 15 conduct with its competitors, the other tobacco 16 companies in the 1950s. what did they do? 17 dr. hurt and dr. cummings testified to exactly 18 what these other companies did. they got 19 together at the plaza hotel in 1953. they hired 20 the pr firm hill & knowlton. they created an 21 organization called the tobacco industry 22 research committee, otherwise known as the 23 tobacco industry research committee, and they 24 did not conduct serious science. they engaged in 25 a campaign of disinformation. 4081 1 dr. hurt or dr. cummings, i confess i do not 2 remember which now, agreed that liggett did not 3 participate in any of those activities. and 4 dr. hurt said it was because liggett wanted to 5 avoid the controversy. and we also know this 6 because of the 1958 document that was authored 7 by tobacco company scientists from england that 8 mr. gustafson showed you. let us see what they 9 write about liggett. this is plaintiff's 10 exhibit 110. 11 "liggetts (sic) felt that the problem was 12 sufficiently serious to justify large-scale 13 investment by the company directly in 14 experimental research on smoke and cancer, 15 accepting privately that a strong case against 16 tobacco had been made out and avoiding any 17 public comment until their own research had 18 provided something concrete to offer." 19 "we were told that liggetts (sic) have 20 already invested considerably more in this work 21 than the combined donations of the rest of the 22 industry to tirc." 23 that is at page 5 of that document. unlike 24 these other companies, liggett engaged in 25 serious science, and it did not speak on 4082 1 issues until it had solid, concrete science to 2 offer. and when it did have those scientific 3 results, we know what it did. it published 4 those results to scientists, health officials 5 and the surgeon general. 6 so what would mr. gustafson have you 7 believe? he wants you to believe that all these 8 companies are the same. he wants you to buy 9 into guilt by association. just because liggett 10 was a tobacco company, it should be lumped in 11 with all these other tobacco companies; that 12 somehow, despite these facts, that its conduct 13 is indistinguishable from all these other 14 tobacco companies. 15 but you should not accept that. there is no 16 evidence of it. plaintiff's whole conspiracy 17 theory rests on liggett joining the tobacco 18 institute in 1958 and its extremely limited 19 membership in the council for tobacco research 20 from march of 1964 until january of 1968. 21 their claim is that because liggett was a 22 member of the industry lobbying group called the 23 tobacco institute it is now responsible for what 24 every other tobacco company did or said for a 25 50- to 60-year period of time. 4083 1 mr. sales: objection, your honor. contrary 2 to the engle findings and the court's 3 instructions. 4 the court: let us approach. [#deleted sidebar#] 14 ms. luther: so i was talking about the 15 tobacco institute. and you heard what 16 dr. cummings said about the tobacco institute. 17 he conceded that it had many members, not just 18 members of the tobacco manufacturing variety. 19 it included tobacco farmers, wholesalers, other 20 people involved in the industry. and he 21 conceded that those people were not part of the 22 conspiracy even though they were members of the 23 tobacco institute. 24 the evidence showed that liggett was a minor 25 player, at best, in terms of financial 4093 1 contributions to the tobacco institute and in 2 terms of governance and control. according to 3 dr. cummings, over a 40-year period of time 4 liggett only contributed $1.8 million, about 5 45,000 a year. that is .3 percent of the total 6 contributions by the rest of the industry. 7 plaintiff wants you to believe that every 8 letter, every comment, every statement made by 9 the tobacco institute or by philip morris, 10 r.j. reynolds, american tobacco company or the 11 other tobacco companies on smoking and tobacco 12 and health-related issues is somehow 13 attributable to liggett and somehow part of a 14 grand conspiracy. 15 mr. sales: objection, your honor. same 16 grounds just argued. 17 the court: hold that thought. 18 sustained. 19 ms. luther: ask yourself what documents or 20 letters did you see from liggett personnel 21 authorizing or directing tobacco institute 22 conduct or tobacco institute pr statements or 23 comments. none. all of the directions came 24 from the major companies, reynolds, brown & 25 williamson, philip morris. and, in fact, other 4094 1 than documents from the tobacco institute with 2 all these other competitor companies, what 3 public statements, if any, did you see from 4 liggett itself? 5 mr. sales: objection. page 5 of the 6 instructions. 7 the court: you are going to have to approach 8 on that one. [#deleted sidebar#] 13 ms. luther: anyways, now we were just 14 talking about the direction of the tobacco 15 institute and whether there was any documents or 16 anything along those lines showing that liggett 17 was controlling its actions. 18 this issue really bears on the issue of 19 punitive damages that i'm going to talk about at 20 the end. but it is relevant to the 21 reprehensibility conduct -- reprehensibility of 22 the conduct that mr. gustafson talked about. 23 and i will tie it all together when i get to 24 that section. okay? 25 so you saw a bunch of ads for l&m and you 4103 1 saw a bunch of ads for lark. and with regard to 2 the public statements you saw and with regard to 3 the advertisements, it is liggett's position that 4 they had no bearing whatsoever on 5 ms. westmoreland. 6 so when you go back to the jury room and 7 you are instructed on the law and you have to -- 8 actually, let us see. i lost my place in all 9 that time up in the sidebar, so let me see where 10 i am. 11 okay. so with respect to all of the 12 statements by the ti and the ctr and the other 13 companies that you have seen, liggett or anyone 14 else, did any of those statements play a role in 15 regard to ms. westmoreland's decisions to start 16 smoking, to continue smoking or to not quit 17 smoking? and there is not a stitch of evidence 18 that any of this made any difference to her at 19 all. 20 we know at every turn, every time she was 21 warned of the risks of smoking, she turned a 22 blind eye to it. when her brother told her she 23 should quit, she told him to talk about 24 something else or she ignored him. and we know 25 that from '66 on, there was 4104 1 congressionally-mandated warning on the 2 cigarette packs and from '72 the warnings were 3 on the ads. they made no difference to 4 ms. westmoreland. she smoked because she wanted 5 to smoke. smoking calmed her. 6 so the shortcut is no matter what you 7 determine about the conduct of philip morris or 8 reynolds or the ti or even liggett, did any 9 statement or advertisement or conduct whatsoever 10 by these companies have anything to do with her 11 smoking decisions? the overwhelming evidence is 12 that it did not. 13 even ms. lambert said that she did not know 14 what the companies could have done or said that 15 would have changed her mother's smoking 16 behavior. 17 she was asked, "and what specifically do you 18 think the companies should have said that you 19 have any reason to believe would have made a 20 difference in your mother's decisions as it 21 relates to her smoking cigarettes?" 22 and her response was, "i'm not sure." 23 this is their burden of proof, and they 24 have not met it. they have not proven with the 25 greater weight of the evidence, and this is 4105 1 reliance instruction, and this is what they have 2 to prove. so the issue -- i think i got it. 3 slide it over just a bit. 4 "the issue for your determination on 5 plaintiff's claim for concealment is whether the 6 concealment or omission of material information 7 regarding the health effects of cigarettes or 8 their addictive nature by liggett group was a 9 legal cause of ms. westmoreland's lung cancer 10 because ms. westmoreland reasonably relied to 11 her detriment that liggett group would not 12 conceal or omit disclosure of such material 13 information. material information is that 14 information which would have made a difference 15 to ms. westmoreland's actions had it been 16 disclosed." 17 and you are going to get a comparable 18 instruction with regard to the conspiracy 19 question. 20 now i'm going to talk briefly about the 21 information that was publicly available 22 concerning the health risks of smoking while 23 ms. westmoreland was alive. the evidence shows 24 that by the 1920s and '30s, the health risks of 25 cigarettes were widely known in the united 4106 1 states. people referred to cigarettes as 2 "coffin nails" because they associated 3 cigarettes with disease and death. and when i 4 say "coffin nails," i'm talking about the stuff 5 that you nail your coffin shut with as opposed 6 to a cough. 7 because of the widely perceived health risks 8 of cigarettes, many states, including florida, 9 banned the sale of cigarettes in the 1920s. 10 when that proved unworkable, the bans were 11 repealed, but cigarettes were still associated 12 with disease and death. 13 plaintiffs say that ms. westmoreland 14 could not have known the risks. with all of this 15 information out there, there is no way that it 16 was lost on her by the marketing advertising 17 campaigns of the major tobacco companies. ask 18 yourselves, is this really a credible argument? 19 does this make any sense? 20 so let us go back to the verdict form 21 questions. we have already talked about questions 22 one and two that i submit would be 23 appropriately -- appropriately answered with 24 nos. 25 the third question that you are going to be 4107 1 asked to answer is, "please state the percentage 2 of any responsibility which was a legal cause of 3 jayme westmoreland's lung cancer and death that 4 you charge to: liggett group and jayme 5 westmoreland." 6 and i previewed for you in jury selection 7 that if you get this far, i'm asking that you 8 write "one hundred percent" on the line for 9 jayme westmoreland. 10 and then it goes on to question 4. if you 11 do not agree with me, you will answer questions 4 12 and 5, "was the concealment or omission by 13 liggett group of material information concerning 14 the health effects or addictive nature of 15 cigarettes, or both, a legal cause of 16 jayme westmoreland's lung cancer and death?" 17 no. 18 "did the agreement of liggett group with the 19 other companies and entities to conceal or omit 20 material information concerning the health 21 effects or addictive nature of cigarettes, or 22 both, a legal cause of jayme westmoreland's lung 23 cancer and death?" 24 and, again, we submit you should respond 25 "no" to that question. 4108 1 now, one of the last things i want to talk 2 to you about are punitive damages. and what 3 you are being asked to decide today is whether or 4 not punitive damages should be awarded in this 5 case. you are not deciding the amount at this 6 point in time. 7 if you say, yes, that punitive damages 8 should be awarded, there will be another phase 9 of the trial. there will be additional 10 witnesses and evidence presented to you, and 11 you will have a second round of deliberations in 12 which you determine what an appropriate amount 13 of punitive damages should be. 14 but what you need to understand is any 15 punitive damages that would be awarded would go 16 to ms. lambert and mr. westmoreland, and only 17 mrs. lambert and mr. westmoreland. and the 18 purpose of punitive damages is to punish and 19 deter. 20 if you decide they are entitled to money to 21 compensate them for their mother's death, you 22 compensate them fully for their mother's death 23 through the award of compensatory damages. 24 punitive damages are additional money awarded to 25 them above and beyond any compensatory damages 4109 1 you might award. 2 the judge has instructed you on the standard 3 for awarding punitive damages. as i just 4 mentioned, they are intended to punish liggett 5 for its allegedly wrongful conduct, and they 6 must be based on liggett's conduct by itself, 7 not the conduct of any other tobacco company or 8 entity. the burden is on plaintiff to prove by 9 clear and convincing evidence, not by the 10 greater weight, but clear and convincing 11 evidence that she is entitled to an award of 12 punitive damages. 13 i submit that there is no basis for punitive 14 damages here. and we do not believe you should 15 reach this issue. but if you do, you should 16 know that the clear and convincing standard is a 17 much higher standard than the one used for you 18 to find in plaintiff's favor on the rest of her 19 claims. 20 clear and convincing evidence is evidence 21 that is precise, explicit, lacking in confusion 22 and of such weight that it produces a firm 23 belief or conviction without hesitation as to 24 the matter in issue. 25 here, whether there is any such evidence that 4110 1 liggett's wrongful conduct caused damage to 2 ms. westmoreland and whether it is necessary to 3 send a message to liggett to punish liggett for 4 the way it is currently doing business. 5 cigarettes are a legal product in this 6 country. and you have seen from the documents in 7 evidence that back in the day, liggett acted the 8 way a responsible cigarette manufacturer should 9 have acted. it conducted independent research 10 to corroborate the results of dr. wynder's mouse 11 skin-painting studies. it turned over almost a 12 decade's worth of research to the surgeon 13 general's committee, and the information 14 provided to the surgeon general's committee was 15 instrumental in allowing the surgeon general to 16 conclude in 1964 that smoking was a cause of 17 lung cancer in men. and even after the warnings 18 went on the packs, liggett continued to do 19 research and development and try to make its 20 products safer for smokers. 21 liggett today is the smallest of the major 22 tobacco companies. it has approximately 23 two percent of the market. dr. cummings told 24 you that. back in 1996, it was the first 25 tobacco company to publicly admit that smoking 4111 1 causes certain diseases and is addictive. 2 and you heard that congress mandates what 3 the warnings should be on cigarette packs. 4 well, liggett puts a voluntary warning on its 5 pack that is not required by congress, and you 6 heard testimony about that. liggett today puts 7 a warning on its packs of cigarettes that 8 smoking is addictive. 9 liggett is doing business as a responsible 10 tobacco manufacturer. more importantly, and not 11 to beat a dead horse, but liggett's conduct over 12 the years had no bearing on ms. westmoreland. 13 liggett does not deserve to be punished. in a 14 case in which mrs. lambert admits her mother 15 could have tried harder to quit, and her own 16 decisions and actions were a legal cause of her 17 lung cancer, there should be no question that 18 punitive damages are inappropriate. and you 19 should answer no to question 8 if you get there. 20 question 8 says: "please state whether you 21 find by clear and convincing evidence that 22 punitive damages are warranted against liggett 23 group, llc under the circumstances of this 24 case." 25 like i said, if you get there, we would 4112 1 request that you answer no. 2 so i sit down now, and mr. sales is going to 3 get up. and he has rebuttal because, again, 4 they have the burden of proof in the case. i 5 want you to remember some key points that tell 6 you everything you really need to know to decide 7 the issues in this case. 8 you all know that we enjoy a tremendous 9 amount of freedom in this country. we have the 10 right to make decisions and lifestyle choices 11 that are not always in our best interests. but 12 with that freedom comes the obligation to accept 13 personal responsibility for the consequences, 14 and in the end, that is what this case is really 15 about. 16 are we going to hold liggett liable, legally 17 responsible for the informed decisions of a 18 strong and independent woman who lived her life 19 the way she wanted to live it based on the 20 evidence that you have heard? i think the answer 21 is clear. 22 mr. sales is going to have an opportunity to 23 get up and have the last word. i do not know 24 what he is going to say. but when you listen to 25 him, ask yourself the following: what does 4113 1 this have to do with ms. westmoreland? what 2 does this have to do with the story of 3 ms. westmoreland? what does this have to do 4 with the story you have heard over the course of 5 the last two and a half weeks about 6 ms. westmoreland? 7 the evidence supports one and only one 8 verdict, and that is a verdict for liggett. 9 i want to thank you again for your 10 attention. it took a little longer than i 11 thought it was going to. 12 we really appreciate the patience that 13 you have shown throughout the course of this 14 trial. and on behalf of liggett and the rest of 15 my team, thank you very much. 16 the court: counsel.
