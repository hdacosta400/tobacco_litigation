9 mr. sales: thank you, your honor. 10 members of the jury, good afternoon. i'm 11 probably short on time, and so my thanks are 12 going to be short as well because the clock is 13 ticking. it is almost the end of the day. it is 14 almost time for you all to do what is the most 15 important responsibility that the jurors or 16 anyone in this courtroom have in the end. but 17 on behalf of my clients and our clients and our 18 group, and i know i speak for defense counsel as 19 well, the court, the bailiff, our wonderful 20 clerk and court reporter, everybody is very 21 grateful for all the reasons that have been 22 pointed out. i want to begin by starting and 23 saying that i'd like to just focus for a moment 24 on things that counsel for liggett began within 25 and ended with in her closing argument and state 4119 1 areas of agreement about the case and areas 2 about which we disagree and disagree very much. 3 because counsel told you in closing argument 4 that this is not about the public. it is about 5 one smoker and only one smoker. and it is not 6 about the other companies. 7 and we disagree with that, and we disagree 8 with that for reasons that you have already heard 9 because i want to begin where counsel ended. 10 and at the end of your deliberations and as you 11 reach the questions on the verdict form, we ask 12 and we hope that you will be answering the 13 question of punitive damages. 14 and i want to talk a little bit about what 15 those standards are, because counsel has 16 suggested to you that this case and your work, 17 your important work from this point forward has 18 nothing to do with everybody else. and it very 19 much does so, because punitive damages are 20 warranted if you find by clear and convincing 21 evidence that standard that was just addressed 22 by defense counsel, among other things, if there 23 was a reckless disregard for human life for the 24 safety of a person exposed to the effects of the 25 conduct of the party sitting in liggett's 4120 1 position. and also -- also this is the court's 2 instruction, you are going to have this in the 3 jury room -- if they wantonly and recklessly 4 disregarded the safety and welfare of public. 5 we have got plenty of evidence of that in this 6 case, some of which i'm going to review with 7 you. and if they show the reckless indifference 8 to the rights of others. 9 and what you have just heard is that liggett 10 expects when you get to this point in your 11 deliberations that they should be exonerated 12 because they were a two-percent player, at least 13 that is what they tell us currently, current 14 times, in a conspiracy that you have heard has 15 resulted in the loss of life as a result of 16 persons exposed to the conduct of this defendant 17 and its co-conspirators, 20 million people. 18 the other instruction you have from the 19 court, while you cannot consider similar harms 20 suffered by those 20 million in awarding amounts 21 of punitive damages, you can accept in assessing 22 the reprehensibility or wrongness of liggett 23 group's conduct in this case. 24 so we disagree, because that is exactly what 25 the instructions tell us that on those 4121 1 questions, those end-of-the-case questions, 2 end-of-the-deliberations questions that this 3 case is very much about that. 4 and we also disagree that it is not about the 5 other companies, because the parties have 6 referred to and the court has referred in its 7 instructions to the issue of the conspiracy. 8 this is part of the law that is to guide you in 9 your deliberations. and what do we learn from 10 it? "each party," that would include this 11 party, "to a conspiracy is responsible for the 12 acts or omissions of any other party to the 13 conspiracy so long as the acts or omissions were 14 in furtherance of the conspiracy. accordingly, 15 liggett group is responsible for its own acts 16 and for the acts of the other companies, 17 organizations taken in furtherance of the 18 conspiracy." 19 and it lists them. american tobacco, that is 20 who got it going. that is the guy who was quoted 21 in the canasta pajamas article, denying what is 22 in there. brown & williamson, those are the 23 folks that did not tell anybody that filters 24 do not do any good. lorillard tobacco company, 25 they are the company, among other things, that 4122 1 were trying to juice the cigarettes up with 2 ammoniation, among others. philip morris, 3 they are the ones that were telling themselves 4 that they just had to get the rat to push the 5 lever again. and then we have the more frequent 6 appears, reynolds, tobacco institute, you have 7 heard a lot about them, and the ctr. 8 and liggett wants a pass and wants to 9 suggest to you that they should be exonerated 10 for all of the things that those parties 11 concealed as part of this conspiracy. and there 12 is not any question about what the conspiracy was 13 about, because, again, we have the engle 14 findings, which are the law that guides you in 15 the case and tells you what it is that you are 16 to be thinking about, at least with respect to 17 the law. 18 and i've drawn these kind of goofy arrows on 19 there because i want to acknowledge that we 20 understand all of this, and you have heard this 21 repeatedly that the findings do not apply unless, 22 and that is where the "if" comes in, that you 23 find that ms. westmoreland was an engle class 24 member. 25 but if that is the case, then the evidence is 4123 1 overwhelming in that regard. they have not 2 really touched that. more on that in a moment, 3 perhaps, if we have time. 4 the cigarettes that she smoked, and that is 5 every one of these, if you find that she was an 6 engle class member, they were -- these are the 7 court's words, "defective and unreasonably 8 dangerous." that is important for a whole host 9 of reasons, not the least of which is when you 10 go to assess the reasonableness of 11 ms. westmoreland's conduct, we are assessing the 12 reasonableness or unreasonableness of her 13 conduct consuming products that as a matter of 14 law in this case, if you find that she was an 15 engle class member, were unreasonably dangerous 16 and defective. or is it defective and 17 unreasonably dangerous? 18 and then there is the other law. and the 19 other law, again, tells us that these other 20 defendants, they matter if the things that were 21 being done during the period of time of this 22 lady's life were things, i would submit to you, 23 that mattered to her or would have mattered to 24 her. and did not she have the right to know? 25 did not she have the right to know some of these 4124 1 things you have heard about in this court? 2 because, yes, while they were competing -- 3 and i'll get to that in a few moments -- stories 4 about does it cause cancer, does it not cause 5 cancer and much, much later, the fight about the 6 addictiveness of nicotine contained in 7 cigarettes, there was no -- there was no 8 expression publicly of the things that you have 9 learned that you know that the defendants kept 10 secret, the defendant here, i should say, and 11 its co-conspirators. some of these apply to 12 liggett. some of them do apply to other -- 13 ms. luther: objection, your honor. 14 the court: approach. 15 sidebar conference: 16 17 court outside the presence of the jury:) 18 the court: your objection is to the -- 19 ms. luther: demonstrative. the very first 20 one says "targeting you," which is talking to 21 the jury, so he is implying we are targeting the 22 jury. 23 the court: might be a clerical mistake. 24 end of sidebar conference 25 www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408 1 court and jury:) 2 mr. sales: yes. my bad. i'm sorry. i 3 changed it to -- 4 the court: clerical mistake corrected. 5 ms. luther: okay. "youth." 6 mr. sales: my brain works faster than my 7 scribble. can you put that back up there? 8 there is no evidence in this case that, as 9 you know from documents from liggett and from 10 r.j. reynolds -- 11 ms. luther: objection, your honor. 12 mr. sales: oh, sorry. 13 ms. luther: your honor, i object to this 14 demonstrative in its entirety, the use of the 15 word -- 16 the court: come on up. 17 sidebar conference: 18 19 court outside the presence of the jury:) 20 the court: i'm inclined to agree. 21 mr. sales: i'll take it off and just argue. 22 the court: argue your points. you want a 23 chalkboard? 24 mr. sales: no. i'll just write it. 25 end of sidebar conference 4126 1 2 court and jury:) 3 the court: we are going to go ahead without 4 that demonstrative. 5 mr. sales: i'm sorry. 6 -- that youth was targeted. we know that 7 from r.j. reynolds documents. we know that from 8 liggett's documents. there is never been any 9 evidence in this case that that was disclosed to 10 the public. 11 would that make a difference to smokers in 12 this country? that there was an express 13 interest and desire to addict young people and 14 an understanding that you needed to get them 15 while they are young and get them to commit is 16 exactly what happened in this case to a 17 particular brand, because that is the key to 18 success in this industry. the industry knew 19 these things would happen; that is to say that 20 people would become addicted. 21 there is never been any indication that in 22 her entire period, the entire period of 23 ms. westmoreland's life that she had an 24 understanding of these matters, that they knew 25 that she was at risk for cancer and death, that 4127 1 they knew that filters do not work, that they 2 knew that lights were no safer, that they knew 3 that they were trying to increase the effects of 4 nicotine. 5 and they come in and they tell you that that 6 would make no difference to someone who has 7 spent decades smoking and a portion of that 8 period of time, the end of her life, trying to 9 quit smoking. and that they knew that these 10 products were unreasonably dangerous, and they 11 knew also, as you see very clearly the document 12 from the tobacco institute in 1968, that they 13 were lying to the public about these other 14 matters because they were trying to sell 15 cigarettes. 16 and, yes, you know, it is true that there are 17 separate claims for liggett and the conspiracy. 18 and counsel has addressed some of these issues 19 with respect to the history of liggett. and at 20 the end of some of this discussion, it was 21 indicated that liggett, according to counsel, 22 should be congratulated for its work. 23 let us just take a little trip down history 24 lane, the history of liggett, some of which 25 you have seen in this case. and these were not 4128 1 documents that were cherry-picked among the 2 millions. they are the ones that matter that we 3 are aware of in this case. and we know in 1956 4 that the mouse-painting studies that they did 5 were finished. did they tell the public that 6 they had replicated that work? no, they did not. 7 and that is what dr. cummings said. 8 in 1963 when they were communicating with 9 the surgeon general about those matters, they 10 did identify that they had replicated work that 11 was already in the public to some extent. but 12 what dr. cummings was telling you and what the 13 undisputed evidence is, is that they never 14 acknowledged that cigarettes caused cancer in 15 people, real people. not that they depress 16 ciliary activity, which they demonstrated 17 through one of their contractors or scientists 18 with dead animals. there is no chance that if 19 you are experimenting by design on dead animals 20 that you are ever going to be able to show that 21 cigarettes cause cancer. 22 and did they persuade people that they 23 should be congratulated for those things? well, 24 i suppose they did. and you ask yourself 25 whether or not there was an honest communication 4129 1 of these things. because counsel showed the 2 part of the trip report that is favorable to 3 them. 4 but the part that is favorable to the 5 plaintiff -- and there are two sides to that 6 trip report -- is that when the tobacco 7 brothers, as mr. bass called them with dr. hurt, 8 came and reviewed these matters here in the 9 united states, with everybody in the country who 10 had a stake in it except one outlier scientist 11 at yale university, liggett and everybody else 12 said the same thing: cigarettes cause cancer in 13 people. we know from their witness yesterday 14 that they did not tell anybody that until 1997. 15 now, let us just turn the clock back for a 16 moment. we are going to turn the clock back to 17 1964, that giant story that mr. gustafson was 18 talking about. and imagine, if you will, 19 because he talked about addiction, if in 20 addition to luther terry standing there buttoned 21 up reading his report in front of all those 22 reporters who were locked in a room so that they 23 could read it before he spoke, imagine if as 24 part of that presentation this defendant or any 25 of the other manufacturers, because you have seen 4130 1 that they all knew it, had come out and said, 2 yes, we cry uncle; we have been lying to you for 3 ten years; we are sorry; cigarettes cause 4 cancer. would that have made any difference? 5 would that have been front page news? we submit 6 to you that it would have been and that it would 7 have mattered to people, especially people who 8 were just taking up what they used to call the 9 "habit of smoking." 10 let us take a little bit more of a trip down 11 memory lane here. in 1960, one of the documents 12 we are accused of cherry-picking, they 13 acknowledge -- mr. gustafson showed it to you -- 14 that cigarettes cause cancer. 15 and counsel has suggested to you -- you have 16 it in evidence -- that that 1961 l&m perspective 17 is just saying the same thing as they put in 18 their submission to the surgeon general in 1963. 19 well, you can judge for yourself. but what it 20 is is an acknowledgment, the same acknowledgment 21 in 1958, at least from the perspective of the 22 plaintiff, that cigarettes cause cancer in 23 people. that is what we are talking about. 24 and were they straight? were they square, 25 really truly square with the surgeon general on 4131 1 that? you have seen a few documents in this case 2 that you know they talk about things that they 3 were deciding whether to reveal to the surgeon 4 general or not, and they decided -- we are going 5 to talk about one of those in a moment -- to 6 hide them. 7 you may remember this. this is put in 8 evidence by liggett. it is exhibit 246 in 9 evidence. it has this heading on it. it comes 10 from the department of agriculture. and it 11 talks in the beginning of it about a visit that 12 those folks in washington had when they met with 13 the a.d. little people, kind of curiously, in 14 1963. 15 and they are reporting three years later, 16 upper left-hand corner, about the visit that 17 they had with liggett's contractor. and this is 18 part of the mix that was going on at the time in 19 1963, the things that were being told to the 20 government. 21 and when mr. feiwus cross-examined 22 dr. cummings on this document, he showed him -- 23 and you might remember it was one of those 24 bullets that are in these slides, these 25 powerpoint things that we use. and he showed 4132 1 him number four. he showed him number four 2 about they acknowledge that there is cyanide, 3 some of these other things. 4 but what you did not see, and this is now in 5 evidence, was what liggett, through its 6 contractor, the same contractor that they are 7 asking you that they should be congratulated 8 for, the work of a.d. little, what do they say? 9 "no direct chemical or biological data have been 10 developed to support the epidemiological 11 evidence indicating an association between 12 cigarette smoking and lung cancer." that was a 13 lie. they lied to the government straight out. 14 and you look through that nine-volume thing 15 that they are bragging about in this case. if 16 you ask yourself if you see anywhere, just like 17 dr. cummings said, that they say that cigarettes 18 cause lung cancer, that would have been big 19 news. they did not do that. we all can agree 20 this has sort of a mind of its own. 21 and so that is what happened, and that is in 22 the middle there in 1963. and counsel also told 23 you, you know, in an effort to persuade you that 24 we just browsed through these 60 million pages 25 and try to make them look bad, that those are 4133 1 their own words, words of government officials. 2 we did not write those. 3 we certainly did not write this either, 4 because ms. luther told you that there ain't a 5 bad document about liggett in the bunch. and 6 what do you know? you know that in 1963 in a 7 document which they say they are going to 8 withhold from the surgeon general, liggett's 9 contractor, again, a.d. little, undertook to 10 estimate how many people were going to die, how 11 many people were going to die from these 12 products who were age 20 and above at that time. 13 that is their work. and they withheld that from 14 the surgeon general. 15 and you ask yourself, is this the kind of 16 cold, calculated, really bad stuff that the 17 plaintiff's just cherry-picking out of thin air, 18 other companies, to make this defendant look 19 bad? well, no, because they estimated, without 20 any help 50 years ago from anybody in this 21 courtroom, and compared the consequences of 22 these products, these unreasonably dangerous and 23 defective products to car wrecks. and they were 24 talking about men because the data for men was 25 more available then. and it was by a factor of 4134 1 almost ten that they knew at the time, while 2 withholding what they knew about cigarettes 3 causing cancer is that they were going to 4 contribute, does not matter if it is two percent 5 of the industry or ten percent or a hundred 6 percent, that is how many people were going to 7 die. 8 and that information just never managed to 9 escape from liggett's files until 1997. not 10 this document, just that cigarettes cause 11 cancer. that would have been big news, really 12 big. that would have opened the eyes of a lot 13 of people in this country. 14 and one thing that is incredibly interesting, 15 two things about this document, is that while 16 they want to say that -- lost my place -- while 17 they want to say that they were forthright about 18 these matters, remember one of those scientists, 19 hammond, they were relying on the same 20 epidemiological data. and by this time, they 21 joined the tobacco institute. drumbeat after 22 drumbeat, statistics do not matter, it is nothing, 23 they do not prove. they are using epidemiologic 24 data, the same kind of data that estimates how 25 many people are going to be ill that they and 4135 1 their co-conspirators challenged for 40 years 2 after this, 30 years after this and then some, 3 to calculate it. 4 and how cold and calculating is it? just 5 shows, i guess, the lack of math awareness. you 6 can look at the back of this document, it is in 7 evidence, and there is a formula. that is what 8 they did. that is what they did. and that is one 9 of the documents that the plaintiff, according 10 to counsel and liggett, cherry-picked from all 11 the other available evidence. and this is a 12 quote. they provided all of this, their 13 research. they did not provide this. that would 14 have been big news. and they tell you when they 15 come in here that they should be congratulated, 16 congratulated for comparing this product and its 17 lethal and deadly consequences to car wrecks, 18 unexpected loss of life in the middle of the 19 night, crash, boom, dead, that is their 20 comparison. and somebody needs to say something 21 about that. 22 let us talk a little bit about public 23 awareness and what people know and do not know, 24 because, you know, there is an old saying about 25 trees falling in a forest, and if nobody is 4136 1 there to hear it, they do not really fall. and 2 the reason that saying has staying power is 3 because we all know that is not true. it is a 4 reflection, in part, on the way people think 5 about things and what they know and they do not 6 know. 7 and what you know, because you have seen it -- 8 by the way, this is dr. dibacco. there was not 9 any scientific controversy about any of these 10 matters. his review of history is just wrong. 11 one of the reasons his view of history is just 12 wrong is his view is just, poof, any time these 13 people, the tobacco institute or their 14 co-conspirators did anything, this is what the 15 public was doing. and the $250 billion that 16 these very sophisticated companies spent -- 17 ms. luther: objection, your honor. 18 mr. sales: in evidence. 19 the court: approach. 20 sidebar conference: 21 22 court outside the presence of the jury:) 23 ms. luther: i think that was just a 24 knee-jerk reaction to hearing a large number. i 25 think mr. sales is going to say that was spent 4137 1 on marketing. and i agree it is in evidence. 2 the court: you withdraw your objection? 3 ms. luther: i do. 4 the court: do you want me to cover you 5 somehow? 6 ms. luther: no, i'm fine. 7 the court: tell him you are sorry. 8 actually, you owed him that and more. 9 mr. sales: no, we are all good. 10 end of sidebar conference 11 12 court and jury:) 13 mr. sales: very sorry about that. 14 the $250 billion that they spent on 15 advertising, they were doing it because it 16 does not -- they were rubes and nitwits who just 17 throw that kind of money around. because what? 18 because, according to the last witness that you 19 heard, when they are clearly, clearly trying to 20 tell people that they are doing something to help 21 them, to save them, to make it better for them, 22 safer, just, you know, make us feel with that 23 filter we are doing okay, that that -- no, this 24 is really about taste, do not you see? 25 and that is what happens when you put 4138 1 blinders on in a case like this, you only look 2 at one side of the picture, and you do not look 3 at the company documents where the company 4 spent, one assumes, because we know from 5 ms. luther just recently that they spent a lot 6 of money on research, well, they spent a lot of 7 money on advertising, too, and we know that they 8 tested these things to find out how people would 9 react. 10 and you saw from the documents reviewed by 11 mr. gustafson that people look at that and look 12 at their ads and say, hey, that looks like there 13 may be one of those cancerless cigarettes or 14 safer cigarettes out there. they paid money to 15 find out if people would react that way. and 16 you saw the review of it from a related document 17 from their lawyers. there was not any mystery 18 about that. 19 and nobody ever came out and said, hey, you 20 know, we are trying to tell you that it is safer. 21 we know it is not. we know it is really 22 addictive. 23 and the picture that we have on here on the 24 nicotine filter, filter, it is like being in 25 space where we get pure air to breathe, one of 4139 1 those ads. it is like being in a submarine, all 2 these super-clean, clear places that you will be 3 protected. 4 why do we show you the ads of the other 5 companies? we do not show them to suggest to you 6 that x bought cigarette brand a because they saw 7 the ads of cigarette brand b. that is not the 8 point. the point is that we lived in a time 9 where people responded to these kinds of 10 products that way. and there is not any doubt 11 about it. there is not any doubt that that was 12 the purpose of these ads, to suggest to people 13 in the face of lots of information on both sides 14 a controversy, they call it, right. there is not 15 any question that that had to do with trying to 16 help people believe that they did not have to 17 worry so much. that is what filters were all 18 about. 19 and we know from the documents of the 20 conspirators, many of them, that that is exactly 21 what the purpose of all these messages were. 22 and would not it have been useful for 23 jayme westmoreland to know that when you are 24 dissecting a filter and responding to ads and 25 telling your son that you are proud because 4140 1 you are switching to light cigarettes that it was 2 all, poof, nothing but lies? 3 so it is just, you know, the very unusual 4 situation. and one has to appreciate the 5 difficult position that some of us are in in 6 this case to be saying, yes, it is true we said 7 these things for 40 or 50 years, but you knew 8 all about it. when i say "you," i mean 9 ms. westmoreland knew all about it. but even if 10 you did not, we were justified in saying the 11 things that we said. 12 is that really the evidence in this case? 13 and, you know, one of the reasons that we go 14 through these things or we talked about these 15 things, these are in evidence, showing that, you 16 know, philip morris and other defendants are 17 speaking publicly. they are arguing in the new 18 york times. that we showed these things not 19 just to show that dr. dibacco is way biased, and 20 not much more needs to be said about that, but 21 that the controversy that they invested so much 22 money in spending, by estimates, 365 times on 23 their messages what the government had available 24 to spend on the same thing, that that was not 25 trivial. 4141 1 i mean, they have newsweek articles in 2 there. you saw this. there is a newsweek 3 article, the head of the tirc, he got equal 4 time. we showed these things. time magazine in 5 the '70s over and over and over again. and what 6 do we know? for reasons that may seem 7 mysterious, the lawyers and the witnesses are 8 talking about things that happened in new york 9 city. well, you heard that these things 10 actually made their way elsewhere. 11 and what do we have? these are in evidence. 12 i'm not going to go over them, but you will have 13 them available. we have the asbury park evening 14 press. that is in evidence. that is near where 15 she lived. they are picking up those stories. 16 they got the messages from bowman gray. we are 17 in the '60s now. they have got the messages in 18 there. bowman gray was the president of 19 r.j. reynolds. they got equal time. they got 20 equal time where she lived. there is a few of 21 them. and you can take a look at those if that 22 is a matter of interest to you, all right. 23 it was just a theory cigarettes cause 24 cancer. and then, you know, we have one from 25 greenville, south carolina where she lived in 4142 1 the '70s. it was not buried in there, right. 2 right here. horace kornegay. you have heard his 3 name. he got equal time in the '70s. 4 and the suggestion is, you know, that that 5 tree just was not falling in the forest where 6 this unfortunate lady lived. and you know 7 that is not so. you know that is not so. 8 you know, sometimes things they just do not 9 happen by accident. here's an article. she is 10 living in st. petersburg by this time in the 11 early '90s. in 1991. and there is a blast from 12 the past and a blast from the present. lo and 13 behold, michael cummings, a witness in this 14 case, is correlinked with walter merriman, one 15 of those tobacco institute people, in the 16 st. petersburg times in the '90s here, '91, 17 about the controversy. and merriman says 18 researchers do not know whether smoking causes 19 disease. and it does not make a particle of 20 difference. nice choice of words. 21 what the views of our council for tobacco 22 research grantees may be -- they are talking 23 about whether the industry is paying for good or 24 bad science -- we are interested in the quality 25 of their research, not what their personal views 4143 1 are. 2 but the point is the same. well into the 3 '90s -- and it is hard for us to think about 4 those things. and i want to agree with 5 dr. dibacco about one think. think about what 6 was happening then and not what is happening now. 7 no internet, right. so how did they do it? 8 well, you have seen enough, we submit, to see that 9 this is just a portion of it. the press 10 releases from the tobacco institute, the '50s, 11 the '60s, the '70s, you have seen how these things 12 got picked up. and the drumbeat and the message 13 that cigarettes do not cause cancer, they do not 14 cause heart disease, attacking the surgeon 15 general. and there is some from some other 16 companies in there. 17 it is in fair -- baron, is that pt5504? i 18 think it is probably about 200 pages. just take 19 a look. it is another trip through history. and 20 the industry wants to tell you that nobody heard 21 those things. you know because you have seen the 22 way that they were picked up over time. you 23 know that, in fact, they got their equal time. 24 and the suggestion that their power waned in 25 the midst of spending in the second half of 4144 1 20th century, $250 billion on advertising, and 2 these massive grants and bribing the ama and all 3 those kind, did that just, it just did not work 4 on anybody. and you know those things made a 5 difference. 6 let us talk a little bit about doctors, 7 because -- how did they do it? it is 8 diabolical. it is one of the reasons punitive 9 damages are warranted in this case even for the 10 two-percent contributor, because there is not any 11 question that in 1968, 1958 forward that liggett 12 was part of the conspiracy. there is not any 13 question about it. and they are in for a pound 14 because that is the way the law of conspiracy 15 operates. it recognizes that there is a 16 particular danger associated with wrongdoing 17 when people get together and act as one. 18 and it may be true that when marlboro 19 started to take a little bit of everybody's 20 market share, they said we should use calcium 21 hydroxide, we are going to use ammonium and we are 22 going to use diammonium phosphate, and we are 23 just going to add free nicotine. you can plug 24 the names in. liggett, lorillard -- it is true 25 they have their own ideas about that. but 4145 1 point is for us and for the deceased, 2 jayme westmoreland, is they never told anybody 3 those things. and it made a difference. 4 how did they do it? we talked a little bit 5 about the doctors. i mean, this is in evidence. 6 i'm just going to review a little bit with you. 7 this is their tobacco and health research notes. 8 they are talking in here about that this is their 9 communications with the medical profession. 10 they sent these to every doctor in the country. 11 and they would collect often their own bogus 12 science in reported form about what was going 13 on. 14 remember that constitutional hypothesis and 15 the multifactorial hypothesis? anytime anybody 16 anywhere in the world said it is air pollution, 17 it is virus, it is this, it is that, it sure ain't 18 cigarettes, they put that prominently in these 19 things and sent it to people all over the world. 20 and, you know, when you look through it, 21 they say it is pollution. they say it is medical 22 technology. they say -- there is something in 23 here -- not making this up -- about being a nun. 24 there is stuff in here about being divorced. 25 there is stuff in here about genes, family 4146 1 factors. and it is hard not to -- it seems 2 impossible that anybody could be taken seriously 3 to say this now. but this is what they were 4 telling the medical profession as a result of 5 work that they were doing. this is from the 6 early '50s, '60s. 7 and you will notice, if you look through 8 these, it is always in britain or sweden, because 9 we did not have the internet, cha, cha, cha, cha. 10 that is ridiculous. well, that did not exist in 11 1962, and they were telling the medical 12 profession, hey, you know what, carcinogens 13 do not cause cancer. 14 and it may seem, in the context of a very 15 serious matter like this, ridiculous. but when 16 you look through this, they will tell you that it 17 was baldness -- and i cannot remember if when 18 you are bald, it is more likely that you get it or 19 not, or being left- or right-handed or born in 20 march and all kinds of things that just seem 21 ridiculous, but that is what they did. 22 and, by the way, just part of the trip down 23 memory lane, one of the things that they 24 reported to people, doctors -- and this is from 25 1958, was that japanese people do not get as much 4147 1 cancer as americans, even though they smoke 2 more. that was not news. that was not news. 3 it is not news today. 4 but, you know, to the extent there is been 5 any suggestion in this case that filtered 6 cigarettes pioneered by these people have caused 7 the japanese to have less cancer, there is no 8 evidence of that. and even the thing that 9 mr. feiwus showed dr. cummings on that does not 10 say so. 11 you know, did it work? well, mr. gustafson 12 showed you the documents from where he said that 13 they congratulated themselves. but there is more 14 than that to understand why these things 15 mattered to an addicted smoker. you have got a 16 report, and ignore, if you would, just for a 17 moment, this is in evidence, it is pt3870. it is 18 a federal trade commission -- do you have that 19 up? let us just look through a couple of those. 20 trade commission report in 1967 when there 21 was concern about filtered cigarettes. and, 22 actually, i just will read some of those while 23 baron -- mr. philipson is picking them up. 24 "the failure of the warning statement on 25 packages to have any discernible effect on 4148 1 cigarette consumption is easily explainable. 2 the warning statement on the package alone has 3 proved to be ineffective, mainly because people 4 do not seem to pay --" "-- few people --" excuse 5 me. "-- seem to pay attention to it." 6 and then it talks about the motivations for 7 smoking. and it talks about the extensive 8 advertising in this country. right? 9 and it talks about how the ads blot out the 10 things that people had a right to know. they 11 never showed people with laryngectomies, their 12 larynx cut out. they never showed people not 13 being able to make it -- 14 ms. luther: objection, your honor. [#deleted sidebar#] 7 mr. sales: you will have this in evidence, 8 while mr. philipson is pulling it out, and it is 9 a comprehensive review by the government of not 10 only what it is that people were seeing -- and 11 mind you, we are talking about a time when the -- 12 ms. westmoreland was about 16 years old, at the 13 bottom of page 12, middle of the bottom of 14 page 12 of the report. i'm sorry if i 15 miscommunicated to you. 16 just focus on the bottom. you do not have to 17 highlight it. it is all right. it reviews how 18 many times people are seeing things in a day 19 when we only had three networks for television, 20 including 151.1 million viewers in an individual 21 week in january. that means 141 viewers age 13 22 to 17. 23 that means, on average, next page, "each of 24 the 18 million inhabitants of the united 25 states" -- that would include jayme -- "13 to 17 4152 1 viewed 7.8 of the programs during the week in 2 question. this represents a substantial 3 increase over the 5.9 programs viewed on average 4 by persons without distinction of age. 5 intentional or fortuitous, teenagers appear to 6 be a prime target for televised cigarette 7 advertising." 8 and there is not any dispute about that. 9 this document also contains some information 10 about what they were doing with respect to 11 cigarette advertising and the theme of filters 12 and how those were applied in cigarette 13 advertising. 14 and then it has a discussion, which is what 15 i was talking about before, page 23 of the 16 document, the things that they do not say, the 17 things that were not revealed because the 18 industry, including this defendant, individually 19 and collectively was not going to tell anybody 20 about it. 21 and, yes, it is true you would display in 22 advertising, you would not want to show someone 23 unattractive in your advertising. i do not think 24 anybody argues about that. but the point simply 25 is, is that they were selling a dangerous and 4153 1 addictive product that could kill people after 2 addicting them, and none of those matters were 3 disclosed. 4 you also have in evidence an extensive 5 evaluation of the impact of these things into 6 the 1980s -- into the 1970s, and beginning the 7 1980s in another report. if you show the cover, 8 from 1981, it is the ftc report, and i urge to 9 you look at the introduction. i urge you -- 10 that is chapter one. i urge you to look at the 11 discussion about advertising. because in 1981 12 when the ftc revisited these matters, they 13 reached the same conclusions and said that the 14 same effect of cigarette advertising -- and by 15 that time, as you know, it had already left 16 television -- the impact of advertising from 17 cigarettes was the same. it was the most 18 heavily advertised product in america. 19 and by the way, page 2-3 of that is where 20 those estimates that they were spending more on 21 that in a year -- excuse me, in a day than the 22 government had to spend on smoking and health 23 messages. 24 and then in chapter 3 of this report, and i 25 urge you to look at it, again, it is pt3165, it 4154 1 has an extensive evaluation of the things that 2 americans did not know or knew insufficiently at 3 the time. how many people did not really 4 appreciate the risks of smoking and how many 5 people did not think that cigarettes were 6 addictive. take a look at that, if you would, 7 please, and see how many people did not know the 8 things that liggett says everybody knew. 9 let us talk in that regard about this. 10 because what i heard was that between 1964 when 11 the first surgeon general's report came out that 12 we have been talking about and 1988, there was not 13 any difference in the knowledge about consumers 14 or the public health community about addiction. 15 it was just a name change, just a name change. 16 you know from dr. hurt and dr. cummings and 17 from the industry's own intransigent fighting to 18 have this happen that that is just not true. and 19 you do not have to go very far in this document 20 to find out why that is not so, because the 21 surgeon general, at the introductory sections of 22 the book -- and it is in evidence, i forget the 23 number. 24 mr. philipson: 3828. 25 mr. sales: 3828, it is in evidence, this 4155 1 whole thing. all this stuff is in there. if 2 you just take a look at the introductory 3 section, the surgeon general explains why it is 4 so important. just like mr. gustafson was 5 talking about to re-educate people and tell them 6 that this is an addictive drug that acts on the 7 human brain like other drugs. he talks about 8 how this is going to lead to the development of 9 other therapies, and that is exactly, as you know 10 from the evidence, what happened. 11 let us talk a little more about addiction 12 because, you know, we only have to go back -- 13 and again, if you just -- sometimes when they 14 say everybody knew, because they called it a 15 habituation in a textbook from 1931, they picked 16 that even though the witness says -- their 17 witness says those things change every six to 18 seven years. so you have not had an opportunity 19 to see how, if at all, the controversy might 20 have affected the content of public school books 21 afterwards. 22 but, you know what, we can look. again, 23 take a trip right back to st. petersburg, 24 florida and see if back then, 1994 may, that is a 25 year of importance in this case, and you know 4156 1 why, you know why for a variety of reasons, 2 because you know that the defendant and its 3 co-conspirators were still saying it was not 4 true, that the surgeon general was wrong. but 5 right here in st. petersburg, there was a story 6 in the paper that says from the times 7 publishing, so not sure if there was a wire 8 service involved or not. and what do we know? 9 that is when those hearings were going on we have 10 been hearing about. 11 and remember that fellow, bill dwyer, got up 12 in front of all those microphones, the 13 microphones that nobody was paying attention to, 14 according to the defense, in 1979, and says "it 15 was suspect from" -- that guy, okay. 16 what was going on, what was going on back 17 then, joe califano, he was a secretary of hew 18 they called it then, he was attacking, saying 19 watch out, because he is going to come into your 20 bedroom, going to take your cigarettes and come 21 in your bedroom. remember that guy? all right. 22 so part of this hearing part of this 23 hearing, they were talking about -- mr. califano 24 came in and said, you know, there was just 25 starting to be a lot of talk about that in 4157 1 1970s about that, we were all victims of the 2 concealment. this is the secretary of health, 3 education and welfare. 4 and compare what he probably knew, i would 5 submit to you, as lawyers say, with what jayme 6 westmoreland probably knew in the 30 years 7 before this. "'we were all victims of the 8 concealment and disinformation campaigns of the 9 tobacco company,' said joe a. califano, who 10 once smoked as many as four packs a day, but 11 since has become an anti-tobacco crusader who 12 calls tobacco history's number one serial 13 killer." 14 this is in evidence. he describes that 15 debate that led up to 1979. he said that, 16 "dr. william polin, then director of the 17 national institute on drug abuse, urged carter 18 surgeon general julius richmond to pronounce 19 cigarettes addictive, but richmond resisted, 20 citing a lack of sufficient scientific 21 evidence." 22 there was not any lack of scientific evidence 23 inside the files of these folks. but that was 24 the public status of these things into the 1970s 25 and unknown until secret information was leaked 4158 1 out in the 1990s. 2 and then in another trip down history lane, 3 there is a quote from walter merriman. he was 4 one of those tobacco institute people you have 5 seen in some of the videos. i believe, if not, 6 there were certainly others. and what he said 7 was -- what he said was "vice president of 8 tobacco institute, noting that anti-smoking 9 fervor was far more subdued during the 1960s and 10 '70s when califano served in government than it 11 is today." 12 that even if califano and public health 13 officials had tried to get nicotine declared 14 addictive, it would have been almost impossible 15 for him to do anything more than they did. 16 and you know what? right here in 1994, the 17 same year that means a lot to a lot of people in 18 this case and in this courtroom, we learn from 19 right here in st. petersburg that "in recent 20 weeks, there was a growing debate over smoking, 21 has focused on whether nicotine is indeed 22 addictive, as numerous medical experts have 23 maintained, and whether the tobacco industry has 24 been manipulating levels of nicotine in 25 cigarettes to keep smokers hooked on its 4159 1 products." 2 and then at the end, they talk about one of 3 the documents that you have seen in this case, 4 going back, addison yeaman, back in 1963. i 5 think that might be a typo. but certainly is 6 similar to what is described here. they knew it 7 back then. 8 so you are asked to measure the conduct of 9 jayme westmoreland and decide for yourself, if 10 you would, please, whether when the secretary of 11 hew comes and says, i did not know that, i would 12 have done differently, whether it is fair, 13 whether it is fair to say to these folks, my 14 clients, it is all your mother's fault. 15 it is not right. that would not be a just 16 verdict. and that is why mr. gustafson suggested 17 the figures to you that he suggested. 18 and consider the testimony of the expert 19 witnesses in this case on this question. 20 because the defense position is even when it 21 comes to filters, not only, poof, you never 22 listened to what we said, you never listened to 23 the gas -- those are all in evidence. you can 24 look at them. not only you never listened to 25 that, but that you should have known better that 4160 1 filters were doing nothing. the thing that we 2 spent so much money investigating about it, 3 right. 4 and you know not only, not only because this 5 is undisputed from dr. cummings, and defense 6 does not dispute this, that there are no safer, 7 you know from the documents, things concealed by 8 co-conspirators in this case that they knew it 9 and they knew it back in the 1950s, they knew 10 it. 11 and you know from dr. cummings and dr. hurt 12 that the public health community itself did not 13 recognize these things -- what was it? 14 dr. cummings -- 15 2001, i believe, was the testimony of 16 dr. cummings, and they want to tell you that 17 jayme westmoreland, who selected filtered 18 cigarettes -- and there has been testimony about 19 that -- it is all her fault, when sophisticated 20 scientific people who dedicated their lives to 21 these matters during those same decades were 22 telling people to switch to the same products 23 that she switched to, where this defendant was 24 bragging about those things. and that is why 25 that number, that amount of responsibility of 4161 1 fault you put on her should be small. 2 finally, i did not talk about the 3 compensatory damages, the entitlement to 4 punitive damages. i started with that. it is 5 very clear. and we just ask you, you know, 6 think about the way the case was tried a little 7 bit and, you know, there are two sides. 8 mr. gustafson said there is only one side to the 9 story. well, you know, there are -- there are 10 some parts of this story that have two sides. 11 and that was what the controversy was all about. 12 but at the end of the day, it does not 13 matter. if you find that ms. westmoreland was a 14 member of the engle class, because the 15 resolution, the decisions that you have to make, 16 we would submit to you, on these other matters 17 are transparent and clear in this record. 18 yes, she deserves some responsibility, and 19 mr. gustafson hit that nail on the head. but on 20 those other questions, on those liability 21 questions, we ask you for these folks, my 22 clients, to return a verdict in their favor on 23 all of those questions, and award an appropriate 24 amount of compensatory damages for their loss. 25 thank you very, very much. it is been a 4162 1 pleasure to get the opportunity to do this and 2 do this in a place like this for these folks. 3 and i appreciate everything that everybody in 4 this courtroom contributes to that. thank you 5 so much. 6 thank you, judge.
