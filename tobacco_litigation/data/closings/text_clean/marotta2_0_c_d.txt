10 mr. belasic: thank you, your honor, and 11 good morning, counsel, mr. marotta. 12 ladies and gentlemen, i also want to thank 13 you. every lawyer in this room, we volunteered 14 for this case. we were not called in. 15 when you got your summons in the mail, you 16 were, in effect, drafted, and i thank you for 17 stepping up to the call of duty. without your 18 participation, this great principle of 19 democracy called jury trials would not exist. 20 now, throughout the seven or eight days of 21 evidence in this case and for the overwhelming 22 majority of time that mr. alvarez spent 23 speaking, what you have seen is an attempt to 24 retry those findings, the findings that they 25 talk about from that other lawsuit, from engle, 2664 1 findings on concealment or negligence. 2 but as the judge instructs you in the jury 3 instruction, this case is not about 4 re-litigating that case. this case is about 5 mr. marotta and why mr. marotta died. 6 all of the key questions on the verdict 7 form are about mr. marotta, not are tobacco 8 companies bad, not are we mad at tobacco 9 companies. they are about mr. marotta. 10 now, the judge is going to instruct you as 11 follows: "the manufacture and advertisement 12 and sale of cigarettes are lawful activities." 13 everyone knows they are. it is legal to 14 make them. it is legal to advertise them. even 15 if it makes us mad when we go 50 years back and 16 see an ad that mr. marotta never even saw, it is 17 legal to advertise that. 18 the warning labels that are on the packs 19 comply with federal law. there is no claim in 20 this case that r.j. reynolds broke the law, 21 that they did not comply. 22 and after 1969, because of those warnings, 23 cigarette advertising cannot be the subject of 24 any claim that the advertising undermined or 25 neutralized those warnings. 2665 1 now, why do i mention that? when we 2 started this case, i put up that date, may 5, 3 1982. i was the one who talked about it in 4 opening. 5 now, at the time, you probably wondered, 6 what is it? it is not somebody's birthday. is 7 it a significant moment in tobacco history? 8 no. 9 i told you that that was the date which 10 the law requires, and which judge tuter has 11 instructed you, that is the date after which 12 they have to prove that mr. marotta saw a 13 statement, that that statement was false, and 14 that he relied upon it, that it caused him, in 15 effect, to develop lung cancer. 16 and i told you, i challenged the 17 plaintiffs, when the first witness took the 18 stand, dr. proctor, the historian from 19 california, i told you that he would not say 20 anything, anything about the plaintiff or 21 mr. marotta, the smoker, seeing a statement 22 after 1982 and believing it and changing his 23 testimony, and that is exactly what he admitted. 24 that is the cutoff date. and here it is. 25 this is the verdict form. you are going to be 2666 1 asked: did phil marotta rely on a statement by 2 r.j. reynolds. the date was after may 5, 1982. 3 the next two questions: did phil marotta 4 rely to his detriment on an act taken by r.j. 5 reynolds or in agreement with other companies? 6 and look what the date is. this is what you 7 have to decide. was this act taken after 8 may 5, 1982? 9 did phil marotta rely on these statements 10 after 1982? this is an easy question for you 11 to answer, and you do not have to believe me. 12 you do not have to believe any tobacco company, 13 because it was their witness. 14 they hired and they paid an expert named 15 dr. difranza, remember him, he was the man from 16 massachusetts. they paid him to review, and he 17 said he had reviewed every single deposition, 18 all of the testimony by phil marotta, and 19 everyone whose testimony was in this case. 20 i asked him about his opinion, having 21 reviewed everything, was mr. marotta somehow 22 tricked? what did he believe about lung 23 cancer? and look at what he said. 24 "there is not any dispute that at that 25 time, based on the tragic death of his parents, 2667 1 that he personally believed that smoking could 2 be -- could cause lung cancer at that point?" 3 he agrees, "yes. 4 "and that was in the late '70s? 5 "right." 6 that is their expert. at the very 7 beginning of his testimony, he says that 8 mr. marotta personally believed by the late 9 '70s, that it caused lung cancer. so of 10 course, your answer has to be no on this 11 question. 12 now, dr. proctor also came up. remember 13 what he did. he testified on a monday and he 14 talked about a hundred years back, smoking 15 machines, world war i, things before 16 mr. marotta was even born. 17 and then on tuesday, dr. proctor got all 18 the way up to the '30s, '40s, and '50s. some 19 of that, before mr. marotta was even born, but 20 almost all of it before he even started 21 smoking. 22 and then, finally, on his third day of 23 testimony, at ten minutes to 10 in the morning, 24 because i wrote the time down, dr. proctor 25 finally, finally got up to 1982. he wasted 2668 1 your time. 2 the judge is instructing you that the 3 finding here has to be about statements after 4 may 5, 1982. we did not have to sit here for 5 three days to hear all the things -- remember 6 what he admitted about the advertisements. 7 he said the lawyers picked out the 8 advertisements. he said he had been paid one 9 million dollars total to testify in cases 10 brought by lawyers who sue tobacco companies, 11 and he said the lawyers in this case picked out 12 the ads for him. 13 he admitted they were before he started 14 smoking or they were for brands he did not 15 smoke, and there were only a handful of winston 16 ads. you know what, nothing after 1982. 17 i asked him, are you claiming that 18 mr. marotta relied after '82? you saw what he 19 said. i'm not making any claims about his 20 life. i'm here to talk about the industry. 21 well, that is not relevant, because judge 22 tutor tells you it is after may 1982 and it has 23 to be something that mr. marotta relied on and 24 changed his behavior. 25 i tried to sum it up. you are not 2669 1 claiming, are you, that any of the information 2 that you have talked about or that you have put up 3 on the screen is proof that mr. marotta was 4 influenced by something that a tobacco company 5 said. and he said, that is correct. 6 and that is for everything that he talked 7 about. within five minutes -- after two days 8 on the stand being questioned by plaintiff's 9 lawyers. within five minutes, dr. proctor 10 said, the lawyers picked out the ads and i'm 11 not claiming that mr. marotta saw anything. 12 i'm not claiming it influenced him at all. and 13 he admits it was not proof of that. 14 now, mr. alvarez spent about one minute 15 telling you that he thinks the evidence 16 supports the fact that mr. marotta was somehow 17 confused. 18 here is the rest of the story. you heard 19 a tremendous amount of evidence about what 20 mr. marotta knew. 21 in 1959, they say that was the year he 22 first smoked a cigarette. in 1959, harvard did 23 a study and found that ninety percent of junior 24 high students had already heard that smoking 25 causes cancer. 2670 1 in the 1960s, his best friend from school, 2 mr. gelfano, said that in the 1960s when they 3 were in school, they were using the terms 4 "cancer sticks" and "nicotine fit," and he said 5 that mr. marotta would have known that, that 6 the cigarettes he held in his hand were called, 7 by ordinary people, by young people, "cancer 8 sticks." 9 denunzio, his partner, asked him and said 10 that he knew smoking caused cancer as a 11 teenager. you did not hear that today. 12 mr. denunzio said that marotta told him that, 13 when he was a teenager, that he believed 14 smoking could cause cancer. 15 we know that the surgeon general's report 16 on cancer came out when he was in school. we 17 know that just right after high school, the 18 pack warnings came out, and we know he ignored 19 those warnings. we know he ignored those 20 warnings. he did not try to quit. 21 we know that in the late '60s and the 22 early '70's, his father died of lung cancer. 23 we know that his mother died of lung cancer. 24 and his own expert says that, because of that 25 event -- remember what dr. difranza said, there 2671 1 is no dispute that he did not rely on something 2 after 1982. there is no dispute that 3 mr. marotta personally believed that smoking 4 could cause lung cancer. 5 that is the expert that they paid to give 6 you the opinion, to look at everything, and to 7 sum it up. he agrees with us. 8 you have seen the pack warnings and they try 9 to belittle them throughout, but there is no 10 question that, before 1982, every single pack 11 that mr. marotta was smoking contained those 12 warnings. 13 now, was there any proof at all that 14 mr. marotta died because of something that r.j. 15 reynolds said or that if r.j. reynolds had not 16 said something, that he would have instantly 17 quit smoking, that he would not have gotten 18 lung cancer? we know his parents smoked and he 19 copied them. we know his friends smoked and he 20 followed them. 21 here is what the witnesses said. we asked 22 each of these witnesses whether they had any 23 evidence or whether they were claiming that 24 mr. marotta relied. 25 phil marotta, junior, the plaintiff, his 2672 1 wife, marie, andrea, jill marotta, roberto 2 pinto, and all of them said there is no 3 evidence he relied. 4 now, jill marotta said that her father 5 told her in the hospital he remembered back 6 when he started smoking and he remembered 7 something about a santa advertisement. 8 i specifically asked her: did he tell 9 you, are you claiming that he relied on that, 10 that somehow that is what caused him to start 11 smoking winstons? and she said, no. 12 and she said the same thing for the doctor 13 ad. and i think you saw when i asked jill 14 marotta, no one else in the family had ever 15 heard that story. she had never shared it with 16 anyone. no one else in the family ever said 17 that phil marotta told them why he started 18 smoking. 19 and you will have to judge the credibility 20 of that statement. but even jill marotta 21 agreed that her father had not relied on a santa 22 ad or something with doctors and she agreed 23 that she did not even know if they were from 24 r.j. reynolds. 25 and of course, their expert, dr. difranza, 2673 1 knew all this and he admitted, there is no 2 reliance. 3 now, you heard a story about giacomo 4 denunzio, mr. marotta's partner, when he 5 testified on the stand and we read his 6 deposition, he was contacted by plaintiff's 7 lawyers, a woman named laura damiani, she is 8 one of the lawyers for mr. marotta. she is not 9 here today. but that is what he testified to. 10 she asked him if he would sign an 11 affidavit. that is sworn testimony that you 12 write down on a piece of paper. she asked him 13 if he would sign it. she called him on the 14 phone. they mailed the affidavit to him, and, 15 sure enough, he signed it. 16 and what did it say. he signed an 17 affidavit that said, "mr. marotta told me that 18 he relied on some things." you heard his 19 testimony. what happened? 20 at deposition, when we got the chance to 21 ask him the questions, he said, under oath, the 22 information in the affidavit that the 23 plaintiff's lawyer mailed him was not true, was 24 not true. 25 that is the only attempt by the plaintiffs 2674 1 to prove that something after 1980 was actually 2 seen, seen by mr. marotta, actually believed. 3 and it was based on an affidavit that a lawyer 4 wrote that the witness said was not true. 5 denunzio said he heard the statement, not 6 mr. marotta. he said he saw a tv show, not 7 mr. marotta. it was not r.j. reynolds. he said 8 mr. marotta had no great reaction to it. 9 and when we asked him, did mr. marotta 10 tell you when he first learned or believed that 11 smoking could cause cancer? he said, since he 12 was a teenager. 13 you are going to have to decide whether you 14 believe his sworn testimony or some piece of 15 paper that one of his lawyers got him to sign. 16 every witness we ask questions like this: 17 did mr. marotta rely on the frank statement? 18 everyone agrees he did not. 19 ctr, tirc, the tobacco institute 20 statements, no one has any evidence that he 21 even saw this stuff, let alone relied on it. 22 and his own expert agrees that there is no 23 evidence of reliance. if you believe 24 dr. proctor -- you do not even believe me. you 25 believe dr. proctor and you believe 2675 1 dr. difranza, then your answer on these 2 questions -- actually, no, no evidence of 3 reliance, no evidence of reliance. 4 question eight: no evidence of reliance. 5 question nine: no evidence of reliance. 6 their experts admit that, and they brought 7 them into court to admit that. 8 you heard some evidence about him smoking 9 marijuana. now, who cares if he smoked pot, 10 right. well, in a lot of ways, we do not care 11 if he smoked pot at all. 12 but consider this, he smoked marijuana for 13 enjoyment. cigarettes were not the only thing 14 he smoked. he also smoked pot for several 15 years. 16 but there was not any advertising for 17 smoking marijuana. there was not a marijuana 18 institute. there was not a marijuana conspiracy 19 or a marijuana council for research. he smoked 20 marijuana because he liked it. 21 now, dr. fleiter was asked about 22 marijuana, and he actually said one puff might 23 cause lung cancer. you remember his extreme 24 views? he is the doctor who came in that -- the 25 pathologist they picked. they picked a doctor 2676 1 who said that one puff of a cigarette can cause 2 lung cancer. do you see any evidence in the 3 world that that is true? 4 is that credible based on the evidence and 5 your common sense? and then he said, well, i 6 guess one puff of marijuana can cause lung 7 cancer, too. does not make any sense. 8 but the fact that he smoked marijuana for 9 enjoyment proves there is nothing to do with the 10 conspiracy here. it is a man who lived for the 11 moment. he did what he enjoyed. he was not 12 being deceived, and he certainly did not rely. 13 let us talk about the medical case. i 14 think you ought to take a look at the death 15 certificate when you go back to the jury room. 16 you can ask for any document. you can ask for 17 the death certificate. 18 but here it is. this is the official 19 record of what caused his death, and all it 20 says is lung cancer and then it says spread to 21 the bone. 22 lung cancer. you see the place where it 23 says, what is this lung cancer due to? what is 24 this lung cancer caused by? 25 they left it blank. they left it blank. 2677 1 that is the official determination of death. 2 lung cancer, no reason, no cause for the lung 3 cancer. take a look at the death certificate 4 when you go back. 5 now, why did they leave it blank? why did 6 they not reach a determination of what caused 7 his lung cancer? why did not they say what kind 8 of lung cancer it is? because, notice, it 9 does not say the cell types that dr. fleiter 10 said or the different cell types that dr. villa 11 said. why? 12 well, none of his doctors testified, not 13 one doctor in this trial that actually saw 14 mr. marotta came to court, and ask yourself why 15 is that. 16 if it was so obvious that his doctors 17 believed that, would not one of them come in? 18 could not they have found one of them to say it? 19 none of his doctors testified that he was 20 addicted. and none of his doctors testified 21 that addiction caused his cancer. none. 22 now, the medical records themselves also 23 have a complete lack of proof. there is not a 24 single medical record in this case that says 25 smoking causes lung cancer. there is not a 2678 1 single medical record in this case that says 2 addiction causes lung cancer. 3 so i was surprised to hear mr. freidin 4 say -- talk to you about a doctor named 5 dr. goscin. 6 have you ever heard of dr. goscin until 7 mr. freidin mentioned him? and you can ask for 8 this record as well. g-o-s-c-i-n. that is the 9 doctor that mr. freidin claimed reached a 10 determination that it was a smoking-related 11 cancer. 12 how can that be? because i'm telling you 13 the evidence is none of his doctors, none of 14 his doctors determined that. well, one of us 15 is right. let us look at the facts. 16 of course mr. freidin did not show you what 17 he was claiming, did he? this is the pathology 18 report, phil marotta. look who signed it, 19 that is the dr. goscin. dr. goscin that 20 mr. freidin was talking about. 21 look what he says. the diagnosis is a 22 needle aspiration biopsy, we know that. he 23 says, large cell. 24 there is not anything on this record, see, 25 nothing that says smoking. nothing that says 2679 1 smoking is the cause. and even if it was large 2 cell, does he reach a conclusion of what caused 3 it? mr. freidin told you that this dr. goscin 4 had somehow decided it. 5 the facts say that statement just was not 6 true. and you can ask for any medical record, 7 and you will not find any doctor, that is why they 8 did not come in here, that is why the death 9 certificate is blank. 10 everyone agrees that he got lung cancer at 11 an extremely unusual age. right off the bat, 12 we knew this was an unusual case, and their 13 experts agree. 14 it was so unusual, they did a study on a 15 million men and women, about a hundred thousand 16 of them were male smokers. they found out 17 about 1,772 died of lung cancer. only 31 were 18 men under the age of 50. biggest study done, 19 less than 2 percent of the people get lung 20 cancer at such an early age. 21 all the experts agree it was unusual. but 22 the plaintiff's expert, dr. villa, who they 23 brought in, good doctor, a very nice man, he 24 talked about his charity. he admitted, though, 25 right off the bat, the first thing you think 2680 1 about in a case this young is a family history, 2 a family history, something in their genes. he 3 said it raised a red flag that something other 4 than smoking was involved. that is not our 5 expert. that is their expert who they paid to 6 testify. 7 this was his testimony. he used this 8 phrase, the family has genetic abnormalities. 9 the family has genetic abnormalities. that is 10 their expert. he said that these genetic 11 abnormalities, the family history is very 12 significant, very significant. those, again, 13 were his words, their expert. 14 he said it could increase the risk of lung 15 cancer five times even if you smoke, and he had 16 to say that because that is what the surgeon 17 general has decided. 18 if parents have a history of lung cancer, 19 it is a five-fold increase in the lung cancer 20 risk and look what they say, after cigarette 21 smoking. 22 so what that means is you look at smokers, 23 and smokers have a higher chance of getting 24 cancer. if they have a family history, it is 25 five times that, five times that of the smoking 2681 1 risk. 2 there was not any evidence to dispute this. 3 five times. so the risk from smoking is over 4 here. the risk for family history is five 5 times greater. 6 and dr. villa admitted that even if he had 7 never smoked, people with this kind of family 8 history can get lung cancer, and that is why 9 you will have to decide. that is why his doctors 10 never found that cancer was caused by smoking. 11 one of his doctors thought, not 12 mr. marotta, as mr. freidin said, one of his 13 doctors thought it was the family history of 14 asbestosis, because his parents did not just 15 have lung cancer. both his mother and his 16 father had asbestos-related disease. 17 this is his own doctor's record. where 18 was this doctor? did he come in to testify? 19 no. they hired people from philadelphia and a 20 doctor from miami who had never seen him. 21 this doctor thought asbestos was 22 contributory. now, is that why the death 23 certificate is blank? is that why there is no 24 official cause of death in the record? is that 25 why none of his doctors concluded that smoking 2682 1 had caused his cancer? that is for you to 2 decide. 3 but everyone agrees that the cell type, 4 whether it is genetics, asbestos, everyone 5 agrees that if he had bac, it is not caused by 6 smoking. 7 one of the things we learned, that it 8 was not just 1 or 2 percent of the population 9 that gets bac, it is actually up to twenty percent. 10 and how do we know that? 11 well, the very last questions that 12 mr. freidin was asking our expert, he pulled 13 out the study and he showed him a study of bac. 14 this was picked by the plaintiff's lawyer. 15 and when dennis got the chance to 16 redirect, to ask some questions, they pointed 17 out that that study said, the american cancer 18 society had looked and done a series of 19 investigations on bac in the late '80s, just a 20 few years before mr. marotta got lung cancer, 21 twenty percent -- so all of this stuff about the 22 pennies, it is silly. 23 twenty percent of lung cancers are bac. but 24 no matter what the statistics are, we are not 25 talking about all the pennies. we are talking 2683 1 about the penny that is mr. marotta, that is the 2 penny we are talking about. his doctors never 3 determined the cause of his cancer. 4 we know it occurs in younger people. 5 everyone agrees it is out on the periphery of 6 the lung, and that is right where his cancer 7 was, and it can be invasive and spreads early. 8 why do we say that? what was the proof? 9 the world health organization, the leading 10 experts on classifying these tumors, there is no 11 dispute this was the classification of bac at 12 the time that mr. marotta got his cancer. 13 there is no dispute, this was the 14 classification of bac at the time that 15 mr. marotta got his cancer. 16 and you see the bacs, they are peripherally 17 situated, at the edge of the lung, everyone 18 agrees, and look what they say, bacs tend to 19 spread early, both within and outside the 20 chest. 21 that is the world health organization. 22 they do not know the tobacco company. they are 23 not hired by the lawyers, like their experts 24 were. that is what the world health 25 organization says. 2684 1 now, right off the bat, the pathologist 2 that they brought in and that was dr. fleiter 3 who writes articles and textbooks. he goes to 4 conferences, no one denies that he is an expert 5 before, but look what he admitted. 6 they only had a small sample. they only 7 had a tiny fraction of the tumor. the tumor 8 was about 2 centimeters. that is about 9 three-quarters inch wide, a little smaller than 10 a golf ball. 11 and the only part of the tumor that they 12 took was a tiny fraction that could fit in a 13 needle. he admits that. 14 he says that there is something called 15 interobserver variability. that just means two 16 guys can get it wrong, two women can get it 17 wrong. people can disagree. 18 well, how often do they get it wrong? he 19 said, in forty percent of the cases, when you do 20 an autopsy, you find out that the cell type 21 that the doctors thought, that the doctors 22 guessed at was wrong. 23 so if i was going to use the coin analogy 24 again, this is what their own expert said. 25 it is almost like flipping a coin, because if 2685 1 you do an autopsy, forty percent of the time 2 they are wrong. 3 well, we know it is true, because none of 4 the experts, none of the evidence that they 5 rely on agrees. 6 you saw that one of the records said large 7 cell, but dr. fleiter who they hired to come 8 in, he did not agree. he said it was a 9 different type of cancer, adeno. and then 10 dr. villa, who certainly has great experience. 11 we do not doubt that. he has great experience, 12 look what he said. 13 he said, well, i think it is fifty percent 14 large cell. it could be 25 percent 15 adenocarcinoma and then, right at the end of 16 his testimony, he said i also see some 17 squamous. 18 so none of them agree, dr. villa thinks, 19 well, it could be three different kinds of 20 things and everyone agrees, you just had a tiny 21 sample. 22 their own experts do not agree with each 23 other. if they cannot convince each other, i 24 submit they should not convince you. 25 as you saw from experts on both sides, the 2686 1 issue of whether his cancer is a bac turns on 2 whether the cells lining these air sacs are 3 cancer. dr. shmookler who is looked at hundreds 4 and thousands of cases of cancer, he is the head 5 of pathology of one of the largest hospitals in 6 the country. they like to make fun of him and 7 say, oh, he had the nerve to get a skin cancer 8 pathology certification. 9 they do not tell you he was board-certified 10 as a pathologist for 35 years, both in 11 anatomical pathology and in clinical pathology. 12 just like dr. villa, their expert, he also 13 got a certification in another area. but he 14 ran one of the biggest hospitals in the 15 country, their pathology department, and saw 16 hundreds of thousands of cases. 17 here is what dr. shmookler showed you from 18 the slides. on the right -- sorry -- on the 19 left, you have mr. marotta's lung. everyone 20 agrees, both experts, that is an air sac. that 21 white space are the air sacs and, here, look, 22 you do not have all these cells and all these 23 unusual cells on the periphery, away from this, 24 but right along the air sacs. clustering along 25 the air sacs, you see this. 2687 1 now, here is a textbook, what both sides 2 agree is a type of stock photo that doctors 3 use. this is a textbook photo of bac. look at 4 this. compare it to this. 5 notice the size, very similar. notice the 6 shape, very similar. notice where they are 7 located. on the air sac. on the air sac. 8 you know, the plaintiffs' lawyers talked a 9 lot about our guy wrote a textbook. but this 10 is the textbook and, in the end, you have two 11 experts saying, i think these cancer cells are 12 cancer, i think these cells are just the result 13 of inflammation. 14 you have to decide. but when you do that, 15 remember, none of the doctors that actually saw 16 him ever reached the conclusion that it was 17 smoking and that is why the death certificate is 18 blank. 19 here is another textbook photo of what bac 20 looks like and here is an actual photo of 21 mr. marotta's lung and notice the similarities 22 in the pattern, notice the similarities in the 23 size and shape of the cancer cells. 24 here is an air sac. it looks like a lake. 25 you can see the cancer cells, again, clustered 2688 1 around the edges. 2 same thing if you look at the textbook. 3 now, should not the experts have done some tests 4 that were available. should not you at least 5 have the right to hear whether tests were done? 6 we asked dr. fleiter: there are tests 7 today that can determine cell type, were they 8 done? no. there are tests that can determine 9 asbestos? he says they were not done. 10 there are tests that can determine if 11 cigarette smoking was the cause? he talked 12 about various tests on genetics. 13 none of these tests were done. there is 14 no actual test proof. what they are saying is 15 these doctors who they hire and who they come 16 in can disagree with the death certificate, can 17 give a contrary opinion to every doctor that 18 saw him. 19 that is what they want you to base their 20 proof on. but they did not do any of the tests 21 that might have supported that. 22 dr. fleiter said he did not see anything 23 under the microscope that could say that the 24 cancer is a tobacco cancer. but look what he 25 admitted. 2689 1 he freely admitted, if they had actually 2 gotten the whole tumor instead of just a tiny 3 fraction, it could have been bac, he admitted 4 that. 5 remember when they wrote one hundred percent 6 certainty on the board? well, dr. fleiter 7 was not one hundred percent certain because he said, if 8 we got the rest of the tumor, it could have 9 been bac. he said if we got the rest of the 10 tumor, it could have contained asbestos and, of 11 course, he do not do any tests and no one else 12 did to determine whether that is true. 13 the last thing i want to say about the 14 medical evidence is that we called another one 15 of their experts. dr. neal messinger is a 16 radiologist. that means it is a doctor who 17 looks at x-rays and ct scans. 18 he was hired by plaintiffs. you heard the 19 testimony that he met with laura damiani, a 20 lawyer for mr. marotta again, and bob schack. 21 he said they met with him, they brought the 22 reports to him. pretty much similar to what 23 they were talking about with dr. shmookler. 24 they did not call him. so we read his 25 sworn testimony. this is the plaintiff's 2690 1 expert on x-rays and cts. he says he looks at 2 how many x-rays and cts a day, a hundred, a 3 hundred a day. he is seen hundreds, who knows, 4 if not thousands of lung cancers. 5 he was asked, can bac present the way 6 mr. marotta's tumor did? and he was asked, 7 this was a tumor that grew, it blocked that 8 superior vena cava, that vein that they talked 9 about and he said yes, it can. 10 can bac grow enough that it blocks this 11 big vein? and he said yes, i think it could. 12 he also said that bac can be an aggressive 13 tumor. 14 well, they did not call him and you will see 15 his testimony contradicted - contradicted what 16 dr. villa said. 17 so their own radiology expert says it can 18 be bac. no doctor ever determined this. 19 your honor, is this a good breaking point? 20 the court: keep going. 21 mr. belasic: both sides have talked to 22 you about the burden of proof. we have already 23 discussed this first part. 24 it is their burden to prove phil marotta 25 had a type of lung cancer caused by smoking. 2691 1 it is their burden to prove that their 2 conclusion, which is different than the doctors 3 who saw him, is supported by evidence. 4 now we have two interlinking issues. you 5 have to decide if phil marotta was addicted, 6 and you have to decide whether addiction was 7 the legal cause of phil marotta's death. 8 now, you heard a lot of talk by 9 mr. freidin this morning, about addiction. 10 what you did not hear very much of is this 11 part: was addiction a legal cause of phil 12 marotta's death? 13 well, they brought dr. difranza to the 14 stand and he talked all about addiction, but 15 one thing he did not testify to was that 16 addiction was a legal cause or addiction was a 17 cause of mr. marotta's cancer. 18 their own expert never said that. we know 19 that none of the actual doctors who really saw 20 mr. marotta reached that conclusion. we know 21 there are no medical records that say addiction 22 was the cause of the lung cancer. 23 we know the death certificate does not even 24 list a cause of cancer. it does not say smoking 25 and, obviously, it does not say addiction. 2692 1 you have heard this, that in order for the 2 plaintiffs to prove that addiction caused lung 3 cancer, it has to involve at least three 4 things. it has to be a direct cause, not 5 indirect. it has to be continuous, continuous 6 addiction, causation of lung cancer, and it has 7 to be substantial. 8 at the very beginning of this case, 9 mr. alvarez said, we want you to know that we 10 take responsibility for mr. marotta causing his 11 own injury. he quickly said it was just 12 partial. 13 but they said that from the very 14 beginning, and if you look at the jury 15 instructions, judge tuter instructs you that 16 the plaintiff is legally responsible for 17 causing his injury. 18 you have to decide the percentage, if you 19 reach it. but let us think about what does that 20 mean. why on earth would phil marotta, the 21 son, admit that his father was legally 22 responsible for causing his own cancer? 23 well, first, it has to mean that 24 mr. marotta knew that smoking was dangerous. 25 it has to mean that he chose to continue to 2693 1 quit. because if mr. marotta did not really 2 know any of the dangers, they would never say 3 he was legally responsible for causing his own 4 injury. they would say he is blameless. 5 it has to mean, when they admit this, that 6 mr. marotta had the ability to quit. because 7 if he did not have the ability to quit, why on 8 earth would the plaintiff in this case and the 9 lawyers tell you that he caused his own injury, 10 at least in part. they would not. he would be 11 blameless if he did not have the ability to 12 quit. 13 and it has to mean that mr. marotta had 14 the ability to quit smoking at a time that 15 would have prevented his death. because if he 16 could not quit, or if it was too late, then how 17 could they admit that he was legally 18 responsible for causing his injury? 19 that is what they said off the bat and 20 that is what mr. marotta said when he took the 21 stand. 22 but that is not what you heard in this 23 trial. they call experts to say the exact 24 opposite. they brought an expert, difranza, 25 that said, well, no matter how he tried, he 2694 1 could not quit. how can that make sense? 2 they tell you on the one hand, he is 3 legally responsible for causing his own injury, 4 and you heard judge tuter's instructions, 5 because he basically did not try hard enough. 6 you will read the instruction. 7 and then their expert comes in and says, 8 oh, no, he could not quit smoking. well, which 9 is it? 10 their expert says that nicotine addiction 11 controlled mr. marotta, that he was caught in 12 some cycle. he had no choice. he said there 13 was nothing more he could do. 14 remember dr. difranza, nothing more he 15 could do. you have to decide, does that make 16 sense? you do not get to choose, though, 17 whether they should be bound by their 18 admission. you do not get to choose that, 19 because judge tuter's instruction is clear. 20 the plaintiffs have admitted, and you are 21 required to find that mr. marotta caused his 22 own injury. 23 sure, if you get to the question, you can 24 decide a percentage. but you are not allowed 25 to say he did not cause his own injury. and 2695 1 that means that he was able to quit, and we 2 know that from the experts. that means that he 3 could have quit and avoided his injury. 4 otherwise, they would never have admitted it. 5 you will have to decide why they then called 6 experts to contradict almost everything they 7 said on this issue. 8 now, we are going to show, and we are going 9 to review some of the evidence, that addiction 10 was not a direct cause of his death and, of 11 course, none of their experts said this. they 12 did not even ask -- dr. difranza did not even 13 testify on that issue. 14 that it was not continuous. there is not 15 continuous evidence of addiction, let alone 16 that it was caused. we know his own doctors 17 did not say this and we know that the plaintiff 18 is admitting, in effect, that mr. marotta could 19 have quit and, therefore, he is responsible for 20 his own death. 21 now, there was a lot of talk about 22 dr. benowitz and it is true, he was the 23 plaintiff's expert. you saw him. he is no 24 friend of the tobacco industry, obviously. he 25 talked about the dangers of smoking and he 2696 1 talked about nicotine. 2 but we called him in our case because, as 3 he told you, he has done more research on 4 nicotine than anyone in the world. he was the 5 scientific editor for the surgeon general's 6 report on addiction. 7 so the surgeon general, the doctor with 8 the beard, when he comes out and talks about 9 it, the man he hired, the man who was the top 10 scientist, who wrote the report and who did 11 more research than anyone, that is who we 12 called. 13 do not let them suggest that, hey, r.j. 14 reynolds did not call anyone on addiction. we 15 called the most qualified person in the 16 country, according to the plaintiffs. 17 we know mr. marotta could have avoided his 18 cancer if he had quit. the surgeon general 19 tells us. 20 "after ten years of quitting, your risk 21 begins to approach that of one who has never 22 smoked." 23 after ten years of quitting, your risk 24 goes almost all the way down to a person who 25 has never smoked. 2697 1 he got his cancer in 1994. if he quit in 2 1984, his risk could have gone back to normal. 3 if he quit in the '70s or the '60s or the '50s, 4 all of the times where he never even tried to 5 quit, he could have avoided his injury. 6 i'm not going to say a lot about 7 addiction. you are going to use your common 8 sense. the issue here is whether addiction was 9 the cause of his cancer. 10 but dr. difranza came in, and it was a 11 little surprising. he used this psychiatric 12 manual. and i asked him, have you ever used it 13 before in your practice? no, not once. they 14 brought a guy in who had never used the 15 psychiatric manual. 16 why? well, because he is not a 17 psychiatrist. he is not licensed to practice as 18 a psychiatrist. he came in here basically 19 pretending to be a psychiatrist. 20 the very book he used says you cannot do 21 that. it is important that dsm-iv not be 22 applied mechanically by an untrained 23 individual. 24 and he said, you know, the only time i use 25 this dsm-iv is in cases where the tobacco 2698 1 plaintiff lawyers hire me to do it. he is not 2 qualified on that issue. 3 you will have to decide why they even tried 4 to do that. 5 but what we do know, because i asked 6 dr. difranza, is that even if there is a 7 diagnosis under this psychiatric manual, it 8 does not mean you cannot control your behavior. 9 it says, "the fact that an individual 10 meets the criteria for a dsm-iv diagnosis 11 does not carry any necessary implication 12 regarding the individual's degree of control 13 over his behavior." 14 you know, i showed that to dr. difranza 15 and he did not know. he said -- i asked him, 16 did you even read the book that you relied on? 17 and he said, well, i read the introduction. 18 and then i had to point out that that is exactly 19 where it is from, the introduction. 20 so i do not know what was up. you have to 21 decide what he was doing when he was making 22 those claims under oath. 23 he said, well, you know, everyone can quit 24 except the heavy smokers. he made a big deal 25 out of it. he said in my 32 years, i've never 2699 1 seen a research study that said heavy smokers 2 can quit. i said, is that really true. 3 i showed him what took me a half hour to 4 find, remember those questions, and he said, i 5 think you are trying to trick me. i asked him, 6 well, wait a second, you said in 32 years, 7 you have never even seen it. 8 well, here it is in probably the most 9 obvious source available, the national cancer 10 institute and american cancer society study. 11 their expert apparently had never heard of 12 this. 13 they followed a million smokers and of the 14 people who smoked two packs a day or more, 15 54 percent had quit. now, look at the period, 16 1959, the exact year that mr. marotta smoked 17 his first cigarette, from '59 to '72. 18 that is only about 12 or 13 years. 19 mr. marotta smoked for more than 30. in just 20 12 years, more than half of the people who were 21 heavy smokers, who smoked two packs a day quit. 22 do not let anyone here tell you that there 23 was evidence that it is impossible to do it 24 because dr. difranza was not even aware of the 25 evidence. 2700 1 they can quit. half of them quit in just 2 12 years. we know the government says, and the 3 studies suggest, that everyone can quit 4 smoking. that is the official position of the 5 experts at the united states government. it is 6 not a tobacco company issue. 7 this is what the antismoking experts at 8 the government said, everyone can quit. 9 dr. benowitz, he wrote the book. he literally 10 wrote the surgeon general's report on 11 addiction. 12 he was the scientific editor and reviewed 13 it. he said any smoker can quit. 60 million 14 people have quit smoking. ninety percent of the 15 people who quit did it without any help. 16 you know, gum was available. nicotine gum 17 was available. and i suppose if mr. marotta 18 really wanted to quit, he would have at least 19 tried it. and if mr. marotta really wanted to 20 quit, he would have taken five minutes and saw 21 his doctor and asked for help. 22 we know he did not do any of those things. 23 that is not an excuse. ninety percent of these 24 people, 60 million people did it without any 25 help of any kind, including those two pack a 2701 1 day smokers. 2 dr. benowitz, he wrote the surgeon 3 general's report on addiction which said, even 4 if a smoker is addicted, it does not mean he 5 could not quit. 6 the government says that the people who do 7 quit, are they less addicted, is that the 8 reason that they quit and the addicted people 9 cannot? no, it is not true. 10 the people continue to smoke, they are not 11 more addicted than those who stop. it is not 12 addiction. it is the people who make the choice 13 to quit. 14 now, what about that choice? does 15 nicotine stop it? dr. benowitz, done more 16 nicotine research than anyone in the world 17 says, nothing that nicotine does prevents a 18 smoker from understanding that cigarette causes 19 disease. it does not affect your thinking. it 20 does not affect your mental abilities and it 21 definitely does not prevent you from 22 understanding all of the warnings, all of the 23 warnings that mr. marotta received. 24 he said that within a few weeks of 25 quitting, the number of receptors in the brain 2702 1 are normal and within days or up to a couple of 2 weeks, withdrawal symptoms, like irritability 3 are gone. 4 sure, we know mr. marotta reported that he 5 was irritable, we know he told people that. 6 someone said he was uncomfortable. someone 7 said he was frustrated. it goes away in a few 8 days and that is the plaintiff's expert. we 9 called him to the stand, but he was the 10 plaintiff's expert. 11 this is what the american cancer society 12 and dr. benowitz said are correct. "do you 13 have what it takes to stop smoking?" three 14 questions and think about whether mr. marotta 15 could answer these. "do you want to stop 16 smoking?" they say, well, he did. 17 "are you willing to make some changes in 18 your routine?" they say, well, he did. 19 "are you willing to put up with some 20 uneasy moments after stopping? 21 "if you answer yes to all three questions, 22 you can stop smoking." 23 and dr. benowitz who wrote the surgeon 24 general's report says that is true, that is true. 25 those three questions. 2703 1 now, you heard the evidence, mr. marotta 2 was not willing to put up with some of the 3 uneasy moments. he did not like the 4 irritability and the frustration and, after a 5 few hours, he picked up his cigarette again and 6 then he would wait another year and he would quit for a 7 couple of hours, and then he would wait for lent or 8 new year's. 9 all of those days in between, he would do 10 nothing to try to quit smoking. that is what 11 his family members said, a couple of times a 12 year. 13 dr. benowitz said there is two keys to 14 quitting. motivation, it is obvious. if you are 15 not motivated, you cannot quit. persistence 16 means you have to make a serious effort and you 17 need to be persistent. 18 you do not take a year off, like 19 mr. marotta did. 20 now, was he really motivated to quit? 21 here is what his son said. never really tried. 22 i asked him that. he said, oh, he tried and 23 then i had to pull out his sworn testimony from 24 before the trial -- sworn testimony that the 25 plaintiff said that he was reading during this 2704 1 trial, and his sworn testimony was that his 2 father never really tried. 3 i asked him, you think your father was 4 motivated? he said he did not know. 5 now he is suing and you found out that 6 they are suing for $27 million. and the lead 7 plaintiff says, under oath, that his father 8 never really tried and that he does not even 9 know if his father was motivated to quit, and 10 he wants to be a millionaire nine times over 11 for the choice that he is now second guessing. 12 marie, mr. marotta's wife, said that they 13 stopped for a few hours for lent and new year's 14 and that that was stupid. and she said it was 15 just something we did. it was not a plan like 16 you would make a diet plan and you would stick to it. 17 it was just something that they did every year 18 and that they knew they really were not going to 19 quit. that is why she called it stupid. 20 now, ask yourself, what did mr. marotta do 21 the other 364 days of the year or the other 363 22 days of the year? there is not any testimony 23 that he made any effort to cut down on his 24 smoking or to even try to quit. once a year, 25 at lent or new year's, for a few hours. 2705 1 his partner, mr. denunzio said he did not 2 know if he was motivated or he wanted to quit. 3 these are the people who loved him. these are 4 the people who knew him best. it is not some 5 tobacco company doctor. these are the people 6 who knew him. these are the people that you 7 could trust to tell the truth about him. 8 they did not even know if he was motivated. 9 in fact, andrea bacener, the youngest daughter, 10 took the stand and said -- she was 17 when her 11 father died. in all that time, she said she 12 never, never saw her father try to quit 13 smoking. 14 pretty startling when you consider the 15 claims that they were making in the beginning 16 of this case and how her testimony contradicts 17 that of her brother, phil, and contradicts that 18 of the testimony of her sister, jill. 19 andrea said she never saw her father try 20 to quit. 21 well, why did not he try to quit or why 22 was not he motivated? well, he lived for the 23 moment and we know, everyone agrees, that he 24 told his partner, "do not worry, by the time i 25 get lung cancer, i'll be 80 years old." 2706 1 he knew the risk of lung cancer. he 2 was not relying on something that he never saw, 3 on all of the things that dr. proctor said 4 were not relevant. he was not relying on that. 5 he knew. 6 well, how persistent were these efforts. 7 i mean, dr. benowitz said the scientific 8 definition of a serious attempt to quit smoking 9 is 24 hours. 10 we know that he never made any effort 11 until 1977. remember this chart. i showed it 12 to dr. difranza. 1959, first cigarette. 13 1977, the year daughter andrea is born. 14 his wife testified that the very first time he 15 ever made any effort to stop smoking was down 16 here around 1977. 17 and i showed this to dr. difranza. 18 remember how dr. difranza and i disagreed on 19 almost every part of the facts. he actually 20 claimed the daughters lived with mr. marotta 21 after they were divorced and he was dead wrong. 22 he actually claimed that mr. marotta and 23 his wife tried to quit together after the 24 1980's. we had to show him the testimony. he 25 was wrong again. 2707 1 but what he agreed with is that this is 2 true. all of these years, from '59 to '77, 3 thousands and thousands of days, mr. marotta 4 made no effort to quit smoking. 5 and after that, he stopped a few hours a 6 year, less than once a year in the '80s. 7 i asked dr. difranza -- all of us make new 8 year's resolutions and a lot of people, it is a 9 diet, i'm going to go on a diet, or maybe the 10 spouse says, honey, i think you need to lose a 11 few pounds and the spouse says, sure, i will. 12 use your common sense. if someone went on 13 a diet for a couple of hours new year's morning 14 and does not diet for the rest of the year, 15 would any of us say that person was making a 16 serious commitment to lose weight? 17 if you get on the treadmill or if a friend 18 of yours gets on the treadmill one day out of 19 the year for a short period of time, the other 20 364 days does not exercise, would anyone say 21 that they were making a serious commitment to 22 exercise? 23 would any of you say that they really 24 wanted to lose weight or that they really 25 wanted to exercise? but that is what 2708 1 mr. marotta was doing. 2 but that was his choice. i'm not second 3 guessing him and neither should you, because 4 the evidence does not second guess him. 5 this is what the people who loved him 6 actually said under oath: a couple of times a 7 year, once a year, a few hours a year. the 8 rest of the time, no effort at all. never told 9 a doctor that he wanted to quit. never asked 10 for help. 11 the people who knew him the most did not 12 even know if he was motivated. 13 that is what his ex-wife said. we tried to 14 quit a couple of times. never went further 15 than a few hours. it was stupid. she said it 16 was not a real plan. she said they knew they 17 would be smoking shortly thereafter. 18 now, in the end, did you see any evidence 19 that mr. marotta is different than all the 20 60 million people who quit or all of the heavy 21 smokers who quit? because this includes 22 everyone, the people that start at 12, the 23 people that start at 15, the people that smoke 24 two packs a day. 25 the cigarettes that he was smoking was not 2709 1 more addictive. there was not any evidence that 2 there was something in his brain. certainly he 3 did not see any different advertising. we know 4 he did not see any tobacco company statements, 5 period. their own experts say he did not rely 6 on anything the tobacco company said. 7 did he smoke more than the smokers that 8 quit? we saw the evidence, millions of the 9 heavy smokers were quitting. 10 what his partner says is he lived in the 11 moment. he did not get serious about quitting. 12 his own son said, under oath, when i showed him 13 his testimony, he never really tried. 14 you have to weigh that evidence and decide 15 whether he should be responsible, like the 16 plaintiffs say, for his own choice to continue 17 smoking and to not try to quit. 18 we know you can, if you make the decision. 19 look what the surgeon general said, no one can 20 make you quit and no one can make mr. marotta 21 quit. no one could do it for him. 22 but the surgeon general says that, even if 23 cigarette smoking is addictive, the individual 24 is still responsible. look -- this is surgeon 25 general koop, look what he says: "the 2710 1 individual smoker -- even though cigarette 2 smoking is addictive, it is the individual 3 smoker has to decide whether or not to continue 4 that behavior." 5 they make fun of the common sense notion 6 that smoking is a choice. how can they? it is 7 a legal product that people can choose to 8 smoke. we have a right to sell it. they have 9 a right to make that choice. 10 and 60 million people choose to quit. 11 they are now second guessing the decisions of 12 this smoker and saying that they should each 13 get a 9 million-dollar check because of what 14 their father -- and i understand. everyone in 15 this room is going to face the tragedy of a 16 loved one dying, maybe all of us already have. 17 and we all have sympathy. no one does not have 18 sympathy for mr. marotta and for his sisters. 19 but ask yourself, why do they get 20 $9 million because of a decision that the 21 surgeon general says the smoker is responsible 22 for. 23 dr. benowitz wrote that report. he wrote 24 the surgeon general's report. he said, smoking 25 does not cause a smoker to lose the ability to 2711 1 be responsible for their own actions. 2 and they can say, you are a bunch of liars. 3 it is a bunch of conspiracy. it is fraudulent, 4 et cetera. 5 but you know the truth from his own loved 6 ones, that he knew from back when he was a 7 teenager it could cause cancer. from his own 8 experts, that nothing a tobacco company said 9 influenced him. 10 we know from their own experts that 11 smokers are still responsible and we know from 12 their own position in this case, he could have 13 quit smoking. he could have avoided his 14 cancer. that is why they say he is responsible 15 for causing it and that is what judge tuter will 16 instruct you. 17 your honor? 18 the court: you can keep going. 19 mr. belasic: dr. koop, they showed his 20 videotapes from back in the '80s and the '90s. 21 here is what he said in the 2000s. 22 "ultimately the smoker, you are the one that 23 has control over your behavior. we know the 24 cigarette will not light itself. no matter how 25 much you have smoked, the choice is always 2712 1 yours." 2 you know, he did not say if you smoke two 3 packs a day, you are not responsible for your 4 behavior, like their expert did. the surgeon 5 general says, "no matter how much you light up, 6 the choice is always yours." 7 and for those reasons, you should find no 8 on question one. none of his doctors reached 9 the conclusion that their paid experts say. 10 the death certificate did not find it. they 11 told you that dr. goscin found it and now we 12 know that that just was not true. 13 you should answer no. addiction was not 14 causing this cancer. addiction was not forcing 15 him to have no choice. 16 he was not tied to the wheel of a car with 17 no brakes. he was not hurdling down a highway 18 with no ability to stop the car, like every 19 movie we have all seen. 20 every smoker, according to the surgeon 21 general, every smoker, according to the man who 22 wrote the surgeon general, has the 23 responsibility and the ability to choose to 24 quit. he was not in a runaway car. he could 25 get off the highway. he could stop. 2713 1 now, they talked about negligence. well, 2 we already know, from their own experts and 3 from the testimony of all his loved ones, that 4 he did not rely on anything a tobacco company 5 said. 6 that is what dr. difranza admitted. that is 7 what dr. proctor admitted. so nothing a 8 tobacco company said caused his death. 9 what is the negligence? well, r.j. 10 reynolds sold cigarettes that caused cancer, 11 but you cannot find -- judge tuter's instructed 12 you, that you cannot find liability based on 13 the fact that smoking is dangerous. 14 r.j. reynolds agrees, smoking can cause 15 lung cancer. smoking can cause those diseases. 16 the government knows that, society knows that, 17 and, yet, cigarettes are still a legal product. 18 and judge tuter instructs you, you cannot 19 hold the tobacco companies liable for lawful 20 activity. 21 well, what is the negligence? what is the 22 negligence? 23 mr. alvarez: objection, judge, engle. 24 the court: overruled. 25 mr. belasic: mr. alvarez did not give a 2714 1 specific example of negligence. he kept 2 talking about the same thing. you said 3 something that was misleading. that is what he 4 said. 5 but we already know, his experts already 6 said he did not rely on anything a tobacco 7 company said, and his best friends and the 8 people that loved him say that he knew, as a 9 teenager, it could cause cancer. he saw his 10 own parents die, and he did not try to quit 11 smoking. 12 what is the negligence? is there any 13 connection between the advertising? we know 14 that is not true. is there something that a 15 tobacco company -- that some tobacco could have 16 done that was not advertising or that was not a 17 statement? where is it? 18 sure, they could go out of business, and i 19 think that is the suggestion of dr. proctor. 20 he is, like, well, do not sell or take all the 21 nicotine out. 22 look at judge tuter's instruction. it is 23 legal to sell cigarettes, even though they have 24 all the nicotine that is in the plant. well, 25 dr. benowitz, their expert, admits, actually, 2715 1 when they make the cigarette, there is actually 2 less nicotine than it is in the plant. 3 you cannot find negligence on that. they 4 did not make a connection between these engle 5 findings. i mean -- sometimes i envy the 6 plaintiff's lawyers. it would be great to come 7 in and say, hey, another court found these 8 things, and you can put up all those statements 9 and they can make you mad. 10 but, in the end, what they have to prove 11 is that something in the engle findings, some 12 of that conduct actually was the legal cause, 13 the reason that mr. marotta died. and nothing 14 that the tobacco company said had an affect. 15 their own experts admitted that. 16 we know advertising did not. their own 17 experts admitted it, and they have not shown an 18 act of negligence that, but for, that if it 19 would not have happened, he would not have gotten 20 cancer, that he would have suddenly quit and 21 avoided it. 22 they never specified that. it was a 23 failure of proof, and you have to find no. 24 well, the other question is were the 25 defective and dangerous cigarettes, were the 2716 1 cigarettes, the defect, a legal cause of his 2 lung cancer? 3 well, they brought dr. proctor. he is not 4 an expert on cigarette defects. he is a history 5 professor, but they brought him to talk about 6 that. and he said no cigarette is safe. 7 you cannot light tobacco on fire or any 8 other plant and suck smoke into your lungs 9 without exposing yourself to the chemicals that 10 are in the smoke. he said you cannot make a 11 safe cigarette. 12 where did they show that it is the 13 defective product that caused it? what defect? 14 dr. proctor said there were ingredients, 15 he talked about ingredients, and he admitted, 16 i'm not claiming that any special ingredient 17 caused his cancer. he says he does not know. 18 he is not claiming that winstons are more 19 dangerous than any other cigarette. there is no 20 evidence, in this case, that winstons are any 21 more dangerous than the thousands of other 22 brands that 50 million americans continue to 23 smoke because the government says they have a 24 right to. there is no evidence of that. 25 where is the connection to mr. marotta? 2717 1 if you ask yourselves right off the bat, how 2 did the defect cause the cancer, and you know 3 you cannot find -- judge tuter tells you -- you 4 cannot find the companies liable just for 5 selling ordinary cigarettes. 6 ask yourself, what is this defect? what 7 was the evidence? was there an expert that 8 connected the engle finding on defect to the 9 smoker? 10 and, of course, that assumes that his 11 smoking was caused by cancer in the first 12 place, and we know all of the reasons why they 13 have failed to prove that. 14 so you should check no on number four. 15 your honor, can i ask my remaining time? 16 the court: you still have 30 minutes. 17 mr. belasic: okay. the next question is 18 question five, and that is, what was the 19 percentage of fault? 20 now, as mr. alvarez correctly explained, 21 you find no on these questions, you are not even 22 going to reach this issue, not going to reach 23 this issue, and based on what we discussed and 24 the sworn testimony from their experts, not 25 ours, from their experts, and from the loved 2718 1 ones, the people that knew him and cared about 2 him. 3 we did not bring in tobacco company hired 4 guns to say, we found something out about what 5 he knew. these were his family, the people 6 that loved him. they are the ones that confirm 7 our story. so you should not even be reaching 8 this issue. 9 but if you do, let us talk about it. they 10 talk about comparative fault, and mr. alvarez 11 says this is the story of a 12-year-old against 12 a giant corporation. well, no, it is not, 13 ladies and gentlemen. 14 he did not smoke and stop when he was 12. 15 he smoked for 30 years. he made decisions as 16 an adult. and he unquestionably made 17 decisions, when he knew, even when he was in 18 school, that it could cause cancer. 19 they want to act like you take one 20 cigarette at 12, and you are never again 21 responsible for your smoking. and, yet, they 22 said -- i mean, i thought they promised you in 23 opening, we are taking responsibility. he was a 24 legal cause of his own injury. 25 i mean, imagine if you applied this 2719 1 standard to drinking. i suppose some of us in 2 this courtroom had a beer before the age of 18. 3 i suppose some of us in this courtroom, you 4 know, had a drink of liquor behind the junior 5 high before the age of 18. 6 would anyone seriously claim that, from 7 that moment on, you now avoid all 8 responsibility, you are no longer at fault 9 because you were not 18? that raises another 10 issue. 11 when he started smoking in new york, it 12 was a crime to sell cigarettes or furnish them 13 to a minor. dr. proctor agreed. the legal age 14 was 18, and, yet, he smoked anyway. 15 and now they are trying to say he does not 16 have any responsibility or what, he only has 17 ten percent. how on earth did they come up with 18 that number? 19 well, he only has ten percent because his 20 first cigarette was at a certain age. so i 21 guess when he was 18 years old, or 21 or 25, he 22 had no responsibility. that is their theory. 23 and all i can ask is that you look at all 24 the evidence from the people who loved him, and 25 that you make a fair and open-minded decision 2720 1 based on that evidence, not what some lawyer 2 says. 3 all throughout school, "cancer sticks", 4 "nicotine fit", his best friend said he would 5 have known those terms. he knew smoking caused 6 cancer when he was a teenager. 7 the surgeon general's report, these pack 8 warnings, they came out when he was in school 9 or right after school. then he sees his 10 parents die, and he does not even try to quit. 11 he does not even try to quit. 12 he waits until his daughter is born in 13 1977, and that is -- dr. proctor admitted that 14 that kind of personal tragedy is one of the 15 most potent sources of awareness of the risk. 16 and dr. difranza, their expert, admitted 17 there is no doubt that, by the time his parents 18 died, he believed smoking could cause lung 19 cancer, and he did not even try to quit then. 20 i guess he waited until the next new 21 year's, according to his wife. he quit for a 22 couple of hours, and she says, at one in the 23 morning, we are smoking again. 24 how can he have only ten percent 25 responsibility when, in 1966, every single day, 2721 1 every single 10, 15, 20-minute period, he is 2 seeing the health warning? is he trying to 3 quit in '66? no. 4 his wife says almost 20 years, he makes no 5 effort whatsoever to quit. that is her 6 testimony. 7 in 1970, the warning is even stronger and, 8 again, he makes no effort, according to his 9 wife. 10 even in '85, when it says smoking causes 11 lung cancer, no effort to quit smoking. his 12 partner, denunzio, his partner, pinto, say he 13 quit less than once a year. those were the men 14 who lived with him for ten straight years. he 15 quit less than once a year. 16 now, when they take responsibility and 17 they tell you it was his actions, his failure 18 to make sufficient efforts to quit that caused 19 his death, it does not mean that he is ten percent 20 responsible. 21 because, according to their theory, he was 22 capable of quitting. it is not a percentage 23 thing. you know, if two cars crash and both 24 people are looking out the window, both people 25 are on cell phones or, god forbid, there is a 2722 1 three-car pileup, sure, there is a lot of shared 2 responsibility. not everyone is responsible. 3 those kinds of accidents, where they have 4 multiple causes, that is not an all or nothing. 5 but this case is a simple decision. could he 6 quit or not? 7 the plaintiffs say, when they accept 8 responsibility, that he could have quit, and 9 that is a reason that he caused his own cancer. 10 this is not like those car crashes. either 11 he could quit or he did not. mr. alvarez said 12 in opening, everyone can quit smoking, and 13 that is why we take personal responsibility. 14 you hold him to that promise. you hold 15 mr. marotta to his testimony, that his father 16 was responsible, and review the surgeon 17 general's evidence, that everyone can quit 18 smoking. 19 they say, well, he is not responsible 20 because he tried so hard. and dr. difranza 21 says, there was not anything else he could do. 22 all i ask you to do is review that 23 testimony in your mind. the people that loved 24 him said he would fluff me off, he would 25 placate me. that is what his partner says. 2723 1 marie says it was stupid. his son says he 2 never really tried. 3 we are not writing up that evidence. those 4 are the people that knew him, and that is what 5 they say under oath. 6 the same testimony that tells you that 7 addiction was not the cause of his cancer, even 8 if he was addicted, pick whatever definition 9 you want, you find he was addicted, the same 10 evidence that you reviewed that says addiction 11 really was not the cause, his wife, you 12 should not find a percentage of fault here. 13 it is an all or nothing question. either 14 he could quit or he did not. if he could not 15 quit, then they mislead you from the beginning 16 with this testimony. if he could quit, then 17 the surgeon general says the smoker is 18 responsible. 19 notice the surgeon general did not say, 20 because of addiction, the tobacco company is 21 responsible. he said the smoker has to make 22 the choice. 23 dr. benowitz, the leading expert in the 24 world on this, says the smoker is responsible. 25 they are the only ones who can quit. 2724 1 no one from r.j. reynolds could fly to his 2 house, take all the cigarettes out of his house 3 and force him to quit. his own wife could not 4 force him to quit. his partners who loved him 5 could not force him to quit. 6 he had to choose and he had to do more 7 than just a couple of hours a year. he had to 8 try more than one day out of 365. 9 now, on question ten, that is damages. 10 you have probably waited throughout the trial to 11 wonder what are they suing for. you did not 12 hear it in opening and, obviously, phil, jr. 13 and his sisters did not say how much money they 14 wanted, and now we get the answer. 15 $9 million apiece. there is no evidence, 16 obviously, in this case, that each of these 17 children deserves to be a millionaire nine 18 times over, because of the choices that they 19 now second guess, the choices that make all of 20 us have sympathy for them. 21 but there is no evidence supporting the 22 9 million. you have got an arbitrary number 23 pulled out. the lawyer tells you a number. 24 there is no basis. does not explain it at all. 25 immediately says, you can reject it, you could 2725 1 go lower, you could go even higher. 2 but why on earth, why 27 million? what is 3 this magic number that is being pulled out of a 4 hat here? 5 it defies common sense that the children, 6 no matter how much they love their father, no 7 matter how much they miss him and, of course, 8 they do, we did not dispute that, it defies 9 common sense that they get to be millionaires 10 nine times over for their father's choices, 11 especially given the testimony that they, 12 themselves, said about whether their father was 13 making serious efforts to quit. 14 now, they are not asking for medical 15 expenses here or even funeral expenses. 16 they are not claiming economic damages. they are 17 not saying that their father was giving them 18 money. it was the other way around. phil, jr. 19 was paying his father rent. 20 they are not claiming lost services, that 21 he was providing anything, he was providing 22 some sort of service. 23 what they are asking for is their own pain 24 and suffering and companionship, and i 25 understand that, but where is the basis for 2726 1 $9 million? i submit to you it defies common 2 sense. they have never laid any basis for this. 3 now, the very last question that you are 4 going to answer is punitive damages. 5 your honor, could i ask how much time i 6 have left? 7 the court: you still have 15 minutes. 8 mr. belasic: 15 minutes? 9 the court: yes. 10 mr. belasic: this is the last question 11 you are going to answer: is the plaintiff 12 entitled to punitive damages under the 13 circumstances of this case? 14 what are punitive damages? well, they can 15 only go the plaintiff, phil marotta, and to his 16 sisters. they are not going to go to these 17 organizations. they are not going to be awarded 18 to a public health agency or a stop smoking 19 clinic. they are not going to anyone else in 20 the class. 21 so they want $9 million each. and then if 22 you decide punitives, they are going to ask you 23 for more. 24 we will have to wait to find out. i do not 25 think you should even get there. but 2727 1 $9 million, they say, is not enough, 9 million 2 apiece. they want more. 3 well, what would happen if we pay this? i 4 mean, is it necessary? is it necessary? you 5 have to decide, is it necessary to deter future 6 bad acts, to deter something, is it necessary 7 to punish? 8 well, paying that money is not going to 9 help anyone stop smoking. it is not going to 10 improve public health. it certainly will not make 11 cigarettes safer. 12 and when they talk about, well, all these 13 bad things the tobacco company did, and they 14 do not connect them to mr. marotta, remember 15 what the judge tells you, those findings do not 16 establish that the plaintiff is entitled to 17 punitive damages. 18 i think it is page 9, but you will see the 19 instructions on punitive damages and the 20 instructions on these engle findings. 21 and judge tuter commands you that, under 22 the law, you cannot base punitive damages on 23 the findings by that other jury. 24 this evidence has to be clear and 25 convincing. their burden of proof on punitives 2728 1 is even greater, and it has to be intentional, 2 that they intentionally did something to kill 3 phil marotta. 4 why would they want to kill their own 5 customers? does it make sense? you cannot 6 award punitive damages for harm to others. all 7 of this talk about youth marketing from 1927, i 8 do not know who they are talking about. 9 i do not know who they are talking about 10 when they show ads for lucy, desi and all the 11 ads that their expert admitted, the plaintiff 12 never even saw or that mr. marotta never even 13 saw. 14 they are trying to get you, in their 15 argument, to say, well, what about all these 16 other smokers. but the judge is going to 17 command you, and already has instructed you, 18 you cannot award any punitive damages for harm 19 to others. 20 it is only evidence that actually shows 21 that it harmed the plaintiff. but what is that 22 evidence? their experts have already agreed, 23 nothing the tobacco companies said was relied 24 upon by mr. marotta, either before 1982 or 25 after. 2729 1 their experts already said you cannot make 2 a safe cigarette, and admitted that r.j. 3 reynolds tried to. he said they spent up to a 4 billion dollars to try to make a cigarette that 5 would not burn tobacco. he said they worked 6 with the national cancer institute to try to 7 make safer cigarettes. 8 would a company that was trying to kill 9 its customers intentionally do that? would 10 they bet the company on a safe cigarette? 11 would they go to the labs and work with the 12 government to redesign? 13 that is the instruction that says the 14 findings are not relevant to punitives. 15 now, the purpose of punitives, and you will 16 see in the instruction, one of the purposes is 17 to deter future misconduct. you have to 18 decide: is there something reynolds does in 19 the future, that if we award a whole boatload 20 of money on top of the 27 million that they are 21 asking for, that will change the world, change 22 the way r.j. reynolds will act? 23 consider this. it is a different world 24 now. r.j. reynolds agrees that smoking causes 25 cancer, agrees that it is addictive. nobody 2730 1 disputes that. 2 there are not any more statements. cti, 3 tirc, ti, they did not show you anything. died 4 off in the '90s. no one is making those 5 statements. it is a different world. 6 we have got a warning right on the pack that 7 says lung cancer. the advertising is 8 restricted. you know, this kind of agreement 9 to talk about causation or addiction, using 10 these words, it would not even be possible 11 today. 12 all of the companies have agreed that 13 smoking causes these diseases. and, most 14 importantly, why there is no need to award 15 punitives to deter is -- the tobacco industry 16 is regulated like a utility. they are regulated 17 like the electric company, and they are 18 regulated by the fda. 19 "the food & drug administration now has 20 the authority to regulate the manufacturing, 21 marketing and distribution." 22 i got to ask you a simple question. what 23 else is there? the fda controls the 24 manufacturing, how the product is manufactured. 25 the fda controls marketing. that means 2731 1 advertising, what you tell consumers. 2 the fda controls the distribution, how the 3 cigarettes are distributed. from the beginning 4 of the process, when they make it, to the very 5 end of the process when it hits the store, the 6 fda has authority. 7 it is a different world. the government 8 controls the actions, and no amount of money, 9 whether they ask for another 50 million in 10 punitives or whether they just want their 11 9 million each, no amount of money is going to 12 change that. 13 the government is in control of the 14 tobacco companies right now. look what it says 15 in the most recent surgeon general's report. 16 the fda could also establish product standards 17 for nicotine yields. 18 in other words, the government now 19 actually has the legal authority to say how 20 much nicotine is in the smoke. that is what 21 they call nicotine yield. 22 now, no amount of money paid to 23 mr. marotta's children can equal the regulation 24 and the control and the safety measures that 25 are already in effect. the government controls 2732 1 what is in the cigarette. 2 they say, if we look again, "the fda could 3 also reduce or eliminate other constituents." 4 and i asked dr. proctor about this. you know, 5 the fda is in charge of all the ingredients 6 now. they can make any ruling they want. they 7 can say, hey, if you get vanilla as a flavor, 8 you take it out. if you got that licorice that 9 he was talking about that makes some cigarettes 10 taste better, you can take it out. 11 he agreed. they have absolute authority 12 over that. they can take it out if they make a 13 finding that it is dangerous. 14 and then i asked him, you know what, 15 they have never done it. and he agreed. 16 the government is in control of the 17 ingredients in cigarettes now. all that stuff 18 that you heard about that was so bad, and the 19 government has not said, change the way you make 20 your cigarettes at all. 21 there is no evidence that the fda has said 22 take anything out, do not use an additive, but 23 they could if they would. and they are now 24 regulating the tobacco companies like they 25 would the electric company. 2733 1 not just reduce, but also eliminate. they 2 can say take anything out they want to. 3 the court: nine minutes, mr. belasic. 4 mr. belasic: now, you heard about this 5 conspiracy, and it seems, at this point, and 6 i'll go over it, but it is a little silly to 7 claim that, at a meeting in a hotel before 8 mr. marotta ever started smoking, somehow 9 influenced him, when we know, from their own 10 experts, that mr. marotta did not rely on 11 anything. dr. difranza and dr. proctor told 12 you that. 13 and we know, from the family members, that 14 he did not rely on anything. 15 i asked dr. proctor, i said, you got any 16 proof that this frank statement actually 17 tricked smokers? has there ever been a survey? 18 he said, well, no. 19 i said, well, what about the one that hill 20 & knowlton did? what about the one that the 21 people that put out the frank statement did? 22 he said, he did know that. 23 and what they found was that the frank 24 statement scared people into cutting down, and, 25 in some cases, stopping their use of tobacco 2734 1 entirely. 2 and they put it up on the board, and 3 they will say it is horrible. they want to get 4 you mad. mr. marotta never read it, and their 5 expert agrees the evidence is that it scared 6 people. 7 he also admitted that the surgeon general 8 found that way back when there was some health 9 claims, and he said the health claims stopped 10 in the mid '50s, and i thought that was 11 interesting when dr. proctor said these health 12 claims stopped in the mid '50s, because that 13 was before mr. marotta even started smoking. 14 when he was showing you the more doctors 15 smoke camels, he said those were advertisements 16 from the '30s and '40s. and i asked him, but 17 you knew, coming in, that those ads were for a 18 brand that he did not smoke, those ads were 19 before he started smoking. 20 and i asked him, you knew, when you came 21 in, that those ads were before he was even 22 born. and he just said, yeah, i knew that, but 23 it is just to show some general things. 24 then we find out that it is the lawyers 25 that picked those ads, not dr. proctor. 2735 1 if you are going to claim that this massive 2 conspiracy changed the landscape of america, 3 you have a legal burden to prove that somebody 4 relied on it, in this case, mr. marotta. we 5 know he did not. their experts admit it. the 6 family members admit it. 7 but look what the public thought. did 8 anyone in the public rely? 9 only 3 percent -- this is the year he 10 started smoking, 1959. they did a roper 11 survey, one of the largest survey groups in the 12 country. 13 only 3 percent of the people said they would 14 be most apt to believe the tobacco industry 15 council. the public was not looking for the 16 tobacco companies to tell them whether it was 17 safe to smoke or not. 18 what they were believing was the american 19 cancer society, the american medical 20 association, the u.s. department of health. 21 you bring a fraud case -- and the 22 instructions judge tuter will give you -- you 23 have to prove that it has some affect. 24 their own expert says it did not. their 25 own expert says they did not believe it. 2736 1 here is the 1970 roper study. would you 2 believe the tobacco companies? 3 percent. 3 now, we know that mr. marotta is not even in 4 that 3 percent. 5 but how effective, how horrible is a 6 conspiracy when the amount of sales, the number 7 of people who smoke plummeted. remember the 8 chart? dr. proctor put up the chart. 9 it starts way up here. he says, then the 10 conspiracy begins. and what happens? more 11 people smoke? no. it drops down to, he said, 12 the lowest level since the 1930s. 13 so during this whole conspiracy, they talk 14 about, right now in america, we have a lower 15 percentage of people smoking than at any time 16 since the 1930s, 80 years ago, almost a century 17 ago. 18 one of the reasons is, as dr. proctor 19 admitted, nobody was listening to the tobacco 20 companies. and the surgeon general said that 21 when they made health claims, all it did was 22 scare people more. 23 now, are cigarettes more addictive? they 24 did not put any proof. they put a surgeon 25 general's report in that said that it had the 2737 1 potential to. let us look at the real evidence 2 about smokers. 3 in summary, there is little evidence to 4 suggest that there is an increasing level of 5 addiction. now, should we be worried that 6 people today are more addicted, that the 7 cigarettes are somehow different? 8 national cancer institute says, no, 9 there is little evidence the new generation of 10 young smokers is more heavily addicted or even 11 less likely to quit. 12 in fact, look what they say below. "the 13 higher percentage of occasional smokers is a 14 change consistent with less, rather than more 15 addiction." 16 so you go to real life and see how people 17 are smoking today, and the government, not a 18 tobacco company, says cigarettes are less 19 addictive today. 20 i covered this. dr. proctor did not say 21 there was some defect that you could have 22 removed or that you were negligent in not 23 changing the cigarette, and he specifically 24 said that he was not going to claim that 25 anything in winstons or the brands that 2738 1 mr. marotta smoked caused his injury. 2 so what we do know is that when the 3 surgeon general would look at things like 4 filters, he would actually look at the death 5 rates. they would actually look at the 6 mortality tables, that the government said, 7 here's how many people smoked, here's the 8 nonsmokers. 9 they would look and they would see, are 10 the people who are smoking filters, are they 11 dying at a higher rate or a lower rate? 12 so this was not some speculation. this was 13 the government is actually looking at, the 14 number of deaths. and the government 15 repeatedly said that, when they did that, the 16 people who smoked filters had a lower rate of 17 lung cancer. 18 today's filters produce lower rates of 19 lung cancer. 1989, studies show smoking 20 filtered, lower tar cigarettes, reduces the 21 risk of lung cancer. 22 1990, a lower risk of lung cancer for 23 smokers of filtered cigarettes. 24 so what they do is they show some papers 25 from some ad guys who say, hey, let us talk 2739 1 about filtration. filtration is a good way to 2 sell the cigarettes. but do they actually tell 3 you what the surgeon general was out there 4 measuring? 5 and when they say, well, slapping a filter 6 on a cigarette is bad. look what dr. proctor 7 said. i said, really, is anyone in the country 8 saying you should rip the filter off? that is 9 the best way to smoke. did the surgeon general 10 say take the filter off? 11 this is what the surgeon general was 12 saying: how is this reprehensible, discussing 13 the kind of behavior that mr. alvarez, he 14 could not believe, how is this the kind of 15 behavior that entitles the marottas to get even 16 more money than the $27 million? 17 the surgeon general looked at the real 18 people who smoke and, at least at the time, 19 they were saying that, when you looked at it, 20 the people that smoked filters died at a lower 21 rate. 22 so why was it reprehensible to sell a 23 cigarette with a filter? they do not say. and, 24 of course, there is no evidence in this case 25 that mr. marotta was saying should i smoke a 2740 1 filter or an unfiltered. there is no evidence 2 that he chose winstons for any ad and, in fact, 3 dr. proctor admitted the winston filter, about 4 taste, "winston tastes good like a cigarette 5 should." 6 it did not say "winston's filter makes it 7 safe like a filter should." they talked about 8 taste. 9 but it does not matter because their own 10 experts agree that advertising had no effect on 11 mr. marotta. 12 dr. proctor admitted that reynolds' 13 president in 1968, managed his employees, to 14 push the work concerning tobacco and health in 15 cooperation with others and prepare a plan to 16 foster a good relationship with the government. 17 look what he says. does he say, if there 18 is a safer cigarette, let us deep six it and try 19 to kill our customers? no. 20 he is directing them, if there is a safer 21 cigarette, let us continue and increase our 22 efforts in this program. please prepare a plan 23 to carry it out. 24 is that a company trying to kill its 25 customers? and their own evidence showed that 2741 1 the companies knew, if they actually could make 2 a cigarette, they could still burn tobacco and 3 be safer. they had a profit motive to do it. 4 dr. proctor admitted they actually worked 5 with the government for about ten years to 6 redesign their cigarettes. 7 could i ask what my remaining time is? 8 the court: about three or four minutes. 9 mr. belasic: okay. 10 there was no dispute on this. i mean, i 11 asked dr. proctor, is not it unusual that a 12 private company that makes a legal product 13 would be called up by the government and they 14 say we want to change the way you make your 15 profit. there was no law. the government had 16 no legal authority. 17 the tobacco companies had a legal right to 18 say, no, we do not care, we are going to make 19 whatever we want. but they did not do that. 20 dr. proctor agreed, they spent millions of 21 dollars on this program. they went to the 22 government and they worked hand in hand with 23 the government scientists. 24 i was wrong. i asked dr. proctor if it 25 lasted five years. he said it was longer. you 2742 1 can see from the evidence here, it went from 2 1968 to 1977. 3 everyone, the largest tobacco companies 4 worked with the national cancer institute. 5 r.j. reynolds sent the head of r&d to work 6 on it. for ten years, they researched, they 7 made every different kind of cigarette -- and 8 remember what dr. proctor said. they looked at 9 cigarettes where they could try to reduce 10 nicotine to see if that was safer. 11 sometimes people would smoke more and it 12 would be less safe. they looked at cigarettes 13 that would increase nicotine. remember 14 dr. proctor said there was a theory that people 15 smoke for nicotine, give them nicotine but not 16 tar. 17 they looked at all kinds of different 18 ingredients. they looked at different 19 chemicals that maybe could change the way smoke 20 reacts. 21 and dr. proctor agreed they did all of 22 those things. they did that voluntarily with 23 the government. 24 now, is that the way that a company, is 25 that the way that an industry that wants to 2743 1 kill its customers would act? 2 for a while here in this case, you 3 probably thought it was a battle of who could 4 put up the most magazines and newspaper 5 articles. and dr. proctor admitted that there 6 were thousands of reports in magazines and 7 newspapers that said about the risks of 8 smoking. 9 was it really secret? no, it was on the 10 front page. it was in every magazine. that is 11 the newspaper where mr. marotta lived. 12 dr. benowitz said we have known that 13 nicotine has an effect on the body for a 14 hundred years. for a hundred years, we have 15 known it could be difficult to quit. 16 they were warning about addiction a 17 century ago in this very state, the florida 18 department of health. 19 ninety percent of the people, before 20 mr. marotta even picked up a cigarette, had 21 heard that smoking could be a cause of cancer. 22 the surgeon general said that the public 23 had been informed by this mass media coverage. 24 the harvard study says the very year, this is 25 the year that mr. marotta supposedly picked up 2744 1 his first cigarette. 2 95 percent of the high school students had 3 heard, but even down here, the junior high 4 student, ninety percent of them had heard and 5 they are saying it was a secret. 6 when the surgeon general's report came 7 out, there was massive, massive coverage. all 8 of these are in evidence, if you want to look 9 at it, massive coverage. 10 the florida department of health said 11 nearly everyone, nearly all floridians heard 12 about the surgeon general's report. 13 mr. marotta was in high school when that 14 came out. now, am i making this up? how can 15 we say that he knew about it in high school? 16 well, his best friend said that they were using 17 cancer sticks back then and that mr. marotta 18 would have been well aware as far back, he 19 said, as elementary school. that is 20 mr. gelfano. as far back as potentially 21 elementary school they were doing it. 22 but we knew in high school that the cancer 23 scare was known to -- that is mr. marotta. this 24 is his high school yearbook. it references the 25 cancer scare. you can look at his yearbook. 2745 1 it is in evidence. you can look at the pictures 2 of the prom and the people on the basketball 3 team. 4 but it has this page where they make it 5 clear that the cancer scare was being noticed. 6 and here is the priest in his school where 7 you heard the testimony, smoking was 8 prohibited. 9 dr. proctor admitted in poll after poll, 10 that huge majorities of people thought that 11 smoking cigarettes was harmful to their health. 12 but in the end, it does not come down to a 13 survey and it does not come down to statistics. 14 in the end, r.j. reynolds made a legal product 15 that is legal even if it causes cancer, that is 16 legal even if it is addictive, that the judge 17 tells you cannot impose liability merely for 18 its sale. 19 and in the end, mr. marotta chose to smoke 20 it. like millions of people, he made that 21 choice. you have seen he made a different choice 22 when it came to the efforts to quit. that his 23 wife, that his loved ones, that his partners 24 say it was a couple of times a year. his 25 partners say it was not even once a year. 2746 1 none of the evidence permits you to second 2 guess his decisions. you have to evaluate it 3 based on the evidence that you have heard from 4 the people here. 5 everyone agrees, including their two 6 experts that nothing that r.j. reynolds said 7 caused him to die. no one claims that if r.j. 8 reynolds had said something differently, he 9 would have quit like that and avoided his 10 cancer. 11 and the plaintiff told you from the very 12 beginning in this case, and we know it because 13 it is what the surgeon general and the top 14 expert in the world says, everyone could quit 15 smoking. that is alex alvarez in opening saying 16 everyone can quit, so we take responsibility. 17 that is the surgeon general saying that smokers 18 are responsible. that is the man that put all 19 the science together, dr. benowitz, who we had 20 to call to the stand saying that smokers are 21 responsible. 22 it is been a long case. as i told you, 23 much of the reason for it being long is that 24 the evidence did not have anything to do with 25 mr. marotta. 2747 1 i thank you for attention for every one of 2 those eight days and you should answer "no" to 3 the last final question. 4 thank you, again, for everything you have 5 done.
