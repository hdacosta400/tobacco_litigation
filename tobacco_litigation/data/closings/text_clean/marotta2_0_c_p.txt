14 mr. freidin: good morning. on behalf of 15 the marotta family, and certainly our team and 16 everybody, and all the lawyers on both sides, 17 thank you for being here, for your sacrifice. 18 it is not that often that any of us get a chance 19 to participate in the american system of 20 democracy. 21 we do go vote. when we vote for president 22 or whatever it is, we are one of millions of 23 votes, and today you sit as part of the 24 function of this democracy, and i cannot -- i 25 think, at this point, you recognize the 1 importance of this case and the significance of 2 it. 3 this is a case where, ironically, in the 4 last or second to last witness that r.j. 5 reynolds put on, dr. benowitz, it kind of 6 explains to you or demonstrates what we are 7 dealing with here. 8 the witness they put on mentioned that 9 between 400 and 450,000 people die from 10 cigarette smoking lung cancer cases and 11 cigarette smoking per year. 12 that is not to mention the untold misery 13 and illness and costs associated with that. 14 that came from a witness they put on. 15 there is no dispute about that number, but 16 that just tells you what we are dealing with 17 here and how important this is. 18 now, there is plenty of room for emotions 19 ranging from sympathy to anger to passion. i'm 20 going to try to avoid all of that. 21 it is really not something that we want to 22 do. we could, but what we want to do is try to 23 talk to you about the law and the evidence and 24 common sense. that is what really counts, and 25 there is a lot, as they say, that people can get 1 worked up over, but your job is to deal with 2 the law and the evidence and common sense, and 3 that is what i want to address. 4 the first thing that you are going to be 5 asked is whether or not -- you are going to have 6 two questions, and i'll talk about them in some 7 detail, and what i'm going to do is just talk 8 about the first two questions, and mr. alvarez 9 is going to talk about the next nine, so i'm 10 going to be shorter than him. 11 but those two questions really relate to 12 class membership, as you have heard. and class 13 membership is basically whether or not the 14 marottas are entitled to be in the class and 15 whether or not the key in the door opens and 16 they can step in here and have their case heard 17 on the merits. that is what it is about. 18 of course, reynolds' position is that the 19 key does not fit and they should not have their 20 case heard on the merits. it should be stopped 21 right here in the first two questions on class 22 membership. 23 when you think about the class membership 24 issues, roughly, there are two questions. one 25 is whether or not this is a smoking-related 1 illness and whether or not mr. marotta was 2 addicted to smoking. we know nicotine is in 3 there and we know that nicotine is addictive, 4 and we know lung cancer comes from cigarettes. 5 if those two things are true, they are class 6 members. 7 i think class membership probably should 8 be denied to somebody who hardly ever smoked 9 perhaps. should be denied to somebody who has 10 a disease that is not -- i learned a latin term 11 in this case, sine qua non; meaning the 12 defining or most important tobacco-related or 13 cigarette smoking disease known throughout the 14 world, lung cancer. 15 and so we are dealing with a heavy smoker 16 for a lifetime who gets lung cancer, and the 17 question for you first is: does this family 18 belong in the class? are they allowed to come 19 into the courtroom and have this case heard on 20 the merits? 21 and that is what i believe the evidence 22 will show quite, quite powerfully, quite 23 simply, and that is what i want to talk to you 24 about in my time. 25 really, what i want to also start to say, 1 the marottas have a right to be here. that 2 really means that they are a member of the 3 class, and i'm going to talk about that. 4 i think we have one that says, what this 5 is not about. class membership is not about 6 fault, because fault comes in the later 7 questions. 8 that was a lot that the judge read to you 9 and -- but you can see that the fault questions 10 and the comparative fault and whether somebody 11 should have or -- should have done this or 12 should have not done that is later. 13 so class membership is not about fault. 14 it is also not about choice, which you will hear i 15 think r.j. reynolds will say, oh, it is all 16 about choice, but it is not. 17 you will hear from the court or you have 18 heard some of the instructions -- i do not think 19 you have heard the word "choice" in any of the 20 instructions that he gave you. 21 and in particular -- you can talk about 22 choice when you get to the other questions. 23 but in this part, this is a very simple 24 clinical distillation of whether or not the 25 marottas belong in the class and whether 1 they are entitled to their day in court. 2 everybody in america is entitled to their 3 day in court. r.j. reynolds is entitled to be 4 here and say that he is not -- they are not 5 members of the class. 6 however skimpy i think or anyone might 7 think or whatever, everybody is entitled to be 8 in court. so let us see if the keys fit and 9 let us see what the evidence was. 10 you had arguments -- we know he died from 11 lung cancer. there is no dispute about that. 12 but somehow or other, certain things crept into 13 this case. 14 you heard about asbestosis, and i think a 15 reasonable person might think, well, i'm sure 16 when the reynolds' case comes up, we are going 17 to hear more about asbestosis and asbestos, but 18 really there was nothing. dr. shmookler even 19 testified, no, i did not see any asbestos on the 20 slides. 21 you heard about family history. and when 22 you break it down, the only family history is 23 that his parents had lung cancer and they were 24 smokers. 25 so maybe that set the table for this in 1 some way or another, but it is really not 2 relevant. 3 he was an otherwise healthy man. there is 4 no other disease process here. he was 46 and 5 he got lung cancer. 6 but the medical records -- and i'm sure 7 you know you would have heard if he had some 8 other underlying disease process, he had 9 nothing. until this was discovered, he was in 10 good health. 11 now, you hear that -- you will hear, 12 perhaps, it is about a choice, but again, as i 13 said, that comes later. 14 but the main defense on number one is, 15 this is bac. so let us look at, first of all -- 16 when i say choice is not involved, that says -- 17 that talks about legal cause. 18 you can read that over a hundred times. 19 you are not going to see the word "choice" in 20 there. mr. alvarez is going to address that 21 part of this in a little more detail than i am. 22 but i'll just say, there is nothing about 23 choice, and i'm going to come back to that when 24 i get to the addiction question. 25 but it says, "addiction is the legal cause 1 if it directly and in natural continuous 2 sequence produces or contributes substantially 3 to producing the loss, injury, or damage," and 4 there is nothing about someone's choice. 5 so let us go to the next. this is the law. 6 you heard it a few times from the judge. we 7 have to prove our case or our part of our case 8 by the greater weight of the evidence, and 9 that is liking to a seesaw or scales of justice, 10 if you can show that, please. 11 we have to prove 51 percent. you have heard 12 a few times, i think, that we do not have to 13 prove our case beyond a reasonable doubt. 14 that is the criminal thing. we hear it on the 15 csi shows and all that. that is not what a 16 civil case is. 17 it will change in some of the later 18 questions, but i'm not talking about those 19 right now. those scales have to tip one way or 20 another. if they tip even the slightest way in 21 our direction, then we prevail on greater 22 weight of the evidence. 23 the judge will tell you it means the more 24 persuasive and convincing force and effect of 25 the evidence when weighed against the other 1 side's evidence. 2 it means also, and you heard the 3 expression used in the courtroom several times 4 with some of the witnesses, "more likely than 5 not." 6 you can say 51 percent is more likely than 7 not. but, really, it is basically just a 8 feeling that you have, which is a little 9 stronger. 10 i'm going to go through what i think is 11 the evidence that you have seen and talk about 12 how these scales should be balanced. 13 let us start with that question. that is 14 really the question that you are going to be 15 answering, number one: was phil's cancer 16 caused by smoking cigarettes? 17 let us go to the first thing. going in. 18 and these are the things that happened right in 19 front of you. i did not pull that big thing 20 over here because it always gets in my way. 21 but this is what i wrote down when i asked 22 dr. fleiter about, what are the odds going in 23 statistically of which is more likely, and i 24 thought it was clever to bring out the pennies, 25 i do not know. there were only two pennies. 1 and really, i could not cut one in half, so 2 there is one-and-a-half pennies out of a 3 hundred. that is the odds that they are telling 4 you favor them. 5 just on this alone, on these numbers 6 alone, this is way, way, way more than likely, 7 way more than 51 percent. if no one testified, 8 this would be the odds, ninety percent are smoking 9 related and 1.5 percent are bac. those are 10 overwhelming odds that it is not bac. so let us 11 put that on the scale. 12 now, there is somebody who testified in 13 this case that you did not meet. his record is 14 in evidence, dr. goscin. 15 dr. goscin, you may not remember him 16 because he was not here, but he wrote a report, 17 a pathology report when he was taking care 18 of -- looking at these slides and advising the 19 doctors for phil marotta when he came in with a 20 terrible disease. 21 and he wrote down that it was, in essence, 22 the kind of cells that are smoking diseases. 23 there is no dispute about that. 24 at that time, he was advising the doctors 25 and he was advising the family and he was 1 advising phil, who had a fatal disease, what he 2 had, and he wrote down large cell, which is not 3 bac. 4 that is probably, of all the things i can 5 tell you, if we just used that alone and put in 6 no evidence of experts, hired nobody to come 7 in, that alone would be the most compelling 8 single fact, because he had no ax to grind, he 9 had no interest in any of this, has no idea 10 this is occurring. 11 he wrote it in the context of doing the 12 best medical care for this family and for this 13 man and for the doctors who sent him the 14 slides, and that alone. but it gets stronger 15 and stronger. 16 so we felt we should bring in a treating 17 doctor, an oncologist. we brought in 18 dr. villa. 19 dr. villa, if you recall, was harvard 20 medical and had six board-certifications, 21 including oncology and pathology. he actually 22 not only looks at slides but he treats patients 23 with lung cancer, and he said, i'm one hundred percent 24 sure this is smoking related. 25 and i have this which was in his 1 handwriting. i said, would you step down, 2 please, and write the reasons why you believe 3 this is smoking related. and this is his 4 handwriting. i do not have handwriting like 5 this. you have seen what mine looks like. 6 first, the overwhelming smoking history. 7 i think the next thing it says is a superior 8 vena cava syndrome, which is how, classically, 9 smoking tumors present and bac does not. 10 he also said -- and then he also said the 11 presentation, radiation therapy, the way it 12 reacted to radiation therapy, the way it 13 reacted to chemotherapy, the fact that he was 14 gone in six to eight months, very atypical for 15 bac, because the prognosis is much longer. 16 i want to talk about that in a second when 17 we get to that article i was trying to ask 18 dr. shmookler about. 19 and metastasis to the brain, bac does not 20 typically metastasize, and to the bones. 21 so this is dr. villa. now, you can say, 22 okay, what did the oncologist, clinician for 23 reynolds say? i'm trying to remember. 24 well, i think it is because nobody came in. 25 you wonder why would not they bring in somebody 1 to contest that? 2 mr. belasic: objection, your honor. 3 the court: overruled. 4 mr. freidin: he could not find anybody, if 5 they could. 6 so you are being asked to decide this -- we 7 bring in a very highly qualified, harvard 8 educated, six boarded very, very strong 9 witness, who also said he read the slides and 10 he said they were smoking related. 11 then we go to dr. fleiter. dr. fleiter 12 also said, i'm a hundred percent sure -- now, 13 everybody remembers dr. fleiter, because he 14 liked to talk about the animals, this is a 15 giraffe, this is an elephant, this cell is 16 this, and apples. 17 dr. fleiter is one of the most renown lung 18 pathologists in the world. he received slides 19 from all over the world. he writes and edits 20 and reviews journals from the best journals in 21 the world and is considered one of the world's 22 leading experts at one of the leading 23 institutions in lung pathology in which they 24 teach, professor fleiter. 25 he said, i'm one hundred percent sure there is no 1 bac here, none. same thing that dr. villa 2 said. same thing that dr. goscin essentially 3 said. and we start with ninety percent versus 4 1.5 percent. 5 let us put some of that -- i left out 6 probably the most important thing, which is the 7 common sense of this. the smoking history is 8 overwhelming. 9 this is somebody who started at 12 years 10 old and smoked until he was 47, 35 years of 11 smoking, one, one-and-a-half, two, 12 two-and-a-half, three, maybe four, who knows, 13 packs a day, nobody really counted except him. 14 and we heard that people tend to underestimate. 15 but we have two to three packs a day he tells 16 his doctors when he goes in for his final 17 assessment. 18 at this point, we know it is at least two 19 to three packs. that is essentially an 20 overwhelming smoking history with the cancer 21 most highly associated with smoking, lung 22 cancer. 23 that is, by the way, something like 4- to 24 600,000 cigarettes in his lifetime and it is 25 something like 4 to 6 million puffs of nicotine 1 and of tar and the things that come with it. 2 those are staggering numbers. that is what we 3 have on this side of the scale. 4 over here, we have dr. shmookler. you 5 have to wonder a couple of things about 6 dr. shmookler, who has not done anything in 7 lung pathology since he was a general 8 pathologist. he is not written. he is not 9 taught. he is not invited to speak. in the 10 last 13 years, he is not done anything in his 11 field really, and the last time he saw a bac 12 was at least five years ago. 13 and you have to ask the question why 14 dr. shmookler, why not find a lung pathologist. 15 it is odd. how do they reach out to him. it is 16 odd that -- these dates come up in terms of the 17 disclosure versus when he saw the slide. 18 so let me move to the next question 19 because i think we can answer that one yes 20 pretty easily. 21 the next question is: was phil marotta 22 addicted? and i want to go through those, 23 please. let us just -- robert, if you might, 24 let us put those up. 25 again, the charge you are going to get is 1 whether there is a straight path between the 2 smoking and the addiction and his death, and i 3 do not think anyone could make any other 4 argument except nicotine was addictive. he was 5 highly addicted, severely addicted, and you can 6 see the direct chain. 7 let us go to -- and that is the surgeon 8 general's view of it. it is also -- you do not 9 see the word "choice" in either of those 10 diagrams. you see a straight line between 11 nicotine addiction, the changes, and the lung 12 cancer. 13 (at this time, a video was played for the 14 court and taken down to the best of the court 15 reporter's ability:) 16 "we should also give priority to the one 17 addiction, tobacco addiction, that is killing 18 more than 300,000 americans each year." 19 (end of video.) 20 mr. freidin: we have another slide from 21 dr. koop. 22 (at this time, a video was played for the 23 court and taken down to the best of the court 24 reporter's ability:) 25 "what you do say to the tobacco institute 1 which said in a statement today that smoking is 2 a personal choice which can be stopped if and 3 when a person decides to do so? 4 "well, ask the 43 million people who smoke 5 in this country whether they can stop if they 6 want to, and you will find that 85 percent of 7 them say, i would like to stop tomorrow but i 8 cannot. many of them will say, i've tried five 9 times to stop and i cannot. that is addiction." 10 (end of video.) 11 mr. freidin: there is one more. 12 (at this time, a video was played for the 13 court and taken down to the best of the court 14 reporter's ability:) 15 "i would say it is just as addictive as 16 heroin or cocaine." 17 (end of video.) 18 mr. freidin: so that is the surgeon 19 general of the united states based upon 20 scientific evidence. that is the backdrop of 21 this. 22 we start out with, it resembles cocaine 23 and heroin. that is something that surprised 24 me, but that is the surgeon general of the 25 united states. 1 and in this case, we had dr. difranza -- 2 and as far as i'm concerned, dr. benowitz, who 3 they played, who was our expect originally and 4 they decided to play his deposition, they 5 agreed on everything except one point, which 6 i'll get to in a minute, but here is what they 7 agreed on. 8 pretty much everybody agrees that between 9 80 and ninety percent of daily smokers are 10 addicted. pretty much both of them agreed with 11 that. the surgeon general agrees that 12 85 percent are addicted. 13 now we have phil marotta, who is a heavy 14 smoker, and under every single test, the 15 fagerstrom test, the dsm test, we went through 16 all those, every single test, they both 17 agreed -- dr. benowitz did not agree about 18 mr. marotta himself because he did not involve 19 himself with mr. marotta. every one of those 20 criteria are the same. there is no difference. 21 they both agree that it is highly 22 addictive. they both agree it resembles 23 alcohol, heroin, cocaine. they both agree that 24 this is something that is extremely powerful 25 and extremely hard to quit. 1 they both agree that a small percentage 2 can quit -- dr. difranza is -- i think that is 3 the one difference, dr. difranza took the 4 position that, i do not think mr. marotta could 5 have quit. he did not try anymore. he kept 6 turning on the light switch and it did not go 7 on, and he did not continue to turn on the light 8 switch because he could not do it. and perhaps 9 dr. benowitz would disagree with that, but they 10 both agree with all the other things. 11 by the way, that is the secret documents 12 from tobacco where they compare nicotine to 13 opiates. that is not us. that is their 14 statements. 15 so we put on dr. difranza. they put on 16 dr. benowitz, who basically said almost 17 everything identically to dr. difranza, except 18 the one point about maybe someone can quit or 19 more people can quit. 20 but in every respect, they were identical 21 about the power of addiction from nicotine, and 22 in every single respect, they agreed that it is 23 almost or pretty much most regular and heavy 24 smokers, and they both agreed about the fact 25 that nicotine gets in the brain, especially 1 with children. 2 this was a 12-year-old boy, a boy who was 3 not in a fair fight with nicotine. that is what 4 it was. he got hooked on nicotine and, by 15, 5 he was already hooked, and they both agreed 6 that the brain changes permanently. 7 so what is the evidence on the other side 8 when we weigh the scales? dr. benowitz went 9 through all these points. every single one of 10 them, number of cigarettes smoked per day. 11 dr. benowitz said if you smoke ten 12 cigarettes a day for ten years, you will be 13 addicted. well, phil marotta smoked maybe 40 14 or 50 or 60 cigarettes a day for 35 years. 15 dr. benowitz said, if you smoke one pack a 16 day for 20 years, you will be severity addicted. 17 well, phil marotta smoked two to three packs a 18 day for 35 years. 19 he said, how soon after you wake have your 20 first cigarette? bam. first thing in the 21 morning, that is the first thing he did. if you 22 wake up in the night, bam, every night he is up 23 looking for a smoke. 24 you talk about history of failed quit 25 attempts. they tried on lent. they tried on 1 new year's. they tried any number of times, 2 probably a lot more than anyone remembered. he 3 tried gardening. he tried tea. he tried yoga. 4 he tried music. he tried long walks and, 5 finally, prayer. and none of it worked. 6 and this was at a time when really there 7 were no medications. that is important. there 8 was gum. it was controversial, dr. difranza 9 told you that, during that time period. 10 concerned about using too much gum and getting 11 addicted to the gum. 12 the bottom line is that we have, on our 13 side, dr. benowitz, dr. difranza, and we have 14 all the criteria of the dsm; every single one 15 of them was seven out of seven. the fagerstrom 16 test, he scored nine out of ten. ten being the 17 highest. 18 one of them was not checked because they 19 could not possibly know whether he smoked more 20 in the morning than the afternoon, as i recall. 21 and what is -- and then let us go to the next 22 one. these are the facts that really underpin 23 all of this. 24 the earlier you start, both benowitz and 25 difranza said, the more impact on your brain, 1 the more addiction, the harder. the more 2 cigarettes you smoke. he smoked an enormous 3 amount of cigarettes. the length of time, the 4 chain smoking. 5 this is 10 -- i'll get to that. first 6 thing in the morning, middle of the night, he 7 kept extra packs in his car. 8 remember the hiking in the mountains, you 9 heard that, and gasping for air and they light 10 up, and they realize we are addicted. and 11 everybody agrees he was addicted. 12 smoking sections in movies and leaving the 13 restaurants because he has to go smoke or not 14 being able to make it through the movie when 15 they did not have smoking sections. 16 10 out of 16. that means that, out of 16 17 waking hours, if you take 10 minutes per 18 cigarette, and you are smoking 60 a day, that is 19 10 hours a day. what a preoccupation that is, 20 10 hours a day smoking, and their position is 21 he is not addicted. 22 after he was diagnosed with lung cancer, 23 he continued to smoke. that is another hallmark 24 finding that dr. benowitz and what dr. difranza 25 said shows someone is addicted. 1 again, i said no medications and all the 2 quit attempts. 3 everybody in the family, the dsm, 4 dr. difranza, and the fagerstrom test, and i 5 would suggest that dr. benowitz, with all his 6 criteria, would tell you the exact same thing 7 because every single one of the criteria he 8 mentioned are the same that dr. difranza 9 mentioned. he just did not examine mr. marotta. 10 so what did r.j. reynolds put on, what 11 evidence do they have on the other side of 12 these scales? is it 51 percent or is it more 13 like 90? all we have to do is prove 14 51 percent. they put on no evidence. 15 am i out of time? 16 the court: two minutes. 17 mr. freidin: okay. one last thing i want 18 to talk about. it is important -- these 19 statements, i asked dr. difranza about these 20 statements. i put them up on the screen and i 21 said: do you agree with this? 22 "a person could be addicted to cigarettes 23 and eventually quit. that does not mean he 24 was not addicted. you can be addicted to a 25 substance and not try to quit." 1 basically what that is saying is addiction 2 and the ability to quit are not mutually 3 exclusive. in other words, whether you quit, 4 could have quit, inability to quit is not the 5 issue of addiction. 6 if it were, then all the millions of 7 former cocaine and heroin addicts have to be 8 pronounced never addicted. they would not have 9 been addicted. 10 these things are not interrelated, but the 11 defense, i think, is attempting to mix them up. 12 that is the last point i want to make, 13 which is the second question: was he addicted 14 and was it a legal cause -- notice the word 15 "a." we made a big "a" and bolded it because 16 it does not have to be the only legal cause. 17 now i'm going to turn it over to 18 mr. alvarez, and i thank you so much for your 19 attention. 20 mr. alvarez: may it please this honorable 21 court, counsel, counsel. 22 one of the things i talked to you about 23 during opening statement is that this case was 24 about choices. one of the things that is key in 25 this case is about choices, about good choices 1 and about bad choices. 2 so let us examine some of those choices and 3 when they were made and who made them and under 4 what circumstances they were made, because what 5 we are really dealing with here are the choices 6 that were made by a 12-year-old little boy in 7 queens, new york who was hanging out in front 8 of a candy store. 9 and how did his life change, what are the 10 two things -- how did r.j. reynolds and the 11 tobacco industry, how did those two things, how 12 did those two forces collide and change his 13 life forever, and those of his children, how 14 did that happen? 15 and it was not by accident. it was 16 purposely done, intentionally done. the whole 17 purpose of the tobacco industry and r.j. 18 reynolds is to get young people smoking. 19 that is what they want. they want young people 20 to come in and start as young as possible and 21 smoke as much as they want so that they become 22 addicted. that is their purpose. 23 look at these documents. "school days are 24 here and that means big tobacco business for 25 somebody. line up the most popular students. 1 summer school is starting. get your young men 2 intensely interested in lining up these 3 students as consumers." 4 "it may be well to consider another aspect 5 of our business, that is, the factors which 6 induce a presmoker or nonsmoker to become a 7 habituated smoker." 8 that was their purpose. that was their 9 intent. that is what they wanted and that is 10 what they got. this was their plan from the 11 beginning, to hook them as young as possible. 12 here are some more industry documents. 13 this is from the ftc report of 1967. it says, 14 "many youngsters consider cigarette smoking to 15 be an acceptable and socially desirable 16 activity. because the health dangers of 17 cigarette smoking are not brought home to them 18 in an effective and meaningful way, many 19 teenagers take up the smoking habit. once they 20 start, they may never be able to stop." 21 how did that happen? did one day phil 22 marotta, 12-year-old little boy, just wake up 23 and say, i'm going to smoke today? 24 they created that culture. they created 25 that world. they wanted young people to think 1 that smoking is cool so that they could idolize 2 all the people they saw on tv, all the people 3 they saw in the movies, their favorite athlete. 4 they created that for a purpose. 5 and they spent a lot of money doing that 6 from 1940 to 2010 -- 2004, the surgeon general 7 report says that 250 billion, not million, 8 billion dollars was spent by the tobacco 9 industry on advertising, $250 billion to 10 advertise this product and mainly to young 11 people, because they know, they know that the 12 younger you get them, you got them for life. 13 they know. 14 they created this culture through 15 advertising, tv -- robert, why do not you play 16 some of these. 17 (at this time, a video was played for the 18 court and taken down to the best of the court 19 reporter's ability:) 20 "there are thousands of doctors, doctors 21 in all parts of the country, in every state of 22 the union, doctors in every branch of medicine 23 are asked: what cigarette do you smoke, 24 doctor? brand name most was camel. yes, 25 according to the survey, more doctors smoke 1 camels than any other cigarette. 2 "do you inhale, then you are better off 3 smoking philip morris, and here is how you can 4 prove it. light up a philip morris, take a 5 puff, get a good mouthful of smoke and slowly 6 let the smoke come directly. 7 "hang some on your christmas tree. 8 they are easy to give, so good to get, give 9 camels. 10 "go with the smoking, pleasure, with pall 11 mall. 12 "mickey mantel, what do you say, mickey? 13 it is not hard to see why most folks enjoy 14 camels than other brands. 15 "i got a better idea. let us take a 16 winston break. that is it. winston is the one 17 filter cigarette that delivers flavor 20 times 18 a pack. winston's got that filter. yeah, 19 fred. 20 "why do not you settle back, settle back, 21 and have a smoke. 22 "cigarette manufacturers had something to 23 do with that? 24 "yeah, i think. 25 "cigarette manufacturers do not make 1 movies. 2 "but what do you think, that the movie 3 maker just chose marlboro on his own. 4 "perhaps the movie maker was a marlboro 5 smoker." 6 (end of video.) 7 mr. alvarez: they knew what they were 8 doing. they knew it. they knew that cigarette 9 smoking caused cancer and other very serious 10 diseases. they knew that from the beginning. 11 they knew it as early mid-'50s and they 12 omitted that, they concealed that from the 13 public, and we are going to talk about some of 14 the things that they did purposely, 15 intentionally to hurt phil marotta. 16 look at these documents. this is their 17 words. "carcinogens are found in practically 18 every class of compounds of smoke. obviously 19 the amount of evidence accumulated to indict 20 cigarette smoking as a health hazard is 21 overwhelming. the evidence challenging such an 22 indictment is scant. 23 "cigarettes have certain unattractive side 24 effects." they call it a side effect, a side 25 effect. they cause lung cancer. 1 they knew. look at the dates, '61, '62, 2 '63. we can show you more. this is what they 3 did. they created this whole body of science 4 so that scientists would come out and make it 5 seem like they were unbiased, when the whole 6 time they were in their pocket. 7 they bought and paid for these people so 8 that they could continue to sell cigarettes to 9 young people so they could get addicted for the 10 rest of their life, because they did not care 11 whether they died or not. they did not care. 12 this is what they cared about. "if this 13 committee had not been formed, the cigarette 14 industry by now would have been in a deplorable 15 position. the tirc has been a successful 16 defensive operation. we must in the near 17 future provide some answers which will give 18 smokers a psychological crutch and a 19 self-rationale to continue to smoke. 20 "obviously the key word is confusion. our 21 basic position in the cigarette controversy is 22 subject to the charge and may be subject to a 23 finding that we are making false and misleading 24 statements." 25 they knew it. that is their own words. 1 "the most important type of story is that 2 that casts doubt on the cause and effect theory 3 of disease and smoking. doubt is our product. 4 it is the means of establishing a controversy." 5 this was a plan, a deliberate plan. 6 before you play that -- the documents show you 7 what they know, which we did not know, which 8 phil did not know, but look at what they were 9 telling the world between 1953 and 1970, and 10 this is a medley of some of those statements. 11 (at this time, a video was played for the 12 court and taken down to the best of the court 13 reporter's ability:) 14 "if it was found by somebody working under 15 the tobacco industry research grant, it would 16 be made public immediately and just as broadly 17 as we could make it, and then efforts would be 18 taken to attempt to remove that substance or 19 substances. 20 "if we do find any that we consider 21 harmful, and so far we have not, we will remove 22 these from smoke and still retain the pleasure 23 of your favorite cigarette. 24 "we want to be the detective just as much 25 as the surgeon general, and we will cooperate in 1 every way. well, obviously a filter takes out 2 certain tar and nicotine. i do not think the 3 industry admits there are any bad elements. if 4 there are bad elements, through the 5 laboratories, through the surgeon general, 6 through the ama, through acts of god and luck, 7 we hope we may find them. and if they are 8 found, they will be removed. 9 "we do talk to the question of whether or 10 not cigarettes are hazardous. we do not 11 believe that cigarettes are hazardous. we 12 do not accept that. because when, as, and if 13 any ingredient in cigarette smoke is identified 14 as being injurious to human health, we are 15 confident that we can eliminate that 16 ingredient. 17 "do you believe that cigarettes are safe? 18 have they been proven to be safe, mr. culman? 19 "i believe they have not been proven to be 20 unsafe." 21 (end of video.) 22 mr. alvarez: every one of those 23 statements was false and misleading, and the 24 evidence of their falsehood is in those 25 internal documents. they knew exactly what 1 they were doing. they purposely mislead the 2 public and phil marotta. they did it on 3 purpose. 4 here are some more documents. "ctr and 5 the industry have publicly and frequently 6 denied what others find as truth. let us face 7 it, we are interested in evidence which we 8 believe denies the allegation that cigarette 9 smoking causes cancer. 10 "for nearly 20 years, the industry has 11 employed a single strategy to defend itself on 12 three major fronts; litigation, politics, and 13 public opinion. 14 "while this strategy was brilliantly 15 conceived and executed" -- by the way, that is 16 business for patting yourself on the back. 17 look, we were smart, we got one over on these 18 people. look how brilliant this thing was. 19 look how brilliant this thing was. 20 "over the years, helping us win important 21 battles. it is only fair to say that it is not 22 nor was it intended to be a vehicle for 23 victory." 24 they want victory. they want to be able 25 to continue this life forever and people smoke 1 forever. 2 "on the contrary, it will always be a 3 holding strategy consisting of creating doubt 4 about the health effect, health charges without 5 actually denying it. 6 "ctr began its organization called the 7 tirc. it was set up as an industry shield. 8 bill shinn, a lawyer, feels that special 9 projects are the best way that monies are 10 spent. on these projects, ctr has acted as a 11 front. 12 "cigarette smoking is more addictive than 13 using heroin, hooking two-thirds of the people 14 who ever smoked." 15 look at that. they know. they know that 16 two-thirds of all their customers are going to 17 get hooked and they compare it to heroin. 18 "we cannot defend continued smoking as free 19 choice if the person was addicted." 20 so it is not about choice, and they know 21 that because, if you are truly addicted, it is 22 not about choice. and their own internal 23 secret documents admit that. 24 they just do not stop. it is a machine that 25 does not stop. it is a pr machine that does not 1 stop. 2 when you have hundreds of millions of 3 dollars to spend on advertising, to spend on 4 getting your message across, that is a very 5 powerful machine, and that is how you shape 6 public awareness. 7 the way you shape the public is by 8 creating the atmosphere and then having people 9 doubt the health effects of smoking, and this 10 is how you do it. think about this. 11 if you have an addicted smoker who is 12 truly addicted and he hears two competing 13 messages. he hears from public health 14 officials that smoking causes cancer and other 15 diseases, he hears that. and then he hears 16 from the product manufacturer, well, there is a 17 controversy, we are not sure, it has not been 18 decided, there is controversy over this. there 19 is a lot of doubt in whether it is true or not. 20 if the smoker is addicted, which one of 21 those two messages will the addicted smoker 22 accept? and they knew that, and that is why 23 they created this whole campaign about doubt 24 and confusion. 25 they knew all they had to do is give 1 people, smokers, a crutch, a rationale, a 2 reason to doubt the health officials and then 3 nicotine would do the rest. they knew it. 4 it is a perfect plan. it is a perfect plan. 5 it is perfect, except for millions and millions 6 of people, like phil marotta, who die. 7 (at this time, a video was played for the 8 court and taken down to the best of the court 9 reporter's ability:) 10 "the cause of lung cancer is, as yet, 11 unknown. in fact, no one knows what causes 12 lung cancer. 13 "and as far as i'm concerned, the bottom 14 line is that we simply do not know. 15 "the case is still open. the jury has not 16 come in. 17 "it may not be harmful. you are not 18 convinced. 19 "it may be or it may not be. we do not 20 know. 21 "it is not known whether cigarettes cause 22 cancer. it has not been casually established. 23 "do cigarettes cause cancer? 24 "i do not know if they do or not. 25 "i'm not in a position to give you a does 1 or does not answer. 2 "we do not know what causes cancer in 3 general right now, so i think that we may find 4 out what causes cancer and we may find out some 5 relationship, which has yet to be proven." 6 (end of video.) 7 mr. alvarez: that is more evidence of 8 their plan, just keep it out there, keep it 9 going, keep that controversy going, just keep 10 it going because, as long as you keep it going, 11 we know the effects of nicotine will keep 12 people addicted. and as long as that 13 controversy is out there, the addicted smoker 14 will choose us, will choose us. 15 this is from the federal trade commission 16 report to congress in '67, "cigarette smoking 17 is, without question, the greatest single 18 public health problem this nation has ever 19 faced. the cost to society of cigarette 20 smoking in human terms is staggering. it is 21 the number one cause of preventable death in 22 the united states" -- the number one cause. 23 the third question that you are going to 24 get on the verdict form is dealing with 25 negligence: did they act like a reasonable, 1 prudent manufacturer should act? very simple, 2 did they act that way? 3 well, we know by the engle findings, if 4 you establish that he is a class member, you 5 have to accept the fact that they have already 6 been found negligent. they have already been 7 found negligent. 8 the question is: was it the legal cause, 9 was it the legal cause. but for the 10 negligence, but for the carelessness, but for 11 them hooking him when he was 12, would he have 12 smoked for 35 years two to three packs a day 13 and gotten cancer. 14 would a prudent and reasonable corporation 15 not tell the truth? by the way, there is 13 16 questions. we think every single one of them 17 should be yes, every single one should be yes. 18 it is time for good choices and bad 19 choices. so what is it that they do? because 20 the next question has to do with strict 21 liability, has to do with them putting a 22 defective cigarette on the market. 23 the law in this case has been established, 24 if you find he is a class member, these 25 cigarettes that mr. marotta smoked were 1 defective, were defective. 2 there is thousands of chemicals in smoke. 3 there is thousands of chemicals. there is over 4 70 carcinogens, those are cancer-causing 5 agents. 6 if you are a regular smoker, 10 or 7 15 percent of them will get lung cancer, but 8 nearly half of them will die of another 9 smoking-related disease, either copd, other 10 types of cancer, bladder, esophageal, many, 11 many other cancers. so half of the people who 12 regularly smoke will die of a smoking-related 13 disease. 14 these are the nicotine documents. 15 "without the chemical compound" -- this is 16 their documents. "without the chemical 17 compound, the cigarette market would collapse." 18 this is a philip morris document, "would 19 collapse and we would all lose our jobs and our 20 consulting fees," because that is what they care 21 about. that is the only thing -- these guys 22 only care about one thing, and it is not phil 23 marotta and it is not the 15-, 16-, or 24 17-year-old kid that starts smoking. they only 25 care about one thing, and that is their profits. 1 that is all they care about. that is all they 2 care about. 3 "however, we must never be comfortable 4 selling a product which most of our customers 5 would stop using if they could. that is to 6 say, if the exit gates from our market would 7 suddenly open, we would be out of business 8 almost overnight." 9 so these guys get it. these guys are not 10 stupid guys, they are scientists, phds, they 11 hire people, they got a lot of money. they 12 know what to do. 13 they get it. listen, if we continue to 14 make this thing addictive, people are going to 15 continue to smoke. and if we do not make it 16 addictive, guess what, people will not smoke, and 17 i'm going to be out of a job. 18 so would i rather be out of a job or am i 19 going to continue doing what i'm doing and get 20 people hooked and give false and misleading 21 information? 22 "moreover, nicotine is addictive. we are 23 in the business of selling nicotine, an 24 addictive drug. for the typical smoker, 25 nicotine satisfaction is a dominant desire. 1 therefore, in designing any cigarette product, 2 the dominant specification should be nicotine 3 delivery." 4 these guys get it. this whole thing 5 about -- this whole thing about, well, if you 6 get a little bit of tobacco from the ground, 7 it is going to have nicotine in it. nicotine 8 naturally occurs in tobacco. yeah. 9 but they manipulate it, because you could 10 raise or lower the level of nicotine in 11 cigarettes so that you do not make it addictive. 12 "tobacco product and deliver nicotine, a 13 potent drug with a variety of physiological 14 effects. our industry is based upon design, 15 manufacturer, and sale of an attractive dose 16 form of nicotine." 17 there is no dispute. they are not selling 18 the pleasure. that is what the market is 19 because what they really want to do is hook 20 them because they know what they are really 21 selling is a drug. 22 and this is the easiest count. question 23 four, which is strict liability, i told you at 24 the beginning, that is the easiest one for us to 25 prove, because all i have to prove is that he 1 smoked their product. 2 and it is undisputed, there is no evidence 3 he did not smoke an rjr product. there is none. 4 he smoked winstons. they made winstons. there 5 is no issue, okay. that is the easiest count, 6 the easiest one. 7 and the engle finding is, if you except 8 that he is a class member, the defendant placed 9 cigarettes on the market that were defective 10 and unreasonably dangerous, and all i have to 11 prove is that, but for him smoking two packs a 12 day for 35 years, he would not have died. 13 that is it. so that is the easiest one to get 14 past. 15 strict liability. if the product is 16 defective, engle finding says that, you have to 17 accept that. it is the easiest one to prove. 18 let me talk to you about apportionment and 19 fault, because this is important. this is 20 where you get to decide choice. this is -- not 21 in class membership. this is where you get to 22 decide choice and fault. 23 state the percentage of responsibility for 24 phil marotta's death that you charge to r.j. 25 reynolds tobacco company? and then it will 1 have a percentage, and then phil marotta. 2 this is where you do that analysis, not in 3 class membership. class membership is about 4 the science, it is about the medicine, did he 5 have a smoking-related disease, was he 6 addicted, did he meet the classical definition 7 of addiction. 8 when you want to start looking at who 9 should have done what to when and where, this 10 is the question, this is the question. 11 so we accept some responsibility for his 12 smoking. he could have quit. he could have 13 tried harder. everybody could quit, okay. but 14 let us put that in context. 15 by the way, you may have an urge to put a 16 zero there under phil marotta, and i'm telling 17 you, no, do not do that, because we come in here 18 and say we have admitted some responsibility so, 19 please, do not do that, do not do that. 20 now, we are accepting responsibility for 21 the negligence claim and the strict liability 22 claim, but not for the fraud, the concealment 23 claim, and not for the conspiracy claim. 24 because there, they lied and they concealed 25 information and they were in cahoots with other 1 tobacco companies and other organizations who 2 did the very same thing. so these are not the 3 same. they are not on the same footing with us 4 on negligence, okay. 5 so let us talk about that. how do you 6 assess responsibility, because that is what 7 you are doing, who is more responsible? well, 8 this is the tobacco companies, r.j. reynolds, 9 versus a 12-year-old kid. put that in 10 perspective. r.j. reynolds versus a 11 12-year-old kid. 12 and what did dr. benowitz, an expert, who 13 is very well credentialed, who they played in 14 their case, no problem, play him. what did he 15 say about that? 16 he says, look, here is the thing with 17 adolescents and smoking, they at 12 as a teen, 18 you do not understand the magnitude of the 19 decision that you make to start smoking, you 20 do not understand. you do not understand that 21 you run a risk of 45 percent that you will die 22 from that decision that you make at 12 years 23 old. 24 and when they start as teens, and he was a 25 preteen because he was 12, they think they can 1 stop. they think they are going to be able to 2 stop. that is what dr. benowitz said, and 3 that is because their brain is forming. as an 4 adolescent, your brain starts to continue to 5 develop and form. 6 the other thing he said was, the earlier 7 you start, the more likely you are to be 8 addicted. 9 what else did he say about that? he said 10 tobacco companies purposely, purposely 11 manipulate the levels of nicotine to keep 12 smokers addicted, and he is not the only one, by 13 the way. dr. proctor, who was the historian, 14 our very first witness who came in, said two 15 things about that. 16 he said, look, they designed this 17 cigarette very carefully. they did two things 18 to it to make it sellable and to have them keep 19 selling their product in perpetuity, which is 20 the legal word for forever. 21 what do they do? they made it inhalable. 22 they lowered the ph so they can make it 23 inhalable. if people just wanted to look cool 24 with a cigarette in their mouth and just put it 25 in their mouth to puff the smoke back out, they 1 could adjust the ph level so that people do not 2 inhale it. they can do that. 3 but why would not they do that? because 4 the only way you get the nicotine into your 5 lungs and into your bloodstream is by inhaling. 6 that is why. 7 so on balance, on balance, what is the 8 percent of negligence, how much of it is his 9 fault, is he responsible for, and how much are 10 they responsible for? 11 how much does a 12-year-old boy who 12 started smoking, who makes a decision to start 13 smoking in front of a candy store in queens, 14 new york, really know the magnitude of that 15 decision that he makes and how it is going to 16 play for the rest of his life and for his 17 family? 18 and i think it is 90/10, r.j. reynolds 19 should be ninety percent and phil marotta should be 20 10. 21 let us talk about choices again. you heard 22 the whole conspiracy story, how it was hatched 23 in 1953, how the heads of all the tobacco 24 companies got into a meeting at the plaza hotel 25 in new york city and said, look, we are not 1 going to let this stand. what we are going to 2 do is we are going to fight this. we are going 3 to continue to sell our product. we do not 4 care. 5 and this document to me is the most 6 flagrant, the most -- this is a mirror into 7 their soul, this document is a mirror into 8 their soul. 9 look what they say, "in validation of some 10 reports in the research department, we do not 11 foresee any difficulty in the event a decision 12 is reached to remove certain reports from 13 research files. 14 "once it becomes clear that such action is 15 necessary for the successful defense of our 16 present and future suits, we will promptly 17 remove all such reports from our files. as an 18 alternative to invalidation, we can have the 19 authors rewrite those sections of the report 20 which appear objectionable."does this look like 21 a corporation who wants to tell the truth, who 22 cares about phil marotta, who cares about 23 anybody? 24 and this is a memo right after that 25 meeting. "it is fortunate for us that 1 cigarettes are a habit they cannot break. boy, 2 would not it be wonderful if our company was the 3 first to produce a cancer-free cigarette." 4 this is december of 1953. they went to the 5 year 2000 before they finally admit it. 6 then they did this whole frank statement 7 that they -- hundreds of newspapers all around 8 the united states, 43 million people, viewers, 9 readers, got this, and they told people the 10 exact opposite. 11 "there is no proof that cigarette smoking 12 is one of the causes. we accept an interest in 13 people's health as a basic responsibility, 14 paramount to every other consideration in our 15 business. we believe the product we make are 16 not injurious to health." 17 but you got to understand in 1953, the 18 world was a different people. you say that now 19 about a corporation, after a recall or 20 something, and people would go, i do not know, i 21 do not know if i'm really going to believe you 22 because we are much more aware. but in 1953, 23 it is not the world we lived in. 24 so let us talk about this filter thing, 25 because these -- you got to give them credit. 1 these guys are sharp. these guys are smart, 2 very, very, very smart, okay. 3 in 1950, less than 1 percent of all the 4 cigarettes sold in the united states had 5 filters, that is from the ftc report. in 1975, 6 87 percent of all cigarettes sold in america 7 had filters on it. 8 why? why? why did they do that? because 9 that fit into their whole scheme about 10 convincing people, if we put a filter on it, it 11 will take out all the bad stuff, when they knew 12 the whole time that it did not do it. 13 look at this. june, 1966, "the illusion 14 of filtration is as important as the fact of 15 filtration." the ftc -- let us go over here. 16 "in most cases, however, the smoker of a 17 filter cigarette was getting as much or more 18 nicotine and tar as he would have gotten from a 19 regular cigarette. he had abandoned the 20 regular cigarette, however, on the ground of 21 reduced risk to health. 22 "the belief appears to be widely held that 23 filter cigarettes are less hazardous to health 24 than regular cigarettes, that many of the most 25 popular brands of filter cigarettes contain as 1 much or more tar and nicotine as many brands of 2 non-filter cigarettes." 3 and the surgeon general report 2010, "by 4 the 21st century, it was apparent that five 5 decades of evolving cigarette design had not 6 reduced overall disease risk among smokers, and 7 the new designs were used by the tobacco 8 industry as a tool to undermine prevention and 9 cessation efforts." 10 so that was just another tool. what they 11 did was they said, look, we will fight this 12 battle with controversy and doubt and then 13 we will put filters on cigarettes and say, if 14 we are wrong about this, do not worry, the filter 15 will keep you safe, when all along they knew it 16 was not true. 17 and you heard from dr. proctor why, 18 because it does not filter out any of the 19 carcinogens. in fact, it is worse for you 20 because you end up inhaling more because the 21 filter compresses the smoke and you end up 22 smoking deeper and longer, so you end up 23 getting more carcinogens in your body. 24 is it a coincidence that the brand that 25 mr. marotta smoked, phil, when he started 1 smoking in 1959, when he was 12 years old, was 2 a filtered cigarette? 3 when he made a choice in 1959 to smoke, he 4 could have chose anything, right, could have 5 chose anything, yet he chose a filtered 6 cigarette. 7 this is about addiction and it is not a 8 free choice. 1967, "there is no indication in 9 any advisement that after a person smokes 10 cigarettes regularly for a while smoking is no 11 longer a matter of choice. for him, it becomes 12 a matter of need." that is the ftc report. 13 this is another internal document in 1980, 14 "cigarette smoking is more addictive than using 15 heroin, hooking two-thirds of the people who 16 ever smoked. we cannot defend continued smoking 17 as a free choice if the person is addicted. 18 "the two factors refuting the argument 19 smoking is a matter of free choice, most 20 smokers start smoking as teenagers and then 21 become addicted." 22 that is the surgeon general. 23 the court: ten minutes. 24 mr. alvarez: thank you. 25 so from 1953 to 1994, these guys just 1 continued their whole propaganda machine, it 2 did not stop. and the evidence of phil marotta, 3 he continued to rely into the 1980s and '90s, 4 phil trusted reynolds, he trusted what he was 5 doing, he trusted, he believed. 6 in fact, he told one of his partners, 7 "do not worry about me, i'm not going to get 8 lung cancer until i'm 80." 9 phil believed his parents died from 10 asbestos, not smoking. you saw that from the 11 medical records. 12 he rationalized his failures. he did 13 exactly what dr. benowitz -- if you listen -- 14 dr. benowitz did not even know anything about 15 phil marotta. 16 if you listen to his testimony and you 17 look at the criteria about smokers and how they 18 rationalize, it is phil marotta to a t. 19 he smoked filters to keep him safe. rjr 20 concealed that, understanding about the 21 addiction, and when he started smoking as a 22 child. 23 phil did not know that they were 24 manipulating the nicotine levels to keep him 25 addicted. he did not know. no one knew. they 1 knew. 2 and this is what they do. these are the 3 statements that they make. this shows you who 4 they are. 5 (at this time, a video was played for the 6 court and taken down to the best of the court 7 reporter's ability:) 8 "throughout your tenure with american, it 9 was not only american's position but your 10 position that cigarettes were not injurious to 11 health; is that accurate? 12 "through my tenure? 13 "yes. 14 "yes, that is so. 15 "that is something american tobacco wanted 16 the public to believe; is that correct? 17 "yes. 18 "it is a statement that american tobacco 19 takes great reliance on? 20 "we issued that statement, yes. 21 "and as far as you are concerned, a person 22 is justified in relying on that statement? 23 "yes." 24 (end of video.) 25 mr. alvarez: that is the president of 1 american tobacco company and that is part of the 2 rjr company. 3 "when we say those things, we want smokers 4 to believe it," and he did. look at the 5 evidence, this worked on phil. 6 phil told -- this is 1989 to '90. this is 7 where phil said, look, my dad came up to me and 8 said, do not do drugs, do not drink, and do not 9 smoke, okay, because it is very, very addictive, 10 okay. 11 what he did not tell him was, it is going to 12 cause cancer and you are going to die. he never 13 told him that, and you know why he did not tell 14 him that, because he did not believe it. he 15 did not believe it because he was an addicted 16 smoker and he rationalized. he did exactly 17 what they wanted him to do. 18 phil told his daughter when she was at the 19 beach, remember the story, that she was at the 20 beach, and he went off with the sister and she 21 started smoking. and when they got back, the 22 lady next to them on the beach said to phil, 23 hey, your daughter was smoking. well, that 24 happened in 1985. 25 and these dates are important for a second 1 and i'll tell you why. 2 and he says, do not do that, it is very 3 addictive. once you start, you cannot stop. 4 it is bad for your teeth. it is bad for your 5 hair. it colors your teeth. he never once 6 said, this caused cancer, you are going to die 7 from that. 8 marie says, 1985, that she still believed 9 the controversy. they are both two peas in a 10 pod. they grew up in the same neighborhood, 11 heard the same things. they were married for a 12 long time together, and they remained friends 13 afterwards. 14 phil told his partner, mr. denunzio, about 15 the controversy. they discussed it. they 16 talked about it between 1984 and 1987 when they 17 lived together. 18 that is evidence that he knew and he 19 relied on the controversy. he believed it. 20 that is evidence of it and they wanted him to 21 believe it. they wanted him to believe it. 22 (at this time, a video was played for the 23 court and taken down to the best of the court 24 reporter's ability:) 25 "american disagrees with the warning 1 does not it? 2 "we certainly do. 3 "you do not think they harm smokers so 4 there is no reason to put any warning on? 5 "we believe our product is not injurious 6 to health. 7 "as far as you are concerned, is the 8 surgeon general simply wrong in concluding that 9 cigarette smoking causes lung cancer? 10 "i would use the term "misguided." 11 "okay, if he is misguided, then i take it 12 that your opinion is he is wrong? 13 "i was simply trying to be polite about 14 it. 15 "but not being polite about it, in your 16 opinion, he is wrong? 17 "dead wrong. 18 "congress is wrong in requiring these 19 warnings, correct? 20 "we do not think they are justified. 21 "so they are wrong? 22 "they are wrong." 23 (end of video.) 24 mr. alvarez: they are wrong. as much as 25 they published these warnings, it is on the 1 pack, it is on the pack, they were not embracing 2 those warnings, telling people do not smoke, 3 this is bad for you. they were saying the 4 opposite. 5 the court: two minutes. 6 mr. alvarez: i'm going to eat into my... 7 the court: that is fine. 8 mr. alvarez: the law in this case is, the 9 engle finding is that, "they concealed and 10 omitted material information, not otherwise 11 known or available, knowing the material was 12 false and misleading, and they failed to 13 disclose a material fact concerning or proving 14 the health effects and/or addictive nature of 15 smoking cigarettes." 16 and the other engle finding is that, "they 17 entered into an agreement to conceal and omit 18 information." 19 so these guys -- this is a finding, you 20 have to accept this in this case. this is the 21 law of this case, if you find he is a class 22 member, okay. and so those are whatever 23 questions those are, i think they are nine and 24 eight -- eight, nine. 25 so questions six and seven should be yes 1 and yes. and let me tell you, this 1982 -- you 2 guys are wondering, why is this may 1982. 3 there is no evidence in this case about 4 anything that happened in may of 1982, so do not 5 look for it in the record, but it has legal 6 significance for us. 7 so what we have to prove to you is that, 8 after 1982, he relied on the controversy. he 9 still believed in the controversy, whether 10 because he kept smoking because of the filter 11 or those statements that you heard, those 12 conversations he had with other people, his 13 family and his friends and his partners, but 14 that is there. it is in the evidence and the 15 answer to that is yes. 16 and the same thing for the conspiracy 17 count. basically the same counts and the 18 answer to both of those are yes. 19 and i call this the hypocrisy of their 20 position because for 50 years they said smoking 21 does not cause cancer, we doubt it, there is no 22 science, there is no this, we cannot believe. 23 you heard it, you heard it over and over and 24 over again from them, right? right, you heard 25 it. 1 but then they come in here to court and 2 what do they do. no. no. everybody knew. 3 phil knew. everybody knew. this was -- come 4 on. everybody knew. think about that for a 5 second. 6 for the first 50 years, while he is 7 smoking, buying their product, he is telling 8 them -- telling him, it is okay. it has not been 9 proven, go ahead. 10 but then they come into court and they 11 say, no, no, no, he should have known. that is 12 the hypocrisy. they take a complete 180 degree 13 change in position so they can win a lawsuit. 14 i want to show you this video in a second, 15 but let me prefix it. this is april 1994. 16 this is seven months before he dies. 17 (at this time, a video was played for the 18 court and taken down to the best of the court 19 reporter's ability:) 20 "raise your right hand. do you swear that 21 the testimony you are about to give is the 22 truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the 23 truth? 24 "i do. i do. 25 "please consider yourself to be under 1 oath. 2 "let me begin my questioning in the matter 3 of whether or not nicotine is addictive. let 4 me ask you first, and i'd like to just go down 5 the row whether each of you believes that 6 nicotine is not addictive. i heard virtually 7 all of you touch on it and just yes or no. 8 "do you believe nicotine is not addictive? 9 "i believe nicotine is not addictive, yes. 10 "mr. johnston? 11 "congressmen, cigarettes and nicotine 12 clearly do not meet the classic definitions of 13 addiction. there is no intoxication. 14 "we will take that as a no. and again, time 15 is short. if you can just -- i think each of 16 you believes nicotine is not addictive. we 17 would like to have this for the record. 18 "i do not believe that nicotine or our 19 products are addictive. 20 "i believe nicotine is not addictive. 21 "i believe that nicotine is not addictive. 22 "i believe that nicotine is not addictive. 23 "and i, too, believe that nicotine is not 24 addictive." 25 (end of video.) 1 mr. alvarez: seven months before he died, 2 they were still denying it, and they denied it 3 to the entire world, to the american people and 4 congress. and they lied, and they knew what 5 they were saying was a lie when they said it. 6 so the last question, by the way, is going 7 to be about punitive damages. are we entitled 8 to punitive damages? this case screams for 9 punitive damages. 10 "our basic position in the cigarette 11 controversy is subject to the charge and may be 12 subject to a finding that we are making false 13 and misleading statements to promote the sale 14 of cigarettes." 15 so the answer to that last question is 16 yes. 17 now, here is a photograph of phil marotta 18 and his three kids. to the left of it is the 19 plaza hotel, 1953, and to the right of that are 20 the executives going before congress and lying. 21 what happened? how has this affected this 22 family? because he is not there anymore and one 23 of the questions you are going to be asked is to 24 evaluate damages in this case. 25 and let me tell you there is three 1 separate -- there is three separate claims here. 2 there is three separate individuals; there is 3 phil and his two sisters, jill and andrea, so 4 each one of them has a claim, each one of them. 5 it is not one claim, it is three claims. 6 so what does it mean to lose your parent? 7 well, it means different things in different 8 parts of your life. when you are a child and 9 you are growing up, right, you need a parent to 10 protect you, to raise you, to guide you, to 11 nurture you, to teach you, many, many different 12 things that you need a parent for, okay. he 13 was not out of the woods. 14 your job as a parent -- first of all, your 15 job as a parent is never done, it is never done. 16 whether you are 17, 20, 24 when your dad dies, 17 okay, you still need your dad. you still need 18 him for a lot of different things. 19 you may not need them to pack your lunch 20 and drive you to school. but at 17, losing 21 your dad at 17, at 20, and 24 is too young. 22 and look how they turned out. look at 23 these kids, look how they turned out. one is a 24 successful business owner, two of them are 25 nurses who decided to help people. the number 1 one rule in nursing is to be a patient 2 advocate, number one rule, to help others, to 3 speak for the patient because they cannot 4 speak -- two of them basically went into public 5 service. 6 did that happen by accident? all three 7 have college degrees. did that happen by 8 accident? 9 they were a product of a loving, caring 10 family environment of which phil was a part of 11 and he helped nurturing his kids. and a 12 person's sexuality has nothing to do with what 13 kind of a parent you are going to be. it 14 does not. 15 so there is a certain -- i want you to 16 evaluate, when you are evaluating damages, you 17 go, okay, well, when they were 17, when they are 18 17s and teens and 20s, you know that adds a 19 certain aspect to it, but now they are older, so 20 now it does not matter. now it is less work, 21 what is the difference? now they are in their 22 30s and early 40s. what is the difference? 23 now is where it counts. let me tell you 24 why. because at the core of this case, the 25 damages in this case, it is about family. it is 1 about family. no one -- they each got 2 children, all of them, all the kids have kids. 3 no one can understand how much a parent 4 loves his child. no one can understand that. 5 but think about this. one of the things that 6 helps you love more is when you watch your 7 child go running to his grandparent and just 8 lunging himself in his arms. just watch their 9 eyes, both of them, the child and the 10 grandparents, when that child just squeezes his 11 grandfather. 12 that is what they miss. that is what is 13 lacking. that is their loss. not only when 14 they were 17, but they still need their father 15 today because that is what they are suffering. 16 now, you are going to be asked, "please 17 state the total amount of damages sustained by 18 phil marotta, which this is phil, jill, marie 19 marotta, andrea bacener for the loss of their 20 parental companionship, protection, and the 21 pain and suffering as a result of phil 22 marotta's lung cancer and death," and each one 23 of them has an award. 24 you can do whatever you want, as long as 25 it is reasonable in light of the evidence. you 1 guys decide that. 2 i'm going to suggest a number. you may 3 think it is too low. you may think it is too 4 high. you are the judge. you are the judge. 5 but just think, just think, this is not 6 about losing your father at 17. this is about 7 a family. think about a little pebble that you 8 throw into a pond and that ripple goes out. 9 and every time there is something with your 10 child that you want him there, it is like keep 11 throwing another pebble into that pond and that 12 ripple effect, and they are suffering every day 13 when that happens. 14 so i'm going to suggest a figure, and like 15 i said, you may think it is too low. you may 16 think it is too high. it is up to you whatever 17 you think is fair and reasonable. and we think 18 $9 million for each of the children is fair and 19 reasonable in light of the evidence. 20 thank you, your honor. 12 mr. alvarez: i'll be brief because i know 13 you are all tired. 14 mr. belasic just said that i took 15 responsibility for my client, which we did, and 16 that the surgeon general says that smokers 17 should take responsibility. 18 but you know who has not taken 19 responsibility? r.j. reynolds. they have not 20 taken responsibility. they are the only ones in 21 this courtroom that has not taken any 22 responsibility. zero responsibility for what 23 happened. in the 50 years, they have never taken 24 responsibility. 25 he showed you this and said, look, no one 2748 1 believed us, no one believed us. only 2 3 percent of the people believe the tobacco 3 industry. that is why they went and bought 4 scientists. that is why they went and bought 5 the american medical association for 6 $10 million. that is why they did that. 7 because they knew they had a credibility 8 problem and that is why they spent their 9 millions of dollars influencing these groups of 10 people to get the message out. 11 he said, look, it is not illegal to sell 12 this product, we are allowed to do it. but you 13 know what the instructions tell you about that? 14 you cannot -- "however, false, misleading or 15 deceitful statements and misrepresentations 16 made as part of the public debate regarding 17 smoking and health issues are not protected 18 free speech." 19 that is the problem. the problem is that 20 they lied. that is why they are in court today, 21 because they lied. they were deceitful. they 22 gave false and misleading statements about the 23 health effects of smoking. that is why we are in 24 court today. 25 put up the surgeon general. he said, 2749 1 "there is no evidence that filters were 2 dangerous." well, look what the surgeon 3 general said about that. 4 "by the 21st century, it was apparent that 5 five decades of evolving cigarette design had 6 not reduced the overall risk among smokers and 7 the new designs were used by the tobacco 8 industry as a tool to undermine prevention and 9 cessation efforts." that is the 2010 surgeon 10 general report, and that is what they are talking 11 about. 12 they are talking about these low tar 13 filters and all these things that they claim 14 make cigarettes safer and they do not. they are 15 just gimmicks. 16 they said that mr. marotta made no effort 17 to quit. first of all, that is not true. he 18 did make efforts. 19 but you know what, that is exactly what 20 they wanted. they wanted smokers like 21 mr. marotta not to quit. that is exactly what 22 they wanted. but now they come in here and 23 they criticize him for his quit attempts when 24 all along they do not want him to quit. 25 he said nothing they did, nothing they did 2750 1 caused his death. 2 so this young man wakes up one morning and 3 decides he is going to smoke, for no reason, for 4 no reason. that is what they want you to 5 believe. for no reason. none. 6 ask yourself this question. if everyone 7 knew, if it was so pervasive and everybody 8 knew, even kids in high school, if everybody 9 knew, why would they spend millions and 10 millions and millions of dollars on a campaign 11 of doubt, if everybody knew? 12 i mean, these guys were bright. they are 13 very intelligent and they are scientists, 14 executives, very smart, they know how to make 15 money. why would they throw money away like 16 that? why would they throw millions of dollars 17 away like that if everyone knew? 18 now, they said that there was no evidence 19 of post 1982 reliance. we went over it. there 20 is. you heard it. you heard it. that is how 21 you get to punitive damages, by answering those 22 questions yes. 23 now the pathologist, he made a big deal 24 about the pathologist, that he would not come in 25 and testify. 2751 1 the report, dr. goscin's report said it is 2 large cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma. 3 ninety percent of all large cell carcinoma is 4 caused by smoking. 5 they talked about the bac, this whole 6 thing about the bac and they showed you this 7 slide. 8 well, bac goes all around the air sacs. 9 this one is mr. marotta. i circled all the 10 areas around the air sac where there is none. 11 he said, oh -- by the way, we do not have 12 to prove that it is bac, we do not have to prove 13 that. 14 but if they wanted to prove that it was 15 bac, they had the pathologist, they had the 16 slides, he looked at the slides and said you 17 can do special staining to these slides to find 18 out if there is bac. 19 okay, so why do not you do it? if you want 20 to prove that it was bac, you want to confirm 21 your diagnosis, then why did not you stain them 22 and come into court and say, here are the 23 stained slides, that is how i know it is bac. 24 talked about the family history. the 25 family history only makes the smoking more 2752 1 prominent. the fact that they are predisposed 2 to cancer means that their body is unable to 3 fight off the toxic effects of smoking, which 4 makes smoking even more dangerous, five times 5 more dangerous. 6 they read, they did not read it, they just 7 said dr. messinger, who was the radiologist 8 that we hired, could not rule out bac. well, 9 actually, let us see what he actually said 10 because we read it. 11 "could a bac that has progressed and 12 spread become more aggressive present this way, 13 doctor?" 14 "answer: i think it is best that a 15 pathologist tell you that. but i mean, we 16 do not see that many bacs. and those that i 17 have seen are generally more isolated and not 18 aggressive. so i think probably it is best. i 19 mean, theoretically" -- theoretically -- "i 20 would think probably the answer is true, yes, 21 but i do not know that for a fact." 22 you know anything is possible 23 theoretically, but we are not talking about 24 theoretics. we are talking about probability, 25 the greater weight of the evidence and they 2753 1 did not prove that. 2 the last thing i want to say, judge, and 3 i'm wrapping up is, they showed you this slide 4 and they said that dr. benowitz said that, 5 within 72 hours of quitting, all the nicotine 6 is gone from the body. 7 that is true, but you know what does not go 8 away for months, and sometimes years, are the 9 cravings. the craving, the desire, that never 10 goes away. 11 on behalf of phil and the sisters, we want 12 to thank you very much and we will accept 13 whatever verdict you render.
