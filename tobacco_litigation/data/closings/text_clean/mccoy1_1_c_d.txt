25 mr. furr: thank you. may it please the court, counsel, mr. mccoy. 2 welcome back from lunch, ladies and 3 gentlemen. 4 the jury panel: thank you. 5 mr. furr: well, we have kept you here for 6 almost three weeks, but this is really a pretty 7 simple case because this is a case about something 8 you learned about in kindergarten, and that is 9 personal responsibility. it a case about taking 10 responsibility for the choices that we make in 11 life. 12 the evidence is overwhelming that 13 mrs. mccoy knew that smoking could cause lung 14 cancer, emphysema, and premature death by the late 15 1950s. 16 so the question for you is going to be, 17 who is responsible for the informed choices that 18 she made, to knowingly take the risk of smoking, 19 despite an awareness of the dangers, and to do so 20 because she loved smoking. 21 that is not my word. that is mr. mccoy's 22 word. and i'm going to show you that in just a 23 moment. 24 as you will see as i go forward, by the 25 1950s, it was recognized in this country that the choices we make about smoking were really a matter 2 of personal responsibility. 3 and i'm going to start by taking you 4 right back to something dr. proctor told us to set 5 the stage for how our society made decisions about 6 cigarette smoking, because dr. proctor told you 7 early on in this case that: cigarettes are 8 inherently dangerous and addictive products that 9 cannot be made safe. 10 you might remember that on 11 cross-examination, i asked dr. proctor: would not 12 it be true that if you took a leaf off a plant, 13 dried it, burned that leaf, that you would create 14 a smoke that has carcinogens and nicotine in it, 15 and which would be dangerous and addictive and 16 cause lung cancer and heart disease and emphysema 17 and premature death if you smoked enough of it? 18 and he said: absolutely correct. 19 i also asked dr. proctor: is not it true 20 that cigarettes cannot be made safe? 21 and he told you: the only safe 22 cigarette is a cigarette that is not smoked. 23 so it is an inherently dangerous and 24 addictive product that cannot be made safe. 25 now a couple issues were suggested to you this morning. i want to sort of clear the air 2 on a couple things. 3 this issue of inhalability, you were 4 told this morning that the tobacco companies made 5 cigarettes inhalable, but dr. proctor told you 6 that cigarettes have always been inhalable. 7 it is the nature of the product, that 8 native americans were smoking inhalable cigarettes 9 in this country before lorillard, philip morris, 10 or rj reynolds ever made their first cigarette, 11 and that inhalable cigarettes were being smoked 12 halfway around the world in the middle east 13 because people would cure their tobacco on the 14 roofs of their house in an environment that caused 15 the sugars to stay in the tobacco, and thus it was 16 inhalable. 17 you were also -- this morning there was 18 some argument made to you about additives, which 19 you might remember what dr. proctor told you, that 20 additives make no difference, that an 21 additive-free cigarette is no safer or less 22 addictive than a cigarette with additives. 23 because dr. proctor used that expression to you, 24 he said: the rubicon, crossing the rubicon with 25 respect to the dangers of tobacco is the combustion. 2 when you burn the tobacco, that is the 3 smoke that you create. it is nothing that is done 4 during the manufacturing process. it is the 5 inherent property of the product. 6 well, in the 1950s, dr. proctor as 7 explained to you, there was a great deal of new 8 scientific information released about the dangers 9 of smoking. 10 there were human epidemiologic studies 11 showing that smokers were developing more lung 12 cancer and dying sooner than nonsmokers. 13 there were animal skin painting studies 14 that you saw on multiple occasions showing that 15 when you paint a tar on the backs of laboratory 16 mice, they would grow papillomas, which were 17 cancerous. 18 and there were early chemistry studies 19 that came out showing that there were toxins and 20 carcinogens being found in cigarette smoke. 21 all of that was made public, widely 22 circulated in both the scientific and lay media, 23 common knowledge in the early 1950s. 24 at that point, our society had a choice 25 to make. society could have banned cigarettes. that is something that could have been done, but 2 that is not what was done. 3 our society decided that adults would be 4 free to make choices about how they lived their 5 lives, including whether to smoke cigarettes or 6 not. 7 we live in america, the land of the 8 free, and we just celebrated the 4th of july, 9 which of course is independence day. 10 it is a celebration of our rights as 11 american citizens to make choices about how we 12 want to live our lives. 13 but, of course, freedom of choice comes 14 at a cost, and that cost is personal 15 responsibility. because freedom of choice only 16 works if individuals also take responsibility for 17 their actions, because freedom of choice without 18 responsibility would just be chaos. it would just 19 be chaos. 20 this was recognized a long time ago in 21 this society, and i'm going to take you back and 22 show you some examples that you saw during trial. 23 and i'm going to start with the 1955 24 video that the plaintiffs actually showed you 25 during dr. proctor's direct examination. it was the edward r. murrow show in 2 which that famous scientist who had done some of 3 the groundbreaking work named dr. hammond was 4 interviewed on television, and he said it better 5 than i could ever say it. so let us look at what 6 he said. 7 (video clip played as follows:) 8 voice: good evening. this is see it 9 now, produced by the partnership of friendly and 10 murrow. tonight, the first of two reports on 11 cigarettes and lung cancer. 12 voice: in 1952, drs. hammond and horn 13 of the american cancer society began an extended 14 study of the smoking habits of american men. here 15 is dr. hammond reporting on the results of the 16 first two years. 17 voice: it is now established, in my 18 opinion, beyond a reasonable doubt, that cigarette 19 smoking greatly increases the probability of 20 developing lung cancer. 21 in my opinion, people can be warned of 22 the dangers, and they are being warned. what they 23 then want to do, whether they wish to smoke or 24 not, is their own business. 25 (video clip concluded.) 1 mr. furr: 1955, people were being 2 warned, but it was their own business as to 3 whether or not to take the risk that accompany 4 cigarette smoking. 5 the only person that might say it better 6 than dr. hammond was harry reasoner, who was also 7 played to you by plaintiffs during the direct 8 examination of dr. proctor where harry reasoner 9 was the anchor on one of those television shows in 10 which the results of the 1964 surgeon general's 11 report were being presented to the country on the 12 night that that report was released. 13 so let us take a look at what harry 14 reasoner said. 15 (video clip played as follows:) 16 voice: this is a cbs news extra on 17 smoking and health, the findings of the surgeon 18 general committee. 19 voice: almost from the moment that 20 cigarettes were introduced, they were attacked. 21 but the attacks took a new turn ten years ago and 22 culminated in today's report by the surgeon 23 general's committee. 24 this, in summary, is what the committee 25 says: cigarette smoking is a major cause of lung cancer in men, and data on women smokers points 2 the same way. 3 cigarette smoking is a significant cause 4 of cancer of the larynx and probably the most 5 important cause of chronic bronchitis. 6 cigarette smoking may be related to 7 other lung diseases. male smokers have a much 8 higher death rate from heart disease, although 9 it is not proven that smoking is the cause. 10 on the question of filters, the 11 committee says there is no evidence that they do 12 any good, but it did not exclude the possibility 13 that an effective filter might be developed. 14 in short, the committee says: if you 15 smoke cigarettes, you increase your chances of 16 dying early. the sooner you start, the more you 17 smoke, the more you inhale, the worse your chances 18 are. 19 in this kind of a country, it comes down 20 to you, whether you like it or not. no one is 21 going to forbid an adult to smoke. 22 and it is now quite clear that no one is 23 going to tell him it is good for him, either. the 24 decision is his. the decision and the health that 25 may depend on it. this is harry reasoner. good night. 2 (video clip concluded.) 3 mr. furr: in this type of country where 4 we get to make free choices, it really comes down 5 to the individual, whether they like it or not, to 6 make their choices and take responsibility for 7 those choices. 8 from the 1950s on, mrs. mccoy was 9 bombarded with clear, unambiguous, powerful and 10 oftentimes very personalized warnings about the 11 dangers of smoking. 12 i've got a board here i want to put up 13 so we can just remind ourselves what some of those 14 warnings were and the time frame in which they 15 came. 16 the evidence is overwhelming that -- 17 there is a copy of this in your stack, also. 18 the evidence is overwhelming that 19 mrs. mccoy knew about the health effects and 20 addictive nature of smoking throughout her life 21 because we are going to look -- we are going to look 22 at this. 23 but dr. proctor explained to you that 24 there was an abundance of information in society, 25 being taught in schools, reported in the popular media and other sources of information, even at 2 the time that mrs. mccoy was making her initial 3 decisions about becoming a smoker. 4 but she chose to smoke nonetheless. she 5 could have chosen not to start and to have chosen 6 health, but she chose to smoke. 7 mr. mccoy told you that almost 8 immediately, dating back to the 1940s, that she 9 had what he called "a smoker's cough." what is a 10 smoker's cough? 11 it is a warning from your own body that 12 your body is reacting to the smoke that you are 13 inhaling. she could have listened to that warning 14 and stopped, but she chose to continue smoking. 15 and then in 1957, as mr. mccoy told you, 16 his father, alexander, died from lung cancer. and 17 both he and mr. mccoy's mother, hazel, told 18 mrs. mccoy that his father had died from lung 19 cancer and that that cancer was caused by 20 cigarette smoking, as powerful and personalized 21 warning as you can get. 22 i'll show you in a little while, both 23 dr. proctor and dr. prochaska agreed with respect 24 to how powerful that type of warning is for an 25 individual. she could have stopped. she could have 2 chosen health, but she chose to continue smoking. 3 then in the 1960s, both her mother and 4 her father died from lung cancer. and mr. mccoy 5 told you from that witness stand that he told her 6 that both of those deaths had been caused by 7 cigarette smoking. 8 again, she was faced with a choice of 9 whether to quit and choose health or whether to 10 continue smoking and take the risk. 11 and mr. schlesinger suggested to you 12 this morning that somehow this is an inappropriate 13 argument for me to make and i'm trying to take 14 credit for it, i believe was the phrase that he 15 used. 16 these are just the facts. because the 17 most important issue in this case for you is what 18 mrs. mccoy knew, when she knew it, and what she 19 did with that information. 20 mr. mccoy told you about when he worked 21 in the hospital in the 1960s, how he would see 22 patients that had emphysema and other serious 23 diseases and that the doctors and nurses in the 24 hospital would tell him that those diseases were 25 smoking related. and he would come home and tell 2 mrs. mccoy about the patients he was caring for, 3 and he would tell her when they died. 4 he would tell her that he had lost 5 another patient to a disease caused by smoking. 6 and he was doing all this, coupled with urging her 7 to stop smoking because from the 1950s on, as you 8 have heard, mr. mccoy was constantly urging her to 9 stop smoking. 10 mrs. mccoy chose to continue smoking, 11 could have chosen health, but the value that she 12 was receiving from cigarettes and the enjoyment 13 that she got from it, in her mind, outweighed the 14 risk that she was taking. 15 warnings from the surgeon general, from 16 the popular media, news, magazines, tv. you have 17 seen in the 1950s that information started coming 18 out. it was everywhere in society. you saw some 19 of that during the cross-examination of 20 dr. proctor. 21 in each of those opportunities -- each 22 of those instances would have been yet another 23 opportunity for mrs. mccoy to re-evaluate her 24 decision, to make a different decision, but she 25 always chose to continue smoking when she could have chosen health over and over. 2 by the 1960s, of course, pack warnings 3 began appearing on the packs of cigarettes in 4 1966. again, a golden opportunity to quit, 5 because mr. mccoy told you from that stand that in 6 the 1960s when those warnings went on the packs, 7 and they had had three parents die from smoking, 8 that mrs. mccoy knew that there were risks 9 associated with smoking, but she chose to continue 10 smoking, not to quit. 11 now the argument made to you this 12 morning was that all of these choices were made 13 under the influence of being addicted. and that, 14 therefore, somehow her addiction is an excuse for 15 her to continue smoking despite knowing that 16 cigarettes are dangerous. 17 i'm going to show you what the evidence 18 is with respect to whether she was addicted or 19 not, but even if you believe the case that was put 20 on by the plaintiff here, his own experts, which 21 i'm going to remind you of. 22 dr. prochaska told you, the doctor they 23 brought from california to talk about addiction, 24 told you that based upon her review of the whole 25 record, after reading all the depositions, that the earliest she could say that mrs. mccoy was 2 addicted was the 1960s some time. 3 so some time in this time frame here is 4 the earliest dr. prochaska, their expert, can say 5 that mrs. mccoy was addicted. 6 that is critically important because, as 7 is obvious from this board, she had been receiving 8 warnings about the deadly nature of cigarettes and 9 how they could result in serious disease and 10 premature death for a long time when she was 11 hearing those warnings with even -- under 12 circumstances where even their own experts say: 13 she was not addicted yet. she was not addicted yet. 14 i cannot say she was addicted. 15 so all of these decisions were being 16 made prior to a time when she was addicted, 17 according to dr. prochaska. 18 it did not end there. her sons, whom you 19 met a couple of during the trial, as dr. prochaska 20 also told you, began very aggressively warning her 21 in the 1970s about the dangers of smoking. 22 she was fortunate to have 23 daughters-in-law who were health professionals. 24 you remember anita was a nurse who worked in 25 broward general in the cardiology unit, i believe. stacy was an optometrist. 2 they both warned her over and over about 3 emphysema, lung cancer, heart disease and that her 4 smoking might kill her. 5 each of those were opportunities. but 6 she had a choice to make, could have chosen to 7 quit and health, but she chose to continue 8 smoking. that was here. 9 and finally, as you have heard, as the 10 '80s went on, she began -- her symptoms began 11 increasing. her shortness of breath got worse. 12 her cough got worse. 13 but until she had her heart attack, she 14 chose to continue taking her chances with 15 cigarettes because she valued the benefit that she 16 perceived from cigarettes. 17 and ultimately, she quit after she had a 18 heart attack. and then, unfortunately, of course, 19 and we are all sympathetic for mr. mccoy's loss, 20 there is no question about that. they had a 21 wonderful marriage. nobody would ever challenge 22 that in any way. 23 unfortunately, she died in 1997. ten 24 years later, this lawsuit was filed. and that is 25 what we are here to discuss, who was responsible for the choices that mrs. mccoy made throughout 2 her life, the informed choices that she made to 3 take the risk of the dangers of smoking despite 4 knowing how dangerous it was, including the years 5 before even her experts say that she was addicted. 6 why did mrs. mccoy smoke? the argument 7 you heard today over and over was she smoked 8 because she was addicted. i want to remind you 9 what mr. mccoy told you from the witness stand. 10 (video clip played as follows:) 11 q. mr. mccoy, mrs. mccoy would enjoy having 12 a cigarette before and after her coffee, for 13 example? 14 a. yeah, right. 15 q. and ms. mccoy loved to smoke after she 16 ate, right? 17 a. yeah. mrs. mccoy loved to smoke, 18 period. 19 (video clip concluded.) 20 mr. furr: mrs. mccoy loved to smoke, 21 period, that is what mr. mccoy told us. he was not 22 pressured. he was not harassed. he volunteered 23 that she simply loved to smoke, period. that is 24 why she smoked. 25 okay. let us turn to the issues in this case. plaintiffs have the burden of proof in this 2 case to prove mrs. mccoy's case because we are in 3 a case that is about mrs. mccoy. 4 we are only here to decide the issues -- 5 you are only here to decide the issues relating to 6 one smoker. 7 the class action is over. it is not 8 about smokers in general. you will see your 9 verdict form relates to mrs. mccoy, and the 10 plaintiffs have failed to prove their case about 11 mrs. mccoy. 12 they failed on several fronts, including 13 these: they did not prove that she was a member 14 of the engle class, as i'm going to address in 15 just a moment. 16 they did not prove that she died because 17 of the dangers of smoking were unknown to her. 18 and as we walk through the verdict form 19 today and the instructions -- 20 mr. schlesinger: excuse me, i'm sorry. 21 excuse me, judge. misstates the instructions on 22 the law and the issues in the case. i object. 23 the court: ladies and gentlemen, you 24 are to rely on the instructions that i gave you. 25 that contains the law. this is counsel's argument, a chance to persuade you to reach a 2 verdict in favor of his clients' position. 3 counsel, proceed. 4 mr. furr: thank you. 5 we will look at the verdict form 6 together and we will look at the relevant 7 instructions. in fact, i've highlighted portions 8 of the relevant instructions. 9 and you will see that they can be 10 reduced to the question of: did she die because 11 the dangers of smoking were unknown to her or 12 otherwise unavailable? 13 mr. schlesinger: excuse me, judge. 14 mr. furr: that is the language you are 15 going to see. 16 mr. schlesinger: i object, your honor. 17 that is not a question on the verdict form, and i 18 object. it misstates the law that your honor has 19 instructed on. 20 the court: thank you. i ruled on that, 21 counsel. 22 ladies and gentlemen, again, i have 23 given you a set of the jury instructions. they 24 have the law. this is client's argument. 25 and proceed. 1 mr. furr: thank you, your honor. 2 hold me to it. i'll show you with the 3 instruction and the verdict form why this is the 4 question. 5 finally, you will see that the 6 plaintiffs did not prove that mrs. mccoy's estate 7 is entitled to money damages because she smoked 8 knowing the risk that she was taking for decades. 9 let us go to the verdict form. your 10 verdict form question 1, which you saw in part, is 11 going to be the class membership question. if the 12 answers are no to these questions, then the case 13 is over because if mrs. mccoy is not a class 14 member, as the evidence demonstrates, then you 15 write, no, sign this verdict form, and your 16 deliberations are done. 17 the question you will answer is this: 18 was glodine mccoy addicted to cigarettes 19 containing nicotine, and, if so, was such 20 addiction a legal cause of her chronic obstructive 21 pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, 22 peripheral vascular disease, and lung cancer? 23 so embedded in that top question in the 24 bold are really two questions. we talked about 25 this during opening statement. what the plaintiffs have to prove to you are two things. 2 they have to prove to you that mrs. mccoy was 3 addicted to nicotine. that is the first thing they 4 have to prove. 5 but then they also have to prove that 6 that addiction was a legal cause of her death on 7 the wrongful death claim. they have to prove both 8 of them. one is not enough. 9 if they prove that she was addicted but 10 you conclude that her addiction was not the legal 11 cause of her death, then the answer under the 12 instruction you have should be no. 13 and so we are going to look at both of 14 those questions separately. we will start with the 15 issue of: did the plaintiffs prove to you that 16 mrs. mccoy was addicted to nicotine in cigarettes? 17 and let us launch into the evidence on 18 that. as dr. agharkar explained to you 19 yesterday and the day before, fifty percent of 20 smokers in the united states are not addicted. 50 21 percent are; fifty percent are not. 22 you have to decide which fifty percent 23 mrs. mccoy fit into. and dr. agharkar explained 24 to you his analysis under the dsm with respect to 25 where mrs. mccoy fit, and i'm going to look at that with you. 2 but one of the things -- arguments that 3 was made to you throughout this case was that 4 being a long-term, daily smoker of a pack of 5 cigarettes a day was really all that you needed to 6 know to answer the question of whether she was 7 addicted, because why else would someone smoke 8 that much? 9 but then mr. keehfus cross-examined 10 dr. prochaska. and when he did so, here's what 11 she told us, that daily smoking does not prove 12 addiction. 13 under cross-examination she said that: 14 smoking one pack per day does not necessarily mean 15 that the smoker is addicted and that a smoker can 16 smoke a pack a day and not be addicted. 17 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor. 18 that mischaracterizes the testimony. rule of 19 completeness, i'd like him to read that whole 20 answer, if it please the court. 21 the court: counsel, you have a chance 22 to redirect. ladies and gentlemen, you are to 23 rely on your own recollection of the evidence. 24 mr. furr: so why do people smoke if 25 it is not addiction? we have already heard mr. mccoy tell you that mrs. mccoy loved to smoke, period. 2 but we cross-examined -- or on direct 3 examination, we asked the experts questions about: 4 why do people smoke? and here's what you were 5 told. i've combined dr. agharkar's and 6 dr. prochaska's answers. and that is: people 7 smoke for many reasons, enjoyment, pleasure, like 8 mrs. mccoy, relaxation, taste, social interaction, 9 to relieve anxiety, alleviate boredom, habit or 10 hobby -- 11 you might remember that at one point 12 mr. mccoy told you that smoking was, in his 13 judgment, ms. mccoy's hobby. 14 -- after meals or with coffee, or simply 15 to get a break from their routine. 16 a few of the things mr. mccoy told us 17 about mrs. mccoy's smoking. he told us that she 18 smoked, that she got pleasure from smoking, that 19 it relieved stress, that she liked the taste, that 20 she liked it with her meals, that she smoked 21 before and after she had her coffee, and he told 22 you that smoking was her "hobby." that was his 23 word that he volunteered. 24 a couple things -- more things that 25 mr. mccoy told us is that: glo always wanted to smoke, that glodine mccoy never asked mr. mccoy to 2 help her quit smoking, that mrs. mccoy would say 3 that she did not want to stop smoking. 4 dr. agharkar told you that based on his 5 clinical experience -- and we are going to talk 6 about why dr. agharkar was brought to you and why 7 he is the right witness to answer the questions 8 that you have to answer here -- but that there are 9 smokers who know that smoking is dangerous and do 10 not want to quit, and mrs. mccoy was one of those 11 smokers. and he told you that until she had her 12 heart attack, she simply was not sincerely 13 motivated to quit smoking. 14 yesterday on redirect examination, he 15 told you some more things that are important to 16 understand because you are being told that she 17 smoked because she was addicted and that she no 18 longer had freedom of choice with respect to her 19 smoking. 20 here's what dr. agharkar told you: that 21 ms. mccoy never lost control of her smoking, that 22 she never smoked against her will, that she was 23 never an involuntary smoker, and that she could 24 quit at any time, and that she was not addicted. 25 i want to talk about dr. agharkar for just a moment. you saw him on that witness stand. 2 he was an intelligent, compassionate, dedicated 3 doctor, committed to his patients whom he takes 4 care of to deal with their severe and highly 5 disruptive psychiatric illnesses. 6 that is how he spends his time. he also 7 has expertise in forensic psychiatry, and that is 8 helping judges and juries and other legal 9 decision-makers understand how issues of 10 psychiatry might influence and inform the 11 decisions they have to make. 12 and for that, he was ridiculed and mocked and 13 belittled 14 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor. 15 move to strike. 16 the court: sustained. jurors disregard 17 the last comment. 18 mr. furr: you saw the cross-examination 19 of dr. agharkar. he was not asked a single 20 question about his dsm analysis. instead the 21 whole time was spent asking him questions about 22 what he is not. 23 he had already volunteered that he is a 24 treater, in the trenches taking care of people 25 with substance abuse problems and nicotine addiction. 2 that is what he does, unlike any other 3 witness in this case as i'll show you in just a 4 moment. but instead of asking questions about 5 that, he was asked about things that he is not. 6 well, anybody could be cross-examined 7 for a month about things they are not. it is not 8 what he is not that matters. it is what he is that 9 matters. 10 dr. agharkar told you that mrs. mccoy 11 did not meet the dsm-5 diagnostic criteria for 12 nicotine addiction. 13 and he spent some time explaining to you 14 that psychiatrists do not run around placing labels 15 of psychiatric illnesses, for which tobacco use 16 disorder and nicotine addiction is one, on people 17 for no good reason. 18 that they place those labels on people 19 when people have a problem, not just because 20 they are using cigarettes or smoking cigarettes, 21 but that you only diagnose somebody as having a 22 tobacco use disorder or addicted if they have a 23 severe tobacco use disorder, if it is a problem in 24 their life, if it is causing them clinical 25 impairment, if it is disrupting their life. and as was explained to you a couple 2 times, if it rises to the level of it is all they 3 can think about, it is all they can think about as 4 they go through their daily lives, that is a 5 problem, that is a problem if it is keeping them 6 from doing other things they want to be doing. 7 but if they are simply using a product and it is not 8 causing them stress and it is not impairing their 9 ability to go through life, then you do not place a 10 psychiatric disease label on them. 11 now why did we bring you dr. agharkar 12 instead of a nicotine researcher? we brought you 13 dr. agharkar because he is the only witness you 14 heard of during this trial who has treated 15 thousands of patients for substance abuse. 16 the plaintiffs have the burden of proof 17 in this case. they brought you a pulmonologist, 18 and they brought you a ph.d. psychiatrist who does 19 research on populations, in general. but they 20 did not bring you anybody who is down in the 21 trenches working with meth addicts and heroin 22 addicts and cocaine addicts and alcohol addicts, 23 and, for that matter, nicotine addicts. 24 it is dr. agharkar who does that as part 25 of his professional life. and you did get an opportunity to evaluate his demeanor, and you can 2 reach your own conclusions about the reliability 3 of dr. agharkar's testimony. 4 who did plaintiff bring you? well, they 5 brought you dr. mannino, a pulmonologist, 6 highly-credentialed pulmonologist, but he is a lung 7 doctor, not an addiction specialist. 8 and at this stage of his career, he told 9 you he really only sees patients two days a month. 10 and in one of the most revealing parts of the 11 cross-examination, he admitted that he had never 12 seen the dsm before. 13 the test that both dr. prochaska and 14 dr. agharkar used to evaluate mrs. mccoy was 15 something dr. mannino had never even seen. 16 they also brought you dr. prochaska, 17 prolific researcher, no question about it, but 18 she is not a clinician. she does not have a 19 clinical practice. she is not a medical doctor. 20 she does not have medical privileges anywhere. 21 instead, as she explained to you over 22 and over, she works with participants, not 23 patients. she works with study subjects. she is 24 not down in the trenches helping people deal with 25 psychiatric or psychological illnesses and break addictions. 2 ladies and gentlemen, i submit to you 3 that when you look closely at the testimony of 4 plaintiff's experts, dr. mannino and 5 dr. prochaska, they are really not going to be very 6 helpful to you in answering the question of 7 whether ms. mccoy was addicted. for among other 8 reasons, their testimony was completely 9 inconsistent and cannot be reconciled with each 10 other. 11 and here's how it all came to peak. 12 dr. mannino insisted on cross-examination that 13 anyone who smokes one cigarette per day is 14 addicted. 15 dr. prochaska conceded on 16 cross-examination that you can smoke one pack per 17 day and not be addicted. 18 mr. schlesinger: judge, objection. 19 it is -- it mischaracterizes testimony, and it is 20 not even an answer from the deposition. it 21 does not have page and line. it is not even the 22 complete answer. it is an excerpt. 23 mr. furr: your honor, i object. it is a 24 speaking objection. 25 the court: your objection is overruled. ladies and gentlemen, you are to rely on 2 your own recollection of the evidence. 3 mr. schlesinger: may i approach, 4 judge. 5 the court: sure. 6 7 sidebar:) 8 the court: yes, sir. 9 mr. schlesinger: all my boards have 10 page and line. if it please the court, all my 11 exhibits have page and line so you can always go 12 to the page and line. 13 that quote does not appear in this 14 record, except they might have taken out six words 15 in the middle of a sentence. 16 your honor said: okay. i have to fix 17 it on redirect, and i will, but i have to have the 18 page number. i say it is not fair to put an 19 excerpt in there because it is misleading, but more 20 importantly, i at least -- it has to at least 21 indicate the page number. 22 otherwise, i've got to go through 300 23 pages of transcript to try to find how they 24 excised a piece of the transcript in the middle of 25 a depo, and it is just not fair. 1 the court: i'm sure -- a couple things. 2 number one is regarding the excerpts of his 3 testimony, i thought all these exhibits were 4 exchanged beforehand. 5 mr. tepikian: they were. 6 the court: there were not any objections 7 about it. if you have the line and page number, 8 i'm sure counsel's associates here, mr. leppert, 9 can get you line and page number. so if you think 10 there is a mischaracterization, you can correct it 11 on redirect. 12 counsel is making a good-faith 13 representation, at least that is the way i take it, 14 that this is testimony. 15 when it comes up, you are suggesting it is 16 not testimony. it is out of context. i tell the 17 jury, as i do all the time, you are to rely on your 18 own recollection of the evidence. 19 and i do not have a photographic memory. 20 i do not know exactly what the witnesses said. i 21 know the gist of the testimony that was done. i 22 keep notes. 23 but, again, just like the juries do, 24 it is their recollection of the evidence that 25 counts, all right? your objection is noted. it is 2 overruled. 3 mr. leppert, mr. leppert, i'm sorry, 4 sir, you can get him to quote the line and page 5 numbers for this case? 6 mr. leppert: yes. 7 the court: thank you. 8 (the sidebar discussion was concluded 9 and the following was held in open court:) 10 the court: mr. furr, are you ready to 11 proceed? 12 mr. furr: yes, sir. thank you. 13 the court: ladies and gentlemen, as i 14 indicated before, you are to rely on your own 15 recollection of the evidence. this is counsel's 16 chance at argument, to persuade you as to what his 17 recollection of the evidence is and how it should 18 be interpreted in this case. 19 proceed, counsel. 20 mr. furr: thank you. 21 from that witness stand, right in front 22 of you-all, dr. mannino said: one cigarette per 23 day is enough. dr. prochaska said: you can even 24 smoke a pack a day and not be addicted. she would 25 have to know more information. they cannot prove their case with inconsistent expert testimony that 2 cannot be reconciled. 3 i suggest to you, ladies and gentlemen, 4 that the evidence really demonstrates that 5 mrs. mccoy smoked for reasons other than 6 addiction. she loved to smoke, period, as 7 mr. mccoy told us, that she did not have a problem 8 with her smoking. it was not disrupting her life. 9 she was not clinically impaired. she did not ideate 10 over smoking all day so that she was unable to 11 accomplish other things. 12 as dr. agharkar explained to you, she 13 does not meet the dsm criteria. she simply was not 14 addicted to nicotine in cigarettes. 15 so, ladies and gentlemen, for those 16 reasons, that applies to all the disease states. 17 it is the same issue for each of them. 18 i suggest to you that when you get to 19 verdict form question 1, the evidence demonstrates 20 that she simply was not addicted to nicotine and 21 that your answer should be no, sign and date your 22 verdict form, and this case is over. 23 but even if she was addicted, if you 24 conclude that she was addicted, as i said, there 25 are two parts to the class membership question. and the second is they have to prove that 2 addiction was a legal cause of mrs. mccoy's death, 3 a legal cause of her death. 4 that is kind of an odd concept, probably 5 never thought much about that before you got here, 6 but there is sort of a simple, common sense way to 7 think about that. and that is this: was 8 mrs. mccoy so powerfully addicted that she was 9 compelled to smoke and unable to quit and thus 10 prevent any smoking-related disease, or, or, did 11 mrs. mccoy want to keep smoking even though she 12 had the ability to quit at any time and prevent 13 any smoking-related disease? 14 it is really an either/or question. both 15 of those cannot be true at the same time for the 16 same smoker. 17 what do we know about addiction and 18 quitting? we know that all the experts agreed 19 that addiction does not mean that a smoker cannot 20 quit and that addicted smokers quit every day in 21 this country. and as dr. agharkar explained to 22 you, any smoker can quit. any smoker can quit. 23 all the evidence points in one 24 direction. there is no evidence that addicted -- 25 being addicted means that you simply cannot quit. a couple of very important concessions 2 obtained on cross-examination from plaintiff's 3 experts are these: dr. altschuler conceded that 4 addiction does not stop a person from having the 5 choice to quit. 6 and dr. mannino went even farther. he 7 said that being addicted to nicotine does not 8 relieve a smoker of responsibility to quit 9 smoking. 10 now there was a lot said during the 11 trial and during closing argument this morning 12 about why smokers did not quit and about how the 13 design of the cigarette had something to do with 14 it, about how the advertising campaigns kept 15 people from quitting, about how the statements 16 made by the companies prevented people from 17 quitting, that this, quote, campaign of confusion 18 and doubt prevented people from quitting. but you 19 know that is not true. 20 we cross-examined plaintiff's experts, 21 and they conceded, the campaign of doubt does not 22 prevent quitting. 23 this modern american cigarette, the 24 design of it, did not prevent smokers from 25 quitting. advertising does not prevent smokers from 2 quitting, and even these brain changes that we 3 spent some time on, although finally dr. agharkar 4 explained to us that is simply how the human brain 5 works, we think, through the release of 6 neurotransmitters, that is how our brains work, but 7 that does not prevent anybody from quitting. 8 and how do you know that? we know that 9 because dr. proctor conceded that millions and 10 millions of heavy smokers quit while mrs. mccoy 11 chose to continue smoking. 12 dr. proctor, on cross-examination, told 13 you that 9 million smokers quit between 1960 and 14 1965. that is one year after the surgeon general 15 report. that the heaviest period of quitting in 16 this country was right after the first warning 17 label went on the pack. between 1966 and 1970, 13 18 million people quit. and you might recall 19 dr. proctor told you, if you do the math, that is 20 about 7,000 people a day. 21 and that between '64 and '74, 30 million 22 people quit. and you add it up over time, by 23 1974, 45 million people had quit. 24 and the point is, that is when the 25 tobacco companies were advertising cigarettes. that is when the tobacco companies were debating 2 and disputing that smoking is dangerous and 3 addictive. 4 that is when the advertising campaigns 5 were being run about the products that you saw. 6 so all of that was going on, but it did not stop 7 people from quitting. it did not stop people from 8 quitting. 9 and, of course, as you heard, all of 10 those smokers who were long-term, heavy smokers 11 would have had those type of brain changes that 12 were discussed with respect to how nicotine 13 affects the brain, but it does not stop people from 14 quitting. it just does not do it. 15 dr. prochaska suggested to you that 16 smokers are caught in an addiction cycle. and you 17 might remember she said that what begins as a 18 choice, which even she concedes is a choice -- in 19 this case, i guess the choice extended to the 20 1960s because she says that mrs. mccoy was not 21 addicted, that is the earliest she can identify her 22 as being addicted -- but that it begins as a 23 choice, but then ultimately people get stuck in a 24 cycle of daily use and physical dependence. 25 then on cross-examination, mr. keehfus cross-examined her and said: is not there 2 something missing from this chart? is not there 3 something missing from this chart? because people 4 do not stay in that cycle. they quit. they quit 5 by the tens of millions. 6 as you heard during the trial, 60 7 million americans have quit smoking since the 8 1950s. and they quit because, as dr. mannino 9 said: addiction did not stop mrs. mccoy from 10 having the ability to choose to quit smoking. 11 dr. proctor told you the u.s. smokers 12 started quitting by the millions in the 1950s 13 because they were concerned about the dangers of 14 smoking, and that it was the knowledge they had 15 about the dangers that drove the quitting. 16 dr. prochaska conceded that millions of 17 addicted smokers have gotten out of the addiction 18 cycle. and that starting with the 1964 surgeon 19 general report, people quit at an exponentially 20 faster rate. so this addiction cycle is a false 21 construct. it is not a closed loop. there are off 22 ramps. there are off ramps that people take to 23 quit smoking. 24 during these years, when 45 million 25 americans were quitting prior to 1974, mrs. mccoy, as we looked at our first board, she chose to 2 continue smoking. 3 that is her right. she has every right 4 to make that choice, but with that choice comes a 5 personal responsibility that accompanies knowingly 6 and in an informed manner making the choice to 7 continue using a product that you knew and had 8 been told in a very powerful and personalized way 9 could cause lung cancer, emphysema, and premature 10 death. 11 here's what dr. prochaska actually told 12 me, that the earliest that she could conclude that 13 mrs. mccoy was addicted was in the 1960s, 14 depending on if it is 1960 or 1969, mrs. mccoy 15 would have been in the range of 33 to 43 years 16 old. 17 you know, one of the things that was 18 argued to you is that addiction is a pediatric 19 disease, that if people do not become addicted in 20 their adolescent years, that they will never become 21 smokers. but dr. prochaska told you that after 22 reviewing everything, the earliest she could say 23 ms. mccoy was addicted was 1960 when she was 33 24 years old. 25 let us think about what that means, the chart we looked at earlier. the earliest she 2 could conclude would have been somewhere in this 3 range (indicating). so think about all of the 4 information that mrs. mccoy received and all the 5 choices she made, would even, under 6 dr. prochaska's view of the facts of this case, 7 she was making all of these choices to continue 8 smoking prior to becoming addicted, or at least 9 dr. prochaska being able to conclude that she was 10 addicted. 11 addiction is not an excuse for not 12 quitting. 13 we talked about 60 million people quit. 14 60 million people quit. why did not mrs. mccoy 15 quit when 60 million other people quit? was she 16 different than the millions and millions of 17 addicted smokers who quit? were her cigarettes 18 more addictive? no, there is no evidence of that. 19 was her brain affected differently than 20 the smokers who quit? there is no evidence of 21 that. was she exposed to advertising different 22 than smokers who quit? no evidence of that. 23 was she exposed to tobacco company 24 statements denying the dangers of smoking that 25 were different than the statements that people who quit were exposed to? no evidence of that. 2 did she smoke more or longer than 3 smokers who quit? no. dr. proctor told you that 4 somewhere between a third and a half of the people 5 who were quitting throughout those decades were 6 smoking a pack a day. 7 there is only one reason why mrs. mccoy 8 kept smoking when other people quit, and that is 9 because she wanted to smoke. she loved to smoke. 10 but then, of course, once she became motivated to 11 quit because she developed a health problem, she 12 quit easily. 13 i skipped one. this is important. 14 dr. prochaska told you that based upon 15 all the depositions she read, she saw instances in 16 which mrs. mccoy simply said she did not want to 17 stop smoking when she was confronted with 18 information by mr. mccoy about the dangers of 19 smoking. 20 mr. mccoy told you, i will not belabor 21 this, that she simply loved to smoke, period. she 22 liked to smoke, she did not want to quit, and she 23 wanted to continue smoking. 24 and then there was an exchange that i 25 think is very revealing because actually it is a window into how mrs. mccoy was really thinking 2 about her smoking decisions. and that is this, on 3 cross-examination, mr. mccoy told you all this. 4 mr. mccoy told you that there were 5 instances in which he would approach mrs. mccoy 6 and tell her: you have got to stop smoking. 7 and her answer would be: i'm not old. 8 i'm not sick. 9 and he would tell her: you are going to 10 get old, and you are going to get sick if you keep 11 smoking. 12 and her response would be to light a 13 cigarette. 14 you were told by the experts, by 15 dr. agharkar especially yesterday, what people do 16 when they want to quit, that it takes motivation 17 and persistence, that there are a series of steps 18 you can take. 19 if you are serious about quitting, you 20 can develop a plan to quit, set dates, ask people 21 for help, throw away your ashtrays, your 22 cigarettes, join a smoking cessation group. 23 mr. mccoy even encouraged her to 24 participate in the great american smokeout. 25 mrs. mccoy did not do any of those things because she did not want to quit. 2 she wanted to continue smoking until she 3 got sick, and then she quit. in the late 1980s, 4 she had her heart attack, or maybe it was early 5 '90s, not an issue we have to worry about anymore, 6 but after she had her heart attack, she quit and 7 she quit cold turkey. 8 she did not ask anybody for help. she 9 did not even tell mr. mccoy she was going to do it. 10 and what did he tell us about what her experience 11 was like? did she go through severe withdrawal? 12 did she have multiple relapses over and over? no, 13 none of those things. 14 he said that she was a little bit 15 irritable about silly household things, like if he 16 forgot to take the trash out. and he said there 17 came a time afterwards when she actually became 18 more pleasant after she quit smoking. 19 and, importantly, she did not relapse. 20 the undisputed testimony in this case is that 21 after she quit when she had a heart attack, she 22 never smoked again, never smoked again. 23 dr. agharkar told you that her ability 24 to quit smoking in 1989 was no different than her 25 ability to quit smoking would have been in the '60s, '70s, or early in the '80s. she always had 2 the ability to quit. but for her, the balance 3 between her enjoyment and the danger she was 4 taking swung this way in favor of continuing to 5 smoke until she got sick, and then it swung back 6 the other way and she became motivated, sincerely 7 motivated to quit. and she did it, and she did it 8 rather easily. 9 mr. schlesinger previewed all this 10 today, but as you know, when people are confronted 11 with information, most of the time her response 12 would be in the nature of: mind your own 13 business. do not start. shut up. in other words, 14 do not bug me about this. i've heard what you are 15 going to say. i've made my choice. i'm going to 16 continue smoking. 17 so, ladies and gentlemen, for all of 18 those reasons, that is a second reason why 19 mrs. mccoy fails the class membership issue. and 20 if you get passed addiction, with respect to 21 whether she was addicted, she clearly fails the 22 issue of whether or not addiction was the cause of 23 her disease. because the only thing that was a 24 cause of her disease was her decision to continue 25 smoking because she valued what she was getting from smoking as opposed to quitting even though 2 she had the ability to do so at any time. 3 there is a third reason why, for at least 4 two of the diseases, mrs. mccoy fails the class 5 membership test. and that, as you were told -- 6 this is -- you will see this instruction 8 on page 7 9. i will not read it all to you right now, but 8 basically this is the instruction. it tells you 9 what plaintiffs have to prove to prove to you 10 whether smoking was a cause of a particular 11 disease. 12 and what i would highlight for you is 13 you would see that: so that it can be reasonably 14 said that but for the smoking of the defendants' 15 cigarettes, that the injury would not have 16 occurred. "but for," it is right there in the 17 middle of the instruction. 18 and so the important part of this test 19 for this case, for the cvd and the -- and the -- 20 and pvd -- the cad and the pvd is this "but for" 21 causation test. 22 and dr. altschuler told you what the 23 answer is on this. dr. altschuler told you that 24 mrs. mccoy had multiple significant risk factors 25 other than smoking: her high cholesterol, her high blood pressure, her family history. 2 and there was a moment when, on direct 3 examination by plaintiff's counsel he was asked: 4 was not smoking a higher risk factor, a more 5 significant risk factor than these other things? 6 and he refused to go there. he would not go there. 7 he said they were all significant risk factors. 8 more importantly, here's what he said on 9 cross-examination: that not only -- not only are 10 they all major risk factors, but that she would 11 not have developed coronary artery disease if her 12 risk factors were adequately controlled and if she 13 were compliant. but we know that her risk factors 14 were not adequately controlled, and we know that 15 she was not a compliant patient. and you saw that 16 on the one document where you saw how her blood 17 pressures continued to be elevated. her 18 cholesterol was also elevated. 19 so addiction is irrelevant to what 20 caused the cad and the pvd because plaintiffs have 21 been able -- unable to carry their burden of proof 22 to show you that but for her smoking, she would 23 not have developed those diseases. because 24 dr. altschuler told you that she would not have 25 developed the cad if her risk factors were adequately controlled and she was compliant. 2 thus, for those diseases, we go back for cad, 3 coronary artery disease, and for pvd, peripheral 4 vascular disease, there is yet another reason. 5 there only has to be one reason for each 6 disease, but for those diseases, there is actually 7 three reasons why mrs. mccoy is not an engle class 8 member. 9 how's my time, jason? 10 mr. keehfus: you are less than an 11 hour. 12 mr. furr: less than an hour. okay. 13 all right. let us go to another very 14 important part of the verdict form. i'm not going 15 to cover each and every question. 16 mr. tepikian is also going to present a 17 closing argument at the end of the case on behalf 18 of philip morris. in order to use our time 19 appropriately, we split it up. i'm not going to 20 cover everything, but the next question i'm going 21 to cover is the two questions you will see on your 22 verdict form. 23 do you have a copy of the verdict form? 24 what numbers are those? are they 6 and 7? 25 mr. tepikian: yes. mr. furr: questions 6 and 7 will be the 2 questions you get on your verdict form -- i hit 3 the button inadvertently. 4 question 6 deals with this issue of 5 whether or not concealment of information was a 6 cause of mrs. mccoy's death. question 7 deals 7 with whether an agreement to conceal was a cause 8 of ms. mccoy's death. 9 and the answer to this is pretty simple. 10 you cannot injure somebody by concealing 11 information from them if they already know it. if 12 they already know it, then no concealment or 13 agreement to conceal could cause the injury 14 because they already know the information. 15 the plaintiffs have the burden to prove 16 to you that it was a concealment or agreement to 17 conceal or both that was the cause of her death, 18 and they cannot prove either. 19 you probably remember dr. proctor 20 telling you that it had been known for centuries, 21 people had been writing and talking about the 22 dangers of smoking. 23 you know what, i'm going to go back and 24 look at this. 25 this is the instruction i told you i would look at. you will see instructions 11 and 2 12 on pages 13 and 15 of your instructions that 3 deal with the -- the first one is the fraudulent 4 concealment claim and the second is the agreement 5 to conceal claim. 6 i'll use the first one to illustrate the 7 important point for both instructions. 8 the next claim you must consider is 9 plaintiff's claim for fraudulent concealment. on 10 this claim, the issue for your determination is 11 whether glodine mccoy reasonably relied to her 12 detriment on any statement of material fact by 13 each defendant that concealed or omitted 14 information not otherwise known or available to 15 her -- in other words, the information was unknown 16 by her -- concerning the health effects or 17 addictive nature of smoking cigarettes. and if 18 so, whether such reliance was a legal cause of 19 glodine mccoy's injuries. 20 and you see the same operative language 21 in the bottom instruction, number 12 on page 15. 22 so it is, was it known or available to her? 23 that is the issue you need to look at 24 when you consider the concealment and agreement to 25 conceal claims on number 6 and 7 on your verdict form. 2 it talks about dr. proctor. he gave you 3 the background of how the information has been 4 available for a long, long time. for over a 5 hundred years, people have been teaching children 6 in school. 7 the information has been in the public 8 arena and available for a long, long time, but we 9 do not even have to go there because we have 10 information about much more personalized warnings 11 that mrs. mccoy got. 12 for one, we know that she and mr. mccoy 13 lived until she was 50 years old in the news 14 capital of the world. you saw evidence on 15 dr. proctor's cross-examination that the dangers 16 of smoking were extensively covered in new york 17 newspapers. 18 the public health organizations like the 19 american cancer society were very active in new 20 york, and that the new york health department 21 itself, in addition to everything else that was 22 going on, published bulletins that were 23 distributed throughout the state encouraging local 24 health authorities to provide that information to 25 the public. and here's what we know. it is 2 undisputed that mrs. mccoy was a voracious reader. 3 she was a consumer of information, a consumer of 4 news. she read multiple newspapers and magazines, 5 including the new york times, the post, the daily 6 news, the long island press. 7 you remember her sons had paper routes, 8 so they were bringing home lots of papers in the 9 home. she read magazines, news day, newsweek, 10 reader's digest. 11 and dr. proctor told you about the type 12 of information that was being provided to people 13 who read those. 14 and maybe the most important thing he 15 told you was that it would take forever, his word, 16 "forever" to read all of the information that was 17 being provided to the public about the dangers of 18 smoking. 19 mr. keehfus: jeff. 20 mr. furr: thank you. 21 mr. furr: let us talk about the 22 information being provided to mrs. mccoy. 23 this also is in your packet. 24 you saw this in opening statement. 25 you have now seen the evidence proving each and every one of these sources of information that 2 mrs. mccoy was receiving. 3 you have heard that mr. mccoy constantly 4 warned her about the dangers throughout their 5 life. that when their parents died, mr. mccoy and 6 his mother warned mrs. mccoy that their parents 7 had died from smoking -- excuse me, from lung 8 cancer and that that smoking -- excuse me, that 9 lung cancer was being caused by smoking. 10 we have talked about information mr. mccoy 11 brought home from his workplace in the hospital. 12 the warnings she was getting from her own body, 13 the shortness of breath. how her 14 daughters-in-law, both anita and stacy were 15 providing her information about cardiovascular 16 disease, emphysema, lung cancer, premature death. 17 that her sons starting warning her aggressively in 18 the 1970s. 19 and that was sort of the inner circle of 20 information she was getting, but, of course, she 21 lived in the broader society like everybody else. 22 and so she had access to information 23 from public health groups, schools, mass media. 24 you have heard about the family using slang. i'll 25 go back to that. of course, the warning labels began 2 appearing on every pack of cigarettes in 1966, in 3 cigarette advertisements in 1971. she lived in 4 new york, the media capital. 5 you know they had house rules. she and 6 mr. mccoy, and this illustrates a lot in this 7 case, they did not allow the children to smoke 8 because they knew it was not good for them. 9 she had her smoker's cough. and, of 10 course, in addition to the new york agencies, the 11 federal and state regulatory and governmental 12 agencies were bombarding people with information 13 about the dangers. we will look at some of that. 14 but the bottom line is, information about the 15 dangers and addictiveness of smoking was not only 16 always available to her, it was known by her. 17 she was surrounded by information about 18 the dangers and addictiveness of cigarettes, 19 including very personalized, very powerful 20 messages that she was getting from her own family, 21 her in-laws, her son, her husband, her own 22 parents' experiences, her daughters-in-law and her 23 own body. surrounded with information about the 24 dangers, but she chose to continue smoking because 25 she loved to smoke. just a few more things on this subject. 2 dr. proctor told you that an individual can get a 3 very powerful message about the dangers of smoking 4 if they have a family member that develops a 5 disease that they are told is attributable to 6 smoking. 7 dr. prochaska said it in even a more 8 powerful way. dr. prochaska said: once the 9 warning is personalized, the perceived threat goes 10 through the roof, goes through the roof. 11 what could personalize a warning more 12 than having your father-in-law die from lung 13 cancer, that both your husband and your 14 mother-in-law are telling you was caused by his 15 cigarette smoking as they literally beg you to 16 stop smoking, beg her to stop smoking? 17 mr. mccoy, of course, from time to time, 18 he got frustrated with her continued smoking in 19 the face of the knowledge that she had. 20 well, let us go to this first. 21 mr. schlesinger referenced this earlier. 22 mr. mccoy said to her: are you blind? all these 23 people have died from lung cancer. you have got to 24 stop smoking. 25 she was not blind. she was not blinded by nicotine addiction. she got that information back 2 in the '50s and early '60s. 3 and mr. scott mccoy, who you know 4 testified, told you, conceded on cross-examination 5 that he told her: you are going to kill yourself, 6 and you are not going to be around. you are going 7 to kill yourself, and you are not going to be 8 around. 9 how more personalized can the message 10 get than that? 11 now what i started to talk about is 12 mr. mccoy got frustrated with her from time to 13 time. and he would say things like: i want you 14 to quit those gd cancer sticks, glo. 15 cancer sticks is, of course, a cigarette 16 being a stick that can cause cancer. and her 17 response would be: mind your own business, john. 18 mind your own business, john. 19 now i'm not criticizing ms. mccoy. and 20 despite what i said to you this morning, i'm not 21 in any way saying anything bad about mrs. mccoy. 22 she seemed like a nice lady. they had a 23 great family. they had a loving relationship. 24 i'm sure she was in love with her husband and 25 kids. and when we talk about these things, it is not to be critical of ms. mccoy or say that she is 2 a bad person. 3 it is because this illustrates for you 4 what her attitude was about the dangers she was 5 knowingly taking by continuing to smoke. 6 of course she got also information from other 7 sources. we talked about the surgeon general's 8 report. 9 when it came out, dr. proctor told you 10 it was the biggest news story of the century, 11 smoking causing lung cancer, emphysema, 12 bronchitis, premature death, all over the news. 13 more importantly, mr. mccoy told you 14 that he specifically told mrs. mccoy about what he 15 had learned about the report. 16 and he told you that mrs. mccoy believed 17 that the surgeon general was a reliable source of 18 information about smoking, but that she paid no 19 attention to it. 20 that is okay. she gets to make her 21 choices, but with that choice comes the 22 responsibility for that choice. 23 mr. mccoy also told you that in the 24 mid-1960s when that first warning came out and 25 they had had three parents that had passed away from lung cancer, that mrs. mccoy understood that 2 there were health risks associated with smoking, 3 understood at that point in time that there were 4 health risks associated with smoking. 5 and, of course, as dr. agharkar told you 6 yesterday -- you know, they put that slide up in 7 front of dr. agharkar to show you how much and how 8 long she smoked, and it ended up being four years 9 or something like that during the course of her 10 life. 11 and i had asked dr. agharkar: how much 12 time did she spend making motivated efforts to 13 quit prior to the time she quit after her heart 14 attack? 15 and his answer was: zero. 16 this was not somebody who tried over, 17 over, over again and experienced horrible 18 withdrawal and relapsed over and over again. this 19 is someone who exercised her right to choose to 20 smoke because she enjoyed using the product. 21 and, of course, it is important to quit. 22 it is important to quit if you do not want to face 23 the dangers of smoking. this was a public service 24 announcement that you saw during the course of 25 this trial. 1 (video clip played as follows:) 2 voice: the moment you stop, in most 3 cases the effects of smoking will begin to reverse 4 themselves until your lungs are nice and clear 5 again. 6 (video clip concluded.) 7 mr. furr: smokers were being told: 8 stop. stop. and the damage you have done to your 9 body will begin reversing itself. and over time, 10 your danger of developing disease will turn to 11 that -- will return to that of a never smoker or 12 nonsmoker, and we will look at that. we will look at 13 what the plaintiff's experts and our expert, 14 dr. klein, told you about the benefits of quitting 15 here in just a minute. 16 i'll skip a couple of these. 17 okay. one of the things dr. proctor 18 told you, because, you know, there is this issue 19 there about -- you will see in the instructions that 20 we looked at a question of: was the information 21 otherwise available to her? 22 dr. proctor told you the warnings about 23 the dangers of smoking were available to smokers 24 and people making decisions about smoking in the 25 1950s, '60s, '70s, and '80s. dr. prochaska told you that mrs. mccoy's 2 children constantly talked to her about smoking in 3 the 1960s, '70s, and '80s. those warnings got 4 more graphic. as time went on, they got more 5 detailed. 6 ms. mccoy raised some successful sons 7 who became chiropractors, who had medical 8 knowledge of their own. and, of course, they 9 loved their mom. and just like mr. mccoy did out 10 of his love for her, they would bring that 11 knowledge home to her because they wanted to 12 encourage her to stop because they did not want her 13 to continue down the path that she had chosen to 14 take. so she got that information constantly. 15 you might remember that some of the sons 16 would even -- as time went on, they would cut out 17 articles about the dangers of smoking and bring 18 them home and put them in front of mrs. mccoy's 19 face in an undeniable way and say: you cannot deny 20 what you are doing to yourself, mom. 21 okay. the warning labels, sometimes we 22 get away from the basics, but the warning labels 23 are a highly important issue in this case. every 24 pack of cigarettes that ms. mccoy would have 25 smoked after 1966 would have had a warning label on it. 2 every advertisement she saw after 1971 3 would have had a warning label on it. 4 this mccall's magazine that you were 5 shown this morning, i encourage you, that if you 6 look through here, look through every single 7 cigarette advertisement in here. it carries a 8 warning on it. 9 mr. schlesinger began his closing today 10 by picking out a package of cigarettes and 11 comparing it to how other consumer goods looked 12 and how other consumer packages look and suggest 13 to you, this could become confusing. how can this 14 be bad? it looks just like these other consumer 15 goods. 16 but there is a difference. those package 17 of cigarettes have a warning label on the side of 18 them unlike all those other consumer goods. and 19 they have one of the warning labels, depending on 20 when the package was made, including warning 21 labels that say: smoking causes lung cancer, 22 heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate 23 pregnancy. surgeon general's warning: quitting 24 smoking now greatly reduces serious risk to your 25 health. that is how cigarettes are different, and 2 that is why they are not confused with other 3 products. because unlike all of those other 4 products, cigarette packages carry a warning on 5 them telling the user that by choosing to use this 6 product, you are exposing yourself to these 7 dangers. 8 mr. mccoy told us that ms. mccoy simply 9 paid no attention to the warnings. you know, 10 mr. schlesinger today talked to you about how many 11 cigarettes she would have smoked, how many hits of 12 nicotine she would have taken. but each time she 13 smoked a cigarette from 1966 on, she would have 14 picked up a package that carried a warning right 15 on the side of the package. a warning that the 16 united states congress has approved with respect 17 to the location, the language, and even the size 18 of the warning. 19 and so every time she picked up a 20 cigarette, she would have had that information in 21 the same hand that she was holding those 22 cigarettes in, but she simply paid no attention to 23 it. 24 dr. prochaska, again, i want to return 25 to this because this is critically important. you know, we throw so much information at you, but 2 you have got to keep your eye on the ball. you have 3 got to keep your eye on the ball and sort through 4 what information is really important and what 5 information does not help me much. 6 dr. prochaska said ms. mccoy was 7 addicted around the '60s, the first time she could 8 conclude. mr. mccoy, who was allowed to express 9 his opinion to you about his wife being addicted, 10 told you that he did not believe that she was 11 addicted before they moved to florida in 1976, 12 before they moved to florida in 1976. 13 so his wife would have been in her late 14 40s before mr. mccoy concluded that his wife was 15 addicted. 16 as we have talked about on more than one 17 occasion, it is important to keep this series of 18 events in mind chronologically because the basic 19 claim is that she was unable to act upon the 20 information that she was receiving because she was 21 addicted and could not process the information. 22 well, now not only do you know that 23 addicted smokers can quit and it does not prevent 24 people from quitting, you also know that depending 25 on whether you rely on dr. prochaska or on mr. mccoy's view of things, which would have put 2 this line somewhere around here (indicating). 3 regardless of which of them you rely upon, ms. 4 mccoy received powerful, personalized warnings 5 about the dangers of smoking that she was taking 6 long before even mr. mccoy or dr. prochaska 7 concluded that they could say she was addicted. 8 i want to talk to you about this issue 9 about filter fraud, filter fraud. i'm sure you 10 know what a red herring is. a red herring is 11 something that does not -- 12 mr. schlesinger: i object. 13 the court: sustained. 14 mr. furr: can you take that off the 15 slide, cliff? 16 let us talk about filters and what the 17 facts are behind filters. 18 tell me when you are ready to pull it up, 19 please. 20 mr. tepikian: you are up. 21 mr. furr: one of the things that was 22 said to you this morning is that the tobacco 23 companies deceived public health authorities and 24 deceived the reader's digest and deceived other 25 intermediaries into endorsing filters, and that is how the message got to smokers. 2 but you know from the cross-examination 3 of dr. proctor, that is not what happened. 4 dr. proctor told you that there were 40 to 50 5 large epidemiology studies done in the '50s, '60s, 6 '70s, and '80s by public health authorities that 7 concluded that smokers of filtered cigarettes were 8 developing less lung cancer that smokers of 9 unfiltered cigarettes and that that information 10 was available to those public health agencies and 11 other governmental entities who had that 12 information when they were making the 13 recommendations about filtered cigarettes. 14 he also told you that he had reviewed rj 15 reynolds internal company documents and had seen 16 statements in those documents that rj reynolds' 17 scientists genuinely believed that filters worked 18 and that low tar and filtered cigarettes were 19 better for health. 20 let us think about what is missing from 21 this case and the claim being made that somehow 22 the production and advertisement of filtered 23 cigarettes was a cause of ms. mccoy's death. 24 did anyone come here and testify that 25 mrs. mccoy would have quit smoking if filtered cigarettes had never been produced? of course the 2 answer is no, because the claim is she did not quit 3 smoking because she was addicted, and you just 4 cannot have it both ways. 5 if she did not quit smoking because she 6 was addicted, then it was not the production of 7 filtered cigarettes that caused her to continue 8 smoking and vice versa. 9 is there any witness who came here and 10 told you that if filtered cigarettes had never 11 been produced and that mrs. mccoy had smoked only 12 unfiltered cigarettes, that somehow she would have 13 avoided the diseases that she developed and her 14 death at age 70? no. nobody told you that. 15 nobody told you that the manufacture and sale of 16 filtered cigarettes was really what caused ms. 17 mccoy's death or -- excuse me, disease or death or 18 that that is what kept her smoking. 19 of course, mr. mccoy told you that he 20 actually encouraged her to switch, to stop 21 smoking, and that filtered cigarettes were not 22 going to help her. 23 but here's what we know, and this is the 24 important thing, because the question -- one of 25 the questions you may consider is, was -- did she rely on the advertisements for filtered cigarettes 2 and was that reliance a cause of her injuries and 3 death? 4 whatever mrs. mccoy believed about 5 filtered cigarettes was not strong enough or 6 important to her enough to drive her smoking 7 habits. because what you heard is that she 8 switched to filtered cigarettes initially, but 9 then soon switched back to unfiltered cigarettes 10 because she preferred them, that was her 11 preference, and that she went back and forth to 12 filtered cigarettes until the late 1980s when she 13 finally switched to a filtered cigarette as her 14 main brand. 15 but for decades, she went back and forth 16 between filtered cigarettes and unfiltered 17 cigarettes. so whatever she believed about 18 filtered cigarettes was not powerful enough, was 19 not powerful enough to drive her smoking habits 20 and was not a cause of her injuries. 21 this is katie lehman who just handed me 22 something. she works with me. she handed me 23 something important. she handed me something 24 really, really important. because, you know, the 25 claim is that it was the concealment of information or the agreement to conceal 2 information that was a cause of mrs. mccoy's 3 disease and death, question 6 and 7 on your 4 verdict form. 5 but here's a question -- 6 mr. hammer: judge, can we approach? 7 the court: sure. 8 9 sidebar:) 10 the court: yes, sir. 11 mr. hammer: i'm not sure what mr. furr 12 is going to put on the boards. 13 mr. furr: it is one of the slides. 14 mr. hammer: it is a slide that was 15 handed to him. 16 mr. furr: there you go, number 68. 17 mr. hammer: the slide that he put up 18 with the red herring, that was not given to us. 19 we never had a chance to address it at sidebar. 20 it was put up and then as soon as we objected, 21 mr. furr took it down. 22 mr. furr: i think it was in the deck. 23 i would be shocked if that is not in the deck. 24 mr. hammer: but it said filter fraud is 25 the way they fixed it. that is how it was handed to us. they never gave us a slide that said: red 2 herring. we absolutely would have objected at 3 sidebar beforehand and they threw it up there. we 4 never saw that, and he knew that. 5 mr. furr: that is not true. 6 the court: i do not know what was done. 7 i will check, but i sustain the objection because 8 to me red herrings are just like fish stories. 9 mr. tepikian: there you go. 10 (the sidebar discussion was concluded 11 and the following was held in open court:) 12 mr. furr: was the concealment of 13 information a cause of mrs. mccoy's disease and 14 death or was an agreement to conceal information a 15 cause of her disease and death? one question and 16 answer from dr. prochaska illustrates that the 17 answer to those questions has to be no. 18 dr. prochaska was asked: do you recall 19 mr. mccoy's testimony that he did not think there 20 was anything anyone could have said that would 21 have caused her to quit? and the answer was: 22 yes. the answer was: yes. 23 there was nothing that anyone could have 24 said to her that would have caused her to quit, 25 and that is straight from mr. mccoy. and dr. prochaska told you that is what she saw in his 2 deposition. 3 thank you. 4 ladies and gentlemen, just like i said 5 when i first stood up, the evidence is 6 overwhelming that mrs. mccoy -- of all the issues 7 in the case, this is the issue where all the 8 evidence points in one direction, that ms. mccoy 9 knew that smoking was dangerous and addictive 10 beginning in the 1950s, knew it caused heart 11 disease, emphysema, lung cancer, premature death, 12 and there is nothing anybody else could have said 13 that would have caused her to quit sooner. 14 and the answer to -- what have i done 15 now, cliff? oh, it is okay. it is up there. 16 the answer to question 6, for all these 17 companies, has to be no. this is a question about 18 whether she relied to her detriment. this is a 19 fraud and concealment question. you see it in 20 number 6. this is a question that because she 21 knew about the dangers, she cannot have relied 22 upon it. 23 the conspiracy question, the agreement 24 to conceal question, question 7, it is really the 25 same answer. she knew the health effects and 2 addictive nature of tobacco, and you cannot conceal 3 something from someone when they already know it. 4 you certainly cannot hurt somebody from 5 concealing something from them if they already 6 know it. so just like the concealment claim, the 7 agreement to conceal claim, which is number 7 on 8 your verdict form, the answer has to be no. 9 all -- respectfully, all of the evidence 10 in this case points in one direction, and it 11 was not a lack of knowledge on mrs. mccoy's part 12 that kept her smoking and caused her injuries. it 13 was the choices that she made notwithstanding that 14 knowledge. 15 i want to go to this comparative fault 16 question. you heard today for the first time that 17 the plaintiff's recognize that you may well 18 find -- 19 mr. schlesinger: objection, your 20 honor. 21 the court: overruled. 22 mr. furr: -- that you may well find 23 that mrs. mccoy was at fault for causing her own 24 disease and death and that mrs. mccoy could have 25 tried harder and could have tried more often and could have quit sooner. 2 that is what was told to you today. but, 3 anyway, the assignment of fault question is 4 important because it is a very narrow question, 5 actually. 6 and what is important when you get to 7 this assignment of fault question is this, the 8 assignment of fault in this case relates only to 9 actions that were a legal cause of mrs. mccoy's 10 death. 11 if there is some other action of one or 12 more of the tobacco companies that you do not like 13 or that you think is wrong but was not a legal 14 cause of her death, it simply does not weigh in 15 the calculus of this assignment of fault. 16 the defendants can only be assigned 17 faults for actions -- excuse me, cannot be 18 assigned fault for actions that were not a cause 19 of her death. 20 you will see that when you read the 21 instructions. they are very clear. fault must be 22 based on acts that were a legal cause. 23 you also have heard this morning, you 24 heard the instructions, you know that the engle 25 findings do not establish that defendants are at fault for causing ms. mccoy's death. 2 and important to remember, when you 3 think about those engle findings, if those 4 findings establish the defendants were at fault, 5 we would not be here. that issue would already be 6 decided. those findings simply do not establish 7 the defendants were a cause of mrs. mccoy's death. 8 they are not about mrs. mccoy. they are about 9 actions by the defendants, in general, and whether 10 those actions affected mrs. mccoy is why you are 11 here. 12 as you begin your deliberations, it is 13 important to recognize that the plaintiffs have to 14 prove every percentage point of fault. like a lot 15 of times, you know, in life, you start at 50/50. 16 and you think about: how do i adjust the 50/50? 17 but not here because the plaintiffs have the 18 burden of proof. 19 the defendants start down here at the 20 bottom. and you were told this morning that you 21 should assign thirty percent of fault to each 22 defendant, a total of ninety percent. that is easy to 23 say but hard to prove because you have to prove 24 each percentage point. you have to prove -- 25 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor. it misstates -- 2 the court: objection is overruled. 3 this is argument, counsel. 4 mr. furr: you have to prove why it is 5 not 1 percent or 2 percent, or what is the 6 additional evidence you have that takes it from 3 7 percent to 5 percent, to ten percent? that is what 8 has to be proven to you. 9 let us think about what some of this 10 evidence was that you might want to consider if 11 you get to this issue about assignment of fault. 12 dr. mannino. 13 question: and being addicted to 14 nicotine does not relieve a smoker of 15 responsibility to try to quit smoking; is not that 16 right? 17 answer: correct. 18 of course, like i said, you heard this 19 morning, mr. schlesinger tell you, she could have 20 tried harder to quit, she could have tried more 21 often to quit. 22 dr. mannino, a very important concept 23 because it is a fair question: would she have 24 benefited from quitting and how late could she 25 have quit and still gained a benefit? dr. mannino, fine pulmonologist, no 2 question about it, said that it is likely that she 3 would not have developed a heart condition if she 4 stopped smoking in 1981. 5 if she stopped smoking in 1981, she 6 would have avoided her heart disease. 7 dr. klein told you that the risk of 8 developing lung cancer is nearly, not quite, but 9 nearly the same as nonsmoker's risk five to eight 10 years after stopping smoking. so not only is it 11 important to stop smoking, but the sooner you 12 stop, the greater the benefit. the sooner you 13 stop, the greater the benefit. 14 dr. klein also told you with respect to 15 copd that everyone loses lung function as they 16 age, but that five years after quitting smoking, a 17 former smoker's decline in lung function is the 18 same as a never-smoker. just a fact of life. as 19 we all grow older, we are losing lung function. 20 smokers lose it faster because of the 21 way smoking is affecting their lungs. but if they 22 stop, five years after they stopped, the rate at 23 which their lung capacity decreases -- their lung 24 function decreases is the same as that of a 25 nonsmoker. and, of course, when you come to this 2 comparative fault question, again, ladies and 3 gentlemen, i suggest to you that this first board 4 i showed you in many ways answers the important 5 questions in this case. 6 and what it really demonstrates to you 7 is that only mrs. mccoy, only mrs. mccoy had the 8 ability to change the events of this case. 9 she is the only person. she is the only 10 party to this lawsuit that could have made a 11 decision for her to stop smoking and avoid her 12 smoking-related disease. 13 the choices that she made to ignore all 14 the information that she got about the dangers of 15 smoking and to continue to choose to smoke as 16 opposed to quitting and choosing health, those 17 choices that she made, including the choices that 18 she made before either dr. prochaska or mr. mccoy 19 said she is addicted, those are the only cause of 20 mrs. mccoy's death. 21 and when you consider this issue of 22 comparative fault, we would ask that you please keep 23 in mind that only she could have changed the 24 outcome of this case. and as we just looked at, 25 mr. mccoy testified, there is nothing anybody could have said that would have changed her behavior and 2 caused her to quit smoking. 3 what is my time? 4 mr. keehfus: hour and a half. 5 mr. furr: i've got ten more minutes, 6 and then mr. tepikian is going to give you the 7 hook. 8 okay. damages, i'm not going to say too 9 about much damages other than you will see in your 10 instruction that damages must be fair and just in 11 light of the evidence, fair and just in light of 12 the evidence, that they are not done out of anger, 13 they are not done out of emotion, but they have to 14 be based on the evidence in this case. 15 and that damages in this phase of the 16 trial, i want to remind you that these are damages 17 designed to compensate mr. mccoy for any loss that 18 he has proved to you. 19 these are not damages designed to punish 20 the defendants. that is a second phase of the 21 trial, if you get there, but today -- tomorrow 22 when you are deliberating, your decision now is 23 only what damages are designed to compensate 24 mr. mccoy. 25 and, once again, it is the plaintiff's burden of proof. the plaintiffs have the burden 2 to prove to you their damages. they have to prove 3 to you each and every dollar of damage. 4 you know, it is easy to pluck out of the 5 air a large number, like $12 million, and ask you 6 for $9 million for the injury that mr. mccoy has 7 already incurred and $2 million more for what he 8 may incur in the future, for a total of $12. 9 that is the request that was made of you 10 on a wrongful death claim, but what is the 11 evidence that supports a $12 million verdict? 12 that is a lot of money. $12 million is a lot of 13 money. 14 what evidence supports that? how have 15 plaintiffs proven to you that $12 million is the 16 right number? how did they prove to you that even 17 $1 million, even $1 million, a huge number, have 18 they proven to you that $1 million is the right 19 number? 20 in this case, respectfully, the $12 21 million request just simply defies common sense. 22 this is a case -- i've said it too many times 23 maybe already today, but mrs. mccoy knew that 24 smoking was dangerous and caused cancer and death 25 starting in the '50s, but she enjoyed her smoking and did not want to quit. 2 and the $12 million request just defies 3 common sense. and you are going to have to decide 4 whether or not the plaintiffs have proven to you, 5 if you get to this issue, if you get to this 6 issue, you have to decide: have plaintiffs 7 actually proven to you that $12 million is the 8 right number? did they even prove to you that $1 9 million is the right number? 10 there is a final issue in this case, 11 because not only did plaintiffs -- not only did 12 they have a request of $12 million of you, they 13 want you to come back for a second phase and award 14 them more money above and beyond what is necessary 15 to compensate. 16 they want to come back to a second phase 17 of this trial and ask you to award them more money 18 in the form of punitive damages, punitive damages. 19 and that is the last question on your 20 verdict form. they are going to ask you to find, 21 if you check yes, we come back here for a second 22 phase so they can ask you for more money. 23 what is important -- 24 mr. schlesinger: objection. objection, 25 your honor. the court: overruled. 2 mr. furr: -- to understand is that if 3 you get to that last question, if you get to that 4 last question, there is a higher burden of proof. 5 you know, as mr. schlesinger illustrated 6 with his scales today, for these other questions 7 in this first phase, there is a preponderance of 8 the evidence burden of proof. 9 but you will see in your instructions 10 that if you get to this last question, and you 11 will not get there unless you find that ms. mccoy's 12 death was caused by concealment or agreement to 13 conceal. those are the only questions that cause 14 you to go forward to the punitive entitlement 15 claim. 16 you see, it is sort of the -- just the 17 way the verdict form is instructed, you will see, 18 it is a little abstract to talk to since you do not 19 have your verdict form yet. 20 but you will see you have directions on 21 your verdict form that tell you you only get to 22 that last question if you find that concealment or 23 agreement to concealment was a cause of her death, 24 which we know it was not because she knew that 25 smoking was dangerous for decades. but, nonetheless, i'm going to talk to 2 you briefly about this question because they have 3 a higher, a higher burden of proof. they have to 4 prove to you by clear and convincing evidence. 5 you will see also, instruction 20 on 6 page 24 of your instructions, that in determining 7 whether punitive damages are warranted, you may 8 also take into consideration any mitigating 9 evidence. mitigating evidence is evidence which 10 may demonstrate that there is no need to impose 11 punitive damages against the defendants. 12 so regardless of whether you think the 13 conduct merited punishment, you may conclude that 14 because of other evidence that mitigates against 15 the need to punish, that you do not want to punish 16 in this case. 17 and i'm going to go through this pretty 18 quickly. i know mr. tepikian is going to talk you 19 about this. a couple things, though, that i think 20 are important to keep in mind. 21 number one, notwithstanding all of the 22 negative things that were said about ctr, the ctr 23 did some great work. 24 with tobacco company money, the ctr 25 funded $350 million of research, resulting in 7,000 peer-reviewed articles. more than 600 2 articles -- in these surgeon general reports that 3 are talked about a great deal, more than 600 4 times, those reports have cited ctr-funded 5 studies. 6 another mitigating -- other mitigating 7 evidence is that you are being asked to punish in 8 2015 for things that happened a very, very long 9 time ago. 10 you know, you saw all of the people that 11 were claimed to be the actors in the conspiracy. 12 they put up a board and said: this is a picture 13 of all the people that were involved, but 14 dr. proctor told you not a single one of these 15 people works for the tobacco companies anymore and 16 probably most of them are not even alive anymore. 17 2015, you are being asked to punish for 18 things that happened a very long time ago. 19 you also heard about the work that rj 20 reynolds has done in trying to develop safer 21 cigarettes. dr. proctor told you that rj reynolds 22 has spent a billion dollars on one brand of 23 cigarettes called the premier cigarette that was 24 less mutagenic and he thought it would be safer, 25 but the consumers rejected it because they did not like the way it tasted. 2 rj reynolds did not stop trying. they 3 took it back in-house. they re-engineered it, 4 spent more money, reintroduced it. it failed 5 again, but they tried. 6 just like dr. proctor told you, the only 7 safe cigarette is one that someone does not smoke, 8 but rj reynolds spent a billion dollars trying to 9 make a cigarette that would be less dangerous, 10 rejected by consumers. 11 i will let mr. tepikian talk about the 12 fda, in the interest of time, but i do want to 13 talk to you about this because this is really 14 important. 15 you are going to be asked to punish 16 because of concealment or agreement to conceal 17 that were a cause of mrs. mccoy's death. 18 one thing is for sure, there is no 19 concealment today because dr. proctor told you 20 about the rj reynolds' website, that on the rj 21 reynolds' website, which is a voluntary website, 22 that rj reynolds tells the smoking and nonsmoking 23 public the nicotine in cigarettes is addictive, 24 that the best course of action for tobacco smokers 25 concerned about their health is to quit. that smoking significantly increases the risk of 2 serious diseases, lung cancer, heart disease, 3 emphysema. that adults who do not use tobacco 4 products should not start and adults who are using 5 tobacco products should stop and that minors 6 should never use tobacco products. 7 the last thing i want to talk about. 8 there is been a lot of discussion in this case 9 about youth marketing and about smoking among 10 adolescents. and it is been described as an 11 epidemic, but the fact of the matter is that youth 12 smoking rates today in the united states are at 13 the lowest they have been since the 1920s. 14 dr. proctor told you that the rates have 15 fallen dramatically in the past 18 years, that 16 youth smoking has decreased by 66 percent since 17 1966, and that there is been a 25 percent decline 18 just in the last four years. and interestingly, 19 today cigarettes are so stigmatized among youth 20 that teenagers are more likely to smoke marijuana 21 than to smoke cigarettes today. 22 ladies and gentlemen, i'm going to end 23 the way i started. 24 so this is your question 10, your last 25 question on the verdict form. i do not think you will get there because she was not injured by 2 concealment or agreement to conceal. 3 but if you do, for the reasons i just 4 discussed and what mr. tepikian will discuss with 5 you, the answer should be no to this question, and 6 then the case will end regardless of what else 7 you have done. 8 okay. i'm going to end the way i 9 started. it is a simple case. despite all the 10 time we spent talking to you, it is a simple case. 11 it is a case about personal responsibility, and i 12 cannot say it any better than dr. hammond. 13 (video clip played as follows:) 14 voice: good evening. this is see it 15 now, produced by the partnership of friendly and 16 murrow. tonight the first of two reports on 17 cigarettes and lung cancer. 18 voice: in 1952, drs. hammond and horn 19 of the american cancer society began an extended 20 study of the smoking habits of american men. here 21 is dr. hammond reporting on the results of the 22 first two years. 23 voice: it is now established, in my 24 opinion, beyond a reasonable doubt, that cigarette 25 smoking greatly increases the probability of developing lung cancer. 2 in my opinion, people can be warned of 3 the danger and they are being warned. what they 4 then want to do, whether they want to smoke or 5 not, is their own business. 6 (video clip concluded.) 7 mr. furr: people have the freedom in 8 the united states to make choices, including the 9 choices to do dangerous things. 10 (video clip played as follows:) 11 voice: this is a cbs news extra on 12 smoking and health, the findings of the surgeon 13 general's committee. 14 voice: almost from the moment that 15 cigarettes were introduced, they were attacked, 16 but the attacks took a new turn ten years ago and 17 culminated in today's report by the surgeon 18 general's committee. 19 this, in summary, is what the committee 20 said: cigarette smoking is a major cause of lung 21 cancer in men, and data on women smokers runs the 22 same way. cigarette smoking is a significant 23 cause of cancer of the larynx and probably the 24 most important cause of chronic bronchitis. 25 cigarette smoking may be related to other lung diseases. male smokers have a much 2 higher death rate from heart disease, although 3 it is not proven that smoking is the cause. 4 on the question of filters, the 5 committee says there is no evidence that they do 6 any good, but it did not exclude the possibility 7 that an effective filter might be developed. in 8 short, the committee says: if you smoke 9 cigarettes, you increase your chances of dying 10 early. the sooner you start, the more you smoke, 11 the more you inhale, the worse your chances are. 12 in this kind of a country, it comes down 13 to you, whether you like it or not. no one is 14 going to forbid an adult to smoke, and it is now 15 quite clear that no one is going to tell him it is 16 good for him, either. the decision is his, the 17 decision and the health that may depend on it. 18 this is harry reasoner. good night. 19 (video clip concluded.) 20 mr. furr: it comes down to you, whether 21 you like it or not. not only do we have freedom 22 of choice in this country, the price that we paid 23 for it is personal responsibility. 24 why did mrs. mccoy smoke for between 40 25 and 50 years? (video clip played as follows:) 2 q. mr. mccoy, mrs. mccoy would enjoy having 3 a cigarette before and after her coffee, for 4 example, right? 5 a. right. 6 q. and ms. mccoy loved to smoke after she 7 ate, right? 8 a. yes. mrs. mccoy loved to smoke, period. 9 (video clip concluded.) 10 mr. furr: mr. mccoy also told you that 11 mrs. mccoy was responsible for making the decision 12 to stop and conceded that mrs. mccoy was 13 responsible for succeeding in quitting smoking. 14 ladies and gentlemen, thank you very 15 much for your patience with me. all that we ask 16 of you is let the lessons we all learned in 17 kindergarten about personal responsibility guide 18 your decision-making in this case. 7 mr. tepikian: may i? 8 ladies and gentlemen, counsel, 9 mr. mccoy, when i stood before you at opening 10 statement and -- during my opening statement, i 11 told you that what i thought the evidence would 12 show in this case. 13 i told you that i thought we would be 14 able to show that mrs. mccoy knew the health risks 15 of smoking, that she made the choice to continue 16 smoking despite knowing those risks, that she 17 ignored all the warnings throughout her life, that 18 despite knowing she was putting her own health at 19 risk, she continued to smoke and did not want to 20 stop, that she did not make a serious quit attempt 21 until her own health was at risk, and that she was 22 capable of quitting smoking at any time because 23 when she finally did get motivated to quit 24 smoking, she quit cold turkey and never smoked 25 again. i think we proved those facts, and i 2 think we proved much more. 3 now during the course of this trial, it 4 may have seemed that you were listening to two 5 different cases. it may have seemed that it was 6 kind of like two ships passing in the night. 7 mr. furr and i and other counsel for rj 8 reynolds believe that this case was about 9 mrs. mccoy. we believe it came down to those two 10 words. 11 mr. schlesinger: objection. 12 the court: sustained. 13 mr. tepikian: and that is because every 14 question on the verdict form is about mrs. mccoy. 15 now, as much as mr. schlesinger and mr. gdanski 16 and mr. hammer wanted this case to be a referendum 17 on cigarette smoking -- 18 mr. schlesinger: objection. 19 mr. tepikian: -- or tobacco 20 companies -- 21 the court: sustained. 22 counsel, this is not about personal 23 beliefs. 24 mr. tepikian: this case is about one 25 woman and whether her estate is entitled to recover damages for her death 18 years ago. 2 now what i'd like to focus on are 3 certain areas of the evidence. and as i told you 4 in voir dire, i am not going to repeat everything 5 that mr. furr said or that other counsel for rj 6 reynolds, and i did my best to do that throughout 7 the trial. 8 but i am going to focus on a few key 9 pieces of evidence and kind of expand on them a 10 little bit more because i want to make sure that 11 you understand some of the issues that are at 12 issue for you to decide and because when mr. furr 13 and i talked about the closing, we wanted to make 14 sure that we had it covered and that we were not 15 overlapping. 16 so one of the things i want to talk to 17 you about is the brands of cigarettes that 18 mrs. mccoy smoked. now clearly, of the three 19 people with personal knowledge about mrs. mccoy's 20 smoking, two of them, mr. mccoy and scott mccoy, 21 could not provide much information about the actual 22 brands of cigarettes that mrs. mccoy smoked. 23 and the third person that testified, 24 keith mccoy, he did not testify about any brands of 25 cigarettes that his mother smoked. but what is clear from the evidence is 2 that mrs. mccoy was smoking unfiltered 3 chesterfield cigarettes when mr. mccoy met her in 4 1994 -- in 1944, excuse me. 5 and that scott mccoy testified that 6 chesterfield was the first brand of cigarettes 7 that he remembers his mom smoking in the '60s and 8 that she continued to smoke that brand throughout 9 the '80s. 10 mr. mccoy also testified that he 11 could not recall any brand of cigarettes his wife 12 smoked in the 1970s. 13 and the evidence is that mrs. mccoy 14 alternated between unfiltered cigarettes, 15 chesterfield, including chesterfields, and 16 filtered cigarettes until some time in the 17 mid-1980s. 18 ladies and gentlemen, during the course 19 of trial, you learned that unfiltered 20 chesterfields, when mrs. mccoy was smoking, was 21 manufactured by a company called liggett, and 22 liggett is not a defendant in this case. 23 and when you look at the verdict form 24 that the judge will give you, you will see that 25 liggett does not appear anywhere on the verdict form. 2 ladies and gentlemen, it is pretty clear 3 that chesterfield was a primary brand that 4 mrs. mccoy smoked throughout her life. that is the 5 brand that mr. mccoy remembered she started with. 6 that is the brand that the one son who testified 7 about brands remembered her first smoking, and 8 that is an unfiltered brand that she smoked 9 throughout her life until the mid-'80s. 10 now one of the questions on the verdict 11 form is question number 4, and this is not one 12 that -- i do not think -- mr. schlesinger touched 13 on it. i know that mr. furr did not. 14 in question 4, assuming you get this far 15 in your verdict form, it says: please state as to 16 each defendant whether smoking cigarettes 17 manufactured by the defendant was a legal cause of 18 glodine mccoy's injuries. and it lists rj 19 reynolds, philip morris, and lorillard tobacco 20 company. it does not list liggett. 21 now in closing argument -- 22 mr. schlesinger: objection. 23 objection. 24 the court: sustained. 25 mr. schlesinger: move to strike. the court: the jury is to disregard the 2 last comment. 3 mr. tepikian: in closing argument, 4 mr. schlesinger said that he wanted you to award 5 somewhere around $12 million to mr. mccoy against 6 those three defendants, but the evidence is clear 7 that chesterfield was mrs. mccoy's primary brand. 8 so i'd suggest that you need to check no 9 as to each one of those defendants with regard to 10 whether or not cigarettes manufactured by those 11 defendants were a legal cause of mrs. mccoy's 12 injuries. 13 and that is because the evidence that we 14 have in this case is that she smoked those brands 15 of cigarettes only intermittently during her life. 16 think back to the evidence that you 17 heard in this case. it was that she smoked some 18 cigarettes, that she smoked some kent, she smoked 19 some parliament. she may have smoked some 20 virginia slims, but what was the length of time 21 that she smoked any of those brands? it was never 22 pinpointed down. the one brand that there was any 23 kind of consistent testimony about was the 24 chesterfield brand. 25 now i want to touch a little bit on damages. 250 to 300 years, think about that, if 2 someone made between $400,000 and 3 $500,000 [sic] -- 4 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor. 5 mr. tepikian: -- it would take -- 6 mr. schlesinger: excuse me. pardon me. 7 no earnings claim, your honor. 8 objection. 9 the court: overruled. 10 mr. tepikian: if someone made between 11 400,000 and $500,000 [sic] a year, it would take 12 between somewhere between 250 and 300 years -- 13 mr. schlesinger: objection, your 14 honor. 15 mr. tepikian: -- to make $12 million. 16 the court: excuse me. i overruled the 17 objection. continue. 18 mr. schlesinger: sorry, judge. 19 mr. tepikian: it would take someone 250 20 to 300 years to make $12 million, and that is the 21 demand that mr. schlesinger suggested you should 22 enter on your verdict form. think about that. 23 and mr. furr touched on damages, as 24 well. they need to be fair and reasonable. think 25 about that. if you get that far in the verdict form, 2 you need to think about what is a fair and 3 reasonable amount of damages. and i would suggest 4 to you that $12 million is not when you think 5 about how much money -- how long it would take 6 someone to earn that if they made 40 to $50,000 a 7 year. 8 now mr. furr touched on reliance. let us 9 talk a little bit about reliance. that goes to 10 the fraudulent concealment and the conspiracy 11 counts. 12 those are questions 6 and 7 on the 13 verdict form. and as mr. furr said: i do not 14 think you get to those questions, but we need to 15 address them. we need to address all the 16 questions on the verdict form. 17 so you have heard a lot of evidence about 18 the tobacco companies and you saw some of the 19 internal company documents. and no doubt, there is 20 some things that you saw that caused you to shake 21 your head. there is no question about that. 22 but if you get this far, i think the 23 thing that you need to ask yourself is, is there 24 proof that any of the defendants fooled mrs. mccoy 25 in some way that caused her to begin smoking or continue smoking, or did mrs. mccoy have the 2 information she needed to make an informed choice 3 about whether to smoke or quit smoking? 4 mr. furr went through all of the 5 information that mrs. mccoy had throughout her 6 life in detail. i'm not going to go through all 7 of that. 8 but i want to hit on one thing that 9 mr. schlesinger said this morning. he told you 10 that mrs. mccoy was -- and i believe i wrote this 11 down correctly -- addicted as a teenage girl, end 12 quote. 13 remember dr. prochaska? she testified, 14 and this was on -- this was plaintiff's own 15 expert. she testified that it was her opinion 16 that mrs. mccoy was not addicted to -- not 17 addicted to cigarettes. 18 all right. so this is plaintiff's own 19 expert opining on addiction, that mrs. mccoy was 20 not addicted until some time in the 1960s. that 21 would have meant that mrs. mccoy was somewhere in 22 her mid-30s to early 40s. 23 mr. furr discussed all that, but clearly 24 by that point in time, mrs. mccoy had information 25 about the health risks and dangers of smoking. and she would have been making an informed choice 2 with regard to whether to continue smoking or stop 3 smoking. 4 now mr. gdanski and dr. proctor spent 5 about two days going through the internal company 6 documents. obviously, nothing that appeared in 7 those documents is something that ms. mccoy was 8 aware of or relied upon. 9 but i suggest the critical thing is, 10 what did mrs. mccoy believe? there was testimony 11 in this case that mrs. mccoy heard statements by a 12 tobacco company, but what did she believe? let us 13 go back and look at what mr. mccoy's testimony 14 was. 15 when he was on the stand, mr. mccoy was 16 on direct examination with mr. hammer. he was 17 asked this question. he said: when you would 18 talk to your wife -- to her, mrs. mccoy, about the 19 health effects, what would she talk to you about 20 as far as what her concerns were? 21 the answer was: well, she did not have 22 those concerns. she -- she consistently told me 23 that the tobacco company said it was okay to 24 smoke, they were doing the studies and the studies 25 said: well, no, it is all right. keep on smoking. you know, we will come up with an answer of some 2 kind, you know. 3 and then here's the important thing. 4 here's the next question: based on what you 5 observed when she was telling you that, did it 6 appear to you she believed that? did she believe 7 what she said she was hearing from the tobacco 8 companies? 9 and mr. mccoy's answer, very candid: 10 no. i do not think she did. i -- i -- maybe she 11 did, maybe she did not. it was hard for me to tell 12 at that time. i know we had to go out to -- 13 should i keep on going? 14 he told you that she did not believe 15 what she said she was hearing from the tobacco 16 companies. if she did not believe it, she could 17 not have relied upon it. 18 and when you look at the jury 19 instructions, you will see it talks about 20 detrimental reliance and reasonable reliance. 21 and, ladies and gentlemen, i would 22 suggest that this is proof, in and of itself, that 23 she did not detrimentally rely on anything any 24 defendant said or did not say or anything the 25 defendants did or did not do. now one of the things i also want to 2 make a note on with regard to questions 6 and 7, 3 and mr. furr showed you the questions, so i'm not 4 going to go through that again. 5 but one of the things i think is 6 important for you to understand if you get this 7 far in the verdict form, i want to direct you to 8 instruction number 15, instruction number 15, 9 which is on page 18 of your jury instructions. 10 in that, it discusses what the impact is 11 of any comparative fault that you might find 12 between mrs. mccoy and any tobacco company, if you 13 get that far in the verdict form. 14 and what this instruction tells you is 15 that if you were to check yes to questions 6 or 7, 16 the questions on fraudulent concealment and 17 conspiracy, none of the comparative fault would 18 apply. 19 if you assigned mrs. mccoy 99 percent of 20 the fault, because you check yes to question 6 and 21 7, it would not apply at all, and no comparative 22 fault would be applied in this case. 23 and i think it is important for you to 24 understand that when you consider these questions, 25 if you get that far in the verdict form. one of the other questions, and mr. furr 2 touched on this, and i'm going to go a little bit 3 further into it because mr. schlesinger spent a 4 great deal of time talking about entitlement to 5 punitive damages, which is the last question on 6 the verdict form, question number 10. 7 he spent a lot of time talking about 8 that, and i would suggest that most of his closing 9 argument was focused on question number 10 on the 10 verdict form. 11 so let us talk about that. it is the one 12 that talks about entitlement to punitive damages. 13 you only get to question number 10, you only 14 answer question number 10 if you answer question 6 15 or 7 yes. 16 and you will see that when you get the 17 verdict form from your honor. 18 but let us talk about what punitive 19 damages are and what you would be asking -- be 20 asked to decide, if you get that far. 21 so you are not being asked to decide any 22 amount of punitive damages. the issue is whether 23 by clear and convincing evidence, that the 24 plaintiff, mr. mccoy, has shown he is entitled to 25 punitive damages. so do not spend a second thinking about 2 the amount, if you get that far. the question is 3 whether, based on the evidence, mr. mccoy has 4 shown by clear and convincing evidence he is 5 entitled to punitive damages. 6 so if we get to that, there is going to 7 be a whole nother phase to this trial, and your 8 honor instructed you on that. mr. schlesinger 9 touched on that, as did mr. furr, but there will 10 be another phase to this trial. 11 and plaintiff will have an opportunity 12 to put on witnesses. rj reynolds and lorillard 13 will have an opportunity. philip morris will. 14 we will have additional closing arguments, and 15 that is when you would consider the amount. 16 so at this point, you would not be 17 considering an amount at all, only whether there is 18 entitlement. 19 but i want you to focus on what the 20 instructions are. it talks about clear and 21 convincing evidence, which is a higher burden than 22 the greater weight of the evidence. 23 and your honor has instructed you on 24 that, but let me direct you to what the actual 25 language is. with respect to punitive damages, you will 2 see that the evidence for clear and convincing 3 needs to be precise, explicit, lacking in 4 confusion and of such weight that it produces a 5 fair belief or a conviction without hesitation 6 about the matter at issue. and that is directly 7 from the instructions that you were given. 8 and let me tell you this: in the 9 instructions, it also tells you that you can only 10 punish for any conduct that harmed mrs. mccoy, and 11 that is an important concept. 12 so punitive damages are designed to 13 punish and deter. and under the law, you can only 14 punish for any harm to mrs. mccoy, if you get that 15 far. 16 the instructions, and mr. furr showed 17 you the actual instruction on this, but for 18 punitive damages, you also have to consider 19 mitigating evidence. all right. and mitigating 20 evidence is evidence that demonstrates that 21 there is no need to impose punitive damages. 22 so let us talk a little bit about what 23 mitigating evidence you have already heard in this 24 case, so that if you get to this question, you 25 have this in mind. let us talk about the fda. now during 2 his direct examination, dr. proctor told you that 3 he did not think that the companies' behavior has 4 changed at all. 5 on cross-examination, you learned that 6 it has. you learned that the tobacco institute 7 and the council for tobacco research were 8 disbanded in 1999. you learned that philip morris 9 and rj reynolds, and mr. furr talked about it in 10 his closing, have websites that talk about and 11 state that cigarette smoking causes cancer and can 12 be addictive, and that there are links on those 13 sites to other public health places for people to 14 go to get information about smoking and health. 15 and that is the only way that these 16 companies communicate with regard to smoking and 17 health. 18 you learned that in 2000, philip morris 19 supported fda regulation of tobacco. and that in 20 2009, the fda entered significant regulation over 21 tobacco. 22 you learned that the fda can ban any 23 ingredient in cigarettes except for nicotine. and 24 that they can control the amount of nicotine in 25 cigarettes. they cannot ban it, but they can control the amount of nicotine in cigarettes. 2 you learned that the tobacco companies 3 need to disclose their research, advertising, and 4 marketing documents to the fda. 5 you learned that the fda has to approve 6 any changes to existing cigarette design or 7 ingredients and that they have to approve any new 8 cigarette design or ingredients before they can 9 actually go on the market. 10 you learned that the fda can make 11 unannounced inspections at any of the tobacco 12 companies' manufacturing or research facilities, 13 and that they have. 14 you learned that the fda now controls 15 what goes into a cigarette, what comes out of a 16 cigarette, and what could be said about a 17 cigarette. 18 the fact is that these companies act in 19 a much more transparent and regulated environment 20 than they ever have, and that has been the case 21 for over a decade. 22 i respectfully suggest the plaintiff has 23 not met their burden of showing entitlement to 24 punitive damages. and that if you get to this 25 question, which is the last question, and i do not think you will, that you should check no with 2 regard to entitlement to punitive damages. 3 members of the jury, this case is about 4 one smoker and whether she is a member of the engle 5 class and whether her estate is entitled to 6 recover money for her decisions to begin and quit 7 and continue smoking. 8 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor. 9 misstates the law. 10 the court: sustained. 11 mr. tepikian: this is a case about 12 mrs. mccoy and what she knew about the risks of 13 smoking and why she chose to continue smoking. 14 mr. schlesinger: same objection, your 15 honor. misstates the law. 16 the court: thank you. 17 mr. tepikian: the evidence is that 18 mrs. mccoy is not an engle class member. the 19 evidence is that she had information she needed to 20 make an informed decision whether to smoke or stop 21 smoking, and that she did not detrimentally rely on 22 anything any defendant said or did not say. 23 ladies and gentlemen, you have been 24 incredibly intent, and you have shown that by just 25 the questions that you have asked of the various witnesses. you have really paid a lot of 2 attention, and we very much appreciate that. 3 we have the greatest civil justice 4 system in the world, and if it is not for people 5 like you who have now taken about three weeks out 6 of your lives to sit here and hear this case, we 7 would not be able to do it. 8 i know everybody thanks you for your 9 time and your service. i thank you for your time 10 and service. thank you for the opportunity to 11 have brought the case to you. and with that, i 12 will sit down. thank you.
