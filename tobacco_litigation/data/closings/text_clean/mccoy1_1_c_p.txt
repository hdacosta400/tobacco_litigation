5 mr. schlesinger: may it please the 6 court, counsel, john, the mccoy clan. good 7 morning. 8 ladies and gentlemen of the jury, good 9 morning. 10 jurors: good morning. 11 mr. schlesinger: thank you for sitting 12 through this trial. 13 one of the things we tell jurors 14 oftentimes is that many are chosen, but few are 15 called. 16 but, in this case, it is interesting. 17 when we looked over your information, every one 18 of you volunteered. and, so, unlike some cases 19 in which the jurors begrudgingly submit, and 20 they have got other more important things to do, 21 my recollection was everybody here said, i'm 22 willing to serve, and we -- we thank you for 23 that. we think that is important, and we 24 appreciate it. 25 i've got a clicker here. so, at this juncture, i call this 2 judgment day, a day of reckoning, a day of 3 reckoning, in part, for what we will prove to 4 you and remind you are reprehensible acts of 5 the tobacco industry, historically, going way 6 back, way back, a company that is an enterprise 7 of death, a company that manufactured -- 8 industrially manufactured terrible diseases 9 that killed millions of americans over many, 10 many decades, even after things like the 1964 11 surgeon general came out. 12 and i'm going to go back and remind you 13 about those things, and we will go through it and 14 you will see what your job is to do. 15 and your job is going to be filling out 16 the questions and answers on a verdict form 17 that is about three or four pages long, which 18 his honor has not read, he will read at the -- 19 read at the close, and i am going to try now to 20 stitch together for you some of the evidence in 21 the way we hope you see it, will you see it our 22 way, and then help you come to the conclusions 23 that you need to -- to make in your 24 deliberative capacity as a juror in the jury 25 room when we turn it over to you. and, you know, the whole idea, what is 2 neat about this american system of justice, is 3 that you all have no dog in the fight. you 4 have no stake in the outcome. and, so, trial 5 by jury is one of the best ways to protect the 6 rights and liberties that we hold dear in this 7 country. 8 and while the attorneys are charged with 9 zealously representing the position and the 10 claim of their clients -- that is our role as 11 advocates -- you all get to decide, okay, is 12 this the search for the truth that the 13 miami-dade courthouse has on a plaque 14 emblazoned on every courtroom, "we who labor 15 here seek only truth." 16 that is going to be your job. and we are 17 going to try to help you work through it based 18 on assembling this data in -- realistically, 19 what does it mean. 20 so let me start by saying this: let 21 me -- let me sum it up in a nutshell. the 22 simple truth in this case is this is an 23 industry, all right? 24 and i said it has been in existence now 25 and conducting a conspiracy, which was determined by the engle findings, which you will 2 learn more about -- and i've got an enlargement 3 up there you can read -- that youth targeted as 4 replacement smokers, the dirty little secret of 5 the business, that hides in plain sight, and 6 the fact that, in real terms, in reality, this 7 is nothing but drugs. that is all this is. 8 smoking cigarettes is drug -- drug 9 addiction, drug dependence. for a long time, 10 it was a secret epidemic of drug dependence, 11 because people did not know, because the tobacco 12 industry played down the role of nicotine. 13 and we will get into very great detail 14 there, but this is just a nicotine-delivery 15 device. it is nothing but drugs. 16 it is hard to wrap your mind around it 17 because it looks like a completely normal 18 consumer product. and i'll show you some 19 similar-looking packages that you can ask, do 20 these look bad? 21 if a child -- 22 if a youngster is holding up a pack of 23 camel -- camel cigarettes, with a nice little 24 camel on it, if a child holds this package up 25 and asks his dad -- a five-year-old, a six-year-old, a seven-year-old -- asks his dad, 2 dad, what is this, and a dutiful parent, 3 discharging his responsibility to guide his son 4 towards the -- down the path of the true and 5 narrow, says, oh, son, that is bad, that is bad, 6 well, the son may respond, but, dad, it does not 7 look bad. 8 i mean, i have toy camels in my 9 collection. kids collect toy camels. is a toy 10 camel bad when you buy safari animals? is that 11 bad? 12 why is this camel bad? it is got pretty 13 blue colors. why is that bad? so we will talk 14 about that. 15 the idea is that these look like normal 16 consumer products. you cannot tell the 17 difference. it is like that old game we used to 18 play, one of these things is not like the 19 other, one of these things just does not belong. 20 a pack of pall malls, a color scheme 21 like a hot wheels toy car, a color scheme like 22 a -- like a pack of cards, jolly ranchers. 23 in other words, it looks like a normal 24 consumer product. it does not look like heroin, 25 it does not look like cocaine, is not illegal, but it is an epidemic of drug addiction that 2 exists in our country because -- 3 and when folks say, well, why is this 4 epidemic so difficult to eradicate? it is 5 because there is a powerful industry that 6 depends upon its perpetuation. 7 and this is historical news going back to 8 the '50s, no doubt, but it bears examination 9 today. it is not old news. it is new news. 10 if it was not new news, we would not have 11 things like the surgeon general's report, which 12 comes out every two years, and as recently as 13 2014 -- and this is in evidence -- as recently 14 as 2014 -- 15 oh, and by the way, dr. prochaska is 16 referenced in this book. it comes out as 17 recently as 2014, and it teaches us quite a bit 18 and it explains the tobacco industry's 19 extensive campaign to counteract the forces 20 through marketing and public relations, 21 political influence, and the creation of doubt 22 about the scientific evidence on tobacco is 23 know -- is now well documented through the 24 industry's internal documents. 25 the industry, itself, used its influence to thwart public health action at all levels 2 and fraudulently misled the public on many 3 issues, including whether low-yield cigarettes 4 conveyed less risk to health and whether 5 exposure to secondhand smoke harmed nonsmokers. 6 undoubtedly, these actions slowed progress in 7 tobacco control. so -- 8 and there is more in here. that is 9 page 34. i want you to be thinking about that, 10 because these are in evidence. these stand -- 11 right now, this is current, cutting-edge 12 treatment and current cutting-edge analysis. 13 and the focus now, in 2014, 50 years later, is 14 the scientists, the public health researchers, 15 the -- the folks that are protecting us through 16 the federal government public health agencies, 17 they are diving into this amazing archive of 18 prior secret records of the tobacco industry to 19 come to important conclusions about what they 20 did to the citizenry that led to the 20 million 21 deaths even since 1964. 22 now, that is a big number, it is hard to 23 wrap your mind around, but we will talk about it 24 in no small detail. 25 so the simple truth is, these are the two things that are so important to understand: 2 all smoking is based on youth, and it is nothing 3 but drug addiction. that is what smoking is. 4 and we will go into the detail of it. 5 now, you know, one of the things we 6 did -- and i must tell you this -- is we went 7 through this trial and we presented a lot of 8 evidence. and part of the reason is because we 9 do not know how much you need. 10 you know, we say, when you come into this 11 courtroom, i thought i knew. i knew something 12 about the tobacco companies. i thought i knew. 13 but i say, now that you have learned some 14 of this and heard the lessons that dr. proctor 15 and dr. prochaska offered about what the 16 tobacco industry's motives were, and what they 17 were all about, i say, now you know. 18 and it reminds me of an elton john 19 song -- some of you may know elton john, or 20 not -- but the honky chateau album had a song 21 called mona lisas and mad hatters. and there is 22 a line in there where he says, "i thought i 23 knew, but now i know." 24 and i think, for you jurors, hopefully, 25 if you see this our way, if we have stitched this together correctly for you, maybe you will see 2 this our way and you will -- you will think, now i 3 know. 4 hopefully, we did not give you too much 5 evidence. we do not know how much evidence you 6 need, but, hopefully, we did not give you too 7 much. 8 now, why? why? 9 this is why: because back as early as 10 the '60s, and even after the surgeon general 11 was trying to get the message out, the surgeon 12 general they belittled and smeared and 13 attacked, they knew cigarette smoke is a drug, 14 but there were dangerous implications to the 15 fda finding out about that, should that secret 16 get out. 17 we have got the goods on them now. we have 18 their internal secret industry documents that 19 were never meant to see the light of day. and 20 we are going to talk about that. 21 the fact is, is that this report here, on 22 page 105, in no uncertain terms establishes 23 that nicotine addiction is the fundamental 24 reason that tobacco -- that -- that smokers 25 persist in using tobacco products. page 105. and this persistent use 2 contributes to many diseases described in this 3 report. 4 that is the concept that addiction causes 5 disease. dependence -- it is an interchangeable 6 word. dependence causes disease. 7 and one of the things -- and i'm going to 8 go aside real quick, because i've got a great 9 outline here, but i never stay on it because 10 i'm just going to ramble, but i'll get the 11 points across -- is dr. agharkar, i heard him 12 the other day, was talking about never having 13 heard of the fagerstrom. 14 page 106, okay -- 15 the fagerstrom report is in page 106 of 16 the nicotine section, and it is regarded as one 17 of the most prominent instruments that the 18 physicians have and use to determine the degree 19 or severity of dependence to smoking, is the 20 nicotine tolerance questionnaire. 21 and that whole questionnaire is laid out 22 here, just like the dsm has got a structured 23 questionnaire that you use to make sure you get 24 the answers right on the dsm, that 25 dr. prochaska explained to you we used, and dr. agharkar said he knew nothing about it. 2 so we are going to discuss the relative 3 weights, values and merits of the experts in 4 this case. 5 there is even a section here that says: 6 an indice of smoking reinforcement or 7 persistence are related to a high level of 8 addiction. these indicate a longer duration of 9 smoking, young age of smoking initiation, no 10 previous attempt to stop smoking, and a shorter 11 duration of abstinence during previous attempts 12 to stop smoking. 13 119. the definitive statement. this 14 is not -- this is not one guy. there are 15 hundreds of researchers, scientists, 16 biologists, doctors of every ilk, professors 17 from all over the country. 18 you are going to look at this document and 19 you will see hundreds of physicians nationwide 20 contribute to this highly peer-reviewed, highly 21 vetted, very cautiously stated scientific 22 conclusion, without exaggeration. they are very 23 cautious. 24 but on page 119, they say: sometimes one 25 big indice of addiction is that you did not stop or you had short periods of time to stop. 2 smoking a long time without stopping is 3 an important sign of addiction, just like 4 smoking in the face of harmful consequences. 5 so we heard a lot of statements from the 6 defense, and the defense would say, somebody 7 said it was bad, to her; someone told her it 8 was bad; the family members excoriated her. 9 mom, come on, we have got to do something about 10 this. 11 but the addict is in denial, and if 12 you are hearing countervailing messages from a 13 tobacco industry, saying, smoke filters, it is 14 not bad, we still need more study, you were 15 demotivating an addict. it is "operation 16 stumbling block," and it worked. and we will go 17 through that. it worked. but what is the -- 18 what is the -- 19 this is addiction causation. there is 20 several other places where the science says, of 21 course addiction causes disease. here's one. 22 and are you going to run that? 23 (the video clip was played and taken down 24 to the best of the reporter's ability as 25 follows:) voice: we should also give priority to 2 the one addiction, tobacco addiction, that is 3 killing more than 300,000 americans each year. 4 (video clip concluded.) 5 mr. schlesinger: tobacco addiction 6 killing more than 300,000 americans a year in 7 1988. 8 now, with our understanding of science 9 and all of the broad panoply of medical 10 diseases that are caused by smoking, it is 11 540,000 american deaths per year. two-thirds, 12 one in -- 13 two out of every three persons who smoke 14 for an excessive period of time will die of a 15 tobacco-related disease. this is a current 16 epidemic that needs to continue to be examined 17 because it is the number one killer in the 18 united states. one in every five deaths. 19 if you eliminated tobacco, it would be 20 the equivalent of coming up with a vaccine that 21 cured all of -- all of -- one-third of all 22 cancers -- 23 mr. furr: objection. 24 mr. schlesinger: -- in this united 25 states. the court: what is the objection, 2 counsel? 3 mr. furr: to -- 4 the court: overruled. this is argument. 5 mr. schlesinger: and this is on page 652 6 of the surgeon general's report, 2010, a 7 revolutionary current exhibit, talking about if 8 the population ceased smoking, this single 9 behavior would be tantamount to a vaccine 10 against one-third of cancer deaths. 11 can you imagine? we are spending all of 12 this time to cure cancer, and you know what? 13 we can get one -- rid of one-third of it right 14 now, because of cigarettes. 15 and what did dr. proctor's book say? 16 what did dr. proctor's book say? 17 the title of it says: the golden 18 holocaust -- a holocaust made of profitable 19 goals -- origins of the cigarette catastrophe 20 and the case for abolition. 21 "abolition" means freedom from 22 enslavement. 23 mr. furr: objection. 24 the court: sustained. 25 mr. schlesinger: in any event -- mr. furr: move to strike the last 2 comment, your honor. 3 the court: disregard the last comments, 4 ladies and gentlemen. 5 mr. schlesinger: you can use your common 6 understanding of what the word "abolition" 7 means, but the point is -- 8 mr. furr: objection, your honor. the 9 objection was sustained. 10 the court: as to a different word, not 11 to "abolition." 12 let us go. 13 mr. schlesinger: okay. so, in any 14 event, the -- 15 this is an 800-page book. had there been 16 anything in there worth contradicting, a 17 skillful attorney would have, from the defense, 18 from the -- lorillard, and mr. furr would have 19 challenged him with something that helped his 20 case. but not one word in this 800-page book 21 was ever referred to on cross-examination. 22 they are the words of dr. proctor. this 23 book is a revelation. it is a great 24 contribution to public health and it is very 25 helpful. so the -- we played the video, right? 2 let us go to the next one. 3 anyway, it says there: nicotine 4 addiction goes -- leads to lung cancer. that is 5 in the 2000 surgeon general's report. it is in 6 evidence. you can see it, okay? 7 did i put the page number up there? 8 i do not see the page number, but it is in 9 evidence. now, let us play that. 10 (the video clip was played and taken down 11 to the best of the reporter's ability as 12 follows:) 13 voice: we want to be the detectives just 14 as much as the surgeon general and the ama, and 15 we will cooperate in every way. 16 voice: well, obviously, a filter takes 17 out certain tar and nicotine. i do not think 18 the industry admits there are any bad elements. 19 if there are bad elements, through our 20 laboratories, through the surgeon generals, 21 through the ama, through acts of god and luck, 22 we hope we may find them. and if they are 23 found, they will be removed. 24 voice: we -- we do talk to the question 25 of whether or not cigarettes are hazardous. we do not believe that cigarettes are hazardous. 2 we do not accept that, because when, as and if 3 any ingredient in cigarette smoke is identified 4 as being injurious to human health, we are 5 confident that we can eliminate that 6 ingredient. 7 voice: do you believe that cigarettes 8 are safe? have they been proven to be safe, 9 mr. cullman? 10 voice: i believe they have not been 11 proven to be unsafe. 12 (video clip concluded.) 13 mr. schlesinger: these are the chief 14 executive officers going, as dr. proctor said, 15 thousands and thousands of times to deny that 16 cigarettes caused harm so that they could keep 17 smokers smoking. 18 and you will see as we go through this, 19 you get a guy like cullman, and i see that 20 cheshire cat grin and that smarmy demeanor, and 21 he says: if there is any bad elements, they 22 will be removed. 23 and the fact of the matter is, is the 24 worst element is nicotine. 25 so dr. prochaska testified about the fact that you cannot just look at the smoker. the 2 problem is, you have to look at the cigarettes 3 flowing down the river from the manufacturers. 4 if there was not that flow, it would be -- that 5 would be -- there would not be the problem of 6 nicotine. 7 and he talked about whether ms. mccoy 8 quitting is a success story, and it is not. 9 but, you know, his concern is, is that there 10 are, even to this day, researchers who are 11 putting evidence into the society for research 12 on nicotine and tobacco, and confusing whether 13 or not there are permanent -- 14 this is the wrong one. 15 mr. gdanski: the next slide. 16 mr. schlesinger: wait, hang on. let me 17 stay on this one. i'm sorry. 18 in any event, her point here is, this is 19 a cycle. there are smokers that come out and 20 die, there are replacement smokers that come 21 in, and she says it is a big business, one of 22 the biggest businesses in the nation. 23 in a case like today -- 24 because they have said this industry's 25 powerful for more nations. in the jury system we have in this country, you hold great power. 2 you have the ability to speak truth to power. 3 you have heard evidence that it is a 4 powerful industry, and you get to make a 5 determination, on a level playing field -- my 6 client, mr. mccoy, his family is here, they get 7 to stand toe to toe with the tobacco 8 companies -- and you get to make the decisions 9 as to whether you can speak truth to power; but 10 you hold power that -- 11 you may hold more power in this case than 12 you have ever held in your life. so it is an 13 important and significant opportunity for you 14 to do that. 15 and one of the arrogance of power is that 16 actions can be reprehensible. remember the 17 waxman hearings and the ceos getting up in '94, 18 when it was no longer really a debate in the 19 public that cigarettes caused cancer and that 20 they were deeply addictive? 21 it was six years after koop had said, 22 yeah, this is as addictive as heroin and 23 cocaine. they got up and lied before congress. 24 that is an arrogance of power to be able to do 25 that. it was not received well by the -- by the public, but it was important to see. 2 so, also, dr. prochaska talked about that 3 the changes in the brain are believed to be 4 permanent; and while there is some debate in 5 the field, she perceives that the tobacco 6 industry is hard at work creating ambiguity, 7 because there were tobacco industry people at 8 her conference, trying to submit information, 9 and did not disclose the fact that they were 10 funded by tobacco. 11 and do not you remember that dr. proctor 12 said that was true back even in the '50s and 13 '60s, with the ama, who they paid $20 million 14 not to appoint and support the 1964 surgeon 15 general's report? 16 so this was a very strong campaign to 17 counteract the effects of the public health 18 authority. 19 now, what about our client? because you 20 heard -- 21 the last you heard was agharkar. we will 22 talk about him. i mean, he has courtroom 23 experience. he is not on any staff of any 24 hospital to treat patients. 25 and, believe me, there are such things as psychiatric emergencies. a real active, 2 practicing psychiatrist, with a boatload of 3 patients who are suffering from such terrible 4 things as depression, they can have suicidal 5 ideation. if they end up needing a hospital 6 admission, a doctor who is really practicing 7 full-service psychiatry needs a hospital 8 setting to admit patients or go see them. he 9 admitted he did not even see them. 10 he admitted the bulk of his work was 11 getting money, testifying in court; and his 12 credential was, i'm a forensic credential 13 [sic], i'm a courtroom expert. 14 but in terms of his actual credentials, 15 telling you what is the -- what it is on tobacco 16 addiction, he had to contradict every single 17 thing out there, including the surgeon 18 general's report, including dr. prochaska, who 19 teaches the addiction psychiatrists how to 20 determine addiction. 21 and, quite frankly, dr. prochaska, as you 22 well know, if those were the answers she heard 23 from one of her students, they probably 24 would not get -- 25 mr. furr: objection. mr. schlesinger: -- a very good grade in 2 that class. 3 the court: sustained. 4 mr. schlesinger: so, you know, this is 5 the tamol document. this shows, in no 6 uncertain times -- in no uncertain terms, as 7 early as the '60s, that the research at philip 8 morris was to make sure that when those light 9 cigarettes were coming in, that they would not 10 remove so much nicotine or lower the light 11 cigarettes to the point where they would lose 12 smokers, they would wean them off nicotine, and 13 they said, in no uncertain terms, we need to 14 make sure we keep the normal smoker hooked. 15 keep that nicotine so the smoker gets hooked. 16 and prochaska said the same thing, that 17 hook is pulling you along. it pulls you along 18 towards addiction, it maintains addiction. 19 they said she was -- 20 they said the family said, mom, what is 21 wrong with you? are you blind? 22 well, i say that is good testimony for us. 23 yes, that is the nature of the blindness caused 24 by addiction. the definition of "addiction" is 25 smoking despite the knowledge of harmful consequences. 2 so when you are smoking even though -- 3 even when you know -- and she knew more in the 4 '80s -- that it is bad for you, and you continue 5 to smoke, that shows the power of addiction. 6 and dr. prochaska explained that to you when 7 she testified that to you. 8 so she is blinded by her innocence, you 9 know? she was blinded by addiction. 10 but, to the contrary, the tobacco 11 industries eye's were wide open, and what they 12 were pursuing was greed. they were about 13 making money and making profit, and they did not 14 care about the health of their customers. they 15 did not care what happened to them. they chose 16 profits over causing addiction, causing harm. 17 that was a profit center. 18 and so it begs the question, if a friend 19 of a friend came to a person on the street and 20 said, hey, i got this great business idea and 21 we are going to make tons of money, people are 22 going to eat this stuff up, some kind of 23 special product, no one is going to be able to 24 get enough of it and we are going to make tons 25 of money, they are going to eat it -- they are not going to be able to stop taking it, but 2 it is going to kill half or two-thirds of the 3 users, would a moral person go into that 4 business -- 5 mr. tepikian: objection, your honor. 6 the court: sustained. 7 mr. schlesinger: would somebody go into 8 that business with a -- with -- as a good-faith 9 basis, would they take that business? 10 well, this industry did. 11 so prochaska talked about hooked, and the 12 fact of the matter is, i want to just -- i want 13 to share this with you. you know, the 14 tobacco -- tobacco companies in this case want 15 to pretend that glodine mccoy was not addicted, 16 all right? 17 but if you do not -- if you do not buy 18 that, they want a fallback position that if she 19 was addicted, it was her choice to continue to 20 smoke long enough to get sick; therefore, it 21 was her choice and not her addiction that 22 caused pvd, heart disease, copd, lung cancer, 23 and death. 24 but not one piece of evidence was 25 presented by either side that glodine's addiction was her choice. you know why? 2 because nobody chooses addiction. it is often a 3 terrible side effect of the choice to smoke. 4 just like some -- 5 just like addiction some people get from 6 prescription pain relievers. no one chooses 7 that addiction, but it frequently happens as an 8 unintended -- unintended consequence of the use 9 of the drug. 10 the point is that lawful but dangerous 11 drugs can have awful side effects like 12 addiction. that is why ordinary people often 13 say, about tobacco or prescription pain 14 relievers, be careful, do not get hooked. 15 why do people say that? because 16 addiction is like a fish getting hooked. the 17 fish chooses to strike the bait and then he 18 gets caught by the hidden hook. the hook 19 starts pulling the fish along. the fish starts 20 fighting the hook and tries to get off. 21 fish that are only hooked through the 22 side of the lip may get away, but those that 23 are hooked deep through the side of the mouth 24 are goners. 25 fishermen know this. that is why they use baits and hooks in the first place. but no 2 fisherman would ever tell you that the fish was 3 caught because the fish chose to get hooked. 4 the fish died because he did not see the hook in 5 the first place. 6 the teenage glodine mccoy in 1913 -- in 7 1940, at 13 or 14 years of age, did not see the 8 hook. she died in 1997. the tobacco companies 9 did not tell their customers that they thought 10 cigarettes were addictive until several years 11 after she died. instead -- 12 and they repeated it to everybody that 13 could read. and we know that glo read a lot, 14 that there was a substantial scientific 15 controversy about whether cigarettes were 16 addictive and harmful, and whether cigarettes 17 could get you hooked. 18 there were no cautionary labels of any 19 kind on a pack of cigarettes until 1966. and, 20 at that time, it was a caution. it may be 21 harmful, or, in keeping with the doubt campaign 22 and the campaign of confusion, it may not. 23 she had been smoking for decades. she 24 was hooked, hooked badly. she tried to get 25 away, but she could not. and being hooked eventually killed her. 2 now, the tobacco companies want to tell 3 you, being hooked had nothing to do with the 4 death of glodine mccoy. and that is a real fish 5 story for you, and they know it. 6 mr. furr: objection. 7 the court: sustained. 8 mr. schlesinger: glo -- 9 mr. furr: your honor, can we approach? 10 mr. schlesinger: oh, come on. 11 the court: counsel, i sustained the 12 objection. it is -- 13 mr. furr: i need to approach. 14 at 15 sidebar:) 16 the court: yes, sir? 17 mr. furr: my objection was sustained to 18 the argument that our defense was a real fish 19 story. that is an attack upon the defense. i 20 need to move for mistrial. 21 the court: thank you. 22 you wish to be heard? 23 there is no manifest necessity for a 24 mistrial. the motion is denied. 25 (sidebar discussion was concluded, and the following was held in open court:) 2 mr. schlesinger: in any event, glo chose 3 to smoke at a time when no one knew the real 4 dangers of addiction and the disease inherent 5 in cigarettes. 6 she started as a young teen in 1940. the 7 advertising and movies that attracted young glo 8 never mentioned addiction, they never mentioned 9 cancer. she had been smoking for 25 years 10 before the cigarette packs even said cigarettes 11 might be dangerous to your health. twenty-five 12 years. 13 in that amount of time, this -- the hook 14 can set deep. glodine mccoy was pulled along 15 by that hook for about 50 years until she 16 finally got off it, after having a heart 17 attack, standing on the precipice of the abyss 18 of death. 19 she tried to fight it, she could not get 20 off. maybe some of you will think she should 21 have tried harder. and that is fair, but that 22 is fault. that is not class membership, that 23 is not addiction. 24 and we have to -- we have to make sure we 25 do not conflate the concepts of fault with the threshold determination as to whether or not 2 she is one of the all floridians who suffered 3 from these diseases before 1996. 4 so, the cigarette will preempt food in 5 times of scarcity. i told you about this in 6 opening, i proved it to you during the trial. 7 you heard the testimony of scott mccoy. 8 and the internal marketing documents knew 9 this and anticipated it back in the '60s. so 10 the fact is, is that is a sign of addiction. 11 when i say "sine qua non," that is 12 because claude teague, senior research 13 scientist, brilliant man, enjoyed a career of 14 over 30 years at the -- at the rjr company, 15 made brilliant statements, you are going to read 16 three of his key documents: the 1950 survey of 17 cancer research, nicotine, and its crucial role 18 in cigarette smoking, and the important 19 thoughts of the youth market and capturing the 20 youth market. 21 those documents right there tell you 22 everything you need to know about what the 23 tobacco industry was about. 24 and in one of his documents, he said that 25 nicotine was the "sine qua non," latin for without which there is nothing. and that is the 2 truth about the tobacco industry. that is what 3 they said in that document, who ain't for more 4 money? do we want to tout cigarettes as a 5 drug? they are. 6 but they all say here: if we lose that 7 tobacco -- if we lose the nicotine in tobacco, 8 we could be out of business almost overnight. 9 we would all lose our jobs and our consulting 10 fees. philip morris and the cigarette market 11 would collapse. if we reduce and eliminate the 12 cigarette [sic] from our products, we shall 13 eventually liquidate our business. 14 and here is their -- here is their 15 confession: the lawyers remind us, i'm told -- 16 mr. tepikian: objection, your honor. 17 the court: sustained. 18 mr. schlesinger: the lawyers remind us, 19 i'm told, that the entire matter of addiction 20 is the most potent weapon a prosecuting 21 attorney can have in a lung cancer/cigarette 22 case. we cannot defend smoking as free choice 23 if the person was addicted. 24 this is in the '80s, before koop came out 25 in '88 and said, this is as addictive as heroin and cocaine; but they anticipated it and they 2 knew what impact that would have in their 3 ability to defend these cases. so this is an 4 important document for you to consider, and 5 it is in evidence. 6 here's my question: we are in florida. i 7 do not know if the florida lobster mini-season 8 is already over -- i think it is -- but lobster 9 traps -- 10 we talked about hooks, but let us talk 11 about lobster traps. cigarette companies 12 engineer their -- their cigarettes to make it 13 as easy as possible to start, as easy as 14 possible for children to start. that is the 15 basis of the business, the dirty little secret 16 that hides in plain sight. they make it as 17 hard as possible to quit. they do not want 18 their customers to quit. 19 my client, glodine mccoy, may she rest in 20 peace, she was the perfect customer. she fit 21 their plan to a tee. she smoked their 22 cigarettes, she smoked their filters, she 23 smoked their lights. 24 whatever they did to reassure her that 25 she was doing something safer and to undermine her quitting, they did it, and she followed 2 along like so many others like her. she fit 3 the business plan to a tee. 4 she was a beloved customer, one of 5 millions, except when we got in the courtroom, 6 except when her -- her husband, john mccoy, 7 decided to pursue this legal action -- 8 and he is an old man, and we are proud of 9 him for bringing this case -- 10 mr. furr: objection, your honor. 11 the court: sustained. 12 mr. schlesinger: in any event, the 13 lobster trap is this: it is really hard to 14 get -- really easy to get in. there is bait 15 inside, in crawls the lobster. it is really 16 hard to get out. 17 the question is, why should cigarette 18 smoking be so hard? 19 in the defense of the case, the 20 defendants would have you believe that she 21 smoked enough to cause her peripheral vascular 22 disease, her heart disease, her copd, her lung 23 cancer and death, but not enough to addict her. 24 that -- that does not make any sense. 25 look at her. she smoked all the time. she smoked for nicotine all the time. these 2 are just natural family photos, right? none of 3 these are staged. this is just taking pictures 4 of family, okay? 5 all the pictures of the family, so many 6 of them, in every one of them, you see what 7 she is got in her hand? 8 she is got a cigarette. she was a 9 cigarette smoker. smoking 20 cigarettes a day, 10 200 hits of nicotine to the brain a day is 11 because of nicotine addiction. 12 the preponderance of the evidence stands. 13 this is not a criminal case. you will make a 14 decision by the greater weight of the evidence. 15 on balance, who wins by the preponderance of 16 the evidence. 17 they -- they are going to say this is some 18 evidence, they are going to say this is some 19 evidence, we will show it, we are going to say 20 we have got some evidence that maybe is more 21 persuasive, more powerful, more reliable, and 22 we are going to say and prove to you that if we 23 tip the scales in our favor, not a criminal 24 case -- 25 raising a doubt does not get them to escape their responsibility. but when you are 2 asking all the questions, what is more likely, 3 what makes common sense, what is the 4 preponderance, the greater weight of the 5 evidence, better than a coin toss, what is more 6 likely than not probable -- 7 it is not absolute, so you cannot get stuck 8 on the, well, maybe something else could have 9 happened. there is going to be lots of maybes. 10 what probably explains this story, that is 11 what is important. 12 here's what the national institutes of 13 drug -- on drug abuse, a federal agency -- 14 dr. agharkar would not recognize it. i 15 wonder why. he said that this -- 16 this says that addiction is a chronic, 17 relapsing brain disease that is characterized 18 by compulsive drug-seeking and use, despite 19 harmful consequences. 20 all of the times they said that the 21 family said she said "shut up," she said, 22 you -- i think filters are better for me. 23 but, mom, this could kill you. are you 24 blind? 25 all of those things, that is the classic response of the addict in denial, the person 2 looking for a place to live within themselves. 3 they want to believe the message put out by the 4 tobacco companies, it might not be harmful. 5 they want to believe it because that is -- 6 if you -- if you give an uncertain 7 message, confusing picture to an addict, you 8 knock the pins under them. you undermine their 9 ability to forcefully get after quitting. 10 and when she was addicted as a teenage 11 girl, going all the way back to the '40s and 12 the '50s and the '60s, there was nothing about 13 addiction out there that was meaningfully told. 14 to this day, there is nothing that says tobacco 15 smoking is addictive. that is not going on. 16 anyway, nicotine is the center of their 17 universe. and all these documents that are all 18 in evidence talk about, we are in the business 19 of selling nicotine -- this is from the early 20 '60s, that is called the battelle hippo -- 21 nicotine is addictive, the dominant 22 specifications for our product is nicotine 23 delivery, nicotine is potent, the industry is 24 designed upon the sale of nicotine, even to the 25 point where if you put a hungry rat in a cage and give him a drug, he is going to press that 2 lever and press that lever. 3 and they say, smoking is the lever push, 4 using skinnerian techniques of operant 5 conditioning, showing how rats get addicted and 6 comparing those rats to the human smoker. 7 without nicotine, the argument goes, 8 there would be no smoking. nobody's ever 9 become a cigarette smoker by smoking cigarettes 10 without nicotine. 11 we got the goods on them. these were 12 never supposed to see the light of day. you are 13 seeing them now and you are seeing what they 14 wrote, what they said. and that is why we are 15 still studying them. 16 in the 2014, it says it is a treasure 17 trove, we are studying and writing research 18 articles all the time. 19 this -- and this is super important: the 20 cigarette should be conceived not as a product, 21 but as the package. the product is nicotine. 22 the cigarette is but one of the many layers. 23 think of the cigarette as a pack of a storage 24 container for a day's supply of nicotine. and 25 it goes on to say, it is a nicotine-delivery device. 2 you remember what dr. prochaska said? 3 this will shoot the nicotine to your brain -- 4 this perfectly engineered, down to two decimal 5 places, nicotine-delivery device, precise 6 nicotine -- will shoot the nicotine to your 7 brain faster than an intravenous and hit that 8 brain 200 times a day. 9 so smokers often smoke for the avoidance 10 of withdrawal. when that cigarette starts 11 wearing off, they get jittery, they get 12 nervous, and it gets to the point where they 13 cannot think of nothing else and they have got to 14 have that cigarette. so some of their free 15 will has been compromised, okay? 16 and very few consumers are aware of the 17 effects of nicotine, its addictive nature, and 18 that it is a poison. it was always promoted as 19 something that had to do with health. 20 and, again, the surgeon general's reports 21 that are in, talk about that when you 22 understand tobacco addiction, it helps you 23 understand why the tobacco user continues to 24 use tobacco despite the known health risks. 25 every one of the defendants' statements -- and there were many, many, many 2 of them -- about what she heard and what she 3 knew, particularly in the '80s when it became 4 more clear and she was more responsive to her 5 children -- plays along with this line: 6 knowing it is bad for you and smoking anyway is 7 a sign of addiction. 8 now, addiction in the class membership 9 does not matter for class membership. addiction 10 may matter for fault, and we will get to that, 11 but it also says that smoking is not a free 12 choice, because most smokers begin as teenagers 13 and then become addicted. 14 and then the surgeon general '15, 15 page 105, it talks about how difficult it is to 16 quit and how, in the united states, the 17 number one drug addiction, out of all drug 18 addictions, far and away is cigarettes. 19 you know, we see things happening with 20 cars and airbags and people being hurt, and you 21 think alcohol deaths or heroin deaths. they 22 pale in significance to the numbers. they are 23 a fraction to the numbers of cigarette diseases 24 in this country. it is an important, ongoing 25 epidemic. here's legal cause: in order for 2 addiction to be a legal cause, it does not have 3 to be the only cause. it can be in combination 4 and contribution of other acts. 5 so if she is smoking because she is 6 dependent, if some of the smoking -- if some of 7 that compulsive smoking is being driven by 8 nicotine, which we know it is, but also she is 9 enjoying it or she is not trying hard enough to 10 quit, that means that she is entitled to get the 11 contributing cause instruction to say that 12 smoking is a legal cause. 13 here, does it contribute substantially? 14 meaning, did the addiction play an important 15 role? 16 if she was not addicted to nicotine, would 17 she have smoked one or more packs per day every 18 day for 50 years? hundreds and hundreds of 19 thousands of cigarettes, millions of hits of 20 this nicotine drug, this short-acting nicotine 21 drug to the brain? 22 what is missing from here? in the class 23 membership definition, you will not see 24 anything that says choice has something to do 25 with -- with class membership. it is a threshold term. all floridians. maintain her 2 in the class where she obviously belongs. 3 she is got the requisite predicate evidence to 4 be there. 5 you can make these things as hard as you 6 want or as easy as you want. the records we 7 showed you and the tobacco addiction in the 8 chart, in two minutes, somebody can easily come 9 to the conclusion, yep, she was obviously 10 addicted, it drove the compulsive smoking, led 11 to disease, she is a class member under engle. 12 they want to escape their responsibility 13 by keeping her out of -- 14 mr. furr: objection. 15 mr. schlesinger: -- the class. 16 the court: sustained. 17 mr. schlesinger: or if the -- if they 18 kept her out of the class, they would not face 19 responsibility for the -- 20 mr. furr: objection. 21 mr. schlesinger: -- the engle lawsuit 22 findings. 23 the court: sustained. 24 counsel -- 25 mr. schlesinger: okay. all right. the court: -- i sustained the objection. 2 mr. furr: your honor, same motion as 3 before. 4 the court: thank you. same ruling as 5 before. it is denied. 6 mr. schlesinger: again, so this is 7 addiction as a concurring cause. it only has 8 to be a legal cause of disease, it can act in 9 combination with other things. it is not the 10 all or none. 11 but she was dependent on nicotine in 12 cigarettes, she was addicted, and you will see 13 that whatever the combinations were, taste, 14 flavor, whatever, it still contributes. 15 what did they say? did they choose 16 profits over public health? did they want 17 smokers to quit? 18 here are the documents in evidence where 19 they talked about a guy who was coming up with 20 a way to get a chemical that would block the 21 nicotine. 22 and what were they afraid of and why 23 would not they fund his program? because it was 24 having some great success. and this is back in 25 the '70s. remember, nicotine patches, nicotine gum 2 did not come out until the '80s. they slowed 3 the introduction of help to patients. they 4 did not care. they were not setting up 5 smoking-cessation clinics. 6 they were not fielding customers who were 7 30 years old, that had started at 14, who said, 8 you know, i want to start a family now, i've 9 been using your products for the last 15 years, 10 i need some help to get off, can you help me? 11 they did not demonstrate that. 12 they worked just like they did when they 13 boycotted merrell dow, who was introducing a 14 smoking-cessation product, the gum. 15 they did not want people to quit, and they 16 proved it by their actions as documented in 17 their secret records. 18 and, remember, there is an old chinese 19 proverb: the palest ink is much more vivid 20 than the brightest memory. 21 so what we have got nails down internally 22 the lies they were telling the public publicly. 23 and he said, if we let this guy come up with a 24 way to block the nicotine, we are in the process 25 of digging our own grave. and the question you have got to ask 2 yourself is, whose graves were they willing to 3 dig but their own? 4 mr. furr: objection, your honor. 5 mr. schlesinger: now, the program has 6 the potential to do great damage to the 7 industry. it undermines the public posture. 8 we have taken outsiders, they admit they are 9 lying, they are telling a different story inside 10 than they did outside, and that antagonist 11 could put the tobacco manufacturers out of 12 business. 13 the believability of witnesses. we will 14 get into this a little bit real quick. you 15 need to know that you have the power to decide 16 who to believe. you have the power to judge 17 the demeanor of the live witnesses. 18 so the folks that testified before you, 19 you get to look them in the eye, you get to 20 take some notes, you get the feel and measure 21 of what they had to say. 22 and who did we bring into the courtroom? 23 dr. prochaska. what a -- what a -- what a 24 well-credentialed, true scientist, working 25 deeply in the program. she demonstrated the gravitas. 2 we tried to honor this process by 3 bringing to you the world's leaders who are 4 contributing to the cutting-edge research 5 reports, who are dedicating their life to 6 figuring out how can we help people with 7 tobacco addiction. 8 and she is explaining, we have got to look 9 at what the tobacco manufacturers are doing, 10 because the tobacco epidemic is so recalcitrant 11 to elimination, because a powerful industry 12 depends upon its perpetuation. there is a 13 driving force. she called it a vector. 14 you know what a vector is. a vector is 15 that which spreads disease. a virus, a germ. 16 she described them to a vector. that is in 17 evidence in this case. 18 so when you consider believability of 19 witnesses, take prochaska. never been in a 20 courtroom before, never came to court to 21 testify, came to do a benefit for the clients 22 and public health. 23 dr. mannino, he talked -- he wrote the 24 chapter on chronic obstructive pulmonary 25 disease in the very current surgeon general's report, a giant in his field, a well-respected 2 authority, not only nationwide, but worldwide, 3 and came before you and was willing to describe 4 and explain and took of his time and came back 5 another weekend to be here with us, and i think 6 that dignifies the proceedings and honors -- 7 mr. furr: objection, your honor. 8 the court: sustained. 9 mr. schlesinger: similarly, dr. proctor 10 came and testified. the man has got tremendous 11 credentials. he is the world's leading 12 researcher on what he says is the origins of 13 the cigarette catastrophe, explaining what 14 happened. because those of us who forget 15 history are doomed to repeat it. and he is laid 16 it out. 17 and it will be studied for decades, 18 because 80 million documents takes a long time 19 to study. but those witnesses are believable. 20 now, when it comes to someone who is an 21 expert, how did you get to be an expert? you 22 get to be an expert because you do something 23 that distinguishes you. you dedicate your 24 life, you -- you study -- you are scholarly, you 25 contribute to the literature, you write, you teach, you want people to know, you commit 2 yourself on paper to what you have accomplished. 3 you have your colleagues read it for -- for -- 4 for veracity and accuracy, so that when it gets 5 into the journals to teach other people, it is 6 accurate. 7 our experts did that in abundance. their 8 experts did it not at all. and i will submit 9 to you, as we get into more detail in this, 10 that the power you hold is the expert witness 11 instruction which says experts are special and 12 why you may consider their testimony and give 13 it the weights it deserves. 14 if it does not meet with the bounds of 15 common sense, if you find that it contradicts 16 everything you saw in this courtroom, you may 17 reject it. you have that power. 18 so you may say, how could dr. -- how 19 could judge murphy let them say these things -- 20 mr. furr: objection. 21 mr. schlesinger: -- in this courtroom? 22 but he let them -- 23 the court: sustained. 24 counsel... 25 mr. schlesinger: the evidence is permitted because you were empowered through 2 the jury instruction to reject it. and i 3 suggest that you do reject it. 4 oh, so the strawman. i'll go back to 5 that. 6 so why -- 7 there is a false equivalency here, and i 8 must touch on it very quickly. the false 9 equivalency is that dr. proctor charged a lot 10 of money. 11 he is been drafted into this series of 12 engle class individual cases that are being 13 tried all up and down this -- this -- this 14 state, and he is pulled all over coming to 15 court. and he went to miami. remember he went 16 to miami right after our case? and i'm pretty 17 sure he is back in miami. if we go -- 18 when we go to punitive damages with you 19 all, if the timing is right, we will bring him 20 back in here -- 21 mr. tepikian: objection, your honor. 22 mr. schlesinger: -- to talk to you 23 again. 24 the court: sustained. 25 mr. schlesinger: in any event, dr. -- dr. proctor, here's what he did. here's 2 how he became an expert. he built a better 3 mousetrap and the world beat a path to his 4 door. remember that saying? 5 if you invent something, if you do 6 something, if you distinguish yourself among 7 the world's experts, and do something no one 8 else has ever done, and that information, that 9 scholarship becomes necessary in a court of law 10 where many cases are going on, you will be 11 sought out, as opposed to going to someone who 12 you call an expert, who has experience coming 13 into courtrooms but does not have any specialty 14 in nicotine, nicotine addiction, anything like 15 that. 16 that is not the kind of expert that can 17 match up with an expert who has built the 18 better mousetrap. 19 so it is a -- it is a shifting 20 justification, it is a false equivalency to try 21 to compare proctor merely because he charged 22 money over time because of all these cases that 23 are -- they are seeking to defy and to -- 24 mr. tepikian: objection, your honor. 25 the court: sustained. counsel -- mr. schlesinger: i misspoke. to try -- 2 mr. tepikian: your honor -- 3 mr. furr: your honor, may we approach? 4 mr. schlesinger: i misspoke, judge. i 5 meant to say "try." 6 mr. furr: i would like to approach. 7 the court: sure. 8 at 9 sidebar:) 10 the court: yes, sir? 11 mr. furr: i move for mistrial. once 12 again, he is basically -- 13 he is attacking the defense of this 14 lawsuit. and also on the cumulative effect of 15 all the attacks that have been made during the 16 course of his closing. 17 the court: wish to be heard? 18 mr. schlesinger: no. 19 the court: counsel, just -- you go into 20 the evidence. 21 mr. schlesinger: okay. 22 the court: do not -- do not go after the 23 defense, all right? 24 mr. schlesinger: okay. 25 the court: thank you. mr. schlesinger: i'm going back to the 2 defense's witness. 3 the court: the objection's sustained. 4 mr. schlesinger: okay. i will. i'll 5 watch it, judge. 6 the court: thank you. but there is no 7 manifest necessity for a mistrial. i sustain 8 the objection. 9 (sidebar discussion was concluded, and the 10 following was held in open court:) 11 mr. schlesinger: may i proceed? 12 the court: hold on, hold on. let 13 everybody get set. 14 all right, counsel, you may proceed. 15 mr. schlesinger: in any -- in any event, 16 this is why i use this imagery. i say, proctor 17 deserves to be here. he built a better 18 mousetrap. 19 here's what is undisputed, because this 20 will be on the verdict form, and i want to show 21 you -- i want to show you that. 22 not -- not yet. 23 this is going to be on the verdict -- 24 this is not on the verdict form. 25 it is undisputed, it is an acknowledgment and admission that reynolds -- 2 mr. furr: objection, your honor. 3 mr. schlesinger: -- and philip morris 4 admit that cigarettes -- 5 mr. furr: objection. 6 excuse me, sir. 7 mr. tepikian: objection. 8 the court: it is not an admission. 9 sustained. 10 mr. schlesinger: it is undisputed that 11 r.j. reynolds and philip morris have admitted, 12 through their expert, dr. klein, that 13 cigarettes caused glodine mccoy to get lung 14 cancer and die. there is no evidence to the 15 contrary. 16 that question is going to be on the 17 verdict form. there is no evidence to the 18 contrary. the death certificate says it, 19 mannino said it, altschuler said it, all the 20 doctors said it. even dr. klein admitted it. 21 now, here's what is interesting: the very 22 first time you heard in this courtroom from 23 anybody from the defense that there was an 24 acknowledgment and admission -- 25 mr. furr: objection. mr. schlesinger: -- that cigarette 2 smoking -- 3 the court: excuse me. sustained. 4 mr. schlesinger: in any event, you will 5 see that dr. klein acknowledged that glodine 6 mccoy died from cigarette smoking and lung 7 cancer caused by cigarette smoking. 8 and, so, when you get to that question on 9 the verdict form, did glodine mccoy's lung 10 cancer cause her death, the only question -- 11 the only answer you can check off is "yes." 12 some of these things, there is competing 13 evidence and you have to hash it out. there is 14 no competing evidence here. none. not one 15 reference anywhere to anything. no witness, no 16 expert, no medical testimony. that is important 17 to remember. 18 so here's the verdict form: was glodine 19 mccoy addicted to cigarettes containing 20 nicotine? and, if so, was such addiction a 21 legal cause of her chronic obstructive 22 pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, 23 peripheral vascular disease, and lung cancer? 24 and the answer to every one of those 25 questions is "yes." every one of them. now, there is something you did not hear 2 that i must touch on real quick here. there is 3 something you did not hear. you are not going to 4 be making any decisions in this case, you are 5 not going to be making any determinations as to 6 some of the issues you heard tried in this 7 case. 8 one of those important issues is, did she 9 have a heart attack -- 10 mr. furr: objection. 11 mr. schlesinger: -- before 1990. 12 that -- that is not an issue in this case. 13 that is not for your determination, you will 14 not hear it. you heard it from counsel in 15 opening statement. this will be something you 16 are to decide. 17 mr. furr: objection, your honor. 18 the court: sustained. 19 mr. schlesinger: the issues in the case, 20 you will see from the instructions and the 21 verdict form, do not ask you to make the 22 determination as to when glodine mccoy, who had 23 her heart attack, when it was. we -- the -- 24 you are not asked that question. 25 similarly, you will not be asked the question, you will not have to decide, you will 2 not have to debate, you will not have to weigh 3 evidence, you will not be confronted with the 4 issue of was glodine mccoy knowledgeably 5 suffering from copd back before may 5th of 6 1990. 7 those are not in this case for your 8 determination. you must remember that. do not 9 be confused by it. do not be looking for it and 10 writing questions and sending it out saying, 11 where is that question? 12 it is been handled, it is been resolved -- 13 mr. tepikian: objection, your honor. 14 mr. schlesinger: -- it is been -- 15 the court: sustained. 16 counsel, move on. 17 mr. schlesinger: okay. it is not an 18 issue for your determination. that is why you 19 see these questions. and the only questions 20 talk about did she have an addiction which in 21 some way -- a dependence -- contributed to 22 cause -- 23 was it a contributing cause of her lung 24 cancer -- i'm sorry, of her four different 25 diseases; and, ultimately, down here, did it cause her lung cancer. and we -- and it 2 obviously did. 3 and, then, dr. altschuler's testimony 4 verifies it. you heard it, you took notes, i 5 will not spend time on it, but he said the 6 vascular disease was a consequence of her 7 peripheral -- of her nicotine addiction. 8 mr. furr said there would be no proof 9 that cigarettes cause peripheral vascular 10 disease. there is no proof that cigarettes 11 did not cause peripheral vascular disease. all 12 the proof is that cigarettes caused peripheral 13 vascular disease. 14 both mannino, an expert we brought in, 15 and dr. altschuler, who came here not for 16 money, who came here to help a client, a former 17 patient -- 18 mr. furr: objection, your honor. 19 mr. tepikian: objection. 20 mr. schlesinger: -- for many years 21 later -- 22 the court: sustained. 23 counsel... 24 mr. schlesinger: in any event, this is 25 the testimony they gave. same thing with altschuler saying he was treating her for a 2 heart consequence as a consequence of 3 historical nicotine addiction. 4 so this question says -- 5 can i get this? can i have the elmo, 6 please? 7 this question says: was glodine mccoy 8 addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine; 9 and, if so, was addiction a legal cause of 10 these conditions? 11 that is the question: did the nicotine 12 addiction contribute? 13 and you will see -- 14 i need it back, the clicker now, please. 15 so, the wild goose chase. everything 16 having to do with pre-may 5th, 1990 -- 17 mr. furr: objection. 18 mr. schlesinger: -- is no longer part of 19 the case. 20 the court: sustained. 21 mr. schlesinger: the question you do 22 have to talk about is lung cancer. and because 23 you will be asked to determine if lung cancer 24 caused -- if her lung cancer manifested before 25 november 21, 1996. it clearly did, because the medical 2 records say, in no uncertain terms, that, on 3 december 6th, '96, which is where the diagnosis 4 was made -- 5 which, yes, december 6th, '96, is after 6 11/21/96. yes, it is. but remember what 7 mr. furr said in his opening statement? 8 statute of lim -- deadlines count; and even if 9 it is one day over or one day before, it counts? 10 well, one day over, one day before 11 counts. if she got the symptoms of lung cancer 12 that led to the diagnosis before december 6th, 13 '96, and before november 21, '96, she is also a 14 class member, just by virtue of the lung 15 cancer. you must remember that. 16 and the evidence and the overwhelming 17 weight of the evidence is, very simply, that 18 the medical record says the symptoms have 19 worsened over the past week, but they have been 20 present for the last month. 21 so december 6th, '96, goes back to at 22 least november 6th, '96, and that precedes 23 11/21/96, and, therefore, that is class -- 24 that is a -- that is a disease that appeared in 25 the class period. now, this is important to remember. and 2 there is a lot more evidence on it, and we will 3 talk about it some more. this is an important 4 thing to remember when you are making this 5 decision, okay? 6 and that is that the condition manifests 7 by showing signs and symptoms of what 8 ultimately led to the diagnosis. 9 so when you go back -- 10 when you have a record from afterwards 11 and you go back to what the condition was that 12 led to the diagnosis, that is manifestation 13 under -- under the terms of the law. 14 so this is an easy determination. she 15 gets that question answered. dr. altschuler 16 confirmed it, dr. mannino confirmed it. and 17 dr. mannino went on as far as to say that he 18 was going to explain how he had some x-rays in 19 the chiropractic -- in the chiropractic office. 20 so that is -- that is important. 21 let me tell you about that real quick. 22 let me tell you about that. let us put this in 23 perspective. 24 this was a woman who had a heart attack, 25 quit smoking, right, was able to finally quit smoking after she had a devastating illness 2 that -- that made her think she was going to 3 die. 4 then, years go by, and in the fall of 5 1996, she starts feeling poorly. and while 6 she is feeling poorly, her family is concerned 7 and they treat her at the chiropractic's office 8 for musculoskeletal, because she is got some 9 shoulder pain. 10 her son talks about around the time of 11 getting the halloween costumes in the quiet of 12 the car, he noticed she was starting to get 13 hoarse -- hoarse. she was getting -- 14 she was wasting, she was losing weight 15 and getting skinny, and she was looking frail, 16 and the family was concerned. 17 and, at some point, there was a chest 18 x-ray done in that chiropractic office, and 19 somebody saw something -- chiropractors, not 20 radiologists -- and they were worried, ma, you 21 got to see a doctor. 22 and she went to see dr. berman, who had 23 replaced dr. sherman who had retired, and she 24 went to see dr. berman on the initial office 25 visit on november 22nd, '96 -- which is what dr. mannino said, from the review of the 2 record -- x-rays in hand, x-rays from the 3 chiropractor's office for days later, x-rays 4 from before november 21. 5 and what did dr. berman say when he saw 6 it? he said, there is a spot on the lung. 7 now, think about that. what does it mean 8 in the common parlance of laypeople's 9 understanding when the terminology of a beloved 10 family member is expressed, saying, i see a 11 spot on a lung? 12 here's what it is: it is a punch in the 13 gut. it is the time when time stands still, 14 because everybody knows what it means. it is 15 terror, it causes panic, it causes the desire 16 in a woman who is already had a 17 cigarette-related disease to want to run away, 18 to escape, to -- 19 mr. furr: objection, your honor. 20 mr. schlesinger: -- flee. 21 it is completely nat -- 22 the court: what is the objection? 23 excuse me. 24 mr. furr: there is no such evidence in 25 this case. the court: overruled. 2 mr. schlesinger: to deny -- 3 the court: ladies and gentlemen, you are 4 to rely on your own recollection of the 5 evidence. this is argument. 6 proceed. 7 mr. schlesinger: is it natural from the 8 sequence of events to imagine the heartache, 9 the fear, the pain of hearing that term, a 10 "spot" on the lung? what does it mean? 11 mom, this is something, we have to do 12 something about this. we cannot -- we cannot -- 13 we cannot ignore this. 14 and they go and they see dr. berman. he 15 says, yeah, you got to see a pulmonology 16 doctor, an expert, there is -- this is 17 worrisome. 18 and then what did the family do? what 19 did all their testimony do? 20 you do not want to hear the other shoe 21 drop. if this is going to be my last 22 thanksgiving, let us spend it with the family, 23 if this is what it is going to be. 24 does not that show she knew what was going 25 to happen or could happen? maybe you could -- oh, i hope it is not that is what it is, i hope 2 it is not that is what it is. 3 and you get the family together and you 4 gather them in that small apartment. it is a 5 big family, and you gather them in that small 6 apartment and you have the celebration of life, 7 because it is -- they are afraid it is going to be 8 the last thanksgiving. and then they go -- 9 after november 22nd, with dr. berman -- 10 november 28th is thanksgiving -- december 6th, 11 they see the lung specialist. and what does 12 his note say? we will show it to you. 13 it says you have endobronchial lung 14 cancer, metastatic lung cancer, lung cancer 15 that is spread so much, when i reach into your 16 collarbone, i can feel it, and you are hoarse. 17 that is an invasion into the laryngeal nerve, 18 paralyzing the laryngeal nerve. 19 this is a death sentence. our experts 20 testified to it. it is a prognostically grave 21 sign. this is the sequence of events that 22 occurred going back into the august, september, 23 october time frame. and that is why dr. labi 24 documented that these symptoms, although they 25 worsened, had been in existence for -- for a month. 2 and what did their doctor say? you know, 3 we brought you heavyweight witnesses, and they 4 tried to counter -- counterbalance it with a 5 lightweight. they brought in -- 6 mr. tepikian: objection, your honor. 7 mr. schlesinger: -- dr. klein. 8 the court: sustained. 9 counsel -- 10 mr. tepikian: move to strike. 11 the court: the jury is to disregard the 12 last comment. 13 mr. schlesinger: we tried to bring in 14 excellent witnesses. they counterbalance with 15 a witness who has made no contributions to the 16 literature, has not distinguished himself with 17 books or records or anything that we could read 18 and challenge him on. 19 he does not exist in the research, he 20 does not exist as a professor in a university. 21 you could not find him researching for a great 22 professor anywhere. 23 and -- and what did he say? oh, i think 24 the symptoms were there for a week or so. 25 now, you think about what really happened in human terms during that period of time, in 2 that november time frame, and whether or not 3 that meets with the ring of truth, because i 4 say that -- i submit that i stitched this 5 together to you, and it does. 6 so here's the engle class period. what 7 was the defense in the case? 8 remember back in the olden days, in 9 hollywood, we had those trampolines in the 10 ground on hollywood beach, and you could bounce 11 really high on them. i mean, woom, on 12 hollywood beach, right on the boardwalk, as 13 kids, there were trampolines. 14 if a defense is -- is -- has an agenda, a 15 preexisting agenda, not to analyze the medicine 16 as to what really happened -- 17 mr. furr: objection. 18 the court: sustained. why do not you 19 come sidebar. 20 mr. furr: take it down, please. 21 at 22 sidebar:) 23 mr. schlesinger: i gave over all these 24 exhibits, judge. they were all approved. 25 the court: wait until mr. furr gets here. 2 mr. schlesinger: i did everything i 3 could not to have any surprise. 4 the court: i just do not want you to -- 5 you are basically -- it sounds like you are 6 denigrating defense. 7 mr. schlesinger: not at all. 8 the court: okay. well, that is what it 9 sounds like to me. 10 mr. schlesinger: not at all. i'm 11 talking about the concept -- 12 the court: thank you. that is why i 13 brought you sidebar, okay? 14 mr. schlesinger: okay. 15 the court: so i do not want -- 16 mr. schlesinger: i'll try -- 17 mr. tepikian: your honor, we will move for 18 another mistrial based on this. 19 mr. schlesinger: this is so tame. 20 the court: excuse me. 21 mr. schlesinger: this is so tame. 22 mr. tepikian: are you done? 23 this is absolutely denigrating to the 24 defense of this case in front of this jury and 25 we move for a mistrial. mr. furr: and on the cumulative effect 2 of all the denigrations of the defense. 3 the court: thank you. the motion is 4 noted. it is denied. there is no manifest 5 necessity for a mistrial. 6 just take it easy. 7 mr. schlesinger: yes, sir. 8 (sidebar discussion was concluded, and the 9 following was held in open court:) 10 mr. schlesinger: tell me when you are all 11 ready. 12 mr. furr: i'm ready. 13 mr. schlesinger: now, what i think was 14 interesting about this was this: remember the 15 exhibit that dr. klein put up, and it had a 16 calendar, and in red -- in really big red, it 17 said "end of engle class period"? remember 18 that? so that his testimony was -- 19 he demarcated the end of an engle class 20 period. he said, i think it was, you know, 21 december 6th, it was probably there for a week 22 or so. what does "or so" mean? he did not 23 define that. so he did not change the medical 24 record evidence. 25 and what i talked about, organic records, these are records that existed at the time. 2 nobody created them to try to make a 3 litigation. these are just the records of a 4 poor woman with a fatal disease, being treated, 5 family trying to dutifully gather those records 6 up -- thank goodness they had them -- and it 7 proves very clearly that she is within the class 8 period. it just so happens to prove it. 9 that is just the -- that is just the math. 10 that is just the math of it. 11 so these are the class members. you 12 know, as a class member, all these -- all these 13 apply, all these diseases apply. she got the 14 big four. she got hit with four of them, all 15 from smoking, okay? 16 there is nicotine is addictive, the 17 defendants put cigarettes on the market that 18 are defective and unreasonably dangerous, and 19 smoking causes all these diseases. 20 what is more, there was concealment, an 21 omission of material information that the 22 defendants knew were false, and they disclosed 23 it. and then they got together, they all 24 agreed to get together to -- to put out this 25 fraud -- because that is what it is, it is a fraudulent concealment -- and they all got 2 together in a conspiracy to hide the health 3 effects from smoking, with the intention that 4 people would rely, and they knew that these 5 material facts were not otherwise known. 6 so when they talk about what glodine 7 knew, the bigger question is: what did not 8 glodine know? 9 and all the things they concealed from 10 her are what she was relying on, believing in 11 filters, to keep smoking. and, like i said, 12 the palest ink is more vivid than the brightest 13 memory. 14 they knew and they said, we are going to 15 be charged with -- with making false and 16 misleading statements that promote the sale of 17 cigarettes. and you know what? it worked. it 18 worked great. 19 if you look at those charts of smoking, 20 every time they put out their health 21 reassurance message, up went the cigarette 22 sales. 23 john mccoy talked extensively about the 24 fact that glo believed that filters would help 25 her and that they were safer. you heard that testimony from him. and that was exactly what 2 the tobacco companies were shooting for. they 3 counted on it. she fit their plan to a tee. 4 she was the perfect customer. 5 they knew that doubt was their product. 6 they said, doubt is our product. they said, 7 the most important story is the one that casts 8 doubt. they said, look for some other factor 9 to explain why the people are getting sick. 10 the key word is "confusion." 11 and what did they give glodine mccoy? a 12 psychological crutch and self-rationale to 13 continue smoking. they put those fake filters 14 on the market. they were a marketing ploy, a 15 marketing gimmick, they were never meant to 16 work. they knew what they said was an 17 independent research organization was nothing 18 more than a -- than a holding pattern, a 19 defensive front. 20 and then there is lots of stuff here from 21 the surgeon general, you will see, talking about 22 how filters were actually worse, they caused 23 adenocarcinoma. page 163 through page 168. 24 there is major conclusions that explain that 25 clearly. the surgeon general 2010 said, hey, we 2 figured out they were faking us out -- faking 3 us out. the designs were used, these filters 4 and lights were used as a tool by the tobacco 5 industry to undermine prevention and cessation 6 efforts. 7 they said, with regard to kent, a nice 8 jolt of nicotine, and we are going to tell them, 9 here's our triple, quadruple filter, and it is 10 going to remove whatever harmful elements of 11 smoke are there. 12 this is what glodine mccoy heard, this is 13 what glodine mccoy counted -- counted on. 14 these kent cigarettes, the parliament 15 cigarettes, that is what she was smoking. they 16 were the health brands. 17 they got the reader's digest -- remember, 18 who did anti-smoking ads -- they were an 19 unwitting third party. tobacco used them as a 20 catspaw. they were able to see that they were 21 playing up on the fact that reader's digest got 22 duped and mistakenly started saying, use these 23 filters. if you are going to keep smoking, use 24 filters. and look what -- 25 sales went from four billion to 38 billion, because they had marketed kent as a 2 safer cigarette to still instinctive fears. 3 and john mccoy corroborated it. she 4 started using the filters. she used the 5 parliaments, the kents. she tried the filter. 6 she thought they were better for her health. 7 that is her relying on these messages. those 8 lies contribute. 9 health protections, scientists smoke, low 10 tar, recessed parliaments, low-tar kents, these 11 are the ads she was inundated with. 12 the monograph, i'll let you read it, but 13 pages 205, 207, and 233, say, in no uncertain 14 terms, kent was for health, parliament was for 15 health. 16 folks were smoking them because they were 17 concerned about their health, they were 18 perceived as being more healthy, and the 19 national cancer institute's monograph from 20 2001, number 13, that is in evidence for you to 21 look at in this case, the final conclusions, 22 page 233, say, in no uncertain terms, that the 23 filters were used to reassure smokers and that 24 they were deceitful. 25 now, here's my -- here's my -- there is a -- 2 the judge read a jury instruction about 3 circuitous. it does not have to be a direct 4 statement to glodine. it does not have to -- 5 i do not have to put in glodine's hand, 6 her sitting in front of a television set 7 watching the traveling truth squad, or bill 8 dwyer, or somebody. it can reach her by 9 circuitous means. 10 and one of the things that mr. furr 11 said -- and he is a very -- very bright, 12 formidable, well-spoken attorney, and he does a 13 good job defending his client, and he is -- he is 14 supposed to do that, but he made statements to 15 you in opening statement and in 16 cross-examination with dr. proctor, saying, 17 well, you know the government was supporting 18 filters, you know the government was promoting 19 filters. 20 the government was promoting filters as 21 an unwilling dupe. so if the tobacco companies 22 duped the third parties, the surgeon general, 23 and whatnot, and those third parties 24 unwillingly passed lies to glodine mccoy and 25 she relied on what they said, and they had been, in turn, relying on the tobacco 2 companies, tobacco companies do not escape 3 liability by misleading the government. it 4 just does not happen that way. that is the 5 circle of deceit. 6 so that is a circuitous way. she did not 7 rely on us, she relied on the government, but 8 you guys faked the government out. and it is in 9 no uncertain terms that the reliance does not 10 have to be on a direct statement. 11 this is in -- 12 you can read this, i will not read it, but a 13 circuitous channel reaching her; meaning, if i 14 use those -- if i have an unwitting third 15 party -- unwitting innocent third party like 16 reader's digest or the surgeon general and it 17 gets to glodine and that helps her undermine 18 her cessation efforts because she is getting 19 false reassurances -- 20 and you cannot -- 21 if you give an addict some place where 22 they can live in themselves, to believe maybe 23 this is not bad, you are -- you are demotivating 24 him. it is "operation stumbling block." 25 they are never going to be able to quit. and then what happened ultimately? in 2 19 -- 3 it took until 2008, almost over 40 years. 4 the industry -- the public health authority was 5 fooled by what the tobacco companies did, 6 conned by them. 7 finally, in 2008, they said, we are not 8 going to say you should smoke -- filters are 9 better, we are not going to put these numbers on 10 the pack anymore, because the -- the tobacco 11 companies cannot wrap their misleading tar and 12 nicotine ratings in a cloak of government 13 sponsorship. 14 simply put, the ftc will not be a 15 smoke -- smoke screen for tobacco companies' 16 shameful marketing practices. 17 and that is exactly what john mccoy said. 18 that news coverage, she would reassure him by 19 saying, i'm being told by the tobacco companies 20 they got their own scientists, they are looking 21 into it, they say, smoke filters, that is what 22 i'm doing. those will be better for me. 23 those statements were legion and they 24 were exactly what tobacco expected. the engle 25 findings say they made those misleading statements so smokers could rely, and she was 2 one of millions of smokers who did rely. she is 3 a typical -- play it, please -- typical generic 4 smoker. 5 (the video clip was played and taken down 6 to the best of the reporter's ability as 7 follows:) 8 voice: ...take the controversy about 9 cigarettes. in the 91st congress, a house 10 committee heard testimony from leading experts 11 on smoking and health. the record shows that 12 many of the country's most respected doctors 13 openly challenged anti-cigarette claims. 14 voice: and i have to disagree with you 15 in that we do not know what causes the ailments 16 that have been attributed to cigarette smoking. 17 voice: insofar as the correlation 18 between lung cancer and cigarette smoking are 19 concerned, no one knows. it may, it may not. 20 voice: cigarette smoking does not cause 21 cancer, yes or no? 22 voice: it is not known whether 23 cigarettes cause cancer. 24 voice: all right, sir. 25 voice: it has not been causally established. 2 voice: cigarette smoking -- no causal 3 relationship between cigarette smoking and 4 emphysema? 5 voice: despite all of the research to 6 date, there has been no causal link 7 established. 8 voice: the case is still open. the jury 9 has not come in. 10 voice: it may not be harmful, you are not 11 convinced? 12 voice: it may be or it may not be. we 13 do not know. 14 voice: do cigarettes cause cancer? 15 voice: i do not know if they do or not. 16 voice: i'm not in a position to give you 17 a "does" or "does not" answer. 18 voice: we -- we have looked at the data 19 and the data that we have been able to see has 20 all been statistical data that has not 21 convinced me that smoking causes death. 22 voice: we do not know what causes cancer 23 in general right now, so i -- i think that we 24 may find out what causes cancer and we may find 25 out some relationship which -- which has yet to be proven. 2 (video clip concluded.) 3 mr. schlesinger: thousands and 4 thousands, untold thousands of these messages, 5 along with a quarter billion dollars in 6 advertising promoting the message of health 7 reassurance, glamor, youth, all these things 8 were being promoted, all this time, and they 9 want to say, in this courtroom, glodine knew? 10 if she knew or she was supposed to know, 11 why did not any of them know? why did not the 12 tobacco executives know? if everybody knew, 13 why did not they know? 14 remember, in the ftc reports, they talk 15 about some beautiful ads, and they say they are 16 spending 365 to one, and they are saying the 17 surgeon general has no chance against this. 18 the message of this health authority, out 19 to protect the public health, is completely 20 overwhelmed, overwhelmed by the messages of 21 doubt being promoted by tobacco and the 22 pervasive ads and the beauty of the ads. 23 class membership is not about fault. 24 we will get to that. class membership is not 25 about fault. it is a simple threshold determination of addiction causing disease. 2 you are going to get to -- a chance to discuss 3 fault. 4 but when we talk about the reliance on 5 the lies, and the fact that she fell into their 6 trap and she was one of the ones that acted in 7 accordance with their business plan that would 8 continually shoot the sales of cigarettes 9 through the roof -- 10 cigarette -- 11 every time they would introduce a filter, 12 cigarette would go up. every time they would 13 issue a statement that it is not going to be bad 14 for you, we are getting to the truth of it, 15 cigarettes would go up. 16 the fact of the matter is, is how do you 17 know it matters to -- to glodine mccoy? 18 lies costs lives. what did not glodine 19 mccoy know? what did not she know? 20 did she know that there was a -- a 21 conspiracy formed by these companies, along 22 with these inde -- these -- these research 23 groups, supposedly independent research groups, 24 the ti -- the ctr, the ti, all these different 25 groups that formed a conspiracy to fraudulently conceal the legal effects and addictive nature 2 of smoking? no. 3 did she know they were hiring scientists 4 and doctors to mislead the public about the 5 health effects and addictive nature? no. 6 did she know they were misleading the 7 surgeon general, on whom she may have been 8 relying to some extent, and other public health 9 authorities about, go ahead, smoke the filters? 10 did she know that they were taking -- 11 they were embarking upon a plan to smear and 12 belittle the public health authority? 13 they were studying nicotine, 14 manipulating, knowing it was an addictive drug, 15 targeting children, with ninety percent of all 16 smokers start as teenagers. 17 knowing that cigarettes were killing 18 hundreds of thousands a year, and saying, i'll 19 never agree that smoking cigarettes even kills 20 one person, manipulating the levels of nicotine 21 with great precision and control to maintain 22 the buying -- public buying -- buying 23 cigarettes? 24 did she know that there were 70 25 causing-cancer agents in every puff of smoke she inhaled, chemicals like arsenic, cyanide, 2 radioactive polonium, that filtered cigarettes 3 were no safer and actually more dangerous, and 4 that they -- the conspirators were purposefully 5 misleading the public about the safety of 6 filters and lar -- low-tar cigarettes? 7 and what did they say about it? we are 8 going to keep them smoking with a psychological 9 crutch. 10 they studied the psychology, how do we 11 keep that addict addicted. an illusion of 12 filtration, a marketing gimmick. 13 and now, here, wrap your minds around 14 this. wrap your minds around this. 15 ninety-nine percent of all cigarettes, to this 16 day, have filters on them. 17 filters make smoking worse. they make 18 you have deeper inhalation in the lungs, deeper 19 tumors, adenocarcinoma, and yet we live in the 20 culture they created. it is all -- 21 it is super hard to imagine that filtered 22 cigarettes are actually worse, but the 2014 23 surgeon general says they are. 24 what is smoking? this is the surface 25 area of the mouth, right? that is how much surface area is in the mouth. 2 if you puff a cigar or a pipe, you get 3 some stuff in your mouth. i guess if you smoke 4 the heck out of it, it could be bad for you, 5 but there is nothing compared to a tennis court, 6 which is the surface area of the lung, which 7 allows for that unbelievably rapid bolus of 8 complete crack -- they called it crack -- 9 mr. tepikian: objection, your honor. 10 mr. schlesinger: they called it -- 11 the court: overruled. 12 mr. schlesinger: they called it crack 13 nicotine, freebased nicotine, ammoniated 14 nicotine, molecularly advanced nicotine, to 15 shoot to the brain so fast, no other way to 16 give it to you. and that surface area of the 17 lung has no taste buds. 18 what about these -- what about these 19 descriptions: taste, pleasure, satisfaction, 20 enjoyment? that is not what cigarette smoking 21 is about. it is about, do you inhale, deeply 22 inhale. 23 and they invented inhalation, they 24 perfected inhalation. get those cigarettes 25 deep in the lungs, shoot that nicotine to the brain, change that brain, a chronic, relapsing 2 compulsive brain disease. this -- 3 i'm not going to go through this again, 4 but you saw the -- you saw the factory, how 5 they add the urea and the ammonia and 6 everything else. tobacco -- 7 the tobacco industry guys, the philip 8 morris guys, they can bring whatever they want 9 here. they can show you their processing 10 techniques. they have the right to bring 11 whatever evidence they want to bring. 12 i did not see a demonstration in this 13 courtroom of what the current manufacturing -- 14 mr. furr: objection -- 15 the court: sustained. 16 mr. furr: -- your honor. 17 mr. schlesinger: the -- the -- 18 this is very important: they can 19 regul -- we can -- 20 this is 1963: we can regulate, fairly 21 precisely, the nicotine and sugar levels to 22 almost any desired level that management may 23 want. 24 1961, my smoker's a smoker for a long 25 time. is there something wrong with smoking 2 when -- when, arguably, one of the most 3 beautiful women in the world is sitting at a 4 table, with her oscar and her cigarette in her 5 holder? 6 i mean, what could be more beautiful than 7 that? what could be more glamorous than that? 8 is that conveying a message of -- of -- of 9 danger, talking about truth in advertising? 10 let me keep going. more manipulation for 11 inhalability. recon tobacco, vent holes, 12 additives, menthol, licorice, bronchodilators, 13 flue-curing and sugars, any one of which could 14 be changed to make this defective product -- 15 which it is defective by the engle standards -- 16 safer. 17 change the inhalation, change the -- the 18 addictiveness of it. make an arrangement that 19 nobody under 21 ever gets the cigarettes, 20 because all cigarette smoking -- 21 most cigarette smoking starts before 18. 22 if you do not get them by the time they are 18, 23 they do not start. you would lose ninety percent of 24 your business, but it would still be a 25 business. it would still be a profitable business. but they do not do that. they want 2 to maximize profits. 3 play this, please. 4 (the video clip was played and taken down 5 to the best of the reporter's ability as 6 follows:) 7 voice: what cigarette do you smoke? 8 you will be interested to know how the doctors of 9 america answered that question. 10 doctors in every branch of medicine were 11 asked: what cigarette do you smoke? 12 voice: something wonderful happens when 13 you change to philip morris. you will feel -- 14 voice: do not miss the fun of smoking, 15 do not miss the fun of smoking, mildness is a 16 pleasure... 17 voice: do you inhale? then you are 18 better off smoking philip morris. and here's 19 how you can prove it. 20 voice: let us take a winston break. 21 voice: that is it. winston is the one 22 filter cigarette that delivers flavor 20 times 23 a pack. winston's got that filter blend. 24 voice: yeah, fred. 25 voice: i tell you, pearl, winstons is good smoking. sure wish you could taste it. 2 voice: i am tasting it, granny. 3 voice: the dickens, you say. 4 (video clip concluded.) 5 mr. schlesinger: so talk about -- 6 they are making cigarette smoking look 7 safe and normal, and they are saying, something 8 wonderful happens. they are never using the 9 truth in advertising that -- to show chronic 10 obstructive pulmonary disease. they do not 11 advertise that. 12 they do not advertise a man in a 13 wheelchair with -- with an oxygen tank on his 14 nose. they do not advertise, like, glodine 15 mccoy laying in a hospital bed, having fluid -- 16 bloody fluid full of cancer drawn off her lungs 17 and a chest tube in place in the throes of 18 dying from lung cancer. 19 they do not advertise the truth about 20 tobacco. they advertise an illusion, a mass 21 illusion that has a powerful effect on 22 influencing folks and behavior and children to 23 take up the act. 24 they do not do truth in advertising. they 25 could, but they never show ads where somebody is reaching into a dirty ashtray to pull out a 2 cigarette butt. they do not show those, okay? 3 now, you know, john mccoy talked about 4 she smoked the -- she smoked her favorite 5 brands, the camels, the philip morris, the ads 6 were everywhere, and he thought those ads 7 definitely had an effect. 8 play this. 9 (thereupon, a video clip was played) 10 mr. schlesinger: remember, this is just 11 a clip of a clip. a lot of these videos are in 12 evidence, you may need a player to play them if 13 you want to watch the videos of the tobacco 14 people or the home movies. 15 i know watching other folks' home movies 16 is not so interesting, but here's a clip from 17 the thing. 18 now, look what we did. we stopped and we 19 went up close. and i want to show you 20 something. 21 can i get behind you guys for one second? 22 i want to show you something. let me go 23 back in time. i'm going to reach back to 1975 24 and i'm going to pull that magazine out of 25 that -- out of that film, and i'm going to bring it to you live and i'm going to show you 2 something she did see. 3 this is mccall's magazine, 1975. this is 4 that issue, and this was chockful -- 5 mr. tepikian: your honor, object. i 6 do not believe this is in evidence. 7 mr. schlesinger: this is in evidence. 8 the court: counsel -- 9 you are to rely on your own recollection 10 of what the evidence is. 11 mr. schlesinger: it is in evidence. 12 this is chockful of ads, and we -- we 13 took -- we took that extra little bit of study, 14 we checked the ad, and just as an example of 15 something that is actually in her hand, not the 16 1941 school book that mr. furr could not put in 17 his hands and that mr. furr did not quote all 18 the language of, but mccall's. 19 and what was in mccall's? one, meek but 20 not mild; raleigh extra mild. two, with all 21 the talk about smoking, i decided i'd either 22 quit or smoke true. and i smoke true. 23 now, what does that mean? people are 24 hearing about bad things, tobacco is marketing 25 to you and they are saying, keep on smoking because you can smoke true. true is a 2 cigarette like a parliament, a kent. it is blue 3 and white, it has the special filter. 4 these are the ads in the magazines. she 5 was reading them. this is in evidence. find 6 one word in this magazine that says smoking is 7 bad. except for the box warnings, find any 8 independent article in this magazine that is 9 saying that it is bad. 10 l&m, the proud smoke. in every -- 11 there is a little eve in every woman. to the 12 56 million people who smoke cigarettes -- 13 you have got to read this. i will not read it 14 now, but it is a whole thing about we have heard 15 some things and what are you going to do about 16 it and you are going to keep smoking, you are 17 going to keep smoking vantage. 18 the health reassurance message. she was 19 inundated with it, even in 1975. the magazine 20 is in evidence. you will see it. 21 newport, this is an ad they use to this 22 day. some of the more recent ads we put in, 23 you will see the same ad, all young people, 24 young, fun, healthy, vibrant, they are doing 25 good, alive with pleasure. now, truth in advertising. suffocated to 2 death with emphysema, died a horrible death 3 from lung cancer, died from heart disease, 4 pulmonary vascular disease, bladder cancer. 5 they never advertise the truth of what these 6 products do. they advertise something that is 7 an illusion, that is not an accurate 8 representation. 9 saratoga 120s for women. the longer 10 smoking, longer enjoyment, more smoke, more 11 cigarette, more nicotine. they are -- 12 look at this. they are happy, they are 13 sailing, beautiful young woman, good looking 14 young man. and the joke of the benson & hedges 15 used to be, it is so long, the tip would break 16 off. 17 if you had a child and the child is 18 climbing on a ladder to go in a swimming pool 19 and he is going to jump in a pool, and you know 20 the pool is empty, and the pool has a no-diving 21 sign, but the kid is not paying attention to it 22 or -- and he is going right by it. do you stand 23 there and say, go ahead, go ahead, you have been 24 warned; or do you do everything you can in your 25 power to say, stop, do not do this, this is dangerous, something bad's going to come of 2 this? 3 i say that we had all these warnings, but 4 you must keep this in context. the first 5 warning is a caution. it may be hazardous to 6 your health, it may not be. 7 and you are going to hear, glodine should 8 have quit. and you know what? we agree. 9 glodine should have quit. but you know what? 10 the tobacco industry should have quit, too. 11 they should have quit lying. 12 so glodine should have quit. she has 13 human weaknesses, human foibles. she could 14 have tried harder, she should have tried 15 harder, that will be for your consideration; 16 but when she should have done something, so 17 should they, too. 18 but here's what is important: in 1966, 19 glo was smoking for 25 years, without any 20 caution, without anything on a pack. by 1970, 21 she was a 29-year smoker. by 1985, she had 22 been smoking for 44 years. remember the hook 23 story? she was deeply addicted. 24 look at all the things she did to try to 25 quit smoking. everything she could. she listened to her family, she rebutted them, shut 2 up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut 3 up. i counted it. eight times. eight times 4 she said "shut up." 5 now, there is going to be an instruction, 6 sympathy does not guide your verdicts, sympathy 7 or passion or prejudice for our against any 8 party. and i'm showing you things which are 9 reprehensible acts, they are in the nature of 10 atrocities that -- 11 mr. tepikian: objection, your honor. 12 mr. schlesinger: -- deserve 13 condemnation. 14 the court: excuse me. why do not you 15 come sidebar for a second. 16 at 17 sidebar:) 18 the court: yes, sir? 19 mr. tepikian: your honor, he is using the 20 word "atrocities," and i move for a mistrial 21 and -- 22 i move for a mistrial based upon the 23 cumulative nature of all of this. 24 the court: thank you. the objection's 25 noted. it is overruled. this is -- this is argument. i do not have any issue with it. if 2 he uses the word "atrocities," do not worry 3 about it. 4 listen, i called you sidebar for one 5 thing. i do not know where you are going and how 6 long you anticipate -- 7 you have got roughly five or so minutes 8 left on your -- 9 mr. schlesinger: i'm just trying to get 10 through this, judge. 11 the court: -- on your direct -- 12 mr. schlesinger: if i got to take from 13 the back end, i will, but i'm -- 14 you know, these sidebars take away from 15 my time. i do not think that is -- 16 mr. tepikian: can i ask this? is there 17 anything displayed on the front of your 18 notebook that is showing to the jury? 19 mr. schlesinger: no, not at all. it is 20 blank. 21 the court: it is a blank page. thank 22 you. 23 mr. schlesinger: i just -- 24 i would ask the judge to consider giving 25 me an extra five minutes. the court: i'm sorry? 2 mr. schlesinger: i would ask that you 3 give me... 4 (sidebar discussion was concluded, and the 5 following was held in open court:) 6 mr. schlesinger: so when you consider 7 the reprehensibility, deserving of censure, we 8 ask you to consider this, to condemn it. these 9 actions by these companies are in the nature of 10 atrocities. that is why it is reprehensible. 11 it is things that do not meet with the bounds of 12 human decency. 13 i remember robert fulghum wrote a book, 14 everything i needed to learn in -- i knew in 15 kindergarten. be decent to people, you know? 16 so these are some things she did to try 17 to cut down. they knew that, fortunately for 18 them, it is a habit they could not break. 19 this is glo -- this is glo and john. and 20 i want to just -- 21 you know, i want to just talk real quick. 22 you know, look, we -- we were talking about 23 "shut up," "shut up," "shut up." they used 24 that term a lot. 25 there is an instruction saying, do not make your decision based on sympathy, do not 2 make your decision based on -- made on 3 prejudice. 4 and i want you to recognize that while 5 what we are showing you by the tobacco 6 companies is -- is bad acts, it is bad and we are 7 saying this is reprehensible, deserving of 8 censure, deserving of your condemnation and 9 merits punishment -- that is ultimately what we 10 are here for, for an expression of punishment 11 from the jury, to say in the strongest possible 12 terms, we do not want a company to act this 13 way -- that the -- the other side of the coin 14 is, no prejudice. 15 you do not act from a position of anger; 16 you act from a position of cool, calm, 17 dispassionate, deliberate jury. this is what 18 i've seen, i analyze it, i know it is wrongful 19 conduct by human and humanity terms. by the 20 same token, you do not apply prejudice. 21 and all in all, the -- the family is a 22 nice family, the testimony was nice. they are 23 decent folks. 24 the worst thing i heard was, in the 25 throes of -- mr. furr: objection to counsel's -- 2 the court: sustained. 3 mr. schlesinger: in the throes -- 4 we heard the word "shut up." what i'm 5 trying to say to you is this: you are also not 6 supposed to be affected by prejudice for or 7 against a party. 8 and we do not want you to be -- have a 9 prejudice against the tobacco companies, make a 10 decision based on the facts. we do not want you 11 to have a prejudice against our client. 12 and if you do not believe that, because 13 the word "shut up" was used, that someone's 14 trying to hurt the character of a client or say 15 she was some sort of person that said "shut up" 16 a lot, that could be prejudicial. 17 so try to set that aside and put it in 18 context with what it really means of an 19 addicted smoker in denial, in pain, trying to 20 find a place to exist and be comfortable, to -- 21 to live with themselves. 22 this is -- this is the family. we heard 23 that this was a romance story. she was his 24 beauty, right? he was mesmerized and smitten 25 by her. the durability of this marriage is from a 2 bygone era. it is so hard to duplicate that in 3 this modern age, but he tried to impart that 4 lesson to his children. you know, it was a 5 more innocent time. 6 even the advertisements, what they knew 7 back then, you have to put yourself back in 8 that time. folks trusted companies. if a 9 company said, we are going to do right by you, 10 folks believed them. 11 and, so, even john said, take me back to 12 that time. they had a nice life. this is his 13 favorite picture. remember he said, take me 14 back to the time. 15 you know, ultimately, we are going to ask 16 you for compensatory damages. they -- 17 if you could take him back to that time, 18 he would not want compensatory damages. 19 mr. furr: objection. 20 the court: sustained. 21 mr. schlesinger: so -- 22 mr. furr: move to strike. 23 the court: five minutes, counsel. 24 the jury is to disregard the last 25 comment. mr. schlesinger: so here's some photos 2 of the mccoy family. they are in evidence. 3 it is a nice family. you can see this. 4 you know, scott testified on how hard it 5 is on his dad, and how he was just -- she just 6 fade -- john said how he just faded away. 7 scott said how his father aged like ten years, 8 okay? 9 she died in his arms, okay? he said it 10 was his beautiful wife. it was devastating, 11 okay? 12 it was disastrous to her. and when they 13 heard that diagnosis, they -- they did not know 14 what to do. so it was just a horrible thing. 15 and he was stoic. he said, you are 16 bringing it all back now, and he fought back 17 tears. i thought that was courageous. he was 18 stoic up there. 19 mr. furr: objection, your honor. 20 mr. schlesinger: and he -- and he held 21 on. 22 you know, i thought of the movie -- and 23 i'm going to do this quick -- i thought of the 24 movie "on golden pond." and i've seen it. i 25 do not know if you ever saw it, but it is -- it is henry fonda and kate hepburn, and 2 they are an elderly married couple in love, and 3 there is a scene where he gets lost going to 4 the end of the -- of the path where he lives, 5 and he comes back and he is angry because he got 6 disoriented, and he said to her -- he said to 7 her -- 8 he throws down the thing, he says, i got 9 lost, i got a little confused, i did not know 10 where i was and i came running back here 11 because i wanted to see your pretty face. 12 and kate hepburn, who was a great 13 actress -- i mean, and this -- 14 i'm going back to his time. you may not 15 have known her, but she was a great -- a great 16 actress. she took his face in his [sic] hands, 17 and she looked at him and -- and she reassured 18 him, you know, that she loved him, they had 19 grown old together, and it did not matter that 20 he was confused and getting a little -- a 21 little befuddled and a little -- 22 she said to him, she goes, you are my 23 knight in shining armor. and that was the 24 climax of the movie. and it was a powerful 25 moment if you have ever seen the film. and that is how i think about him. he was 2 her knight in shining armor. they showed -- 3 all the evidence in the case was of a great 4 relationship the whole time. 5 so when you decide on the damages in this 6 case, you should -- and can we get that up? -- 7 you should -- you should award an amount of 8 money based on measuring the harm that has 9 occurred to john because the premature loss of 10 his wife over the last 18 years and going into 11 whatever foreseeable future they might have had 12 together. 13 he is 87. obviously, the future would not 14 have been that long if she had been here today 15 with him, but he is lost her for 18 years. 16 and i would suggest to you that if you 17 measure the harm, and you tell the family and 18 john, through your verdict, that we place great 19 value on your loss, that you could award as 20 much as $9 million for what he lost in the 21 past, which is a lot of money, 500,000 a year, 22 give or take; you could award three million, 23 you could determine that restorative 24 compensatory damages for the anguish, the loss, 25 are worth three million. that would total to 12 million. 2 let me say, i am not giving evidence, i 3 am giving a suggestion. you may say, that is 4 too much, i want to award less. it is 5 completely up to you. these are intangible 6 elements of damages, of love a man had for a 7 wife. they might not have been rich in money, 8 but they were rich in family. and they 9 continue to be. 10 and as supportive as he -- as this family 11 is to their patriarch, they said, we are not 12 mom, and you need to be together not only for 13 the good times but for the bad times. 14 and when you lose a child to lung cancer 15 from smoking, and he was stumbling around all 16 along and -- it hurt their children to see him 17 not to have mom there to commiserate. it is the 18 idea of a marriage and being together through 19 thick and thin, through the hard times, and it 20 means something. and our -- 21 and one of the defenses in the case was, 22 ancestors of john and gloria [sic] died of 23 tobacco-related illnesses and that should have 24 served as a warning to them. and now 25 children -- he is lost two children from tobacco-related illnesses, and that should 2 serve as a warning to him. 3 mr. tepikian: objection, your honor. 4 mr. schlesinger: that was the -- 5 the court: the objection's noted. it is 6 overruled. 7 counsel, comment on the evidence. 8 mr. schlesinger: the evidence in the 9 case from -- from mr. furr's questioning was, 10 this -- this should serve as a warning. and my 11 context is, perhaps they should not get credit 12 for that. 13 if tobacco has caused these deaths, 14 there is an instruction, punitive damages, 15 considering harm to others. you are going to 16 consider harm to the 20 million that have been 17 killed. harm to others, that is how you arrive 18 at whether this kind of conduct deserves to be 19 punished. and so i think that is important to 20 consider. 21 he is written down the numbers. we think 22 that when you break up -- 23 are you on comparative now? 24 mr. hammer: no. 25 mr. schlesinger: okay. so now, ultimately, you go to punitive damages, and i'm 2 going to go through this -- 3 oh, and what is it, the survival claim? 4 there is not going -- 5 in my opinion, based on the way this case 6 went down -- 7 there is a survival claim, meaning what 8 did glor -- what did glo suffer, what did 9 glodine suffer in the event that she did not die 10 from smoking, but she just suffered for many 11 years? 12 it is in the case. it is -- it is not going 13 to be -- it is not going to be a decision you 14 make. this is a death case. this is a 15 wrongful death case. there is all the 16 evidence, all the testimony. even on both 17 sides, wrongful death, you are not going to get 18 to this question. 19 if you do, mr. hammer has suggested 20 five million for what she went through since 21 the time she got sick in '91 with the heart 22 attack, for the six years until she died in 23 late '97, at the age of 70, that that should be 24 five million. 25 you are not going to get there, so please do not be confused by that. that will not be 2 your consideration because there is no basis to 3 say she did not die from lung cancer. they -- 4 they cannot argue it to you, they do not have any 5 evidence. 6 but going on to this -- 7 can i move on? 8 mr. hammer: yes. 9 mr. schlesinger: okay. you go to 10 punitives and you have to decide should these 11 companies be punished for what they did. and 12 you may consider harms suffered by others not 13 parties to the lawsuit in assessing the 14 reprehensibility or wrongfulness of the 15 defendants' acts. 16 remember they said, this is about glodine 17 mccoy? it is about glodine mccoy and so much 18 more. it is not just about glodine mccoy. it is 19 about the opening -- the major conclusion in 20 the surgeon general's report that says that 21 20 million people have died from the tobacco 22 epidemic. 23 the century-long epidemic of cigarette 24 smoking -- this is page 7 -- has caused an 25 enormous public health tragedy since the first surgeon general's report in 1964. more than 2 20 million premature deaths can be attributed 3 to cigarette smoking. 4 and who do they lay it on the feet of for 5 the first time ever in a surgeon general's 6 report in 2014, fresh news? 7 the tobacco epidemic was initiated and 8 has been sustained by the aggressive strategies 9 of the tobacco industry which has deliberately 10 misled the public on the risks of smoking. 11 so, as far as percentages are 12 concerned -- 13 is that ready to go? throw that up real 14 quick. 15 as far as percentages are concerned -- 16 and i'm skipping a little bit, but when you get 17 to comparative fault -- 18 this is -- this is the part that is not 19 addiction; it is comparative fault. 20 mr. mccoy is not able to see that he 21 thinks his wife did anything wrong, because he 22 thinks she is a victim as an addict. however, 23 he is willing and we are willing to accept the 24 fair share of blame. 25 if you choose to assign any for the human weaknesses, for the "she could have tried 2 harder" elements that could be a part of this 3 case, if glodine mccoy could have tried harder, 4 but her human weaknesses were such that she 5 did not, you can cut up the relative degrees of 6 responsibility so that they add up to a hundred 7 percent, any way you want. 8 we recommend thirty percent for each of the 9 three defendant companies, recognizing now that 10 lorillard has been subsumed by -- by reynolds, 11 but because it happened just before the 12 beginning of the case, there is still three 13 defendants, thirty percent, thirty percent, thirty percent 14 against all three co-conspirators all working 15 together to conceal, and ten percent for 16 glodine. 17 mr. tepikian: objection, your honor. 18 mr. schlesinger: that is our 19 recommendation. 20 mr. tepikian: we have a motion we will 21 need to make. 22 we can make it later. i want to reserve 23 that there is a motion to make. 24 mr. schlesinger: that is -- that is our 25 recommendation if you decide to find fault for her. 2 i would be honored and i would be in -- 3 i would believe the evidence supports a 4 zero -- 5 mr. furr: objection. 6 the court: sustained. 7 mr. schlesinger: i feel the evidence 8 could support -- 9 mr. furr: objection. 10 the court: sustained. 11 mr. schlesinger: the evidence -- 12 the court: no personal beliefs. 13 mr. schlesinger: you may decide that the 14 evidence supports a finding of zero for 15 glodine -- glodine mccoy, or you may decide the 16 evidence supports a finding for glodine mccoy 17 of 25 percent, or 35 percent, or 45 percent, or 18 55 percent. 19 you can do whatever you want. all i did 20 was make a recommendation. the defendants will 21 say it should be a hundred percent. so you get 22 the final decision. all we do is make this 23 recommendation. 24 now, can i go to the clicker -- go to the 25 clicker, please? so here's what we have got. where is that? 2 okay. in terms of harm to others -- 3 i'm going to do this quick. it is hard to 4 think about 20 million deaths. one death is a 5 tragedy, it makes the evening news. every time 6 we put on the evening news, we see terrible 7 things happening, our heart goes out to folks, 8 and we read about it, we learn about it, we 9 understand it because it is something happening 10 to a person, a few people, we see it. 11 twenty million is so big, it is 12 unimaginable. so i use this to say -- 13 mr. furr: objection. 14 mr. schlesinger: -- the numbers numb. 15 the numbers numb. you see the numbers are 16 huge, but they actually numb. 17 mr. furr: objection. 18 mr. schlesinger: this is the state -- 19 the court: overruled. 20 mr. schlesinger: this is the state of 21 florida. there are 20 million people living in 22 the state of florida. take a minute to put in 23 context these large numbers. 24 what if there was nobody in florida? 25 that is how many people 20 million people are. mr. tepikian: objection, your honor. 2 mr. schlesinger: that is how many 3 people -- 4 the court: overruled. 5 mr. schlesinger: -- twenty million 6 people are. 7 i say that america has been used as this 8 industry's ashtray. 9 mr. furr: objection. 10 the court: sustained. 11 mr. schlesinger: they stub out -- 12 this is about truth and consequences. 13 and i will tell you what i mean by that. 14 when you engineer your product to cause 15 addiction, there will be consequences. this is 16 about telling the truth and the consequences 17 the tobacco industry needs to face. 18 when you target children, there will be 19 consequences. when you lie to the american 20 public, there will be consequences. when you 21 offer up false solutions such as filters and 22 lights, which do nothing, there will be 23 consequences. when you commit fraud, there 24 will be consequences. 25 this is about the truth and how they need to tell it, and this is about the consequences 2 and how they need to face them. 3 i talked to you about surgeon general 4 2014. that is right on the page, page 7. all 5 the -- all the conclusions, we can skip that. 6 you stand at a moment in history. i 7 mean, you know, more people have climbed mount 8 everest -- 9 mr. tepikian: there is no evidence of 10 this, your honor. 11 the court: sustained. 12 mr. schlesinger: dr. proctor testified 13 on cross-examination with mr. furr about the 14 website, where on the website it says that -- 15 oh, yeah, on the website, it said that 16 what people should do if they are concerned 17 about smoking is quit; nobody under smoking -- 18 nobody under 18 should pick up smoking; and 19 children should never smoke; and if you are not 20 a smoker, you should not start. so if 21 they are -- 22 my question is, what business are they 23 in? if nobody that smoked should start, if 24 children should never start, if this was really 25 true and sincere and everyone who is smoking should quit, it begs the question, what kind of 2 business are they in? 3 forty million americans caught in a web 4 of tobacco dependence. that is page 5, surgeon 5 general's report, in evidence. glodine was one 6 of them. 7 here, how about this? all those 8 brilliant guys -- claude teague -- all those 9 scientists, all those researchers, how about if 10 you were curing cancer instead of causing it, 11 you know? 12 and if you have a -- a corporation here 13 that is described as the rights of an 14 individual, i say, very simply, if you are 15 going to be accorded the rights of an 16 individual, you also are faced to meet the 17 burdens of a responsibility of an individual. 18 if you want to be treated like a person, you 19 have to act like a person. you have to be 20 human. 21 and in what they did, this tobacco 22 company, with the rights of a human, you can 23 find have not acted as being humane. and that 24 is reprehensible and it justifies punitive 25 damages. clear and convincing evidence, you should 2 have lacking in confusion, because punitives 3 require more than the preponderance that i 4 showed you. punitives require more. you 5 should not be confused, you should be able to 6 get it, you -- all -- 7 and those internal documents, those are 8 damning, those really show we have got the goods 9 on them. 10 so there should be no confusion about the 11 confusion. there should be no confusion about 12 the confusion. there is no doubt about the 13 doubt. they had a confusion campaign, they 14 have it even to this day, according to 15 dr. prochaska. you should protect children. 16 you should not addict them, okay? 17 even in the '20s, they were getting after 18 prep school kids. there is glodine mccoy. she 19 was a replacement smoker for her parents that 20 died preceding her. and will her children be 21 replacement smokers for her? 22 we knew from philip morris that teenagers 23 were the rapid growing area in tomorrow's 24 success and tomorrow's customers, the base of 25 the business is the high school student, and these are 14 to 24, 12-year-olds. 2 and this is one i must read to you. we 3 have -- 4 this is from claude teague, on the youth 5 market, where he says: we must capture our 6 share of the youth market. we have 7 deliberately played down the role of nicotine, 8 hence the nonsmoker has little or no knowledge 9 of what satisfactions it may offer him, and no 10 desire to try it. instead, we must somehow 11 convince him, with wholly irrational reasons, 12 that he should try smoking in the hope that he 13 will for himself then discover the real 14 satisfactions obtainable. 15 that is cold-blooded. it is connecting to 16 kids and targeting them and addicting them. 17 and here's where they are talking about 18 12-year-olds and the younger smokers are the 19 only source of replacement smokers. and you 20 see how they throw that word "adult" in there? 21 remember the saying, only the guilty flee 22 when no man pursueth? remember the art -- the 23 pittman article, it is in evidence from 1975, we 24 are going to use -- we have used references to 25 "young smokers" and the "youth market," from now on, put that word "young adult" in there. 2 why was that? because this is so 3 incendiary that, even though it is secret, the 4 fear of it getting out, hopefully that would 5 give some cover. 6 character is how you act when you think 7 nobody is looking. and if they want to be 8 judged as humans, they should act with human 9 decency, they should be afforded the rights of 10 humans and the responsibilities, and this 11 corporation did not. and when you decide on 12 punishment, it is, in part, to deter other 13 companies from doing this kind of thing. 14 in here, it is very clear that if you 15 do not get smokers before 18, you do not get 16 smokers. the joe camel cartoon ads, you heard 17 about that, as young as you could get, internal 18 documents. 19 the proof is in the pudding. these 20 folks -- these folks created a business model, 21 a strategy, it was brilliantly conceived, 22 masterfully executed. 23 my client was caught up in it, as 24 millions of others were, and they -- and -- and 25 she went down the -- the river of that business, a roaring river of cash and profits, 2 until she died. 3 they talked about a crop of prospects in 4 1964, saying the youth have not picked it up, 5 but they are going to pick it up because the 6 backlog will join with the crop of prospects to 7 produce a healthy increase in the number of new 8 smokers, referring to themselves as healthy. 9 and so what do you do with a crop? you 10 reap it. this is van gogh. so what do you do 11 with a crop? you grow it, you reap it. 12 just like they talked about rats in a 13 cage, they also refer to their customers as a 14 crop, like a commodity, like we are growing 15 smokers, children. all tobacco use begins in 16 childhood and adolescence. if you do not smoke 17 by the time you are 18, most will never take up 18 smoking. 19 and how about this? this is from the 20 '60s. and is this a popular business plan? 21 we are thus devoting our business lives 22 to the propagation of lung cancer. cigarettes 23 have certain unattractive side effects: lung 24 cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and 25 emphysema. this is in the '60s. would not it be wonderful if we produced a 2 cancer-free cigarette? they told the public, 3 let the scientists do the worrying and you go 4 on smoking. 5 now, the frank statement, which we have 6 here, but i'll just do it this way: let us look 7 at the promises of this frank statement, 1953, 8 promises by the defendant. 9 they said: we accept an interest in 10 people's health as a basic responsibility 11 paramount to every other consideration in the 12 business. 13 and what does it say in their internal 14 document? "who ain't for more money?" 15 so, really, that was the motive. you 16 could find that was the profit motive, over the 17 lives of people, over children, over the health 18 of the customers, over the health of -- of 19 americans. 20 we have always and will always cooperate 21 closely with those whose task it is to 22 safeguard the public health. this is the 23 promise in every newspaper in the country in 24 1953, during the cancer scare, to still quiet 25 fears. and what do they say they are going to do 2 to wynder and others? they are going to smear 3 them and belittle them. 4 and we are going to try to smear them. 5 and did not they do that? they said they would 6 put out there all kinds of comments that the 7 surgeon general -- 8 they did not agree with him. and they 9 even have -- 10 i think they had an expert here today 11 that said, i do not agree with the surgeon 12 general. 13 now, here, critics have held it 14 responsible for all diseases, for years and 15 years. one by one, these charges are abandoned 16 for lack of evidence. 17 and what do they say in a document in 18 '53, claude teague: obviously, the amount of 19 evidence accumulated to indict cigarette 20 smoking as a health hazard is overwhelming. 21 the evidence challenging such an indictment is 22 scant. 23 here's what they promised in this frank 24 statement at the beginning of the conspiracy, 25 when my client had been smoking for 13 years and was already in her 20s: we will put in 2 charge of this research activity -- this 3 supposed independent research activity -- a man 4 of unimpeachable integrity and national repute. 5 and the guy was on the payroll because it 6 was set up as an industry shield and a front. 7 and what do they say? let us face it, 8 we are interested in evidence which we believe 9 denies the allegation that cigarette smoking 10 causes disease. 11 and a promise is a promise. could 12 glodine mccoy rely on this? if our product is 13 proven to be harmful, we will stop making it. 14 and that was 11 examples of that from major 15 executives from the cooperation telling the 16 public, we would never make a bad product, 17 we will stop making it. 18 in this case, when you come to the clear 19 and convincing evidence standard that these 20 folks do -- do richly deserve your censure, 21 richly deserve for you to exact a penalty and 22 punish them and say in the strongest possible 23 terms, we do not want you to do this, you will 24 see there is no doubt about the doubt campaign, 25 okay? they said it themselves, a brilliantly 2 conceived holding -- holding strategy, creating 3 doubt. and they employed it on a single -- a 4 single strategy to defend itself on major 5 fronts: litigation, politics, and public 6 opinion. 7 and what dr. proctor says, that was the 8 whole point. they were making a product that 9 could cause harm, and they were worried that 10 this could bite them in court, and that that 11 was one of the essential pillars of the 12 conspiracy, the man who knows the most, who 13 dedicated years, decades to studying hundreds 14 of thousands of those internal documents. 15 and what do they say they would do when 16 they got information that could show nicotine 17 was addictive? they bury it. they did not 18 disclose the information. 19 i'm not going to play this. i'm not 20 going to play this. you saw this. 21 the chief executive officers of the major 22 tobacco companies standing up in front of 23 congress -- you have seen it twice -- and lying, 24 in 1980 -- 1994. and that is not corporate 25 conduct that is acceptable, it does not meet the bounds of human decency, and it costs lives. 2 lies cost lives. 3 they control the future. that is the lung 4 cancer and the -- and the product usage line. 5 the yellow one is cigarette smoking going up to 6 600 billion a year. the red one is the -- the 7 amount of lung cancer, because there was a 8 20-year lag time. they controlled the future. 9 how different would it have been if they 10 had come clean? what would have happened? how 11 would the future have been different? how 12 would those lines have changed? 13 how would there have been a plummeting of 14 lung cancer and diseases and death if they had 15 said, we are not going to make it inhalable, 16 we are going to lower the nicotine, we are going 17 to take out the sugars, we are not going to lie 18 to the public, we are going to give truth in 19 advertising, we are going to tell you it kills 20 you? 21 we live in the culture they created. and 22 this -- it is relevant today, it bears 23 continuing examination and scrutiny. 24 and the last slide. 25 and that is why we are here. the epitaph on the -- on the gravestone that he visits 2 every single week and makes sure that the 3 flowers are fresh, and to keep her memory 4 alive. 5 she is gone and not forgotten, and that 6 is why we are here and that is who we want you 7 to think about in this case. 8 where is the check mark for punies? did i 9 get everything? 10 mr. hammer: just go through -- 11 mr. schlesinger: this? 12 mr. hammer: show them that. 13 mr. schlesinger: so after we talked 14 about the money, which is -- 15 it is your decision. i make a 16 recommendation. i could have recommended an 17 amount that does not meet with what you want. 18 it is up to you. but, ultimately -- 19 because you remember mr. furr said, this 20 is only about glodine mccoy, not others, but 21 it is about harm to others. he said it is about 22 glodine mccoy. and every question is about 23 glodine mccoy. 24 this is the question about them. this is 25 why you saw this evidence. it is about them, and does this industry -- has it done indecent 2 things to the american public and glo mccoy. 3 and it says here: please state for each 4 defendant below, who you answered question -- 5 "yes" on questions 6 and 7 that -- that 6 reliance, the false statements, were a 7 contributing cause to her not being able to get 8 off those cigarettes, to fool her and reassure 9 her, whether you find by clear and convincing 10 evidence that punitive damages are warranted 11 against any of the defendants listed below. 12 and there is a check mark, "yes" or "no," 13 for each of the three defendants in here; and 14 we propose and submit that the right verdict 15 and the verdict that will be the most important 16 part of this case is to work your way through 17 this path to the punishment damages, and check 18 off "yes" for each of these -- each of these 19 defendants. and when you do -- 20 because you can take as long as you want 21 to, to deliberate this case. it could be a 22 day, tomorrow. we are going to be on your time. 23 it is very interesting, you guys wait for 24 us; we are going to turn this over and then 25 we are on your time. but if you say "yes" and we have a 2 punitive damages phase, there is a short phase, 3 a brief phase, it could take as little as a 4 day, and then we submit to you -- 5 mr. tepikian: objection, your honor. 6 the court: sustained. 7 mr. schlesinger: -- a single question -- 8 we submit to you a question as to what is 9 the amount of the penalty that you will exact 10 against the defendants who you found deserve 11 that penalty. 12 on behalf of my clients, on behalf of the 13 family, i thank you. 22 mr. schlesinger: can i have the easel, 23 judge? 24 can you put the engle finding up on the 25 board, danny, and we will get started? cannot do it? 2 mr. tepikian: there is lower ones, 3 danny. 4 mr. schlesinger: there you go. that is 5 why i did not do it because i would fall over it 6 like chevy chase, okay, in saturday night. 7 all right. may i start, judge? 8 the court: please. 9 mr. schlesinger: all right. thanks, 10 folks. 11 all right. so my time is short, and 12 this is rebuttal, last word. so you know, first 13 thing i want to touch base with you on is this -- 14 is the thing -- put that on too, okay? 15 video technician: it is on. 16 mr. schlesinger: is it on? where is 17 it? nothing. 18 video technician: nothing? 19 mr. schlesinger: right here: reynolds 20 and philip morris concealed or omitted material 21 information not otherwise known or available. 22 you cannot say that my client knows 23 something when the fraud count -- remember, they 24 have been found guilty of fraud and conspiracy in 25 the engle case. they cannot talk about those internal 2 documents. they cannot talk about what they did. 3 mr. tepikian: objection, your honor. 4 it is a misstatement. 5 the court: sustained. 6 mr. schlesinger: they did not talk 7 about the documents, and they are prohibited from 8 denying what is in the documents. 9 mr. tepikian: objection, your honor. 10 it is a misstatement. 11 the court: overruled. 12 mr. schlesinger: they are prohibited 13 from taking exception. what is not otherwise 14 known or available means my client could not 15 possibly know. neither could john. neither could 16 harry reasoner nor hammond because in the '60s 17 they internally knew -- 18 mr. furr: objection. 19 mr. schlesinger: -- moreover nicotine 20 is addictive. 21 mr. furr: i'm sorry. it is improper 22 argument. 23 the court: overruled. 24 mr. schlesinger: moreover, nicotine is 25 addictive. remember that is that internal battelle hippo document you will see? 2 they did not know it was addictive. they 3 did not know all the things that tobacco was 4 concealing. 5 so so many unwitting, duped public 6 health officials, newscasters were saying things, 7 but that secret of addiction they knew so well, 8 that they developed so well, that it was the sine 9 qua non, without which there is nothing, was 10 unknown to all those people. 11 so here is what you heard: personal 12 responsibility, personal responsibility, personal 13 responsibility, and choice. 14 you will not see that word on the 15 verdict form. you will not see that word in the 16 engle findings. 17 you will not see that word anywhere in 18 any of the jury instructions, but we say: yes, 19 obviously personal responsibility plays a role. 20 you have to decide whether a human being and their 21 personal weaknesses or their lack of diligence, 22 that could have been greater. she tried so many 23 times; she could have tried more. 24 you can consider that, but do you know 25 who else has responsibility? and i do not mean to yell. corporations. they have corporate 2 responsibility. 3 so if you have personal responsibility 4 for a person, a corporation has personal 5 responsibility to talk about what they did. 6 does the clicker work, danny? 7 video technician: yes. 8 mr. schlesinger: so now let me show you 9 something else. this is something i saved real 10 quick because i want you to know -- you have got to 11 blow it up, bro. 12 thanks. 13 okay. remember we talked about lung 14 cancer? there is a question on here you have to 15 touch on about: did the lung cancer cause her 16 death, and did it manifest before november 21, 17 '96? 18 that is the only manifestation question 19 you have, and, remember, they started saying: we 20 did not prove that pvd and heart disease was caused 21 by smoking. 22 they argued in the entire case that 23 heart disease and pvd were caused by smoking. now 24 they are saying that we did not prove it. 25 altschuler said, in no uncertain terms, it was caused. here's what really interesting. 2 add this to my pile of evidence. this is 3 dr. sridhar, the world's big -- the hot shot 4 pulmonary pathologist who was at the university of 5 miami. 6 mr. furr: objection. 7 the court: sustained. 8 mr. schlesinger: there is evidence that 9 sridhar was a well-known pulmonary pathologist. 10 there is testimony to that effect. a pulmonary 11 doctor -- sorry, a pulmonary oncologist, testimony 12 to that effect. 13 look right there. this is his record, 14 march 25th, 1997. diagnosis: microscopic 15 squamous cell cancer. history -- history of 16 present illness. 17 remember we asked in other records: how 18 do you do define that acronym, history of present 19 illness? the month, day, year. symptom onset: 20 october of 1996. pain in the left shoulder. saw 21 the chiropractor. saw an x-ray. it is abnormal. 22 went to dr. labi. 23 okay. that is an additional evidence. i 24 saved it. i wanted to see if anybody else would 25 bring it up or anything. i showed you the scales, and the fact of 2 the matter is that is a huge piece of evidence that 3 shows before 1996. that does not even say a month 4 before. that says october '96, history of present 5 illness, symptom of onset: october '96. 6 that is manifestation before november 7 21, '96, of the symptoms, of the lung cancer, 8 absolutely. 9 pvd, one hundred percent caused by cigarette 10 smoking. all the testimony swore to it. mannino 11 swore to it. altschuler swore to it. during 12 dr. prochaska's -- 13 mr. furr: excuse me. objection. may 14 we approach, your honor? 15 the court: yes. 16 mr. furr: take it down, please. 17 18 sidebar:) 19 the court: yes, sir. 20 mr. furr: they did not show us any of 21 these things. 22 the court: they did not show you the 23 slide? 24 mr. schlesinger: all it is is 25 testimony, that you said i could show the other person the testimony. 2 the court: excuse me. keep it down. 3 mr. schlesinger: first of all, the 4 medical record is a record in evidence. it is not 5 a special board. 6 second of all, this next slide is 7 sridhar's testimony when they misquoted that she 8 was not hooked. 9 this is the full quote from the page, 10 and all it is is direct out of the record. i 11 pulled it just now because you said i could show 12 it. 13 the court: and i said show it to them. 14 so if you have it, give it to them. 15 (the sidebar discussion was concluded 16 and the following was held in open court:) 17 the court: mr. schlesinger, counsel, 18 you may proceed. give them a copy of the slide, 19 please. 20 thank you. go ahead, sir. 21 mr. schlesinger: put it up. put it up. 22 okay. what did she say about, was 23 the -- she said in other testimony: by the time 24 you smoke a pack a day, you are hooked. 25 the surgeon general's report chapter on nicotine addiction, page 105, it is all about 2 nicotine addiction. that is all this is about. 3 and she said: is not it true the 4 earliest you can state that mrs. mccoy was, in 5 your opinion, addicted to the nicotine in the 6 early '60s? 7 when i say "hooked," i mean you are 8 caught on that hook, on that fisher, on that line, 9 and you are being reeled in by the tobacco industry 10 over time. can i say she was addicted by that 11 time? no, i cannot say for certainty, but she is 12 got -- they have got that hook into her, and she is 13 pulled toward and she is tried -- she is doing 14 different brands and she is trying different 15 things, and she continues to maintain that use of 16 nicotine in cigarettes, parliament, philip morris 17 brand, kent, reynolds' brand, camel. kent was 18 lorillard, now reynolds. camel. we gave you 19 tobacco addiction. 20 they did not address that, did they? an 21 independent doctor who testified to -- who put a 22 medical record back in the late '80s that said 23 tobacco addiction. 24 dr. agharkar, here's an interesting 25 question, he was asked straight-up by mr. furr: what do you work on, dr. agharkar? 2 and he says: alcohol, marijuana, 3 cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine. those are broad 4 classes, but i think that covers them. 5 and then mr. furr had to remind him: 6 and nicotine, because on his own, he did not know 7 he had anything to do with the nicotine because he 8 does not have anything to do with because he 9 does not have any qualifications in nicotine. 10 and they are quoting to prochaska for 11 you? we brought you a world-class expert. she 12 testified that our poor gal was terribly addicted, 13 and she emphasized that repeatedly. 14 same thing with dr. klein who -- 15 mr. tepikian: objection, your honor. 16 we do not have this. we do not it -- i do not 17 believe we have any of these slides. 18 mr. schlesinger: these are just -- this 19 is testimony from the record that you have that 20 we are just responding to. all this is is 21 testimony. 22 can i just rip through it real quick, 23 judge? 24 the court: yes, sir. go ahead. 25 mr. schlesinger: thank you. anyway, so dr. klein agreed she died of 2 lung cancer, smoking cigarettes caused the lung 3 cancer, and smoking cigarettes caused the death 4 and but for the -- but for the lung cancer, she 5 would not have died. lung cancer does not develop 6 overnight. 7 dr. sridhar, a world class guy, he is the 8 one that said october '96 was the onset of the 9 symptoms. that is in the record. 10 there is a lengthy record when she was on 11 death's door, and they confirmed that her onset of 12 cancer symptoms began in october in the class 13 period. 14 our lung cancer evidence is filled up 15 now with that excerpt of march 25th, '97, history 16 of onset. you never saw that before. 17 now this is the website where they asked 18 about: if you do not smoke, you should not start. 19 kids should not smoke, and everyone who smokes 20 should quit. 21 and it begs the question, what business 22 are they in? if they are sincere, what kind of 23 business is that to be in? 24 this is the ads from glamour magazine 25 today. remember dr. prochaska said they are still not disclosing their funding interest when they 2 come to the nicotine conferences on nicotine? 3 these are the ads today. american 4 spirit, one hundred percent additive-free. i mean look 5 how glamorous these ads are. 6 is not that a health reassurance message? 7 it is one hundred percent tobacco, organic tobacco. that is 8 in recent magazines with young people on the 9 cover. inspiration, where a moment becomes a 10 memory. discover the unexpected. this is in 11 evidence. taste it all. moments, imagination, 12 discovery. 13 yeah, there is a warning down there, but 14 look what the major -- the major demonstration is. 15 what did not glo know? these are the 16 things that she did not know. she did not know any 17 of these things. that is the concealment. 18 was it a cause? did the filter fraud 19 contribute? did the lights fraud contribute? was 20 it something that was operation stumbling block 21 and undermines the smoker? of course it was. of 22 course it was. so you can consider all of those 23 things. 24 similarly, on page 871, these are not 25 inherently dangerous products. cigarettes are not natural growing from trees. they are defective by 2 design. 3 it has been stated that a cigarette is 4 also a defective product, meaning not just 5 dangerous but unreasonably dangerous, killing over 6 half of its long-time users and addictive by 7 design, page 871. 8 and that is one of the findings of the 9 engle findings that had to be proved, and they say 10 that cigarettes cannot be made safe. sure, they 11 can. take out the sugar. take out the 12 inhalability. lower the ph. go back to mouth 13 puffing. 14 no one is supposed to be sucking smoke 15 deep into their lungs. that is unnatural. if 16 ancient man around the campfire leans over and 17 sucks in smoke from a campfire, what is he going to 18 do? 19 he is going to choke and cough. the body 20 is going to respond to it. you are not supposed to 21 engineer cigarettes to inhale them in the lungs to 22 deliver a drug. 23 and what does it say on little page 3 on 24 sg '10 in evidence? it says: the way tobacco is 25 grown, mixed, processed today has made cigarettes more addictive than ever before. 2 and i read to you from surgeon general 3 '14: more addictive than ever before, more 4 dangerous than ever before because of the relative 5 risk, and -- 6 mr. tepikian: your honor, is there -- 7 is this the time? 8 the court: thank you, counsel. 9 mr. schlesinger, you have got two minutes. 10 mr. schlesinger: okay. thank you. 11 i'll tell you something else. they 12 showed you these warnings, and we have got packs of 13 cigarettes, and our pack of cigarettes -- i need a 14 pack. 15 the warnings are not quite this big. 16 okay. and they are the warnings they want to show 17 you every single time. 18 now think about the logic of this. if 19 that defense is correct, if that defense is 20 correct, every single smoker who would ever claim 21 to be an engle class member would always have to 22 contend with: but there were warnings on the 23 pack. 24 every single smoker who got sick or who 25 was in a family would have to contend with the arguments that family members have said: stop 2 smoking. 3 it is the -- it is the definition of 4 addiction that drives this. it is smoking despite 5 knowing it is bad for you that contributes to this. 6 i'll tell you what, if every time 7 somebody went and bought a pack of cigarettes, 8 when you bought the cigarettes, if it came with 9 this warning this big and this is what you had to 10 leave the 7-eleven with, that might start making a 11 different impression if this is the kind of 12 thing -- 13 mr. tepikian: objection, your honor. 14 mr. schlesinger: -- they handed out 15 every single time. 16 mr. tepikian: preemption. 17 the court: overruled. 18 mr. schlesinger: but instead, you get a 19 pack of cigarettes that, in camel, they so 20 cleverly advertise it with the cellophane on it, 21 and the very light gray, depending on the -- 22 mr. furr: objection, your honor. 23 mr. schlesinger: -- on the -- on the 24 light reflection -- 25 the court: excuse me, counsel. 1 mr. furr: preemption. 2 the court: sustained. 3 let us go, counsel. you need to wrap it 4 up. 5 mr. schlesinger: all right. yes, sir. 6 okay. and that is what i'll do. 7 this is the last two things i want to 8 show you. these are internal documents in 9 evidence where it said: our medical and 10 scientific witnesses will say whatever we want 11 them to say, clearly implying, if not stating, 12 that they lacked credibility and integrity. 13 this is from their secret files from 14 1982: our medical and scientific witnesses will 15 say whatever we want them to say clearly implying, 16 if not stating, that they lacked credibility and 17 integrity. 18 and here's another one: lest some 19 lawyer be looking over our shoulder, i do not 20 concede that even one person dies of a chronic 21 disease that is caused by cigarette smoking. 22 you know what they all said. i'm not 23 going to play it again, but those men as late as 24 1994 were still lying to congress and denying the 25 harms and denying nicotine was addictive. and dr. -- 2 mr. furr: objection, your honor. 3 time. 4 the court: counsel, you need to wrap it 5 up. 6 mr. schlesinger: i'm out of time, 7 folks. you all have been super attentive. i 8 appreciate it. i hope that we stitched this the 9 way -- stitched this together in a way that you 10 can understand it. 11 the last thing, i hope we have stitched it 12 together for you in a way that you can understand 13 it, that you can see things as they are. 14 i said that to you in opening, is 15 wide-eyed and seeing things as they are, 16 understanding the world we are in. 17 we did ask for an amount of money. i 18 said it is up to you to make that discretion, but 19 here's one thing you did not hear: how much money 20 for compensation for the loss of a beautiful wife 21 and a 50-year marriage, how much money did any of 22 the defendants recommend to you would be fair? 23 did they suggest an amount? did they say what 24 they think would be fair? 25 mr. tepikian: objection, your honor. 1 the court: sustained. 2 mr. schlesinger: they did not. 3 the court: counsel, you need to wrap it 4 up. 5 mr. schlesinger: i'm done. thank you. 6 mr. tepikian: your honor, can we 7 approach briefly? 8 9 sidebar:) 10 the court: thank you. yes. 11 mr. tepikian: your honor, we would ask 12 that this instruction, we would ask it be read 13 based upon the closing, the rebuttal 14 mr. schlesinger just gave. he talked about how 15 large -- 16 the court: we need to excuse one juror 17 though. okay? 18 you want to be heard? 19 mr. schlesinger: i absolutely do. 20 judge, i cut out about 15 slides that were in 21 evidence from dr. proctor, testimony in evidence 22 because they said be careful. 23 i asked for clarification. i did not say 24 a word about warnings on the front end, but 25 mr. furr went into it extensively, and i did not say there was anything wrong with the language. 2 all i talked about was the 3 noticeability, the size and the noticeability. 4 ftc says people do not notice them. he said they 5 ignore them. 6 i did not say the language was not good 7 enough. i did not tread on any of that. i said 8 virtually nothing -- 9 the court: what you said was about the 10 size of it, and i thought the warnings are 11 regulated as to the size. 12 mr. schlesinger: i'm sorry, judge. 13 regardless of the size, the size of the board they 14 used -- 15 the court: let us go. thank you. 16 (the sidebar discussion was concluded 17 and the following was held in open court:)
