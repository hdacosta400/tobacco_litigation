2 mr. patacca: -- counsel, and members of the 3 jury. 4 let me start with thanking each and every one 5 of you for giving us three weeks. without all of 6 the time and the attention that you have given us out 7 of your lives, none of us in this room could be at 8 this point here today. 9 we need the jury system. we need jurors who 10 are judges of the facts to consider important 11 matters between the parties. let me just say on 12 behalf of everyone in this courtroom, this is a very 13 important case for both sides. we know you have 14 paid extremely close attention. we have noticed. 15 you have been very prompt every day. you have stayed 16 without any complaints. and we do thank you for 17 that. 18 and i'd like to ask you to give us a little 19 indulgence this morning as we finish with our 20 closing arguments so that we can give you an idea of 21 what we think came into evidence, how you should 22 view the evidence and render a verdict in this case, 23 and then the case will be yours this afternoon. 24 so, again, thank you on behalf of the plaintiff 25 and my partners, evan yegelwel and bruce anderson, 1 but also our assistant, ms. white, who you have seen 2 in here this morning, mr. keller and ms. chaney, 3 who is also helping me, because no one could get this 4 case here without that help, so i thank them. 5 and i know lorillard equally thanks you for 6 being here, and i'll let mr. molony address that. 7 but on behalf of all of us here in the court system, 8 we do really appreciate your service. 9 so let me wrap up and get going this morning, 10 if you do not mind. 11 we kind of started this case unofficially in 12 voir dire when we were picking jurors in this case, 13 but mr. anderson kicked it off for us officially -- 14 i think it was on valentine's day. perhaps you 15 might have been here on the 14th. 16 and we submitted to you we thought the evidence 17 was going to show that in this case between these 18 parties what was going to be important is for you to 19 ask three questions throughout the case: what did 20 they know, when did they know it, and what did they 21 do with what they knew? 22 and mr. anderson did not just say this would be 23 important for just what lorillard knew and when and 24 what did they do, but with jackie miller, too. 25 those three questions, i would submit, could 1 guide you as you considered all the evidence in the 2 past two weeks and will hopefully guide you in the 3 closing argument when you evaluate the parties here. 4 as mr. anderson told you, also, what we would 5 like to have you consider and what we thought would 6 be appropriate throughout all the evidence in this 7 case is to compare and measure. compare what jackie 8 miller knew with what lorillard knew. compare when 9 jackie miller knew what she learned with what 10 lorillard knew and when they knew it. compare what 11 jackie miller did with the information when she 12 learned it with what lorillard did with the 13 information when they learned it. 14 from the very beginning of this case, and 15 unofficially even when we were talking in voir dire, 16 you remember a lot of the questions we even got to 17 every juror is not withstanding whatever you have done 18 in your personal life, your experiences, your 19 viewpoints, can you set aside all of that, listen to 20 only the evidence that came in through the stand or 21 videos and the instructions that judge soud will be 22 reading you at the end, the law that you must 23 follow? can you set that aside and compare 24 individual responsibility with corporate 25 responsibility? 1 and if i recall, i believe we had that 2 conversation with almost everybody who is on this 3 jury here and certainly scores of others who were on 4 the prospective jury. that was one of the most 5 important parts, because we needed jurors to come in 6 with the scales balanced; nobody had a step ahead 7 and nobody was behind. 8 and every juror -- 150 people were summoned in 9 courtroom a -- all raised their hand -- now, we 10 did not talk to maybe the last 30, but everybody 11 raised their hand under oath and said, i can do 12 that. i can evaluate this case fairly. 13 and when we talked about who could really put 14 aside previous notions, we got to nine, nine people 15 who swore under oath to judge arnold, a circuit 16 court judge in the state of florida here in duval 17 county, and brought that with them to judge soud and 18 said, i will set aside any personal beliefs i have 19 about smokers, about smoking, about companies, about 20 the issues. i promise i will not listen to the radio 21 on tobacco, i will not read newspaper accounts. i'm 22 going to put that all aside, and i swear under oath, 23 just like every witness who came into this court 24 with a hand on the bible, i swear or affirm that i 25 can do that. 1 and that is why, from 150 people who were 2 summoned over basically a month ago, we have nine. 3 all of you indicated you could put that aside and 4 measure and compare jackie's fault and consider it 5 with lorillard tobacco's fault, compare 6 responsibilities. 7 you know, we came into court from the very 8 beginning, and again back in voir dire when we were 9 asking the questions, and said, guess what? you will 10 never hear us say that jackie miller was not 11 partially at fault. she was. right out of the 12 gate, right up front. she was partially at fault. 13 because at some point she probably knew that smoking 14 became dangerous. at some point, even though she 15 was addicted and had a disease that undermined her 16 ability to quit, at some point she should have tried 17 harder. 18 and i'll talk to you a little bit more about 19 that this morning, and i would submit that that was 20 probably in the '80s, as you heard testimony about 21 friends who were quitting around that time, family 22 members. the defense wanted you to believe -- to 23 hear everything that everybody else knew and impute 24 it to her. 25 well, at some point the message probably got 1 through, but it had to get through the disease. but 2 nonetheless, mr. anderson told you you will not hear 3 us say that jackie miller was not partially at fault 4 for her injuries. 5 what did not you hear? you never heard 6 lorillard say, well, we are partially at fault, too, 7 and let us just compare and measure. with lorillard 8 it has been either/or. she was at fault, not us. 9 i expect you are going to hear this morning 10 enjoyment. it is either enjoyment or addiction. 11 either she was at fault or nobody was at fault. 12 we told you up front we are partially at fault, 13 we accept that responsibility, and we would ask you 14 to use the oath that you gave us to say, i will 15 fairly judge this case on the evidence and compare 16 and measure the fault of both of them. 17 ms. chaney, can you put up p number 2? 18 i expect his honor is going to instruct you as 19 to the findings as he did initially early on. there 20 are certain findings that in this courtroom are 21 binding on all of us; his honor, the parties, and, 22 yes, the nine members of the jury who swore to 23 follow the law. this is the law. 24 one of the findings that everyone is bound by 25 is that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer, small 1 cell carcinoma, the very cancer that jackie miller 2 got and died from in 1994. no dispute. no one's 3 allowed to dispute it. that is the law. 4 if someone were to dispute it, it would be no 5 different than driving down bay street in front of 6 the courthouse and running the red light. jso would 7 have pulled them over. so if anybody would ever 8 suggest, and they will not, that you could ignore 9 that finding, that would be running the red light. 10 that would be ignoring the law. it would be 11 ignoring the oath, your duty. 12 p number 3, please. 13 that nicotine in cigarettes is addictive. no 14 question. the finding was made. the judge is 15 bound, we are bound, lorillard is bound, and you are 16 bound. and, really, there was no question, as we will 17 talk about the testimony you heard. 18 p number 4. 19 lorillard was found negligent. i expect his 20 honor is going to discuss with you what negligence 21 means, but negligence is the failure to use 22 reasonable care. but lorillard was negligent. the 23 judge is bound by that, we are bound by that, 24 lorillard is bound by that, and you, the nine 25 members of our jury, under your oath, will be bound 1 by that, and we know you will. 2 and that is why we say, as you go forward, you 3 need to measure their fault with jackie's fault. 4 compare and measure what did they know, when did 5 they know it, what did they do with what they knew, 6 and compare it to her with those very same three 7 questions. 8 p5, please. 9 lorillard placed cigarettes on the market that 10 were defective and unreasonably dangerous. their 11 cigarettes were defective and they were unreasonably 12 dangerous. everyone in this courtroom is bound by 13 that. jackie miller smoked lorillard tobacco 14 cigarettes that were defective and unreasonably 15 dangerous. and you cannot run the red light and 16 ignore that fact. 17 p number 6. 18 lorillard concealed or omitted material 19 information that otherwise -- not otherwise known or 20 available, knowing that the material was false or 21 misleading or failed to disclose a material fact 22 concerning the health effects or addictive nature of 23 smoking cigarettes or both. 24 there cannot be any dispute. members of the 25 jury, expect when his honor reads you the law in 1 this case -- eventually you will have a copy of 2 this, so you will see these very findings typed down 3 for you. and i know you -- because you have all been 4 excellent about taking notes. keep doing so, but i 5 want you to know you will have these when you go 6 back to the jury room. 7 they concealed and omitted material 8 information. and his honor is going to instruct you 9 as to what material means, but i would submit 10 material information is information a person would 11 want to know so that they can take precautions, so 12 they can protect themselves; important information, 13 material information. 14 jurors understand material because we all bring 15 into this courtroom common sense. we all deal with 16 material information. if you want to buy a house, 17 some things are material and some are not. in that 18 context, you know what is important to you in making 19 a decision to buy a house. 20 when a person buys a product, they know in the 21 context or hope to know what might be important to 22 them. and where we get into trouble is when you 23 have no idea what is in the product and they conceal 24 it and omit it, when they knew it. material. 25 not otherwise known. what did they know? when 1 did they know it? what did they do with the 2 information? you heard a lot of testimony from 3 dr. robinson, you may recall, the corporate 4 representative, and i'll talk more about him. but 5 can it be seriously argued in this courtroom in 6 2011, even knowing what people know in 2011, that 7 jackie miller had the same information available to 8 her that all the scientists in greensboro, north 9 carolina, at lorillard knew? 10 can it honestly be debated that she was aware 11 of all the information that they had in that private 12 library, the library that they did not even share 13 with one of their witnesses they brought to you 14 yesterday? 15 she did not know. she could not have known. 16 we will talk a little bit more about that this 17 morning. 18 p number 7, please. 19 lorillard agreed to conceal or omit the 20 information regarding the health effects of 21 cigarettes or their addictive nature with the 22 intention that smokers and the public would rely on 23 the information to their detriment. 24 no running red lights. the court, the parties 25 and this jury is bound by that. lorillard was found 1 to have agreed with others to conceal and omit the 2 information about the dangers or the health effects 3 of cigarettes and the addictive nature of the 4 cigarettes with the intention -- intent that people 5 rely. 6 and i would submit as i talk to you this 7 morning that is exactly what happened. what happened 8 was what they intended to happen. withhold, omit, 9 people will buy. people will rely. 10 interesting we had at the beginning of this 11 case opening statements by mr. anderson and 12 mr. molony. and -- i'm okay with the lights. thank 13 you. 14 mr. molony -- and you go by your memory. this, 15 again, just the attorneys telling you what they 16 thought you would hear in the evidence. but he made 17 the statement in front of this jury in this 18 courtroom, and he warned you. he said, you are 19 going to hear things from documents and things we 20 said over the decades that we would never say today, 21 things that we would never say today. 22 he called them wrong-headed. he called them 23 absurd. he suggested they were out of context. but 24 i would submit, as we talked earlier this morning, 25 that right there by lorillard is an admission that, 1 what we did over the past 50 years was wrong. 2 you would never do that today. it is 3 reprehensible. it is negligent. it disregards the 4 safety of others. it is consciously indifferent. it 5 shows a lack of care. never do it. 6 and then he mentioned, and i'm sure you heard 7 it, but i'm not apologizing for it, that is why we are 8 here today. in 2011, 65 years after the 1954 frank 9 statement, their declaration of independence, if you 10 will, where the tobacco companies signed on and 11 said, we stand together or we will surely fall apart, 12 that started what we believe and ask you to consider 13 is a conspiracy in the industry to omit and conceal. 14 back in december of 1953, you heard from 15 dr. robinson, it was christmas, the holidays. it 16 was a time when most people are putting business 17 aside, the holidays, the end of the year. you 18 gather family, you give thanks for a great year, you 19 come together and you relax. 20 what you have heard was that lorillard and the 21 other tobacco companies from which it agreed, they 22 gathered in new york at the plaza hotel during the 23 christmas holidays. they gathered because there was 24 a cancer scare. 25 and i'm not talking about the cancer scare 1 where the mice studies were being given out to the 2 public. surely that was going on. the cancer scare 3 was that the information was going to the public and 4 they were concerned that the people were going to 5 stop smoking; people were going to stop buying their 6 cigarettes; people would stop handing over their 7 money to get a cigarette and continue to smoke it. 8 that was the scare that was going on in 1953. 9 instead of going home with their families and 10 thanking themselves for what a great year it is been 11 like every other american does during the holidays, 12 they gathered together their top executives and 13 their pr company, not one scientist, and said, what 14 are we going to do about it? and they signed the 15 frank statement. 16 we are going to issue a statement to america in 17 over 400 newspapers that will be widely circulated 18 over tens and hundreds of thousands and tell the 19 american public, we are interested in your health. 20 we are not aware of anything in anything in our 21 cigarettes that is harmful. and if we find it, we 22 will remove it. and we will set forth research to 23 make sure we know what is in the cigarettes. 24 they took on that duty. they declared that to 25 the american public. they signed the document 1 together. that is what they did. 2 and i'll talk to you in a minute about 3 dr. burns, how he views what they did over the past 4 50 years. things you would never do today. things 5 you would never say today. things that are 6 reprehensible when you are talking about, as 7 dr. roberts, their historian, the greatest health 8 issue of the twentieth century. 9 when they signed that document and published it 10 in the paper and said, we do not know of anything in 11 our cigarettes that is harmful, you learned in these 12 past two weeks that was not true. they have always 13 known. there was scientific literature already 14 associating with lung cancer, with death and cancer. 15 they knew about the nicotine properties even back 16 then. they knew that people compensated when they 17 switched types of cigarettes. some people would 18 smoke more to get more nicotine and tar. 19 they knew that and yet represented to the 20 american public, we are not aware, but if we are or 21 if we become aware, we are going to fix it. that was 22 their frank statement. and two weeks ago you heard 23 their next frank statement: we would never say it, 24 but i'm not apologizing for it. cannot get more 25 frank than that. 1 so over the past 50 and 60 years, what have 2 they done? lorillard has marketed cigarettes, 3 marketed it to the public, marketed it to consumers. 4 they have spent millions, and in fact you heard from 5 ms. leung over a billion dollars in the history of 6 lorillard marketing these doses of nicotine. 7 now, you could not devise a better marketing 8 plan than lorillard had. i mean, they really -- as 9 you have seen it, they epitomize how you get a 10 consumer to take the product, how do you get them 11 hooked, and how do you keep them on the products. 12 it was masterful. 13 i think you heard in some of the testimony that 14 was going on with dr. robinson -- you may recall 15 dr. robinson's powerpoint 8. 16 we do not need the lights off. 17 you will remember he was the first witness you 18 heard from. he was their corporate representative. 19 we told you we were going to bring witnesses. we 20 made him sit down under oath, their representative, 21 and tell us about research and development over the 22 years. and a jury in north florida heard that 23 testimony in this courtroom. 24 you heard from him and the other corporate 25 representative, kristy leung. 1 number 14, please. 2 she was their marketing person who we made, 3 under oath, sit down and speak to a jury about the 4 marketing over the past 50 years. 5 and what you heard was, how did lorillard go 6 from just being a small company back in the 1700s to 7 enter into the modern era of mass-produced 8 cigarettes? and you may recall some of the ads that 9 were played and discussed with ms. leung. 10 thank you. 11 they were on billboards. they were on the 12 radio. they had women dress up like a cigarette 13 pack with long legs and dance across a stage. they 14 had placards in stores. they had stickers in 15 windows. they even had planes flying over 16 neighborhoods with loudspeakers, you may recall, 17 talking about their product. 18 no detail was too small. no method was 19 insignificant. if you were a human being in the 20 united states in the '40s, '50s and beyond, you 21 heard tobacco messages. that is what the evidence 22 has shown. and lorillard knew exactly how to do 23 that. 24 when the '50s came around and this new device 25 called the television showed up, they knew, we have 1 got to get on that, too. and they started 2 sponsoring tv perhaps. dick van dyke, for instance, 3 the web that you have heard about. commercials. 4 they were in your face 24/7, although back then 5 tv was not even on 24/7. there were about three main 6 channels. tv went off the air at the end of the 7 day. it was on for a brief part of the day, not 8 like today where you can find any channel anytime or 9 you can go to an internet. there was none of that. 10 people either sat next to a radio or they looked at 11 the tv for those limited hours and they were 12 captive, and if a commercial came on, they had your 13 attention. 14 on the radio they had frank sinatra. you heard 15 about him, too. they actually had frank sinatra 16 selling some of their -- some of their cigarettes. 17 they used w.c. fields. you saw his picture. he was 18 very famous in his day. eddie cantor. they used 19 athletes. they used caricatures of people that 20 we will show you, youthful people. 21 they even decided and determined after the 22 cancer scare steered them to the plaza hotel in 23 1953, we need to take advantage and exploit this 24 health scare. we must assure our smokers. we are 25 going to assure them that it is all right to smoke. 1 we are going to assure them, just like the frank 2 statement, we are here to protect you. we are going 3 to give them reassurance to keep lighting up and 4 keep buying them. 5 kent cigarette, the greatest health protection 6 in cigarette history. if you had heard those words 7 from an attorney standing before you three weeks 8 ago, you would say, that guy is making up something 9 that we would never say today. and, yet, they 10 boldly put it on tv. they boldly put it in print. 11 they claimed the micronite filter, which was from 12 atomic energy plants, hospital rooms, the purest 13 filter, outlasted its competition. they had the 14 gall to say it was the greatest health protection in 15 cigarette history. because they knew people were 16 starting to become health-conscious about cigarette 17 smoking. 18 and mr. anderson kind of talked with you about 19 that in opening. it is absurd in 2011 to talk about 20 a health-conscious smoker, but that is what was going 21 on in the '50s, and you-all saw that. that is what 22 was going on in the '60s and into the '70s. 23 we went from a nation that smoked almost 24 entirely filterless cigarettes in the '40s to the 25 '50s they started making filters, including the 1 micronite filter, the greatest health protection in 2 cigarette history. 3 and later, as we are going to talk about, you 4 heard lorillard even devised a system, well, if we 5 make a cigarette longer, we can tell those 6 health-conscious smokers, you will smoke less because 7 they take longer, the max cigarette. 8 they knew how to exploit. and kristy leung, 9 their corporate representative, had -- well, she did 10 what she could. she really sat here and tried to 11 debate whether or not they advertised their 12 cigarette as being a health cigarette or safe 13 cigarette. so we had to bring you evidence. 14 ms. chaney, number 165, please. 15 the documents i'm putting up will be in 16 evidence. and if you could -- this was in 1964, 17 much later than even the '50s scare, so we 18 continued -- kent had been out since the early '50s. 19 september 15th, 1964, mr. yellen and 20 mr. cramer, the president and chief executive 21 officer of lorillard. and he is saying, you want to 22 know from me, how did we get here? what are we 23 doing here? where are we going from here? what did 24 we know? when did we know it? what are we going to 25 do about it? three questions. 1 lauren, would you highlight the lower 2 paragraph? 3 let me start with kent. 4 as all of us are aware -- this is internally -- 5 we will market the kent as a safer cigarette for the 6 smoker who is concerned about smoking and health. 7 and in 1956, when an innocent third party, 8 reader's digest, published or created an awareness 9 to the consumer that kent was the, quote, safest, 10 unquote, of all popular filter cigarettes -- let me 11 stop there. reader's digest you heard a little bit 12 about. they come out with a study, their study, 13 saying this is the safest cigarette. 14 and what does lorillard do with it? they 15 exploited the advantage. lorillard exploited this 16 advantage so that within a short period of two years 17 the kent volume grew from less than four billion 18 cigarettes to 38 billion annually, even though they 19 knew that kent cigarettes provided absolutely no 20 better protection than any other filtered cigarette, 21 even though they knew that filtered cigarettes, 22 period, provided no better protection than 23 non-filtered. 24 ms. leung tried to explain to you how, we have 25 always been a responsible marketer. but what she 1 did not want to admit was a document that came from 2 the ftc. 3 i believe it is number 184, ms. chaney. 4 i'm sorry. wrong one. 733. 5 all right. in 1955, the federal trade 6 commission wrote to lorillard. 7 let us go to the second page, please. 8 and can you blow that up? 9 and they were concerned that lorillard was 10 making health claims with their cigarettes. this 11 was in '55. basically saying, the smoke of kent 12 cigarettes does not contain significantly less 13 nicotine or tar than smoke from other filter-tip 14 cigarettes, and insofar as the claim, quote, 15 unquote, "cleans the smoke" is concerned, contains 16 substantial quantities of both nicotine and tars. 17 they are telling them, despite your great 18 filter, despite your claims, it is not reducing it. 19 this named test results indicate that the smoke 20 from kent cigarettes does not contain significantly 21 less nicotine than any other popular brand or 22 non-filter. they conclude, we question the 23 propriety of the themes that were referenced. 24 thank you, lauren. 25 the reason i brought that up is that, again, in 1 1964, the document we just saw where they are now 2 going to exploit it, they are going to get back to 3 the health claims, even though they were told in '55 4 by the ftc, you do not have any basis to say it. 5 why were they doing it in 1964? the surgeon 6 general came out. the next scare was coming out. 7 people were going to be hearing that cigarette may 8 be hazardous to your health. 9 so what did they do? you heard the testimony. 10 they started giving kent cigarettes out in those 11 four-pack samples that kristy leung told you about. 12 in december before the surgeon general, december of 13 '93 [sic], put out the samples. it is going 14 amazingly well. the people want them. 15 they are anticipating the public health 16 officials who are going to say smoking is hazardous 17 or may be hazardous, and now they are going to 18 exploit. let us go back to our roots. 19 kent cigarettes, the greatest health protection in 20 cigarettes. let us talk to people about filters. 21 and you saw in the '64 document sales skyrocketed in 22 two years, four billion to 38 billion. 23 so, as i was saying, the marketing by lorillard 24 was fantastic and impressive. and it can hardly be 25 argued that not any american was affected during the 1 '50s and the '40s and even into the '60s and beyond 2 by tobacco advertising and information. the people 3 they agreed with to get together, hang together or 4 hang separately, get together and omit important 5 information, create doubt and controversy. 6 what did the ftc say about all the advertising 7 that had been going on? 8 now 184, please. 9 this is in 1967. this is after the surgeon 10 general's report comes out in '64. it is now after 11 '66. the law changed. we now have to put the 12 warning. they have to put the "may cause" language 13 on the packets. 14 let us go to the next, page, lauren, that is 15 highlighted, and highlight it, please. 16 and you saw this in the courtroom. you will have 17 this in evidence. but this was basically a 18 recitation of what had been going on over the past 19 20, 30 years. and it spoke volumes. 20 cigarette advertising reaches virtually all 21 americans who can either read or understand the 22 spoken word. pretty big group. 23 cigarettes are advertised on the network in 24 spot television, on the radio, in magazines and 25 newspapers, in outdoor media, and by means of many 1 types of point of sale advertising aids. so 2 pervasive is cigarette advertising that it is 3 virtually impossible for americans of almost any age 4 to avoid cigarette advertising. 5 and they go on and talk about exactly where you 6 see it. and there cannot be any doubt or dispute in 7 this courtroom that lorillard knew it was out in the 8 public. frankly, kristy leung did not want to admit 9 it, but at times like this when they will not tell you 10 what you need to hear, i think it is important -- 11 let us take a look at what they are saying when 12 patting themselves on the back, when they are 13 bragging. 14 and so what we have done is given you the annual 15 reports for each of the years in the '50s and '60s, 16 when they are patting themselves on their backs to 17 their shareholders and saying, here's what we are 18 doing for you, shareholder. here's how we are being 19 good stewards of your money, how we are growing 20 sales, and here's how we are doing it. 21 you will have those annual reports in evidence, 22 but i'd like to at least give you a little sample. 23 p-8, please. 24 i'm sorry. number 8, i'm sorry. not p-8, 25 number 8. 1 here we are in the 1952 report, before the 2 scare really comes out, but they are starting to make 3 the kent cigarette. let us go to our advertising 4 page. 5 amazing what someone will tell you when it is 6 time to brag. is not that really human nature? 7 is not that common sense? when you are not worried 8 about what you are saying on a video screen in front 9 of a jury and watching every single word and trying 10 to deny that the kids are seeing your ads or that 11 your ads are effective, when you are patting yourself 12 on the back, telling the people you work for, your 13 shareholders, you say amazing things, things that 14 you would never say today. and kristy leung proved 15 it. she would not say it today. they are not 16 apologizing. 17 so let us see. 18 probably no consumer product is more sensitive 19 to advertising than cigarettes; none. according to 20 them, no consumer product. they are asked for by 21 specific brand names millions of times a day at the 22 counters of 1.3 million retailers who hand over the 23 smoker's choice. brand loyalty is principally 24 established by the force of advertising. 25 there was no one more brand-loyal for almost 1 30 years than jackie miller. you could not hear from 2 jackie miller in this courtroom, but you heard 3 people who knew her and you heard what actions she 4 took. and there can be really no question that 5 jackie miller heard messages by the things she did 6 and said. 7 she maintained brand loyalty, and i'll talk a 8 little more about that, but she switched from 9 filterless to filter when the health scare came out 10 and they started using that to their advantage, when 11 they started exploiting things, and never went back 12 to filterless. 13 she makes a comment to her sister in the late 14 '60s that is essentially parroting some of the 15 themes that the greatest health cigarette is ever 16 promoting, that these are better for you. 17 how would she know that unless that is what she 18 saw? 19 she makes comments later about the max 20 cigarette, that, these are longer, they are -- it 21 takes me longer to smoke them. 22 is not it interesting that jackie miller just 23 happened to switch from filterless, those 24 chesterfields and old golds which were filterless, 25 and you will see that stipulation, to filtered. and 1 the filter brand she goes to is kent, the one that 2 is the most touted in america. how does that just 3 happen? 4 no consumer product is more susceptible to 5 advertising than cigarettes. that is how it happens. 6 you talk about the greatest health protection 7 in cigarette history, and is it any shock to you 8 that some people will actually be a health-conscious 9 smoker, as that term would be used in the '50s, and 10 go to your product? that is what you intended; 11 that is what happened. 12 is it just coincidence that jackie miller, when 13 she switched away from kent, decided, i'm going to 14 go to a women's brand, max cigarettes that they 15 created? it was targeted to women. it was longer 16 so you would smoke less. 17 is it any coincidence that when she smoked and 18 switched to max that she went to a women's brand? 19 how do you know it is a women's brands unless you have 20 seen the ads that it is being promoted to women? 21 that is what they intended to happen. that is 22 what did happen. again, you cannot hear from jackie 23 miller to tell you why she did what she did, but you 24 can infer. you can take reasonable inferences from 25 the evidence you have heard and the actions she did to 3958 1 say, yes, jackie miller must have been impacted by 2 their specific advertising and of their group, the 3 whole agreement of all advertising. she was a 4 health-conscious smoker as that term was used back 5 then. she switched to filters. 6 later she switched to the longer cigarettes. 7 she told her sister, this one is better for you. 8 she is parroting the very language that they are 9 selling to the public. 10 and most importantly, when her sister 11 confronted her -- you may recall in the end of the 12 '60s, carol gibson, who talked to you, said, i think 13 our dad died about seven years ago, six or seven 14 years ago, from lung cancer from smoking. and what 15 did jackie tell her? you heard her. i do not 16 believe that. 17 she said, but the warnings are on the pack. 18 she said, i do not believe that. i do not think 19 that is been proven. 20 where in the past two weeks have you heard 21 that? every document that tobacco has issued, all 22 the news pieces that we even showed, for instance, 23 yesterday with mr. -- mr. roberts, who did not want 24 to show you them, the tobacco industry who spoke for 25 them said, the case is still open. it is still not 1 proven. 2 is it really any coincidence that she is 3 uttering the words that they have been the 4 mouthpiece for? that is what they intended and 5 that is what happened. 6 the advertising was so pervasive by this 7 company and the industry, no one who could read or 8 speak could have missed it. no one. so pervasive. 9 it would be like the paint in this wall -- on the 10 wall. it is like how do you miss the paint in the 11 walls? i do not notice it, but it is everywhere. 12 we talked a little about it on voir dire, but 13 you go by the evidence here. how do you know when 14 you are directly being impacted by an ad? the best 15 ads are the ones that make you think it is your idea, 16 the ones that make you buy and you do not even 17 remember, why was it that i wanted that product? 18 let us talk about how jackie started, because we 19 know from the evidence she started as a teenager. 20 and that is important. how did we get to teen 21 smoking in the 1940s? well, we can only look at -- 22 at what they did and start inferring, because 23 jackie's not here to talk to us about it. 24 i'll give you a couple examples. 25 1356. 1 if you were athletic, smoking was for you. if 2 you are a young girl, smoking's for you. not only 3 smoking, but old gold cigarettes, the very brand 4 that jackie smoked in the '40s. 5 now, did you hear any witness say she saw that 6 ad? no. but when you look at how they are patting 7 themselves on the back, how many homes are we 8 reaching in all our advertising, you have got to ask 9 yourselves, is not that what they intended? is not 10 that what occurred? what did they know, when did 11 they know it, and what were they doing with it? 12 let us go to 363, please. 13 santa claus, puppies and cartons of cigarettes. 14 who is that appealing to? jackie miller, although 15 she did not ask for old golds at christmas, thought 16 why not get cartons of cigarettes for christmas, and 17 asked her friend at the town hall. that is what the 18 cigarette industry intended. it is now a holiday 19 thing. 20 so if you are a woman, you are athletic or you are 21 a young girl, smoking's for you. if you like 22 holidays, we have got you covered there too. which 23 population really worries about santa claus and 24 little puppies? we have got you covered. 25 jackie fit in. she fit exactly the consumer 1 they wanted. and for them to say that, we did not 2 intend, or did not know -- frankly, to have 3 disregarded the fact that teens in the 1940s like 4 jackie miller were buying their cigarettes is 5 preposterous. 6 how about 366? 7 sorry. too quick for me. 8 you had it right. i'm sorry. 9 old golds, right on father's day. so now if 10 you enjoy family holidays, family functions, 11 cigarettes are for you. not only that, it is 12 perfectly acceptable for kids to be handing up 13 cigarettes to their parents. perhaps that was one 14 of those we would never say that today, but we are 15 not apologizing for it, but that is what was going 16 on. 17 can it honestly be said that we are not 18 expecting kids to say, how do i please dad, back in 19 the '40s? you know, times were different. dad 20 would come home. family would be waiting. you 21 know, hard day at work. dad sits back. what have 22 we got for you? the dog is waiting for you. the 23 kids are waiting for you. 24 i wonder where jackie miller got the idea that 25 it is all right to smoke with family or share 1 cigarettes with her daughter or ask for cigarettes 2 from her family members. i just wonder where she 3 got that idea from. 4 that is what they intended. that is what 5 happened. and they cannot sit here and be surprised. 6 so you could be a young girl, you could be 7 athletic, you could like holidays and puppies and 8 santa claus, you could be a family person, you could 9 be a child. they have got something for you. and 10 that is when she was smoking cigarettes as a 11 teenager. 12 how about 365, please? 13 old gold again. you can be a student. you can 14 be the guy they look up to or you can be the girl 15 that wants to be noticed. you heard that from one 16 of her friends, did not you? we all wanted to be 17 noticed. 18 interesting when kristy leung was trying to 19 explain away that document. remember what she said 20 about him? that boy -- i mean, guy. that is how she 21 said it. why? because he does look young. 22 school-age kid? i've got a product for you. 23 now, did they say specifically high school? no. 24 but were they telling the message that you should not 25 be? no. and for them to throw that out in the 1 marketplace and jackie miller in her teens is a high 2 school smoker and then try to claim, we did not 3 intend it, that is reckless disregard for the 4 consequences to smokers and teenagers. 5 you heard from dr. werner. teens do not have 6 the ability to make an informed choice about a drug 7 like nicotine, period. 8 why do not we show 31 after this one here. we 9 have -- we have got new smyrna beach high school. 10 p-31. 11 we heard a lot about new smyrna beach high 12 school, across the street where they smoke. any 13 surprise that after the last ad we saw that kids 14 from this high school, including jackie miller, used 15 old gold cigarettes across the street? 16 you have got the boys who want to be cool, you have 17 got the girls who want to be noticed, and you have got 18 jackie who is right there with them, and you have got 19 them smoking old gold cigarettes. that is what they 20 intended, that is what happened, and now they cannot 21 be surprised that you will hold them accountable. 22 so how did they do it? 23 p-28. 24 well, i'd ask you to consider that lorillard 25 tobacco company made a deal with a 16-year-old girl, 1 a 16-year-old girl, to smoke their cigarettes, to 2 become a brand-loyal customer. 3 p-29, please. 4 they knew through their research you need 5 marketing. no consumer product is more sensitive to 6 advertising. and you saw the testimony from 7 ms. leung. when we put money into ads, that product 8 flourished. it happened with old gold, it happened 9 with kent, and eventually it happened with newport. 10 when they took money away from the ads and when they 11 walked away from the health assurance of kent, the 12 sales started going down. 13 so they needed to market, and they knew 14 nicotine was addictive. they knew more than anybody 15 on the street -- they knew more than dr. burns they 16 told you. if we knew what they knew, we would not 17 have said what we did. there was a time when he 18 advised his patients that, you should probably 19 switch to a filter cigarette. 20 but they knew. they are the expert. they are 21 the ones with research and development and hundreds 22 of people working on staff. they are the ones who 23 want to put the product out. 24 if we get you as a youth, we have got you for 25 life. 1 so how do they do it? they create doubt and 2 controversy. even though you are going to hear and 3 did hear all the health claims that were aware in 4 the '50s, '60s on that dr. roberts told you about. 5 tobacco was the master of creating doubt and 6 controversy. no, no, it is not been proven. there is 7 only a causal link. 8 they always had a different word for it, create 9 doubt and controversy, reassure the smoker who is 10 smoking. reassure the nicotine addict who needs to 11 rationalize what they are doing. 12 what did they do? they did not admit that 13 cigarettes caused disease until 2000, the year 2000. 14 you heard a lot about cigarette warnings, and they 15 wanted to parade those in front of you. every time 16 you see a cigarette warning on the screen or hear it 17 talked about, remember, they did not agree with any 18 of them until 2000, except one. remember 19 mr. spears, when we were reading his deposition, he 20 did admit that cigarettes have carbon monoxide 21 in them. 22 but up until 1997 when he testified, he did not 23 believe there was a problem with cigarettes. he 24 did not believe it was proven. he did not believe any 25 of the warnings on the packs. and nor did his 1 predecessors, mr. tisch or mr. orlowsky. 2 so every time they talk about their warning 3 labels and how everybody else knew, ask yourself, 4 what did you know, when did you know it, and what 5 did you do about it? because the evidence is clear 6 they have never done anything for the smoker's 7 benefit and the public's benefit until they have been 8 required to. 9 before they were required to slap a label on 10 their cigarette pack, they had the option to warn 11 people before. did not do it. 12 you saw it this morning with mr. woods. the 13 list of ingredients they put on their website march 14 of 2010. you heard their testimony before. until 15 the '80s when they were required to disclose those 16 ingredients, they did not do it. they did not do it 17 until they were forced to do it. 18 so for them to come into the courtroom and wrap 19 the warnings around them like the american flag and 20 point to the smoker and say, it is all your fault, 21 either/or, well, that defies your common sense. 22 it is time to compare and measure 23 responsibilities and faults and say, no, lorillard, 24 you needed to stand up and agree that you were 25 partially at fault, and we are going to evaluate 1 what you knew, when you knew it, and what you did 2 about it, or looking at it the other way, what you 3 did not do about it, and hold you equally 4 responsible. 5 pardon me a minute. 6 nicotine we learned about. nicotine is a drug 7 which, incidentally, you heard from dr. robinson, 8 even though they admitted in 2000 that cigarettes 9 were addictive, they did not admit until about a 10 month before his deposition that nicotine is a drug, 11 when the fda wanted to regulate them. they never 12 moved until they were forced to. and instead, doubt 13 and controversy. they always had an answer for the 14 public and they always had a criticism of the 15 surgeon general. always. 16 what did they do? what did they do with the 17 information? criticize. doubt and controversy. 18 and why? to reassure smokers who had a disease of 19 addiction, an addiction that you heard from 20 dr. werner, the only expert in this case to talk to 21 you about addiction in this courtroom, to say that 22 addiction, that disease undermines your ability to 23 motivate to quit. it starts to remove free choice. 24 jackie miller, she said, was addicted. jackie 25 miller had her motivation undermined by this 1 disease. her free choice was affected. not that it 2 cannot be quit, you cannot quit, but it was affected. 3 if they had someone to say that is not true, 4 they would have brought them to you. if they had an 5 expert to say, no, i disagree, jackie miller's free 6 choice was not affected; no, i disagree, jackie 7 miller, her motivation was not undermined; do not you 8 think you would have heard that? 9 they had no problem parading an expert in here 10 at over half a million dollars to tell you a little 11 bit about the history of tobacco and the awareness, 12 and, yet, when we come to the main issue in the 13 case, whether someone's addicted and can quit, there 14 was silence. the silence was deafening. 15 the only evidence you have is from dr. werner, 16 the evidence that you have sworn you are going to 17 follow. she was addicted; it was a disease; 18 nicotine was a drug; it undermined her motivation to 19 be able to quit; it removed her free will; it caused 20 her to continue to smoke. 21 that is the evidence you heard from the only 22 board-certified psychiatrist that walked into court 23 to talk about addiction. 24 now, you heard from dr. burns, who told you 25 that from the frank statement on, the tobacco 1 industry, including lorillard, acted irresponsibly, 2 plain and simple. he said, no, it was not true that 3 there was -- that it was not proven. they said the 4 opposite. no, it is not true that nicotine's 5 addictive. they keep saying the opposite. 6 every time we issued a surgeon general report, 7 he told you, every time, they always had an answer. 8 and it was never applause. it was always criticism. 9 it was always filled with scandalous remarks about 10 how the surgeon general is misleading the american 11 public, how it is a scare tactic. 12 so when they ask you to consider what jackie 13 miller knew and when she knew it and what she did 14 with it, please compare what they were doing with 15 the information. how can they expect you to hold 16 jackie miller to a standard that they refuse to live 17 by? 18 when their executives walked in in 1997 for 19 their depo, and 1993, and said, i do not believe it is 20 addictive, i do not believe it causes harm, how can 21 they honestly say to you that she was acting 22 unreasonably, that she should know more than the 23 experts? 24 dr. spears had been there for over 30 years and 25 ascended to the throne at lorillard. well, to give 1 you a little break, we came in and said, yeah, she is 2 still, though, partially at fault. we did that. 3 and yet they are still going to sit there with 4 dr. spears from the throne and say she knew more, 5 she should have done more, she should be solely 6 responsible. 7 i would submit you should reject that 8 all-or-nothing approach. just like dr. werner told 9 you, it is not just all or nothing. it is not just 10 enjoyment or addiction or choice and addiction. 11 they work together. the disease of addiction is 12 not -- is not negligence. it is not even fault. but 13 she was trying to overcome it. 14 enjoyment. dr. werner told you there is no way 15 an untrained person can look at an addict and say, 16 when they are using it, ah, that is enjoyment. 17 presumably they would get on the stand or get 18 up here and tell you that in that last week of her 19 life jackie miller, lying in her bed, asking her 20 daughter-in-law to take that smoke and puff it in 21 her face, she was enjoying it. the last thing she is 22 doing and thinking about is enjoying a cigarette. 23 you know differently. she was feeding an 24 addiction. the brain, the receptors, they were 25 hungry. she was not worried about food on that 1 deathbed at that point. she was worried about 2 nicotine. and that is what she got. they knew it, 3 they intended it, and that is what happened. 4 i'm coming to the end of where i need to be 5 finishing up with you on my first part, so i'm going 6 to move quickly. 7 in this case we are going to ask you to hold 8 lorillard tobacco company also liable to jackie 9 miller for her death, also responsible, and we are 10 going to ask you to compare and measure the fault 11 about who knew what, when, and what they did with 12 it. and we are going to trust you to do that. 13 but we are going to ask you to, at the end of 14 this case on the verdict form, hold them responsible 15 and actually speak loudly in this courtroom through 16 a verdict and say that their negligence from the 17 engle findings was a legal cause of her death, it 18 substantially contributed to her lung cancer, in 19 combination with hers. 20 and his honor is going to tell you about what a 21 term called concurring cause did. if their 22 negligence acted even with hers or another's, it is 23 still a legal cause. they are responsible for her 24 lung cancer and death. 25 we are going to ask you to find that their 1 product defect, those unreasonably dangerous 2 cigarettes, were also a legal cause of her death. 3 we are going to ask you to find and hold them 4 responsible for concealing information and agreeing 5 and conspiring to withhold information and say, yes, 6 that too played a part in her lung cancer and death. 7 it was a legal cause. 8 and then we are going to ask you to evaluate the 9 loss that you have heard about in this courtroom, the 10 loss to michelle mrozek, malia torgensen, robert 11 miller, for the loss of their mother who died at 12 least statistically -- if you believe the centers 13 for disease control, died 19.9 years too young 14 because of the lung cancer. 15 and we are going to ask you to evaluate what 16 those damages are for the loss of the companionship 17 of a mother, the loss of guidance from a mother and 18 protection. and i would submit that you could 19 consider that using your common sense because jurors 20 really are the experts on human experiences. 21 but consider this. dr. tisch took the -- or 22 mr. tisch took the stand when we read his 23 deposition, at the time top executive at lorillard. 24 and we asked him, did you contribute to the tobacco 25 institute? 1 yes, we did. they spoke for us. 2 how much did you contribute to the tobacco 3 institute? 4 and he told you three to four million dollars 5 every year. every year. 6 and i would submit to you when you are 7 considering what has been lost, what was valued, 8 what is gone forever, that you at least consider 9 what they value. the tobacco industry and ctr was 10 kind of like a brainchild, if you will, of the 11 industry. it was their child that they put out 12 there, and they nurtured it with information and 13 they certainly nurtured it with 3- to $4 million out 14 of their pocket, lorillard alone, every year. and 15 what did they get? protection. comfort. a valued 16 relationship. 17 i'd ask you to consider the loss to mrs. mrozek 18 and ms. torgensen and their brother, mr. miller, to 19 be equal to what lorillard thought that value of the 20 ti was to them. but we are going to leave that to 21 your discretion. 22 at the end of this case, we are going to ask 23 you, also, what is the last question, to consider 24 whether what we call punitive damages are warranted. 25 now, those are not just to compensate what was lost. 1 these are determined to be for punishment and to 2 deter conduct in the future. 3 and you are going to have to prove -- we are 4 going to have to show that to you, and have, by 5 clear and convincing evidence, very specific 6 evidence that you heard, that what they did they 7 intended to do, that they were reckless with jackie 8 miller as a teen; that what they did, they had -- 9 they were indifferent to whether she would pick up 10 the cigarette or any other teen; that during her 11 life when they were promoting their kent cigarettes 12 that they were so grossly negligent that they 13 disregarded her health in telling her this is the 14 greatest health protection in cigarette history. 15 we are going to ask you to find and hold them liable 16 for punitive damages to punish them. 17 i think when you are considering the questions 18 we have been asking, i think in the punitive damages 19 on that last question, i'd ask you to consider it in 20 these terms. 21 p-20. 22 lorillard had the means. they had choices. 23 they made decisions. 24 21, p-21. 25 they had the motive to disregard the health 1 consequences of people like ms. miller. 2 p-22. 3 jackie miller provided the opportunity. and 4 that is why they are liable for punitive damages. 5 in closing, i think you heard at the beginning 6 of this case that those engle findings by themselves 7 mean nothing for the defense, that they mean nothing 8 more, nothing less. and that is true. six findings 9 thrown up on a board, on maybe a screen by 10 themselves, mean absolutely nothing. 11 but when you bring them into a court of law, 12 when you give nine jurors in this community who have 13 taken an oath to evaluate all the evidence and 14 fairly judge the case and you bring them before a 15 judge who wears a robe, with flags, and says, you 16 will consider only the evidence and use only the law 17 i give you, and you hear from witnesses over two 18 weeks and the evidence that you have heard, when 19 those six findings are applied to a jury like 20 yourselves to understand them and to apply them, 21 then they are not just nothing. they do not just mean 22 nothing. they are more than what they are once you 23 apply them to this case. 24 when you look at those six findings, and like 25 all the evidence you have had in this case, and you 1 consider jackie miller, what she knew, when she knew 2 it, what she did with the information, you compare 3 to lorillard what they knew, when they knew it, and 4 what they did and did not do with it, we trust you 5 will hold them accountable in this courtroom and say 6 so with your verdict. 7 thank you. 8 thank you, your honor. 25 mr. patacca: counsel. and, again, members of 1 the jury, this is now my final opportunity to 2 address points that were made during this 3 mr. molony's closing on behalf of lorillard tobacco 4 company. my purpose is not to reiterate everything 5 i said in my first closing, that would be improper. 6 it is to address what he brought up, but i think 7 there are many things i do need to address. i 8 tried to organize them quickly in the break but, 9 nonetheless, some of them may come in bullet-point 10 format, i'll apologize in advance. 11 first of all, i thought it seemed rather 12 peculiar, and perhaps when you review the evidence, 13 that lorillard tobacco company came in today and 14 put documents up talking about cooperation and 15 discussed their cooperation in closing and patted 16 themselves on the back for how they worked with the 17 tobacco working group and the surgeon general and 18 they flip open a book and read an acknowledgment 19 saying, see, we were thanked for attending the 20 party, when the very first person that they were 21 talking about who cooperated was the gentleman you 22 heard from on the stand, mr. alexander spears, iii, 23 ph.d., who testified before you from this stand on 24 april 15, 1997, under oath. the very same 25 gentleman who had been with them for decades who 1 was a chemist, ph.d., and adamantly refused to 2 believe that in 1997 smoking caused any related 3 illness. period. 4 and they want to pat themselves on the back 5 and parade you, the jury, and supposedly, i guess, 6 show you that they are doing good work by sending 7 mr. spears into the henhouse and cooperate and try 8 to cure and make a less hazardous cigarette when he 9 does not even believe it is hazardous. that is 10 allowing the fox into the henhouse, or worse, 11 reading the acknowledgment, "thanks for coming to 12 the party," and then after the party is over you go 13 out and you talk behind the hostess's back. 14 the surgeon general, he is misleading the 15 public, the surgeon general, scare tactics. 16 no. 55 please. 17 cooperation. here we are in 1988, this is not 18 even back on the '64, this is not even '72 where we 19 showed you the news report where they were talking 20 behind the hostess's back, so to speak. 1988, the 21 ones who are cooperating, quote/unquote, with the 22 surgeon general, with public health in the public 23 interest come out with a press release, the ti, 24 tobacco institute, which speaks for the industry, 25 paid behind by them, comes out and says, "claims 1 that cigarettes are addictive, irresponsible, and 2 scare tactics." 3 the court: you want me to turn the mic off 4 and you will talk louder? 5 mr. patacca: yes, sir. if you do not mind. 6 thank you, your honor. 7 the court: just keep your voice up. 8 mr. patacca: yes, sir. 9 the court: you do not have to stand by the 10 mic, just keep your voice up. 11 mr. patacca: yes, sir. highlight just the 12 bottom for me, ms. chaney. 13 this is in 1988 after the rotating warnings, 14 remember we talked about wrapping ourselves in the 15 warnings and holding everyone else accountable, 16 holding everyone else responsible for what the 17 rotating warnings say, when the gentleman who 18 supposedly knows the most about lorillard and 19 health issues, the one who is the cooperator, '88 20 they are saying the claim that there is a physical 21 dependence to smoking is simply a desperate attempt 22 to find some way to differentiate smoking from 23 other habits. 24 i would submit to you and your common sense 25 that if you invited such a person to your party and 1 you were kind enough to thank them in the letter 2 and say, "thanks for coming to the party," and you 3 heard that after the party they were sitting out 4 back telling everybody what a terrible party it was 5 and how you dropped the ball on all the 6 hors d'oeuvres and you did not invite the right 7 people, and you were sending the wrong message and 8 it was a complete waste of everybody's time, a, 9 with a friend like that, you would never have a 10 friend again; and, b, you would not invite him to 11 the party again. 12 so before you come into this courtroom in 13 north florida down from greensboro, north carolina 14 and pat yourself on the back and tell what a 15 wonderful you did with surgeon general and the 16 tobacco working group, first of all, send somebody 17 who knows what he is talking about. send somebody 18 who believes in the message. 19 mr. anderson started this case is that, 20 would not it have been different. what if? what if 21 they did not always talk against the message? what 22 if they actually joined the message? what if they 23 came out with the surgeon general every time and 24 said, we applaud the efforts of the surgeon 25 general? we know the surgeon general's heart is in 1 the right place. we are going to work and do more 2 with the surgeon general. what if lorillard 3 actually said to people like jackie miller on their 4 packs before the warnings and said, we encourage 5 you to smoke less? what if they said, it is 6 dangerous, before even the warnings came out and 7 they meant it? not the warning they put on because 8 they had to, because of all the regulations. you 9 saw regulations up on this timeline by mr. molony, 10 the whole closing, regulation, regulation, 11 regulation. and we know they did nothing without 12 being regulated. 13 and, that, that is like catching your child 14 with his hand in the jar and saying, what are you 15 doing? i said, do not eat the cookie before dinner. 16 he says, oh, no, you are right, i'm not going to eat 17 the cookie. and you know darn well he is going to 18 eat the cookie. and now he is kind of looking at 19 you in disbelief like, why would you punish me? i 20 said i was not going to eat the cookie. you know 21 darn well if you had not caught him, he was going to 22 eat the cookie. 23 for them to come to the courtroom and parade 24 that they cooperated with the surgeon general and 25 the public health officials like dr. burns, a man 1 who devoted his entire life to smoking and health 2 for the public benefit, before they say all those 3 comments like scare tactics, irresponsible, surgeon 4 general is the public enemy on this issue because 5 you are misleading, before they call that 6 cooperation, they should think about jurors like 7 yourself who evaluate that and use their common 8 sense. 9 you took your child to that first day at 10 school and you said to your child, this teacher 11 deserves all your respect. listen to her, she is 12 going to give you good information, respect her, 13 like mom and dad do. and then while you step back 14 and the kids are milling around listening to the 15 teacher who is doing her best to teach a roomful of 16 kids with everything she is got, the parent's 17 sitting back there with all new parents and say, 18 you know, i think she is biased. she does not know 19 what she is talking about. my kid should not even be 20 listening. if that were the type of cooperation 21 you found in the everyday experience, you would call it 22 what it was, disruptive, ridiculous, irresponsible. 23 that discussion does not happen between you and the 24 teacher across the room with the child. if you 25 have a disagreement, you do it in private. there is 1 a time and a place. 2 no different in the tobacco controversy that 3 they created in this united states america. the 4 greatest health issue affecting this country in the 5 20th century, and instead of joining with the 6 message, truly cooperating, they spoke across the 7 room to the teacher, the surgeon general, said, 8 you are biased, scare tactics. and the smokers 9 do not know who to believe. and then they are 10 surprised when one of them actually hears the 11 message and says, i do not believe it is been proven. 12 use your common sense. that is what is going on in 13 this courtroom in 2011. 14 you were told that at the end of the day all 15 lorillard did was sell a legal product, and you 16 cannot hold them responsible for just selling a 17 legal product. i think mr. molony started his 18 opening two weeks ago and said, i think, i'm going 19 to predict that you are going to find this was a 20 typical customer/manufacturer relationship. 21 typical, just a legal product. and as he suggested 22 in his opening when he was talking about many 23 things, he said, but you know, members of the jury, 24 there is more work to be done here, you would not be 25 here otherwise. instead, you are probably asking 1 yourself, why are we here? 2 well, before you learned any of the evidence, 3 before you came into court, you might not have 4 known, but because you sat for two weeks of 5 testimony and all the exhibits you do know, because 6 if lorillard is saying that the typical 7 customer/manufacturer relationship is where the 8 manufacturer acts negligently, if the typical 9 manufacturer sells a defective and dangerous 10 product to the customer, and if the typical 11 manufacturer also hides, omits, and conceals data 12 that people would want to know to defend 13 themselves, to arm themselves, to protect 14 themselves, and if the typical manufacturer agreed 15 with others to conspire to say, we will not release 16 the information for the mighty buck. if that were 17 the typical manufacturing relationship, you would 18 turn your head and shake it and say, no way. you 19 learned through two weeks of testimony this was not 20 a typical manufacturer/customer relationship. 21 in fact, i would suggest to you, you know more 22 in two weeks about both sides of the story where we 23 measure and compare than a distinguished professor 24 of history who took the stand. in two weeks you 25 saw more internal documents than he even knew 4074 1 existed. they brought you that man to tell you the 2 story of tobacco, and he had to concede to 3 mr. anderson, if i were doing my normal work where 4 i publish a book where i would hope to get a 5 pulitzer, i would look at secondary sources and 6 primary sources. i'd go to archives. i'd look in 7 libraries. 8 what did he do in this case? did he go to the 9 archives? did he go to their library? he did not 10 even know they had a library. did he even show you 11 the news accounts that actually showed tobacco 12 cooperating on national news, blaming the host and 13 the hostess? no. i submit to you if dr. roberts 14 wanted to write the book today or write the 15 peer-reviewed article, it would be rejected because 16 it was one sided. he did not look at all the 17 evidence and, frankly, he was biased. 18 he had 500,000 good reasons over the last 19 eight to nine years why he might only look at one 20 aspect of the story. and, frankly, he did not even 21 come to them as an expert in tobacco. he was not an 22 expert, he conceded, on anything with regard to the 23 smoking controversy. he became an expert on that 24 portion of history when he came to them. 25 now, had they wanted him to tell you about the 1 history of boxing or john wayne, he could have come 2 in and said, i know that already, i'm ready to 3 testify, tell me what i need to know about the 4 specifics of the case. but he did not. 5 they manufactured an expert in dr. roberts, 6 plain and simple. unlike dr. burns, you heard he is 7 made a lot of money, but over 25 years. but he 8 did not develop his expertise to come into a 9 courtroom, he was doing it before the surgeon 10 general was really even ready. he was with every 11 surgeon general's report. he went out of medical 12 school and joined the clearinghouse for tobacco and 13 health. he was doing it for real, and then he 14 said, this is such a great issue, i'm getting 15 involved, and that is what -- that is what he is. 16 that is who we brought you. a real expert, 17 nonmanufactured. 18 who else did we bring you? they want to talk 19 about what they believe ms. miller was thinking, 20 that she must not had motivation, she must have 21 enjoyed it, she must have not wanted to quit. we 22 lawyers are not the evidence. that is assumption. 23 that is advocacy for your client. if they really 24 wanted to hear that ms. miller was not motivated, 25 they should have brought that expert to you on 1 addiction to come in and say they already got what 2 they needed out of dr. burns and dr. werner, well, 3 you consider that, you evaluate that talk. 4 they should have brought you an expert to say, 5 i'd like you to assume ms. miller's addicted. tell 6 us about how she might still enjoy it. you have 7 heard absolutely no evidence in this courtroom 8 other than from the university of florida college 9 of medicine, dr. tonia werner, who treats people, 10 inpatient, who teaches other psychiatrists, who 11 does both forensic work for the state, on both the 12 criminal side for the prosecutors and the defense, 13 on the civil side for civil commitments and cases 14 like this, and this is one of the few she is done of 15 tobacco. 16 she walked in the courtroom and gave it to you 17 all. now, if she were manufactured, she could come 18 in and say, no, no, no, even if you are addicted, 19 you can never quit. and she did not do that. she 20 was candid. yeah, you still can quit, but it is 21 harder. every day's a struggle. there is a cycle. 22 she gave it to you all. 23 they could have brought you an expert if they 24 really wanted you to surmise and assume and guess 25 what jackie miller must have been thinking or 1 whether or not she really wanted to quit. 2 the elephant in the room that is not been 3 talked about is the disease. and just like they 4 do not want you -- they want you to say, look, it is 5 a legal product, you cannot find liability for 6 selling a legal product. you cannot find liability 7 because she had a disease. there has to be 8 conduct, unreasonable conduct. and just as they 9 say you cannot find them liable just because they 10 sold a legal product, you cannot hold her liable 11 just because she purchased a cigarette. it is not 12 that easy in this courtroom. 13 you have to prove unreasonable conduct. what 14 did she know, when did she know it, what did she do 15 with it? what did they know, when did they know 16 it? what did they do with it? that is why we 17 compare, that is why we measure, that is why they 18 both contributed substantially to jackie miller's 19 smoking and her lung cancer and her death. it is 20 not either/or. 21 they would like you to think it was that simple. 22 in fact, when they read the instructions that 23 you are going to hear from the court, they kept 24 forgetting to mention the concurring cause as we 25 say. i expect his honor will read for you and 1 continue on past where mr. molony did, for 2 instance, under negligence, "in order to be 3 regarded as a legal cause of injury, negligence 4 need not be the only cause. negligence may be a 5 legal cause of injury even though it operates in 6 combination with the act of another if the 7 negligence contributes substantially to producing 8 the loss." 9 even if she has fault it can act in 10 combination with their fault. even though she was 11 addicted and that was working against her, that can 12 work in combination with their fault. and, 13 frankly, members of the jury, if they had an expert 14 who wanted to come in and say it played absolutely 15 no role, they could have brought that person in 16 here to provide you testimony under oath, again, so 17 we all hear the same evidence at the same time, no 18 independent research, and so both sides get to ask 19 questions on the stand, that is the fair way to do 20 it. 21 so if they wanted an expert to tell you, we 22 absolutely had no contribution, not even an iota, 23 they could have brought that you and they did not. 24 that was their choice. that is the evidence you now 25 have before you. uncontroverted by the only 1 board-certified psychiatrist who walked into this 2 courtroom, who evaluated this case to say she was 3 addicted. it undermined her motivation. it 4 affected her free will. it caused her to smoke 5 more. it substantially contributed to her disease 6 and her death. there is absolutely no evidence from 7 a qualified medical person otherwise. 8 well, what did they want to talk about? lay 9 witnesses, as we call them as lawyers, nonmedical 10 personnel. we called her friends. and let me 11 remind you, we called them. we knew what they were 12 going to say. 13 let us talk about some of the witnesses. i 14 mean, no witness is perfect in their memory, no 15 person is perfect in their memory, but we brought 16 you everything they had to say over 50 years 17 because you were entitled to know as much as we 18 could find out from louise fink, ms. schumacher, 19 ms. hall, ms. dawson. 20 do not you think if michelle mrozek and her 21 aunt carol really wanted to make this look good, we 22 would not bring you people that kind of give it both 23 ways? does that make sense? they want you to use 24 the testimony of the people who took the stand like 25 the friends or even ralph, who say just because 1 they knew what they knew must prove what jackie 2 knew. and just because they saw ms. miller 3 smoking, that she must have enjoyed it. 4 dr. werner already talked about that. in true 5 addiction, which there is no dispute about, true 6 addiction, nobody disputes that. in true 7 addiction, a layperson cannot tell the difference 8 between enjoyment and the perception of enjoyment 9 because the addiction works on dopamine. and i'd 10 like to talk about what that enjoyment is. i mean, 11 for them to say she is constantly smoking in 12 pictures, that proves she must have enjoyed it, or 13 that she failed to stop, that must prove it. what 14 that proves is she was addicted, there was no 15 dispute about that. 16 if she smoked one pack a day that was 20 17 cigarettes a day, two packs would be 40. at some 18 point you heard it was three packs a day, 60. i 19 would submit to you to consider that at certain 20 times in her life over decades there is nothing in 21 the human experience -- i know that dr. werner gave 22 you examples of dopamine, there is absolutely 23 nothing in the human experience that anybody would 24 ever do 40 and 60 times a day for pleasure because 25 at that point the novelty wears off, and i mean 1 nothing. 2 if she smoked each cigarette approximately ten 3 minutes each, and we were to take the average of 30 4 cigarettes, that is 300 minutes a day she is spending 5 with a cigarette in her hand, smelling her fingers 6 up, smelling the house up, taking up in her mouth, 7 300 minutes, five hours of her day. that is a 8 full-time job. that is a substantial portion of her 9 life, and there was nothing more telling than when 10 she was diagnosed with cancer, enjoyment? she 11 wanted to smoke. the disease was so tight and so 12 strong in her she did not even want hospice to be 13 called in. do you remember why? she was afraid 14 they would take the cigarettes away. this is a woman 15 who is facing the end, she is not looking at what is 16 enjoyable or not. she is facing, what do i need? 17 if they wanted any evidence for you to 18 consider in that jury room later this afternoon, 19 that she truly enjoyed it, that she was not ever 20 motivated, and that it was not affected by her 21 addiction, they could have brought you that very 22 expert and they did not, and that was their choice. 23 now, we also brought you dr. robicsek, the 24 board-certified cardiothoracic surgeon. that 25 gentleman has been performing surgery since the 1 '50s, the first heart transplant. literally had 2 someone's life in his hands in the '70s. 35,000 3 procedures later, came in here to talk about it. 4 and their first question or their biggest 5 comment to him was, did not you know we all agree 6 that smoking causes cancer in jackie miller? you 7 must have been thinking, why is he here? and now 8 you know. you did not hear mr. molony ever say it, 9 yeah, we agree the lorillard cigarettes caused it. 10 instead he wants to talk about there is some gaps in 11 the '50s that we do not really know what she is 12 smoking, and there is cigarettes at the end, the 13 misty's and the capris and the virginia slims, 14 they will say in big general terms that smoking 15 cigarettes cause cancer, but they are hoping you are 16 going to say, well, maybe they did not prove 17 lorillard cigarettes did. they are very careful 18 with their words, they could have just conceded 19 that to dr. robicsek. 20 i had to ask him that question, did you have 21 an opinion within a reasonable degree of medical 22 certainty whether the lorillard products that she 23 was smoking in the '50s, '60s, '70s and into the 24 '80s substantially contributed to causing her lung 25 cancer and death. and he said, absolutely, yes. 1 not even touched on cross-examination. that is the 2 evidence you have in this case. 3 now, what was important -- also important was 4 that in the last five, six years they want to talk 5 about risk reduction if you quit earlier, what 6 might have been. let us go back, let us read minds, 7 let us look back. dr. robicsek told you this is one 8 of the worst cancers in the world to get in the 9 body. small cell carcinoma takes its victims very 10 quickly, year, year and a half regardless. there 11 was nothing that jackie did or did not do in the 12 last five years, for sure, no questions asked, that 13 made a difference. she had smoked enough over the 14 course of her life that she was going to get the 15 lung cancer and die. was just waiting to go. 16 so i do not know, honestly, what the 17 significance of the misty's and the capris and such 18 at the end were. it certainly did not make a 19 difference in the outcome. but it is interesting 20 to kind of see that once again jackie is 21 gravitating to the long skinny cigarettes that you 22 heard about, the capris and misty's, virginia 23 slims. she is still sticking around with the 24 women's marketed cigarettes. certainly a woman who 25 is aware of the marketing. 1 but, again, they never actually said to you 2 what is not in dispute that was on the screen in the 3 opening, lorillard cigarettes caused the cancer. 4 never looked you in the eye and told you that, did 5 they? 6 i talked about memories so we will go to carol 7 gibson. and, again, no witness's memory is 8 perfect. no human's memory is perfect. and carol 9 gibson tried to do the best she could recall. and 10 the best criticism, as well, the first time we 11 asked her questions for six hours she did not 12 remember exactly when the kent started. and she 13 said probably around '59. she actually said when 14 they put it on the board and when they asked her, 15 did not you say this? she actually said, it was 16 probably earlier but i just do not know. and then 17 they want to criticize her for after thinking about 18 it, like many people do after they have been grilled, 19 and they start looking back over the years to say, 20 you know what, i remember even earlier when i was 21 younger and criticize her for saying, i'm willing 22 to get deposed again for hours and ask away. 23 and she told you she -- she gave you her best. 24 and their best criticism is, well, she does not 25 remember anything because apparently her memory and 1 billie carter dawson's memory of the wedding is not 2 the same. you may recall, and i picked up on it, 3 too, because, frankly, we have heard all testimony in 4 the videos before you heard it, we know what 5 they are going to say, but they asked her, billie 6 carter dawson, do you think she went to your 7 sister's wedding when she eloped to georgia or not? 8 and she said, no, she was not there. and i imagine 9 some of you caught it and thought, wait a minute, 10 billie carter dawson said in her video she was at 11 that get-away. and you must have been thinking, 12 what is going on? that is certainly frailties of 13 memories and inconsistencies. but let us remember 14 who else testified in this case. 15 i do not know where billie carter came up with 16 it, i do not know. i'm not sure she came up with 17 anything, but that is what she remembers. but joan 18 hall, the bride who actually went to georgia 19 testified and what did she tell you? the four of 20 us went up to georgia to get married. jackie 21 miller was coming with me to be my witness. and 22 when we were there we got married. she did not say 23 anything about a party going up. in fact, she 24 said, we got married and we came to jacksonville 25 for a dinner and one-night honeymoon and went home. 1 now, does it make a hill-of-beans difference 2 who went to the wedding in georgia? i would hope 3 not. i do not know. but i just suggest to you that 4 before we get overly critical of witness's 5 testimony over a span of decades on topics that 6 they probably never thought they would ever be asked 7 again, have some understanding and common sense 8 that not everything's going to be perfect. and if 9 we thought that everything had to be perfect, we 10 would have never brought you some of those 11 witnesses. 12 but since we are talking about forgiving and 13 misstatements and mistakes, mr. molony started off 14 telling you how he made a mistake two weeks ago 15 when he did not mean to say, i'm not apologizing, 16 that was a mistake. now, mr. molony's a fine 17 attorney, fine, well-prepared presentation in 18 opening and closing. i'll accept him at his word, 19 of course, that if he made a mistake, he made a 20 mistake because he meant to say he is not defending 21 them. well, i disagree there. he is defending 22 them. now, when we talk about all the things in 23 the past that you would never say today, that 24 stuff, that was wrong, plain and simple. but we 25 do not need mr. molony to speak for them. we had 1 kristi leung to speak for them. 2 so when they had the person who could truly 3 come in and speak to it, they had her, we had her. 4 now, you have to go by your memory. i'll go by my 5 notes, but it is kristi leung, their marketing 6 director, was asked, "and it would be morally 7 reprehensible as a company to take a product that 8 is addictive and cause -- causes disease and target 9 children with such a product, would not it?" 10 and her answer, "my company believes that 11 smoking is a choice that only adults should be able 12 to -- only adults are mature enough to make. and, 13 therefore, we do not target our advertising and 14 marketing efforts to children." 15 now, on its face it sounds like a fine answer, 16 but if you were going to apologize for the past, 17 the person from lorillard could have said it. and 18 more importantly, when you hear kristi leung's 19 testimony, when you heard it, evaluate like you 20 would any other witness, because his honor's going 21 to tell you, consider what their demeanor, their 22 frankness, but also what interest did they have? 23 they want to talk about carol gibson hoping, you 24 know, her niece does well. think about what 25 interest lorillard's own employees have this in 1 case. 2 why did not she want to admit that, yeah, there 3 were times when our advertising was over the top 4 and we did target teens and ms. miller was a teen 5 when she was smoking. would not it have been more 6 credible to say, mistakes were made, things were 7 done that we would not have done now, we would never 8 do that. that was the time to say it. instead, 9 she said, "no, we do not even -- we do not even study 10 teens." 11 and then it came out in the examination, 12 "well, actually, you do study some teens because we 13 found out in new jersey, you are saying the base of 14 all your students then or your smokers then, this 15 is later, is the high school students. so whether 16 you are targeting or not, you are studying it, and 17 you know it is going on." 18 and she says, "well, that is inconsistent with 19 everything i've seen." 20 so there was another opportunity, a choice to 21 be made to fess up and say, mistakes were made, 22 documents show that perhaps my research was not as 23 thorough. and then, amazingly, on redirect 24 examination she said, you know what, i found a few 25 other documents, when he asked her questions. 1 yeah, there were other documents of youth smoking, 2 that she was never going to volunteer until he 3 asked her again. another choice to not come clean 4 and say things were done that should not be done 5 today, and we acknowledge them up front. 6 it was always a teasing out, a pulling out, 7 oh, if you have got a document that proves it, okay, 8 i'll admit it. but if you do not and you do not have 9 me with my hand in the cookie jar, i'm not going to 10 admit it. consider that in kristi leung. kristi 11 leung who is been there about ten years, when people 12 in her department have been there 30 years and 13 probably could speak to this. 14 so i guess they had their opportunity, if you 15 will, to speak to you and say mistakes were made 16 and things were done improperly from the corporate 17 representative, not the attorneys. so there'd be 18 no misunderstanding that they did not and they do not 19 and they will not and that is because they just do not 20 get it. that is why we brought up the fact that 21 there are documents continuing on over the decades. 22 yes, mrs. miller's not a teen as she gets older, 23 but it shows the intent is still there later. so 24 when you tell us under oath and say to this jury, 25 we did not mean it back then and do not even agree it 1 occurred, the jury is allowed and it is fair to 2 consider, wait a second, perhaps you are not giving 3 us everything we need to know about what was going 4 on in the '40s with ms. miller if you are still 5 doing and still studying -- despite all the 6 evidence, you are still doing it now. 7 that is why that was important. that is why it 8 is important. they just do not get it. it is a 9 continuing course of conduct by this company that 10 just does not get it. until it is regulated, they 11 do not stop. 12 they made a point of how we prevetted all our 13 ads to the ftc in '58. everything went to the ftc. 14 of course, i showed you the document from 1955. 15 they got -- their hand was in the cookie jar, and 16 the ftc and said, you are making claims that are not 17 true with respect to your filters. so do not pat 18 yourself on the back and come in here in front of a 19 jury and say, well, look, we are just -- we are 20 working on the rules. when you are not looking, 21 when you were not looking, i got caught, but now 22 we are working on the rules. do not worry, i'm not 23 going to eat the cookie before dinner, dad. that is 24 what is going on here. now you know. 25 you know, going back it is -- now you know, 1 like i said, what dr. robinson [sic] does not even 2 know, he did not even look at half the stuff. 3 really, when you think about dr. robinson, i mean, 4 the reason we asked him questions was not because 5 we -- we disagree that there was not a lot of 6 information in the news, there was. but he did not 7 research both sides of the story. and because of 8 that, he had no idea what is going on in this 9 courtroom because what dr. robinson basically did 10 was indict their company. he basically came in to 11 tell you, well, everybody's always known or at 12 least been aware, and as the decades went on they 13 became more aware, and there was a great percentage 14 that believed and there really was no doubt and 15 there really was no controversy, and what he did not 16 know was people like dr. spears in '97 are still 17 saying, i do not know what you are talking about, 18 it is not true, people who were making policy 19 decisions, the president, until 2000. 20 you heard that mr. orlowsky in 2000 made a 21 policy change to say, we will now admit smoking 22 causes disease. it was not because the medicine had 23 changed from 1997 to 2000. so ask yourself what 24 changed? policy. their admission about disease 25 and smoking is based on policy. it is based on the 1 almighty dollar that they collected from customers. 2 when their fingers were all over the cookie 3 jar in 2000 and the gig was up, they finally said, 4 we admit it, yes, there is a process going on here. 5 robinson did not know what you knew about these 6 gentlemen's testimony, that they were still denying 7 into '93 and '97. everything he said indicted 8 them, that they were being reckless with what 9 everybody else must have known, that they were 10 indifferent to what the rest of the country must 11 have been aware of. consider that when we talk 12 about what is clear and convincing. 13 do you have to hesitate to think that 14 everything he said, everything he said about 15 awareness, about this greatest medical and 16 social -- public health problem in this country 17 was, everything he said went completely against 18 what they were still trying to say later. clearly, 19 convincingly, without hesitation. 20 i'm going to speed up. now, again, we were 21 talking about all the friends that we heard about 22 in ms. miller's life. timeline came up several 23 times. here's what i need to say about that. in 24 1974 harold reid died. they want you to infer that 25 jackie must have known he died from lung cancer and 1 smoking. we do not know that, but they want you 2 then to take the next leap to say, well, she must 3 have known he died from lung cancer from smoking, 4 that it should have caused her to quit and that is 5 why she is at fault, but it would have been such a 6 monumental item in her life, her friend -- long 7 friend, admittedly from high school, that he died 8 and somehow that jump must have changed or should 9 have changed her behavior. 10 now, what they forgot on their timeline is 11 harold's wife did not even quit then. i mean, they 12 obviously remembered she did not quit then but they 13 forgot to square this. she did not even quit for 14 another six years. faced with the death of her own 15 husband supposedly because there was a link to 16 cancer and smoking, we will accept that, she was so 17 shocked she kept on smoking. perhaps that shows 18 she was addicted. i do not know. that is not the 19 issue before you, jackie miller was. but to infer 20 that jackie should have known and should have 21 stopped then, that is an assumption. 22 now, other friends of hers quit. billie 23 carter dawson quit in '77. like i said, ms. reid, 24 ms. fink quits in '81 -- or '80, rather. what 25 they are showing you is that in that community of 1 friends apparently it was not as well known as 2 dr. roberts would have you believe. you heard 3 their testimony, i'll rely on your memory, that 4 each and every one of them, some had heard about 5 the surgeon general's report, some had not, some 6 were better aware than others. and each was 7 working through their own smoking issues. it took 8 the doctor, dr. darby, you heard about it, he had 9 to come into ms. reid or ms. fink's hospital room. 10 it was not enough her husband died, but he had come 11 into the hospital room smoking and, basically, in 12 the hospital said, you want to see your 13 grandchildren, you got to stop. and then it 14 finally hit her. apparently that was all it took. 15 you want to see your grandchildren, live that long, 16 you better do it now. 17 now, dr. burns explained that to you. 18 remember when faced with a life-and-death crisis a 19 lot of people, even addicts, will stop and 20 apparently she did. but to say that harold, her 21 husband, died and that is enough to cause jackie to 22 smoke or stop smoking or should have, ignore the 23 very person she is been living with, sharing her 24 life with, went on another six years. and there is 25 been no evidence. they want to speculate with 1 dr. darby must have told jackie. we do not know. 2 but the point is lorillard has known for 3 decades, although they did not admit until 2000, 4 that millions of people will get smoking-related 5 diseases. they also know that a certain percentage 6 maybe even millions do not get diseases. they have 7 known that millions of people will become addicted. 8 but they also know some will not. and of those 9 millions that become addicted, some can quit and 10 some will not. and the ninety percent you hear about 11 quitting, it takes on average seven times to quit. 12 but the point i raise is who is lorillard to 13 know which smoker will get a disease and who will 14 not? who is lorillard to know which smoker will 15 become addicted and who will not? and which smoker 16 may be able to break the vicious cycle of addiction 17 and who will not? they simply cannot. and that is 18 why a reasonably prudent person or company would 19 have to give material information to people to help 20 them arm themselves, because they cannot know, just 21 like the smokers cannot know. but they were in a 22 better position to know. 23 they want you to make jackie miller an 24 epidemiologist. you heard that term, a 25 statistician on health. they want you to take all 1 the information she heard about who died when and 2 what it might have been from, including her dad who 3 she did not believe, that she should have put 4 together all the statistics to go, aha, smoking 5 causes cancer, i'm a smoker, it must be that i'm 6 going to die of cancer. and yet they were the very 7 ones who criticized the host of the party for 8 giving epidemiological evidence. they are the 9 experts, not her, and they want to hold her to a 10 higher standard. what did they know, when did they 11 know it, and what did they do with the information? 12 the other little fact on that timeline that 13 was not talked about that i'd ask you to consider is 14 this agreement, this conspiracy, the whole 15 industry, what they know. what they really know 16 is, not only does it kill you, but they need to 17 replace you. cannot have a viable business model if 18 all your smokers die. 19 so what they did not mention, although you saw 20 it on the timeline, in 1974 harold dies. 21 fortunately, for some manufacturer, michelle mrozek 22 one year later steps in and starts smoking. in 23 1977 billie carter dawson stops smoking. 24 fortunately, for some manufacturer, malia torgensen 25 stepped in. what nobody's acknowledging about this 1 whole conspiracy is not only will the product -- 2 when you use it as intended, it will kill you, but 3 what they need is a replacement smoker to take 4 their place on the timeline, and they do not have 5 any problem with who is stepping in the timeline. 6 they do not having any problem raving and applauding 7 the fact that two minors stepped into the timeline, 8 just like jackie miller and their mother did 9 decades before. 10 the risk reduction again. dr. burns did talk 11 about risk reduction. so did dr. robicsek. the 12 sad truth is your lungs never go back to normal. 13 you can reduce the relative risk. they said it was 14 a relative risk, meaning if you compared yourself 15 to maybe your virtual twin who would keep smoking 16 at the same rate, you have reduced your percentage 17 vis-a-vis the person that continues. but you 18 never, even after 20 years, ever become a never 19 smoke ever again. 20 dr. robicsek told you, when he goes into 21 lungs, they are permanently damaged. dr. burns 22 explained it, the dna is permanently changed. 23 now -- so you can reduce your risk, no doubt. but 24 essentially they want you to kind of guess what 25 would happened to jackie miller, but they proved it 1 themselves when they used dr. burns' testimony and 2 said, look, if she would have quit just ten years 3 earlier, '84, she would have reduced her risk of a 4 smoking-related disease by sixty percent. sounds 5 pretty impressive. 6 when they said she should have stopped 15 7 years earlier, eighty percent, that would have been 8 basically around '80, '79, '80. sounds like a 9 pretty impressive reduction, except what you heard 10 and they touted in the closing was, jackie miller 11 already had a smoking-related disease. smoking 12 cough they were talking about in the '80s, copd and 13 the emphysema, she already had it. 14 now, it is not the same as lung cancer. and 15 perhaps she could have reduced her risk of cancer, 16 and that is why mr. anderson told you and we did 17 that we accept that jackie miller should have done 18 more in the '80s. she did try to quit. now, 19 whether acupuncture's the way to go, who knows, but 20 she tried. she tried again at her sister's 21 wedding. there was an attempt. 22 for them to suggest that jackie miller giving 23 her daughter a cigarette after she quit somehow was 24 evident that maybe jackie enjoyed it, made choices, 25 really flies in the face of any parent/child 1 relationship. does not that really speak to the 2 addiction, that it becomes such a part of you or 3 part of her, rather, that you do not even think 4 twice about what you have just done? giving your 5 child another cigarette. did she really enjoy it? 6 did she really want to suck michelle back in by 7 giving her a cigarette? or did she really -- she 8 did not even think about it? the cycle has taken 9 hold, she is not even understanding, she is 10 rationalizing. that is for you to decide. 11 but i would suggest it is not an all-or-nothing 12 proposition like everything lorillard has proposed 13 to you. everything is either/or with them, all or 14 nothing, and it is just not. the evidence supports 15 that it is not. there is measurement and comparisons 16 that need to be made. there is shared 17 responsibility. there is shared fault. we 18 acknowledge that. they still have not. and that is 19 why they need to be punished. that is why they need 20 to be deterred, because of this conduct, this 21 indifference, this continuing course. this 22 position that they take with this jury because of 23 what happened to ms. miller, in the face of it, not 24 only screams to be compensated, but it screams to 25 be punished and deterred, to speak out. it screams 1 out that your verdict needs to be heard in 2 greensboro, north carolina. 3 not only that you have taken away from three 4 children, but you will not do this again. until 5 they have been regulated, they have never changed their 6 course of conduct. they need to change the course 7 of conduct. that is why punitive damages are going 8 to be warranted here, i would submit to you. 9 i will say this about the questions they asked 10 every witness, did you ever hear jackie miller say 11 she heard anything about -- from tirc and even the 12 frank statement? they never asked them, did you 13 ever hear jackie miller say lorillard told her she 14 should cut back? did you ever hear her say she saw 15 an ad from them saying we want you to smoke less? 16 no. 17 they made choices, too. they made choices 18 throughout jackie's life and her smoking but, you 19 know, this company has been in business for -- 20 since 1760. they were 180 years old or so when she 21 was a teenager choosing to smoke. they have a life 22 that started before jackie, during jackie, and 23 after jackie, not so with jackie and her children. 24 and, honestly, to suggest that in one side of your 25 mouth that jackie miller was a wonderful mom who 4101 1 did everything she could for her children, who was 2 equally loved, and then on the other side to 3 suggest that at most you should fully compensate 4 her children for $10,000 a year each, they are 5 bartering with you. because what they are 6 suggesting is you should give each -- and 7 compensate each child less per year than what they 8 paid their expert to come in here for. the 9 500,000-dollar man. eight years, $500,000. call 10 it ten years, 500,000 in ten years, and they would 11 suggest to you that the bond, the relationship, the 12 companionship, the protection, which nobody has 13 disputed, even them, should be equated to 10,000 a 14 year per child is simply ludicrous. 15 we are going to leave it to you, members of the 16 jury. consider the $500,000 they have paid him for 17 ten years. considering they pay 3 to 4 million for 18 the ti. some of you may think those numbers are 19 too much. some of you may think numbers like that 20 in a relationship that we have heard about are too 21 little, and that is why we trust your judgment. but 22 jackie miller, no question, was a woman who went 23 beside herself for others. 24 was there a better story than that wedding, 25 after everything she did, to have to worry about 1 two more people with a birthday cake and that 2 little girl and the corsage. does it speak volumes 3 that the man that she divorced stayed in her life 4 to the very end? 5 the court: you have three minutes. 6 mr. patacca: thank you, your honor. 7 members of the jury, you have been sworn in 8 and you are the judges of the facts, just like as 9 his honor is the judge of the law, you are the 10 judges of the fact. and i would submit today in 11 this courtroom in 2011 you are the most important 12 officials in the state of florida to these parties, 13 the most important today for us. 14 you have taken an oath and we know you will 15 abide by the oath. but for over 200 years in this 16 country, our constitutions of the united states and 17 florida have allowed for jury trials to engage in 18 these disputes and settle them. think what might 19 have been, how many happy pictures you saw there 20 from 20, 30 years ago, how many more there would 21 have been for the next 19 years. what could have 22 been if tobacco would have joined the surgeon 23 general instead of shouting over him. 24 thank you, your honor.
