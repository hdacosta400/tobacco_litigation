12 mr. mccarter: thank you, your honor. 13 good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 14 this is my last chance i have to speak to 15 you and the last chance i have to say thank you 16 on behalf of ms. arnold and me for your service 17 in this case. you were constantly paying 18 attention and note-taking and being here as our 19 jury to resolve the dispute we have between the 20 parties. 21 i also want to take the opportunity to thank 22 the folks who have helped ms. arnold and me with 23 this case, some of whom are in the courtroom but 24 other who have been stuck in the office the 25 whole time and so this is my chance to thank 1 them as well, and i'm going to do that. 2 i want to start off this morning the same 3 way i ended yesterday, and that is to talk about 4 the medical record i showed relating to 5 ms. naugle's current health status. that 6 information may have been a shock to you because 7 you had heard throughout the plaintiff's case 8 from dr. coopersmith that ms. naugle had another 9 six to ten years left. but as long as there was 10 a claim in the case for 4 million dollars in 11 future damages, you needed the information. and 12 i'm sorry if it had an emotional effect on you 13 and a shock, it is understandable if it did, 14 because it was new to you. and you may wonder 15 how do we deal with something that happens right 16 at the end of the case like that where you get 17 that news? because we are lawyers here and we 18 fight it out with one another in i think a civil 19 way, but we are also human beings. and we can 20 relate to how that must feel for you. 21 and so what i want to show you is a jury 22 instruction on how to deal with something like 23 that. and it talks about, and you know this 24 from jury selection, the need not to decide the 25 case based on emotions or sympathy. and that is 1 what i'm focused on here is sympathy. the 2 instruction, in fairness, really tells you not 3 to be a human being. and you have to be a human 4 being, but we have to do our best to set aside 5 our feelings and you have a job that we are all 6 being asked to do. 7 my job today is to share with you what the 8 evidence showed in the case and how it relates 9 to the issues you are being asked to decide on 10 the verdict form. that is my job today. the 11 case will then be handed over to you after 12 mr. uustal gets to talk to you again, and your 13 job will be to do the best you can to decide 14 this case based on the evidence and the legal 15 instructions the judge gave you and only based 16 on the evidence and the legal instructions the 17 judge gave you. and i know you are going to do 18 the best at that and that is why we all 19 appreciate your being here. 20 one thing i want to do is i -- i'm going to 21 trip over this -- i want to start now with where 22 i started off in my opening statement. because 23 i told you in my opening statement that there 24 would be some issues in this case that just are 25 not in dispute at all, and you have heard a lot 1 about these throughout the case. i'm not going 2 to cover them all. but i do want to talk to you 3 about the two bottom ones because you have heard a 4 lot about this in the evidence. i want to talk 5 about what the issues are before you. 6 because you have heard a lot about 7 philip morris over the years and different 8 tobacco companies over the years and the tobacco 9 institute and things that may have impacted the 10 public, things that did not have anything to do 11 with ms. naugle. 12 mr. uustal: your honor, i object. the last 13 one that he is talking about is improper 14 argument. you have already ruled on it. 15 the court: can you turn the board towards 16 me? 17 mr. mccarter: sure. i'm happy to put the 18 board down, judge, if it is going to cause 19 controversy. 20 the court: you can put the board down if 21 you want. you can use it if you wish. 22 mr. mccarter: well, then i'll use it. 23 the court: the objection is overruled. 24 ladies and gentlemen, what the lawyers show 25 you, what they say is argument in the case. 1 you are going to deal with the evidence in the 2 case. so stick to the evidence. 3 you may proceed, sir. 4 mr. mccarter: thank you, your honor. 5 the two issues for your decision in this 6 case relate to compensatory damages and punitive 7 damages. the issue of fault or addiction or 8 responsibility, as we have said throughout the 9 case, has been decided by the first jury. 10 the second thing is this is just 11 ms. naugle's case. and you are going to see jury 12 instructions on this. when we talk about 13 reimbursement, compensation for medical bills, 14 it is just her medical bills that are at issue. 15 in addition, when we talk about pain and 16 suffering, that type of damages, it is just about 17 her. it is not about other smokers. and that is 18 also true with respect to punitive damages. 19 you are going to see in the instructions i'll 20 show you later that the claim for punitive 21 damages is based only on the conduct that harmed 22 her. so if the conduct that you saw, much of 23 what you saw, i'd submit 99 percent of what you 24 saw were things that had nothing to do with 25 ms. naugle, that has nothing to do with punitive 1 damages. and i'm going to show you the jury 2 instructions that talk about that. 3 but this is not a class action. it is a suit 4 by one person against one defendant. 5 there is also other things now that are not 6 in dispute and i want to talk about those as 7 well. 8 and i told you at the beginning of the case 9 that on this first question on the verdict form 10 that we would agree that ms. naugle is entitled 11 to compensation for her medical bills. i said 12 that in opening statement and i say it again 13 today. and i said the only issue is how much, 14 what is the amount. and plaintiff has put in 15 evidence of the medical bills. and we agree, we 16 agree on the past medical bills, line a there, 17 that she should be awarded what they are asking 18 for, $466,389.66. 19 so when you go in the jury room, that is an 20 issue you can take off the table. and if you 21 write that down that is what you can put on the 22 verdict, both of us agree. 23 now, the future damages, when i was here in 24 opening statement i spent a lot of time on it 25 because i told you they would be asking for millions 1 and millions of dollars in future medical costs. 2 and you saw last friday that was an issue that 3 was hotly debated between the parties and you 4 saw a lot of what was being debated was 5 ms. naugle's life expectancy. and that is 6 because her medical records showed as the trial 7 began that she had been taken to the hospital 8 with the flu, influenza virus, she was in 9 critical, guarded condition. she had been 10 intubated. she was on a ventilator, and she 11 came off for a day, but she went back on. and 12 that is what the evidence in the medical records, 13 which are in evidence, will show you over that 14 period of time. that was a hotly debated issue, 15 now it is not an issue because of her current 16 condition and plaintiff withdrawing that claim 17 for 4 million dollars in future damages. it is 18 not an issue anymore. 19 and what they are asking for is $100,000 to 20 $150,000 for future medical care, and it is not 21 all future, some of it is going a little 22 backward where we do not have the medical bills. 23 and that is an issue now, now that that is the 24 claim that we agree to as well. 25 so when you get to that question b on this 1 verdict form, because she has been in the 2 hospital for almost two weeks and, you know, i 3 think the upper end of that $150,000 has some 4 hope in it that she is going to live a little 5 longer, and if it is fair to have that hope then 6 give them the upper range of that, the $150,000 7 for future damages. and you can write that in 8 as well. 9 now unfortunately that is where the agreement 10 ends between the parties. because they are 11 asking to award 6 million dollars in pain and 12 suffering. and what has happened is they took 13 that 4 million dollars that they were asking for 14 in future damages -- 15 mr. uustal: i object, your honor, that is a 16 comment on what we -- it is an improper argument 17 on how we have litigated the case, and it is not 18 true. 19 the court: do not make speaking objections. 20 mr. uustal: may i be heard on this very 21 briefly? 22 the court: come sidebar, please. 23 mr. mccarter: i can rephrase, your honor. 24 the court: strike the statement by 25 mr. mccarter. disregard the comments and he 1 will -- i'll sustain the objection and he will 2 restart. 3 mr. mccarter: they were asking for 4 4 million dollars in future damages, they are not 5 asking for that anymore. now they are asking for 6 6 million dollars in pain and suffering. so i 7 want to turn to that question on the verdict 8 form here. 9 and i say pain and suffering as shorthand 10 for the list here. but 6 million dollars is an 11 amount that is excessive, unreasonable and not 12 supported by the facts or the evidence. 13 let me start with the future. they are not 14 asking for the 6 million for future pain and 15 suffering. on that one there is no evidence of 16 ms. naugle in pain and suffering right now. 17 she is in the hospital. there is no evidence as 18 to how long she is going to live. so i think the 19 real dispute involves this 6 million dollars for 20 past pain and suffering. 21 there is no dispute that ms. naugle has 22 endured pain and suffering. there is no dispute 23 about that. none of us would want to have 24 emphysema. no one would want to go through what 25 she is gone through in the hospital the last few 1 months. no question about that. but 6 million 2 dollars, 6 million dollars is an excessive 3 amount to request and to award for pain and 4 suffering in this case. and let me start with 5 telling you why. because counsel repeatedly 6 referred to the fact that she is gone through two 7 decades of this pain and suffering. it is true 8 that she is had emphysema since 1992, so that 9 would be 21 years, but she is not had the level 10 of pain and suffering during that time period 11 that she is had more recently. in fact, you saw 12 this on one of counsel's slides. if you take 13 the period from 1992 to 1996 [sic], so the first 14 14 years of her having the condition, she was 15 able to go about her daily activities. and i'm 16 not trying to minimize her condition at all, but 17 when you are asking for 6 million dollars for two 18 decades of pain and suffering the facts are 19 important. so for 14 years she was able to go 20 about her daily activities. she did not have any 21 restrictions on what she could do. she was not 22 on supplemental oxygen. she could work a 23 full-time job, 43 hours a week. and she could 24 drive herself around and do everything else she 25 was doing before. 1 the last 7 years or so after 2006, from 2006 2 until june of this year when she went into the 3 hospital with her infection she still was able 4 to work a full-time job, but she was on oxygen. 5 so she was on supplemental oxygen since 2006, 6 but she still could go about her normal daily 7 activities. she did have the hospitalization in 8 2009, but she -- and she needed more help 9 recently with groceries, heavy things like that. 10 but if you remember what dr. singer said, he 11 said, well, she really was fine during that 12 period with the exception of that 13 hospitalization. her condition did change this 14 year because in june 2009 -- i'm sorry, june of 15 this year she went to the hospital with a 16 nocardia infection in her lungs, and that caused 17 pneumonia. and she was in the hospital for 30 18 days, which weakened her greatly. and then she 19 went into the skilled nursing facility where she 20 was for two months. they thought she was doing 21 better and she came out and then she wound up 22 getting the flu, and then went in the hospital 23 and got the mrsa infection that you saw 24 yesterday that gave her mrsa pneumonia. 25 and so the period of time we are talking 1 about for pain and suffering, it is not a 21-year 2 period of time that she is been in this 3 condition. it is really since june of this year. 4 let me also talk about what the law is on 5 pain and suffering, and you are going to get a 6 jury instruction on this. and this is important 7 because the principle here, this applies to all 8 the money they are requesting in damages, but the 9 principle here is that you should award an 10 amount of money which fairly and adequately 11 compensates ms. naugle. so this is about 12 compensating ms. naugle. it is not about 13 compensating anyone else, only about ms. naugle. 14 and also what you are told in the instructions is 15 to be fair and adequate. 16 6 million dollars, you should ask 17 yourselves, would that compensate ms. naugle? 18 that is not compensation for ms. naugle, that is 19 more than compensation for ms. naugle. nobody 20 would want to go through what she is gone through 21 but 6 million dollars is excessive. 22 now, counsel talked about pulmonary 23 rehabilitation earlier. and in my opening 24 statement i talked about pulmonary 25 rehabilitation because i said it is an issue for 1 you to consider on this question of pain and 2 suffering. now, counsel talked about it in the 3 context of the medical expenses. and while i 4 agree you could consider it in the context of 5 the medical expenses, i'm not asking you to 6 reduce those medical expenses that we talked 7 about earlier in any way because of her failure 8 to go to pulmonary rehabilitation. but when 9 you are asking for 6 million dollars in pain and 10 suffering, it is fair to ask were there things 11 that ms. naugle could have done, reasonable 12 things that might have avoided some of her pain 13 and suffering, might have reduced, mitigated 14 what she went through, and so we put in evidence 15 on pulmonary rehabilitation on that question. 16 and it is something that i would ask you to 17 consider on this question of pain and suffering. 18 and that is because, you heard this from 19 dr. singer and dr. coopersmith, but what 20 dr. singer said was something along the lines 21 of, this is the greatest thing we have going for 22 us for emphysema patients. 23 we showed you the medical records. this was 24 during dr. singer's video. you saw the medical 25 records where he had been urging ms. naugle to 1 go to pulmonary rehabilitation since 1999, so 2 for 14 years. and i want to make clear i'm not 3 being critical of ms. naugle for not going, 4 because we all have the right to decide to do 5 what we want to do. doctors tell us things all 6 the time that they say we should do or we 7 should not do, and i bet there is none of us in 8 this courtroom who ever has followed our doctors 9 advice all the time. she was free to make her 10 decisions. the reason i'm raising this is 11 because they are asking for 6 million dollars in 12 pain and suffering. 13 and what the evidence is from both 14 dr. singer and dr. coopersmith, it is really 15 undisputed, that pulmonary rehabilitation -- 16 singer wanted her to go for two hours a week. 17 it would have improved her quality of life, 18 reduced her symptoms, increased exercise 19 tolerance, reduced anxiety, reduced the risk of 20 exacerbations. exacerbations are those 21 infections that put her in the hospital and 22 really caused the problems she was having. 23 reduces the risk of hospitalizations and 24 increases life expectancy. that is not disputed. 25 this came from dr. singer and dr. coopersmith. 1 and you are entitled to consider whether, if 2 ms. naugle had done as her doctor asked, she 3 could have avoided or at least lessened some of 4 the problems that are leading to the request for 5 6 million dollars. 6 now, there was a statement earlier, and i 7 think they played a clip from dr. singer where 8 he was saying, well, he thought it was great 9 that she was going to work, and nobody is 10 criticizing her for that, but you remember what 11 dr. singer said in the medical records was that 12 it would be nice if she could take a couple 13 hours off work to go to the pulmonary rehab. so 14 obviously the work was not enough. he wanted her 15 to do a little more. 16 and i'd ask you on this issue of pain and 17 suffering, not in relation to the medical bills, 18 but on this issue of pain and suffering that you 19 consider this issue of pulmonary rehabilitation. 20 so on this question 2 what i ask you to do, 21 i'm not asking that you fill in a specific 22 amount, but the $6,000,000 request is excessive 23 and unreasonable. i'm asking you to look at the 24 evidence and use your best discretion to award 25 an amount that is reasonable in light of the 1 evidence and in light of the purpose of this 2 award, which would be to compensate, to 3 compensate ms. naugle, not compensate someone 4 else. 5 now, on this question, this is, as you know 6 from being here, the next question on the 7 verdict form relates to punitive damages. and i 8 think when you saw at the end of counsel's 9 argument that they are asking for 24 million 10 dollars, i told you what this case is about from 11 their perspective; it is about a big punitive 12 damages award, that is what they want. and 13 that is why dr. cummings was here for two and a 14 half days to testify and all their other 15 witnesses were whisked in and out as quickly as 16 possible, because what is important to them is 17 punitive damages. 18 now, this is where the real dispute in this 19 case lies. this is where dr. cummings' 20 testimony comes in and mr. jupe's testimony. 21 and you know from my opening statement i am 22 going to ask you to award zero for punitive 23 damages because by your answer to the first two 24 questions you will have fully and fairly 25 compensated ms. naugle for her injuries. and 1 for the reasons i explain in the rest of my time 2 it is simply not necessary or appropriate to 3 award more money in the form of punitive 4 damages. 5 now, i want to talk about dr. cummings for a 6 minute because he is their punitive damages 7 case. remember dr. cummings came for about two 8 hours after opening statements. he was here the 9 entire next day and the entire next day after 10 that. 11 dr. cummings goes around the state telling 12 juries like you the same story over and over and 13 over again. it does not matter who the plaintiff 14 is to him. it does not even matter who the 15 defendant is. he shows the same old ads, the 16 same documents and the same videos in every 17 case. 18 dr. cummings, you heard he is been paid more 19 than 1 million dollars to testify in these 20 cases. he might be doing his testimony here for 21 free, but he got paid for his testimony in 2009 22 in that trial. and he is been paid in scores and 23 scores of other cases, more than a million 24 dollars total. 25 dr. cummings told you he believes he is in a 1 war on tobacco and that he takes his war to the 2 courtroom because his hope is to deplete the 3 tobacco company's funds through litigation. 4 that is his goal. he told you he is rooting for a 5 punitive damages award in this case, as he does 6 in every case. and he admitted that he is a 7 biased witness. he admitted that he is biased in 8 favor of the plaintiff so he is not coming in 9 here as someone neutral. and i submit to you 10 that you can tell that from his demeanor and the 11 way he answers questions on cross-examination. 12 he is visibly perturbed and angry by the 13 questions. he often does not give straight 14 answers and the question has to be asked 15 repeatedly of him. and he changes his testimony 16 from trial to trial when he is under oath. 17 that is why we get those transcripts out from his 18 prior testimony to show that what he says is 19 different in different cases in which he 20 testifies. 21 and you saw when dr. cummings was here, he 22 got impeached, that is what we call it, 23 impeached, at least 15 times where what he said 24 to you at first was different from what he said 25 under oath to a different jury sometimes in as 1 few as two weeks ago. that is dr. cummings. he 2 is their punitive damages case. he was the only 3 one who addressed that issue for him. 4 one of the things you get to do is to 5 evaluate the credibility and bias of witnesses. 6 you have the right to accept their testimony or 7 reject it or do something in between. you have 8 the right to look at dr. cummings' testimony and 9 his demeanor on the stand and how he behaved and 10 answered questions on cross-examination and the 11 inconsistencies in his testimony from trial to 12 trial and say, you know what, i'm going to 13 reject dr. cummings' testimony. that is your 14 prerogative as jurors because you are sitting 15 here and you get to evaluate the witness. 16 so i'd ask you to keep that in mind when you 17 think about dr. cummings' testimony, think about 18 how much he is been paid, that this is a second 19 job for him, and how often he was trying to 20 change his testimony from what he said before. 21 now, there are a lot of rules that apply to 22 punitive damages. you heard those in the jury 23 instruction. so what i want to do is go through 24 some of them, because i think what you will see is 25 you have all the evidence plaintiff has shown 1 you in the case, particularly through 2 dr. cummings. what you are going to see is that 3 the rules are really going to narrow down what 4 you can consider for punitive damages. that is 5 what the instructions do. they are going to 6 narrow down to specific conduct that harmed 7 ms. naugle. and the rest of it, the rest of 8 what you have seen is going to be gone. 9 so let me start with the first one. and 10 you have seen this before, but this has the 11 complete instruction on this particular issue, 12 and that is, a prior jury found that punitive 13 damages were warranted against philip morris for 14 the conduct that harmed ms. naugle. that is the 15 first reference to the first restriction here, 16 which is to the conduct that harmed ms. naugle. 17 you are in some ways taking a baton from the 18 first jury and you are looking at the conduct 19 that harmed ms. naugle and should you award 20 punitive damages, more money for punitive 21 damages in this case. 22 but the important part from my perspective 23 is that it is in your discretion to decline to 24 award punitive damages. so this is not a 25 finding that requires you to award punitive 1 damages. it is up to you. it is up to you to 2 decide the amount, and that amount can be zero. 3 let us go to the next one. this refers to 4 the findings that resulted from the florida 5 supreme court 2006 decision. this is what you 6 were told about in the instructions. there was 7 a reference to that. and it is important to 8 distinguish between the findings made there and 9 the findings made by the first jury in this 10 case, and i'm going to do that. 11 but you were read those findings, but here's 12 the thing, for punitive damages those findings 13 are completely irrelevant. you are instructed 14 you must treat those findings as if they do not 15 exist. so those findings are taken off the 16 table for punitive damages. 17 here's another rule, and that is, this talks 18 about the findings the jury made here in 2009. 19 remember there were findings on negligence in a 20 design defect. those findings are off the table 21 for punitive damages. so again, what we are 22 seeing here is it is getting narrower and 23 narrower and narrower. 24 so what is left after the design defect and 25 negligence? well, the concealment, the finding 1 of concealment is eligible for punitive damages 2 and the finding that philip morris did acts in 3 furtherance of an agreement to conceal, that is 4 also eligible for punitive damages. but 5 negligence and issues having to do with the 6 design of the cigarettes are off the table for 7 punitive damages. 8 here's another important instruction, 9 because if you disagree with me and decide to 10 award some amount of punitive damages you should 11 know that any award must bear a reasonable 12 relationship to the amount of compensatory 13 damages. and they are asking for an enormous 14 amount of money, 26 million dollars for punitive 15 damages. but the evidence in this case is in 16 terms of her medical bills. the medical bills 17 add up to roughly $600,000. now, you also can 18 consider pain and suffering as compensatory 19 damages whatever you award, but the amount 20 they are requesting is off the charts. it is not 21 a reasonable relationship at all to any of the 22 damages that would compensate ms. naugle. and 23 so this is an important factor if you disagree 24 with me that zero is the appropriate number. 25 so talked about what is left. what is left is 1 the concealment claim and the conspiracy to 2 conceal claim. and this is the further 3 limitation here. there is two instructions on 4 this; that is, "you may not impose punitive 5 damages to punish philip morris for conduct that 6 was not shown by clear and convincing evidence 7 to have caused ms. naugle's emphysema." 8 so in other words, conduct that had nothing 9 to do with ms. naugle, statements that she did 10 not hear, advertisements she did not see, things 11 that did not impact her at all cannot be 12 considered for punitive damages. so right away 13 you have to focus on, for punitive damages, what 14 was the conduct that harmed ms. naugle, because 15 that is the only thing that may be considered for 16 punitive damages. 17 and there is evidence in this case that, you 18 know, other people have been harmed from smoking 19 and counsel talked about numbers of people who 20 have been harmed from smoking. "any award of 21 punitive damages is solely for the injury caused 22 to ms. naugle and should not," should not, 23 "include punishment for harm suffered by other 24 smokers." 25 and i'd submit to you that that is only fair 1 because ms. naugle is the only smoker in this 2 case whose facts and circumstances are before 3 you. any other smoker who is harmed and has a 4 claim can file their own case and they can seek 5 punitive damages in their own case. so this is 6 only about the harm to ms. naugle. it is only 7 about the specific conduct that harmed her. 8 it is not about anything broader than that. 9 so if i could sort of summarize what the 10 rules are. the first jury found concealment by 11 philip morris and they found that philip morris 12 did an act in furtherance of the agreement to 13 conceal which harmed ms. naugle. those are the 14 two findings by the first jury. both relate to 15 ms. naugle and both are specific to 16 philip morris. and to be eligible for punitive 17 damages it is not enough that philip morris did 18 it, it has to have been shown to harm 19 ms. naugle. and so conduct that did not injure 20 ms. naugle cannot be the basis for punitive 21 damages. that is sort of a summary of what the 22 rules that we have just gone through show. 23 now, you have seen in this case a lot of 24 evidence, a lot of evidence of conduct that 25 really had nothing to do with ms. naugle. you 1 saw it again this morning, although it was 2 whittled down from what dr. cummings showed you. 3 you saw that frank statement from december -- 4 january 1954 when ms. naugle was 5 years old. 5 she obviously did not read the newspaper and 6 understand it as a 5-year-old. there is no claim 7 she did. 8 even after i cross-examined dr. cummings 9 about this they still came back and showed you 10 advertisements from 1948 about doctors smoking 11 camels, before ms. naugle was born or when she 12 was an infant. that obviously did not harm her. 13 they showed you advertisements for the 14 philip morris brand of cigarette from the 1940s. 15 she never smoked the philip morris brand and she 16 was an infant or not even alive yet at the time. 17 they showed you videos from people from the 18 tobacco institute. there is no evidence 19 ms. naugle ever heard any of those. 20 they showed you the rj reynolds executive on 21 the ted koppel nightline show. there is no 22 evidence that she saw that. 23 they showed you again that testimony from 24 1994, the tobacco executives testifying before 25 congress, that also could not have harmed 1 ms. naugle because she already had emphysema by 2 then and she had quit smoking. she did not start 3 back up after hearing that testimony. so that 4 has nothing to do with ms. naugle as well. 5 so i submit to you that the questions you 6 need to ask yourselves in regard to this claim 7 for punitive damages to really figure out what is 8 at issue are things like, well, what was it that 9 was concealed from ms. naugle? when was it 10 concealed from her? what are the facts and 11 circumstances relating to it? 12 and we are in 2013 now. it is not the 1950s 13 or '60s or '70s or '80s or '90s. is there a 14 need today in 2013 to award additional money in 15 the form of punitive damages? 16 and so the first thing we need to talk about 17 is ms. naugle's smoking, because you have to 18 figure out, again, what was it that impacted 19 her. and we have gone through this in the case, 20 but here are some important points to consider 21 on ms. naugle's smoking. the first is that she 22 started smoking as an adult. and that is on 23 there because it was legal for her to smoke and 24 it was legal for philip morris to sell 25 cigarettes to her. it was legal for 1 philip morris to sell those longer cigarettes to 2 her as well. all of that was legal. 3 you heard the story about how she started 4 smoking that one night in a nightclub when she 5 was 20 years old with her friend and they wanted 6 to look older and more sophisticated because 7 they were underage at the time for drinking and 8 they went to the vending machine and bought 9 benson & hedges. well, what was it about that 10 purchase of benson & hedges that had to do with 11 something wrong that philip morris did? is that 12 what caused her to start smoking, the fact that 13 there were benson & hedges in the machine? 14 submit the answer is no, because if there 15 were not any benson & hedges she would have 16 smoked something else then. and she would have 17 smoked anyway. well, why did she smoke 18 benson & hedges? because they looked elegant 19 and they were feminine, that is it, that is why 20 she picked that brand. 21 remember dr. cummings went through some 22 marketing memos with you in which the people 23 said, hey, our advertising is working. people 24 view this as elegant and feminine. well, 25 there is nothing unlawful or illegal about that. 1 it was legal for philip morris to market 2 cigarettes in a way that may have appealed to 3 women, that they were feminine or elegant. 4 there was nothing illegal about that. 5 when she started smoking, ms. naugle also 6 knew it could be hard to quit. 7 now, we have her testimony here. this is 8 what you heard read in when dr. cummings was 9 here. "setting aside 'addicted,' that term," 10 because she said she had not heard it was 11 addictive at the time. talk about that in a few 12 minutes. 13 "before you started smoking in 1968, did you 14 already have an understanding that smoking could 15 be a hard habit to break?" 16 and she said, "i did not know." and then 17 she said, "oh yes, i did." and she knew because 18 she had watched her father try to quit smoking, 19 so she knew that once you get started it could 20 be hard to quit. she knew that before she had 21 her first cigarette. 22 by 1970, so for 23 of the 25 years she 23 smoked, ms. naugle believed, she believed 24 smoking was harmful for her. again, this is her 25 testimony. 1 "you said about 1970. we have established 2 that back in 1970 you knew smoking was bad for 3 your health. 4 "yes." 5 that was her testimony. she may not have 6 known it the first two years of her smoking, but 7 for the next 23 years she testified she knew it. 8 she also had personal family experiences 9 that educated her about the risks of smoking. 10 you heard this from her brother jim naugle. jim 11 naugle was here going through some of the things 12 she has to deal with in her copd. and you 13 remember he said he is friends with mr. uustal. 14 and mr. naugle, jim naugle, was the guy who 15 suggested to his sister that she file this 16 lawsuit. and even he admitted that by 1976 it 17 had become family knowledge that smoking was 18 harmful as a result of his father's heart 19 attack. so that is family knowledge that 20 ms. naugle had as well. 21 and finally, ms. naugle was warned of the 22 very disease she would get, emphysema, seven 23 years before she got it. and you may recall 24 that when she was diagnosed with emphysema by 25 dr. molinet she was not surprised about it 1 because she had seen emphysema on the pack seven 2 years earlier. 3 so that has to do with ms. naugle's smoking. 4 and the question is in light of the facts and 5 circumstances of the evidence in this case, 6 after you have already compensated her fully and 7 fairly is it necessary to award more money in 8 the form of punitive damages? and i submit the 9 answer is no. and there are several reasons for 10 it. 11 the first is that it was, i mentioned this 12 earlier, but it was legal for philip morris to 13 market benson & hedges to an adult like 14 ms. naugle in a way that made the cigarettes 15 elegant and feminine. and there is going to be a 16 jury instruction you will get on this, but this is 17 it. "the manufacture, advertisement and sale of 18 cigarettes are lawful activities." 19 so what philip morris did in regards to the 20 benson & hedges in 1968, the ones she smoked, 21 philip morris advertised the cigarettes, 22 marketed them and sold them to an adult, 23 perfectly legal to do. and that is in the jury 24 instructions. 25 you will also see in the jury instructions 1 that after 1969 they cannot claim that the 2 advertising somehow neutralized the cigarette 3 warnings by making smoking look glamourous. you 4 heard a lot about that from dr. cummings, that 5 the companies continued to advertise their 6 cigarettes, not philip morris, philip morris 7 does not advertise in magazines anymore. but 8 dr. cummings talked about this and you should 9 know there can be no claim in this case for 10 punitive damages because philip morris 11 advertised the cigarettes as glamourous or 12 elegant or anything like that after 1969. 13 second, and i'd submit to you this is the 14 most important piece of evidence relating to 15 punitive damages. i submit to you it is the most 16 important, and that is the warnings. 17 now, i think the size of my boards were made 18 fun of this morning, but obviously i was not 19 suggesting to you that the warning on the 20 cigarette pack is this big. this is so you all 21 can see it. 22 this first warning was on the pack of 23 cigarettes ms. naugle got that night from the 24 vending machine when she was 20 years old. 25 "cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your 1 health." 2 it was on every cigarette she smoked up 3 until 1970. 4 now, there was a suggestion this morning 5 that ms. naugle, you know, the warning is so 6 small she might not have seen it. there is no 7 need to speculate about this because ms. naugle 8 testified that she knew this warning was on the 9 first pack of benson & hedges she purchased. 10 she knew the warning was on there. she did say 11 it said may be hazardous and so that caused her 12 to question it, but she knew the warning was on 13 there. there is no doubt about it. and 14 philip morris followed the law and put this 15 warning on the packs of cigarettes it made from 16 '66 to '70. 17 now, it is this next warning from 1970 to 18 1985 that led ms. naugle to say, you know what, 19 starting in 1970 when the "may be" was taken 20 off, that is when i knew, that is when i believed 21 smoking was bad for my health, starting in 1970. 22 and this warning was the one she said gave her 23 that message. this warning, philip morris put 24 it on every package of cigarettes ms. naugle 25 smoked from 1970 to 1985. they followed the law 1 and put the warning on as the law required, in 2 the language, in the language congress required. 3 so the suggestion that philip morris by the 4 way that this message was intended to convey, 5 this warning was intended to convey 6 philip morris' message, congress is the one who 7 sets the language on the warning, not 8 philip morris. congress set the warning in 1966 9 and again in 1970. 10 and then from 1985 on, including today, 11 these four warnings have been on, one of them 12 has been on every package of cigarettes 13 philip morris has sold in the united states. i 14 know you know this, but there is the reference to 15 emphysema on there. ms. naugle is being warned 16 of the disease she would get seven years before 17 she would get it. this is why she said to her 18 doctor when she was diagnosed, i'm not surprised 19 that i have emphysema because i saw it on the 20 pack seven years ago. 21 these are important in the case because what 22 they are asking you to do is to impose millions 23 of dollars in punitive damages because 24 philip morris concealed information from 25 ms. naugle while at the same time philip morris 1 put these warnings on every pack. that is why 2 it is important. every package of cigarettes she 3 ever smoked in her life had a warning on it. 4 and this is important as well, this is 5 another instruction; that is, after july 1st, 6 1969 philip morris had no obligation under the 7 law to put different or additional warnings on 8 its cigarettes than these. so by putting these 9 warnings on its pack and it is undisputed 10 philip morris did it at all times, philip morris 11 had no obligation to put something different on 12 there or something more on there and that is the 13 law you have been instructed on. 14 the other thing is, while information -- the 15 jury found information was concealed from 16 ms. naugle, information about nicotine and 17 addiction and the health risks of smoking have 18 been common knowledge for decades. and 19 plaintiff's counsel seemed to agree with this 20 point this morning; and that is, there is been a 21 lot of information out there for a long, long 22 time about nicotine and addiction and the health 23 risks of smoke. i spent some time going through 24 this with dr. cummings. and i'm not going to 25 spend nearly as much time on it today. 1 but here are some of the things you saw 2 during the cross-examination of dr. cummings, 3 going all the way back to christopher columbus 4 and the fact that his shipmates could not quit 5 tobacco even when their captain was telling them 6 to stop, ordering them to stop, they said they 7 could not do it, they were unable to quit. so 8 that is the first european experience with 9 tobacco, and coming out of that experience is 10 the message that once you start on tobacco it is 11 hard to quit. 12 john quincy adams talked about being 13 addicted to smoking and also i think chewing 14 tobacco. and he talked about smoking, if people 15 just stopped using tobacco there would be an 16 increase in longevity, a recognition that 17 tobacco use cuts short people's lives. 18 you heard about mark twain quipping about 19 quitting smoking is the easiest thing he is ever 20 done, he is done it thousands of times in the 21 1800s. 22 the florida health notes talked about 23 cigarettes being the very worst form of 24 addiction. 25 reader's digest over the years talked about 1 nicotine being a drug and the reason why people 2 smoke and smoking being addictive. 3 that is all in the public domain, not 4 scientific journals, in the public domain. 5 now, i've put on here the '64 surgeon 6 general's report and the 1988 surgeon general's 7 report, and that is because you, as you know from 8 the evidence, there was a scientific debate 9 starting in 1964 about do you call smoking an 10 addiction or do you call it a habit? 11 in 1964 the surgeon general said it is not an 12 addiction, it is a habit. and the surgeon 13 general said that because at the time 14 intoxication was part of the scientific 15 definition of addiction. remember that? 16 and then in 1988 the surgeon general said, 17 we are going to use a different definition of 18 addiction, it is not going to include 19 intoxication and therefore they changed the 20 ruling from '64 and said it does meet the 21 scientific definition of addiction. 22 before 1988 even dr. cummings admitted he is 23 not aware of any statement by philip morris 24 disputing that cigarette smoking was addictive. 25 it just was not an issue. and he is not aware of 1 any statement at any time by anyone from 2 philip morris denying or disputing that it can 3 be hard to quit smoking. they never did that. 4 the debate on addiction was limited to 12 5 years after 1988, and the debate was over the 6 scientific definition of addiction and whether 7 cigarettes should be lumped together with heroin 8 and crack cocaine. and philip morris took the 9 position that it was not fair to lump their 10 product and their customers together with people 11 who use those hard illegal drugs. that was the 12 nature of the debate at that time. 13 now, that was on nicotine and addiction, 14 what was out in the public. 15 remember with dr. cummings we started with 16 the vincent van gogh painting up there, and 17 again the florida health notes referred to 18 cigarettes as coffin nails back in 1912. 19 and you may recall that dr. cummings made 20 statements about this american blend cigarette 21 that was invented in 1913, and he suggested to 22 you that it was the american blend cigarette 23 that really made cigarettes inhalable, really 24 made them addictive, made them harmful. but he 25 had to admit that even before then, when 1 cigarettes were made out of turkish tobacco, 2 they caused cancer, and people knew that, they 3 were inhalable and they were addictive. and 4 there were references historically to all of 5 those facts, so much so that even before the 6 american blend is invented the florida health 7 notes are calling cigarettes addictive and 8 coffin nails. 9 you heard about the reader's digest 10 articles, the reference in time magazine to 11 coffin nails based on a study showing that 12 smokers were dying earlier than nonsmokers. 13 life magazine, down in the lower right 14 corner, that is the mouse skin-painting studies 15 you heard about by dr. wynder. 16 and then of course you have the '64 surgeon 17 general's report, the coverage of that report 18 right here in fort lauderdale. and the warnings 19 on the pack. all of that information plus was 20 out in the public domain before and during 21 ms. naugle's life. 22 and so the question is, well, it is out 23 there, did people get the message? and you 24 heard this when dr. cummings was here. by 1954 25 ninety percent of the american public had heard or 1 read that smoking may be a cause of lung cancer. 2 that is 1954. 3 1969, you remember dr. cummings said, you 4 know, there is a difference between hearing and 5 believing and he gave the example of aliens 6 ufos. but by 1969 71 percent of adults 7 believed, they believed, not just hearing it, 8 but believed that smoking causes lung cancer. 9 81 percent believed it in 1978. 10 by 1985 95 percent agreed with the 11 statement. 12 and even on emphysema, when the warning went 13 on the pack, 91 percent of people agreed that 14 smoking causes emphysema. 15 did people act on that message? was it an 16 important enough message to folks that they 17 acted on it? the answer to that question is yes 18 as well. 19 1965, this is after the surgeon general's 20 report, 17 million smokers had quit smoking in 21 1965. in the four years after that 13 million 22 more people quit smoking. and by 1985 more than 23 40 million smokers had quit. and the importance 24 of that, the importance of that is it means the 25 message is getting across to such an extent that 1 people are acting on the message. 2 and by 1985 when those warnings, the last 3 set of warnings went on the pack, more than 40 4 million americans had acted on that public 5 health message and quit smoking. 6 and you have seen this a couple of times, i 7 think actually three times during trial. this 8 is the year ms. naugle started smoking. and 9 dr. daniel horn, working for the national 10 clearinghouse on smoking and health said, "you 11 could stand on a rooftop and shout 'smoking is 12 dangerous' at the top of your lungs and you 13 would not be telling anyone anything they did 14 not already know." 15 that is the same year ms. naugle started 16 smoking. 17 another factor to consider on this issue of 18 punitive damages is, well, you heard the public 19 statements by philip morris, but what was 20 philip morris trying to do, what were they 21 doing. were they just standing pat, or were 22 they going out there spending money, devoting 23 resources to try to make cigarettes less 24 hazardous? 25 and you heard about those efforts when 1 dr. cummings was here on cross-examination and 2 you heard about it when mr. jupe was here as 3 well. the fact is is that philip morris tried 4 for decades and continues to try to reduce the 5 health risks of smoking. 6 i want to stop there for a second, because 7 you heard testimony about where does the harm 8 from smoking, where does the addiction come 9 from. and the answer you heard in the evidence, 10 well, the nicotine in the cigarettes comes from 11 the tobacco as it is growing in the filed. as 12 the tobacco ages and gets manufactured, there is 13 actually less nicotine in the cigarette that 14 philip morris sells than was in the tobacco 15 growing in the field. it evaporates, it gets 16 cut out and other things. 17 the nicotine comes from tobacco naturally 18 and that is why christopher columbus' sailors had 19 a hard time quitting. they were not using 20 manufactured cigarettes. they were using 21 natural tobacco. 22 what about the harm from smoking, where does 23 that come from? well, you have heard that there 24 are thousands of chemicals in a raw tobacco leaf 25 growing in the field and that when that leaf is 1 burned, in fact, when any organic matter is 2 burned, the act of burning causes chemical 3 reactions that produce even more chemicals, 4 thousands of chemicals. and among the chemicals 5 that are produced when you burn tobacco are 6 dozens of carcinogens. so the harm comes from 7 the burning of tobacco. 8 now, philip morris, you know, uses additives 9 in their cigarettes. and a lot of people might 10 come into cases like this, i think you heard 11 discussion in jury selection where people think 12 it is the additives, not the tobacco, but the 13 additives that are causing the disease. 14 mr. jupe described how philip morris has 15 tested all of the additives they use. they have 16 disclosed the additives to the federal 17 government. they have put the additives on their 18 website. and they have published all the research 19 they have done on additives. and their research 20 shows that additives do not add to the harm 21 caused by burning tobacco. it is the burning of 22 tobacco, not the additives. we showed you a 23 copy of the journal where philip morris 24 published its research on that issue. 25 how about these allegations that ammonia is 1 used to make the cigarettes more addictive? 2 that is what dr. cummings said, but he did not 3 actually talk about any studies that showed it. 4 mr. jupe described a study that philip morris, 5 his colleagues there have recently done where 6 they had people smoke cigarettes with ammonia 7 and cigarettes without and they had the people 8 hooked up to something taking their blood from 9 their arteries every second and what the 10 research showed was ammonia has no impact on the 11 speed of which nicotine is delivered to the 12 body. and that stands unrebutted. 13 there are also issues relating to 14 reconstituted tobacco you heard about in trial. 15 dr. cummings referred to it as adding nicotine 16 to the tobacco. what you heard is that the 17 process, the tobacco is put in liquid, those 18 stems, and some nicotine remains in the solid 19 part, some nicotine goes in the liquid part and 20 then it is all recombined at the end. but no 21 nicotine is added, it is just the nicotine that 22 was in there before. 23 and there was a question about, well, can 24 you put in less nicotine? can you take nicotine 25 out that way? right. can you take nicotine 1 out? 2 and mr. jupe said, yes, when we combine it, 3 we do not have to put in all the stuff that was 4 there originally, but it has an impact on the 5 taste of the cigarettes. it has an impact on 6 the taste of the cigarettes. i mean, an example 7 would be the difference between the taste of 8 alcoholic and nonalcoholic beers. alcohol has 9 an impact on taste of beer or wine. nicotine 10 has an impact on the taste of a cigarette. so 11 mr. jupe explained how that works. 12 so i started off talking about 13 philip morris' efforts to reduce the health 14 risks of smoking over the years, and it is gone 15 on for 60 years. it started in the 1950s and 16 you saw this that dr. wynder in 1957 recommended 17 that the tobacco companies reduce the tar levels 18 of their cigarettes. and he hypothesized that 19 doing so would reduce the risk of lung cancer. 20 and we showed you this, and mr. jupe 21 described for you how philip morris responded to 22 that. philip morris responded by implementing 23 all these design changes, the filter, expanded 24 tobacco, reconstituted tobacco, ventilation, 25 porous paper. he walked through that with you. 1 and this chart shows the really massive 2 effect those design features have had on 3 reducing tar and nicotine. if you go back to 4 1955, before cigarettes were filtered or before 5 filtered cigarettes were popular, the tar was 38 6 milligrams. and it is down to about 12 as of the 7 mid '90s. and nicotine has been reduced as 8 well. so these design features had an effect on 9 reducing tar and nicotine just like dr. wynder 10 recommended in the 1950s. 11 i'm going to -- i brought our timeline that 12 we showed during the direct examination of 13 mr. jupe just to give you a sense as to some of 14 the things that were happening during the next 15 40 years with regard to filtered cigarettes 16 after dr. wynder made that recommendation. and 17 you have seen all of these. but you saw the 18 public health service talking about filtered 19 cigarettes being safer in the 1960s. you heard 20 in 1968 about the first real study that came out 21 from dr. cummings' former employer, scientists 22 there, finding that, just as dr. wynder had 23 predicted, if you lower the tar by forty percent 24 you are going to lower lung cancer by forty percent. 25 and they found that people who smoked filtered 1 cigarettes had a forty percent less risk of lung 2 cancer. so the filters were working. 3 we saw references where the public health is 4 recommending that people smoke filtered 5 cigarettes. that is the cartoon with the guy 6 walking over the circling sharks. 7 you know, yesterday mr. jupe was 8 cross-examined with a document that supposedly 9 showed philip morris' internal knowledge, that 10 philip morris knew in 1973 that the filters 11 were not working. talked about the moral 12 obligation. and i got to show you other parts 13 of the document on my redirect. and what you 14 saw was that philip morris scientists were 15 saying, we do not need to tell the ftc that 16 people are not getting the same amount of smoke 17 the ftc test is measuring because we told the 18 ftc that and they knew it a few years earlier 19 when they were adopting the test. that is what 20 that was about. it was not about some secret 21 knowledge by philip morris that filters and low 22 tar were not working. and you saw that 23 yesterday. 24 you saw how philip morris worked with the 25 national cancer institute in 1976 to find ways 1 to reduce the risk of smoking and that the 2 national cancer institute's group recommended 3 all of those design features that philip morris 4 used over the years. 5 you saw the 1981 surgeon general's report 6 where they talked about filters reducing the 7 risk. you saw that again in 1996. but we also 8 showed you where the public health community 9 started to change their mind in 2001. 10 2001 the national cancer institute said, you 11 know what, filters may not be reducing the 12 risks. it does not appear that filters and 13 low-tar cigarettes are any safer. and we showed 14 that to you as well. and then you saw that 15 was not the last word on it because the world 16 health organization weighed in afterwards. the 17 surgeon general did as well. 18 and the last -- one thing we showed was in 19 2012, this is the world health organization 20 monograph, their conclusion was that the risk of 21 smoking was higher among men and women who 22 smoked high-tar nonfiltered brands. that is what 23 they concluded in 2012, that filters were, in 24 fact, reducing the risk. 25 now, there is a scientific debate on this. 1 there is no question about it. there are 2 credible, respected organizations on both sides 3 of the issue. you have the surgeon general on 4 one side, the world health organization on 5 another. and this issue whether filters really, 6 really, really are safer, may be it will not be 7 resolved for a number of years as the science 8 evolves, but the point is that when 9 philip morris was marketing filtered cigarettes 10 and marketing low-tar cigarettes the science was 11 showing that they were, in fact, reducing the 12 health risks. 13 and what did philip morris do when the 14 national cancer institute suggested maybe 15 filters are not working? what did philip morris 16 do? what would you want them to do? what would 17 you expect them to do? you would expect them to 18 give that information to their consumers, and 19 that is exactly what philip morris did. 20 you saw this when dr. cummings was here. 21 starting in 2002, a year after that nci 22 monograph, philip morris put these onserts on 23 every pack of low-tar and light cigarettes and 24 they told philip morris customers that low-tar 25 cigarettes may not be safer, that you should not 1 assume they are safer. philip morris gave its 2 consumers, not philip morris' message that 3 filters are safer, which is the company's 4 belief, they gave the more conservative public 5 health message that you should not assume 6 they are safer to make sure that people were not 7 keeping smoking under something that could be a 8 miscomprehension. philip morris provided that 9 information to all of its low-tar and light 10 smokers in 2002. 11 you know, there was testimony and a question 12 from one of you about e-cigarettes, and so when 13 mr. jupe was here we got into that. and he 14 explained that philip morris has a sister 15 company who markets e-cigarettes today and how 16 that is really a new developing market. but he 17 also talked about what philip morris tried to do 18 starting in the '80s, to develop a cigarette, an 19 alternative to a conventional cigarette that 20 would reduce the health risks. and the 21 cigarette was accord. you got to see what it 22 looked like. it looked like a '90s cell phone 23 that you put a cigarette into and you have to 24 hold it up and smoke. and, you know, i guess at 25 the time people thought somebody would like 1 that, but i think it is pretty clear in 2 retrospect that that is just not something people 3 are interested in. 4 accord did work to reduce the hazardous 5 chemicals in the smoke, and it took 20 years of 6 research and development to do it and millions 7 and millions and millions of dollars. and 8 philip morris test marketed and it was a flop. 9 but that is what happens. not every research is 10 going to lead to success. 11 philip morris also tried making these brands 12 of cigarettes without nicotine. when 13 dr. cummings was here, he fought me on the issue 14 of, well, philip morris started this process 15 after they bought general foods. 16 i think i was standing right over here. and 17 i said, dr. cummings, they bought general foods, 18 they got the technology to develop sanka and 19 they took that decaf coffee technology and 20 applied it to cigarettes. 21 and he fought and fought and fought and then 22 we read him what he had actually testified to 23 just earlier under oath in a different case. 24 you heard from mr. jupe this story that they 25 did take that process for making decaf coffee 1 and they saw, can we apply it to tobacco? 2 because what they had tried earlier, removing 3 nicotine by putting ammonia on there or other 4 heavy chemicals, is that it shredded the tobacco 5 and you could not use the tobacco. it ruined the 6 taste. so this was something new and they spent 7 400 million dollars on it. they built a new 8 factory. and they put these cigarettes in test 9 market. 10 dr. cummings said, well, these were highly 11 successful products. that is what he said. they 12 were a flop. they tasted awful. people did not 13 want to smoke them. 14 and ask yourselves, does it make any sense 15 that philip morris would spend 400 million 16 dollars to develop a cigarette without nicotine 17 and it is highly successful, meaning they are 18 selling it and making money off of it, does it 19 make any sense that they would then take it off 20 the market? why go through the trouble in the 21 first place? 22 the fact is is that people did not want to 23 smoke those cigarettes. whether it was because 24 they did not want to smoke a cigarette without 25 nicotine or whether it was because they tasted 1 lousy, no way to tell. they certainly reported 2 that the cigarettes tasted lousy. and 3 philip morris also -- eventually had to take 4 them off the market. but they tried. they 5 spent 400 million dollars trying. 6 this is the criticism, one of the criticisms 7 for what philip morris is doing today. one of 8 the criticisms is, hey, you ought to sell 9 cigarettes that do not have nicotine in them. 10 philip morris tried that. they put in a lot of 11 money, put in a lot of research, they put those 12 cigarettes in test market and nobody wanted to 13 smoke them. they tried it, it did not work. 14 now, on this issue of reducing the risks of 15 smoking, i do want to talk about this flip 16 chart, which is admittedly, and i'm partially to 17 blame for this, it is admittedly become a 18 sideshow in this trial. 19 so there is an article earlier this year in 20 january, does not cite any tobacco company 21 documents, you are not talking about things that 22 philip morris had knowledge of before january of 23 this year, that shows that the risk of 24 cigarettes -- risk of emphysema, copd from 25 smoking has increased over time, the relative 1 risk. that is what the article says. and then 2 the author says, well, we cannot explain it, but 3 here's a plausible explanation. it may be 4 because of the change in the design of 5 cigarettes. may be, plausible, unexplained. 6 that is the language in the article. 7 dr. cummings then comes in here and says, not 8 that it is plausible, not that it is may be, not 9 that it is unexplained, he says, yeah, it is the 10 change in the design of cigarettes. they added 11 filters and it is making more people get copd 12 today than before. 13 that is not what the article showed. but 14 that is how this became an issue is dr. cummings 15 went beyond the article and expressed his view 16 that my client and the other tobacco companies 17 are making cigarettes more dangerous. 18 and so you saw this. but remember, this 19 is -- cdc says there is no increase from death 20 rates from copd over the last 10 years, during 21 that 10-year window. now, it is been said, well, 22 that 10-year window is after the 10-year window 23 the plaintiffs are talking about. the point is 24 dr. cummings' theory, if dr. cummings is right 25 that it is the cigarettes that are making copd 1 rates go up, they should keep going up, right? 2 people are still smoking those cigarettes. 3 that is the point. the fact that copd rates are 4 not increasing most recently shows that what 5 dr. cummings is saying is just wrong. and 6 that is why the authors did not go that far. they 7 said it was unexplained. 8 we even got to the point of talking about 9 what dr. thun had written before he wrote that 10 article. of course in 2004 he said filters 11 reduce the risk of lung cancer, and we showed 12 you that article. and then when mr. jupe was 13 here on redirect you heard what dr. thun has 14 been saying even since he wrote that article. 15 now, if dr. cummings is right that the study 16 shows that filters make the cigarettes more 17 dangerous, that is what dr. thun would be saying 18 after he wrote the article. but what dr. thun 19 said after he wrote the article in april of this 20 year, so three months after the article, he said 21 he still believes filters reduce the risk of 22 lung cancer. 23 so what you have, i have 2004 on here, you 24 can put the same statement for 2013, and the 25 point is is that it brackets, those two 1 statements bracket this january 2013 article. 2 so it is obvious that even the author of the 3 article does not believe filters have made the 4 cigarettes more dangerous. 5 now, i went into roll-your-own cigarettes 6 with dr. cummings because roll-your-own 7 cigarettes tend to be cigarettes that do not have 8 a filter on them, right. so if you want to know 9 are the filters making cigarettes more 10 dangerous, like dr. cummings said -- he is the 11 only one who said it, not the authors -- compare 12 factory-made cigarettes to roll-your-own 13 cigarettes and see which have higher rates of 14 lung cancer. 15 you know who is done that? dr. cummings. 16 just last year he did that research. and you 17 saw his article. and in his article 18 dr. cummings said, if anything the roll-your-own 19 cigarettes are more dangerous than factory-made 20 cigarettes. and so he is written as recently as 21 last year that the things philip morris and the 22 other companies have done have made the 23 cigarettes less dangerous. less dangerous 24 compare to roll-your-own cigarettes that do not 25 have those design changes. that is why that was 1 important. 2 and of course we showed you what the world 3 health organization says. and here's the -- you 4 know, if you want to know what dr. cummings 5 really believes on this issue not what he said 6 here, what does he do when he makes cigarettes? 7 what does he do when he makes cigarettes? and 8 he makes them for people to smoke in 9 experiments. he puts a filter on them. he 10 does not make people smoke unfiltered cigarettes. 11 and whose filter does he put on there? he said 12 he puts a philip morris filter on there. that 13 tells you all you need to know about 14 dr. cummings' claim, which the authors of the 15 article did not make that my client is making 16 cigarettes more dangerous. and that is why we 17 spent so time on it because it is an outrageous 18 claim and it is not supported by dr. cummings' 19 research and the authors of the article do not 20 believe it either. 21 you know, dr. cummings also testified and 22 you heard it this morning, you heard about this 23 smoking cessation newsletter that merrell dow 24 put out when they were selling nicorette. i 25 think the allegation has been that smoking 1 cessation newsletter would have told doctors 2 about nicotine replacement therapy. 3 well, i asked dr. cummings this, this was on 4 recross i was allowed to ask a couple more 5 questions. i asked him, does that newsletter, 6 the one philip morris supposedly suppressed, 7 does it even mention nicotine replacement 8 therapy? and he said, no, it does not discuss 9 nicotine replacement therapy. 10 that is their own witness' testimony who is 11 making this claim about dow nicorette gum being 12 suppressed and information about it being 13 suppressed. well, was the newsletter 14 suppressed? did philip morris keep that 15 newsletter from reaching doctors? i asked 16 dr. cummings that too, because he wrote in the 17 surgeon general's report not what he testified 18 here until i asked him, he wrote that that 19 newsletter was sent out to 450,000 doctors. how 20 many doctors are there in the united states? 21 450,000? whatever it is, that newsletter got 22 out, it got out to hundreds of thousands of 23 doctors. so the testimony you heard from 24 dr. cummings and the claim that there was some 25 suppression of nicotine, this newsletter talking 1 about nicorette is just false. the newsletter 2 did not talk about nicorette and it went out to 3 hundreds of thousands of doctors. 4 the last thing i want to talk about is this. 5 and this is -- i'm going to show you some jury 6 instructions on this. this is common sense, i 7 submit to you this is common sense. the 8 question whether today in 2013 you need to 9 impose punitive damages and award additional 10 money in punitive damages for things that 11 happened a long, long time ago. and this is the 12 last thing i want to talk about. 13 one of the instructions you got is that 14 you are allowed to take into account mitigating 15 evidence when considering punitive damages. 16 mitigating evidence is evidence that may 17 demonstrate that there is no need for punitive 18 damages today in 2013 or that there is not as 19 much a need as the plaintiff is saying. that is 20 what mitigation evidence is. 21 and this board right here goes directly to 22 that issue. because you have heard in the 23 testimony that -- you heard the evidence that by 24 1970 -- by 1968 ms. naugle knew it could be hard 25 to quit smoking and by 1970 she personally 1 believed smoking was bad for her health. and so 2 concealment about the health risks of smoking 3 and addiction we do not know exactly what the 4 jury found, but the evidence is that it was a 5 long time ago with respect to ms. naugle and it 6 was in the 1960s. and when you think about 7 whether punitive damages are necessary or 8 appropriate today in 2013 keep in mind that 9 we are 40 or 45 years later. and keep in mind 10 please, please keep in mind everything that has 11 happened since then. that there is been no 12 television or radio advertising for cigarettes 13 for 42 years. for 42 years. there is some of us 14 in the courtroom here who have never seen a 15 cigarette advertisement or radio advertisement. 16 it was a long time ago. 17 there is been warnings on the print ads for 18 41 years. the same warning on the packs have 19 been on the advertisements. 20 ingredients have been disclosed to the 21 federal government since 1986. philip morris 22 has put the ingredients on its website for 23 people to see since 2000. 24 in 1998, and i'm going to spend some time on 25 this, there were all those lawsuits by the state 1 attorneys general. everyone, every attorney 2 general was going after philip morris and the 3 other tobacco companies. and that led to a 4 monumental shift in restrictions on cigarette 5 advertising and, quite frankly, it led to a 6 monumental shift in the behavior of the tobacco 7 companies. because when you have every state 8 attorney general suing you, it sends a pretty 9 strong message. 10 and philip morris and the other tobacco 11 companies settled those lawsuits. and you heard 12 about how those settlements restrict the 13 cigarette marketing. you heard about all the 14 documents that got disclosed and still are on 15 the philip morris website. you heard about how 16 much money philip morris has had to pay to the 17 states because of it. and let me just -- these 18 are the restrictions on philip morris' marketing 19 and advertising before the master settlement 20 agreement, then the restrictions in 1998. and 21 here's something philip morris has done above 22 and beyond what they are required to do. people 23 are concerned about magazine advertising for 24 cigarettes. they are concerned kids can see 25 those ads. and starting in 2005 philip morris 1 took its ads out of magazines voluntarily. its 2 competitors continue to advertise in magazines, 3 but philip morris does not do it. 4 at some point, at some point enough is 5 enough, is not it? because philip morris settled 6 those lawsuits and they have paid an enormous 7 amount of money. since 1997 they have paid over 8 62 billion dollars to the states. florida alone 9 has received 4 billion dollars. this has been 10 going on from 1997 forward. and it is going to 11 continue forever, philip morris has to continue 12 paying this money and having those restrictions 13 on its advertising and marketing for as long as 14 philip morris exists. 15 and so in terms of mitigation i'd ask you to 16 consider the restrictions on philip morris today 17 and also just the incredible amount of money 18 philip morris has been required to pay to the 19 states in these cases. and you know from other 20 testimony, other lawsuits out there, you know 21 dr. cummings has testified more than a hundred 22 cases. so at some point enough is enough. 23 in this case you are going to, you will 24 fairly and fully compensate ms. naugle for her 25 injuries. and on this claim for additional 1 money on punitive damages i'd submit to you the 2 answer should be zero. it should be zero for 3 all the reasons talked about, all these 4 restrictions on the company's business today. 5 but just as important as the master 6 settlement agreement is what philip morris has 7 done to change itself. 8 starting in the fall of 2000 there was no 9 more fighting, there was no more debating, no 10 more disputing that smoking caused lung cancer. 11 philip morris aligned itself with the public 12 health community 13 years ago and put on its 13 website an agreement that smoking causes lung 14 cancer and other serious diseases. 15 philip morris also stopped fighting about 16 addiction. there was the 12-year fight on 17 addiction and philip morris stopped that as 18 well. that we agree. 19 and now you heard philip morris speaks, even 20 where philip morris disagrees on issues like 21 filtered cigarettes with the surgeon general, 22 philip morris defers and says to the public, 23 listen to the public health community. we are 24 not going to say anything publicly that disputes 25 the public health community message. if that is 1 not a change, that is not a change from what you 2 saw in the '50s, '60s, '70s, that is as big a 3 change as you possibly could make in terms of 4 the information that you are providing. it is a 5 shift 180 degrees. it happened in 2000 and 6 we are 13 years later now. 7 philip morris also supported regulation of 8 the cigarette industry by the food and drug 9 administration. for a decade before the law was 10 passed philip morris supported it. and you 11 heard the law grants regulatory control over 12 cigarettes, regulates advertising, marketing and 13 labeling. the fda gets to look at the tobacco 14 company documents. they do surprise inspections 15 of philip morris. and mr. jupe told you about 16 that, how the fda came unannounced and did its 17 inspection and how he worked with the fda 18 answering questions and guiding their inspection 19 of the facilities. they looked at the 20 factories. they looked at the filters. they 21 looked at the additives. and they did not find 22 any noncompliance with the regulation. 23 even during the government shutdown the fda 24 continues to operate because it is paid for not 25 by taxpayers, but it is paid for by the tobacco 1 companies. and you heard -- this ads up to, i 2 think, roughly 1.7 billion dollars or so and 3 about half of that has been paid by 4 philip morris. 5 so in addition to the billions and billions 6 of dollars philip morris has spent settling 7 lawsuits with the states and paying to the 8 states, they also are funding the cost of their 9 regulation because that is what congress 10 required. 11 and this is not empty regulation at all. 12 the fda has enormous powers. if philip morris 13 is to violate the law and violate the 14 regulations, they can shut down their plants; 15 they can seize their products in their 16 warehouses; they can go into the store and tell 17 retailers, you cannot sell this cigarette 18 because philip morris violated the law; they can 19 impose massive fines and penalties. and none of 20 that has happened to philip morris because 21 philip morris has complied with the regulations 22 and restrictions, just like they have complied 23 since 1997 with those settlement agreements and 24 all the restrictions on their advertising. 25 there is been no violations by philip morris. 1 and on this issue of mitigation you are 2 allowed to "consider the extent to which 3 philip morris' conduct has changed from the 4 conduct that harmed ms. naugle and the extent to 5 which circumstances have changed." 6 and i'd submit to you that everything the 7 plaintiff is saying philip morris continues to 8 do today there is nothing illegal or wrongful 9 about it. philip morris continues to sell 10 cigarettes and it is legal for them to do that. 11 philip morris continues to have nicotine in the 12 tobacco in the cigarettes and that is also legal 13 for philip morris to do. 14 philip morris markets cigarettes, although 15 you have heard about the restrictions, and that 16 philip morris does not advertise in magazines 17 that is legal for philip morris to do. even 18 dr. cummings admitted -- they talk about a 19 conspiracy nonstop, even dr. cummings admitted 20 the conspiracy stopped in 1998. fifteen years 21 ago. what is there that remains to be deterred 22 and punished that would warrant awarding more 23 money in punitive damages? 24 given everything you have heard in this case, 25 i submit the answer is no, nothing. and as i've 1 indicated, you should fully and fairly 2 compensate ms. naugle for her medical bills not 3 the amount of pain and suffering they are asking 4 for because it is outrageous, but on punitive 5 damages there is just no need right now in 2013 6 for additional money in the form of punitive 7 damages. 8 one more instruction and one more point i 9 want to make. you are entitled to conclude that 10 misconduct that occurred in the distant past and 11 involved actors who are no longer associated 12 with philip morris need not be punished or that 13 should be punished less severely than recent 14 misconduct. 15 you know, i do not get to go last. 16 mr. uustal gets a chance to go after me. and i 17 do not know what he is going to say, but maybe 18 he is going to show you things that you have seen 19 in the trial that might have a tendency to make 20 people angry. and you might think, well -- 21 maybe he will get you worked up and you will say, i 22 want to get in my car and drive up to richmond, 23 virginia and i want to get my hands on some of 24 those people i've seen in the documents. you 25 drive up to richmond, virginia today and you 1 knock on the door and say, i want to see joe 2 cullman, i want to see george weissman, i want 3 to talk to helmut wakeham, they are going to say, 4 who? those people have been long gone from the 5 company. and what you are going to get is you are 6 going to get richard jupe and you are going to 7 get a new generation of management. 8 the people who did the things that they have 9 shown you are long gone from the company. any 10 punitive damages you impose today would be 11 punishing the wrong people. and it is easy to 12 think of philip morris as a person, it is a 13 company. it is easy to think of philip morris as 14 a person because it is a name, it sounds like a 15 person, but the fact is that there have been 16 generations and generations and generations of 17 management through that company during the 60 or 18 70 years we are talking about. and the people 19 who are there today are not the people who are 20 in the documents you have seen or the videos 21 you have seen. 22 and you can tell that it is a different 23 company from the different message it puts on 24 its website. you can tell that it is a different 25 company because they are putting that onsert on 1 cigarettes giving people the public health 2 message about low-tar cigarettes. you can tell 3 it is a different company because they supported 4 fda regulation. you can tell they are a 5 different company because they publish all their 6 research, the public has access to their 7 documents. do not be misled, please, by the fact 8 that it is named philip morris and the company 9 has had the same name for the last 70 years. 10 it is not the same people. it is not the same 11 people at all. and that is something you are 12 entitled to consider. and i ask you to consider 13 on this issue of punitive damages. 14 this is the philip morris today in 2013. 15 people whose names you have heard are gone. 16 philip morris today supports a single consistent 17 message, the public health community's message. 18 philip morris supported fda regulation and 19 operates in a highly restricted and regulated 20 environment today in 2013. and it is a different 21 company run by a different group of people. 22 for all of these reasons that i've spent a 23 lot of time on, because that is what this case 24 seems to be about, it is a question of punitive 25 damages. as i did in my opening statement, i 1 ask you to award zero on this question. because 2 you are going to fully and fairly compensate 3 ms. naugle and there just is no need to award 4 additional money in the form of punitive 5 damages. 6 i mentioned a minute ago that mr. uustal 7 gets to go last. and this is my -- this is my 8 last minute or two with you. and i do not know 9 what he is going to say. i do not get a chance to 10 respond. and so i think you have seen through the 11 trial that there were two sides to every story. 12 this is the one time i do not get to present the 13 other side of the story. so i'd ask you to keep 14 that in mind when you are listening to the 15 rebuttal closing. 16 and we have asked a lot of you so far in this 17 case -- we have been here together if you go back 18 to when people volunteered for the jury, we have 19 been here together almost two weeks. we have 20 asked you to step out of the courtroom, come 21 back in, step back out. the first day of trial 22 we said, go home, we are not ready. you have had 23 to sit there listening to a lot of evidence. 24 and i would ask one more thing of you when you 25 go back in that jury room. i would ask you to 1 award ms. naugle the medical bills compensation 2 she is requesting in the amounts that both sides 3 agree to. i would ask you to be full -- fair on 4 pain and suffering compensation and not award 5 the excessive and unreasonable amount of money 6 they are requesting, but to think about in terms 7 of what would compensate ms. naugle, because the 8 amount they are asking for goes well beyond 9 compensating ms. naugle. 10 and lastly on the issue of punitive damages, 11 the last thing i'd ask you to do is when you get 12 to that question to fill in a zero on that line 13 on the verdict form because there is just no need 14 to award additional money in this case. 15 and, again, i thank you very much on my 16 behalf and ms. arnold's behalf as well for your 17 time and attention. you have been great. i've 18 been up here for a while. and the case is going 19 to be in your hands soon and the job will shift 20 from me and mr. uustal to you. and i thank you 21 very much for it.
