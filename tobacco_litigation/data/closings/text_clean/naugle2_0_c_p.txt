9 mr. uustal: the first time cindy became 10 critically ill was 2009, but she pulled through. 11 she went back to work. she fought her way 12 through rehab and then went back to work and she 13 lived on her own on oxygen for years. 14 this june she got very sick again. you 15 heard that dr. singer described it as a near 16 fatal event. but she pulled through and fought 17 through rehab and got home. 18 the day this trial started she went back in 19 the hospital and she was intubated and then she 20 got better. you heard about that last week. 21 the tube came out. but on friday when her 22 brother testified he told you that things had 23 taken a turn for the worse again. she had to be 24 reintubated. 25 when she got the tube out last week, it 1 looked like 1999 in june. 2 this is a deposition you saw that was taken 3 just a month ago. 4 (video clip was played and taken down to the 5 best of the reporter's ability as follows:) 6 voice: nobody has told me i had a life 7 expectancy of 24. who knows. i'm going to 8 live. i'm a fighter, i told you that, one way 9 or another. 10 (video clip concluded.) 11 mr. uustal: she is only 65. she is always 12 fought off infections before. but they did have 13 to reintubate her. and then this sunday one of 14 the doctors in the medical record recorded the 15 prognosis as terminal. 16 so we have been trying to get you the 17 records as they come in. we obviously do not get 18 them immediately, but that is the latest record 19 you have. and based on this, you can -- and you 20 need to disregard the testimony that we 21 presented to you on her future life care needs, 22 her life care plan and the medical treatment 23 that she would need over the next six to ten 24 years should she live that long. 25 dr. coopersmith told you that he, you know, 1 he was doing his best to come up with a number 2 but that no one really knows. and that is still 3 true. no one knows. but we have to prove 4 anything in this case by the greater weight of 5 the evidence as more likely than not. and at 6 this point with the record that says terminal, 7 you cannot award anything from that life care 8 plan. we agree with that. 9 so why does this trial matter even right now 10 to cindy? 11 this litigation started almost 20 years ago. 12 the plaintiffs were a group of smokers and they 13 proved that smoking was addictive and that 14 cigarettes were harmful. it was not admitted. 15 it was proved in a court of law. 16 and then after that went all the way to the 17 supreme court those group of smokers had to 18 proceed and continue with the case each on their 19 own. and cindy did that. she had her first 20 trial in 2009 that was just her divided into two 21 phases and again she proved -- three week trial, 22 the first trial was a year, you did not hear any 23 of that evidence. you are getting findings from 24 these trials. so you do not have to sit through 25 a year of evidence. you do not have to sit 1 through three weeks of evidence. and those 2 findings of those prior juries are binding on 3 you. 4 and this jury in 2009 in those two phases 5 found that she was addicted, that the cigarettes 6 were defective that she smoked and that the 7 conspiracy that philip morris engaged in to 8 defraud smokers contributed to her emphysema. 9 that is established. 10 so for that reason what you are deciding in 11 this trial is, one, how that harmed her, what 12 her emphysema has done to her, and two, should a 13 company that engages in an intentional 14 conspiracy, who lies about a deadly addictive 15 drug and that causes untold suffering and harm 16 from those lies, should that be punished? and 17 philip morris has told you in opening statement 18 that in their view the answer to that is no. 19 it was a long path. it was a long way for 20 anyone to go, but cindy is a fighter. and we 21 are so close now to the finish line. she is 22 going to finish this lawsuit, and she is still 23 going to make a difference in this world. 24 so let me just give you a summary of the 25 evidence. i'm not going to spend too long on 1 this because you have already seen the evidence. 2 i just want to put it together in a 3 chronological way that you have not seen it 4 before. 5 there was a health scare here. and i want 6 to be -- first of all, we do not dispute that 7 there was plenty of information in the public 8 about the possible harmful effects of smoking. 9 that was the whole reason they started the 10 conspiracy was the first health scare. we do not 11 dispute that at all. and, in fact, in 2009 12 cindy admitted that she was also at fault. she 13 admitted that. and the jury agreed and found 14 her partially at fault. she said she should 15 have quit. but they should have quit lying. 16 so this was in the news. this was big news 17 about the harmful -- possible harmful effects of 18 smoking. and so that is why with that health 19 scare the presidents and the ceos of all the 20 major tobacco companies came together at the 21 plaza hotel in new york city for weeks in 22 december 1953. they stayed through christmas. 23 there were research directors from the 24 corporations there and the press -- public 25 relations company, because this was a public 1 relations problem for them. 2 and so during the course of this weeks of 3 actually the presidents and ceos of major 4 american corporations all meeting together and 5 their research directors they came up with a 6 plan. but the first thing i want to make it 7 clear, forget about all the scientific articles 8 in their files, all the tobacco companies 9 showing the tests they did, showing what they 10 knew about smoking, the -- right there in the 11 plaza hotel the public relations firm talked to 12 the executives and the -- specifically the 13 research directors of the cigarette companies. 14 and two of the comments that they recorded tell 15 you what the cigarette companies knew even then 16 on those two issues. "it is fortunate for us 17 that cigarettes are a habit they cannot break." 18 i'm not even going to talk about the fortunate 19 part. but they knew. a habit they cannot break. 20 they did not say it is a habit that is hard to 21 break. a habit they cannot break. 22 and two, one of them said, "boy, would not it 23 be wonderful if our company was the first to 24 produce a cancer-free cigarette." 25 how much money would they make if you can 1 sell an addictive drug that is no longer deadly? 2 but the point is they knew that it was harmful. 3 so what did they decide to do? and the 4 whole conspiracy that lasted 50 years was based 5 on this, reassure the smoker. maybe there is a 6 risk but it is not something to worry about right 7 now. you can always worry about later, and it is 8 so small, it is too infinitesimal to worry about. 9 should you eat butter or not eat butter, maybe 10 butter is bad for you, that is what they wanted 11 people to think about cigarettes. and that was 12 the genius in that time frame. so they can 13 still come in here and show you -- and it is true 14 there were lots of things in the press about 15 cigarettes being harmful but the genius of what 16 they did was to take that and make people feel 17 is was not a giant, it is a small acceptable risk, 18 like eating butter. 19 too infinitesimal to worry about, that is 20 what they wanted to convince people. let the 21 scientists do the worrying for us, that is their 22 business. and meanwhile let us go on eating, 23 working, playing, smoking, relaxing, and living 24 a good life every day. 25 so as part of the public relations push you 1 saw they published this frank statement. the 2 point i want to focus on is the second sentence 3 that we pulled out. "we believe the products we 4 make are not injurious to health." they had 5 just said, they had just said -- i'll slow down. 6 i apologize -- the research directors, boy, 7 would not it be great if we could produce the 8 first cancer-free cigarette. and you have seen 9 through dr. cummings what was in their files. 10 cindy was seven years old in 1955, a couple 11 years after that meeting in the plaza hotel. 12 what does all this matter to her? 13 you do have to take a moment and understand 14 the world she grew up in, okay. she had already 15 formed an idea of what the world was like. and 16 she literally saw hundreds of times a day people 17 she respected picking up a cigarette. how could 18 it be so horrible of a thing to do, so deadly, 19 so crazy, when everywhere around her, her dad, 20 ministers, judges, doctors, everywhere around 21 her people smoking? and to say that we cannot 22 understand if we did not live at the time or may 23 even be hard to remember, cigarette advertising 24 was just omnipresent, the largest single 25 advertiser in the country. and all those 1 messages she is getting. and those are 2 sophisticated advertising messages designed to 3 appeal to people. so that is how she is formed. 4 yeah, cigarettes, maybe somebody is saying that 5 something could be wrong, but she is willing -- 6 she is a perfect victim for which they set up for 7 people like this. 8 just a couple of the ads from that -- if we 9 could show it real quick, baron. 10 (video clip was played and taken down to the 11 best of the reporter's ability as follows:) 12 voice: tens of thousands of doctors, 13 doctors in all parts of the country in every 14 state of the union, doctors in every branch of 15 medicine were asked: what cigarette do you 16 smoke, doctor? brand named most was camel. 17 yes, according to the survey, more doctors smoke 18 camel. 19 voice: when you change to philip morris, 20 you will feel better. 21 voice: did you say i'll feel better smoking 22 philip morris? 23 voice: yes, you will feel better. 24 voice: lucy. 25 voice: yes, dear. 1 voice: give me a cigarette, will you? 2 voice: do not say cigarettes, say 3 philip morris. 4 voice: oh, is there any other kind? 5 voice: not for you there is not. nothing 6 but the best for mr. ricardo. 7 you see how easy it is to keep a man happy. 8 why not give your husband a carton of 9 philip morris cigarettes. 10 voice: do you inhale? then you are better 11 off smoking philip morris, and here's how you 12 can prove it. light up a philip morris, take a 13 puff, get a good mouthful of smoke and slowly 14 let the smoke come to -- 15 voice: i got a better idea. let us take a 16 winston break. 17 voice: that is it, winston is the one filter 18 cigarette that delivers flavor 20 times a pack. 19 winston has got that filter blend. 20 voice: yeah, fred. 21 voice: i tell ya, pearl, winston is good 22 smoking. sure wish you could taste it. 23 voice: i am tasting it, granny. 24 voice: the dickens you say. 25 voice: benson & hedges 100s are the new 1 longer filter cigarettes, three puffs longer, 2 four puffs longer, maybe five puffs longer than 3 king size. once you get the hang of them. 4 (video clip concluded.) 5 mr. uustal: so these are all different 6 cigarette companies and, you know, it is really 7 impossible to recreate the constant tv 8 advertising and really give you an idea of what 9 it was like, but billboards and magazines and 10 everywhere. and lots of health ads suggesting 11 of doctors and health and why this particular 12 cigarette is better. and these are all going to 13 be in evidence. and famous people and movie 14 stars smoking. and it is just -- the idea was 15 created intentionally that smoking is an 16 acceptable risk, an infinitesimal risk, not that 17 it is proven to be safe. 18 so that carried through until 1964 when 19 again another health scare, the surgeon general 20 report. and, yes, it was covered, it was out 21 there. it was a lot, that is the whole reason 22 they are doing the conspiracy. 23 so they had to come up with a new plan. 24 they had to change things a little bit. so at 25 this point -- and by the way, i've tried here in 1 this presentation to focus on philip morris 2 documents because of the cross of dr. cummings 3 about documents in other tobacco company files. 4 but they got together, they met, they planned. 5 it was a conspiracy. when you engage in a 6 legal -- when you engage in an illegal 7 conspiracy, you are responsible for the acts of 8 all the other conspirators. if you conspire to 9 rob a bank, you cannot say, well, i was not the 10 one digging the tunnel. if it is in furtherance 11 of the conspiracy you are responsible for all the 12 acts of the conspiracy. 13 so at this point they said, look, we need to 14 get a psychological crutch and a self-rationale 15 to give smokers so they can continue smoking. 16 study the psychology of the smoker in search of 17 information that could increase corporate 18 profits. and they stumbled upon the illusion of 19 filtration. 20 see, because this was a time we are putting 21 men into space and science seems like they can 22 solve anything. how could it not solve the 23 cigarette problem if there is one? 24 and people were willing to believe that. 25 the problem is on the bottom we have the 1 philip morris internal document that is in 2 evidence that you will see, "present technology 3 does not permit the selective filtration of 4 particulate smoke." 5 they knew that. you heard later how the 6 surgeon general eventually figured it out, but 7 they knew it right in 1961. still, they are 8 telling, again and again, you can count on the 9 cigarette companies to take anything out of your 10 cigarettes if science ever really finds any such 11 hazard in the wonderful tobacco leaf. message 12 after message because it works. they stumbled 13 on that, the illusion of filtration, and it 14 worked. 15 and they say, "the belief appears to be 16 widely held that filtered cigarettes are less 17 hazardous." it worked. what they were saying 18 worked, not the filters. 19 even convinced the government. and 20 remember, the surgeon general eventually said, 21 we got fooled. but at that time they are saying, 22 hey, yeah, smoke a filter. 23 in 2010 the surgeon general says filters did 24 not create morbidity, immortality, it did not 25 decrease -- i'm sorry, it did not decrease 1 disease or death. 2 used by the tobacco industry as a tool to 3 undermine prevention, it is not just me saying 4 it, it is not just the prior juries, surgeon 5 general, and unfortunately it took us a long 6 time to realize what the cigarette manufacturers 7 already knew. and you saw documents that said 8 we just could not anticipate how the designers, 9 the people who designed the cigarettes could 10 figure out ways to make cigarettes more 11 addictive and get around everything we were 12 trying to do, all the time knowing the present 13 technology did not allow it. 14 so that was the filter. the filter fraud, 15 as dr. cummings called it. 16 and by the way, dr. cummings, dr. cummings 17 has written parts of surgeon general reports, 18 it is been his career, public health. that 19 yearlong trial he testified twice for free. 20 he is testifying here for free. public health is 21 important to him. 22 and there is one single greatest threat to 23 the public health in the united states, and it is 24 in this courtroom right now. but they come up 25 with -- call it the filter fraud. but there is a 1 second strategy, doubt and confusion. because 2 remember they said we just need a self-rationale 3 to give the smoker an excuse, a psychological 4 crutch to continue smoking. because the 5 nicotine addict, highly addicted nicotine 6 addict, and dr. cummings explained how there is 7 different levels of nicotine addiction based on 8 when you first start smoking and based on your 9 genetics. some people are more susceptible to 10 nicotine addiction than other people. but the 11 highly addicted nicotine addict, and this is in 12 philip morris documents too, will choose 13 nicotine over food in times of starvation. the 14 brain actually physically changes and the body 15 craves nicotine more than food. that is why you 16 see, and i'm sure you have seen this, some people 17 who after they have had some horrible 18 smoking-related illness they cannot even smoke 19 through their month, they are still smoking 20 through a hole in their throat. but that is the 21 highly addicted nicotine addict. 22 and all they had to give, certainly the 23 highly addicted, but even people who are less 24 addicted was an excuse, the psychological 25 crutch. and they figured out how to do it.. 1 doubt is our product, that is what we are going to 2 sell more of now. if we sell doubt, do not 3 worry, we will sell cigarettes. 4 the most important type of story, just 5 remember the tobacco institute, center for 6 tobacco research, these are the fraudulent 7 organizations, propaganda organizations they set 8 up in 1953 at the plaza hotel which in the year 9 1998 we killed as -- 10 mr. mccarter: objection, your honor, to the 11 "we killed." 12 the court: sustained. 13 stick to the evidence, sir. 14 mr. uustal: but they are putting stories out 15 in the news and in newspapers, and they say the 16 most important type of story is which gives 17 doubt on the cause-and-effect theory of disease 18 and smoking. 19 keyword is confusion. from 1954 to 1998, 20 and i'm using those dates because that was in 21 the surgeon general report, they spent a billion 22 dollars on those organizations with that 23 propaganda. they were sending out monthly 24 propaganda newsletters to a million people. the 25 influence makers, people in congress and doctors 1 and leaders in the community all over the 2 country. 3 just some of the things they were sending 4 out, oh, smoking is related to -- is linked to 5 cancer? well, march births are linked to 6 cancer. these are the type of studies. they 7 say, oh, epidemiologically they can prove that 8 if you are born in march obviously that is not a 9 cause of lung cancer, just like smoking, it is 10 just a statistical fluke. 11 and then surgeon general said between 1940 12 and 2005, i have to have those years because 13 that is the number they give us, they spent, the 14 tobacco companies 250 billion dollars on 15 advertising creating a world reinforcing their 16 message. 17 so what does 250 million -- billion, billion 18 dollars buy? well, in 1967 we found out. the 19 government looked into it and it said, "the 20 public is subjected to an endless barrage of 21 radio and television commercials that keep 22 pounding away on a single theme," the theme, 23 part of the conspiracy, "suddenly but 24 effectively the message is delivered that the 25 health hazards of cigarette smoking are 1 exaggerated and nonexistent." that is the 2 conspiracy in a nutshell. 3 and that message was subtly but effectively 4 delivered, not just in their billion dollars of 5 propaganda, but also in their 250 billion 6 dollars of advertising. and this is 1967, right 7 before cindy started to smoke. 8 and they make another interesting point. 9 it is not well known about the addictive nature 10 of smoking. and it is certainly not communicated 11 in any of these ads. and if someone is trying 12 to make a decision, a young person, should i try 13 just one cigarette, that is something they have a 14 right to hear. 15 but this is the time, around the time when 16 cindy tried her first cigarette. and it is 17 confirmed in their files, okay. it is not just 18 dr. cummings. it is not just me. it is not just 19 the government. they confirmed, "very few 20 consumers are aware of the effects of nicotine." 21 actually, i'm not sure if this is a 22 philip morris document. this is brown and 23 williamson. this is not philip morris. 24 but the point is, brown and williamson, a 25 tobacco company, a conspirator of theirs, is 1 telling us that the government is right, that 2 dr. cummings is right, "at this time very few 3 consumers are aware of the effects of nicotine, 4 it is addictive nature and that nicotine is a 5 poison." and that is 1970, two years after cindy 6 started smoking. 7 and cindy was one of those people. at this 8 point in your life had you ever heard of 9 nicotine? no. she never even heard the word. 10 now, just want to stop here for a second 11 because you have heard evidence on addiction, and 12 the reason you are hearing this evidence is 13 because one of the factors in deciding punitive 14 damages is any other circumstances that you want 15 to consider in whether the defendant should be 16 punished more or less, but it is not to decide 17 whether she was at fault or how much she was at 18 fault. that is already decided. it is in the 19 instructions the judge will give you. the prior 20 jury heard evidence that you did not and you 21 must accept those findings. and the judge is 22 going to take your verdict and apply those 23 findings about her fault to it. and she was at 24 fault and she has always admitted that she was 25 at fault. she should have quit. but they 1 should have quit lying. 2 so the prior jury found the conspiracy was a 3 cause of her emphysema. 4 let me talk about the health -- see, these 5 were not warnings when she started smoking. they 6 were changed. remember, it says "warning" 7 later. when she picked up her first cigarette 8 pack out of a vending machine, first of all, it 9 was not on a poster this big. even today -- you 10 can see these are philip morris brands that we 11 had yesterday -- those warnings are on there, 12 but they are not huge boards. 13 mr. mccarter: objection, your honor. gets 14 into preemption. sorry to interrupt, counsel. 15 it gets into preemption. 16 the court: i've given you legal 17 instructions on this already, ladies and 18 gentlemen. 19 you may continue, sir. 20 mr. uustal: so that is the first point, even 21 today. they showed them to you because they 22 want you to see a giant board. but she did not 23 see a giant board. 24 second thing is it did not say warning like 25 it does now. it said something very 1 interesting, very, very interesting. "caution: 2 cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your 3 health." 4 now whose message is that? "may be 5 hazardous to your health." may be. may be or 6 it may not be. 7 (video clip was played and taken down to the 8 best of the reporter's ability as follows:) 9 voice: cigarette smoking may be hazardous 10 to your health, it may not be; we just do not 11 know. 12 voice: i do not know, frankly, i think that 13 smoking may be hazardous, it may not be. 14 voice: smoking may be hazardous, it may not 15 be. no one, including tv 7, knows for certain. 16 voice: it may be or it may not be, we do not 17 know. 18 voice: i do not know if cigarettes are bad 19 or they are not bad. 20 voice: we do not know what causes the 21 illness that has been attributed to cigarette 22 smoking. 23 voice: i'm saying that the science to date 24 and over 100 million dollars of our industry 25 indicates that there is no causal... 1 (video clip concluded.) 2 mr. uustal: it may be or it may not be 3 that is their message, and it is right there on 4 the cigarette pack. 5 so did it work? yeah. 6 ftc did a study, 1967, right about the time 7 that she picked up her first cigarette. "the 8 warning label on the cigarette packages has not 9 succeeded in overcoming the prevalent attitudes 10 that cigarette smoking created and maintained by 11 the cigarette companies through their 12 advertisements, particularly the barrage of 13 commercials on television which portray smoking 14 as harmless and enjoyable, not habit-forming 15 with no hazards to health." 16 it is tough for a tiny little warning label 17 that happens to be consistent with their message 18 and that you would not even look at when you are 19 picking up a cigarette pack to open it, to fight 20 250 billion dollars in advertising and a billion 21 dollars of the most sophisticated propaganda, in 22 this country at least. 23 again, it is already decided about she was at 24 fault partially, but that is already decided. 25 the issue of fault is not for you. 1 i want to discuss briefly about how 2 addiction drives disease. social smokers who 3 through genetic luck or other factors do not 4 become addicted, they just get way less 5 exposure. if you are lucky enough not to be 6 addicted and you smoke here and there, you 7 get -- over a lifetime you get so much less 8 exposure than someone like cindy who has got to 9 smoke first thing in the morning, last thing at 10 night. she wakes in the middle of the night. 11 she cannot even sit through a whole movie without 12 getting that nicotine fix. so she gets so much 13 exposure. that is how addiction drives disease. 14 nicotine is one of the most addictive drugs on 15 the face of the planet. right now 45 million 16 smokers, way more than half, want to quit. but 17 in any given year less than 3 percent succeed 18 for a whole year. 19 the illegal drugs that philip morris said in 20 response to the 1984 surgeon general's report, 21 oh, do not compare us to those illegal drugs. 22 people can quit them, some of them, easier than 23 nicotine. 24 just talking about cindy, i mean, was she 25 addicted? it is already been proven to the other 1 jury. you did not hear all the evidence, but she 2 was highly addicted. a person who has to smoke 3 in the middle of the night if she gets up, cannot 4 sit through a whole movie. oh, and she started 5 to quit in 1970, when the label changed from 6 may, from their message to "does," she realized 7 too that she was smoking so much and within two 8 years smoking so much -- she was smoking that 9 much within a few weeks, but within two years 10 she decided to try and quit. and that was a 11 feature of her life up until the time that she 12 got the patch. and when she got the patch it 13 was completely different. when she was trying 14 to quit before, she felt like she was crawling 15 out of her skin, but with the patch it was not 16 like that. 17 i bring that up because mr. jupe -- you 18 heard from dr. cummings and mr. jupe yesterday 19 about the business with the nicorette gum. and 20 richard jupe said, "we had a business dispute 21 with dow. dow chemical was the producer of 22 nicorette gum. they were saying some things in 23 their communications we did not agree with. we 24 were buying from dow chemical." 25 that is a very, very important statement. 1 let us look at it. 2 first of all, they were buying from dow 3 chemical. and you know from dr. cummings that 4 they were able to successfully pressure, they 5 had leverage over dow. well, dow sold stuff to 6 them so they were in a position of leverage if 7 they wanted to get dow to do something and dow 8 wanted to continue with that relationship. and 9 mr. jupe said, they were saying some things in 10 one of their communications that we did not agree 11 with. well, you know from the evidence that 12 you have heard and in evidence in the case is the 13 smoking cessation newsletter, which you can read 14 through, you can figure out what the message 15 was, what are the things that we did not agree 16 with. and the pamphlets in the doctors' waiting 17 rooms, you do not have a copy of that, but you 18 can look through it because the message that 19 they did not agree with was quit smoking and use 20 nicorette to do it. this is in evidence. 21 plaintiff's exhibit 2. 22 and that was when she was trying to quit. 23 and it is, you know -- look, some people might 24 have a problem with a company that sells a 25 deadly addictive drug, but let us put that aside. 1 obviously it is much worse to lie about it so you 2 can make more money and get more people addicted 3 knowing that more of them are going to die, but 4 let us put that aside. how about the people who 5 want to quit trying to conceal the way that they 6 can quit? is that something that should not be 7 punished, that they are really going to come in 8 here and say to you zero? 9 she was addicted. the issues here in 10 relation to her and her fault are all decided. 11 so this continued all through the time she 12 was trying to quit. i've just got a couple of 13 videos from this time period. 14 (video clip was played and taken down to the 15 best of the reporter's ability as follows:) 16 voice: earlier this week the rj reynolds 17 tobacco company took out this ad in a number of 18 major newspapers and magazines calling for an 19 open debate about smoking. in brief, the ad 20 contends that medical studies would show that 21 cigarette smoking causes disease are ignoring 22 significant evidence to the contrary. 23 voice: cigarette smoking does not cause 24 cancer, yes or no? 25 voice: it is not known whether cigarettes 1 cause cancer. it has not been causally 2 established. 3 voice: cigarette smoking no causal 4 relationship between cigarette smoking and 5 emphysema. 6 voice: despite all of the research to date, 7 there has been no causal link established. 8 voice: no causal relationship between 9 cigarette smoking and heart disease. 10 voice: no, as a matter of fact, there are 11 studies that while we are accused of being 12 associated with heart disease, there have been 13 studies conducted over 10 years that would say 14 again that science is still puzzled over these 15 forces. 16 (video clip concluded.) 17 mr. uustal: so this is the ceo of rjr, one 18 of their co-conspirators. 19 you know what, let me just show you one 20 more. let us do the 1994. this continued all 21 the way through the '90s. 22 by the way, during this whole period they are 23 going to come in and tell you that cindy knew. 24 cindy should have known in 1968. everybody 25 knew. but here they are in 1994 saying -- and 1 it is true, they do come up with the little 2 twist on the facts and definitions and stuff. 3 that was in the first document from the 4 conspiracy called the forwarding memo, which 5 you will have in evidence, it specifically talked 6 about putting little twists on the facts of 7 science. and you will listen to them when they 8 deny it, because they knew it is true, but 9 they are denying it in a way, putting a little 10 twist on the facts of science, and that started 11 right in the beginning of the conspiracy. 12 will you play that. 13 (video clip was played and taken down to the 14 best of the reporter's ability as follows:) 15 voice: i'd like you to rise, and those who 16 will be testifying as well, i'd like you to 17 rise. 18 if you raise your right hand. do you swear 19 that the testimony you are about to give is the 20 truth, the whole truth and nothing but the 21 truth? 22 please consider yourself to be under oath. 23 voice: let me begin my questioning on the 24 matter of whether or not nicotine is addictive. 25 let me ask you first, and i'd like to just go 1 down the row, whether each of you believes that 2 nicotine is not addictive. 3 i heard virtually all of you touch on it. 4 and just yes or no, do you believe nicotine is 5 not addictive? 6 voice: i believe nicotine is not addictive, 7 yes. 8 voice: mr. johnston. 9 voice: congressman, cigarettes and nicotine 10 clearly do not meet the classic definitions of 11 addiction. there is no intoxications -- 12 voice: we will take that as a no. 13 and, again, time is short if you could 14 just -- i think each of you believe nicotine is 15 not addictive, we just would like to have this 16 for the record. 17 voice: i do not believe that nicotine or our 18 products are addictive. 19 voice: i believe nicotine is not addictive. 20 voice: i believe that nicotine is not 21 addictive. 22 voice: i believe that nicotine is not 23 addictive. 24 voice: and i too believe that nicotine is 25 not addictive. 1 voice: mr. campbell, you were also deposed 2 and you said, quote, to my knowledge it has not 3 been proven that cigarette smoking causes 4 cancer." 5 this is a rather passive and pleasant 6 approach, especially in light of the consensus, 7 not by some, but all of the scientific 8 community. will you ever be convinced, and what 9 evidence are you waiting for? 10 and let us have the microphone passed over. 11 voice: yes, i may be convinced. we do not 12 know what causes cancer in general right now so 13 i think that we may find out what causes cancer 14 and we may find out some relationship which has 15 yet to be proven. 16 (video clip concluded.) 17 mr. uustal: so just two points about that. 18 first of all, it is 1994 under oath. so seems to 19 me it would be difficult for them to say that 20 cindy should have known before that when their 21 people -- that last guy is the ceo of 22 philip morris -- were saying that it is not 23 proven and it is not addictive. 24 the other thing is, that is different than 25 what mr. jupe told you their position was back 1 then. remember he said their position in 1994 2 was just, oh, well, we do not know how it causes 3 cancer. that is not what they were saying. they 4 did not say, we do not know how it causes cancer. 5 they said, it is not proven that it does cause 6 cancer. and that is a big difference. 7 your honor, do you know what time i started? 8 the court: you began at 9, sir. 9 mr. uustal: thank you. 10 let us look at the verdict form. 11 so the first question is: "what is the 12 total amount of medical expenses sustained by 13 lucinda naugle in the past?" 14 you have a box of all of her medical bills 15 that we -- not all of her medical bills, the 16 ones related to emphysema, and you have heard 17 testimony on that. and attached to each bill is 18 the records that if you need to confirm that 19 it is related to emphysema. 20 i have heard no objection during the entire 21 case to any of these bills. so that is what it 22 is. that is an easy one. and i read you the 23 amount, $466,389.66 during the case. 24 let me just show you a couple of jury 25 instructions that apply to that $466,000. 1 one of them in your instructions from the 2 judge is the comparative fault. and it is just 3 saying, look, when someone is at -- when a 4 plaintiff is partially at fault, then the law 5 sometimes requires reductions based on that 6 fault. but that is for the judge. okay, you 7 do not reduce anything in your verdict. the 8 judge does that after the case. so you are not 9 to reduce that in any way because she was at 10 fault and she admitted it and the jury found her 11 percentage, a prior jury, and the judge will 12 apply that as appropriate under the law to the 13 verdict afterwards. 14 the second thing is, there was a question 15 from a juror and i think a couple of comments 16 during the evidence about insurance or medicare. 17 so these are the bills, okay, and that is what 18 the law requires you to put on your verdict. if 19 there is a reason, because of insurance to -- the 20 insurance is not in these, it is been removed 21 from these bills, because that is not the 22 evidence you need to determine for your verdict. 23 the judge will handle that after the trial if 24 there is a reason because of insurance to reduce 25 it, if the insurance companies come in and try 1 and get part of it, which they are entitled to, 2 and also for future, although that is not an 3 issue in this case anymore, there can be part of 4 it that has to be set aside so that the money 5 for future medical bills comes from there 6 instead of medicare having to pay or something. 7 it has to come from that fund. 8 but anyway, that is not -- you do not need to 9 worry about that and you certainly do not need to 10 reduce it because you think, oh, there may have 11 been insurance. in fact, you are not allowed to. 12 let us go back to the medical expenses in the 13 future. so you heard a lot of testimony on 14 that. dr. coopersmith first came to an opinion 15 on her life expectancy before 2009, and about 16 five years later he was consistent with that 17 before you, based on all the information he had. 18 but he did tell you, there is a very specific 19 question, in reality no one knows. and that is 20 true now as well. but you cannot put in your 21 verdict anything on that plan. her doctor, as 22 you know, right now says terminal. so it is 23 unlikely that she is going to leave the hospital. 24 she went in -- so you will see from the 25 records that her hospitalization in june at 1 broward general was for 30 days. and it was 2 approximately $200,000. i think it was a couple 3 hundred dollars over that. 4 so she is been in there since thursday, so a 5 week and a half ago, and she will be in there, i 6 mean, at least some future time. no one knows, 7 but you have to base your evidence on the 8 greater weight of the evidence, so i would 9 suggest that two weeks of hospitalization. it is 10 already been -- so it is one day short of two 11 weeks. so i would say two to three weeks of 12 hospitalization, which is 100 to 150 for that in 13 the future. and part of it, the expenses have 14 already been incurred but they have not been 15 billed so that is why that would be in the 16 future. the past you have there. and that 17 would be the only thing you can consider. i 18 want to just make that clear. nothing about 19 anything the numbers dr. raffa testified to, it 20 turns out that you do not need them. so i'm 21 sorry we took your time on that, but at the time 22 we thought you did. you cannot let that affect 23 you at all. the only issue is now two weeks or 24 three weeks of hospitalization. 25 now, i want to address an issue that seemed 1 to come up in the trial and it may come up when 2 counsel for philip morris gives his closing 3 argument. the idea that because cindy did not 4 get pulmonary rehabilitation you should somehow, 5 i'm not even sure, do something with your 6 verdict, reduce something in your verdict. i'll 7 have to wait and see exactly what they say. 8 but let me just say, the evidence in the 9 case is that she was not going to pulmonary rehab 10 because she was going to work. and pulmonary 11 rehab for someone who is bedridden -- i mean, 12 what is it? dr. coopersmith told you it is 13 walking on a treadmill, it is learning about 14 nutrition, and it is very helpful for bedridden 15 patients. and it probably would have been a 16 good thing for her, but by going to work she had 17 to get up, she had to get out of the house, she 18 had to walk to the car, drive, go into work, 19 work and get home. and dr. singer, her treating 20 doctor for many, many, many years, specifically 21 said that is a form of rehab. and so the idea 22 that not doing the pulmonary rehab might have 23 affected something in this case is just put in 24 your heads as a speculation. 25 but let us look at what the medical testimony 1 says about that. first dr. singer -- oh, no, 2 i'm sorry, let me just show what she says about 3 that. 4 (video clip was played and taken down to the 5 best of the reporter's ability as follows:) 6 voice: because we are open from 7 in the 7 morning until 5:30. i'm a person who is on 8 oxygen 24/7. you are going to make me go to 9 physical therapy for two hours then make up two 10 more hours of work? do you know how many hours 11 of work that is putting on a person with 12 copd/emphysema, to make that person with 13 emphysema? people cannot believe i'm working 14 every single day. i get up at 4:30 in the 15 morning. i get up at 4:30 in the morning to try 16 to get ready, myself ready to get to work every 17 day. how many people in my -- like me would go 18 to work and get there 7:35 in the morning and 19 work until 5:30? 20 (video clip concluded.) 21 mr. uustal: that is better than walking on a 22 treadmill for certain, very, very slow, 23 dr. coopersmith told you how it is just very, 24 very slow. 25 what do the doctors say about that, her 1 doctor, singer? 2 (video clip was played and taken down to the 3 best of the reporter's ability as follows:) 4 voice: well, obviously the fact is she 5 never went. she was doing pretty well. she was 6 getting up and dressing and going to work. she 7 was functioning at a very high level, and 8 fortunately we kept her out of the hospital a 9 long time. so recommending pulmonary rehab 10 would be an additional benefit that obviously i 11 think anyone with emphysema would enjoy, but it 12 was never anything which i thought reflected 13 poorly on her either as a conscientious patient 14 or seriously impeded her treatment or care. 15 (video clip concluded.) 16 (video clip was played and taken down to the 17 best of the reporter's ability as follows:) 18 voice: over the years has cindy taken her 19 treatment with you very seriously? 20 voice: oh, very. 21 voice: have you -- were you ever critical 22 of her for working as opposed to taking the time 23 off to go to pulmonary rehab? 24 voice: no, not in the least. 25 voice: does she typically make her 1 scheduled appointments? 2 voice: yes. 3 voice: has she been overall compliant as a 4 patient -- 5 voice: yes, she is a wonderful patient. 6 she is a model patient. 7 (video clip concluded.) 8 mr. uustal: just remember that if you hear 9 any argument from lawyers. in fact, let us see 10 the video of the doctor who testified that 11 pulmonary rehab would have changed anything 12 about her medical care. 13 you do not have that one, baron? 14 mr. phillips: sorry, i do not. 15 mr. uustal: there is is not one. you heard 16 in the evidence they showed dr. cummings some 17 notes from the medical evaluation of a doctor 18 they hired to evaluate her, to examine her, did 19 he testify that this pulmonary rehab would have 20 changed anything? so remember about that -- 21 mr. mccarter: objection, your honor. 22 the court: sustained. 23 mr. uustal: argument of a lawyer is not the 24 same as evidence, the testimony of a doctor. 25 so just a couple of things about, you know, 1 why, why she was not at pulmonary rehab and what 2 type of person she is. 3 you heard from a deposition, but her boss, 4 "she is tough, i'll tell you that." 5 "she is a really hard worker." 6 she was on intravenous antibiotics at work. 7 intravenous antibiotics and she went to work. 8 "she was weak, we would drive her home, but you 9 cannot get her not to come to work. she is coming 10 to work as long as she can get up and walk." 11 is that a bad thing? 12 and just the last one, quotes about her 13 being a fighter. "i do not tell people, i do not 14 talk about it because in some ways i'm very 15 lucky, i can go to work. i'm very lucky." 16 second question, total amount of damages for 17 pain and suffering, disability, physical 18 impairment, disfigurement, mental anguish, 19 inconvenience, loss of capacity for the 20 enjoyment of life in the past and in the future. 21 and the jury instruction on this 22 specifically says "you shall consider the 23 following elements," and it includes all of 24 those, pain, suffering, disability, and it goes 25 through each of them. so i want to talk to you 1 about -- a little bit about each of them 2 individually. 3 but before we -- first of all, let me say, 4 future, again, future is just limited to what 5 you think over the next -- the next couple of 6 weeks. 7 but let us talk about how you are going to 8 figure out based on the jury instructions and 9 the evidence what to put in that line for in the 10 past. 11 this was cindy at her brother's wedding 12 within a few days or weeks of being diagnosed 13 with emphysema. she was not feeling the physical 14 effects yet. early 40s. 15 she is only 65 right now. and when you see 16 pictures of her, she is only 65. that is what 17 emphysema did to her. 18 so let us go through quickly the different 19 time periods. 20 '93 to '96, obviously it was a concern for 21 her, but it was not physically affecting her. 22 '96 to 2006, that is when she said she 23 could not walk the dogs anymore, in '96. and she 24 was slowly deteriorating, her lungs getting 25 worse and worse each day. and she was having 1 trouble breathing. she was on oxygen 2 intermittently, part-time she needed oxygen. 3 she had to carry supplemental oxygen. and there 4 were times when she was very bad during that 5 time period. her world was getting smaller and 6 smaller. each of the things that she had 7 enjoyed one by one she was having to give them 8 up. 9 by 2006 she was on full-time oxygen, meaning 10 she was tethered to a machine every second of 11 her life. 12 she had to get up at 4:30 to get to work by 13 7:35. and she lives five minutes from work, if 14 you remember. so that is how long -- you know, 15 she is got to get up and walk to the bathroom, 16 then she is got to rest. then she is got to brush 17 her teeth. the action of brushing her teeth, 18 she is got to catch her breath, she is out of 19 breath now. her baseline level is out of 20 breath. so it is like just running a long 21 distance, being out of breath and then trying to 22 do something, adding to that being out of 23 breath, the cannot catch your breath, gasping for 24 breath. 25 she had a serious hospitalization in 2009. 1 2009 to 2013 she got back to full-time 2 oxygen but being able to live at home, tethered 3 to a machine at all times. but by this time she 4 lost going to her brother's house, family 5 events. the last few things that she loved she 6 had to give up. and her life was just trying to 7 get to work, trying to catch a breath. 8 and then from june 2013 to today she has 9 been in the hospital, rehab, she got out for a 10 short time, she is had two near fatal events. 11 the court: you have five minutes, sir. 12 mr. uustal: thank you, your honor. i think 13 i'm going to need an extra five. 14 the court: it is your time. use it how you 15 wish. 16 mr. uustal: thank you, your honor. 17 (video clip was played and taken down to the 18 best of the reporter's ability as follows:) 19 voice: we also asked you to produce all 20 documents, including photographs or dvds or 21 videotapes depicting you during vacation or 22 holiday or leisure activities. do you have any 23 of those at home? 24 voice: i do not do that anymore. i just 25 come home -- i go to work, i come home. i do not 1 go on holidays. i do not take trips. i've never 2 been on a trip in 20 years. no, i tell you, i 3 have no idea the last time i took a trip. i 4 do not even go to my brother's house anymore. 5 voice: have you taken any vacations since 6 the last trial or any trips? 7 the witness: no trips, no vacations. 8 (video clip concluded.) 9 mr. uustal: just the act of talking you can 10 see she had to take a second to try and catch 11 her breath, lying in bed just talking. you have 12 heard it described as being a prisoner in her 13 own body, always out of breath, slowly 14 suffocating over the last two decades. she lost 15 everything that was important to her. it was 16 literally her life was get out of bed, fight for 17 breath, walk to the bathroom, fight for breath, 18 brush your teeth, fight for breath, all day long 19 fight for breath and hopefully get to work. and 20 that is it. 21 so when you consider these things over two 22 decades, and the verdict form lists them and the 23 jury instructions says "you shall consider each 24 of them." 25 obviously something that is minor, say a 1 minor pain caused by someone else's negligence, 2 car accident or something that does not last very 3 long is a very minor, deserves a very minor 4 compensation, maybe nothing, maybe a couple of 5 hundred bucks. the more serious the pain the 6 numbers go up. 7 and, you know, the law requires compensation 8 for medical bills and things like that, but the 9 law also requires compensation for things like 10 this. because the law requires you to consider 11 these things, because the law values a person's 12 life, not just their money, and what their life 13 means to them. and these things affect what 14 their life was, what it is. 15 so as the pain increases -- and cindy had 16 intermittent pain throughout her life, but it is 17 not a major consideration for you here, but i'm 18 just using it as an example so how you can look 19 at each one of these things. if it is minor pain 20 and for a short period of time obviously it 21 might be nothing or very small amount. as the 22 pain increases or the time of the pain 23 increases, the value is -- that is required for 24 compensation is going up. 25 and if it is medium pain over a medium period 1 of time, maybe you are getting to tens of 2 thousands of dollars. if it is an extremely 3 excruciating pain even over a short period that 4 could be much more significant. it could be 5 something that scars someone for life, and as it 6 increases in the amount of time you can get into 7 hundreds of thousands of dollars. but if you 8 have something that lasts for decades and is at 9 the highest end of the scale, can you imagine 10 excruciating pain for two decades, obviously 11 you are talking about the most serious 12 compensation. and so you are up to the level at 13 that point of the most serious, if you have got 14 the most serious harm over the longest period of 15 time of millions. 16 pain, it was not a significant factor for 17 her. but if we look at each of the others, 18 let us start at the bottom, loss of the capacity 19 for the enjoyment of life. that is what it is. 20 you know, sometimes these do not apply at all, 21 but for some people it is a perfect description. 22 it stole her life, two decades. and if her 23 life, if you have something that -- i cannot 24 imagine something that could take away more, the 25 enjoyment of life and it has lasted her entire 1 life for two decades, and she is going to die 2 long before her time. so for loss of capacity 3 of enjoyment of life. 4 disability, you know, you could be paralyzed 5 in a wheelchair, that is disability and physical 6 impairment, but she is right up at that level in 7 her inability to do things, the most serious 8 form of disability, and, again, for this 9 extremely long period of time. look, it is 10 not -- you are not allowed to blame anyone that 11 this has taken so long. you cannot hold that 12 against anybody, but at the same time, this is a 13 very long period of time, and that compensation 14 has to reflect that. 15 so we have at least three things on here, 16 the disability, the suffering and loss of 17 capacity of life that are at the highest end of 18 the spectrum and have occurred over two decades, 19 and so for each of those highest end of the 20 spectrum and that long period of time, for each 21 one of those you need to recognize what she has 22 lost. 23 and for the others i'm not going to suggest 24 a number. i think you should look at them each 25 individually, but for each one of those, it 1 cannot be hundreds of thousands of dollars, it 2 cannot be. taking away for two decades 3 completely the loss of capacity of life. it is a 4 little less than that because it occurred over a 5 period of time. it cannot be hundreds of 6 thousands of dollars if a life is worth 7 anything. it must be millions to reflect what 8 her life is worth. 9 and so i would suggest to you for loss of 10 capacity, disfigurement -- i'm sorry, loss of 11 capacity, disability and suffering, each of 12 those should be at least 2 million dollars. the 13 rest of them much less. and disfigurement, 14 none. 15 but you need to consider each one of those. 16 for the future i'm not going to even give 17 you a suggestion. you need to consider the same 18 factors but over a very short period of time, 19 and i already told you that the time factor is 20 extremely important, so for each of these it is 21 going to have to reflect a much, much, much, 22 much, much smaller number because it is not two 23 decades. it is a week or two. 24 this is the last question on the verdict 25 form. "what is the total amount of punitive 1 damages, if any, that you find should be 2 assessed against philip morris? 3 the factors that you need to consider, the 4 nature, extent and degree of the misconduct and 5 related circumstances, defendant's financial 6 resources and any other circumstances which may 7 affect the amount." 8 so i've gone through what they did 9 intentionally, fraud. 10 so we have talked about the nature, extent and 11 degree of the misconduct. the extent was 50 12 years. cannot be any higher. the nature was 13 lying about a deadly addictive drug. cannot be 14 any higher. and the degree, what it caused was 15 death and suffering, so it cannot being any 16 higher. 17 second one is defendant's financial 18 resources. you may have wondered why we read 19 that to you, the agreed amount to how much 20 they are making right now. 21 your honor, i'm going to need another 5. 22 the court: take -- it is your time, however 23 you wish to divide it. 24 mr. uustal: may have wondered why we put 25 that in, but if you think about it, a punishment 1 has to reflect that. that is why the law says 2 that, must reflect that. 3 for cindy, if she gets a speeding ticket 4 it is two days of her salary, right, it means 5 something, it is a punishment for her not to 6 speed. 7 so if cindy had done something wrong you 8 would have to take into account what amount to 9 punish her. 10 the court: sustained. that is not proper 11 argument. sustained. focus on the issues 12 before the jury, sir. 13 mr. uustal: yes, sir. 14 so in order for this to have any effect, if 15 that is possible, you need to look at their net 16 earnings. 17 so let me just say again what net earnings 18 are. it is not revenue. it is profit. and it is 19 not just profit. it is the company's revenue 20 minus the cost of the goods sold, it is minus the 21 overhead, minus the payroll, minus the taxes, 22 minus the interest. it is minus -- it is even 23 taxes. it is everything. it is lawyers and 24 litigation and the msa things they told you 25 about. and if they have assets, they buy a 1 corporate jet, bonuses to their ceo, every 2 single thing that philip morris could possibly 3 need is paid for and then they have that much 4 money, which is excess and can be kicked up to 5 their parent company. 6 mr. mccarter: objection, your honor. 7 the court: sustained. it is not proper 8 argument nor is it before you, ladies and 9 gentlemen. 10 stick to the evidence, please. 11 mr. uustal: so there is three interesting 12 things about this. first of all, from 2011 to 13 2012 to 2013 profits are going up every year. 14 and in 2013 they are on track, because this is 15 through the first six months, to make four and a 16 half billion dollars, not made, that is net 17 earnings, after everything, what is left. 18 so for this year right now they are making 19 $12,300,000 per day extra after advertising and 20 everything, the scientists that they told you 21 about. 22 so what is the proper punishment for lies 23 that cause injury and death? it is already 24 established that they lied, they committed 25 fraud, they committed conspiracy and it caused 1 injury and death. so when you put a number on 2 that verdict form, it is going to answer that 3 question. lies about an addictive deadly drug, 4 lies that cause injury and death and untold 5 suffering, and lies for money. we did not get 6 into this that much but you saw the one document 7 where philip morris they had a decision and they 8 said, well, we should make the decision this way 9 if only for the primitive reason of who ain't 10 for more money. 11 lies for money, who ain't for more money at 12 philip morris? 13 so that is the question. it is already been 14 established that they did this and it is already 15 been established that punitive damages are 16 warranted. you are being asked the amount. and, 17 yes, you have the discretion to give an amount 18 that is zero. for example, if the company did not 19 have any assets or was not making any money, 20 you are not allowed to bankrupt a company. but 21 in this situation any amount that is not 22 significant is specifically saying there is no 23 proper punishment or there is a very low 24 punishment for this. and why is that important? 25 why is that important? because first of all, it 1 effects what philip morris does. 2 in fact, let me just show you, mr. jupe 3 testified yesterday. 4 "right after the jury in the yearlong trial 5 this case arose out of found cigarettes, proved 6 cigarettes defective and harmful and addictive, 7 philip morris admitted" -- he brought it up. 8 "do lawsuits have an impact on us? yeah, that is 9 why they changed." 10 and then the next day, talking -- i'm sorry, 11 at the next question, "yeah, no question about 12 it, the lawsuits, private suits, big suits like 13 the attorney generals are they a way for us as a 14 company to realize we are out of alignment? 15 absolutely." 16 so first of all, that number, the number 17 affects what philip morris does, but secondly it 18 answers that question for other people. one of 19 the reasons for punishment when there is 20 something like this is to deter other companies. 21 if other companies look at what the tobacco 22 companies did and say, oh, my god look at how 23 much money they made over this 50-year 24 conspiracy and look how little it cost them in 25 punishment then that encourages other companies 1 in other industries, banks, wall street, 2 whatever it is. 3 so for the deterrence the answer to that 4 question is there -- and dr. cummings was asked, 5 do you think a just verdict is a big verdict in 6 punitive damages? and he said yes. that is the 7 reason why. it will affect philip morris. 8 and so i -- this is just for what they 9 already did, what is already proven. there must 10 be a punishment, significant punishment for 11 that. and this is the only place ever that 12 there will be a punishment for what they did and 13 how it affected cindy. 14 but they are going to say, as mr. jupe said, 15 we are a changed company. and that is the only 16 reason i bring it up. the punishment is for 17 what they already did. the only reason i bring 18 up what they are doing now is because, number 19 one, when they say they are a changed company you 20 need to consider what they are doing now, but 21 number two, you can affect what they are doing 22 now. 23 surgeon general says cigarettes are designed 24 for addiction, designed by people like mr. jupe 25 for addiction. ways in which you can make 1 cigarettes more addictive. 2 they have found a way to freebase the 3 nicotine. cigarettes today deliver more 4 nicotine and deliver it quicker than ever 5 before. that is what they are doing now. you 6 know why? decrease the exit rates by making it 7 more addictive, exit rates for the addicted 8 population and increase the entry rates through 9 advertising to beginning smokers and designs in 10 the cigarette that help people move from 11 experimental to addicted smokers. 12 that is what they are doing right now, that is 13 what the surgeon general says, and yet it goes 14 on. 15 the fda wanted to get these warnings you 16 heard about, fifty percent of the pack front and 17 back, five years ago, in 2009 it came up. it is 18 going to happen, still has not happened. may 19 never happen. it is not going to be the fda. 20 mr. jupe told you what changes their behavior, 21 and it is the lawsuits. 22 right now in the united states they spend 34 23 million a day in marketing, 1200 current and 24 former smokers die prematurely and the nation 25 spends 260 million a day on medical costs, 270 1 million in lost productivity. that is what 2 they are doing today. 3 dr. cummings told you in the 20th century we 4 lost 100 million people to smoking. we are on 5 track to lose a billion souls in the 21st 6 century because of how they design the 7 cigarettes today. so when they say they are a 8 changed company, you do not even need to consider 9 this. they should be punished for what they did 10 in the conspiracy. they must be punished. but 11 if they say they are a changed company, you can 12 affect what they are doing today. 13 thank you. 14 thank you, your honor. 15 the court: all right, mr. uustal, thank 16 you. 17 we will take our morning break. i want to 18 restrict your access, if i can, during the 19 breaks now. so we are going to take a ten-minute 20 recess. do not discuss the case. i ask you to 21 stay in the jury room during the recess this 22 time. 23 mr. uustal: your honor, i apologize. 24 mr. mcpharlin just reminded me. can i have 10 25 seconds? 1 the court: of course. 2 mr. uustal: i apologize. this is important 3 for legal reasons. i have to suggest an amount. 4 i would suggest to you the amount on 5 punitive damages should be two days, two days of 6 their net earnings, twelve and a half million a 7 day, so approximately -- it is 12.3, so just 8 under 25 million dollars. 9 thank you. 17 mr. uustal: it is also the defendant's 18 position that they should not be punished. 19 this is the only courtroom, the only trial 20 ever, anywhere in the world that will punish 21 them for what they did to cindy naugle. counsel 22 made that very clear. you have to look at what 23 they did to cindy naugle. so nothing anywhere 24 else will ever punish them for what they did to 25 her. and it is already established and you must 1 accept that cindy reasonably relied to her 2 detriment on a statement made by philip morris 3 that intentionally concealed material 4 information and that there was a conspiracy and 5 a fraud and that it resulted in her emphysema. 6 if you put anything less than a significant 7 punishment for philip morris on that question, 8 then you are saying that if a company does that, 9 any company, a tobacco company, then they will 10 not be -- anyone other than a tobacco company 11 they will not be seriously punished. and you 12 know why they will not be seriously punished? 13 because they successfully concealed it for 50 14 years and now it is remote. because it is a 15 different company because the litigation took 20 16 years. is that the incentive we want to give 17 companies? you can avoid pun -- they did. they 18 did not deny it. 19 or do we want to give companies an incentive 20 after they intentionally harmed people to hide 21 it, conceal it until it is so old that they can 22 come in and say, it is a different company? 23 mr. mccarter said that it was false about 24 the dow newsletter. read the dow newsletter. 25 yeah, there was one issue, that is how 1 philip morris found out about it. but there was 2 only one issue. it was supposed to go out to 3 those 500 doctors every month for the next 4 decade, but it only went out once. and the 5 patient pamphlets never went out. 6 it is not right for a company to take away 7 the possibility of an addict quitting so they 8 can make more profits and then come in and say 9 they should not be punished for it because it was 10 a long time ago. 11 mr. mccarter suggested -- oh, and by the way 12 they were saying not addictive, never been shown 13 to cause any disease, the whole period of the 14 fraud and then suddenly the attorney generals 15 get the confidential documents and the jury 16 verdict in this case finds cigarettes addictive 17 and harmful and suddenly they admit it and they 18 want you to say, oh, they are a changed company? 19 they did it because of the lawsuits and they are 20 only going to change now because of lawsuits 21 like this. 22 mr. mccarter suggested that cindy was fine 23 up until this year. 1999 she had a -- 24 discharged home with a sitter. she needed 25 24-hour care at some period in 1999. she is had 1 severe copd since 1996, copd, severe. at one 2 point she had to have live-in help. 3 there is no doubt, you have medical records, 4 that she was not fine until this year. this is a 5 decades long destruction of her life. she is 6 going to die 20 years before her time. 7 mr. mccarter: objection, your honor. 8 the court: legal basis, sir? 9 mr. mccarter: has to do with the mortality 10 tables being stricken. 11 the court: i sustain the objection. 12 mr. uustal: there is no doubt her suffering 13 over the decades was extreme. there is no 14 dispute about that. 15 and mr. mccarter misunderstood me when he 16 heard that i was suggesting 6 million dollars 17 for past pain and suffering, disfigurement, 18 disability, loss of enjoyment for life. that 19 was only three of those categories. and i 20 concede the other ones are less, but it is not 21 only 6 million dollars. that number is a 22 reflection of what her suffering is and what her 23 life was worth. and i can guarantee you there is 24 no one in this courtroom who would choose what 25 she had to go through for -- 1 mr. mccarter: objection, your honor. 2 the court: sustained. that is improper 3 argument. 4 ladies and gentlemen, he is not permitted to 5 do that. you should disregard those remarks. 6 mr. uustal: there is a chart with issues not 7 in dispute. it should be called issues that 8 were proven by the plaintiffs over the last 20 9 years. 10 i do not want to get into the details of all 11 the lies because there is already a finding, but 12 there is just one i want to show you because it 13 was a document entitled enough is enough. it is 14 in evidence and mr. mccarter mentioned to you 15 enough is enough. that is what they were saying, 16 enough is enough about people talking about 17 cigarettes being harmful. it is pt0729 if you 18 want to find it in evidence. and back then they 19 were saying there is -- "the fact is there is 20 nothing about smoking or about nicotine in 21 cigarettes that would prevent smokers from 22 quitting." 23 while internal philip morris documents knew 24 that "the cigarette will preempt food in terms 25 of scarcity on the smoker's priority list." 1 enough is enough. and the way to stop this, 2 as mr. jupe said, is lawsuits. 3 mr. mccarter asked jim naugle if he told 4 cindy about me because i sue, or i have lawsuits 5 against tobacco companies. mr. jupe told you 6 that those lawsuits changed philip morris. 7 mr. mccarter: objection, your honor. i'm 8 sorry, counsel. the reference to mr. uustal 9 being those lawsuits. 10 the court: objection is overruled. 11 mr. uustal: it is not done. it is not done. 12 the surgeon general of the united states of 13 america says that they are designing the 14 cigarettes intentionally to maximize addiction. 15 is that okay? it is not done. there is more work 16 to do and you are the ones who are going to do 17 it. it is not easy for anybody to go through 18 what cindy did to get where we are today. 19 mr. mccarter: objection, your honor. 20 the court: i'll permit that. it is 21 overruled. 22 mr. uustal: but she did. and it gives you 23 the opportunity, you the opportunity to do 24 something. to make it stop, which the surgeon 25 general, although they have said repeatedly it is 1 happening, cannot. which the fda has not been 2 able to do. and you heard that the fda wanted 3 cigarette labels that cover half the pack, front 4 and pack, warning labels, five years ago? 5 they are not there. that is what they want. just 6 because the fda has some theoretical legal power 7 does not mean they can get it done. and i think 8 you saw in the evidence all the steps where 9 people could put up road blocks to actually stop 10 something that the fda wants from getting done. 11 mr. jupe told you what changes them. lawsuits. 12 dr. cummings spends his life helping people 13 quit smoking. when he was working at the 14 roswell cancer center and they asked him to take 15 all these documents that were pried out of the 16 companies by the attorney generals, he did not 17 know what was going to come of this. he 18 testified in the first phase, the yearlong case, 19 twice for free. and now whenever people try -- 20 the case did not finish it. it just established 21 the conspiracy and that the cigarettes were 22 harmful and addictive. when smokers try to move 23 forward, get their medical bills and other 24 things not only does he have to fly in to try 25 and testify to what is in those documents, 1 philip morris gets to depose him. you heard 2 from dr. coopersmith, in the last three weeks 3 he is been deposed four times for over 10 hours. 4 and he called it torture. 5 it is not wrong for dr. cummings to charge 6 for his time. the fact that he did not in a 7 yearlong trial and the fact that he is not in 8 this one shows the significance of those trials. 9 lawyers charge for their time, other witnesses 10 did. it is not wrong. he is a man who 11 writes -- the surgeon general asked to write 12 sections of the report. and in order for 13 philip morris to prevail they must convince you 14 that someone who is writing sections of the 15 surgeon general's report is lying to you. 16 the court: you have four minutes, sir. 17 mr. uustal: thank you, your honor. 18 mr. jupe comes in here just like they have 19 done since 1964 and tells you 15 reasons why the 20 surgeon general is wrong today. nothing has 21 changed. 22 they can maximize addiction with how they 23 design cigarettes, the surgeon general says how 24 they do it. he can come in here and say, oh, 25 i've never heard -- that does not do that. he 1 showed you -- this is how they make cigarettes 2 safer, but i showed you the surgeon general 3 saying, this makes cigarettes more addictive, 4 that is how they freebase the nicotine. that is 5 why the surgeon general says, despite them 6 saying there is less nicotine in each cigarette, 7 it is delivered quicker. and there is more 8 nicotine delivered than ever before. 9 the warnings mean no punishment? this is in 10 evidence, pt2023. mr. mccarter suggested there 11 should be no punishment because of the warnings. 12 this is one of the co-conspirators talking about 13 the anti-cigarette lobby, that is what they call 14 the public health authority, "the anticigarette 15 lobby has called the cigarette labeling act a 16 victory for the tobacco industry." those 17 warnings. "one critic entitled her article 'the 18 quiet victory of the cigarette lobby, how it 19 found the best filter yet.'" 20 congress. 21 i'm running out of time so i cannot talk 22 about everything. 23 these rates are staggering, this increase 24 and no one has suggested they are wrong. these 25 rates show that people in this period when 1 cigarette designs were different were dying of 2 emphysema at four times the rate of the 3 nonsmokers, now it is 22 times the rate. 4 last thing. mr. mccarter suggests that 5 compensating cindy for the destruction of her 6 life in some number, and i'm just talking about 7 in terms of the pain, suffering, disfigurement, 8 disability, every one of those you have to 9 consider is out -- in some number over 6 million 10 dollars, 7 or 8, is outrageous. 11 i would suggest to you that when someone 12 comes in here and does not dispute an intentional 13 act of fraud that you know has caused untold 14 suffering and specifically to cindy naugle and 15 suggest they should not be punished for it for 16 any reason whatever, that is outrageous. and two 17 days, two days to them, which they will not even 18 notice. 19 mr. mccarter: objection, your honor. 20 the court: overruled. 21 mr. uustal: i think that it would be 22 outrageous to have a verdict that does not at 23 least suggest to the cigarette companies and all 24 the other companies who are watching this 25 verdict that they can get away by delaying and 1 concealing for decades. 2 thank you for your time. i know it is been a 3 difficult case with all the evidence and changes 4 in it. thank you.
