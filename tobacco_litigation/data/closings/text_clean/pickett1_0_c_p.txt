7 mr. wilner: may it please the court? 8 this is -- this is the time that we have to spend 9 with you. and i -- i'm in cords here, so forgive me. 10 i have an hour to address you now. and after that 11 counsel for r.j. reynolds will have an hour and a half. and 12 then i'll have another half hour. 13 if you see me trying to speak so fast that you 14 cannot understand, i'm trying to get in a lot to say, but 15 i'll -- i promise to slow down. 16 and i want to thank you, members of the jury -- 17 you know, we are in a united states district court, which is 18 a very powerful place to be. and you are in a very powerful 19 position right now. 20 and it is not without, you know, taking you away 21 from your lives and doing that -- we understand all that -- 22 and having to sit here and listen, but perhaps it is been 23 interesting. we hope it has. you know, it is certainly 24 important. and i'm going to talk to you in a little bit of 25 just how important. 28 but the thanks go first, heartfelt. 2 this is a terrific place to be. it is a unique 3 place. and to have the services in this great country of 4 the people we have here to organize this courtroom -- and 5 the judge is on the bench, to be here to conduct these 6 proceedings -- i mean, when you think about it, it is 7 really -- it is almost overwhelming. 8 remember, we have three branches of government in 9 this country. and no one is more powerful than the other. 10 we have the president and the executive. people think 11 that is very important. and it is. we have the congress. 12 they make the laws. very important. we also have the 13 courts. and the courts are very unique. 14 because, unlike congress, which we elect, the 15 courts depend on people we select from the community. and 16 for the time that they are selected, they are as powerful as 17 the congress and as powerful as the president, really, 18 because this is the u.s. district court. and it is a 19 wonderful and a powerful place to be. 20 well, i started off -- what was it, two weeks -- 21 and i drew a line on this chart. and i apologize for being 22 a truly lousy artist. i mean, one of the worst. i really 23 apologize for that, but that is me. 24 and i drew a line. i said this was an american 25 tragedy of, like, unfathomable consequence. and, yet -- and 29 it is the epidemic of lung cancer in the 20th century, 2 starting from almost nothing. 3 and i said, why is it that though everybody has 4 heard that smoking is bad -- i mean, and we have never said 5 otherwise. let me just digress there. 6 never came up here and said that people did not 7 know that smoking was bad for them, and even caused cancer. 8 that is -- there was no question -- luckily, that got 9 through. and i'm not arguing that it -- really, any -- we 10 do not know exactly how much mr. pickett knew at one time or 11 another. but that is not really what i'm talking about. 12 this is a tragedy. and, yet -- although we know 13 cigarettes are dangerous, we do not -- this is not really on 14 people's minds. it is really -- this has really not been as 15 important as it is -- as it is to the people who died, and 16 as it is to all of us. 17 and so as i move on, i'm going to discuss what 18 could -- what should have happened here, and why reynolds is 19 responsible. and when i say responsible, i mean, it is -- 20 i'm not saying that reynolds did -- alone did everything, 21 and i'm not trying to get out of any responsibility that 22 mr. pickett had for smoking, because we know you should not 23 smoke. 24 having said that, i'm here to tell you that 25 reynolds played a substantial role in this acceleration in 30 this epidemic because it did not come from nothing, it did not 2 come from the air, it did not even come -- to make a joke -- 3 from a paint puff. it came from one thing alone. and that 4 was cigarettes. 5 so how did this case start? it is very -- it 6 really is fascinating, what we heard. and, you know, we 7 heard from a lot of witnesses. 8 and i want to jump forward and say -- we have 9 tried -- tried, tried, and tried to bring you the best that 10 there was. 11 and we brought you dr. cummings, who wrote -- who 12 has been a public health official, a public health 13 professional for years, and has played a role in writing the 14 surgeon general reports. that is nationally -- 15 internationally important. that is how important. that is 16 how important we think this case is. 17 that is -- we brought you dr. cummings. we brought 18 you dr. burns, who is a medical doctor, who is a senior 19 editor of many of these surgeon general reports. 20 and we brought you, also, kind of the gold 21 standard, the cream of the crop -- oops -- cream of the 22 crop, and we brought you the reports themselves. and 23 they are actually going to be in evidence for you to read. 24 so you say, well, mr. wilner, we do not have time 25 to read that. and i know that. but you will recognize -- and 31 i'll point out some passages that we did read, that we are 2 ready to go, and there is more -- and let me tell you, first, 3 in -- we stand behind everything in there, warts and all. 4 i mean, who knows? you might find a word in there 5 and say, oh, mr. wilner did not tell us that. well, sure. 6 and i -- here's another thing. 7 i'm -- we are not trying this case on one tiny 8 detail or another. i mean, there may be a hundred details. 9 perhaps counsel for reynolds will pull out one thing or pull 10 out another and say, see, see that, see that word -- we are 11 not. 12 we are trying to try this case on the -- on the 13 big picture, the historical magnitude of what happened here, 14 and as it affected mr. pickett. 15 but this is -- this is the sum of all things. 16 this is -- this is all these reports. these are all these 17 data. and they are all consistent. i mean, somebody's right 18 here and somebody's wrong. 19 we stand behind the public health officials and 20 the public health professionals of this country and 21 internationally. that is -- we take our stand there. 22 i mean, they were here in person. and the books, 23 which have never been -- never been criticized -- i mean, 24 they are -- they represent the finest scientific thought. 25 and we are here to tell you that is our -- that is us. that is 32 us. 2 if you do not like it -- i do not mean you. but if 3 someone does not like it, that is fine. then maybe they are 4 not with us. we cannot make everybody with us, but -- but 5 this is what we stand behind. 6 and when you go back to deliberate, you will 7 actually have all this evidence here. we like to call it 8 evidence here, documentary evidence. 9 and the surgeon general reports are important. 10 and i'm going to point out a couple of things to read. 11 you will also have a bunch of other stuff, including many, but 12 by no means all, of the actual formerly secret documents 13 that went into many of these surgeon general reports after 14 2000 when they became available. 15 so you will be able to read those and look at them 16 and say -- and you will start reading them and you will go, 17 well, it is long, technical, difficult -- we cannot do 18 anything about that. the documents are what they are. 19 they were -- they were exposed not too long ago. 20 in exposing these documents -- and in this trial, my -- my 21 contention is here, we -- we have exposed reynolds for what it 22 is. we have exposed them. 23 i mean -- and dr. gentry came on from reynolds 24 and -- incredibly, he -- he was kind of dismissive. and he 25 said, well, the surgeon general reports, they -- oh, our 33 leadership team, they -- oh, i never really made a 2 presentation. 3 reynolds, huge cigarette company, making four -- 4 four billion packages a year that they know are going to 5 kill one-third of the people -- here is the latest 6 scientific work on why and how it kills, through addiction, 7 the combination of addiction and carcinogens multiplied 8 together. here it is. 9 and he says, well, we do not really follow that. 10 we just -- we do not quite -- we are not in the public health 11 community. 12 what they are in, of course, is -- is, as belied 13 by their -- by the documents we have unearthed from the '50s 14 and '60s, is that their scientists in their labs did figure 15 out the key to addiction, and were able to design their 16 cigarette. 17 why did they do it? and another principle we 18 stand behind, as well as public health, follow the money. 19 there is one thing a corporation does, it does it for profit. 20 it was absolutely in their best interest to try 21 and make a cigarette that did not cause cancer. we agree, 22 as long as they could keep people buying them. 23 so when dr. gentry got up here and said, we tried, 24 we took this out, i agree, fine, i'm not blaming him for 25 that. 34 viii 1 but, see, the one thing that they could never 2 address, because it is the end of their business -- not the 3 end -- it is the end of the size of their business maybe -- 4 is addiction. they could never address addiction, because 5 once -- once you turn it off -- and to quote from 6 claude teague in the famous document that you will read from 7 1982, the nordine study, if the exit gate from our market 8 were ever opened, then we would be out of business almost 9 overnight. 10 the exit gate, the cure for addiction -- the cure 11 for addiction. if you lift the gate -- what a metaphor. 12 their users are inside the gate. they are in prison. 13 they are in prison. 14 and claude teague is saying, we are in a rough 15 place, reynolds. because if somebody finds a cure and let us 16 them out of prison, what is going to happen to our sales? 17 this is the core of what i'm trying to say this 18 whole trial. we follow the money. the money has driven the 19 sale -- sorry, the sales have driven the money. the 20 addiction has driven the sales. the addiction has driven 21 the death. it is a tight circle. 22 and it is the tragedy of the 20th century. and 23 i'm going to -- i'm up here telling you -- i'm up here 24 saying, that the way to stop this -- and i'm going to ask 25 you -- we are going to talk about that, the way to stop 35 viii 1 this -- it appears to be true, according to dr. gentry, that 2 they are not going to stop. 3 it appears to be true that they are not even 4 addressing the addiction, except to make sure that their 5 cigarettes are addicting. 6 it appears to be true that they have no -- they 7 have no interest in listening to the -- to the science, the 8 modern science of addiction. 9 it appears to be true that what they want to do is 10 stay in the old science where addiction was thought to be 11 just a matter of willpower. it just was, just quit. 12 and, see, they like that, because then they can 13 just tell their customers, well, if you do not quit, i'm 14 sorry. well, you did not quit, your fault. 15 we engineered it, we did it to you, we know about 16 it, we designed a product in a way -- and if you read the 17 surgeon general report it says it, it says it from the 18 surgeon general. it says their design of the product has 19 increased addiction. 20 so reynolds would love to be back in the old days 21 when addiction was not understood. yes, there were 22 newspaper articles from -- or something from 1900 that said 23 addiction. but that is not science. that is just popular 24 use. 25 and there was -- people did use a word sometimes 36 viii 1 to mean habit. and who knows what people say. but 2 science -- science, the science was up until recently -- and 3 i'm going to give you the document trail, where it was -- 4 where they did the work over in -- in england and they 5 passed it down, came over here. 6 it said -- it was technical work but it meant 7 cigarettes were not just addictive, they were physically 8 addictive. did not give it to the surgeon general. the 9 surgeon general writes in '64, you will have this, it is a 10 habit. why is it a habit? it is mental. they called it 11 psychic, if you remember. mental. not physical. 12 well, that is wrong. and i said, i'll stand by the 13 surgeon general. yeah, they got it right later. but they 14 did not know about that. reynolds had that information. 15 did not turn it over. okay. 16 they want to stay there. they will give us -- 17 they will tell us, oh, addiction -- oh, yes, it is addictive. 18 but, really, what they want to say is, anybody can quit, so 19 do not really bother us about it. we sell it. we are like 20 the -- you know, the cruise ship that just turned over, you 21 know, in the dark of night in the cold water. people fell 22 out, jumped out. some swam for it and made it, some swam 23 for it and could not make it. some could not swim. 24 reynolds is the cruise ship that just threw 25 everybody in the water. and they want to say, oh, you 37 could not quit? well, tough luck, you died, was not our 2 fault. wait a minute. what put them in the water? how did 3 they get there? 4 they got there because you sold them a product 5 that you knew would addict them, and then you went and said, 6 uh, you did not try; you did not try enough; why did not you 7 swim harder? why did not you swim -- i know -- maybe you 8 could not see where you were swimming, maybe you did not know 9 which way -- oh, that is your fault. you should have swam 10 harder. you should have known what direction to swim. 11 and, you know, the tragedy is if you are a 12 powerful man, like mr. pickett was, powerful man, started 13 his own business, came up from very little, had -- had the 14 greatest kid in the world, you know -- greatest kid in the 15 world, oliver pickett, jr., the greatest daughter in the 16 world, cindy voss, never had an obstacle, according to what 17 we heard, never had an obstacle that this guy could not 18 handle. he was a tough guy. he was a good guy. he was 19 kind but he was tough. 20 he was -- this -- he could do -- his force of 21 will -- and you know reynolds even wants to say that, they 22 wanted to pump it up, oh -- i agree. one thing i agree 23 with, wonderful man, cut down, 52. at 20 -- you will have the 24 mortality tables to look at, 27 years of life yet to go, 25 according to the mortality table, 27. that is a lot. and 27 38 to the best friend in the world, you know, that is a lot. 2 that is a lot. 3 anyway, here was a tough guy. and we are going to 4 hear -- and we will discuss it to some degree. you have heard 5 it. and, you know, i'm not going to be able to recite all 6 the testimony. it is been two weeks. but did he try to 7 quit? oh, absolutely. 8 does everyone remember every day that he tried to 9 quit? of course not. were there times when probably using 10 our normal judgment of how people act, he was so sick of 11 being -- of being controlled on something that he could not 12 beat, humiliated -- every time -- if he had to tell somebody 13 i tried to quit again and i failed, i tried to quit this 14 morning and i smoked by the afternoon. i tried to quit -- 15 last night i said i would not do it and this morning i smoked 16 again -- how horrible you feel if you are a person who is 17 used to doing what you have set your mind to do. how 18 humiliating. 19 it is like you are a great swimmer and you are in the 20 water and you do not know where to go, you are thrown off the 21 cruise ship and nobody said there is land and you hate -- you 22 hate to admit it. and, worse, the people around you are 23 hating you for ruining your health. they are hating you. 24 they are frustrated. 25 and we need to understand how -- how this works. 39 and, you know, there was a time -- there was a time in the 2 old days -- the old days, where alcohol, for example, as an 3 addiction -- and it is a terrible addiction, does not affect 4 everyone who drinks by any means, but it is a terrible 5 addiction for the people who are addicted. 6 and we used to want to just kill these people, 7 stop drinking, stop drinking. you know, there is something 8 wrong with you, you are not trying hard enough, you -- just 9 stop it. 10 and over time -- and that is not to say that we 11 do not still do that, but over time we have begun to realize 12 that, wait a minute, you are dealing with something inside 13 the person. 14 many of these people who are addicted to alcohol 15 fight this all their lives, not because they are bad people 16 or because they are not trying but because there is something 17 in their genes or something that has caused them to be that 18 way and they hate it, they hate themselves for being that 19 way. and it takes -- it is a struggle. 20 many of them keep going in for counseling and a 21 certain drug that might help and so forth and out and in and 22 out and in and some beat it, some do not. 23 that is alcohol. not saying it is exactly the same. 24 i'm not -- i'm not trying to push this -- push one, you 25 know, simile too far. i'm just saying it is our attitude 40 towards addiction. 2 and, unfortunately, in the nicotine context -- 3 probably because when you smoke you do not fall over -- well, 4 yeah, you know, you do one day but you do not fall over that 5 day, you could smoke most of your life until you get a 6 horrible, horrible cough or a horrible visit to an 7 oncologist who says, sorry, there is nothing you can do. 8 i mean, that is -- at least with alcohol you kind 9 of know, you know, you are falling over, you cannot drive, you 10 lose your job. not with tobacco. with cigarettes it is 11 insidious, because you can be smoking and you know -- you are 12 like in a car going over the side of a cliff, i want to 13 stop, but you -- but you can still keep working. 14 so you say one more cigarette i'll just feel 15 better, you know, i'll feel better. if i can just have one 16 more, then i'll try to quit. is it human weakness? yes. 17 are we all affected? perhaps. are some people able to quit 18 and others cannot? yes. 19 claude teague says many but not most are able to 20 quit. we agree with that. 1982, reynolds. many, but not 21 most are able -- said most would like to. many but not most 22 are able. 23 they admitted that in a document they never 24 thought we would see. and they are right. and that is the 25 modern science. if we look at the modern science, that is 41 the modern science. 2 it is not a character weakness. it is not something 3 that you just can try harder. how do you get over it? 4 well, we talked earlier when dr. cummings was on 5 about different drugs, about a nicorette patch, about gum -- 6 sorry, nicorette gum, a patch. 7 how is it that all of that came out -- came about 8 relatively late, like the late '80s, some of it in the '90s, 9 some of it mr. pickett never saw? 10 reynolds has stayed in the age before the modern 11 treatment of addiction. it wants to blame mr. pickett for 12 not getting out of the water and being able to swim to 13 shore. 14 and, you know what, we are happy -- i'll show you 15 on the verdict form, if you blame mr. pickett, also, for 16 being a kid who experimented to his death with cigarettes. 17 they also want to blame him for that as a 13-year-old kid. 18 and they want to say, oh, look, the american cancer society 19 told him not to smoke, and, you know what, we are not -- we 20 do not disagree with that. there was plenty of stuff out 21 there. 22 it was not all perfectly as clear as ms. hoffman 23 said it was, but, sure, we all heard it, of one kind or 24 another, in one ear we heard it. 25 what did we hear in the other ear that she did not 42 want to talk about? 250 billion dollars worth of -- you 2 should smoke. it is the -- that your heroes smoked. the 3 baseball players smoked. the boxers smoked. the people on 4 the street that you see smoked. the cool guys smoked in the 5 movies. 6 it is so obvious in presenting to the young mind 7 when they get out of school -- okay. they have heard lots of 8 things at school. and, again, i'm not trying to get out of 9 it. blame him some if you want. but let us look at the 10 whole picture. 11 so he is in school and he listens to the teacher 12 and the teacher says eat your vegetables and do not smoke. 13 fine. he goes home. what is he see? nothing but television 14 ads for smoking. 15 now, how -- how are you supposed to reconcile that 16 as a -- as a 12-year-old? how does that even make any sense 17 to you? your teacher says, do not smoke, eat your 18 vegetables, fine, but then ted kluszewski, the strongest 19 baseball player in the country, yeah, i like them, i love 20 them. what are you supposed to think as a 12-year-old? you 21 think, well, if they are good enough for him, look at what he 22 can do. 23 yeah, i'll eat my vegetables. yeah, i'm just 24 going to try them. and you know, the funny thing is, they 25 try it. it is cool. it is a cool thing. and you know they 43 get hooked. and no one knows which -- how many will get 2 hooked. but a lot. and some of them will struggle for 3 their whole lives and many will die. that is -- that is what 4 it is. that is the reality of it. 5 and the promotion to the youth is a pediatric 6 disease and it is reynolds' fault for doing it. it is all 7 their fault. that is one hundred percent their fault. they had no 8 business marketing and they -- to youth. and most of their 9 markets is to youth. why? because adults do not start to 10 smoke. if they have not started by your late -- by your 11 mid -- late teens or early 20s, you are just not -- they just 12 do not even care, just so few people start. 13 you start early. it is a pediatric disease. and 14 there is another surgeon general report that came out a week 15 and a half ago. 16 it is the 2012 surgeon general report and it is 17 marked as exhibit 1302. and it is all about how the tobacco 18 companies got to the youth, children, teenagers, and how 19 they designed their product and their marketing to get to 20 kids, started. 21 and when they started, they would make them into 22 valuable assets, lifelong smokers who bought a pack a day 23 driven by their addiction until they die. 24 well, i digressed for about a half an hour before 25 i even started with what i wanted to tell you. but i'll go 44 back. 2 i'm right about a half an hour, right? it is a 3 good time for a two-second pause. 4 okay. let us -- having said what i was going to 5 try and say, i'll try to -- try to discuss what it is you will 6 be asked to do. and then we will go from there. 7 so at the -- as soon as these closing remarks are 8 done, his honor will address you with instructions. and the 9 instructions will give you the law. and anything i say 10 about what i feel the instructions will be or how to 11 understand them, that is me, but his honor is the law in this 12 courtroom. 13 and anything i say that is -- that is incorrect, 14 it would be a mistake. i would not try to do it, but 15 absolutely it is -- it is -- his honor's instructions are 16 your binding instructions. 17 so before i tell you -- we discuss these 18 instructions, i'll go back one step. and that is here. 19 this case started a long time ago. 20 and there is testimony about it from oliver 21 pickett, jr., tadpole pickett. and he said that his father 22 had gone -- had been diagnosed with lung cancer in 1996. 23 and he came -- came into my office. this was a long time 24 ago. 25 and according to his son he said, i feel like 45 they have added something to cigarettes that made me smoke 2 them, to keep me smoking them. i feel they have added 3 something. 4 here was a man -- a strong man who was unable, to 5 the humiliation and the consternation of everyone around 6 him -- many people did not smoke, including his son and his 7 brother gavin. 8 and, incidentally, his brother gavin challenged 9 anything these witnesses said. i mean, this is warts and 10 all. 11 if we had scripted anything, we would have 12 scripted it different, i mean gavin said, oh, i do not even 13 think he tried, you know, tried to quit. 14 i mean, if we had scripted it, we would have said, 15 oh, he tried in the morning, tried in the afternoon. that is 16 how warts -- that is true testimony. and it teaches us to 17 learn, because you could see gavin crying inside for how 18 much he was frustrated with his brother, because his brother 19 at that time certainly was knowing this was a horrible thing 20 that he was into, and the one thing in his life that he had 21 not been able to break. that was the digression. 22 so let us go to -- you will be given -- or you will 23 be addressed by his honor and given instructions. some of 24 these instructions are in what we call legalese, which means 25 they are hard to understand, and others are very clear. and 46 we will do the best we can. 2 and then i want to put up the verdict form, which 3 is what you will be asked to sign, asked to agree on. you 4 have to all agree and sign. so i would like to go through 5 with it -- go through this. and maybe we can put it up. 6 mr. lantinberg: we have got it up. i have it. 7 mr. wilner: it is up? oh, well, i'm glad somebody 8 is faster than i am. 9 so this -- this says: do you find -- this is the 10 first question: do you find from a preponderance of the 11 evidence that mr. pickett, sr. was addicted to cigarettes 12 containing nicotine; yes or no? 13 reynolds has put up no witness at all to contrast 14 that. there is been nobody here who said that this is not a 15 pattern of addiction. 16 and if the argument is, well, you could not quit, 17 that has nothing to do with it. addicted people quit and 18 addicted people do not quit. it has nothing to do with it. 19 once you throw them in the water, you cannot then 20 go back and say, oh, yeah, i threw you in the water, but you 21 should have swam harder. well, he swam pretty darn hard. 22 a preponderance of the evidence, what does that 23 mean? it just means that you have to have more evidence on 24 one side than the other. it does not mean absolute proof. 25 it is like the guy for the body shop said, we cannot 47 find the molecule. that is not what the law requires. 2 it is -- it is reasonable -- it is preponderance, meaning 3 what is more likely than not. so this is a no-brainer, we 4 feel, because there has been nobody to come in who said 5 otherwise. 6 do you find from a preponderance of the evidence 7 that mr. pickett's addiction to cigarettes containing 8 nicotine was a legal cause of his lung cancer and death? 9 well, i mean, sure. what else? mr. pickett's own 10 body? yes. how is it not? i think reynolds will say, oh, 11 well, it was not the addiction; it was mr. pickett smoking. 12 well, okay. why did he smoke? well, he smoked for a lot of 13 reasons, maybe. maybe he liked the image at first. 14 but if anyone thinks that mr. pickett was not 15 addicted and driven to smoke day by day, then no one in the 16 world is addicted, because this was the most classic pattern 17 in the world. so the answer seems to be pretty clear yes. 18 next, if you -- oops. 19 mr. lantinberg: i'm sorry. 20 mr. wilner: if you answered yes to this question, 21 proceed to question three. now, here's where it gets 22 interesting. 23 if you answered yes to those first two questions, 24 mr. pickett then joins what is called the engle class. 25 now, one of the things that we are here -- well, 48 one of the interesting things about being here is we do not 2 have to -- or you do not have to decide in and of itself 3 whether cigarettes, including winston, are defective. 4 you do not have to decide whether reynolds was 5 negligent. why? because that has been decided in a class 6 that was tried earlier. 7 remember i said mr. pickett came in in 1996 and 8 said, you know, something's in these cigarettes, well, it is 9 taken to now to get this class through the courts. that is 10 just the way it is. 11 and if you answer yes, the classes of all people 12 in florida who have died or been -- been injured by 13 addiction to cigarettes -- so if that is the case -- and this 14 is the clearest case, i'd submit to you, imaginable that 15 this is the case of addiction -- then he is now part of this 16 class, he is brought into the class. 17 once he is brought into the class, then what the 18 class decided -- what the jury and the class decided is then 19 binding, and that includes cigarettes are defective, the 20 companies, including reynolds, were negligent, and they 21 conspired to conceal the truth. 22 and his honor will read these to you. they are 23 binding. some of you are thinking, well, how do i find 24 cigarettes are defective? it is already been done. it is 25 part of this class. once he is in the class, he gets the 49 benefit of these findings. 2 so you say to me, well, mr. wilner, why did you 3 put on all this evidence if it is already been done? that is 4 a good question. and you will see when we get further on the 5 verdict why i did it. 6 so let us go a little further. do you find from a 7 preponderance of the evidence that negligence on the part of 8 the defendant was a legal cause? well, you will be asked to 9 assume that there was negligence, because that is part of the 10 class finding. and whether it is on the part -- whether it 11 was a legal cause. 12 so you will be asked what -- you will have to refer to 13 the instructions to define legal cause. okay? so what is a 14 legal cause? 15 well, his honor will tell you, if i get it 16 straight here, that a legal cause -- in order to prove that 17 addiction to smoking cigarettes containing nicotine was a 18 legal cause of the decedent's death or in order to prove 19 that negligence was the legal cause, using the word legal 20 cause as a term, the plaintiff must prove that such 21 addiction or such negligence directly and in natural 22 continuous sequence produced or contributed substantially to 23 producing such death, so it can be reasonably said that but 24 for the addiction the death would not have occurred, or in 25 the case of negligence -- but for the negligence, the death 50 would not have occurred. in order to be regarded as a legal 2 cause of death, addiction, or negligence, need not be the 3 only cause. 4 so the key to legal cause is that there are always 5 other causes. they all can combine. all this is is a 6 statement that it need not be the only cause. 7 addiction -- or we have actually gone on to the next 8 instruction about the negligence -- may be a legal cause of 9 death even though it operates in combination with the act of 10 another, some natural cause, or some other cause, if the 11 addiction contributes substantially to producing the death, 12 or if the negligence contributes substantially. 13 first you will be asked about addiction being a 14 legal cause and then negligence being a legal cause. so if 15 the negligence contributes substantially, then it is a legal 16 cause. 17 sorry for the legalese, but legal cause is defined 18 by these instructions as a substantial factor. not the only 19 factor, just a substantial factor. 20 okay. let us go back to the verdict. 21 so how about -- so number three: was their 22 negligence a substantial factor? well, their negligence 23 was. and we have talked about it and talked about it. 24 first it was getting the children to smoke. then 25 it was designing the product to be addictive and keeping 51 people addicted. 2 and many of these side things we have talked about, 3 including the infiltration of the ama and not -- not giving 4 straight answers to the public health community, hiding 5 things from the surgeon general, that is all part of that 6 negligence, all combining -- not one thing in particular, 7 all combining. 8 number four: do you find from a preponderance of 9 the evidence that the defendant's placement of cigarettes on 10 the market that were defective -- the way that is phrased is 11 you are to assume that those cigarettes were defective. 12 so -- oops. is that the right one? 13 mr. lantinberg: it is from the jury instructions. 14 mr. wilner: well, go ahead and put the verdict 15 back on. 16 okay. do you find from a preponderance of the 17 evidence that the defendant's placement of cigarettes on the 18 market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous was a 19 legal cause of the death? 20 well, this seems to be pretty much a given if you 21 answered the first part, that addiction to cigarettes 22 containing nicotine was a legal cause of the death, which 23 seems obvious. 24 so if -- if you answered that and you are given 25 that the cigarettes were defective, then the only 52 question -- then there is no more question. it really has 2 dissolved into the same question. 3 why are we here? because there are a lot of 4 formalities in court. and we would suggest to you there is not 5 any other way to understand it. that is just: do you find 6 that the -- that the placement of the cigarettes on the 7 market -- well, yeah. 8 i mean, without the cigarettes on the market, you 9 do not have the -- the addiction, you do not have the disease, 10 and you do not have the death. 11 so, sure, once -- once you have found that this is 12 part of a class, then this -- then question number four is 13 automatic, we suggest. there is no really other way to -- 14 all right. no other way to understand it. 15 number five -- and i will not go over this in too 16 much detail. this is whether concealment or omission of 17 material information concerning the health effects or the 18 addictive nature -- you can decide that for yourself, 19 whether knowledge of whether it is really physically 20 addictive would have really saved him. that is something you 21 can decide. 22 i mean, number four is a given. number five, you 23 know, i think it is pretty clear, but you can discuss it. 24 number six: do you find a preponderance of the 25 evidence -- from a preponderance that he relied to his 53 detriment on an act taken in further of the agreement to 2 conceal or omit concerning health effects or addictive 3 nature of cigarettes? 4 well, we have not talked a whole lot about it. 5 you will see from the documents and from reading the surgeon 6 general's report that there was a concerted effort here to 7 keep this information. 8 we are not arguing ignorance of cancer. i'm never 9 going to do that, because everyone here knows that 10 cigarettes cause cancer. 11 as to whether the knowledge that addiction was a 12 serious brain disease that could be treated medically, 13 maybe, but at least you would have to try, that you should not be 14 just blaming yourself all the time and getting frustrated, 15 whether that would have made a difference -- we suggest it 16 would. 17 based -- now, this -- this is -- is another 18 interesting part. now, assuming that you answer those -- 19 one of those questions yes -- and i would suggest number 20 four really does not have any other answer -- based on a 21 preponderance of the evidence -- what percentage of fault 22 was a legal cause of death of oliver pickett do you allocate 23 to each of the parties? and these have to add up to 100 24 percent. and here -- the first thing i said is no one is 25 blameless. and oliver pickett is not either. 54 and if he should have done something else, if he 2 should have been able to quit and could not, if he should not 3 have started smoking, because some of us did not, you know, 4 we did not happen to have those inputs, whatever -- but 5 whatever you think he did wrong, you put a percentage there. 6 we will live with it. 7 i would suggest the percentage is no greater than 8 twenty percent. but if you feel it is, that is where you put it. 9 if you want to blame oliver pickett for his death, that is 10 where you put the percentage. that is all i can tell you. 11 you have to compare it with what reynolds did. 12 and what reynolds did was a lot. it was a lot. it was -- 13 it was premeditated lots. 14 so you put that percentage. and do not be 15 confused. if you really go in there and you really are 16 thinking this is -- oliver pickett has to be responsible, 17 then this is where you put it. 18 next. this is the -- based on the preponderance 19 of the evidence, what amount of damages do you find, if any, 20 with respect to the following elements? 21 next. oliver pickett's loss of companionship, 22 protection, and his mental pain and suffering as a result of 23 his father -- that is -- we would say that is 27 years of 24 losing your best friend, 240,000 hours. it is a serious 25 thing. 55 how much? you know what, there is no way to tell 2 you that. you use your humanity, use your experience, use 3 your judgment. it is 27 years lost, and watching a horrible, 4 horrible event of the strongest man dying a horrible death. 5 so put a price on it. we would say not more than 6 $6 million. anything more might be excessive. but i'm 7 serious about that. 8 next, cindy lee voss -- i'm sorry, cindy lee voss' 9 loss of companionship -- the daughter, cindy lee. she is 10 been here. she testified. they tried to make it seem like 11 she did not know her father very well. okay. 12 i do not need to discuss it. this is humanity. 13 and it is -- and whatever's right, do what is right, that is 14 all. do not do too much. do not do not enough. do what is 15 right. 16 but number nine is really the one i wanted to talk 17 about for about three minutes here, because this -- this 18 case is two cases. one is the one above. it is mr. pickett. 19 it is tadpole pickett. it is cindy lee voss. it is their 20 personal story. and it is a tragedy. that is the first case. 21 question number nine is the second case. in that 22 question you are empowered to tell the world -- more than 23 that, tell reynolds' management why -- if you feel that this 24 is not the right conduct for an american corporation to be 25 doing what it did for these number of years, this is how you 56 answer that question, because what we have tried to do is 2 we have tried to bring to you the resources of the public 3 health community. 4 we have tried to deputize you for a short time to be 5 agents of the public health community, to test your 6 knowledge. you now know more about the history of this. 7 you now know more about what happened than almost any group 8 of people, because you have been to graduate school and 9 postgraduate school on the history -- the horrible history 10 that led up to the greatest epidemic that we have seen. 11 now, the surgeon general cannot award damages 12 against reynolds. that does not exist. so the surgeon 13 general of the united states, public health service, is part 14 of the executive branch. 15 they do not have the power to actually go to 16 reynolds and have something come into their leadership 17 meeting -- the next meeting that says, wait a minute, we 18 cannot have business as usual anymore, cannot do it. 19 that power rests with you. is not that odd how 20 that -- maybe that is really a wonderful thing. the power 21 comes from the u.s. district court to you. the power comes 22 from you having seen and having access to the real story. 23 and this is the real story. 24 the power does not come to people who have not been 25 in that situation, people off the street who do not know what 57 really happened. they may have lots of opinions. who 2 knows? who cares? 3 and maybe you had opinions before you walked in. 4 but this is different. this is not about an idle opinion. 5 this is for real. this stuff is life and death. and 6 although i've joked about my dog-eared copies of stuff, 7 it -- it is life and death to people. the word to get out is 8 critical. and in number nine you have a chance to get the 9 word out. you can send reynolds a message. 10 now, what happens if you say yes? if you say yes, 11 then in -- we have a brief -- we have a pause in these 12 proceedings and we, at a -- at a soon -- immediately after, 13 we address the amount. 14 you do not actually have to put an amount. you 15 just put a yes or a no. and you will be given the instruction 16 that determines whether you should give punitive damages -- 17 award punitive damages. and his honor will give it to you. 18 i'm not going to try to repeat it. 19 my boiling this down is this, did reynolds do -- 20 in designing this cigarette to be addictive, in barraging 21 the young people in this country with image after image 22 telling them to smoke, in not being straight with the 23 surgeon general, not giving the surgeon general all of their 24 research and perpetuated old science about addiction, did 25 reynolds do that by accident? 58 and, if so, you would fill the top part of the 2 verdict form -- we expect you would award damages to 3 mr. pickett. but if it is by accident, it is not punitive. 4 but -- it is a big but -- if this was done 5 intentionally -- if it was intentional, then that has to be 6 yes. and that is my -- that is my boiling down of what 7 you will hear. if it was something that reynolds did for 8 profit, then we would say it is only one answer. 9 after your -- after question nine you sign and 10 date your verdict. and, you know, we go on about our 11 business, and you do. 12 oliver tadpole pickett and cindy voss, they cannot 13 come back. this is -- this is it for them. reynolds will 14 have a meeting. they will have a meeting. they will have a 15 meeting. the next leadership counsel that dr. gentry is on, 16 he will walk in -- will not be carrying this, we hope -- we 17 think -- and the question will be at that next meeting: how 18 did that case go? 19 it is up to you to supply the answer. and if you 20 want them to say, oh, it went fine, it went fine, we did not 21 have any trouble, let us go ahead and keep that machine 22 rolling, let us go keep putting the winstons out there with 23 their -- with their fake little holes there, let us go -- 24 let us go -- keep putting the flavorants in there to addict 25 the kids, let us keep going, we are making money, that is one 59 answer. that is your answer. 2 but if you would like them to say something else, if 3 you would like them to look down and say, whoa, what is going on, 4 what is going on here, and say, you know what is going on, the 5 truth is finally coming out, finally you have been exposed. 6 now what are you going to do about it? 7 thank you. 13 mr. wilner: may it please the court? 14 well, we have now heard from reynolds. and 15 apparently they are not repentant, apparently. 16 mr. geise: your honor, i object. that is in 17 violation of a pretrial order and is an improper closing 18 reference. 19 the court: well, i'm uncertain. 20 watch your remarks, mr. wilner. go ahead with 21 your argument. 22 mr. wilner: by that i mean have they taken an 23 ounce of responsibility? 24 mr. geise: and that is directly in violation of 25 the pretrial ruling. 119 mr. wilner: i cannot imagine, your honor. he 2 talked about our responsibility. 3 the court: i'll presently overrule that 4 objection. let me hear your argument, mr. wilner. go 5 ahead. 6 mr. wilner: reynolds seems to think that it had 7 no role in -- in this. they seem to want to argue that they 8 were not really there or they did not do anything. 9 and so what we heard was there is no connection 10 between what reynolds did and what happened to mr. pickett. 11 and i was challenged to say, what is the bridge? 12 well, i do not care, really, what reynolds said, 13 because what they told other people and what they did in 14 secret were two different things. 15 but the bridge is right here. mr. pickett, every 16 day, twice through -- all of these, held them to his lips, 17 lighted them, and inhaled the smoke that reynolds had tested 18 very carefully. 19 and when he did that, he activated these vent 20 holes and changed the chemistry of that smoke, which they 21 had very carefully calculated. 22 he -- as he smoked, the smoke that they had very 23 carefully calculated how it would be delivered through deep 24 inhalation into his lungs, went in there. it caused 25 reactions that went to his brain. and chronically, over a 120 long period of time, it developed his receptors, the 2 receptors increased in number, and he became addicted. 3 now, is it just us saying that? no. in fact, 4 there -- there was a challenge, i think, to dr. burns, who 5 said that he was addicted and his addiction caused his 6 disease. and there was a challenge to dr. cummings, a great 7 public health professional. 8 so let us take a look just for a moment at the 9 medical records, which are joint exhibit 246, because they 10 were -- they have been overlooked. number one -- we will show 11 them one at a time real quick. 12 you know, it is our belief in this case that 13 listening to reynolds' arguments is sometimes like being in 14 a fun house mirror or something. 15 i mean, it is not -- it is just twisted. it is not 16 reality. this is reality over here: left upper lung mass, 17 very suspicious -- it is poorly focused. i wonder if we can 18 focus that. thanks. 19 very suspicious for bronchogenic carcinoma. 20 that is the cancer that killed him. number two, nicotine 21 addiction, right along beside it. why would the doctor say 22 that? it is obvious. it is obvious. of course that is the 23 cause of this epidemic. left lung mass, same thing, 24 nicotine addiction. 25 next. the patient was discharged with nicoderm 121 patch. what was the date of this? '95. he was discharged 2 with a patch to cure his addiction. it did not cure it. 3 tough. but so addicted he was that, after 4 diagnosing with cancer, they sent him home with a patch. 5 now, do you think he wanted it? of course he did not. i'll 6 show you another one. 7 next. oh, this is the medical record from '95. 8 two-packs-a-day smoker for 40 years. so there is no question 9 about this. if he is not an addicted smoker, there are no 10 addicted smokers, we are back in the fun house mirror of 11 reynolds. 12 next. this is interesting. on the first -- on 13 the 20th of january, number-one month, 1996 -- this is 14 during the course of his treatment and after he was told 15 that there would be no future -- call from patient 16 requesting patches to quit smoking. 17 so this poor man, who now had no longer a future, 18 still wanted to try and get the monkey off his back and get 19 out of the prison that he was in. 20 so what is this talk that he quit or -- i mean, he 21 might have quit at times and relapsed. we know that. but 22 in 1996, with cancer in his body -- and this -- this 23 demolishes reynolds' idea, oh, he just loved it so much he 24 just decided to forget it. really? 25 called again. called from home, you know. and 122 it is unclear whether he was told beforehand about the 2 ability to get a patch and what to do about it. 3 reynolds keeps blaming oliver pickett for not 4 having a plan. what plan did they offer? what was the 5 plan? a patch? that did not come along until later. 6 you see, all of that is the old way of thinking 7 about addiction, where you just threw them down and walked 8 away. it works for some. but for the other 60 million 9 people who are, i would say, heavily addicted, or sometimes 10 hopelessly addicted, it does not work. 11 what is to determine whether you are one of the 12 people who is lucky enough that you could break it? nobody 13 knows that. but we do know that for no fault of your own 14 you are in the prison. a lot of people are. 15 in fact, most of the smokers today would like to 16 quit. to echo claude teague again, many, but not most, are 17 able to do so. 18 would you put up the young lady -- the young man 19 and the young lady? okay. so reynolds says, look, we 20 do not -- we cannot prove which advertisements might have 21 affected his young impressionable mind. and that is right. 22 it is part of this distorted view of reality 23 that -- that anyone would ever know which individual 24 advertisements would be seen on what day. no one knows 25 that. 123 but when you pour these things out there by the -- 2 by the millions and then you wonder, does it work, well, why 3 would you spend billions of dollars if it did not work? so 4 how is this -- what is this about? 5 here is a gentleman on a beach with a young lady. 6 winston tastes good, like a cigarette should. it does not 7 say anything that cigarettes are good, bad, or indifferent 8 in words. 9 a picture, as we have -- as the advertising 10 industry in this country has learned for years, a picture 11 like this is worth all the words in the world. 12 and this is just a still picture. can you imagine 13 how powerful a -- a television commercial actually showing 14 the people? 15 now, how many young kids -- and maybe mr. pickett. 16 we do not know about this one. there is so many of them -- 17 kept this image in their mind -- it was burned in their 18 mind, the idea that smoking was cool, that we would get the 19 girl, that we would be there on the beach? we would be on the 20 beach. we would be lighting her cigarette. everything 21 would be good. 22 but, you know, inside this package there was an 23 early death lurking. how horrible. this was the scene of 24 life, enjoy life, have another cigarette. 25 and you will see the ads here. there is santa clause 124 giving out cigarettes, oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, so much fun. 2 so much. it would be fun -- it would be fun if one-third of 3 the people who bought these were not dead from it. then it 4 would be a real riot. 5 so how is it that reynolds can sit here -- can 6 stand here and say that the american cancer society -- oh, 7 it had a film. it did. how great. and reader's digest -- 8 and, by god, so happy that reader's digest existed or else 9 the curve of death would be even higher. 10 but, no, there are -- yeah, it was there. and we 11 hope oliver pickett saw it. except if he turned out to be 12 one of these people who was so addicted that he could not 13 stop, as apparently he was, it just made him more unhappy 14 with himself. but look back at this. 15 so an impressionable mind -- you know, winston 16 flavor gets a big hand everywhere. this is just really, 17 really nice, really fun. and this was the way of life. 18 this was reality in 1950 -- this is 1957. it 19 was not reality in the sense that there were really people on 20 the beach -- maybe there were. but it was reality in that 21 you could not walk outside without seeing things like this, 22 every other billboard, every other magazine full of them, 23 your television full of them. 24 now, am i saying that this is a bad thing to 25 advertise? well, yes. because if you believe that reynolds 125 knew in 1957 what they are claiming the plaintiffs and 2 everyone else seemed to have known, what the american cancer 3 society was trying to get the message out -- this was right 4 around the time of cps-i, one of the largest studies in 5 history. and they had shown a huge increase in lung cancer. 6 and that is available to reynolds. 7 in 1952 you saw -- and, incidentally, i was 8 challenged for not cross-examining dr. gentry enough. well, 9 we are kind of limited here. dr. gentry had the opportunity 10 to bring out whatever documents he wanted with his own 11 attorneys. 12 but, remember, there was also the question of 13 dr. cook, who was on tape -- or on video. and he discussed 14 a lot of the corporate history. a lot of it was very 15 interesting. 16 and there was also mr. heimann who denied 17 everything. so if you really want to see what reality was 18 for the cigarette companies, it was mr. heimann in 19- -- 19 who was president of american, now part of reynolds, in 1980 20 who just said, no, nothing's true, nothing's true, the 21 surgeon general is dead wrong. that is really what they did. 22 and if you want to hear -- want to see another 23 interesting point from reynolds -- and i'm going to get to 24 this nonsense in a minute. but the way that -- that they 25 have always twisted reality -- look at exhibit no. 450. 126 and you will see as late as 1979 that they were 2 coming out with a whole list of anti surgeon general pseudo 3 science, junk science articles, saying, well, you cannot 4 really prove it, it is not one hundred percent, you do not know -- and 5 it is a lot of -- a lot of what we heard here from their old 6 friend, dr. brusick, who used to work in their -- for them 7 doing their work, who said, oh, you cannot prove it because 8 you do not know which molecule hits you. so i'll get back to 9 that in a minute. 10 but so here they go from the early '50s with 11 knowledge aforethought, knowing that they want kids to 12 smoke, going after them as hard as they can. 13 and we totally agree that the cancer society was 14 there whispering in one ear. only there was loud music 15 playing in the other. some people could hear this more than 16 they heard that. some heard that more than they heard this. 17 you know, how did they gauge their success? by 18 the amount of people that they got to smoke. because that 19 was their sell. and now they want to say, well, we were 20 successful. but that was not -- that was all his fault, the 21 fact that we were very good at marketing this product. 22 so -- several things. now, reynolds now says, oh, 23 it was the body shop. and i want -- let me take a moment to 24 address that, because, of all the distortions we have heard, 25 that is a big one. 127 the body shop -- well, no one denied that there 2 were potential carcinogens in the body shop. let us go over 3 this one more time. 4 this iarc is charged with identifying any cancer. 5 and we are one hundred percent behind it. and so is dr. burns, 6 public health professional, one hundred percent. 7 how much cancer is in body shops? good question. 8 well, you do not just go through and list what might be 9 there, because you do not know the concentrations or how it is 10 used and everything else. 11 so the way you do it -- one of the big branches of 12 science to determine this causation issue is epidemiology. 13 so you go through and you count hundreds of thousands of 14 people who have been in body shops, some of them all their 15 lives, some of them not all their lives, some of them wore 16 the masks all the time, some of them did not, some of them 17 sanded, some of them did not. 18 when you get 100,000 people, you have covered all 19 the possibilities. and then you see what the lung cancer 20 rate is. and the highest they got was about 1.4 over the 21 background rate of 35, which turned out to be something 22 like -- depending on which calculation, 49 or 70 -- we went 23 back and forth, but not more than 70 out of 100,000 per 24 year, compared to 829 -- 70 versus 829 for the cigarettes. 25 for some reason dr. brusick just did not want to 128 get there, just did not want to think about that. and one of 2 the reasons was i do not think he was familiar with it. 3 but reynolds confuses -- by mentioning csi 4 confuses what we are here for. this is not a criminal case. 5 we are not charged with beyond a reasonable doubt or beyond 6 all possible doubt. no one knows what molecule hit -- was 7 hit by what. we know that this happens -- 829 per 100,000 8 per year dying of lung cancer who are in mr. pickett's 9 smoking group. 10 we know that 40, maybe -- or 30 or 49 or even 70 11 painters who do not smoke might get lung cancer. and 35 of 12 those would be people who got it anyway from no exposure. 13 and, in fact, ultimately the reasoning was 14 exposed, and that was even the people in this -- in this 15 group here, the 35 -- he could not say. and he could not say 16 because no one can go back and look and see microscopically 17 which cell mutated first. if you had to, there could be no 18 cases like this. there could be no case at all, because 19 nobody can go back. 20 so, really, that is what he was saying. the rest 21 of it is just pump-up. no, we do not know that. but we know 22 this. we know -- we do not know which cell. we know what 23 happened in the end. we know what happened in the end 24 because it happens all the time. 25 we know what is most probable. we know what the 129 preponderance -- that is a word of probability. we know what 2 preponderance means. and preponderance means -- not this, 3 not trying theoretically to find that. this is what 4 preponderance means. that is preponderance. this is tiny. 5 and even if they both somehow interacted, what 6 if -- what if that happened? what if one bullet came -- all 7 these smoking bullets came, 850, with a power of 850? and 8 with a power of 40 maybe some -- maybe there was one. i 9 do not care. you will be told that if two or more things 10 combine, that is just concurrent cause. that is not -- that is 11 fine. we are -- we are -- that is -- we are not required to 12 prove no other cause could possibly play a role. we have 13 never been able -- never been required to prove that. 14 so that is -- that is the typical kind of 15 distortion that the -- that you will see -- if you review 16 these documents from a cigarette industry, you will see more 17 and more of it. 18 dr. gentry went on and said, the tobacco working 19 group, that is my defense. the tobacco working group, 20 remember, was never told what reynolds knew about why people 21 smoke. 22 and what reynolds knew -- and i'm going to go 23 through a few documents my last few minutes. what reynolds 24 knew was that cigarette smoking was addictive at the 25 physical level. 130 what they did about it was not tell the tobacco 2 working group that the only way to bring this cancer rate 3 under control -- it was not -- it was not going to work just 4 putting on -- just trying to take out one thing or another. 5 the only way to do it -- there is only -- this is the 6 equation, addiction times carcinogens equals disease. 7 addiction causes persistent use. carcinogens combined with 8 persistent use, one-third of your people die. 9 what do you do about it? well, i guess if you would 10 take out the carcinogens that would be great. but you 11 cannot. cannot. it is burning. or you could make a super 12 cigarette that does not burn. fine. it was never available 13 to mr. pickett, ever. 14 or you can take out the addiction, in which case, 15 like a campfire, you are not around it enough to cause 16 cancer. great solution. great for mr. pickett. great for 17 the world. guess who it is not great for. reynolds. 18 because without persistent use, you do not get your money. 19 and if there is one thing we want to try and 20 express, it is that addiction is driving disease and 21 addiction is driving profits for r.j. reynolds. 22 and that is the central -- if there is one central 23 point, regardless of all the details, that is the point. it 24 is that reynolds has resisted and continues to resist the 25 whole idea of addiction. 131 they -- they give lip service to it, to use their 2 term, but they do not take it seriously except in their 3 design. 4 now, here's what i urge you to read. reality 5 again. the surgeon general 2010 is exhibit 237. and 6 cigarette design is one of the chapters. we read from it a 7 great deal of time. 8 how much? 9 (counsel confer.) 10 mr. wilner: we read through it for quite a bit. 11 it is page 15 to 17. and it talks about cigarette design 12 changes over the years. and it is exactly opposite to what 13 dr. gentry said. it could not be more different. 14 so the last paragraph -- and i will not put it up 15 because it takes time. other changes in the past 50 years, 16 changes in design, have included efforts that potentially 17 have made cigarettes more addictive through the use of 18 flavors, chemical treatments to alter the smell and 19 appearance of cigarette smoke, methods to mask noxious 20 sensory effects, and control of the nicotine dose. 21 these approaches included new types of filters, 22 tobacco blends, and ingredients, cigarette ventilation, 23 controlled ph, and efforts to reduce various volatile 24 organic compounds in tobacco and smoke. these product 25 modifications have the potential to increase the risk of 132 addiction by contributing to increased risk of initiating 2 use of the product. 3 well, how about that? that is kids. initiating 4 use. so the design was there to increase the likelihood 5 that people would initiate use. okay? 6 increase ease of smoke inhalation. what is that? 7 we know what inhalation -- deeper inhalation does two 8 things. one -- both of them terrible. one, it promotes 9 addiction, because the deeper you inhale the more blood -- 10 air surface there is, the quicker it goes to the brain. 11 response from the brain, you are addicted. what does deep 12 inhalation do also? adenocarcinoma. 13 we have heard that. it is in the surgeon general's 14 report just a little before this one. you can read it. it 15 actually says, deeper inhalation produces adenocarcinoma. 16 number three, increase -- decrease noxiousness and 17 possibly increase brain and nicotine exposure. that is that 18 free nicotine that you get when you design your cigarette to 19 deliver the kick that you want it to deliver. 20 and i can -- i cannot read the whole thing. but if 21 you read page 15 to 17 -- it is not us. it is not me. it is 22 the latest surgeon general. 23 and one more thing. we heard, oh, the surgeon 24 general says that it is choice, whatever that means. it is 25 always -- there is always some choice involved in everything. 133 but that does not mean that there is no addiction. 2 so in the chapter on nicotine addiction, what does 3 the surgeon general say, page 105 of the surgeon general's 4 report of 2010? page 105. you will have it. 5 here's what it says, nicotine addiction is the 6 fundamental reason that individuals persist in using tobacco 7 products. and this persistent tobacco use contributes to 8 the many diseases described in this report. 9 now, is that what reynolds said? no. they 10 said -- they would like to say, oh, people's choice to smoke 11 is the fundamental reason that individuals persist in using 12 tobacco products. that is their argument. but that is not 13 modern science. 14 modern science is, nicotine addiction is the 15 fundamental reason, because we now understand, later than we 16 should, that it is a brain disease and that it is driving -- 17 it is driving people to take the next cigarette. 18 and if we look at mr. pickett's history, do we 19 have a real question? on his deathbed he is asking for a 20 patch, on his deathbed. 21 if that is not a man in prison, who has been in 22 prison -- and can you imagine his feeling at that time and 23 what the people around him are seeing, a man who is in 24 control of everything except that, a man who could do 25 everything but get out of jail, this one prison that they 134 knew about, and that they coldly calculated in 1982 by 2 saying -- by calling it the exit gate, our customers are 3 behind the exit gate? 4 and if it gets open, we go out of business. so 5 what do we do? we close it. we keep it closed. how do we 6 keep it closed? all these changes, all these design things 7 that we just talked about. 8 now, if you feel that that is the wrong response 9 and that a different response would be proper, if you feel 10 that instead of talking about getting carcinogens out that 11 you could not do, or designing a cigarette that no one 12 bought, some kind of a premier that was not even available, 13 that the secret to controlling this epidemic -- and, in 14 fact, here it is again on page 105 on nicotine addiction, 15 the 2010, tobacco addiction remains a substantial problem in 16 the united states and worldwide. 17 they say, any efforts -- any efforts to reduce 18 tobacco-related disease must take into account the addiction 19 potential of a tobacco product. 20 and so if you feel that reynolds has not taken 21 into account properly, that they have not gone ahead with a 22 design that minimizes addiction, but instead have been very 23 happy to make their profits off the highly addictive winston 24 cigarettes that kill one-third of the people, they need to 25 be told that. 135 and this district court can tell them -- just like 2 the fda can tell them, just like the government can tell 3 them, this district court can do it. and few people have 4 had the background that you have to allow that message to 5 occur. 6 so if you feel that it is proper and the right 7 thing to do, to give reynolds the message that this is 8 not -- you cannot continue to do business in this way, this 9 is not a good thing, these must evolve into nonaddictive 10 products that do not further addict our children and do not 11 further put one-third of the people who use them behind the 12 gates -- behind the prison of the exit gate, then we suggest 13 it is that question nine that says, yes, we -- we want to 14 send a message. 15 thank you.
