3 closing argument 4 mr. biersteker: thank you, your honor. 5 may it please the court, counsel, 6 mrs. piendle. and good morning, barely, ladies 7 and gentlemen of the jury. i do not know how i 8 drew the short straw, i'm going to go about two 9 hours, we are going to be hungry, i'm sorry, 10 that is the schedule. 11 we are coming to the end of a long process, 12 and before i discuss the evidence and the 13 issues in this case, i want to thank you on 14 behalf of myself, liza kessler, john 15 wiederhold, will farrell, and especially on 16 behalf of r.j. reynolds. 17 we have kept you here a long time. we have 18 kept you here late many days. you have endured 19 inconvenience, and some of you have had some 20 personal hardships, and you have all interrupted 21 your personal lives. 22 you have paid careful attention and, in 23 fact, you have taken notes, many notes, and 24 you have asked thoughtful questions. so all of 25 that shows just how hard you have been 1 concentrating and thinking as the evidence came 2 in. you have fulfilled your civic duty and 3 played an essential role in ensuring that our 4 system of justice is just. and make no mistake 5 about it, r.j. reynolds is interested in 6 justice too. 7 you have our gratitude, you have our 8 respect, and now the hard part comes for you. 9 you must be fair, impartial, and dispassionate 10 judges of the facts. you must put aside your 11 emotions and your sympathy, and you have got to 12 all -- i mean, we all feel some sympathy for 13 mrs. piendle, who would not, who would not, but 14 you have to put that aside, and you have to be 15 dispassionate and you have to decide this case 16 based upon the evidence in accordance with the 17 law that the court has given you. 18 all right. i told you in my opening 19 statement that this trial was all about 20 mr. piendle and the choices that he made, and i 21 told you that there was four groups of issues. 22 if i could have the next slide, please. 23 class membership, findings and legal 24 cause, i referred to that as the bridge, 25 responsibility, and damages. 1 and i'm going to talk to you in my closing 2 argument this morning and early this afternoon 3 about the choices that mr. piendle made and how 4 they relate to these four groups of issues. 5 but before i begin, i want you to keep two 6 things in mind. first, as the court has 7 instructed you, the plaintiff bears the burden 8 of proof on her claims. she has to prove her 9 case by the greater weight of the evidence, and 10 when it comes to punitive damages, she must 11 meet an even higher burden of proof, clear and 12 convincing evidence. 13 and the court has defined those terms in 14 the instructions that you-all have and you can 15 take back to the jury room with you, but i want 16 to say this, they mean that plaintiff, not 17 reynolds, not philip morris, has to carry the 18 burden of proof on each and every one of the 19 claims that she has presented for you. and the 20 plaintiff basically starts at zero, in the 21 basement, and she is got to build her case brick 22 by brick, step by step, and she is got to carry 23 you with her the whole way until there is a 24 greater weight of the evidence, and for 25 punitive damages, she is got to take you even 1 higher to clear and convincing evidence. 2 second observation i want to make before i 3 discuss the issues, and that is this. the 4 court's instructions, and i know they are hard 5 to read, they are even hard for lawyers, but the 6 court's instructions are a road map to filling 7 out the verdict form. 8 mr. barnhart went through that form 9 probably in about two minutes and just was 10 checking boxes, left, right and center. that is 11 not the way to do it. you have to follow the 12 law that her honor has given you, and the 13 instructions are that law. 14 so from time to time, even though it is not 15 like reading a novel, i'm going to put up 16 pieces of the instructions up on the screen or 17 over here on the boards for you to look at as 18 we discuss the issues in this case. but that is 19 your road map. you cannot fill out the verdict 20 form without following the road map. 21 okay. so now let us turn to the evidence 22 and let us talk about the issues. and the first 23 question on the verdict form, was charles 24 piendle addicted to cigarettes containing 25 nicotine, and if so, was such addiction a legal 1 cause of his lung cancer and death? 2 it has, as we discussed in voir dire, 3 basically -- there is two questions. one is 4 addiction, that is underlined there, and that is 5 the first one i'm going to talk about, and the 6 second was legal cause, and i'm going to talk 7 about that next. 8 all right. so was mr. piendle addicted? 9 the court did not define addiction for you in 10 those instructions. you can read them all day 11 and you will not find it. and you are going to 12 have to decide what it means. 13 and when mrs. piendle was on the stand, i 14 confronted her with interrogatory responses, 15 those signed answers to written questions that 16 she gave when this case was being prepared, and 17 her position was that addiction is a medical 18 issue, which should be a medical diagnosis. 19 addiction is a medical diagnosis, i'm not 20 qualified to say whether the smoker was 21 addicted, medical records, medical records, 22 doctors will have to say, the doctors, all the 23 way through. 24 and we agree, addiction must be medically 25 diagnosed. that is the standard that i would 1 adopt. that is the standard that the plaintiff 2 adopted. 3 and what is the evidence been? let us talk 4 about what the plaintiff presented, because 5 after all, the plaintiff has the burden of 6 proof. and as you heard from dr. benowitz when 7 he was on the stand, there is something called 8 the diagnostic and statistical manual, roman 9 numeral iv, from the american association of 10 the -- the american psychiatric association, 11 the apa, and it is the test that is used by 12 psychiatrists and psychologists to actually 13 diagnose addiction medically. 14 the fagerstrom test that you heard about 15 during the course of the trial, and that was 16 dwelled on a little bit by mr. barnhart in his 17 closing, is not, is not, i repeat, a medical 18 diagnosis of addiction. 19 the fagerstrom test just assumes that 20 everybody who takes the test is addicted. you 21 can be a never smoker and you are still 22 dependent under that test. and dr. benowitz 23 testified it is not a test for diagnosis as 24 that term is medically understood. 25 okay. so plaintiff offered no medical 1 diagnosis that mr. piendle was addicted. 2 and as i mentioned, plaintiff, when she 3 was up on the stand, as mr. barnhart said, 4 filled out the fagerstrom test at trial, even 5 though she admitted she did not know if 6 mr. piendle was addicted at any time that she 7 knew him. 8 but again, the fagerstrom test is not a 9 medical diagnosis of addiction, even if 10 plaintiff and ms. baker-barnes had put on 11 doctors' coats, it does not change it, that is 12 not what the test is for. 13 and speaking of the fagerstrom test, how 14 could mrs. piendle know which cigarette 15 mr. piendle would hate to give up most? how 16 would she really know that he smoked four 17 cigarettes in the morning? remember, she 18 did not even notice that he quit for two days. 19 plaintiff also called three experts and 20 paid each of them a lot of money to review the 21 medical records and the depositions and other 22 materials in this case, but none of them 23 offered the medical diagnosis of addiction. 24 first, there was dr. cummings. of course, 25 he could not give medical diagnosis, he is not a 1 doctor. he did not apply to mr. piendle the 2 dsm-iv criteria that psychiatrists and 3 psychologists use every day to diagnose 4 addiction. he just gave you a nonmedical 5 assessment, it was a rule of thumb, and it was 6 a nonmedical rule of thumb. and it was, you 7 smoke a hundred cigarettes in your lifetime and 8 you are smoking daily, voil√†, you are addicted. 9 and frankly, dr. cummings, the health 10 educator, was a little bit out of his league on 11 this subject. i noticed that some of you in 12 your questioning picked up on this. and it had 13 to do with the permanent changes in the brain. 14 and if you will remember, dr. benowitz has 15 published all those peer-reviewed articles and 16 he is done a lot of research on nicotine, and he 17 clearly testified that within a few weeks after 18 quitting, the nicotine receptors in the brain 19 go back to normal. 20 and then it was one of your questions, 21 because you noticed a discrepancy with what 22 dr. cummings said, and he said, well, the 23 number of receptors do not change, talking about 24 after he quit, and once he developed more 25 receptors for nicotine, that is one of the 1 reasons it is so easy to fall back into smoking 2 again. 3 now, ask yourselves, who do you trust 4 more? i think the answer is pretty obvious. 5 so that was dr. cummings, but who, by the 6 way, i do not think ever testified, search your 7 memories, that he had anything do with the 1999 8 surgeon general's report, notwithstanding the 9 demonstrative that mr. barnhart put up. 10 in any event, that is dr. cummings. let us 11 talk about dr. burns. dr. burns is a medical 12 doctor, but dr. burns also never diagnosed 13 mr. piendle as addicted medically under the 14 dsm-iv criteria. instead, he talked about 15 compulsive use of and you have lost the ability 16 to freely choose the next use of the substance. 17 another rule of thumb, without any evidence 18 from dr. burns, that it is used to diagnose 19 addiction medically, none, he never said that. 20 and in cross-examination, i asked him 21 about his medical practice. and you may 22 recall, i asked him about his own patients. 23 and he said, you know, if a patient comes to me 24 and says, i'm not addicted, i tell them 25 basically, put them down for a month, come back 1 and see me, and if you are not smoking, you are 2 probably not addicted. 3 ladies and gentlemen, that is mr. piendle. 4 all right. let us talk about dr. benowitz. 5 he is the guy who is done a ton of research on 6 nicotine in the brain, he is also a medical 7 doctor. he actually talked about the dsm-iv 8 criteria during the course of his testimony 9 before you. but here's the curious part. 10 plaintiff never asked dr. benowitz at trial to 11 actually use the dsm-iv criteria to medically 12 diagnose mr. piendle as addicted. he too just 13 gave a rule of thumb, and there it is. five 14 cigarettes a day, probably addicted. that was 15 his answer. and again, no testimony that is 16 sufficient to constitute a medical diagnosis of 17 addiction. 18 so not one of plaintiff's experts came 19 before you and said mr. piendle medically was 20 addicted. and for that reason, and because the 21 plaintiff bears the burden of proof, remember 22 that, the defense did not call an expert to come 23 in and apply the dsm-iv criteria to 24 mr. piendle. 25 and interestingly, nor did any of 1 mr. piendle's doctors diagnose mr. piendle as 2 addicted. nor did any of his doctors treat 3 mr. piendle as addicted. you heard that 4 testimony. and interestingly, mr. piendle 5 never said he was addicted either. 6 so in short, plaintiff did not carry her 7 burden of showing that mr. piendle was addicted 8 under the very standard that the plaintiff and 9 her legal counsel in this case adopted at the 10 beginning of the case. 11 but let us say, contrary to the position of 12 both plaintiff and the defense, you decide to 13 use some nonmedical rule of thumb instead of 14 the medical definition of addiction. let us say 15 you also conclude that under some nonmedical 16 rule of thumb, mr. piendle was addicted. then 17 what? 18 well, then you get to the second threshold 19 issue, and that was, was any addiction -- 20 next slide, please, will. 21 -- a legal cause of his lung cancer and 22 death? 23 and i want to spend just a minute before 24 we get into discussing addiction in this 25 connection talking to you about legal cause. 1 it is a very important issue, it comes up when 2 we talk about the bridge between the findings 3 and the companies, and it is all over the 4 court's instructions. so i just want to touch 5 on it briefly. 6 and remember the legal definition. cause 7 means -- 8 if i could have the next demonstrative, 9 please, will. 10 -- basically contributes substantially, 11 contributes substantially, and then it is 12 defined so that it can be reasonably said that 13 but for the addiction to cigarettes -- this 14 language appears time after time, not always 15 addiction, it depends upon negligence or 16 defect, but it appears all the time -- 17 contributes substantially so it can be said 18 that but for the addiction to cigarettes 19 containing nicotine, the death would not have 20 occurred. but for. 21 now, the words "contributes substantially" 22 appear several times during the course of 23 instructions. it is defined the first time it is 24 used in connection with every issue as a 25 but-for cause. it is not always redefined when 1 it is used the next time, but it means the same 2 thing, but-for cause. that is what plaintiff 3 has to prove, and that is true for each and 4 every one of the issues for causation, it is 5 important, and it is important to every issue in 6 the case. again, look at the instructions. 7 that is what it means. 8 all right. so let us turn to the evidence 9 now and on whether addiction was a legal cause 10 of mr. piendle's death. the evidence was that 11 mr. piendle chose to smoke, chose to start 12 smoking. nobody disputes that. he chose to 13 continue smoking. 14 and even though he could quit -- again, 15 not an issue, everybody agrees he could quit. 16 he chose not do so until 1989, and then he made 17 up his mind and he quit. and here is the 18 important part, there is no evidence that it 19 was hard for him to quit, notwithstanding what 20 mr. barnhart said in his closing. search your 21 memories, that evidence is not there. 22 what happened was mr. piendle put them 23 down and he never picked them up again. he 24 quit cold turkey in 1989. he did not need help, 25 he did not ask for help, he did not get help, he 1 just did it. and significantly, when 2 mr. piendle quit in 1989, he did not have the 3 withdrawal symptoms that truly addicted smokers 4 sometimes experience. 5 next demonstrative, please, will. 6 and these are the, quote/unquote, awful 7 withdrawal symptoms that mr. barnhart was 8 talking about. i have to tell you, compared to 9 alcohol and heroin, these are not awful. he 10 had no trouble sleeping, no anxiety, no 11 difficulty concentrating, no evidence he had 12 weight gain or ate more. no headaches, sore or 13 dry throat. there was no evidence of any of 14 that, the classic withdrawal symptoms. 15 and mr. cabral, his best friend, said he 16 did not notice anything different about him. 17 ms. worobel, his other best friend, never said 18 that he seemed different. his brother, 19 mr. edward piendle, said he did not notice 20 anything different about him, except he was 21 always chewing on those toothpicks. 22 the only withdrawal symptom that anybody 23 ever suggested he might have had when he quit 24 smoking was that he was a little moody. 25 mrs. piendle said that. mrs. piendle did not 1 say he was moody because he snapped at her. 2 she did not say that he was moody because he 3 lost his temper over the little things in life. 4 she said he was moody because he talked to her 5 less. that is it. that was the basis for 6 saying mr. piendle was moody. 7 well, he could not have been that moody. 8 again, mrs. piendle did not notice he quit 9 smoking for almost two days. and as you 10 learned from dr. benowitz, the withdrawal 11 effects that somebody has whenever they quit 12 basically are the strongest in the first week 13 after they quit. 14 and you know what, there is other reasons 15 that might explain why mr. piendle was talking 16 to mrs. piendle less after he first quit 17 smoking. now, let us talk about those. there 18 are really two. first, mrs. piendle, as you 19 heard, was upset with mr. piendle for quitting. 20 it was something that she thought they should 21 do it together, and she was a little mad at him 22 that he went off and did it on his own. now, 23 your common sense should tell you that if 24 somebody is upset with somebody else, they 25 might not talk to them as much. 1 second, mrs. piendle told us, hey, you 2 know, in 1989 i was not ready to quit and, 3 indeed, she did not even try. she was still 4 smoking two packs of cigarettes a day at that 5 time. and mr. piendle, at least at first when 6 he first quit, would leave the room when she 7 lit up in front of him. no wonder he was 8 talking to her less. he was not in the room 9 much of the time. 10 all right. that is 1989. what about 11 before 1989? initially, mr. piendle did not 12 smoke where smoking is not allowed. he was able 13 to refrain from smoking without a problem or a 14 complaint. 15 for example -- 16 the next slide, please. 17 -- he did not smoke at church. he did not 18 complain about not being able to smoke at 19 church. he did not leave church in the middle 20 of service to go and smoke a cigarette. same 21 thing for the movies. no complaints, no 22 problem not smoking during movies. did not 23 leave movies in the middle of them to go sneak 24 a cigarette. 25 he did not smoke in bed. you heard about 1 that, except possibly after his meal that he 2 had every evening. he did not get out of bed to 3 smoke in the middle of the night. he did not 4 rush through meals to smoke. you heard all 5 that. you also heard that he did not have his 6 first cigarette in the morning in bed. 7 there is been kind of confusing testimony, 8 but alan cannizzio, who you heard by 9 deposition, he did not come here, mrs. piendle's 10 son, basically said it was disgusting if 11 somebody would smoke while they are eating. and 12 his testimony was mr. piendle smoked after 13 breakfast when he was having his coffee. 14 again, the evidence is a little fuzzy, but that 15 was about the clearest testimony you had. 16 and there is been no evidence that 17 mr. piendle tried to quit in the 1950s or '60s 18 when, according to dr. benowitz, it would have 19 been easier for him. remember, dr. benowitz 20 says, the longer you smoke, the more withdrawal 21 symptoms you will have, at least as a general 22 rule. 23 okay. and, sure, plaintiff did not do so 24 in closing, but during the course of the trial 25 talked a fair amount about those new year's 1 resolutions, as if they were evidence that 2 quitting smoking was hard for mr. piendle. 3 but you heard dr. burns talk about 4 cognitive dissonance, and basically smokers 5 enjoy smoking on the one hand, they know it is 6 bad for them on the other hand, and they are 7 conflicted. they are conflicted. 8 ask yourself: did mr. piendle really want 9 to quit smoking before 1989? what is the 10 evidence that you heard during the course of 11 this trial? remember, those new year's 12 resolutions were not all that memorable to 13 mrs. piendle. she really was not sure how many 14 there were, and she could not tell us in what 15 years they occurred. 16 she even said different things about 17 whether they actually quit or whether they just 18 tried to cut down. 19 the next demonstrative, please, will. 20 there you go. 21 on direct examination, mrs. piendle left 22 you with the impression that for those new 23 year's resolutions, she and mr. piendle would 24 smoke their last cigarette, last one in the 25 pack, and then actually stop smoking cigarettes 1 altogether for a day or a day and a half. but 2 on cross-examination, mrs. piendle admitted 3 that the new year's resolutions in the 1970s 4 and the '80s were attempts to cut back and to 5 limit the number of cigarettes they would 6 smoke, with the idea that they might quit 7 smoking altogether. 8 little unclear whether they actually quit, 9 but this much we do know -- this much we do 10 know, the evidence was crystal clear that the 11 piendles were not doing any of the things that 12 you would expect somebody who was truly 13 committed to smoking -- to quitting smoking 14 that they would do. 15 so -- and, again, you heard this, did not 16 throw away the ashtrays, did not throw away the 17 lighters, never went to a doctor or a smoking 18 cessation clinic, no hypnosis, no prescription 19 of any kind. and, yes, nicotine gum was 20 probably the predominant prescription available 21 at any time. and they never told their friends 22 and family they were trying because they did not 23 want to be embarrassed if they did not make it. 24 in short, the piendles truly were hedging their 25 bets. 1 could you really say that they were 2 committed -- that mr. piendle was committed to 3 smoking in connection with any of those new 4 year's resolutions? 5 and i would say submit that mr. piendle 6 was in control of his smoking based upon the 7 evidence you heard, and it was not the other 8 way around. and that is consistent with 9 everything that we were told about him by all 10 of his family members and friends who came here 11 to testify and who knew him the best. 12 they said he was strong-willed. he was not 13 a weak man. only mr. barnhart said that in his 14 opening. nobody else did. he was decisive. 15 the marines and all the other marines who came 16 after him were wusses. he was a straight and 17 narrow kind of guy. it is all consistent with 18 what plaintiff's expert, dr. benowitz said. 19 if we could have the next slide. next one 20 after this. too many. never mind. 21 also consistent with what dr. benowitz 22 said, and you will remember he said, addiction is 23 really, you know, a control issue. do you have 24 control of use of the drugs? that means, if 25 you want to stop, you can stop. if you want to 1 smoke fewer, you can smoke fewer. mr. piendle 2 had that control. that is what the evidence has 3 been, and nobody has told you otherwise. he 4 could quit. no addiction prevented him from 5 quitting, and he could have quit sooner than he 6 did. 7 plaintiff, in short, has not proven that 8 any addiction so controlled mr. piendle that it 9 was a but-for cause of his continued smoking 10 and his lung cancer. the evidence was that 11 he -- just as he started to smoke, basically to 12 fit in, he decided to quit after many of his 13 friends and family members had quit smoking. 14 mrs. piendle testified that a number of 15 folks they knew had quit smoking and had urged 16 mr. piendle to quit. that included his sister, 17 christy verrelli, and his good friend -- maybe 18 his best friend, lucille worobel. there is 19 another reality here that tracy piendle 20 addressed when she was on the stand. 21 mr. piendle was approaching 50. in 1989, 22 he was 48 years old. that is one year older 23 than his father was when he died of a heart 24 attack in 1966. his dad, i think, was 47, and 25 in connection with that, mr. piendle made some 1 lifestyle changes. he started to go to the 2 gym. he quit smoking. those were some of 3 them. 4 i submit to you that plaintiff does not 5 carry her burden of proving class membership, 6 no. there was no proof that mr. piendle was 7 addicted, if that term is used medically, a 8 standard that the plaintiff herself has adopted 9 in this case. there was no proof that any 10 addiction was a but-for cause -- but-for legal 11 cause of mr. piendle's continued smoking and 12 lung cancer. and because plaintiff has not met 13 that burden, i would ask that you check "no" on 14 the -- in answer to the first question on the 15 verdict form. 16 okay. i'll switch gears a little bit. 17 let us say you disagree with me. it is always a 18 possibility, i know. and you find that 19 mr. piendle was a member of the class and then 20 you have more issues to decide. the court has 21 instructed you on certain findings made by the 22 class action jury in the engle case. 23 and remember the court's instruction that 24 you saw in voir dire, and you have heard twice, 25 i think, since then. it is on the board. it is 1 what mr. kelly referred to as the rest of the 2 story during voir dire, and, indeed, it is. 3 and the court has specifically instructed you 4 that the findings do not mean that the 5 plaintiff is entitled to prevail in this case, 6 you have got to have more. she has got to prove 7 more. 8 and what you are going to be asked to do 9 if you get this far, is to take the findings, 10 apply the evidence you have heard, and decide 11 if plaintiff has met her burden again -- it is 12 still her burden -- of proving that the breach 13 of those duties, the misconduct by the 14 defendants, was a legal cause of mr. piendle's 15 smoking and ultimately his death from lung 16 cancer. 17 and again, i just want to come back to 18 legal cause. you will see this repeatedly in the 19 instructions. it is not enough. i repeat. it 20 is not enough that plaintiff proved that any 21 addiction caused mr. piendle's lung cancer and 22 death. that is not enough. rather, plaintiff 23 must also show -- i have a series of slides 24 here, and they all say the same thing -- must 25 also show that the conduct of the defendants, 1 whether it is negligence -- 2 next one, please. 3 -- whether it is defect, whether it is 4 concealment or agreement to conceal, that still 5 has to show legal cause but for, but for the 6 conduct that was negligence, but for the 7 defect, but for the concealment, but for the 8 agreement to conceal, mr. piendle would not 9 have continued smoking and would not have 10 gotten lung cancer. and legal cause still 11 means the same thing, substantially contributes 12 but for, every time you see it. 13 so plaintiff had to build that causal 14 bridge that i talked about before. she had to 15 link the generic findings on one shoulder to 16 mr. piendle on the other, and show that there 17 was but-for causation in between them. she has 18 to show that the conduct, what -- for example, 19 what reynolds and philip morris did or said or 20 did not say or did not do was a but-for legal 21 cause of mr. piendle's smoking and lung cancer, 22 and i submit that she did not build that 23 bridge. 24 now, the engle jury that made these 25 generic findings that you have seen and that 1 we are going to talk about, did not know anything 2 about mr. piendle. they did not know when he 3 started smoking, they did not know what he 4 smoked, they did not know why he smoked, they 5 did not know whether he quit, did not know how he 6 quit or what he knew about the health risks of 7 smoking. that is your job. your job is to look 8 at this evidence and decide whether or not the 9 plaintiff built the bridge. 10 now, before we talk about each of the 11 individual findings, i want to talk a little 12 bit about mr. piendle and the choices he made, 13 because it would be easy for you to forget 14 during mr. barnhart's closing that this case is 15 all about mr. piendle. 16 you heard a lot of talk about statistics 17 and american public, but not a lot about 18 mr. piendle and not a lot related to the core 19 issue in this case, which is was that bridge 20 built. so let me talk a little bit about 21 mr. piendle and the choices he made, and let us 22 make no mistake about it, they were choices. 23 basically, three of them, although each of 24 them is multiple; the choice to start smoking, 25 the choice to become a regular smoker, the 1 choice to continue smoking until 1989. 2 let us talk about each of those, just 3 briefly. the choice to start. we do not know 4 the precise date on which mr. piendle started 5 smoking. the earliest evidence that he first 6 smoked came from mr. cabral, and he said that 7 mr. piendle smoked when mr. piendle was in the 8 eighth or ninth grade. remember, mr. cabral 9 was one year behind him. 10 however, if you go look at the medical 11 records -- and you should do this. they are in 12 evidence. plaintiff put up some excerpts. and 13 let us see what mr. piendle told his doctors. 14 smoking at age 16 to 48. and that was the 15 legal age in connecticut, when he was growing 16 up. that would have put him at -- i do not 17 know -- freshman, sophomore year, probably 18 sophomore year of high school in 1957. 19 and one of the -- one of the exhibits 20 that -- i just pulled it out of the medical 21 records, was plaintiff had all those two packs 22 a day references up here. but if you go and 23 actually look at the medal records, and i urge 24 you to do this when you deliberate, you will come 25 across this one which says, "patient smoked one 1 half pack per day." different things at 2 different times. 3 all right. everybody agrees that 4 mr. piendle started smoking, and he 5 experimented for social reasons. his parents 6 smoked. you heard all about that. his best 7 friend, mr. cabral; his other best friend, 8 ms. worobel smoked. his other friend smoked. 9 the older kids smoked. he wanted to fit in. 10 there is no evidence, however, that he 11 started smoking because of tobacco advertising. 12 one of the brands that he smoked with 13 mr. cabral early on was lucky strikes, and 14 there was no evidence that lucky strikes' 15 advertising at the time mr. piendle smoked 16 lucky strikes in mid-1950s targeted kids. you 17 saw this ad during my cross-examination of 18 dr. cummings. 19 and after he started smoking, mr. piendle 20 had another choice to make, and that was 21 whether to become a regular smoker. it is a 22 choice that every smoker must make. none of 23 plaintiff's experts told you that mr. piendle 24 became addicted the day he smoked his first 25 cigarette, and there is certainly no evidence 6949 1 that anyone, including the defendants, forced 2 him to continue. he had the ability to decide 3 whether or not he wanted to do that. 4 you also heard that he smoked once in a 5 while and socially in high school. dr. burns 6 testified, based upon his review of the 7 materials in this case, that mr. piendle became 8 a regular smoker somewhere between the age of 9 16 and 25 between 1957 and 1966. 10 now, you saw the textbooks approved for 11 use in the connecticut schools that dr. norrell 12 showed you. and i just want to take a little 13 detail here. plaintiffs kind of picked on 14 dr. norrell, noting how much he had been paid. 15 but he clearly does his homework. you saw 16 boxes and boxes of reliance materials that were 17 just for this case. the total he had been paid 18 represents the work he did over the course of 19 16 years. 20 while dr. norrell has testified in -- 21 approximately 15 different times, that pales in 22 comparison to the amount of times that 23 plaintiff's experts have testified. 24 as i recall, and you can go back and 25 consult your notes, dr. burns has testified 1 over 140 times; dr. cummings, i believe, 2 testified over 50 times; and dr. benowitz, over 3 30. 4 but returning to dr. norrell, it is true, 5 he could not put a specific textbook in 6 mr. piendle's hands when he was in school, but 7 he gave a powerful summary of the information 8 that was available to mr. piendle when he was 9 in high school. mr. piendle, no doubt, had 10 heard on the news or read in the media stories 11 linking smoking to lung cancer, and we know 12 that by the time mr. piendle was in high 13 school, he was calling his cigarettes cancer 14 sticks and coffin nails. 15 now, plaintiff had mr. edward piendle 16 testify that coffin nails was used because 17 cigarettes looked like a nail, not because they 18 had any association with death. it was as if 19 the coffin part was accidental. then they had 20 mr. cabral come in, and he talked about cancer 21 sticks. and he said, nah, it was just a 22 nickname without any meaning. it was as if 23 they call cigarettes sam. 24 and one of your questions followed up on 25 that and asked mr. cabral, hey, mr. cabral, did 1 you ever discuss with mr. piendle cancer 2 sticks? and you know what, you really did not 3 get a straight answer from mr. cabral. 4 they had dr. burns come in and talk about 5 the use of slang expressions. remember, the 6 coronary on a stick, which was the deep-fried 7 butter that they served at the san diego county 8 fair. we talked about that. 9 and dr. burns said the phrase did not 10 communicate a risk to heart health that was 11 internalized by the very people who were taking 12 the coronary on a stick and shoving it into 13 their mouths and using that phrase. 14 really, guys? use your common sense. is 15 any of this credible, particularly against the 16 background, the backdrop of the broader 17 information and environment that was described 18 you by dr. norrell? 19 moreover, there was zero evidence that 20 mr. piendle thought, hey, this will never 21 happen to me. there was no evidence that he 22 had internalized what he plainly knew, smoking 23 causes lung cancer and death. even plaintiff's 24 argument -- even plaintiff's argument that 25 mr. piendle did not think it would happen to 1 him, admits an understanding of what "it" was, 2 and "it" was smoking causes illness. 3 there is some additional points to keep in 4 mind. statistically, it is true, 85 to 5 ninety percent of lifelong smokers do not get lung 6 cancer. that is the debate. you heard that. 7 listen to the court's instructions and review 8 them back in the jury room. you will not find any 9 instructions that the defendant's had a legal 10 obligation to convince every single individual 11 smoker in the united states to internalize the 12 information that they already had. 13 what could the tobacco industry or these 14 defendants have done to convince mr. piendle 15 personally to apply what he already knew, 16 smoking causes cancer and death, to himself, 17 specifically? and is there any evidence in 18 this case that his reaction would have been any 19 different than it was decades later when his 20 daughter came to him and said, dad, smoking 21 causes lung cancer, showed him the warning on 22 the back, and he shooed her away. 23 would his reaction have been any different 24 when his best friend, at least one of his best 25 friends, lucille worobel, came up to him and 1 urged him to quit smoking and he said, i know, 2 i know? or would it have been any different 3 than his response likely was to his doctors? 4 there is no evidence of that. 5 you know, and even dr. burns -- 6 if i could have the demonstrative, please, 7 26. 8 -- even dr. burns basically says, i have 9 every expectation that mr. piendle was aware of 10 information that indicated that smoking was bad 11 for him. dr. benowitz admitted that even 12 today, even today, with all of the information 13 and understanding that we all have about 14 cigarette smoking, there will be people who 15 start smoking. some of them will be kids, some 16 of them will not be, but people still start. 17 there was no evidence from anybody that 18 mr. piendle decided to become a regular smoker 19 out of ignorance that smoking causes cancer and 20 death. it just was not there. there was no 21 evidence that he chose to become a regular 22 smoker because of cigarette advertising. there 23 was no evidence that he chose to become a 24 regular smoker because of any statement from 25 r.j. reynolds, from philip morris, the tobacco 1 institute, or anybody else associated with the 2 tobacco industry, much less that he relied upon 3 it. there was no testimony to that effect. 4 okay. let me talk about his last choice, 5 and that was the choice to continue smoking. 6 it was a choice that he made multiple times, 7 each day, for years. the choice to take the 8 next cigarette out of the pack, to light it, 9 and to continue smoking, instead of at least 10 trying to quit. 11 you heard all the experts say that just 12 because somebody might be addicted does not mean 13 that they can quit smoking. everybody can quit 14 smoking. there is not really a serious dispute 15 about that in this case. quitting is a 16 question of motivation and commitment, even if 17 it takes more than one try. 18 so let us talk about the 1960s and the 19 choice to continue smoking then. in the 1960s, 20 as you know, the 1964 surgeon general's report 21 came out. there were warnings on every pack of 22 cigarettes starting in 1966, "caution: 23 cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your 24 health." 25 and mrs. piendle testified she was sure 1 that mr. piendle saw that warning. she was 2 sure about it. and mr. piendle ignored the 3 information that was available to him about the 4 health risks and addictiveness of smoking in 5 the 1960s. 6 and why do i say "ignore"? because 7 there is no evidence he even tried to quit once 8 during that entire decade. 9 let us talk about the 1970s and '80s. in 10 the 1970s and '80s, mr. piendle continued to 11 smoke, despite the surgeon general's warnings 12 on every pack, and the warnings were in -- in 13 every advertisement, every ad starting in 1972. 14 these are warnings, 1970, 1985, "surgeon 15 general has determined that smoking is 16 dangerous to your health." 17 and then from 1985 to the present, these 18 rotating warnings, specific warnings about lung 19 cancer, specific warnings that say, "if you 20 quit smoking, it greatly reduces risk to your 21 health." and the court has instructed you that 22 there is no dispute in this case that 23 defendants put that warning on every one of 24 their packs starting in 1966, all the way 25 through to the present. 1 now -- and as i said, tracy piendle 2 testified she showed her dad those warnings 3 when she was -- when she was at home and a 4 young girl and told him cigarettes cause 5 cancer. again, he shooed her away. 6 and mrs. piendle said, you know, if there 7 was any doubt in my mind that mr. piendle 8 had not read the warning or that mr. piendle 9 did not believe that smoking was dangerous to 10 health, she would have told him, but she never 11 did, because she did not have that doubt. he 12 knew. all of the evidence shows that he knew 13 in the 1970s and '80s. 14 and what is plaintiff's response? what is 15 plaintiff's response? it is to ignore all the 16 specific information that we know about 17 mr. piendle, the individual. it is to lump him 18 into a statistical age cohort and to argue that 19 he must have liked -- he must have acted like 20 average people his age, or to talk about -- i 21 wrote the phrase down. i can barely read my 22 writing. but i think mr. barnhart used the 23 phrase "subconscious reliance." i do not even 24 know what that is. "subconscious reliance." 25 and neither of those attempts work. 1 when mr. piendle started smoking, he was 2 among the 35 to forty percent of age cohorts who, 3 based on the adult use of tobacco survey that 4 you heard about, that began smoking before he 5 turned 18, not the seventy percent that dr. cummings 6 tried to claim. 7 mr. piendle really was not an average man. 8 he was the star athlete in high school, and 9 then starting in early adulthood, he suffered 10 from debilitating crohn's disease and then 11 later on arthritis, hearing loss, dizziness, 12 and so forth. he was not average in his brand 13 loyalty or his brand selections. after all, 14 mrs. piendle largely chose the brands that they 15 smoked. 16 and statistics cannot really prove the 17 facts in this case related to mr. piendle. and 18 i think there is a very telling example. if 19 statistics decided this case, mr. piendle never 20 got lung cancer. after all, as i said before, 21 the evidence said that 85 to ninety percent of 22 smokers do not get lung cancer. if you want to 23 decided the case on statistics, let us go home 24 right now, because he never had lung cancer. 25 in short, specific evidence about 1 mr. piendle, not data from age cohorts or 2 anything else, should carry more weight when 3 you go back into that jury room and start 4 deliberating than anything about age cohorts, 5 anything about subconscious reliance. look at 6 the facts that relate to mr. piendle. this 7 case is for him. it is about him. it is about 8 him. 9 okay. now, i want to talk about the 10 specific findings that you are to apply. i 11 want to discuss the burden plaintiff has to 12 show about legal cause as to each and every one 13 of them. i want to talk about whether they 14 built that bridge. i want to start with 15 design. 16 if i could have the next slide, please. 17 okay. here's the finding on design. 18 defendants r.j. reynolds tobacco company and 19 philip morris usa, inc., placed cigarettes on 20 the market that were defective and unreasonably 21 dangerous, and, you know what, that finding 22 does not help you very much. let me tell you 23 why. 24 it does not say what the defect was. it 25 does not say that any of the brands that 1 mr. piendle specifically smoked were defective 2 at all. it does not say when the defendants 3 placed defective cigarettes on the market. 4 and if i could have the next 5 demonstrative. 6 and as her honor has instructed, and you 7 will see in the instructions that you have with 8 you, the findings establish only what they 9 expressly state. you may not speculate -- you 10 must not speculate or guess as to the basis of 11 findings. 12 now, you heard repeatedly during the 13 course of this trial there is no such thing as a 14 safe cigarette, and i'm certainly not about to 15 tell you otherwise. there is also not a single 16 conventional cigarette that burns tobacco that 17 is not capable of causing lung cancer. they all 18 can. 19 but what is the evidence that plaintiff 20 produced that showed that the reynolds and the 21 philip morris cigarettes that mr. piendle 22 smoked had a defect that was a legal but-for 23 cause of his death? 24 well, first, they got dr. cummings to come 25 in, and he said, you know, the only cigarettes 1 that were reasonable to market were those that 2 were nicotine free. but there were 3 nicotine-free cigarettes on the market, 4 including brands manufactured by philip morris. 5 the next brand, the benson and hedges denic. 6 and as the surgeon general observed in 7 1964, and several witnesses testified, next to 8 nobody bought the philip morris denicotinized 9 cigarettes or any other cigarette that did not 10 have nicotine. 11 and here is the important part: there is 12 no evidence whatever that mr. piendle would 13 have avoided his lung cancer if only the 14 defendants in this case made nicotine-free 15 cigarettes. philip morris did, other companies 16 did, too, and mr. piendle did not smoke them 17 ever. ever. 18 let us say that reynolds and philip morris 19 had made only nicotine-free cigarettes, the 20 only cigarettes they made. what then? does 21 anybody here seriously doubt that mr. piendle 22 would have gone and smoked cigarettes with 23 nicotine made by a competitor? 24 as dr. figlar testified, cigarettes with 25 nicotine all have the potential to addict. but 1 they are legal products. and defendants did not 2 have a legal obligation to go out of business, 3 no matter how much that would have pleased 4 dr. cummings, the general in the war on 5 tobacco, and the only witness who came before 6 you and testified that cigarettes should be 7 banned, the only one. 8 well, next, plaintiff had dr. cummings say 9 that defendants alternatively should not have 10 made any conventional cigarettes at all, and 11 instead, they should have made pure 12 nicotine-delivery devices, something that 13 delivers only nicotine and nothing else. but 14 again, conventional cigarettes -- 15 excuse me, let me get some water. 16 -- conventional cigarettes are legal, and 17 mr. piendle never used any of the pure nicotine 18 alternatives that were available to him, such 19 as nicotine gum, even when he was trying to 20 quit, and i think there is absolutely no 21 evidence to support the notion that if there 22 had been pure nicotine things on the market, he 23 would have used them as a long term means to 24 get nicotine. i do not think he would have done 25 that and i do not think there is any evidence to 1 support that. 2 and when reynolds did invent the cigarette 3 that heated instead of burned tobacco, yielding 4 nicotine, but none of the conventional tar, the 5 food and drug administration threatened to make 6 it available only by prescription, and there is 7 been no evidence that mr. piendle would have 8 bought that product either, that was starting 9 in 1988. 10 so that leaves us with the conventional 11 cigarettes, and they are inherently dangerous. 12 no one disputes that. and they are and always 13 have been legal products. 14 the evidence is that starting in the 1950s 15 and continuing all the way through 1989 when 16 mr. piendle quit and beyond, the public health 17 community encouraged smokers to switch from 18 higher to lower tar in nicotine cigarettes and 19 encouraged cigarette manufacturers, like 20 reynolds, to make them, and reynolds and philip 21 morris responded. 22 as dr. figlar demonstrated graphically, 23 literally with his demonstratives, they 24 steadily lowered the tar and nicotine yield of 25 their existing products and they made new 1 products available as the technology approved, 2 such as the 1 milligram carlton and now 3 cigarettes. 4 did they have the capacity to make a 5 1 milligram tar cigarette from 1950? sure. 6 you could have put on a super-duper filter, but 7 nobody would have bought it. the trick was 8 with these incremental designs improvements 9 over time. they tried to make a 1 milligram 10 tar cigarette that would be acceptable to 11 smokers. because if you make even a safe 12 cigarette, which is impossible, but if you make 13 even a safe cigarette and nobody buys it, you 14 really have not done any good. 15 and i have to respond to what was said by 16 mr. barnhart, that dr. figlar said that all 17 cigarettes were equally risky. he never said 18 that, he never said that. in fact, he 19 specifically was asked, do you think it is a 20 good idea to have throwback cigarettes that go 21 back to the 1950s without filters? and he 22 said, no, i certainly would not recommend that. 23 and if you will remember dr. benowitz, when 24 he was on the stand, testified that the 25 ultralow-tar cigarettes are, indeed, less 1 hazardous. not safe, but less hazardous than 2 the others. 3 all right. but mr. and mrs. piendle 4 bought their cigarettes based largely on taste 5 and sometimes price, but not safety. and the 6 testimony has been that they never smoked, as 7 their regular brand, any of the lowest tar and 8 nicotine cigarettes on the market, that the 9 public health community was advising smokers to 10 smoke and that the defendants made. they never 11 even smoked the lowest tar and nicotine styles 12 of the regular brands they did smoke. there 13 was no winston light or winston ultra lights, 14 it was the regular winston. and dr. benowitz, 15 as i said, testified those ultra lights were 16 less hazardous. 17 there are also claims that the defendants 18 manipulated nicotine in order to keep smokers 19 hooked. and there were three claims that were 20 made, and i just want to briefly touch on them, 21 i think they were all put to rest. 22 first, dr. cummings said the ph was 23 manipulated to increase free nicotine in 24 cigarette smoke. dr. figlar came in and he 25 presented data to you about the ph of cigarette 1 smoke from reynolds' products specifically and 2 commercial products generally, and it was 3 always below that 6.5 ph level. 4 below that level, the 5 henderson-hasselbalch curve, remember that 6 curve that you saw on a demonstrative from the 7 surgeon general's report, that dr. cummings 8 could not identify even when i told him the 9 name, that curve showed that there is little or 10 no free nicotine in cigarette smoke below the 11 6.5 ph, and all of the cigarettes were below 12 it. 13 in any event, in any event, even if there 14 were some evidence that the smoke ph had 15 increased, which there was not, which there was 16 not, dr. cummings testified on 17 cross-examination that it is only a theory that 18 increasing smoke ph increases addictiveness. 19 second, you heard dr. cummings talk about 20 tar to nicotine ratios. what he admitted on 21 cross, on cross-examination, and as dr. figlar 22 testified, that altering tar to nicotine ratios 23 was something that was first proposed by the 24 public health community, including dr. russell 25 in the united kingdom and the national cancer 6966 1 institute's less hazardous cigarette program, 2 and it was proposed as a way to potentially 3 develop a safer cigarette. 4 and the idea was -- remember, it is the tar 5 in cigarettes that cause disease. so if you 6 could increase nicotine relative to tar, you 7 would allow smokers to smoke for nicotine and 8 get less tar and presumably less risk. 9 and as dr. figlar testified, reynolds at 10 least tried, for many years in the laboratory, 11 to work on this idea, but it never incorporated 12 the idea into commercial cigarettes because the 13 smoke was out of balance, it was too harsh, and 14 consumers would not accept it. 15 third, dr. cummings testified that 16 reconstituted tobacco was utilized to control 17 nicotine dosing. 18 gosh, as dr. figlar explained, 19 reconstituted tobacco was developed and used in 20 commercial cigarettes for three reasons: one, 21 you could use the whole tobacco plant, you save 22 some money. two, reconstituted tobacco 23 delivers less tar and less nicotine than the 24 regular leaf does. and three, the smoke from 25 reconstituted tobacco, as tested by the 1 national cancer institute and the less 2 hazardous cigarette program, gives you less 3 tumors on the backs of mice than smoke that 4 comes from leaves. those were the reasons, and 5 dr. figlar emphatically said reconstituted 6 tobacco sheath is not used to control nicotine 7 dosing. 8 dr. burns came in and talked about dark 9 tobacco, and said, gosh, dark tobacco as used 10 in cigars and pipe tobacco might be safer than 11 the american blend, but then there were two 12 important points made on the cross-examination 13 by mr. kelly; the first was that the scientific 14 evidence shows that cigarettes, not cigars, not 15 pipes, but cigarettes made with the dark 16 tobacco are more dangerous than those made from 17 the american blend. and second, dr. burns knew 18 this all along, even while he testified 19 otherwise on direct. 20 you know, one of the things that i found 21 curious, and i actually did not make a note of 22 this before today, but plaintiffs actually put 23 up again that document from the 1950s that 24 somebody at reynolds proposed putting something 25 in filters to make them change colors when they 1 smoked so that people could see it, and from 2 the get-go, everybody has said that that was an 3 idea that was never pursued. 4 so why do we keep seeing it? i mean, am i 5 going to tell you that every memo that any 6 r.j. reynolds' employee ever wrote, and there is 7 been thousands of them over the years, there is 8 60 million documents, was a good idea? no, of 9 course not. some of those ideas were stupid, 10 that was one of them. but they keep showing it 11 even though they know it was never done, it was 12 never done. 13 all right. so where is the proof that the 14 cigarettes that mr. piendle smoked as his 15 regular brands had a defect, something the 16 defendants could have fixed as opposed to being 17 inherent risks to the product that was a 18 but-for or a legal cause of mr. piendle's lung 19 cancer? 20 i submit there was not any. tobacco 21 products are dangerous by nature, not by 22 design, and, indeed, the defendants' design 23 efforts, as described to you at some length by 24 dr. figlar, were all aimed at reducing the 25 risks of smoking. it is a hard thing to do, you 1 cannot make it safe, but that was the objective. 2 there was something curious that 3 mr. barnhart, i thought i heard, maybe i 4 misheard it, but i thought he said that all the 5 design modifications were enforced by law. i 6 do not know of a single design modification that 7 was enforced by law on cigarettes. reynolds, 8 philip morris, the other cigarette 9 manufacturers all went about this following the 10 suggestions of the public health community, not 11 because they were compelled to do so, but 12 because they wanted to reduce the risks. 13 think about it, why would a company that 14 makes consumer products want to kill the 15 consumers? that is just nutty. the objective 16 was to reduce risk. 17 all right. let us go the next finding. 18 negligence. defendants' r.j. reynolds tobacco 19 company and philip morris usa, inc., were 20 negligent, that is what the finding says. 21 again, i do not think it helps you very much. 22 you cannot go beyond it, you cannot speculate as 23 to what it means, the court has told you that, 24 and it does not tell you what the defendants did 25 that was negligent. it does not tell you when 1 the negligent act or acts occurred. and what 2 was plaintiff's proof that any negligent act by 3 r.j. reynolds or philip morris was a legal 4 but-for cause of mr. piendle's lung cancer and 5 death? 6 well, plaintiff talked a lot about 7 advertising and even made claims that the 8 defendants were targeting marketing at 9 mr. piendle when he was an adolescent. 10 but let us pull up the court's instruction. 11 and this is what the jury instructions say, in 12 part, on advertising. you may not find 13 liability based on the mere fact that the 14 defendants have advertised their product. you 15 may not hold the defendants liable because of 16 who may have found their cigarette advertising 17 or promotion to be appealing no matter how sexy 18 or glamorous or anything else. the only way 19 they get there is false, misleading, or 20 deceitful statements in advertising. 21 let us talk about that. plaintiff had 22 dr. cummings come in and testify that tobacco 23 ads were false and misleading because they 24 do not show sick or dead smokers, and that is 25 nonsense. advertising that shows happy and 1 attractive people is not false or misleading or 2 deceitful. 3 plaintiff claimed that the early filters 4 did not filter very much, but the 1950's data 5 from the page of the exhibit that mr. scarola 6 did not give to dr. figlar when he was on 7 cross-examination, but that i gave to him on 8 redirect, as well as dr. figlar's 9 apples-to-apples analysis of tar and nicotine 10 yields over time show that improvements were 11 made to the early filters very rapidly. i 12 could stop right here. advertising cannot be a 13 basis of liability in this case. but i'm not 14 going to. 15 plaintiff claimed repeatedly that the 16 defendants marketed to youth, you have seen some 17 of those documents, and no matter what you 18 thought when you came in here for jury service, 19 no matter what you thought before you got here, 20 you have to put it aside and focus on the 21 evidence. so let us talk about what that 22 evidence was. 23 okay. the first exhibit that you have seen 24 a couple of times was this 1984 memo from diane 25 burrows of my client, r.j. reynolds, and it 1 talks about younger adult smokers. and the 2 phrase "younger adult smokers" appears in this 3 memo about 200 times, and every single time 4 that it is defined, it is not always, but every 5 single time it is defined, it is defined as age 6 18 to 24, 18 to 24. 7 dr. cummings was undeferred by that fact, 8 and he would have you believe that the document 9 was all about targeting youth because it 10 included, as an appendix, a table from the u.s. 11 government survey of adults over the age 21, 12 the very same adult use of tobacco survey that 13 you have seen a couple of times during the course 14 of this trial and that dr. riddel testified 15 about in which adults were asked when they 16 started to smoke. that is it. 17 the next document. 18 this was dr. teague's thoughts on brands 19 for the youth market. it was made -- it was 20 authored in 1973, mr. piendle was 32, it was 21 written by dr. teague, who did not design 22 cigarettes, who was not in the marketing 23 department, and who you found out only in the 24 defense case begins this very memo by saying, 25 "at the outset, it should be said that we are 1 presently, and i believe unfairly, constrained 2 from directly promoting cigarettes to the youth 3 market, that is to those in the approximately 4 21-year-old and under age group." 5 so the memo starts out by recognizing that 6 what he is proposing is against the company's 7 policy. as you also heard from dr. figlar, 8 there is no evidence that dr. teague's proposal, 9 which was against the company's policy at the 10 time, was ever acted upon. 11 finally, we have this document from 12 dr. colby, it too was written in 1973 when 13 mr. piendle -- excuse me, '71 -- '73 when 14 mr. piendle was 32. there, again, you heard 15 from dr. figlar, based upon his review not only 16 of the internal research and development 17 documents, but also on its products that this 18 was ever followed up on. no throwback 19 cigarettes in the 1950s. in fact, you can see 20 that in the tar and nicotine yield data you 21 saw. 22 and if the defendants were marketing their 23 products to underage smokers, where are the 24 marketing plans identifying underage smokers as 25 a target? where are the focus group tests that 1 would have been done with the product or with 2 the ads? i mean, do you think the companies 3 put out ads in a product without ever testing 4 it on the target market? where was that 5 evidence? you did not see it. you did not see 6 it. 7 all right. dr. cummings and mr. barnhart, 8 too, spiced it up in playing winston ads that 9 ran during the flintstones tv show. 10 mr. scarola, as you recall, did not ask 11 mr. cummings about the ad, he just played it. 12 and you had to wait for my cross-examination of 13 dr. cummings, when he admitted, he admitted 14 that when those advertisements ran, mr. piendle 15 was an adult and the flintstones was an adult 16 comedy, it was modeled on the honeymooners. 17 mr. barnhart, i think, misspoke during his 18 closing earlier today when he said it was a kid 19 show. it was not, it was an adult comedy that 20 ran at 8:30 at night. and when the flintstones 21 did move to saturday mornings, reynolds dropped 22 its sponsorship. you also heard today and 23 again during trial ads from r.j. reynolds 24 advertising winston on the beverly hillbillies. 25 but again, dr. cummings, on direct examination, 1 did not share with you the fact that reynolds 2 dropped its sponsorship of the beverly 3 hillbillies in 1967 when mr. piendle was 26, 4 after audience survey show that high levels of 5 minors were watching the show, and he only 6 admitted that on cross. 7 reynolds, moreover, stopped advertising 8 winston on that show two years before 9 mr. piendle even started smoking winstons in 10 1969 at age 28, and the only reason he started 11 smoking winstons was because mrs. piendle got 12 him to do it. okay. that was her brand. 13 finally, and you saw this again today, 14 dr. cummings talked in his -- in my 15 cross-examination about creating controversy, 16 and one of the controversies he created were 17 the 1990 letters to the willis elementary 18 school principal where dr. cummings, remember, 19 went in and lectured to the students, talked to 20 them about trademark violations, talked to them 21 about the tobacco industry's position, got them 22 to write letters, and reynolds responded. 23 was that a really smart thing to do? 24 yeah. what does it have to do with 25 mr. piendle? i mean, it really was not. 1 where was the evidence that any of the 2 cigarettes that mr. piendle smoked before 1957 3 when he was 16, remember that was the legal age 4 to smoke in connecticut at the time, were 5 marketed to youth? there was not any. none. 6 moreover, where was the evidence that 7 mr. piendle smoked because of any ad? 8 dr. cummings, of course, came in here and 9 testified about the ubiquitous influence of 10 marketing on mr. piendle's age cohort. and he 11 really did not have a good answer from one of 12 you about the influences on mr. piendle's age 13 cohort that did not decide to smoke, did not 14 really answer that question. of course, 15 everybody is exposed to advertising. 16 advertising does not explain why somebody starts 17 or does not start smoking. 18 and then dr. cummings had little or 19 nothing to say about mr. piendle as an 20 individual. i specifically asked him on 21 cross-examination if he could identify any 22 specific advertisement that mr. piendle saw, 23 read, or heard. answer, no. nor could he 24 identify any advertising that mr. piendle 25 relied on in deciding to continue to smoke. 1 nobody did. nobody testified that mr. piendle 2 started or continued to smoke because of any 3 cigarette ad. to the contrary, let us look at 4 what people actually had to say about 5 mr. piendle. 6 his brother, mr. edward piendle, did not 7 think his brother relied on anything in 8 particular when he decided to start smoking or 9 to continue smoking. lucille worobel never 10 paid much attention to cigarette commercials in 11 the 1980s. mr. cabral, mr. piendle did not make 12 his decisions about smoking because of the 13 marlboro man. nobody said ads were important 14 to him. and, indeed, if mr. cabral -- if 15 mr. piendle experimented with smoking because 16 of the marlboro billboard, why did he 17 experiment with lucky strikes or pall mall 18 instead of marlboro? 19 now, there is mrs. piendle. she testified 20 she did not know why mr. piendle smoked marlboro 21 cigarettes. she admitted that mr. piendle 22 never mentioned any specific advertisement for 23 any cigarette ad and she testified that 24 mr. piendle never blamed his lung cancer on a 25 cigarette advertising. 1 and ask yourselves this, if mr. piendle 2 was a hapless victim of advertising, as 3 plaintiff's would apparently have you believe, 4 what was he doing smoking a woman's cigarette, 5 like virginia slims? if advertising was so 6 important to him, would not that have rubbed 7 against the grain? 8 all right. plaintiff also displayed a 9 frank statement, and we are still on negligence, 10 and they talk about cooperation with the public 11 health authorities, and they pointed to the 12 statement where the tobacco industry said, we 13 always have and always will cooperate with 14 basically the guardians of public health. 15 and i'll talk about the not proven 16 statements later when we get concealment, i 17 want to spend some time on that. but there is 18 been no evidence that mr. piendle ever saw the 19 frank statement. 20 i want to talk about how many newspapers 21 that ran -- 22 the clerk: counselor, one hour. 23 mr. biersteker: one hour. goodness 24 gracious, i'm going to have to talk faster. 25 they talked about all the newspapers it 1 appeared in, but it ran for one day and one day 2 only, on january 1st, 1954, when mr. piendle 3 was 13 years old, and there was no evidence 4 that any of his smoking decisions were based on 5 anything in the frank statement or on any 6 cooperation or lack of cooperation with the 7 public health authorities. 8 and i've got more i'd like to say, but let 9 me just skip to the bottom line. there was 10 plenty of evidence that apart from the not 11 proven statements, let us put those aside and 12 we will deal with them later, apart from the not 13 proven and not addictive statements that the 14 tobacco industry cooperated with public health 15 authorities. they cooperated in important 16 ways. they cooperated in the design of their 17 cigarettes, both in response to the suggestions 18 of the public health community and as part of 19 the national cancer institute's less hazardous 20 cigarette program. they cooperated by 21 publishing research and making presentations at 22 scientific meetings. they cooperated by 23 funding independent scientific research through 24 ctr grants. 25 remember when dr. cummings was on the 1 stand, i think it was dr. cummings, talking 2 about the nobel prize laureate -- nobel 3 laureates would receive grant funding and were 4 free to publish in peer-reviewed literature, 5 talked about the thousands of articles that 6 appeared, talked about how hundreds of them 7 have been cited in the surgeon general's 8 reports. 9 so let us turn to concealment. there are 10 two findings, they are long, i'm not going to 11 read them to you, but i'll show them on the 12 screen. there is the first one, concealment, 13 and the next one, agreed to conceal. 14 now, during this trial, plaintiff 15 cherrypicked from the 60 million pages or so of 16 internal tobacco industry documents that are 17 publicly available, documents from the 18 defendants, from other tobacco companies, 19 documents from the tobacco institute and 20 council for tobacco research, neither which 21 exist anymore, and they called experts to come 22 in and testify about them. and mr. barnhart 23 spent a fair amount of time on concealment in 24 his closing, that is about all he talked about. 25 it is critically important for you to keep 1 in mind that this case is still about 2 mr. piendle. remember, that is why we are here. 3 and that means you must determine what all of 4 those documents had to do with mr. piendle's 5 choices about smoking, where is the bridge? 6 where is the bridge? 7 the court has instructed you on the law as 8 it relates to that question. the court has 9 instructed you that the law requires that 10 plaintiff prove that mr. piendle relied, to his 11 detriment, on a failure to disclose in a 12 statement the information that the plaintiff 13 argues was concealed and not otherwise known. 14 plaintiff has the burden to show all of that, 15 that the concealment of that information also 16 was a legal cause of mr. piendle's death and 17 lung cancer, and that is a tall order, it is a 18 tall order. 19 ask yourselves this, i said this in 20 opening and i'll say it again: does it make 21 any sense to say that what mr. piendle already 22 knew about the health risks of smoking, going 23 all the way back to high school, cancer sticks 24 and coffin nails, did not matter, the warnings 25 did not matter to him. what he must have read 1 in newspapers and seen on tv from the public 2 health authorities, that did not matter. what 3 the surgeon general said did not matter. what 4 his friends and family said did not matter. but 5 it would have made all the difference in the 6 world if reynolds or philip morris had said, 7 hey, mr. piendle, you have got a 10 to 15 percent 8 chance of dying from lung cancer if you smoke 9 for a long time. does that make any sense? 10 does it make any sense that the tobacco 11 industry's denials that nicotine was addictive, 12 which occurred in 1988, that is when the surgeon 13 general changed the definition, we are going to 14 talk about that, in 1988, not before, that 15 those denials had anything to do with 16 mr. piendle's lung cancer? no, there is no 17 bridge. 18 all right. let us talk about the internal 19 documents that relate to the question of 20 addiction. and i'm not going to go through all 21 the documents, i cannot, i'm running out of time 22 as it is. what i want to do instead is i want 23 to review the evidence that will enable you to 24 evaluate those documents when you deliberate, 25 and then i want to talk about one example, and 1 it is an example that plaintiff's focused on 2 repeatedly. and there are five basic points i 3 want to talk about. 4 next slide, please, will. 5 it is long been known it is hard to quit. 6 dr. burns told you that it is long been known 7 that it is hard to quit, it goes back to the 8 days of columbus. dr. cummings told you that 9 once somebody starts smoking, it is been 10 well-known to the public, not just scientists, 11 that it could be hard to quit even before 12 mr. piendle started smoking in the 1950s. 13 dr. norrell testified about the use of slang, 14 he talked about songs, he talked about school 15 textbooks, all this drove home the point that 16 once you start, it can be hard to the general 17 public. 18 and remember that plaintiff introduced no 19 evidence at all that the defendants in this 20 case ever denied that fact, it can be hard to 21 quit. dr. cummings tried. he said that one 22 industry document said otherwise. i can tell 23 you right now, it was plaintiff's exhibit 2510, 24 it was the press release that was issued in 25 connection with the 1988 surgeon general's 1 report. and when you go back and deliberate, 2 review it, read it, it makes factually correct 3 observations, millions of folks have quit, 4 95 percent without any assistance and so forth. 5 but as they used to say in the dutch dairy 6 farming community, i grew up in wisconsin, you 7 can read that document until the cows come home 8 and you will never find a statement denying 9 that it can be hard to quit, it is just not 10 there. 11 in fact, the only person who said at this 12 trial that it can be easy to quit was 13 dr. cummings in his smart moves brochure that 14 we asked him about during his examination. and 15 remember dr. riddel, she showed you the data 16 from the government's adult use of tobacco 17 surveys that show that two-thirds of male 18 former smokers -- 19 we have the slide, will? 20 yeah, two thirds of male former smokers 21 reported, you add up these two numbers, it is 22 about two-thirds, said it was fairly or very 23 easy to quit, but the point is and remains, it 24 was no secret that smoking can be hard to quit. 25 second, second point i want you to keep in 1 mind when you look at these documents. second 2 point is, as dr. cummings testified, people 3 tend to use the word "addiction," "dependence," 4 "habit," and "habituation" interchangeably. 5 even dr. cummings, a ph.d. scientist, admits 6 that he did just that. so it should not be 7 surprising when you go through millions, tens 8 of millions of pages of internal company 9 documents, you will be able to find examples 10 where the author used the word "addiction" or 11 "addictive," but that does not mean that the 12 author meant anything other than it is hard to 13 quit or that the author knew something 14 different than everyone else. 15 third point, dr. benowitz. dr. benowitz 16 told you that scientists have long known about 17 the pharmacological properties of nicotine, 18 including on the central nervous system. it is 19 something that has been studied since the early 20 1900s, for decades before mr. piendle started 21 to smoke. in fact, as you will recall, the 22 tobacco industry collected and summarized 23 publications on the effects of nicotine on the 24 body and the green monster, and that was one of 25 the books that was used to help prepare the 1 1964 surgeon general's report. and there is 2 been no evidence that defendants ever denied 3 that nicotine has effects on the brain. again, 4 not a secret that nicotine has pharmacological 5 effects, including on the brain and, indeed, it 6 was discussed in the 1964 surgeon general's 7 report. 8 the fourth point to keep in mind as you 9 look at the documents, it has long been known 10 that tobacco contains nicotine and that people 11 smoke for nicotine, long been known. and, in 12 fact, dr. benowitz told you that scientists and 13 the public at large have known for over 100 14 years that tobacco has nicotine in it. and as 15 the 1964 surgeon general's report observed, 16 nobody smoked cigarettes that do not have 17 nicotine, commonly known, not a secret. 18 fifth, i want to talk about this. the 19 whole dispute about whether to label nicotine 20 and addiction as opposed to a habit was about 21 definitions and labels. as dr. benowitz 22 admitted, it came about when the surgeon 23 general adopted a different definition of 24 addiction in 1988, a year before mr. piendle 25 quit. the definition had changed. no longer 1 was there a need for intoxication, no longer 2 was there a need for severe or life-threatening 3 withdrawal, and then they also dropped the 4 requirement for antisocial behavior and, voila, 5 smoking and even caffeine became an addiction 6 just like heroin and alcohol. it was not a 7 change in science, dr. benowitz told you this. 8 put up the next slide. 9 okay. he said, basically, under the 1964 10 surgeon general's definition, if you apply it 11 to what science knows today, today, about 12 nicotine and smoking, smoking is still a habit. 13 and if you flip it around and you take the 1988 14 surgeon general's report's definition and apply 15 it to what science knew back in 1964, smoking 16 would have been an addiction. the tobacco 17 industry, including these defendants, were 18 unhappy about getting lumped together with 19 heroin and alcohol. that is understandable, i 20 think. 21 so starting in 1988, the tobacco industry 22 publicly denied that smoking was addictive, 23 citing as my client did, even tried to do in 24 those 1994 congressional hearings, the real 25 differences between nicotine and other drugs 1 like heroin in terms of intoxication and 2 withdrawal effects. 3 but here is the main one, as dr. cummings 4 admitted on cross-examination, the label 5 does not really matter. what matters is the 6 behavior, and that never changed. 7 okay. so i want you to keep those points 8 in mind and i want to talk about just one 9 document that you have seen several times now. 10 it was the document written in 1972 by 11 dr. teague and it concerned nicotine and 12 smoking. the plaintiffs made it sound as if 13 dr. teague had secret information about 14 nicotine that was otherwise unknown. 15 i want you to take a close look at what 16 dr. teague said and when he said it, and 17 compare it to what was said in the 1964 surgeon 18 general's report about the role of nicotine and 19 smoking. 20 dr. teague says, "tobacco products 21 uniquely contain and deliver nicotine, a potent 22 drug with a variety of physiological effects." 23 1972. 24 surgeon general, eight years earlier. a 25 published document. "the habitual use of 1 tobacco was related primarily to psychological 2 and social drives reinforced and perpetuated by 3 the pharmacologic actions of nicotine on the 4 central nervous system." 5 and take a look at a 1942 paper by lennox 6 johnston. johnston had the exact same theory 7 30 years before dr. teague wrote his memo, his 8 think piece. dr. teague: "thus, tobacco is in 9 essence a vehicle for delivery of nicotine, 10 designed to deliver the nicotine in a generally 11 acceptable and attractive form." 12 what did you learn about dr. johnston in 13 1942? smoking was essentially a means of 14 administering nicotine, just as opium is a 15 means of administering morphine. 1942, 30 16 years before dr. teague wrote his think piece. 17 and dr. johnston was far from the first to 18 write about the compulsive use of nicotine and 19 to draw the analogy to smoking opium. 20 next slide. 21 this was the surgeon general's report in 22 evidence in 1988. as early as the 1920s and 23 '30s, some investigators were concluding that 24 nicotine was responsible for the compulsive use 25 of tobacco products. that theory appeared not 1 only in scientific publications, but in the 2 popular press as well, long before dr. teague 3 ever picked up his pen and wrote this paper. 4 next slide, please. 5 reader's digest, 1938. he wrestles with 6 his addiction. 7 okay. let us return to mr. piendle. 8 that is our focus, that is where our attention 9 belongs. the earliest public statement by the 10 tobacco industry denying that smoking is 11 addictive that is in evidence in this case is 12 from 1988. that is not surprising because 13 that is when the surgeon general changed the 14 definition. 15 by that time, mr. piendle knew how easy or 16 hard it was for him to quit smoking personally 17 because of new year's resolutions that he and 18 mrs. piendle made in '70s and '80s. 19 what difference, the tobacco industry 20 denying that smoking was addicting, what 21 difference would that have made to mr. piendle? 22 he already knew. he already knew based on his 23 own personal experience trying to quit, and 24 there was zero evidence, zero evidence that 25 mr. piendle's choices about his smoking would 1 have been different if only the tobacco 2 industry had said, gosh, quitting smoking can 3 be hard, which mr. piendle must have known, and 4 there is no evidence that he never tried to 5 change his behavior in 1964 when the surgeon 6 general said it was a habit, or that he tried 7 to change his smoking behavior in 1988 when the 8 surgeon general said it was an addiction, no 9 evidence of that whatsoever. 10 let us turn to the last concealment issue, 11 the last bridge issue involving the findings, 12 and that is smoking and disease. and i'm sorry, 13 it is getting late. i'm trying to go as fast as 14 i can. 15 the last bridge issue, the not proven 16 statements relating to smoking and disease. 17 and i'd like to start again by setting a little 18 context, and after that you will again focus on 19 mr. piendle specifically, as we all must, 20 because again, this case is about him. 21 first, as admitted by dr. burns, there 22 really was a dispute among scientists, 23 notwithstanding the available evidence about 24 whether smoking could be said to cause lung 25 cancer before 1964. it was not a dispute about 1 what the evidence was. by the mid-1950s, 2 scientists, public health authorities, the 3 tobacco industry all knew that smokers got more 4 lung cancer than nonsmokers in the studies that 5 had been published. they all knew that 6 cigarette smoke contained trace levels measured 7 at the level of billionths of a gram of 8 carcinogens, no secret, it was in reader's 9 digest. and they all knew that mice painted 10 with tobacco smoke condensate developed tumors. 11 it was in life magazine. everybody knew that. 12 but there still was a dispute about what 13 evidence was sufficient to establish cause, 14 whether you also needed an animal model based 15 upon inhalation of cigarette smoke, or you 16 needed a mechanism. and that is because those 17 are the traditional means of proving cause that 18 medicine and science was accustomed to because 19 they focused on infectious diseases where you 20 can identify the bacteria. 21 and that is what the argument was about. 22 and it might seem silly to us today, but it 23 was not back in the 1950s and early 1960s. 24 there was a genuine dispute then. 25 and that is an important reason -- next 1 demonstrative, please, that is 265. that is why 2 we had a surgeon general's report. "few 3 medical questions have stirred such public 4 interest and created more scientific debate 5 than the tobacco health controversy. the 6 interrelationships of smoking and health 7 undoubtedly are complex, the subject does not 8 lend itself to easy answers." 9 there was a debate, the report says so. 10 and if you have any doubt about what it was 11 about, let us go to the next slide. 12 various means and conceptions of the term 13 "cause" were discussed vigorously at a number 14 of meetings of the committee and its 15 subcommittee. the guys who were writing the 16 1964 report, and i think they were all guys 17 back in 1964, discussed vigorously what they 18 meant by cause. they were still arguing about 19 it. 20 and even after 1964, as you know and as 21 you have heard, doctors oftentimes did not 22 understand the epidemiological evidence or get 23 on the anti-smoking bandwagon. in fact, i 24 think dr. burns said on cross-examination that 25 the american medical association did not get 1 fully onboard until the late 1960s. 2 and you also heard dr. burns testify that 3 his former boss, surgeon general julius 4 richmond, said he would have no criticism of 5 anybody who said it had not been proven whether 6 cigarette smoking caused disease before 1964. 7 so, for example, in 1954 in the frank 8 statement, the tobacco industry said, "we do not 9 believe our products are injurious to health." 10 you know what, that is also what the chief 11 executive officers were saying to 12 hill & knowlton. here's what they told them a 13 couple of weeks before the frank statement was 14 published. this is the internal document. 15 "the industry is strongly convinced that there 16 is no sound scientific basis for the charges 17 that have been made." 18 what they were saying internally they 19 believed was consistent with what they were 20 saying in the frank statement in 1953 and in 21 1954. 22 plaintiff talked a lot about a document 23 from my client in 1953 by claude teague. 24 next slide please, will. 25 you know, this was a review of the 1 published literature. i thought i heard 2 mr. barnhart say that this was not public 3 knowledge. all the entire basis, if we go back 4 and look at this exhibit in evidence, every 5 single source that he cites, and he was pretty 6 thorough about having citations, is from 7 published literature. and there is no 8 conclusion, as you saw, i think, on 9 cross-examination of dr. burns -- 10 next exhibit. 11 -- that dr. teague concluded that smoking 12 causes lung cancer, to the contrary. he said, 13 "in spite of observation, research, and 14 theorizing for the past 200 years, the cause of 15 spontaneous human cancer is still unknown." 16 next exhibit that you have seen. you have 17 seen this one too. exhibit 269, please, will. 18 this was the document entitled "critical 19 and objective appraisal." it is in evidence. 20 it is clearly a draft when you look at it. you 21 can see on this excerpt handwritten edits that 22 they are all over the document. 23 and plaintiff a couple of times had read 24 the sentence that immediately precedes it, 25 which basically says the amount of evidence to 1 indict cigarette smoking is overwhelming and 2 the evidence on the other side of the coin is 3 scant. 4 but what they did not read to you is, 5 "however, the evidence from epidemiological, 6 pathological, biological, and chemical studies 7 supporting the proposition that lung cancer is 8 caused by or associated with cigarette smoking 9 is parallelled by similar evidence supporting 10 the proposition that lung cancer is caused by 11 or associated with air pollutants. in some 12 cases the evidence seems to be stronger in 13 support of cigarette smoke as a causative or 14 associated factor, in other instances the 15 evidence seems to be stronger in the support of 16 air pollutants as a causative or associated 17 factor." 18 it does not sound to me like dr. rodgman 19 had it all figured out in 1962, and is it -- it 20 should not come as any great surprise to any of 21 us that in 1962 there are documents in the 22 files of the tobacco industry that talk about 23 smoking and health. after all, the 1964 24 surgeon general's report was coming out very 25 shortly. 1 okay. what about after 1964? well, the 2 tobacco industry still refused to accept the 3 epidemiologic evidence as sufficient, and it 4 stubbornly clung to the mechanism animal model 5 school of thought, and they did that for too 6 long, for far too long. 7 after 1964, however, that smoking causes 8 lung cancer and other diseases was hardly a 9 secret, and the not-proven statements and 10 concealment of the tobacco industry were the 11 subject of ridicule more than they were 12 reliance. 13 and what difference did any of this make 14 to mr. piendle? and plaintiff essentially ran 15 away from this issue and instead she chose to 16 talk once again about mr. piendle's birth 17 cohort. and you saw statistics and you heard 18 testimony about that. 19 and again, we are not here to try a case 20 about mr. piendle's birth cohort, we are here 21 for mr. piendle. nonetheless, i want to take 22 just a few minutes to talk about some of the 23 statistics, and i want to focus on the period 24 from 1964 to 1974. 25 why do i chose to focus there? 1964 is 1 the year in which the surgeon general attempted 2 to end the genuine scientific dispute about 3 whether smoking caused lung cancer. before 4 that, again, there was a genuine dispute, the 5 tobacco company had pretty good company, 6 including the scientists at the national cancer 7 institute and the american medical association. 8 why did i pick 1974 as the ending? 9 because as you might remember, dr. burns 10 testified that if mr. piendle had quit smoking 11 before 1975, he likely, from a statistical 12 standpoint, would have avoided his lung cancer. 13 okay. now, ordinary people were ahead of 14 the scientists, dr. burns admitted that, and 15 dr. norrell showed you that, even before 1964, 16 there is plenty of evidence that they thought 17 smoking was harmful and addictive. indeed, in 18 1957, the surgeon general thought no warning 19 was necessary on the cigarettes because the 20 media had done such an excellent job in 21 covering the emerging science. 22 you heard from dr. reynolds. she was here 23 testifying for the very first time ever as an 24 expert witness, and she explained that in 1960, 25 half of the american public believed that 1 smoking caused lung cancer, even though the 2 scientists were still arguing about it and the 3 first surgeon general's report would not come 4 out for another four years in 1964. 5 now, it is true that the point estimates, 6 the precise estimate given for the belief 7 levels of smokers compared to the public as a 8 whole were lower, but dr. riddel explained that 9 she could not say that the estimates for smokers 10 and the public as a whole were really different 11 numbers statistically because of the increased 12 sampling error when you start splitting up the 13 size of the sample. 14 the point is that by 1964, the information 15 available to the public, including 16 mr. piendle's cohort, about the health risks of 17 smoking was overwhelming, as dr. norrell 18 testified. 19 and you may recall, the ama in 1965, 1966, 20 do not hold me to the year, basically said no 21 warning is necessary on cigarette packs because 22 everybody knows. we got the quote from 23 dr. horn a little later in the 1960s. and you 24 heard several times, you could shout from the 25 rooftop, cigarette smoking is dangerous, and 1 you would not be telling anybody anything they 2 did not already know. 3 so what was the net effect, the net effect 4 of all of the information that was out there in 5 1964, including advertisements, including 6 tobacco industry not-proven statements, what 7 was the net effect on the public's awareness 8 and belief? 9 dr. riddel told you. she went to the 1964 10 adult use of tobacco survey -- 11 if we could have demonstrative 245, will. 12 -- and 81 percent of adults were aware 13 that the surgeon general's report concluded in 14 1964 that smoking causes lung cancer. 15 let us look at belief. 16 next demonstrative, 246, please. 17 again, from the adult use of tobacco 18 survey, the government survey, the gold 19 standard, 82 percent thought smoking was 20 harmful in 1964. i do not have a number to show 21 you on lung cancer because that question was not 22 asked in that year. 23 okay. in 1966, we talked about the 24 warnings, they changed. dr. riddel told you 25 93 percent of smokers saw them, and 1 mrs. piendle said that mr. piendle must have 2 seen them too. 3 in 1970, the warning changed. smoking is 4 dangerous to your health. and what about the 5 ads that plaintiff would have you believe 6 turned everybody into a hapless victim? well, 7 in 1971, they disappeared from radio and 8 television, and a year later, in 1972, the 9 remaining print ads all started carrying 10 warnings. 11 by 1974, the information environment 12 identified by dr. norrell was incredibly rich 13 and it was dominated, dominated by the message 14 from the public health community. 15 and again, what was the net effect on the 16 public's belief of all this information, 17 including tobacco company ads and tobacco 18 company not-proven statements? and again, 19 dr. riddel showed you. i do not have a survey 20 from 1974. we got one from '75. 21 demonstrative 246, please. is this it? 22 and ninety percent of the folks then believed 23 that smoking was harmful. 24 if we look at the gallup poll from 1977. 25 again, there is no survey in '74, '75, and '76, 1 so i cannot show you those. but gallup in 1977. 2 81 percent of the people believed that smoking 3 was a cause of lung cancer. 4 in short, the statistical evidence shows 5 that despite what the tobacco industry said or 6 did not say, the clear message from a host of 7 sources had gotten through loud and clear to 8 the american public by 1974. 9 okay. let us talk about what plaintiff has 10 tried to avoid. the evidence regarding the 11 effect of all this on mr. piendle, not on his 12 birth cohort, and not just from 1964 to 1974. 13 and let us look at what mrs. piendle told you in 14 her testimony here in court. 15 if i could have demonstrative -- here you 16 go. 17 she could not say for sure what caused 18 mr. piendle to smoke. she did not know if there 19 was anything r.j. reynolds tobacco company or 20 philip morris could have told mr. piendle that 21 would have caused him not to smoke. she cannot 22 say what caused mr. piendle to continue smoking 23 before the time that he became addicted. she 24 does not know if anything r.j. reynolds or 25 philip morris said or did made mr. piendle 1 continue smoking after he became addicted. 2 there is more. she does not know if there is 3 anything r.j. reynolds or philip morris could 4 have said or done that would have made 5 mr. piendle stop smoking any sooner than he 6 did. she does not know if there is anything 7 r.j. reynolds or philip morris could have said 8 or done differently that would have avoided 9 mr. piendle's lung cancer. and even if 10 r.j. reynolds and philip morris never made a 11 single cigarette, she did not know if 12 mr. piendle would have avoided his lung cancer 13 and death. that is pretty powerful evidence, i 14 submit, and it is specific to mr. piendle. 15 there is no bridge, no bridge. 16 all right. third major issue. i've got 17 to move along. third major issue is fault, 18 responsibility. you only get this far if you 19 find that plaintiff has proven, has built that 20 bridge between the defendant's conduct and 21 mr. piendle's lung cancer, but-for clause, if 22 you find that, you get to responsibility of 23 fault. and you saw the verdict form. it asked 24 you to allocate fault as among mr. piendle, 25 reynolds and philip morris. 1 i want to talk about that now. again, 2 nobody forced mr. piendle to start smoking in 3 the eighth or ninth grade. nobody forced him 4 to smoke socially or once in a while. when he 5 was in high school, he knew that cigarettes 6 caused cancer and death, cancer sticks, coffin 7 nails. nobody forced him to continue smoking 8 after he graduated from high school, all the 9 way up until 1989. 10 smokers, even addicted smokers, as you 11 know, had the ability to quit. the basic fact 12 is unchallenged, and all of the experts agree, 13 here is just one example in the interest of 14 time from dr. cummings. 15 you have -- 270, please. 16 he was physically capable of quitting 17 smoking for good during any year that he smoked 18 from the 1950s all the way through 1988, true? 19 sure. sure. and the fact that it can be hard 20 for some, a fact that dr. benowitz has said has 21 been well-known for over a hundred years, 22 does not alter the fact that smokers have the 23 ability to quit. 24 mr. piendle had that ability. you do not 25 have to draw theoretical inferences to reach 1 that conclusion, because we know he did quit in 2 1989. 3 you know also some statistics, 60 million 4 smokers have quit, 95 percent without any 5 assistance, more former smokers alive today 6 than current smokers. and the vast majority of 7 those former smokers, under the rules of thumb 8 that plaintiff would have you believe is 9 sufficient to define addiction in this case, 10 almost all of them are probably addicted under 11 those rules of thumb. 12 the clerk: counselor, 30 minutes. 13 mr. biersteker: thank you. 14 so let me start with a simple concept, 15 with the ability to quit smoking comes a 16 responsibility to quit. pretty simple and i 17 think true. there was nothing magical about 18 1989. there was nothing special or unique 19 about how mr. piendle quit smoking in 1989. he 20 quit cold turkey. could have done that 21 anytime. 22 and next demonstrative, 252, please. 23 mrs. piendle agreed, there was not anything 24 new about the health risks of smoking that 25 mr. piendle learned in 1989 that he did not know 1 before. 2 and next slide, please. 3 mrs. piendle had no reason to believe that 4 mr. piendle could not have quit smoking sooner 5 than he did, and she does not know why he did not 6 quit smoking sooner. mr. piendle bears 7 responsibility for not quitting smoking sooner 8 than he did, as well as for having started 9 smoking, and as well as for having chosen to 10 become a regular smoker. 11 the fact that he died of lung cancer is 12 tragic, i'm not going to tell you otherwise, 13 but it does not lessen his responsibility. 14 dr. burns agreed that just because somebody may 15 be addicted to nicotine does not relieve them 16 of responsibility for their own choices. they 17 have to make a decision to quit. dr. cummings, 18 smokers are fully responsible for making the 19 decision to quit. and you heard about the 20 surgeon general's report, smoking is a personal 21 choice of behavior. 22 and mrs. piendle admitted, during 23 cross-examination, that mr. piendle's decision 24 to start smoking was his decision, that he 25 decided for himself to become a regular smoker, 1 and ultimately he was an adult, he could make 2 his own decisions. and based upon what you 3 know about mr. piendle, the evidence suggests 4 that he would agree, he was not the kind of man 5 who sought to avoid responsibility for his 6 actions, the evidence was that he accepted full 7 responsibility for his choices in life, and we 8 know that from mrs. piendle. he never blamed 9 anyone else for his choices, it would have been 10 uncharacteristic of him to do so. 11 we talked about how he never blamed his 12 lung cancer on cigarette advertising. he never 13 blamed the tobacco companies for not having 14 warnings on cigarette packs earlier than 1966. 15 he never blamed tobacco companies for his lung 16 cancer because they did not give him more 17 information about the health risks of smoking 18 or addictiveness. he never blamed the tobacco 19 companies for his lung cancer for any reason. 20 indeed, mr. piendle had the best chance to 21 avoid his lung cancer, he had plenty of 22 opportunities. do not start smoking, do not 23 become a regular smoker, quit any time before 24 1975. and if he had seized any one of those 25 opportunities, we would not be here today. 1 he has the greatest responsibility for 2 failing to do so, and he should bear the 3 greatest allocation for fault in this case. 4 i submit that unlike mr. barnhart's 5 suggestion of 5 to ten percent, mr. piendle 6 bears at least seventy percent of the responsibility 7 for what happened. that is just a simple 8 acknowledgment of personal responsibilities 9 that we all bear for the choices we make in 10 life, especially when we are aware, as 11 mr. piendle was from the very beginning, of the 12 risks of smoking cancer sticks and coffin 13 nails. 14 let me discuss the responsibility of the 15 defendants, especially my client r.j. reynolds. 16 and at the outset i will say, i do not think 17 plaintiff has built that bridge, i do not think 18 you get here. and if you agree, you will not 19 consider the responsibility of the companies. 20 but if you do get this far, there are some 21 things i want you to consider. 22 the defendants' cigarettes are inherently 23 dangerous. they cannot be made safe, cannot be 24 done. they are still legal products, always 25 have been. defendants tried hard, starting in 1 the 1950s, to reduce the risks of smoking by 2 responding to the suggestions of the public 3 health community, by lowing tar and nicotine 4 yields, and pursuing other reasonable 5 suggestions. and well before 1975, the dangers 6 of legal cigarettes were plastered with 7 warnings on every pack and in every ad. 8 now, in her life with mr. piendle, 9 mrs. piendle, as you saw from the quote -- 10 let us put it up again, 248, please, will. 11 -- he was an adult, he could make his own 12 decisions, and as consequence, there is no 13 evidence that she ever warned him because she 14 had no doubt that he already knew. we know 15 that she never asked him to quit, we know that 16 she selected the cigarette brands, we know that 17 throughout their marriage she bought the 18 cigarettes, we know that she continued to 19 smoke, which no doubt made it harder for him to 20 quit. 21 he was an adult, he could make his own 22 decisions, exactly right, exactly right. and 23 as a consequence, the defense responsibility 24 should be zero or very small, precisely the 25 position the plaintiff takes with respect to 1 her life with her husband. 2 all right. but if you do allocate 3 responsibility to the defendants, i think you 4 should keep in mind the evidence concerning 5 mr. piendle's smoking history. and i want to 6 do this as quickly as i possibly can. 7 okay. in the 1950s, yeah, we know that he 8 smoked some lucky strikes, maybe some pall 9 mall. there was talk that when he was still in 10 high school, before he graduated, he smoked 11 cigarettes in a red pack, could have been 12 winstons, might have been marlboros, who knows. 13 from 1959, when he graduated high school, 14 all the way up through 1967, because remember, 15 he did not meet mrs. piendle until 1968, no one 16 really knows what brands he was smoking as his 17 regular brand. nobody who testified saw him 18 often enough in that period to know. there is 19 no evidence that he was smoking a brand that 20 was manufactured by either of the defendants in 21 this case, and it would be unfair and contrary 22 to the evidence -- remember, that is what you 23 have to decide this case on, in accordance with 24 the law -- contrary to the evidence to assign 25 responsibility to reynolds or philip morris for 1 any of mr. piendle's smoking during that 2 period. 3 okay. mrs. piendle meets him in 1968. at 4 that time, mr. piendle is smoking marlboros, a 5 brand made by philip morris, but there is no 6 evidence about how long he had been smoking it. 7 in 1969, mrs. piendle influences 8 mr. piendle to switch to winston cigarettes, 9 which he smokes until 1974. 10 keep in mind what i said earlier, 11 dr. burns testified if mr. piendle had quit 12 smoking before 1975, just about the time he 13 switches to raleigh cigarettes, which were made 14 by my client, he more likely than not would 15 have avoided his lung cancer from smoking. 16 so in fairness, if you find that the 17 defendant should share responsibility with 18 mr. piendle for his smoking, i would suggest 19 that it might be appropriate to focus on his 20 smoking after 1974. 21 in 1979, he switched to doral, again, a 22 reynolds product, which he smoked until 1985, 23 and then in 1985, a switch again from doral to 24 merit cigarettes, a brand made by philip 25 morris. 7012 1 so if you look at the brand history in 2 this period from 1975 to 1989, it is roughly 3 two-thirds reynolds, one-third philip morris. 4 okay. damages. two kinds of damages. 5 there are compensatory damages and punitive 6 damages. compensatory damages, as you have 7 heard, and nobody really disagrees, are meant 8 to compensate the plaintiff in this case for 9 her injury. and to determine the amount of 10 damages, compensatory damages to be awarded, 11 you should consider what the plaintiff has lost 12 and you should compensate her for that loss if 13 you get this far. 14 the determination that you will make will 15 fully compensate her for that loss. that is why 16 the law provided to you by the court calls 17 these damages compensatory damages. so if you 18 deliberate and decide to award compensatory 19 damages, the amount that you award will be the 20 amount that you all agree is necessary to make 21 the plaintiff whole. 22 if you decide she has met her burden, you 23 must decide how much money it will take to do 24 that. it is our legal system's way. and that is 25 a hard task. this is perhaps the most 1 difficult area of this case for you to separate 2 from your emotions -- 3 if we can have the demonstrative, please, 4 will. 5 -- from reason. 6 the court -- let us talk about that. do 7 not let sympathy influence your decision. it 8 must be based on the evidence that had been 9 received and the law on which the court has 10 instructed you. your duty is to be just and 11 fair. and, again, reynolds is just as much 12 interested in justice as mrs. piendle is. 13 so as the court has instructed you, and 14 you will see when you go to your road map, 15 compensatory damages are only to compensate 16 mrs. piendle for her loss of companionship, 17 starting at the time her husband passed away, 18 and the pain and suffering that accompanies 19 that loss. 20 under the law you are not allowed, as 21 mr. barnhart i think said, to consider the pain 22 and suffering and loss of any other witness who 23 testified here, no matter how genuine and how 24 deep that loss is. you cannot consider tracy 25 piendle, you cannot consider mr. edward piendle, 1 the sole focus is on mrs. piendle. 2 and, again, the sole focus when it comes 3 to mrs. piendle is for her loss of 4 companionship and the accompanying pain and 5 suffering. 6 so there is a couple of things i want you 7 to keep in mind as you think about what would 8 be fair. i think first you should keep in mind 9 the nature of the relationship between mr. and 10 mrs. piendle prior to his death. as of 1975, 11 mr. piendle was one hundred percent disabled due to his 12 crohn's disease. he received va disability 13 benefits, and mrs. piendle continues to receive 14 a pension from the va. he spent his time at 15 home, and mrs. piendle worked for 25 years as a 16 nurse, provided support and services for both 17 of them. and even when they were home at the 18 same time, they spent time apart. you heard 19 the testimony from mrs. piendle, he was kind of 20 a sports nut, she did not like sports. so, when 21 they watched tv, they would do it in separate 22 rooms. she would watch her programs. he would watched 23 his. 24 mr. piendle also worked in the garage with 25 his woodworking. mr. piendle's physical 1 condition, the crohn's disease, the arthritis 2 that prompted their move down to florida in 3 1980 impacted the quality of their life 4 together, and it would have continued to do so 5 as they got older. 6 now, mrs. piendle is asking you to award 7 money for her loss of companionship after 8 mr. piendle's death in 1996. that means you 9 also need to consider her life after 1996. she 10 continued to work for eight years after 11 mr. piendle died in the same nursing job she 12 had for 17 years before his death. 13 she owned her own business, the lawn 14 business for a while, and she invested in real 15 estate. she started dating about a year after 16 mr. piendle passed away, using online dating 17 services, and she had a ten-year relationship 18 with a man named jorge rodriguez, who she met 19 in 1998, and that is the picture, you may 20 recall, from christmas. 21 now, you heard a little about 22 mr. rodriguez, or jorge, during this trial, and 23 i want to talk about that. 24 if we could have defense demonstrative 25 250, will. 1 okay. let us talk about it. i think this 2 is confusing, kind of confusing me, and i knew 3 the background. 4 mrs. piendle was deposed in june of 2009, 5 and she was asked whether she had any serious 6 relationships, and she did not mention 7 mr. rodriguez. she also did not mention him 8 when she corrected her deposition transcript in 9 october of 2009. in the meantime, defense had 10 deposed tracy piendle, and she was asked about 11 any serious relationships her mom may have had 12 since her father's death. 13 and tracy piendle -- 14 mr. scarola: i'm sorry, your honor, but i 15 must object. that was not part of the 16 evidence. there was no such question asked of 17 tracy piendle. 18 mr. biersteker: well, it was. tracy 19 piendle, not mrs. piendle, told about 20 mr. rodriguez. 21 now, after tracy piendle's deposition, we 22 sent mrs. piendle written interrogatories, 23 those questions, and the questions followed up 24 and asked about jorge. the interrogatory 25 responses are in evidence. you will have them 1 in the jury room. 2 defendants had to ask those questions, 3 and -- these written questions, because 4 mrs. piendle did not tell us in her deposition 5 or when she corrected her deposition about the 6 relationship with jorge. so in december 2009, 7 she signed her answers to those questions, and 8 in may 2010 she amended the answers to provide 9 a more accurate picture about her relationship 10 with jorge. 11 now, let us talk about what happened at 12 trial. at trial, mrs. piendle admitted on 13 cross-examination by mr. henk that she did not 14 mention jorge in her deposition. and then 15 plaintiff's counsel did a redirect examination 16 of mrs. piendle, knowing that the defendants 17 would not be able to ask any more questions, and 18 they made it sound as though mrs. piendle had 19 been forthcoming about the relationship with 20 jorge all along, pointing to those very 21 interrogatory responses, but not telling you 22 the chronological sequence or the background. 23 and i do not really know a nice way to say 24 what i'm about to say, so i'm just going to say 25 it: that testimony was misleading. 1 so the defense was forced to call 2 mrs. piendle back to the stand in our case, so 3 that you could hear the rest of the story, and 4 that prompted mrs. piendle to testify that her 5 relationship with jorge was not serious because 6 it was not committed. 7 if we could have defense exhibit -- i 8 think it is 255. 9 now -- "well, i was not really ready to 10 settle down again and have a committed 11 relationship." 12 really? this was a ten-year relationship, 13 four years of which involved romantic activity. 14 next demonstrative, please, will, 255a. 15 and this is the interrogatory response. 16 again, you have got it. but if this 17 relationship was not committed, why did 18 mrs. piendle break it off because jorge wanted 19 to date another person? i do not know. it 20 sounds pretty committed to me to see just one 21 person for four years. 22 tracy, when she testified before you, said 23 it was a serious relationship, said it was one 24 that her mother was unlikely to forget. 25 tracy said that mrs. piendle and jorge 1 lived together for four years, which 2 mrs. piendle denies. and you know what, i 3 do not really care whether jorge's mail was 4 delivered to the same house as mrs. piendle's 5 or not. a relationship was serious enough that 6 tracy testified that jorge had become like a 7 grandfather to her daughter. 8 now, this evidence plainly goes to the 9 quality of mrs. piendle's life after the death 10 of mr. piendle. it is a sign that she was 11 moving on starting in 1998. but it is more than 12 that. it is more than that. it goes to the 13 credibility of mrs. piendle. 14 part of your job as judges of the facts is 15 to assess the credibility of witnesses. 16 if i could have demonstrative 275. there 17 it is. 18 you can look at the frankness or lack of 19 frankness of the witness, any interest the 20 witness may have in the outcome of the case, 21 the reasonableness of the testimony of the 22 witness considered in light of all of the 23 evidence. 24 you can reject all or part of the witness' 25 testimony and ask yourself, why did 1 mrs. piendle say "no" in june 2009 in her 2 deposition? why did not she mention jorge? why 3 did she and her counsel try to make it seem 4 like she had been forthcoming about jorge all 5 along. 6 and i submit there is no answers to those 7 questions that does not raise significant 8 questions or issues about the credibility of 9 mrs. piendle. you must consider that. i heard 10 ms. baker-barnes up here suggesting that maybe 11 $23 million was what they wanted. she said a 12 million dollars a year, at least for each and 13 every one of those years. she was up here on 14 the stand portraying her marriage to 15 mr. piendle as essentially perfect, the yin and 16 yang. remember that? never mind the one-year 17 separation, never mind the divorce filing, 18 never mind that she said she was attracted to 19 mr. piendle initially, in part, because he was 20 older and secure in life. 21 the clerk: counselor, ten minutes. 22 mr. biersteker: thank you. 23 finally, mrs. piendle testified she was 24 engaged to a man named jerry medina in 19 -- 25 2005. that is another serious commitment. 1 that is another sign that someone is moving on 2 with their life. time, in short, has helped to 3 heal, as one would hope it would, 4 mrs. piendle's loss of companionship. the 5 evidence has shown you that she is gone through 6 that healing process following her husband's 7 death 14 years ago. 8 based on the evidence, let me suggest some 9 numbers. it is understandable and reasonable 10 that the first year after mr. piendle's death 11 was probably the most difficult for 12 mrs. piendle. should you decide to award any 13 compensatory damages to mrs. piendle, a fair 14 amount of compensation for that year that you 15 should consider would be $150,000 that first 16 year. 17 mrs. piendle began dating after 18 mr. piendle passed away and met jorge rodriguez 19 shortly thereafter. she had a long-term close 20 relationship with him, four years of which 21 involved romantic activity. if tracy is right, 22 they lived together. it was a serious 23 commitment on her part. her romantic 24 relationship with jorge came to an end, but 25 shortly thereafter she met and became engaged 1 to jerry medina in 2005, and that was an even 2 greater commitment on her part. 3 so this was a roughly ten-year period, 4 from the time mrs. piendle began dating in 5 1997, and the end of her engagement in 6 approximately 2007 to mr. medina. the healing 7 process continued. i think a fair amount of 8 compensation for that ten-year period would be 9 approximately $75,000 a year for ten years, 10 totaling three-quarters of a million. 11 and finally, plaintiff introduced evidence 12 about the joint life expectancy of mr. and 13 mrs. piendle. it would have gone to 2019, 23 14 years after his death in 1996. you had the 15 opportunity to hear about her -- the events in 16 her life after the last 14 years since 17 mr. piendle passed away, and from that you have 18 an insight about what will occur for the last 19 nine years of that 23-year period, from now 20 until 2019. 21 so let us talk about the 12 years starting 22 in 2007, nine of which remain. starting three 23 years ago in 2007, roughly after the engagement 24 ended with mr. medina, until 2009, the healing 25 process for mrs. piendle will continue. she 1 will continue to enjoy life, as she did with 2 jorge, jerry, her friends and her family. 3 she will still have the opportunity to 4 travel, visit friends and relatives and live a 5 full and complete life. for this remaining 12 6 year of joint life expectancy from 2007 to 7 2019, a fair amount of compensation for 8 mrs. piendle should be approximately $50,000 9 for each and every one of those years. 10 now, if you add up everything i have 11 suggested, i think it comes out to about 12 $1.5 million. that is a significant sum. i ask 13 that you consider it. 14 all right. punitive damages. i'm in the 15 home stretch. as you already heard, punitive 16 damages serve two purposes, punishment and 17 deterrence. punitive damages are not to 18 compensate mrs. piendle. the compensatory 19 damages are for that. but she, not the 20 american cancer society or anybody else, would 21 receive any punitive damages that you award in 22 order to punish and deter the defendants. 23 as the court has explained in the 24 instructions, punitive damages cannot be 25 imposed for conduct that was not a legal cause 1 of mr. piendle's death. i'm going to say it 2 again. you cannot award punitive damages based 3 upon what you think was bad behavior in the 4 air. the conduct for which punitive damages, 5 if any, should be awarded for conduct, if any, 6 that you find was a legal cause of 7 mr. piendle's death. 8 so just to pick an example, if you find 9 that concealment was not a legal but-for cause 10 of mr. piendle's continued smoking and lung 11 cancer, there can be no punitive damages for 12 concealment. 13 okay. you must focus on that conduct, and 14 you have to focus on the character of the 15 conduct. defendants are liable for punitive 16 damages only if plaintiff additionally proves 17 that the conduct was so great, gross and 18 flagrant as to amount to reckless disregard, 19 conscious indifference. you saw that slide 20 when mr. barnhart was up here. 21 remember that here plaintiff's burden of 22 proof is much higher than for the other issues 23 in the case. it is clear and convincing 24 evidence, again defined in the jury 25 instructions. there is no absolute or 1 automatic right to punitive damages. plaintiff 2 has to meet that higher burden. 3 and let us talk about that. has she done 4 it? i do not think it will surprise you, i 5 suggest the answer is no. 6 let us talk about it. we have already 7 discussed that plaintiff has not proven legal 8 cause. i'm not going to repeat all that, but i 9 want to -- want you to remember mrs. piendle's 10 key admissions on this subject. 11 give it a minute, will. next slide, 12 please. 13 let us talk about the character of my 14 client's conduct, r.j. reynolds. let us talk 15 about the first one, design. reynolds' 16 cigarette design efforts were responsive to the 17 suggestions of the public health community. 18 dr. figlar must have said that two dozen times 19 when he was on the stand, and that includes 20 efforts to reduce tar and nicotine. 21 is not it true that you agree in 1997 -- 22 wait. what is that? 23 wrong slide. wrong slide. 24 as dr. burns testified -- 25 that was right. i'm sorry. i'm getting 1 hungry. that is a sign that i've been up here 2 too long. 3 as dr. burns testified, he thought in 1997 4 that it had been proven beyond a reasonable 5 doubt that low-tar cigarettes reduce risk of 6 lung cancer. i mean, you cannot look back with 7 the benefit 20-20 hindsight. you heard how 8 dr. burns and some other members of the public 9 health community today do not think that lower 10 tar or filtered cigarettes matter. 11 that is not the environment. we keep 12 hearing it -- well, take it back to the time 13 when mr. piendle was in the 1950s. well, take 14 the defense back, too, and the public health 15 community's clear and consistent message 16 throughout the time that mr. piendle was alive 17 was that the lower tar and nicotine cigarettes 18 were less hazardous. that is true, as 19 dr. burns is testifying here, even after 20 mr. piendle was deceased. were they safe? no. 21 but less hazardous. that is what we thought. 22 all right. advertising. cigarettes are a 23 legal product. they are legal to manufacture, 24 they are legal to advertise, they are legal to 25 sell, and, oh, by the way, r.j. reynolds 1 does not sell directly to consumers, for the 2 most part. their sales are to retailers and 3 wholesalers. 4 you are not here to decide whether it is 5 legal or illegal to sell cigarettes or whether 6 reynolds should be punished for doing so. our 7 society decided a long time ago that it is legal 8 to sell and advertise and manufacture 9 cigarettes, and that is a decision we continue 10 to adhere to. 11 congress, the surgeon general, and the 12 public health community have also made the 13 decision to let the public know about the 14 health risks of smoking and to let every adult 15 decide for herself or himself whether to smoke, 16 just us as mr. piendle did. and advertising 17 was one way in which reynolds and other 18 cigarette manufacturers competed for market 19 share. that is not gross or flagrant or 20 reckless conduct. it is competition. 21 the clerk: counsel. 22 mr. biersteker: how many minutes? 23 the clerk: three. 24 mr. biersteker: shoot. i may have to 25 steal a couple of minutes of my colleague's 1 time, if he will allow me. 2 let us talk about concealment. we talked 3 about that, a genuine scientific dispute up 4 until at least 1964. the tobacco industry's 5 position was one that was shared by others, 6 including the american medical association, the 7 national cancer institute, and scientists at 8 other institutions. 9 after 1964, the fact that smoking caused 10 lung cancer and other diseases was hardly a 11 secret. the vast majority of people, including 12 mr. piendle, knew and believed otherwise and 13 the industry's stubborn adherence to the not 14 proving point increasingly became a source of 15 ridicule. 16 denials of addiction started in 1988. 17 they were understandable. i do not know what 18 they had to do with mr. piendle. and all this 19 occurred against the backdrop of publications 20 of scientific research, innovations and design, 21 presentations to government authorities, 22 cooperation with the national cancer institute, 23 and so forth. plaintiffs did not prove, by 24 clear and convincing evidence, that punishment 25 is warranted. 7029 1 let us talk about the second function of 2 punitive damages, deterrence. since 1998, 3 there are 60 million pages of tobacco industry 4 documents that have been made public, and the 5 number grows daily. as new documents written 6 now, it added. concealment cannot occur. 7 there is also no need to deter the 8 defendants from making statements to the 9 general public denying that smoking causes 10 disease or is addictive. for ten years, the 11 defendants' web sites have publicly stated that 12 smoking causes disease, including lung cancer 13 and is addictive. 14 you should also know tobacco institute and 15 the council for tobacco research are gone since 16 1998. the people that authored many of the 17 documents you have seen, claude teague, frank 18 colby, murray senkus, alan rodgman, and my 19 client are gone. 20 mr. scarola: i'm sorry, your honor. i 21 do not believe there is any evidence in the 22 record with regard to those matters. nor is 23 that good conduct allegation appropriate 24 argument for this stage of the proceedings. 25 the court: okay. i'll sustain as to the 1 first basis. 2 mr. biersteker: all right. 3 let us talk about what dr. figlar told you 4 about reynolds, his consistent efforts to 5 reduce the inherent risks of conventional 6 tobacco-burning cigarettes; about premier and 7 eclipse, the tobacco-heating cigarettes; about 8 encouraging smokers who will not quit to switch 9 to smokeless tobacco products, such as camel 10 snus that mr. scarola put on the elmo. 11 the smokeless tobacco products that, as 12 dr. figlar told you, pose lesser health risks, 13 including a lesser risk of oral cancer than 14 conventional cigarettes; about niconovum, whose 15 products, if approved by the fda, will help 16 smokers quit. reynolds, of course, is still a 17 tobacco company. that is legal. 18 but given what you have heard, given its 19 decades long pursuit of reduced-harm products, 20 reduced-harm cigarettes; given its 21 encouragement to those who choose to use 22 tobacco products to migrate to reduced-risk 23 smokeless ones; given the plans to provide 24 assistance through niconovum to those who want 25 to quit; given the position on the company's 1 website for ten years that smoking causes 2 disease and is addictive, i propose there is no 3 reason to impose punitive damages to deter 4 r.j. reynolds from the kind of conduct that 5 occurred decades ago. 6 all right. i got literally one minute. i 7 do not know what mr. scarola or whomever else is 8 going to do the rebuttal case for plaintiff is 9 going to say. and i do not get another chance 10 to talk to you. this is it. i can see that 11 you are all disappointed. 12 but do me a favor, as you listen to 13 mr. scarola, please think about what i might 14 have said in response, based upon the evidence 15 you have heard and the instructions on the law 16 that the court has given you. 17 and let me close where i began: thanks 18 for listening. i know it s been a little bit 19 of a long haul this morning, and you are not 20 done yet. 21 i thank you for being fair, for being 22 impartial, for being dispassionate judges of 23 the facts and deciding this case on the 24 evidence and the law. 25 and on behalf of reynolds and everybody on 1 the defense side, and, i'm sure, plaintiffs, 2 too, thank you truly for your service. we 3 appreciate it. thanks. 4 the court: you are not done yet, but you 5 get a break. so we will have our lunch break 6 now, a little bit late. i apologize. we will be 7 in recess until 3:00 o'clock. so we will be in 8 recess for an hour and ten minutes. 9 please leave your notepads on your chair. 10 please remember the very important instruction 11 not to begin discussing the case with either 12 yourselves or anyone else. you are not to have 13 any contact with anyone associated with the 14 case, not to review any media or listen to any 15 media, should you exposed to it, about the case 16 over the break, and we will see you back at 17 3:00 o'clock. thank you very much. 8 closing argument 9 mr. kelly: thank you, your honor. i want 10 to make sure your computer is working. 11 the court: okay. start over again. 12 mr. kelly: take two. 13 the court: please give your attention to 14 philip morris' closing argument. 15 mr. kelly: may it please the court. 16 thank you, your honor, and counsel and 17 mrs. piendle. 18 ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. so 19 good to be able to look you in the eyes for a 20 change rather than pass you in the hallway 21 looking at my feet, so i'm going to take full 22 advantage of that this afternoon. 23 i have, according to our clerk, gina, 24 58.3 minutes to talk to you this afternoon. so 25 i'm going to get right to it. i think if i'm 1 going to talk half as long as everybody else, 2 i'll get twice as much attention. 3 mr. scarola: is that the way it works? 4 mr. kelly: i want to thank you for that 5 attention right at the beginning on behalf of 6 my client, philip morris, my partner, mr. henk, 7 and i appreciate your patience, and thank you 8 in advance for the rest of the afternoon paying 9 attention. 10 the plaintiff's lawyers in this case, 11 mrs. piendle's lawyers in this case, have 12 suggested to you that you award against philip 13 morris an enormous amount of money because 14 mr. piendle smoked, on occasion, philip morris 15 products during his 30 years of smoking. 16 on behalf of philip morris, our response 17 is that we have, that is, philip morris has no 18 legal responsibility under the evidence you have 19 been presented and the law you have been given to 20 pay mrs. piendle any money whatsoever for the 21 cigarettes that her husband smoked made by 22 philip morris over the course of his smoking 23 history. 24 let me tell you why. there is nothing that 25 philip morris did or did not do that caused 1 mr. piendle to start smoking, no. 1. there is 2 nothing that philip morris did or did not do, 3 other than sell cigarettes, which i'll talk 4 about later. there is nothing that philip 5 morris did or did not do that caused mr. piendle 6 to continue smoking those philip morris 7 cigarettes; and thirdly, there is nothing that 8 philip morris did or did not do that prevented 9 mr. piendle from quitting smoking. 10 when charlie piendle smoked his first 11 cigarette sometime in the 1950s, the marlboro 12 cowboy had not yet been born. when mr. piendle 13 smoked his first cigarettes in the 1950s, they 14 were still selling cigarettes one at a time at 15 the corner store. when mr. piendle started 16 smoking, his family did not have a television 17 set. those are some of the facts in the 18 evidence that you have been given. 19 so much of what you have been told about 20 mr. piendle is based upon the memories that his 21 friends and family have, and those memories 22 date back some 50 years or more, and you are 23 being asked, in large part, to base some of 24 your decisions in this case on memories that go 25 back 50 years. well, memories fade over time. 1 gaps in recollection grow over time. 2 you may think back just in this case, it is 3 just over a month ago when voir dire took 4 place, upstairs in the big courtroom, and some 5 of the things that were said to you about this 6 case then, if you stop and think about it, may 7 not be that clear right now, may have started 8 to fade. things that were said in opening 9 statement, mr. barnhart's representation that 10 mr. piendle started smoking and continued 11 smoking because he was weak until he finally 12 became strong in 1989. some of you may 13 remember that and others may have to search 14 your notes, and that is just 30 days ago. 15 well, imagine, then, the difficulty of 16 remembering things that happened not 30 days 17 ago, but 30 years ago, and to be precise about 18 things that happened 50 years ago. so as you 19 consider the evidence of things that happened a 20 long time ago, not just with respect to 21 mr. piendle, but with respect to many of these 22 documents and events that happened in the '50s 23 and '60s that you have seen, authored by 24 witnesses who are long since dead or left the 25 company, that attempting to figure out not only 1 what happened a long time ago, but why it 2 happened a long time ago is a very hard thing 3 to do. and so you are going to have to figure 4 out when you go into the jury room how much 5 weight on the scales of justice distant 6 memories are going to have. 7 let me give you just one example from one 8 of the first witnesses in the case, mr. cabral, 9 babe cabral. you may remember that some 40 or 10 50 years ago, he remembered a marlboro cowboy 11 ad in his neighborhood. now, there is no doubt 12 that at some time there probably was a marlboro 13 cowboy ad in his neighborhood. there is also no 14 doubt that the marlboro cowboy and marlboro 15 country campaign did not start until 1962. 16 1962, charlie piendle was 21 years old, he was 17 in the marines. 18 now, it could be that mr. cabral was 19 remembering some other ad involving a man and a 20 marlboro, that is all possible, but i do 21 remember one of the questions he was asked was, 22 is not it hard to remember back then? and you 23 may remember that he sighed and said, yeah, 24 it is a long time ago, and requiring mr. cabral 25 to remember whether it was 52 years ago or 58 1 years ago or 56 years ago, i think is asking 2 too much of anybody's memory, trying to go back 3 into their childhood, especially when most of 4 those witnesses would not have thought anything 5 about charlie piendle's smoking until a couple 6 of years ago when this lawsuit was brought. 7 nobody followed charlie piendle around 8 with a notepad, making notes of his awareness 9 and knowledge and beliefs about smoking, making 10 notes about his interest in smoking, why he 11 smoked, why he quit, why he did not quit. 12 nobody's following him around and making notes 13 about what actually he believed or said at the 14 time. there is a lot of memories that you are 15 being asked to rely upon from times gone by. 16 okay. let me address the substance of the 17 claims against philip morris, and what i'd like 18 you to do as i move through the substance of 19 the claims against philip morris is to 20 remember, and bear this in mind, that if philip 21 morris did not exist, if philip morris had 22 never existed, and there never were any 23 cigarettes with the brand names of marlboro or 24 merit or virginia slims, the overwhelming 25 weight of the evidence is that mr. piendle 1 would have smoked other available cigarettes, 2 if philip morris brands never existed. 3 remember that when he started smoking, 4 charlie's father rolled his own cigarettes when 5 he was not smoking nonfiltered, charlie's mother 6 smoked menthols, his friends, including his 7 closest friends also smoked, but none of them 8 smoked marlboros. 9 there is some testimony that he may have 10 smoked marlboros on occasion in high school, 11 but there is no testimony that if marlboro were 12 not available, then he would have quit smoking 13 rather than smoke another available brand. 14 if philip morris, in december of 1953, 15 when they came out of the plaza motel, decided 16 to shut the company down, fire all the 17 employees, cancel all the contracts with the 18 farmers and the wholesalers and the truckers 19 and let all the employees go, is there any 20 evidence, from what you know about charlie 21 piendle, what you have been told about charlie 22 piendle by the plaintiffs, that would lead you 23 to believe he would never have started smoking 24 or would have stopped? 25 now, all the testimony from the plaintiffs 1 is exactly the opposite. there is no evidence 2 in the record that philip morris' marketing 3 targeted young charlie piendle. the only 4 evidence of any male ad is from 1956 or 1957 5 where there is the really angry smoker in the 6 ad, and there is no indication that charlie 7 piendle ever saw that. 8 you will recall that that was at the time 9 when marlboro was transitioning from a lady's 10 brand to a man's brand, and still six years 11 before marlboro country came into being and the 12 marlboro cowboy rode across the west in 13 marlboro country. 14 you were shown the julie london tv 15 commercial. now, julie london -- and you 16 were not told when it was run, except it was run 17 in the '50s, whether that was for the ladies or 18 the men, i do not know, i certainly liked the 19 ad, and in the 1950s, i'm sure my dad liked the 20 ad, but i do not believe any adolescent liked 21 the ad. 22 and, will, can we have the first slide? 23 and you do not have to take my word for it, 24 this is the plaintiff's expert, dr. cummings. 25 "it is your opinion that the julie london ad 1 singing the marlboro song in the darkened bar 2 in the 1950s was an attempt to appeal to 3 underage smokers?" 4 answer: "i would not say that, no." 5 did mr. piendle's family even have a 6 television in the 1950s? this is his brother's 7 testimony, remember his brother is 11 years 8 younger. so in the '50s, this is what he 9 recalled, "we did not have television. the only 10 thing on the radio were those shows our parents 11 listened to, except once in a while, i listened 12 to floyd patterson fights with my father." 13 those were the only ads you were shown 14 from philip morris before mr. piendle left for 15 the marines and pretty much disappears from the 16 evidence until about 1968. 17 the instructions you have is that the 18 defendants have a right to advertise and they 19 cannot be liable unless there is something 20 false, misleading, or deceitful in their 21 statements. there is nothing false, misleading, 22 or deceitful in any of the ads you have seen from 23 philip morris that are in the 1950s, either the 24 tattoo man or the julie london ad, and there is 25 no connection whatsoever to mr. piendle. 1 so point no. 1, there is nothing that 2 philip morris did or did not do that was a legal 3 cause of mr. piendle's beginning to smoke. if 4 philip morris is not responsible for mr. piendle 5 beginning to smoke, then where is the evidence 6 along the way of any wrongful conduct on the 7 part of philip morris that is connected to 8 mr. piendle smoking? 9 i submit that there is a complete absence 10 of any evidence connecting philip morris and 11 mr. piendle in any wrongful conduct on the part 12 of philip morris. 13 let us review mr. piendle's smoking history 14 with respect -- specifically to philip morris. 15 his friend, babe cabral. they did not smoke 16 marlboro when growing up. he thinks 17 mr. piendle smoked marlboro in the '70s. 18 his brother remembers seeing mr. piendle 19 with marlboro during visits once or twice a 20 year in the '70s. 21 his daughter, who was born in 1970, 22 remembered the marlboro when living in 23 connecticut in the '70s, of course, she would 24 have been less than 10. so she deferred to her 25 mother, admits her mother would have a better 1 recollection of the brands mr. piendle smoked. 2 his sister, christy, seems to recall a red 3 pack that could have been marlboro or another, 4 sometime in high school, and his best friend 5 with whom he smoked in high school has no 6 memory of marlboro. 7 and then his wife, mrs. piendle. when she 8 met mr. piendle in 1968, he was smoking 9 marlboro. within the year, he switched to her 10 brand. throughout their married life, 11 mrs. piendle bought the cigarettes they smoked. 12 so from 1969 on, mrs. piendle bought the 13 cigarettes. she never bought marlboro. 14 there is testimony that mrs. piendle bought 15 merit in 1985 to 1989, and i'm going to talk 16 about that separately in a minute. there is 17 testimony that mrs. piendle bought virginia 18 slims and mr. piendle had a virginia slim from 19 time to time, but when and how much is nowhere 20 to be found in the record. 21 one thing that is certain is that from 22 1968 on, when mrs. piendle can, for the first 23 time, identify marlboro smoking for that year, 24 there would have been warnings on the packs of 25 marlboros he smoked, just like on every pack of 1 cigarette after 1966. 2 counsel, on opening of the closing, 3 mr. barnhart, mentioned brand loyalty, made a 4 big point about brand loyalty. i think it is an 5 important point too, because in one respect, 6 mr. piendle is very unique. in many respects 7 he is unique, but as a smoker, he is unique in 8 this respect. he apparently had no brand 9 loyalty whatsoever. there is not any history 10 that he has, over his 30 years, where he has 11 latched onto a particular brand of cigarette 12 and smokes that cigarette exclusively. among 13 the brands that he smoked were camel, lucky 14 strikes, pall mall, winston, marlboro, carlton, 15 salem, raleigh, doral, merit, virginia slims, 16 tareyton, viceroy, and capri. 17 so the suggestion that he had a connection 18 to a particular brand because of advertising or 19 marketing of that brand is not supported in 20 this evidence that the plaintiffs presented to 21 you. he did not smoke certainly any of the 22 philip morris brands with any regularity. it 23 did not appear that he smoked any brands with 24 any regularity or loyalty over the course of 25 his smoking history. 1 so let us go back to the 1950s. and assume 2 that mr. piendle walks into the corner store in 3 connecticut when he is 16 and legal age, and he 4 can buy cigarettes at 16 in connecticut back 5 then, and he goes up to the counter and he asks 6 the clerk if he can have a pack of marlboro, 7 and the clerk says, i'm sorry, sir, i do not 8 know what you are talking about, philip morris 9 does not exist. 10 if philip morris did not exist in the '50s, 11 would mr. piendle, based upon what you know 12 about mr. piendle from the evidence the 13 plaintiff's gave you, say, thank you very much, 14 i'm going to quit smoking, or would he say, i 15 think i'll take another brand? 16 in the '60s, in the '70s, in the '80s, 17 throughout his entire smoking history, on those 18 occasions when he would have a marlboro, and 19 there were occasions when people saw him 20 smoking marlboro, if marlboro were not there, 21 would he have quit smoking or would he have 22 smoked another available brand of cigarettes? 23 if he had never smoked marlboro and just 24 smoked other brands, is there any evidence in 25 the record that those other brands would have 1 been somewhat safer somehow? was there 2 anything unique or unusual about marlboro that 3 made marlboros somehow more dangerous or less 4 safe than other brands? 5 well, here's what the plaintiffs told you 6 on that point. are all commercial cigarettes 7 equally dangerous? dr. burns, yes; 8 dr. benowitz, yes; and dr. cummings yes. 9 if he had never smoked marlboros, if 10 marlboros never existed and he chose other 11 available cigarettes, would those other 12 cigarettes have been less addicting than 13 marlboros, or did marlboro have some special or 14 unique feature that made marlboros somehow more 15 addicting than other brands? 16 again, the plaintiffs provided you with 17 this information. are all commercial 18 cigarettes equally addictive? dr. burns, yes; 19 dr. benowitz, yes; and dr. cummings, yes. 20 from my demonstratives, probably too much 21 of an eye test for you to see, but i have got 22 the trial transcript citations down at the 23 bottom. 24 the point that i'm making is a point that 25 all the lawyers you heard from so far have 1 made, and that is, how do you apply the concept 2 of legal cause to the evidence that you have been 3 provided? legal cause is what defines legal 4 responsibility in this case. legal cause is 5 that principle of law by which some wrongful 6 conduct or some product that may have caused 7 harm is connected to legal responsibility to 8 pay for that harm. 9 and it is defined very specifically in the 10 instructions, and i think we remember 30 days 11 ago, we may have had a discussion about the 12 need to understand the definitions, whether 13 it is a definition of addiction or now a 14 definition of legal cause before you try and 15 reach a conclusion about whether legal cause 16 exists. 17 so legal cause has a portion of the 18 instruction that repeats itself throughout the 19 instructions. so in this blank spot you might 20 see addiction or negligence, for example, and 21 then the definition of legal cause. 22 so let us say negligence is a legal cause 23 of loss, injury, or damage if it directly and 24 in natural and continuous sequence produces or 25 contributes substantially to producing such 1 loss, injury, or damage such that it can 2 reasonably be said that but for the negligence, 3 the loss, injury, or damage would not have 4 occurred. that is a mouthful, and it might take 5 a while to understand it, so i've broken it 6 down a little bit. 7 a is a legal cause of b if it directly and 8 in natural and continuous sequence produces or 9 contributes substantially to producing b, such 10 that it can reasonably be said that but for a, 11 b would not have occurred. 12 all right. we are getting maybe a little 13 bit more simplified. but for cause in the 14 chain of causation, a is in the chain of 15 causation leading to b. the question for legal 16 cause is, if a goes away, does b go away? if a 17 goes away and b goes away, then a was a but-for 18 cause of b. if a goes away and b does not go 19 away, then a is not a but-for cause of b. 20 let me give you an example. i've got to 21 be at work at 9:00 o'clock in the morning, so i 22 get up and i shower and i have breakfast and i 23 read the paper and i go to the train station 24 and i get on the train on the marlboro car, and 25 i ride to work and i get to work at 8:30, half 1 an hour early. 2 the question is, is getting on the 3 marlboro car a legal cause of my getting to 4 work early? well, the answer to that question, 5 you take a away and see what happens. well, i 6 got up, showered, breakfast, paper, went to the 7 train station, did not get on the marlboro car, 8 got on the other cigarette car on the train, 9 arrives at the train station the same time, i 10 arrive at work at exactly the same time. 11 so if there is another cigarette car 12 available for me to take on that train, the 13 fact that i took the marlboro car is not a 14 but-for cause of my getting to work at 8:30. 15 all right. let us bring it back to this 16 case. mr. piendle got on the cigarette train 17 in the 1950s, and from time to time got on -- 18 got on or got in the marlboro car on that 19 train. he did not stay in there very long. he 20 got in a lot of other cigarette cars on that 21 train over the course of his 30-year history. 22 is getting on that marlboro car or getting 23 in that marlboro car on the occasions he did a 24 but-for cause of his getting lung cancer, or if 25 marlboro did not exist, if marlboro and philip 1 morris never existed, would b still have 2 happened, would he still have smoked, would he 3 just have chosen other cigarettes, or would he 4 have quit because he could not get marlboro? 5 all the evidence you have in the case 6 suggests that he would have selected one of the 7 many other brands he was wanting to smoke. 8 there is no indication that if philip morris 9 brands were not there, he would have stopped 10 smoking. 11 marlboro cigarettes are not a legal cause 12 of mr. piendle's death because they can be 13 removed from the chain of causation, and the 14 result would not change at all. legal cause 15 requires but-for causation, and the evidence 16 just will not support the conclusion that but for 17 smoking marlboros, mr. piendle would have been 18 just fine. 19 did any of the plaintiff's experts, 20 dr. burns, dr. cummings or dr. benowitz, 21 testify that smoking marlboro on the occasions 22 he did was a substantial contributing factor 23 and a but-for legal cause of mr. piendle's lung 24 cancer? 25 check your notes for those three 1 witnesses, but i'll tell you what i think 2 you are going to find, they did not. 3 mrs. piendle's witnesses never attempted 4 to tie the marlboro smoking as a legal cause of 5 mr. piendle's lung cancer. in fact, the only 6 witness who was asked a question that was 7 somewhat similar was dr. benowitz, and i asked 8 dr. benowitz this question. 9 "all right. now, in 1964, if philip 10 morris and reynolds had removed from the market 11 all of their cigarette products, were there 12 other cigarette products remaining?" 13 answer: "yes." 14 question: "were those cigarette products 15 that remained in the absence of philip morris 16 and reynolds products addicting?" 17 "yes." 18 "just as addicting as philip morris and 19 reynolds products in your view?" 20 answer: "yes." 21 and i told you i was going to talk to you 22 very briefly about merit. whether or not merit 23 is a legal cause is also dependent upon not 24 anything the defendants said, but what 25 dr. burns said. you will remember dr. burns 1 said that the lung cancer was caused by a 2 long-term exposure to cigarette smoking, and 3 that to have avoided getting lung cancer, 4 mr. piendle would have had to have stopped 5 smoking in 1974. 6 by 1985, by 1985, when -- i'm sorry, 1984, 7 when mrs. piendle bought merits for the two of 8 them, dr. burns indicated that mr. piendle had 9 gone beyond the point of no return for his lung 10 cancer. 11 and so when you look at the chain of 12 causation and you see the merits way down the 13 end of the chain of causation, toward the end 14 of the 30 years, dr. burns' testimony indicates 15 that if you take out all of the merit smoking 16 from '84 on, mr. piendle's lung cancer still 17 occurs, and that is the information provided by 18 the plaintiffs that you put into the legal 19 cause standard to try and assess whether the 20 smoking of philip morris products are a legal 21 cause of mr. piendle's lung cancer. 22 there is also some testimony about virginia 23 slims, but there is not any evidence of how much 24 or when sufficient to allow you to determine 25 whether it is a legal cause of the lung cancer, 1 where it fits into the chain of causation at 2 all. 3 and that is the plaintiff's burden to 4 establish, legal cause is the plaintiff's 5 burden to establish. none of what i've talked 6 about so far does the defendants have any 7 burden to establish. these are all elements 8 the plaintiff has to establish. 9 all right. new topic. plaintiffs made 10 claims about philip morris and the claim that 11 philip morris concealed information from the 12 public health community. and i'm going to 13 start this discussion, if i could, with one of 14 the jurors' questions to dr. cummings after he 15 finished his entire day and a half or so of 16 testimony. "what responsibility do you believe 17 the public health community or u.s. government 18 agencies have to smokers of the '50s and '60's, 19 and if so, what?" 20 and dr. cummings said, well, their 21 responsibility was to support research, the 22 smoking, and basically put out information that 23 they had based on that research and regulate 24 the -- based on the findings from that 25 research, as was made public to them as to the 1 actions that would affect the public health's 2 health. and then he said the job of the 3 government is to protect the government's 4 health. 5 when you go through the evidence, please 6 remember that the public health community 7 consists of a lot of different people and 8 organizations, and over time it is not 9 particularly clear that all those 10 organizations, all those members of the public 11 health community agreed with each other about 12 what was the best way to protect the public's 13 health. and certainly what they think today is 14 different than what they thought back in the 15 '50s, '60s and '70s. 16 so when you talk about -- when you assess 17 and talk together about assessing the philip 18 morris conduct with respect to the public 19 health organizations, please remember what the 20 public health organizations were saying at the 21 time the conduct was going on and not at a 22 later time. 23 here's some examples. with respect to 24 denicotinized products, dr. cummings supports 25 it, the council for tobacco-free kids called it 1 the most dangerous product on the market, and 2 the tobacco working group thought rather than 3 denicotinizing cigarettes, the nicotine should 4 be increased. you may remember that from the 5 nci tobacco working group testimony. 6 should cigarettes be banned? dr. cummings 7 says sure, and the companies should be driven 8 out of business, but the surgeon general and 9 dr. burns recognize that society accepts 10 smoking as a legal adult personal health 11 choice. 12 this may have surprised some of you. with 13 respect to whether smoking causes an increase 14 in lung cancer risks for women, dr. cummings 15 says the health risks were established by 1958. 16 dr. burns, check your notes, says there was 17 confusion up until the surgeon general's report 18 in 1980. two members of the public health 19 community coming up with completely different 20 opinions. 21 back to the '50s. dr. burns agreed that 22 the public health community in the '50s was 23 promoting the development and marketing of 24 low-tar and nicotine cigarettes. dr. wynder 25 had recommended that -- in 1957, that in the 1 '60s, tar and nicotine levels should be reduced 2 by forty percent. 3 and you saw that indeed they were. and 4 that was what was supposed to be done back in 5 the '50s and '60s, that is what the companies 6 did in response to the public health 7 community's urging them to do so to protect the 8 public health. 9 then plaintiff claimed that philip morris 10 concealed from the public health community the 11 fact that people who switched to a lower tar 12 and nicotine cigarette may smoke differently or 13 smoke more cigarettes. please remember, the 14 1979 surgeon general's report in which the 15 surgeon general noted that the preponderance of 16 the scientific evidence continues, as in 1966, 17 to suggest that cigarettes with lower tar and 18 nicotine are less hazardous. it has become 19 clear in the years since, however, that in 20 presenting this information to the public, they 21 should be warned that in shifting to a less 22 hazardous cigarette, they may, in fact, 23 increase their hazard if they begin smoking 24 more cigarettes or inhaling more deeply. 25 so the surgeon general of the public 7063 1 health community was not uninformed about this 2 issue in 1979 or in 1966. in 1981, the point 3 was reinforced once again. 4 the plaintiff claims that philip morris 5 knew and concealed from the public health 6 community the fact that the smoking machines 7 that measured the tar and nicotine yields do not 8 smoke like people smoke. philip morris knew 9 that, but did not tell the public health 10 community. 11 here is a letter to the ftc concerning 12 smoking machines in which the government is 13 informed, the ogg method, one of the methods 14 for measuring tar and nicotine, does not and 15 cannot measure these many variations in human 16 smoking habits. it does not measure 17 particulate matter or nicotine in the smoke 18 generated while the cigarette is not being 19 puffed. it does not measure all the 20 particulate matter or nicotine in any 21 cigarette, but only that in the smoke drawn in 22 the standardized machine smoking according to 23 the prescribed method. these basic 24 standardizations are well-understood by all 25 technologists in talking about any testing 1 method. and philip morris is one of the 2 signatories on that letter. 3 we talked a little bit about the national 4 cancer institute's tobacco working group, 1968 5 to 1978, which recommended design changes for a 6 less hazardous cigarette, including 7 reconstituted tobacco, expanded tobacco, porous 8 paper, ventilation on the filter, improved 9 filters, all of which were incorporated in 10 philip morris brands through the '60s, the 11 '70s, and '80s, and throughout that time period 12 and into the '80s -- throughout the '80s, the 13 tar and nicotine levels were driven downward 14 for the products that were made available. 15 the clerk: counselor, 20 minutes. 16 mr. kelly: i'm sorry? 20, thank you. 17 and there is no design improvement that has 18 been identified by any of the witnesses, 19 dr. burns, dr. cummings, dr. benowitz, that was 20 not incorporated into a product by philip 21 morris. 22 we will talk a little bit about the 23 denicotinized cigarettes that philip morris 24 designed, manufactured, marketed. 25 dr. benowitz, dr. cummings talked a lot about 1 it. put them on the market, nobody smoked 2 them. they went into storage for years. 3 dr. benowitz needed some low-nicotine 4 cigarettes for his research, asked philip 5 morris for them, and they provided them to him, 6 no strings attached. 7 that is -- i do not think that can be 8 characterized as not cooperating with the 9 public health community, especially somebody 10 like dr. benowitz, a noted researcher in the 11 field of nicotine research. 12 let me talk a little bit about some of the 13 documents you have been shown. this is a 1961 14 dr. wakeham document that had the carcinogens 15 listed that had been reported in literature. 16 you were told that philip morris did not 17 provide the surgeon general's committee with a 18 list of carcinogens that were contained in this 19 document. that is why we had dr. farone's 20 videotape testimony provided to you in our 21 case, to establish that, yes, indeed, a list of 22 carcinogens consisting of almost 99 percent of 23 all the carcinogens they were aware of, or that 24 were known, was provided to the surgeon 25 general's committee by philip morris. 1 there is a claim that philip morris 2 concealed information about nicotine, and i'm 3 going to go through this very quickly, without 4 speaking too fast, i hope, but in summary form. 5 in 1972 -- actually, in 1969, document in 6 evidence, philip morris' research chief asked 7 the board of directors for funding to do 8 scientific research into why people smoke. 9 by 1972, the seminar in the caribbean 10 organized by the tobacco industry inviting 11 all -- inviting independent scientists and 12 researchers, many of whom wrote with 13 dr. benowitz on future papers, attended the 14 seminar in 1972. the papers presented there 15 were compiled in a book edited by dr. dunn of 16 philip morris, and which were the subject of 17 his speech in october of '72 and his newspaper 18 interview in october of '72 containing the 19 latest research on nicotine and its effect not 20 only on the biology, but the psychology of 21 smokers. articles in there that dr. benowitz 22 found helpful when he began his research in 23 1975. 24 the reason i bring that up is that this is 25 the absolute opposite of concealment, going to 1 a seminar, publishing a book, giving a speech, 2 and giving interviews. 3 plaintiffs have the burden to prove that 4 mr. piendle relied on some statement from 5 philip morris that was somehow concealed and 6 would have made a difference if it had been 7 removed from the chain of causation. 8 mr. barnhart admitted in his closing, we 9 cannot prove that mr. piendle relied on any 10 particular statement. 11 well, if that is the case, and i think that 12 is the case, then he cannot meet mrs. piendle's 13 burden of proof to establish that mr. piendle 14 relied on a statement containing information 15 that had been concealed. i mean, we got that 16 admission in -- it came directly from 17 mr. barnhart, i do not dispute it, there is no 18 evidence that mr. piendle relied on anything 19 that philip morris said throughout his smoking 20 history, certainly not when he began, nothing 21 in 1968, and after that, there is not even any 22 indication that he was smoking philip morris 23 products on a regular basis. 24 a word on the punitive damages claim. the 25 plaintiffs have to establish by clear and 1 convincing evidence. and i was listening to 2 her honor as she read the instruction, and it 3 is a very powerful and significant instruction 4 when clear and convincing is defined. it is 5 evidence that is precise, explicit, lacking in 6 confusion, and of such weight that it produces 7 a firm belief or conviction without hesitation, 8 without hesitation. 9 the evidence that the plaintiffs were 10 going to show you to convince you that philip 11 morris had some liability in this case was 12 based upon the testimony from a dr. farone that 13 mr. barnhart -- who mr. barnhart identified in 14 his opening statement. dr. farone was a former 15 executive with the company who was going to 16 come in and testify in the plaintiff's case by 17 videotape of the various alleged misdeeds the 18 plaintiffs would be relying upon to prove 19 punitive damages and liability in this case. 20 dr. farone never testified in the 21 plaintiff's case. when we brought him in our 22 case -- 23 mr. scarola: excuse me, your honor, i'm 24 sorry. it is entirely improper for counsel to 25 say what our intention was in calling 1 dr. farone. there simply is no evidence of 2 that, and we did not need to call dr. farone 3 because the defense called them. 4 mr. kelly: that is -- 5 mr. scarola: i would ask the court to 6 instruct the jury to disregard those comments. 7 the court: i'll sustain the objection as 8 far as suggesting an intention on plaintiff's 9 part. 10 mr. kelly: let me restate it then. 11 in plaintiff's opening statement, you were 12 introduced to dr. farone, an executive from 13 philip morris, who was to be called in the 14 plaintiff's case, according to plaintiff's 15 opening statement. he was not called in 16 plaintiff's case, he was called in the defense 17 case to proven an allegation -- to disprove an 18 allegation the plaintiffs made about submitting 19 information to the surgeon general. 20 he did not provide any detail about his 21 time at philip morris with respect to the 22 individuals he worked with, the documents he 23 was involved with, the programs he was involved 24 with, philip morris' intentions or activities 25 with respect to the cigarettes that he worked 1 on, nothing, absolutely nothing. 2 all you are left with with respect to 3 philip morris are documents from which snippets 4 of catchy phrases have been taken and put on 5 the scales. you look at those scales that 6 mr. barnhart made use of in his opening, and 7 i'd like you to do this. if plaintiff wants to 8 put all the little snippets and the catchy 9 phrases from those documents on their side of 10 the scale, then i think you ought to put in the 11 entire document, the rest of the story, the 12 document that puts those little snippets into 13 context on the other side, and you would see 14 that the full documentation completely 15 outweighs the little snippets. 16 when all is said and done with respect to 17 whatever philip morris cigarettes you find that 18 mr. piendle may have smoked, the basic claim is 19 that philip morris manufactured and sold them 20 and mr. piendle smoked them. the law is the 21 manufacture and sale of cigarettes is a lawful 22 activity; therefore, her honor instructs you 23 that the defendants cannot be held liable 24 merely for manufacturing, selling, or 25 advertising cigarettes. 1 gina, about how much time do i have? 2 the clerk: ten minutes. 3 mr. kelly: all right. perfect. thank 4 you. 5 now, i'm sure in the rebuttal closing that 6 the plaintiff has, that they will spend a lot of 7 time on the punitive damages aspect of the case 8 and not very much time on the compensatory 9 claim of mrs. piendle. the compensatory claim 10 of mrs. piendle does not have a lot of evidence 11 that the plaintiffs put in that they can spend 12 much time talking with you about. it is the 13 compensatory claim by mrs. piendle for the loss 14 of her husband's companionship and the pain and 15 suffering that accompanies that loss, that is 16 the basis of the money claim in this case by 17 mrs. piendle. 18 now, you are not going to get to this issue 19 if you find that the legal cause hurdles have 20 not been overcome. but let me talk a little 21 bit about the claim for compensatory damages. 22 plaintiff has the burden of proof on this issue 23 as well. this is -- this is kind of a unique 24 issue for the plaintiff, because unlike the 25 other claims in the case where you can -- you 1 can call in documents from a website, for 2 example, for this particular claim of 3 mrs. piendle's loss of companionship, 4 mrs. piendle and her family have pretty much 5 all the evidence that is available. 6 what is happened over the last 14 years, 7 14 years of holidays and birthdays and 8 vacations, family gatherings, the defendants 9 do not have any of that information. 10 mrs. piendle has all that information. her 11 family has that information. her daughter has 12 that information. 13 so this is an issue in which the 14 plaintiffs have the burden of proof and all the 15 evidence. you have to ask yourself whether 16 when you were presented with the plaintiff's 17 case on this issue, you were shown all the 18 pieces of the puzzle that makes up 19 mrs. piendle's life over the last 14 years. 20 when the plaintiffs were done with their 21 case, did you know really anything at all about 22 mrs. piendle's life over the last 14 years, or 23 did you have to wait for the defendants to try 24 and put before you evidence that is of a very 25 difficult nature to inquire about, it is a very 1 personal area for mrs. piendle, but -- but it is 2 the claim that is being made that requires the 3 evidence. 4 mrs. piendle is making a claim, the 5 defendants are not, but the defendants have an 6 obligation to bring the evidence before you if 7 we can, hopefully in a respectful, dignified 8 way. i hope that is the case. i hope that is 9 how you took it. but the burden of proof is on 10 mrs. piendle. 11 one of the jurors asked the question at 12 the conclusion of her testimony: "how has your 13 lifestyle been affected by charlie's death?" 14 and mrs. piendle answered: "i have -- i 15 do not have any best friend anymore." 16 i'm sorry to repeat this, ms. piendle. 17 "my daughter used to call us yin and yang. 18 i do not have -- i do not have any more of my 19 yang anymore. it is very lonely. i do not know 20 how else to explain. it is not same." 21 i do not believe there is any doubt that 22 that is all true, just as i -- i do not think 23 there is any doubt that all this is true as 24 well. and this comes from the family and it -- 25 it starts -- it is more piece of the puzzle, if 1 you will, that the family had available to 2 bring to you that we obtained and provided, 3 things like when mrs. piendle began dating, her 4 four-year relationship with mr. rodriguez, and 5 the testimony from her daughter is that they 6 lived together. that is what her daughter said. 7 we presented that to you. 8 her engagement to mr. medina, the end of 9 the engagement, her continuing friendship with 10 mr. rodriguez. i'm not suggesting that this is 11 the complete picture of the -- of the puzzle 12 over the last 14 years, but it is what we have 13 available to provide you for your 14 consideration. 15 so when you consider, if you get to this 16 point in your deliberations of how to value the 17 loss of companionship, i think if you take what 18 mrs. piendle provided and you take what 19 mrs. piendle and her family provided over the 20 last 14 years, i think it is reasonable to 21 conclude that, respectfully, the loss of 22 companionship and the loss from the loss of 23 companionship, the pain and suffering from that 24 loss is greater initially, and then begins to 25 diminish over time as other aspects of her life 1 begin to partially fill that void, and that we 2 see over time that actually occurring. 3 so the figures that mr. biersteker 4 provided you, i think, are consistent with the 5 evidence provided over time, certainly over the 6 last 14 years. there is no precision to the 7 numbers he provided, but the sense and the 8 logic of those numbers is consistent with what 9 the evidence is. 10 and so i would suggest to you that 11 following that method, more damages would be 12 allocated soon after, in 1996 and 1997, but as 13 relationships begin to grow, the amount is 14 lessened. 15 now, whether it is a million or a million 16 and a half over all of this time, i could not be 17 that precise. but those numbers reflect the 18 reality that we have been provided in this case, 19 the evidence concerning what is been 20 mrs. piendle's life from 1996 up to the present 21 time. 22 let me talk just a little bit about 23 apportionment. 24 the clerk: counsel, two minutes. 25 mr. kelly: thank you very much. 1 as dr. benowitz said, addiction is all 2 about the loss of control, and the loss of 3 control can only be assessed when someone 4 attempts to exert control. the only time 5 mr. piendle actually exerted control, as he is 6 capable of doing, was in 1989. and when you 7 look at the consequence of his exerting control 8 and the lack of any physical withdrawal 9 symptoms, the lack of any relapse over the 10 balance of his life, the extent to which he was 11 in control becomes apparent, and there is no 12 explanation from the plaintiffs as to why he 13 could not have exercised that control before 14 1989, 1988, 1987, except that he did not want 15 to. 16 mr. piendle, in his late '40s started 17 riding motorcycles, started going to the gym, 18 started changing his life. one of the things 19 he did was quit smoking because he wanted to. 20 that is the kind of person he was. nothing the 21 defendants did and nothing philip morris did 22 prevented him from quitting anytime sooner. it 23 was his responsibility. 24 counsel admits a partial responsibility. 25 i think if you asked charlie piendle who is 1 responsible for your smoking, and who is 2 responsible for your quitting, charlie piendle 3 would say, i am. i'm a hundred percent 4 responsible. who else? 5 now, plaintiffs have the burden of proof 6 in this case, so plaintiffs get one more 7 opportunity to try and convince you on all the 8 issues that they are required to convince you on 9 under the burden of proof. 10 one thing i want you to remember is that 11 no matter how impassioned or emotional or loud 12 closing argument becomes, that you as jurors 13 must remain detached, unemotional, objective. 14 the lady justice is blind. she is blind to 15 emotion and she is blind to passion. she is also 16 deaf to volume, but she hears the value that is 17 in there. 18 so please bear that in mind as you hear 19 the rebuttal argument. we do not get a chance 20 to rebut the rebuttal, as hard as that will be, 21 but we do have the evidence you have seen, the 22 evidence you have received. we have the law that 23 her honor has given you. we have your 24 unemotional, fair, objective assessment that 25 you will begin tomorrow morning, next door, and 1 that is enough for us. 2 so i thank you very much this afternoon 3 for your attention and your patience and your 4 attention and patience over the last month 5 we have been together. thank you very much. 6 thank you, your honor.
