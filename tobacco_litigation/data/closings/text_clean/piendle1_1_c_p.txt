22 closing argument 10 mr. barnhart: good morning, ladies and 11 gentlemen of the jury, counsel. 12 first let me say thank you, on behalf of 13 mrs. piendle, on behalf of myself, on behalf of 14 jack scarola, on behalf of sia baker-barnes, on 15 behalf of mr. sales. i'm sure i speak for 16 defense counsel too. 17 this is a large, big, important case, and 18 there is no way in closing argument we can cover 19 everything that is happened, and we do not intend 20 to. but we have watched you, and each and every 21 one of you has paid close attention, taken good 22 notes, and thank goodness we can rely upon 23 that. 24 now, one thing. this is closing argument. 25 it is going to be more adversarial, and anything 1 i say or anything that jack scarola says or 2 anything that sia baker-barnes says, it is not 3 intended as a slight against defense counsel. 4 they are excellent lawyers and they have done a 5 fine job for their clients. but closing 6 argument is a time to determine and separate 7 truth from falsity, sense from nonsense, lies 8 from deceit, illusion from reality. 9 now, if you will remember, about a month 10 ago, i came in front of you in the courtroom 11 right next door, and i told you that we were 12 here for the death of a fine man, and that you 13 would hear no evidence other than that. and we 14 are indeed here for the death of a fine man, 15 and you have heard no evidence other than that. 16 now, you sit as a jury and you have watched 17 us and you have seen objections and you have seen 18 arguments and so on, but the decision is yours. 19 and so you sit collectively as the 20 representatives of the state of florida, of the 21 united states of america, and you have immense 22 power. when you go back in there tomorrow, in 23 that jury room, you have the immense power to 24 right a wrong, to do what people have been 25 doing in england and in the united states for 1 1200 years. you have the power to do what is 2 right. 3 now, folks, i want to tell you that how -- 4 i want to talk about the way in which you do 5 this. the way you do this is you follow the 6 law. and so let us start from the beginning. 7 when we started this case, we told you that 8 this was an engle progeny case; in other words, 9 it comes from an engle class action, and this 10 case did not start yesterday. this case started 11 in the 1950s, really when all the actions were 12 done, and we are going to go through that. 13 it goes to court in the -- the lawsuit is 14 filed in 1994, it goes to court in 1999, and 15 the florida supreme court makes its decision, 16 and we are really at the end of 2006, early 17 2007. and then people were given the 18 opportunity to file a lawsuit within that next 19 year if they believed they fell within that 20 class, and that is when this lawsuit was filed 21 on behalf of charlie piendle. 22 and in the very first paper that was filed 23 in this case, when we walked down to this 24 courthouse, we admitted, on behalf of charlie 25 piendle, that he himself shared fault, that he 1 himself beared responsibility for what he did, 2 but that is not the end of the story, because 3 tobacco denies any fault, not a smidgen, not an 4 iota, not an iota, not a sliver of fault, and 5 that is why we are here. 6 all right. so we heard the judge, and 7 let us talk a little bit about what the law is 8 as you approach your job. the first and 9 primary issue, was addiction to cigarettes 10 manufactured by r.j. reynolds and philip morris 11 a legal cause of charlie piendle's death? a 12 legal cause. and we will explain that. let us go 13 to the concurring cause. 14 all right. so here are the instructions 15 that you saw, you have them with you, but i 16 want to work through them because it gives you 17 an easy way to weigh the evidence, to follow 18 the evidence, and see what goes on. 19 addiction to cigarettes containing 20 nicotine is a legal cause of death if it 21 directly and in natural and continuous sequence 22 produces or contributes substantially, it 23 does not have to be the only cause, but 24 contributes substantially to producing the 25 death, so that it can be said that but for the 1 addiction -- but for the addiction to 2 cigarettes containing nicotine, the death would 3 not have occurred. 4 all right. and to be regarded as a legal 5 cause of death, addiction need not be the only 6 cause, and we know it is not, because the 7 actions of charlie piendle were part of the 8 cause and the actions of tobacco were part of 9 the cause. 10 addiction may be a legal cause of death, 11 even though it operates in combination with the 12 act of another, charlie piendle, r.j. reynolds, 13 philip morris, some natural cause or some other 14 cause if the addiction contributes 15 substantially to charlie's death. 16 okay. so what is the addiction? it is 17 combined with charlie's actions, with tobacco's 18 actions. but to put this case in context, if 19 we weigh it into what goes on in 2010, we are 20 not doing justice. because what happens is 21 charlie piendle started smoking, when, in the 22 1950s. he was born in 1941, and it was a 23 different time, a different time. 24 remember in opening statement when i 25 pulled out a cigarette, it was shocking, it was 1 jarring, but that was the milieu, that was the 2 time in which charlie grew up, when everybody 3 was smoking, when we had -- people smoked in 4 the hospitals, people smoked on airplanes, 5 people smoked at the doctor's office, doctors 6 smoked, people smoked in schools, teachers and 7 principals, they smoked everywhere. we had 8 nurses, famous coaches, people in orchestras, 9 people of everyday life, priests and clergy. 10 well, we heard in this case that their priest 11 smoked cigars, that their doctor who made house 12 calls would show up smoking a cigarette, you 13 heard betty piendle say that. people smoked 14 during athletic activities. arnold palmer 15 smoking away during a tennis tournament. 16 people smoked traveling. they smoked 17 everywhere. 18 and to put this in study again, if we 19 were -- if we were back in that time, people in 20 the audience would be smoking. you would have 21 ashtrays right here. somebody would be 22 smoking. maybe i would, maybe the court would. 23 but it was a different time. 24 and so when we weigh charlie's activities, 25 when we weigh a decision he made as a kid, we 1 need to weigh it at the time when he lived, at 2 the time when he was young, at the time when 3 all of the influences around him counted the 4 most. 5 all right. so let us go back to the 1950s 6 and talk about it statistically. in the 1950s 7 nearly eighty percent of all men smoked. so 8 remember, that was the world war ii generation, 9 just above charlie. everybody had gone to war, 10 and what did they get, free cigarettes in their 11 rations, free cigarettes on their ships if 12 you are in the navy, free cigarettes on the 13 beaches if you were a marine. eighty percent of 14 the men who fought in world war ii, eighty percent 15 of all men in the united states were smokers, 16 regular smokers. 17 charlie grew up in a haze of smoke. it 18 was what happened, it was not anything unusual. 19 dad smoked, mom smoked, the kids down the 20 street smoked, the teacher smoked, the firemen 21 smoked, the police officer smoked, priests 22 smoked, doctors, nurses, everybody smoked. 23 all right. so by the time, we know from a 24 poll, we do not particularly know about 25 bridgeport, the national high school classes of 1 1958 and 1959, charlie was the class of '59, 65 2 to 68 percent of the kids were regular smokers. 3 i do not mean experimenting out behind the 4 bleachers, i mean regular smokers. regular 5 smokers. 6 all right. so going back, here is 7 charlie. so what do we know about charlie? 8 and when you evaluate the impact of the loss of 9 charlie piendle on his wife liz -- on your way 10 there. when we evaluate the loss of charlie 11 for liz, we have to go back and see what kind 12 of a man charlie was. right? 13 no one in this courtroom other than liz 14 knew charlie, but to evaluate the loss to liz, 15 we have to understand charlie, we have to get 16 to know him, we have to understand what that 17 loss meant to her. 18 well, who was charlie? well, he was a 19 good-looking kid. he was a nice kid. we saw 20 his grade card, he was not the best student, but 21 he was a good athlete. he was a popular kid. 22 he was captain of the track team. he was a 23 football -- i do not know if he was a football 24 star, but he was the starting halfback on the 25 football team. his best friend babe, we heard 1 him testify, babe was a star, and they were 2 best friends growing up. and so what was he? 3 he was different things. he was a marine, he 4 was a member of the school, and he was not stuck 5 up and he was not conceited. he was just a nice 6 guy. 7 and how do we know that? because the 8 friends he made in high school are his -- were 9 his best friends all his life, all his life. 10 remember babe who came down? the very 11 last question, one of the defense lawyers asked 12 him about why he was here, and he said, i'm 13 here for my friend. i'm here for my friend. 14 and when you have a man who inspires that 15 kind of loyalty, that kind of love, even 14 16 years after his death, that is a remarkable man, 17 and that is a terrible loss. 18 all right. so i wanted to talk -- we -- 19 you know, we talked about the time, but now 20 let us talk about the ads. and, look, the judge 21 told you there is nothing wrong with 22 advertising, and there is not. there is not. 23 you can advertise. there is nothing wrong with 24 that. but what you cannot do, what you cannot 25 do is false, misleading, deceitful advertising 1 and representations are not protected by the 2 first amendment. you know why, because they are 3 wrong. you can advertise, you can puff, so to 4 speak, but you cannot lie, and you cannot 5 mislead. 6 all right. so what are some of the 7 advertisements we have seen? lucky strikes, 8 prom, 1952. and these were everywhere. they 9 were in magazines; they were in newspapers; 10 they were on billboards. 11 and remember what babe said? right across 12 from the candy story where they got their penny 13 cigarettes, you know, kids would go in, plunk 14 down a penny, get a cigarette and a match, 15 penny cigarettes. and right across the street 16 from that was a billboard of the marlboro man. 17 and what did babe say? everybody wanted 18 to be the marlboro man. everybody wanted to be 19 there, because he was a tough ombré. he was a 20 man's man. he was an american, square-jawed, 21 tough, independent, the kind of person that 22 conquered the west. and what teenager -- or 23 what child would not want to be like that? 24 we have sports figures. john wayne. we 25 have doctor's advertising. the defense keeps 1 saying -- you know, there are warnings 2 everywhere. he had to know more than tobacco 3 as a kid. we have doctors. "more doctors 4 smoke camels than any other cigarette." how 5 did they get that? remember what dr. cummings 6 said, how did they get that poll, so to speak? 7 the doctors had a convention, and they put 8 camel cigarettes in their rooms. and then when 9 they ran out of their cigarettes, they had the 10 camels. they came down, and said, doctor, what 11 cigarette is in your pocket? that is how they 12 got them on camels. 13 they advertised 28 percent less nicotine, 14 more sports figures. we had -- is it don 15 newcombe and roy campanella? they do not mean 16 much to us now, but to charlie they did. that 17 was lebron james, that was dwayne wade, that 18 was dan marino, that was frank gifford. 19 so to put it in context, to do what is 20 right, to be fair, to understand the 21 responsibility charlie had, compared to the 22 responsibility tobacco has, we need to see the 23 information environment that he lived in. 24 remember that, and that is when -- the 25 cross-examination of their polster and the 1 cross-examination of their historian, this came 2 out. 3 so here's charlie in the 1950s and let us 4 look and see what are his influences. well, 5 the number one influence are his parents, of 6 course, his siblings, his teachers, his 7 neighborhood, his friends, his neighbors, his 8 peers, his school, the military. military was 9 big back then. we were just out of world 10 war ii. we had beaten the bad guys. the 11 american navy ruled the waves. the american 12 army conquered. the u.s. marines were tough. 13 that was in the 1940s, 1950s. big heros. 14 tv started in the early 1950s, and it was 15 saturated with tv ads. and then doctors, we 16 talk about doctors. so what do we have, 17 billboards, newspapers and magazines, and from 18 the annual report of philip morris and rjr -- i 19 cannot remember which one it was, in the '50s, 20 1957, 3 billion messages that year. that is one 21 company, and you see it has a synergistic 22 effect, because although he did not smoke 23 cigarettes from other companies, they all did 24 it. they all advertised. and every cigarette 25 company advertised sex, cool, sophisticated, 1 manly, boy meets girl. that was the story. 2 all right. this is frank gifford. we can 3 start it. 4 (thereupon, the video clip was played and 5 transcribed as follows:) 6 mr. gifford: some fun, i sure hope you 7 get a chance to try it sometime. here's 8 something else you ought to try, and soon, 9 lucky strike. why? because if you like taste 10 in your cigarette, you will get it with luckys. 11 this is all the taste a smoker could want. 12 it is rich and smooth, the taste of fine 13 tobacco. and let me tell you, once you start 14 getting that taste, you will want to keep getting 15 it -- 16 mr. barnhart: because you are addicted. 17 mr. gifford: -- so come on, get that fine 18 tobacco taste. get lucky, the taste to start 19 with -- 20 mr. barnhart: he was the biggest star. 21 mr. gifford: -- the taste to stay with. 22 get lucky strike. 23 mr. barnhart: the biggest star, the dan 24 marino of his life. 25 narrator: it takes a steady hand and a 1 quick mind to put a jet fighter plane through 2 its paces. every jet pilot is given intensive 3 training at some of the most modern airbases in 4 the world . . . try them for 30 days. you will 5 discover -- 6 mr. barnhart: for 30 days. 7 narrator: -- camel's rich flavor -- 8 mr. barnhart: dr. benowitz, get addicted. 9 try them for 30 days. 10 narrator: -- and cool mildness continue 11 to please you pack after pack. you will see why 12 camel is america's most popular cigarette. 13 leads all other brands by billions of 14 cigarettes per year. 15 banker: . . . with winston's filter blend 16 up front, it is like money in the bank -- 17 mr. barnhart: beverly hillbillies was the 18 most popular show on tv in its time. 19 banker: you are going to like winstons. 20 mr. clampett: i reckon i'll decide that 21 for myself. 22 banker: yes, sir. 23 mr. clampett: uhm, i like it. this here 24 winston tastes good . . . 25 ms. london: . . . you get a lot to like 6821 1 with a marlboro filtered, flavored, pack or 2 box. 3 mr. rubbel: gee, we ought to do 4 something -- 5 mr. barnhart: sexy, cool, sophisticated, 6 even the little fist bump with the cigarette. 7 it is very well done. there is no question about 8 it. 9 mr. rubbel: -- fred. 10 mr. flintstone: okay. how's about taking 11 a nap? 12 mr. rubble: hey, i got a better idea, 13 let us take a winston break. 14 mr. flintstone: that is it. winston is 15 the one filtered cigarette that delivers flavor 16 20 times a pack. winston's got that filter 17 blend. 18 mr. rubble: yeah, fred. filter blend 19 makes the big taste difference and only winston 20 has it, up front where it counts. here, ahead 21 of the pure white filter . . . 22 mr. flintstone: . . . winston tastes good 23 like a cigarette should. 24 (thereupon, the video clip ended.) 25 mr. barnhart: now, that was, in its time, 1 the number one tv show, and it was shown at 2 night. it was prime time. and who watched it? 3 a lot of people did. but who primarily watched 4 it? kids and teenagers. it just covered the 5 media, saturated the media. 6 all right. so that puts us into the time. 7 so what is the evidence you-all saw on 8 addiction, going back in time, realizing where 9 charlie grew up, how he grew up, what he 10 thought. the evidence on addiction causing 11 death came from three experts, and let us talk 12 about them. 13 these were three of the most qualified 14 experts in the world. i mean, it really bears 15 scrutiny as to who came to testify for you. 16 what did neal benowitz -- if you will recall, 17 he is published almost 400 peer review 18 documents -- peer-reviewed articles. that 19 means -- and we have heard about this, and some 20 of you know the process of peer review. you 21 cannot just willy-nilly throw off an article and 22 it gets published. it has to go to judges who 23 are leaders in their field, leaders in their 24 field. 25 he is a peer reviewer himself. he lectured 1 all over the world on nicotine, on addiction, 2 on substances. he is board-certified in three 3 specialties. he is written over 80 chapters in 4 books. he did not look that old. frankly, i 5 do not see how he did it. but eighty chapters 6 in books. he was involved in seven surgeon 7 general's reports. he was the senior editor of 8 the landmark 1988 surgeon general's report, 9 which did what? link addiction -- addiction to 10 nicotine to all other addictions, alcohol, 11 cocaine, heroin. put it in that class as a 12 matter of medical science. 13 so what did he say? cigarette smoke is 14 addictive; nicotine's is a responsible culprit; 15 the physiological processes are similar to 16 other drug addictions; nicotine is highly 17 addictive, and i believe he used 80 to 18 ninety percent of the people who used nicotine 19 regularly are addicted. you remember that. 20 compare that to alcohol. now, many people 21 drink alcohol. not many people are alcoholics. 22 it is ten percent or lower. nicotine, 80 to 90 23 percent of the people, regular smokers, become 24 addicted. does everybody? no. some people 25 are lucky. but a regular smoker, eight to nine 1 out of ten become addicted. 2 okay. and he is consulted with a number of 3 organizations around the world, the national 4 cancer institute, the epa, and so on. 5 david burns. david burns was our first 6 witness in this case, as you will recall, a long 7 time ago. it is been a month-long trial. david 8 burns, medical school at dartmouth, medical 9 school at harvard. and he took -- he studied 10 from harrison's, as do all doctors, all 11 fledgling doctors, in the united states and 12 probably in a lot of countries, harrison's or 13 cecil. that is your basic textbook. and he 14 studied from it at dartmouth and harvard. 15 he wrote -- and he wrote chapters on 16 nicotine in those books and at the time he 17 became a star in his field. so when the new 18 doctors at harvard and dartmouth and the 19 university of florida and university of miami 20 are studying to become doctors, they are reading 21 chapters written by dr. burns. 22 he was the senior editor of the 1975 and 23 1976 surgeon general's reports. and then he 24 had an important role. it varied, but an 25 important role in every single surgeon general 1 report thereafter, except for a couple, '75, 2 '76, '79, '80, '81, '82, '84, '85, '87, '88, 3 '01 and '04. and every one of those surgeon 4 general's reports were attacked by tobacco, and 5 we are going to see the evidence. do not take my 6 word for it. you have seen it. we are going to 7 put it together, and we are going to see the 8 documents, and you will watch that attack as part 9 of a coordinated plan. 10 you know, it is rare that you get a case 11 where you have actual documents showing a 12 conspiracy, a cover up, a plan. most cases are 13 like footprints in the sand. you have to piece 14 it together. not here. not here. you are 15 going to see it in their own words. 16 all right. let us go to the next one. 17 then we brought dr. michael cummings, and 18 he is a ph.d. kind of doctor. he is at the 19 roswell cancer institute, and he has written 20 almost 270 peer-reviewed articles. so when you 21 put these experts together, folks, we are 22 talking about a thousand, approximately, 23 peer-reviewed articles from the people that 24 came before you. 25 he served on editorial boards of the two 1 leading cancer journals. he is the director of 2 new york state's smoking cessation line. and 3 what did they have -- something like a million 4 people have gone through it, something like 5 that. it is the oldest cancer hospital in the 6 country. he got 50 -- what was it -- 57 grants 7 for over $57 million for the roswell cancer 8 institute. he was the author, senior editor 9 and senior author of the 1988 and 1999 surgeon 10 general's reports. 11 and then -- and you will see what happened. 12 and tobacco said, look, we have done a lot of 13 good things. we put -- we put warnings on 14 cigarette -- cigarette packages. well, sure, 15 because they were forced to by law. you will see 16 from the facts that everything they did, all 17 the manufacturing changes they did were either 18 required by an act of congress, forced by a 19 lawsuit, or done to maximize profit. every 20 single one of the things they did. 21 and so, he, dr. cummings, is the 22 repository of millions of documents from the 23 state attorney's general who sued the tobacco 24 companies and forced them to produce the 25 documents which you have seen in this court and 1 you will see now. thank you. 2 okay. so who did tobacco bring to talk 3 about addiction? we heard about each one of 4 these folks. tobacco brought nobody, nobody to 5 say that charlie was not addicted. 6 now, look, tobacco has the resources, and 7 they certainly have the lawyers who can find an 8 expert around this country to have said charlie 9 piendle was not addicted. 10 mr. kelly: your honor -- 11 mr. barnhart: and they did not. 12 mr. kelly: your honor, it is improper to 13 reference resources of the various parties. 14 the court: i'll sustain, and ask the jury 15 to disregard that statement by counsel. 16 mr. barnhart: thank you, your honor. 17 we know that the experts they did bring 18 came from las vegas, nevada, right, and from 19 tennessee -- knoxville, tennessee. they 20 brought nobody. nobody. 21 okay. so what was the testimony that you 22 heard, without a doubt, according to dr. burns, 23 according to dr. cummings, without a doubt, 24 addiction was a contributing cause of his 25 death. now, what are you going to do with 1 evidence of that -- like that? it is all -- 2 it is not just the greater weight of the 3 evidence. there is none on the other side. 4 so the evidence on that is very clear, but 5 we need to see how that affected -- because 6 it is not just whether he was addicted, it is how 7 it affected his behavior and the behavior of 8 everybody else they studied and who was 9 addicted to cigarettes. addiction drove his 10 smoking. 11 when an addicted smoker smokes, there is a 12 drive. it is the drive for addiction. it is the 13 core. it is the critical element to what a 14 smoker does. it is the critical element to why 15 somebody will smoke 20 or 30 or 40 cigarettes a 16 day for ten, 15, 20, 40, 50 years. your 17 control is affected and, as we will see, most 18 smokers want to quit and want to -- and regret 19 the day they started. and it is no longer a 20 free choice. it is not impossible, nobody ever 21 said that it was impossible to quit smoking 22 cigarettes. we know people do it. many people 23 have done it. millions of people have done it. 24 but it is difficult. it is doggone difficult. 25 it is hard. and as charlie said to his family, 1 it is the hardest thing he ever did. 2 when we picked the jury, you heard that 3 from some of the smokers who smoked a long 4 time: it was a hard, hard thing to do from an 5 addicted smoker. 6 and the relapse rate, unfortunately, well, 7 you can quit, but the relapse rate is tough. 8 so people have quit for a day, a week, a month, 9 a year, sometimes many years, but the relapse 10 rate is high. 11 okay. and that brings us to the circle of 12 addiction, which you saw, but it is a good graph 13 to show things. people experiment. kids, 14 usually, experiment. 15 can you see mr. tad-y? 16 juror tad-y: yes. 17 mr. barnhart: as they smoke more 18 cigarettes and they become more and more 19 addicted, their choice, their free choice 20 diminishes, until they get to the point where 21 they are addicted, and then you have daily use 22 and physical dependence. 23 could you go to the next one? 24 then, what do we have? we have a cycle of 25 addiction. that is why people smoke so much, 1 smoke so regularly. there are actual physical 2 changes. there are brain changes in the brain 3 of smokers. you heard dr. benowitz talk about 4 tolerance, and tolerance is -- most people who 5 have tried cigarettes had an unpleasant 6 experience. they either get sick or they do not 7 like it. 8 they certainly could not start smoking two 9 packs a day, for example, when you are kid. 10 you would become deathly ill, but you develop 11 tolerance over time. then you develop a 12 compulsion, a physical compulsion, a physical 13 craving to have cigarettes, and then you 14 develop withdrawal symptoms, which are -- range 15 from very unpleasant to dreadful. they are 16 awful. and then it goes hand in glove with the 17 psychological effects. people like the high. 18 it relaxes people. it stimulates them. 19 remember that? it targets the pleasure center. 20 so the brain secretes dopamine, and all the 21 other pleasure hormones that dr. benowitz 22 talked about. 23 but over time, over time, that constant 24 bath of nicotine causes the body to reach an 25 equilibrium where the body lowers its own 1 natural production of dopamine, and that causes 2 withdrawal symptoms. so in a daily cycle, even 3 though people do not think, gosh, i'm going 4 through withdrawal, they think or they feel 5 it is time for a cigarette. 6 and if you -- an addicted smoker, a 7 regular smoker takes them out, depends on how 8 addicted they are, you take your cigarettes out 9 for two hours or one hour, three hours, first 10 thing they do, they are fumbling with their 11 cigarettes when they get out of whatever it is, 12 movie, church, a restaurant. that is now. 13 i mean, you heard testimony from liz and 14 tracy. their daughter was a gifted gymnast, 15 and she had dance recitals and so on. cannot 16 smoke there, now not, not a cute little girl. 17 as soon as there was an intermission, mom and 18 dad were out there smoking cigarettes, because 19 they had the craving, because withdrawal 20 symptoms started. 21 all right. so let us talk about the brain 22 changes. and there was an issue that one of 23 you raised, and it was a very good one, and 24 that is what are short-term brain changes and 25 what are the long-term brain changes. and this 1 is a video of dr. benowitz about three weeks 2 ago in front of you. 3 if you could. 4 (thereupon, the video clip was played and 5 transcribed as follows:) 6 q. "and what are the permanent brain changes 7 called?" 8 a. "well, again" -- 9 (thereupon, the video clip ended.) 10 mr. kelly: your honor, this is from the 11 testimony in court. it is impermissible to show 12 any videos of what occurred in court. a 13 transcript is the only record that can be used. 14 mr. barnhart: the transcript is right 15 here, your honor. 16 the court: counsel can approach. 17 (thereupon, the following proceedings were 18 held out of the presence of the jury:) 19 mr. barnhart: i thought -- i thought you 20 had -- 21 the court reporter: wait, hold on a 22 second, it is so loud in my ear, it is blaring. 23 mr. barnhart: you need a statute, case 24 law without using video -- you have the 25 transcript. 1 mr. kelly: i'd be happy to give it to 2 you. the reason i did not use any of it, i 3 looked to see if there was a rule, and there is 4 one right on point. 5 the court: you have to bring that, yeah. 6 mr. barnhart: it is just one question and 7 one answer. 8 mr. kelly: we gave it to you this 9 morning, your honor. 10 the court: apparently, it is just the one 11 question and answer. 12 so do you want to just move on then? if 13 they are objecting and there is a -- all -- i 14 need time to look at it. 15 (thereupon, the sidebar conference was 16 concluded and the following proceedings were 17 held within the presence of the jury:) 18 mr. barnhart: tell you what, here's what 19 we will do, go ahead and turn off the sound, and 20 we will read it. 21 okay. so here was the question from 22 dr. -- that i posed to dr. benowitz: 23 "what are the permanent brain changes 24 called?" 25 answer: "well, again, the technical term 1 for it is neuroplasticity, which really means 2 that you are developing new brain circuits." 3 "thank you." 4 and we had, if you will remember, we had 5 dr. benowitz -- 6 christine, i do not want to smash you. 7 and i wrote down some of the things 8 dr. benowitz said. and dr. benowitz said, 9 you are most vulnerable to addiction when you are 10 young, when you are a youth. the average age 11 people start is 14 to 15 years, and that 12 eighty percent of the smokers are regular smokers, 13 not experimenting, regular smokers by the time 14 they are 18. 15 and then i ask him, "well, is this an 16 informed decision, based upon all your 17 research, based upon everything you have done, 18 based upon your evaluation with an involvement 19 with the surgeon general?" 20 he said, "no, it is not an informed 21 decision." 22 teenagers -- i mean, do we need an expert 23 to say it? the teenager brain is 24 physiologically not fully developed. they can 25 be big, but the judgment centers are affected, 1 and children's brains top out at about age 20, 2 21, 22, depending on who you are. that is why 3 teenagers do so many dumb things. their 4 judgment centers are affected. but it is not an 5 informed decision for somebody who is 12, 13, 6 14, 15. 7 and then he said, "teens underestimate how 8 much they will smoke and whether they will get 9 addicted." right? 10 so that is actually the decision. they see 11 all this stuff. it is really cool. it is really 12 sexy. i want to be cool. i want to be sexy. 13 i want to look good. i want my self-image to 14 be good. but they do not understand how much 15 they are going to smoke, and they have no clue 16 about addiction. 17 and what are the stages of somebody who is 18 starting, a kid who is starting? he prepares. 19 there is a trial and experimental phase. then 20 they start regular use, and within 30 days it is 21 regular use, and most kids are addicted. 22 okay. and he said, look, nicotine is a 23 drug addiction, pure and simple. there is -- 24 and it involves, like any drug addiction, a 25 loss of control. it is a disease of the brain 1 reward centers, the hormones receptors, and the 2 average number of attempts before someone is 3 finally able to quit, the average number is 4 five. five. that is how strong the addiction 5 is. 6 and then he was talking about -- we talk 7 about the cycle of addiction, which we just 8 covered, and then he talked about 9 neuroplasticity, which are the long-term brain 10 changes. and then we talked about 11 rationalization and denial. 12 why with withdrawal do we rationalize? 13 why do we deny something that a nonsmoker today 14 can see clearly? because we want a crutch, as 15 tobacco puts it, a psychological crutch. 16 all right. so let us talk about levels of 17 addiction, if we could. we found out from all 18 the evidence, and i summarize it all right 19 here, that more heavily addicted people start 20 at a younger age; that heavier smokers are more 21 heavily addicted; that a cigarette the first 22 thing in the morning is the hallmark of 23 addiction; and that those who have smoked for a 24 long time are the most heavily addicted and, 25 conversely, the less heavily addicted are just 1 the other way, they are older, they are light 2 smokers. they do not smoke their first 3 cigarette as soon as they get up out of bed or 4 right when they have their coffee. they smoke 5 for less time. it is exposure related, in other 6 words. 7 okay. so where does charlie piendle fit? 8 well, if you will remember the fagerstrom test, 9 based on dr. fagerstrom, you saw it a couple of 10 times. you saw it with dr. benowitz, and then 11 you saw it when liz piendle testified. 12 now, let us go back. this is the 13 fagerstrom test used by people involved in 14 addiction medicine. it is the gold standard, if 15 you will, and let us take charlie through this. 16 how soon, after you wake up, do you first 17 smoke your first cigarette? that is question 18 no. 1 because it is the most important. 19 all right. liz piendle: "we both had 20 cigarettes on the side of our bed." you know, 21 their ashtrays and smoking stuff on either side 22 of the bedstand. smoked at night, they smoked 23 first thing in the morning. 24 ted cabral, babe cabral: "first thing in 25 the morning." 6838 1 eddie piendle: "first thing with coffee, 2 right away." 3 so within five minutes, maybe six minutes, 4 it is either a three or a two. charlie piendle, 5 most important. 6 so let us go to the second question. "do 7 you find it difficult to defrain -- refrain," 8 excuse me, "from smoking in places where it is 9 forbidden?" 10 we heard liz, and we heard tracy. they 11 could barely sit through tracy's recital. 12 first night out, bang, they would be right outside 13 smoking. 14 third question. "which cigarette would 15 you hate to give up in the morning?" 16 well, we do not have charlie to say that. 17 liz said, "i think it would have been the first 18 one when he got up in the morning." 19 and i'm sure she is right. but let us give 20 them that because we do not have charlie, and 21 i'm sure they never talked about, "charlie, 22 which cigarette is most important to you?" 23 that is something most people would not talk 24 about. 25 let us go to the next one. 1 how many cigarettes per day do you smoke? 2 well, there is evidence back and forth. 3 liz said, clearly, between 31 or more. when 4 they were cutting back, it was less. most of 5 the time it was two packs a day. 6 how do we know that? well, medical 7 records are in evidence, okay? 8 most of these medical records are from the 9 va when charlie piendle went in to be treated 10 for lung cancer, and charlie piendle did not 11 want to die. we can see that in the records. 12 and he told -- he told the doctors that. 13 so what he did to help him, to help his 14 recovery, we hope, is that they give a history 15 to a doctor, and the thing you tell your doctor 16 when he is trying to save your life is the 17 truth. it is long before any lawsuits, long 18 before anything. 19 so what did he tell his doctor? one, 20 smoker, one pack a day, smoked age 16 to 48. 21 that is when you become a regular smoker. 40 to 22 45-pack smoking history. those are pack years. 23 40 to 45, packs per day, 40 to 45, 50-pack 24 years. you have different doctors give 25 different things. smoking two packs per day, 1 two packs per day for many years, two packs of 2 cigarettes per day for many years. they just 3 smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for many 4 years, two packs of cigarettes, two packs of 5 cigarettes, two packs of cigarettes, two packs 6 of cigarettes. he smoked a lot. he clearly 7 smoked, going back to the fagerstrom test, the 8 highest amount. 9 let us go to our next question. do you 10 smoke more frequently during the first hours 11 after awakening than during the rest of the 12 day? 13 now, why is that an important question, 14 just like the first cigarette in the morning? 15 because that is when withdrawal is at its most 16 keen moment. right? 17 you do not have nicotine bathing your brain 18 and you crave it, you need it, and that is why 19 it is the most dear. 20 well, what did liz say? yes, in the 21 morning. why? to replenish the nicotine 22 levels. 23 let us go on to the next one. 24 and do you smoke even if you are so ill 25 that you are in bed? okay. so remember what 1 the evidence is about this. 2 charlie piendle had crohn's disease, 3 does not have anything to do with this case, 4 it is an autoimmune disorder, your body attacks 5 your intestinal tract. so what we know from 6 the evidence is, is really painful. there is 7 nothing worse than when your guts are hurting, 8 when you feel sick, when you feel nauseated, 9 when you feel like you have diarrhea, that is an 10 awful feeling. people do not leave the bathroom 11 when it is bad. 12 charlie had severe occurrences of it. he 13 had to leave the marine corps because of the 14 first occurrence. the second occurrence when 15 he had an acute attack and he almost died, he 16 was in the hospital for months, according to 17 liz. that is when they took out his lower 18 colon, that is when he had the colostomy bag. 19 and what did liz say and what did tracy 20 say? liz -- i do not know if tracy was there. 21 what liz said is, even in the va hospital, when 22 he was so sick he almost died, he was sitting 23 there smoking away or lying there smoking away. 24 clearly, he met that standard. 25 so let us go -- let us tally this score. 1 all right. so if you want to give him 2 everything, how soon did he wake up? within 3 five minutes, three points. difficult to 4 refrain, one point. which cigarette would you 5 hate to give up? we do not know. i bet if you 6 ask charlie, it would be that, we will give him 7 that. how many cigarettes? 31 or more a day. 8 do you smoke more frequently during the first 9 hours? you bet. did you smoke when you are 10 sick? he smoked when he was so sick he was 11 almost dead. 12 and so what does the score -- what does 13 the fagerstrom score tell us? over seven. 14 your level of dependence is high. you are not 15 in control of your smoking, it, your smoking, 16 is in control of you. 17 okay. we did not invent this for this 18 lawsuit. that is what is used by nicotine 19 addiction specialists over the world, and as 20 you heard dr. benowitz, addiction involves a 21 loss of control. 22 all right. so what is it? as 23 dr. benowitz said, a chronic relapsing disease. 24 dr. cummings told us eighty percent of current 25 smokers would not start again. whoa, that is 1 customer satisfaction, eighty percent would not 2 start again. 80 to ninety percent want to quit. 3 96 percent have tried to quit. 4 and so why are smokers still smoking? 5 because they are addicted, because it is tough, 6 because it hurts, because it is miserable to 7 quit, because for some smokers, it is the 8 hardest thing they ever did, and for some 9 smokers, even those who are in the hospital, 10 dying, as dr. benowitz said, from heart disease 11 or lung cancer, they are still smoking, maybe 12 through a trach, they are still smoking because 13 they cannot quit. that is not everybody, but 14 that is how insidious this addiction is. 15 what are the relapse rates, because 16 quitting is only half the story. 95 percent of 17 people relapse as they are on their road to 18 trying to quit, and the average quit attempts, 19 we talked about, it is five. 20 so what does tobacco claim about all this? 21 well, they presented no evidence, not one 22 smidgen. they called no witnesses, not one 23 witness. but they say this: look, this was 24 just a choice. he was not motivated. he was 25 only motivated when he finally quit. they 1 did not throw out the ashtrays. he did not seek 2 hypnosis. he did not go to see a shrink. 3 well, when charlie was quitting, trying to 4 quit, they did not have the patch, they did not 5 have chantix, they did not have anything except 6 nicorette gum by prescription, and what charlie 7 did is he used toothpicks, all along, really, 8 toothpicks and straws and he finally was able 9 to quit it. 10 okay. they say, hey, look, charlie 11 piendle was a marine, he was strong-willed. 12 and i asked dr. benowitz that question, do 13 strong-willed people get addicted? do marines 14 get addicted? do people who read newspapers 15 get addicted? of course. of course. or he 16 could have quit earlier, he could have quit -- 17 you know, he quit. see, they turned it on its 18 head. he quit, so he could have quit earlier. 19 that is what is known as circular reasoning, 20 is not it? he quit, therefore, he could have 21 quit at any time. great argument. 22 people, according to dr. burns and 23 dr. cummings and dr. benowitz, do not just 24 choose to die. they smoke because they are 25 addicted. no one just chooses to die. no one 1 is motivated to die. they smoke because they 2 have to or until they are able to quit. 3 okay. so we have a jury verdict form 4 that is been sitting there all by itself and 5 there are some questions that we have to answer 6 and we are going to go through this. so the 7 first thing, i'm going to combine them, were 8 tobacco's defective and dangerous cigarettes a 9 cause of death? and did the defendants conceal 10 facts about heath and addiction? i'll put them 11 together so it will make it easier. 12 okay. let us go to the findings by the 13 court. if you could show those. these are the 14 instructions of finding, they are actually over 15 here behind me, which i'm sure nobody can see. 16 the first one is smoking causes lung cancer. 17 we cannot go behind those findings, those are 18 the findings from the florida supreme court in 19 the engle case. 20 nicotine is addictive, is the second 21 finding. 22 the defendants, rjr and philip morris 23 placed cigarettes on the market that were 24 defective and unreasonably dangerous, that they 25 concealed or omitted material information not 1 otherwise known or available, knowing that the 2 material was false or misleading and they -- or 3 they failed to disclose a material fact 4 concerning the health effect of -- or the 5 addictive nature of smoking. 6 and then, finally, this is really where 7 all the meat is, but we are going to see this, 8 they agreed to conceal or omit information 9 regarding the health effects of cigarettes. 10 they agreed to conceal with others with the 11 intent that smokers and the public would rely 12 on this information to their detriment. and 13 then they talk about the companies that were 14 involved and they also include the tobacco 15 institute, which we are going to see and you have 16 heard about, and council for tobacco research 17 and so on. 18 so those are findings, we cannot go behind 19 them. so we can only look to see what did 20 philip morris and rjr know and what did they do 21 with that knowledge. what did they know? when 22 did they know it? and what did they do with 23 that knowledge? 24 okay. let us start in the beginning, 1953, 25 the claude teague memo. 1953, a research 1 scientist at r.j. reynolds does this, he 2 studies all of the cancer studies, that is, he 3 does a review of all the cancer articles around 4 the world, and this is what he comes up with, 5 you know, and this is given to the executives, 6 to the top brass. he does not just leave it on 7 his desk. 8 what does he show? studies of clinical 9 data tend to confirm the relationship between 10 heavy and prolonged tobacco use, tobacco 11 smoking, and incidence of cancer of the lung. 12 and what did these articles and the 13 bibliographies say, cancer, cancer, cancer, 14 tumor, tumor, tumor, cancer, cancer, cancer. 15 this was not public knowledge at this time, this 16 was knowledge that they had. but very soon, 17 there was a cancer scare. and we heard about 18 this, there were a number of studies, but the 19 one that really captured the public's attention 20 was when a doctor did a study, painted 21 cigarette tar on the backs of mice and they 22 grew tumors. it was a mouse study and that got 23 a lot of publicity. tv was new, but it was on 24 tv, it was in newspapers. 25 and what do we know? cigarette sales 1 began to fall, they plummeted, really. 2 if we can go to the next one. maybe we are 3 having some technical difficulties. 4 but what happened was, sales began to 5 fall, and that was extremely alarming to the 6 tobacco industry, because the last time they 7 had sales fall was in the great depression. 8 they did not fall that much, according to 9 dr. burns, because people needed their 10 cigarettes. so what they had is an emergency 11 december meeting. 12 are we up there or no? okay. 13 so what happened, they had a series of two 14 meetings. where? the plaza hotel in new york 15 city. 16 now, before this, the cigarette companies 17 were fierce competitors, because everybody was 18 trying to market each other, elbow each other 19 out to capture the share of the market, it was 20 an extremely lucrative business. and what they 21 wanted to do is capture the share of the 22 particular smokers. 23 so this was an extraordinary meeting, 24 extraordinary. and what did they do, right, 25 they had -- they are armed with the knowledge 1 that their products caused lung cancer, and so 2 did they bring their scientists? did they 3 invite world class scientists like the -- back 4 then, equivalent to dr. benowitz or dr. burns? 5 no. did they would bring the surgeon general, the 6 doctor to the united states of america? no. 7 did they bring any doctors? no. who did they 8 bring? the c.e.o.s, the presidents, and a pr 9 firm, and a pr firm, best in the business, 10 hill & knowlton. 11 all right. so at this point, philip 12 morris and rjr had choices. they talk about 13 charlie's choices. they made choices, and they 14 made a choice, a plan, a strategy that was 15 hatched that would go for 50 years. 16 all right. so what was their choice? 17 conceal, cover up, do not link hands with the 18 medical authorities, cover it up, conceal it, 19 never tell the truth, fight every health 20 announcement. and we saw that happen. every 21 surgeon general's report was attacked. false, 22 defamatory, it is unproven, it is a controversy. 23 and then when you fight, reassure, reassure 24 your customers, because if you do not, guess 25 what? people might quit. they might start 1 quitting and they might, even worse, not take 2 it up in the first place. that would be a 3 catastrophe. of course, the millions of people 4 getting lung cancer and emphysema, well, that 5 was not the primary concern. 6 so we have some memos of these meetings, 7 if we could. 8 this -- this is a -- really, this is a 9 unique document. this is the hill & knowlton, 10 the pr firm's rendition of what happened, 11 because they went and talked to people from the 12 tobacco industry. so the author says, the pr 13 guy, the adman says, you will get little real 14 information about lung cancer, but you will get 15 some mighty interesting opinions. one of the 16 men said, it is fortunate for us that cigarettes 17 are a habit they cannot break. whoopee for us. 18 they are hooked, they are addicted. said 19 another, boy, would not it be wonderful if our 20 company was the first to produce a cancer-free 21 cigarette for health reasons? no. what we 22 could do to the competition, how much more 23 money. but there is more here. 24 would not it be wonderful if we were the 25 first to produce a cancer-free cigarette? and 1 what does that statement say? our cigarettes 2 are not cancer free. our cigarettes cause 3 cancer. this is back then. this is not 2010, 4 this is 1953. suppose everybody smoked just 5 one cigarette less a day, that would be maybe 6 40 billion a year. you know what was on their 7 minds, and it was not the health of their 8 customers, it was not the health of the american 9 public. 10 so what did they do? this resulted in 11 what is called the frank statement, and there 12 was nothing frank about it. you have seen this 13 from the evidence. this frank statement was a 14 pure public relations endeavor that was part of 15 this 50-year plan. 16 okay. so there is only one problem, they 17 say. so what is the problem? health, our 18 customers may be dying? no. it is confidence. 19 public assurance. how do we assure the public, 20 not how do we protect the public, how do we 21 assure them, how to free millions of americans 22 from the guilty fear that is going to arise deep 23 in their biological depths, regardless of any 24 pooh-poohing logic, every time they light a 25 cigarette. how do we make them feel better? 1 how do we relieve them of the fear? that is the 2 question. that was their challenge. 3 so they issued the frank statement, okay. 4 and here is the frank statement and this -- 5 remember the frank statement, it was published 6 in 248 of the leading newspapers in the country 7 and it hit almost everybody in the country. 8 what did it say? medical research indicates 9 many possible causes of lung cancer. conceal, 10 cover up. 11 there is no proof that cigarette smoking 12 is one of those causes, and they did that. 13 they knew there was proof, they knew what 14 caused it, they are talking to the admen. 15 we believe the products we make are not 16 injurious to health, they do not hurt anybody. 17 never tell the truth. 18 we always have and always will cooperate 19 closely with those whose task it is to 20 safeguard the public health. that was a lie 21 too. they never did, not once. 22 all right. so their plan -- go if you 23 could to their plan, and what was the plan? 24 make it easy to start smoking. make it as hard 25 as possible to stop. make it as easy as 1 possible to start up again. easy to start, 2 hard to quit, and easy as possible to start up 3 again, and all the reasons that they did that. 4 okay. so that brings us to some of the 5 new documents, and the first one is from rjr, i 6 believe, the most important type of story, this 7 is when they are setting the plan how to tell 8 the story, the most important type of story is 9 that which casts doubt, casts doubt on the 10 cause and effect theory of disease and smoking. 11 so they are formulating their plan, what we want 12 are how to cast doubt on the science. 13 our basic position, they say, in the 14 cigarette controversy is subject to the charge 15 and may be subject to a finding that we are 16 making false and misleading statements to 17 promote the sale of cigarettes. they are right. 18 they are right. 19 now, this was not intended for public 20 consumption. this was the tobacco institute 21 and all the companies, and there were c.e.o.s 22 or the vice president or whatever, on this 23 tobacco institute, they rotated chairmanship. 24 and what are they saying? look, our position 25 is such that we may be subject to a finding 1 that we are making false statements, that we are 2 making misleading statements to the public, to 3 the surgeon general, to our customers, do not 4 take it from me, take it from them. 5 the clerk: counsel. 6 mr. barnhart: thank you. 7 so what happens is did they know, of 8 course, that cigarettes were dangerous? this 9 is shortly before they sent things on. yes, 10 they knew. they are talking about carcinogens, 11 carcinogens clearly cause cancer. 12 we can skip over that for the lack of 13 time. 14 the physiological requirements of the 15 smoker could be met by the application of the 16 optimum amount of nicotine to be extracted, 17 expanded tobacco. 18 what does that mean? it means that they 19 meet the needs of the addicted smoker by 20 adjusting the amount of nicotine. you put it 21 in, you take it out. you put it in, you take 22 it out. you keep the smoker addicted, take 23 away his choice, make it terribly difficult to 24 stop. 25 okay. so what did tobacco know and what 1 did they -- what did they conceal? they knew, 2 in fact, that tobacco causes cancer. 3 oh, we are still going. 4 okay. this is important. 5 during the past two decades, they say, 6 1962, rjr, cigarette smoke has been the target 7 of a bunch of studies relating to ill health. 8 the majority of these studies incriminate 9 cigarette smoke from a health viewpoint. 10 well, that is not a surprise, but this is 11 back in the '60s. obviously, the amount of 12 evidence accumulated to indict cigarette smoke 13 as a health hazard is overwhelming. the 14 evidence challenging this indictment is scant. 15 put this in time. this is about -- this 16 is 1962, late 1962. what came out in late 17 1964? the landmark surgeon general's report. 18 so what they are talking about -- they knew that 19 scientists were working on, and so what they are 20 doing is they are anticipating the surgeon 21 general's report and, of course, we know that 22 they denied any link, but what is happening is 23 they are saying the evidence to indict cigarette 24 smoke is overwhelming, the evidence challenging 25 this is scant. that is what they knew before 1 the surgeon general's report came out. 2 okay. then we have two things. this is, 3 again, close and prior to the surgeon general's 4 report. let us go through that quickly. this 5 is a talk about carcinogen. 6 what is a carcinogen? according to 7 tobacco, it is a substance which applied to the 8 tissue of a test animal causes a tumor. and we 9 have to assume that if a tumor is caused in an 10 animal, it is caused in a human. you have to -- 11 that is their definition. carcinogens are found 12 in practically every class of compounds in 13 smoke. 14 and what is the next document? 15 carcinogens are found in practically every 16 class of compound in smoke. and present 17 technology does not permit selective filtration 18 of particulate smoke. we cannot filter out any 19 of this stuff, they know that. 20 so this is just before the surgeon 21 general's report. and then they send a letter 22 to the surgeon general, because they knew the 23 report was coming out, 1963. right after we 24 just saw their internal document that says 25 that, what did they tell the surgeon general? 1 none of the chemical substances listed, to our 2 knowledge, has been found by scientific 3 research to be harmful to the health of the 4 smoker in amounts reported in smoke. 5 what did they -- what did they know? it 6 was carcinogen, it caused cancer, the evidence 7 was overwhelming, the evidence against was 8 scant, and what did they officially say to the 9 surgeon general? it is not there. it is not 10 there. they lied to the surgeon general. they 11 did not just mislead, that was deceit, but it 12 was deceit with a motive. 13 okay. so then we go on. we know the 14 surgeon general's report did find a link to 15 cancer, and that made big news. so then we 16 come down to 1972 to talk about addiction, 17 because they always denied it was addictive, 18 it is just a habit, just a habit. 19 okay. so what is going on behind the 20 scenes at rjr in this case? happily for the 21 tobacco industry, nicotine is both habituating 22 and unique. if nicotine is a sine qua non, the 23 end all, be all of tobacco products, and 24 tobacco products are recognized as being 25 attracted dosage forms of nicotine -- sounds 1 like a doctor, does not it? write a 2 prescription, what are we doing? we are making 3 dosage -- dosage machines is what we are doing. 4 we are giving our smokers doses of nicotine. we 5 have -- and this follows back the plot. we 6 have deliberately played down the role of 7 nicotine. 8 now, look, defense counsel is going to get 9 up here and say, hey, everybody knew nicotine 10 was habit forming. they talked about nicotine 11 fiend, cigarette fiends, we had this and we had 12 that. look what tobacco said in the privacy of 13 their own boardrooms, we have deliberately, not 14 accidently, not negligently, not inadvertently, 15 we have deliberately played down the role of 16 nicotine. we somehow must convince him, the 17 smoker, with wholly irrational reasons that he 18 should try smoking, in the hope that he will 19 himself then discover the real satisfactions. 20 those are not my italics or quotes. you know 21 what they are? theirs. because you know what 22 real satisfactions are? nicotine addiction. 23 all right. let us go to the next one. 24 so get them to rely, get the people to 25 rely, downplay the addiction. all right. so 1 then we come up to what they know. all right. 2 our next one is an rjr memo and this one says, 3 we -- they are worried about their business, 4 right, so we cannot ever be comfortable selling 5 a product which most of our customers would 6 stop using if they could. again, they knew it 7 was addictive. that is to say, hey, we would 8 lose our business, we would go out of business 9 overnight. we cannot be comfortable marketing a 10 product which most of our customers would do 11 without if they could. most of our customers 12 would do without if they could, but they cannot, 13 and we deliberately downplayed the role of 14 addiction. 15 all right. so was their plan successful? 16 their plan was amazingly successful. you have 17 got to hand it to them, if you are going to 18 hatch a plot, if you are going to conceal, if 19 you are going to mislead, they did a terrific 20 job of it. 21 how do we know? well, they say so 22 themselves. this industry has employed a 23 single strategy, and you have seen it, cover up, 24 while the strategy was brilliantly conceived 25 and brilliantly executed, over the years, it is 1 just a holding strategy, right? 2 so, you know, again, this is not a 3 footprint in the sand. this is a confession. 4 it is brilliantly conceived, it is brilliantly 5 executed. who says so? we do. because we did 6 it. what is our strategy? create doubt. do not 7 take my word for it, take theirs. creating 8 doubt about the health charge, without actually 9 denying it. advocate the public's right to 10 smoke without actually urging them to take it 11 up. oh, it was a good plan, it was a good 12 plan, and it provided reassurance to these 13 addicted smokers over the years and their 14 business went up and up and up. 15 okay. that brings us to the next 16 document, and now this talks about the tobacco 17 institute's successful defensive operation, and 18 then they talk -- because people had not -- 19 are we here? okay. i'm going to have to 20 go through these more quickly. 21 look, if this committee had not been 22 formed, that is their plan, the cigarette 23 industry, by now, would be in a deplorable 24 portion. you know why? because if word had 25 gotten out, they would be in the position 1 people are in now, people still smoke, but it is 2 at a far less rate. what would have happened 3 is people would have tried to quit and many 4 would have been successful and many more, 5 millions more would never have started. 6 okay. so we would be in a deplorable 7 position, instead a very fine job has been 8 counteracting unverified, unjustified, and 9 unsubstantiated claims. it is been a successful 10 defensive operation. 11 go to the next one. 12 the tirc, so what do we have here? let us 13 look at this. nicotine is addictive. we are in 14 the business of selling nicotine, 1963, right 15 before the surgeon general's report. an 16 addictive drug, but guess what? cigarettes, 17 nicotine have some unattractive side effects. 18 gee, that is too bad. what are they? they 19 cause or predispose people to lung cancer. 20 well, that is a bad side effect. they 21 contribute to cardiovascular disorders and they 22 may call emphysema and so on. 23 next one. 24 okay. so what was the tirc? philip 25 morris, happens to be one of their documents. 1 we must, in the near future, provide some 2 answers which will give smokers a psychological 3 crutch and self-denial -- i mean, 4 self-rationale. 5 that is one of the most important documents 6 here. why? because that is the reliance, get 7 people to rely, give smokers a psychological 8 crutch and a self-rationale to continue. 9 excuse me. get them to doubt. get them to 10 rely. that is it. that is the plan. that is the 11 bottom line, make more money, sell more 12 cigarettes, hook more people. 13 then they had a new public relations firm, 14 and this one is, if we could, this is tiderock 15 corporation. and their proposal, which was 16 accepted, reestablished the cigarette 17 controversy. 18 and what is the controversy? it is 19 unproven, we do not know, it is not addictive, 20 it is a choice, but it is going to cost us a lot 21 of money. back in that day, 1967, 50 million a 22 year. it is chicken feed now. 23 okay. did they mislead the public? they 24 attacked the surgeon general in 1972. they 25 attacked the surgeon general in 1964. they 1 attacked the surgeon general again and again 2 and again. let us go very quickly through these 3 if we could. 4 look what they say about the '72 surgeon 5 general's report. it insults the scientific 6 community. and we know from their documents 7 that we just saw that they agreed with what the 8 surgeon general said. they knew the surgeon 9 general was telling the truth. insults the 10 scientific community. 11 the number one health problem is not 12 cigarette smoking. no, it is not. it is the 13 extent to which public health officials, the 14 surgeon general, is knowingly misleading the 15 american public. that lying surgeon general, 16 he is misleading the public, that is the danger, 17 not cigarettes. and we know they knew the 18 surgeon general was right. 19 next one. 20 okay. more continuing controversy. 21 scientists are becoming concerned that the 22 preoccupation with smoking -- no scientists 23 were, none of them, except paid for by grants 24 from tobacco. those were the scientists. 25 becoming concerned with the preoccupation that 1 smoking may become -- may be both unfounded and 2 dangerous. 3 and here's why. here's what they say. 4 it is dangerous because it diverts attention 5 from other hazards. focusing on tobacco is 6 dangerous. it is dangerous. and they knew that 7 was wrong, they knew it was deceit, they knew 8 it was misleading, and they knew that people 9 would get the message. they would -- smokers 10 particularly, they would rely on it. 11 it is time for the parties to admit that 12 there is much that is unknown. there was not 13 anything unknown. you heard dr. burns, there 14 was unanimity in the scientific community. no 15 one knows now a cancerous growth begins. sure, 16 they did. they do not know exactly how, but 17 they knew that cigarette smoking caused cancer. 18 of course they did. 19 okay. let us keep going. 1984. 1984, you 20 may assume the case against smoking is closed, 21 but this is far from the truth. advertising. 22 get our smokers to rely, get charlie piendle to 23 rely, because you know it is tough to quit. 24 they may be right, it may be something else. 25 maybe i do not have to quit, maybe i do not. 1 give me a crutch, give me a psychological 2 crutch. give me a reason, a self-rationale why 3 i do not have to go through withdrawal. because 4 we think reasonable people who analyze this see 5 this not as a closed case, but as an open 6 controversy. 7 and where did that language come from? 8 the pr people. we saw that. an open 9 controversy, with who? cigarette manufacturers 10 and their customers, that is who. we do not say 11 there are no questions, there is just a lot of 12 questions. 13 next one, please. 14 okay. so then we come to dr. benowitz, 15 who is the author of the 1988 surgeon general's 16 report, the one that linked addiction with 17 other drugs, addiction to nicotine with other 18 drugs. 19 and what did they say about that? we know 20 from their documents we just saw. they know 21 that they were giving doses of nicotine, that 22 it was addictive. we know that. they knew it 23 a decade, two decades ago. 24 and what are they saying? the claim by 25 the surgeon general, dr. benowitz, dr. burns, 1 dr. cummings, the claim that cigarette smoking 2 is a drug addiction similar to cocaine, heroin 3 or alcohol is irresponsible. defame, attack 4 the surgeon general, attack the medical 5 establishment, attack medicine, attack science. 6 the message to the american public, and in 7 particular, american youth, that using illegal 8 drugs like crack and heroin has the same risk 9 of addiction as smoking. to convey this 10 message is to invite disaster, disaster, and 11 trivialize a serious drug problem. 12 i mean, you know, that is the point. 13 they are good at that stuff. they were very 14 good at that stuff. and millions and millions 15 of people and millions and millions of charlie 16 piendles relied on this. because, hey, it was 17 up in the air, there was a controversy. 18 okay. let us go to the next one if we 19 could. 20 so what do they say about this 1968 21 report? the surgeon general's report is 22 shocking. it is a shockingly intemperate 23 defamation of an industry, a blue-blooded 24 american industry. they defamed us, saying 25 that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer. 1 let us go to the next one if we could. 2 so then we go all the way to 1994, a year 3 before charlie piendle is diagnosed with what is 4 going to kill him, his lung cancer. this is in 5 front of congress. they have sworn to tell the 6 truth, just like you swore your oaths as jurors 7 and just like every witness swore to tell the 8 truth in this courtroom. 9 and what do they say? 10 (thereupon, the video clip was played and 11 transcribed as follows:) 12 congressman wyden: let me begin my 13 questioning on the matter of whether or not 14 nicotine is addictive. let me ask you first, 15 and i'd like to just go down the row, whether 16 each of you believes that nicotine is not 17 addictive. i heard virtually all of you touch 18 on it. just yes or no. do you believe 19 nicotine is not addictive? 20 voice: i believe nicotine is not 21 addictive, yes. 22 congressman wyden: mr. johnston? 23 mr. johnston: congressman, cigarettes and 24 nicotine clearly do not meet the classic 25 definitions of addiction. there is no 1 intoxicants -- 2 congressman wyden: we will take that as a 3 no. and, again, time is short. if you could 4 just -- i think each of you believe nicotine is 5 not addictive, and we would just like to have this 6 for the record. 7 voice: i do not believe that nicotine or 8 our products are addictive. 9 voice: i believe nicotine is not 10 addictive. 11 voice: i believe that nicotine is not 12 addictive. 13 voice: i believe that nicotine is not 14 addictive. 15 voice: and i, too, believe that nicotine 16 is not addictive. 17 (thereupon, the video clip ended.) 18 mr. barnhart: that is a lie, it is a lie, 19 it is a lie, it is a lie, and they knew it was a 20 lie. and they lied under oath to congress and 21 they lied under oath to the american people. 22 and what did they say about cancer? 23 (thereupon, the video clip was played and 24 transcribed as follows:) 25 narrator: mr. campbell -- 1 mr. barnhart: 1994. 2 narrator: -- you were also deposed and 3 you said, quote, to my knowledge, it has not 4 been proven that cigarette smoking causes 5 cancer. this is a rather passive and pleasant 6 approach, especially in light of the consensus, 7 not by some, but all of the scientific 8 community. will you ever be convinced and what 9 evidence are you waiting for? 10 and let us have the microphone passed over. 11 mr. campbell: yes, i may be convinced. 12 we do not know what causes cancer in general 13 right now. so i think that we may find out 14 what causes cancer and we may find out some 15 relationship, which has yet to be proven. 16 (thereupon, the video clip ended.) 17 mr. barnhart: that is from the 1950s, stay 18 on the message, keep to the plan, follow the 19 game plan, keep the strategy, convince, 20 confuse, provide a psychological crutch, 21 provide a reason for self-rationale. 22 okay. another deception, and then we will 23 start going through the jury verdict form, is 24 the illusion of filtration. not my word, their 25 word. 1 now, remember, filters came up in response 2 to the 1953 cancer scare. 3 if you could show us the sales. 4 this is the illusion of filtration. it 5 comes from their documents. the illusion of 6 filtration is as important as the fact of 7 filtration. 8 why? remember the ads, clean, ivory 9 white. the illusion of filtration is that 10 people were smoking something safer, and people 11 relied on that by the millions. the illusion 12 of filtration is as important, their words, as 13 the fact -- as the fact. 14 the primary reason stated for smoking or 15 being interested in smoking filter tips are 16 reasons of health. this is their research on 17 what smokers thought. why did smokers go to 18 smoking filter tips? for reasons of health. 19 they thought it was healthy. and did tobacco, 20 and tobacco knew early on, knew that filters 21 did nothing. why? why? because the smokers 22 customize their use and because filters do not 23 take out anything that the smoker cannot 24 overcome. 25 all right. let us go to next one if we 1 could. 2 okay. so what does this say? this talks 3 about what they were proposing to do. "i have 4 observed and generally believe" -- this is 5 1953, during the cancer scare -- "that the 6 cigarette-smoking public attaches great 7 significance to the visual examination of the 8 filter material in filter-tip cigarettes." 9 this is claude teague, this is their 10 research scientist. it is proposed that 11 filter-tip material such as cotton and this and 12 that be treated so that it turns color. right? 13 they actually -- it turns out they did not adopt 14 this. but what are they looking at? they know 15 that filters do not work, they want to give the 16 illusion of filtration so people think it is 17 safer. 18 go to the next one. 19 and we know all too often that a smoker 20 who switches to a hi-fi, high-filter cigarette 21 winds up smoking more units. remember what 22 dr. burns said? remember what dr. cummings 23 said? this is 1961, early 1961. all too often 24 a smoker who switches to a high-filter 25 cigarette winds up smoking more units, 1 scientific precision, in order to provide 2 himself with the same delivery which he had 3 before. they titrate, the smoker does, 4 unconsciously, subconsciously, to get the 5 nicotine and the tar that they need. they suck 6 it in, they smoke more, they inhale more 7 deeply, they smoke more cigarettes, they puff 8 more often. in short, i do not believe the 9 smoking pattern has changed much, even with the 10 cancer scares and filtered cigarettes. 1961. 11 next one, please. 12 okay. so what happens is dr. burns says, 13 right after that, sales went right back up. 14 introduction of filters before the 1950s, less 15 than 1 percent of the cigarettes sold in the 16 united states were filtered. after that, sales 17 zoomed. 18 are you with me? okay. all right. 19 so what happens is smokers compensate, as 20 they say. they customize their use, they smoke 21 more. the industry knew this. and, you know, 22 it is interesting, what dr. burns said is the 23 medical community denied, and this is one area 24 where it said, unfortunately, the medical 25 community did not, and why? because the 1 cigarette smoker, the cigarette research 2 departments used real people. they watched 3 smokers. the medical community used smoking 4 machines, so they just measured a draw through 5 a filter. and they thought the filters 6 actually helped. so the scientific community 7 actually helped that out. and they did not find 8 out about it until they did the research that 9 tobacco did and used real smokers and found out 10 that people compensate, that they suck in more, 11 that they inhale more deeply. 12 filters deceived people for 60 years and 13 are still deceiving smokers. you heard their 14 expert, tobacco's -- well, he is an employee, 15 the nonmedical doctor, dr. figlar, and he said 16 every product that charlie piendle smoked from 17 the time he started until the time he quit was 18 equally hazardous to his health. all their 19 changes have not done a doggone thing to make 20 cigarettes less hazardous. they are still 21 hazardous, they still kill, and all these 22 filters do is provide an illusion of safety. 23 okay. so did they cause people to rely? 24 of course, they did. they spent billions of 25 dollars, and you can advertise, but you cannot 1 mislead people, you cannot deceive people. 2 it is okay to advertise, but you cannot lie to 3 them. 4 what do they say? it is safe, it is 5 unproven, it is filtered. you can quit. it is a 6 choice. it is just a choice. and that is what 7 smokers want to hear. nonsmokers are different 8 things. remember dr. cummings told us about 9 that? 10 but smokers get reassurance, and that is, 11 remember, going back to their documents, we 12 want to reassure them deep in their biological 13 depths, we want to pooh-pooh any fears they 14 have. 1953. reassure them, provide the 15 rationale, give them a reason to rely to keep 16 smoking, to start smoking, because otherwise we 17 will not sell enough. 18 so why did tobacco do this? well, you-all 19 did not fall off the turnip truck. they did it 20 to make money. and there is nothing wrong with 21 making money, that is the american way. what is 22 wrong about making money is if you make money 23 deceitfully, if you lie, if you conceal, and if 24 you kill people, and you know you are doing it, 25 and you attack the surgeon general, who is 1 trying to protect people, and you attack the 2 medical establishment, that is not right, and 3 that is why you are here. 4 they deceived their customers for money, 5 they killed people for money. they did not go 6 out and shoot them, but they knew they were 7 killing people. they put profits over safety. 8 they put business ahead of the health of 9 mothers and fathers and girls and boys and 10 grandmothers and grandfathers and aunts and 11 uncles and everybody who smoked. 12 so did this coverup make a difference to 13 charlie piendle? the defense will say, hey, we 14 never heard charlie piendle say, "i want to sue 15 somebody." look, if it did not matter to 16 charlie piendle, it did not matter to america. 17 it did not matter to anyone. 18 why? charlie smoked the most advertised 19 brands of his time, the most -- the most 20 popular ones, lucky strikes. they tried 21 camels, but you heard babe, they did not like 22 them, they were too strong. marlboro, winston. 23 he followed the typical prototype of kids his 24 age. he smoked what they smoked. 25 did he rely on it? you better believe it. 1 there was a billboard across the street, the 2 marlboro man, right there across the street 3 from where they bought cigarettes. babe says, 4 "we all wanted to be the marlboro man." indeed 5 they did, indeed they did. 6 they targeted kids, they targeted 7 teenagers. that was their market. you are 8 going to see a bunch of documents in just a 9 minute. it was cool, it was sexy, it was 10 sophisticated, it was the thing to do. that 11 was their market. you saw those letters to the 12 teachers, the principals, actually the 13 students. they made it hard to quit. they 14 made it hard -- they made it easy to start 15 again. 16 you know what dr. burns said, they studied 17 it, they studied it. and subconscious reliance 18 is still reliance, give them a psychological 19 crutch, let them -- let them deny, give them 20 reassurance. that is what they did. of course 21 charlie relied on it. 22 okay. so what is tobacco's excuse? he 23 never said he wanted to sue anybody. i mean, 24 can you imagine this conversation? "well, 25 honey, how are you doing?" 1 "well, you know, i feel like suing tobacco 2 today." 3 that just did not happen, and why? he 4 never knew what they knew. all of the 5 documents that you now know about did not even 6 surface until the engle case and other cases 7 came forward. he did not know what they knew 8 about cancer. he did not know what they knew 9 about addiction. 10 and their plan, the plan they hatched and 11 carried out for 50 years, lasted all the way 12 through charlie piendle's life. he died before 13 it was uncovered. it took courts, it took 14 lawsuits to get these documents out. i mean, 15 these documents were not produced voluntarily 16 by tobacco. they came out of the surgeon -- 17 out of attorney's general suing, out of 18 lawsuits, out of judges telling them, you got 19 to produce your documents. 20 mr. kelly: objection, your honor. that is 21 way beyond the scope of any evidence in this 22 case. 23 the court: i'll sustain. 24 mr. barnhart: not at all. dr. cummings 25 testified about it. 1 the court: i'll sustain the objection. 2 mr. barnhart: then they say, hey, 3 everybody knew. everybody knew smoking was 4 bad. well, everybody -- everybody did not 5 know. people who do not smoke, yes, they knew 6 after a while, after they were addicted. we 7 knew charlie wanted to quit. we know that 80 8 to ninety percent of the people wanted to quit, but 9 by then it is too late. 10 and then they say, "hey, charlie should 11 have known what we knew. charlie should have 12 known what we covered up." i think you will find 13 the evidence is just -- that cannot be. 14 okay. so what did they do? they called 15 an economist from las vegas to testify about 16 polling, go figure. and what did she admit, 17 hey, there is a big difference between belief 18 and awareness in polls. 99.9 percent of the 19 people are aware of ufos, but a small fraction 20 believe in them. there is a huge difference in 21 misreading a poll. 22 in 1954, one of the polls she showed, 23 50 -- there were no kids. remember, charlie 24 was a kid. he just started smoking. 58 25 percent of the adults either did not believe 1 that smoking caused lung cancer or did not know. 2 she ignored the conclusions of the surgeon 3 general's reports. that is a common thread, 4 is not it? ignore the surgeon general's 5 reports. 6 she said under cross-examination, you 7 know, smokers do respond differently to poll 8 questions. smokers tend not to believe. why? 9 reliance, psychological crutch, self-denial. 10 the clerk: counselor, 30 minutes. 11 mr. barnhart: thank you. 12 she relied on these ogg studies, but she 13 disagreed with the conclusions. she relied on 14 a study paid by rjr lawyers, the jones day 15 firm. i'm not talking about these lawyers over 16 here, but a national law firm that underwrote 17 one of their studies. and she admitted that 18 teens do not understand the risks and they 19 regret smoking. 20 then they called a historian, dr. norrell. 21 he is been made a millionaire, or almost, by 22 tobacco. what is his field? american history, 23 not tobacco. he never published a doggone 24 thing on tobacco. his interest was in 25 testifying. 1 you know what he did, he showed articles 2 with no connection to charlie piendle. 3 articles from hartford, not bridgeport. 4 articles from jacksonville and orlando. the 5 reader's digest. the piendles did not read the 6 reader's digest and a kid did not read it, he 7 read sports illustrated and national 8 geographic. and he only showed one side, we 9 saw that when he was being cross-examined. he 10 ignored industry articles, he ignored industry 11 statements, he ignored the billions of ads, he 12 ignored harmful evidence. 13 and then finally has this business about 14 charlie's schools, charlie took a course in 15 health. and then we saw on his grade card he 16 did not take a course in health. well, then he 17 took it in gym. 18 lucille, his best friend, said, "i never 19 did that. i was in the same class as him." 20 probably not the same gym class, but same 21 class. "we never took a health course on 22 smoking." i mean, who are they trying to kid? 23 and then, finally, teens should have known 24 that tobacco was lying. 25 okay. so let me work through this very 1 quickly. was charlie piendle addicted to 2 cigarettes? there is no evidence to the 3 contrary, yes. 4 were the cigarettes placed on the market 5 by rjr a legal cause of his death? yes. 6 were the cigarettes placed on the market 7 by philip morris a legal cause of his death? 8 yes. 9 did he rely to his detriment on omissions, 10 concealment, omissions of material fact, of 11 failure to disclose things? did he rely on 12 tobacco's lies and public relations campaign? 13 that is the answer, that is the question. yes. 14 the evidence is overwhelming. 15 did he rely to his detriment on philip 16 morris's, their campaign, their strategy, the 17 things they did to get him to rely, the 18 statements they made? of course he had, it was 19 his culture. it was all over. drum, drum, 20 drum, beat, beat, beat. all the smokers did, 21 yes. 22 now, look, if we have to prove that 23 charlie piendle read a particular ad and have 24 liz remember it from 20 years ago, no smoker 25 could ever win. but that is not the law, that is 1 not the law. 2 was any act taken in furtherance of an 3 agreement, the conspiracy? we saw that, we 4 just worked through it. yes. 5 and did they do it with an intention that 6 smokers and the public would rely on this 7 information? they spent billions and billions 8 and billions of dollars. of course they wanted 9 to. they say no, nobody relied on it. why 10 then spend billions and billions and billions 11 of dollars on a worthless task? because you 12 know what, they are not dumb business people. 13 they do not do worthless things in terms of 14 spending their dollars. of course they did. 15 yes. 16 were they negligent? you have already seen 17 that. 18 and then was negligence a legal cause of 19 charlie's death? i submit to you the answer is 20 yes. 21 all right. so we are up to speed, and i'm 22 going to jump over these things and rely on 23 your memory. 24 we come to dr. figlar. dr. figlar was -- 25 i believe he is a chemist, and here's what he 1 said. dr. figlar. they had the capacity to 2 reduce tar and cigarettes and they did not. 3 they sold some cigarettes with 19 times the tar 4 that was the cancer-causing agent than others, 5 and all the cigarettes that charlie smoked were 6 hazardous, every single one, despite all this 7 filtration and this and that, poking holes in 8 the cigarette. 9 that brings us to percentages of fault. 10 and what is the percentage of fault? this is 11 this question right here. you-all will be 12 asked to determine the percentage of fault that 13 will cause charlie's death. and we have 14 admitted, charlie has admitted that charlie was 15 at fault. so some percentage is going to go on 16 charlie. 17 and what does it do? let us take a verdict 18 for $100. if you find charlie piendle 19 5 percent or ten percent at fault, charlie would 20 get $95 or $90. that is the effect of that. 21 you are not supposed to make any reductions, 22 judge rosenberg does that. 23 so i suggest to you this: you have got to 24 consider the time he started, the environment 25 created by tobacco, the massive campaign to 6884 1 target teenagers, the immature teenage brain, 2 the fact that teenagers are more susceptible to 3 addiction, and the fact that cigarettes back 4 then had two or three times the amount of 5 nicotine than they do now. 6 and what did dr. burns or cummings say? 7 teens do not make informed decisions. so in 8 terms of fault, that is something to consider 9 strongly. why? because they feel immortal, 10 they do not understand addiction, their brain 11 changes. 12 let us compare doctors in 1964. remember 13 the 1964 report, you saw the tv, and we are 14 going to go very quickly through that, because 15 we are running out of time. 16 compare charlie -- these are doctors. 17 charlie had a high school education. 18 (thereupon, the video clip was played and 19 transcribed as follows:) 20 mr. reasoner: . . . industry's spokesmen 21 and anti-cigarette crusaders alike -- 22 mr. barnhart: these are the men at the 23 top of their field. 24 mr. reasoner: -- the committee finally 25 assembled -- 1 mr. barnhart: they are like dr. benowitz. 2 they are like dr. burns. 3 mr. reasoner: -- some 14 months ago. 4 these men, each an expert in his field -- 5 mr. barnhart: the cream of the crop the 6 best of the best -- 7 mr. reasoner: -- were brought together 8 from different parts of the country and from 9 different fields of science -- 10 mr. barnhart: -- and they studied it for 11 13, 14, 15 months. 12 mr. reasoner: -- dr. walter burdette, 13 surgery, university of utah. dr. john b. 14 hickman, internal medicine, indiana, nonsmoker. 15 dr. emmanuel farber, pathology, pittsburgh, 16 nonsmoker. dr. stanhope bayne-jones, j.l. 17 school of medicine, nonsmoker. dr. leonard m. 18 schuman, public health, minnesota, cigarette 19 smoker. dr. charles lemaistre, preventative 20 medicine, texas, pipe smoker. professor 21 william g. cochran, statistics, harvard, 22 cigarette smoker. professor lewis g. fieser, 23 chemistry, harvard, cigarettes and pipe . . . 24 (thereupon, the video clip was stopped.) 25 mr. barnhart: that is enough. 1 you compare what those learned men knew 2 who had studied it, and a number of them, i 3 cannot remember what it was, 25, forty percent of 4 them, i cannot remember, were still smoking when 5 they announced the '64 surgeon general's 6 report. 7 and compare the journalists we saw, 8 learned men, men who had reported on this story 9 since the cancer scare began, men who reported 10 on the 1964 surgeon general's report. edward 11 r. murrow, dead of lung cancer, an addict. 12 harry reasoner, dead of lung cancer, unable to 13 stop. peter jennings, charlie's age, dead of 14 lung cancer, unable to stop. 15 so when we compare all that -- let us 16 compare charlie piendle. yes, he was at fault, 17 he should not have started smoking. i suggest 18 to you that 5 to ten percent is reasonable. and 19 for philip morris and rjr, you determine that. 20 45, 45, 47, 5, whatever it is, you determine 21 and you fill that in. 22 that brings us to damages. 23 and judge, this is a good time to take a 24 break. 17 closing argument 18 ms. baker-barnes: good morning, ladies 19 and gentlemen. 20 when greg started this morning some time 21 ago, he told you that you have immense power, 22 and you do, you have a tremendous power in this 23 case to make it right, to make it right for liz 24 piendle, and to measure all of the damage and 25 all of the harm that she has suffered and that 1 she continues to suffer every day, and she 2 suffered a tremendous harm. she suffered a 3 tremendous loss. she lost a great man. greg 4 said he was a fine man, he was a great man. 5 he served his country until his body 6 would not let him anymore and he never 7 complained, not one complaint. when his father 8 died in front of him, right in front of him and 9 right in front of his brother, he stood up and 10 became the father, he stood up and became the 11 man. and you heard from eddie, you heard from 12 his brother eddie piendle, he said he was my 13 brother, he was my father, he was my best 14 friend, he was my everything. and he was not 15 everything to just eddie, he was everything to 16 everybody who ever met him. 17 babe cabral, his best friend from grammar 18 school, came in. he told you charlie was my 19 best friend 50 years, 50 years, he was my best 20 friend. you heard from lucille worobel, met 21 freshman year in high school, he was my best 22 friend. everybody who met this man, everybody 23 whose life he touched, he was my best friend. 24 and for liz, after all that she has been 25 through, at such a young age her husband is 1 swept away at sea, she is got a three-month old 2 baby, and charlie comes in and he makes it all 3 better. he fell in love with her, he made her 4 smile again, he made her laugh again, and alan 5 was not her son -- he was not my stepson, he was 6 charlie's son, charlie's son. 7 they read you portions of alan's 8 deposition and what did alan say? what did you 9 call mr. piendle, what did you call him? i 10 called him dad. he was my dad. and they built 11 a beautiful life together, a life filled with 12 family and friends and love and support, 13 support for charlie through his many obstacles. 14 we know he had crohn's disease and there were 15 times when it was so difficult. three months 16 in the hospital, he got last rights twice and 17 almost died, and liz was right there, right 18 there with him every step of the way, for 27 19 years. 20 and yes, they had some bumps and bruises 21 along the way, as we all do, but what did liz 22 tell you? it made us stronger, it only made us 23 stronger, it only made us love each other more, 24 it only made that bond so much deeper. 25 and members of the jury, they had a 1 beautiful life together raising their family 2 and raising their children and they got to that 3 stage where it was their time. and you heard 4 about the motorcycles and you heard liz tell 5 you that when charlie rode those motorcycles, 6 he felt free. she did not know if he was going 7 to be able to do it, i did not know physically 8 if he would be able to do it, but he did it and 9 he felt free. and she told you and lucille 10 told you it was the best time of his life. and 11 they had dreams, they had dreams to travel this 12 country together, to travel the world together, 13 to grow old together, and those dreams were 14 shattered when charlie got lung cancer. they 15 were shattered and they were cut short, and 16 they were never realized. 17 and who was right there with charlie every 18 step of the way? because he was a fighter. 19 you heard it from both of them, charlie was a 20 fighter. he was a marine, and he fought a 21 valiant battle against cancer, a valiant 22 battle, but it was too much. it spread 23 everywhere. it spread from his lungs to his 24 brain. it took over his body. it did not take 25 over his soul, but it took over his body, and 1 liz was right there with him every step of the 2 way. 3 and there came a time when charlie and liz 4 and everybody realized that the end was near 5 and they took that last trip to connecticut. 6 and you heard about it from eddie, he threw a 7 party with hundreds of family and friends and 8 who was there, lucille was, babe was there, 9 eddie was there, liz was there, their whole 10 family was there, to say we love you, charlie, 11 we want to tell you while you are still here, 12 not after you are gone, we love you. 13 and that plane ride home. and liz is the 14 only one that can tell you what happened on 15 that plane, the only one, she is right there, 16 four stops, three stops to get gas to refuel, 17 and every time they stopped, they did not know 18 if he was going to make it. i do not know if 19 you are going to make it, charlie, but hold on 20 for your kids, i want you to make it home to 21 see your kids. and he did. he made it because 22 that was charlie. he made it. and what did he 23 say when he got off that plane and liz was 24 right there, where is my baby girl? i just 25 want to see my baby girl, and then he was gone. 6901 1 after 27 years, he was gone. and family 2 was there, liz told you, for a while, and 3 friends were there for a while, but there comes 4 a time when everybody is gone. and that time 5 came for liz and she went back home to the 6 house they built with their hands and they 7 lived in for 15 years. 8 and what did she tell you? it was eerily 9 quiet, dead quiet, and for the first time since 10 i was 17 years old, i was scared and i was 11 alone and i was afraid, and for 14 years, for 12 14 years, every second, every minute, every 13 hour, every day, every month, every year, she 14 misses charlie, every day she misses charlie. 15 she watches her granddaughter growing up 16 without her grandfather and she misses charlie. 17 they have christmas holidays and celebrations 18 and she misses charlie. she wakes up in the 19 morning and walks out her front door, she 20 misses charlie. 21 and yes, she is dated. the defense has 22 brought that to your attention and made it very 23 clear, she is tried, she absolutely has, she is 24 tried to move on, she is tried to continue with 25 her life, but you know what, none of it worked 1 out, none of it. 2 jorge, she told you about jorge. they 3 asked her directly, how long did you date him, 4 when did you meet him? she told them 5 everything they wanted to know about jorge and 6 everything they wanted to know about anybody 7 else that she dated and she told them, but you 8 know what, she never met another charlie. 9 jorge was a nice man, but he was not charlie. 10 jerry was a nice man, but he was not charlie. 11 and every day, every day she lived without him. 12 so what is it worth? what is it worth to 13 live your life, to have 23 years -- and 14 judge rosenberg has instructed you that that is 15 the time they had, those were their golden 16 years, those were supposed to be the best time 17 of their lives -- 23 years cut short by the 18 defendants in this case? 19 so what is it worth? you heard 20 dr. norrell come to you and come in here and 21 tell you that he is made over a million dollars 22 to come in here and show you some newspaper 23 clips and magazine articles and tv clips, a 24 million dollars. what is it worth to live 25 every day without your soulmate? 1 mr. kelly: your honor, that is an improper 2 argument. comparative valuations are not 3 permitted. 4 ms. baker-barnes: it is a perfectly 5 reasonable argument, your honor. 6 the court: i'll overrule. you may 7 proceed. 8 ms. baker-barnes: what is the value of 9 the time that she would have had with the love 10 of her life, the man who made it all better, 11 the man who took away all her pain? 12 i would submit to you, members of the 13 jury, we would submit to you that you take it 14 one year at time, one year at time and think 15 about every second, every minute, every hour of 16 every day that she has to spend missing not a 17 good man, not an okay man, but a fine man, a 18 great man. and you take that number, whatever 19 it is, is it $500,000 year, is it the million 20 dollars they pay dr. norrell to come in here 21 and show you some newspaper clips, whatever 22 that number is, you take it and multiply it 23 times 23, every year that she has to live 24 without charlie piendle. 25 and you are going to get instructions in 1 this case that you should not base your 2 decision on sympathy, and you should not, and 3 margaret piendle does not want your sympathy, 4 she does not want you to feel sorry for her, 5 she is here for justice in this case. 6 the clerk: counsel, ten minutes left. 7 ms. baker-barnes: she is here for justice. 8 and justice, a just verdict that measures all 9 of the harm caused to liz piendle by the death 10 of what everyone described, everyone who came 11 in this courtroom as a great man, a great man. 12 closing argument 13 mr. barnhart: thank you. 14 we are almost finished. i know it is been 15 hard and i know it is been long, but it is a 16 month-long trial, and we have covered -- in most 17 cases you end at the losses, but this is not 18 such a case. you are called upon not only to 19 view the losses and conduct, but whether or not 20 these corporations should be punished for what 21 they did. it has nothing to do with 22 compensating liz piendle, it has nothing to do 23 with that. it has to do with deterrents and 24 punishment and setting an example, and the law 25 on that -- 1 could we have that law? i'll tell you 2 what, it is right here. no, it is not. 3 mr. kelly: you are blocking it. 4 mr. barnhart: oh, no wonder. give me 5 that extra minute for screwing up. 6 so what happened is, it is any one of 7 these, either/or, either/or, either/or, the 8 conduct causing the loss -- excuse me -- to the 9 plaintiff is so gross and flagrant as to show a 10 reckless disregard of human life or safety. 11 the conduct showed such an entire lack of care 12 that the defendant must have been consciously 13 indifferent. they did not care, they did not 14 give a hoot who they hurt. the conduct showed 15 such an entire lack of care that the defendant 16 must have wantonly or recklessly disregarded 17 the safety and the welfare of the public. 18 well, is not that us, disregarding the 19 safety and the welfare of the public, or their 20 all-mighty treasury. the conduct showed such a 21 reckless indifference to the rights of others 22 as to be equivalent to an intentional violation 23 of those rights. 24 i'm not going to go through the evidence 25 again, but you know what you have seen. there 1 was a clear, deliberate conspiracy, a clear, 2 deliberate plan, and they called it that, and 3 they carried it on for 50 years, for 50 years 4 of kids getting hooked, of people dying, people 5 getting lung cancer and keeping people smoking. 6 so what do we have to show to you? we 7 have to show to you by clear and convincing 8 evidence -- and, boy, if this is not clear and 9 convincing, i do not know what evidence is -- 10 that there was a violation of what, the public 11 trust, of the trust that society has with 12 either individuals or corporations to do the 13 right thing, to do what is right and not do 14 what is wrong and not deliberately mislead 15 people and not carry on a plan, not hatch a 16 plan to keep people in the dark, do not attack 17 the surgeon general, do not attack science, 18 do not cover it up, do not give people a 19 psychological crutch. 20 so if you do find, if you do answer that, 21 yes, there was a violation, and yes, there 22 should be punitive damages assessed against the 23 defendants, then there would be phase ii of the 24 case, and that will be brief, we will not have any 25 evidence. 1 mr. kelly: objection, your honor. that is 2 improper argument. 3 mr. barnhart: not at all. not at all, 4 your honor. 5 the court: on the basis of what? 6 mr. kelly: there is no suggestion that is 7 going to be brief or long or what the evidence 8 is going to be. 9 the court: i'll sustain that. 10 mr. barnhart: there will be a phase after 11 this where evidence will come in about net 12 worth and whatever the defense wants to do. we 13 will call no witnesses. 14 and by way of apology, i would ask that 15 you not say no just so you can get out of here, 16 because this is a very, very important case, 17 and your mission is very important. 18 all right. so what did they do? you know 19 what they did, they covered up, they deceived 20 about cancer, addiction, they conspired for 21 50 years, they kept millions of people smoking. 22 they hooked millions of kids, they targeted 23 children. 24 and now let us see the actual targets. and 25 you have seen them here. okay. first go back, 1 1973. excuse me. again, mr. teague, research 2 scientist. what do we want? we want to show 3 adventuresome, adventurous, sophisticated adult 4 images, smoking may enhance one's self-image if 5 one values certain characteristics in specific 6 individuals or certain types, like movie stars, 7 like athletes. then if one also smokes, he is 8 psychologically a little more like that valued 9 image. like frank gifford, or like if you are a 10 girl, like the woman who was singing, like 11 somebody famous, like somebody cool, like 12 somebody sexy. 13 this self-image enhancement effect has 14 traditionally been a strong promotional theme 15 for cigarette brands and should be continued to 16 be emphasized. continued to be emphasized. 17 let us go to the next one if we could. 18 realistically, if our company is to 19 survive, 1973, we must get our share of the 20 youth market. same kind of language, 21 self-enhancement, the fragile developing 22 self-image of the young person needs all of the 23 support and enhancement it can get. 24 so what are we going to do? we are going 25 to support the young person, we are going to 1 enhance their image with cigarettes, with the 2 marlboro man. and we know all the time that 3 we are selling products that are addictive and 4 that kill people. 5 next one if we could. 6 again, another rjr document. younger 7 adult smokers, that is their language, have been 8 the critical factor in the growth and decline 9 of every major brand and company over the last 10 50 years. and you know what we heard, they are 11 brand loyal. start with marlboro, you tend to 12 stick with marlboro. you start with winstons, 13 you tended to stick with winstons. 14 all right. so what did they do with kids? 15 we know this. 16 if you could. 17 you guys heard this -- well, here's 18 another one. this is talking about high school 19 students, about camel and winston are holding 20 their shares, salem is increasing among high 21 school students. those are not adult smokers, 22 they are kids, they are kids. just like charlie 23 piendle. how are we doing businesswise with 24 high school kids, with the charlie piendles of 25 the world? 1 all right. so you saw those two letters 2 in evidence. it is shocking, really. "dear 3 students" is the first one from 1963. "dear 4 students, despite many years of extensive 5 research, medical science has been unable to 6 establish that smoking has a direct causal link 7 with any human disease." 8 we know they knew that was not true, and 9 they are writing to kids, elementary school 10 kids, i believe it was in this case, your 11 memory will serve you better than mine. 12 "we are firmly of the opinion that there is 13 unanswered questions. our company intends, 14 therefore, to continue to support such 15 research." 16 the only thing they did not do is send free 17 samples to these kids. 18 "dear students, medical science has been 19 unable to establish." 20 their science did, and they knew it. 21 "dear principal." 1990. 1990. "in spite 22 of all the research going on, the simple and 23 unfortunate fact is that scientists do not know 24 the causes, the cause or causes of chronic 25 diseases associated with cigarette smoking." 1 come on, who are they kidding? that was a 2 blatant misstatement, and they knew it. 3 "we appreciate" -- oh, this is the best 4 part. "we appreciate you passing this 5 information, ms. principal, on to your 6 students." 7 so where does that leave us? the evidence 8 is overwhelming, overwhelming. and you do need 9 to be convinced by clear and convincing 10 evidence. the evidence is overwhelming that 11 the actions here were reckless, they acted in 12 reckless disregard of the health and welfare of 13 the citizens of the united states, and 14 particularly their smoking customers like 15 charlie piendle. 16 so what did they do, they targeted 17 children. we are in the business of selling 18 nicotine, an addicting drug. we incorporate 19 chemicals, the filter tip, the fragile 20 developing image of the young person, build it 21 up. you cannot be comfortable with selling a 22 product which most of our customers would stop 23 using if they could. 24 the amount of evidence to indict cigarette 25 smoking as a health hazard -- that was years 1 before they wrote those letters -- is 2 overwhelming. the evidence challenging this 3 indictment is scam. 4 to the successful defense of our present 5 and future suits, you heard that in 6 cross-examination. they removed files, you 7 heard that in the cross-examination of 8 dr. figlar. carcinogens are found in 9 practically every class of compounds in smoke. 10 happily, nicotine is both and habituating and 11 unique. think of a cigarette dispenser as a 12 dose for nicotine. you have seen every one of 13 these documents or heard about them. 14 the clerk: counselor, you have two 15 minutes. 16 mr. barnhart: thank you. give me an 17 extra five if you would. 18 compounds, it is always been a holding 19 strategy of creating doubt. the illusion of 20 filtration is more important. no one has ever 21 became a cigarette smoker by smoking cigarettes 22 without nicotine. 23 boy, they sure are right there, they hit 24 the nail on the head. 25 a cigarette that does not deliver nicotine 1 cannot satisfy, it will give our smokers a 2 psychological crutch, and on, and on, and on. 3 and when you weigh the evidence just like 4 we have done in the scales of justice, i submit 5 to you there is only one conclusion. this is 6 wanton conduct, this is reckless conduct, this 7 is complete disregard of the health and the 8 safety of their customers like charlie piendle. 9 okay. so did philip morris and rjr, 10 before 2000, 2001, ever admit that they were 11 addicting and killing people? no. 12 like dr. farone, remember the short little 13 clip from dr. farone, he was a research 14 scientist at philip morris, i believe he worked 15 there for eight years -- 16 oh, yeah. that would help. 17 (thereupon, the video clip was played and 18 transcribed as follows:) 19 q. good morning, dr. farone. 20 a. good morning. 21 q. would you please introduce yourself to the 22 jury? 23 a. my name is william anthony farone, 24 f-a-r-o-n-e. 25 q. and you worked for philip morris for a 1 time, dr. farone? 2 a. i did. 3 q. and how long did you work for philip 4 morris? 5 a. for eight years. 6 q. did philip morris, during that same period 7 of time, refuse to share what it knew with public 8 health authorities, all that it knew with public 9 health authorities regarding the risks of smoking? 10 a. yes. 11 q. so when the surgeon general said that 12 smoking was harmful to health, during your time at 13 philip morris, did philip morris ever step up on the 14 podium with the surgeon general and say, we agree, 15 we should work together to reduce the harms 16 associated with smoking? 17 a. no, they did not. 18 q. did philip morris make a public commitment 19 to join together with the surgeon general to share 20 all that it knew on addiction and health risks of 21 smoking in order to reduce those risks? 22 a. no, they did not. 23 (thereupon, the video clip ended.) 24 mr. barnhart: and neither did rjr, they 25 never did, they never did what they said they 1 were going to do with that frank statement, 2 join arms with the surgeon general to find out 3 the causes of smoking-related diseases, they 4 did not to it. 5 all right. so what had they done, what 6 did they do? they deny, they deny, they deny. 7 they deny in this trial, they continue on, 8 deny, deny, deny, obfuscate, obfuscate, 9 obfuscate, cover up, cover up, cover up, and 10 blame the smoker, blame the smoker. 11 folks, this is the day, this is the 12 courtroom where you should say no more. on 13 this day in this courtroom, we will not stand 14 for it one time longer, and that really is your 15 mission. 16 there was a 16th century poet named john 17 donne, he wrote, "no man is an island." he 18 wrote during the great plague in england. and 19 he said, "never ask for whom the bell tolls, it 20 tolls for thee." 21 and by your verdict, you should make that 22 verdict ring. you should make that bell toll 23 in richmond, virginia, in the corporate offices 24 of these corporations, so that they understand 25 that this conduct will not be commons. 1 mr. kelly: objection, your honor. it is 2 improper comment in this phase. 3 mr. barnhart: it is punitive damages. 4 the court: overruled. 5 mr. barnhart: your verdict should speak 6 the truth, and it should deter them and punish 7 them for what they did. 8 thank you very much. thank you, 9 your honor. 7092 closing argument 12 mr. scarola: thank you very much, 13 your honor. 14 may it please the court, counsel, 15 cocounsel, liz, and ladies and gentlemen of the 16 jury. 17 you have made extraordinary sacrifices, 18 for which i join every lawyer that has 19 addressed you and thank you. perhaps, some 20 day, if our paths cross outside this courtroom, 21 i'll be able to spend the time, regardless of 22 what your verdict may be, to appropriately 23 express that thanks. for now, my 24 responsibility is to liz and require that i 25 move on very quickly to talk about this case. 1 defense counsel drew an analogy to a 2 jigsaw puzzle, and, indeed, the trial of a 3 civil lawsuit is very much like assembling a 4 jigsaw puzzle. around my house, with 13 5 grandchildren and five granddogs running 6 around, jigsaw puzzles do not last very long. 7 they get opened up and maybe they get put 8 together once, frequently they never even make 9 it that far, pieces get lost under the couch, 10 pieces disappear and cannot be found anywhere, 11 babies chew on pieces, dogs chew on pieces, the 12 cover picture gets torn off pieces, and this 13 jigsaw puzzle is not unlike that. it is a 14 jigsaw puzzle that, in many respects, is more 15 than half a century old. 16 the pieces began to be assembled in some 17 circumstances back in the early 1900s. through 18 the frailty of the human body, people die, 19 charlie piendle died, the pieces of the puzzle 20 that he possessed left with it. through the 21 fallibility of human memory, people with the 22 very best of intentions do not remember 23 accurately and pieces get damaged. through the 24 defects in human integrity, sometimes pieces 25 get intentionally destroyed. 1 this is a document that was marked for 2 identification, and we dealt with a portion of 3 it during the course of the plaintiff's 4 presentation. it is dated december 18, 1969 5 from mr. max crohn (phonetic) of the legal 6 department, and it is a memo regarding 7 invalidation of some reports in the research 8 department. 9 what does mr. crohn tell his tobacco 10 industry bosses? we do not foresee any 11 difficulty in the event a decision is reached 12 to remove certain reports from research files. 13 once it becomes clear that such action is 14 necessary for the successful defense of our 15 present and future suits, we will promptly 16 remove all such reports from our files. 17 we invalidate about 15 reports each year 18 for various reasons. the most common reasons 19 for invalidating a report and/or requiring 20 rewriting are confidentiality of content, and 21 several miscellaneous reasons. we can cite 22 misinterpretation of as data -- excuse me, of 23 data as a reason for invalidation. as an 24 alternative to invalidation, we can have the 25 authors rewrite those sections of the reports 1 which appear objectionable. 15 reports per 2 year, for the 30 years that charlie piendle was 3 a smoker. 450 reports intentionally removed 4 from the historical record in anticipation of 5 avoiding litigation problems, countless other 6 reports rewritten in anticipation of avoiding 7 litigation problems. 8 and so what we are left with in assembling 9 this jigsaw puzzle are the fragments that 10 remained, that escaped the intentional effort 11 to cleanse the record of damaging evidence, but 12 that is not unusual. people who do bad things 13 do everything they can to avoid being held 14 responsible for the bad things they do. 15 and if our efforts were to stop because 16 this puzzle has been damaged, if they were to 17 stop because charlie piendle was killed by 18 addiction to cigarettes, if they were to stop 19 because we do not have every document in the 20 historic record, justice could not be done and 21 so we must deal with the evidence that is 22 available and the standard that does not 23 require proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but 24 proof by the greater weight of the evidence. 25 we must construct the best picture that can be 1 constructed from the evidence that is available 2 and deal with the probabilities. 3 now, sometimes those probabilities are in 4 the form of statistics. and as opposing 5 counsel has pointed out, where there is direct 6 evidence, we need not rely on statistics. the 7 fact that eighty percent of smokers do not get lung 8 cancer, they get copd, they die of emphysema, 9 they die of heart problems, they die of a whole 10 lot of other reasons, but only twenty percent get 11 lung cancer. it does not mean that it is not 12 probable that charlie piendle got lung cancer, 13 because the direct evidence establishes that 14 charlie piendle died of smoking-related lung 15 cancer, by stipulation. it was so 16 overwhelming, so compelling that the defendants 17 have not contested the fact that charlie 18 piendle died because he contracted cancer of 19 the lung from 30 years of smoking. 20 i want to begin with an overview of the 21 defense case because, in effect, what they have 22 told us is we manufactured lies. we presented 23 smoking as sexy, sophisticated, safe, a safe 24 source of relaxation, a safe means by which to 25 relieve stress, and that was a lie. but they 7097 1 tell us it was charlie's choice to be stupid 2 enough to believe us. it is his fault that he 3 believed what we were telling charlie and 4 telling everybody else for decades. you can 5 smoke and it is safe because it has not been 6 established that smoking causes cancer. we 7 spent tens and hundreds of millions of dollars 8 every year advertising our lies, but pieces of 9 the truth must have penetrated into charlie's 10 information environment, he must have learned 11 the truth in spite of our lies, so it was 12 charlie's choice to be stupid enough to believe 13 the lies we advertised, to believe the lies we 14 told in full-page ads, in newspapers, in every 15 city with a population of 250,000 or more 16 across the united states. you had to be stupid 17 to believe us. it was charlie's choice, 18 charlie's stupid choice to be influenced by 19 that information in the environment. 20 we promoted the lies through front 21 organizations and even paid the ama $10 million 22 for research at the same time the ama agreed 23 not to support package warnings. do not need 24 warnings on cigarettes, everybody knows. you 25 can shout it from the rooftops and you will not be 1 telling anybody what they do not already know. 2 but as we now know, there is such a big 3 difference between knowing and believing and 4 that is a distinction that the defendants knew, 5 took calculated advantage of, and profited on 6 at the expense of hundreds of thousands of 7 deaths every year. 8 the public health officials, like the 9 surgeon general, they were telling the truth 10 and charlie had a choice as to who to believe. 11 do not blame us because he was stupid enough to 12 believe us. does that really make sense? we 13 denied the lies for 50 years. but charlie had 14 a choice because we were forced to put warning 15 labels on cigarette packages. 16 remember the television interview of the 17 tobacco executive from these defendants who 18 stood up there and said, oh, yeah, the warnings 19 are on cigarettes, it says they may be 20 hazardous to your health. that does not mean 21 they are hazardous to your health, and we 22 certainly do not believe they are hazardous to 23 your health. those warning do not mean 24 anything. 25 and charlie was stupid enough to believe 1 the tobacco industry. because charlie, like 2 hundreds of thousands of others in the words of 3 dr. michael cummings, had had his brain 4 highjacked by nicotine, and he searched the 5 information environment for the psychological 6 crutches and the rationalizations that would 7 allow him to continue to satisfy the need for 8 nicotine that the defendants understood existed 9 and took calculated advantage of to profit at 10 the expense of hundreds of thousands of lives 11 every year. 12 we qualified the lies. we still do not 13 really know for sure, it is not proven, 14 statistical links do not mean causation, maybe 15 it is really genetics or rainfall or air 16 pollution. nicotine occurs naturally. 17 well, you know, it really depends on what 18 you mean by "addiction," but charlie had a 19 choice, because charlie was a tough, 20 strong-willed marine, and anyone can break an 21 addiction. if you have the information, if you 22 know the truth, anyone can break their 23 addiction. was charlie any smarter than peter 24 jennings? was he any smarter than harry 25 reasoner? was he any smarter, any less 1 strong-willed that barack obama? did he have 2 less motivation than the president of the 3 united states who knows he is setting an 4 example for the world, as well as his two young 5 girls, but just cannot break his addiction? 6 we repeat the new lie over and over and 7 over again. choice, choice, choice. but 8 charlie, we know from the evidence, charlie 9 began to lose his free choice after five packs 10 of cigarettes. 101 cigarettes and he began to 11 lose his free choice and move on that line 12 closer and closer to the powerful cycle of 13 nicotine addiction. charlie had a choice, but 14 the choice became more and more and more 15 constrained, the deeper into the process of 16 addiction, he was drawn by the defendants' 17 lies. and it was the defendants' lies that 18 killed charlie piendle. 19 now, i want to try very quickly to go 20 through a pretty substantial number of points 21 that were made by the defense, and this is 22 going to be disjoined and it is going to be 23 fast, but i want to get through as many as i 24 can before i move on to some other things that 25 respond to defense arguments that were made. 1 you were -- you were told that your 2 verdict should not be based on sympathy. you 3 were told that by greg, by sia, by both defense 4 lawyers, and you are being told that by me as 5 well, and i want to draw an important 6 distinction for you and it is this. sympathy, 7 in very simple terms, means you hurt and i hurt 8 with you, and any verdict that is rendered out 9 of a sense of shared hurt is an unjust verdict, 10 you cannot do that. 11 there is another word that is important. 12 in describing not only what you can do, but 13 what you must do and that word is empathy. 14 empathy means you hurt and i understand. to 15 the same extent that a verdict rendered on the 16 basis of sympathy is an unjust verdict, a 17 verdict rendered without a full and complete 18 understanding of the loss, the magnitude of the 19 loss that liz piendle has suffered, is an 20 unjust verdict. no sympathy, but a verdict 21 that reflects a full and complete understanding 22 of the loss that liz has suffered for the last 23 14 years and will continue to suffer through 24 the end of charlie piendle's statistical life 25 expectancy, another nine years, had his life 1 not been shortened by 23 years as a consequence 2 of the misconduct of these defendants. 3 the court will not tell you that a medical 4 diagnosis is necessary with respect to 5 addiction, it is nowhere in your instructions. 6 the court will also not define "addiction" for 7 you, but we know what addiction is. we know 8 that the definition of "addiction" was changed 9 in 1988. we know that that definition of 10 addiction was arrived at through a consensus of 11 the scientific community, and the defendants 12 may not like it, but it is the definition that 13 today we deal with, and under the terms of that 14 definition, there is no question about the fact 15 that charlie piendle, smoking two packs of 16 cigarettes a day for the better part of the 17 30 years, was addicted to nicotine. the 18 evidence in this case clearly, convincingly, 19 beyond a reasonable doubt, establishes that 20 addiction and it certainly establishes that 21 addiction by way of a preponderance of the 22 evidence. 23 if the defendants really thought -- and, 24 incidentally, they make reference to the 25 dsm-iv. the dsm-iv is not a medical 1 definition. it is used by doctors. it is used 2 by medical doctors. it is used by 3 psychologists. it is used by those individuals 4 who treat nicotine addiction. and if the 5 defendants really thought that there was 6 someone whose credentials you would respect who 7 could come in here and tell you, i have 8 examined the record in this case, charlie 9 piendle is not addicted pursuant to the 10 criteria of the dsm-iv, is there any doubt in 11 your minds that you would have had that 12 individual take the witness stand and you would 13 have had an opportunity to judge his demeanor, 14 to see him subjected to cross-examination and 15 to evaluate the credibility of the conclusion 16 that he expressed? 17 but they did not call any such person, and 18 every individual who addressed the issue of 19 charlie piendle's addiction from a professional 20 perspective told you uniformly, there is no 21 doubt charlie piendle was addicted. 22 you saw repeatedly the definition of 23 concurring cause -- excuse me, the definition 24 of legal cause. what you were not shown is the 25 second half of the definition that also 1 appears, one, two, three, four, five times, and 2 it is basically the same each time, we just 3 substitute in the different word in the front 4 the same way the defendants substituted a 5 different word in the front. addiction may be 6 a legal cause of death even though it operates 7 in combination with the act of another, some 8 natural cause or some other cause, if the 9 addiction contributes substantially to 10 producing such death. that is the burden that 11 we have, that is the burden that we accept. 12 did the conduct of the defendants, did the 13 addiction that they caused, did each of the 14 other elements, defective and unreasonably 15 dangerous cigarettes, concealment, reliance, 16 negligence, did each of those or any one of 17 those contribute substantially to producing 18 charlie piendle's death? 19 and as we go through this, hopefully, i 20 will have the opportunity to take you through 21 it, you will see that the evidence is 22 overwhelming that the defendants' conduct was a 23 substantially contributing factor in every 24 circumstance to charlie's death. 25 withdrawal symptoms. i'm going to skip 1 ahead. 2 there has been a significant attack on the 3 credibility of liz piendle. i ask you, ladies 4 and gentlemen, if liz piendle were a person who 5 was inclined to shade the truth to help her 6 case, do not you think that you would have heard 7 about all kinds of withdrawal symptoms that 8 charlie piendle experienced, if she were a 9 person whose integrity was such that she would 10 alter the facts as she remembers them, there 11 is not anybody who could come into this 12 courtroom and tell you that there were not 20 13 attempts to quit. liz could have made up some 14 really good stories about quit attempts, 15 efforts on her part and charlie's part to put 16 away the cigarettes, to throw out all the 17 ashtrays, to destroy the lighters, but after 14 18 years, that was not the truth that liz 19 remembered and was not -- was not an untruth that 20 she was prepared to testify to. she respected 21 her oath. she told the truth. 22 when she was asked about significant 23 relationships, she disclosed the relationship 24 that she continued -- that she considered to be 25 significant, and it is, indeed, unfortunate 1 that having suffered the tragedy, the tragedies 2 in her life that she has suffered, that she 3 must suffer one more tragedy at the hands of 4 these defendants and be accused openly in this 5 courtroom of dishonesty. 6 mr. henk: your honor, i object to that. 7 the defendants are allowed to defend themselves 8 in this case and present evidence to the jury 9 without a conclusion being drawn that this is 10 somehow a personal attack. 11 the court: i'll sustain that objection. 12 mr. scarola: and what if charlie, indeed, 13 showed no blatant, open, and obvious withdrawal 14 symptoms? who was this man? 15 charlie piendle was an individual who had 16 suffered silently for more than half his life. 17 he was stoic, he was tough, he hid his pain, he 18 did not want the nurse changing his colostomy 19 bag because he was proud, even as he laid on 20 his death bed, dying of cancer. this was a man 21 who was not going to complain about insomnia or 22 increased appetite or whatever the other 23 symptoms were that were included on the 24 defendants' list. 25 can i have the half-a-pack-a-day slide, 1 please, jeff. 2 the defense stands up and tells you the 3 medical records reflect that charlie piendle 4 was only smoking half a pack a day. you are 5 going to have a chance to take a look at those 6 medical records. 7 enlarge the top for us, if you would, 8 please. 9 this is the document on the left-hand side 10 that you were shown, charlie piendle's medical 11 record, date of admission 3/17/75, transcribed 12 3/27/75, 10 days later. this is the document 13 that says down here, "the patient smokes a half 14 a pack per day and has an occasional alcoholic 15 drink." 16 well, let us take a look at what the 17 records really show. the document on the right 18 is the handwritten form that is filled out from 19 which the typed form was transcribed. 20 admission date march 17, 1975, charlie piendle. 21 next page, please. 22 right down here, social history, social 23 history, "smokes one and a half packs per day. 24 occasional alcohol." so the defense comes in 25 and tells you charlie was only smoking half a 1 pack a day, but ladies and gentlemen of the 2 jury -- 3 mr. biersteker: objection, that 4 mischaracterizes the argument that was made, 5 your honor. 6 the court: sustain the objection. 7 mr. scarola: well, you just heard what 8 was said. i leave it up to you to remember the 9 way in which this was presented to you, but 10 there is the evidence. the evidence is not half 11 a pack a day, the evidence is there was a 12 transcription error, somebody goofed. the 13 social history is a pack and a half a day. 14 it is the lowest figure that appears anywhere in 15 not dozens, but hundreds of pages of medical 16 records of charlie piendle where time after 17 time after time it is reflected that charlie 18 was smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. 19 we are going to get to textbooks in a 20 little while. 21 the defense tells you there was no legal 22 obligation to cause charlie piendle and other 23 smokers to internalize the knowledge they were 24 given about the health hazards of smoking. i 25 think i took those words down almost verbatim 1 and they are right. there is, however, a legal 2 obligation not to actively prevent smokers from 3 turning knowledge into belief. there is a 4 legal obligation not to intentionally provide 5 psychological crutches and bases for 6 rationalizations that have no foundation, in 7 fact. there is a legal obligation not to do 8 that. and charlie piendle responded to those 9 psychological crutches and those 10 self-rationales, provided on the basis of lies 11 by the defendants exactly the way in which the 12 defendants wanted him to respond. 13 you are told by both defendants that 14 charlie piendle would have bought someone 15 else's dangerous cigarettes if he were not 16 buying the cigarettes of these defendants. 17 well, first of all, i suggest to you 18 that is true only if charlie piendle did not know 19 the truth and did not believe the truth and only 20 if charlie piendle had become addicted to 21 nicotine as a consequence of having had the 22 truth concealed from him. they tell you 23 there is no evidence that charlie piendle would 24 have smoked less dangerous cigarettes if they 25 were available, but charlie piendle did smoke 1 less dangerous cigarettes when they became 2 available. he smoked dorals and merits, 3 advertised as the lowest tar and nicotine 4 brands. he switched to those -- 5 mr. biersteker: objection, your honor, 6 mischaracterizes the evidence. 7 the court: response. 8 mr. scarola: i believe, your honor, that 9 that is exactly what the evidence demonstrated 10 and the jury, obviously, can rely upon their 11 own notes, if somehow i have not remembered 12 that accurately, but that is not an appropriate 13 legal objection. 14 mr. barnhart did not tell you the design 15 modifications were forced by law. what he told 16 you were that the warnings were compelled by 17 law and that the design modifications, every 18 one of them, if you remember that graphic in 19 your mind about all of the design changes in 20 cigarettes, every one of them was tied right 21 back to profit, every one of them tied right 22 back to profit. 23 two-thirds of male former smokers said it 24 was not very hard to quit. well, they were not 25 the first to say it. it is easy to quit 1 smoking, i've done it thousands of times. you 2 are told that the plaintiff has tried to avoid 3 the effect of the information environment on 4 charlie piendle, and you were also told that 5 with the ability to quit comes the 6 responsibility to quit, and i agree. 7 from the outset of this case, we have 8 agreed, but with the ability to tell the truth 9 comes the responsibility to tell the truth, 10 with the ability to design and manufacture 11 safer cigarettes comes the responsibility to 12 design and manufacture safer cigarettes. with 13 the ability to research health issues 14 associated with a product that you are selling 15 comes the responsibility to research those 16 health issues. 17 remember dr. figlar's testimony, we have 18 never done any research on addiction, we did not 19 even have a research department in spite of 20 everything that was being said about the links 21 between smoking and cancer, did not even have a 22 research department until 1953. we are not the 23 ones who done the research on smoking and 24 health hazards. with the ability to make 25 public health considerations the primary 1 concern comes the responsibility to make public 2 health considerations the primary concern, not 3 consumer acceptability, which when you get 4 right down to it means profit. the number one 5 concern of these defendants, we are told by 6 dr. figlar himself, had historically been and 7 remains consumer acceptability. safety comes 8 second to the question, will our products sell. 9 that is the way it is always been for the 10 defense. that is the way the defendants 11 continue to conduct their business, consumer 12 acceptability is number one, public health 13 falls somewhere low on the list, and nowhere on 14 the list at all, when and if it ever conflicts 15 with profit. 16 with the ability to keep promises made in 17 full-page advertisements, made on television, 18 made before the u.s. congress comes the 19 responsibility to keep those promises. if we 20 ever find out our cigarettes cause cancer, we 21 will immediately tell the general public. 22 (thereupon, the video clips were played 23 and transcribed as follows:) 24 the host: suppose the tremendous amount 25 of research now going on, including that of the 1 tobacco industry research committee, were to 2 reveal that there is a cancer-causing agent in 3 cigarettes, what then? 4 mr. little: well, if it was found by 5 somebody working under the tobacco industry 6 research grant, it would be made public 7 immediately, and just as broadly as we could 8 make it and then efforts would be taken to 9 attempt to remove that substance or substances. 10 the host: are you saying, then, sir, that 11 there are -- there is something toxic about 12 tobacco which are removable by filter? 13 mr. little: well, obviously, a filter 14 takes out certain tar and nicotine. i do not 15 think the industry admits there are any bad 16 elements. if there are bad elements, through 17 our laboratories, through the surgeon general, 18 through the ama, through acts of god and luck, 19 we hope we may find them, and if they have 20 found them, they will be removed, but at this 21 point, we do not know. 22 but we do talk to the question of whether 23 or not cigarettes are hazardous. we do not 24 believe that cigarettes are hazardous, we do not 25 accept that. when, as, and if any ingredient 7114 1 in cigarette smoke is identified as being 2 injurious to human health, we are confident 3 that we can eliminate that ingredient. 4 the host: do you believe that cigarettes 5 are safe? have they been proved to be safe, 6 mr. cullman? 7 mr. little: i believe they have not been 8 proven to be unsafe. 9 (new video clip played.) 10 mr. stossel: we asked philip morris, 11 r.j. reynolds, brown & williamson, and 12 lorillard to appear on this program. none 13 would. they told us to talk to the tobacco 14 institute, the institute said anne browder will 15 speak to them. 16 ms. browder: the jury has not come in. 17 mr. stossel: it may not be harmful, 18 you are not convinced. 19 ms. browder: it may be or it may not be, 20 we do not know. 21 (thereupon, the video clip ended.) 22 mr. scarola: the defendants stubbornly 23 clung to the positions that they took in the 24 early '60s for too long, for much too long the 25 defense tells you, but charlie piendle had a 1 choice, he did not have to believe us, he was 2 just too stupid not to have recognized the fact 3 that we were lying for decades. so it is 4 charlie's fault, not ours, he chose to believe 5 our lies. 6 you are told the marlboro man did not exist 7 before 1962. well, if you remember the 8 testimony from dr. cummings, who i believe was 9 the one who addressed that subject, what he 10 said was that the marlboro man came into 11 regular use within the company in 1962. the 12 1956 annual report, the 1957 annual report, and 13 if you take a look at the 1959 annual report 14 that is also in evidence, and i venture to 15 suggest to you every annual report of the 16 company from 1956 on, you are going to see the 17 marlboro man, the same individual that looked 18 down on charlie and his friends every day 19 across the street from the candy store. 20 now, both defendants spent a great deal of 21 time talking to you about whether the 22 information concealed from charlie piendle made 23 a difference, you-all remember that, a lot of 24 talk about that. 25 here are the instructions on the law. if 1 you find that charlie piendle was a member of 2 the engle class, you are instructed as a matter 3 of law that rjr and philip morris concealed or 4 omitted material information not otherwise 5 known or available knowing that the material 6 was false or misleading or failed to disclose a 7 material fact with the intention that smokers 8 and the public would rely on this information 9 to their detriment. 10 well, now what does that mean, "material 11 information"? well, the court, and i think 12 it is the very next instruction in the package 13 that you have received, the court tells you 14 what a material fact is. you have just been told 15 the defendants concealed material facts. a 16 material fact is one that is of such 17 importance, charles piendle would not have 18 acted as he did but for the concealment or 19 omission. as a matter of law, as you have been 20 instructed and as you have sworn an oath to 21 follow those instructions, the information 22 concealed from charlie was of such importance, 23 charles piendle would not have acted as he did 24 but for the concealment. 25 mr. henk: objection, your honor. 1 mr. kelly: objection. that was a 2 misinterpretation of the law, it is a 3 misstatement of the law, and inapplicable 4 argument with respect to the findings. 5 the court: what is your preference to the 6 actual instruction? 7 mr. scarola: that is exactly what i have 8 on the board, your honor, the actual 9 instruction that the court has given the jury, 10 defining what a material fact is. 11 the court: is the objection to the yellow 12 sticky? 13 mr. kelly: sorry? 14 the court: is the objection to the yellow 15 sticky? 16 mr. henk: yes, your honor. 17 mr. kelly: i was not sure what you said, 18 your honor. no, it is to the argument that 19 plaintiff does not have to establish reliance 20 because the findings establish reliance. 21 mr. scarola: oh, i have not said that at 22 all. 23 mr. kelly: it is absolutely improper. 24 the court: why do not you restate what you 25 said with respect to the law, because the 1 instruction speaks to reliance. 2 mr. scarola: what i said is that as a 3 matter of law, r.j. reynolds and philip morris 4 concealed material information. the court 5 tells you what a material fact is, one that is 6 of such importance, charles piendle would not 7 have acted as he did but for the concealment or 8 omission. 9 philip morris, who did not call a single 10 witness, not one, tells us there is little 11 evidence that marlboro was smoked for any 12 significant period of time. and in the 13 division of responsibility, they say philip 14 morris should have none. what philip morris 15 would like you to ignore is the fact that once 16 it has been established that charlie piendle is 17 a member of the engle class, then we know, 18 because it has been established and we are 19 obliged to accept the fact, that r.j. reynolds 20 and philip morris and other tobacco companies 21 that have been specifically identified entered 22 into an agreement. they acted in concert. 23 they concealed or omitted material information. 24 they agreed to conceal or omit information 25 regarding the health effects of cigarettes. 1 what they did, they did together. which brand 2 charlie piendle smoked, i suggest to you makes 3 no difference at all. they acted in concert. 4 they were cooperating to achieve the same 5 result and they did achieve that result. 6 charlie piendle is a tobacco industry 7 success story. charlie piendle began smoking 8 in response to the information environment that 9 the tobacco industry created. now, they will 10 tell you he started smoking in response to peer 11 pressure, but the peer pressure was 12 manufactured by the tobacco industry. it was 13 the tobacco industry that made smoking sexy, 14 sophisticated, powerful, macho, and safe, and 15 they worked together to create that environment 16 to establish an information environment in 17 which peer pressure caused seventy percent of the 18 males in the united states, during that period 19 of time, to become smokers, most of whom, the 20 vast majority of whom began their smoking long 21 before age 18. 22 you are asked if philip morris shut down, 23 would charlie piendle still have smoked? well, 24 if philip morris had shut down, philip morris 25 would not be here. if r.j. reynolds, instead of 1 endangering the health of the general public, 2 instead of concealing the information they 3 knew, if philip morris and r.j. reynolds had 4 both decided they were not going to participate 5 in this agreement, they were not going to sell 6 defective products, they would not be here in 7 this courtroom. 8 the clerk: counselor, ten minutes. 9 mr. scarola: thank you very much. 10 what kind of defense is it to say, if we 11 did not rob the bank, somebody else would have. 12 if we did not break into liz piendle's house, 13 somebody else would have. if we did not kill 14 liz piendle's husband -- 15 mr. henk: objection. 16 mr. scarola: -- somebody else would have. 17 mr. henk: objection, your honor. as you 18 have instructed the jury, selling cigarettes is 19 a legal activity. everything that mr. scarola 20 is describing is illegal. 21 the court: i'll overrule the objection, 22 but that instruction is noted and it is part of 23 what the jury has been instructed on with 24 respect to the legality of selling cigarettes. 25 mr. scarola: my mom and dad used to tell 1 me, i do not care what everybody else is doing, 2 it is wrong and you should not do it. common 3 sense tells us that what everybody else is 4 doing is not an excuse, it is not a defense, it 5 is not a justification for the kind of improper 6 conduct in which these defendants have engaged. 7 what if? what if? what if the defendants 8 really had put people's health paramount over 9 profit and had designed, manufactured, 10 marketed, and sold only the safest cigarettes 11 that science would enable them to have designed 12 in the '50s, in the '60s, in the '70s, and the 13 '80s, instead of the defective and unreasonably 14 dangerous cigarettes it has already been proven 15 that they did sell? 16 what if when the defendants told us in the 17 frank statement, we accept an interest in 18 people's health as basic responsibility 19 paramount to every other consideration in our 20 business, what if they really acted in 21 accordance with those words? but they did not. 22 that was their real number one consideration. 23 what if the defendants' number one 24 consideration was what they told the american 25 people it was in 1954? reader's digest, 1 august 1957, secrecy is the rule in the 2 cigarette industry, research is guarded 3 jealously, developments immediately become 4 highly classified trade secrets. 5 mr. biersteker: objection, your honor. 6 it is not for the truth of the matter asserted. 7 the court: i'll sustain the objection. 8 mr. scarola: i'm not presenting it as in 9 for the truth of the matter asserted, your 10 honor, although i do not believe that there was 11 any limiting instruction. 12 in 1954, people's health was supposed to 13 have been paramount to every other 14 consideration in their business. the brands 15 that sell the best are those with the least 16 effecting -- effective filters and the 17 strongest tobacco, improved filtration might 18 even be unprofitable. 19 mr. biersteker: objection, your honor. 20 he is precisely using it for an impermissible 21 purpose. 22 the court: do counsel want to approach or 23 do you want to move on to the next subject? 24 mr. scarola: i will move on. this is the 25 information that was in the information 1 environment. 2 what if the defendants had told charlie 3 piendle and everyone with influence over him 4 the whole truth as soon as they knew it? what 5 if they told his parents, what if they told his 6 friends, what if they told his teachers? what 7 if they told the united states of america the 8 whole truth as soon as they knew it instead of 9 concealing and omitting material information 10 and failing to disclose material facts 11 concerning the health effects or addictive 12 nature of smoking, as it has already been 13 established they did? what if the whole truth 14 had been told, instead of polluting the 15 information environment with psychological 16 crutches and rationalizations to keep people 17 smoking, despite the surgeon general's 18 warnings? 19 what if they did not manufacture 20 controversies and acknowledged the scientific 21 truth that had been arrived at by a consensus 22 of every respected scientist in the world? 23 what if they were not advertising and marketing 24 lies? what if, instead of manufacturing 25 psychological crutches and rationalizations to 1 keep smoking -- to keep people smoking, what if 2 they told charlie the truth? what if they did? 3 but they did everything they could to keep 4 charlie and his parents and his friends and 5 everyone in bridgeport, connecticut and 6 everyone in the united states believing lies. 7 what if, instead of telling the public the 8 surgeon general was acting responsibly and 9 engaging in scare tactics, they joined hands 10 with public health officials? 11 we know what would have happened because 12 it did happen, the surgeon general's report 13 came out, cigarette sales plummeted until the 14 disinformation campaign, the pollution of the 15 information environment, the lies, the campaign 16 of misinformation was effectively carried out 17 by the cigarette industry. 18 we know what would have happened because 19 it began to happen, and what if they did not do 20 that? what if either one of these defendants, 21 either one of them had broken ranks with the 22 tobacco industry conspiracy? what if they had 23 said, i'm going to stand up and tell the truth 24 and i do not care what the rest of you are 25 doing? can anyone say that that probably 1 would not have made a difference? because once 2 the conspiracy begins to fall, it crumbles. 3 the clerk: counselor, two minutes. 4 mr. scarola: and it only takes one. 5 what if philip morris had published a 6 pamphlet like this, "raising kids who do not 7 smoke" in 1958? what if the defendants had 8 exercised reasonable care in every aspect of 9 their business instead of having acted 10 negligently with respect to every aspect of 11 their business? 12 mr. biersteker: i object to the last, 13 your honor, it invites speculation as to the 14 findings. 15 the court: i'm sorry, as to the -- 16 mr. biersteker: the last comment invites 17 speculation as to the findings, that argument 18 was acting negligently with respect to every 19 aspect of their business not supported by the 20 findings or the evidence. 21 the court: sustain the objection. 22 mr. scarola: i suggest it is directly 23 supported by the evidence, your honor. 24 mr. kelly: what was the ruling, 25 your honor? 1 the court: sustain the objection. 2 mr. scarola: is not it at least probable 3 that every one of those things made a 4 difference to charlie piendle, made a 5 difference to public health in the united 6 states, and likely would have altered the 7 outcome of charlie piendle's addiction had 8 these defendants done what these defendants 9 should have done. 10 there is probably another hour there, 11 things i'm never going to get to tell you, but 12 things that i am confident that you already 13 know. you have listened to this evidence 14 attentively, you have heard counsel speak of 15 the statute of justice, a strong woman 16 blindfolded, blind to power and prestige, 17 carrying a scale in one hand and a sword in the 18 other, and when those scales are intentionally 19 unbalanced, when there is a reckless disregard 20 for the public safety of hundreds of thousands 21 of people for the purpose of profit, then lady 22 justice is prepared to use that sword. 23 and, gentlemen, i do not mean to disregard 24 you, nor to suggest a gender change for you, 25 but all of you have your hands on that sword as 1 a consequence of the power imposed on you when 2 you took your oath -- 3 mr. henk: objection, your honor. 4 mr. scarola: -- as jurors in this case. 5 mr. henk: i'm sorry to interrupt, but 6 objection. there is an apparent suggestion that 7 the jury use a sword against the defendants, 8 your honor. this is inappropriate. 9 mr. scarola: that is exactly what i am 10 suggesting, your honor. i am suggesting -- 11 mr. henk: then may we approach? 12 the court: do you want to approach? 13 (thereupon, the following proceedings were 14 held out of the presence of the jury:) 15 mr. henk: i'm going to move for a 16 mistrial. he cannot suggest that the jury use 17 a sword against the defendants, that is 18 completely inappropriate argument. he 19 confirmed that he is -- 20 the court: what is the response? 21 mr. scarola: it is the sword of truth, it 22 is the sword of justice, it is the symbolic 23 sword that justice herself carry and entirely 24 appropriate to use in punitive damages that it 25 should be used. 1 the court: i'd like a clarification that 2 it is a sword of justice. 3 mr. scarola: i was about to do that. 4 the court: it is sustained as far as using 5 the word "sword," but -- motion is denied. 6 (thereupon, the sidebar conference was 7 concluded and the following proceedings were 8 held within the presence of the jury:) 9 mr. scarola: the sword you hold is the 10 sword of justice and it is the sword of truth 11 and it is the sword that empowers you to right 12 the terrible wrongs that have been done to liz 13 piendle and to set an example, through your 14 verdict in this case, that this kind of conduct 15 will not be tolerated any longer. 16 thank you so very much.
