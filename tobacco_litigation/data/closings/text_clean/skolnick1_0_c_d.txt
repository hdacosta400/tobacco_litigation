2 mr. belasic: good afternoon, ladies and 3 gentlemen. 4 mr. skolnick was not fooled. he was a 5 strong and intelligent man who made his own 6 decisions about the use of a legal product. 7 mr. skolnick was not fooled. his daughter 8 barbara took the stand and swore under oath 9 that in 1964, she told him the surgeon general 10 had concluded that smoking caused cancer, and 11 she said that there was no doubt -- no doubt in 12 her mind that he believed it. 13 mr. skolnick was not fooled. 14 his own wife testified that during the 15 periods of time from the '64 surgeon general's 16 report, when she had discussions with him, he 17 would tell her that he was trying to quit. 18 and she told me on the stand that he was 19 trying to quit because he believed that smoking 20 was dangerous. 21 their own expert, dr. proctor, said that 22 when mr. skolnick grew up, it was mandatory, 23 state law, to teach the school children in the 24 new york public school systems that he attended 25 that smoking was dangerous. 1 and, ladies and gentlemen, that went back 2 as far as 1899. and dr. proctor agreed that 3 that was new york law. 4 mr. skolnick was not incapable of 5 quitting, despite the suggestions. his own 6 experts, dr. cummings, the first expert they 7 put up for you on video, dr. burns said that he 8 was capable and that every smoker was capable 9 of quitting if they made a serious, persistent 10 and motivated choice to do so. 11 mr. skolnick was not deprived of his 12 choice. his own experts said repeatedly that 13 everyone, and again including mr. skolnick, 14 have a choice to quit. 15 and mr. skolnick was not somehow rendered 16 non-responsible, irresponsible. he was 17 responsible. 18 and dr. burns, on the stand, said that 19 whether or not you call mr. skolnick addicted, 20 whether we call it a habit, a dependency, 21 dr. burns, his own expert, said that 22 mr. skolnick was responsible for his smoking 23 behavior. 24 that is all of their experts, ladies and 25 gentlemen. that is all of their witnesses. 1 mr. skolnick was not fooled. 2 now, a lot of what you heard this morning 3 i think in some way explains why we spent so 4 much time here on this trial. 5 a lot of what you heard this morning was 6 evidence about advertisements for brands that 7 mr. skolnick never smoked, statements by 8 tobacco companies that there is no evidence 9 that he saw, conduct that they claim by tobacco 10 companies, some of them not even defendants 11 here, that there is no evidence linking to 12 mr. skolnick. 13 we are not here to retry the engle class 14 action. when you see the verdict form, you 15 will not be asked any questions: did the tobacco 16 companies do something about advertising to 17 youth? did the tobacco companies conceal 18 something? did the tobacco companies do 19 something wrong? 20 when you go through the verdict form, the 21 questions are about mr. skolnick, because this 22 is an individual lawsuit. 23 the claim here is brought by 24 mrs. skolnick, and the only smoker, the only 25 smoker that matters in this case is 1 mr. skolnick. not the engle issues and all the 2 other things that they are trying to talk about. 3 the questions you are going to decide is 4 mr. skolnick and why did mr. skolnick die. 5 there is four key points that i think i 6 would like to remind you when we go through the 7 verdict form and what it is that you are going 8 to have to decide. on these key points, 9 there is either no dispute or the evidence is 10 overwhelming. 11 and the first is that mr. skolnick was 12 aware of the risks of smoking since at least 13 1964. 14 and i'm going to cover the testimony of 15 his family members, the testimony of his 16 expert. and when you consider that testimony, 17 remember it does not come from a tobacco company 18 witness. it comes from his own family. 19 it comes from the people who loved him, 20 or it comes from the experts that they hired 21 and paid -- yes, as you heard, their experts 22 have made more than $2 1/2 million in the last 23 20 years, or dr. proctor who made $100,000 in 24 the last month and $800,000 in the last three 25 years. 1 so make no mistake about it, that 2 evidence comes from either the family members 3 who loved him and the experts that were paid to 4 testify on his behalf. 5 but, secondly, mr. skolnick was capable 6 of quitting. his experts admit it. but only 7 tried to cut down. and, of course, you heard a 8 lot of testimony. well, he was always trying 9 to quit. that is what mrs. skolnick says. 10 i'm going to go through the evidence and 11 look at what he did, and see if we can judge 12 and see what mr. skolnick actually did, rather 13 than what mrs. skolnick says that he said. 14 third, mr. skolnick caused his own 15 injury. you are going to see in the jury 16 instructions that judge crow instructs you that 17 in this case, the plaintiff says that 18 mr. skolnick's actions were a partial cause of 19 his own injury. 20 the evidence is going to be undisputed 21 that he could have avoided his injury. if, in 22 fact, he had primary lung cancer, we concede 23 that. if it was lung cancer caused by smoking, 24 then his own experts said he could have quit. 25 and if he had quit 15 years earlier, he would 1 not have gotten lung cancer. that is their 2 expert. 3 finally, i think we know by now, in the 4 radiation lawsuit, mrs. skolnick claimed that 5 the sylvania plant had caused mr. skolnick's 6 lung cancer and had caused her husband's death. 7 let us look at the evidence on was 8 mr. skolnick fooled. 9 in '64, both barbara skolnick and 10 mrs. skolnick said that mr. skolnick heard 11 about the surgeon general's report. they both 12 had conversations with him. mrs. skolnick said 13 she discussed the health risks of smoking. she 14 asked him to quit. there is no dispute about 15 this. 16 but look at what he said in response. he 17 said he would try. 18 this was 1964. it was 30 years before he 19 died. he did not respond to her: i do not 20 believe the surgeon general's report, i saw 21 something on the news. that is the plaintiff's 22 argument. that is what they want you to 23 believe. 24 mrs. skolnick said that his response to 25 her was he would try. 1 well, if he had been tricked, if he 2 did not think that smoking caused lung cancer 30 3 years earlier, why would he be trying to quit? 4 when i asked mrs. skolnick that, she 5 admitted that the reason he was trying to quit, 6 and she says it was a lot, and we will look at 7 that evidence, but the reason he was trying to 8 quit is that he believed that smoking was 9 dangerous. 10 well, it was not just mrs. skolnick, 11 because their daughter barbara was more 12 emphatic. she got up there and she testified 13 that, again, she raised the issue of the 1964 14 surgeon general's report. 15 and i asked her specifically if there was 16 any doubt, did she have any doubt that he 17 accepted the warning from that report? 18 and remember, that report did not just say 19 that smoking might be hazardous or smoking 20 might be dangerous. when the report came out 21 in '64, it says: smoking causes lung cancer. 22 and now, almost 50 years later, we are 23 debating whether or not this man was fooled? 24 his own daughter says he -- no doubt he knew 50 25 years ago that it could cause lung cancer. 1 she also said no doubt he believed that 2 smoking could be dangerous to his health. 3 and because we know that the plaintiff's 4 lawyers have been making these arguments that 5 he was misled or he heard some unidentified 6 statement on the news, i asked her what the 7 response was. you know. and he did not 8 respond, oh, i do not believe it because i heard 9 the tobacco companies. 10 no, he told her he would try to quit, or 11 try to cut down, as he told so many of his 12 loved ones when they warned him. 13 we know, again, two years later, then the 14 package warning came out on every pack of 15 cigarettes. and, once again, his daughter had 16 the conversation with him. she told him about 17 the health risks. 18 this is two years after she had told us 19 that he already believed that smoking could 20 cause lung cancer. 21 and remember this testimony? she 22 actually said: here it is in black and white, 23 holding the pack. the tobacco companies are 24 telling you it is detrimental to your health, 25 and you need to stop. 1 let me ask you this. if it was true, if 2 it was true that mr. skolnick had been tricked, 3 cheated, deceived, if he actually believed in 4 the middle of the '60s something that some man 5 on television said or something from a tobacco 6 company said, do not you think he would have 7 told his daughter, well, the tobacco companies 8 are not telling me it is detrimental to my 9 health. i think they are telling me it is safe. 10 i'm not going to quit. 11 i asked her that, did he say that? 12 of course, no, he did not. 13 he said, i'm trying to quit. 14 she told him the tobacco companies are 15 telling you it is dangerous. she said there is 16 no doubt in her mind that he believed the 17 surgeon general. 18 now, we have all heard many times that two 19 years later, in 1968, mrs. skolnick decided to 20 change her life and change her smoking. she would 21 been smoking for 26 years. she said she was 22 smoking a pack a day. she was smoking the same 23 exact brand as her husband. she was not some 24 occasional smoker; 26 years, a pack a day at 25 that point, the same exact cigarettes. 1 whatever was in those cigarettes that 2 they want you to imagine, it was going into 3 mrs. skolnick. she made the choice. 4 we know what happened. he would not even 5 watch the tv show with her. we know he did not 6 choose to quit. we know he choose to continue. 7 he would not even watch the tv show. 8 and you will be instructed, obviously 9 you are the judges of the facts, you use your 10 common sense, your intelligence, your 11 experience. if he actually wanted to quit 12 smoking, do not you think he would have sat on 13 the couch for an hour with his wife? 14 does it make sense that he really wanted 15 to quit, but their story is, well, he thought 16 he would cut down a little at a time? 17 thirty years later, he still had not cut 18 down. he is always telling people, i'm going to 19 cut down. 20 does it make sense? did he really want 21 to quit? or did he choose to continue? 22 he made a different choice than his wife. 23 we know she chose to quit, we know she 24 chose to follow through. she watched all five 25 episodes, and at the end of that she was a 1 nonsmoker, and she never smoked again. 2 and for 25 years, from 1968 until 1993 3 when mr. skolnick passed away, he had a living, 4 breathing example of a nonsmoker. and you know 5 what? she said that not once did he ever ask 6 her, how did you quit, honey? how did you 7 quit? 8 does that make sense if he really wanted 9 to? if you wanted to change your life 10 dramatically and your own spouse had done so, 11 if you really wanted to, do not you think you 12 would have asked even once, how did you do it? 13 he chose not to quit. he made a 14 different choice than her. 15 at the same time, mrs. skolnick said in 16 1968 that she knew cigarettes were addictive. 17 this is 20 years before the surgeon general's 18 report changed the definition of cigarettes 19 from habit to addictive, 20 years before. 20 she got the same information her husband 21 did. they were not fooled. not just 22 mr. skolnick. she was not fooled. he was not 23 fooled. 24 now, we know that by the mid 1970s, her 25 husband had stopped smoking in the car. 1 and remember when dr. burns came? 2 dr. burns, obviously he never met mr. skolnick, 3 but he read all of the deposition testimony 4 from mrs. skolnick, from barbara, from the son 5 robert, from amy skolnick, the daughter-in-law. 6 he read all of that. 7 and he agreed that by the mid '70s she 8 had stopped, and he agreed that mrs. skolnick 9 reported that the reason -- the reason her 10 husband (sic) stopped smoking in the mid '70s 11 was because everybody knew how bad it was. 12 everybody knew how bad it was. there was not 13 any doubt that he knew smoking was bad. 14 now, i've got to be fair here. do you 15 remember dr. burns speculated maybe they were 16 just talking about secondhand smoke? maybe 17 they meant secondhand smoke was bad and 18 everyone knew that. 19 imagine if that was true. if it was true 20 in the mid '70s, that mr. skolnick thought 21 secondhand smoke was so bad that they could not 22 even be around it, well, is not it obvious that 23 he knew smoking was bad for him. even if you 24 accept that rank speculation from dr. burns. 25 and remember, this is ten years after 1 their daughter swears under oath that there is 2 no doubt that her father believed the surgeon 3 general's report on lung cancer. 4 we know that also his son robert warned 5 him repeatedly. we saw that, and dr. burns 6 agreed. 7 we know robert the attorney, he did not 8 testify, but he testified under oath at a 9 deposition. dr. burns agrees that robert 10 warned mr. skolnick about the risks of smoking 11 and asked him to quit all throughout the 1970s. 12 and this is the way dr. burns put it. he 13 used a little more formal language than i did. 14 he said that robert consistently provided a 15 message to mr. skolnick to quit. 16 so it was coming at all directions, from 17 the people he loved the most, from the people 18 he trusted the most. 19 and those people, including his daughter, 20 report that he was not fooled; that he was not 21 saying, i think smoking is safe because 22 somebody said something on tv. 23 under oath, they testified that he 24 believed it was dangerous. and we know, as we 25 heard before, that mr. skolnick was told that 1 his sister sunny had died from lung cancer. 2 i heard mr. schlesinger say, well, he 3 probably would have disputed that. 4 that is not really the issue. no one in 5 this room knows whether she died of lung cancer 6 or not, but it is undisputed that is what 7 mr. skolnick was told. that is what 8 mrs. skolnick said. that is what dr. burns 9 said. 10 he was told his own sister had died of 11 lung cancer from smoking. 12 and when i asked dr. burns how big a 13 proof is that, the emotional factor of seeing 14 in real life, dr. burns said that it was 15 virtually irrefutable, irrefutable 16 demonstration to mr. skolnick that smoking 17 causes lung cancer. 18 so this is their expert, this is the 19 gentleman that they picked to come in and give 20 an opinion on addiction, and he admits in 1978, 21 basically no doubt, irrefutable that 22 mr. skolnick knew that smoking causes lung 23 cancer. that is the same thing his daughter 24 said way back in the '60s. 25 now, you heard a lot of different themes 1 in plaintiff's counsel's argument, and we heard 2 a lot of different themes and messages about 3 what the issues in this case are. 4 and i would submit to you that those 5 messages from the plaintiff, from the 6 plaintiff's witnesses, from the plaintiff's 7 attorneys have been contradictory. 8 one of their arguments here is that 9 mr. skolnick did not appreciate the risks 10 because of something a tobacco company said. 11 and the only evidence of that is 12 mrs. skolnick said at some time she was sure 13 they were watching a news item where some 14 tobacco company person was testifying, and it 15 was on tv. 16 but yet when i asked mrs. skolnick, how 17 can you say he tried to quit all the time, she 18 said: well, he tried to quit all the time 19 because he thought smoking was dangerous. 20 they cannot have it both ways. either 21 mr. skolnick wanted to quit all the time 22 because he thought smoking was dangerous, or he 23 had been somehow tricked, and in which case he 24 would not want to quit. 25 but they are trying to have it both ways, 1 and it is simply contradictory. 2 now, at times they have suggested he could 3 not quit because of the effects of nicotine, 4 and even today we saw that. 5 even today when mr. hammer was talking 6 about we take a certain percentage of fault, 7 and he said that mr. skolnick was only 20 8 percent responsible for 50 years of choices 9 about smoking. he actually used the phrase 10 because of his "inability to quit." and a 11 minute later, he was saying of course he could 12 quit. 13 it is contradictory. either he could quit 14 or he could not quit. 15 their experts say he could quit. their 16 admission and judge crow's jury instructions 17 tell you that they admit that he caused his own 18 injury in part because of his failure to quit. 19 he could have quit, and he caused his own 20 injury. and, again, that is not something a 21 tobacco company is saying. that is what the 22 plaintiffs admitted in this lawsuit. that is 23 what judge crow was instructing you. 24 now, we know the biggest contradiction, 25 and you have seen it from the very first five 1 minutes of opening statement when i showed you 2 that sylvania case. you had not heard anything 3 about the fact that mrs. skolnick said that her 4 husband had been killed by toxic exposures, 5 radiation, from the skolnick plant (sic). from 6 the very beginning, you saw that. 7 she did claim in this case that smoking 8 caused lung cancer and death. but she claimed 9 years before in another lawsuit that it was 10 radiation that killed him. and that is an 11 inherent contradiction. 12 we are going to go through that, and i'll 13 address what mr. schlesinger said about it. 14 well, it is not just the contradictions 15 and themes. mrs. skolnick's testimony is the 16 opposite of her own daughter. she says at one 17 point that her husband relied on unidentified 18 statements. i asked her when they were, are 19 you sure you are not thinking about the 1994 20 testimony, which obviously would be after her 21 husband had passed away. 22 she said no, she was sure it was at some 23 point -- she could not even state the decade. 24 she said she just heard it was sometime after 25 the surgeon general's report. 1 but when we asked barbara, what did your 2 father think about the surgeon general's 3 report, she said there is no doubt, no doubt 4 that he believed it. 5 mrs. skolnick says he experienced 6 withdrawal symptoms, although you heard the 7 withdrawal symptoms. she said she was edgy and 8 fidgety. that is not the kind of withdrawal 9 symptoms we typically think of as interfering 10 with an ability to function. 11 yes, i suppose you would not want to be 12 fidgety or edgy, not the kind of serious 13 withdrawal symptoms that their experts talked 14 about. 15 but when we asked barbara under oath, she 16 said she does not remember her father having any 17 withdrawal symptoms. 18 now, why would barbara, who knew him -- 19 she was born in 1950, she was able to observe 20 him throughout the '60s, '70s, '80s, and '90s, 21 why would barbara say something under oath 22 that is the exact opposite? 23 you will have to make that decision. 24 mrs. skolnick even contradicts herself. 25 we know she says he relied on some unidentified 1 statements. but you saw and you will remember 2 this was the point when i was cross-examining 3 her, and i had to put up about two pages of her 4 prior testimony that she gave under oath in 5 this lawsuit. 6 and in there, she described how she told 7 mr. skolnick that the surgeon general was 8 right, the tobacco companies were wrong. and 9 mr. skolnick, he did not tell her, honey, i 10 think the tobacco companies, you know, that i 11 think it is safe or i'm being misled. no. he 12 said he would quit. 13 she is contradicting herself even in the 14 same hour when she was on the stand. 15 mrs. skolnick's -- her testimony about 16 filters was contradicted by her own expert. 17 she said repeatedly that they -- meaning, she 18 and mr. skolnick -- switched to filtered 19 cigarettes as soon as they came out, she said. 20 as soon as they came out. 21 dr. proctor explained how that is not 22 true. he said filters came out in the early 23 '50s, and mrs. skolnick said the very first 24 time they smoked filters was pall mall. and 25 pall mall did not even have a filter until 1966. 1 so for almost 15 years these filters were 2 out, these filters and the statements that they 3 say are somehow tricking them, they were not 4 smoking them. 5 and what she said, her own expert says 6 was not true. 7 she says that they thought they were 8 safer. when we asked her why did you think 9 they were safer, who said what? did a tobacco 10 company say something? was there actually an 11 advertisement for pall malls that told you they 12 were safer? she does not know, she cannot 13 identify anything. 14 and then we asked dr. proctor. i put up 15 all the pall mall advertisements, including in 16 the years before they switched to filters, and 17 those were the ones that said long on taste, 18 mild. long on taste, mild. 19 and he agreed that those ads never said 20 filters were safer. because when the filter 21 came out, it was the same statement. 22 and he said -- this was his description, 23 his word. honest. he actually used the word 24 "honest" to describe a tobacco company. he 25 said american tobacco company was honest about 1 filters. 2 now we know that mrs. skolnick has 3 contradicted herself. she told us under oath 4 that she was not suing for radiation, when she 5 sued verizon and the sylvania plant. she told 6 us under oath that she was only suing for colon 7 cancer. 8 and then we saw her own wrongful death 9 claim. he did not die from the colon cancer. 10 she is claiming he died from lung cancer. and 11 her claim in that case was wrongful death from 12 lung cancer. we saw that in her own 13 handwriting, sworn and under perjury. 14 here's what we saw. this is her verified 15 declaration for allocation of settlement 16 proceeds in the radiation lawsuit. 17 there is who she is suing, verizon is now 18 one of the owners of that radioactive site. 19 look at what she brought. this is not a 20 claim for colon cancer that was cured through 21 surgery in 1980. this is a claim for wrongful 22 death. the specifics of the claim. she has to 23 know when she is filling this out that her 24 claim, as she writes, is for lung cancer. 25 we know that she knew it was a wrongful 1 death claim. it was literally on the inch 2 above where she signed. we know that she swore 3 and said that under penalty of perjury that she 4 read the foregoing; that the same was true to 5 her knowledge. she swore it was true under 6 penalty of perjury. 7 you know, mr. schlesinger said -- he went 8 through the same things i did, and he said, 9 hey, that was true, that was true, that was 10 true. 11 well, of course, we are not claiming it 12 was not true. what is true is that three years 13 before she brought this lawsuit claiming 14 smoking killed her husband, she had already 15 sued corporations saying they killed her 16 husband. although she was not saying smoking 17 was the cause. she was saying radiation was 18 the cause. 19 so no one is disputing that she was 20 writing down here what she thought was true. 21 this is proof that what she is saying now, it 22 was only colon cancer, i never knew it was a 23 wrongful death claim. 24 with all due respect, this is proof that 25 what she said simply is not credible. 1 once again, it says the specifics of the 2 claim. notice what it instructs her. the 3 first words in the instruction: for the 4 claimed injury, she writes lung cancer. that is 5 what she was suing for. even though she says 6 under oath now, that is not what i was suing 7 for. 8 same thing again. give us the specifics 9 of the claim. she talks about death from lung 10 cancer. 11 now, look, i'm not going to say -- i'm 12 not going to talk about corrupt motives or say 13 all the other bad things that mr. schlesinger 14 said about dr. mcgregor. 15 you are going to decide. and i know that 16 mrs. skolnick is 86. i know her husband passed 17 around 20 years ago. from everything we have 18 seen, her husband sounds like a wonderful man, 19 and she deserves to be treated with respect. i 20 think i did. 21 but with all due respect, you can 22 conclude from this evidence that mrs. skolnick 23 has simply not been credible about her prior 24 lawsuit; that she took a position that was 25 beneficial to her in that lawsuit, suing for 1 money, saying radiation was the cause, and now 2 she is taken that position here. 3 and we have seen that her testimony, not 4 just on radiation, her testimony on smoking, 5 contradicted by her own daughter, contradicted 6 by her own experts. sometimes even 7 contradicting herself in the same session on 8 the stand. 9 and i would submit to you that, again, 10 with all due respect -- and we have sympathy 11 for her. but you have agreed to put aside the 12 sympathy that you have for her. 13 but her testimony simply does not add up. 14 and it is contradicted by what we now know are 15 facts. 16 so we know that mr. skolnick was aware of 17 the risks for at least 30 years, and he was 18 capable of quitting and tried to cut down. 19 we know the plaintiffs have agreed that 20 at least in part, they have admitted that he 21 caused his own injury. 22 let us look at the verdict form. this is 23 going to be what your -- the actual verdict 24 form you are going to decide. 25 here is the first question. and even 1 though it is one question, it really is three 2 different parts. 3 was mr. skolnick addicted to cigarettes 4 containing nicotine? and if he was, was such 5 addiction a legal cause of his lung cancer and 6 death? 7 and of those three issues, first we know 8 the plaintiff has to prove that he has lung 9 cancer. 10 their experts agree that if it was lung 11 cancer that spread from somewhere else, then 12 it is not caused by smoking. 13 their experts agree if it is spread on the 14 colon, no one claims that that was -- that that 15 was caused by smoking. 16 it is their burden to show that he 17 actually had this primary lung cancer caused by 18 smoking. 19 of course as mr. schlesinger said, they 20 also have to prove that he was addicted. 21 this is the most important part, and that 22 is what you did not hear from the plaintiff's 23 lawyer. they have to show not just that 24 smoking caused his cancer, but that 25 addiction -- that addiction was the legal cause 1 of his lung cancer and death. 2 now, whatever definition you use, was his 3 addiction an actual cause, apart from his 4 choice to smoke for those years? 5 here's their burden of proof. we know 6 that plaintiffs have the burden of proof on 7 each of those issues. they are going to need to 8 prove that smoking medically caused a primary 9 lung cancer. 10 they have to prove it was addiction. and 11 then the third point, they have to prove that 12 addiction was a legal cause. 13 and i'm just going to briefly review some 14 of the evidence on this medical causation. 15 mr. lombardi is going to talk about 16 radiation, and he is going to address that and 17 what dr. mcgregor actually said. 18 but let us just briefly talk about. they 19 brought in two doctors that treated him. what 20 they did not bring in was the doctor, 21 dr. rosenthal, the gastroenterologist. because 22 he is the man, he is the doctor who treated him 23 for colon cancer. you did not see him testify. 24 we just have his records. 25 the other two doctors, pulmonologist and 1 radiologist, are doctors who are trying to 2 remember something that happened 20 years ago 3 by looking at whatever is on their medical 4 records. 5 you have to decide, was it primary lung 6 cancer? did it spread from the colon? 7 we know dr. mcgregor has already said 8 that radiation caused the colon cancer. and 9 now mrs. skolnick, now her new position is she 10 was only suing for colon cancer in the verizon 11 case. if that was true, then even 12 mrs. skolnick would have agreed that radiation 13 caused it. 14 we know that everyone agrees it was not 15 caused by smoking. but it was the same cell 16 type as the tumor they found in his lung. 17 now dr. mcgregor says that that colon 18 cancer, the colon cancer that may have spread, 19 was caused by radiation. if colon cancer 20 spreads, where does it go? 21 we asked their experts. we did not bring 22 in someone. we asked their experts. where 23 would it spread? 24 dr. burns said it spreads to other of the 25 major organs, but the two most common are the 1 liver and the lungs. and dr. burns, their 2 expert, specifically said that it goes first to 3 the liver on the way to the lungs. 4 so just common sense, if you wanted to 5 know, is there a possibility that colon cancer 6 spread to the lung? after what we learned from 7 dr. burns, you would want to know, well, did he 8 have a tumor in his liver? 9 well, here is what we found. they did 10 the radiology. they found at least three 11 hepatic masses. their doctors agree hepatic is 12 the liver. there were three masses in his 13 liver. two of them measured approximately two 14 centimeters. two centimeters is about 15 three-quarters of an inch. that is two of those 16 tumors and a third one. 17 they say specifically -- and again, no 18 tobacco company made this up. these are his 19 actual records. 20 they say these three masses in the liver 21 could have been missed. and, of course, they 22 never biopsied them. no one went to find out 23 if those were cancerous. never biopsied. 24 they put dr. davis on. dr. davis is not 25 an expert on colon cancer. but we asked him 1 about this. one of the lesions was on the ct 2 scan, and one of the reports said it could have 3 been missed. 4 and then dennis murphy asked him. that is 5 not uncommon that testing done on a patient 6 might miss a lesion on a mass. and dr. barry 7 davis -- and this is the doctor they picked out 8 of all his doctors to come in -- said it can, 9 it can be missed. 10 we are not making it up. it is on the 11 medical record. and no one went, no one went 12 to check if those three large masses in his 13 lung were cancer. 14 the second thing you are going to have to 15 decide and then the third thing are related. 16 plaintiffs like to argue -- all you have 17 to decide was, was he addicted. come on, he 18 smoked 30 years, he smoked a lot. common 19 sense, he must be addicted. that is what 20 plaintiffs tell you is the position. 21 but we know, and you will see on the 22 verdict form, that they also have to prove that 23 addiction, not just smoking, that addiction was 24 the legal cause of his death. 25 let us look at the evidence on both. 1 first of all, mr. skolnick enjoyed smoking. i 2 do not know if anyone else found it surprising 3 that the witnesses were not asked that. 4 but sylvia gross did. and remember, 5 sylvia gross was a woman around mrs. skolnick's 6 age, one of the skolnicks' close friends. and 7 she said without question, he enjoyed smoking. 8 none of the other family members were 9 asked. could he really have smoked 40 or 50 10 years and not enjoyed it? could he have smoked 11 after meals and not enjoyed it? did he not 12 enjoy it? 13 well, the only person not tied to this 14 family when asked that question immediately 15 said, sure, he enjoyed smoking. that is one of 16 the reasons he smoked. 17 now, on addiction, dr. burns, their 18 expert, admitted there is no consensus 19 definition. there is not some checklist or some 20 criteria that you can use. 21 we know there is evidence he enjoyed 22 smoking. there is evidence from barbara that he 23 smoked to relieve stress. she said that one of 24 the reasons that meditation -- that he was 25 interested in meditation was that in general he 1 wanted to relax more, wanted to reduce stress. 2 we know from barbara that he had no real 3 withdrawal symptoms, the kind of symptoms that 4 an addict, that a drug addict, as 5 mr. schlesinger says, that a drug addict would 6 have. 7 and we know this. none of his doctors 8 diagnosed addiction. 9 think of all the medical records that you 10 saw and all the different doctors, and they 11 only called two. but none of those medical 12 records said the patient is addicted. patient 13 is nicotine dependent. none of them did. 14 now, dr. barry davis came in and said he 15 does not remember him. but he said 20 years 16 after the fact he would say that. but while 17 they were seeing him, there is not any evidence 18 that his doctors actually diagnosed addiction. 19 and as we are going to see, the evidence 20 is that it was actually his choice to smoke and 21 not stop. it was not something that he was 22 being compelled by nicotine. 23 the judge will instruct you and you can 24 see when you go to the section on legal cause, 25 what is legal cause? does it mean it is legal 1 to cause something? 2 no, legal cause means that something 3 directly and in a continuous sequence 4 contributes substantially to a result. 5 so if you were arguing he was addicted, 6 whatever definition they are going to use -- and 7 i have not seen one yet -- but if you are arguing 8 that he was addicted and you wanted to know if 9 it caused lung cancer, you would have to ask, 10 did it directly cause it? was it in a 11 continuous sequence? and did it contribute 12 substantially? 13 let us look at the evidence on that. 14 first of all, how can addiction be a 15 direct cause when you admit that the smoker can 16 quit and avoid his injury? 17 they are saying addiction caused his lung 18 cancer. but their experts on addiction say 19 addiction does not mean you cannot quit. you can 20 still quit. 21 how is addiction a direct cause when a 22 person can stop and not get the injury that 23 they claim addiction caused? it is not a cause 24 when a smoker has the ability to quit or a 25 choice to quit. 1 and when we asked dr. burns and 2 dr. cummings, their experts, they agree that 3 it is up to the smoker to choose the quit, and 4 that the smoker is responsible. 5 you know the old line that no one put a 6 gun to his head -- and that seems like an 7 extreme example. but in this case, it is true. 8 because his experts say he could still quit. 9 and i do not -- is there any way that 10 someone can say you caused an injury to a 11 person when that person has the ability to make 12 a choice, and if they make it -- if they make 13 that choice, they can walk away and not be 14 injured. 15 and this is separate from the issue of 16 whether smoking's the cause. the judge is 17 instructing you, the verdict form is 18 instructing you. you have to find that 19 addiction is a cause. 20 here's the instruction you are going to 21 get. and this is the court -- judge crow 22 telling you that in this regard, plaintiff has 23 admitted that the acts of leo skolnick relating 24 to the duration and frequency of his efforts to 25 quit smoking -- so the duration and frequency, 1 how long and how often -- were a partial legal 2 cause of his injuries and death. 3 and, of course, the plaintiffs, they 4 do not want to take full responsibility. they 5 want to say it is also the fault of defendants. 6 but think of that. the plaintiffs are 7 admitting that mr. skolnick caused his own lung 8 cancer and death. but they say, just in part. 9 what does this mean? how could leo 10 skolnick, how could they admit that he caused 11 in part his own death? 12 well, it has to mean that mr. skolnick 13 knew that smoking was dangerous and continued 14 to smoke. because if he did not know that, 15 would the plaintiffs have admitted that he was 16 a partial cause of his own death? 17 and it has to mean that he had the 18 ability to quit. because if he could not quit, 19 how could the plaintiffs say that his actions 20 with regard to quitting were a cause of his own 21 injury? 22 and we know his experts say, including 23 dr. burns, that mr. skolnick had the ability to 24 quit smoking at a time that would have 25 prevented his death. 1 now, mr. skolnick was not someone who was 2 in a car with no brakes or strapped to the 3 wheel, hurdling down a highway where he 4 could not escape and he was inevitably going to 5 crash. 6 on this highway of smoking, their own 7 experts, dr. burns and dr. cummings, say that 8 there are off-ramps, there are places where the 9 smoker can stop. 10 he had the choice and the ability to 11 quit, and that is from his own experts, not from 12 someone the tobacco company brought. he had 13 the choice to quit. 14 and dr. burns says he could have quit at 15 a time that would have prevented his injury. 16 given all that, how can you say, how can 17 plaintiffs say, well, addiction was a direct 18 cause of his injury? 19 it just does not have to be a cause, it 20 has to be a direct cause. their own experts 21 say that mr. skolnick had the ability to choose 22 to break that chain at any time. 23 now i have this up here on the board, and 24 i have to admit this is really just a reminder 25 for me to point you to the board. this board 1 is sort of like a tree of choices. i'm not 2 going to go over them all again. obviously we 3 do not know when he started smoking. no one saw 4 him. 5 dr. burns tried to say, well, if you look 6 at the statistics, men in his age group started 7 at a certain point. i asked him a few 8 questions about that. but everyone agrees no 9 one knows when he started with direct 10 knowledge. 11 nobody met him in this case before 1947, 12 when he was already 29. but he had a choice. 13 he could become a regular smoker or do not 14 start. 15 we know in '64 when the surgeon general's 16 report came out, the first time he heard it, he 17 had a choice. 18 the first time his daughter barbara 19 warned him about lung cancer in '64, he had a 20 choice. 21 the first time his wife told him about 22 the surgeon general's report, and she asked him 23 to quit, he had a choice. 24 two years later when the warning came out 25 on the pack, he had that choice. 1 and when his daughter barbara came to him 2 with the warning and told him the tobacco 3 companies are telling you it is bad, you need to 4 stop, he had a choice again. 5 and two years later, when mrs. skolnick 6 quit, he had that choice. 7 and in the '70s, when a different warning 8 came out on every pack, he had a choice. 9 and in the mid '70s and mid '80s, when 10 even his own wife admits he knew it was 11 dangerous for him and when his son robert was 12 warning him, according to dr. burns on a 13 consistent basis, he had a choice every one of 14 those times. 15 and it is simply second-guessing now to 16 say he made the wrong choice, that he made the 17 wrong choice and as mrs. skolnick is now 18 saying, because her husband made a regrettable 19 choice, a choice that every one of us 20 sympathizes with, she now wants $9.1 million 21 for the choices he made year after year after 22 year after year. 23 he was not a robot. he was not a zombie. 24 according to his own experts, he had the 25 ability to quit. 1 i want to show you the flip chart. this 2 will just take a minute. i think everybody 3 remembers. 4 dr. burns said if you quit smoking, your 5 risk of lung cancer goes down. after a year, 6 it goes down; after two years, it goes down 7 more; after five and ten years, it goes way 8 down. 9 and he said after 15 years, it goes down 10 enough that he could agree that if he would 11 have quit 15 years before he died, that more 12 likely than not he would not have developed 13 lung cancer. 14 and that is the standard, the greater 15 weight of the evidence, more probable than not. 16 that is the standard in the court of law. 17 that is why i asked dr. burns that way. he 18 says: mr. skolnick quits 15 years, 1978, then 19 more likely than not he does not get lung 20 cancer. 21 well, if you look at the choice tree, 22 really every single day of his life he had that 23 choice. 24 but look at all the different times that 25 the risk of lung cancer was put right in his 1 face, was put directly to him by the people he 2 loved, the people he trusted most in the world. 3 he made those choices. 4 at any one of these times before 1978, he 5 could have quit smoking. that is what his own 6 experts say. and according to dr. burns, then 7 he would not have gotten lung cancer. 8 now, how can you say that addiction was a 9 direct cause when you say at the same time 10 addiction did not stop him from quitting, and if 11 he chose to quit, he does not get cancer. 12 you can play a word game. you can say 13 addiction means these things. he smokes a lot. 14 he smokes in the morning. 15 i could come up and say, well, i think 16 it is better to say it is a habit. it is a 17 perpetual or continual behavior. 18 another person like dr. cummings might 19 say it is a dependency. let us look at the 20 psychiatric definition. you can put whatever 21 label on it you want. 22 but in the end, to show that addiction is 23 a direct cause, they have to show that it 24 directly -- hooked him into substantially and 25 continuously causing him to develop lung 1 cancer. 2 but his experts do not say, oh, no, he was 3 directly and continuously caused to develop 4 lung cancer. they admit that he could have 5 quit. they admit that he had a choice. 6 dr. cummings also agreed within 15 years, 7 the risk of cancer disappears. 8 mr. schlesinger called it a -- he said 9 this was my favorite number. i suppose in a 10 tobacco case about whether people have to quit, 11 it might be. because the idea that 50 million 12 people can accomplish something and then to 13 just pooh-pooh that and say, well, this one man 14 whose wife just happens to be suing for 15 9 million, he could not. 16 what makes more sense? 50 million people 17 have quit. some of their experts said 60 18 million. it is the most common health behavior 19 that people do to improve. 20 dr. cummings says it is been known 21 hundreds of years, and even the surgeon general 22 has referred to it as personal choice. 23 dr. cummings, who they put on by video, 24 said that the 50 million people who quit were 25 addicted; that more than half of the people who 1 had ever smoked had already quit, and that 2 addicted smokers can and do quit every day. 3 he said that anyone could quit. 4 let us look at what he said about whether 5 individual smokers have a choice and whether 6 they must decide. 7 (video clip was played as follows:) 8 q. doctor, do you agree with me that the 9 individual smoker must decide whether or not to 10 continue smoking? 11 a. i do. 12 (video clip concluded.) 13 mr. belasic: this was their first 14 expert. this was the person they chose to 15 bring you on addiction. this is the only 16 expert that does these large-scale smoking 17 cessation groups that he counsels. 18 no one -- i certainly do not dispute, no 19 one disputes that dr. cummings is an expert on 20 this stuff. look at what he said. 21 (video clip was played as follows:) 22 q. of the 50 million smokers who have quit 23 smoking, the majority of those people were addicted to 24 cigarettes, correct? 25 a. yes. 1 q. so, when we talk about addiction, we 2 do not mean that someone cannot quit smoking. true? 3 a. that is true. 4 q. because addicted smokers can and do quit 5 smoking every day? 6 a. yes. 7 (video clip concluded.) 8 mr. belasic: and, finally, dr. cummings 9 said this: the success rate for a certain type 10 of person -- let us see what type of person it 11 is -- but the success rate for a certain type 12 of person to quit is one hundred percent. not 10, not 13 50, it is one hundred percent. look what he says. 14 (video clip was played as follows:) 15 q. and when smokers come to your stop 16 smoking clinic, you tell them that the success rate 17 for quit among people who really want to quit and 18 stick to it is one hundred percent, right? 19 a. yes, i do say that in my literature. 20 q. and you have testified in the past that 21 anyone can quit if they make up their mind to do it, 22 right? 23 a. i have testified to that, yes. 24 (video clip concluded.) 25 mr. belasic: not quite as quick with the 1 answer, but you see that he said yep, that is 2 true. 3 really want to quit and stick to it. 4 dr. burns also agreed that anyone is 5 capable of quitting, and dr. burns, when i 6 asked him, addicted smokers, even if you call 7 them addicted, they are still responsible. 8 they do not get to say, i'm not responsible, i 9 inhaled nicotine. 10 he agreed addicted smokers are still 11 responsible for their smoking behavior. 12 well, was mr. skolnick the kind of person 13 who, quote, "really wanted to quit," was 14 motivated and stuck to it? 15 because dr. burns, his own expert, said 16 one hundred percent of those people can quit. 17 let us look at the evidence. we know that 18 the u.s. department of health has said that 19 scientific studies suggest that everyone can 20 quit smoking. 21 but let us judge the evidence on 22 mr. skolnick. y'all know in real life there is 23 a difference between what somebody says, yeah, 24 you will do this, that sounds great, honey, and 25 what somebody actually does. 1 let us review the evidence on what 2 mr. skolnick said versus what he actually did. 3 we know that mrs. skolnick says that he told 4 her that he would either try to cut down or 5 sometimes she phrases it "try to quit." 6 but when we explore with mrs. skolnick, 7 with barbara skolnick, we find that what 8 they are describing is he is actually saying he is 9 going to cut down. and then at some unknown 10 point in the future, that he might quit. 11 and we know that he never just put his 12 cigarettes down and just said, i'm not going to 13 smoke now and i'll see how long i can go. 14 let us look at what he actually did. 15 from 1947 -- and we have no evidence 16 beforehand -- throughout the 1950s, there is no 17 evidence in the record that he did anything to 18 quit smoking. 19 in the 1960s, there is no evidence in the 20 record that he did anything specific to quit 21 smoking. 22 and think about that. think about all 23 the evidence that is in the record about he saw 24 the surgeon general's report in '64, his wife 25 talked to him. barbara talked to him. his son 1 robert talked to him. he saw the warnings. 2 but there is no specific evidence that he 3 actually did something to try and stop smoking 4 during that entire decade. 5 now, in the 1970s, we know he went to -- 6 mr. schlesinger called it hippie-dippie. he 7 went to an est meeting for two hours. 8 also, in the 1970s -- i put down 1970s, 9 because i think that is what barbara said. but 10 mrs. skolnick was uncertain. we do not even 11 know for sure the date of the meditation. 12 if you think of that, in the entire 13 decade, all he did to quit was go to one 14 meeting. remember, he quit est. he did not 15 quit smoking. and he did meditation for a 16 certain period of time. 17 what about the '80s, ten more years? 18 what about the '80s? we do not know. 19 mrs. skolnick said he would put a plastic 20 cigarette in his mouth for one or two months. 21 she said he might have gone to hypnosis. she is 22 not positive. i just put down an hour. she 23 said he might have gone. 24 now, you add this all up and you are 25 looking at 45 years, a couple hours at one 1 meeting, one hour maybe at hypnosis, a month or 2 two of putting a plastic cigarette, and then 3 meditation. 4 and the evidence on meditation is people 5 are not even certain if that was directly to 6 quit smoking. 7 and the evidence from mrs. skolnick is he 8 never cut down. she did not observe him 9 cutting down smoking, certainly not quitting 10 during meditation. 11 so that is it, for 45 years. 12 and dr. cummings said that a smoker who 13 is truly motivated to quit would throw away his 14 cigarettes, and we know mr. skolnick never did 15 that. throw away ashtrays. we know 16 mr. skolnick did not do that. 17 dr. cummings, this is the expert that 18 they picked, said if you were motivated, you 19 would pick a quit date. no evidence 20 mr. skolnick did that. 21 dr. cummings said you would consult a 22 doctor. now, he went to lots of doctors, we 23 saw the medical records, you heard a lot of 24 different doctors, we know he went to doctors 25 when he had a problem. whether it was colon 1 cancer, finding a tumor in his lung. we know 2 he went to doctors. 3 but no one ever suggested that he asked 4 one of his doctors at any time for any help in 5 quitting smoking. and that is his right. no 6 one is blaming him. he had that right. he had 7 a choice like everyone to use a legal product 8 or quit. 9 but when plaintiffs say he really wanted 10 to quit, why did not he ever ask a doctor for 11 help? why did not he ask his own wife how she 12 quit successfully? why did not he take the 13 steps that their expert says a truly motivated 14 person would do? 15 here's the things he did not do. we know 16 he would not even watch the cessation program, 17 the tv program with his wife. he did not throw 18 away his cigarettes or his ashtrays. he never 19 asked his wife, how did you do it? he never 20 asked a doctor. he never went to an actual 21 smoking cessation program. 22 you know, his daughter barbara said it 23 took her two years to convince him to go to 24 est, and supposedly she said he thought est was 25 a way to quit smoking. 1 so, again, if you really want to quit and 2 you think this meeting called est is a way to 3 do it, why would you procrastinate for two 4 years? does not that sound more like someone 5 who does not want to quit? 6 but we do know he never went to a smoking 7 cessation program. and when nicotine gum was 8 out, he never tried that either. 9 you have heard the evidence on what 10 mr. skolnick actually did. let me ask you to 11 consider this. if i told you that i was on a 12 serious exercise program, i really wanted to 13 get myself fit, and you asked me what did you 14 do, and i said last year i went on the 15 treadmill for two hours or i dieted for two 16 hours or i went to the gym -- 17 mr. schlesinger: excuse me, judge, 18 objection. 19 the court: sustained. do not make it 20 personal, counsel. 21 mr. belasic: all right. 22 think about this. if someone exercised 23 once in a year, if someone went on a diet for a 24 couple times a year, would it be reasonable to 25 conclude that that person, the person who just 1 exercised once in a year, was seriously 2 motivated to exercise? was seriously motivated 3 to lose weight? 4 if someone said that in the entire time 5 in the 1960s, all i did was go to a two-hour 6 weight watcher meeting; the other nine days, 7 364 days, i did nothing. of course no one 8 would say that that person was motivated or 9 they were making a serious and persistent 10 effort. 11 yet in this lawsuit, under the 12 plaintiff's theory, it is somehow different for 13 a smoker. that they say that if someone did 14 one thing in a decade or meditated for a few 15 months or even a year in 45 years, that we are 16 supposed to believe that that person for 45 17 years was motivated and successful in quitting. 18 if this was not a tobacco lawsuit and you 19 just compared it to real world efforts, what 20 we would say is over the course of 45 years, there 21 is very little evidence that mr. skolnick was 22 doing any serious effort to quit. 23 and, remember, that even what he was 24 doing, the evidence is he was telling people 25 i'm doing it to cut down, and cutting down 1 is not quitting. saying you are cutting down is 2 saying you are continuing to smoke. 3 eventually he needed to stop smoking. 4 and he did not do the efforts that his own 5 expert, that his own expert said would show he 6 was motivated. 7 dr. burns agreed with me. he said while 8 he talked about cutting down, no one actually 9 observed him actually cutting down, at least 10 for any significant amount of time, in the 11 '50s, the '60s, the '70s, or '80s, and that is 12 their expert. 13 i did not have to bring someone. there is 14 no dispute over who he favors. 15 dr. burns has been paid $2.5 million to 16 testify in these lawsuits for plaintiffs who 17 sue a company, and he agreed that no one ever 18 saw mr. skolnick cutting down, period, during 19 those 40 years. 20 and barbara agreed. that is his daughter. 21 there is no reason that his daughter would not 22 tell the truth about something like that. 23 now, we know that there is no direct 24 evidence of what happened to mr. skolnick 25 before 1947. dr. burns told you that he 1 thought mr. skolnick had become addicted before 2 1947. let me ask you this: to what? what was 3 he smoking before 1947? was it an 4 r.j. reynolds brand? was it a philip morris 5 brand? did r.j. reynolds do something to 6 addict mr. skolnick before 1947? 7 dr. burns said he probably was addicted. 8 did philip morris do something wrong? 9 there is no evidence in this case that 10 r.j. reynolds or philip morris did anything 11 wrong to cause mr. skolnick to smoke. we do not 12 know where he smoked. we do not know what he 13 smoked. there is no evidence of when he 14 started and what brand it was, and there is no 15 evidence that either defendant caused him to 16 become addicted. 17 because dr. burns said when mrs. skolnick 18 met him, he was already addicted. 19 now, one of the things you have agreed to 20 do is to decide this case solely on the 21 evidence. i would submit to you with no 22 evidence whatsoever, it is simply a guess. how 23 do we know what he was smoking in 1942? or 24 1938? or 1940? 25 we do not know. we do not know if he was 1 smoking a cigarette made by another defendant. 2 of course the plaintiffs, it would be very 3 convenient for the plaintiffs for you to just 4 assume that reynolds must have done something, 5 but that is not evidence. 6 and it would be convenient to assume, 7 well, maybe he tried a philip morris brand in 8 the 1940s, but there would be no evidence. and 9 they do not dispute this. 10 mr. schlesinger: objection, judge. 11 the court: overruled. 12 mr. belasic: there is no evidence what 13 he smoked or who addicted him. and yet now 14 they want to say, well, it was addiction to 15 reynolds' products. 16 really? if he was already addicted for 17 years, according to dr. burns, if addiction 18 means what they say it means, that somehow he is 19 compelled and caused to develop cancer. 20 if he was already addicted. if 21 r.j. reynolds and philip morris had gone out of 22 business in 1947, had not even existed, 23 according to dr. burns, he was already 24 addicted. 25 and there was no evidence that he did 1 anything before that time period that was 2 wrong. including lung cancer. 3 remember that when dr. proctor, their 4 historian, came up, i asked him some historical 5 questions. 6 and knowing that there is no evidence in 7 this case, no evidence in this case at all that 8 r.j. reynolds or philip morris did anything 9 wrong that caused mr. skolnick to become 10 addicted, or caused him to smoke before this 11 1947 period, i asked him: when does 12 dr. proctor, their expert, he is been paid more 13 than a million dollars, he made $100,000 just 14 the last month to testify. 15 he said: well, you should have warned 16 about lung cancer in the mid 1950s. but he would 17 been smoking we know for a long time. and 18 dr. burns said he was already addicted. 19 addicted when there is no evidence that 20 r.j. reynolds did it. 21 and no matter how much sympathy you feel, 22 no matter how angry you may feel at some of 23 these documents, and they look ridiculous now 24 in the 2000s, no matter how angry you may feel, 25 you still have to decide the case on the 1 evidence. 2 and they have not presented a shred of 3 evidence that r.j. reynolds made this man 4 become addicted, whatever their definition is, 5 or philip morris did. there is simply a blank 6 before 1947. 7 and dr. burns comes here and says, oh, he 8 was addicted years before. i think he may have 9 said as far back as eight to ten years. 10 but dr. burns did not say it was reynolds' 11 fault, because no one has that evidence. their 12 own expert. they could not meet their burden of 13 proof. and because of that, you cannot vote yes 14 on the first question. 15 it cannot be a direct cause. not when 16 they admit he was -- that he was addicted 17 already, and there is no evidence that it was 18 from anything that r.j. reynolds or philip 19 morris did. 20 one of the last things i would like you 21 to think about on this topic is we know 22 mr. skolnick and mrs. skolnick made different 23 choices. 24 even though they made different choices, 25 they lived together in the same environment, 1 saw the same information, same advertising. 2 they had the same cigarettes, whatever was in 3 the smoke. the same nicotine went into them. 4 but they made a different choice, and 5 they met a different outcome. 6 so mr. skolnick got lung cancer. they 7 say it is primary lung cancer. they say it is 8 from smoking. 9 mrs. skolnick made a different choice. 10 she never got lung cancer. 11 everything else that r.j. reynolds did, 12 good or bad, everything else that philip morris 13 did, good or bad, was exactly the same for 14 mrs. and mrs. skolnick. 15 so how do we explain the difference? why 16 would one get lung cancer and the other did not, 17 when r.j. reynolds and philip morris acted 18 exactly the same? 19 it is obvious. they made different 20 choices. and that choice, the choice to 21 continue smoking that mr. skolnick made and the 22 choice to quit that mrs. skolnick made, that is 23 cause, one hundred percent. that is the one hundred percent 24 difference. everything else was the same. 25 one got lung cancer because he made a 1 different choice than his wife. 2 you know, even the recent surgeon 3 general's report in 2010 agrees to this extent. 4 the surgeon general says -- and this is one of 5 the manuals they keep showing you -- it says: 6 that tobacco dependence accounts for only a 7 modest amount of variation in the risk of 8 relapse. 9 when you look at people and people who 10 do not quit and relapse and continue smoking, is 11 it addiction that is the direct cause? is it 12 addiction that is a substantial cause? no. 13 they say tobacco dependence accounts for only a 14 modest amount. 15 well, what is the reason? look what the 16 surgeon general says. it is consistent with the 17 notion that relapse, going back to smoking, is 18 a function of multiple person factors; that 19 it is the person, that it is the choice. 20 a hundred percent of the difference in 21 the outcome, the reason that mrs. skolnick is 22 here today and the reason that she is now saying 23 that she should get $9 million because her 24 husband made the wrong choice was, in fact, the 25 choice. 1 the companies did nothing different to 2 her or to anyone else. 3 now, i will show you question 2. 4 for all those reasons you should vote no 5 on question 1. addiction was simply not a 6 direct cause, even if they could prove the 7 medical link between the smoking and the 8 cancer. 9 if you answer yes, you will go to 10 question 2. and you are going to be asked to 11 apportion negligence and to put this percentage 12 there. and remember, the plaintiff has already 13 admitted that leo skolnick's actions were a 14 partial legal cause. 15 now, mr. hammer said, well, only 20 16 percent. so all of these choices, all of the 17 years that he made those choices, they are still 18 going to say it is eighty percent the fault of the 19 manufacturer of the legal product, and they 20 want you to say only twenty percent. 21 well, we know that they would not be 22 admitting that mr. skolnick caused his own 23 death if he did not have the ability to quit, 24 and if he could not have quit at a time that 25 prevented his death. 1 we know dr. burns says he quits by the 2 '70s, more likely than not he does not get lung 3 cancer. could he have quit by the '70s, his 4 experts say he could have. 5 the clerk: you have used one hour. 6 mr. belasic: now, let us go back to what 7 i'm talking about here. even if r.j. reynolds 8 and philip morris go out of business, does 9 anyone think mr. skolnick would not smoke? 10 we know he already smoked another brand. 11 chesterfields, made by liggett. we know that. 12 mrs. skolnick said -- 13 mr. schlesinger: objection, judge. 14 may i approach? 15 the court: yes, sir. [#deleted sidebar#] 24 the court: okay. the objection is 25 sustained. 1 you may proceed, sir. 2 mr. belasic: nothing that r.j. reynolds 3 or philip morris could have done would have 4 prevented mr. skolnick's death. this was a man 5 that wanted to continue to smoke. 6 remember what their own experts, 7 dr. cummings and dr. burns said. it sounds 8 stupid, but if you want to quit, you have to 9 choose to quit first. you have to want to quit 10 first. that is what they say. that is their 11 expert. 12 only he had the ability to prevent his 13 death. r.j. reynolds and philip morris, they 14 could not send someone from north carolina or 15 somewhere to stop him from smoking. he had to 16 choose. he had to make the choice. 17 his wife made that choice, even though 18 whatever r.j. reynolds was doing was exactly 19 the same for her. she made the choice. she 20 quit. now she is here to sue, because her 21 husband made the wrong choice. 22 and the only difference in outcome that 23 we have seen, what is the reason that 24 mr. skolnick got lung cancer if you believe 25 it is caused by smoking, that the plaintiffs are 1 right? what is the reason he got lung cancer 2 and his wife did not. same brands, same many 3 years of smoking, same information. 4 well, it is because he made a different 5 choice, and that choice did not cause twenty percent 6 of his cancer, and his choice did not cause 50 7 percent of his cancer. that choice is 100 8 percent responsible for the difference. it has 9 to be. 10 because there is no difference in what 11 r.j. reynolds did that could have affected 12 mrs. skolnick and her husband. the difference 13 in outcome is because they went in two 14 different paths, and he made a different 15 choice. 16 for that reason, you should find 100 17 percent it is unfair to now have mrs. skolnick 18 second-guess her husband's decision and say 19 that she should be rewarded with $9 million for 20 that decision. 21 that is because of the different decisions 22 that we saw repeatedly on the decision tree. 23 now let us go to questions 3 and 4. 24 questions 3 and 4 on the verdict form -- 25 oh, sorry, i think counsel is saying i should 1 fill this out. 2 leo skolnick's choice, as proven by the 3 difference between outcome, between him and his 4 wife, was one hundred percent responsible. what philip 5 morris and reynolds did was the same to barbara 6 (sic) skolnick as to leo skolnick. the only 7 difference was leo skolnick's different choice. 8 now, questions 3 and 4 talk about whether 9 or not something that r.j. reynolds or a 10 tobacco company said or philip morris or a 11 tobacco company said caused mr. skolnick's 12 death. 13 one thing i want to point out here is, 14 when the plaintiffs say that they are taking 20 15 percent responsibility or they ask you to take 16 twenty percent responsibility, you should know that 17 that would not apply to questions 3 or 4; that 18 if you voted yes on questions 3 and 4, that 19 admission of responsibility, that twenty percent, 20 fifty percent, one hundred percent, even if it is 100 21 percent, that would not apply if you find yes. 22 now let us look at what the judge is going 23 to tell you you have to consider. 24 you have to determine whether leo 25 skolnick justifiably relied on a statement of 1 material fact made by each defendant that 2 intentionally omitted material information 3 about the health effects or the addictive 4 nature of smoking cigarettes. 5 so basically you have to find did he rely 6 on something that philip morris said or 7 r.j. reynolds said that omitted material 8 information. 9 but here's the big thing. may 5th, 1982. 10 when did you ever hear that date in this trial? 11 did you hear it in opening statement from the 12 plaintiffs? did you hear it from any of their 13 witnesses? may 5th, 1982? 14 well, because you are going to hear it 15 now. this is on the verdict form. the entire 16 time of this trial, this was going to be the 17 question you were going to ask. did he rely on 18 something after may 5th, 1982. 19 now think about how many days, how many 20 days we spent in this trial talking about the 21 1950s, or the 1960s, or the 1920s, or the 22 1930s. think about how many hours they played 23 that video of dr. cummings talking about ctr in 24 the '50s and '60s. think about the two days 25 that dr. proctor was on the stand. 1 may 5th, '82. the judge is going to 2 instruct you he -- he has instructed you. when 3 you decide whether he relied to his detriment 4 on a statement, you may not consider evidence 5 of statements, concealment, or other conduct 6 that occurred before may 5th, 1982. 7 they wasted your time, ladies and 8 gentlemen. we spent a week talking about 9 conduct before may 5, 1982. 10 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor. 11 the court: sustained, counsel. 12 mr. belasic: none of that, none of that 13 evidence is relevant to questions 3 or 4. none 14 of it. 15 judge crow is instructing you that 16 mr. skolnick -- you cannot find that 17 mr. skolnick reasonably relied upon a statement 18 if he knew it was false or if its falsity was 19 known to him or if the fact that it was 20 concealed was already known to him. 21 now we know that for 20 years, he was 22 being warned by his family. he was being told 23 by his son, his daughter, and his wife that the 24 health effects of smoking were dangerous. he 25 heard it from the surgeon general. 1 and we know from his daughter that 2 there is no doubt that he believed that it 3 caused cancer, no doubt that it was dangerous. 4 we know that when he responded to them he 5 did not say, hey, i do not believe it, i'm 6 relying on a company statement. he said, i'm 7 going to try to quit. his own daughter says 8 there is no doubt. 9 there is no evidence -- there is no 10 evidence that after may 5th, 1982, that 11 mr. skolnick thought that smoking was safe. 12 remember his sister died in '78. 13 and remember what their own expert 14 dr. burns said, he said that was irrefutable. 15 irrefutable demonstration to mr. skolnick 16 personally. he knew that smoking could cause 17 lung cancer. that is '78. 18 but the truth is, his daughter barbara 19 said there is no doubt he knew it could cause 20 lung cancer in '64. and this is the cutoff. 21 this is the cutoff that applies, and it is the 22 cutoff that makes all that evidence, all those 23 statements and videos of old men on television, 24 irrelevant to questions 3 and questions 4. 25 you cannot consider anything other than 1 something after may 5th, 1982. and there is no 2 dispute -- there is no dispute that by 1982, 3 he would known that smoking could cause lung cancer 4 for almost 20 years, there is no dispute. 5 even mrs. skolnick said that everyone 6 knew it was dangerous by the '70s. 7 here is what dr. burns said. 1975, seven 8 years before this 1982 cutoff. more americans 9 knew cigarette smoking was more dangerous for 10 them than knew the name of the president of the 11 country. 12 dr. burns, again, this is their expert, 13 their expert that they chose, '81. so one year 14 before the cutoff. he said: it is not that 15 smokers do not know the risk. 95 percent of 16 them are thoroughly aware of the health 17 dangers. ninety percent realize their health could 18 be affected. 19 now that is countrywide. when it comes 20 to mr. skolnick, we know from his loved ones 21 that he would known back since the '60s, and he 22 believed, he believed since the '60s, that 23 smoking could cause lung cancer. 24 what do they do? do they have any 25 evidence after may 5, 1982, mr. skolnick saw 1 something? do they have any evidence at all 2 that he said, wow, now after 20 years of 3 thinking that smoking could cause lung cancer 4 and wanting to quit, now i think smoking is 5 safe. they have no such evidence. 6 so what do they do? they talk about 7 filters. here is what their own expert said. 8 dr. proctor. he said filters came out of the 9 early '50s. 10 did mr. skolnick rush to switch to a 11 filter? no. mrs. skolnick said they did not 12 switch to filters until pall malls came out in 13 1966. and their own expert agrees. 14 so this idea that he had been tricked by 15 filters and he was trying to do it, it does not 16 make sense, it does not comport with what their 17 own experts say. 18 look what dr. proctor said about the 19 pall mall ads. he agreed. i showed him the 20 ads. those ads did not claim that filters were 21 safer. that is the brand they picked. that is 22 the filter they picked. those ads did not say 23 safety. they talked about flavor. 24 he is the one that said that american 25 tobacco, american tobacco made the pall malls, 1 that they were the most honest company on 2 filters. 3 here is these ads. these are ads from 4 before the filters came out. look what they 5 say: the long cigarette, long on flavor, 6 they are mild. 7 look what the filtered ad says. does 8 this filtered ad say it is safe, it reduces your 9 risk? do not quit? 10 is this the kind of thing that told 11 mr. skolnick that he did not have to quit? no. 12 it is the exact same thing. the long cigarette 13 that is long on flavor, outstanding and they are 14 mild. 15 and when i showed those to dr. proctor, 16 he agreed. that is the company and that is the 17 brand that said nothing about safety. 18 dr. proctor agreed. he said honest. i did not 19 use the word. he said american tobacco company 20 and their pall mall filter ads were honest. 21 and there is no other evidence. there is 22 no other evidence. no one here seriously came 23 in and said, in 1983, mr. skolnick thought that 24 smoking was safe. 25 no one even made that claim. because the 1 family, the people that knew him best had 2 already admitted that at least by the '70s, and 3 as early as '64, that he already thought it 4 could cause lung cancer. 5 now, i asked dr. burns, even if, let us 6 say, he saw something in 1982 or '83 from a 7 tobacco company, let us say. or if he did not 8 see it and he quit, what would have happened? 9 dr. burns agreed that if he quit after 10 this date, if he quit after the 1978 cutoff, 11 remember dr. burns said, i hate to call it a 12 cutoff. but he agreed. 13 if he quit after 1978, he said more 14 likely than not he gets lung cancer in 1993. 15 that is the only evidence. that is the only 16 evidence on what would happen if mr. skolnick 17 had quit after that date. 18 mr. schlesinger: your honor, i object. 19 because it misstates the evidence. that -- may 20 i approach? 21 the court: yes, sir. 22 (the following discussion was held at 23 sidebar:) 24 the court: can i see the chart? 25 mr. schlesinger: that is not from the 1 testimony. 2 the court: hang on. just a minute. 3 mr. schlesinger: we have the entire 4 transcript. if he wants to quote from it, 5 that is fine. we can draw inferences to the 6 evidence. but this is the second time they are 7 saying something the witness did not say. it is 8 not a matter of i'm drawing an inference. he 9 did not say that. 10 the court: specifically what did he say 11 that you are saying? 12 mr. schlesinger: he just said that if he 13 quit -- if he quit after 1978, he still gets 14 cancer in 1983. it is absolutely not what the 15 witness said, at all. did not say it. 16 he said he could not say with a reasonable 17 degree of medical probability he would not have 18 developed cancer at some time. he did not say 19 that any time he did not quit after '78, he was 20 going to get cancer in '83. utterly false. 21 in this case, a wrongful death case. and 22 your honor knows this from what you used to do 23 for a living is, a wrongful death action is 24 about wrongful death on the day you die. 25 that is what the case is about. on the day you 1 die. 2 if the wrongful death occurs on that day, 3 it is a wrongful death case. it is their burden 4 to say when it would have occurred. he does not 5 have that testimony from that witness, and i 6 challenge him to show you in the record that he 7 does. that is too far, judge. 8 mr. belasic: flat out wrong. the 9 questions i gave to him were more likely than 10 not. 11 first he said more likely than not if he 12 quits before '78, he avoids his lung cancer in 13 '93. then i say, what if he quits after '78? 14 he then cannot say more likely than not that he 15 would have avoided lung cancer in 1993. 16 i asked then asked him about 1982. 17 all of their questions, they then came 18 back on redirect and said, well, does not each 19 cigarette contribute? could it have 20 accelerated it? might he have lived a little 21 longer? none of those were to a more likely 22 than not. it is not an inference; it is what he 23 said. 24 the court: i'm going to overrule the 25 objection. okay? thank you. 1 (sidebar discussion concluded, and the 2 following was held in open court:) 3 the court: ladies and gentlemen, let me 4 remind you, you are the finders of fact in this 5 case. what the attorneys say is their 6 understanding of what the testimony has been, 7 but you are the one who determines what the 8 facts were. 9 go ahead, counsel. 10 mr. belasic: there is a reason i made 11 this chart with dr. burns, so you could see 12 what dr. burns was saying. dr. burns did not 13 dispute this. 14 if he quits before '78, more likely than 15 not he avoids his cancer in '93. if he quits 16 after, and i asked him particularly what if he 17 quits in '82, can you say that more likely than 18 not he avoids his cancer? he said no. 19 that is the only evidence about when he 20 gets cancer. where is that important? why is 21 that important? 22 well, because they do not just have to 23 show that he relied on a statement. they have 24 to show that relying on a statement caused his 25 death; that somehow something he read in 1983 1 or 1984 was the legal cause of his death. 2 now, dr. burns said even if he quit then, 3 he could not say he would have avoided it. it is 4 their burden of proof. 5 but all of this is much ado about 6 nothing. because everyone agrees that by 7 may 5, 1982, he believed smoking was dangerous. 8 he had thought smoking caused cancer since the 9 '60s, and this is what changes it. may 5th, 10 1982. 11 there is nothing in this record that says 12 that anything after that makes a difference. 13 nothing in this record that says after '82, he 14 thought smoking was safe. it does not matter 15 how many filters he smoked. 16 nobody is claiming that he did not know 17 those filters were dangerous. they had the 18 exact same warning, including the lung cancer 19 warning, that every other pack had. 20 so you should vote no on both 3 and 4. 21 and it is because of testimony from barbara 22 skolnick, testimony from dr. burns. there is no 23 doubt dr. burns says it was irrefutable by 1978 24 when sunny died, when his sister died, 25 irrefutable that he knew that smoking could 1 cause lung cancer. 2 i want to talk briefly about damages. 3 they are asking for $9 million. 4 $9 million because mr. skolnick continued to 5 smoke and passed away, while his wife made a 6 decision to stop. and as they said, she is 7 healthy today. 8 remember that when mr. skolnick died in 9 1993 -- first of all, that was 20 years ago. 10 when he died, he was 75 years old. 75 years 11 old. 12 and you heard talk about life expectancy 13 from mr. hammer. did you ever hear a shred of 14 evidence on what a 75-year-old man's life 15 expectancy was? remember, he was a 75-year-old 16 man who already had colon cancer. 17 was there a shred of evidence in this 18 case what the life expectancy of a 75-year-old 19 man with colon cancer was? you know. 20 when mrs. skolnick testified, it was 21 extremely emotional, and there is no doubt she 22 loved her husband. in the record, it appears 23 he was a wonderful man. but you agreed to put 24 your sympathy aside. 25 so when you talk about life expectancy, 1 obviously it sounds cold. but you understand, 2 i have to address this, because mr. hammer is 3 talking about life expectancy, and he is talking 4 about in the future. 5 you know, when mr. skolnick died, he was 6 75. that was 20 years ago. today he would be 7 95 years old, and they wanted another five 8 years of future damages. they are basically 9 saying that he would have lived to be 100 10 without a shred of evidence. 11 mr. schlesinger: your honor, object. 12 this goes to mrs. skolnick. i object. 13 the court: overruled. 14 mr. belasic: they want five years of 15 future damages, until 2018. five years from 16 now is 2018. 17 he was born in 1918. he was 75 when he 18 died, and there is no -- why -- did a doctor 19 come and testify? could they have asked his 20 doctors? 21 mr. schlesinger: your honor, may i 22 approach? 23 (the following discussion was held at 24 sidebar:) 25 the court: yes, sir. 1 mr. schlesinger: the damages are 2 mrs. skolnick's damages for her life expectancy 3 from this point forward, not for his life 4 expectancy. no such claim. future damages. 5 mr. belasic: but -- 6 the court: excuse me. excuse me. go 7 ahead. 8 mr. schlesinger: in other words, we 9 did not say he would be 95 or 100 or anything 10 like that. we got the future damages line in 11 because mrs. skolnick is a hale woman, and 12 she is well met, and she is 86, and she has her 13 future pain and suffering for the years she 14 lost leo, regardless of whether he is alive or 15 not. 16 the court: as i understand the law, in 17 determining duration of such losses you may 18 consider the joint life expectancy of 19 mr. skolnick and mrs. skolnick together. 20 so that is joint life expectancy. you 21 cannot get to the rest of her life if he was not 22 going to live. let me give you a classic 23 example. suppose he was dying of some other 24 disease, but died of lung cancer before. you 25 do not get her life -- it is joint life 1 expectancy is the measure of damages. 2 it says ... companionship, protection, 3 mental pain and suffering, resulting ... in 4 determination of duration of losses, you may 5 consider the joint life expectancy of 6 mr. skolnick and mrs. skolnick together with 7 the other evidence in the case. 8 you cannot get loss of companionship if he 9 was not going to be alive. i do not mean to 10 argue. 11 mr. schlesinger: okay. my recollection 12 was -- 13 mr. belasic: i think we have argued for 14 that. but furthermore, they were more direct. 15 mr. hammer said that he would have been able to 16 see his grandchildren's graduation. their 17 graduations, in 2012 and 2013? 18 the court: i'm going to overrule the 19 objection. 20 (sidebar discussion concluded, and the 21 following was held in open court:) 22 mr. belasic: as i was saying, there is 23 not a shred of evidence that he would live to 24 be 95, 100, 90, 85. he was 75. he had a 25 history of lung cancer. 1 everyone here wishes they would live 2 forever. wished that he would have had a long 3 life. but they have a burden of proof. they 4 do not just get to say look at mrs. skolnick, 5 she is healthy, and say that he would have 6 lived. that is not evidence. 7 mr. hammer wants you to believe that he 8 could have lived for many, many years. but 9 where is the evidence? 10 three doctors took the stand: dr. burns, 11 dr. barry davis, and the initial doctor, the 12 radiologist. and there was no testimony. no 13 one even presented a shred of evidence. 14 and yet that is what this $9 million. 15 $9 million, because now, totally 16 understandably, she regrets the decision that 17 her husband made to use a legal product. but 18 there is not any evidence on that. 19 let me talk finally about -- let me talk 20 finally about question 6. i think i've lost my 21 clicker. 22 question 6 is this question of is 23 mrs. skolnick entitled not just to the 24 $9 million, but for additional damages. please 25 state whether you find by clear and convincing 1 evidence that punitive damages are warranted. 2 and you saw the jury instruction. he 3 read it. it had to be gross and flagrant to 4 show a reckless disregard of human life. it 5 said there has to show an entire lack of care 6 that wanton and recklessly disregarded the 7 safety. 8 well, look, their main argument is that 9 somehow mr. skolnick was deceived, and they have 10 said for 50 years there was this conspiracy to 11 conceal information. was the information about 12 the risks of smoking, was it really secret? 13 and what i mean is not that did the 14 tobacco companies go out and say some 15 confession that mr. hammer said. but was it 16 secret? 17 if you did not live in a tobacco company, 18 were you able to know that smoking could be 19 dangerous or addictive? 20 you saw all this stuff. one hundred 21 years ago, the florida health department. no 22 help from the tobacco company, saying 23 addictive. a hundred years ago. it was not a 24 secret. 25 you can argue about what should they have 1 said, when should they have said it, should 2 they have acted in a different way. 3 the tobacco companies today will not even 4 disagree with that. you can argue that. but 5 to claim it is secret. this is 100 years ago. 6 1915, that is 100 -- 98 years ago. 7 all the things from reader's digest. you 8 probably thought at one point this was a trial 9 about who could put up the most reader's digest 10 articles. but the point was, it was the single 11 most popular magazine, it was the common source 12 of information for ordinary people that were not 13 scientists, that were not lawyers, that were not 14 tobacco company executives. 15 even as far back as 1924, we saw that it 16 was saying that smoking could cause cancer. 17 how did they know if the tobacco companies had 18 this huge conspiracy to conceal. 19 mr. schlesinger: objection, judge, we 20 have findings on this. 21 the court: overruled. i'm going to 22 allow it. 23 mr. belasic: of course, as dr. proctor 24 says, there is no conspiracy before 1954. as 25 dr. proctor said, he did not even think the 1 tobacco companies had a duty to warn then. and 2 yet mr. skolnick was smoking. 3 we do not know what brand. and dr. burns 4 says mr. skolnick was already addicted. 5 so how could this conspiracy that did not 6 start until after this man was addicted, that 7 did not start until after this man was addicted 8 to a brand we do not know, made by a company 9 that we do not know is r.j. reynolds or philip 10 morris, how did that cause his harm? 11 and remember, the instructions say that 12 when you consider whether to award punitives, 13 it has to be for conduct that caused the damage 14 to the plaintiff, in this case to mr. skolnick. 15 not for something else that caused harm to 16 others. the instructions say you have to look 17 at what caused harm to him. 18 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor. 19 the court: sustained. 20 mr. belasic: so reader's digest, 1950. 21 mr. schlesinger: your honor, i move to 22 strike the last comment. 23 the court: the jury should disregard the 24 last comment. 25 go ahead. 1 mr. belasic: let us go back to the jury 2 instructions. punitive damages are warranted. 3 this is what judge crow has given you: if you 4 find by clear and convincing evidence that the 5 conduct causing loss to the plaintiff. that is 6 the express black letter instructions. 7 you have to determine if the conduct 8 causing loss to the plaintiff. 9 so not some brand that he did not smoke, 10 not some camel that has a pink or an orange 11 box. it has to be evidence that relates and 12 causes loss to the plaintiff. not injuries to 13 others. that is the instruction. 14 now, it was not even disputed that all 15 throughout the '50s, there was all kinds of 16 public awareness. it was in life magazine. we 17 know that they had -- they had life magazine in 18 their house, they had reader's digest in their 19 house in the 1950s. we know that he was an 20 avid newspaper reader. 21 here you remember this, they just talked 22 about claude teague. and again, 23 mr. schlesinger brought up their latin term 24 sine qua non. 25 well, here is a 1950s article written by 1 a boxer, not a chemist, not a tobacco company 2 executive. a boxer, 22 years earlier, was 3 writing in the most popular magazine in america 4 that nicotine was the essential ingredient. 5 this was not secret. they want to take a 6 sentence and say, oh, this looks bad, now we 7 get 9 million. that is not a secret. that was 8 common knowledge in the most obvious place in 9 the world, reader's digest. 10 we know that he was an avid reader of the 11 new york times, the new york newsday on long 12 island, and sometimes the new york post. it 13 was widely covered over and over and over 14 again. 15 we know that as a result, millions and 16 millions of people quit when they saw the 17 warnings. millions and millions of people 18 quit. we know that more than 50 million have 19 quit. 20 and they quit on their own. look at 21 this, ninety percent quit on their own. they 22 did not need -- they talk about today you have 23 drugs or chantix or other things, ninety percent of 24 those people were quitting on their own. 25 that is what mr. skolnick could do. 1 that is what their experts admitted, that not 2 just smokers in general, but mr. skolnick could 3 have done that. 4 now they brought up some charges, they 5 say you tricked the surgeon general. we know 6 that the surgeon general relied on a 6,000 -- 7 on this monograph that was provided. he 8 actually thanked the companies. 9 we know that every one of the 10 constituents and carcinogens that were listed 11 in the surgeon general's report were provided 12 by the tobacco companies. they were not keeping 13 a secret what the chemicals were when they did 14 smoke analysis, and that was from dr. proctor. 15 we know from dr. proctor that it was a 16 legitimate dispute at the time, that a lot of 17 physicians were not prepared to understand the 18 statistical data, that it was not wrong to say, 19 hey, we do not think statistics by themselves 20 are proof. even dr. proctor admitted that. 21 the surgeon general says that here. the 22 surgeon general's report said that statistics 23 by themselves could not prove cause and effect. 24 and yet time and time again, when they 25 would show you some statement, a statement that 1 mr. -- a statement that mr. skolnick never 2 heard, it would be about whether there was 3 enough proof, whether statistics are needed, 4 whether there was animal evidence. 5 the surgeon general himself said that 6 there was a debate over this. 7 they mentioned polonium -- 8 the clerk: you have used about an hour and 9 a half, sir. 10 mr. belasic: okay. thank you. 11 they mentioned polonium. and they had a 12 clever drawing of a pack of cigarettes, and it 13 was a smokestack. obviously that was meant to 14 imply it was like sylvania. polonium 210. 15 i do not know if you remember who 16 testified on polonium 210. that was 17 dr. proctor, their witness that has been paid 18 800,000 in the last three years. 19 and here's what he said: polonium comes 20 from fertilizer, in the ground from fertilizer. 21 he said there are only trace amounts. he 22 admitted that the surgeon general studied it, 23 and that the polonium in smoke that comes from 24 fertilizer is not important to cancer. 25 and really important, their favorite 1 surgeon general's report, the one they go to 2 over and over again, 2010, says that filters 3 remove significant portions of the polonium. 4 remember that when they say filters are a 5 fraud. that the one thing in smoke they 6 complain about, the one thing in smoke that the 7 surgeon general says is not important to 8 cancer, they claim filters cannot do anything, 9 polonium is so important, the current surgeon 10 general's report says that it does remove it. 11 we are not making this up. 12 here is what we showed dr. proctor. this 13 is the surgeon general's report, polonium 210. 14 we talked about the range is 1 to 50 15 picocuries. 16 i asked dr. proctor, and he agreed that 17 in the amount mr. skolnick did, it would be 18 about 4. so almost at the bottom end of this 19 range, barely above zero. 20 and look at what the surgeon general 21 says: of some importance, only in the case of 22 relatively high concentration, but not 23 important at reported levels. 24 and dr. proctor agreed with me. he 25 did not dispute it. they did not present any 1 evidence that the tiny amount of polonium that 2 comes from fertilizers that are used not just 3 to grow tobacco, but to grow lettuce and 4 tomatoes and other things fertilizers are used 5 for. they did not present a shred of evidence 6 on that. 7 but they want you to be scared about 8 polonium 210. the surgeon general and their 9 own expert said, quote, "not important." 10 they talked about crack cocaine. i'm 11 surprised they brought that up because i -- 12 crack nicotine. 13 because i asked dr. proctor about that. 14 i said: wait a second. crack nicotine? 15 that is the chapter of his book and this ph. 16 i said: did not the surgeon general find 17 that the ph of the normal smoke is below this 18 level, 6.5? it has only the bound nicotine, 19 none of this free nicotine? 20 he admitted that. this is what the 21 surgeon general found. 22 that was a snazzy chapter title, crack 23 nicotine, but dr. proctor did not fight me. he 24 admitted that in normal cigarettes, mainstream 25 commercial cigarettes, you do not have, quote, 1 "free nicotine." 2 and this is the surgeon general looking 3 at it. not tobacco company evidence. so 4 that is just something they toss out there to 5 scare you. 6 dr. burns said that even today, the 7 cigarettes today are not more addictive; that 8 they have done studies. the people that are 9 smoking today -- there is still plenty of people 10 that enjoy smoking and choose to smoke. 11 the people that smoke today are no more 12 addicted than the ones who stopped. and, in 13 fact, there is a higher percentage of occasional 14 smokers. and the new generation, their 15 behavior is consistent with less, rather than 16 more addiction. 17 and that is dr. burns' writings. that is 18 their expert. he agreed. smokers today are 19 less addicted. 20 they have never denied that this is a 21 secret document. secret document from the 22 president of reynolds to dr. murray senkus. 23 dr. proctor knew about it, and he agreed that 24 the president of r.j. reynolds was commanding 25 his top r&d guy to say -- to cooperate with 1 others, push the work concerning tobacco and 2 health, promote the relationships with 3 government, and if there is a safer cigarette, 4 let us continue and increase our efforts. 5 that is what dr. proctor agreed. that is a 6 secret document. they were not doing that to 7 look good. internally they were telling their 8 top guy to cooperate. and, of course, they did 9 with the tobacco working group. 10 we found that for five to ten years, 11 according to dr. proctor, they made hundreds of 12 specialty-designed cigarettes in cooperation 13 with the government. it was voluntary, they 14 did not have to do it. 15 he said they looked at almost every 16 possible design, and what happened? the 17 government shut it down in 1978. 18 you can only judge the punitive damages 19 on conduct that caused his injury. and we know 20 that every single one of those things -- 21 mr. schlesinger: objection, judge. 22 the court: sustained. 23 mr. belasic: we know that every single 24 thing that r.j. reynolds or philip morris did 25 also was done in the same environment as 1 mrs. skolnick. she did not get lung cancer 2 because she made a different choice than her 3 husband in 1968. 4 so you should vote no on number 6. 5 the only way you can explain the 6 difference between the outcome for 7 mrs. skolnick and her husband -- and there is no 8 doubt she misses him and he was a wonderful 9 man, but the only way you can explain the 10 difference is their different choices. 11 it was not r.j. reynolds or philip 12 morris's conduct. 13 it is been a long trial. i know every one 14 of you made a personal sacrifice to come here 15 every day. give up your lives, your work. so 16 i mean, all i can say is you have my sincere 17 appreciation. i thank you for your attention 18 today. 19 when they get up, mr. schlesinger has 45 20 minutes for rebuttal. i do not get to respond. 21 so i ask you to think about the evidence and 22 think about maybe what i would say and what 23 evidence i would point out to counter what 24 mr. schlesinger is going to say. 25 thank you again. 22 mr. lombardi: thank you, your honor. 23 may it please the court, counsel, ladies 24 and gentlemen of the jury. good afternoon. 25 here i am, the last guy to talk to you 1 today, and i can tell you it was with mixed 2 emotions that i figured out that i was going to 3 be talking to you at quarter of 3 after you 4 heard arguments starting at about 9:00 this 5 morning. 6 so i'm going to do my very best to be 7 expeditious. i am going to do my very best not 8 to take 54 minutes, even though i could, and i 9 am going to do my very best not to be 10 repetitive. 11 but first, let me say, again, thank you 12 to y'all. we have all been here for a long time. 13 all of us are here because it is our job to be 14 here. and we know that you all have been here 15 when it is not your job to be here. you have 16 other things going on, and you have made lots of 17 sacrifices. 18 so i very much appreciate your efforts, 19 and i think the best thing i can do to show my 20 appreciation is just get going. and so i'm 21 going to do that. 22 i'm going to talk about two topics. two 23 topics. the first one is going to be filters, 24 and the second one is going to be radiation. 25 we are going to talk about filters 1 because we have heard a lot of talk about 2 filters. 3 mr. schlesinger has talked about how 4 filters do not do anything, how filters were a 5 illusion, how they were a health reassurance. 6 so i am going to talk about what the 7 facts actually are about filters. 8 and i am going to talk about radiation. 9 radiation is important for two reasons in this 10 case. the first reason radiation is important 11 is it explains. it explains why mrs. skolnick 12 said what she said in the declaration that she 13 submitted in that prior lawsuit. 14 and the second reason radiation is 15 important is because it shows that plaintiff 16 cannot sustain the burden of proof she has, the 17 burden of proof that she has, to prove that the 18 lung cancer in this case was caused by smoking 19 and not by something else. 20 so those are the two things i'm going to 21 talk about. 22 let us go to filters right away. and when 23 we started this morning, i wrote down something 24 that mr. schlesinger said. mr. schlesinger 25 said nothing was being taken out with filters. 1 nothing was being taken out with filters. 2 that is something they have said this whole 3 trial. let us talk about what the facts are. 4 what the facts actually show. 5 and let us talk about what the facts show 6 in the words of their own expert. the great 7 man of science that mr. schlesinger talked 8 about, dr. burns. 9 doctor, filters remove a fraction of 10 particulate matter from the smoke by keeping it 11 within the filter; is that right? 12 dr. burns says: that is correct. 13 what else is in the evidence? the 14 surgeon general's report from 2010. remember 15 the plaintiffs read from the surgeon general's 16 report 2010. frequently. what does it say? 17 studies have also shown that cellulose 18 acetate filter tips remove both volatile 19 nitrosamines and tsnas. filters are removing 20 things. 21 what else does the surgeon general's 22 report 2010 say? 23 the presence of a filter and the type of 24 filter used can alter the amount of polonium. 25 this is what mr. belasic was just talking 1 about. filters remove things. 2 so what does that tell us? what do we 3 know? what do we know when we look at the 4 facts about what the health effects and what 5 the history of filters were. 6 and y'all may remember, i think it was 7 back with dr. proctor, way back with 8 dr. proctor at the beginning of the case. 9 i talked to dr. proctor about how filters 10 came about and why they came about. and you 11 might remember, i actually did a handwritten 12 chart, something like this. but i turned it 13 into a chart like this. 14 and dr. proctor confirmed that what 15 happened back in the 1950s, was that scientists 16 made a link between cigarette smoking and 17 cancer. and specifically what they made a link 18 to was tar, the tar in smoke. 19 so scientists saw that there was tar in 20 smoke, and there was cancer going on. they put 21 the tar on the back of mice. you might 22 remember there was that kind of nasty picture 23 of mice in life magazine, and they put the tar 24 on them and it caused cancer. 25 so they said if tar is bad, then less is 1 better. if tar is bad, less is better, and 2 filters were going to reduce the tar. 3 and so that is what everybody was saying 4 back in the 1950s. they were saying because 5 tar is bad, let us make less of it, let us have 6 smokers get less of it, and let us use these 7 filters which we now know from dr. burns and 8 the surgeon general's report of 2010, remove 9 things, let us make it better. 10 that is what the public health community 11 said. that is what the surgeon general said. 12 that is what academics said, that is what 13 everybody said starting back in that period of 14 time. 15 and then what happened? and then what 16 happened? 17 recommendations were made. you should 18 quit smoking. that was the first thing. you 19 should quit, for sure you should quit. but if 20 you are not going to quit, you should smoke a 21 filtered cigarette. 22 and what was the basis for those 23 recommendations? this is a chart that i made 24 when dr. burns was on the stand. dr. burns was 25 on the stand. and we talked about something 1 called epidemiology, which is a science. and 2 it was a science that studied cigarettes. the 3 basic idea of the science is it is a science of 4 populations. 5 so you look at a population of people and 6 compare it to another population of people, and 7 you see what diseases arise in both populations 8 of people. are there differences? could the 9 differences be due to the differences in the 10 people? 11 so the populations that we were talking 12 about with dr. burns was the population of 13 people who smoked filtered cigarettes and 14 people who smoked unfiltered cigarettes. 15 and what the epidemiology showed and 16 still shows to this day -- to this day, is that 17 smokers of filtered cigarettes get less 18 disease. less disease occurrence. meaning 19 lung cancer. 20 that is what dr. burns said when he was on 21 the witness stand right there. smokers of 22 filtered cigarettes get less disease than 23 smokers of unfiltered cigarettes. 24 this is real-world smokers. this is not 25 theoretical science, this is not some article 1 where we are just talking in the abstract. this 2 is looking at actual real-world smokers and 3 tracking what happens to them. 4 how many of them get lung cancer in the 5 filtered camp? how many get lung cancer in the 6 unfiltered camp? less disease occurrence in 7 the unfiltered camp. 8 and the thing about this testing, the 9 thing about this study of epidemiology, 10 millions of people -- millions of people were 11 studied when they did these studies. millions 12 of people. 13 and there is one other important thing 14 about this epidemiology. had nothing to do 15 with the tobacco companies. this was 16 epidemiology done by independent scientists, 17 done by government scientists, done by people 18 at the american cancer society. this was not 19 done by the tobacco companies. 20 and so what dr.-- they found, starting in 21 the 1950s, is that the epidemiology, this 22 independent science, showed that there was less 23 disease among the group that smoked filtered 24 cigarettes. 25 and we went through. we went through 1 some of the surgeon general's reports to show 2 what the surgeon general was actually saying 3 and recommending over time. 4 this is the surgeon general's report from 5 1975. this is the surgeon general. this is not 6 the tobacco companies, this is the surgeon 7 general. 8 a smoker who switches to filtered 9 cigarettes and has smoked them for ten years or 10 longer has a lower risk of developing lung 11 cancer than a smoker who continues to smoke 12 nonfilter cigarettes. 13 less disease occurrence in filtered 14 cigarette smokers. 15 1979, surgeon general's report. again, 16 the long-term use, ten years or more, of 17 filtered cigarettes is associated with lower 18 death rates from lung cancer than those 19 experienced by persons who smoke an equal 20 number of nonfilter cigarettes. 21 less disease occurrence in filtered 22 cigarette smokers. 23 surgeon general's report, 1981. today's 24 filter tipped, lower tar and nicotine 25 cigarettes produce lower rates of lung cancer 1 than do higher tar and nicotine predecessor. 2 less disease occurrence in filtered 3 cigarettes. 4 so what happens then? skipping ahead to 5 shortly after mr. skolnick passed away. 1996. 6 nci is the national cancer institute, part of 7 the united states government. 8 what did they say? filtered tip 9 cigarettes produce lower rates of lung cancer 10 than do their higher tar and nicotine 11 predecessors. 12 that is what was going on. that is what 13 was actually happening during the time periods 14 in question in this case. 15 now, dr. burns, to be sure, changed his 16 mind. 17 dr. burns told you from the witness 18 stand. he said that for this entire period of 19 time -- not all the way back to the '50s, 20 because he was too young then. but he started 21 working in this field in the '70s. from that 22 time up until 2000, he himself was recommending 23 filtered cigarettes. he was recommending 24 low-tar cigarettes. 25 but he changed his mind in 2000. why did 1 he change his mind? why did he change his 2 mind? 3 well, he changed his mind not because of 4 any change in this. he confirmed that it is 5 still the case. that if you look at filtered 6 cigarette smokers, they get less disease. if 7 you look at unfiltered cigarette smokers, they 8 get more disease. 9 but what dr. burns changed his mind about 10 was he said, well, maybe the difference in 11 those two groups is not because of the filter on 12 the cigarettes. he said maybe the difference 13 is because this is a healthier group overall 14 and they get less disease because of that. 15 but the fundamental fact is that filtered 16 cigarette smokers still show less disease 17 occurrence. 18 now, they brought to trial dr. burns, and 19 that was his view. that was his view. he 20 changed his position. but not everybody agreed 21 with dr. burns. 22 others disagreed. 23 others believed that filtered cigarettes 24 provided benefit. so we saw the international 25 agency on research of cancer from 2009. very 1 recent. that is an international cancer 2 research organization that looked at the same 3 question. 4 and they concluded, compared with smokers 5 of medium tar, filtered cigarettes, risk was 6 higher among men and women who smoked high-tar, 7 non-filtered brands. 8 they took a different view than 9 dr. burns, they took a different view. 10 the surgeon general's report of 2010, 11 when it talks specifically about filters, it 12 seems to recognize that there is a difference in 13 view. 14 it says: the wide variation in filter 15 technology across brands and over time 16 precludes general conclusions about whether 17 filters increase or decrease exposure of 18 smokers to toxicants. 19 so they recognize this is an issue here. 20 there is an issue. even today there is an 21 issue. 22 but that does not mean it is a fraud for 23 somebody like iarc to say that filtered 24 cigarettes provide a benefit? 25 filtered cigarette smokers get less 1 disease still. 2 unfiltered cigarette smokers get more 3 disease still. that is still the fact today. 4 so there is no fraud. there is no great 5 deception by the tobacco companies, when it is 6 everybody but the tobacco companies that are 7 saying filters are good, based on the evidence 8 that they had. 9 now, one other thing to keep in mind 10 about this, others disagree. there is been a 11 lot of talk in this case about tobacco company 12 documents coming out and that changed the 13 world. that changed the whole world. 14 so people realized that filtered 15 cigarettes were a problem when these documents 16 came out. 17 but those documents came out here in 18 2000. iarc, the surgeon general 2010 that 19 disagreed with dr. burns on the filter point, 20 they did so after the tobacco company documents 21 came out. afterwards. 22 and one other thing i just want to 23 caution you about. counsel goes to frequently 24 read from the surgeon general report of 2010 25 and says that it says such-and-such and 1 such-and-such. 2 there are all kinds of issues covered in 3 the surgeon general report of 2010. all kinds 4 of issues covered in that report. there are 5 filter issues, there are low-tar cigarette 6 issues, there are light cigarette issues. 7 counsel put something up in front of you. 8 make sure that it is about filters when we are 9 talking about this issue. this is not a case 10 about low-tar cigarettes. this is not a case 11 about light cigarettes. 12 counsel, i think said, i think said that 13 mr. skolnick smoked light cigarettes. that is 14 not true. never did. not an issue in this 15 case. 16 when you look at where the surgeon 17 general report deals with filter technology, it 18 says less disease occurrence in filtered 19 cigarettes, more disease occurrence in 20 unfiltered cigarettes, after looking at 21 millions and millions of people. 22 now, let us talk about mr. skolnick 23 specifically. because that is why we are here. 24 mr. skolnick started smoking filtered 25 cigarettes in the 1960s. around 1966. you 1 heard mr. belasic talked about the pall malls 2 and the whole conversation with dr. proctor 3 about pall malls and how mrs. skolnick said 4 that pall~malls were the first filtered 5 cigarette they smoked. so that was not until 6 the 1960s. 7 now mrs. skolnick said they started to 8 smoke filters when they first came out. that 9 would have been the '50s, so that is not 10 accurate. 11 but 1960s is when mr. skolnick first 12 started to smoke filtered cigarettes. 13 the clerk: 39 minutes left. 14 mr. lombardi: thank you. 15 mr. skolnick smoked filtered cigarettes 16 from the 1960s until he passed away, that 17 period of time. and throughout that entire 18 period of time, the surgeon general, the 19 american cancer society, every public health 20 organization were saying that filters are good. 21 and if you are going to continue to smoke, 22 mr. skolnick and others like you, you should 23 smoke filter cigarettes. 24 the entire time, that is what they said. 25 the entire time, that is what they said. 1 so there has been no intentional omission 2 of important data, important health data, 3 material health data by the tobacco companies 4 about filters during this time period. 5 mr. schlesinger: your honor, i object. 6 it contradicts the findings. 7 the court: overruled. that is argument, 8 counsel. 9 mr. lombardi: during this time period 10 there was no -- mr. skolnick was doing exactly 11 what the public health authorities were saying 12 he should do, which is smoke filtered 13 cigarettes, and that is what he did. 14 now, there was a discussion among some of 15 the witnesses about why mr. skolnick switched 16 to filtered cigarettes, and barbara skolnick 17 said that he had certain information about 18 filters. he told her about this. 19 and she said that a filter would take 20 some of the harmful things from cigarettes 21 away. we have seen that is true. and that if you 22 were unable to quit smoking, this was your best 23 alternative. 24 that is what she said her father told her 25 about what he learned and why he switched to 1 filters. 2 but the tobacco companies never said 3 that. 4 you can look through all the documents 5 that you have back there for as long as you 6 want to. you are not going to find something 7 where a tobacco company said if you are unable 8 to quit smoking, you should smoke filtered 9 cigarettes. 10 who was saying that? well, dr. proctor 11 said public health, surgeon general, 12 physicians, epidemiologists were saying if 13 you are going to smoke, smoke filtered 14 cigarettes. that is what dr. proctor said. 15 so that is where the information -- that is 16 where the information that mr. skolnick had 17 came from. i think mrs. skolnick gave similar 18 testimony at first. 19 but at the end of her testimony, she said 20 that she knew that this information came from 21 the surgeon general and others like the surgeon 22 general. 23 now, this testimony that the whole filter 24 point relates to questions 3 and 4 that 25 mr. belasic already talked to you about. it is 1 in addition to everything he said. i agree 2 with everything mr. belasic said, and i'm not 3 going to repeat everything he said about the 4 1982 date and the other things. 5 but what makes this relevant here is, for 6 instance, in 3, they have to show that each 7 defendant intentionally omitted material 8 information concerning the health effects or 9 addictive nature of smoking cigarettes. 10 philip morris and r.j. reynolds did not 11 omit -- intentionally omit any material 12 information concerning the health effects. 13 mr. schlesinger: objection. 14 the court: overruled. 15 mr. lombardi: now, let me take a minute. 16 one other thing about this. 17 mr. schlesinger: may i approach, judge. 18 the court: yes, sir. [#deleted sidebar#] 17 the court: okay. ladies and gentlemen, 18 let me give you a brief instruction. to the 19 extent that defense counsel's comments are 20 contrary to the findings that you have been told 21 you must apply in this case should you find 22 that mr. skolnick was a member of the class, 23 what we call the engle findings, you should 24 disregard counsel's statement. 25 counsel's statements are only related to 1 filtered cigarettes. 2 you may proceed. 3 mr. lombardi: yes, your honor. 4 and so 3 and 4 again, talking about this 5 before, and obviously i agree with mr. belasic, 6 for the same reasons that he expressed that the 7 answer there should be no. 8 if the answer there is no, then you do not 9 get down to question 6. you do not have to go 10 there. and that is obviously what we think 11 ought to be the outcome here. 12 but if you do get to question 6, i just 13 want to point out a couple of things about 14 question 6. question 6 is the part that 15 counsel said earlier he considers the real part 16 of the case. the real part he wants to get to 17 with more evidence and more arguments. 18 and question 6 has special standards in 19 it. heightened standards in it. so if you do 20 get to question 6, look at those heightened 21 standards. and the heightened standards state 22 that -- i want to make sure i have the words 23 right. of course i misplaced it. 24 but the heightened standard states that 25 you have to be -- have an immediate reaction, a 1 reaction that it has to be the case, that 2 question 6 should be answered yes in order to 3 do so. 4 you will see it is a standard above the 5 standard that we have been talking about for 6 the rest of the case. 7 and for that reason, in addition to 8 everything else you have heard, question 6, in 9 our view, should be answered no. 10 firm belief without hesitation. it has 11 to be a firm belief without hesitation in order 12 to answer question 6 yes. and i do not think 13 you will have a firm belief without hesitation. 14 i do not think you will get to question 6, and 15 that is what we say the outcome should be here. 16 now, let me tell you a little bit about 17 mr. skolnick. we have not talked that much 18 about marlboro and where marlboro fits in here. 19 so i want to make sure you know where his 20 smoking of marlboro fits in. 21 he did not start smoking marlboro until 22 the late 1960s. by that time, he was in his 23 late 40s, and he would been smoking for a long 24 time. 25 mr. skolnick did not smoke a philip 1 morris brand until after the 1964 surgeon 2 general's report. 3 why is that important? because that is 4 the report that said smoking causes lung cancer 5 in men. it was front page news, he knew about 6 it. 7 every package of marlboro that he 8 purchased had a warning label. the warning 9 label started in the late 1960s. 10 so when he started smoking marlboro, it 11 had a warning label on it. that warning label 12 changed over time, because there were changes 13 made by congress in what the warning label 14 said. but the warning label was there on every 15 pack. every pack of marlboro that he purchased 16 had that. 17 mr. skolnick did not smoke a philip 18 morris brand until after he had rejected 19 mrs. skolnick's request that he sit down by the 20 television and watch the quit -- the quit 21 program. did not start until after that. 22 and mr. skolnick, as mr. belasic has 23 already said, did not rely on any philip morris 24 statements, just like he did not rely on any rjr 25 statements made after 1982. 1 and that is the end of the line on 3 and 2 4. that is where the may 1982 language is. so 3 there is nothing like that with respect to 4 mr. skolnick. 5 now, there is something else about 6 marlboro cigarettes and all cigarettes. 7 cigarettes always were a legal product and 8 still are a legal product. and you cannot hold 9 philip morris liable merely for manufacturing, 10 advertising, or selling a cigarette. you have 11 to have more. 12 they have to prove more about this 13 particular plaintiff and the smoker in this 14 particular case, mr. skolnick. and they 15 have not done that. 16 now, i'm going to talk about radiation 17 now. probably when you came into this case 18 after voir dire, you had no idea we were going 19 to end up talking about radiation in this case. 20 but radiation is important for two 21 reasons, as i said before. first, it shows you 22 exactly -- exactly -- why mrs. skolnick gave 23 the answers that she gave on the declaration 24 that you have seen already in this case. she 25 gave it because the radiation was real. she 1 gave it because the radiation caused disease, 2 and she gave it because she was making a claim 3 to that effect. 4 second, radiation is important because 5 under question 1 -- question 1 is a question 6 that mr. belasic went through with you, and he 7 broke it down into about four different 8 questions. 9 one of the questions that is kind of 10 within question 1 is whether mr. skolnick's 11 smoking caused the cancer that is at issue. 12 whether it caused the cancer in the lung that is 13 at issue here. 14 and so the radiation goes to that. 15 they have the burden of proving -- they 16 have the burden of proving that the cancer here 17 was caused by smoking. 18 and the fact of the radiation establishes 19 that they cannot meet their burden of proof. we 20 do not have to prove anything. they have to 21 prove it. 22 and so that is where the radiation, the 23 second part, the second reason for talking 24 about radiation, that is why it fits in. it is 25 there under number 1, and it is an additional 1 reason for you to answer no, in addition to the 2 reasons that mr. belasic pointed out. 3 so, let us talk about radiation. let us 4 start with the basics. notwithstanding what 5 mr. schlesinger thinks and what he said in his 6 argument earlier, everyone agrees that 7 radiation causes cancer. dr. mcgregor, 8 dr. burns, dr. proctor, dr. davis. everybody 9 believes that radiation causes cancer. 10 and mr. schlesinger said in his argument 11 that uranium is not dangerous. that is not what 12 dr. burns said. not what dr. burns said. it is 13 an example of the difference between lawyer 14 argument and the actual facts. 15 dr. burns said uranium causes radiation. 16 radiation causes cancer. everybody except 17 perhaps mr. schlesinger agrees. and that is 18 kind of a lesson. 19 when you hear a lawyer -- and hold me to 20 this too -- when you hear a lawyer state 21 something, make sure that there are facts to 22 back that up. 23 you are the finders of facts in this 24 case. you have heard the evidence in this 25 case. you are the ones that are going to 1 decide what happened. 2 if i say something and it does not look 3 like it is supported by the facts, hold me to 4 that. but also hold the plaintiff to that. 5 because when he comes before you and he 6 raises uranium and he says: nobody -- uranium 7 is not dangerous. says who? nobody in this 8 case says uranium is not dangerous except 9 mr. schlesinger. every expert says uranium is 10 dangerous. 11 so where is this sylvania plant? this is 12 the google map that we put up with 13 dr. mcgregor. it is very similar to the google 14 map that we put up with mrs. skolnick. and 15 this is the neighborhood. this is where the 16 site was for the sylvania plant. that is where 17 the site was. 18 and how far was the skolnicks' house? 19 well, it was here on maxwell drive. 20 dr. mcgregor said she did the google search and 21 it was about right there. that distance, when 22 you use the scale on google maps, is 500 yards. 23 500 yards. it is close. 24 now, we asked mrs. skolnick about the 25 neighborhood a little bit, and mrs. skolnick 1 said: yes, that is the neighborhood. i do not 2 remember all the street names, she said. 3 she said: this makes it look a lot 4 closer than it really was. and she said: i 5 had no idea that sylvania plant was right here. 6 that is what mrs. skolnick said. but she 7 also said -- i think she also said she could not 8 tell you where on maxwell drive she actually 9 lived. it was on maxwell drive, but she 10 could not tell you where it really was. 11 she told you that the temple that she and 12 her husband were founding members of was 13 located right there. just down the road from 14 the plant. she told you that this was a park 15 that her children played in. just down the 16 road from the plant. 17 she told you that there was a golf course 18 right here. 19 the clerk: you have 24 minutes. 20 mr. lombardi: thank you, sir. 21 there is a golf course right here where 22 mr. skolnick played sometimes, not all the time 23 because he belonged to a private club that was 24 located elsewhere. 25 there was a golf course right here that 1 mr. skolnick went to, just across the road from 2 the sylvania plant. 3 but mrs. skolnick, her testimony is, she 4 never saw the plant in 25 years of living in 5 the neighborhood. but we have the testimony of 6 somebody else who lived there for a long time. 7 somebody who lived there when mrs. skolnick 8 lived there. 9 do you remember mrs. gross? she was very 10 early in the case, and she is one of 11 mrs. skolnick's old friends from westbury. she 12 was up here on the witness stand. she is in her 13 80s, very pleasant. affable lady. 14 and we asked mrs. gross: you lived in 15 this neighborhood? do you remember the 16 sylvania plant? 17 she said -- ma'am, you lived across the 18 street from the plant? 19 yes. 20 you lived about the same distance from 21 the plant as the skolnicks? 22 yes. 23 well, mrs. gross knew about the plant. 24 mrs. gross knew about the plant. 25 so the bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, 1 is that plant was close. whether mrs. skolnick 2 knew it was there or does not know it was there, 3 that plant was close by. 4 and it was close enough that there would 5 be problems if there was something going on at 6 that plant that should not have been going on at 7 that plant. 8 and so you heard the story of the 9 sylvania plant, and you heard that story from 10 dr. mcgregor. i'll talk more about her in a 11 minute. 12 but it really is an extraordinary story. 13 who knew that in the suburbs of the united 14 states you could have a nuclear processing 15 plant? 16 the skolnicks did not know. i do not think 17 anybody in that neighborhood knew. who knew 18 that? but it was in a different era. it was 19 back in the cold war when we were in this arms 20 race with the russians. we needed to make 21 nuclear weapons. 22 so they were making nuclear fuel rods. 23 and what were they using to make it? they were 24 making it out of uranium. and, yes, they were 25 making it out of enriched uranium. 1 mr. schlesinger got up and said to you 2 there was no enriched uranium there. there is 3 fact and there is argument. 4 dr. mcgregor told you there was enriched 5 uranium there. the documents show there was 6 enriched uranium there, and also shows there 7 were other hazardous substances there. nickel, 8 beryllium, thorium. 9 when you are working with nuclear fuel 10 rods, you are working with some nasty things. 11 they go in nuclear weapons, they make bombs. 12 so you are working with some nasty things. 13 and what else did dr. mcgregor tell you? 14 that when you work with this uranium to make it 15 into fuel rods, you mill it, you lathe it, you 16 shape it. 17 that means you create scraps, you create 18 scrap material, scrap uranium. what are you 19 going to do with the scrap uranium? she told 20 you that at first -- this was really amazing, i 21 thought. 22 she told you at first they sent it to 23 new jersey in these big drums, and then they 24 took it off the coast of new jersey and dropped 25 them in the ocean somewhere, and then they said 1 that is not a good idea. 2 so what did they do? they burned the 3 uranium. they burned the uranium inside the 4 plant where it would go out a smokestack, they 5 burned the uranium outside the plant in the 6 yard, and that is in addition to what happened 7 to the uranium that sat in the drums. 8 this uranium that mr. schlesinger says is 9 not dangerous, it spontaneously combusts. it 10 catches on fire. there are accounts of a drum 11 of uranium being in the yard and the lid 12 blowing off and the thing catching on fire 13 without anybody doing anything to it. 14 argument, fact. 15 the barrels of uranium were stored 16 outside and spontaneously caught on fire. 17 that is how dangerous this stuff is. 18 they had extensive safety procedures, and 19 dr. mcgregor went through this. they had 20 respirators, they had incinerators, they had 21 gloves, they had film badges. this was the 22 real deal. this was the real dangerous stuff. 23 in a new york suburb. who would have known? 24 and dr. mcgregor talked about the 25 smokestacks. she told you about what was the 1 size of this building. 2 so the sylvania plant was actually a 3 one-story building. it was not a big 4 skyscraper. it was a one-story building. 5 which is what you would probably expect if it is 6 in a suburban neighborhood. and it did not have 7 a 200-foot smokestack to take the smoke up and 8 out and as far away as possible. 9 the smokestacks for the -- for the 10 outside was 10 feet, and for the inside burning 11 was 20 feet. something like the ceiling, a 12 little higher than that, with a 10 foot. and 13 that is where the smoke from the burning uranium 14 went, about that high. 15 where is it gonna go? it is gonna go to 16 the neighborhood. that is where it did go. 17 there was also contamination at the time 18 in the water at the plant, in what they call 19 the sumps, in the leach pools. 20 you saw a document that dr. mcgregor 21 specifically directed you to where they had a 22 measurement of dispersal of 1100 dpms per m3, 23 which she told you was something on the 24 order -- multiple, multiple times, over the 25 standards that existed at the time. 1 and you heard her say that there was -- 2 at the atomic energy commission, which looked 3 at this plant, which inspected this plant, told 4 them frequently, you are not keeping good enough 5 records. you are not keeping on top of things. 6 so that is what was going on at that 7 plant. that is what was going on at that plant. 8 over the course of the time that it was 9 working with uranium, 6 to 13 million pounds of 10 uranium went through that plant in suburban 11 new york. 12 and a lot of it got burned, because every 13 time they worked with it, they made the scraps. 14 and when they made the scraps, they had to burn 15 it. and when they had to burn it, they made 16 the smoke, and in the smoke were uranium 17 particles. 18 and when there is smoke that has uranium 19 particles and the uranium particles get in the 20 lungs, you heard dr. mcgregor say that is a 21 serious health problem. and lung cancer is a 22 serious risk. 23 so that is what was happening. that is 24 what was happening at that plant. 25 and it was so bad at that plant that even 1 today, at the same site, there is still 2 contamination. there is still uranium there. 3 you heard about the 1990s, the nuclear 4 regulatory commission said that there was 5 radioactive contamination there then. 6 you heard in 2000 that there was cleanup 7 of a site that began, that there was still a 8 significant amount of radioactive materials. 9 what is this, like 35 years after the last time 10 they used uranium at the plant? 11 2001, they did more investigations, and 12 this is the 2005 army corps of engineers report 13 which you saw and is in evidence in this case 14 which talks about all of these things. 15 so the uranium at the plant -- what is 16 the fact? what is not the argument? what is 17 the fact? it was dangerous. it is still 18 dangerous. that site is still dangerous. 19 now we are something like 50 years later. 20 uranium is dangerous. and the facts -- not the 21 argument, the fact -- tell you that. 22 now, let us talk about dr. mcgregor. i 23 was interested in the argument about 24 dr. mcgregor's qualifications this morning. 25 counsel said that dr. mcgregor is completely 1 unqualified. she is not like one of the great 2 men of science, he said. completely 3 unqualified, he said. 4 dr. mcgregor was corrupt. he said that. 5 and why did he say that? 6 mr. schlesinger: objection, judge. 7 the court: sustained. 8 let us talk about something else, counsel. 9 mr. lombardi: dr. mcgregor's 10 qualifications were called into question. and 11 the fact is, you got to see dr. mcgregor. the 12 fact is that dr. mcgregor was the single most 13 qualified person to come in this courtroom to 14 talk about radiation and to talk about what 15 happened at the sylvania plant. 16 she is a medical doctor, just like 17 dr. burns. she has a master's of public 18 health. she specializes in environmental and 19 occupational medicine. dr. burns does not. 20 nobody else in this case does. 21 when you specialize in occupational and 22 environmental medicine, you are dealing with 23 exposures to dangerous substances. that is what 24 you do. that is what she does. 25 and you heard that she actually was one 1 of the very first doctors to ever work on the 2 eeoicp -- and i think i got all those letters 3 in the right order. 4 but that is the program she told you 5 about that she works on, where they deal with 6 these kinds of nuclear reactor plants, and they 7 determine whether people have suffered 8 exposures and whether they deserve compensation 9 for those exposures. 10 she is more familiar with this kind of 11 plant than anybody who set foot in this 12 courtroom. and to call her unqualified without 13 a fact to support it is outrageous. 14 argument, fact. the most qualified 15 witness in this case. 16 dr. burns, has he ever -- dr. burns, i 17 admit, has done a lot of things in this career. 18 but has he ever done this kind of work? no 19 evidence. no evidence that he did. and the 20 evidence in this case of what dr. burns 21 actually did is pretty shocking. 22 so let us look. 23 dr. mcgregor's materials reviewed. she 24 told you that she went through a huge quantity 25 of materials in this case. she went through 1 atomic energy commission, nuclear regulatory 2 commission. all of these reports, she went 3 through them to try to understand what happened 4 at this plant. 5 the 2010 army corps of engineers report. 6 she told you that alone, 6,000 pages long. 7 6,000 pages long. so she went out there. she 8 not only has expertise in this area, she did 9 the work to make sure that she could come in 10 and tell you what happened at this plant. 11 fact, argument. 12 what did dr. burns do? and i actually 13 do not blame dr. burns for this. but what did 14 dr. burns do? what documents did dr. burns 15 look at in this case? 16 dr. mcgregor looked at all of these. 17 dr. burns looked at one of them. he looked at 18 the 2005 army corps of engineers report. he 19 did not look at the 6000-page document. he 20 did not look at the other documents. he did not 21 do the work to be able to tell you what 22 happened at that plant. and whether radiation 23 at that plant got into the neighborhood. he 24 had not done that work. 25 but i said i do not blame him for that. 1 because i asked him, when he was up there on 2 the witness stand, where he got the documents 3 he relied on, he got them from plaintiff's 4 attorneys. he took the documents that he got 5 from plaintiff's attorneys and worked with 6 them. 7 so dr. burns, if you take a great expert 8 and you do not give them the information he 9 needs, he is not reliable. does not matter how 10 many credentials he has. you have to give him 11 the information he needs. 12 they did not give dr. burns the 13 information, and i'm going to show you why. 14 look at the things that dr. burns did not 15 know about. he did not know what work was done 16 at the plant. he did not know -- you remember, 17 you might have heard the word "pyrophoric." we 18 talked about that a couple times. 19 i asked him what it meant. that is what 20 it means when you spontaneously combust. pyro 21 for fire, and blown up. he did not know what 22 the word meant. he did not know that uranium 23 spontaneously combusts. 24 there is another fact about uranium. 25 uranium not dangerous, argument. fact, uranium 1 spontaneously combusts. 2 how was uranium processed at the plant? 3 he did not know. how was scrap uranium created? 4 he did not know. did the burning uranium create 5 smoke? he did not know. 6 that is the way dr. mcgregor said the 7 contamination got into the neighborhoods that 8 got to people like leo skolnick. that is 9 burning uranium. he did not know. 10 the clerk: you have nine minutes left. 11 mr. lombardi: how much? 12 the clerk: nine. 13 mr. lombardi: i think i lied about the 14 timing. 15 dr. burns did not know. he was not given 16 the information. dr. mcgregor was. she told 17 you that the plant created uranium, that 18 particles of uranium got into the neighborhood; 19 that the uranium contamination was sufficient 20 to cause mr. skolnick's colon cancer, and to be 21 a risk factor for mr. skolnick's lung cancer. 22 and she is -- nobody disputes her. 23 nobody that has knowledge in this case disputes 24 her. 25 there is more here. 1 what does that leave you, by the way, if 2 dr. burns was their only expert to talk about 3 this, and he does not know what is left? well, 4 what is left is argument. 5 but argument is not fact. 6 so let us go to the next point. 7 colon cancer. this is an interesting 8 thing. colon cancer, mr. skolnick had colon 9 cancer. well, did they bring dr. burns in to 10 tell you what the colon cancer was caused by? 11 well, he said it was not caused by smoking. and 12 he -- again, he was not asked to form an 13 opinion about what caused the colon cancer. 14 the plaintiffs did not ask him to form an 15 opinion about colon cancer. what caused it? 16 what was the evidence? 17 there is no treating physician testimony. 18 they have not provided any treating physician 19 testimony on what caused the colon cancer. 20 there are no medical records showing the cause 21 of the colon cancer. 22 dr. burns does not know what caused 23 mr. skolnick's colon cancer. said it could not 24 have been smoking. there is no information 25 from that side. 1 so who is the only person to talk about 2 it, dr. mcgregor. and she testified that 3 mr. skolnick's only risk factor for colon 4 cancer was radiation. that is the only risk 5 factor. 6 she said to a reasonable degree of 7 medical probability, if the only risk factor is 8 radiation, then she says that is the cause of 9 the colon cancer. 10 how does that relate to the lung cancer 11 in this case? there was enough radiation to 12 cause mr. skolnick's colon cancer. 13 the radiation is a risk factor for lung 14 cancer. there was enough radiation to cause 15 the lung cancer. if there is enough radiation 16 to cause the colon cancer, there is enough 17 radiation to cause the lung cancer. 18 and interestingly, the cell type for the 19 colon cancer was an adenocarcinoma. same cell 20 type for the lung cancer. 21 so when you have two risk factors for a 22 lung cancer, you cannot determine the cause just 23 by looking at the cancer through a microscope. 24 that is what dr. burns told us. 25 you cannot determine which of the risk 1 factors caused the lung cancer. that is what 2 dr. mcgregor told us right there. 3 so what does she say? she says: colon 4 cancer was caused by the radiation. 5 i cannot tell you for sure about the lung 6 cancer. but there were two risk factors. 7 there was smoking, and there was radiation. 8 and you cannot tell which one caused the lung 9 cancer. you cannot tell that. 10 now, plaintiff put up -- this is another 11 fact thing. plaintiff put up something, they 12 said: look, dr. mcgregor agrees that smoking 13 cigarettes was one of the causes of the 14 smoking -- one of the contributing causes of 15 the smoking. 16 he said: see, that is it. that proves 17 it. it is admitting that the smoking caused the 18 cancer. 19 well, you got to look at the whole 20 question. and to the extent that it is true in 21 this case -- he is asking her to assume that. 22 that was not her testimony. 23 her testimony was that the lung cancer -- 24 there are two risk factors, and you cannot 25 unwind those risk factors to make a 1 determination. 2 so can they carry their burden of proof 3 concerning the cause of lung cancer? the 4 answer to that is no. 5 not when the radiation is in the 6 neighborhood. not when the only expert who did 7 the work and had actual expertise in the area 8 has said that uranium contamination caused the 9 colon cancer and so forth. 10 the answer is no, they have not -- they 11 cannot sustain their burden of proof when the 12 treating physicians -- counsel gets up and 13 says: all these treating physicians, they said 14 that smoking was the cause of lung cancer? 15 that is true. not one of them knew about 16 the radiation. not one of them had any reason 17 to know about the radiation. 18 so, of course, they are going to say the 19 only risk factor was smoking. that was the 20 cause. they did not know about the radiation. 21 they did not know what you know, they did not 22 know what dr. mcgregor knows. 23 and they cannot sustain the burden of 24 proof when mrs. skolnick, the plaintiff, files 25 an affidavit under oath in another case against 1 another defendant where she says that the lung 2 cancer was caused by radiation. 3 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor. 4 i move -- i would like to approach. 5 the court: okay. 6 (the following discussion was held at 7 sidebar:) 8 the court: i think there are two 9 reasonable interpretations of the document, and 10 i'm going to allow both of parties to argue 11 what this means. 12 mr. schlesinger: this is when she says 13 it was caused by radiation. the word is not on 14 the page. 15 the court: okay. 16 mr. schlesinger: the word is -- he can 17 say she thought it was. but he said "she 18 said," and that is her handwritten statement. 19 and then i do not have enough time to go and 20 unravel things that are past the pale. that is 21 flat-out misstatement. 22 the court: i'm not sure -- 23 mr. schlesinger: flat-out. 24 mr. lombardi: judge, that is a 25 reasonable interpretation of this document. 1 she was filing a claim for radiation, and 2 that is what it -- 3 mr. schlesinger: where does it say 4 radiation? the word "radiation" -- 5 the court: relax, please, sir. relax. 6 mr. schlesinger: i'm sorry, judge. 7 the word "radiation" does not appear on 8 the document. 9 the court: i'm going to sustain. 10 rephrase the question in terms of it was 11 related to the -- whatever happened at the 12 plant. okay? that is all i'm going to say. 13 mr. schlesinger: you will instruct the 14 jury -- 15 the court: no, sir. 16 (sidebar discussion concluded, and the 17 following was held in open court:) 18 the court: go ahead, sir. 19 mr. lombardi: yes, your honor. 20 and so mrs. skolnick gave these answers 21 to questions concerning what happened at the 22 sylvania plant. she said that the lung cancer 23 was caused by what happened at the sylvania 24 plant and it was not just once. 25 mr. schlesinger: same objection, judge. 1 mr. lombardi: was not twice. 2 the court: i'm sorry? 3 mr. schlesinger: same objection. 4 the court: overruled. i'm going to 5 allow it. 6 mr. lombardi: you see the number of 7 times that she filled in "lung cancer" in that 8 declaration. 9 now, mrs. skolnick today says that she 10 read the declaration in a different way, she 11 did not know what wrongful death claim meant, 12 she did not know a lot of different things about 13 this. 14 but i suggest that if you consider what is 15 going on here, a lot of these answers become 16 clear. why it was that the neighborhood was 17 fuzzy in her mind, why it was that mrs. gross 18 recognized where the sylvania plant was and she 19 did not. 20 in one case she swore that the lung 21 cancer was caused by what went on in that case 22 against a different defendant. 23 in this case she comes in and swears that 24 the lung cancer is caused by smoking. you 25 cannot sustain your burden of proving that the 1 lung cancer was caused by smoking when you have 2 sworn and made a claim that the lung cancer was 3 caused by rad -- was caused by what happened at 4 the sylvania plant. you cannot sustain your 5 burden of proof. 6 they have the burden of proof, and this 7 is question 1. the answer should be no. 8 dr. mcgregor's evidence indicates that, 9 mrs. skolnick's evidence indicates that. 10 and when counsel has said that this -- 11 this is just something the tobacco companies 12 came up with, remember mrs. skolnick filed the 13 declaration, mrs. skolnick completed the 14 declaration, and mrs. skolnick, so there is no 15 confusion, had access to lawyers in new york. 16 she has a son who is a lawyer, and the 17 last little clip that we played that led -- 18 that one minute and 13 second deposition, 19 probably the happiest you have been about a 20 deposition in this whole case, she said that 21 she gave the claim form to her son, and he took 22 it to his office. and she said that was just 23 to mail it. 24 but you are entitled to weigh the 25 credibility and to consider all the facts when 1 you consider this declaration and when you 2 consider whether they can meet their burden of 3 proof that the smoking caused the lung cancer 4 here. 5 now -- 6 the clerk: one minute left. 7 mr. lombardi: i will not be here long. 8 thank you again. now, as mr. belasic 9 said, we are not going to be able to talk from 10 here on. you can imagine with lawyers, you have 11 seen how much we talk. you see how we all want 12 to have the last word, and you know that we are 13 going to be frustrated. that is the way it 14 goes. they have the burden of proof. they go 15 last. 16 but i ask you to remember when you only 17 hear one side of the story, you do not always 18 hear the facts. you do not always hear 19 everything. 20 when you hear one side of the story, you 21 might hear the argument. but you do not hear 22 all the facts. 23 i ask you to help us by keeping that in 24 mind and asking questions in your own mind when 25 counsel gets up to close the case. 1 so, again, thank you for your patience, 2 thank you for paying attention in the middle of 3 the afternoon to the last guy getting up, and 4 thanks for your service. 5 thank you very much.
