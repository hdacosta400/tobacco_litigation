3 mr. schlesinger: counsel; ms. skolnick. 4 ladies and gentlemen of the jury, good 5 morning. 6 i am not unmindful and -- 7 we, as the members of the court 8 personnel -- and i'm talking about the lawyers 9 that represent their respective clients, and 10 i'm talking about our clerk, our bailiff, our 11 fine judge, our "carpal tunnel developing" 12 court reporters -- are all mindful of the 13 difference in what it is that the experience of 14 this trial means from our perspective as from 15 your perspective. so today i'm going to try to 16 take some time -- 17 and it is not enough time to cover a 18 hundred years of history, it is not enough time 19 to talk about what the world was like in 1918, 20 when leo skolnick was born, when women were 21 just getting to vote in 1918, where florida was 22 a sandbar, with a few outposts, it is not enough 23 time to do it all, so we have to try to 24 simplify it. but i'm not -- 25 we are not unmindful -- and i speak, i 1 believe, for defense counsel, as well -- that 2 things get tedious, and it comes to a point in 3 time where, as they say, that a great 4 percentage of human communication -- we are 5 human beings, we interact with each other -- is 6 non-verbal. it is not just what you say; it is 7 your body language, it is your body position. 8 and you were telling us, at least i interpreted 9 it, that we have heard enough, give us this case. 10 and we respect that. 11 so let me try to make some arguments to 12 you. let me try to stitch this together a 13 little bit in a way that gives our perspective 14 from some of the evidence that was there, hope 15 you will continue to be patient with us, 16 recognizing that, for us, the most important 17 part of this case is yet to be tried before you 18 all, and we have to prove our case to you in a 19 satisfactory way, and then you have to embrace 20 that duty that you have discharged thus far so 21 willingly to continue on if the evidence 22 justifies it. 23 and what i'm talking about is an industry 24 that has perpetrated an extraordinarily great 25 wrong on our society for decades. 1 we live in a world that is still 2 suffering the scourge of a tobacco epidemic 3 that kills indiscriminately in a generation of 4 people that are the grandparents and parents of 5 our current generation and in a way that has 6 not been fully corrected. 7 so there are numbers that you have heard. 8 we will talk about some of them, but some of the 9 numbers you have heard. a number they love -- a 10 number they love -- 50 million. fifty million 11 smokers have quit. 12 a number they hate, 44 million people 13 continue to smoke. a number they hate, 443,000 14 americans every single year die from the 15 ravages of the tobacco epidemic that we have in 16 our country. and of those near half a million 17 americans who die, many of whom were addicted 18 in the '30s and the '40s and the '50s, before 19 folks had an understanding, a full 20 conceptualization in any real way of what 21 smoking was. 22 physicians were advertising it as being 23 healthy for you. the most glamorous movie 24 stars of the day were hawking cigarettes. and 25 you heard how many of those folks, despite 1 being paid to do so, succumbed to the deadly 2 diseases of the actual product they were using. 3 conceptually, it is so difficult, and it 4 takes a long time -- only because of our own 5 experience as lawyers in this case -- it takes 6 such a long time to understand that this 7 (indicating) is only one thing. it is only one 8 thing. 9 this is drugs. this is addictive drugs. 10 whether it was a drug sold illegally on a 11 street corner, a cocaine drug -- 12 objection, your honor. 13 the court: sustained. counsel, let us 14 stick to the facts of this case, okay? 15 mr. schlesinger: as the surgeon general 16 said, the drugs in these products are as 17 addictive as heroin and cocaine. that is a 18 scientific fact. 19 there is no smoking without nicotine. 20 this is a nicotine-delivery device. but what 21 does it look like? it looks like a normal 22 consumer product. a totally normal consumer 23 product. it is got -- 24 nowadays, it is got every imaginable color 25 under the sun. this looks like a creamsicle. 1 every imaginable color under the sun. and 2 it is, as dr. proctor testified, normalized. we 3 look at it -- 4 if you go into a 7-eleven, if you go into 5 a cvs pharmacy, it appears to be in a package 6 that is designed and pretty in colors and 7 letters and what have you, like a million 8 similarly sized products, little boxes of candy 9 and things like that. 10 and who are the only customers that the 11 tobacco industry targets and sells to, to 12 maintain their business? it is children. 13 now, that is the dirty little secret that 14 exists for decades and decades, that when you 15 were selected amongst a huge group of potential 16 jurors, all of you all came in and everyone 17 talked about what they knew about cigarettes, 18 because cigarettes has touched all of our 19 lives. 20 the culture in which we live is a culture 21 that was saturated by cigarette advertising, 22 marketing, and the emergence of a consumer 23 culture in our country in the industrial ages 24 of the '20s, to the '30s, to the '40s, the 25 '50s, and the '60s, and we are now immersed in 1 it and saturated in it. 2 and, as his honor told you, 3 mr. skolnick's reliance can be inferred from 4 what everybody did; what mr. skolnick did in 5 being your typical, generic smoker of that era, 6 who began at such a young age, so dependent 7 upon the nicotine in cigarettes so long before 8 there was actually a warning on a label that 9 would obligate him to change his behavior, 10 despite the fact that even in the face of the 11 warning, the tobacco companies embarked on a 12 powerful campaign to confuse and cause doubt, 13 and they would call out, let us get headlines 14 planted in the newspapers that say, in the 15 headline, controversy, doubt, unproven, other 16 factors, undetermined, to give smokers the 17 psychological crutch to keep smoking. 18 and then they put filters as a health 19 reassurance campaign; and then filters went 20 from zero percent of the market to nearly a 21 hundred percent of the market, and smoking 22 continued to go up, and the cancer, made by the 23 filters that were fraudulent all along, never 24 worked, were designed in a way to give smokers 25 a psychological crutch to keep smoking. 1 these are drugs. i will show you the 2 documents. it is a nicotine-delivery system. 3 the pack of cigarettes is to be -- 4 we are a highly stylized segment of the 5 pharmaceutical community. we better watch out 6 what we say about it, because we could come 7 under food and drug administration regulation. 8 now, we are going to talk about things 9 like choice, opportunity, motivation, control; 10 but what is very important to remember is, step 11 one is about belonging to a group, a class, a 12 proud class, a group that, when i think about 13 it -- and you will see these -- these -- the 14 findings, the determination, the blood, sweat 15 and tears, the decades of litigation that 16 resulted -- 17 objection, your honor. 18 the court: sustained, counsel. let us 19 talk about this case, okay? 20 mr. schlesinger: this case is an engle 21 progeny case. it is the emergence and it is 22 the offspring of a case that was tried for a 23 lengthy period of time. 24 objection, your honor. 25 the court: overruled. i'm going to 1 allow that. 2 go ahead. 3 mr. schlesinger: many years ago, a 4 lawsuit filed in '94, tried in the year 1999, 5 findings approved by the florida supreme court 6 as if you found them yourself -- 7 objection, your honor, 8 "approved by the florida supreme court," your 9 honor. 10 the court: sustained -- sustained, 11 counsel. let us just talk about the engle 12 findings, if we could, sir. 13 mr. schlesinger: we will talk -- 14 leave those up for a second. 15 but today, even though you have seen 16 enough, heard enough, your body language tells 17 us you are ready to go, you are going to -- 18 you have honored your duty. i know you are 19 going to give us the attention we need to give 20 us the chance to get to the important -- super 21 important part of this case, phase ii, based on 22 the reprehensibility of the conduct. is the 23 conduct reprehensible, did it evince, did it 24 show a reckless disregard, a lack of caring 25 about people, so that knowing harm would occur, 1 a company did it anyway. 2 now, it is a company. there is an 3 instruction. the instruction says a 4 corporation gets to be treated like a person. 5 they are entitled to be treated in this 6 courtroom like a person. that is good for a 7 number of reasons. 8 because outside the courtroom, they are 9 not equal, they do not have the same sort of 10 power as an individual. they have a great deal 11 more power economically, politically, legally, 12 and you will see the documents that support it. 13 so i think of them as a really big 14 person. if you ever drive on us-27, there are 15 those gigantic metal racks where the power 16 lines go, and when we are driving by them, i 17 tell my kids, what is that? that is the giant 18 man because it looks like a really giant man. 19 so, if they are a person, they are a really 20 big person; but if they are being treated here 21 equally in a courtroom, it is because, in a 22 courtroom, a jury -- six folks, you guys -- get 23 to treat them equally. 24 my client, mrs. skolnick, 86 years old, 25 lost her husband in 1993. she gets to stand on 1 equal footing with them, and she is able to go 2 toe to toe with them because they have a jury 3 here as what we call a great equalizer. 4 let us see thomas jefferson. red, white, 5 blue. inspirational closing argument suit. 6 red, white and blue flag, just to inspire us to 7 think a little bit about, you know, what we are 8 all about. 9 thomas jefferson said that trial by jury 10 is the best of all safeguards for the person 11 and property of every individual. 12 and the fact of the matter is, is that, 13 you know, there are books being written now 14 called the death of the american trial, because 15 the trial by jury is a -- 16 objection, your honor. 17 the court: that is beyond -- 18 just argue the case. 19 mr. schlesinger: okay. so the -- 20 the first conceptualization that folks 21 need to start thinking about, and we hope 22 that -- 23 when you were jurors, you came in, you 24 knew what you knew about cigarettes, to the 25 extent you knew something about cigarettes. we 1 hope that the evidence you saw about the 2 conduct and activities of what the cigarette 3 industry did, what an industry, treated as a 4 person, is obligated to behave in the moral and 5 ethical fashions as all people, if you would 6 like an instruction that allows us to treat you 7 like a person, the important thing to do is act 8 like a person. 9 and how do we act like a person? we are 10 decent to each other. we are moral to each 11 other. 12 objection, your honor, it is 13 beyond the law and the facts in this case. 14 the court: i think it is a legitimate 15 argument. 16 you can go ahead, sir. 17 mr. schlesinger: so let us put up the -- 18 here's the instruction. both are persons 19 in the eyes of the law. no problem. if you 20 want the rights of the person, you have the 21 obligations of the person. the obligations of 22 the person are act like a person, be decent to 23 each other. 24 everything i ever needed to learn, i 25 learned in kindergarten. robert fulghum's 1 book, the title, itself, tells you what you 2 need to know. be decent, do not hurt each 3 other, do not lie. 4 and so we are here to try to correct a 5 great wrong. 6 show the reckless disregard and the 7 punitive damage instructions. 8 in order to get there, you are going to 9 have to work through a bunch of questions on 10 the verdict form, which i'm going to work 11 through with you, but i want to talk about the 12 punitive damages. 13 and if you find that the unearthing of 14 the documents that occurred in the year 2000, 15 that if you look at the surgeon general '12 16 report, and i -- 17 i had those books. these are in 18 evidence. everything you want to know about 19 this case, almost everything we talked about, 20 is documented in one way or another in these 21 books in evidence. 22 it is the highest statement by the 23 highest public health officials in our land; 24 and we were honored -- 25 it was a proud honor to bring into this 1 courtroom giants in the field that dedicated 2 their lives to trying to make this country a 3 safer place from the scourge of tobacco 4 addiction. an epidemic that is enduring 5 because a powerful industry depends on its 6 perpetuation. 7 without nicotine, there is no smoking. 8 nobody has become a smoker without smoking 9 nicotine. 10 our customers die. 11 now, what is it about the cigarettes -- 12 and i tried to think about this -- 13 i tried to think about this in terms of 14 human nature, what are we as people. maybe it 15 is that when something does not immediately kill 16 you -- it is not a bullet, it is not a gun, it is 17 not one of these outrageous spasms of -- of 18 irrepressible violence that we see in our news 19 that makes headline news, it is not the kind of 20 things that rivet our nation for days on end 21 and days at a time, that we do not -- it does not 22 affect us the same way. 23 i guess the human behavioral survival 24 instinct is if something does not kill you right 25 away, or it does not hurt you immediately, you 1 do not perceive the risk of it. 2 well, that makes for the elements of what 3 is the perfect storm for an epidemic. little 4 kids, 12-year-olds -- 5 this is the first document i carried 6 around. i've been carrying this around. 7 do we have this one? this is one of 8 their analyses. they have code words. 9 compound w is nicotine. zephyr, a warm breeze? 10 the cynicism that "zephyr" means lung cancer in 11 their secret documents. the chilling, ghastly 12 things that human beings, men of science -- 13 what could these men, what could the 14 claude teagues and the dunns, and the ceos, 15 what could they have done if they had dedicated 16 their lives to pursuing good and cancer cures? 17 what could they have done if -- when, in 18 the '50s, they discovered our product kills 19 people, there is no doubt about it? 20 they said to the public, if there is 21 something bad, we will take it out. we would 22 never sell anything bad to you. your health, 23 the public's health, is our tantamount 24 responsibility. and it was -- 25 it was a madison avenue, hill & knowlton 1 public relations gambit to put away the cancer 2 scare that came out in the '50s. and, sure 3 enough, cigarette sales shot up. and more than 4 half of the men in the country were smoking 5 because they knew that nicotine is the sine qua 6 non of smoking. what does that mean? it is 7 latin. it means without which there is 8 nothing. 9 now, this is a business plan. if i'm 10 sitting in my house and my neighbor comes over 11 to me and says, hey, i got a great idea for a 12 business, we are going to make this product, 13 people are going to eat it up like hotcakes, 14 they are not going to be able to get enough of 15 it, they are never going to be able to stop 16 using it and we are going to make a ton of 17 money. 18 there is only one problem. after a while, 19 a lot of people are going to die from it, it is 20 going to kill them; but, man, we are going to 21 make a lot of money. 22 would you do it? would you do it? would 23 somebody enter into that kind of -- 24 objection, your honor -- 25 the court: sustained. 1 -- golden rule. 2 the court: sustained. 3 mr. schlesinger: would a person do it? 4 judging by a person. 5 so we are going to talk about this. this 6 document talks about 12-year-olds. 7 twelve-year-olds. 8 there is a movie, the big lebowski. there 9 is a line in the movie that john, the big guy, 10 along with jeff -- 11 you may have never seen it. anyway, 12 they are talking, they say 12-year-olds, dude, 13 12-year-olds, okay? 14 now, that -- that is -- that is 15 unacceptable, that is abusive, that is 16 intolerable conduct to children, to 17 recognize -- to do the science and recognize 18 that the teenage brain, the pediatric brain is 19 in a growth spurt, just like the rest of the 20 body, and those frontal lobes are forming, and 21 that it is in those adolescent years that the 22 brain is uniquely and critically susceptible to 23 addiction and a permanent hooking by a drug, 24 nicotine, from which these surgeon general 25 reports will tell you 3800 kids today -- 1 the surgeon general report in 2012, 3800 2 kids today will begin the smoking habit. two 3 of the three will continue to smoke, and one of 4 those two will die. 5 twelve million people have died thus far 6 just in the last 50 years in the united states 7 from smoking cigarettes. 8 the filters they put on the cigarettes to 9 reassure the public, knowing full well they 10 did not work, knowing full well they were a 11 fraud, were done to get folks to rely -- to 12 keep people smoking, and it worked. 13 now, 99 percent of all cigarettes are 14 filters. mr. skolnick smoked filtered 15 cigarettes in reliance on that fact. 16 there was a pervasive overwhelming period 17 of years where they fooled the federal trade 18 commission. they fooled dr. burns. 19 what an honor to get dr. burns here. the 20 man was, essentially, the chief science 21 office -- officer for the surgeon general. and 22 dr. proctor. these men are, in their field, 23 giants. 24 i do not know if you have ever heard of 25 tedtalks or anything like that; but nowadays, 1 in our modern world, you can go to the ted 2 lectures on the internet and see smarty-pants 3 guys talking about a bunch of really cool stuff 4 and teaching us. and getting these guys in 5 here is a fantastic thing. 6 now, they were cross-examined on things 7 like money; they were cross-examined on did you 8 meet with the lawyers. well, any good lawyer 9 meets with the witness before he puts him on; 10 otherwise, what kind of lawyer would you be? 11 but it was not until you heard 12 dr. mcgregor come in that you knew that, yeah, 13 they met with dr. mcgregor. they met with 14 dr. mcgregor more times, over more hours than 15 anybody else combined in the whole case. 16 so you take the evidence as you find it, 17 you hear what the truth is about cigarettes. 18 and the fact of the matter is, is there is a 19 couple of pillars of extraordinary wrongdoing 20 that give rise to the concept that they should 21 be punished. they should be punished not just 22 for what they did to mr. skolnick; but as the 23 instruction will say, the harm they caused 24 others. 25 so, the engle year-long trial that 1 resulted in those findings that you must accept 2 as your own is super important. we will talk 3 about those. but we also gave you a window 4 into what was really going on behind the scenes 5 in the world of tobacco, and what -- how they 6 effectuated this ghastly business plan, and 7 intending to keep it secret, and successfully 8 did for many, many years, only in 2000 or so, 9 to have it forced into the public light so that 10 you all could see it. 11 now, i want to go back to the -- the 12 teague -- the last one. 13 no, no, the last one with the red, 14 please. the last one. you had it up a minute 15 ago. no; but you can leave that up for a sec. 16 but -- 17 anyway, this is a report on smokers. 18 they talk about the youth market, the 19 importance of the youth market. and look at 20 the age of the kids. twelve years old, 13 21 years old, 14 years old, 15 years old, 16 years 22 old, 17, 18. 68.7 percent start by 18; over 23 half start before they are 17. the median age 24 is 16.7 years. but these are their customers. 25 the industry cannot exist without 1 replacing the smokers that are leaving the 2 market. the smokers that are leaving the 3 market are the older ones that are either 4 quitting or dying. they are leaving the market. 5 nicholas cage left las vegas in similar 6 fashion. if you ever saw that movie, he drank 7 himself to death and died. 8 so i hear "leaving the market," keeping a 9 business in equilibrium by reestablishing 10 getting youthful children into the market, that 11 just -- that cannot square with any notion of 12 what should be acceptable behavior. 13 we cannot ever be comfortable selling a 14 product which most of our customers would stop 15 using if they could. that is to say, if the 16 exit gate from our market should suddenly open, 17 we could be out of business almost overnight. 18 these are exhibits in evidence. 19 i want the teague one. here. 20 now, i talked about sine qua non. i'll 21 do this quick. they know that the tobacco 22 product is the vehicle for the delivery of 23 nicotine. they know this. this is what the 24 whole business is on. all smoking is based 25 upon nicotine. 1 no matter what you say about marketing, 2 no matter what you say about packaging, the 3 federal trade commission, in the '60s and the 4 '80s, said it is wall to wall, it is saturation 5 advertising. there is no way to avoid 6 advertising. they use peer pressure to get 7 people to smoke. 8 you are going to hear the defense saying, 9 we do not know specifically which ad he saw, and 10 his wife began smoking filters and he began 11 smoking filters. 12 they were smoking filters for safety. it 13 was the plan in place by tobacco to keep their 14 smoking -- smokers smoking, to give them a 15 psychological crutch, and say let us keep them 16 smoking, what can we do to reassure when they 17 are in their -- deep in their biological 18 depths, some fear, an irrational fear, no 19 matter what pooh-poohing logic we put out 20 there, that the smoker could have a problem 21 with this cigarette, how do we keep them 22 smoking? and it worked. the business worked. 23 what would have happened if, in the '50s 24 or in the '60s, instead of lambasting the 25 surgeon general's report and calling it 1 half-baked and in certain years saying the 2 surgeon general is trying to intentionally 3 mislead the public, what would have happened if 4 they had come forward and said, this is bad, we 5 know it is bad, we are changing our business, 6 we are never going to sell it to kids, we are 7 going to help people that want to get off 8 cigarettes, if we have an 18-year-old or a 9 12-year-old that started smoking and now they 10 come to us and they are 25 and they want to quit 11 smoking, we will help them, we will give them 12 cessation products, we will give them 13 denicotinized cigarettes, we will give them 14 something, we will help them get off 15 cigarettes? 16 what did they do instead? they created 17 this situation. the delivery of attractive 18 dosage forms of nicotine, manipulated with 19 additives and ammonia to make the nicotine 20 freebase, like crack cocaine, the molecular 21 structure, so it hits the brain in seven 22 seconds so hard that it addicts the pediatric 23 brain at a moment of vulnerability. 24 fishermen use hooks in bait to catch 25 fish. that is the whole purpose behind fishing. 1 the fish do not know the hook is in the bait. 2 that is the whole reason behind it. 3 so making a business, saying we have got -- 4 we have got this drug, it sells great because a 5 good number of folks -- we do not know which 6 ones, but if we cast our net wide enough, if we 7 throw enough lines in the water, we are -- 8 we are-- enough of those triers of cigarette 9 smoke are going to become permanent, lifelong 10 customers; and when they die, we will replace 11 them with their children. is that -- 12 i mean, are we so -- 13 we have not become, in this country, so 14 cynical, so enured to everybody does something 15 wrong, that we cannot come back into this 16 courtroom, in front of a jury, and say, we 17 reject this and we speak, through the jury, to 18 the tobacco companies, with a roar of moral 19 outrage -- 20 your honor -- 21 mr. schlesinger: -- which rejects -- 22 -- you ruled out this type 23 of argument. 24 the court: sustained. 25 mr. schlesinger: okay. i get fired up. 1 when you guys go back in the courtroom 2 (sic), you have to coolly, calmly, 3 dispassionately, weigh the evidence, without 4 prejudice for any other side, without prejudice 5 to the tobacco company, but based on the 6 science and the evidence, without prejudice for 7 mrs. skolnick, because you have sympathy or you 8 care about her, or prejudice against her 9 because some of the things that the tobacco 10 company said about her, which we will address. 11 let us get to this. the sine qua non of 12 tobacco products. the attractive dosages form 13 of nicotine. 14 they have got to get him to try something, 15 to try something that he does not know what is in 16 it. you got to get a kid to try something; 17 emulate a figure, a sports hero, to look cool 18 in the peer group, you have got to do that. 19 and it says: we have deliberately played 20 down the role of nicotine; hence, the 21 non-smoker has little or no knowledge of what 22 satisfactions it may offer him and no reason to 23 try it. instead, we must convince him, with 24 wholly irrational reasons, that he should try 25 smoking, in the hope that he will then discover 1 the real, in quotes, satisfactions obtainable. 2 that is one of the code words for addiction. 3 now, that is some cold-blooded stuff. 4 that is -- 5 when i read it -- and i've read it a -- 6 hundred times -- it is -- 7 objection, opinion, your 8 honor. 9 mr. schlesinger: -- i think -- 10 the court: sustained, to the extent not 11 your own opinion. 12 mr. schlesinger: okay. i submit to you 13 that you could conclude that that is chilling, 14 that is an intent to hook children. 15 let us go to the children board, please. 16 if our company is to survive and prosper 17 over the long term, we must get our share of 18 the youth market. for the pre-smoker and 19 learner, the physical effects of smoking are 20 largely unknown, unneeded or actually quite 21 unpleasant or awkward the expected or derived 22 physiological effects are largely responsible 23 for influencing the pre-smoker to try smoking 24 and provide sufficient motivation during the 25 learning periods to keep the learner going, 1 despite the physical unpleasantness and 2 awkwardness of the period. 3 the fragile developing of a young person 4 needs all of the support and enhancement he can 5 get. the self-image enhancement effect has 6 traditionally been a strong promotional theme 7 for cigarette brands and should be continued to 8 be emphasized. 9 and it talks about the top five brands. 10 you will notice these are the brands that 11 mr. skolnick smoked. we know he started 12 somewhere between the ages of ten and 17, back 13 in the '30s. 14 he was dependent upon the drug in the 15 cigarettes to some degree, to some meaningful 16 way that kept him smoking. his wife was able 17 to quit. he could not quit. he tried. 18 back at the time, the hippie-dippie stuff 19 they had like, erhard seminar training, or 20 transcendental meditation -- 21 and this is a guy that was a little old 22 for that generation of stuff. he gave it a 23 shot. he tried. he sucked on plastic 24 cigarettes. he cut down. he could not stop. 25 but that is not the determination of whether or 1 not he is a member of the class. 2 one of the issues for you to decide is, 3 is he a member of the class, does he belong in 4 the class. 5 well, did the lawyers have a problem 6 finding class members? i mean, 443,000 people 7 a year die; right? a lot of people every year 8 die. florida represents a substantial 9 percentage of that population. the period of 10 time that the class members come from is from 11 '92 to '96. 12 and there are a tremendous number of 13 folks who were the addicted smokers whose 14 addiction drove that smoking behavior to the 15 point where they got illnesses from it. 16 nobody smokes a pack, a pack and a half, 17 or two packs of cigarettes a day for 40 or 50 18 years unless they have a dependence. 19 "dependence" and "addiction" are the same 20 thing. a dependence, a need for that drug in 21 the system, which has changed permanently the 22 pediatric brain and drives that dependence 23 process. that is just the fact of the matter. 24 the internal documents that came out are 25 a revelation. they say in the preface, in the 1 introductory statement, in the surgeon general 2 2012 report, our scientists are analyzing these 3 internal documents to learn now what was really 4 going on. 5 we are coming to understand what tobacco 6 knew and bragged about. we are years ahead of 7 the public health industry, what we know about 8 the nicotine we sell. they bragged about that. 9 martin luther king said -- 10 objection, your honor. 11 mr. schlesinger: -- that the -- 12 the court: counsel, let us not have 13 comments from other -- 14 stick to the argument of this case. 15 mr. schlesinger: can -- i cannot give a 16 quote from a famous person? 17 the court: sustained. 18 mr. schlesinger: no? 19 the court: sustained. 20 mr. schlesinger: okay. 21 so, another thing. from time to time, 22 when describing market categories and target 23 audiences, we use references such as young 24 smokers, young market, youth market, et cetera. 25 in the future, when describing the 1 low-age end of the cigarette business, please 2 use the term "young adult smoker" or "young 3 adult smoking market." 4 so they have the 12-year-olds and now 5 you will see in that page, under "12-year-olds," 6 it says "young adult smoking market." they are 7 calling 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, 8 14-year-olds, young adults. that is not true. 9 what do you tell -- what does -- 10 a parent is obligated to teach their 11 child about the dangers or hazards of smoking. 12 the parents have the obligation to teach the 13 kids. 14 what does the parent explain to the 15 children about products like this when they ask 16 mommy or daddy, what about this stuff, and 17 mommy and daddy cannot say, try it or use it 18 because, you know, it is bad; and we know that 19 the rebelliousness of youth is such that they 20 have a tendency to rebel or go against what 21 parents say. if the parent says, do not use it, 22 that even puts a risk in the kid of using it -- 23 of a child of using it. 24 so what do you say, when it looks like 25 such a normal product, to keep kids off of the 1 cigarettes? ninety percent of smoking 2 disappears if nobody under 21 gets cigarettes. 3 that is just a fact. nobody -- kids -- 4 people over 21, if you take -- 5 if they want to do the right thing and 6 they want to have a business in this country, 7 and they say, we are ready to choose to do the 8 right thing, we admit this is a highly 9 dangerous product, it is hurt an awful lot of 10 people, we want to do the right thing, we want 11 to help, we have chosen to make arrangements to 12 keep cigarettes out of the hands of anyone 13 under 21, ever, because that will reduce this 14 epidemic to one-tenth of what it is now, they 15 would still have a business, but the business 16 would truly be a business from at least folks 17 that are closer to being fully brain-developed 18 adults that are out of that vulnerable period 19 of extraordinary susceptibility, and give folks 20 a chance to not end up an addicted smoker for 21 life and succumb to a -- the terrible diseases 22 that end up causing folks to die in an 23 ignominious way, in a way that is painful and 24 great suffering. 25 the books before you say that -- 1 you want to talk about healthcare crisis 2 in this country? $97 billion a year today, in 3 today's dollars, in -- the harm caused in our 4 society from tobacco. 5 now, if you -- if you look at the -- 6 i want to look at the definition of 7 "punitive damages," please. 8 so -- 9 did i already do this? i did the whole 10 thing? 11 okay. the conduct causing loss to the 12 plaintiff was so gross and flagrant as to show 13 a reckless disregard of human life or of the 14 safety of persons exposed to the effects of 15 such conduct, so that it is the loss to -- the 16 plaintiff is the personal representative of the 17 estate, mrs. skolnick. 18 and the question is, is what tobacco did 19 in the conspiracy -- you know, there is a group 20 effort to hide the health effects and maintain 21 and sustain the business -- so gross and 22 flagrant as to show a reckless disregard for 23 the life or the safety of persons exposed to 24 the effects of such conduct. 25 it has to do with all of the folks that 1 were hurt and sickened, the millions that never 2 got a day in court, the millions of folks that 3 did not have the benefit of the -- of what was 4 forced to be admitted when the states attorneys 5 general came out -- 6 objection, your honor. 7 the court: sustained. 8 same objection, your honor. 9 you have already ruled this out. 10 the court: sustained. 11 mr. schlesinger: it was not until 2000, 12 pursuant to compulsory proceedings, that a lot 13 of these internal documents were shaken loose. 14 and it is current, they are still being analyzed 15 and studied today. 16 now, let us go to the engle findings, 17 please. 18 okay. so question 1 -- 19 and i keep trying to skip over and go 20 back to it because i think that question 1 is 21 clear, and i think that you all have seen 22 evidence un-rebutted. 23 in other words, all of the evidence, all 24 the people, lay people, doctors, treating 25 doctors, independent eyewitnesses -- 1 dr. davis, who came in here, he is an 2 independent eyewitness like a man standing on a 3 street corner that sees an accident and the 4 policeman says, did you see something? he says 5 yes. no axe to grind. 6 he has no interest in being a courtroom 7 doctor; he just likes to treat patients. he 8 was involved in the diagnosis and treatment of 9 leo's lung cancer. he said it was clearly from 10 smoking. ninety percent of all lung cancers 11 are from smoking. he was unrebutted. 12 and as dr. burns reflected on, all the 13 other physicians who treated -- berkowitz, 14 rosenthal, cohen -- every treating physician, 15 all of the innocent, independent, believable, 16 unimpeachable witnesses said the man had a 17 smoking-related disease. 18 he smoked an awful lot of cigarettes a 19 really long time, just like any generic smoker; 20 he succumbed to smoking-related cancer, and it 21 killed him. there is no doubt about that. 22 there is no opposing testimony to that effect. 23 there is rumor, innuendo, speculation, 24 supposition and arguments by the defendant to 25 try to picket it, punch some holes in it; but i 1 think that the evidence has been very -- 2 i think you will find the evidence is 3 manifestly apparent that it is clear, it is 4 simple, what he died from. 5 and here's an example: when it suits the 6 purposes of the defense -- when it suits the 7 purposes of the defense for them to use 8 something having to do with smoking-related 9 cancer in what could be a very simple 10 proposition -- 11 meaning, did leo skolnick die from 12 smoking cigarettes? yes. you could say that 13 in two seconds flat. dr. davis could say that. 14 the death certificate says he died of lung 15 cancer. in two seconds flat, you could say 16 that. did he die of smoking cigarettes? it 17 should not be a hard thing to determine. 18 we know now, even though conceptually 19 it is hard to wrap your mind around the fact 20 that there is a thousand documents we found that 21 say that ain't nothing but a nicotine syringe, 22 that ain't nothing but drugs, and it makes you 23 addicted, it makes you dependent, you continue 24 to smoke and your free choice is impaired, it is 25 constrained. we know that. that should be 1 simple. 2 you get a guy like dr. davis, he comes in 3 in two minutes, bom, boom, bing, no doubt about 4 it. 5 dr. kleinman testified from the cat scans 6 the man had lung cancer. he did not have colon 7 cancer. they kept giving him colonoscopies. 8 the colonoscopies were normal. is that fair to 9 put forth a defense to suggest a man -- 10 bring in a witness, a gastroenterologist. 11 dr. rosenthal -- 12 objection, your honor, 13 unfair argument -- 14 the court: overruled. i'm going to 15 allow it. 16 mr. schlesinger: dr. rosenthal is the 17 treating doctor that took care of him for colon 18 cancer. he was -- the testimony is he was 19 cured of colon cancer. 20 two months before he was diagnosed with 21 lung cancer, they did a colonoscopy. he did not 22 have a recurrence of colon cancer. why would 23 they -- 24 why suggest that? if you want to come in 25 the courtroom and say, we have a defense, 1 here's what it is, put up some evidence of it, 2 not just take a potshot at our clear 3 evidence -- 4 because folks -- folks like to fill in 5 the blanks. folks want to say, you know what? 6 we heard a bunch of stuff, but what did not we 7 hear? what blanks do you want to fill in? 8 and so i think question 1, all the folks 9 said addiction, there was not any fuss about 10 that. lay people said it, treating doctors 11 with no axe to grind said it. 12 the world's leading authority, dr. burns, 13 synthesized it for you and said, yes, your 14 smoking behavior is as a result of some part of 15 your constrained choice, you can no longer say 16 it is a free choice; and so, therefore, you 17 continue to smoke lots and lots and lots of 18 cigarettes for a really, really long time, and 19 over a period of time the genetic changes occur 20 and eventually you get lung cancer. 21 so that is -- that is the class membership 22 for the folks from the period of time from '92 23 to '96, is that they were addicted to the 24 nicotine in cigarettes and got a 25 smoking-related disease. that is a simple 1 question and answer. 2 dr. davis remembered he was a heavy 3 smoker. it was a vague recollection, but he 4 remembered it, and we put that evidence before 5 you. now, it was arduous -- 6 and we do not know how much evidence you 7 need. we do not know. and that is one of the 8 things that i apologize for. i'm sorry. 9 it is like studying for exams when you are 10 in college, and your head is so full of 11 information, it is leaking out of your ears and 12 your mouth and your nose. 13 when i wake up in the middle of the 14 night, tossing and turning, i'm writing stuff 15 down. i cannot even -- i can hardly read what i 16 wrote down, but i say, i got something to say, 17 i know it is here, i know it is going to come out 18 of me, i do not know what it is. 19 i got a head lamp, i click it on, write 20 something down, because i want to tell you 21 something, because i want to convince you, i 22 want to persuade you, i want you to see it our 23 way, without distractions, as to what the true 24 evidence is. 25 and i'll give you an example. sunny. 1 sunny. was there any debate in this 2 courtroom -- was there any problem from the 3 defendants, from these fine lawyers -- 4 and they are fine lawyers. they do a good 5 job, smart guys, for their client. no -- no 6 getting around that. 7 was there any debate, though -- 8 when mr. belasic came up and said on 9 many, many occasions, when it suits his 10 purposes, that, well, mr. skolnick -- 11 his own beloved sister died, and she 12 smoked cigarettes. and the skolnicks 13 associated the smoking of cigarettes with her 14 death, and should not that have been a piece of 15 information that would have helped him quit? 16 he had the choice to quit, why did not he quit? 17 he knew this was harmful. why did not he quit? 18 it is a fair question and we are going to 19 talk about that in the fault phase. in the 20 fault phase. but it is got nothing to do with 21 class membership. 22 question 1 is only this (indicating); and 23 whether or not mr. skolnick could have quit is 24 not in dispute. 25 we accepted some responsibility when we 1 get to those percentages of fault. we did not 2 have to. mrs. skolnick wanted to accept, and 3 said the human weaknesses -- 4 he -- could he have tried harder? fair 5 game. could he have? we know a lot of people 6 have quit, but a lot of people have not quit. 7 we know a lot of people try to quit, and 8 something like only three percent of people in 9 the given course of a year, out of millions, 10 succeed in quitting, that it takes many, many 11 times to quit. it is a relapsing brain disease. 12 and a lot of people do not get around to 13 quitting until it is too late. 14 and here's a man that is so addicted, that 15 that nice lady -- i forget her name -- came in 16 and said, who smokes after you get addicted -- 17 after you get diagnosed with lung cancer and 18 you are sneaking cigarettes, you are taking 19 cigarettes from your friend that are nasty, 20 dirty, half-smoked cigarettes and sticking them 21 in your pocket? that is addiction. 22 so that is an easy question. there is 23 nothing in there that is going to say what the 24 definition of "addiction" is. this book has 25 got a million and one consensus ways of 1 determining addiction, talking about smoking in 2 the morning when you are depleted, smoking a lot 3 of cigarettes. 4 eighty to ninety percent of regular smokers, 5 pack-a-day smokers, are dependent upon the 6 nicotine, and it drives them. 7 so if some of his smoking behavior -- 8 a significant, important part of why he 9 smoked was because he was dependent on 10 nicotine, and it can be for no other reason. 11 their own internal documents say, in 12 absolute terms, we are in the nicotine-delivery 13 business. that is it. 14 but there was no problem whatsoever -- 15 the clerk: you have used 45 minutes. 16 mr. schlesinger: thank you. 17 there was no problem whatsoever when they 18 talked about sunny. nobody said that we debate 19 whether sunny's smoking was the cause of her 20 lung cancer. why was not that a debate? 21 because tobacco companies, in the year 22 2000, finally, under duress, had to admit 23 smoking causes lung cancer. 24 objection, your honor. 25 the court: sustained. 1 mr. schlesinger: in the year 2000, and 2 never before -- never before -- 3 you saw those -- the ceos raise their 4 hands, and all gather before congress, the 5 ceos, the major executives of gigantic, huge 6 companies, raise their hands and lied right to 7 your face, in 1994, tobacco is not addictive, 8 okay? 9 there was no problem, though, inferring 10 that the smoking that sunny did was the cause 11 of her lung cancer when it suited their 12 purposes, so they would argue, well, that 13 should have motivated leo to quit. okay? 14 if she was in here trying to establish 15 that claim, do you think we would see it? 16 objection, your honor. 17 the court: overruled. this is argument. 18 i'm going to allow it. 19 mr. schlesinger: if she was in here, do 20 you think they would accept that so easily? 21 no. 22 because tobacco has admitted that -- now, 23 that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, just 24 not in people who sue us. tobacco has admitted 25 that cigarette smoking is addictive, just not 1 in people who sue us. 2 objection, your honor. 3 the court: sustained. 4 it is litigation. 5 the court: sustained. 6 mr. schlesinger: how many times has 7 dr. burns had to come into court to testify 8 about these simple, obvious facts? 9 objection. may we 10 approach, your honor? 11 mr. schlesinger: will you hold my time? [#deleted sidebar#] 7 the court: ladies and gentlemen, you 8 should disregard counsel's last statements, and 9 it should play no part in your deliberations in 10 this case. 11 you may proceed. 12 mr. schlesinger: please the court. 13 i want to talk to you about the -- 14 i was still on the reprehensibility? 15 the reason why we showed you as many of 16 the internal tobacco documents, which the 17 surgeon general '12, to this day, show how 18 current they are, is saying it is still being 19 analyzed by scientists, still subject to 20 scientific analysis, is because this is 21 current. 22 so, if the -- if the concept of class 23 membership -- 24 if mr. skolnick is a class member, as we 25 hope the evidence shows, because he needs to 1 have had a dependence to nicotine that drove, 2 to some extent, to a meaningful, significant 3 extent, smoking for a long enough period of 4 time to get a smoking-related illness, he is a 5 class member. 6 so, then, when a class membership is 7 determined -- and that should be a threshold 8 question, it is a preliminary question, and, 9 most importantly, it does not address the 10 concept of fault. 11 do not let the distinction get blurred in 12 your mind, that if mr. skolnick could have 13 tried harder to quit -- which we will concede 14 as a matter of his human weakness, he could 15 have tried harder -- that goes to a 16 determination of the degree to which you 17 believe he was partially responsible for what 18 happened to him because he did not work harder 19 to quit. 20 that is fault -- 21 objection, your honor, it 22 misstates the law, particularly douglas. 23 the court: ladies and gentlemen, this is 24 argument. let me, again, remind you that what 25 the lawyers say during their argument or, for 1 that matter, at any time, is not what the law 2 is. the law that you have is, what i have 3 given you, that is what you follow. 4 this is argument of counsel, and the 5 lawyers do not talk about the -- are not 6 evidence of the facts of the case. you recall 7 what the facts are. this is argument of 8 counsel. and the same applies to the 9 defendants. 10 you may proceed, sir. 11 mr. schlesinger: in any event, we are 12 many years down the road from the engle case. 13 these are engle progeny cases. 14 this is a request to you that he is a 15 member of the engle progeny class. threshold 16 determination, has nothing to do with 17 compensation for her loss of her husband, the 18 years that she did not get with her husband. 19 think about that when you determine how to 20 parse relative degrees of responsibility. 21 when i talked about a reprehensibility of 22 conduct, the important point i'm trying to make 23 with you is we are here for a day of reckoning, 24 punishment for past deeds. 25 it is the last question on the verdict 1 form: do you find, by clear and convincing 2 evidence, that punitive damages are warranted? 3 and we ask you to -- if you see it our 4 way, to indulge us with that finding, so that 5 you may find the tobacco company, for what they 6 did for over 50 years in engaging in an 7 enterprise which traded disease and death, 8 knowledgeably, with intent, on purpose, with 9 full understanding, for profits, for corporate 10 profits, that it was wrongdoing that does not 11 square with what we consider to be reasonable 12 in our society, and we are not so cynical and 13 our society has not degraded to that point, our 14 society is progressing, we are learning to live 15 together and respect each other, and we are 16 moving forward from past mistakes, and it is 17 the past mistakes and the airing out of them, 18 and the recognition of them and the rejection 19 of them by jurors like you that send a 20 deterrence to others, and a recognition, a 21 rejection of the conduct, saying we -- we used 22 to trust our businesses -- 23 leave it to beaver, the skolnicks, 1918, 24 1930, world war i, world war ii, people trusted 25 their government implicitly, they trusted their 1 corporations implicitly. now -- 2 objection, beyond the scope 3 of the evidence. 4 the court: sustained. 5 you can go ahead. 6 go ahead. 7 mr. schlesinger: so these are how we 8 would like you to answer these questions -- the 9 very last question. 10 you will have to go a little bit further. 11 you will have to come and listen to a little more 12 evidence and try to get it done; but that is -- 13 that is why -- that is really why we are here. 14 and mr. skolnick is a conduit to that 15 because he is one of the victims. he is one of 16 many. and the evidence you saw of all the 17 wrongdoing supports the idea that he is one of 18 many. 19 and the conduct you can consider not just 20 to him, but to everybody similarly situated, 21 the millions of americans who are sick and 22 dying by being misled about cigarettes. 23 now, there was lots of information out 24 there. there was songs like "smoke, smoke, 25 smoke," but the guy in "smoke, smoke, smoke" 1 says, i've been smoking them all my life, and 2 they have not bothered me yet. 3 and it was a catchy tune with a jingle, 4 and cigarettes sales kept going, and profits 5 kept going, and they spent a quarter trillion 6 dollars in advertising. 7 and emerson foote says in this book, in 8 the 2012 book, that it never ceases to amaze 9 him that only does the tobacco industry suggest 10 that their sales do not -- that their sales are 11 not driven by advertising. it is only in that 12 world. 13 the fact is, the 2012 book on youth 14 smoking has come to the definitive conclusion 15 that advertising, peer pressure and the like, 16 cause kids to smoke. 17 can we put up 79, please? 18 now, just an example. i cannot do all -- 19 i cannot do it all. you have got the evidence, 20 you can read it. i cannot do it all. i do not 21 have the time. here's an example of just an 22 out-and-out falsehood, lie, deception. 23 did not you see the statement of regret 24 from -- from dr. burns, that all those years 25 they faked him out, how many people died 1 because they did not know about the filters? 2 did not you see that? 3 here's what it says, in 1961, in the 4 internal documents. and this is not from a 5 couple of stupid people; this is from the chief 6 scientists, the chief corporate officers. huge 7 amounts of -- amalgams of attorneys and 8 scientists, scientists that were either duped 9 and unwitting, like dr. burns, whose intentions 10 were good, but were misled by the fake filter 11 fraud, the filter that causes worse cancer, 12 filter cancer, deeper adenocarcinomas in your 13 lungs, because the filters do not work, but it 14 will make people think something bad is coming 15 out of it. 16 and some guy invents a color-changing 17 filter that is got a food color dye in it, so 18 when you suck on it, it turns brown; and even 19 though it does not do anything for the filter, 20 people attach significance to it. 21 objection, your honor, 22 contrary to the evidence. 23 the court: overruled. 24 ladies and gentlemen, again, you are the 25 judges of what the evidence has or has not been 1 in the case. 2 this is argument, counsel. 3 mr. schlesinger: that is a document in 4 evidence you will see, disclosure of invention, 5 signed off by a bunch of people. people attach 6 a great amount of significance to the brown -- 7 that snowy-white filter turning brown at the 8 end; and if we could put a color-changing dye 9 in there that would change color, preferably 10 brown, folks will think the benefits are 11 obvious, even though it probably will not do 12 anything to help filter anything out. nothing 13 was being taken out of those filters. 14 so here's one. here's what they knew. 15 this is an internal document. carcinogens are 16 found in practically every class of compounds 17 in smoke. present technology does not permit 18 selective filtration of particulate of smoke. 19 meaning, we know -- 20 and that was that page with all those 21 cancer-causing chemicals. this is what their 22 internal scientists knew. that was in 1961. 23 then, when the surgeon general report was 24 being put together and they were giving 25 information to the surgeon general, here's what 1 they told the surgeon general: we are prepared 2 to submit the chemical and constituents of 3 smoke. none of the chemicals listed -- none of 4 the chemical substances listed therein, to our 5 knowledge, has been found by scientific 6 research to be harmful to the health of the 7 smoker in the amounts reported in smoke. it is 8 possible, of course, to modify the chemical 9 composition of cigarette smoke by the use of 10 filters. 11 cancer, no cancer. it cannot be removed 12 by filtration, it is impossible. it is 13 possible to remove it by filtration. 14 these things are not acceptable. what we 15 try to get you to do in this courtroom is see 16 things as they are, break through the immersed 17 desaturation effect of advertising, decades of 18 the normalizing of tobacco, to say, hey, you 19 know what? everybody had some idea about 20 tobacco, we know it is bad; but nobody, unless 21 they have read these internal documents, knows 22 just how bad it is. that is what is so important 23 to -- to think about. 24 the other thing about coming to a 25 decision that there should be punishment is 1 that this is a civil side of a courtroom. it is 2 not a criminal side of a courtroom. it is not a 3 state attorney/prosecutor talking about jail 4 time and sentencing. this is in the civil 5 realm. 6 the civil realm provides for the redress 7 of wrongs with fines and punishments. so you 8 sit in judgment and you are permitted to make a 9 determination that there should be punishment. 10 and one of the questions you have to 11 answer to get to that point is, you have to 12 decide was there reliance, was there inferred 13 contemplated reliance. 14 as the judge instructed you, it does not 15 have to be anything specific; it can be that 16 wallpaper, that endless onslaught, that 17 campaign of controversy and doubt -- 18 can we put that up, the controversy and 19 doubt, doubt is our product? 20 -- that keeps smokers smoking or gives 21 them a doubt or gives them a psychological 22 crutch to continue smoking, and using the 23 illusion of filtration to keep it going so 24 folks think, hey, something bad's being taken 25 out. 1 now, there is going to be a couple of 2 questions that pertain to both rjr and philip 3 morris, the two largest tobacco manufacturers. 4 they conspired with the groups that they 5 bought, owned and maintained: the center for 6 tobacco research, the tobacco institute 7 research council, the tobacco institute. those 8 were the guys -- they put out that frank 9 statement, saying, we accept as a paramount 10 responsibility among all -- above all other 11 responsibilities, the duty to safeguard the 12 public health, even above our own business. 13 and they said a bunch of times, if we 14 ever find anything bad, if we are doing 15 something bad, we are going to take it out. 16 well, that is promises and lies. they 17 made promises, but they told lies. and so they 18 said doubt is our product. it is also the 19 means of establishing a controversy. 20 go up to the top. 21 the committee has been formed, it is been 22 a successful defensive operation. 23 next. 24 we have to offer the smokers a 25 psychological crutch and self-rationale to keep 1 smoking. 2 and then, obviously, the key word is 3 "confusion." anything we can do to confirm 4 such a situation works to our advantage. 5 this is a smattering. there are millions 6 and millions and millions of pages. we can 7 only show a few. 8 down here. 9 and this is -- 10 what we are saying in the cigarette 11 controversy, the doubt campaign that they 12 created, is that it is going to be -- 13 it could be subject to the charge and may 14 be subject to the finding that we are making 15 false or misleading statements to promote the 16 sale of cigarettes. 17 it is an admission that what we are doing 18 is illegal. 19 and these are the documents we have. 20 the most important story is the one 21 that -- 22 objection, your honor. 23 mr. schlesinger: -- casts doubt -- 24 the court: overruled. 25 mr. schlesinger: and down here -- 1 i already did that. down here, please. 2 the ctr and the industry have publicly 3 and frequently denied what others find as 4 truth, in quotation marks. like what stephen 5 colbert says on his show, "truthiness." 6 right here: let us face it, we are 7 interested in evidence which we believe denies 8 the allegation that cigarette smoking causes 9 disease. 10 and they kept that going in the '50s, 11 when they had the health cancer scare, and then 12 the smoking shot back up in the '60s, the '70s, 13 the '80s, and the '90s. they never admitted 14 it, and so the reliance continued by leo 15 skolnick, who there is no evidence that he 16 rejected what they said. 17 the only evidence is from his wife that 18 he heard, in those congressional hearings and 19 what have you, that the companies were looking 20 into it and waiting to see what was going to 21 happen, and companies would not do that to folks 22 and we are going to see what happens. 23 his behavior to continue smoking, his 24 behavior of going to "light" cigarettes, is 25 evidence of his reliance on what they had to 1 say. and -- 2 the clerk: you used an hour, sir. 3 mr. schlesinger: thank you. 4 and the findings that are so -- that -- 5 it is as if you found them yourself. 6 i think of those findings as -- 7 i think about the statue at iwo jima, 8 where they took iwo jima and those guys were 9 holding the flag up, because we cannot ever 10 underestimate or overemphasize the importance 11 of the conclusions that were such -- such 12 important things to create. it is like -- 13 it is like an oak tree is growing, an oak 14 tree of truth, planted with the roots of those 15 findings that i'm asking you guys to water 16 today and keep it alive. 17 and if they take it and they shake it, 18 they can knock a leaf off now and then. that 19 can happen. but the truth that the evidence 20 showed us in this case is that a powerful 21 industry, dependent upon the perpetuation of a 22 tobacco epidemic, with no regard for the kind 23 of harm it caused, traded it for profits, and 24 it should -- no matter where we get to, that 25 must not be considered acceptable. 1 let us look at slide 68. 2 who has the willpower? 3 okay. let us look at the -- slide 70, 4 2004 sgr on addiction. 5 give you an example: does nicotine 6 addiction cause disease? 7 2004, nicotine addition. the scheme 8 linking nicotine addiction and lung cancer via 9 tobacco smoke carcinogens are their induction 10 of multiple mutations in critical genes. 11 so, nicotine addiction leads to cigarette 12 smoking, various biochemical changes, some of 13 which were explained by dr. burns, all the way 14 through to changing in the miscoding of the 15 dna, mutations, and then lung cancer. but you 16 see, this is the surgeon general: nicotine 17 addiction causes disease. 18 choice to quit is fault, is a percentage 19 of fault. we will go to that next. 20 let me show concurring. let me show 21 concurring cause, the original concurring cause 22 language, please. slide 7 or 1. 23 no, not that one. 24 do you have it? 25 okay. i saw eyes rolling in your heads. 1 and this is a standard instruction in many, 2 many different cases, it is a standard civil 3 instruction. it is the idea that more than one 4 thing may cause -- may cause a problem, or that 5 an illness can be caused by more than one 6 thing, or -- 7 it is not all or none. it is not black and 8 white. it is not always one or the other. the 9 judge gives you the law. 10 you see, you have a certain power. 11 i'm putting up this board. now, i'm 12 going to talk about something different, but 13 we will leave the board up. 14 all the power shifts to you. every 15 single thing we do, we turn over to you, and 16 then we sit and we bide our time. and it is 17 your case, and you have the power. 18 each one of you has the complete power 19 and authority to talk, to deliberate, to look 20 at the evidence, to consider it, to decide the 21 believability of the witnesses, the frankness 22 or lack of frankness of the witnesses, and you 23 have a special power. 24 one of the special powers you have is 25 that folks that call themselves experts, that 1 come in to give opinions, as opposed to 2 personal observations, like an unbiased 3 witness, like a dr. davis, who said he was an 4 addicted smoker that got lung cancer, that 5 should be the end of story. 6 they did not put on any witnesses to say 7 he did not have lung cancer from smoking. they 8 did not put on any witnesses to say that he 9 was not addicted. they could have put those 10 witnesses on. they provided no evidence. they 11 took potshots at ours. 12 but in the believability of expert 13 witnesses instructions, i want to tell you 14 something that gives you great power, because 15 we hand over great power to you today. 16 today, you have more power as citizen 17 government, as jurors, than you might ever have 18 in your entire life. this is a day of 19 incredible power. we turn it over to you, and 20 it is yours, okay? 21 here's one of the powerful tools i want 22 to give you. i want to give you the powerful 23 tool of the instruction regarding expert 24 witnesses, because expert witnesses are 25 different than regular people. 1 an expert witness that comes in here to 2 give an opinion is supposed to give an opinion 3 because he has qualifications, because he has a 4 scholarly life contribution to offer, with 5 teaching, and a life well lived, dedicated to a 6 meaningful, great purpose. that is a great 7 expert. that is how you judge how much does 8 this guy know. 9 if you hear someone who calls themselves 10 an expert and their opinion does not square 11 with what you think is what a true 12 scholastically valid expert should be, you are 13 authorized, specifically in the language for 14 experts, to reject that opinion. you can roll 15 that opinion right out of the courtroom. 16 and that is what i suggest you do with 17 dr. mcgregor, because when she came in here, 18 her opinions were unqualified and preposterous. 19 she did not even know the half-life of uranium. 20 uranium -- 21 and the half-life of uranium, a 22 radioactive substance, the half-life of it is 23 dependent upon its -- 24 the dangerousness of it is dependent upon 25 its half-life. if you do not know the 1 half-life, you do not know how radioactive it 2 is. 3 and that whole business was a 4 distraction. the whole -- the whole piece of 5 paper that they brought from the one case from 6 mrs. skolnick does not go to her being a 7 double-dipper or getting paid more than once. 8 the judge did not -- 9 his honor would never let us do anything 10 for improper purpose. 11 objection, your honor. 12 mr. schlesinger: it was supposed to come 13 in -- 14 the court: sustained, counsel. do not 15 comment about the court. 16 mr. schlesinger: the law says -- and 17 there is an instruction they read -- that this 18 came in for the purpose of determining whether 19 or not the cause of this gentleman's cancer had 20 something to do with an exposure to radiation, 21 okay? there is no evidence of it. there is 22 just no evidence of it. 23 and the witness that they put on to say 24 there was evidence of it, that talked about 25 thousands and thousands of pages, came up with 1 very little evidence to prove it. 2 and i submit that her testimony does not 3 come anywhere near the real experts, the world 4 experts, who came in here to talk to you about 5 what really caused this gentleman's cancer, and 6 that -- that the -- that even not recognizing, 7 from 115,000 to $180,000, how much she was 8 making -- and that is a lot, a lot, a lot of 9 money for what she did and what she had to 10 say -- she did not have the qualifications or 11 the proof to do anything -- 12 and she did not say that anything from the 13 plant -- any of the pollution from the plant 14 caused the cancer; but she did say that, of the 15 causes, lung cancer was a cause of his cancer. 16 concurring cause instruction, please. 17 okay, here. let me just do this for you. 18 ready? blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, 19 blah. 20 okay, take that down. go to the next 21 one, okay? that is because it is -- it is like 22 it is such an important instruction, and we have 23 committees and supreme court committees, we try 24 to work out the language, and it bends 25 everybody's mind. here is an easier way of 1 looking at it, okay? 2 and i'm not doing this to insult your 3 intelligence; i'm doing it because i cannot 4 understand the darn instruction. 5 in order to be regarded as a legal cause 6 of lung cancer and death, cigarette smoking 7 need not be the only cause. cigarette smoking 8 may be a legal cause of lung cancer even though 9 it operates in combination with radiation. 10 "radiation," what a great word. 11 what is -- what could be worse than cigarettes? 12 a nuclear bomb. plutonium, that could be 13 worse. ooh, it is like a jolly rancher, a sour 14 apple jolly rancher, mmm, it tastes so good. i 15 can say there was radiation, that is worse than 16 cigarettes. it is a distraction. there was no 17 radiation. 18 and if there was -- if there was, 19 sometime in 1959, 1966, if there was, in order 20 to be regarded as a legal cause of lung cancer 21 and death, the cigarettes need not be the only 22 cause. cigarettes may be a legal cause of lung 23 cancer even though it operates in combination 24 with radiation, if such radiation occurs at the 25 same time as the cigarettes and the cigarettes 1 contribute substantially to producing the lung 2 cancer and the death. 3 show her testimony to that effect. 4 and she testified and conceded to the 5 point we promised we would get you to have her 6 concede, in our opening statement, which was if 7 there are multiple causes, one of those 8 significant causes of death was smoking, and 9 she did not say that one of the significant 10 causes of death was radiation. 11 it is a dupe and a dodge, and it is a -- 12 it is a distraction. 13 show my -- the multiple risk factors. 14 this is dr. mcgregor: to the extent that 15 that is true in this case, we are talking about 16 multiple significant contributing causes of 17 mr. skolnick's lung cancer. you will agree that 18 smoking cigarettes was one of those causes, 19 true? 20 answer: that is true. 21 okay. so, let us go to my cigarette pack. 22 there is radiation, there is a smokestack. 23 cigarettes -- the smoke in the cigarettes 24 contained polonium-210. polonium-210. that is 25 an ionizing radiation with a very short 1 half-life, and over the course of 50 years of 2 smoking, it is a known, proven, contributing 3 cause of lung cancer. the distraction is 4 alternative cause. 5 i want to show the verified settlement 6 affidavit from mrs. skolnick. 7 i'd say we had a toxic exposure in this 8 courtroom from dr. mcgregor. she exposed -- 9 objection, your honor. 10 the court: sustained, counsel. 11 mr. schlesinger: pardon me? 12 the court: just argue the facts in 13 evidence. 14 mr. schlesinger: yeah. i think, in this 15 courtroom, what we heard about was another 16 substance. i'll call it "bolonium-180," 17 because that is what i think dr. mcgregor was 18 talking about. and i think she was talking 19 about it not for the honest purposes of men of 20 great concern for public health, but for the 21 corrupt purposes of an expert paid way more -- 22 objection, move to strike 23 counsel's opinion. 24 mr. schlesinger: -- than she should have 25 been paid. 1 he just said "i think." 2 the court: sustained. 3 mr. schlesinger: i think -- i'm sorry. 4 i hope you can draw from the evidence 5 that conclusion. 6 so, again, this is with regard -- 7 this evidence is received by you for 8 causation. i have to rebut this defense -- 9 i'll discuss it again -- but it is for 10 causation. it is to show you that everything 11 mrs. skolnick wrote on here was true. 12 mrs. skolnick said she filled this form 13 out. and we like to highlight and emphasize 14 important parts, but when mrs. skolnick had the 15 piece of paper from -- hearing a decade after 16 her -- her -- from hearing -- 17 after a decade after her husband was 18 dead, right, in the 2000-plus years, and 19 decades and decades -- 20 '66, '67, they closed the plant. he 21 smoked cigarettes the whole time. he was in 22 the plant where there was supposedly 23 something -- something coming out, and we will 24 talk about that on rebuttal a little bit. at 25 some point, she was involved in a case. 1 remember, this is one piece of paper from 2 the case, offered so that you know 3 mrs. skolnick wrote something, and it is going 4 to be used for causation, not to prejudice. 5 there is -- 6 the law says do not -- do not let prejudice 7 infect your verdict. do not let a misuse of it 8 suggest something that it is not for. it is for, 9 is there causation. 10 so, mrs. skolnick is not an expert 11 witness. if mrs. skolnick had filled this out 12 in this case and said cigarette smoking caused 13 lung cancer, you would not be allowed to see it 14 because expert witnesses testify about 15 causation of disease, unlike addiction, which 16 folks can recognize, because it is a dependence 17 upon a chemical. proof of the cause of an 18 illness comes from an expert doctor, a medical 19 trained physician that learns about it. 20 so here's what the page looked like. and 21 mrs. skolnick wrote her name in. 22 next page. next page, please. 23 okay. background information, her name, 24 his date of birth, 1918. it is going to be a 25 hundred years ago. 1 and remember, when you talk -- 2 well, i'm going to let mr. hammer deal 3 with the damages as soon as i stop and give him 4 time to do it. and i will, okay? 5 next page. 6 the clerk: you used an hour and 15 7 minutes. 8 mr. schlesinger: yes, that is why i'm 9 wrapping. 10 okay. where they lived -- 11 1959 is when she said she moved to 12 maxwell drive in westbury. 13 next page. background information. 14 next page. 15 okay. they emphasize the top of this 16 generic form, one page out of a giant lawsuit 17 that you do not know anything about except for 18 this, is whether or not this matters for 19 causation. okay? 20 the illnesses or injuries you are 21 claiming that caused the decedent's death, the 22 date of diagnosis and the decedent's age at 23 that time. for example, john doe, decedent, 24 was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1994, at age 25 52; right? 1 and what does she write down? 2 injury/illness, lung cancer; date of diagnosis, 3 october '92; age of diagnosis, 74. 4 let me just look at it from the 5 perspective you guys are looking at it. 6 is there a word on there that is not 7 true? it is truth. 8 is there a way in which an attorney can 9 interpret it to mean that she meant something 10 that she did not mean or going to get into a 11 state of mind? you will take that in mind. 12 can she testify as to what -- whether 13 uranium or whether cigarette smoking caused 14 lung cancer? is she qualified to do that? no. 15 and has everybody testified that 16 cigarette smoking caused lung cancer? yes. 17 and even if there was some uranium -- 18 and there was no plutonium at that plant, 19 there was no enriched uranium in that plant, 20 even if there was some -- some particle -- 21 there was that movie with dustin hoffman, 22 with the germ, and he went (indicating), and it 23 got in his mouth. it was like a cartoon. 24 even if that happened and it was a 25 contributing cause, the law permits you to 1 recognize that as long as that smoking, that -- 2 that pictogram i showed you was an 3 important cause of it. he takes -- he takes 4 the next step. he gets you guys to answer the 5 question and we move on. 6 next page, please. 7 okay. for the claimed illness and 8 injury, the symptoms the decedent experienced 9 before being diagnosed. it was lung cancer; 10 hoarse -- hoarseness and coughing, 1991. 11 it is true. she wrote down what they 12 asked her to write down. she filled out the 13 form. 14 next page. 15 how it was diagnosed. lung cancer, 16 x-ray. truth. 17 next page. 18 find a lie in here. this page, i submit, 19 is being used as a distraction. and if you 20 follow the law that says i will not let anything 21 cause me to be prejudiced against this woman, 22 then you will not be distracted, you will stick 23 on the fact of what tobacco has done to all 24 these folks for all these years, and you will get 25 us to the point where we can show you and 1 discuss with you punishment for reprehensible 2 behavior of an immoral business plan. 3 next. 4 next page, it talks about treatment. 5 that is true. 6 barry davis, he testified -- 7 and here, additional information about 8 the -- for the special master about the 9 specifics of the claim. 10 this is a worksheet. i mean, this is a 11 work in progress, and you saw nothing else -- 12 objection, your honor, no 13 evidence. 14 the court: it is argument. overruled. 15 mr. schlesinger: and, of course, you 16 will not see, on the verdict form, a reference to 17 verizon, sylvania, as to whether or not they 18 have a percentage of negligence in this case. 19 you will not see that question when we talk about 20 the percentages. 21 real quickly, look here. here's 22 something you have not seen. this document will 23 be in evidence. read it, consider it. 24 we did not bring this up in opening 25 statement because i do not want to be in the 1 defendant's defense. but now that it is here, 2 let us talk about it. the diagnosis was 3 ultimately confirmed at his death. 4 please provide any information you have 5 that confirms the diagnosis of the 6 injury/illness, as well as any other 7 information about the claim that you would like 8 the special master to consider. 9 his diagnosis was ultimately confirmed at 10 his death. the death certificate, which was 11 previously provided, states that lung cancer 12 was leo's cause of death. all true. 13 and how about this? leo also was 14 diagnosed with colon cancer in 1979 15 approximately, while we were still living in 16 westbury. he had surgery which stabilized his 17 illness. that is truth. 18 and if you want to be complete and candid 19 and give her the benefit of the doubt -- 20 and the standards of proof give us the 21 benefit of the doubt; and if you go back there 22 and you have some doubt -- 23 remember, doubt, controversy, other 24 factors, that is what their documents say. 25 doubt, controversy, other factors, unproven. 1 that is a truthful statement. he had lung 2 cancer, he had colon cancer. he lived through 3 the colon cancer, he died from the lung cancer. 4 she answered the questions truthfully. if you 5 think she can determine cause -- 6 where in there does it say uranium 7 exposure caused it? 8 where in there is there an expert report, 9 a doctor, somebody that came in and said that 10 it caused it? there is not. there never will 11 be. the only person they brought in was 12 dr. mcgregor. 13 with regard to the percentages of fault 14 for philip morris and rjr -- 15 i'm leaving time for mr. hammer, and i 16 would like to -- i think i'm going to give him 17 the floor for the next 25 minutes. 18 okay. put it up. put it up and i'll do 19 it. 20 so, question 3 and question 4 are what 21 get you to punitive damages. you have got to 22 jump over these hurdles, you have got to answer 23 these "yes." 24 if you see it our way and you want to get 25 to be able to reject this kind of conduct by an 1 american business over a 50-year period of 2 time, over a conspiracy, as laid out by those 3 engle findings and things like that, here's 4 what you need to do. 5 you will determine that he did, in fact, 6 justifiably rely to his detriment on an 7 intentional statement of material fact made by 8 each defendant after may 5th, 1982, that 9 intentionally omitted material information 10 concerning the health effects or addictive 11 nature of smoking cigarettes. and was such 12 reliance a legal cause of mr. skolnick's lung 13 cancer and death? and the answer to both of 14 those questions is "yes." 15 dr. burns explained it. you quit 16 smoking, you get healthier. 17 would he have died on the day that he 18 died if he stopped smoking afterwards? the 19 answer is no. 20 continued smoking accelerates the disease 21 process. continued smoking makes it happen 22 sooner. there is a much stronger certainty he 23 never would have gotten lung cancer if he had 24 stopped smoking by 1978. 25 but if they had come clean, if they had 1 said, you know what, what we did was wrong, 2 we are going to let you know, we are going to 3 hand you the truth of what we know internally 4 now, and we are going to say we are not going to 5 sell it the way we sold it, we are going to help 6 people get off cigarettes, we are not going to 7 oppose the introduction of -- 8 objection, your honor. 9 mr. schlesinger: -- nicorette gum -- 10 the court: sustained. 11 it is not evidence or a 12 claim in the case. 13 the court: sustained. 14 mr. schlesinger: they opposed the 15 introduction of nicorette gum by merrell dow. 16 we will show you -- 17 mr. lombardi: objection, your honor. 18 mr. schlesinger: -- those documents. 19 the court: sustained. 20 mr. schlesinger: they are in evidence. 21 the court: sustained, counsel. 22 okay. that is the second 23 time, judge. 24 mr. schlesinger: in evidence we have 25 documents from merrell dow. 1 put up the merrell dow documents. 2 in '84, '85, where there was an 3 opposition to the introduction of merrell dow, 4 okay? 5 if you look here, '82, '82, '85, when 6 merrell dow came up with nicorette gum, which 7 is the chewing gum, and one of the first things 8 as a nicotine replacement product in the early 9 days, the tobacco industry reacted with harsh 10 rejection of it and they threatened, they 11 lodged protests, and then they stopped buying 12 chemicals from merrell dow. 13 they were buying millions of dollars 14 worth of chemicals, and they thought about it, 15 with merrell dow, and they said -- and you will 16 see the letters in here -- that it interferes 17 with their business. 18 anything that merrell dow would do to 19 give smokers a way to get off cigarettes 20 offended the cigarette companies, they 21 boycotted the chemicals that they bought to use 22 in their cigarettes -- like the ammonia they 23 used -- and they were lodging protests, making 24 merrell dow stop putting out the anti-cigarette 25 smoking newsletters, and pushing to stop a way 1 of helping people get off cigarettes. 2 and this was not the first time. in the 3 '70s, leo abood came up with a scientific study 4 to look for a chemical antagonist to nicotine, 5 a way to get people off of nicotine; and they 6 said, it is my strong feeling that the progress 7 that has been claimed, we are in the process of 8 digging our own grave, and they rejected 9 dr. abood's attempt to come up with antagonists 10 to nicotine that would help people quit. and 11 they referred to themselves as people digging 12 our own grave. well, whose graves were being 13 dug, if not their own? 14 if they were opposing efforts to let 15 people stop smoking, they were promoting and 16 pushing them to continue to smoke, after the 17 '80s, which brings us back to that question of 18 reliance that we -- that we ask you to answer 19 "yes," after '82, all the way through '94, even 20 after the fellow was dead, after poor 21 mr. skolnick was dead, and the seven ceos were 22 still saying it -- mr. horrigan was saying it; 23 on nightline they were saying it to ted koppel, 24 they were saying it; and anne browder was 25 saying, we did not pay for those product 1 placements for superman, and they were doing 2 all of this. 3 and so the next question would be the 4 same, was it justifiable -- 5 did leo skolnick justifiably rely to his 6 detriment on any statement of material fact 7 made by defendants after 1982, in furtherance 8 of the agreement to intentionally omit 9 information concerning the health effects and 10 addictive nature of cigarette smoking; and, if 11 so, was the reliance a legal cause of his lung 12 cancer and death? 13 and, of course, it was, and you can infer 14 it from the overwhelming amount of energy and 15 effort they put into all of their prevention of 16 cessation and their promotion of smoking and 17 their reassurance of smokers. 18 folks, thanks. i'll have another chance 19 to address you, and then the defendants will, 20 too, and the case will be over. 21 i'll let mr. hammer offer some thoughts. 22 thank you. mr. hammer: thank you. 25 mr. schlesinger talked to you about 1 conduct of the tobacco companies, talked to you 2 about the evidence in the case that you heard, 3 talked to you about dr. mcgregor and why you 4 should disbelieve her. 5 i'm not going to cover all that stuff. 6 what i want to talk about is beatrice skolnick. 7 they got married; they fell in love. and 8 when they did that, she expected to live the 9 rest of his life -- of her life with him. 10 and if it were not for these companies' 11 products, she would have been able to do that, 12 but leo skolnick was ripped from her at age 75; 13 way too young. 14 people live a lot longer these days. 15 beatrice is 86. she is 86 years old. and look 16 at her, she is healthy as can be. hopefully 17 she is going to live another five, ten, 15 18 years. who knows in this -- 19 your honor, objection, it is 20 not evidence. 21 the court: overruled. it is argument. 22 mr. hammer: but we are asking you to 23 award money in this case to compensate her for 24 her loss. 25 and how do you come up with a figure? 1 how do you say, your husband's life was 2 worth something? 3 well, the tobacco companies said that 4 dr. mcgregor's time was worth $450 an hour. 5 they paid her $4,500 to be here two days in a 6 row to testify to you. they paid her $9,000 to 7 be here. $4,500 a day. 8 page 2. you all have the verdict form 9 and you are going to be asked -- 10 you would have checked off these boxes 11 already, and you are going to be asked to figure 12 out what is the total amount of damages 13 sustained by beatrice skolnick for the loss of 14 her husband's companionship and protection and 15 for her pain and suffering as a result of his 16 death. 17 how do you put a number on that? leo 18 died in 19 -- it was 1993. it is been 20 years. 19 twenty years that she is been without him. 20 would he have lived every single one of 21 those days? who knows? who knows? but if the 22 man did not start smoking cigarettes and did not 23 get addicted to their product and did not die 24 because of their product, odds are he would 25 have been here. and he would have been able to 1 see his granddaughters grow up and graduate. 2 he would have been able to do all the things he 3 wanted to do. 4 he would have been the one taking 5 beatrice on the cruises, instead of barbara. 6 he would have been doing those things. that is 7 what she is been deprived of, and that is why 8 we are here today. 9 well, they figured dr. mcgregor's time 10 was worth $450 an hour. think about this: 11 every single day, every single minute -- you 12 heard from beatrice -- she told you, i think 13 about leo, i think about him. it eats away at 14 her. she has not been with another man. she 15 still loves him. she still considers herself 16 married to him. she still has pictures in her 17 house, all over the place. she thinks about 18 him every day, talks to him, still goes to the 19 grave site. what is that worth? 20 well, it is been 20 years, 365 days a 21 year. every minute of the day she thinks about 22 him. if you put -- give her a thousand dollars 23 a day, a thousand dollars a day for the past 20 24 years, that is less than a dollar a minute. 25 less than a dollar a minute of her thinking 1 about him. every minute of the day she thinks 2 about him. if you do that, at $365 (sic) a 3 day -- a thousand dollars a day, 365 days a 4 year, times 20 years, for the past, that is 5 $7.3 million. i know that sounds like a lot. 6 it sounds like a ton of money; but in the 7 scheme of things, think about this. they paid 8 an expert to come in here -- 9 objection, your honor, it is 10 not proper evidence. 11 the court: overruled. i'm going to 12 allow it. it is argument. 13 mr. hammer: -- and tell you that leo 14 skolnick was exposed to radiation that did not 15 even exist. that is what they paid to try to 16 persuade you not to award beatrice any money in 17 this case. is that fair? 18 i'll tell you what. $7.3 million is 19 fair, in light of what they were willing to do. 20 and then, say, leo -- beatrice, for the 21 next -- hopefully -- who knows how long she is 22 going to live -- but, say, five, ten, 15 years. 23 i do not know. she is 86 years old right now. 24 say for another five years, that would come out 25 to $1.8 million. say for another ten years, 1 that would come out to $3.6 million. that is up 2 to you. hopefully she is around for another ten 3 years. i would suggest -- 4 say only five. put in $1.8 million 5 dollars right there. i think that is fair to 6 compensate a woman who is lost the love of her 7 life, her soulmate, the person that she planned 8 on spending the rest of her life with at less 9 than a dollar a minute, compared to what these 10 companies have done, 50 years, throughout the 11 course of leo skolnick's life. 12 you know, we are going to talk about -- 13 mr. schlesinger talked to you about 14 punitive damages and whether or not they are 15 warranted in this case. and they most 16 certainly are. 17 danny, what i want to do is go through 18 some photos. and just start from the 19 beginning. this is -- go to 2 and then just -- 20 this is beatrice skolnick's life and leo 21 skolnick's life together. pictures of them 22 with their kids, as they grow up. this was his 23 life. this was her life with him. it was 24 special, something that should be valued, 25 something that should be treasured, something 1 that should be looked upon as something that is 2 really special. 3 people looked at them and said, wow, what 4 a couple. they are like -- they are like one. 5 and you heard sylvia gross talk about how 6 people looked upon leo and beatrice like, what 7 a special relationship. and they had a great 8 life together. but it should not have been cut 9 short at 75. there is something wrong with 10 that. and it is only because of what these 11 companies did that he is gone. 12 yeah, you know what? leo smoked and he 13 should be held accountable for that. and he 14 should be held, to some point, to blame for 15 some of that, and beatrice recognizes that. 16 let us go to the verdict form, page 1. 17 percentages of fault. you are going to be asked 18 to determine, philip morris, r.j. reynolds, are 19 they at fault in this case? come on. of 20 course, they are. are they totally blameless? 21 for what you got to see, that very few people 22 get to see, you know now, yeah, they are on 23 legacy and you can go up there and look and 24 there is books written by dr. proctor and 25 other -- other people that talk about the 1 internal documents; but unless you specifically 2 look for that, nobody gets to see it. you guys 3 got to see something that very few people ever 4 get to see. you saw what makes this company 5 tick. and what makes this company tick is 6 money, at the cost of human life and at the 7 cost of leo skolnick. 8 so are they responsible? yeah. i would 9 say that leo may be responsible for his 10 inability to quit, for his continued smoking, 11 maybe he did not try hard enough if you all 12 think that, but in comparison to them, i would 13 suggest leo maybe twenty percent, and these 14 companies, these companies, forty percent each for 15 a total of a hundred percent. 16 beatrice accepts some fault; but a man 17 who starts smoking as a kid, somewhere between 18 ten and 17, according to dr. burns, who 19 continues to smoke their product for years and 20 years and years, and is fooled by them, by 21 their advertising, by what they are saying to 22 the public, our product, do not worry about 23 it -- 24 picture this. 1954, when the science 25 started coming out, imagine the difference if 1 they would have taken out this frank statement 2 and it would have said: a frank statement to 3 smokers -- 4 instead of saying we take the 5 responsibility for our smokers and we are going 6 to hire scientists, think about if they took 7 out a full-page ad that said this: a frank 8 statement to smokers: quit, because it will 9 kill you. 10 imagine if they did that, what impact 11 that would have had over the next 50 years on 12 smokers, what impact that would have had on a 13 man like leo skolnick. 14 in 1954, when the science started coming 15 out, and the tobacco companies took out an ad, 16 instead of saying we are going to hire the best 17 scientists, we are going to care about our 18 smokers, we are going to care about our 19 customers, we are going to do the right thing, 20 imagine if they said and spent $450,000 on an 21 ad in every major newspaper across the states, 22 and said, we are going to take out a frank 23 statement, quit, because it will kill you. 24 what impact would that have had? 25 we would not have had all the deaths we have 1 had over the years. and leo skolnick would 2 have quit. because that is what the companies 3 that made the product told their own customers. 4 if they really would have cared -- 5 that is what a responsible company does. 6 that is what a company that cares about their 7 customers does. and in the -- 8 in america -- in america -- corporations, 9 yeah, they are here to make money; but if you are 10 going to make money, do it the right way, do not 11 kill people. do not kill people for a product. 12 that is what they have done. 13 and they continue to do it, which is why 14 we ask you to hold them to be responsible, 15 which is why we think the amount of money we are 16 asking for, 7.3 million for past pain and 17 suffering, 1.8 million for future pain and 18 suffering, that is reasonable under the 19 circumstances. 20 and that is why we are asking you to check 21 off that box that these companies should be 22 punished. they should be, because they have not 23 changed. nothing's changed. they still do it. 24 still do it. 25 beatrice skolnick misses leo 1 tremendously. 2 go to number 8. beatrice does not want to 3 be here. she would rather have spent the last 4 20-plus years beside leo, not in a courtroom. 5 do you think that is how she wants to 6 spend her life at 86 years old, in a courtroom? 7 i think you all know better than that. she is 8 here for justice for leo. you all -- 9 as mr. schlesinger said, you all have 10 great power, great power. you have the 11 opportunity today, in your deliberations, to 12 turn to these companies, some of the most 13 powerful companies in the world, and say, what 14 you all have done for the past 50 years, and 15 continue to do today, is just wrong. we -- we, 16 as citizens of this great country, are not 17 going to tolerate it, we are not going to put up 18 with it. 19 objection, your honor, 20 "send a message" argument. 21 the court: excuse me? 22 "send a message," you have 23 ruled out. 24 the court: sustained. 25 mr. hammer: that is -- 1 the court: go ahead. 2 mr. hammer: we are not going to tolerate 3 it. we think what you did was wrong, and we 4 think what you did -- 5 your honor, you just 6 sustained that. 7 the court: sustained. 8 what you told him he cannot 9 do -- 10 the court: we have got two people arguing 11 the same thing. let us move on. 12 mr. hammer: as far as a punishment, 13 check off that box so that we can proceed to 14 the next phase. 15 as far as damages in this case, what 16 these companies did damaged beatrice skolnick's 17 life. and it is not going to bring leo back. 18 you cannot do that in a courtroom. 19 all we can do is say to these companies, 20 you took somebody that beatrice skolnick loved 21 away from her. 22 seventy-five years old, the man should 23 not have died at that age. you see pictures of 24 him. the guy's looking good; he is looking 25 healthy. you saw pictures with his shirt off. 1 the guy was in good shape, in good shape until 2 the cancerous stuff that he ingested day in and 3 day out developed a tumor in his lung and 4 killed him. 5 and it was only because of this company's 6 product, the nicotine-delivery device, that 7 they highly engineered, that they perfected 8 into this little product, that if you use it as 9 intended, you use it like they marketed it, 10 it is ultimately going to kill you. 11 and they knew that for 50 years, and hid 12 it from the american public, hid it from leo. 13 that is why we are here, to seek justice. 14 mr. schlesinger will have a chance to 15 speak to you after defense counsel talks to 16 you. i ask you to pay careful attention to 17 what defense counsel says, and then i ask you 18 to pay careful attention to mr. schlesinger's 19 final argument, too. 20 we have proven our case by a greater weight 21 of the evidence and then some. give beatrice 22 the justice she seeks. that is what we ask you. 23 thank you very much. 20 mr. schlesinger: if you can fill the 21 unforgiving minute with 60 seconds worth of 22 distance run, then yours is the world and all 23 that is in it. what is more, you will be a man 24 my son. 25 so i have a little bit of time left to 1 justify our position in the case, and i'm going 2 to jump in and try to rip through a bunch of 3 the stuff. 4 and to the extent i feel something needs 5 to be unmasked, that is what i'm going to do. 6 i'm going to start right now with the issue of 7 addiction. i did not think i would have to 8 address it as much as i did. but right out of 9 the box, i want to see number 60, please. 10 all right. now, the surgeon general '10s 11 report. i'll tell you right now, if you are 12 still taking notes, write down page 16 and page 13 17. in page 16 and page 17 of this book is 14 everything you need to know about a filter 15 fraud that went on for decades from 1966 until 16 the year 2008, at which time the ftc rescinded 17 its guidance. 18 it permitted, because it had been misled 19 by the tobacco companies that said we will give 20 them a double, a triple, a quadruple filter. 21 we will give them the psychological crutch to 22 keep smoking. the illusion of filtration is 23 just as important as the fact of filtration. 24 and we saw a historian, we saw a witness 25 to history, dr. burns, he was in essence the -- 1 the man of the surgeon general for decades when 2 he was being fooled. 3 you saw, if you look at the demeanor of 4 the witness, the regret, the lives lost, the 5 disappointment in that man's attitude because 6 he was misled. they had a filter. the machine 7 smoked the cigarette. it had ventilation holes 8 in it. 9 the machine misread the fact that the 10 smoker compensated, covered the holes, drew in 11 deeper inhalations and got the nicotine, which 12 is all that smoking is, that they needed to 13 sustain their addiction. without nicotine, our 14 business would collapse. 15 without nicotine, there would be no 16 smoking. 17 and finally, after the revelation in 2000 18 of the internal documents and the analysis by 19 scientists, the ftc, the federal trade 20 commission said: we are rescinding our 21 guidance. you cannot advertise that filters are 22 better. you cannot use that health reassurance. 23 it is to create the controversy without 24 actually denying it. all of the ftc reports 25 are also in evidence talk about the 1 advertising. it always shows youthful, healthy 2 people. it never addresses the health issues. 3 we had to give the smokers a 4 psychological crutch. in 2008, you will see in 5 page 16 and 17, in this book here. they had to 6 rescind their guidance and no longer finally 7 could you say that filters are safer. a 8 half -- 450,000 people a year are still dying. 9 there is been no reduction in death. they 10 are trying to say that filters are safer. is 11 that like saying if you fall off a 50-story 12 building, that is safer than falling off a 13 75-story building? 14 finally, from 1966 to 2008, 42 years, 15 they figured it out. and in 16 and 17, we read 16 it to you during trial. it is really long 17 language. but it says the industry was so far 18 ahead of us on this, they knew so much more, it 19 took decades for the public health authorities 20 to figure it out. 21 and they make my point. they proved my 22 case for me. they showed that my client relied 23 because they say: the public health 24 authorities say, yeah, try to quit if you can. 25 but if you cannot, smoke these filters, they are 1 better for you. of course he saw it. 2 and mr. belasic -- these are good 3 lawyers. mr. belasic is picking and choosing. 4 he is decided my long-dead client, what he did 5 see and did not see. 6 my client saw the reader's digest, but he 7 did not see all of the repetitive, forceful 8 rebuttals of the reader's digest, and that is a 9 document in evidence too, where they said we are 10 going to forcefully refute what the reader's 11 digest is saying. 12 the makers of the reader's digest would 13 be spinning in their graves, because they were 14 anti-tobacco, they were smart. but they were 15 drowned out. 16 this document talks about advertising. 17 in one day, the tobacco companies spend more 18 money in advertising than the entire public 19 health authority on smoking and health spends 20 in a year. they drowned out the message. 21 and they, in the engle findings say, they 22 misled, they concealed, they were guilty of 23 conspiracy and fraud. and they did it with the 24 intent that their customers would rely. 25 my client, mr. skolnick, was their ideal 1 customer. he did what they wanted to do. they 2 did not want him to quit. they wanted him to 3 keep smoking. 4 what makes you smoke, nicotine. that is 5 the only thing that makes you smoke. 6 it is deceptively put in a package to make 7 it look normal. but the fact of the matter is, 8 nicotine addiction is what causes disease. 9 nicotine addiction is the fundamental 10 reason that individuals persist in using 11 tobacco products, and this persistent tobacco 12 use contributes to many diseases described in 13 this report. 14 see, nicotine addiction is the 15 fundamental reason that individuals persist in 16 using tobacco products, and this persistent 17 tobacco use contributes to the many diseases in 18 this report. 19 without the compound nicotine, there 20 would be no smoking. if nicotine were taken 21 out of our product, the entire market would 22 collapse and we would lose our businesses 23 overnight. 24 and they did not want to do it, and they 25 made a decision. it was a grisly, gruesome 1 decision that is cost the lives of 12 million 2 americans. now that is reprehensible. that 3 calls for a day of reckoning. 4 mr. skolnick was a generic smoker, one of 5 the many who relied on the public health's 6 reassurance, and what chance did mr. skolnick 7 have of figuring this out if they had dr. burns 8 fooled. 9 by the way, they are quoting from my 10 experts. dr. burns said my man, mr. skolnick, 11 was highly addicted. dr. proctor said they put 12 together the greatest -- the greatest 13 conspiracy, the greatest distraction campaign 14 in the history of the world and that it cost 15 millions of lives. 16 so ... 17 in 1989, two factors refute the argument 18 smoking is a matter of free choice. most 19 smokers start smoking as teenagers and then 20 become addicted. 21 and this is from the memo that says -- 22 this is from an internal memo: cigarette 23 smoking -- september 9, 1980, cigarette smoking 24 is more addictive than using heroin. this is 25 what they knew. 1 remember, they denied it. they lambasted 2 it. they said the surgeon general was 3 intentionally misleading the public. and 4 that is the things that mr. skolnick was 5 hearing. 6 i do not think the questions i now raise 7 are academic. the lawyers remind us i'm told 8 that the entire matter of addiction is the most 9 potent weapon a prosecuting attorney can have 10 in a lung cancer cigarette case. 11 i'm in a lung cancer cigarette case. i 12 am a prosecuting attorney, and i am telling you 13 30 years later, they are still able to use this 14 defense before you -- 15 mr. lombardi: objection, your honor. 16 the court: sustained. 17 mr. lombardi: your honor. 18 the court: disregard the last statement 19 of counsel, please. 20 mr. schlesinger: the language i heard 21 from mr. belasic is a tautology. in the same 22 voice that he says: we now agree it is 23 addictive, he then denies it is addictive. 24 because if you say, oh, well, he was not 25 addictive, because he could have quit. that is 1 got nothing to do with addiction. when he says 2 if he was addicted, he could have chosen to 3 quit and therefore he caused his own disease, 4 that is a tautology. that is a denial of 5 addiction. that is saying addiction does not 6 exist. it is just a habit. 7 it is one of the most powerful addictions 8 known to man. it is the greatest addictive 9 substance in this country. 44 million people 10 are smoking cigarettes regularly. 440,000 a 11 year are dying, and they are going to continue 12 to die because they are continuing to addict 13 children. because there is no smoking. there 14 is no business without replacement smokers 15 under 18 years of age. little adolescent 16 brains. that is what is reprehensible. 17 and it is not mr. skolnick, who obviously 18 was a smoker at a very young age, who fit into 19 the category of smokers that dr. burns talked 20 about, who met his wife in 1947 smoking camels, 21 an rjr product, and i apologize that the arc of 22 the moral universe is long, but it bends 23 towards justice that i am not able to produce a 24 95-year-old man in this courtroom for you to 25 testify i was one of the street toughs, i 1 guarded those hoodlums' cars, we bought lucy 2 cigarettes with the pennies we made. 3 i'm sorry i cannot produce that. they 4 want to be rewarded for that? 5 not one time did these gentlemen -- and i 6 will say they are fine gentlemen, and they did 7 a great job. they gave a good closing 8 argument. very convincing, they stitched 9 things together. 10 but not once did they address the 11 documents. and you know what the road to 12 redemption is, recognizing and apologizing 13 something when something has been wrong -- 14 mr. lombardi: your honor. 15 mr. belasic: objection. 16 the court: sustained. 17 counsel. 18 mr. schlesinger: okay. 19 we take our fair share of responsibility. 20 our fair share of responsibility. we want to 21 be candid. we want to be transparent. we want 22 to say mr. skolnick did not have the sufficient 23 internal motivation that met the external 24 support. 25 remember what dr. burns said, to allow 1 him to quit before he died like so many other 2 dependent smokers like him. 3 we wish he did, and he wants to say, 4 okay, we will take some responsibility. they are 5 not taking any. there was not an admission 6 that maybe what we did over those -- 7 mr. belasic: objection, your honor, 8 sustained. 9 the court: overruled. i'm going to 10 allow that argument. 11 mr. schlesinger: there was not -- they 12 may admit, they may -- on that board, we put 13 40, 40 and 20. they said even if you agree he 14 was a class member, even if you get through all 15 that and class membership is only -- was he 16 dependent on cigarettes, the nicotine in the 17 cigarettes, yes, he was. 18 did that drive that disease? yes, it 19 did. and did that result in a disease process? 20 it absolutely did. 21 where is dr. rosenthal's -- 22 mr. gdanski: 50. 23 mr. schlesinger: i had it here. 24 mr. gdanski: it is up. 25 mr. schlesinger: okay. 1 did you want me to bring more witnesses? 2 i could have brought everyone. i could have 3 brought every doctor. when would it have been 4 that you would have come out of the box? i 5 do not know. but i got a distinct impression 6 that you would heard enough. 7 so we put on experts and independent 8 treatings and we put on the records from 9 dr. rosenthal that says history of colon cancer 10 without recurrence. he was cured of the 11 disease. 12 did i finish with the shook hardy? 13 mr. gdanski: yes. 14 mr. schlesinger: can we show horrigan? 15 mr. belasic: objection, your honor, 16 violates your order -- may we approach? 17 the court: sure. [#deleted sidebar#] 25 the court: go ahead, sir. i'm sorry. 1 mr. schlesinger: what i was saying -- 2 and we are going to pull up another video before 3 we talk about post-'82 matters. 4 but again, the nicotine stains the 5 smoking. the doubt campaign, the controversy 6 campaign sustains the psychological crutch that 7 permits people to continue smoking. 8 mr. skolnick, through his loving wife, 9 has said i want to accept some responsibility. 10 i said, we did not have to do that. volunteered 11 to say maybe our human weaknesses were not 12 enough. maybe we could have tried harder. 13 whether or not she quit and he did not 14 quit just means she was able to quit, he was 15 unable to quit because he was addicted. 16 if his sister died of a disease and he 17 kept smoking, all the more reason to show 18 that is that dependence on nicotine. 19 but we want to accept a fair share of 20 blame. you may think -- and i love ham -- 21 steve hammer, we grew up since 12 years old. 22 mr. belasic: objection, your honor. 23 the court: sustained, counsel. 24 mr. schlesinger: i think he gave too 25 much percentage to the skolnicks. 1 my view of the evidence i would argue to 2 you would be that the vast majority of smokers 3 in those ages of innocence with the doctors and 4 everything else and those kids that started 5 that were never told that the tobacco companies 6 never leveled with, never came clean with do not 7 really deserve any meaningful measure. 8 i want you to know. you do not have to 9 give twenty percent. you could give less. and in 10 all candor, you can give more. you can say, 11 you know what? it is 25. you could say it is 12 50/50. you can do any number combination you 13 want because you have the power. all we are 14 doing is making suggestions. 15 if $9 million in compensatory damages is 16 too much and mr. skolnick may not have been 17 here to see us in this courtroom because it is 18 been so many years, he would be in his late 19 90s, so be it. adjust accordingly. whatever 20 the simultaneous ages they live with together, 21 you consider that. whatever you think is fair. 22 we are obligated on behalf of our client 23 to give you some help in that regard. 24 okay. go. 25 (the video clip was played and taken down 1 to the best of the reporter's ability as 2 follows:) 3 voice: earlier this week the 4 r.j. reynolds tobacco company took out this ad 5 in a number of newspapers and magazines calling 6 for an open debate about smoking. 7 in brief, the ad contends that medical 8 studies which show that cigarette smoking 9 causes disease are ignoring significant 10 evidence to the contrary. 11 voice: cigarette smoking does not cause 12 cancer, yes or no? 13 voice: it is not known whether 14 cigarettes cause cancer. has not been causally 15 established. 16 voice: cigarette smoking, no causal 17 relationship between cigarette smoking and 18 emphysema? 19 voice: despite all the research today, 20 there has been no causal link established. 21 voice: no causal relationship between 22 cigarette smoking and heart disease? 23 voice: no. as a matter of fact, there 24 are studies that while we are accused of being 25 associated with heart disease, there have been 1 studies conducted over ten years that would say 2 again that science is still puzzled over these 3 forces. 4 (video clip concluded.) 5 mr. schlesinger: now that is 1984. this 6 is after 1982. we want to get to punishment 7 damages, you find reliance after that period of 8 time, and certainly that is just one of many. 9 i will tell you this. let us talk about 10 dr. mcgregor again. more than i want to have 11 to talk about dr. mcgregor. the atsdr that i 12 cross-examined with, the governmental agency 13 that deals with toxic substances, does not 14 classify natural or uranium as a cancer-causing 15 agent. 16 and we went into a challenge over if 17 something has radiation, how dangerous is it? 18 it depends on how radioactive it is, and there 19 were not any nuclear bombs or enriched uranium 20 on that site. she could not cite any amount -- 21 mr. lombardi: objection, your honor, 22 contrary to the evidence. 23 the court: overruled. 24 ladies and gentlemen, you are the finders 25 of the fact. you recall what the testimony 1 was. this is argument of counsel. 2 mr. schlesinger: she thought she said 3 there might have been 100 pounds of enriched 4 uranium that went through there. 5 but the fact of the matter is that over a 6 20-year period of time, 10 million pounds of 7 natural uranium, and this is -- uranium did not 8 stay there, it got passed through, and counsel 9 for defendant told you that mrs. skolnick 10 did not know what they were doing in that plant 11 back then. she did not find out until 10, 20 12 years after she moved there. 13 but uranium decays slowly. 4.5 billion 14 years. not a million years. if you are going 15 to know anything there is to know about an 16 elemental substance such as uranium, a 17 natural-occurring uranium, you must know the 18 half-life in order to know the radioactivity. 19 let us go to the sworn testimony of 20 dr. mcgregor. number 77, please. 21 is not it true no studies which has been 22 performed support the conclusion that the 23 people who lived in the skolnicks' 24 neighborhood, including the skolnicks, were at 25 increased risk of development of lung cancer. 1 is not that true? 2 that is true. 3 do you remember those questions and did 4 you give those answers to those questions when 5 you were deposed? 6 yes. 7 is not it true you cannot specifically 8 demonstrate the presence of any enhanced levels 9 of radioactivity on the properties of plaintiff 10 surrounding the facility? 11 true. 12 you do not have a numerical amount or 13 specific amount of radiation exposure that 14 mr. skolnick had during his lifetime, do you? 15 no, i do not. 16 but you do know he had an ongoing 17 continuous exposure to cancer-causing chemicals 18 in cigarettes, including the radioactive and 19 radiation cancer-causing chemical polonium? 20 po210 on the elemental, the periodic table that 21 we learn about in high school. 22 before he moved to hicksville in the late 23 '50s, right? 24 right. 25 and all the way through until the day he 1 died. 2 polonium is the radioactive substance in 3 cigarettes that is known to cause cancer. we 4 put it up on the board. it is in the book. if 5 you do not believe me, look it up. 6 page 100 on is a whole chapter on 7 nicotine addiction. it is not free choice. it 8 constrains free choice. without nicotine, 9 there would be no smoking. 10 now,let me show you something. 11 let us go to 009. 12 remember they talked about mr.-- 13 lombardi. sorry, sir -- talked about there was 14 a release. a release, by the way, that 15 occurred before the skolnicks moved to the 16 neighborhood, a release into the air, from some 17 stack, and maybe there was some uranium that 18 burned and it got in the stack. 19 talking about fullerenes, west -- 20 buckyballs, westminster (sic) fullerenes. 21 the case is about smoking and cancer. 22 we are not here to talk about nuclear power 23 plants. they have injected themselves as a 24 distraction. 25 see what it says here, on one time, one 1 episode, concentration of 1100 disintegrations 2 per minute per meter cubed was found once in 3 june 1957 before my clients moved there. 4 now, this is an example of the skill of 5 the witness that never did a lung cancer case, 6 never did a radiation case. the only atomic 7 workers she had anything to do with was a paper 8 study where they would send a file on workers' 9 comp claims about whether they got cataracts. 10 and she admitted this is the first time 11 she is ever done it. and the amount of money 12 she earned was less than what she admitted to. 13 until we added it up, and it seemed 14 extraordinary. you will consider whether or not 15 it was. 16 now, 1100 dpms per minute. she said by 17 the way, as an example of her great knowledge 18 of this technical subject, which out of 19 thousands of pages, she pulled a couple of 20 pages out, that it was dissipations a minute. 21 it is not dissipations a minute. it is 22 disintegrations per minute. it is when little 23 atoms are jumping out of a radioactive 24 substance. 25 let us talk about 15. now, let us go to 1 the first page -- you see what this says? 2 transmitted herewith is the following 3 inspection report involving noncompliance. 4 sylvania corning nuclear corporation. they 5 showed you that. you see what this says? 6 bayside, new york. 7 mr. lombardi: your honor -- 8 mr. schlesinger: over in queens, in a 9 whole 'nother part in town. 10 mr. lombardi: your honor -- 11 mr. schlesinger: this is not hicksville. 12 the court: excuse me, counsel. there is 13 an objection, please. [#deleted sidebar#] 22 mr. schlesinger: here we go. can i 23 start my time again, mr. clerk? 24 the clerk: 21 minutes left. 25 mr. schlesinger: so, moving on. 1 now, this is the document that was in 2 evidence. it is pmup 025088004. i will show 3 you several parts of it. but here's what it 4 says here: sylvania corning nuclear 5 corporation, and there is an address, bayside, 6 new york. 7 now, remember, that is not the same 8 address as hicksville. counsel, when he had 9 the witness on the stand, was very careful, 10 often referred to sylvania, sylvania, sylvania. 11 however, i want to show you where this 12 document refers to with regard to this release, 13 even though it occurred before my clients ever 14 moved there. so that alone rules it out as 15 having relevance to my clients. anything that 16 puffed in the air could not have bothered my 17 clients when they were not there. 18 but, here is the address. bayside, new 19 york. that is queens. that is full on the other 20 side of town, 12 miles away. it is nowhere near 21 hicksville. nowhere near westbury. 22 next entry. 23 now, there are dates here on the 24 compliance inspection report. this is from the 25 same document. you will have it in evidence. 1 look at it yourself, and you make the 2 determination. 3 it also shows the same address, bayside, 4 new york. name and address of licensee, 5 sylvania corning. here is bayside. report. 6 it is a compliance inspection report. 7 next, please. 8 now, remember there was paragraph 15, 9 1100 dissipations per minute or 1100 10 disintegrations per minute in excess. look 11 here. the inspection report herein was 12 confined to an examination of uses of licensed 13 byproduct and source material and only the 14 bayside facility was visited. 15 so, it is a mistake, we submit, that was 16 made by dr. mcgregor in trying to tell you that 17 something happened near the family's house that 18 could have let something go into the air. it 19 was at a facility that was over 12 miles away. 20 is there anything else on that? all 21 right. thank you. 22 let us go on to the next thing. 23 that is paragraph 10. the inspection was 24 bayside. they discussed it and addressed it as 25 if it is hicksville. it was an error. that is 1 it out of 5,000 pages. it was not the same 2 place. 3 now, let me put up 30, please. 4 the -- there is a -- there is an old story 5 about the man who had a field, and one day a 6 goat got loose from a neighboring farm and came 7 into the man's field and ate all his cabbages. 8 and in the fuss that ensued, the defense 9 was, i do not have a goat. and if i did have a 10 goat, he did not eat your cabbages. and if he 11 did eat your cabbages -- 12 mr. lombardi: your honor -- 13 the court: sustained. this is improper 14 argument, counsel. approach. 15 mr. schlesinger: it is improper? [#deleted sidebar#] 3 the court: again, let me just remind 4 you, ladies and gentlemen, what counsel says is 5 not evidence. that goes for both sides and all 6 three counsel. what these documents say or 7 do not say is what you have to decide as a part 8 of your deliberations in this case. 9 so if counsel says something, 10 inadvertently or otherwise -- any of them -- 11 that you find different from the evidence, you 12 go by what the evidence is in this case, by 13 what the document actually says, rather than 14 what counsel, either for the defendant or the 15 plaintiff says it says. 16 go ahead. 17 mr. schlesinger: may it please the 18 court. 19 okay. and -- 20 the court: without the homilies. 21 mr. schlesinger: can i talk about the 22 cabbage? 23 the court: no, sir. you cannot -- we are 24 not going to talk about the stories. 25 mr. schlesinger: i was not sure what 1 objection we were on. 2 i'm sorry. 3 so anyway, we are going to talk about some 4 of the defenses in the case. and i will tell 5 you that a lot of material, if you take one 6 thing from me at face value, i will not 7 intentionally misrepresent anything to you. 8 i know you guys have all the evidence, 9 you have taken extensive notes, paid attention, 10 you are taking this seriously. you will get 11 this right. that is what we trust the jury 12 system to do, trust you independent folks to 13 get it right. 14 the defendants suggest a multiplicity of 15 defenses, and i suggest that by suggesting so 16 many of them, it dilutes the overall message of 17 their defenses. they say he was not addicted. 18 they say he did not have lung cancer. 19 what was interesting was mr. belasic in 20 his arguments to you when he was talking about 21 the radiation and the claims that mrs. skolnick 22 made was drawing a distinction and said he 23 did not die from colon cancer. he did not die 24 from colon cancer, in making the argument with 25 regard to the radiation claim and the words 1 "lung cancer" and "colon cancer" on her 2 handwritten stipulation. 3 he said it must have been because it is 4 wrongful death, as if she knew what that legal 5 term meant when she testified that she did not 6 understand it at the time. she filled out a 7 form. but he said she must have known what it 8 meant, because he did not die of colon cancer. 9 at what point does that belie? what does 10 that undermine from one of his defenses? he 11 wants you to think that he did die of colon 12 cancer. 13 did not he say to you he did not die of 14 lung cancer. you have a reason to believe he 15 died of colon cancer that spread to his lungs, 16 and that when he went down to the university of 17 miami for experimental chemotherapy, they used 18 drugs that were usually used for colon cancer, 19 as if to suggest that he had colon cancer. 20 so there is inconsistent shifting 21 justification. but he did not have lung cancer 22 or he had colon cancer that all the doctors 23 missed, despite all the colonoscopies and the 24 doctor's record that said he was cured. and 25 another doctor that testified here that said he 1 was cured of colon cancer more than ten years 2 out. 3 and then they said the chemotherapy was 4 for colon cancer, even though dr. davis said it 5 was not. he worked with dr. sridhar on the 6 complicated cases of the non-operative tumors, 7 those nasty adenocarcinomas get deep into the 8 lungs from filter cancer. from sucking harder 9 and deeper to get that all-needed nicotine into 10 the lungs to hit the brain. 11 if he had lung cancer, it was from 12 radiation. that was another defense. it is all 13 his responsibility anyway. and, again, as 14 his honor said, you decide who bears a relevant 15 proportion of fault. 16 we are willing to take our fair share of 17 the blame. we ask you to assign to them the 18 fair share of the blame they are not willing to 19 take. that is not unreasonable. that is the job 20 you can perform when you look at what is been 21 done in this case. 22 then it is all his responsibility anyway. 23 he should have known better. he never should 24 have trusted us. 25 why did not they know, if everybody knew 1 in the '60s, in the '70s, in the '80s, if 2 everybody knew, why did not the tobacco 3 executives in new york city and winston-salem 4 and raleigh-durham, why did not they know that 5 this was the problem, and why did not they come 6 out and embrace the findings instead of reject 7 the findings and embrace what -- the harms 8 were? 9 they said: we are going to get that 10 doubt controversy to reassure people. we are 11 going to lie. 12 and the engle findings that are so 13 important say the cigarette is a dangerous and 14 defective product. it is defective. this is 15 defective because it is unreasonably dangerous. 16 when used for the purpose for which it is 17 intended, it kills fifty percent of the people 18 that use it. 19 no other consumer product on earth meets 20 that bill. it is an institutionalized form of 21 irrational madness in our society that such a 22 deadly product exists. 23 if some red bull drink sends a teenager 24 to the er, it gets banned and there is 25 congressional hearings. 1 but when you have a tobacco epidemic like 2 we do, it is hard to get past it. 3 here is the position. he was not 4 addicted, but they did not call a witness to say 5 he was not addicted. they could have had an 6 addiction psychiatrist, a neurologist, a 7 doctor, anybody they wanted. they have no 8 limit, they have the ability to bring in 9 experts. they have no witness. 10 i was accused a little bit of i'm making 11 a lawyer argument. i was talking about 12 uranium-238. well, it is only lawyer argument 13 here that dispels the notion that my man was 14 addicted and depended on nicotine. 15 there is no scientific evidence. the 16 uniform proof from lay people and doctors is he 17 was addicted. 18 he did not have lung cancer? all the 19 doctors said he had lung cancer. and they all 20 said it was from smoking, and nobody said it 21 was not from smoking, and their one expert said 22 it was a substantial contributing cause of 23 smoking. 24 mr. lombardi says i cannot meet my 25 standard of proof because maybe there was some 1 radiation. i showed you my cool concurring 2 cause pictogram to show you that in order to be 3 a legal cause of disease, smoking need not be 4 the only cause. it can act in combination with 5 a nuke. so nuke 'em. nuke 'em. but it 6 does not stop him from having been -- caused to 7 have lung cancer. 8 the clerk: ten minutes left. 9 mr. schlesinger: thank you. 10 if he had lung cancer from radiation. 11 she did not say that. she said it is a risk 12 factor. 13 can you say it was a contributing cause? 14 she did not say that. she specifically 15 could not say it, did not testify to it. 16 the only thing she testified that meets 17 the legal evidentiary burden under the law -- 18 the instruction the court will give you is that 19 their own expert admitted a contributing cause 20 of mr. skolnick's lung cancer was smoking. 21 so it is uniform. 22 the business about it is all his 23 responsibility anyway. they said they accepted 24 smoker's health as the paramount responsibility 25 and promised to stop making it if it was ever 1 proven to be harmful. 2 that was a dodge. that was to give 3 people reassurance. they have not stopped 4 making it. they have not slowed down making it. 5 they have not made a safer cigarette. if you 6 take the nicotine out, there will not be any 7 smoking. 8 he should have known better? they spend 9 billions of dollars. dr. proctor testified 10 about the beautiful health reassurance 11 strategy. he talked about that. 12 and he never should have trusted us. and 13 one of the things i really -- hey, you messed 14 up. you trusted us. it is on you. 15 he was the perfect customer. they put 16 up -- they put up to convince you that our 17 client does not deserve to be one of the 18 people -- and it is not just him, but all the 19 others that were hurt. you will look -- 20 mr. belasic: objection, your honor. 21 mr. schlesinger: you will look at the 22 instruction. 23 the court: counsel, just talk about this 24 case. 25 mr. schlesinger: you will look at the 1 instruction on the reckless disregard and the 2 degree of reprehensible conduct that gives 3 punitive damages, and it says to the smoker and 4 others. one of the millions. 5 it says it is -- you are looking at 6 wrongful conduct, not just about mr. skolnick. 7 ultimately, punitive damages will be about 8 mr. skolnick. 9 but if you decide that they need a day of 10 reckoning, they should be penalized, they 11 should be fined. they should be punished. 12 because when you speak to them -- you are going 13 to speak to them in the only language they 14 understand. money. that is their lifeblood. 15 that is all they understand. 16 so when you see that -- i cannot believe 17 they put up a statistic, and i admire 18 mr. belasic for doing it, because you know, he 19 takes some risks and you see how they work, and 20 i admire that he did it. 21 but it was amazing to me. he put up a 22 standard, we did a lot of polls, public opinion 23 polls, only 2 percent of people trusted the 24 tobacco companies. 25 that is a defense in the case. you 1 should not have trusted us because people did not 2 trust us. 3 we were not worthy of being trusted, and 4 therefore, that is the defense in the case. 5 next slide. 6 we already did the doctor, right? 7 (the video clip was played and taken down 8 to the best of the reporter's ability as 9 follows:) 10 voice: it really poses the question of 11 whether one is responsible for the other. and 12 to this question it must be answered insofar as 13 the correlation between lung cancer and 14 cigarette smoking are concerned. no one knows. 15 it may, it may not. 16 how can cigarette smoking be the cause of 17 lung cancer if the cause of lung cancer is, as 18 yet, unknown? 19 voice: it is not known whether 20 cigarettes cause cancer, it has not been 21 causally established. there have been studies 22 conducted over ten years. and i would say 23 again -- 24 mr. lombardi: your honor, this is a 25 repeat. 1 the court: overruled. 2 voice: -- that science is still puzzled 3 over these forces. 4 voice: i certainly would not be in the 5 business if i thought cigarettes were harmful 6 to people. 7 voice: are you saying cigarettes are 8 harmless? 9 voice: i do not know that. i do not know 10 that they are harmful or harmless. what i'm 11 saying is someone should find out. 12 voice: i think if the company as a whole 13 believed that cigarettes were really harmful, 14 we would not be in the business. we are a very 15 moralistic company. 16 i think there is a great deal of doubt as 17 to whether or not cigarettes are harmful. you 18 will discover there is a great deal of doubt 19 with regard to whether or not smoking causes 20 all these diseases which are alleged to be 21 caused by smoking. 22 voice: but i do not think there is a 23 causal relationship established between 24 cigarette smoking and any disease. if there 25 were, diane, i do not think there would be a 1 cause or the effect without a cause, and we all 2 know that happens. 3 voice: we do not know what causes cancer 4 in general right now, so i think that we may 5 find out what causes cancer, and we may find 6 out some relationship which has yet to be 7 proven. 8 (video clip concluded.) 9 mr. schlesinger: now put up the -- this 10 is one of the internal documents. 11 the top men in these corporations, the 12 ceos, the top attorneys, the top scientists 13 were involved in all of these documents, 14 millions of them. 15 who ain't for more money? 16 i would be more cautious in using the 17 pharmic-medical model -- do we really want to 18 tout cigarette smoke as a drug? it is, of 19 course, but there are dangerous fda 20 implications to having such conceptualizations 21 go beyond these walls. 22 the pt47368, please. 23 addiction goes in a lot of different 24 ways, and tobacco companies are addicted to 25 money. that is the dependence they have, on 1 money. but there are considerations that must 2 be balanced with obligation to do the right 3 thing by your customers, by the public, to the 4 public, to the human health. 5 and that has to be taken into 6 consideration. here is -- 7 (the video clip was played and taken down 8 to the best of the reporter's ability as 9 follows:) 10 voice: something wonderful happens. 11 when you change to philip morris, you will 12 feel better. 13 voice: did you say i'll feel better 14 smoking philip morris? 15 voice: yes, you will feel better, and here 16 are the reasons why. in case after case, 17 coughs due to smoking disappear. 18 parched throat clears up. that stale 19 smoked out feeling vanishes. 20 voice: that is wonderful. 21 voice: when you change to philip morris, 22 you really taste your cigarette once again. 23 the clear, clean taste of fine mellow tobacco, 24 and your food will taste better too. 25 voice: but why do these wonderful things 1 happen when i change to philip morris? 2 voice: because you will be smoking the one 3 cigarette with a difference in manufacture, an 4 important difference that avoids a common cause 5 of cigarette irritation. 6 day after day, you will be smoking these 7 cigarettes recommended by eminent nose and 8 throat specialists ... 9 (video clip concluded.) 10 mr. schlesinger: something wonderful 11 happens when you smoke philip morris. you get 12 emphysema and buerger's disease and bladder 13 cancer and lung cancer and you die a gruesome 14 death, and illness. 15 the man that we represent grew up in a 16 time where now, voyager was such a romantic 17 thing. a man lighting a cigarette for a woman 18 was a beautiful thing. 19 he was addicted for 30 years or more 20 before anyone even began to put what they call 21 a warning, which was nothing more than the 1966 22 word: caution, cigarette smoking may be 23 hazardous to your health. 24 and when they pumped it up in the '70s, 25 to some things like it contains carbon 1 monoxide, low birth weight and emphysema and 2 cancer. those are the rotating warnings. 3 they did not even say the tobacco 4 companies say it. they said the surgeon 5 general says it. and i said that -- 6 (the video clip was played and taken down 7 to the best of the reporter's ability as 8 follows:) 9 voice: i would like you to rise, and 10 that will be testifying as well with you to 11 rise. raise your right hand. do you swear 12 that the testimony you are about to give is the 13 truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the 14 truth? 15 voices: i do. 16 voice: please consider yourself to be 17 under oath. 18 voice: let me begin my questioning on 19 the matter of whether or not nicotine is 20 addictive. let me ask you first, and i would 21 like to just go down the row, whether each of 22 you believes that nicotine is not addictive. 23 i heard virtually all of you touch on it. 24 just yes or no. do you believe nicotine is not 25 addictive? 1 voice: i believe nicotine is not 2 addictive, yes. 3 voice: mr. johnson? 4 voice: congressman, cigarettes and 5 nicotine clearly do not meet the classic 6 definitions of addiction. there is no 7 intoxication -- 8 voice: we will take that as a "no." 9 again, time is short. if you could 10 just -- i think each of you believe nicotine is 11 not addictive. we would like to have this for 12 the record. 13 voice: i do not believe that nicotine or 14 our products are addictive. 15 voice: i believe nicotine is not 16 addictive. 17 voice: i believe that nicotine is not 18 addictive. 19 voice: i believe that nicotine is not 20 addictive. 21 voice: and i, too, believe that nicotine 22 is not addictive. 23 (video clip concluded.) 24 mr. schlesinger: that is in april of 25 1994, a year after -- 1 (the video clip was played and taken down 2 to the best of the reporter's ability as 3 follows:) 4 voice: do you agree with the surgeon 5 general estimate of over 400,000 smokers die -- 6 voice: i do not agree. 7 voice: do you know how many die each 8 year? 9 voice: i do not know. 10 voice: okay. they agree that smoking 11 causes lung cancer. do you agree? 12 voice: it may. 13 voice: do you know whether it does? 14 voice: i do not. 15 voice: the medical experts agree that 16 smoking causes emphysema. do you agree? 17 voice: it may. 18 voice: they agree this smoking causes 19 bladder cancer, stroke, and low birth weight. 20 do you agree? 21 voice: it may. 22 voice: mr. campbell, you were also 23 deposed and you said, quote, "to my knowledge 24 it has not been proven that cigarette smoking 25 causes cancer." 1 this is a rather passive and puzzling 2 approach, especially in light of the consensus, 3 not by some, but all of the scientific 4 community. will you ever be convinced? and 5 what evidence are you waiting for? 6 let us have the microphone passed over. 7 voice: yes, i may be convinced. we 8 do not know what causes cancer in general right 9 now, so i think that we may find out what 10 causes cancer, and we may find out some 11 relationship, which has yet to be proven. 12 (video clip concluded.) 13 mr. schlesinger: character, they say is 14 how you behave when you think nobody is 15 looking. 16 the clerk: you have used all your time, 17 mr. schlesinger. 18 the court: wrap it up, please. 19 mr. schlesinger: yes. i've said and 20 i'll say this book to you again. america is 21 this industry's ashtray. they stub out 400 -- 22 mr. belasic: objection, your honor. 23 the court: sustained, counsel. 24 mr. schlesinger: last thing. 25 they tell you that it is a legal product. 1 and it is a common refrain. and it is a legal 2 product. but it is not legal to sell it to 3 children. it is not legal to sell it to 4 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, 14-year-olds, 5 15-year olds, 16-year-olds, and to hook them 6 when they are most vulnerable, to replace the 7 smokers that are dying off because of their 8 deadly product. 9 all we ask you to do is consider what 10 you have seen, deliver justice, and i wish you 11 good luck at accomplishing that task. and 12 thank you so much.
