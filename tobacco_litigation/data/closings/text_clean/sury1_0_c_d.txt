6 judge boyer, ms. shamp, ms. bryan, dr. sury, 7 members of the jury, good morning. 8 when we first met a few weeks ago over in the 9 other courthouse, we talked a little bit about jury 10 service, your role as jurors and how important that 11 is to our system. and one of the things that i 12 mentioned was how much i had enjoyed being on a jury 13 a few times back where i live and how much i hoped 14 that you would enjoy it, too. 15 and let me start by saying a couple things. 16 first, i hope you have enjoyed it. and, second, i'd 17 like to thank you and all of our group -- we work 18 very hard -- and i'd like to thank you for all of 19 your time, all of your attention and particularly 20 all of your patience. 21 this is the last time i get to talk to you. 22 ms. shamp gets to talk to you twice, once as she has 23 already done and then once after dave woods and i 24 get to talk to you now. 25 and the reason ms. shamp gets to talk to you 1 twice is really important to keep in mind. and it 2 does not mean that judge boyer likes her more than he 3 likes mr. woods and me. the reason ms. shamp gets 4 to talk twice is because the plaintiff, her client, 5 has the burden of proof. he has the burden of proof 6 on each and every issue that you are going to decide 7 in this case. and i ask that you keep that in mind. 8 that is why she gets to talk twice. 9 and the other thing that i think is significant 10 about the fact that ms. shamp gets to address you 11 twice, both first and last, is because she will get 12 the opportunity to respond to everything mr. woods 13 and i have to say to you. she gets the opportunity 14 to respond to everything mr. woods and i get to show 15 to you. and so i ask you to keep that in mind. she 16 gets the last word. 17 please focus on what she says in response to 18 what dave and i say and have shown to you. and in 19 particular, try to focus on what ms. shamp does not 20 say in response to what we have said to you, because 21 i'm thinking that on a whole lot of issues she is not 22 going to have much, if anything, to say. 23 let me talk about this case, the issues you are 24 going to have to decide. and first let us start with 25 the name of the case. the name is sury versus 1 r.j. reynolds tobacco company and lorillard tobacco 2 company. 3 this case involves bill sury. it involves 4 nobody else. it is not about dr. proctor's typical 5 smoker. it is not about dr. goldberg's generic 6 smoker. this is not a referendum on cigarettes. 7 it is not a referendum on the tobacco companies. 8 it is not a referendum on dr. frazier's view that 9 people should not have a choice to buy cigarettes. 10 they have that choice. 11 this case is about bill sury. and i start with 12 that point now the same way i started with my 13 opening statement. and what i suggested to you then 14 was that the plaintiffs were going to show you a 15 whole lot of things having nothing to do with bill 16 sury; they were going to show you hours and hours, 17 days and days of videotaped depositions of our 18 company employees having nothing to do with bill 19 sury; that they were going to bring you a number of 20 witnesses, burns, proctor, goldberg, all with 21 opinions having nothing to do with bill sury; and 22 that they would show you document after document 23 after document having nothing to do with bill sury. 24 and that is what is happened here. 25 i checked my calendar last night. we started 1 to present the proof to you, when you actually got 2 over here and we started to present the proof to 3 you, on november 3rd. we went almost two weeks -- 4 two weeks -- until november 16th, wednesday, 5 november 16th, before we heard anything from the 6 plaintiffs about bill sury, when they finally called 7 his son, robert sury, to testify about his father. 8 the plaintiff here did not bring you much other 9 information about bill sury. not one of his 10 friends, virtually nothing about his job, and 11 virtually nothing about his illness. and that is 12 telling, because all of that is really, really 13 important information in this case. 14 and because all that information is so 15 important in this case, we brought you all of the 16 information we could about bill sury and his smoking 17 and his illness and in particular what bill sury 18 knew about the risks of smoking. 19 what we know about bill sury is he grew up in 20 new jersey. he went to a high school, not a prep 21 school. he started in the mailroom at prudential 22 life insurance company. he went in the army in 23 1941, stationed mostly in hawaii, and he rose 24 through the ranks. important, he rose through the 25 ranks. he started as a technician third class. he 1 rose to become a first lieutenant in the united 2 states army. 3 he was highly decorated. he returned. during 4 the war he got married to kay, and back to the 5 prudential life insurance company after the war. 6 and once again bill sury rose again and again 7 through the ranks. he had one or two promotions in 8 new jersey, and he be- -- came into the accounting 9 department and then he got an appointment into the 10 underwriting department. 11 and then he chose to move down here to 12 jacksonville. and you heard it. he moved up and up 13 and up through the ranks. dr. sury said it. he 14 received a number of promotions within the 15 underwriting department. he advanced to the 16 position of underwriting consultant. 17 he was in the insurance profession. he was a 18 professional underwriter. he had a professional 19 job. he did not have a low-level job. how could 20 he, with all those promotions? he was on a 21 first-name basis with the company president, john 22 buchanan. 23 now, we talked about underwriting, and the 24 reason for that is pretty clear. because of all the 25 businesses in this economy, it is the life insurance 1 companies who are going to have the best grasp on 2 life expectancies. 3 and why is that? well, you heard it from 4 dr. riddel. the longer somebody lives, the less 5 they are going to have to pay out. the shorter 6 somebody lives, the more they are going to have to 7 pay out. it is their business to know about the 8 risks of smoking and how long people are going to 9 live. 10 and to demonstrate this rather basic fact, we 11 showed you that just as the first news of this 12 health hazard was breaking, we saw the insurance 13 companies starting to analyze the additional risks 14 of smoking. they were one of the first, of course. 15 it was their business to know that. 16 and by the '50s we saw in the press, including 17 newsweek, which bill sury read -- he certainly knew 18 about this in his business, but just to show you 19 that he actually -- there was actually something in 20 newsweek, we showed that to you, too, in 1954, 21 reporting on the plans of the life insurance 22 companies to start charging higher rates for 23 smokers. 24 and the companies only got to that point 25 because they had been researching this issue for a 1 lot longer before that, long before bill sury 2 brought his son robert down to his office and showed 3 him how he would calculate the lower rates he could 4 charge for non-smokers. 5 now, that is a big problem for the plaintiffs in 6 this case. and they tried to diminish dr. sury's 7 knowledge of the risks by showing you this chart 8 here. 9 insurance. underwriter, not actuary. well, 10 first of all, we did not suggest he was an actuary. 11 an actuary is a person who actually prepares the 12 rates. we told you bill sury was an underwriter, 13 and we told you that when i made my opening 14 statement and when mr. woods made his opening 15 statement. it was dr. goldberg who thought he was 16 an actuary. but it really does not matter whether 17 actuary or underwriter; they know the risks. 18 and then she also shows you here that -- in the 19 bullpen. i think she means bullpen, not an 20 executive. you know, a lot of executives work in 21 the bullpen. yes, he was in the bullpen. he was an 22 executive. he rose and rose and rose through the 23 ranks. i'm not quite sure why they use the bullpen. 24 maybe to diminish his knowledge. i do not know. but 25 the fact of the matter is he calculated the rates. 1 he calculated the rates. 2 and then they said prudential did not have 3 differential rates until somewhere -- they did not 4 have differential rates. so what? did not have 5 differential rates. does not matter. it was a 6 debate within the industry. and they are not saying 7 they do not have differential rates now. they are 8 saying at some point, according to dr. sury's 9 testimony, they did not have differential -- i'm not 10 quite sure what that means, the significance of 11 that, not having differential rates, because he told 12 you his dad knew of the -- well, he did not say that, 13 but he told you that his dad would look to see if 14 somebody was a smoker. he looked at that. and he 15 used that factor in calculating the rates that the 16 person applying for insurance would get. 17 and ms. shamp just sat down, and before that 18 she used the fact that we were bringing you innuendo 19 to suggest there were differential rates. we 20 were not bringing you innuendo. brought dr. sury to 21 say that they charge less for non-smokers. 22 and remember dr. goldberg? we showed you the 23 1954 document describing the newsweek article 24 reporting on the fact that the life insurance 25 companies were considering charging lower rates for 1 non-smokers. that was not innuendo. it was the 2 testimony of dr. goldberg and the testimony of -- 3 excuse me -- dr. goldberg and dr. sury. 4 if you are in the life insurance industry, you 5 have a particular knowledge of the risks of smoking. 6 the facts of this case show that bill sury knew the 7 risks of smoking for a very long time. 8 he knew it in two ways. number one, all the 9 things we showed you, back to christopher columbus, 10 evils of smoking, john quincy adams, addictive 11 nature of tobacco, the fact that cigarettes were 12 banned in 14 states in the 1900s, including florida, 13 to the days of world war ii, when cigarettes were 14 referred to as coffin nails. 15 we saw that in the film, frank sinatra film, 16 from here to eternity, set in pearl harbor, 17 ironically set in pearl harbor, where bill sury 18 served. before the pearl harbor bombing frank 19 sinatra is calling them coffin nails, nails, just as 20 bill sury was having his first cigarette. 21 bill sury knew that cigarettes were bad for 22 him. you heard hal rush. everybody knew. it was 23 just common knowledge. bill sury knew even more 24 about the risks of smoking than the average 25 american. second way, of course, his job. even 1 dr. goldberg agreed with that. 2 dr. goldberg admitted that compared to his 3 generic smoker, bill sury would be more sensitive to 4 the risks of smoking because of his job, and because 5 of his job the risks of smoking would be more 6 salient and more vivid to him. 7 but at this point let me take just a little 8 time out and reflect a little bit on what is going on 9 here and what the case is all about. and let me 10 start with a reality check. 11 why is it that we spend so much time on this 12 issue of everybody knew? why have we taken so much 13 time to prove what appears to be the obvious, the 14 obvious fact that everybody's known for a long time 15 about the risks? you know, why do we go on and on 16 about this, maybe even boring you with all the 17 information we brought to you on the awareness of 18 the risks? 19 it is because the plaintiffs in this case have 20 come into court trying to avoid this fact, trying to 21 avoid the fact that people have known for a long 22 time that cigarettes were bad for you, trying to 23 deny that bill sury knew the risks. 24 you heard ms. shamp in her opening statement. 25 she did not say it today, but i think she said it -- 1 i know she said it in opening statement, that in the 2 1940s and 1950s it was a different era, she said, 3 and it was the time when frank sinatra was singing. 4 remember that? the time, she said, that nobody knew 5 that cigarette smoking was dangerous. 6 just not so. the same frank sinatra who she 7 said was singing is also at the same time calling 8 them nails. 9 the plaintiff here denies that bill sury knew 10 that cigarettes were bad for him back when he 11 started smoking, 1941, and that he remained unaware 12 of the risks or confused until he heard in 1964, 13 supposedly was shocked. and we will talk about that. 14 heard in 1964 from the surgeon general that 15 cigarettes were harmful; he was shocked. we will talk 16 about that. 17 you know, do you really believe that bill sury 18 and everybody else did not know that cigarettes were 19 bad for them before the surgeon general's report? 20 do you really believe the testimony of the son, 21 dr. sury, the two of them were sitting in their 22 chairs in front of the family tv, dr. sury being 23 seven years old, by the way, but old enough to 24 remember his dad was shocked. and, you know, 25 shocked at what news? he was not shocked. no one 1 was shocked. 2 the next day we showed you a lot of newspaper 3 reports, lots of newspaper reports, on the reaction 4 to the surgeon general's report. and they said that 5 the surgeon general was not really telling people 6 anything they did not know. 7 and just to make that clear, can we have 8 demonstrative 2, please? 9 1964. this was when the surgeon general's 10 report came out. bill sury was supposedly shocked. 11 the journal of the american medical association 12 said, "the health hazards have been well publicized 13 for more than ten years and are common knowledge." 14 let me focus on that word, "common knowledge." 15 you heard hal rush come here into court yesterday, 16 and i asked him, you know, "how old are you" when he 17 started smoking -- or -- yeah, he was a little kid, 18 well before bill sury started to smoke. and i asked 19 him, "hal, when you were growing up, did you know 20 that cigarettes were harmful, bad for you?" 21 he said, "yes." 22 and i said, "well, how do you know?" 23 he said, "well, it was just common knowledge." 24 and if you asked a historian how they would 25 define "common knowledge," what they would say is 1 that common knowledge is something that you know but 2 you do not even know where you heard it from. it is 3 just common; in the woodwork, i guess. 4 and we have spent so much time putting these 5 graphics up on the board about all of the reader's 6 digest articles going back to the '20s and all of 7 the statements of the -- in the papers and john 8 quincy adams, christopher -- all of that. and why 9 do we do that? it is because those are graphic 10 reminders, something that was really happening, and 11 we could put it up on a slide and show it to you to 12 try to prove that. but the real thing is that it 13 was just common knowledge. everybody knew. 14 and now with that, let me turn to the specific 15 questions you will be asked to answer in this case. 16 and the first is a question -- let me show you 17 the verdict form which you will take back and which 18 ms. shamp showed to you. 19 and it has a lot of questions on it. it has a 20 progression of questions on it, and it starts with 21 the first. and the first question is -- the 22 question: "was william sury addicted to cigarettes 23 causing [sic] nicotine, and if so, was cigarette 24 smoking because of such addiction a legal cause of 25 his lung cancer?" 1 and i'm going to get to that in just a minute, 2 but this is the first question. and it is a 3 progression. if you answer "yes" to the first 4 question, you will go on to the others, or to some 5 of the others, and then you will go on if you answer 6 "yes" to them too. if you answer "no," which we 7 think you should, we will be done. the case will be 8 over. we all go home. 9 and so this first question, "was william sury 10 addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine, and, if 11 so, was cigarette smoking because of such addiction 12 a legal cause of his lung cancer?" that is the 13 question. it is one big question. but it has three 14 facets, each of which you should consider. and on 15 each of these facets the plaintiffs have the burden 16 of proof. 17 so the first facet is, "was bill sury addicted 18 to cigarettes containing nicotine," or in laymen's 19 language, "was bill sury a nicotine addict?" 20 you have heard the evidence on this question. 21 dr. frazier, for the plaintiff, says yes, he was; he 22 was addicted. dr. giakas says no. 23 well, how do they differ? they both used that 24 same diagnostic test, the dsm-iv, but they disagreed 25 for two different reasons. i'm going to go through 1 them right now. 2 first reason is dr. frazier marches through 3 each of the elements listed for consideration, and 4 she checked them off. she checked them off one at a 5 time, and ms. shamp did today, check, check, check, 6 double-check, and says, "hey, he was addicted." 7 dr. giakas, though, pointed out something 8 different and something that ms. -- dr. frazier did 9 not mention. before you get to those, you have got to 10 look at the first issue, which is whether there is 11 an overall loss of control. remember that? we 12 talked a lot about that with dr. giakas. did bill 13 sury have an overall loss of control? that is what 14 they must show to you. 15 and that is why ms. shamp got up and said right 16 in the beginning -- and i wrote it down -- she says, 17 "nicotine controls the behavior." let us think about 18 that. nicotine controls the behavior. that is what 19 she says. that is what they have got to prove with 20 respect to bill sury. 21 and so the question, did bill sury ever suffer 22 this loss of control? there is no evidence that bill 23 sury suffered a loss of control. 24 and you also heard from dr. giakas that of the 25 millions of former smokers, fifty percent were 1 addicted, fifty percent not. so fifty percent of former 2 smokers, they can quit. and he told you about that, 3 and he told you that bill sury was not among the 4 fifty percent of smokers who was addicted. 5 now, ms. shamp put up a slide and it said that 6 dr. giakas did not know what he was talking about, 7 said that dr. giakas was not credentialed. not 8 credentialed. i'm not sure what that means. but 9 anyway, he is not credentialed. 10 dr. giakas has treated 500 to 600 addicted 11 smokers. how many did dr. frazier? she tried to 12 suggest that she had done it a lot. you may 13 remember mr. latham impeached her right away on 14 that. she tried to suggest to you it was a lot, 15 remember. 16 one of his first questions was, "have not you 17 said repeatedly in the past, dr. frazier, that you 18 have just treated a few, a few?" and she had to 19 admit she is just treated a few addicted smokers. 20 and then there was something else about the 21 1998 surgeon general's report he supposedly had not 22 read. well, he had read it. she just got confused. 23 he was shown the 2010 one, just came out. he said 24 he did not -- had not read that, and when he did read 25 it, he did not agree with certain things in there. 1 just because it is a surgeon general's report, 2 you do not have to agree with it. but the fact of 3 the matter is dr. giakas is highly credentialed to 4 give you the opinion that you heard today, and 5 that is why we brought him in here, in view of those 6 credentials. 7 now, the second reason dr. frazier and 8 dr. giakas disagree, even if there was a loss of 9 control, then you get to the next part and you go 10 through the tick marks that ms. shamp went through. 11 and dr. giakas says, "okay. even if you get to 12 that point, i do not think he met the necessary 13 criteria for a diagnosis of a nicotine addict." 14 and so here i want to spend just a little bit 15 of time on this important first question looking at 16 the evidence she relied upon. because, remember, an 17 expert can only have an opinion based upon the 18 evidence in the case. so let us look at what she 19 relied upon. 20 what did she rely upon? there were very, 21 very -- no medical records before 1994. no other 22 written records. 23 did she rely on any observations from anyone 24 who does not stand to gain? maybe a little bit, i 25 think. maybe a little bit from hal or yancey. i 1 cannot remember that. 2 but what she relied upon, virtually all of the 3 evidence that she relies on to say that bill sury 4 was addicted comes from dr. sury. and i suggest to 5 you what dr. sury told you about his dad's addiction 6 was either a little inflated or just maybe wrong. 7 and let us walk through it. 8 you heard about the quit attempts. water 9 filters was a big quit attempt. remember that, 10 water filters? water filter's not a quit attempt. 11 it is just a different way of smoking a cigarette. 12 he gave up cigarettes for lent. lent. you 13 know, somebody who gives up something for lent, it 14 means that they are going to start up when easter 15 comes around. that is not a serious quit attempt. 16 the other supposed quit attempts before the 17 1980s -- the 1990s, when he apparently went to the 18 patch, what about those quit attempts from 1955 all 19 the way up to 19- -- i do not think there were any. 20 no one else saw him trying to quit. 21 think of that. neither of his friends who 22 played golf with him for almost 20 years ever saw 23 one indication he was trying to quit. the only 24 person who said he was trying to quit is the 25 plaintiff, dr. sury. 1 and then we get to this statement about how 2 hard he was trying to quit. maybe he was not trying 3 to quit hard or he was finding it hard to quit in 4 1991 or so when the nicotine patch comes and 5 dr. sury says he used that. 6 well, that story dr. sury said was a little 7 hard to keep up with. remember, i went through the 8 depositions with him. in the first deposition 9 dr. sury says he never prescribed the patch for his 10 dad. the patch was only available in 1990 -- excuse 11 me -- over the counter later. in 1991 you had to 12 have a prescription. he said he never prescribed it 13 for him, never. he was quite sure of that fact. 14 and then a couple months ago, getting ready for 15 the trial here, testimony changed. and now he does 16 recall prescribing the patch. now he recalls 17 prescribing the patch, but no records. once again, 18 no records. now he thinks he had his nurse call it 19 in to a pharmacy, but cannot remember the name of the 20 pharmacy, so no records from the pharmacy to confirm 21 that. 22 and i'll add to a little lack of clarity here. 23 now dr. sury cannot remember if he prescribed the 24 patch ten times or if he prescribed the patch a 25 hundred times. no idea how many prescriptions. and 1 this was his father. 2 and then we had this issue that mr. woods 3 talked about him with when he cross-examined 4 mr. sury. and this is really significant, so i'm 5 going to spend a little time on it. 6 how did dr. frazier get to all those tick marks 7 that ms. shamp showed you? well, a lot of it was on 8 the fact that he had -- bill sury supposedly had 9 these withdrawal symptoms. 10 remember what she talked about? well, he was 11 irritable. he had anxiety. he was restless. 12 insomnia. anger. anger. 13 now, where did all those descriptors come from? 14 they came from one person, and that was bob -- 15 robert sury. they did not come from hal rush, they 16 did not come from yancey montgomery, who saw him 17 every week for 20 years, or even from his brother, 18 dan sury. 19 the -- these descriptors, these indicia of 20 withdrawal symptoms, came from dr. sury. you heard 21 it. they came from his internet research on the 22 descriptors getting ready before his deposition. 23 now, that, ladies and gentlemen, is pretty much 24 the sum and substance of dr. frazier's opinion. and 25 i do not think there is much substance there. 1 nevertheless, ms. shamp put up something on the 2 board in front of you that i want to focus on. she 3 said bill sury was hooked -- and her word, 4 "hooked" -- in the military. that was just not on 5 their argument, it was not just on misleading 6 argument, it was inaccurate argument. he may have 7 started smoking in the military, but he was not 8 addicted then or at any time. 9 remember something else she put up on the 10 board. "smoked 30 years heavily." or a pack a day. 11 i'm sorry. "pack a day smoker for 30 years." 12 when did the 30 years start? you saw it up on 13 the board. according to them, it supposedly started 14 in 1964. all those numbers ms. bryan put up on the 15 board started in 1964. there is no evidence in this 16 case he was hooked in the military, and there is no 17 evidence that he was hooked or addicted at any time. 18 so i'm done with the first facet on question 1. 19 was he addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine? 20 the answer is no. 21 now let us get to the second facet. see that 22 word up there? "was cigarette smoking because of 23 such addiction a legal cause of his lung cancer?" 24 that goes to the issue was it a legal cause. 25 in other words, assuming bill sury was 4563 1 addicted, was addiction a legal cause? in other 2 words, did he smoke because of the addiction, his 3 supposed addiction to nicotine, or rather just 4 because he wanted to smoke cigarettes, enjoyed 5 cigarette smoking and wanted to make his own 6 decision? 7 and this question addresses bill sury's 8 willpower, his determination, and that is why we 9 spent so much time on that issue with you. 10 could he have wanted to quit if he -- could he 11 have quit if he wanted to quit? let us look at 12 whether he really did want to quit. 13 big question. did he want to quit? who says 14 he wanted to quit? again, only dr. sury. only 15 dr. sury. he says he did not seem to enjoy it, that 16 he just seemed to smoke automatically, whatever that 17 means. 18 he gave no one else the sense that he smoked 19 automatically. and his friends, smokers themselves, 20 did not say that. according to them, yancey, he 21 appeared to enjoy it. 22 his friends saw no evidence he wanted to quit. 23 both hal and yancey were smokers. yancey said he 24 smoked like a train. both of them quit. both of 25 them told bill sury that they had quit and how they 1 had quit, and that they encouraged him to quit. but 2 no -- none of them recall any indication from bill 3 sury that he wanted to quit. 4 now, i thought about this, and i thought, well, 5 maybe it is because his son said he was a private 6 person. maybe -- maybe he just did not tell people. 7 let us think about that. he plays golf with 8 these guys all the time. after they quit, 9 encouraging him to quit, and he would never once 10 say, "you know, i might try that. i might try 11 quitting. i do not like smoking. i might try 12 quitting"? not once. think of that. 20 years, and 13 not once an indication that he was thinking of 14 quitting or, by the way, even cutting back. 15 then secondly on this second facet -- it gets 16 more complicated -- even if he was addicted, could 17 he have quit if he wanted to quit? of course he 18 could have quit if he had wanted to quit. he did not 19 want to quit. 20 and if he had wanted to quit, he could have 21 quit. you have heard every expert come into this 22 court, dr. burns, dr. proctor, dr. giakas, even 23 dr. frazier. you heard it from the surgeon general, 24 the public health authorities. if you want to quit, 25 you can quit. 60 million people have quit. there 1 are more former smokers today than there are current 2 smokers. 3 and bill sury was one of the ones who could 4 have quit if he had wanted to quit. he was 5 successful in everything he set his mind to, in the 6 army, in his marriage, in his family, in his 7 business, and on the golf course. even his son 8 acknowledged that he had been able to accomplish 9 everything he set his mind to, except maybe not 10 going to college. 11 he was focused. bill sury was determined. if 12 he wanted to quit smoking, he could have quit 13 smoking. and when he wanted to quit smoking, he did 14 quit smoking. 15 he wanted to quit -- he did quit smoking -- 16 first time he wanted to quit, he got a cough. it 17 started to affect his health. a cough. and that 18 was all the motivation bill sury needed to quit. 19 this demonstrates pretty clearly that when bill 20 sury was motivated, he was able to quit, despite any 21 addiction. addiction was not the legal cause of 22 bill sury's illness. he could have quit. 23 and because of that, those two things, he 24 did not want to quit, and if he had wanted to, he 25 could have. they cannot satisfy the second prong -- 1 excuse me, the second facet, i should call it, 2 because i called it a facet before. 3 now, to the third, the last facet, and that has 4 to do with being the legal cause of his lung cancer. 5 that gets into all the medical proof, all the 6 medical proof. what caused his illness? 7 now, that is really not my area. mr. latham 8 talked a lot about that, and mr. woods will talk a 9 lot about that, and how the plaintiff did not carry 10 his burden on this issue. 11 and, as mr. woods will tell you, we simply do 12 not have enough information to determine whether 13 smoking was the cause of his illness. and the 14 reason for that is we do not have the records. 15 they are gone. records are gone. records are 16 discarded. tests were not done. 17 and that is why we stress that point a lot. a 18 lot. and the judge gave you an instruction on that 19 point. and i want to make it clear on this thing. 20 we are not saying that dr. sury destroyed documents. 21 we are not tak- -- blaming him for the fact that the 22 documents are not there from dr. grochmal or 23 dr. marks or dr. gaddis. we are not blaming him. 24 the reason we are making a point of this is to 25 focus on the fact that because the records are gone 1 and the tests were not done prevents dr. sury from 2 carrying his burden of proof on this third facet of 3 question 1, that the cancer was caused by smoking. 4 so let me come back now that i've gone through 5 all the facets of the first question. 6 was bill sury addicted -- william sury addicted 7 to cigarettes containing nicotine, and, if so, was 8 cigarette smoking because of such addiction a legal 9 cause? one question, three facets. got to prove 10 it, all three. he did not prove any of them. did not 11 prove he was addicted, did not prove he could not 12 quit, and they did not prove that his death was 13 caused by smoking. the answer should be "no." 14 and if you answer is "no" on that, and i 15 suggest it should be, then we are done. but if you 16 do not agree with me, you agree with ms. shamp on 17 that, and if you answer "yes" to question 1, then we 18 go on. then we get to questions 2 through 5. 19 those are the engle finding ones, as ms. shamp 20 told you about, findings that the industry was 21 fraudulent, concealed, negligent. only if you get 22 to -- past question 1 do those findings come into 23 play, and now they come into play because we are 24 there and talking about if you answered "yes" to 25 question 1. 1 but as to each one, as the judge instructed 2 you, you are going to have to make the decision as 3 to whether these factors, those engle finding 4 factors, were the legal cause of bill sury's death. 5 and this issue, whether these things caused bill 6 sury's death, depends on whether it was the conduct 7 of the tobacco companies that caused him to smoke, 8 the things we said and things we did not say, or 9 whether, as we have suggested, that bill sury would 10 have started smoking and would have continued 11 smoking because he wanted to start to smoke and he 12 wanted to continue to smoke, regardless of anything 13 we did or said or did not say or did not do. 14 and as we have shown you and proved to you, i 15 hope, it is been known for decades, it is common 16 knowledge, that cigarettes were harmful. it has 17 been understood and embraced that they are harmful 18 and dangerous even before the first studies started 19 to appear. 20 i'll go back to this data point again. i 21 started to show you that. reader's digest article, 22 1924. way back when, they knew. demonstrative 4. 23 look at all those articles starting back in 24 1924. that is what leads to the common knowledge, 25 '24. cigarette smoking was dangerous. 1 dr. riddel came here last week to show you the 2 public opinion polls from way back when, very early 3 on, well before bill sury supposedly was hooked. by 4 july of 1954 -- can we have demonstrative 5? let us 5 look at this gallup poll -- ninety percent of people 6 knew or had heard that lung cancer was related to 7 cigarette smoking. as dr. riddel stated, the 8 awareness was overwhelming. 9 now, i want to get to something that we just 10 heard about in ms. shamp's closing argument, the 11 roper polls. remember, she put up the roper poll. 12 and remember, when i opened on this case, we 13 talked -- i talked about right up front the fact 14 that they would give you maybe half the truth but 15 not the whole truth and that they would pull things 16 out of context and would not give you the whole 17 context. and we saw that when she relied on the 18 roper poll. so when she said that, i went and got 19 the roper poll that she was referring to. 20 here's what she did not tell you. here's what 21 else the roper poll says. and you will have this back 22 in the jury room. do not take my word for it. 23 you will see it in the jury room. it is plaintiff's 24 exhibit 289. 289. 25 page 6, over three-quarters of the respondents 1 think it is at least possibly true that cigarette 2 smoking is dangerous, with half thinking definitely 3 or probably true. this is way back when. 4 almost half think that smoking is definitely or 5 probably a cause of illness. 6 on specific diseases, the public, by a fairly 7 large margin, thinks that heart trouble -- not just 8 cancer -- heart trouble, high blood pressure, 9 emphysema are more common among smokers than 10 non-smokers. 11 goes on. gets better. anti-smoking 12 advertisements and publicity have received 13 widespread attention. 14 gets better. anti-smoking publicity appears to 15 be having some real effects on the smoking public. 16 this, by the way, too, a document from our 17 files. 18 page 17, almost half of the respondents think 19 it is definitely or probably true that cigarettes 20 are a cause of smokers having more illnesses. 21 and then page 23. here's the results of the 22 poll. how many people total out of the general 23 public said smoking is not hazardous? please look at 24 this, page 23 of exhibit 289. 6 percent for the 25 roper poll she talked about. 1 and how many said it was either hazardous -- 2 oh, excuse me -- heavy smoking is hazardous, 3 47 percent. smoking any amount is hazardous, 4 42 percent. 5 percent did not know. 5 what does that amount up to? it amounts up to 6 89 percent, almost exactly what george gallup found, 7 which was ninety percent. 8 and the roper polls go on. because, remember, 9 she talked about the campaign of information, the 10 lies, how she went to school and said a four-letter 11 word and really got in trouble, people believed what 12 we were saying. well, there is another roper poll. 13 she showed you the front page of this. she 14 did not show you what it said. and this is 15 plaintiff's exhibit 217. 16 and if you go to page 31, roper asked, "hey, if 17 anybody denies and says there is no connection 18 between lung cancer and cigarette smoking, which are 19 you least likely to believe?" 20 least likely to believe by a factor of ten was 21 the tobacco industry research council. how many 22 people would believe the tobacco industry? in here 23 they said that, 3 percent. and she wants you to 24 believe that bill sury is in the 3 percent. 25 and one of the other things dr. riddel said was 1 that people do not only know it is dangerous; they 2 think it is more dangerous than it really is. and 3 she went through those polls, too, those studies, 4 one by viscusi, a guy who had been retained by 5 the -- or funded at least by the tobacco companies, 6 and one by slovic on the other side, plaintiff's 7 expert. found the same thing. people think it is 8 twice as harmful as it really is. the fact of the 9 matter is people know it is a risky behavior. 10 and the recent studies show that people will 11 choose to smoke regardless of the amount of 12 information that they receive. information or lack 13 of information or disinformation has been proven 14 time and time again in real studies and real big 15 studies not to matter. 16 dr. riddel talked to you about the commit 17 studies -- do you remember that? -- where they 18 tested whether more information about smoking and 19 better information, more salient information, would 20 make any difference in whether people quit. answer? 21 no. 22 think about that. the studies show that 23 information on smoking does not matter. information 24 matters sometimes if people do not know. but if they 25 do know, information is not going to matter. 1 and we talked about -- she talked about that 2 hutchinson study, too, that huge thing called the 3 gold standard sponsored by the national cancer 4 institute, reported on in the national cancer 5 institute journal, 15-year study of the effect of 6 information and more information and more 7 information. and what did it show? did it matter? 8 the answer was no. no matter how much information 9 they get, they are going to start to smoke, they are 10 going to continue to smoke. 11 these studies are a shot to the heart of the 12 plaintiff's case, because the plaintiff's case 13 hinged their -- the plaintiffs hinged their claim 14 upon the fact that information put out there by the 15 tobacco companies caused people to start to smoke 16 and continue to smoke. the fact of the matter is 17 that studies show time and time again it makes no 18 difference. does not matter. 19 and now let us focus on this for a minute. 20 dr. riddel spent some time talking about hutchinson. 21 she spent time talking about commit. and then we 22 get a chance -- ms. shamp had a chance to 23 cross-examine on those studies to see if she could 24 pull the shot to the heart out of the heart. 25 nothing. she asked nothing. ms. shamp asked 1 nothing about either of those studies. she asked 2 nothing about them since they simply devastate this 3 suggestion, this allegation that we told him 4 something that he relied upon. there is no proof of 5 that. and in fact the proof is to the contrary. 6 nothing would have made a difference. so she just 7 ignored them. 8 instead, what the plaintiff tries to do is 9 convince you that bill sury smoked because of what 10 the tobacco industry did. and to do that, they 11 bring you nothing that has to do with studies. they 12 do not bring you studies. what they brought you was 13 opinions of dr. burns, dr. goldberg, dr. proctor. 14 opinions. they are opinions. no studies. we will get 15 to the studies in a minute, to the extent we already 16 have not. 17 bringing these opinions to try to suggest to 18 you that people were deceived and bill sury was 19 deceived, would have acted differently as a result. 20 and i want to get to the opinions of those witnesses 21 and to tell you my view of their opinions and to 22 point out the lack of studies that they relied upon, 23 the lack of hard evidence. but before i do that, i 24 want to spend just a couple minutes talking about 25 witness credibility. 1 you will have an instruction -- or you do have 2 an instruction on page 6 of your instructions. the 3 judge has instructed you -- and i encourage you to 4 look at that -- given you some little guideposts on 5 how you might as jurors evaluate the believability 6 and credibility of the witnesses who have come 7 before you. 8 and he is told you, and you have it in your 9 packet there, look at their -- you should take a 10 look at their demeanor, frankness, their knowledge 11 of facts, the reasonableness of their opinion, their 12 ability to remember whether -- what they have said, 13 to be consistent, and any interest of the witness in 14 the outcome of the case. 15 let us start with demeanor. an excellent way, i 16 have always thought, to judge in a court case the 17 credibility of the witness is to evaluate two 18 things. one, how do they act on direct examination 19 when the person paying them or their client is 20 testifying? and then see if that demeanor changes 21 in any way during cross-examination. are they 22 helpful and cooperative to their own side and then 23 difficult with the cross-examining witness [sic]? 24 because if so, why are they like that? 25 and the suggestion is if they are like that -- 1 my suggestion to you is if they are like that, they 2 have something to hide or that they do not like to 3 discuss. and that is what we saw. 4 with dr. proctor and dr. goldberg, i suggest to 5 you that on a number of times they tried to evade my 6 questions and mr. woods' questions. remember, they 7 would often try to rephrase the question and they 8 would give a nonresponsive answer or a non-response. 9 remember, i wanted to talk with dr. proctor 10 about cigarette filters and how the public health 11 community had for years and years and years 12 encouraged us to put filters on cigarettes so people 13 would die less. and i wanted to talk about the 14 public health community saying that people had died 15 less because of filters. 16 he did not want to talk about that. in 17 response to every question i asked, he focused on 18 compensation, which i will get to later, the concept 19 of you puff more. so maybe it is not as safe. he 20 did not want to talk about it. he did not want to let 21 me talk about it to inform you about the public 22 health community and what they were saying about 23 soft filters, put them on there. 24 dr. goldberg. i admit i like to talk about 25 studies. i like to talk about the advertising 1 studies. and i wanted to talk about them with 2 dr. goldberg so i could tell you about what they 3 really show. 4 but dr. goldberg did not want to talk about the 5 studies. he wanted to talk about the consensus 6 reports. i'd ask him a question. he would say, "no, 7 the consensus reports say something differently." 8 i'd ask him a question. he would say, "the consensus 9 reports say something differently." finally, 10 remember, i said, "dr. goldberg, please. we will get 11 to your consensus reports. could you just tell me 12 about this study?" 13 how many times did it take dr. goldberg to give 14 a definition, a simple definition, of the word 15 "generic"? he did not want to give it. "please tell 16 me generic." "please tell me generic." "please 17 tell me" -- "no, i'll give you an example. i will not 18 give you a definition." 19 it is a word he uses in every case, "generic," 20 and he will not define it? 21 contrast the evasiveness of those two witnesses 22 with the candor and forthrightness of dr. riddel, 23 dr. giakas and dr. stonesifer. if they did not know 24 something, they would tell you, "i do not know 25 something." they would answer the question. that is 1 demeanor. 2 let us talk about reasonableness. you know, 3 just because a witness comes in and says something 4 to you does not mean you have to accept it. of 5 course you do not. you are the finders of fact. 6 you are the finders of credibility. let us look at 7 the reasonableness. you get to judge the 8 reasonableness of these people's opinions. 9 filters. let us talk about filters and 10 dr. proctor. 11 we show dr. proctor and you all of the studies 12 by drs. doll, russell, jarvik, men who were titans 13 in this field. richard doll was knighted by the 14 queen of england for his work on filters. there is 15 not many people who get knighted. he did. 16 all of his work showing the benefits of filters 17 and published, as dr. proctor admitted, in the most 18 prestigious journals, peer-reviewed journals, in the 19 world that showed that filters, what we were doing 20 with filters and low tar was a good thing. 21 what did dr. proctor say about those? do you 22 remember? every one, he said they were flawed. 23 doll study, flawed. jarvik study, flawed. 24 was there one study, by the way, he brought in 25 that said these studies were flawed? no. he just 1 said they were flawed. is that reasonable? 2 dr. goldberg. let us check out the 3 reasonableness of his opinions. 4 he told you that cigarette advertising caused 5 bill sury to start to smoke. did not know bill sury, 6 but he said, "i know it caused bill sury to smoke. 7 everybody is affected, directly or indirectly, by 8 advertising. cigarette advertising caused bill sury 9 to start to smoke. i know." 10 okay, dr. goldberg. i asked him whether 11 advertising caused bill sury to buy a car. what did 12 he say? and i hope you remember it. i do. i wrote 13 it down. he did not know the answer to that 14 question. why? he did not know anything about bill 15 sury. 16 and what about dr. g's opinion on alcohol 17 advertising, beer advertising, wine advertising? 18 well, that is different. that sort of advertising 19 does not cause people to drink. but cigarette 20 advertising causes people to smoke. is that 21 reasonable? 22 let us look at the frankness, third thing you 23 should consider, frankness of the witness, or lack 24 of frankness. 25 the asterisk. remember -- this is a small 1 point, but remember the last little thing with 2 dr. proctor, the one about the asterisk? i showed 3 him, as i was trying to show him all during 4 cross-examination, about the benefit of filters. 5 and he did not like all these things the surgeon 6 general said about the benefits of filters because 7 it undercut his opinion that cigarette filters are 8 no good. 9 so then he saw this little asterisk pointing to 10 a footnote in the passage from the surgeon general's 11 report. he says, "aha, there is an asterisk. the 12 surgeon general is referring to the problem of 13 compensation." 14 so then after ms. bryan finished all her 15 questions, the judge, i believe, let me ask one 16 more, "just one more. i've got one more question." 17 the question was: "okay, dr. proctor. tell me 18 about the asterisk. anything there about 19 compensation?" 20 answer: "no." 21 dr. goldberg, on the issue of frankness. 22 project 16. do you remember project 16? i do. on 23 cross-examination i talked to dr. goldberg, and i 24 spent a lot of time on this because it is a very 25 important point, all the steps an advertiser will 1 take in designing an ad campaign for a target 2 market. i wanted to show that there were no 3 documents in reynolds' files that there would have 4 been if we were supposedly targeting youth like he 5 asserted. 6 so we went through focus groups. "oh, yeah, 7 there'd be documents about the target market to show 8 the age of the focus group." 9 okay. theme testing. "oh, yeah, there would 10 be documents in the files showing the age group of 11 the people who were theme tested," which you would 12 do in every advertising campaign, copy test the same 13 thing. 14 whether it is age group, ethnic group, 15 particularly gender, you will test that group. you 16 will bring them into a room. "what do you think of 17 these concepts? what do you think of these ads? 18 what do you think of these commercials?" and there 19 are records of who was in that target group. of 20 course there are. and he admitted that. it is a 21 critical point, because if we were targeting kids, 22 our files would have those things in the documents. 23 and so at the end of all that i asked 24 dr. goldberg to acknowledge that if we were 25 targeting youth, those documents would exist, and 1 that they did not exist. and then we have an "aha" 2 moment in the trial. remember that? dr. goldberg 3 says, "aha." his "aha" moment in the trial; 4 project 16. 5 "never heard of it. what is that?" 6 he says, "oh, that is the study on 7 16-year-olds." 8 and talk about how he makes things up. i hope 9 you remember that. at first he says, "you know, i 10 do not know if it was reynolds or not." that is a 11 quote. and then he said, "i believe it is reynolds," 12 another quote. and then he got so -- more certain 13 and he said, "it was reynolds." okay. we go from 14 "do not know" all the way to "i know." 15 okay. so then we had a break, and 16 mr. richardson, who is a whiz with the computer, 17 went to the web to find out about this document 16, 18 project 16. and we found it. had seen it and found 19 it (phonetic). 20 who had done project 16? it was not reynolds. 21 it was not any company even in the united states. it 22 was imperial tobacco, limited, of canada. 23 that made no never-mind to dr. goldberg. he 24 just made something else up. "okay. they are a 25 subsidiary. imperial is a subsidiary now of 1 reynolds." 2 and i said, "how do you know that?" 3 and he said, "i'm from canada." 4 dr. goldberg's penchant to embellish a little 5 bit should become apparent when i point this out. 6 you may not have noticed it when the judge 7 instructed you on this. and you will have it. 8 page 18. 9 the judge instructed you on who reynolds is. 10 it is an important point. reynolds has acquired some 11 companies over time. what it acquired is the 12 american tobacco company, and it acquired the 13 brown & williamson tobacco company. and he said 14 accordingly rjr tobacco is liable for american and 15 for brown & williamson. now so we are liable. but 16 those are the only two. you did not hear a word from 17 the judge about imperial. 18 another factor, witness credibility factor, is 19 the ability of the witness to remember the facts 20 he is already testified to, does he change his 21 testimony. 22 here again we see that with dr. goldberg. 23 remember that article that i mentioned earlier about 24 the higher rates for smokers in 1954? he saw this 25 memo. ms. shamp showed it to him, this memo. it 1 says, "hey, newsweek is talking about these higher 2 rates for smokers." and that is what he said in his 3 direct, higher rates for smokers. 4 then we get to cross. testimony changed. 5 remember that? then he said, "oh, yeah, it says 6 rate changes. i think that must have to do with 7 interest rate calculations or something." i do not 8 know what he said. but, in any event, he just 9 changed his testimony. he did not bat an eyelash. 10 and at the break i looked back and i thought, 11 "geez, i was sure he said that." he did say it. 12 and i showed it to him and i said, "geez, is not 13 this inconsistent?" did not matter to him. he 14 just -- "perhaps." that is what he said, "perhaps." 15 and how about the story about the conference 16 that he went to or did not go to, the learn how to be 17 a witness against the tobacco companies conference? 18 first he said he was in attendance. then he said he 19 did not go. 20 okay. he did not go. why? he had a conflict. 21 okay. what was the conflict? he had a class. 22 then mr. woods got up and said, "wait a minute. 23 you do not teach on saturday, do you?" 24 "no." 25 "well, this conference was held on saturday, 1 was not it?" 2 "oh." that did not matter to him, either. he 3 goes on. remember what he said then? "i must have 4 had football tickets." 5 i hope you looked when it was up on the board 6 to see when that conference was held. it was held 7 in april. penn state does not play football in 8 april. 9 knowledge of the facts. now, i talked to you 10 about the importance of studies, the importance of 11 hard evidence. we brought you studies and hard 12 evidence. the expert's knowledge of the facts is 13 something the judge has indicated that is important 14 for you to consider, or you should consider or you 15 can consider. and let us look at the knowledge of 16 the facts. 17 dr. proctor, historian on smoking and smoking 18 regulation, had not seen or been provided with 19 thousands of documents from the files of the federal 20 government now available, 24 government agencies 21 that produced those documents, available. 22 dr. goldberg had not looked at the seminal 23 studies on the effect of advertising upon smoking 24 and youth smoking. he had never heard of the 25 principal study cited by the surgeon general, 1 conrad, flay and hill. never even heard of it. an 2 important study, because conrad, flay and hill 3 showed that kids start smoking for a variety of 4 reasons, and not once do they mention advertising. 5 but, you know, that did not matter to him, by 6 the way. he said, "oh, i see that chart up on the 7 board" -- i do not know if we have it. we can take 8 that down. but it has all these studies, and you 9 can see it is in the 1994 surgeon general's report, 10 and it shows all the things that cause kids to start 11 smoking, and advertising is not there. 12 so, again, no never-mind to dr. goldberg. all 13 he says is, "well, they did not look at advertising." 14 and then i showed him conrad, flay and hill, 15 page 1722. yes, they have looked at advertising. 16 it was just not a predictor. 17 he had not looked at it. he made things up 18 about it. he does not know the studies. 19 he did not know about the seminal study by the 20 council of economic advisors on advertising and its 21 effect upon smoking rates. he never -- he had not 22 heard of it, and he did not even know who the 23 council of economic advisors was. 24 the fact of the matter is the plaintiffs kept 25 the experts away from a lot of facts that are really 1 important in this case, people's understanding of 2 smoking, their understanding of the risks, the fact 3 about the effects of advertising, the facts about 4 bill sury. plaintiffs did not want to disclose any 5 of that information to their plaintiffs -- to their 6 experts. 7 and one other point on this issue of disclosing 8 facts. it is a point that rankles me. it is a point 9 that maybe might rankle you. the point is 10 disclosure. the point is disclosure of bias and 11 conflict of interest. 12 remember the testimony of dr. riddel. during 13 cross-examination by ms. shamp, she pointed out to 14 dr. riddel that this viscusi study that dr. riddel 15 told you about had -- hey, it had been funded by my 16 law firm, made a big point of that, and she made a 17 big point of it during her closing argument today. 18 and we heard this other thing about paula 19 noble, who works for mr. woods' firm, that he had 20 given her or printed out certain things that 21 dr. riddel had relied upon, like it is a big deal. 22 there is no secret, by the way, about all of 23 that. it is been fully known for a long time that my 24 firm funded the viscusi work. 25 and how is it known? it is disclosed right in 1 viscusi's work. it is no secret. the fact of the 2 matter is the tobacco industry, when they are doing 3 this stuff, are defendants out there, are fully 4 disclosing exactly what the funding is. 5 and with respect to this issue of we gave them 6 certain things, we did not give them other things, 7 no. we gave dr. riddel -- and she testified to 8 it -- everything in her field of expertise, which is 9 risk perception. and they showed her marketing 10 documents, said, "aha, you did not look at these." 11 that is not in her area. we gave her everything in 12 her area. 13 and there is a big difference here, because the 14 plaintiffs have not. you saw up on the board there 15 when they go to this -- dr. g goes -- dr. goldberg 16 goes to these expert witness schools, anti-tobacco 17 schools. they had one thing up there called, you 18 know, like this, "case in a box" or "trial in a 19 box." 20 they go there, the plaintiffs' lawyers go to 21 these things, and somebody comes and says, "here's 22 how you do a trial. here's the witnesses you hire. 23 and, by the way, here are the documents to use." 24 they provide their experts with just the documents 25 that help them, even if they are outside of their 1 field of expertise. 2 and you heard the proof here. it was pretty 3 clear. how could dr. goldberg not have known about 4 conrad, flay and hill or the council of economic 5 advisors? 6 the tobacco industry has disclosed when we fund 7 things. you saw it again in the funding, i believe, 8 of the viscusi work, which was -- point at george 9 allen, head of the tobacco institute, fully 10 disclosed. the green monster thing that we talked 11 about, fully disclosed. 12 but what about the studies that the plaintiffs 13 rely upon? slovic. remember, they put up slovic. 14 not that it helps them. they put up slovic. 15 slovic, the plaintiff's expert, never discloses the 16 fact he is a plaintiff's expert. 17 surgeon general's reports we heard so much 18 about. nci monograph 19, the consensus report 19 dr. goldberg talked about. was there any 20 disclosure -- i tried to make that point -- any 21 disclosure in those reports that the editors, 22 reviewers, contributors, many of them received money 23 from the plaintiffs? there was no disclosure by 24 them of the fact that they are funding the work that 25 they actually then relied upon. no disclosure in 4590 1 any of those reports or from dr. goldberg or burns. 2 dr. goldberg and burns are frequent testifiers 3 against the industry. they are both -- burns is in 4 the million dollar club. goldberg's about there. 5 these witnesses are out there writing these 6 consensus reports damning the tobacco industry with 7 absolutely no disclosure that they were receiving 8 money to testify against the companies, a practice 9 that even dr. proctor called unethical. 10 and let us take just one deeper little look into 11 the circularity of reasoning we saw in the case. 12 can we start with a wine cooler on this one, 13 tammy? i mean the wine cooler article. 14 okay. let us follow this one. dr. goldberg in 15 1992 writes an article. he concludes that 16 advertising has no effect upon teenage smoking. 17 "research in assessing the link between cigarette 18 advertising and teenage smoking has generated 19 equally inconclusive results." 20 in 1992 he looks at the literature, two 21 articles. he says, "cigarette advertising has no 22 effect upon cigarette smoking." 23 and then he goes to plaintiffs' witness school. 24 and then dr. goldberg gets hired and he starts to 25 get hundreds of thousands of dollars to testify 1 against the industry. and then he gets to help 2 write these consensus reports. 3 who asked him to help write the consensus 4 reports? other people who are getting money to 5 testify against the industry. 6 and then dr. goldberg comes into court to say 7 and base his opinion upon the things that these guys 8 just wrote. and that is why i focus, ladies and 9 gentlemen, so much upon the studies. 10 and i'll get to that when i get to 11 dr. goldberg's opinion, because i'm going to have to 12 stop in just a minute and take a break because the 13 judge asked me to. 14 i could go on, your honor, but i think this is 15 a good time. 16 the court: okay. 17 mr. williams: no. one minute. i'm not done. 18 the court: okay. 19 mr. williams: goldberg comes into court 20 relying upon these studies done by people who 21 testify against the industry with no disclosure and 22 says they are consensus reports. 23 and that is why i focus on the studies. i want 24 you to and i'm going to direct you and show you -- 25 i'm sorry; i'm not going to direct you -- show you 1 how you can look at those studies and make your own 2 conclusion on these issues. because dr. goldberg 3 did not look at the studies and he just presented you 4 with these consensus reports. 5 and who is it a consensus of? it is a consensus 6 of people who are taking money to testify against 7 the industry with no disclosure of their bias. 8 final thing on the credibility of witnesses. 9 you can look at the thing -- the instruction the 10 judge gave you. do they have -- do these witnesses 11 who come before you have an interest in the outcome 12 of the case? 13 obviously dr. sury does here, but so did 14 dr. proctor and dr. goldberg and dr. burns. their 15 testifying represents a huge percentage of their 16 income, a million -- a million dollars almost for 17 two of them, over a million for another, a hundred 18 thousand dollars for proctor just sitting in that 19 chair there, and $75,000 for dr. goldberg, a lot of 20 money they are making to deliver their testimony in 21 a way that helps the plaintiff against the tobacco 22 industry, who these individuals also dislike. 23 i'm going to suggest to you, and then we are 24 going to stop in a minute, and then when i come back 25 i am going to go through their actual opinions. i'm 1 going to suggest to you that those opinions are 2 based upon their dislike of the tobacco companies 3 and not upon any studies or any accurate 4 information. these witnesses will say anything, 5 most anything, to hurt the tobacco industries even 6 if it is inaccurate. 7 now is a good time, your honor. [#deleted recess#] 13 mr. williams: thank you, your honor. 14 i spent a little time before lunch going 15 through the factors that the judge has suggested to 16 you, you might consider in weighing the credibility 17 and believability of the witnesses that is appeared 18 before you. 19 and i'm going to get to the opinions of those 20 witnesses now and to the testimony of those 21 witnesses now, but i wanted to ask you to hold one 22 thing in mind, i'm going to suggest to you that the 23 witnesses we brought to you, the expert witnesses 24 first, dr. giakas and dr. stonesifer, and 25 dr. riddel, i would suggest, they are honest 1 people. they were knowledgeable people. 2 they were candid with you when they told you 3 what they knew, and they would acknowledge when 4 they did not know something, and they did not 5 venture outside of their area of expertise. and 6 the fact witnesses that we brought to you, 7 ms. montgomery and hal rush were equally truthful 8 and candid, i believe, with you. but those were 9 our witnesses. 10 i will leave it to ms. shamp to discuss the 11 candor of her witnesses when she gets up again. 12 she did not say much, if anything, about her expert 13 witnesses. dr. goldberg, i did not hear her mention 14 of. and dr. proctor, maybe she will try to defend 15 their testimony when she returns to talk to you. 16 but my suggestion is that the credibility of 17 our witnesses were significant and the credibility 18 of their witnesses was not. and i mention that 19 because the credibility of the witnesses that we 20 bring in front of you speak volumes about the 21 overall credibility of the case that we bring in 22 front of you, and ms. shamp does as well. 23 let me run through the opinions of the expert 24 witnesses that they brought you. dr. proctor came 25 to you at the beginning of the case with four 1 opinions. 2 can we have that? 3 ms. shamp: what number? 4 mr. williams: those are the four opinions. 5 "by the 1950s, the tobacco industry knew that 6 cigarettes caused cancer, but choose not to tell 7 the public." we addressed that opinion head on. 8 we showed you through scientific study after 9 scientific study and we took you through those 10 studies to confront this allegation. 11 and i think perhaps the most telling thing 12 about that, and i try to tee this into what 13 ms. shamp wrote on the board the very first day, 14 you can see it over there, this issue of fraud by 15 concealment, talking about concealment of facts 16 that were not otherwise known. 17 and we spent some time with that. and after 18 some fencing with dr. proctor, i think he finally 19 admitted -- i know he finally admitted that he 20 could not point to one scientific fact that was 21 known to the tobacco companies and was unknown to 22 the outside world. there was no concealment of 23 facts that were not otherwise known. and he 24 conceded that so many of the facts that the outside 25 world knew had been told to them and published by 1 the tobacco industry. 2 and during our statement, we took you through 3 all the statements of the eminent scientists in 4 this area all tracking the state of the scientific 5 literature on smoking and health. 6 we took you year through year through year 7 from the early 1950s, when wynder first did his 8 mouse painting experiments, up through 1964, and we 9 showed you that until the early 1960s at the 10 release of that report by the british royal college 11 of physicians and then the surgeon general's 12 report, that there was an open, back then, an open 13 and very, very candid about the link between 14 smoking and cancer. 15 and even dr. proctor conceded that this 16 debate, open and valid debate, lasted into the 17 mid-1950s. why do we focus on that and why was 18 that so important? 19 well, it was important because when 20 dr. goldberg got up. it was important because what 21 dr. goldberg was telling you, he was showing you 22 all those things from the files of hill & knowlton, 23 the pr firm that had been hired. he was focusing 24 on those and faulting us for this debate, these 25 issues that we were putting out there, the 1 statements we were making about cigarettes. he was 2 faulting us because we clung to positions that 3 would later be proven wrong. 4 but the fact of the matter is at the time 5 those statements were made, through the mid-1950s, 6 there was significant doubt, even according to 7 dr. proctor, significant doubt within the 8 scientific community. you know, a lot of it. 9 you know, just like cell phone industry today, 10 you know, there is doubt. allegations often get 11 raised about an industry's product, and even 12 goldberg admitted it was commonplace for industries 13 to defend themselves. there is nothing wrong with 14 that. 15 maybe the tobacco industry defended themselves 16 too long. i do not deny that. mr. woods does not 17 deny it. the industry does not deny it after 1964, 18 when the surgeon general's report came out. the 19 companies may have held their position too long. 20 but the question is: does it really matter in 21 this case so many, many years later? it does not, 22 because after '64, there was widespread 23 understanding and belief that cigarettes were 24 harmful. 25 again, mary riddel showed you the polls. we 1 saw the polls from the roper organization, 2 overwhelming majorities of people believed it. no 3 one was deceived. no one started to smoke because 4 of anything we said or we did not say. 5 ms. shamp made the point, she points to the 6 findings and she says, "the findings are the 7 findings. the findings say concealment. they 8 cannot deny the findings," and she is right. you 9 cannot deny that concealment if you get to this 10 point. 11 but, by the same token, the plaintiffs cannot 12 show that it had any effect on bill sury. 13 bill sury is not here so he cannot say it did not have 14 any effect on him, but we can point to other 15 indications that it had no effect on very many 16 people at all. 17 and, again, i go back to the roper poll where 18 they asked, "do you believe what the tobacco 19 industry spokesmen are saying?" how many people? 20 what percent of people believe? 3 percent. 21 they cannot show that any statement had an 22 effect upon bill sury. ms. shamp opened with the 23 statement that they -- she said this: they told 24 him things that he believed. well, first, i do not 25 think he believed anything that he might have 4604 1 heard. but secondly, there is no evidence in this 2 case that the industry told bill sury anything, 3 that he saw anything. 4 they point to this tobacco -- excuse me, 5 tomato ad put out about tomatoes. hundred years 6 ago tomatoes were poison. and you heard dr. sury 7 say to you, "my dad and i looked at this together." 8 and this -- this is their only evidence that 9 dr. sury -- excuse me, bill sury saw anything 10 supposedly denying the knowledge. this is it. and 11 it is significant, and i raise it because the 12 tobacco industry did not even put this out. it was 13 put out by the tobacco farmers. 14 thus they can do, there is no evidence that 15 bill sury saw anything that was said by reynolds, 16 by lorillard, by the industry, by the tobacco 17 institute, hill & knowlton. there is none of it. 18 she tried, but it is not there. 19 and now i'd like to talk about dr. proctor's 20 second opinion. that is the opinion that the 21 tobacco industry has known for decades that 22 nicotine was addictive but chose not to tell the 23 public. 24 let us talk about addiction because, 25 apparently, the findings address concept of 1 addiction. what does that mean? i want to start 2 with the word, the term, the phrase, the descriptor 3 "addicted." what does that mean? and was the 4 industry -- and this is important -- was the 5 industry trying to hide something about this 6 concept of addiction? 7 and that is why we went through the history of 8 the word. you heard the evidence. for years and 9 decades, the scientific community agreed that 10 nicotine was not addictive. surgeon general said 11 that in 1964 and he said it again and again and 12 again. it was habit, not addictive. 13 and that was because the definition of 14 addiction that everybody was living by for so long 15 was that it had to be intoxicating, and nicotine 16 was not intoxicating. 17 but then what we saw is in the early, 18 mid-1980s, the number of anti-smoking activists, 19 including people who make money testifying against 20 the company, started to push for a new definition. 21 they wanted to drop this intoxicating thing so 22 that nicotine, along with coffee, by the way, would 23 be classified now as addictive. and why did they 24 want to do that? well, let me go to 25 demonstrative 9, if we could. 1 you saw the notes of this seminole conference 2 in 1986 of a government agency, nida. the nida, 3 that is national institute on drug abuse, had a 4 working meeting where they convened it specifically 5 to discuss trying to change the definition of 6 addiction. and what were their reasons? 7 this is an exhibit that will be back in the 8 jury room with you. i encourage you to look at it 9 if you have any questions about this issue of 10 addiction. 11 they wanted to change it, and they say it 12 right here: "it is because policymakers do not 13 base their decisions on reason, rationality and the 14 weight of the evidence. we should use the word 15 'addiction' for its visceral effect on the public 16 and the pressure on lawmakers that will result." 17 they wanted to change it -- this suggests -- 18 not for any scientific reason, but for the visceral 19 effect on the public and to put pressures on 20 lawmakers, anti-tobacco pressure on lawmakers. 21 and why? because if they got cigarettes 22 classified as addictive, maybe they could get the 23 government to ban cigarettes, which is what they 24 wanted to do. 25 and they also wanted the word changed for 1 another reason. it has a lot of resonance here, i 2 suggest, in these tobacco trials. they wanted to 3 use this, quote, emotion-laden word because it 4 forces the nonsmoking public to have more 5 compassion for smokers and to invest in their 6 treatment. 7 they wanted to do it to turn these people 8 addicted, addicted, for sympathy reasons. and in 9 part, i think sympathy for the plaintiffs in court. 10 that is why we have the word "addictive" now linked 11 to cigarettes. 12 and even dr. proctor acknowledged here that 13 this change was motivated, at least in part, by 14 political reasons. and so then the surgeon general 15 two years later changes the definition. 16 we say the surgeon general changed the 17 definition, and that is right. in the 1988 report, 18 the surgeon general says nicotine is addictive. 19 but if you got one of those surgeon general reports 20 back there, look to see if it is just his report, 21 and if not, just who else's report it is. because 22 there is testimony on this from dr. proctor. 23 that report shows clearly that the senior 24 scientific editor was a man named neal benowitz, an 25 individual who makes a lot of money testifying 1 against the industry. 2 in any event, dr. benowitz, working through 3 the surgeon general and the other people who went 4 to this political conference, got the definition 5 changed and now, voila, nicotine is now an 6 addictive substance. 7 and i make that point for another reason too, 8 because when our chief executive officers were 9 subpoenaed to come up to capital hill in 1994, they 10 were brought up there to ask about addiction 11 because they continued to say, "we do not believe 12 in this new definition. we do not believe that our 13 products should properly be classified as 14 addictive." 15 and you saw them. they all got up on the 16 stand. they are sworn. there is pictures of them 17 broadcast all over the world. and they are asked, 18 each one of them: do you believe nicotine is 19 addictive? and they said no. and they were 20 pilloried by that, for that. 21 and ms. shamp showed you the video clip 22 showing them that they -- and suggesting that they 23 were not telling the truth. and even dr. sury got 24 up and made the additional comment. i'm not sure 25 why, but he made the additional comment that his 1 father was mad because these tobacco company 2 executives were, quote, in dr. sury's words, lying 3 under oath. 4 well, they did not show you the rest of those 5 video clips. they did not show you when our chief 6 executive officers got up there in the beginning 7 and went through precisely why they did not think 8 it was addictive. 9 they were not taking issue with some 10 established scientific fact. they were simply 11 pointing out that they disagreed with this rather 12 political change in the definition. 13 we showed you the full video of our president, 14 jim johnson, testifying why he thought that this 15 was an ill-advised change. and lorillard's 16 president and each of the other presidents said 17 exactly the same thing. they said why. they 18 did not agree with the new definition. you know 19 what, at that time, the world health organization 20 did not agree with it either. 21 we are basing our position up there on the 22 established definition and one that was still 23 recognized around the world. what we were doing 24 was taking issue with the politicized new 25 definition. 1 and then with respect to the rest of the 2 opinion that dr. proctor brought you that we chose 3 not to tell the public that cigarettes were 4 addictive, nicotine was addictive, there is no 5 evidence that the public did not know. 6 and we have gone back and showed you all of 7 that, from john quincy adams up through lady 8 nicotine, a tex williams' song about smoking the 9 cigarette and "i'll kill the son of a gun that got 10 me hooked in the first degree." people had known 11 that. there was nothing there hidden. people knew 12 it. this whole issue about addiction is a 13 political issue to try to create sympathy. 14 third opinion, dr. proctor. dr. proctor says 15 that cigarettes are no less harmful than -- excuse 16 me, filtered cigarettes are no less harmful than 17 unfiltered, that we just did not tell the public. 18 we chose -- we knew they were less harmful. we 19 choose not to tell the public. 20 well, what is wrong with that one? we disagree 21 with the entirety of the proposition. we told you 22 why: filtered cigarettes are less harmful. just 23 think about it. how can they not be less harmful 24 when you put a filter on the tip of an unfiltered 25 cigarettes? 1 it is not just us telling you that. it is every 2 scientist we brought to you through the articles. 3 all of the scientists, doll and russell and all of 4 that, every one of them agreed that filtered 5 cigarettes were less harmful, low-tar cigarettes 6 were less harmful and saved lives. 7 the surgeon general said, "they are less 8 harmful. they save lives." all the scientists. 9 it is only -- who disagrees with that? did you see 10 one study disagreeing with that? from burns? 11 proctor? no. goldberg? they disagreed, but they 12 did not, again, present you with one study. it is 13 just their opinion. 14 all they would say is that, "well, the studies 15 are flawed because people take harder hits, and 16 when the people did these flawed studies, they 17 did not know about compensation." 18 and so, once again, we had to bring you the 19 snippets, the chapters, whatever, in the work of 20 nah, russell and doll and jarvik that talk about 21 their understanding that there was this 22 compensation. 23 people might smoke a little harder on a 24 filtered cigarette or a low-tar cigarette or have 25 more of them, but that it is still safer. even 1 despite the fact they do that, the studies show 2 they are still safer. 3 dr. proctor, you do not want to talk about 4 compensation all the time, and he said they knew 5 more about it than the scientific community, and 6 there is no evidence of that. he presented you 7 none. 8 and by the way, this has nothing to do, once 9 again, with bill sury. there is no evidence that 10 bill sury ever compensated. 11 and now, let me get you to dr. proctor's last 12 opinion. still, by the way, having nothing to do 13 with bill sury, and i remind you that i wrote this 14 up here -- well, can we go to the elmo, please, 15 because i'm working off a different one. 16 all of these opinions i've asked them do any 17 of these opinions have anything to do with this 18 case, with bill sury at least, and the answer was 19 no, no, no and no, none of it. 20 but here's the last opinion. it is the most 21 interesting one, i think, in terms of dr. proctor: 22 smoke and mirrors worked. again, no evidence that 23 a single person started to smoke because of any of 24 this supposed smoke and mirrors. 25 and the best proof on this came from 1 dr. proctor himself. remember, i asked him about 2 studies, once again, studies. one study, one 3 peer-reviewed study that shows that smoke and 4 mirrors worked. 5 and i wrote this on the board. i did not write 6 it with a big enough magic marker. i apologize. 7 but i'll read it to you now. dr. proctor says no 8 peer-reviewed study publication concluded that any 9 statement of the tobacco industry influenced 10 anyone's belief whether cigarettes are dangerous. 11 i wrote that on the board. he said, "that is 12 right." 13 number two, no study showing any tobacco 14 industry statement influenced anyone's decision to 15 smoke. i wrote that on the board. he said, 16 "that is right too. i cannot think of one." no 17 study that any ad campaign influenced anyone's 18 decision to smoke. he said, "that is right. i 19 cannot think of one." 20 as i was walking away, he said, "by the way, 21 oh, i'm sure i think there might be one." you 22 think for a minute that if he knew of one he 23 would not have presented you with it? of course 24 not. he is been asked this. he was asked this six 25 months ago, "can you remember any study?" no. 1 and you do not think he would have looked for 2 one? he comes in here six months later, again 3 dr. proctor, any statement, any study? "i cannot 4 think of one. there is none. no studies." 5 nobody was mislead. nobody was deceived. the 6 word has been out there since the 1950s. yes, 7 ms. shamp is right, we put the thing on the board. 8 you can -- dr. horn, "you know, you can shout it 9 from the rooftops. nobody else will hear. nobody 10 will get any additional information." 11 it is not just dr. horn. how about dr. heller. 12 can we go to him? 13 1957, seven years before the surgeon general's 14 report: "newspapers, radio, tv have done an 15 excellent job covering this problem, and an 16 objective job. it is an exceedingly valuable way of 17 informing the public." 18 now, in my opening statement -- maybe we can 19 go back to the elmo -- i took you through -- i had 20 my own slide on dr. proctor's testimony, and i put 21 it up on the board and i'll show it to you again. 22 three holes in his testimony. first, smokers 23 were not deceived about the real hazards of 24 cigarettes. we proved that. second -- not even 25 our burden to prove it, we proved it. 1 second, smokers did not start to smoke or 2 continue to smoke because of anything that the 3 tobacco companies said or did. again, not our 4 burden to prove the negative, by the way, but i 5 think we proved it. not our burden to prove the 6 first one, the negative, but i think we proved it. 7 and they certainly did not come close to disproving 8 that. 9 third, bill sury was not deceived. he knew 10 the risks of smoking. i think we have proved that 11 too. 12 have the plaintiffs presented you any 13 information to suggest that bill sury was somehow 14 deceived, particularly given his job? no evidence 15 he was deceived, just like there is -- just like 16 hal rush who told it like it is. since he was a 17 boy, he knew that smoking was dangerous. it is 18 common sense. 19 and particularly with bill sury, because even 20 as much as the public knew, he knew more. he knew 21 precisely the risks. he saw it every day. he 22 worked with it. given his background as an 23 underwriter, the health risks, as dr. goldberg 24 said, would be more salient and certainly more 25 vivid. 1 even dr. proctor could not deny this. even 2 dr. proctor's response to my question said, well, 3 he admitted, as he had to, that despite his 4 opinion, he did have to acknowledge that some 5 people were aware of the risks and were not 6 deceived. and if anyone was aware, it was 7 bill sury. 8 dr. burns, dr. burns was the expert that came 9 to you on videotape. he talked about a lot of his 10 credentials on direct examination. and on 11 cross-examination you learned one of his 12 credentials was testifying against the tobacco 13 industries over and over and over. 14 he on cross -- on direct tried to paint this 15 picture of deceit and obstruction beginning back 16 with the plaza hotel. remember that? the plaza 17 hotel, the frank statement. there is nothing secret 18 about this, nothing. 19 the government was invited to attend. it was 20 reported in the new york times. the frank 21 statement, nobody heard that, nobody saw that, and 22 there is no evidence that bill sury saw it. it ran 23 one day. 24 on direct examination, dr. burns was quite 25 critical of a lot of the research that was 1 sponsored by us, by ctr and tirc. it was not until 2 cross-examination that we had to bring out the 3 point that that research was done by many 4 distinguished scientists, top universities, 5 co-funded, by the way, with the national cancer 6 institute, published in many peer-reviewed 7 journals. and even the findings that were hurtful 8 to us back then were published. and this research 9 was cited in many, many surgeon general's reports. 10 dr. burns talked about the vital information 11 about smoking and health being concealed, but it 12 was not until cross-examination that he acknowledged 13 that more people know that smoking causes disease 14 than know the name of the president of the 15 united states. and that notwithstanding anybody's 16 addiction, smokers can quit and they are reasonable 17 for their own behavior. 18 dr. goldberg, his opinions. let me start with 19 the obvious here. dr. goldberg came and talked to 20 you about advertising. i'll get there in a minute 21 as to why dr. goldberg came, but let me start by 22 saying, no evidence that bill sury started to smoke 23 because of advertising. we will go through his 24 opinions any ways, but let me start with that. 25 you know, we talked a lot about his wine 1 cooler article and how he had this transformation 2 once he started to get paid. and now he thinks 3 that cigarette advertising causes people to smoke. 4 and not just some people, all people are influenced 5 directly or indirectly by advertising, according to 6 dr. goldberg. 7 dr. goldberg did not like my insinuation when 8 i suggested that going to plaintiff's witness 9 school and getting paid might have had something to 10 do with the change in his opinion. 11 and so he told us, "well, you know, i wrote 12 that article back in '92 and that was before '94, 13 and in '94 it was still sort of on the fence." 14 remember, he said that the surgeon general was not 15 quite sure, looked like maybe, maybe not, maybe, 16 maybe, maybe not advertising caused people to start 17 to smoke. 18 but then he said, "but the '94 report, of 19 course, was before all these other studies came 20 out, and now it is crystal clear, everybody agrees, 21 everybody." 22 well, once again, dr. goldberg, i suggest, 23 does not really know the studies because he said all 24 these studies were laid out in the monograph 19 25 that he wrote. i think he wrote it, but i do not 1 think he read the studies if he said that now it is 2 clear when it was not in 1994. 3 can we go to demonstrative 13? can you 4 highlight where we can highlight there? 5 these are the studies he talked about. you will 6 have monograph 19 back in the jury room, if you 7 want to look at it. and what this shows are all 8 the studies of tobacco advertising and consumption 9 as of 2008. 10 and you can go through these, these before '94 11 and after. and i've highlighted the ones that are 12 after. and the unhighlighted ones are before. and 13 you can see over in the right-hand column the major 14 conclusions. it will say, for example, up here, 15 the hamilton study, no effect of advertising. 16 schmalensee, no effect. mcginnis, small positive. 17 grabowski no effect. schneider, no effect. and 18 then a small positive. and then it goes on and on 19 and on. 20 you can do the math. you count up the number 21 of studies that show no effect as opposed to 22 positive effect before 1994, you will see that it 23 was inclusive before 1994. and then if you do the 24 next part of that exercise with respect to after 25 '94, you will see the same thing, half and half. 1 the fact of the matter is that the studies 2 were inclusive before '94 and they are still 3 inconclusive. and i think that just shows that 4 dr. goldberg has not looked at those studies. 5 he cannot cite you to one study. all he can 6 tell you is the conclusions of the authors of 7 monograph 19 for people who testified for the 8 plaintiff. 9 he would never heard of conrad, flay & hill. he would 10 never heard of cea, council of economic advisers. 11 he had no interest -- remember, i kept asking him, 12 all these reports by the economists, the federal 13 trade commission who study this day in and day out. 14 ftc regulates advertising in this country, and 15 they have looked a lot at cigarette advertising just 16 to see if it has an effect. their conclusions he 17 did not even bother to look at. and in fact, he 18 says, "i do not have any interest in looking at 19 those conclusions." 20 and in this regard, let me come back one last 21 time to monograph 19. there is a study here that is 22 actually talked about in the text of monograph 19. 23 it is this one down here called andrews and frank, 24 91. and andrews and frank actually does find a 25 positive effect. 1 what is that positive effect? is the effect 2 of advertising so strong that, like dr. goldberg 3 said, everybody is starting smoke? no. the effect 4 is very small, 6 percent. 6 percent, that most 5 advertising had a 6 percent effect. 6 and the question was: was bill sury part of 7 that 6 percent? of course he was not. i do not 8 think bill sury was affected by advertising. 9 there is no evidence in this case that he started to 10 smoke or continued to smoke because of advertising. 11 so here's the question: if advertising has no 12 effect on people starting to smoke or it does not 13 have much of an effect -- because even all those 14 studies will show, most are inclusive. some show a 15 little -- why do companies advertise? 16 and here we discuss this, i hope it is no 17 surprise, why are they advertising for brand share? 18 keep their smokers loyal and to attract switchers. 19 people are using some other brand, want to make 20 them use your brand. every company does that. car 21 companies, toothpaste companies, everybody. 22 people do not start to brush their teeth. they 23 do not start to buy gasoline when they would not have 24 bought gasoline because of advertising. they 25 choose exxon or they choose the citgo down the 1 street because of advertising. 2 brand choice was the only effect that it 3 had -- excuse me, that advertising had upon 4 bill sury. and we saw that here. he switched to 5 tarrington for a short period of time because he 6 liked the ads, the i'd-rather-fight-than-switch 7 ads. 8 and then we saw that he was smoking some other 9 brand, and he switched to raleighs in order to get 10 the coupons to get his son a clock. 11 dr. goldberg had some other statistic to try 12 to suggest to you that we were advertising for 13 reasons unrelated to brand share. his numbers just 14 did not add up. 15 the fact of the matter is that dr. goldberg is 16 somewhat out of touch with the way advertising 17 affects people. he thinks that it is this great 18 powerful force that causes people to buy things 19 that they would otherwise not want to buy. 20 and i think we heard why he thinks that. he 21 thinks that smokers start to smoke because 22 smokers -- all smokers, he thinks, are dumber than 23 pidgeons. 24 well, you know, all this talk about 25 advertising and grand share and these advertising 1 studies, it is sort of interesting, at least for me. 2 but what does any of this advertising issues have 3 to do with bill sury? nothing. absolutely 4 nothing. squadoosh. it does not have a thing to do 5 because there is no evidence that bill sury started 6 to smoke because of advertising or continued to 7 smoke. 8 in my opening statement, once again, i tried 9 to forecast what i was going to try to show you 10 about all of the testimony we heard from, from 11 dr. goldberg. 12 and here's what i put on the board: first, 13 tobacco company advertising is not unique. we 14 spent hours listening to dr. goldberg go through 15 all our ads and say, "oh, gosh, they are suggesting 16 people give cigarettes for christmas. oh, they are 17 suggesting fun. oh, they are suggesting refreshing. 18 oh, they are using sports figures. oh, oh, oh." 19 what was the point of that? what is the point 20 of that? he admitted, tobacco company advertising 21 is not unique, all companies use the same type of 22 techniques. and then i said, "you know, i'm going 23 to show you that the reason companies advertise is 24 for brand share," and i think we showed that to 25 you. 1 and number three, bill sury did not start to 2 smoke because of advertising. and, again, we have 3 been sitting here for almost three weeks, not one 4 suggestion that bill sury started to smoke because 5 of advertising. 6 he might have bought a pack of tarringtons. 7 he might have switched to raleighs because of 8 advertising, but that was a switch. he did not 9 start to smoke. he did not not quit because of 10 advertising. 11 so why did dr. goldberg come? he came here 12 for one reason, because he had another part of his 13 testimony here. he came here to try to make you 14 mad. 15 and how did he try to do it? he tried to 16 convince you that our companies were out there and 17 are out there targeting youth. that is an 18 incendiary allegation. it strikes at everybody's 19 heart. we should not be doing that and dr. goldberg 20 comes in to say we are doing it. 21 how did he try to do that? he tried to do 22 that by showing you a bunch of documents from the 23 files of the companies that he says show youth 24 marketing, or youth targeting. 25 actually, it was not a bunch of documents. it 1 was seven, seven documents from a 90-year period. 2 he ignores all the other types of documents i was 3 talking about. he ignores all the other documents 4 in our files. seven documents. 5 and then he goes on from those seven to take 6 them remarkably out of context. let me start with 7 diane burrows. this is the diane burrows report. 8 he says it shows reynolds was targeting kids. 9 how does he do it? he points to one appendix 10 way at the back and up at the top it says, "youth 11 adult market," or something like that. and then 12 underneath it in the appendix it has some 13 government data showing age ranges 12 all the way 14 to 25 and up, and because it said "youth market" or 15 "youth, young adult" at the top, he says, "that is 16 how they defined it." 17 i took him through reference after reference 18 after reference. i hope you remember that. kept 19 going through them. diane burrows, right in the 20 introduction, what does she say? young adult 21 market. how does she define it? 18 to 24. "oh, 22 yeah, that is where she defines it there." we went 23 to the next page. "oh, yeah, that is how she 24 defines it there." we went all the way up through 25 it. 1 we got about eight, nine references and he 2 says, "oh, you have not been doing the other part of 3 it. you have not been saying" -- "you have missed all 4 these things." and remember this? i said, "okay," 5 because i know it does not say. i said, "okay. go 6 back, dr. goldberg. you tell me where it says it 7 defines it." 8 and he read something that was totally 9 irrelevant, and he was instructed to answer the 10 question by the judge and he finally had to admit 11 she does not say it. she does not say it. she is 12 talking about 18 to 24, which is an adult market. 13 how about this school days memo, 1927? one 14 reference, he says, prep schools. which, of 15 course, he said prep school and of course that 16 means it goes all the way down to middle school. i 17 do not know where he gets that. 18 but in any event, he ignored everything else 19 in that document. he ignored the direction to -- 20 marketing to who? men and women. he ignored the 21 fact that they should just be marketing to smokers. 22 he ignored the fact that they should just be trying 23 to market to smokers who are smoking smokes of 24 other companies. he ignored all that. 25 claude teague, we heard a lot about 1 claude teague, did not we? he told you a lot about 2 claude teague. here's what claude teague says in 3 his 1973 draft memo: "we should not in any way 4 influence nonsmokers to start smoking." and then 5 he talks about young adults as being 21. 6 dr. goldberg ignored that. 7 that tatham laird document, demonstrative 15. 8 they are talking about a new brand. the brand could 9 not be positioned against youth. there is 10 reference after reference after reference in our 11 files saying the same thing, all of which he 12 ignores. he ignores those references, even in the 13 same documents he cites. 14 and now we get to the other document, 15 hilton head, where it does say 14 to 24. it does. 16 but you know what, dr. goldberg had not done his 17 research on that one either because what were the 18 four campaigns that we were talking about in there? 19 what were the campaigns that were discussed there? 20 in other words, what were we intending to do? what 21 did we do? proof's in the pudding. 22 can we look at the next demonstrative. 23 four of these, the winston candid campaign. 24 that is not youth marketing. there is nobody there 25 under the age of 30. look at this guy up here 1 (indicating), you know, he looks about 50. 2 dr. goldberg thought he was 30. but in any event, 3 nobody under 30. and he could not say that that ad 4 had any particular appeal to kids. 5 and the next one, refresh, he said no 6 particular appeal to kids. he said, "oh, kids 7 would like to swim." but so would adults too. no 8 particular appeal. 9 went to the next one; denim. now, here, he 10 did say -- at first he said, "well, i do not think 11 there is any particular appeal to denim." then he 12 said, "well, you know, maybe kids like blue jeans 13 better than adults." well, come on. there is no 14 proof of that. there is no proof this is targeting 15 kids. 16 and finally, the last one there, we have the 17 meet the turk. this guy, i think he said he was, 18 you know, 30, 35, and he could not find one thing 19 in that ad that had a particular appeal to youth. 20 those ads are not targeted to youth. 21 and let me ask you just one more thing about 22 youth marketing: what does it have to do with 23 bill sury? bill sury did not start to smoke before 24 he was 18. no evidence he started smoking because 25 of advertising. no evidence he started to smoke 1 because of kid. 2 the only reason he came here, dr. goldberg 3 came here, once again, is to try to get you mad 4 because of this youth marketing issue, and it just 5 has no applicability here, or anywhere. 6 i want to put two numbers up on the board. 7 and the numbers are six out of 100 -- i'm not 8 having good luck up here. 9 six out of 100. i was going to put 10 out of 10 100 because of the polls, but -- because of this 11 roper poll that they showed, i'll use another 12 number which was in that roper poll, 11 out of a 13 100. 6 percent and 11 percent. and the reason i 14 put those there is because of the 6 percent effect 15 that advertising might have and the 11 percent of 16 people who did not recognize back in 1970, at 17 least, that smoking was not harmful. 18 and what the plaintiffs are trying to do here 19 is to show you that bill sury was one of the six 20 out of 100 and one of the 11 out of a hundred that 21 could possibly have been affected by advertising or 22 could possibly have been affected by something the 23 tobacco companies said or did. 24 plaintiffs want to convince you that he was in 25 those very small percentages because they need to, 1 to prevail in this case. how do they try to do it? 2 by ignoring all the evidence in the case. by 3 ignoring the fact that bill sury was an intelligent 4 man; he was an insurance underwriter. by ignoring 5 the fact he called them coffin nails. by ignoring 6 the fact that he and his friends laughed at the 7 warnings because they were so unnecessary. by 8 ignoring the fact that bill sury and his friends 9 growing up knew that smoking was dangerous. 10 and plaintiffs want you to ignore another 11 thing about bill sury; that he was a successful guy 12 with a successful career. they want you to think 13 something else about bill sury -- he is no longer 14 here to tell you otherwise, and they want you to 15 think he was not a success; that he was not a 16 professional; that he did not have a distinguished 17 career. you heard his son try and say that. 18 you heard his son try and say, and did say -- 19 did say that, "my father had a low-level job." 20 that was no slip of the tongue; he said it twice. 21 bill sury raised his son, provided for him, sent 22 him to college, medical school. bill sury was a 23 true gentleman. he was a wonderful man. he was a 24 good father. he did not complain. 25 you heard hal rush yesterday talk about how 4631 1 they used to drive together in the golf cart until 2 hal drove he and bill into the lake, and i asked 3 him about, "hey, what was bill sury's reaction to 4 that? what did he say? did he complain?" 5 "no, he did not complain." 6 "did he blame you?" 7 "nope." 8 he was a successful insurance professional. a 9 very intelligent man. he was a professional. he 10 was an executive. 11 and he did not blame anybody. bill sury, you 12 heard through ms. shamp, accepts his responsibility 13 for smoking. but this case is not brought by 14 bill sury. it is brought by his son who seeks to 15 recover from his dad's illness. we understand 16 that. that is the way things seem to work out in 17 florida for people who smoke and chose to smoke. 18 and you heard about why. they had this thing 19 called the engle case, the engle option here. they 20 have the engle option to sue the tobacco companies. 21 you heard dan sury, the brother. played his 22 deposition just a little bit. you heard him say 23 his nephew -- his nephew called him and said he had 24 found a window, a window, as he called it, to bring 25 this lawsuit. the law says he could bring a 1 lawsuit. 2 and maybe there is some cases out there where 3 the plaintiff really was confused about smoking, 4 but not here. 5 ms. shamp: objection, your honor. i think 6 he is going into whether -- 7 the court: excuse me. 8 ms. shamp: i think he is going into something 9 we discussed, your honor, in motion in limine. 10 mr. williams: no, your honor. i'm not. 11 the court: come to sidebar. 12 (a sidebar conference was held outside the 13 hearing of the jury as follows:) 14 ms. shamp: i loath to object to somebody's 15 closing argument, your honor, but he started going 16 into whether it was appropriate for this plaintiff 17 to bring this case. and then he started off with 18 saying bill sury does not blame anybody. 19 so i think this line of argument that he is 20 talking about whether it is appropriate to bring 21 this lawsuit. and this is a lawsuit that he has 22 the right to bring. it is not appropriate argument 23 for him to argue that this is an inappropriate 24 lawsuit or that william sury would not have wanted 25 to bring the lawsuit. 1 mr. williams: i'm not arguing that, 2 your honor. i'm -- i said it was appropriate for 3 him to bring it, and i said he could bring it. he 4 found this window to bring it. that is all. 5 ms. shamp: he found something called "the 6 window" and then he said -- 7 mr. williams: your honor, may i -- we tried 8 to keep the window out. they wanted it in. they 9 wanted it in to show -- look, i am not going to go 10 into any issue that bill sury would not have 11 brought this lawsuit. i understand that order and 12 i'm done with this area. i'm simply -- 13 ms. shamp: he said -- the last thing out of 14 his mouth before i objected was there might be some 15 cases, indicating that there is some cases that have 16 merit under engle and some cases that do not. and 17 that is where i think he is allowed to go. 18 the court: are you going any farther? 19 mr. williams: no. 20 the court: okay. 21 (the sidebar conference was concluded, and the 22 following proceedings were held in open court:) 23 mr. williams: there might be some cases out 24 there where people are confused. they were 25 confused. there might be some people within that 1 11 percent, but not bill sury. 2 and so i suggest to you that when you get to 3 the verdict form, the questions that relate to 4 whether or not these engle findings and the things 5 in the engle findings were the legal cause of 6 bill sury's death, the answer is no. the conduct 7 of the tobacco company was not the legal cause of 8 bill sury's death. 9 as i said before, these questions are a 10 progression. get through one, you go two through 11 five. and then if you go two through five 12 answering yes, then you get to number 6. 13 this one right here, you can see, is 14 comparative fault. if you find the tobacco 15 companies had some responsibility here, then you 16 have to decide how much. how much we had, my 17 client reynolds. how much mr. woods' client 18 lorillard had. and also how much -- of course, you 19 see there is a spot here for bill sury, william 20 sury. 21 there is no question here that bill sury 22 accepts responsibility. you heard ms. shamp say, 23 "well, okay, he accepts responsibility for all of 24 his smoking and failure to quit and what have you, 25 but only 10 to twenty percent." 1 in view of the overwhelming evidence in this 2 case, if there is responsibility, bill sury should 3 accept all of it. it was their evidence that gets 4 you there, frankly. 5 during the testimony of david burns, you heard 6 the surgeon general's view on whose decision it is 7 to quit. who did he say? it is the smokers'. he 8 told you who is responsible for quitting. what did 9 he say? he said it is the smoker. what burns said, 10 i repeat, "smokers are responsible for their own 11 behavior. it is their responsibility to quit." 12 and why is quitting even more important in 13 this case? we did not hear an awful lot about it, 14 but it is something called declining risk. 15 dr. burns testified about it, and let me go back to 16 it. 17 because if bill sury quit a number of years 18 ago, his risks of getting lung cancer would have 19 gone down significantly. dr. burns said after 20 15 years of quitting, so that would have been, for 21 bill sury, in 1980, 16 years after the 22 surgeon general's report. after 15 years, his risk 23 of death would have gone down by eighty percent. 20, 24 25 years later, ninety percent of the risk is gone. 25 think about that: if bill sury had quit when 1 hal and yancey quit, the risk of death would have 2 been down way, way down. bill sury is not this 3 ten percent responsible or this twenty percent 4 responsible. bill sury is responsible entirely for 5 his own decision. 6 but even, again, if you do not assess all of 7 the responsibility, you are going to have to make a 8 decision with respect to lorillard and reynolds. 9 what responsibility do they have? and that issue 10 depends on the amount he smoked of our brands, and 11 for how long. the brands he smoked and for how 12 long. 13 and this is another reason that we continue to 14 push the issue to you on the burden of proof 15 because we had a failure of proof, once again, from 16 the plaintiff on that issue. we do not know enough 17 about what brands bill sury smoked or for how long. 18 we know he started smoking, because we saw the 19 pictures of him with a cigarette, in the 1940s. we 20 do not know what the cigarette brand was. his 21 brother said he thought he was smoking raleighs 22 once when he visited him in the army, but after 23 that, there is this big dead space. we do not know. 24 that was back in the war. 25 and we know from dr. sury's testimony that up 1 until 1961 or '2 he was smoking some other brand. 2 we simply have almost 20 years of smoking history 3 unknown. we do not know who it is. it could have 4 been another company. we do not know. they failed 5 to prove that to you for those 20 years. 6 then we get up to the 1960s, so he smoked 7 raleighs for six -- six months to a year, and then 8 he switched, said he switched to kents. he says 9 couple years. yancey montgomery said something 10 else, little longer. 11 and then we heard some doral in there. we 12 heard l&m, which is not even our product. we heard 13 dorals. we do not know how much. he says -- i 14 do not know what he said, back in the '60s or 15 something. yancey montgomery said no, just a few 16 dorals in the '80s. and frankly, i think yancey 17 would know better. why? because he is playing golf 18 with him every week, and they are putting their 19 smokes right in the golf cart. he is going to be 20 able to see what he is smoking and sharing. 21 we do not know about dorals. we do not know how 22 many, how much, when. dr. sury says, well, from 23 the '90s to '95 he was smoking dorals, and he would 24 know that and, yes. 25 but the fact of the matter is we do not know 1 enough. we know he did smoke some of our product. 2 we know he smoked some of mr. woods' product. we 3 do not know for how long in any of these 4 circumstances. we do not know how much, how many 5 years. it is a failure of proof. 6 and so for that reason as well, i would 7 suggest one hundred percent allocation, in part for simply 8 the failure to bring the proof to mr. sury. 9 and then after question 6, we get to 10 question 7. what were the damages sustained by 11 robert sury? and let us look at what this is. for 12 his loss of his parental companionship, instruction 13 and guidance and for his pain and suffering. 14 now, let me start that by saying that if there 15 are any damages awarded in this case, these damages 16 are not awarded for the pain and suffering for any 17 loss of bill sury, even though he was a smoker. 18 that is the way it works. 19 they are awarded to robert sury. robert sury 20 must show you the loss of the companionship, 21 instruction and guidance. and, you know, sometimes 22 there is a loss for instruction and guidance, but 23 not here because when bill sury died, dr. sury was, 24 i believe, 46 years old. 41, 46. 41. i'm sorry 25 he was 41 years old. 1 he was already through medical school. he 2 already had a medical practice. there is no 3 evidence of any loss of instruction or guidance. 4 companionship, they lived together, but instruction 5 and guidance, no. and pain and suffering, this is 6 robert sury's pain and suffering, not his dad's. 7 and let me talk a little bit about something 8 that ms. shamp will certainly talk to you about, 9 which is his loss of life. she will show you these 10 government tables. they are called the life 11 expectancy tables. 12 and she will show you that at 78, somebody 13 who is 78 who died in 1995 would have an additional 14 life expectancy of seven years. in other words, if 15 you get to 78, odds are you are going to get about 16 to 85. that is the average. so seven years, okay. 17 and that is one way to look at it. but another 18 way to look at it is to go back and look at 19 bill sury's life because he was born in 1919, and 20 you will also see the life expectancy table for 21 somebody born in 1919. 22 and believe it or not, in 1919, the life 23 expectancy for somebody born in that year, a man, 24 was about 55 years. it is hard to believe, but 25 that is what it was in 1919. bill sury outlived 1 that by more than 20 years. he had a good life. 2 he would have had a happy life. he had a full 3 life. 4 and then if you get through that question -- 5 and, again, we hope you stop at number 1. if you 6 get through that question, you get to the question, 7 number 8, at the end, which is punitive damages. 8 let me talk about that. 9 if you get all the way through the verdict 10 form, yes, yes, to all of that, you are going to 11 have to decide what punitive damages are warranted. 12 you know, plaintiffs always make this claim. they 13 always sue -- they get to -- for compensatory 14 damages and for punitives. it goes hand and hand. 15 we do not like to get up here and talk about 16 punitive damages, of course, but we have to because 17 they get to claim that, punitive damages. 18 what the judge will instruct you on punitive 19 damages is a few things. and please bear these in 20 mind if you get that far. punitive damages are not 21 about compensation to dr. sury here. they are not 22 about making anybody whole for any loss. what 23 they are about is about even more money. 24 these punitive damages are designed to, what is 25 called punish and deter the defendants, to punish 1 and deter them for reckless disregard of human 2 life. and with punitive damages, the plaintiff 3 must meet an even higher standard. it is not just 4 one of these greater weights of the evidence. it is 5 the much greater weight of the evidence called 6 clear and convincing evidence. 7 and i'm obviously here to say that this case 8 has nothing to do with punitive damages. but apart 9 from everything i've said before, there is no need, 10 there is no reason here to punish reynolds or 11 lorillard. 12 you have heard about the efforts of the tobacco 13 industry to try to make cigarettes safer. they are 14 a harmful product. everybody knows that. we have 15 tried to make them safer. and we have been trying it 16 for decades and decades. since 1950s when it was 17 first realized that they were harmful, we have tried, 18 if you heard about it, remove harmful chemicals 19 from them called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. 20 dr. figlar talked about that. 21 we have cooperated all we can with the federal 22 government at tobacco working group trying to make 23 a safer cigarette, trying to develop a less 24 hazardous cigarette. 25 and a lot of that was this low tar effort, 1 which was encouraged by the federal government and 2 we did it, and that is when we made low-tar 3 cigarettes in part. we thought it was good too. 4 why did we do that? we did that for one reason: 5 to reduce the risk for smokers who still chose to 6 smoke. 7 with respect to reynolds -- i'm very proud of 8 this. you heard from dr. figlar, and even 9 dr. proctor admitted it, this revolutionary 10 breakthrough that reynolds is coming up with, at 11 first it was called premiere, now it is called 12 eclipse. it is this cigarette that does not burn 13 tobacco. it heats it. 14 i talked to dr. proctor about that, and even 15 dr. proctor, no friend of the industry, said that 16 smoking eclipse would cause significantly fewer 17 deaths. 18 quite recently reynolds -- you heard about 19 this nitrosamine. reynolds had found that one of 20 the ways that the farmers were curing tobacco was 21 actually increase the amount of something called 22 nitrosamines into the tobacco. 23 so they came up with a new way. reynolds came 24 up with a new way to cure tobacco for the farmers. 25 and they have gone out all over the country, 1 wherever tobacco is grown, to tell them how to do 2 that. 3 in every decade since the 1950s, r.j. reynolds 4 has been working to make its product safer. 5 perhaps we waited too long acknowledging that 6 smoking caused lung cancer, but our record in 7 trying to make cigarettes is safer is hardly a 8 record of reckless disregard of health. 9 you also saw in the testimony of dr. figlar 10 something else that reynolds is doing today about 11 smoking and lung cancer. you saw the websites, the 12 educational programs with respect to smoking and 13 lung cancer and addiction and relying on public 14 health authorities. 15 you got the quit line up there. can you 16 imagine that, you know, a company trying to get 17 people to quit and not to use their products? it is 18 not a record that requires punishment for 19 deterrents. 20 so if you get that far, and i hope you do not, 21 i hope you find that punitive damages are not 22 warranted. 23 i'm about done. but before i finish, i want 24 to remind you of one thing. remember when we were 25 over in voir dire, jury selection over in the other 1 courthouse, i asked the question right at the end 2 of all the questions i got to ask, and i asked you 3 and i asked everybody in the room one question. 4 i said, look, even if the evidence shows that 5 bill sury was not addicted, or even if the evidence 6 shows that he could have quit, that it was not the 7 legal cause, and even if we show you that cancer 8 was not caused by smoking or they failed to show it, 9 and even if there is no evidence that bill sury 10 smoked because of anything the tobacco companies 11 did or said, and i put all that out there, i asked 12 you, i asked the whole group if you could decide 13 the case on those facts and just those facts, that 14 you could decide the case and not be swayed because 15 of some sympathy for robert sury here or to find 16 for robert sury just because he had brought the 17 case. i asked that question and i put it out to 18 everybody. 19 and i do not know if you remember this, two 20 people raised their hand and said, "why?" and, of 21 course, because of that, they were not selected to 22 sit on this jury. 23 but i mention that because none of you raised 24 your hands. and all of you agreed, i believe, to 25 decide this case just on the basis of the evidence 1 that we presented here and nothing else, and 2 certainly not on any sympathy. 3 so i ask you when you remember to please 4 remember that when you go to the jury room. you 5 agreed that you would decide the case just on the 6 basis of the facts presented. 7 i'm done. let me leave you with this: 8 bill sury made choices throughout his life. he 9 made a choice to smoke. he made a choice to 10 continue to smoke. he made a choice not to quit. 11 it was a choice not to quit. 12 he made a choice to disregard the warnings of 13 his friends and his family. he made a choice to 14 disregard the warnings on the pack. bill sury 15 lived the way he wanted to live his life. 16 bill sury chose to smoke cigarettes on his own 17 freewill. smoking was bill sury's choice and 18 smoking was bill sury's responsibility. 19 again, let me thank you for your service. let 20 me thank you for your attention, your patience, and 21 i hope you enjoy it. 12 mr. woods: thank you, your honor. 13 good afternoon, everyone. you remember me, 14 david woods, for lorillard. 15 this case is about bill sury. the plaintiff's 16 counsel, ms. shamp, said this case is also about the 17 tobacco companies, and i do not disagree with that. 18 we are obviously here. you have seen documents from 19 r.j. reynolds, from lorillard. we have have done our 20 best as the trial has gone on to try to put those 21 documents in context, try to explain what we can. 22 to the extent that there is no good explanation, 23 sometimes there is no good explanation. 24 but what i want to do now is walk through the 25 evidence, especially as it relates to lorillard, and 1 talk to you about what i think the evidence has 2 shown in this case. 3 you will remember this slide from when i started, 4 and that is, what does this have to do with bill 5 sury? you have heard that a lot now. you hear it 6 over and over and over. but it is important, because 7 the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to prove 8 that if either company did something that it caused 9 either bill sury to start smoking, to continue to 10 smoke, or not to smoke, or not to quit earlier. 11 and we do pretrial discovery before the trial 12 starts, and so we have a pretty good idea of who is 13 coming and what they are going to say, what witnesses 14 and what they are going to say. and you have seen dr. 15 proctor and you have seen dr. goldberg, you have seen 16 kristy leung, who was the lorillard marketing 17 representative. you have seen ed robinson, who was 18 the lorillard company scientist. you saw dr. burns, 19 who was on video. and you notice that -- and the 20 reason why i put this up in opening is i think that 21 you probably noticed that those videos especially 22 were taken in other cases, and the idea is you play 23 them in this case really without regard to who the 24 particular smoker is, what brands they smoked, when 25 they smoked them, when they started, and when they 1 quit. 2 and so, for example, with kristy leung you saw 3 all sorts of advertisements and documents and other 4 things relating to old gold, relating to newport, 5 relating to true. all brands that dr. sury 6 confirmed his dad never smoked. 7 and so the question is what does that have to 8 do in this case about bill sury. you have obviously 9 seen kent ads, and the testimony in this case is 10 that mr. sury smoked kent for a time. was it two 11 years like dr. sury says, or was it longer? you are 12 the jury. i'll put that in your hands. i think mr. 13 williams agrees we will put that in your hands in 14 terms of who proved what. 15 but at the end of the day it is still 16 plaintiff's burden to prove that anything that you 17 saw caused bill sury to smoke or caused bill sury to 18 not quit sooner than he did. 19 now, youth smoking. there was a lot of time 20 spent in this case on youth smoking, but the 21 evidence is clear that mr. sury started smoking when 22 he was 21 years old, in 1941. and so like mr. 23 williams said, there may be cases out there where 24 some young person started smoking, was affected by 25 advertisements, did not know the health risks, got 1 addicted and was unable to quit, but that is not this 2 case. that is not bill sury. 3 bill sury, when he smoked kent he was over 45 4 years old, sometime in the mid 1960's is the 5 testimony. he was married, he was a father, he had 6 been a life insurance underwriter for ten years. 7 you know, i want to talk a little bit about 8 this underwriter thing. i do not know what an 9 underwriter does. i do not know if an underwriter is 10 an executive or if it is not an executive. 11 respectfully, i'm not sure if that this case is 12 about whether bill sury was an executive or not an 13 executive. 14 what we do know is that he worked for 15 prudential insurance company. we know that the job 16 of an insurance company, and from what we understand 17 the job of an underwriter is, is to look at peoples 18 individual risks and determine whether that might 19 affect their longevity, how long they are going to 20 live. 21 and we know from dr. sury's testimony that one 22 of the things that mr. sury looked at when he was 23 doing that was whether somebody smoked. and you 24 recall when mr. williams mentioned this that dr. 25 goldberg agreed that for an underwriter that that 1 type of information, awareness of the health risks 2 of smoking, would be more salient, would be more 3 vivid. 4 and so to the extent that there is relevance in 5 this case that mr. sury was an underwriter, that is 6 what it is. whether he was an executive or not an 7 executive to me does not matter. 8 but again, youth smoking i would submit to you 9 really in some other case maybe, in this case it is 10 not relevant. 11 nicotine. you saw and you heard -- in ms. 12 shamp's opening statement she read some documents 13 talking about minimum levels of nicotine and spiking 14 nicotine, that type of thing, and i tried to explain 15 in opening and then i tried to bring evidence during 16 trial during on cross-examination with dr. proctor 17 and also through the lorillard company's scientist 18 ed robinson, which i'm going to talk to in a minute. 19 but before we get there, i mean, let us talk 20 about nicotine. there is no secret that nicotine is 21 in cigarettes. there is no secret that one of the 22 reasons why people smoke is because there is 23 nicotine in tobacco. nicotine is naturally in 24 tobacco. tobacco companies do not put nicotine in 25 tobacco. mother nature puts nicotine in tobacco. 1 one of the reasons, like i said, that people 2 smoke is because of nicotine. is it the fundamental 3 reason? i do not know. is it fundamental for 4 somebody and maybe not fundamental for another? i 5 do not know. but it is one of the reasons why people 6 smoke, and that is not a secret. 7 now, cigarettes can be addictive. no doubt 8 about it. we also know that even addicted smokers 9 can quit. and i'm not saying it is easy for 10 everybody. i'm not saying that some people -- 11 particularly if you are addicted it may take multiple 12 times. but i think that really comes down to 13 motivation. and when i say motivation i do not mean 14 lack of willpower, you did not try hard enough. it is 15 whether you truly in your heart of hearts whether 16 you want to be a nonsmoker, whether you want to 17 be -- more than you want to be a smoker. 18 but anyway, nicotine is naturally in tobacco. 19 there is actually more tobacco in the leaf -- we 20 talked about that -- in the ground when it comes out 21 than in a commercial cigarette. 22 nicotine levels -- you may have seen i spent a 23 lot of time pulling up nicotine -- tar and nicotine 24 level charts. you remember the reader's digest from 25 1957, then the reader's digest from 1958 that shows 1 that tar and nicotine levels have gone down. so the 2 importance of that is that it is not -- there is no 3 magic level of nicotine. there is no magic point, 4 whatever, that if you have that much nicotine that is 5 how you addict people. 6 and that is just common sense, if you think 7 about it, because somebody can smoke a half pack a 8 day of an ultra light cigarette and they are going to 9 get x-amount of nicotine. now, they may be 10 addicted. somebody else may smoke two packs a day 11 of unfiltered cigarettes. they are going to get a 12 lot more nicotine. they may be just as addicted as 13 somebody who smokes and gets very, very much less 14 nicotine. 15 no witness came in here to say more nicotine 16 equals more addictive, or less nicotine means less 17 addicted. if that was the case then on average, 18 since nicotine levels have gone down over time, 19 theoretically cigarettes would be less addictive 20 today than they were 50 years ago. and i do not 21 think any scientists believe that. i do not believe 22 that. so there is no magic dose of nicotine. 23 but again the nicotine manipulation. you 24 recall we spent a lot of time talking with dr. 25 proctor, and you may have missed it with the ed 1 robinson video, the lorillard company's scientist, 2 because frankly they are not the most exciting things 3 to watch. but even within there dr. robinson and 4 dr. proctor basically agreed when it came to the 5 tobacco working group. again, you remember i used 6 this document with dr. proctor, national cancer 7 institute, it is from 1976. 8 when you go back -- when you go back to the 9 jury room, if you are concerned about whether 10 lorillard or anybody else manipulated nicotine in 11 cigarettes, please search out the lorillard nicotine 12 documents and read them and read them. read them 13 front to back. and then also read this, and this is 14 trial exhibit 354, and you will seen gio gory from the 15 national cancer institute, brown & williamson, 16 filter manufacturers, and you will remember dr. tso 17 from the u.s. department of agriculture, you will 18 remember he was the one who actually in that 19 document had the idea of adding nicotine to 20 cigarettes. and again, the idea was if tar is the 21 bad thing, but people are going to smoke for 22 nicotine, if you can drop the tar, but you can keep 23 the nicotine where it is, then maybe, maybe that 24 will make it less hazardous. and scientists at the 25 time thought it was a good thing. 1 at the end of the day it did not work. it never 2 resulted in a commercial product. for whatever 3 reason people did not like the taste, did not like 4 cigarettes with lower tar and medium nicotine. so 5 at the end of the day -- i mean, i guess this is 6 relevant as to lorillard and as to bill sury and 7 kent in this case, no kent cigarette ever had low 8 tar medium nicotine, for better or worse. 9 so again you remember this from opening. i 10 tried to boil down what i think this case is about: 11 control, causation, and responsibility. 12 control. who ultimately -- sort of a buck 13 stops here. who ultimately was in control of mr. 14 sury's decision to smoke, his decision to pick up 15 that first cigarette, his decision to continue 16 buying cigarettes, and then his decision ultimately 17 to quit in 1995 when he did quit. 18 causation. you will remember there are two parts 19 to the causation. one is medical causation. and 20 we are going to talk about that in a little bit. but 21 the other one is legal cause. legal cause: the 22 idea that it is the plaintiff's burden to prove that 23 something that either r.j. reynolds or lorillard 24 tobacco company did to cause bill sury to do 25 something that he would not otherwise have done. 1 and we will talk about this as we walk through the 2 verdict form. but the idea here is -- it is called 3 the but for cause in law school, and it is in the 4 instructions. and the concept is that but for 5 something that lorillard did he would have done 6 something differently. and if the plaintiff's do not 7 prove that -- if he would have smoked if lorillard 8 were not even in the picture, then there is no but 9 for causation, because he would have smoked anyway. 10 responsibility. that is really -- that is the 11 when it is all said and done who ultimately is 12 responsible? who was in the best position, the 13 tobacco company, who has -- like it or not, society 14 has decided with warnings on the packs companies can 15 continue to sell and, with restrictions, advertise 16 the product. and so we cannot be punished, we cannot 17 be held liable merely for selling the product. 18 so at the end of the day the question is who is 19 in the best position ultimately to decide whether or 20 not to use the product. 21 so control. let us talk about that first. you 22 remember -- you will see i'm recycling a lot of my 23 slides from the opening. i think this is clear. i 24 think everybody agrees. i think plaintiff agrees, i 25 think reynolds agrees, and i know lorillard agrees 1 that bill sury, mr. sury, was an intelligent, 2 hardworking and successful person. whether he was 3 an executive or whether he was not an executive, it 4 does not matter, he was an intelligent, hardworking, 5 and successful. the witnesses told you that. every 6 fact witness that came in here from his son, dr. 7 sury, to his two golfing buddies, to his younger 8 brother, who you heard by deposition read to you 9 that he was intelligent, that he was well read, and 10 frankly that he was a good guy. no doubt about 11 that. no doubt about that at all. 12 you will remember the timeline that i showed you 13 in opening. i just want to bring it out here for 14 some reminders on dates. but again it shows -- and 15 mr. williams walked through some of this already, so 16 i'm not going to repeat it. but his time in the 17 army, moved his way up from enlisted to officer. 18 started out in the mailroom at prudential. 19 i mean, mr. sury was born in 1919. he was ten 20 years old when the stock market crashed. he is not 21 somebody who had anything handed to him. he got to 22 where he was by working hard, working hard in the 23 military, working hard at prudential. he got 24 himself, frankly, from the mailroom in 1939 to the 25 point where he is golfing every saturday with other 1 successful businessmen. i guess, yancey montgomery 2 and hal rush probably were executives. but, you 3 know, at the end of the day i think we all agree 4 that is pretty impressive. 5 we also know that mr. sury was an informed 6 adult smoker. we have already talked about the fact 7 that he was an adult before he ever first picked up 8 a cigarette, probably 21 years old, either right in 9 the military or right before the military. again 10 when he started smoking kent he was 45 years old at 11 least, somewhere in there. and dr. sury is 12 testifying from memory, from when he was fairly 13 young, but he recalls sometime in the mid 1960's. 14 ms. shamp said right after the surgeon general's 15 report. i do not know if that is right or not, but 16 it is sometime in the mid 1960's. 17 nobody came in here, no fact witness was able 18 to come in here and tell you why did bill sury 19 choose kent. over any other brand out there why did 20 he choose kent? 21 now, we know that dr. goldberg -- and we have 22 heard through ms. shamp it was because of the 23 advertising. it was because of the advertising that 24 was done in the 1950's, that greatest health 25 protection in cigarette history. well, you will 1 remember it was sort of my big aha moment, and it 2 was the -- this picture. and this picture i would 3 submit proves that those advertisements, the 4 greatest health protection advertisements -- you saw 5 one of those in ms. shamp's closing. you also saw, 6 i think it was the voice of wisdom ad. all of those 7 ads were before 1955. 8 you will remember in 1955 were the new ftc 9 advertising guides that said no more health claims 10 in advertising. then you remember dr. goldberg went 11 out and pulled the document out of his trunk and 12 said, aha, here's late '55 and you have got the ftc 13 yelling at you for your advertisements. i think we 14 explained that, well, that was because the 15 advertisement ran before the ftc guides went into 16 effect. 17 but be it as it may, those advertisements 18 stopped in 1955. i think you will probably see the ad 19 for more scientists and educators smoked kent, which 20 ran in 1960. but if you will recall, lorillard 21 started clearing its advertising through the ftc in 22 1958. and so to the extent that those ads ran, they 23 were approved by the ftc, for right or wrong, better 24 or worse. 25 and that is assuming that mr. sury even saw any 1 of them. and there was no evidence that he did. 2 but even assuming that he did. 3 but again back to the picture. you will recall 4 this is from 1956. this is mr. sury, and this is 5 the young future dr. sury. and it is hard to tell, 6 but you can -- that is obviously the white part of 7 the cigarette, that is a cork tip. if you have seen, 8 some brands have white tipping paper around them, 9 some have cork tip. and you will recall dr. goldberg 10 agreed kent always had -- and if you see more ads 11 after i sit down and ms. shamp gets back up you will 12 notice it always had a white filter, white paper 13 around the filter. so that is the best evidence i 14 can bring you that those ads did not make mr. sury 15 start smoking kent. 16 now, at some point, and i think there is no 17 dispute, he did start smoking kent. he started 18 smoking kent sometime in the mid 1960's. 19 now, i'll put this one up. these have some of 20 the facts from after 1960, but first i'm going to 21 put this up. and this another one of those you saw 22 for maybe ten seconds with kristy leung, and -- but 23 it is important, because what this shows is here's 24 1952. kent was not on the market before 1952. and 25 you see, if you can read this -- i apologize if you 1 cannot -- this is when it comes in. it says: 2 protection, the health protection ads '52 to 1954. 3 the voice of wisdom ad, 1955. 4 and you see that in 1954 kent brand here 5 actually drops. those advertisements were not 6 causing people to smoke kent. it actually started 7 to drop. then in 1956 and 1957 what happened? you 8 remember the reader's digest articles, the reader's 9 digest articles that did the test on kent and found 10 that kent was the best filter out there. 11 so there is a big difference between an 12 advertiser saying we are the greatest health 13 protection in cigarette history, market share goes 14 down. independent third party running independent 15 tests on tar and nicotine levels, it shot up. that 16 shows you the power of independent -- independent 17 analysis and what independent people say, because 18 people believe independent sources. 19 so again after that, kent now i think in 2010, 20 let us see, it is 0.0. the last time it is even 0.1 is 21 2004. so think about that when you are thinking 22 about effectiveness of kent advertising. 23 now, again, mr. sury was an adult informed 24 smoker. the risks were known. but i think mr. 25 williams read the last one here to you. but, you 1 know, dr. hammond from 1955, 1957 u.s. surgeon 2 general, 1957 u.s. national cancer institute, all 3 agree. now, dr. goldberg came in, and dr. goldberg 4 said the industry advertising, the wallpaper, and 5 everything hill & knowlton was doing, and whatever 6 the tobacco companies were saying, that watered down 7 the message, that confused people, that completely 8 drowned out the public health message. 9 well, that is what he says in 2011, but if you 10 would have asked these public health officials back 11 in the 1950's they would have disagreed with him. 12 likewise, you remember this. this was with dr. 13 riddel. ms. shamp has used some polls that were 14 done for the tobacco institute, and i think they 15 were found in philip morris files. you saw that dr. 16 riddel was not very impressed with them, but they are 17 in evidence. by all means, go back and read the 18 entire things, the entire polls, and see if they are 19 inconsistent with what we have here. 20 1954, seventy percent of people think smoking is 21 harmful. climbs up to 85 percent, 91 percent, 96 22 percent. and these are polls done -- the auts, 23 adult use of tobacco survey. remember, those are 24 polls that are done by the federal government. 25 so again, control. who was in control? who 1 was in the best position to affect whether mr. sury 2 started to smoke, or if he decided when to quit 3 smoking? 4 everybody has decided at one point in their 5 mind -- or one point in time whether they are going 6 to be a smoker or not. everybody is offered a 7 cigarette at one point, and you either try it or you 8 do not try it. and it is a personal decision that 9 everybody makes. mr. sury also had control over his 10 brand choice. 11 and you will remember you were shown all sorts of 12 articles about the public health community and what 13 they were telling smokers, telling them to quit, 14 quit smoking, but if you are not going to quit 15 smoking then at least switch to lower tar. 16 well, ms. shamp said mr. sury looked at these 17 in choosing what brands he was going to pick. well, 18 you see here it says you can buy as much as 34 19 milligrams of tar or as little as 2. kent is right 20 in the middle. so if somebody is going and their 21 goal is to find the lowest tar and nicotine, it is 22 not kent. kent was right there about with marlboro. 23 advantage is lower, carlton is lower. there is a lot 24 more lower, but i wanted to put the bigger brand 25 names up there. 1 so at the end of the day again it is no doubt 2 mr. sury was a great guy. yancey montgomery said 3 that he enjoyed smoking, from what he could observe 4 it looked like mr. sury enjoyed smoking. 5 dr. sury talked about how when his dad would 6 come home from work -- i think ms. shamp even 7 mentioned that in her closing -- he would sit down, 8 relax, put his feet up, you know, have a hi-ball, 9 bourbon and water, have a cigarette, talk to his 10 wife as she made dinner. all of bill sury's friends 11 smoke. his entire foursome smoked. 12 now, ms. shamp tried -- it seems like she is 13 portraying that as, oh, he smoked everywhere, so he 14 must have been addicted. but the fact of the matter 15 is that is what he did, it was part of his lifestyle. 16 he got together with friends and they joked around, 17 they golfed, and they played pooled or they played 18 cards after golfing, and they would smoke. and there is 19 nothing wrong with that. 20 but, you know, something else that you may have 21 noticed is that every fact witness who testified in 22 this case was at one point a smoker, but quit. 23 every one of them. daniel sury, bill sury's younger 24 brother, he quit in 1959. he had smoked for about 25 ten years one pack a day. he quit cold turkey when 1 he started having kids. dr. sury, you know, you 2 recall he read the warnings to his father, but then 3 he started smoking. you know, he did not smoke that 4 much and did not smoke very long, but even he quit 5 smoking. hal rush, you heard his testimony 6 yesterday. seems like it was a week ago. but you 7 recall that he -- he went and his father who was a 8 smoker was in an oxygen tent in the hospital, and he 9 recalls his father reaching out to try to get his 10 package of cigarettes, and he says that is it, i'm 11 stopping. that is motivation. 12 and it was not easy for hal rush. was hal rush 13 addicted? he may very well may have been. but 14 again it is motivation, and it is not willpower, it is 15 motivation, it is telling yourself i'm going to try. 16 i'm going to try like hal rush did. i'm going to 17 try hypnosis. 18 hypnosis did not work for him, so he went to 19 this nicotine withdrawal clinic that was down the 20 road, down san jose boulevard, and they stuck 21 apparently needles in his eyes and ears and nose, 22 and that was it for him and he stopped smoking. 23 yancey montgomery, two or three pack a day 24 smoker. he quit smoking because he started having 25 heart problems; smoked one last cigarette, quit cold 1 turkey. 2 but there is another one. mr. sury. mr. sury 3 quit. he quit six months before he was diagnosed. 4 this was not one of those situations where somebody 5 gets diagnosed with lung cancer and it is basically a 6 death sentence so they have got to quit. he quit 7 really before he started having any symptoms of his 8 lung cancer, six months before. he quit when he 9 started getting a cough, and when he quit his cough 10 went away, and he stayed quit. again motivation is 11 the key. you have seen these stats before. i'm not 12 going to keep quoting them to you. 13 dr. frazier. you will recall that was 14 plaintiff's expert. i guess she was not a 15 psychiatrist, but she was their addiction expert, 16 and even she agreed that the smoker -- it is 17 motivation -- the smoker has to want to quit. 18 we talked in opening about if you want your 19 spouse to go on a diet, or your spouse wants you to 20 go on a diet, or you want your kids to get straight 21 a's, well, they have -- motivation has to come from 22 within. 23 and the question is, is there evidence of mr. 24 sury being motivated. and again i'm not being 25 critical. i'm not saying he did not try hard enough, 1 he was not -- he did not have the willpower. but ask 2 yourself, if he would have wanted -- truly wanted to 3 quit smoking would not he have -- for example, with 4 friends and family, when hal rush came back, and 5 every saturday they are in the golf cart together, 6 you would think that at least once he would say, 7 hey, hal, tell me about that nicotine withdrawal 8 clinic you went to. i'm tired of smoking. i do not 9 want to smoke anymore. tell me about that. he 10 never did. 11 same thing with yancey montgomery. if they 12 were sitting around shooting pool or playing cards. 13 no conversations, no indication that he wanted to 14 quit. 15 now, there is also no dispute dr. sury wanted 16 his dad to quit smoking. no doubt about that. but 17 that is again you wanting something to do it. unless 18 they have internalized it and unless they want to do 19 it they are not going to make the changes that are 20 going to be required, because for some people it can 21 be hard to quit. 22 stop smoking clinics. in 1982 mr. sury retired 23 from prudential. at that point he is no longer going 24 in to work, he is no longer subject to the daily 25 grind and the stress of work. if he wanted to quit 1 smoking, if he was motivated to quit smoking, he had 2 every resource available to him. he had the 3 resources to go to stop smoking clinics, presumably 4 he had a doctor, he could have gone to his doctor 5 and sought help. he could have -- dr. sury 6 recommended, hey, dad, why do not you go to hypnosis. 7 his dad did not go. 8 and again i'm not being critical, but it is -- 9 if the question is whether mr. sury wanted to quit, 10 if you look at the objective evidence, the objective 11 evidence shows no motivation to quit until the 90's 12 when he did quit. and apparently he used the patch, 13 and it took him a while, but ultimately he was able 14 to quit, and there is no reason that if he would 15 have been motivated that he could not have quit 16 earlier. 17 and why is quitting important? mr. williams 18 walked you through this already. i have a graphic 19 of it. you saw this during opening. but the point 20 here is 15 years of not smoking. so that would be 21 roughly 1980. so about the time when mr. sury 22 retired. if he would have quit smoking about the 23 time he retired his risk of smoking would have 24 dropped by eighty percent. 25 okay. that is a good segue into causation. in 1 a case like this involving a smoker who ends up with 2 a mass in their lung and the question is is that a 3 lung cancer that is caused by smoking. and the key 4 here is when you say lung cancer it is sort of a 5 misnomer, because a cancer in the lung is lung 6 cancer, but the lung cancer can start somewhere 7 else. it can start in the pancreas, it can start 8 anywhere else, and we will get to the relevance of 9 that in a minute. 10 but walking in -- walking into this lawsuit 11 before you heard any evidence what would you have 12 expected to see? medical records, death 13 certificates, x-rays, radiology, all these things. 14 you would have expected to see -- you would have 15 expected to see a treating physician or some expert 16 walk in with a load of medical records and show you 17 x-rays and ct's, and here it is, you can see it 18 here. you see that there is nothing else, no other 19 tumors in the liver, or pancreas, or anything like 20 that. 21 we do not have that here. the records were 22 destroyed. we are not saying dr. sury destroyed the 23 records. the records were destroyed. we tried our 24 best, and i'm sure plaintiff's counsel tried their 25 best to get the records, but they are just not here. 1 all we have are two medical records, one which 2 is the pathology report which you have seen, the other 3 is basically another pathology report which i think 4 says about the same thing. then we have the death 5 certificate, but we know that the death certificate 6 has errors in it. 7 but most importantly we have pathology. we 8 have the actual slides of mr. sury's tumor that 9 experts can look at, pathologists can look at to see 10 what it looks like. does this look like something 11 that started in the lung? does this look like 12 something that may be metastasized to the lung? 13 okay. so what is plaintiff's evidence on 14 medical causation? their first witness was dr. alan 15 marks. he is the one that filled out the death 16 certificate. and he agreed -- he was not the one 17 who treated mr. sury. the one who treated mr. 18 sury -- if you recall, the last person, the last 19 video that we played in our case, dr. gaddis, the 20 one who basically said, i do not have any records, i 21 do not have any recollection of this person, and i 22 cannot tell you what caused his lung cancer, that was 23 mr. sury's treating oncologist. that was the person 24 who treated his cancer, and he had no recollection 25 of him. 1 dr. alan marks was dr. gaddis' medical partner. 2 dr. gaddis was apparently out of the office that 3 day. they got the call. he had never met bill 4 sury, he would never treated bill sury. he did not 5 review the pathology. he said, i assume i looked, 6 because that was his practice, at the records, maybe 7 five pages of records for five minutes. 8 and we know there are errors on the death 9 certificate. we know that it says that there was 10 five or six months from diagnosis to death, and we 11 know that that is wrong because it is 15 or 16 months. 12 we know that it says squamous cell ling cancer, and 13 we know that is wrong, because the pathology 14 report -- the only thing we have about the 15 pathology -- says undifferentiated, or poorly 16 differentiated carcinoma with squamous cell 17 features, which does not mean squamous cell 18 carcinoma. and i'll get to the importance of that 19 in a minute. 20 who was the second expert that opined on 21 causation? it was actually dr. sury's personal 22 physician. he was the one who actually -- when mr. 23 sury started getting weak dr. sury took him in, did 24 a chest x-ray, apparently dr. grochmal recalled from 25 14 years ago the size of the tumor that was on this 1 x-ray. but again he did not treat mr. sury's cancer. 2 he saw that and felt is was suspicious and he sent 3 him to a pathologist to get diagnosed for lung 4 cancer, because that is what pathologists do. he is 5 not a pathologist, he is not an oncologist. 6 again with these videos it is hard to tell, but 7 after he said, well, it is my opinion that this is a 8 primary lung cancer that started in the lung and it 9 was caused by smoking, immediately after that he 10 admitted that he is not an expert in carcinogenesis, 11 which is an expert in cancer causation. 12 so we brought you dr. stonesifer, and dr. 13 stonesifer said bill sury had adenocarcinoma, not 14 squamous cell carcinoma. ms. shamp sort of called 15 into question his credentials. dr. stonesifer has 16 been a pathologist for 26 years. he is board 17 certified, he was the former hospital chief of 18 staff. he showed you what he saw, the signet cell 19 rings and the other features to show that it was 20 adenocarcinoma, it was not squamous cell carcinoma. 21 and the importance there is adenocarcinoma can 22 start in a lot of different places, in the stomach, 23 in the pancreas, in the colon, gi tract, prostate. 24 those are all adenocarcinomas. 25 and the lung, more than -- just because you 1 have a tumor in your lung does not mean that it 2 started there. and in fact the research shows that 3 more than half of the cancers that end up in the 4 lung started somewhere else. 5 the problem is we did not have the medical 6 records. we did not have other ct scans, we did not 7 have anything else to go back and figure it out. 8 all we had were one or two medical records and a -- 9 and a death certificate that we know is faulty. 10 but again, the pathology, other than two 11 medical records, other than a death certificate that 12 we know is wrong, the most critical evidence in this 13 case of what caused mr. sury's cancer, what type of 14 tumor it was, was the pathology. 15 would not you have expected plaintiff's counsel 16 to bring in a pathologist? they took dr. 17 stonesifer's deposition. they knew he was going to 18 come in and say it was adenocarcinoma. why did not 19 they call a pathologist? ask yourself that. well, 20 they may say because it is a red herring because both 21 of them are linked to smoking. but again 22 adenocarcinomas start in a lot of different places 23 and they spread to the lung. 24 the burden of proof is on the plaintiff, and 25 they did not even bring a pathologist. 4679 1 okay. responsibility. who -- who was in the 2 best position? who is responsible? you know, in 3 this country -- we talked about the greatest 4 generation in opening statements. we talked about 5 how -- i think i said dan rather, but i think it is 6 actually tom brokaw who coined it the greatest 7 generation. 8 you know, mr. sury, like i said, born in 1919. 9 i mean, he saw the entire cold war beginning and 10 end. he saw the fall of the soviet union in his 11 lifetime, lived through the depression. he was a 12 member of the greatest generation. 13 well, who was another member of the greatest 14 generation? harry reasoner. here's what he had to 15 say. 16 (video clip played and interpreted by the 17 reporter as follows.) 18 in this kind of a country it comes down to you, 19 whether you like it or not. no one is going to 20 forbid an adult to smoke, and it is now quite clear 21 that no one is going to tell him it is good for him 22 either. the decision is his. the decision and the 23 health that may depend on it. this is harry 24 reasoner. goodnight. 25 (video clip concluded.) 1 and that pretty well sums it up. that is how 2 the greatest generation looked at this issue. no 3 one is going to tell you you cannot smoke. it is your 4 choice to smoke, but smoking comes with health 5 risks. 6 now i want to walk through the verdict form a 7 little bit. mr. williams did it some, but i wanted 8 to put these slides up here. 9 we have spoken about this first question. if 10 you answer no to the first question then you are 11 done. if you answer yes then you go on. so let us 12 look at the first question first. 13 the first question actually has three different 14 parts like mr. williams told you. this is the first 15 part. basically it is was mr. sury addicted. and in 16 this case you had dr. giakas on the one hand, you 17 had dr. frazier on the other hand, and you have 18 common sense. i'm sure you have opinions on whether 19 you believe he was addicted or not addicted, and so 20 i'm going to leave it with you. 21 let us go to the second part of the first 22 question, because even if mr. sury is addicted -- 23 again we know even addicted smokers can quit 24 smoking. so the question is, if so, if he was 25 addicted was cigarette smoking because of such 1 addiction a legal cause. so the question there is, 2 this idea of legal cause, and you will see in the 3 instruction that legal cause requires a direct 4 connection, a substantial impact. direct 5 connection, substantial impact. 6 now, when you think about this you also need to 7 think about the fact that plaintiff, plaintiff 8 counsel has admitted responsibility in this case. 9 admitted some responsibility. and you need to think 10 about what that means. that means -- it has to mean 11 that mr. sury was aware of the health risks and that 12 he was able to quit smoking earlier than he did, 13 because otherwise, if mr. sury was not aware of the 14 health risks of smoking, or if he was not able to 15 quit early enough to avoid his illness then why 16 admit any fault whatsoever? 17 if he was too addicted to quit and unable to 18 quit, if he was ignorant of the health risks, then 19 why would he be at fault at all? so the fact that 20 they are admitting that tells you that he has 21 responsibility, he was aware, and he could have quit 22 earlier. 23 now, direct connection and substantial impact. 24 what does that mean? that means that the plaintiff 25 has to prove that mr. sury's addiction was so 1 strong, that it was so powerful that it basically 2 overcame his freewill. basically overcame his 3 freewill. he could not stop earlier. if he could 4 have stopped earlier then there is no legal cause. 5 okay. let us go on to the third part, basically 6 medical causation. if you find that plaintiff did 7 not meet their burden of proof on medical causation 8 because of the lack of the medical records, 9 questions about the pathology, then the answer is 10 no. 11 so again three-part question. there is three 12 parts to this. plaintiff has the burden on each 13 part. each of these words has meaning. you can 14 tell this is carefully crafted. each word has 15 meaning. plaintiff has to prove all three parts. 16 so plaintiff has to convince each of you on each of 17 the three parts. 18 if any of you disagree with any one part, if 19 any of you disagree with any one part, or if all -- 20 if you disagree, but for different reasons, maybe 21 two of you think, i do not think he was addicted, 22 maybe two of you think, i think he probably was 23 addicted, but, you know, i think he could have quit, 24 and i think he could have quit earlier, and two 25 others might think, you know, i do not think they met 1 their burden of proof on medical causation, 2 that is -- that is no. you do not all have to agree 3 for the same reason. 4 now, we would submit and suggest that the 5 answer here is no. and just shorthand it and let 6 you know where i'm going, for a defense verdict it is 7 essentially no to everything. you do not necessarily 8 have to get there, but all the questions for the 9 plaintiff are yes, all the answers for the 10 defendants are no. 11 we believe you should check no to question 1. 12 that would end the lawsuit right now. 13 now, if you check yes you are not done. if you 14 check yes then you go on to questions 2 through 6, 15 which are liability, legal liability. 16 you heard the negligence and strict liability, 17 and that is questions 2 and 3, whether lorillard -- 18 and i put lorillard up here. obviously there is one 19 for reynolds as well. and obviously you need to 20 weigh evidence differently against both companies. 21 there is two different boxes to check, and you weigh 22 the evidence separately for both companies. and 23 this is where the findings come into play that the 24 judge read you and that ms. shamp has read you a few 25 times. 1 but you understand that the findings do not 2 establish liability. the findings were generic 3 findings. this is bill sury's case. and the 4 plaintiff still has the burden to prove whether 5 lorillard's negligence was a legal cause of mr. 6 sury's death. and again it is the same legal cause. 7 it is direct and substantial. was lorillard's 8 negligence a direct and substantial cause of william 9 sury's death? 10 so when you think about this think about press 11 releases. you remember the press release that ms. 12 shamp read to you. i suspect you are going to see 13 more tobacco company public statements in her next 14 section, her next portion. ask yourself, did mr. 15 sury hear those? did mr. -- did anybody hear those? 16 i mean, if it is a press release, press releases 17 do not necessarily mean that they get published and 18 picked up by anyone. if you have a tobacco 19 institute pamphlet there is no evidence that mr. sury 20 was on the tobacco institute mailing list to get 21 those things. ask yourself, is there evidence that 22 he ever saw it, that he ever did anything after 23 reading it that made him not quit earlier or make 24 him not stop smoking. and if you find the answer is 25 no, the answer is no on question 2. 1 question 3 i'm going to skip over because it is 2 the same concept, but it is whether the defective and 3 unreasonably dangerous cigarettes were a legal 4 cause. and there again i think you have been 5 instructed that you cannot hold the companies liable 6 for the mere sale of cigarettes. you have to link 7 up -- plaintiff's counsel has to link up a defect to 8 the injury. 9 okay. so let us go on. 4 and 5 really are 10 together, and with 4 and 5 if you check no, even if 11 you check yes for 2 and 3, if you check no for 4 and 12 5 then there should be no punitive damages because 13 the judge instructed you that you cannot get 14 punitive damages just on the negligence and the 15 strict liability questions. 16 but again fraudulent concealment, these two, 17 concealment and conspiracy really go together. 18 again legal cause. legal cause is a requirement for 19 each of these elements in the verdict form. and 20 again this -- and you will see in the instructions, 21 this requires reliance. this requires reliance, 22 reasonable reliance on behalf of mr. sury. 23 so again, did he see it? was he looking for 24 information from the tobacco institute or the 25 council for tobacco research, or lorillard, 1 reynolds, or any other tobacco company for 2 information that he needed before he was going to 3 decide, okay, i'm going to quit? and if your answer 4 is no -- if your answer is no, then the answer is no 5 here, because there is no reliance. if he is not 6 relying on information from the companies, waiting 7 for information from the companies to make his 8 decision about smoking the answer here is no. 9 okay. let us move on comparative fault. we 10 would submit that you should not ever -- you should 11 get here. either you answer no to question 1 or you 12 answer no to questions 2 through 6 -- 2 through 5. 13 but if you get to question 6 on comparative fault, 14 again legal cause. plaintiff has already admitted 15 responsibility, admits that he was aware and that he 16 could quit. 17 plaintiff starts off -- because the burden of 18 proof is on the plaintiff, plaintiff starts off with 19 one hundred percent of the fault. so even if you answered 20 yes to everything above, you still get comparative 21 fault, and plaintiff has to prove each and every 22 percent that they want to move from them to the 23 defense. and again you have separate lines for r.j. 24 reynolds and separate lines for lorillard tobacco. 25 mr. williams mentioned maybe one way you can 1 think about that is unclear smoking history, or 2 things like that. i'm sure there are a number of 3 different ways you can look at it. if you get there 4 i leave it in your sound discretion on how you 5 define -- or how you divide up the fault among the 6 three. you are the jury. that is your sound 7 discretion. i would submit to you that one hundred percent 8 fault to william sury. 9 and i'll say this. i do not like fault. i 10 do not think mr. sury was at fault for smoking. 11 okay. understand that. comparative fault is how 12 it is termed under the law. but i mean if you want 13 to look at this in terms of responsibility and who 14 is responsible, that is the same thing. but i do not 15 want you to walk out of here thinking that i'm 16 blaming mr. sury for smoking. i think that was his 17 choice. i think that is a choice that we all have. 18 i think in this country we have freedom of choice, 19 and freedom of choice brings responsibility. and i 20 think the greatest generation believed in that. but 21 at the end of the day again this is your decision. 22 okay. damages. and again understand we are not 23 -- this is not about valuing mr. sury's life, bill 24 sury's life. that is not what this is about. 25 frankly, that is impossible to do. but what you need 1 to understand here are the damages being sought. so 2 for example, they are not seeking damages for lost 3 medical expenses, what they had to pay for medical, 4 what they had to pay for funeral expenses, and 5 things like that, lost wages. that is not being 6 sought here. the only thing being sought is the 7 loss of parental companionship, instruction and 8 guidance, and for any pain and suffering dr. sury 9 may have felt due to the loss of his father. it is 10 not any pain and suffering that mr. bill sury may 11 have felt. it is what dr. sury felt. 12 and again you remember even back in voir dire 13 and then i think in the judge's instructions here 14 the only thing you can consider, the only evidence 15 you can consider is when dr. sury was on the stand 16 and when he was testifying about the losses that he 17 felt with his father's death, that is -- that is the 18 evidence, that is what you have to -- that is what you 19 would have to consider, and really nothing else. 20 now, i expect after i sit down that ms. shamp 21 is going to get up and she is going to ask for a lot 22 of money. i would expect that she is going to ask 23 for maybe a million dollars. she may ask for 24 multiple millions. i do not know. we believe that 25 the damages -- again, burden of proof is on the 1 plaintiff. we believe that the damages should be 2 zero. 3 look, i understand that a lot of you may not 4 agree with that. so let me suggest to you that if 5 ms. shamp stands up and she asks for damages in this 6 case on this record in the millions of dollars, i 7 would suggest to you that a more fair and reasonable 8 amount would be in the thousands. i mean, not like 9 five or six thousands, but not the millions, in the 10 thousands. i think that would be fair, i think that 11 would be reasonable. 12 again, i do not think you should get here. this 13 is a hard subject to talk about, but on this record 14 respectfully i think the damages are not in the 15 millions, they are in the thousands. 16 let us move to question 8, punitive damages. 17 and i suspect that ms. shamp is going to spend a 18 fair amount of time of her remaining time on 19 punitive damages. but what you need to know about 20 punitive damages are that you cannot use the 21 findings on punitive damages. so those findings, 22 they are completely irrelevant when it comes to 23 punitive damages. punitive damages have to be 24 proved, and the burden is on the plaintiff to prove 25 them based on only what you saw in the courtroom 1 from the plaintiff and from the defense in terms of 2 entitlement. and you will see here the burden, by 3 clear and convincing evidence it is a higher burden. 4 it is not the criminal burden, it is not beyond a 5 reasonable doubt, but it is a higher burden than -- 6 and i think you are going to have the instructions 7 back with you and you will be able to see that. 8 but basically punitive damages requires 9 reckless disregard to life, conscious indifference 10 to smokers. reckless disregard or conscious 11 indifference. 12 now, i think mr. williams stood up -- and we 13 agree that these companies are not perfect. did 14 they hold on to some ideas too long? in 20/20 15 hindsight, probably. did people have some stupid 16 ideas in documents in the past? probably. but at 17 the end of the day did it have an impact, was it a 18 legal cause, did it cause mr. sury to smoke or to 19 not quit earlier? 20 i want you to consider some of the things that 21 were in evidence. again this was ed robinson, the 22 lorillard company's scientist, in his deposition 23 some of this may have just gone right by you because 24 it is a pretty dry presentation. you can tell he is 25 not an expert witness, his job is to do science. 1 but again some of the things that lorillard has done 2 over the years i would submit to you do not amount 3 to conscious indifference, reckless disregard. 4 you have heard about the tobacco working group. 5 one of their key members was lorillard's dr. spears. 6 now, i'm sure you are probably going to see some 7 documents from dr. spears where he was critical of 8 the council for tobacco research. and that was his 9 opinion, but it is what it is. but he did good work 10 with the tobacco working group trying to come up 11 with a less hazardous cigarette. 12 going back to the 1940's lorillard was doing 13 cooperative research with ohio state university to 14 try to research what was in tobacco smoke. the 50's 15 and 60's, you remember dr. wynder, dr. wynder of 16 wynder and graham, the mouse skin painting studies, 17 also did epidemiology studies. lorillard actually 18 worked with wynder and hoffman, dietrich hoffman, 19 another public health researcher, actually would 20 work with them to give them tar from their 21 cigarettes so that they could go do research. they 22 were trying to do research again to come up with a 23 less hazardous cigarette. 24 you have seen the '63 lorillard submission to the 25 surgeon general's advisory committee dealing with 1 cigarette filtration. and then even today lorillard 2 is working with the institute of medicine. and the 3 institute of medicine lorillard is working with on 4 potentially reduced exposure products. 5 mr. williams was talking about the eclipse 6 product that heats rather than burns tobacco. 7 that is an example. they call prep, potentially 8 reduced exposure products. 9 again, the company was not perfect. people 10 are not perfect. companies are not perfect. but i 11 submit to you on this record you have no nicotine 12 manipulation, trying -- not perfect, but trying to 13 do the right thing, trying to come up with a less 14 hazardous cigarette, shows that there was not 15 conscious indifference to smokers. 16 now, i'm about to sit down, and as you know, 17 ms. shamp, who is smiling pretty big, she gets to go 18 last, and so obviously we cannot respond to what she 19 has to say. all i ask of you is if you see a 20 document, and if it really bothers you, we cannot 21 respond to it, if you want to write it down, if you 22 want to go back and look at it, please read the 23 whole thing before you make any judgments about it. 24 ask yourself -- somebody -- maybe somebody back in 25 the -- back in the jury room after it is all said and 1 done be -- play the devil's advocate, what would mr. 2 williams or what would i have said in response to 3 what ms. shamp is saying, because we will sit down, we 4 cannot say anything. 5 i really do thank you for your attention, you 6 guys. you have been on time, you have been incredibly 7 attentive, you know, even through videos that are not 8 the most exciting thing to watch. 9 the case boils down to this. was bill sury 10 robbed of has freewill by nicotine? i mean, was he 11 a victim of the tobacco companies? or was he 12 intelligent, hardworking, successful, a man who made 13 his own decisions, a man who accepted the 14 consequences of his decisions? because really 15 that is what i think the case boils down to. 16 ms. shamp is going next, and thank you for your 17 time.
