14 good morning, ladies and gentlemen. first, i 15 want to thank you for your attention. i know you have 16 been paying close attention and there is been a lot 17 of evidence in this case and i see that you have been 18 taking notes and i appreciate that. 19 this is my closing argument so let me begin as 20 i began in my opening argument, let me take you 21 back. this is a case about bill sury. you have 22 heard the evidence now. you know bill sury was a 23 good man. he was married for 50 years to a girl he 24 met on a beach in florida. in 1941 he went to war 25 when our country did and served in the pacific. 1 when he came home after he would married his wife, he 2 went to work for the prudential where he worked for 3 36 years starting in the mailroom and eventually 4 becoming an underwriter. 5 he moved to jacksonville, florida, and had a 6 son whom he raised with compassion and gentleness 7 who became a doctor. he was a man who said, 8 goodness gracious when he hit a bad shot on the golf 9 course. he was an usher in his church. he was a 10 good man. and he smoked. 11 we know that he started smoking sometime before 12 he was 21 years old. we know that he went into the 13 military and smoked while he was in the military. 14 we know that he smoked in the '40s, in the '50s, in 15 the '60s, in the '70s and the '80s. and we know 16 that in the 1990s he was able to finally quit 17 smoking with the help of a patch. 18 ladies and gentlemen, this case is about bill 19 sury. in 1996 he was diagnosed with lung cancer. 20 he battled it. it finally spread to his brain, and 21 in may of 1997 he died of that lung cancer. 22 this case is about bill sury but it is also 23 about the companies -- i'm sorry -- that made the 24 cigarettes that he smoked decade after decade. it is 25 about those companies and what they told him and 1 what they did not tell him. it is about what they 2 knew, what they disclosed, what they did. their 3 stories are intertwined, inexplicably intertwined, 4 inexplicably intertwined, and it is the story of 5 both. 6 now, this is my closing argument and i'm not 7 going to spend my time retelling you all of the 8 evidence that you have heard over the last three 9 weeks. i do not want to do that. and i've been 10 thinking how can i present this evidence to you in 11 my closing argument in a way that makes sense. and 12 i think the best way and the way i've decided to do 13 it is to actually look at the things that you are 14 going to be called upon to decide in the verdict 15 form. and the judge told you about those today. 16 the first issue that you are going to be asked 17 to decide and the judge just discussed it with you 18 was whether bill sury is a member of the engle 19 class. it is called class membership. and it is very 20 simple and straightforward in this case. the judge 21 has instructed you, and you will have those 22 instructions, of what it takes to be a member of the 23 engle class. 24 to prove william sury was a member of the engle 25 class, plaintiff must prove by a greater weight of 1 the evidence that william sury was addicted to 2 cigarettes containing nicotine, and, if so, that 3 cigarette smoking because of such addiction was a 4 legal cause of his lung cancer. 5 if he is a member of the engle class, he is 6 entitled to the benefits of all of these engle 7 findings that the judge just instructed you about. 8 so we will talk about those in a minute but let us turn 9 right now to talking about what is going to be the 10 very first question on the verdict form, which is 11 the class membership question. 12 question number 1 on the verdict form that 13 you will have with you, it looks just like this, is: 14 was william sury addicted to cigarettes containing 15 nicotine -- 16 i'm sorry, i have a person down. 17 ms. bryan: there was a power boost. 18 ms. shamp: just one moment. i'm sorry. thank 19 you. 20 was william sury addicted to cigarettes 21 containing nicotine, and, if so, was cigarette 22 smoking because of such addiction a legal cause of 23 his cancer? 24 so how i'm going to start today is to talk to 25 you about what the evidence is with respect to that 1 issue. 2 now, first, i want to talk a moment about 3 burden of proof because what it says in here is that 4 plaintiff must prove by a greater weight of the 5 evidence -- and that is called the burden of proof, 6 and what it means is simply as it sounds, the 7 greater weight must be on the side that you decide 8 for. and since we are in a courtroom i like to use 9 the scales of justice. if you put all the evidence 10 on one side of the issue on this side of scales and 11 the evidence in the other, you have to decide where 12 the weight is. it is not a criminal case, it does not 13 have to be beyond a reasonable doubt, but simply the 14 greater weight of the evidence. where does the 15 greater weight of the evidence fall. 16 so let us talk about what the evidence is with 17 respect to the issue of addiction. 18 what did we learn about nicotine and addiction? 19 most of it is absolutely undisputed in this case. 20 what we learned is that nicotine is addictive. 21 every witness who came in here testified as to that. 22 all the documents that we put in said that. 23 nicotine is addictive. there is no question about 24 that. 25 and nicotine changes the brain. and you will 1 remember dr. frazier talking about how it changes 2 the brain and how it releases -- nicotine releases 3 dopamine into the brain and then that dopamine 4 changes the control center of the brain. i thought 5 this was a fascinating piece of testimony because 6 lots of things we do release dopamine. we eat, it 7 releases dopamine; we do something pleasurable, we 8 play golf, it releases dopamine. but those things 9 do not change our brain the way a drug does. and 10 nicotine changes the control center of the brain. 11 and you will remember she put up this slide and 12 she talked about how they can actually look through 13 pet scans at the nicotine action on the control 14 center of the brain. and nicotine actually hi-jacks 15 the brain into thinking that that substance is 16 important for survival because the control center of 17 the brain controls those things we do in order to 18 survive, and that is why somebody who is addicted -- 19 who is addicted is unable to do the things they nor- 20 -- you can normally do, like control the behavior in 21 the same way because that drive is not just a matter 22 of what you want to do or choose to do, it is a brain 23 chemistry that is compelling you to do this. 24 this is not disputed, ladies and gentlemen, 25 that nicotine does this to the brain. and you will 1 have with you the 1988 surgeon general's report 2 which talks about this. it actually talks about 3 they believe there might be a genetic component to 4 it. this is an -- undisputed that nicotine makes an 5 actual physical change in the brain. 6 we also know that forty percent of smokers try and 7 quit every single year, but only 2 to 3 percent are 8 successful. this is a strong addiction. this is 9 not disputed by anybody in this case. you will 10 remember dr. burns came in and testified about that. 11 and you will also remember it is in the surgeon 12 general's report in 1988. forty percent try to quit 13 every year but only 2 to 3 percent are successful. 14 it is a strong addiction, as dr. frazier said, 15 similar to heroin and cocaine in the way it affects 16 the brain and causes that draw. 17 we also know that the longer you smoke and the 18 more you smoke, the greater the likelihood is of 19 being addicted. that is undisputed and that is in the 20 surgeon general's report, too. people who smoke 21 longer, people who smoke more over years, over 22 decades, have a stronger addiction and they are more 23 likely to be addicted. 24 we also learned -- i thought this was a 25 fascinating part of the evidence -- that addicted 1 smokers need a specific dose of nicotine every day 2 and that is why -- and i always wondered this, why is 3 it that when you ask somebody how much they smoke, 4 they generally can tell you what they smoke every 5 day. i smoke a pack a day, a pack and a half a day, 6 two packs a day, a half a pack a day. we learn 7 that is because the dosage is a dosage of nicotine 8 that they need to get in order to satisfy the 9 nicotine receptors in their brain every day. we have 10 got a slide about that, y'all remember dr. frazier 11 talking about how when you smoke the nicotine, it 12 fills up these nicotine receptors in the brain and 13 that tells you, okay, i'm satiated now and as time 14 goes by, after you have stopped smoking, those 15 nicotinic receptors get empty and the brain tells 16 you to fill them up again, and that is why there is a 17 specific dose every day that people smoke. 18 so the next question. was bill sury addicted? 19 what is the evidence we have of that? we know how 20 much he smoked. he smoked a pack and a half every 21 day for over 30 years, every day. that is not 22 disputed. the amount he smoked, a pack and a half a 23 day every day for 30 years, and we have that from 24 his son, dr. sury, who testified. we also have it 25 from his golfing buddies about how much he smoked. 1 he smoked a lot. 2 we also know how often he smoked, his smoking 3 habits. he smoked first thing in the morning, as 4 soon as he got up. you will remember that testimony, 5 he had a bathrobe on and he would come out of room, his 6 bedroom with a cigarette in his mouth. first thing 7 in the morning as soon as he got up he smoked. 8 we know he smoked throughout the day. he 9 smoked in his office, we saw the picture of him at 10 his desk with his ashtray next to him, you will 11 remember the testimony from rob sury when he would 12 go see him as a child that he smoked there in the 13 bullpen and then all the co-workers around him 14 smoked. he smoked throughout the day. 15 we also know that he smoked in the evening when 16 he came home, sat in his easy chair, watching 17 television. 18 we even know that he smoked at night. that he 19 sometimes would wake up from his sleep and smoke. 20 remember the testimony from rob sury when they would 21 go on vacations and they would be staying in the 22 same room in the hotel and he could see the light 23 from the end of the cigarette of his dad waking up 24 in the middle of the night to have a cigarette. 25 we also know he smoked on the golf course. 1 you will remember nancy montgomery testified he smoked 2 a cigarette every hole and then he would smoke more 3 af- -- during lunch and more when they played pool 4 afterwards. so we have evidence of how much he 5 smoked over how long a time. 6 we also know that he made multiple attempts to 7 quit smoking. you will remember the testimony from 8 dr. sury that he would make a new year's resolution 9 to put it down and then he would go around the house 10 and throw away all the ashtrays and throw away the 11 cigarettes and he wanted to stop then and put 12 everything out of his mind but was not able to 13 succeed. 14 and i thought it was a poignant story that dr. 15 sury told when he remembered as a child going out to 16 the garage and seeing his father who had attempted 17 to stop in the corner of the garage smoking 18 cigarettes. 19 and we also know that he was finally able to 20 quit in 1995 but only with the help of the patch. 21 and we know the patch was not available in -- until 22 1991, the end of 1991, and he started using it in 23 1992. so we know that the patch, which gives him a 24 dose of nicotine, was what he needed in order to cut 25 down and finally be able to stop. 1 so we have this evidence as to how bill sury 2 smoked and that he was addicted. 3 so we called to the stand dr. sandra frazier to 4 talk about what this means with respect to 5 addiction. and you will remember dr. frazier who came 6 in and testified, and dr. frazier was an addiction 7 specialist. you will remember, she had board 8 certification in addiction medicine. it was her 9 specialty. and she worked at an addiction clinic 10 and she helped other healthcare providers deal with 11 their substance abuse problems. she is an addiction 12 specialist. and she testified that bill sury was 13 addicted. 14 and her testimony was based on the amount he 15 smoked, how he smoked, first thing in the morning, 16 during the day, and her knowledge of nicotine 17 dependence and brain structure, she said there was 18 absolutely no question in her mind that bill sury 19 was addicted to cigarettes. 20 and she also showed us the interesting tool she 21 used, which was the dsm-iv, and you will remember her 22 talking about that and it is a gray book that we put 23 up there and she said there is seven things, seven 24 criteria, and if you meet three of the seven, then 25 you can be diagnosed as addicted. she said he met 1 six of the seven criteria, that is why i've got 2 checks up here. 3 you will remember the criteria of tolerance 4 meaning that over time when he first started he 5 could not have smoked a pack and a half a day because 6 that is actually a toxic amount. so he met the 7 criterion of tolerance, meaning he adapted and was 8 able to smoke a pack and a half. 9 he had withdrawal symptoms or he smoked in 10 order to avoid withdrawal symptoms. and that 11 testimony came about him smoking first thing in the 12 morning, that that is a characteristic of someone 13 who is fighting off that withdrawal system by having 14 your cigarette as soon as you wake up. and you 15 remember she said that most smokers will tell you 16 that feels the best to them because it satisfies 17 those receptors in the brain? 18 that he smoked for longer period than he 19 intended. and she talked about his quit attempts 20 with that one. that he made efforts to control his 21 smoking but was unable to. 22 now, this one is the -- the -- i think, the 23 easiest to check off there and that is time spent. 24 and the criterion is is that if you spend a lot of 25 time in either trying to get the substance or using 1 the substance, then you meet that criteria. and 2 you will remember her talking about that if you take, 3 i think she said, 7 to 10 minutes to smoke a 4 cigarette and you multiply that by 30 cigarettes a 5 day, that is 270 minutes, which is four hours that he 6 spent, that much time, 270 minutes, every day 7 smoking. so he clearly met the time spent category 8 in there. 9 now, she said there was not information about 10 reduced activities because back then when he was 11 smoking you could do it just about everywhere. you 12 could smoke at your office. you could smoke in 13 theatres. you could smoke on airplanes. 14 but she also said he met the seventh criteria, 15 which is continued use, despite knowledge that it 16 might be causing you some physical disturbances. 17 now, the reason i actually put double checks up 18 here is because you will remember dr. giakas, the 19 defendants' addiction expert, he testified that, in 20 fact, bill sury met number 1 and number 2. even his 21 testimony is that he met number 1 and number 2. but 22 dr. giakas said that he was not addicted because he 23 did not meet any of the others. 24 dr. giakas testified that he did not meet the 25 time spent one, that using over four hours a day, in 1 his mind, did not meet the time spent. 2 we think the evidence is very clear that bill 3 sury met the dsm-iv and that he was addicted to 4 cigarettes. 5 now, i talked about the greater weight, so 6 let us talk for a minute about what the defendant put 7 up and the defendants are going to argue to you, i 8 suspect, that bill sury was not addicted to 9 cigarettes. i believe the defendants are going to 10 argue that he smoked, not because of nicotine, not 11 to get nicotine, but simply because he wanted to or 12 he liked it. 13 and what did they bring you? they brought you 14 dr. giakas to put on the other side of the scale the 15 things i just talked about. 16 dr. giakas is not an addiction specialist. 17 he is not worked in an addiction clinic. he is what i 18 would call a run-of-the-mill psychiatrist. i think 19 he said his specialty was actually in geriatrics. 20 he has no specialty in addiction. 21 and i found it almost shocking that when we 22 asked him if he had read the surgeon general's 23 report of 1988, which is the report on nicotine and 24 addiction, that he had not even read it. 25 he is not studied addiction, he is not read about 1 addiction, he is not written about addiction, he 2 does not have a degree in addiction but he came in 3 and told you that robert sury -- i mean, that bill 4 sury was not addicted to nicotine. 5 but what did he base that on? there it is. i 6 think maybe we have a faulty cord there. 7 but what did he base that on? he based it on 8 one thing, you will remember his very first slide that 9 dr. giakas put up, and he said he based the fact he 10 was not addicted because he was able to quit. he 11 said, i believe he controlled -- he could control 12 his smoking behavior because in 1995 he was able to 13 quit and so my opinion he could have quit anytime 14 because he quit in 1995. 15 now, i want to talk for a minute about that 16 because not one witness in this case, including 17 dr. giakas, has said that an addicted smoker cannot 18 quit. nobody has said that. everybody agrees that 19 addicted smokers can quit and they do quit every 20 day. just because somebody quit, does not mean that 21 they are not addicted. 22 think about his testimony. his testimony is, 23 if you quit, and we know millions have, you are not 24 addicted, right, because you can control your 25 smoking decision. so if you quit, you are not 1 addicted. 2 but if you do not quit, like he did in the '60s 3 and '70s, well, you are not addicted, you just did not 4 want to. he tries to have it both ways. he tries 5 to say that, well, if you do not quit, you are not 6 addicted because you just did not -- you were not 7 motivated enough and if you do quit, then, 8 obviously, you can quit so you were not addicted. 9 according to dr. giakas nobody's addicted to 10 nicotine. under dr. giakas's theory, no one is 11 addicted. 12 and if you remember we asked him, what do you 13 base this on that he smoked for some reason other 14 than nicotine? ms. bryan asked him that question. 15 why, if he smoked a pack and a half a day every day 16 for 30 years, would not it make more sense if he 17 was not addicted and he was not smoking for nicotine 18 that he would smoke five one day, ten one day, two packs 19 one day? he gave -- the only thing he said -- 20 whoops. the only thing he said was that he thought 21 people smoked for other reasons like -- and i 22 thought maybe it was even silly what he said. he 23 said, because they like the smell of it, because 24 they like the way their hand goes back and forth to 25 their mouth, maybe there is somebody who smokes for 1 those reasons, but what basis does he have to come 2 and give you testimony here in this courtroom that 3 that is why bill sury smoked? none. that is pure 4 speculation as to any reason other than nicotine. 5 but, ladies and gentlemen, we do not have to 6 rely upon either dr. frazier or dr. giakas because 7 the surgeon general of the united states of america 8 has talked to us about it and you will have that with 9 you. 10 now, i'm going to say right now that when i 11 talk about documents, these go back into the jury 12 room with you and just because they are up here on 13 the board does not mean they actually do not exist 14 physically, and you will have them in the jury room. 15 and we have notebooks with tabs on them, i'm told, 16 and the tabs will let you find where the document 17 is. 18 this is p-487 and you will have that document 19 back there with you. 20 and what the surgeon general of the united 21 states says is that nicotine addiction is the 22 fundamental reason that individuals persist in using 23 tobacco products. 24 we do not even have to rely on that. the 25 defendants, themselves, have talked about this very 1 issue over and over in the documents that you will 2 have back with you. i will not do all of them but i 3 will read some of them to you. 4 this is from p-302, and it says the tobacco 5 industry may be thought of as a specialized, highly 6 ritualized, and stylized segment of the 7 pharmaceutical industry. tobacco products uniquely 8 contain and deliver nicotine, a potent drug, with a 9 variety of psychological effects. happily for the 10 tobacco industry, nicotine is both habituating and 11 unique in its physiological actions. 12 p-285. it must be assumed that nicotine is the 13 sine qua non. i might have this up on the slide. 14 this is the one that says it was a potent drug. 15 nicotine is the sine qua non. that means -- it is 16 latin, it means without which it is nothing; without 17 which it is nothing. and their own documents say it 18 must be assumed that nicotine is the sine qua non of 19 smoking. 20 an rjr document, 301, in theory and probably in 21 fact a given smoker on a given day has a fixed 22 per-hour, per-day requirement for nicotine. i 23 believe that for the typical smoker nicotine 24 satisfaction is the dominant desire as opposed to 25 flavor or other satisfaction; therefore, it is the 1 primary reason smokers smoke. these are their own 2 documents. 3 lorillard document p-881, undoubtedly nicotine 4 serves the primary role in cigarette smoking. 5 lorillard document. tobacco scientists know 6 that physiological satisfaction is almost totally 7 related to nicotine intake. 8 they know that nicotine is addictive, it is a 9 powerful drug, and a person that smokes a pack and a 10 half a day for 30 years is addicted. 11 we believe that the greater weight -- the far 12 greater weight of the evidence in this case shows 13 that bill sury was addicted. 14 but that is not the only part of question 1. 15 question 1 has two parts. so i'm going to go to the 16 second part now. 17 was william sury addicted to cigarettes 18 containing nicotine and, if so, was cigarette 19 smoking because of such addiction a legal cause of 20 his death? 21 so let us talk about that. we brought in four 22 pieces of evidence that prove not only that smoking 23 caused his lung cancer but that he died as a result 24 of the lung cancer caused by smoking. we brought to 25 you dr. alan marks. and you will remember dr. marks 1 is the doctor who signed his death certificate. and 2 you will have the death certificate with you in the 3 jury room. it is p-1, our very first document, the 4 death certificate. and the death certificate says 5 that he died as a result of squamous cell cancer of 6 the lung to the brain, primary in the lung. 7 and you will remember dr. marks' testimony. it 8 was very short, he only testified, i think, 20 or 30 9 minutes, it was very short testimony, but he said 10 that he died as a result of lung cancer, that lung 11 cancer was the primary, and that his lung cancer 12 came from smoking cigarettes. that was his 13 testimony. 14 we also brought you dr. richard grochmal. now, 15 dr. richard grochmal was important for a different 16 reason because dr. grochmal, you will remember, he was 17 the primary doctor. he was the doctor that bill 18 sury first went in to see when he was weak and he 19 had gotten weak on the golf course. and what 20 dr. grochmal did, he testified, is he did a chest 21 x-ray and that he found a mass and he testified that 22 he found one lung mass, he suspected by the look of 23 it that it might be malignant and it might be 24 cancer, he found it in his lung and he sent him to a 25 pathologist -- i mean, sent him to get a biopsy. 1 there was a biopsy done of the lung tissue 2 which said it was cancerous and then he was treated 3 for that cancer of the lung. so we brought you the 4 death certificate and we also brought you the 5 pathology report. and this is the report that says 6 he has cancer of the lung. 7 you will remember that when dr. -- when 8 dr. grochmal testified, he said it was a large 9 tumor. he said it was four-by-six centimeters and 10 that is in inches, i believe, about an 11 inch-and-a-half-by-two-and-a-half inches. that is a 12 large tumor in the lung. and that is important 13 because as dr. sury told you, they told him then it 14 was inoperable. they could not operate to try and 15 save him, to try and save him. it was at that point 16 inoperable. so they gave him radiation treatment 17 but they did not operate. and that helped. the 18 testimony was that it helped but then it eventually 19 spread to his brain. 20 we believe that is sufficient evidence to find 21 he died from lung cancer as a result of smoking, two 22 witnesses, both -- the one who signed the death 23 certificate who said smoking caused this lung cancer 24 and the doctor who diagnosed him, to send him to -- 25 got a chest x-ray and saw this chest x-ray showed a 1 mass, and got the pathology. both of them said that 2 he had lung cancer as a result of smoking. two 3 doctors who came in who, one, saw him, and the other 4 who saw the medical records. 5 you will remember dr. marks said he looked at the 6 medical records when he was making out the death 7 certificate. he looked at the medical records he 8 had in front of him. 9 now, the defendants are going to come in and 10 argue that he did not die from lung cancer. and they 11 brought to you dr. stonesifer. i like 12 dr. stonesifer, but they brought in dr. stonesifer 13 who gave a very interesting lecture about 14 adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma and 15 had the pictures. you will remember, he talked about 16 the water bottle being a sweat gland. that is a 17 complete red herring to anything you have to 18 decide -- everybody does not use the word red 19 herring, but it means something to throw you off the 20 scent. it is something that does not have anything to 21 do with anything. 22 he said he thought it was the adenocarcinoma 23 instead of squamous cell carcinoma. i guess that is 24 something pathologists might disagree about, whether 25 it was a squamous or whether it was adeno. and he 1 looked at the things, and he was very knowledgeable 2 about it, i do not deny, maybe it had some 3 adenocarcinoma features about it but so what? 4 because when ms. bryan got up to cross-examine him, 5 he said both adeno and squamous cell were lung 6 cancers, squamous cell and adenocarcinoma are both 7 lung cancers, okay? 8 okay. both adeno and squamous cell can be 9 primary lung cancers. okay. she asked him the 10 third question, can both adeno and squamous cell be 11 caused by smoking? yes, they both are. the fact 12 that it was adeno versus squamous cell carcinoma 13 makes absolutely no difference in this case. it is 14 lung cancer caused by smoking. 15 now, i think the suggestion that they were 16 trying to make was that it could not -- it might 17 have come from somewhere else in his body and it not 18 be a lung cancer but be a spread, a spread from 19 somewhere else in his body, right? and we know that 20 can happen. you can have a cancer in your stomach 21 or in your kidney or your pancreas and it can spread 22 to your lung or your brain or somewhere else. so he 23 was trying to suggest that this was not a primary 24 tumor as both dr. marks said and dr. grochmal said 25 but it came from somewhere else. 1 well, dr. stonesifer, as he testified, said, i 2 cannot tell if it was primary to the lung or 3 somewhere else just looking at this little bitty 4 slide because that is all he had. that is all he had 5 to testify about was the little slide. 6 and we do not deny that if you hand somebody a 7 slide, that you might not be able to tell by looking 8 at that slide whether it was cancer starting in the 9 lung or starting somewhere else. but we have a lot 10 more in this case other than that little slide that 11 dr. grochmal had and dr. marks had. 12 first, we know that the tissue that he sampled 13 came from the lung. we know that from the pathology 14 report that this was lung tissue that was brought 15 up. now, when you look at the slide, you might not 16 be able to tell that, it might look all the same, 17 but we know because we have the pathology report 18 that it is lung tissue. 19 we also know that there was no other tumor 20 anywhere else in his body. there is not one shred of 21 evidence in this case that he had any other tumor 22 anywhere else in his body, none. 23 and we know importantly that this was diagnosed 24 and treated as a primary lung tumor. and you will 25 remember it was important and we talked about that 1 nowadays they are much more careful about 2 distinguishing between an adeno and a squamous cell. 3 ms. bryan went into that with the witness. because 4 treatment has changed over the 14 years. and now 5 you actually treat the adeno a little differently 6 than you treat squamous cell so now they are more 7 careful. but in 1995 they were not that careful in 8 distinguishing between the two because the treatment 9 would be the same. 10 but what they were careful about in 1994 -- i 11 mean, 1997, was knowing that it was the primary 12 tumor because that is treated differently and so the 13 doctors diagnosed it as the primary. 14 and what do we know about what they did to 15 diagnose it as the primary? well, one, we know that 16 dr. grochmal looked at the chest x-ray and there 17 were no other tumors anywhere on that. 18 we know that dr. grochmal examined his patient 19 because he said that he did. 20 but we also know from dr. stonesifer, which i 21 did not pick up on until the testimony yesterday, 22 that there are actually bone marrow slides. 23 somebody actually -- you remember that testimony? 24 he said 17 slides total but only 10 or so of them 25 are from the lung and the others are from bone 4506 1 marrow. they were searching in this man's body for 2 other tumors. they looked in the bones. they 3 looked other places. there was no other tumor and 4 there is no evidence in this case that there was any 5 other tumor. 6 but even more importantly we know from the time 7 of diagnosis, which was in january of 1996, he lived 8 for another year and a half, and no other tumor ever 9 showed up. if this came from somewhere else, if he 10 had stomach cancer or some other kind, at some point 11 in that year and a half it would have shown up. 12 the only tumor he had was the lung cancer that 13 eventually spread to his brain. no other tumor, no 14 other cancer. the argument that this was something 15 other than a primary is red herring that they are 16 trying to throw in now. it has nothing to do with 17 the facts of this case which you got from two 18 doctors who swore under oath. 19 but perhaps the most important thing here is 20 not what dr. stonesifer said but what dr. stonesifer 21 did not say. dr. stonesifer did not say that this 22 was not the primary tumor. he never said this -- he 23 could have, i guess. they could have brought in 24 somebody that said, in fact, this is actually a 25 stomach cancer, he did not say that. all he said 1 was, based on this slide, i cannot be certain it is a 2 primary. he did not say it was a stomach cancer. he 3 did not. so any argument that they make that this 4 was not the primary tumor is a pure red herring. 5 you have the evidence and the far greater 6 weight of the evidence that this was a primary lung 7 tumor caused by cigarette smoking. 8 and i want to talk just one minute about -- to 9 remind you about some testimony we heard a long time 10 ago from dr. burns about how cigarette smoking 11 causes lung cancer. you will remember these slides 12 early in the case, how the smoke actually paralyzes 13 the cilia that cleans out the lungs and that then 14 the carcinogens in the smoke can land on the lung 15 tissue and start to cause damage, start to cause 16 changes in the structure of the cells, themselves. 17 those eventually turn into metaplasia as he 18 described it and eventually a carcinoma of the lung. 19 you heard that testimony as to how it causes lung 20 cancer. 21 but you also heard him say that 85 to 95 22 percent of lung cancers are caused by smoking 23 cigarettes and almost all lung cancers in smokers 24 are caused by smoking. 25 we believe the evidence is overwhelming that 1 mr. sury was addicted to cigarettes and that -- that 2 smoking cigarettes caused his lung cancer and that 3 the answer to question number 1 is yes. 4 so now i'll move to question number 2 on the 5 verdict form. 6 well, first, so once it is determined that bill 7 sury was a member of the class, then, as the judge 8 has instructed you, plaintiff is entitled to the 9 benefits of the engle findings. so, now, these are 10 findings that the judge instructed you you must 11 accept as true: smoking cigarettes causes lung 12 cancer. nicotine in cigarettes is addictive. the 13 defendants placed cigarettes on the market that were 14 defective and unreasonably dangerous. 15 fraud by concealment. that all defendants 16 concealed or omitted material information not 17 otherwise known or available knowing that the 18 material was false or misleading, or failed to 19 disclose a material fact concerning the health 20 effects or addictive nature of smoking cigarettes or 21 both. that is already been determined that they 22 concealed or omitted important information. 23 and that they conspired. that all defendants 24 agreed to conceal or omit information regarding the 25 health effects of cigarettes or their addictive 1 nature or both with the intention, intending that 2 smokers would rely upon that information to their 3 detriment. all of the defendants were negligent. 4 and the judge has instructed you. you will have 5 these instructions back with you. these findings 6 may not be denied by the defendants. they may not 7 be questioned by the defendants. they must carry 8 the same weight they would have if you had 9 determined them yourselves. 10 so let us move forward and talk about the 11 verdict form with respect to what the next questions 12 are with the benefit of the engle findings. 13 question 2 is negligence, whether the 14 negligence was a legal cause of death. 15 and question 3, as the judge has instructed 16 you, strict liability, whether the defective and 17 unreasonably dangerous cigarettes were a legal cause 18 of william sury's death. these questions are easy 19 and they go together. 20 if you find that smoking cigarettes caused his 21 death, then the question -- the answer to question 3 22 and the answer to question 2 is yes, because that is 23 already been established that they were negligent 24 and that they placed defective cigarettes on the 25 market. so if you find, as you did with respect to 1 finding 1, that smoking cigarettes caused his death, 2 then the answer to both question 2 and question 3 is 3 yes. those are easy if you find that he died of 4 smoking cigarettes as a result -- of lung cancer as 5 a result of smoking cigarettes. 6 let us turn to questions 4 and 5. and question 7 4 and 5, i think, is where the defendants are going 8 to argue most strenuously and you have heard a lot of 9 testimony in the trial about and, that is, whether 10 what reynolds -- you have two questions, one for 11 reynolds and one for lorillard, whether their 12 concealment or omission of material fact was a legal 13 cause of william sury's death. 14 now, they obviously cannot dispute this part. 15 they cannot dispute that they concealed or omitted 16 material information. the judge instructed you 17 about that. and they cannot dispute that the 18 material information that they withheld was not 19 otherwise known, that they withheld information that 20 the public did not know. they cannot dispute that. 21 they will but the judge has instructed you that they 22 cannot dispute or question that part of the 23 findings. 24 so what is rjr and lorillard's defense to this? 25 i call it the everybody knew and bill sury knew. 1 well, there is a couple problems with their 2 defense. now, i want to mention, first, here that 3 this is not about comparative fault. this is not 4 about whether bill sury has some responsibility. we 5 get to that question later on. this question is 6 about whether they have any responsibility because 7 they denied under question 4 that they have any 8 responsibility at all because basically what they 9 argue is it did not matter if we lied, it does not 10 matter what we said, it does not matter what we did, 11 because it did not cause bill sury to keep smoking 12 because he already knew. that is their argument. 13 now, importantly, we do not have to prove that 14 they are lying, that their fraudulent concealment was 15 the only cause of his death. we have admitted he 16 bears some responsibility. all we have to prove is 17 it was a cause, a contributing factor. 18 now, as i said, they have got two problems with 19 their argument. the first problem with everybody 20 knew is the engle findings because the engle 21 findings tell you that it was not otherwise known. 22 but the other problem with their argument is they are 23 going to stand up and say everybody knew smoking was 24 bad for you, everybody knew smoking was hazardous. 25 but what they did not know is that there were known 1 carcinogens in cigarettes that they identified from 2 the early 1950s. 3 what they did not know, but they knew, was that 4 smoking filters did not make a difference because 5 people compensated by smoking them deeper, you will 6 remember that testimony. and what they did not know 7 was the addictive nature of the cigarettes, that it 8 was an addictive drug. 9 so let us talk first about the everybody knew 10 defense and you know this defense, they are going to 11 stand up here and talk about it. they will even put 12 up that dan horn quote again where he said, if you 13 shout it from the rooftops -- remember that quote 14 they put up? if you shout it from the rooftops, you 15 would not be telling anybody they did not know -- 16 anything they did not know and so it is dr. reynolds' 17 (sic) testimony, it is the newsweek articles that 18 they keep putting in, it is the new york times 19 articles. so i want to talk about this, ladies and 20 gentlemen, a piece at a time. i want to talk about 21 what they said. 22 i want to talk about what they knew and i want 23 to talk about it in the 1950s first, what they knew. 24 you are going to have with you the teague memo, which 25 is exhibit p-161 and in the teague memo it says 1 that, the studies indicate smoking causes lung 2 cancer in the 1950s. and what they said, they 3 submitted the frank statement, which is p-175, which 4 says, there is no proof that cigarette smoking is a 5 cause of lung cancer. 6 but, third, in the '50s what did people think? 7 you will have with you the document i used with 8 dr. riddell, p-217, and what it shows is people 9 thought in the 1950s -- this is a study that was 10 done in 1959, there was surprisingly little concern 11 in the 1950s about the health aspects of cigarettes. 12 what happened in the 1960s? in the 1960s they 13 knew. you will have two very important documents, 14 which are p-203 and p-233, which talk about the 15 carcinogens in their smoke, that they knew there was 16 17 known carcinogens in their smoke, 17 17 cancer-causing agents. 18 the rodgman memo says that, we know that the 19 overwhelming evidence indicts cigarette smoking as a 20 cause of lung cancer. you will have these documents 21 back there that they knew. 22 but what did they say? ready? 23 this is in 1964. well, this is what he said. 24 he said that, if we -- you will remember his 25 testimony, you will remember, and you will actually 1 have this clip back in the jury room with you so you 2 can play it, and what he says is, if there is 3 anything found in cigarettes that is harmful, and we 4 do not think there is, we will take it out. that is 5 what he said in 1964 when sitting in the files of 6 r. j. reynolds are their documents saying that we 7 know that 17 known carcinogens in our smoke. 8 and he stands up there and says to the american 9 people, if we find anything in there, we will take it 10 out. 11 but what were people thinking in the 1960s? 12 what did people think after the surgeon general's 13 report came out? well, we brought you a study and 14 the study shows that among smokers, which bill sury 15 was at that time, the question was asked, do smokers 16 live as long as -- smokers do not live as long as 17 others because they smoke? only 12 percent said 18 yes. only 12 percent thought that smokers did not 19 live as long because they smoked in the -- i think 20 this is 1968. and 61 percent said that they do not 21 believe that smokers do not live as long or they 22 do not know. 23 in the 1970s, what they knew. in 1979 a 24 surgeon general's report came out. this is p-351, 25 which you will have back with you, where it says -- 1 this document is significant for another reason. it 2 demolishes the claims made by cigarette 3 manufacturers and a few others 15 years ago and 4 today, that the scientific evidence is sketchy, that 5 no link between smoking and lung cancer was proven. 6 those claims, empty then, are utterly vacuous now. 7 1979 they clearly knew that smoking caused lung 8 cancer. 9 but what did they say. this is one of my 10 favorite documents, this is p-298. this is a press 11 release from the tobacco institute. in pursuing 12 their press conference science, some government 13 officials maintain that cigarette smoking is the 14 number one public health problem. we believe that 15 the number one problem is the extent to which these 16 officials knowingly mislead the american public. 17 but what did people think? we have shown you 18 evidence, again, from document p-931, that the 19 overall saliency, meaning the importance to the 20 american public, of the cigarette issue comparing 21 cigarette and health is low. 22 even in the 1980s, ladies and gentlemen, what 23 they were saying -- 24 a voice: we are plugged in. i do not know. 25 the court: let me tell you this. we are going 1 to need to take a break anyway. 2 ms. shamp: i might be stepping on something. 3 the court: ms. shamp, i'm going to take -- 4 ms. shamp: okay. 5 the court: -- a ten-minute break, just a 6 ten-minute break. you can go into the jury room and 7 you can use the facilities or what have you and 8 we will come on back at 20 minutes after 10. [#deleted recess#] 7 ms. shamp: thank you, your honor. 8 let me first say i apologize. it was actually 9 me stepping on something down there, so i think 10 we have prevented that for now. 11 i think where i was was we were in the 1980s. 12 we talked about what they knew, what they said, what 13 people knew from the '50s, '60s, '70s. what about 14 1980? 15 (a video clip was played and transcribed by the 16 court reporter to the best of her ability as follows:) 17 unidentified speaker: "...does not cause 18 cancer, yes or no?" 19 unidentified speaker: "it is not known whether 20 cigarettes cause cancer." 21 unidentified speaker: "all right, sir." 22 unidentified speaker: "it has not been 23 causally established." 24 (the video clip was ended.) 25 ms. shamp: in 1980 on purpose they were 1 telling the american people a lie. their own 2 documents dispute that. and on purpose they were 3 telling the american people that smoking did not 4 cause cancer. 5 but what did people know in 1980? even as late 6 as 1980, we have -- we brought you p-932, which is a 7 study that the tobacco institute did in 1980. and, 8 ladies and gentlemen, even as late as 1980 -- and 9 you will remember what they said, that non-smokers and 10 smokers thought differently about it. but in 1980, 11 smokers, only one-third, only 33 percent of them, 12 believed that smokers died sooner as a result of 13 smoking. two-thirds of them did not believe it even 14 then. 15 now, i want to talk to you about the evidence 16 they brought in on the subject of everybody knew. 17 and most of what dr. riddel said i did not agree 18 with. but there was one thing she said that i 19 caught, and i thought it was interesting. 20 you know how they put up throughout this trial 21 all those newsweek articles, those reader's digest 22 articles, all of those things which were supposed to 23 convince you that everybody knew smoking was bad for 24 you, in the '50s, in the '60s. in every one of 25 those articles dr. ridell said -- in every one of 1 them there would be a statement by the tobacco 2 industry. 3 and she put up this. i did not. but in every 4 one of them there'd be a statement by the tobacco 5 industry that says, "it is not true. has not been 6 proven. it is not the last word." 7 and it worked. not everybody, but some people 8 believed what the tobacco companies were saying. 9 let us talk about the quality of evidence they 10 brought you with respect to this notion that 11 everybody knew that smoking was hazardous. 12 they brought you dr. ridell. you all remember 13 her. she is an agricultural economist. her degree 14 was in agricultural economy. you remember that. 15 she would never written anything about tobacco until the 16 tobacco industry contacted her. 17 but where did she get her information? all of 18 the information that she testified about there was 19 handed to her by the lawyers. 20 you will remember when she talked about the 21 gallup polls. and my first question out of my mouth 22 was who was paula noble, i think her name was. it 23 was a shook hardy -- shook hardy, a law firm -- that 24 was a shook hardy research assistant. on all those 25 gallup polls, they were printed out by the lawyers 1 and given to her. 2 i asked her where she got the newsweek articles 3 that she relied upon, all of those articles. she 4 could not find them in her library -- remember 5 that? -- so shook hardy gave them to her. 6 and remember the study that she relied upon? a 7 study that was funded by jones day, the law firm 8 mr. williams works for. 9 all of the information that she stood up there, 10 an agricultural economist, told you about was handed 11 to her by their lawyers. she was not an expert. 12 she is not got independent information to bring to 13 you. 14 but most telling was that when i showed her 15 these three studies that i just talked to you about, 16 these three studies which were done for the tobacco 17 institute, which were titled "a study of public 18 attitudes toward cigarette smoking," "a study of 19 attitudes toward cigarette smoking," she said she would 20 never seen them and she did not rely on them. they 21 were unrelied on. 22 does that sound like an expert, who only looks 23 at what the lawyers give them, who does not go out 24 and do independent looking to try to find out what 25 was happening, and who is done absolutely no research 4526 1 in the area or writing in the area until she is 2 contacted and paid by the tobacco companies? 3 but it really begs the question. because the 4 question is whether anything they did kept bill sury 5 smoking, even a little bit longer. it is the cause 6 question. are those lies they told important? if 7 they kept them smoking even a little bit longer. 8 and, ladies and gentlemen, they want you to say no. 9 they want you to say, "all our lies do not matter, 10 because everybody knew." 11 they want you -- they put up here every witness 12 and asked them, "was he an intelligent man?" why 13 would they ask them whether bill sury was an 14 intelligent man? because they want you to believe 15 that, "as many lies as we told him, he was too 16 intelligent to believe them." 17 i call this the big brother defense. when i 18 was a -- i have three big brothers, and when i was a 19 kid, a little girl, one of my brothers told me the 20 meaning of a four-letter word, but he told me wrong. 21 and that day when i went to school and i repeated it 22 and got in trouble and went to the principal's 23 office, my mother called us both into the living 24 room. 25 and my brother was like, "mom, she should have 1 known better. she should have known it was not the 2 truth." 3 and my mother looked at my brother and said, 4 "shame on you. shame on you for blaming her for 5 believing you." 6 and that is stuck with me all these years. it is 7 about integrity. 8 their defense is that bill sury should not have 9 believed their lies. this is important for them. 10 it is an important defense they spent a lot of time 11 on. they spent a lot of time on it because what 12 they are telling you is, "it does not matter if we 13 lied, because it did not cause him to smoke more 14 cigarettes." what they are trying to tell you is, 15 "so what? so what if we lied? so what if we told 16 the american public in 1980 that we do not know that 17 smoking causes cancer? so what? because if it 18 did not cause bill sury to keep smoking, it makes no 19 difference." 20 and frankly, ladies and gentlemen, that is a 21 hard burden for us. it is a hard burden for us 22 because bill sury's no longer here. he is dead. and 23 anything he might have said to somebody else is 24 hearsay. we cannot bring it in. 25 it is a hard burden for us to prove that their 1 lies were a cause of him continuing to smoke. but 2 fortunately in this case we can do it. we can prove 3 that their lies made a difference, and we have got 4 evidence to prove it. 5 in 1964 we have evidence to show -- mr. sury 6 testified -- dr. sury said that when his parents saw 7 the 1964 surgeon general's report, they were 8 shocked. they were shocked by what they were 9 seeing. that at that point they did not know that. 10 that they did not know. 11 so we have that evidence, that 1964 they were 12 shocked. and then we have evidence that he switched 13 to kent. you remember that. he would been smoking 14 raleighs before that, and in the mid '60s he 15 switched to kent. 16 and you will remember testimony about what kent 17 was saying -- what lorillard was saying about kent 18 cigarettes. 19 "you can see the proof of kent's health 20 protection." this was in the 1950s. 21 "your voice of wisdom says, 'smoke kent.'" 22 your voice of wisdom's telling you. 23 1960. "all over america, more scientists and 24 educators smoke kent with the micronite filter." 25 what -- they were saying that their cigarettes 1 were safer. he switched to kent. and he was 2 smoking kent. 3 and even though you have with you -- you 4 remember the trunk document that mr. -- that 5 dr. goldberg pulled out of the trunk. and this is 6 p-930 where it says in here that they need to stop 7 saying that. 8 and you will remember the kent document. all of 9 us are aware kent was marketed as a safer cigarette. 10 this is proof that their actions did cause him to 11 keep smoking. rather than quitting, he switched to 12 kent, the safer cigarette. 13 what else do we have? what other proof do we 14 have? 15 we have the 1969 tomato ad. you remember what 16 dr. sury talked about as a child. he was 13 years 17 old, sitting at the kitchen table, and his dad saw 18 this ad and showed it to him. 19 just enough to create doubt. that is what they 20 were trying to do. just enough to keep him smoking 21 a little bit longer. 22 now, this was put out by the tobacco 23 associates, inc., which are the growers, which, as 24 you will remember, were part of the frank statement, 25 were part of the group that initially came up and 1 hired hill & knowlton to put out this effort of 2 disinformation. and this was part of their efforts. 3 and we know bill sury saw it. 4 but you do not have to take our word for it. 5 they themselves have told you that doubt is their 6 product. this is a document, p-486, and you will have 7 it back in the jury room with you, when they say, 8 "this is what we are selling, ladies and gentlemen. 9 we are selling doubt. doubt is our product, since it 10 is the best means of competing with the body of fact 11 that exists in the mind of the general public. it 12 is also the means of establishing a controversy." 13 it did make a difference. they were selling 14 doubt. bill sury bought it and kept smoking. 15 we also know that bill sury looked at the tar 16 charts. dr. sury testified that he and his dad 17 together were looking at the charts in there to try 18 and figure out what was the least dangerous 19 cigarette. and we know at that same time that they 20 knew it was not safer, that they knew that smokers -- 21 just because that thing said lower tar, that smokers 22 would smoke more to get the nicotine and have the 23 same amount of tar in their lungs. 24 bill sury did not know that, and he looked at 25 the tar charts and he switched to doral. 1 ladies and gentlemen, it is not a lot of 2 evidence that we have got, but it is enough. it is 3 enough to keep them from winning the big brother 4 defense. it is enough to keep them from arguing that 5 their lies do not matter. because in this case we 6 know that they matter. we have the proof that it 7 did cause him to keep smoking. 8 and as we said -- we will talk about comparative 9 fault later. and we do not have to prove on 10 questions 4 and 5 that it was the only cause, but if 11 their lies were a contributing cause or just a part 12 of it, you should check "yes" on 4 and 5. 13 now, they are going to make a big deal and they 14 have made a big deal throughout this case about the 15 fact that bill sury was in the insurance business 16 and he was an underwriter. but what is the evidence 17 about that issue and is it really, really relevant 18 to the question? 19 what we know -- what we know is that he was an 20 underwriter, not an actuary. and the judge actually 21 cleared that up when there was a mistake. he was an 22 underwriter, not an actuary. he did not set 23 actuarial tables. we know he was in the bullpen, 24 not an executive. and we know from dr. sury's 25 testimony that prudential did not set differential 1 rates for smokers. 2 what they have brought you is innuendo 3 suggesting -- i thought it was really interesting. 4 they tried to get that insurance evidence in all the 5 time. the judge sustained objections. they tried 6 to get it in with dr. goldberg -- 7 mr. woods: objection, your honor. 8 mr. williams: objection. 9 mr. latham: objection, your honor. 10 the court: excuse me. 11 mr. woods: sidebar about this. 12 the court: let me just say something. 13 sustained. 14 ladies and gentlemen, you do not consider 15 anytime i object or -- i mean, anytime i sustain or 16 overrule an objection. you just consider the 17 evidence that comes before you. 18 thank you. 19 ms. shamp: they did not bring in any evidence 20 about insurance rates. they did not bring in any 21 evidence from anybody. just innuendo, just 22 supposition that bill sury had any greater knowledge 23 because he was in the insurance business. 24 and they could have brought in that evidence. 25 they could have brought in somebody who would have 1 sat up on the stand and given insurance testimony 2 and said, "now, we knew back then insurance rates 3 were set differently" -- they did not bring in 4 anything. they want to bring it in through 5 innuendo. but the innuendo proves that in fact he is 6 looking at the tomato ad in 1969. 7 the only evidence they have is from dr. sury, 8 when he was a child, when he was 13 years old, going 9 in and looking at his dad's books. and you will 10 remember what he said about that, that in his dad's 11 books that there were optional points that could be 12 awarded for clean living, for somebody who did not 13 smoke, did not drink; that clean living you could 14 give an extra bonus point for. 15 that is the only evidence in this case that bill 16 sury knew the risks. and that is up against what our 17 testimony -- the actual testimony of what he did, 18 how he expressed shock, how he switched to kents, 19 and how he looked at the tar charts and to select a 20 cigarette that was lower in tar. 21 one thing i'm going to ask you to do is when 22 mr. williams is up here talking, ask yourself, "is 23 that the big brother defense? is that the defense 24 that our lies do not matter because bill sury was 25 intelligent and he should have known?" 1 we think the evidence shows they should not get 2 away with the big brother defense, that the weight 3 of evidence, that the greater weight of the evidence 4 shows that question number 4, whether rjr's 5 fraudulent concealment or omission of a material 6 fact about the health effects or addictive nature of 7 smoking cigarettes was a legal cause of william 8 sury's death for both rjr and for lorillard. we 9 think the answer to those questions is "yes." and 10 that is an important answer for this case, because if 11 you check "no" on those answers, then it means their 12 lies do not matter. 13 fraudulent concealment, conspiracy, is the same 14 question. it is just whether they did it together. 15 and the engle findings show that they did do it 16 together. so if you check "yes" on 4, you should 17 check "yes" on 5 as well, that they conspired 18 together to conceal material information about the 19 health effects and addictive nature of smoking 20 cigarettes. 21 next i want to turn to comparative fault. and 22 this is an important piece in this case, because we 23 told you from day one that we accepted some 24 responsibility for bill sury not quitting earlier, 25 and from day one they have denied any responsibility 1 or any fault for any of their actions. 2 but what the jury instructions tell you is it 3 is a comparison that you need to look at. compare 4 the fault of bill sury against the fault of 5 lorillard and rjr. and we think you have enormous 6 evidence to do that. you are going to have notebooks 7 and notebooks of documents. 8 and i know i showed you just a few of the 9 documents about -- when i went through the '50s and 10 '60s and '70s. you know there were lots of them. 11 and you will have them back in there, and i encourage 12 you to look through them. it is document after 13 document where they knew the effects, where they 14 were telling people -- they were issuing press 15 releases, where they were killing stories about the 16 health consequences and they were trying to 17 influence various news outlets not to put the 18 information out. lots of evidence out there. 19 but what i'm going to ask you to do on this 20 comparative fault is to compare lorillard's and 21 rjr's fault against that of bill sury's. 22 so what do we know about what lorillard and rjr 23 did? well, according to the engle findings, they 24 concealed or omitted -- this is the engle findings, 25 something you cannot question -- with the intention 1 that smokers would rely -- and that is important 2 because it shows not only bad conduct but 3 intentional bad conduct, that they did it on 4 purpose. but not only that, it is that smokers would 5 rely to their detriment. 6 in other words, the engle jury found not only 7 that they fraudulently covered up and concealed and 8 omitted information, but that they did it in order 9 to make smokers believe them. 10 they are going to come in and say, "well, none 11 of them did. bill sury did not believe us." but the 12 engle jury found that they did it with the intention 13 that the smokers would rely on it. and we think the 14 evidence in this case shows that that intention was 15 carried out, that in fact bill sury did rely on it. 16 also the evidence that they manipulated the 17 level of nicotine in order to keep people addicted. 18 and we showed you a lot of documents about that. 19 they are in the 800 series, the p-800 series, where 20 they were adding nicotine at certain points in order 21 to keep the target dose of nicotine a certain way. 22 intentional conduct to manipulate the level of 23 nicotine in order to keep smokers addicted. 24 we need to compare that to bill sury. we have 25 admitted he should have stopped smoking sooner and 1 he did not. 2 but what is the evidence? one, the way he was 3 able to stop finally was with the help of the patch. 4 and it was not even available until 1992 -- 1991, 5 beginning of 1992. 6 we know that he got hooked while he was in the 7 military serving our country and that he got 8 cigarettes in his rations. 9 we know that every year forty percent of smokers 10 try to quit, but only 2 to 3 are successful. 11 so, yeah, we accept some responsibility for 12 bill sury not being able to be in that 2 to 3 13 percent. it is a tough call. it is a tough stand. 14 but we accept some responsibility for him not being 15 in that 2 to 3 percent. 16 but goodness knows, it was not intentional. 17 goodness knows, when compared to the conduct of what 18 they did, it comes nowhere close. 19 we believe he should hold some responsibility, 20 but we believe the lion's share should fall on rjr 21 and lorillard. not just because of the impact of 22 it, but because of the intentional nature of it; his 23 conduct in not stopping sooner compared to the 24 intentional conduct of what they did. 25 you will have question number 6 where you will have 1 to allocate the fault, the percentage of fault that 2 was a legal cause of william sury's death that you 3 charge to rjr, lorillard and william sury. and, 4 ladies and gentlemen, we are going to put that in 5 your hands. you assess the apportionment that you 6 think is right. we suggest to you that bill sury 7 should be charged between 10 and twenty percent, in that 8 range, and that lorillard and rjr are responsible 9 for 40 to 45 percent. 10 whatever you put has to add up to a hundred. 11 whatever you say would be the appropriate amount, 12 we will accept. and as we said from the beginning, we 13 accept some responsibility. the defendants have 14 accepted none. 15 now, the last two things i want to talk 16 about -- it says "end" up there, which means i'm 17 almost done. 18 the last two things i want to talk about are 19 the last two things on the verdict form. and one is 20 damages. and you are going to be called upon to 21 assert -- to put in a blank how much damage the 22 plaintiff is entitled to as a result of his death. 23 and you have with you the mortality tables 24 which are plaintiff's exhibit 11, and these 25 mortality tables show that at the time of bill 1 sury's death he had a life expectancy -- he should 2 have lived a normal life expectancy, if he had not 3 died, of an additional 8.9 years. you have to look 4 it up in these tables based on his age and his race 5 and his gender, but it is 8.9 years, so 9 years 6 basically. he had nine years left to live. 7 and the testimony in the case is that he loved 8 life, that he was healthy, that he enjoyed golfing, 9 that he enjoyed spending time with his son, and that 10 he had no other major illnesses until he was 11 diagnosed with lung cancer. the testimony is that 12 he and his son had a very close relationship. they 13 lived together. 14 and i'll talk more about this later. i should 15 have mentioned this at the beginning, but the way 16 this process works is that i get to speak first and 17 then mr. williams speaks and mr. woods speaks, and i 18 get to come back again at the end and sum up. and 19 so when i do that, i'm going to talk a little more 20 about that damages, talk a little bit more about 21 what we are going to ask you for with respect to 22 that. 23 and i'm also going to talk to you about the 24 last question on the verdict form, which is the 25 punitive damages. and what punitive damages are is 1 an award based -- and the judge has already 2 instructed you about that, but it is an award based 3 on the conduct of the defendant. 4 we believe this case has ample evidence that 5 the jury should award a punitive damage award. and 6 i'm going to talk in length about the reasons for 7 that when i have an opportunity to get back up after 8 they talk. 9 but right now i'm going to sit down and let 10 them talk, and then i'll be able to come back and 11 speak with you. 12 i appreciate your attention. thank you. 14 ms. shamp: thank you, your honor. 15 one of the very first things that john williams 16 said was that ms. shamp might not respond to 17 everything i said, and if she does not then think 18 about what she did not respond to. and they have 19 talked for over 3 and-a-half hours, so i'm not going 20 to respond to everything that he said. i'm just 21 going to hit a few of the important points, and then 22 i'm going to talk a little bit about punitive 23 damages and about damages. 24 i think david woods acknowledged this, but mr. 25 williams did not, and that is that this case is not 1 just about bill sury, but it is about them as well, 2 and their conduct. and you have seen very little from 3 them. and when you go back in the jury room you are 4 going to have very few documents that they admitted 5 in evidence that are their documents, that are 6 documents from lorillard or from r.j. reynolds. 7 those all came in from me. 8 just a quick point. he said that he advanced 9 up at prudential, and i was thinking about that 10 trying to remember the testimony along with ms. 11 bryan. we were trying to remember it together, but 12 we did not have to, because mr. woods put it on a 13 board that mr. sury actually advanced to underwriter 14 in 1959, and he never got another promotion after 15 that until he retired in 1982. so his promotion up 16 the ladder was all the way up until 1959 when he 17 became an underwriter, and he was in the bullpen. 18 but up until 1959 he stayed in the same job from 19 1959 until 1982. 20 they mentioned everybody, this common 21 knowledge, and what hal rush said about it was 22 common knowledge back when we were a kid that 23 smoking was hazardous. well, if you remember what 24 the testimony was about that, dan sury talked about 25 it as well, and he said, yeah, we knew smoking was 1 bad for us because it would make us short of breath, 2 we could not play as much football maybe, not that we 3 knew that there were known carcinogens in there or 4 that we knew that it caused lung cancer. 5 and again throughout mr. williams' and mr. 6 woods' arguments they continued to do what the judge 7 has instructed you they cannot do, and that is 8 question the engle findings that they -- 9 mr. woods: objection, your honor. 10 mr. williams: objection, your honor. we have 11 not. may we approach? 12 the court: ladies and gentlemen, this is 13 argument. 14 and the instructions, let us talk about the 15 instructions that i have read to them. 16 ms. shamp: right, your honor. 17 the court: thank you. 18 ms. shamp: they continue to question the engle 19 findings, and the engle findings, ladies and 20 gentlemen, are binding upon you. they are binding 21 upon you, and thus the argument -- now, we have got it 22 over there, it was up on the board, and that is that 23 they withheld material information that was not 24 otherwise known. 25 so despite all the reader's digest ads and all 1 the newsweek and all the times magazine articles 2 they put in, the engle findings, which bind you, 3 tell you that the information they withheld was not 4 otherwise known, and that is because they withheld 5 not the sort of in the air kind of i think smoking 6 is bad for you, but they withheld specific 7 information about their product, about carcinogens 8 in their product, and about the addictive nature of 9 their product. there are specific things about 10 their product that they withheld that were not 11 otherwise known. 12 he started with the frank sinatra thing again, 13 and he said that, you know, this was in the time 14 when frank sinatra was singing, and he did that from 15 here to eternity clip. 16 do you think that frank sinatra knew that 17 cigarettes caused lung cancer? frank sinatra was 18 actually on the ads for the cigarettes. so was dick 19 van dyke. 20 and the other thing they want you to try and 21 believe is that they engaged in this elaborate 22 public relations campaign which we put on evidence 23 about. they hired the best public relations firm in 24 the city of new york, hill & knowlton, madison 25 avenue top of the line. they hired them to put out 1 this message. but what they want to stand here and 2 tell to believe is that that was not really 3 important, nobody was listening to us, we did not 4 care, everybody already knew. they engaged in this 5 elaborate scheme and put out these booklets, a 6 scientific perspective on the cigarette controversy. 7 these will all be in evidence with you. p182. the 8 smoking controversy, a perspective, a 1978 document, 9 which is p347. smoking and health, a continuing 10 controversy, from the tobacco institute, which is 11 p348. 12 they want you to believe that they spent all 13 the money, that these were actually sent -- you will 14 actually have the document that shows how many 15 copies of those were made. 200,000 copies were 16 made. but they want you to believe, and he is going 17 to stand up here and tell you, that did not make any 18 difference, nobody read those things, nobody cared 19 about them, everybody knew. 20 but i have one -- but they were trying to sell 21 doubt. that is what they were trying to sell. all 22 along they were trying to sell doubt. i showed you 23 the doubt is our product document. but i want to 24 point you to document 168, which is a memorandum 25 that they said, because what they were trying to 1 tell people was, we want to instill this question in 2 them so that they will keep smoking. and they 3 write: there is only one problem, confidence; and 4 how to establish it, public assurance; and how to 5 create it. it is perhaps long interim when 6 scientific -- in this perhaps long interim when 7 scientific doubts must remain, and most important 8 how to free americans from the guilty fear that is 9 going to arise deep in their biological depth 10 regardless of any poo-pooing logic every time they 11 light a cigarette. 12 they were trying to sell doubt. now, i think 13 they tried to suggest -- and i might jump around a 14 bit because i'm trying to address the points he 15 said. 16 they were trying to suggest i think about the 17 patch. well, dr. giakas himself said when mr. sury 18 stopped he was using the patch, based on the 19 brother's testimony, dan sury, that william sury had 20 used the patch. they talk about whether we said it 21 was 30 years back, when it was longer than that. 22 the reason we used the 30 year timeframe -- i 23 want to make that very clear -- is that was the 24 first time that robert sury was old enough to watch 25 his father smoke, and that was in 1964. so the 30 1 year pack and-a-half a day history that we talk 2 about is only because that is when robert sury was 3 able to testify about the amount and the length of 4 time he was smoking. but we know he was smoking 5 long before that, because we have pictures of him 6 smoking on the beach in 1941, not just one pictures, 7 and you will have those pictures back with you, but 8 many pictures, and we have all the pictures of him 9 smoking in the military as well. but i wanted to 10 clear that up, because the 30 years is just based 11 upon when robert sury was old enough to observe his 12 father smoking. 13 they want to frame the question, ladies and 14 gentlemen, as whether or not -- and i wrote it down. 15 the question was whether he wanted to quit, whether 16 he was in control. that is not the question that is 17 on the verdict form. the question on the verdict 18 form is whether he was addicted to cigarettes. and 19 i went through all of that evidence before, but 20 that is the question you are going to be asked to 21 decide, not whether he wanted to quit or whether he 22 could have quit. the question on the verdict form 23 is whether he was addicted to the nicotine in 24 cigarettes. 25 they talk about hal rush and yancey montgomery 1 who came in here, but you will remember that both of 2 them said that he very well could have been trying 3 to quit and they not known it. both of them said 4 that. 5 now, they have asked you to look at the polls in 6 depth, and i say, please do. look at these polls. 7 they are going back there. because i think it is very 8 interesting for you to know that the polls that i 9 put in and that i asked you about you will have back 10 in evidence. the gallup polls that they have talked 11 about are not back in evidence with you. these are 12 the polls that you are going to have back in 13 evidence. 14 and i want to point out -- he read to you from 15 the gallup poll, and i want to point out on page 16 31 -- because he said that in the gallup poll it 17 said everybody knew that smoking was hazardous. 18 what it said on page 31 is: while cigarettes are 19 regarded as bad for you to a greater extent than 20 other products we asked about, there is a striking 21 little concern about the health aspects. 22 then the second point was: what concern there 23 is in the health scare seemed largely directed at 24 the avoidance of throat irritation. 25 that is what the poll says that they knew in 1 1959, what the public was aware of in 1959. not 2 lung cancer, but throat irritation, when we know 3 that the rodgman memo in 1956 showed that there is 17 4 known carcinogens in their cigarette smoke and that 5 they did not tell anybody about that. 6 they want to make a lot about this issue of 7 studies. i think john williams went on and on about 8 studies, and he actually talked about the hutchinson 9 study. and i was surprised he was talking about the 10 hutchinson study. you remember him saying about the 11 hutchinson study and there was this one study and 12 that what we want to talk about are these consensus 13 documents? the hutchinson study is not in evidence. 14 you will not have the hutchinson study when you go 15 back. what you will have are the surgeon general 16 reports. you will have the consensus documents, not 17 the one study written by one or two authors. the 18 studies that are written by the consensus of the 19 american scientific community when they put together 20 the surgeon general's report. 21 he also talked about project 16. and you 22 remember him talking about that. but you will also 23 remember on goldberg's direct -- and project 16 was 24 whether that study was done by r.j. reynolds which 25 targeted 16 year old children. but you will remember 1 -- and you will have this document, the '94 surgeon 2 general's report. and on page 175 it talks about -- 3 you can look on page 175, the youth target study 87, 4 which was an r.j. reynolds study. the youth target 5 study, where they looked at the effects of cigarette 6 advertising on subjects from the ages of 15 to 24 7 that r.j. reynolds did. 8 well, the other thing i think both mr. woods 9 and mr. williams made a big deal about, and that was 10 that filters are -- and i believe they actually said 11 this, that filters are actually safer for you. that 12 is not the evidence in the case. in fact, the 13 evidence in the case is quite the contrary. the 14 evidence in the case is that filters actually have 15 had no difference on safety. and you have that in 16 the 2010 surgeon general's report. 17 right. the 2010 surgeon general's report says 18 it right here on page 37: unfortunately with the 19 accrual and evaluation of additional data the 20 evidence today does not demonstrate that efforts to 21 lower nicotine measured -- lower machined measured 22 tar and nicotine yields actually decrease the health 23 risks of smoking, primarily because these changes 24 did not reduce smokers actual exposure to tobacco 25 toxicants. indeed to the extent that filters and 4706 1 other efforts to reduce machined measured tar and 2 nicotine reduced smokers' health concerns and 3 thereby delayed quitting and/or increased cigarette 4 use they may have contributed to overall increase in 5 cigarette-caused mortality. 6 it also says that: the tobacco industry 7 documents, many of which are available on the legacy 8 documents library, clearly demonstrate that at least 9 by the mid 70's the tobacco industry well understood 10 the importance of creating health reassurance 11 messages in order to alleviate health concerns, and 12 the one important method of doing so was claims of 13 low deliveries of tar. for example, in 1977 the 14 british american company marketing report concluded 15 that all work in this area should be directed toward 16 providing consumer reassurance. 17 it says that the tobacco industry knew -- and 18 you can read this on page 175 -- that the lower tar 19 and nicotine cigarettes did not produce any health 20 benefits, and that the tobacco industry knew that, 21 because they knew that people compensated. 22 i think he -- mr. williams maybe misspoke. he 23 also said that nobody saw the frank statement. 24 that is what he said, he said nobody saw the frank 25 statement, which was published in every newspaper in 1 a city of more than 50,000 residents. it was 2 published in every single newspaper during that day. 3 now, the ftc reports that he talked about, they 4 are actually in evidence in this case, and they will 5 show you that in '94 the tobacco industry was 6 spending 4 billion dollars a year on advertising, 7 but the value, the total value of people who were 8 switching from one to another was only 650 million. 9 and so the '94 study, and the '94 surgeon general's 10 report, and monograph 19 talk about that marketing 11 and advertising does in fact increase tobacco use. 12 it does, and the industry well knows it, and that is 13 why they spend the money. they do not spend that 14 kind of money just to get people to switch from one 15 brand to another brand. 16 the testimony in the case about dorals, dr. 17 sury testified that his father smoked dorals from 18 about 1969, '70 all the way until his death, and he 19 also smoked kent. 20 i think mr. williams must have misread the 21 national life statistics table, which you will have 22 back. he said it was seven years. but if you look 23 very clearly, you have to look at a white male who 24 was 77 years old at the time, and if you look across 25 there it is 8.9 years that he had left to live, not 1 seven. 2 and mr. woods said there at the end of his 3 presentation that mr. sury never picked up a 4 cigarette before 1941. there is no evidence of 5 that. in fact, what we do know is that by 1941 he 6 was already smoking. we do not know when he started, 7 but he was already smoking by that time, and the 8 evidence in this case from every witness is, 9 including the surgeon general's report, is that 10 almost all smokers, 85 to ninety percent, start in their 11 teens. 12 now, the kent ads that were also interesting. 13 mr. woods talked about how those kent ads had to be 14 stopped in 1955 because the ftc put a stop to it and 15 would not let them use those health protection ads. 16 we showed you ones that went not only to 1960 but 17 '64, through that time, because they still were 18 advertising their micronite filter all the way 19 through the 60's. you will remember, you will have it 20 back there, the p21's are the ads, but there is the 21 bob cousy ad, remember the basketball player, and 22 that is a '64 ad, and the science ad i showed in the 23 first part of my opening, the 1960 ad. 24 you will also have document 367, which is the ftc 25 report, and mr. woods touched on it. but the ftc 1 report -- what the ftc report said, and you will 2 remember we put this in evidence, is that the 3 tobacco industry spends in one day in advertising 4 what the public health community spends in an entire 5 year. in one day they spend what they spend in an 6 entire year. and dr. goldberg testified i think 7 accurately that the public health message was 8 overwhelmed by the cigarette advertising message. 9 you also have document 343 back with you, and 10 this you will remember was in evidence, this is a 1978 11 document which says in it: very few consumers are 12 aware of the effects of nicotine, its addictive 13 nature, and that nicotine is a poison. 14 the tobacco industry itself is telling them 15 they do not know, people do not know the addictive 16 nature of cigarettes. and that is exhibit 343. 17 finally i want to talk a little bit more about 18 the -- mr. woods mentioned that we did not bring a 19 pathologist in. we brought in two doctors who gave 20 unequivocal testimony that this was a primary lung 21 cancer caused by smoking. they brought in on the 22 other side a pathologist who only looked at the 23 slides and who said not that this was not a primary 24 tumor, only that based on this he could not tell. 25 so now after i've talked about that i want to 1 move to a little bit about damages. ladies and 2 gentlemen, i think there is a whole host of reasons 3 in this case that plaintiffs are entitled to an 4 award of punitive damages for the defendants' 5 conduct. and punitive damages, as the judge has 6 already instructed you in his instructions, and it is 7 at the back of the page, punitive damages are 8 warranted if you find by clear and convincing 9 evidence. and then the instructions give four 10 different reasons, and i want to focus on number 3 11 of those reasons. 12 number 3. the conduct showed an entire lack of 13 care that r.j. reynolds and lorillard must have 14 wantonly or recklessly disregarded the safety or 15 welfare of the public. 16 so what is the evidence that r.j. reynolds and 17 lorillard disregarded the safety and welfare of the 18 public? that is what i want to focus on. 19 first, marketing to kids. the evidence is 20 overwhelming that both lorillard and r.j. reynolds 21 have marketed to youth. you have seen those 22 documents, and there are many of them, not just the 23 seven. i'm going to focus on a few of them. first 24 i want to focus on the '94 surgeon general's report. 25 there is an entire chapter which talks about the 1 marketing of cigarettes to kids by the tobacco 2 companies. part of it is what i just read. this 3 document says they are marketing to children. right. 4 but we do not have to listen to them, because we have 5 their own documents. their document, which i showed 6 you, document 309, plaintiff's 309, which says -- 7 and i commend you to read the entire document, 8 because the entire document is talking about how to 9 prey upon the weakness of adolescents by creating a 10 brand that kids will want to smoke. this entire 11 document talks about that, and frankly it is 12 reprehensible. 13 what it says here is: a new brand aimed at the 14 young -- he is talking about how to make this brand 15 appealable -- should not in any way be promoted as a 16 health brand, and perhaps should carry some implied 17 risk. in this sense the warning label on the 18 package may be a plus. 19 it talks about how children during this period, 20 adolescents, are insecure, and so they need to 21 market their product to try and capitalize on their 22 insecurity and make them have a greater sense of 23 self image. this is a very damaging document for 24 them, and it talks about the teens that they promote 25 to. 1 also a lorillard document -- and i just picked 2 a few out, ladies and gentlemen. there are lots of 3 them back there. but the lorillard document from 4 '78 says: the base of our business is the high 5 school student. and that is document -- that is 6 august 30, 1978, the curtis judge document. 7 the hilton head document. this was to the 8 board of directors. this is not just a low -- this 9 is a presentation to the board of directors of r.j. 10 reynolds, which was done at hilton head in 1974, 11 where they talk about how we are going to market to 12 14 year olds. then it also talks about they are 13 going to insert additional ads in magazines like 14 sports illustrated, playboy, and mist, magazines 15 that they know there is a youth readership of. this 16 is document 316. 17 there is lots of youth marketing documents. 18 you will have them all back. and the surgeon 19 general's report. 20 the fundamental fact is that the tobacco 21 industry knows it, and it is in the surgeon general's 22 report, is they have to get replacement smokers. 23 and they call them replacement smokers in some of 24 the documents we put up in front of you. smokers 25 die and smokers quit, and the place they get 1 replacement smokers is kids, and they know it, and 2 they target their targeting efforts at kids. 3 the second reason we believe we are entitled to 4 punitive damages, because of their reprehensible 5 conduct, is the manipulation of nicotine in their 6 cigarettes. and you will have many documents, and 7 they start -- i've written down a list of them: 8 documents 862, 871, 872, 874, and all of them talk 9 about how they were trying to control the level of 10 nicotine in their products. 11 experiments have indicated that free nicotine 12 can be added at almost any place in the 13 manufacturing process. an investigation into 14 increasing the nicotine content of our present type 15 of reconstituted tobacco has been made. nicotine 16 was added to all three batches of the slurry. this 17 is called the nicotine enrichment project. 18 and then my favorite, which is document 874, 19 which says: in any case, information we gain on the 20 mechanism nicotine activity may be useful in 21 determining how to adjust the physiological impact 22 in our cigarettes. 23 that is what they wanted to do, to adjust the 24 physiological impact of their cigarettes, to adjust 25 the nicotine level to keep people addicted. 1 the third reason we think we are entitled to 2 punitive damages is that the only time the cigarette 3 manufacturers have ever put warnings on their 4 products, that they ever communicated warnings was 5 when they were forced to. you will remember the 6 testimony from lorillard's corporate reps, you will 7 remember the testimony from r.j. reynolds, when the 8 warnings were proposed they opposed them. contrast 9 that to what you see today amongst manufacturers of 10 products. it happened just this weekend i noticed 11 with a toy, that there was a concern that a toy on 12 the shelf might cause a choking hazard. and the 13 first thing that matel does is pull the toy off the 14 shelf. they do not wait for the government to force 15 them, they do not go to committee hearings, they pull 16 the things off the shelf. 17 whenever there is a problem with a food 18 substance the manufacturers pull those things. the 19 manufacturers take those toys off the shelf. 20 compare that to what happened in this case, 21 where the manufacturers of cigarettes fought the 22 warnings every time and at every step of the 23 process. 24 but the fourth and probably the most important 25 reason that we punitive damages should be awarded in 1 this case is that it is still happening today. they 2 have not changed. it is still happening today in this 3 courtroom. 4 mr. williams: objection, your honor. 5 mr. woods: approach, please. [#deleted sidebar#] 18 the court: okay. ladies and gentlemen, please 19 disregard the last statement. nothing that has 20 happened in this courtroom is a basis for punitive 21 damages. you are to only consider the evidence that 22 has been presented in this courtroom. 23 you may proceed. 24 ms. shamp: thank you. i want to talk for a 25 moment about addiction. i want to talk for a moment 1 about what dr. giakas said about addiction. what 2 mr. williams said in his openings and closing. he 3 said -- and i wrote it down -- that bill sury could 4 have quit any time he wanted to, that he just did not 5 want to bad enough, that he smoked because he wanted 6 to, not because he was addicted. and i wrote down 7 this because it struck me in the very first day of 8 trial in opening statements where david woods said 9 the choice to smoke was like grabbing low fat 10 dressing out of the refrigerator. remember him 11 saying that? it evinces not only a misunderstanding 12 about addiction, but we know they know about 13 addiction, because what they wanted to tell people 14 was you could pick it up and put it down any time 15 you want. pick it up, put it down. pick it up, put 16 it down. put the ads on. it is a happy thing to do. 17 pick it up, put it down. it is like grabbing low fat 18 dressing out of the refrigerator. pick it up, put 19 it down. 20 but what dr. giakas said on the stand, it was 21 just a matter of him wanting to. just a matter of 22 him wanting to. shows a deep misunderstanding of 23 addiction that i think is intentional. 24 i think it is intentional because we have a 25 document. it is document 363. and i want you to 1 read it when you get back, because it is a document 2 from 1980. what it says is: i'm told that the 3 entire matter of addiction is the most potent weapon 4 a prosecuting attorney can have in a lung cancer 5 cigarette case. we cannot defend continued smoking 6 as free choice if the person was addicted. 7 that is their own document. they cannot defend 8 this as free choice. and they know they cannot, 9 because bill sury was addicted. document 363. 10 i also want to talk for a moment about mary 11 ridell's testimony, because what mary ridell said 12 was that campaigns to try to keep kids from smoking 13 were not important, should not even be done because 14 kids make, i believe she talked about, rational 15 informed choices. 16 pick it up, put it down. that is what they are 17 telling you. that is what they were telling kids. 18 pick it up, put it down. 19 finally i want to talk for just a minute about 20 damages. that is the question that you will have on 21 the jury form. now, this is the hard part, and i 22 will tell you at the front i'm no better with coming 23 up with what the right number is than you are. i've 24 thought about it, i've talked with dr. sury about 25 it, thought hard about what i would ask you for and 1 what the evidence would support, and what we know 2 about bill sury. he was a good man who loved life 3 and who had nine years left to live. not the nine 4 years -- nine years in his retirement time when he 5 was still -- if you will remember he was still playing 6 golf, walking on the beach with his son. nine years 7 of life taken from him. what is that worth? 8 you know, it is funny. there is been some 9 disagreement in this case about whether mr. sury was 10 a successful man in terms of his business. but 11 there is no disagreement that mr. sury was a 12 successful man. he was a successful man because of 13 the family he had, he was a successful man because 14 of the life he had. his life and the life he shared 15 with his son was valued. 16 so i am going to ask you for millions of 17 dollars. i am going to ask you for five million 18 dollars, and even number, for bill sury's life. 19 now, you might be sitting there saying, now, 20 where did ms. shamp get that number? did she pull 21 it out of her hair, pull it out of the air? and the 22 answer is -- 23 mr. woods: your honor, may we approach? 24 sorry. 25 the court: yes. 1 (sidebar conference outside the hearing of the 2 jury.) 3 the court: this is my third tobacco trial, and 4 it always seems i get more sidebars in the last 20 5 minutes of the trial than any other time. but go 6 ahead. 7 mr. woods: i apologize, your honor, but she 8 just asked for five million dollars for bill sury's 9 life. she cannot ask -- 10 the court: well, she said that and then there 11 was a pause. 12 i think you need to make it clear, ms. shamp, 13 unless you want me to make it clear. 14 ms. shamp: i think i -- 15 the court: no, you did not. 16 ms. shamp: i'm sorry. 17 the court: i heard what he said, and you said 18 five million dollars for mr. sury's life. there was 19 no objection for a while, and then you said i may 20 have pulled that out of the air or hair, and so then 21 there was an objection. 22 i want you to clear it up, and if you do not 23 clear it up well enough then i'll clear it up that 24 it is not for his life, it is for the wrongful death 25 issues on the verdict form. 1 ms. shamp: i understand. 2 the court: and the motion -- unless it was not 3 clear earlier, the motion for mistrial on the last 4 time we were up here is denied, and as it relates to 5 the curative instruction i gave, i was happy to have 6 considered other curative instructions, but the 7 defense chose not to give one, saying it was 8 impossible. thank you. 9 (following sidebar.) 10 ms. shamp: let me make it clear. we are asking 11 for five million dollars for the companionship that 12 robert sury lost as a result of losing his father. 13 the testimony is clear that they had a close 14 relationship, and that -- you will have the mortality 15 tables, that he had nine years left to live. 16 but as i said, that is a decision within the 17 sound discretion of the jury to make the 18 determination. and i am no better at the 19 determination than the six of you combined talking 20 together about what the right number is or ought to 21 be under those scenarios. but we believe that five 22 million dollars for the loss is a fair number to ask 23 you for. 24 i want to thank you again on behalf of myself 25 and my team, leslie bryan, my co-counsel, ragan 4733 1 ferguson, tiffany mccain, and also on behalf of our 2 client dr. robert sury. we thank you for your 3 service in this case, because that is what it is. 4 and the judge talked to you about that at the 5 very beginning, that this was service. and i 6 thought it was interesting that the case fell over 7 veterans day and we had veterans day in it, and that 8 this service that you are providing is the only 9 service that would be more important than service to 10 your country at war. 11 let me make it clear that the service that 12 you are providing today is not to me or my team or 13 even to dr. sury, but to this country and your 14 community. the word verdict means to speak the 15 truth, ver for veritos, veritble, means truth, and 16 dic like in dictaphone means to speak. we are 17 asking you for a verdict in this case that speaks 18 the truth. we are asking you for a verdict that says 19 that what they said and the lies they told are 20 important and did have a cause. we are asking you 21 for a verdict that says the plaintiff is entitled to 22 punitive damages, and we are asking for a verdict 23 that awards damages for the death and for the loss 24 that robert sury has suffered as a result of his 25 father's death. i thank you. 1 the court: ladies and gentlemen, as i told you 2 before i have some other instructions to give you. 3 it is going to take me a few minutes to set up all 4 that we need to do, because when i complete these 5 instructions you are going to go and deliberate. so 6 what i'm going to do is organize some things so that 7 i can put -- i'm going to ask you to go out, but 8 while you are doing that i'm going to organize so i 9 can put all those documents and other evidence and 10 things you have seen in the courtroom in a method so 11 that i can get it into the jury room when you come 12 back out. i'm going to give a copy of the 13 instructions that you read with me earlier. i'm 14 going to put a set of those in the jury room. the 15 instructions i'm about to give you, i'm going to put 16 those in the jury room, but i'm going to also put 17 them on your chair so you can read those 18 instructions along with me, and then the verdict 19 form that you will utilize i'm going to put that in 20 the jury room. so as we organize this it is just 21 going to take several minutes to organize. so i'm 22 going to ask that you go into the jury room while we 23 organize transferring all that stuff. thank you.
