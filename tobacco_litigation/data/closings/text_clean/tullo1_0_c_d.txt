22 ms. gallagher: thank you, your honor. 23 good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. this 24 case is about mr. tullo. this case is about 25 what he knew about cigarettes, how he knew that, 5057 1 and why he made the decisions he did. and the 2 short answers to those questions that i'll spend 3 the next hour or so talking to you about are 4 that mr. tullo knew that smoking was dangerous 5 and addictive. he got that information from the 6 public health authorities and his own family. 7 mr. tullo made the decision when he would quit, 8 and nothing the tobacco companies said or did 9 impacted any of those decisions he made. 10 you have been presented with kind of two 11 different worlds in this courtroom. one i would 12 call the litigation world that has been created 13 by the plaintiff attorneys and their experts. 14 and then you have the real world in which 15 mr. tullo lived. 16 and in the litigation world you have had the 17 plaintiffs bring you experts to come in and talk 18 about documents, talk about statements, talk 19 about ads that are decades and decades old. 20 some of them older than some of you. what they 21 have not done is tell you that mr. tullo, the 22 person that this case is about, saw any of those 23 ads, heard any of those statements. as mr. fasi 24 told you in opening statement, there is a missing 25 link. and the plaintiffs have not brought that 5058 1 to you. they have not shown that mr. tullo heard 2 or saw any of that, much less that that had any 3 impact on him. 4 now, we brought you some historical evidence 5 also. and you might be asking yourself, why did 6 they do that? because we cannot tell you that 7 the reader's digest we put up, the information 8 we put up, we cannot tell you that mr. tullo saw 9 that any more than they can tell you that 10 mr. tullo saw that information or heard that 11 information. but we brought you that 12 information because if you listened only to the 13 plaintiff's experts and to the plaintiff's 14 attorneys and, in fact, if you listen to 15 mr. hammer today in his closing you would think 16 the tobacco companies were the only voice out 17 there talking about cigarettes. and you know 18 that is just not true. the medical press was 19 talking about cigarettes and the dangers of 20 cigarettes. the lay press was talking about it. 21 the surgeon general was talking about it. the 22 public health community was talking about it. 23 and, in fact, you know from the testimony in the 24 case the tullos themselves were talking about 25 it. this was not something that only the 5059 1 tobacco companies were involved in. 2 so let us go back and look at what some of 3 those other voices were, some of the other 4 information that was out there. 5 now, you know that for a long time people 6 have known that smoking was not good for you and 7 that smoking was addictive. you have heard 8 evidence in this courtroom that during the 1940s 9 and particularly in the 1950s some 10 epidemiological studies started coming out 11 having a scientific link between cigarette 12 smoking and disease and specifically lung 13 cancer. but this was not something new. people 14 had known for a long time that smoking was 15 dangerous. and you have seen some of these 16 before. 17 this is reader's digest. you have heard a lot 18 more about reader's digest in this case than you 19 probably ever wanted to hear, one of the most 20 popular magazines of its time back then. this 21 is back in 1935, and reader's digest is talking 22 about on giving up smoking. and what do they 23 say about tobacco? that it is a drug, this is 24 1935, and that it gives you cancer. this is 25 1935 telling the american public, cigarette 5060 1 smoking gives you cancer. 2 the same is true with addiction. as far 3 back as christopher columbus, you heard, in the 4 late 1400s people recognized that tobacco was 5 hard to quit. and, ladies and gentlemen, i say 6 tobacco because it was not cigarettes. the 7 modern cigarette was hundreds and hundreds of 8 years from being developed. people knew back 9 500, 600 years ago that smoking was difficult to 10 quit. 11 this is john quincy adams in 1845. "in my 12 early youth i was addicted to the use of tobacco 13 in two of its mysteries, smoking and chewing." 14 1845 he is talking about tobacco being 15 addictive. 16 "cigarette and the boys." the florida 17 health notes, you remember this from the early 18 1900s. this one is 1906, and florida health 19 notes, which was published here, says, "to-day 20 the cigarette is looked upon by all smokers as 21 the very worst form of tobacco addiction." 22 this is not something new. 23 "life without nicotine." as i told you, 24 people for hundreds of years have recognized 25 that nicotine in cigarettes is difficult to give 5061 1 up. and here we are with newsweek back in 1951 2 telling people how to quit smoking, giving them 3 some of the same things we will see a little bit 4 later in smart move that was published in the 5 late 19 -- by the american cancer society. 6 people recognized that smoking was difficult to 7 give up. 8 now, it was no secret in the 1930s, '40s, 9 '50s, '60s that smoking was dangerous and 10 nicotine was hard to give up, that it was an 11 addiction. and let me talk a little bit about 12 the word "addiction." because you have heard that 13 it was not until 1988 that the surgeon general of 14 the united states labeled nicotine addictive. 15 and it is because in 1988 the surgeon general 16 changed the definition of addictive. 17 if you go back to 1964 when the surgeon 18 general was talking about tobacco and the 19 dangers of smoking, the surgeon general said, 20 nicotine is not addictive. we are not going to 21 call cigarettes addictive. and it is because of 22 the definition that they were using at the time 23 that required intoxication. 24 when we fast forward to 1988, the surgeon 25 general says, yes, we are going to use a 5062 1 different definition of addiction and therefore 2 nicotine is addictive. but does it really 3 matter what label you use? it does not matter 4 whether you call it addictive. it does not 5 matter whether you call it dependence-producing 6 or a really bad habit. it all means the same 7 thing. 8 now, the tobacco companies hung on to the 9 old definition of the word addiction, and did 10 they hold onto that old definition of addiction 11 too long? yes. did the tobacco companies make 12 some statements that today we look at and say, 13 those are totally unreasonable? yes. did the 14 tobacco companies write things down that when 15 we are looking at them today we say, that is just 16 not reasonable? yes. 17 but the question for you in this case is, 18 did that impact anything mr. tullo did or did not 19 do? that is the question you have to answer in 20 this lawsuit. 21 now, let us talk a little about the 22 statements that the tobacco companies were 23 making when they said cigarette smoking is not 24 addictive, when they said that cigarette smoking 25 does not cause disease and they said we need more tullo v r j reynolds - vol 34 - 04-12-2011 trial transcript 5063 1 research on this, we need to do more research. 2 what did dr. riddel tell you about that 3 yesterday? she told you that what the tobacco 4 companies were saying was not effective. and 5 remember she talked about awareness and she 6 talked about people can hear things and be aware 7 of things. and then that has to transfer into 8 do people believe things. and she showed you a 9 slide yesterday. 10 jen, would you pull that please. 11 from 1954 up until 1990 when the tobacco 12 companies were making all these statements, what 13 happened to the belief in the american public 14 about whether cigarette smoking was a cause of 15 lung cancer? if you start back here in 1954 16 with the blue graph and just follow it up to 17 1990, you can see that no matter what the 18 tobacco companies were saying out there it just 19 did not work, because the american public 20 believed and believed through the years that 21 cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer. 22 the plaintiff's attorneys want you to 23 believe that mr. tullo heard nothing except what 24 the tobacco companies were saying. and that is 25 not true. let us get out of the litigation world 5064 1 and go back to mr. tullo's world. because in 2 the real world we know that mr. tullo knew 3 smoking was dangerous. we know that because 4 ms. tullo talked to her husband about the 5 surgeon general's report. she talked to him 6 about the dangers that were in the surgeon 7 general's report, and, in fact, mr. tullo said 8 he had read about it, he had heard about it 9 independent of what ms. tullo told him. 10 ms. tullo pointed out the warnings on the 11 packs of cigarettes. and i'll show you those 12 later. you have seen those. the warnings that 13 said, cigarettes may be hazardous to your 14 health. the warnings that said cigarette 15 smoking can give you lung cancer. ms. tullo 16 pointed out warnings on those packages to her 17 husband. and every time he reached into that 18 pocket to pull out a cigarette, he saw those 19 warnings. 20 the surgeon general told mr. tullo in 1964 21 that smoking causes lung cancer. you know that 22 he is read about it. we have put up a lot of 23 things up here on the boards that you all have 24 seen, and one thing we do know that mr. tullo 25 saw were the newspapers. he read the new york 5065 1 daily news and he was an avid newspaper reader. 2 we brought you articles from the new york 3 papers. so there is at least a better chance 4 that he actually saw those rather than all these 5 other things that plaintiff's attorneys have 6 brought to you that have absolutely no 7 connection to mr. tullo. 8 what did mr. tullo do when mrs. tullo would 9 point out the dangers of smoking? he would 10 ignore her. he would get angry. he would give 11 her the silent treatment. he would get annoyed. 12 and sometimes he would blow smoke in her face. 13 why? because he already knew what she was 14 telling him and he did not want her annoying him 15 any more with this information he already had. 16 and on some occasions mr. tullo would say, do not 17 worry, i'm smoking a filtered cigarette. well, 18 he was either telling ms. tullo that to get her 19 to quit nagging him, as she said in her plain 20 brooklyn language that she would nag him about 21 the risks of smoking, so he was either doing 22 that to make her stop or he had heard what the 23 public health community was saying. and it was 24 the public health community that was saying, 25 quit smoking, and if you do not quit, smoke a low 5066 1 tar cigarette or a filtered cigarette. 2 now, ask yourself, if mr. tullo did not know 3 that smoking was dangerous, then why did he 4 switch to a filtered cigarette? if he thought 5 that this was a less dangerous cigarette, then 6 he had to know that the cigarettes he was 7 smoking were dangerous. 8 and no one ever told mr. tullo that filtered 9 cigarettes were safe or safer. everything you 10 have heard is that filtered cigarettes were less 11 dangerous. 12 when mr. tullo caught his daughter smoking, 13 mrs. casino, what did he tell her? if i catch 14 you doing that again, you are going to be in 15 trouble. she was 16, 17 years old stealing his 16 cigarettes, his filtered marlboro cigarettes. 17 he did not tell her, oh, you are okay because 18 you are smoking a filtered cigarette, what he 19 told her was, do not do it again. 20 this was in the mid '60s. 21 and even dr. cummings told you that he 22 thought mr. tullo was probably aware of the 23 health risks of smoking. after we brought all 24 those things up, all the reader's digest, all 25 the magazine articles that is when dr. cummings 5067 1 finally said, yeah, mr. tullo probably saw this 2 and he was probably aware of it. 3 in the lawsuit world dr. cummings and 4 dr. burns would have you believe that mr. tullo 5 was probably aware of the health risks of 6 smoking, but that for some reason he could not 7 quit. for some reason he could not process the 8 information that millions of other people 9 processed. 10 you know, one of the things mr. hammer was 11 saying was, you know, in 1954, in 1964, if the 12 cigarette companies would have just said, we 13 agree with the surgeon general or had put out 14 the frank statement and said, you know, we think 15 cigarettes cause lung cancer, what did he tell 16 you? if they had done that back in 1954 17 americans would have quit smoking. 18 people are still smoking today. they have 19 not shown you that anything the tobacco 20 companies said or did not say had any impact on 21 mr. tullo. and everything that mr. hammer is 22 telling you in his closing argument is just pure 23 speculation. he wants you to make the jump that 24 if the tobacco companies had done this then all 25 of america would have done something different. 5068 1 and we know that that has just not happened. 2 let me keep on filtered cigarettes for a 3 while. dr. cummings and burns want you to 4 believe that mr. tullo started smoking filtered 5 cigarettes, and particularly parliament 6 cigarettes, because of ads. and mr. hammer 7 actually got up and told you in his closing 8 argument that those ads said that these 9 cigarettes were safe or safer, filtered 10 cigarettes were safe or safer. you have got a 11 bunch of ads that you can look at when you get 12 into your deliberations, and you are not going 13 to find that word on any of those ads. that is 14 not what those ads were saying. 15 and the problem is, even if those ads said 16 that, the plaintiff's attorneys and their 17 experts cannot link any ad to mr. tullo. no one 18 can tell you that mr. tullo based his decision 19 on what brand of cigarettes he smoked and 20 whether he smoked filtered cigarettes or 21 unfiltered cigarettes on any ad that is out 22 there. it is mr. fasi's missing link again. 23 there is just no connection. 24 let us look at the real world again. the 25 plaintiff's experts would have you believe that 5069 1 it was the tobacco companies only that were 2 talking about filters and filtered cigarettes. 3 and, again, you know that is not true. the 4 tobacco companies were not the only voice 5 talking about filtered cigarettes. in fact, who 6 were the people who were talking about low tar 7 and filtered cigarettes? the scientists, the 8 surgeon general, the national cancer institute, 9 the american cancer society. these were the 10 people who were telling smokers, quit smoking, 11 but if you do not quit, go to a cigarette that is 12 low tar, and one of the ways you can get low tar 13 is to smoke a filtered cigarette. there were 14 other voices out there. 15 as far back as 1957 dr. wynder, dr. wynder 16 back here in 1957 questioned making cigarettes 17 safe. and this is dr. wynder that you have heard 18 so much about with the mouse painting, and he is 19 on the -- in the medical press, he is in the lay 20 press. you have heard a lot about dr. wynder. 21 and what dr. wynder is saying here is if you 22 remove the tar from cigarettes or you reduce the 23 tar in cigarettes that what he has found is you 24 reduce the risk. in other words, he is saying 25 here, a forty percent filter would bring most men's 5070 1 tar intake down to the equivalent of well under 2 a pack a day. if you are smoking a whole bunch 3 more and you reduce the tar, then you reduce the 4 total exposure. nowhere here does dr. wynder 5 say, and you are smoking a safe cigarette. what 6 he is saying is you reduce the tar. 7 here's dr. wynder again, two years later, 8 april of 1959, "smoking and cancer," this is 9 five years before the surgeon general's report 10 comes out, and here we have time magazine 11 talking about smoking and cancer. 12 and dr. wynder despairs of persuading 55 13 million americans to quit the habit. "but how am 14 i going to get 55 million people to quit the 15 habit? but to make it safer, he urges 16 manufacturers to use low tar tobaccos and the 17 most potent filters they can find." 18 this is what dr. wynder is saying in 1959. 19 everyone agreed, including every single surgeon 20 general, that if tar could be reduced, 21 cigarettes would be less dangerous, not safe, no 22 one has ever said that smoking a low tar 23 filtered cigarette is safe. what the public 24 health community said was that it was less 25 dangerous. but they told you and we will look at 5071 1 these, it could still cause lung cancer and 2 death. 3 as i told you, one way to reduce the tar is 4 filters, to smoke a filtered cigarette. 5 and here we go. most scientists -- and this 6 is to smoke or not to smoke from acs is the 7 american cancer society and you have all of 8 these back in the jury room with you when you 9 deliberate and you can look at the entire 10 document. 11 but this is the american cancer society 12 saying to smoke or not to smoke. and they say: 13 "most scientists believe that a decrease in the 14 intake of tar, either by filtration or a 15 reduction in smoking reduces the risk of lung 16 cancer." either by filtration put a filter on 17 the cigarette to reduce the tar or a reduction 18 in smoking, smoke less cigarettes. reduces the 19 risk of lung cancer, but nowhere here does it 20 say it takes away the risk of lung cancer. 21 here's the new york times. this is january 22 15th, 1964, terry, you remember terry was the 23 surgeon general in 1964. qualifies filter tip 24 reply, "to the extent that a filter removes tar 25 and nicotine and gaseous elements of cigarette 5072 1 smoke, it is not reasonable to assume that the 2 affects of the filter will be similar to the 3 effects reported by the committee on smoking 4 fewer cigarettes." 5 so they are saying here, although it will 6 reduce it, it is not the same as not smoking. 7 there is a difference. it is a reduction in the 8 harm. it is not making it safe. 9 here we have 1967 news release by a senator. 10 this is after the surgeon general's report and 11 he says, "hopefully, the wide dissemination of 12 this information and the growing awareness of 13 its significance among the smoking public will 14 channel competition in the cigarette industry 15 toward the marketing of cigarettes of 16 progressively low tar and nicotine content. for 17 the best of our knowledge, such a change would 18 produce progressively less hazardous cigarettes 19 for the american public." 20 here is a senator calling on the tobacco 21 companies to make filtered cigarettes because we 22 think it will make it less hazardous. 23 here we have the department of health, 24 education and welfare from 1968. you heard some 25 of this from dr. riddel yesterday. and here we 5073 1 are talking about the effects of filter 2 cigarettes on the risk of lung cancer. "this 3 leads to the estimate that the person who 4 switches to a filter cigarette has about 60 5 percent of the risk of a person in the same 6 exposure category who continues to smoke regular 7 cigarettes." 8 that would be nonfiltered cigarettes. 9 here we are talking about a reduction in risk 10 again. 11 1979 surgeon general's report. we have jumped 12 a decade. the surgeon general is still saying 13 filter cigarettes, "use of filter cigarettes and 14 smoking of cigarettes with lower amounts of tar 15 and nicotine decrease lung cancer mortality 16 rates among smokers." 17 and, again, the surgeon general is saying 18 decrease. it does not eliminate it. what is 19 out in the public health, what the public health 20 is putting out is reduce your tar, one of the 21 ways you can reduce your tar is through using a 22 filter, but it is only going to reduce your risk, 23 it does not take it away. 24 and then one more from the 1981 surgeon 25 general's report. and, again, they are saying 5074 1 the same thing. you have higher lung cancer 2 incidents in people who smoke the higher tar 3 than you do who smoke lower tar. and once again 4 they are not saying lung cancer goes away. what 5 they are saying is you reduce the amount. the 6 message is clear over the decades that it is not 7 going to be a safe cigarette, but that a 8 filtered cigarette reduces the harm. 9 so what did the tobacco companies do? they 10 did what the public health community was 11 advocating. they studied filters, they sold 12 filtered cigarettes. before wynder and the 13 others in the public health community told 14 people to smoke filtered cigarettes back in 1953 15 the filter market was 3 percent of all of 16 cigarettes sold. by 1968 that number -- 1967, 17 that number was up to 68 percent. 18 people had heard the public health community 19 message, reduce your tar, do it by smoking a 20 filtered cigarette, and americans were doing 21 that, mr. tullo was one of them. 22 now, how do we know that mr. tullo was 23 smoking filtered cigarettes because of the 24 public health community? we know that because 25 he told us so. and he told us so through 5075 1 mrs. tullo. 2 remember when the surgeon general's report 3 came out mrs. tullo said she talked to her 4 husband about it. and he said, yes, i've read 5 about it, that is why i'm smoking a filtered 6 cigarette. he never said, you know, i saw this 7 ad for filtered cigarettes and that is why i'm 8 smoking it. he specifically told his wife, i 9 saw the surgeon general's report, i've heard the 10 message, and i am smoking a filtered cigarette. 11 now, let us take a step back here. with all 12 the talk about parliaments you might think that 13 those were the only filtered cigarettes that 14 mr. tullo smoked, and we know that is not right. 15 he also smoked kent filtered cigarettes and he 16 smoked marlboro filtered cigarettes. 17 now, admittedly, when mr. tullo started 18 smoking any brand of cigarettes is unclear at 19 best. but we do know when he was smoking a 20 specific filtered cigarette and that is marlboro 21 and it is from somewhere in the mid '60s to about 22 1970. 23 and how do we know that? 24 well, we know that from ms. casino, the 25 tullo's daughter. remember, she was born in 5076 1 1951 and she told you about the time that she 2 was 16 she started snitching cigarettes from her 3 dad. and she remembers that the cigarettes she 4 stole from her dad were marlboros. and she 5 remembers that because that is the brand she 6 stuck with her entire life until she quit 7 smoking the very first time she tried. 8 she has personal experience that makes her 9 able to give us a better time frame of when 10 mr. tullo was smoking a specific cigarette. 11 and what does ms. casino also tell us? that 12 he was still smoking marlboro cigarettes until 13 she left the house when she was 19 years old. 14 this was 1970. and so we know it is some time 15 after 1970 that mr. tullo switched to parliament 16 cigarettes. 17 and i want to read an instruction the judge 18 gave you. and that is the instruction the judge 19 gave you on warning labels. and what judge 20 sasser read to you was, "i instruct you that the 21 warning labels placed on cigarette packs and 22 advertisements by defendants complied with 23 federal law and defendants had no obligation to 24 place any additional warnings on their cigarette 25 packages and advertisements." 5077 1 and then doctor -- judge sasser also 2 instructed you, "i also instruct you that as 3 long as the cigarette packs bear the federally 4 mandated warnings," you have seen those, 5 "cigarette advertising from july 1, 1969 forward 6 cannot be the subject of any claim that the 7 advertising undermined or neutralized the 8 warnings or made them less effective." 9 so what does that tell you? all those ads 10 that dr. cummings showed you after '69, you 11 cannot take those ads under this instruction -- 12 mr. hammer: judge, can we approach? 13 (a bench conference occurred as follows:) 14 mr. hammer: that is not what the instruction 15 reads. what it means is we cannot -- as far as 16 the ads themselves, as far as whether or not 17 they may influence the jury, certainly that can 18 come into play. 19 the court: the argument -- the objection is 20 overruled. 21 (the bench conference ended.) 22 ms. gallagher: so what does this 23 instruction tell you? this instruction tells 24 you, from judge sasser, that you are not allowed 25 to say when an ad has a warning that the ad 5078 1 itself somehow cancelled out the warnings or 2 made it less effective. that is not allowed 3 under this instruction. 4 so let us get back to some time before 1970 5 when mr. tullo was smoking marlboros. after 6 some time in 1970 we know he started smoking 7 parliaments. and we know that before mr. tullo 8 smoked parliaments, he smoked marlboros and 9 before that, he smoked kents. 10 and we know from mrs. tullo that mr. tullo 11 switched to filtered cigarettes some time after 12 the surgeon general's report. 13 now, ask yourself, if he was smoking 14 parliament cigarettes because of the recessed 15 filter, why did he wait until 1970? 16 dr. cummings came in and showed you ads of the 17 recessed filter as far back as 1958. if 18 mr. tullo was affected or impacted in any way by 19 those ads, why did he wait 12 plus years to 20 start smoking parliament cigarettes? 21 ask yourself, if mr. tullo was so influenced 22 by these ads, like dr. cummings said, why did not 23 he start smoking filtered cigarettes back in the 24 1950s? he started smoking them after the 25 surgeon general's report. and it is funny, 5079 1 because although dr. cummings brought you all 2 these ads and talked about the wallpaper of ads 3 out there, when we asked him, okay, you cannot 4 tell us why mr. tullo switched from one filtered 5 brand to another, his answer was, no, i cannot 6 tell you that. 7 they cannot make the link between the 8 documents and the ads they brought you and 9 mr. tullo. 10 there is also another disconnect on the 11 testimony of recessed filters. mrs. tullo told 12 you that mr. tullo said he was smoking 13 parliament because of the recessed filter, but 14 that was only after mr. hammer had put those 15 words in her mouth. he said, did mr. tullo tell 16 you he was smoking parliament because of the 17 recessed filter? 18 and she said, oh, yeah, the recessed filter. 19 when i asked her questions, she admitted 20 that she heard the word "recessed" in this 21 courtroom, in the litigation world. that is 22 where the term "recessed" came up. 23 mr. tullo never said a word about recessed 24 filters. he never said a word about ads. what 25 mr. tullo talked about was i heard the public 5080 1 health community and that is why i started 2 smoking filtered cigarettes. 3 mr. tullo was not listening to the ads or 4 reading the ads or basing his decisions on 5 something that was in an advertisement. he was 6 smoking different filtered cigarettes until he 7 found the one he liked and that is the one he 8 stuck with. 9 now, you kind of had to listen carefully to 10 dr. cummings and dr. burns to really understand 11 what their criticism of filters is. because 12 they would agree that if you reduce tar, that is 13 a good thing; and if you reduce tar by using a 14 filtered cigarette, that is a good thing. what 15 their real criticism of filters is is that they 16 do not work for all smokers. and that is because 17 some smokers compensate. 18 and by compensating that means they are 19 trying to get more nicotine and so they smoke 20 differently than they did before. and so the 21 filters are not getting rid of the extra tar. 22 and there were two major ways you heard about 23 compensation, one is you go from a full-flavored 24 cigarette to a low-tar cigarette and you 25 increase the amount you are smoking. well, if 5081 1 you increase the amount you are smoking, you are 2 going to get more tar. 3 the second way that they told you about was 4 to inhale more deeply. if people took a 5 full-flavored cigarette and smoked it one way, 6 but then took a low-tar cigarette and smoked it 7 much more deeply, inhaled more deeply, then 8 they are going to get more tar. that is their 9 real criticism of filters. 10 now, if you listen to them, dr. cummings and 11 dr. burns, what they are trying to convince you 12 is that the tobacco companies were the only ones 13 out there who understood this concept of 14 compensation and that the tobacco companies 15 understood compensation and hid it. they hid it 16 from the public health community, did not tell 17 anybody about it. 18 well, we know that is just not true. in 19 fact, we know the opposite is true. the public 20 health community understood the concept of 21 compensation. 22 can i have the next slide, please? 23 a study of tobacco carcinogenesis. this is 24 from cancer from 1957. and in 1957 they are 25 talking about some numbers here about reduction 5082 1 of tar and it says, "a reduction to such level, 2 as both animal experiments and human statistical 3 studies show, will be followed by a significant 4 reduction in cancer risk provided the number of 5 cigarettes smoked is kept constant." 6 what is that? compensation. 7 1957 they are recognizing that if you lower 8 the tar, it is only going to reduce the risk if 9 you do not compensate. 10 1981, surgeon general's report -- i skipped 11 some decades for you all here, but they are back 12 there. 13 1981, surgeon general's report. again, 14 surgeon general says, "smokers who are unwilling 15 or as yet unable to quit are well advised to 16 switch to cigarettes yielding less tar and 17 nicotine, provided they do not increase their 18 smoking or change their smoking in other ways." 19 what is that? compensation. do not smoke 20 more cigarettes, do not inhale more deeply or 21 you are not getting the less-dangerous cigarette. 22 the lay press even reported on it. 23 can i have the next one, please. 24 terry qualifies filter tip reply. you have 25 seen this one already today. this is 1964. "a 5083 1 part of the problem here" -- this is the surgeon 2 general talking. "a part of the problem here is 3 whether the filter, in addition to removing tar 4 and nicotine or other elements of cigarette 5 smoke, might also lead to different levels of 6 cigarette consumption and different amounts of 7 inhalation." 8 what is the surgeon general talking about 9 here? compensation. 10 here we have consumer reports, not known for 11 its medical literature, but here's even consumer 12 reports reporting on this. "less tar, less 13 nicotine: is that good?" 14 "some smokers also increase the size of each 15 puff, thus increasing the nicotine per puff." 16 this is 1976. "there are also other ways to 17 compensate" -- they actually use the word -- 18 "for a drop in nicotine yield by drawing the 19 smoke deeper into the lungs, for example, or by 20 holding it there longer before exhaling." 21 there was no hiding by the tobacco companies 22 of this compensation. and, in fact, the tobacco 23 companies actually specifically told the 24 government about compensation. and you saw this 25 from the 1967, when ftc was thinking about tullo v r j reynolds - vol 34 - 04-12-2011 trial transcript 5084 1 developing or instituting the ogg method. and 2 this was so that there would be a uniform way to 3 measure the tar and nicotine in cigarettes and 4 put it on the packs. 5 so you saw these on the elmo. this is the 6 federal trade commission submission, remember, i 7 flipped to the back and it was all the different 8 tobacco companies. and they submitted this to 9 the ftc when the ftc was thinking about adopting 10 this. and the tobacco companies are telling the 11 ftc, "the ogg method, in fact, does not and 12 cannot measure either all of the particulate 13 matter or the total nicotine from any cigarette. 14 it measures only the particulate matter and 15 nicotine in the volume of smoke puffed through a 16 machine on the standardized method. it does not 17 measure the pm or nicotine in all of the smoke 18 that any cigarette might produce when totally 19 smoked under any and all conditions." 20 in other words, it is going to tell you what 21 the machine gets, it is not going to tell you 22 what each individual smoker gets. 23 well, did the ftc understand this? 24 can i have the next one, please, jenn. 25 let us look at the federal trade commission 5085 1 news release. it starts with, "the cambridge 2 filter method does not and cannot measure these 3 many variations in human smoking habits." 4 does not that kind of sound like what tobacco 5 companies submitted to them. 6 "thus" -- and here's what they tell you the 7 purpose of putting these numbers on is -- "the 8 purpose of testing is not to determine the 9 amount of tar and nicotine inhaled by any human 10 smoker, but rather to determine the amount of 11 tar and nicotine generated when a cigarette is 12 smoked by machine in accordance with the 13 prescribed method." 14 they recognize exactly what the tobacco 15 companies told them. 16 let us look at the next one, please, jenn. 17 here we have the federal trade commission 18 submission. again, this is from the tobacco 19 companies to the trade commission. and they are 20 going through here and they say, "no two human 21 smokers smoke in the same way. no individual 22 smoker always smokes in the same fashion. the 23 speed at which one smokes varies both among 24 smokers and usually also varies with the same 25 individual under different circumstances even 5086 1 within the same day. some take long puffs or 2 draws. some take short puffs. the variation 3 affects the pm quantity in the smoke generated." 4 what does the ftc press release say? 5 can i have the next one. 6 it is kind of hard to tell the difference. 7 it is almost word for word is what the ftc says 8 in its press release. 9 this was not the tobacco companies hiding 10 the fact of compensation from the government. 11 here is the most direct evidence of them 12 actually telling the federal trade commission. 13 the federal trade commission acknowledging it 14 and putting it out in its press release. and 15 this was not something new, this goes back to 16 the '50s. compensation was understood. 17 now, let us get away from the litigation 18 world and go back to the real world where 19 mr. tullo was living. because compensation was 20 not part of mr. tullo's world. 21 first of all, we know over the years that 22 mr. tullo smoked parliaments, the nicotine and 23 tar levels went down. and i showed you -- i had 24 to write this down, i can never remember the 25 name of this document -- the directory of 5087 1 cigarette brands from 1864 to 1997. and that 2 was the piece of paper that listed the various 3 cigarettes and it would have the year and it 4 would have the tar and nicotine levels on it. 5 and then i showed you this graph. and this is a 6 summary of what is in that document. and in 1970 7 parliaments had 18.9, almost 19 milligrams of 8 tar. by 1995 it was 11, a little more than 9 half. 10 the nicotine had fallen from 1.25 to .09 11 [sic]. so what does that tell us? it tells us 12 mr. tullo was getting less tar and nicotine, in 13 fact, he was getting percentage-wise less tar in 14 1995 and more nicotine if you look at the 15 numbers. 16 now, the plaintiffs want you to believe that 17 mr. tullo must have compensated. but what do 18 they do when they do that? they ignore what 19 people have said about mr. tullo's smoking. 20 because those people who knew mr. tullo said he 21 always smoked the same. it did not matter if he 22 was smoking filtered cigarettes or unfiltered 23 cigarettes, he smoked the same amount. 24 when he switched from unfiltered to 25 filtered, he did not start smoking more. 5088 1 everybody says he smoked the same amount. 2 and what do we know about the way mr. tullo 3 smoked? again, you ask the people who knew him. 4 because they all said, did not matter what 5 cigarette he was smoking, did not matter if it 6 was a filtered cigarette, an unfiltered 7 cigarette, cigarette he was smoking in the '50s 8 or the '80s, he inhaled them so deeply his 9 cheeks sank in. that is inhaling pretty hard, 10 ladies and gentlemen, and that is something that 11 the people who knew him saw. 12 in the real world mr. tullo was not 13 compensating. mr. tullo smoked the same number 14 of cigarettes and he smoked them in the same 15 way. so dr. burns and dr. cummings' criticism 16 that filters are no good is based on 17 compensation. and compensation is not part of 18 mr. tullo's world. it is in the litigation world 19 of dr. cummings. 20 one other thing on this government issue. 21 if the government really thought that they were 22 being duped by this filter issue, then why 23 did not they issue two sets of warnings? if the 24 government really thought that -- 25 mr. hammer: judge, can we approach? 5089 1 the court: certainly. 2 (a bench conference occurred as follows:) 3 mr. hammer: judge, that is totally 4 inappropriate. we cannot challenge the warnings. 5 the warnings were not effective or were not 6 sufficient. the defense cannot get up here and 7 say the government should have given two sets of 8 warnings. it is their motion. it is their motion 9 and they are violating the court's ruling. 10 ms. gallagher: i do not understand that 11 objection. 12 mr. gdanski: cannot use the warnings as both 13 a sword and a shield. it is used as a shield 14 against us and as a sword to say the government 15 should have given different warnings. we cannot 16 question the warnings. there should not be a 17 suggestion of alternative warnings. if the 18 court is going to permit alternative warnings -- 19 ms. gallagher: that is not what i was 20 suggesting, your honor. if they just listen, 21 they would see -- 22 the court: that is not what she said. 23 mr. gdanski: can we get a preview -- 24 the court: you are not saying there should 25 have been a different warning. 5090 1 ms. gallagher: not at all. 2 mr. gdanski: her last words were -- 3 the court: if she does, then come up, but 4 that is not what she said. 5 objection overruled. 6 (the bench conference ended.) 7 ms. gallagher: as i was saying, ladies and 8 gentlemen, if the government thought they were 9 duped, if there was some idea that this whole 10 compensation thing was hidden, that there was a 11 difference, the government understood that there 12 were dangerous cigarettes, whether they were 13 filtered or unfiltered, because nobody ever said 14 that filtered cigarettes were safe. 15 let us look at the warning. 16 1966 to 1969, "caution: cigarette smoking 17 may be hazardous to your health." 18 this warning went on every package of 19 cigarettes whether they were filtered or 20 unfiltered. 21 from 1970 to 1984, "the surgeon general has 22 determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous 23 to your health." 24 they did not just go on unfiltered 25 cigarettes, it went on every cigarette package 5091 1 in the united states. 2 the same with the next set of warnings where 3 it says, "quitting smoking now greatly reduces 4 serious risks to your health." 5 " surgeon general's warning: smoking causes 6 lung cancer." this went on every pack of 7 cigarettes in the united states. the warnings 8 were not just for unfiltered cigarettes. the 9 warnings were telling the american public, it 10 does not matter what kind of cigarettes you 11 smoke, they are dangerous. 12 this case is not about whether mr. tullo 13 knew cigarettes were dangerous and addictive; he 14 did. 15 this case is not about whether mr. tullo 16 smoked filtered cigarettes because of ads, 17 because we know he did not. 18 and it is surely not about whether low-tar 19 cigarettes are safe, because we know they are 20 not. he was never smoking a safe cigarette. 21 so now that i've spent all this time telling 22 you what this case is not about, what is this 23 case really about? and this case is about 24 whether mr. tullo was addicted and whether his 25 addiction was the legal cause of his lung cancer 5092 1 and death. that is the question you have to 2 answer. that is the very first question on the 3 verdict form. 4 now, you will notice in the instructions that 5 judge sasser gave you that there is no legal 6 definition of addiction. there are lots of 7 definitions in there for other things, but there 8 is no definition of addiction. and you have heard 9 various tests and criteria used by different 10 people in this courtroom to tell you what their 11 definition of addiction is, but you know they are 12 not always correct, because the definition that 13 dr. cummings likes to use, he told you under 14 that definition mrs. tullo is addicted. and she 15 told you that is just not right. she is never 16 been addicted to smoking. 17 well, one of the things that dr. burns and 18 cummings say that you look at to determine if 19 someone is addicted is how much they smoke, how 20 many cigarettes do they smoke. 21 now, dr. burns told you it was between one 22 and two packs per day. and dr. cummings told 23 you that it was over two packs per day. 24 now, why does dr. cummings pick the highest 25 number, two packs per day plus is what he said, 5093 1 which is not even ms. tullo's testimony that it 2 was two packs a day, because dr. cummings, the 3 tobacco advocate -- anti-tobacco advocate, the 4 general in the war on tobacco, cherry picks the 5 evidence that supports his opinions in the 6 litigation world and ignores the rest. 7 well, what did dr. cummings ignore? for 8 one, we have the medical records. all of the 9 medical records we have we have shown you that 10 talk about how much mr. tullo smoked. and it is 11 all a pack a day or less. 12 here is, in 1995, you cannot see it, but 13 you will have the record back there, may of 1995 14 when mr. tullo first goes to see dr. levine and 15 he tells her he smokes one pack of cigarettes 16 every two days. and now dr. cummings says, 17 well, i do not believe that, because smokers lie 18 to their doctors about how much they smoke. 19 well, let us look at his other records. here 20 it is, and this is after he has been diagnosed, 21 he tells his doctors he used to smoke one pack 22 per day. 23 and the next one, please, jenn. 24 another record, smoking history of one pack 25 per day. this is right after he quit, stopped 5094 1 two days ago. 2 and the next one. 3 he quit smoking about a month ago. that was 4 from july of '96, this is august of '96. he 5 quit smoking about a month ago after smoking a 6 pack a day. 7 i think we have one more. and here -- 8 sorry. never mind. thought we had one more. 9 now, dr. cummings says that smokers lie to 10 their doctors about how much they smoke. why 11 would mr. tullo lie to his doctors after he is 12 been diagnosed and after he quit? that just 13 does not make sense. 14 dr. burns at least acknowledged that the 15 medical records were in there when he said one 16 pack a day to two packs a day. but dr. burns, 17 who has made over a million and a half dollars 18 testifying in the litigation world, also ignores 19 evidence that does not fit with his position. 20 so let us start with who says it was two 21 packs a day? the only person who has told you 22 that is mrs. tullo. all of the other family 23 members say, we do not remember, we remember it 24 was a lot, but we have no idea how much it was 25 per day. and mrs. tullo is not really sure 5095 1 either, just that it was a lot. and it is 2 understandable that she cannot recall exactly, 3 because it is been a long time. 4 mrs. tullo cannot even recall how much she 5 smoked. you heard in her deposition testimony 6 that we read that she said she smoked two 7 cigarettes her whole life. then when she was on 8 the stand she said she smoked a cigarette every 9 day for some period of time. and yet her family 10 remembers -- her family members remember her 11 smoking three cigarettes a day, smoking 12 socially. it is been a long time. 13 the one thing that does not make sense is why 14 dr. cummings and burns would ignore the philip 15 morris surveys when trying to decide how much 16 mr. tullo actually smoked, because that is 17 mr. tullo himself. 18 if i can get conner's assistance for this. 19 you have seen this form. and mrs. tullo has 20 told you that although her name is down there, 21 mary tullo, that this was actually filled out by 22 her husband, mr. tullo. and in that form it 23 asks, "what are you smoking?" 24 and it says, "parliament." 25 i know this is difficult for you all to 5096 1 read, but you will have it back there. 2 one of the questions is, "how many packs of 3 cigarettes have you smoked in the last two 4 weeks?" 5 and what does mr. tullo write down? "10." 6 that is a little less than a pack a day. which 7 is consistent with what he was telling his 8 doctors. 9 dr. cummings completely ignores that. and 10 dr. burns does not use it either, because he says 11 it is at least a pack a day. this is mr. tullo 12 telling philip morris how much he smoked in the 13 last two weeks. why would he lie to philip 14 morris about how much he is smoking? this is to 15 get free cigarettes. 16 and then we have the second survey. 17 it is a little unclear who completed this 18 survey. mrs. tullo has said this is her 19 signature, that she signed this. she has said 20 it is not her signature, that she did not sign 21 this. and she has also said, well, maybe a 22 little bit of this is mine, but she does not know 23 which little bit. 24 well, conner, would you put up the... 25 this is the handwritten list, you saw this 5097 1 earlier. this is the handwritten list that 2 mrs. tullo wrote when she was writing down to 3 help her memory the cigarettes that mr. tullo 4 smoked that she could recall. and i want you, 5 when you get back there, look at the two 6 marlboros and then look at the two parliaments 7 and see if you do not think that mrs. tullo is 8 actually the one who filled out this form. 9 mr. hammer: judge, can we approach? 10 the court: sure. 11 (a bench conference occurred as follows:) 12 mr. hammer: judge, defense made a big issue 13 and took up a lot of time during this trial 14 about a handwriting expert. they had one. we 15 deposed him. that expert who looked at these 16 documents -- they have to make a good faith 17 argument -- that expert who looked at these 18 documents could not even tell with any kind of 19 certainty whose writing this was. and now 20 they are making an argument that is totally 21 disingenuous to this jury and asking them to do 22 something that their own expert could not do. 23 ms. gallagher: your honor, i do not 24 understand what the objection is and she did 25 testify at one point that she filled this out. 5098 1 the court: she testified during the 2 deposition and the jury heard the testimony. 3 mr. hammer: judge, ms. tullo explained her 4 answer, but more importantly, now they are asking 5 this jury to compare handwriting when they know 6 their own expert, who was supposedly an expert 7 in the field, could not even make an 8 identification. it is inappropriate. 9 ms. gallagher: he could make the 10 identification, it is just when i saw this i 11 realized we did not need a handwriting expert. 12 the court: objection is overruled. 13 (the bench conference ended.) 14 ms. gallagher: all right. so let us look at 15 this document. and the reason i bring this to 16 your attention is because it says "parliament" 17 and it says "1 pack per day." 18 if mrs. tullo filled this out, then at the 19 time she wrote this she said her husband smoked 20 1 pack per day. in the litigation world here 21 she is telling you two packs per day in this 22 lawsuit, a lawsuit that has been brought years 23 and years and years after these forms were 24 filled out. a lawsuit that is been brought years 25 and years and years after those medical records 5099 1 were filled out. and a lawsuit brought against 2 the same company from which she got free 3 cigarettes for her husband. 4 thank you for your technical assistance. 5 now, another thing that dr. cummings tells 6 you to look at to see whether someone is 7 addicted is whether someone is in control of 8 their smoking. and there is not really a whole 9 lot of evidence on this point. you heard from 10 louis tullo, mr. tullo's son, that he could go 11 to movies, he would go out to eat, that he would 12 go to weddings and he would not smoke. 13 mr. tullo also told you that when he was at 14 his son's house -- or when his dad was at his 15 house he would ask him not to smoke around the 16 children, not to smoke in the house and 17 mr. tullo would comply. 18 now, these are examples of mr. tullo being 19 in control of his smoking. 20 for example, what did he do when he was at 21 the un working? we have no idea. there is no 22 evidence on that. 23 and ladies and gentlemen, remember, it is 24 the plaintiff's burden of proof here. if you 25 have a question that cannot be answered such as 5100 1 was mr. tullo in control of his smoking, you 2 cannot fill in what you think the evidence might 3 be. the plaintiff's attorneys have the burden 4 of proof in this case and it is to prove their 5 entire case to you, not just part of it, but the 6 entire case. 7 so let me get back to addiction. because, 8 you know, whatever definition of addiction you 9 use, it really does not matter, because whether 10 you believe that mr. tullo was addicted, the 11 question you have to answer was: was that 12 addiction the legal cause of his lung cancer? 13 and the answer to that is no, because everything 14 i'm about to say applies whether mr. tullo was 15 addicted to cigarettes or was not addicted to 16 cigarettes. 17 in the litigation world, dr. burns and 18 dr. cummings say, without having met mr. tullo, 19 we can tell you that he could not quit because he 20 was suffering from cognitive dissonance, that he 21 used a psychological crutch that kept him from 22 being able to quit. and that -- this is again 23 the missing link thing, because the cognitive 24 dissonance, the psychological crutch that was 25 all created by the ads or statements that they 5101 1 cannot say mr. tullo ever saw or heard. 2 plaintiffs have the burden of proof in this 3 case and they have put on no evidence that 4 mr. tullo saw or heard a single thing their 5 experts spent four days on the stand telling you 6 about. 7 and there is probably one part of 8 dr. cummings' and burns' testimony that left you 9 maybe a little perplexed. and that is both of 10 them said by 1998, 45 million smokers had quit 11 permanently. they also both told you any smoker 12 can quit, addicted or not, any smoker can quit. 13 what dr. cummings and burns cannot explain 14 is how those 45 million people, who were 15 presumably exposed to all of the same things 16 that mr. tullo was exposed to, quit permanently. 17 forty-five million smokers, the great 18 majority of them addicted, many of them heavily 19 addicted, all quit by 1998. they gave you no 20 reason, no explanation for why mr. tullo 21 could not have been one of those 45 million 22 people before 1996. 23 let us go back to the real world. you heard 24 that ms. tullo said she thinks mr. tullo tried 25 to quit smoking a few times in new york. she 5102 1 also says that she thinks mr. tullo might have 2 fibbed to her, that she could still smell 3 cigarettes on him and she told you that she did 4 not think that mr. tullo gave smoking [sic] a 5 very good try. 6 and we have gone through this. somebody has 7 to want to quit in order to stop smoking. 8 that is common sense. 9 well, what do we know about mr. tullo and 10 his attempts to quit smoking. 11 what he reported to dr. levine was that he 12 had considered quitting, but he was too anxious. 13 and by the way, he never told dr. levine, do not 14 worry, i'm smoking a filtered cigarette. all he 15 said was that he had considered quitting. 16 considered is thought about. remember with 17 dr. cummings, you can consider something, you 18 decide something and then you act on it. you 19 do not go on a diet, you do not start an exercise 20 program, you do not eat healthier by thinking 21 about it; you have to decide you are going to do 22 it and you have to take action. 23 what we know from dr. cummings, he told you 24 the best evidence of motivation, if somebody is 25 going to quit smoking, is the number of quit 5103 1 attempts made. in other words, dr. cummings 2 says the best thing to see if somebody is 3 actually motivated is how many times they 4 actually try to quit smoking. and what do we 5 know about mr. tullo? that in 60 years he tried 6 three times. 7 now, ask yourself this, if you were 8 unemployed for 60 years and you tried to find a 9 job three times, do you think you would be trying 10 very hard? 11 now, we had the smart move. 12 would you just put that up real quick. 13 think about when mr. tullo was in new york. 14 do you want to stop smoking? there is no 15 indication that he actually did. 16 "are you willing to make some changes in 17 your daily routine?" 18 remember, this was all about triggers, that 19 if you smoke, there are certain things and 20 certain people, certain situations that are 21 going to make you think of a cigarette, like if 22 you have always smoked when you have coffee in the 23 morning, you are going to have to do something 24 with the coffee because it is going to give you 25 the trigger to want to smoke again. there is no 5104 1 evidence in this record whatsoever that 2 mr. tullo did anything to get rid of the 3 triggers for smoking. 4 "are you willing to put up with some uneasy 5 moments after stopping?" 6 well, we really do not know because we are not 7 for sure that he went for a whole day without 8 smoking when he was in new york. we do know 9 that when he quit smoking in florida after his 10 diagnosis there is no report in the medical 11 records of any withdrawal symptoms. and 12 ms. tullo certainly did not testify to you about 13 any withdrawal symptoms he had after he quit 14 permanently. 15 and there is another reason, there is another 16 reason that dr. burns' and dr. cummings' 17 opinions that mr. tullo was unable to quit makes 18 no sense. and it is a big reason. and that is 19 that he actually quit. when mr. tullo was 20 motivated to quit after he got his diagnosis, he 21 quit. he put the cigarettes down. 22 now, the plaintiff's attorneys have tried to 23 tell you, well, he did not really quit, that he 24 just cut back after his diagnosis. well, let us 25 get out of the litigation world and look at the tullo v r j reynolds - vol 34 - 04-12-2011 trial transcript 5105 1 facts. because the facts are that mrs. tullo 2 saw him smoke one cigarette. amy miller saw him 3 smoke one cigarette. mrs. tullo found a pack of 4 cigarettes in the car. in a period of a year 5 and a half mr. tullo smoked two or three 6 cigarettes. that is the evidence in this case. 7 and you know he was not smoking regularly and 8 we know that from mrs. tullo. remember how 9 mrs. tullo told you she hated the smell of 10 cigarettes, his breath smelled like cigarettes, 11 his clothes smelled like cigarettes, he smelled 12 like cigarettes. remember what she told you 13 when she saw him smoking outside of the publix, 14 when she saw him smoking a cigarette after his 15 diagnosis? she was angry and she was surprised. 16 if he had been smoking regularly, she would not 17 have been surprised. she would have smelled it 18 on him. remember, she hated that smell. she 19 was surprised when she found the pack of 20 cigarettes in the car. and she was surprised 21 because she knew he had quit. 22 mr. tullo quit smoking cigarettes. he 23 smoked a couple in the year-and-a-half after his 24 diagnosis, but he had quit. this is not a 25 situation where he had cut down and was still 5106 1 smoking regularly. he had quit. 2 so let us go back to that first question you 3 have to answer: was mr. tullo's addiction to 4 nicotine the legal cause of his death? 5 now, legal cause, you have heard the 6 definition of, that it requires a substantial 7 and direct impact. 8 i was going to put it on the elmo, but -- 9 oh. jenn has more faith in my capabilities. 10 okay. is the legal cause of death, if it 11 directly and in natural and continuous sequence 12 produces or contributes substantially to 13 producing such death so that but for the 14 addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine, the 15 death would not have occurred. you have to have 16 a direct and substantial impact. 17 and the answer to that question is no. 18 because you heard dr. cummings and dr. burns 19 both talk about declining risk. 20 do you remember declining risk? this is 21 with dr. burns. and what he was explaining was 22 that there is excess risk of smoking for getting 23 various diseases including lung cancer, but if 24 you quit, your excess risk goes way down so that 25 by the time you get 20 to 30 years out, your 5107 1 risk, excess risk is almost that of a 2 never-smoker. 3 well, think about if mr. tullo had quit 4 smoking in 1964 when the surgeon general told 5 him to, when his wife told him to, that was 32 6 years before he was diagnosed. 7 mr. tullo's addiction, if you believe he was 8 addicted, was not the substantial and direct 9 cause of his lung cancer; his failure to quit 10 was. he was not so addicted that he could not 11 quit, because we know he did quit. 12 if he had been motivated to quit back in the 13 '60s, there is nothing to suggest that he 14 would not have been successful, like he was later 15 on when he did quit. 16 he had the ability to quit and he 17 demonstrated that ability. 18 now, mr. hammer put up all those other 19 questions for you, and in the interest of time, 20 i'm not going to go through them all again. i 21 just want to point out one major thing that he 22 left out. he talked to you about the findings 23 and he said you have the findings and you should 24 say yes, they were negligent; yes, there is a 25 defect in the product. he forgot one very 5108 1 important thing, because the findings are not 2 enough for you to say yes to those questions. 3 mr. hammer: objection. can we approach, 4 please? 5 the court: sure. 6 (a bench conference occurred as follows:) 7 mr. gdanski: judge, what counsel just did 8 is question the findings. mr. hammer did not 9 say that they should say that they were 10 negligent or they were defective because there is 11 a finding of negligence, a finding of defect. 12 so what counsel just did was inherently question 13 this court's ruling that the findings are 14 binding that they were, in fact, negligent and 15 they are in fact. 16 ms. gallagher: i said that is not 17 sufficient. 18 mr. gdanski: what she just said to the 19 jury -- and i can check the transcript. 20 ms. gallagher: i do not understand the 21 objection. 22 mr. gdanski: the objection is that counsel 23 has violated the court's ruling on questioning 24 the findings. and the transcript, i believe, 25 will substantiate that, but it has nothing to do 5109 1 with legal cause. i know that is where she is 2 going, but the predicate should be: we were 3 negligent, but you need to decide if that 4 negligence was a legal cause. what was just 5 asked to the jury was: you need to decide if we 6 were negligent, and that is improper. 7 ms. gallagher: your honor, if he would let 8 me get to my next statement, it would be that it 9 requires legal cause, it is not enough, which is 10 what your instructions tell them to answer those 11 questions yes. 12 mr. gdanski: that does not matter because 13 the first statement is improper. i can check 14 the transcript right now. it is improper. the 15 findings have just been challenged and, you 16 know, do not really know how to respond to that. 17 the court: that is not how i heard it. she 18 was going towards legal cause. 19 mr. gdanski: that is fine, i'll take a 20 minute and look at the transcript right now. 21 i'll reserve on all my motions that i'd like to 22 make relative to that. 23 (the bench conference ended.) 24 ms. gallagher: like i was saying, ladies 25 and gentlemen, the findings that judge sasser 5110 1 read to you and the findings that mr. hammer 2 told you are not sufficient for you to answer 3 those questions yet, because they require 4 something else. and what they require is 5 something that mr. hammer did not talk to you 6 about and that is legal cause. every single one 7 of those questions requires legal cause. 8 and you were probably wondering why every 9 time you got a new instruction or a new 10 definition, a new question, you got a separate 11 instruction and definition on legal cause, 12 because it is required in all of those questions. 13 and because all of those questions require 14 legal cause, the answer to all of those 15 questions is no, just like the answer to the 16 first question is no. because nothing that the 17 tobacco companies said or did or did not say or 18 did not do was a legal cause of mr. tullo's 19 death. the fact that tobacco companies sold 20 cigarettes is not enough to answer any of those 21 questions yes. and as i said, the existence of 22 the findings are not enough to answer those 23 questions yes, you have to find that there was a 24 legal cause of mr. tullo's death, a direct and 25 substantial impact. 5111 1 and it is just not there. 2 now, i want to talk to you a minute about 3 the concealment question. and rather than put 4 it on the elmo, there are two concealment 5 questions. and they say, "please state for each 6 defendant" -- and one is a little bit 7 different -- "whether dominick tullo reasonably 8 relied to his detriment on an act done in 9 furtherance of the defendants' agreement to 10 conceal or omit material information concerning 11 the health effects and/or addictive nature of 12 smoking cigarettes and, if so, whether such 13 reliance was a legal cause of his death." 14 and what i want to talk to you about here is 15 something that plaintiff's experts told you and 16 the plaintiff's attorneys agree with. and that 17 is that this supposed agreement to conceal 18 started in 1954. no one has told you that the 19 tobacco companies concealed anything before 20 1954. 21 and why is that important? because both 22 dr. burns and dr. cummings told you that by 1954 23 mr. tullo had started smoking cigarettes, 24 mr. tullo had become a regular smoker and 25 mr. tullo was addicted to cigarettes. 5112 1 the plaintiff's experts and attorneys are 2 not saying that anything the tobacco companies 3 said, did or supposedly concealed caused 4 mr. tullo to start smoking or to become an 5 addicted smoker. 6 let me say that again. 7 nothing that the tobacco companies did 8 caused mr. tullo to start smoking or to become 9 an addicted smoker. so we are back to the very 10 same question. and that is, did anything the 11 tobacco companies said or do, not say or not do 12 have a direct and substantial impact on 13 mr. tullo and his decisions about quitting? and 14 i've talked at length about that and the answer 15 is still no. 16 now, there is another part of those questions 17 and that is: did mr. tullo rely on anything the 18 tobacco companies said? 19 now, we get back to the plaintiff's 20 attorneys have not proved to you that mr. tullo 21 heard anything the tobacco companies said, much 22 less that he relied on anything the tobacco 23 companies said. and that is their burden of 24 proof for you. they have to prove that to you 25 and they have failed to. 5113 1 what do we know about mr. tullo? we know he 2 was his own man. he was a smart man, a man who 3 made his own decisions and a man who kept up 4 with current events, a man who would not be told 5 what to do. he did not listen to his wife, to 6 his family, to the surgeon general or the public 7 health community when they told him to quit 8 smoking. 9 mrs. tullo told you that mr. tullo did not 10 listen to anyone, not that he did not listen to 11 anyone except the tobacco companies. he made 12 his own decisions. people have the right to 13 make the decision as to whether to smoke or not 14 to smoke, but mr. tullo made the decision to 15 continue to smoke. and he is the one who is 16 responsible for that decision. 17 now, mr. hammer talked to you about the 18 percentage question and i want to address that 19 pretty quickly for you. and i would submit that 20 you put, if you get there, and i do not think you 21 get there, because i think you answer the first 22 question no and you are done. but as i told you 23 in voir dire, i've got to talk about all the 24 issues here, so i've got to talk about these 25 questions. 5114 1 on the percentage question you put 100 2 percent, if you get there, next to mr. tullo's 3 name. and the reason is that the plaintiff's 4 attorneys have admitted, and i'll read this to 5 you, this was an instruction from the judge, "i 6 instruct you that the plaintiff has admitted 7 that dominick tullo shares some measure of 8 responsibility in combination with the acts and 9 omissions of the defendants. specifically, 10 plaintiff has admitted that mr. tullo's acts or 11 omissions" -- 12 mr. hammer: judge, sorry, can we approach 13 minute. 14 (a bench conference occurred as follows:) 15 mr. hammer: judge, this was the exact 16 conversation we had about the use of this 17 instruction and that how the defendants were 18 going to try to use it, which is why we made 19 that argument. and i have to object to preserve 20 the record. and, again, renewing our request 21 for that additional instruction, especially in 22 light of this argument now. 23 ms. gallagher: i do not know what he is 24 talking about. we have got the instructions. i'm 25 reading them to the jury. 5115 1 the court: she is reading the instructions. 2 objection is overruled. 3 (the bench conference ended.) 4 ms. gallagher: "specifically, plaintiff has 5 admitted that mr. tullo's acts or omissions 6 relating to the frequency and duration of his 7 efforts to quit smoking were a partial legal 8 cause of his death." 9 so what are the plaintiffs saying here? 10 what has -- what is this admission? well, one, 11 they are saying mr. tullo is partially 12 responsible because he did not try enough times 13 to quit and he did not last long enough when he 14 tried. the legal cause part of that, because it 15 says the partial legal cause, is that those 16 actions were a legal cause of his death. and, 17 in other words, what they are telling you is that 18 mr. tullo could have quit and if he had quit 19 earlier, he would not have gotten lung cancer 20 and death. that is what it means when they say 21 it is a partial legal cause. he could have quit 22 smoking in time to avoid getting lung cancer and 23 die. 24 mr. tullo could have quit smoking earlier 25 and that is his responsibility. he could have 5116 1 quit smoking in time to avoid his lung cancer 2 and death, that is legal cause. 3 it boils down to one simple thing, the 4 plaintiff's attorneys are admitting that 5 mr. tullo should and could have quit smoking 6 decades ago when everyone told him to and that is 7 his responsibility. 8 now, the plaintiff's lawyers want you to put 9 some of the responsibility on the tobacco 10 companies, but, again, they are not saying that 11 the tobacco companies are responsible for 12 mr. tullo starting to smoke or mr. tullo 13 becoming addicted. what they are saying is 14 tobacco companies are responsible for 15 mr. tullo's failure to quit. and the evidence 16 in this case is mr. tullo could quit, he did 17 quit and he decided when to quit. the tobacco 18 companies had nothing to do with that. 19 and that is why you put one hundred percent next to 20 his name. 21 now, mr. hammer talked to you some about the 22 damages question. all i want to say on that is 23 mrs. tullo has been blessed with a strong 24 support group of family and friends. and she 25 has been able to return to the activities she 5117 1 enjoyed, doing her friends' hair, going to the 2 pool. she has returned to activities she liked 3 and she has had strong support from her family 4 since mr. tullo passed. but one thing i want to 5 point out here is that you cannot let sympathy 6 play any part in your deliberations. that is 7 not something that you can use when you are 8 deciding questions in this case. i think 9 everybody would agree that mrs. tullo is a nice 10 lady and we all like her, but you cannot decide 11 the case on that. that is what makes sitting in 12 your chairs hard. because you have to put that 13 aside and decide this case on the evidence. 14 the last question talks about entitlement to 15 punitive damages. i want to talk a little bit 16 about the findings again, because the findings 17 are there, but they do not mean that the answer 18 to that question is yes, because it requires 19 more. 20 there is a different burden of proof. it has 21 to be clear and convincing evidence, which is 22 precise, exact, of such weight to produce a firm 23 belief or conviction. and they have to show 24 you -- 25 mr. gdanski: we need to approach. 5118 1 (a bench conference occurred as follows:) 2 ms. gallagher: i'm reading from the 3 instructions again. what did i do wrong this 4 time? 5 mr. hammer: he is looking at the 6 instructions. 7 ms. gallagher: it is in there. 8 mr. hammer: all right. i just want to make 9 sure. 10 (the bench conference ended.) 11 ms. gallagher: that is the different burden 12 of proof for this question. and it is not enough 13 that we have an individual against corporations 14 here, because judge sasser has instructed you 15 that you have to treat all the parties the same. 16 and it is not enough that you say, i do not like 17 some conduct of the tobacco companies in the 18 past, you have to find conduct within the 19 instructions that judge sasser gave you. and, 20 again, you have to find that it was a legal 21 cause of mr. tullo's lung cancer and death and 22 that is just not here, ladies and gentlemen. the 23 plaintiffs have not proved that to you. 24 i want to ask you to put aside the 25 litigation world that was created in this 5119 1 courtroom and look at the real world of 2 mr. tullo. ignore the world that has no 3 connection to mr. tullo, no link to mr. tullo. 4 in the end when you look at the evidence, it is 5 clear that mr. tullo knew smoking was dangerous, 6 he knew it was addictive. he could quit and he 7 did quit. mr. tullo made the decision when to 8 stop smoking. nothing the tobacco companies 9 said or did not say had anything to do with the 10 decisions mr. tullo made. he made his own 11 decisions and he is the one who is responsible 12 for them. 13 ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much 14 for your attention. thank you for participating 15 in the jury trial process. on behalf of 16 mr. fasi, on philip morris and myself, thank you 17 very much. 9 mr. bideau: counsel, mrs. tullo. 10 good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 11 (jury collectively: good morning.) 12 mr. bideau: it is nice to finally get to talk 13 to you right off; where i look down as you walk in 14 the hallway or get on the elevator downstairs. 15 you have not seen much of me, i have not been up 16 here very much to talk. and i'm not going to be 17 very long. 18 ms. gallagher gave a very compelling and a 19 very comprehensive closing argument in this case 20 and discussed really a lot of the issues -- 21 mr. hammer: judge, can we approach? 22 the court: yes. 23 (sidebar held as follows:) 24 mr. hammer: it is inappropriate for a 25 codefendant to comment on one of their 5163 1 codefendants. 2 mr. bideau: i was trying to explain why i'm 3 not going to talk to them as long on every subject. 4 mr. hammer: a compelling argument, that is 5 inappropriate. she covered all the points i was 6 going to cover; but to make a comment on quality 7 and on what you thought -- 8 the court: let us move on. 9 mr. bideau: yeah, i will. 10 (sidebar concluded and the following was held 11 in open court:) 12 mr. bideau: let me join mr. hammer and 13 ms. gallagher in thanking you for your time, for 14 your service and for your patience. i will try to 15 move this case along. i know it is not fun sitting 16 back in the jury room or sitting out in the 17 hallway, but we have tried to move the case along, 18 and we appreciate your time and your patience. 19 yesterday ms. gallagher discussed with you 20 mr. tullo's smoking history, discussed his 21 decision-making, she discussed what was in the 22 public arena concerning the dangers of smoking, 23 going back really to christopher columbus. 24 she also discussed the issues relating to the 25 plaintiffs claim about filter fraud and why there is 5164 1 just no basis for that claim, and so i'm not going 2 to talk about those subjects in any great detail. 3 i'm going to do what i did in my opening, 4 which is really focus on my client, lorillard. 5 because you have not heard much about us in this 6 case. you have not seen many documents related to 7 lorillard and, frankly, you have not heard many 8 witnesses talk about lorillard. 9 give me the first slide. 10 yesterday mr. hammer acknowledged that 11 mr. tullo smoked lorillard product for what he 12 called a little, a short period of time. well, the 13 facts in this case are that the only brand of 14 cigarettes that lorillard manufactured that are the 15 issue in this case are kent. and the facts are 16 also that mr. tullo smoked kent for, at most, a 17 three-year period in the mid '60s. that was 30 18 years after he began smoking and he was in his 40s 19 at the time. 20 and as i explain to you in a few minutes, kent 21 could not have caused his injury or his addiction 22 in this case. 23 yesterday mr. hammer said to you that 24 mr. tullo smoked kent in 1958. folks, there is no 25 evidence whatsoever with respect to mr. tullo 5165 1 smoking kent in 1958. two witnesses have come 2 before you to talk about when mr. tullo smoked 3 kent. stephanie casino, his daughter, and 4 mary tullo. 5 and what stephanie casino told us was she said 6 that she recalled her father smoke kent when she 7 was adolescent, 11, 12, 13, that time period which 8 would have put us in the '63, '64 time period. 9 mrs. tullo testified she did not really 10 remember when he started smoking kent or how many 11 kents he smoked, but she did testify very clearly 12 that he did not smoke a filtered cigarette until 13 after the surgeon general's report in 1964. kent 14 is and always has been a filtered cigarette. 15 those are the only two witnesses you ever 16 heard from with respect to when mr. tullo started 17 smoking kent. there is no evidence that he smoked 18 kent before the 1963, '64 time period. 19 and with respect to when he stopped smoking 20 kent, you heard from louis tullo -- you remember 21 him, we read some of his deposition transcript -- 22 louis tullo is mr. tullo's oldest son. and what he 23 said was he remembered his father switching to 24 marlboro when he was 17 or 18. well, he was born 25 in 1949, and so he was 17 or 18, in 1966 or 1967. 5166 1 stephanie casino testified that she started 2 smoking marlboro in -- when she was 15 or 16, same 3 years, 1966, '67, she is two years younger. 4 there is no evidence that mr. tullo smoked 5 kent after that 1966, '67 time period. so what we 6 have is a period of about 1964 to '67, that is it. 7 that is the entire smoking history in this case with 8 respect to kent. 9 so the one thing i do agree with mr. hammer 10 about is mr. tullo only smoked kent for a really 11 short period of time. now, why is this important? 12 well, it is important for a number of reasons. 13 one of those reasons is plaintiffs expert, 14 dr. cummings -- you remember dr. cummings, he came 15 down here, he had the big slide show, the big 16 presentation. well, one of the things dr. cummings 17 said -- could you put up the slide, dr. cummings 18 slide, number four. 19 one of the things dr. cummings said, okay, is 20 that while every cigarette counts, the risk of 21 cigarette smoking is related to the dose. do you 22 remember he talked about what he called the dose 23 response, that is the higher the dose, the more 24 risk that is involved. 25 and what he said is that if you are under 5167 1 ten-pack years your risk over your lifetime is 2 about equivalent to a person who is never smoked. 3 well, clearly, three years of smoking is under 4 ten-pack years. 5 let me explain, by the way, what a pack-year 6 is, since i think dr. cummings talked about it, but 7 a pack-year is simply the number of packs per day 8 times the number of years. so if you smoked one 9 pack per day for three years, it is three-pack 10 years. 11 so what dr. cummings said is that while every 12 cigarette counts, if you are under ten-pack years, 13 your risk over your lifetime is equivalent to 14 somebody who never smoked. so that raises the 15 question, did the three years of kent smoking, was 16 that the legal cause of mr. tullo's lung cancer? 17 did it produce or contribute substantially? 18 do you remember ms. gallagher went through 19 legal cause yesterday? the definition of which is 20 did it produce or contribute substantially to 21 producing his lung cancer so it can reasonably be 22 said that but for those three years of smoking 23 mr. tullo would not have suffered his lung cancer? 24 well, dr. cummings, plaintiffs expert, has 25 explained that issue to you flat out. the risk 5168 1 does not increase until you get to ten-pack years. 2 so the answer to that question is obviously no. 3 and that is probably why you have not heard a whole 4 lot about us in this case. 5 another thing you had not heard about is why 6 did mr. tullo actually smoke kent? not a single 7 witness has told you why he smoked kent. in fact, 8 every witness who is testified has said they did not 9 know, never told him, they did not know, they did not 10 see anything. there were no documents that 11 referenced why he smoked kent. you saw a lot of 12 cigarette documents in this case. 13 dr. cummings, dr. burns had big powerpoints, 14 lots of cigarette documents. and you are going to 15 get to see a lot of them when you go back to the 16 jury room. what you are going to see is there is not 17 a single lorillard document in that pile of 18 documents. dr. cummings never mentioned a single 19 lorillard document. dr. burns never mentioned a 20 single lorillard document. 21 now, there are three ads from lorillard that 22 you are going to see for kent smoking. one from 23 1954, which is a decade or so before mr. tullo ever 24 smoked kent, and the other two are from the late 25 1950s. 5169 1 and i think there was one television clip with 2 the dick vandyke show, about ten seconds, where it 3 says "sponsored by kent." that is it. that is the 4 entire paper record in this case with respect to my 5 client lorillard and kent cigarettes. there is 6 nothing else. 7 you will see a couple of documents i put into 8 evidence with dr. cummings and dr. burns, and those 9 were submissions by lorillard to the 10 surgeon general providing information to the 11 surgeon general, submissions by lorillard to the 12 federal trade commission providing information to 13 the federal trade commission with respect to 14 smoking and health. 15 but you are not going to see a single document 16 put in by any of the plaintiffs experts with 17 respect to lorillard. you saw a lot of other 18 documents in that case. 19 and, by the way, as ms. gallagher told you, 20 none of those documents you saw had anything to do 21 with mr. tullo. that was when ms. gallagher was 22 talking about, i thought it was really good, when 23 she said we have a litigation world and we have the 24 mr. tullo world over here. 25 and all of those other documents from the 5170 1 plaintiffs experts, from dr. cummings, are over 2 here in in litigation world, they had nothing to do 3 with mr. tullo. 4 with respect to my client, you do not even have 5 to look at that because there is no documents any 6 place with respect to my client. and again, that 7 may be why we received such scant attention in this 8 case. 9 i do want to talk to you a little bit about 10 filters. 11 could you put up slide two for me? 12 you know, mr. hammer talked a lot about what 13 we called filter fraud and something about 50 years 14 ago the cigarette companies were defrauding the 15 public with respect to filters. 16 and ms. gallagher did a great job yesterday of 17 showing you literally seven, eight, nine, ten 18 publications that took place back then about 19 filters, about what the public health authorities 20 were suggesting about filters. she showed you 21 articles from the mainstream press, reader's 22 digest, time magazine, she showed you articles from 23 the scientific press, she showed you articles -- 24 she showed you portions of surgeon general reports, 25 all of whom were saying to smokers, hey, quit; if 5171 1 you do not quit, cut back; and if you do not cut 2 back, at least smoke a filtered cigarette. all 3 related to the same concept dr. cummings was 4 talking about, dose response, lower the dose of 5 tar. 6 so i'm not going to go back through all of 7 those documents that ms. gallagher went through 8 with you because i want to talk about my company -- 9 our company's filter, the kent filter. 10 this is an article written by dr. wynder. you 11 remember dr. wynder, he is the guy that dr. burns 12 and dr. cummings called like a giant in the 13 industry. he was one of the leaders in this 14 industry with respect to smoking and health. and 15 he was recommending filters all the way back now in 16 the '50s. 17 this is an article that he wrote recommending 18 filters. and what he said was, you know, put a 19 filter on a regular-sized cigarette, and if you 20 reduce the tar down to 18 milligrams, a reduction 21 at that level has shown in both animal experiment 22 and human studies -- human statistical studies 23 would be followed by a significant risk reduction 24 in the cancer risk, providing that the number of 25 cigarette smoke just kept constant. 5172 1 that is what dr. wynder in the public health 2 authority recommended, get that tar down to 3 at least 18 milligrams. well -- can you put up the 4 next slide. 5 do you remember ms. gallagher talked to you 6 about the federal trade commission setting up a 7 testing procedure, an agreed-upon testing 8 procedure, by the government, as to how they are 9 going to test tar and nicotine. and she went 10 through a number of documents with you about that. 11 well, this is the very first report that came 12 out in 1967, right around the time that mr. tullo 13 was moving from kent to marlboro. and notice what 14 the tar number is for kent, the very cigarette that 15 mr. tullo had been smoking; 17.4 milligrams, below 16 what did wynder was recommending for a significant 17 reduction in the risk of cancer. 18 now, ms. gallagher showed you yesterday what 19 the numbers were for parliament, which also meet 20 and exceeded the levels suggested by the public 21 health authorities during the period that mr. tullo 22 was smoking parliament. 23 mr. hammer put on absolutely no evidence that 24 there was anything wrong with the kent filter, 25 zero, none. 5173 1 he wants to stand up here and talk about, 2 quote, filter fraud, but with respect to the 3 filters on these very cigarettes that are at issue 4 here, the parliament filter that ms. gallagher 5 talked to you about yesterday, and the kent filter 6 that i'm talking about today, all of the evidence 7 is that those filters actually met the requirements 8 and the suggestions of the public health authority, 9 every one of them. 10 and mr. hammer has given you nothing -- 11 mr. hammer: judge, can we approach a minute? 12 the court: sure. 13 (sidebar held as follows:) 14 mr. hammer: if anything happens, i cannot 15 refer to ms. gallagher, and i cannot refer to her by 16 name, and yet he is using, and the defense now is 17 now referring to so, i mean -- 18 the court: going forward, say "counsel for 19 plaintiffs." 20 mr. bideau: i'm happy to do that. i did not 21 fix that up yet. i apologize. 22 (sidebar concluded and the following was held 23 in open court:) 24 mr. bideau: so plaintiffs to provide any 25 information that the actual filters in this case, 5174 1 the kent filter, the parliament filter, did not meet 2 or exceed every suggestion by the public health 3 authority. 4 so they can throw around general statements 5 and they can throw around little quips from ads, 6 little quips from articles talk generally about 7 filters. but we are talking about dominick tullo. 8 this is not the litigation world over here 9 that ms. gallagher was talking about. this is the 10 dominick tullo world. we are talking about the 11 cigarettes that dominick tullo smoked. 12 and there is not a bit of evidence that the 13 filters on those cigarettes did not do exactly what 14 the manufacturer said they were doing or what the 15 public health authority said they were doing. 16 now, there was some discussion yesterday. 17 can you put that last slide back up. i'm 18 sorry, the one before that. 19 ms. gallagher talked to you a little bit 20 yesterday about the concept of compensation and she 21 went, again, through a whole lot of discussions 22 about that, and this last line really refers to the 23 issue of compensation. 24 and that was the issue dr. burns was talking 25 about when he said things like, well, one of the 5175 1 reasons these filters do not work is smokers 2 compensate, they smoke more cigarettes, they smoke 3 differently, things like that. and ms. gallagher 4 showed you all of the articles, all of the letters, 5 all of the studies that related to compensation. 6 but in this case, not the case dr. burns was 7 talking about, but in this case there is no 8 evidence, as ms. gallagher pointed out to you, 9 everybody's testimony, dominick tullo smoked the 10 same number of cigarettes, whether he was smoking 11 nonfiltered or filtered, and he smoked them the 12 same way. there is simply no evidence of 13 compensation. 14 in fact, dr. burns actually acknowledged that 15 he did not see any evidence of compensation in this 16 case one way or the other. then dr. burns talked 17 about the fact that, well, the cigarette companies 18 kind of hid the issue of compensation, that nobody 19 knew about compensation. 20 and again, ms. gallagher yesterday put up a 21 number of submissions that were done by the 22 cigarette companies to the government, she put up a 23 number of articles. you just saw dr. wynder's 24 article about 1957; and dr. wynder's article is 25 talking about compensation, so it was well-known. 5176 1 can you put up slide 11 for me? 2 this is lorillard, my client's report to the 3 surgeon general in 1963. and in that report my 4 client is quoting from the surgeon general leroy 5 burney. in a statement surgeon general burney made 6 on november 28th of 1959, okay, in which he was 7 talking about the fact that the surgeon general was 8 aware of the issue of compensation. 9 so the notion that these tobacco companies 10 somehow hid the issue of compensation, again, 11 there is simply no facts in the record that would 12 support that. 13 the clerk: counselor, 15 minutes. 14 mr. bideau: thank you. 15 ladies and gentlemen let me remind you of one 16 thing in this case, plaintiffs have the burden to 17 prove their claim against each and every defendant, 18 they have to prove each and every claim against 19 each and every defendant. 20 the only thing plaintiffs told you in their 21 opening about my client was that mr. tullo smoked 22 some of my client's cigarettes. in closing he told 23 you it was a really small amount of my client's 24 cigarettes, did not smoke them for very long, that is 25 why we are here. 5177 1 and so one of the things you are going to have 2 to look at is did lorillard do anything that caused 3 or substantially contributed to mr. tullo's injury? 4 i submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, there is no 5 facts in this case that would support that. 6 look, cigarettes are legal in this country, 7 whether you like it or do not like it, cigarettes 8 are legal, okay. the law is that we can 9 manufacture and sell cigarettes and the defendants 10 cannot be liable just for selling cigarettes. 11 ms. gallagher talked to you yesterday about 12 the very first question on the verdict form: 13 was dominick tullo addicted to cigarettes 14 containing nicotine; and, if so, was such addiction 15 a legal cause of his death? and she explained to 16 you in great detail why the answer to that question 17 is "no," okay. 18 it was dominick tullo's decision to continue 19 smoking, that was the legal cause of his lung 20 cancer. when you look at every question on the 21 verdict form, ladies and gentlemen, you are going to 22 see the phrase "legal cause." 23 literally every question has the issue of 24 legal cause, okay. you are going to have to find 25 legal cause for every question. ms. gallagher told 5178 1 you yesterday there is simply no basis for that. 2 there is no basis in this evidence for you to find 3 legal cause as to any of the questions on the 4 verdict form, if you were to get by question one. 5 and we agree with ms. gallagher that a "no" to 6 question one, based on the evidence in this case, 7 is the appropriate answer, and at that point you 8 do not go any further. 9 i do want to talk just for a minute about the 10 issue of punitive damages. now, i do not think you 11 ever get there, so again, for all the reasons 12 ms. gallagher said. and as she told you, the law 13 that you -- burden of proof of punitive damages is 14 clear and convincing evidence, it is a higher 15 standard to which you judge this part of the case 16 on. 17 if you look at the evidence, ladies and 18 gentlemen, there is no conduct by lorillard or, 19 frankly, there is no conduct by any of the 20 defendants in this case that would satisfy that 21 high standard, and certainly none that effected 22 dominick tullo. 23 there is not a shred of evidence that dominick 24 tullo ever took any action or failed to take any 25 action based on anything lorillard did or said. 5179 1 they have not even shown you any documents that 2 related to dominick tullo. they have not shown you 3 any lorillard documents. there are no internal 4 lorillard documents in this record to contradict 5 anything lorillard was saying publicly, there is 6 nothing there. 7 he smoked kent for just a few years and the 8 kent cigarette that he smoked met or exceeded all 9 of the recommendations in the public health 10 authorities, like dr. wynder, in reducing tar. and 11 in short, ladies and gentlemen, there is no basis 12 for you to find an entitlement to punitive damages 13 on my client, if you ever got to that last 14 question. 15 well, i heard gina say i was already at 15 16 minutes, so my time's about up here today. i do 17 want to thank you for your time, for your effort 18 and for your patience. 19 now, when we all sit down -- mr. geise is 20 last -- when we all sit down plaintiffs get to get 21 up and give you rebuttal argument and we do not get 22 to get up after that and put into context what 23 plaintiffs talk about; so, what i would like you to 24 do is, as you listen to plaintiffs counsel when 25 they get up and talk about their rebuttal, if they 5180 1 show you documents, if they talk about pieces of 2 testimony, please look at that -- those documents 3 and think whether those documents relate in any way 4 to dominick tullo, think about whether those -- any 5 of the testimony that he talks about relate to 6 dominick tullo, think about the timing, what is the 7 date of the document and what was dominick tullo 8 doing at that point in time. 9 because based on the evidence you have in this 10 record, there is the litigation world over here, 11 and none of that related to dominick tullo. so 12 we would ask you, since we do not get to get up again, 13 if you would please just take a look at the 14 documents, take a look at the evidence and put them 15 in context for us. 16 every witness has told you that dominick tullo 17 was an intelligent guy, he was a strong guy, he was 18 a guy who did not like his decisions questioned, and 19 he is a guy who knew how to make decisions. 20 there is nothing, folks, that lorillard or any 21 of these defendants could have done or said that 22 would have changed any decision that dominick tullo 23 made. thank you. 17 mr. geise: counsel, mrs. tullo. 18 good morning, once again. i had good 19 afternoon because i thought we were going to get to 20 this point yesterday, but we did not. we are 21 nearing the end. 22 you remember in opening statements it 23 coincided with opening day for baseball. and i 24 think now we can say we are in the ninth inning or 25 maybe we are into the tenth inning now since we have 5192 1 kicked over to this morning. 2 you have been incredibly punctual throughout 3 this whole trial. i think this is the rare trial 4 where we have never had to wait on a juror once. 5 now, i know you all have had to wait on us 6 sometimes when we are in here taking care of legal 7 issues, and we thank you very much for your 8 patience. 9 we have tried to move this trial as quickly as 10 possible because we know how important your time is 11 and how you have dedicated to the jury process. and 12 your civic sacrifice that you have made the last 13 three weeks is something that we cannot pay back to 14 you as much as we should. thank you. 15 and you know by now that the eight of you are 16 the judges of the facts. and when it comes to my 17 client, the facts are critically important. 18 and the plaintiff has the burden to prove 19 those facts. and i realize memories fade and it is 20 hard to recall things that happened 50, 60, 70 21 years ago. but inside a courtroom, in a lawsuit to 22 recover money, the plaintiff has the burden of 23 proof. hazy memories do not suffice. only proof 24 does. 25 and i asked you at the beginning of this case 5193 1 to demand proof, do not accept punches and 2 suspicions and could-be's; demand proof. and proof 3 is evidence you hear from the witnesses. and in 4 this case there is very little proof about the 5 smoking history of mr. tullo of my client's brands. 6 my client's brands that mr. tullo is said to 7 have smoked are lucky strike, camel and pall mall, 8 and i want to talk about the evidence about those 9 three. 10 you heard that mrs. tullo saw mr. tullo smoke 11 a lucky strike cigarette in the neighborhood when 12 they were about 11 or 12 years old. and from that 13 mr. hammer wants you to assume that from the 14 mid-1930s until the mid-1940s mr. tullo smoked 15 lucky strike. the problem is that is not what the 16 evidence is in this case. 17 now, first of all, it is important to remember 18 that these are events that took place 75 years ago. 19 and as mrs. tullo told mr. hammer her memory is not 20 that great, and that is understandable. who can 21 remember what happened that long ago? 22 and mrs. tullo also told you that when they 23 met they were kids, they were both in school and 24 they did not see each other that much, and you heard 25 yesterday she does not know why dominick tullo 5194 1 started smoking and she does not know why he started 2 smoking lucky strike. she does not know. no proof. 3 now, then we hear dominick tullo goes away to 4 the army and he comes back and when he returns they 5 start dating. and she believes that by that time 6 in 1947 he is smoking chesterfield. we do not know 7 what he was smoking when he was in the army. no 8 proof. 9 now, mrs. tullo assumes that he quit smoking 10 lucky strike and went to chesterfield. but look at 11 what dr. cummings said. 12 can i have number three, please? 13 this is evidence in this case. he was asked: 14 so she does not know how long he smoked lucky 15 strike? 16 and she also said that there could have been 17 many cigarette brands in between lucky strike and 18 chesterfield, correct? 19 and the answer is: that is right. 20 that is the evidence. 21 and you also heard -- contrary to i think what 22 was in mr. hammer's closing yesterday -- that 23 mrs. tullo does not know how long mr. tullo smoked 24 lucky strike. 25 can we see number two? 5195 1 the question: how long do you recall 2 mr. tullo smoking lucky strikes? 3 that i cannot answer. 4 this, ladies and gentlemen, is the evidence in 5 this case. she does not know how long, she does not 6 know how many, and you cannot assume that it is 7 something different than the evidence. they have 8 to prove it, and they did not. 9 and mrs. tullo is the only person you heard 10 from who mentioned that mr. tullo smoked lucky 11 strike. that is it. no other family member, no 12 other friend, no one saw him, no one ever heard him 13 say that he did. 14 now, with regard to this period of time, 15 mr. hammer made a point yesterday that dominick 16 tullo was addicted in the '30s and '40s. 17 and this remind me of something my two boys 18 would say if i said that to them, they would say 19 "really?" 20 mr. hammer: judge, objection. may i 21 approach? 22 (sidebar held as follows:) 23 mr. hammer: he refers to his -- 24 mr. geise: i will move on. 25 the court: you will move on, okay. 5196 1 (sidebar concluded and the following was held 2 in open court:) 3 mr. geise: with regard to this period of 4 time, the question is how is mr. hammer so sure 5 when his own expert dr. burns is not? 6 can i see number four, please? 7 dr. burns was asked: now, as to when 8 mr. tullo became addicted, you do not have a 9 specific age or year that you think he became 10 addicted, correct? 11 no, we do not have much description in detail 12 of his smoking behaviors as an adolescent and young 13 man and, therefore, there is no way to know with any 14 reasonable certainty precisely when that happened. 15 you cannot even say for sure whether he was 16 addicted before he got married in 1947. 17 answer: i cannot say with certainty, that is 18 correct. 19 when your expert said there is no way to know 20 and cannot say it with certainty, you have not met 21 your burden of proof on that fact. 22 next brand, pall mall. you heard from 23 mr. tullo's daughter, stephanie casino, that she 24 recalls mr. tullo smoking a camel cigarette when 25 she was 6 or 7 years old in 1957 or 1958 when they 5197 1 lived in that house on east 45th street with a 2 number of relatives, a number of relatives who also 3 smoked. 4 and she told you she does not know how long he 5 smoked camel and she does not know how many camels 6 he smoked. and that is fair. 7 stephanie casino is the only person who 8 identified camel as a brand that mr. tullo smoked. 9 and you need to ask yourself, her brother, louis 10 tullo, did not identify it. and, more importantly, 11 mrs. tullo never identified camel as a brand that 12 mr. tullo smoked. 13 so you need to ask yourself as the judges of 14 the facts what makes sense to you, the recollection 15 of a 6-year-old from 50 years ago or the woman that 16 lived with him for over 50 years. because the only 17 evidence about camel smoking is from the 18 6-year-old, not his wife from over 50 years. 19 the last brand that mr. tullo is said to have 20 smoked from my client is pall mall, and again, 21 mrs. tullo cannot remember when he smoked pall mall. 22 now, you heard that he may have smoked pall mall 23 cigarettes because they were a longer cigarette. 24 dr. cummings told you that. and dr. cummings 25 said if he wanted a longer cigarette, that is what 5198 1 he got with pall mall, it was five millimeters 2 longer than the other cigarettes. 3 mrs. tullo does not recall exactly how long 4 mr. tullo smoked pall mall, but she thinks it was 5 between three to five years. and during that 6 period of time she does not know how many cigarettes 7 he smoked per day. 8 can i see number six, please? 9 this is her testimony: so, can you tell us, 10 in terms of pall malls, do you know how many 11 cigarettes of pall mall he would smoke in a day? 12 answer: i would -- no. 13 it is not one pack per day, it is not two packs 14 per day. it is "i do not know." that is the 15 evidence in this case. and just like lucky strike 16 and just like camel, only one witness testified 17 about pall mall history. 18 now, i did a chart trying to keep track of 19 these histories throughout trial, and i want to 20 look at that now. can i see number seven, please. 21 this is a chart of the different brands that we 22 heard somebody say did mr. tullo smoke. 23 and mrs. tullo told you the order was lucky 24 strike, chesterfield, kent, marlboro, and 25 parliament, and then i added the camel from 5199 1 stephanie casino. 2 if you look at this, mrs. tullo said that 3 pall mall was after chesterfield, kent and marlboro 4 and before parliament. but her daughter and her 5 son do not remember that. ask yourself, is not it 6 odd that three people living in the same house and 7 only one of them recalls the brand? 8 and especially with stephanie casino, she 9 remembers a camel cigarette when she is 6, but 10 does not remember three to five years of pall mall 11 when she is a teenager? 12 in his testimony dr. cummings talks about the 13 importance of unanimous testimony, i do not know if 14 you all remember that, he says it is when multiple 15 people see the same thing. well, what does it mean 16 when it is not unanimous? 17 and there was one other witness in this case 18 who is not on this chart right now who told us about 19 dominick tullo's smoking history, and that was 20 dominick tullo himself. he did not take the witness 21 stand, unfortunately, he is not here, but he did 22 speak to us through documents that were created 23 when he was alive. 24 you saw three surveys that the tullos sent in 25 to philip morris, and the surveys asked about 5200 1 smoking history, asked about things that are 2 important in this case. mr. hammer talked about 3 the frank statement. i'll represent, these are 4 dominick's statements about his smoking history. 5 and there were three of them. 6 now, if we can look at the first one, number 7 eight, please, he identifies his current brand of 8 cigarettes, parliament, and the previous brand, 9 marlboro. 10 can we look at the second one, please. 11 he identifies his current brand of cigarettes, 12 again, parliament, and his previous brand 13 chesterfield. 14 can we see the third one, please? 15 current brand, parliament, previous brand, 16 kent. 17 mrs. tullo told you that pall mall was the 18 cigarette before parliament. kent, chesterfield, 19 marlboro before pall mall, parliament after. does 20 that make sense? 21 can i see number 11, please? 22 dominick tullo, when he identified his current 23 brand as parliament, he identified his previous 24 brands as kent, chesterfield and marlboro. he 25 never said his previous brand was pall mall. did 5201 1 he forget? not once, but three times when he had 2 the opportunity, that is the evidence in this case. 3 and i submit to you that the surveys that the 4 tullos sent in to philip morris were surveys sent 5 in before there was a lawsuit to recover money. 6 and i think you need to consider that as you judge 7 the facts. 8 because if you believe dominick tullo and his 9 children, he did not smoke lucky strike, he did not 10 smoke camel and he did not smoke pall mall. that is 11 the evidence. 12 can you take that down? thank you. 13 now, if you accept the biggest possible 14 smoking history for the reynolds brands, you get 15 mrs. tullo's uncorroborated testimony that it is 16 about three to five years max. 17 now, we have heard about dr. burns and his chart 18 and the proportion and that, so i'm not going to 19 repeat what you heard about that. but dr. burns 20 did not tell you anything about the brands. he 21 did not offer even a guess about the proportion. 22 but the problem for the plaintiff in this case 23 is dr. cummings did. dr. cummings did talk about 24 it. and you do not need to take my word about the 25 smoking history. we can take dr. cummings' word. 5202 1 and remember how hard it is to get dr. cummings to 2 agree to anything? it was tough. 3 can i see number 12, please. 4 this is what i asked him. so if we add those 5 together, mr. tullo's smoking history of those 6 three brands is less than five years, is not it? 7 and originally said: i would not agree with 8 that, we just do not know. 9 now, we do not know does not equal evidence, but 10 he said "we just do not know." so i followed up: 11 and because no one can recall, there is no 12 evidence in the record that you reviewed that it is 13 greater than five years, correct? 14 and he said: that is true. 15 dr. cummings telling this is significant about 16 a smoking history that is insignificant. and 17 mr. bideau and mr. rosenstein touched on it, and 18 it is the next point from dr. cummings. 19 could i have number 14, please? 20 it is the pack-year threshold. dr. cummings 21 says that you need a ten-pack year threshold for an 22 increased risk. and dr. cummings admits that the 23 maximum reynolds smoking history is five; and 24 that is if you believe the testimony, it is five. it 25 comes nowhere near the threshold, not at all. 5203 1 according to dr. cummings, the risk from 2 smoking reynolds cigarettes is minimum, and it is 3 that of a person who has never smoked, and it is far 4 short of the threshold needed to cause disease. 5 now, why is that important? why is that 6 important? well, it is important because of the 7 concept of legal cause. other folks have addressed 8 that before, i'm not going to dwell on it. 9 i agree with ms. gallagher, that addiction is 10 not the legal cause of mr. tullo's lung cancer and 11 death. in addition, reynolds smoking history is 12 not the legal cause. they are not the but for 13 cause, because the evidence does not support the 14 conclusion that but for smoking reynolds brands 15 mr. tullo would have avoided lung cancer. 16 so your answer on the verdict form to every 17 question that asks you about legal cause should be 18 "no." 19 the engle findings, they are in the jury 20 instructions that you have, they were read to you 21 yesterday. the one thing that is very important 22 about that is there is an instruction that do not 23 mean that the plaintiff is entitled to prevail in 24 this case. the plaintiff has to do more. 25 the plaintiff has to take the findings, you 5204 1 have to apply the evidence, and then you have to 2 decide if the plaintiff met her burden that the 3 defendants conduct was a legal cause of mr. tullo's 4 smoking and ultimately his death at age 74. 5 now, as i mentioned in my opening statement, i 6 like to picture the findings as kind of being in 7 that parking garage across the street, and there is 8 the walkway and there is the courthouse on this side 9 of the street after the walkway. and the 10 plaintiffs have to take and they have to build that 11 walkway with evidence to connect the findings in 12 the garage to the testimony and the facts in this 13 courtroom. 14 and i submit that they have not done that. 15 they did not build that walkway. they are still in 16 that parking garage, with lots of documents, but no 17 connection to dominick tullo. 18 mr. hammer spent a great deal of time 19 yesterday talking about filter fraud and the 20 illusion of filtration and my bet is he is going to 21 spend some more on it when i'm done today. 22 i'm not going to touch the filter fraud 23 argument. and i'm not going to touch it for one 24 simple reason, lucky strike, pall mall, and camel 25 are all unfiltered cigarettes. so the part where 5205 1 he talks about filter fraud, i do not have anything 2 to respond to there. 3 during this trial, through the great help of 4 dr. cummings, the plaintiffs picked from about 60 5 million tobacco company documents to show you some, 6 and they picked the worst ones to put on display 7 here, the dirtiest of the dirty laundry you can 8 imagine to air out in front of the jury. 9 mr. hammer talked a lot about the american 10 public. it is critically important for you to 11 remember that this case is not about the american 12 public. this case is about mr. tullo. 13 and what that means is you have to determine 14 what any of those documents had to do with 15 mr. tullo. the plaintiffs have to build a walkway 16 from each of those documents to mr. tullo, and they 17 did not do that. 18 specifically, the court instructed you on the 19 issue of concealment, and it talks about they have 20 to prove that mr. tullo reasonably relied to 21 detriment on a statement. 22 first of all, there is no evidence that 23 mr. tullo heard, read or saw any statement from a 24 tobacco company. 25 can i see number 18, please. 5206 1 this is the evidence in this case. 2 doctor, my question is that there has been no 3 testimony in this case that mr. tullo heard, read 4 or saw any particular statement by a tobacco 5 company. 6 that is true. 7 you have no information from the testimony in 8 this case to indicate that mr. tullo ever saw or 9 heard any of the video clips that you played to 10 this jury? 11 answer: either way, that is true. 12 and for reynolds, there is no evidence that he 13 heard or saw anything from reynolds. 14 can i have number 19. 15 did your husband ever tell you that he had 16 ever heard, read or seen any statements from 17 rj reynolds tobacco company? 18 answer: i never heard. 19 that is the evidence. there was no evidence 20 that anything reynolds did or any of the other 21 tobacco companies did had any impact on mr. tullo's 22 decisions. there is no evidence that he ever relied 23 on anything reynolds said. and similarly, there is 24 no proof he relied on something reynolds did not 25 say. 5207 1 without hearing, without seeing, without 2 reading, and most of all without relying, they 3 cannot build that bridge. and when you get to 4 questions five and six, specifically, where you are 5 asked whether dominick tullo reasonably relied to 6 his detriment on any statement, your answer for all 7 of the companies has to be "no." that is the 8 evidence. if he did not see it and he did not rely 9 on it, it has to be a "no." 10 this case is not about somebody else in the 11 american public. this case is about dominick 12 tullo, and this case is about the evidence about 13 dominick tullo. 14 now, the plaintiffs theory is that if reynolds 15 or somebody else had said something publicly that 16 was in an internal document that might have made a 17 difference to mr. tullo, he might have quit. well, 18 "might" does not cut it. they got to go the next 19 step and say it would have made a difference, 20 absolutely. and they have put on no evidence to 21 prove that either. 22 and ask yourself, does it make any sense to 23 say that there is reynolds or anybody else that said 24 smoking causes lung cancer, that it would have made 25 a difference to his decision? of course not. 5208 1 mr. tullo was not the kind of guy that 2 listened to anybody; not the media, not his wife, 3 and certainly not a tobacco company. you heard 4 that mr. and mrs. tullo had a fabulous marriage, a 5 terrific marriage. but if you do not care what your 6 spouse tells you over and over for four to five 7 decades, do you think a different statement from a 8 stranger is going to matter? of course not. 9 now, i want to talk briefly about some of the 10 reynolds documents that dr. cummings showed you. 11 and in those documents, were some stupid statements 12 made? yes, absolutely. 13 on your verdict form, is there a question 14 whether stupid statements were made? no. 15 and is there a connection between any 16 statement and document and dominick tullo? no. 17 dr. cummings' presentation of the documents is 18 meant to be an invitation to ignore the facts of 19 dominick tullo's smoking history and focus instead 20 on the extraneous, on the irrelevant and the 21 prejudicial. 22 dr. cummings combs his archives and looks for 23 the most inflammatory statement to put before you, 24 but as i showed you, there is not a bit of evidence 25 that mr. tullo saw any of the documents, saw any of 5209 1 the ads, saw any of the statements; and, moreover, 2 there is no evidence that any of the internal 3 documents would have impacted his decisions if he 4 had them in front of him to read. there is no 5 evidence. 6 now, i want to mention a couple examples about 7 reynolds documents. remember the 1990 letter to an 8 elementary school principal in western new york? 9 could i have number 20, please. 10 this is what i asked dr. cummings: now, in 11 1990, mr. tullo was retired, on medicaid, living in 12 florida, correct? 13 that is right. 14 he was not in elementary school at willow ridge 15 in amherst, new york, was he? 16 no. 17 he never lived in amherst, new york, did he? 18 no. 19 and mr. tullo never saw this letter, did he? 20 no. 21 and what dr. cummings' testimony about that 22 letter prove? well, it proved reynolds did not sell 23 candy cigarettes, reynolds did not sell toys, 24 reynolds did not sell video games. but it was a 25 document generated by dr. cummings, went to the 5210 1 school, he encouraged it, so that he could bring it 2 with him every time he testifies. 3 it does not matter who the plaintiff is. it 4 does not matter how old the plaintiff is in 1990. 5 it does not matter where they lived; any trial, any 6 time, anywhere is good enough for dr. cummings. 7 there was a document from 1973. now, this is 8 a decade or so after mr. tullo's stopped smoking my 9 client's products, it is a decade later. so what it 10 could have to do, i'm not sure, but in 1973 there is 11 a document talking about future brands for a 12 quote/unquote youth market. 13 in 1973, mr. tullo was 50. now i know we are 14 aging gracefully now, and 50 is not as old as it 15 used to be, but 50's not a youth. 16 dr. cummings takes these documents from 17 courtroom to courtroom to inflame you, not to 18 inform you. and there is some documents that they 19 do inform, but only when you get the whole story. 20 dr. teague, 1953, mr. hammer mentioned it 21 yesterday in his closing -- and you may see it 22 again when i sit down -- it is a review of published 23 literature done by an employee at reynolds. 24 can i have number 21, please. 25 this is the question i asked dr. cummings: 5211 1 and all of the literature -- all 78 2 references, it will be in evidence, go look at it, 3 78 references -- all of the literature that was 4 reviewed in this document had been published and 5 publicly available and accessible to anyone that 6 wanted to access it, correct? 7 yes. 8 it was available to the surgeon general? 9 yes, it was. 10 it was available to the national cancer 11 institute? 12 correct. 13 anyone could have done this research? 14 yes. anyone. 15 anyone could have gone down to the public 16 library and done the same thing dr. teague did in 17 1953. 18 none of the information was secret. none of 19 it was concealed from the public. in fact, 20 dr. teague got his information from the public. 21 there was another document, a 1959 document 22 from mr. rodgman where dr. rodgman observed eight 23 of the polycyclic hydrocarbons isolated from the 24 smoke are known to produce cancer in mice. 25 so the thought is reynolds knows in 1959 there 5212 1 are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in cigarettes. 2 it is got to be a secret to reynolds, right? no. 3 remember i showed you it was in reader's 4 digest the same month? 5 can i see the next slide, please. 6 i asked dr. cummings: so, obviously, eight 7 polycyclic hydrocarbons were not secret to reynolds 8 in 1959, correct? 9 no. 10 they were known in the medical literature and 11 in the public literature? 12 yes. i was not aware of the citation in the 13 reader's digest, but reader's digest usually 14 reports in lay terms what is in the medical 15 literature. 16 so why come before you and tell you that this 17 is something that was not available to the public 18 when i have to be the one to show them, oh, really, 19 it is in reader's digest the same month. 20 mr. hammer told you dr. cummings is biased. 21 folks, that is bias gone too far, if you ask me. 22 the last reynolds document i want to talk 23 about is another one from the 1970's, again, long 24 after he stopped smoking my product. but 25 dr. cummings talked about it, so i feel like i need 5213 1 to address it a little bit and put it in the proper 2 context. 3 it is one that i think it is been said it is 4 evidence that reynolds manipulated nicotine, to 5 have the right amount of nicotine to keep smokers 6 smoking, and that sounds pretty sinister. 7 but the story we got from dr. cummings and 8 dr. farone tells you something about that document 9 that is not so sinister. and the story is that 10 reynolds scientists were aware of the 11 recommendations from the public health community 12 and were acting on those recommendations. 13 now, in the document, dr. teague talks about 14 changing the tar-to-nicotine ratio. and what he is 15 saying is if you lower the tar in a cigarette and 16 keep nicotine the same, you change the ratio. 17 and the thought is, if smokers are smoking to 18 get nicotine, if they have a level of nicotine they 19 have to get, if they want a dose they are searching 20 for, if they get that dose and get less tar, that 21 could be better for them, because the tar's the 22 stuff that they think causes cancer and tar's the 23 bad stuff they are trying to eliminate. 24 so if you can get the nicotine and get less 25 tar, that can be a good thing. now, is this an 5214 1 idea known only to dr. teague and only to reynolds? 2 no. let us look at who else had this idea. 3 dr. michael russell. 4 can i see number 25? 5 i talked to dr. cummings about this: 6 so, when dr. teague is talking about reducing 7 the tar to nicotine ratio in this document, he is 8 talking about keeping the same level of nicotine 9 while reducing the tar, right. 10 among other things, he is talking about that, 11 yes. 12 it was a strategy that had been discussed by 13 scientists like dr. russell and other members of 14 the public health community for potentially making 15 cigarettes safer? 16 answer: yes. 17 who else? how about the surgeon general, the 18 highest public health official in the country. 19 may i have 26, please. 20 well, you are familiar that in 1981 the surgeon 21 general's report discussed the idea of changing the 22 tar-to-nicotine ratio as a potential approach for 23 making a safer cigarette? 24 yes. 25 the surgeon general's report reviewed the 5215 1 literature, some of which came out in the '70s. 2 and specifically, the 1981 surgeon general's 3 report, this is a report that dr. burns was 4 involved in, and they agreed with this approach. 5 and they were not alone. 6 may i have slide 27. 7 this is from dr. farone, another person, 8 another witness, another expert called by the 9 plaintiffs, and he was asked: 10 during the course of the tobacco working 11 group -- and you remember, the tobacco working 12 group was a group of people from the national 13 cancer institute and the tobacco companies working 14 together toward a safer cigarette. that is what the 15 tobacco working group is. 16 and during the course of the tobacco working 17 group's efforts to develop a less hazardous 18 cigarette, one of their suggestions was to increase 19 the tar -- i'm sorry -- to increase the nicotine 20 levels as relative to the tar to give people the 21 nicotine that they wanted, right? 22 yes. 23 and the thought was that they want nicotine, 24 let us give them the nicotine, but let us try to 25 reduce the level of tar because tar is the stuff 5216 1 that causes cancer, right? 2 right. 3 and that is an idea that you support, right? 4 yes. 5 dr. farone supports it, the 1981 surgeon 6 general's report with dr. burns supports it. 7 and the other thing you heard is until 2000, 8 until the year 2000, after dominick tullo had 9 developed lung cancer, dr. cummings himself 10 continued to advocate increasing the level of 11 nicotine in cigarettes. 12 now, that is the evidence in this courtroom. 13 if all of these public health officials and 14 organizations are touting an idea to make 15 cigarettes less hazardous, is it a surprise that 16 the idea was discussed in a document that reynolds 17 had? 18 it is far from negligent for a cigarette 19 manufacturer to pay attention to what is going on in 20 the public health community about cigarettes. and, 21 in fact, i think dr. cummings -- 22 mr. hammer: judge, can we approach? 23 the court: sure. 24 (sidebar held as follows:) 25 mr. hammer: that comment by saying "it is far 5217 1 from negligent" is challenging the finding. the 2 finding is they are negligent. it is an improper 3 argument, and i request the court to cure that. 4 mr. geise: i think it is very similar to what 5 mr. hammer said, saying "is this negligent," i 6 do not know, what, maybe he was challenging the 7 findings, i'm not sure. 8 mr. hammer: no, judge. when i was saying 9 "this is negligent," and i went to the findings, 10 and yes, of course it is. 11 the court: you can suggest this, and let us 12 just move on. 13 mr. geise: i will clear that up and tell them 14 the findings has negligence. 15 (sidebar concluded and the following was held 16 in open court:) 17 mr. geise: the findings you have say that the 18 tobacco companies are negligent. i'm not 19 challenging that. 20 but i do not think you can challenge what is in 21 a document when reynolds has the same thing that 22 the public health community is advocating. 23 and as a matter of fact, dr. cummings would 24 probably have been here criticizing reynolds if 25 they did not have that in their documents. 5218 1 the clerk: ten minutes left. 2 mr. geise: the idea was not a secret. it 3 was not concealed from the public. the public 4 health community not only knew about it, but they 5 proposed it, and now 40 years later reynolds is 6 criticized for being right on par with the public 7 health community. 8 if reynolds did something wrong with that, 9 then mr. bideau and mr. rosenstein need to slide on 10 over and we better make room for dr. russell, for 11 the national cancer institute and the 12 surgeon general. 13 mr. hammer: judge, can we approach? 14 the court: sure. 15 (sidebar held as follows:) 16 mr. hammer: that is an improper argument; 17 saying that other people should be defendants, 18 that is an improper argument, that is exactly what he 19 just said, that they should slide over and other 20 people be sitting here. 21 the court: that is what the issue, based on 22 that document, based on the information, based on 23 that in this lawsuit, just similar, that this based 24 on that document. 25 mr. geise: okay, all right. 5219 1 (sidebar concluded and the following was held 2 in open court:) 3 mr. geise: ladies and gentlemen, my last 4 statement about the national cancer institute and 5 the surgeon general and dr. russell was limited to 6 the last document where dr. teague had the same 7 thing that they were proposing. 8 i'm going to talk just for a second about 9 punitive damages. i do not think you should get to 10 the consideration of punitive damages, that is 11 probably not a surprise; and if you do, you need to 12 remember that the burden of proof is even higher, 13 it is clear and convincing evidence for punitive 14 damages. 15 but i want to discuss one thing mr. hammer 16 brought up yesterday in his argument in support of 17 why you should find punitive damages, and that was 18 in 1994 testimony by tobacco executives in front of 19 congress. 20 and, in particular, he played a video that had 21 the ceo for reynolds who said he disagreed that 22 cigarettes and nicotine was addictive, using the 23 classic definition of addiction, which required 24 intoxication. that is what was on the clip. 25 now, i want to look at testimony you have seen 5220 1 in this case. 2 can i see number 28. 3 this is a question asked in the case: if the 4 definition used in 1964 had been used in the 1988 5 report, then once again cigarettes and the nicotine 6 in them would not have been found to be addictive, 7 correct? 8 and the answer is: right. 9 if the requirement was that it caused 10 intoxication, then one would not have labeled 11 nicotine addiction, you know, nicotine as 12 addictive. 13 now, from what mr. hammer said, you would 14 assume this is probably testimony from one of the 15 tobacco company employees, right? no. 16 it was testimony from dr. cummings. he told 17 you about the changing definition. he told you 18 about the classic definition. and he told you that 19 under that classic definition it requires 20 intoxication; and if you still use that definition, 21 it does not meet it. 22 now, it is not clear and convincing evidence in 23 support of punitive damages when the plaintiffs 24 expert says the same thing. 25 now, there is one thing you probably noticed 5221 1 throughout the morning, there are a number of 2 things that mr. hammer and i disagree about. 3 one thing we do agree on is what he said 4 yesterday, that this case is all about money. 5 you can take that down. thank you. 6 they have suggested to you to award an 7 enormous amount of money against the defendant and 8 specifically against reynolds, despite the fact 9 that mr. tullo smoked our cigarettes for no more 10 than five years. 11 and i agree with ms. gallagher, and i also 12 take the position that reynolds should not be liable 13 and should not pay mrs. tullo any money whatsoever 14 for that limited smoking history. 15 mr. hammer told you that they accept 16 responsibility, partial responsibility for dominick 17 tullo's lung cancer and death. 18 now, you never heard any witness on the stand 19 say that they take partial responsibility. i 20 submit to you that this is a game lawyers play. 21 mr. hammer: judge, objection. 22 (sidebar held as follows:) 23 the court: what is the -- 24 mr. hammer: you know, is there was a motion 25 in limine filed by defense counsel saying they 5222 1 cannot denigrate defense counsel telling this jury 2 that we are playing games, that is about as 3 denigrating as you can get. they are violating 4 their own motion on this court's order. 5 mr. geise: i'm not aware of the order or 6 motion that he is referring to them violating. i 7 do not think i'm violating anything. this is 8 closing argument. i think that is an absolutely 9 fair statement. 10 mr. hammer: saying that plaintiffs counsel is 11 playing a game in this court? 12 mr. geise: with regard to accepting 13 responsibility. 14 mr. hammer: no, that is calling what we are 15 doing, challenging, not challenging, it is 16 denigrating, what you are doing, which is exactly 17 what -- 18 the court: i will sustain the objection. 19 mr. hammer: i would like a curative on that, 20 judge. that has to have a curative. that is a 21 distinct violation of this court's order. 22 the court: we will deal with it. 23 (sidebar concluded and the following was held 24 in open court:) 25 mr. geise: as i was saying, you heard 5223 1 mr. hammer say mrs. tullo accepts partial 2 responsibility for dominick tullo, but you did not 3 hear mrs. tullo say that on the witness stand. 4 the plaintiff wants to accept responsibility 5 here while using the concept of addiction to paint 6 mr. tullo as a powerless individual. 7 but if you think the concept of addiction is 8 an excuse for your actions, then do not accept 9 responsibility for that. you cannot have it both 10 ways. 11 mr. hammer talked a number of times yesterday 12 about heroin users and heroin addicts. if a heroin 13 addict goes on a binge and overdoses after decades 14 of warnings from the people closest to them, is the 15 heroin addict partially responsible or responsible? 16 you cannot just accept some responsibility. 17 now, from what we have heard and learned about 18 dominick tullo in this case, how do you think he 19 would have answered the question on responsibility? 20 would this gentleman who was his own man say 21 someone or something else was in control of his 22 decisions? or would he say i am responsible? 23 we saw lots of pictures of dominick tullo 24 throughout his life, from a young man, from a shoe 25 shine boy growing up, getting married, having 5224 1 children, having grandchildren, going to his 2 granddaughter's weddings, we saw beautiful pictures 3 of a man who lived a full and complete life. and 4 the pictures depict a man who did what he wanted to 5 do and enjoyed. 6 but beyond the photographs, we got another 7 picture of who dominick tullo was. he was a man 8 who made decisions and there was nothing you could 9 do about his decisions once he made them. 10 whether it was his decision to move to florida 11 after he retired over the objection of his wife, 12 whether it was his decision to keep smoking over 13 the objections of his wife, he did not like to have 14 his decisions questioned. 15 we never heard in this case that he ever 16 second-guessed his decision to smoke. and if he 17 did not second-guess it, you should not second-guess 18 it either. it was his decision. 19 and i want to end on that decision point with 20 a clip you saw earlier in the trial. 21 may i see number 29, please. 22 (video clip played as follows:) 23 voice: if you smoke cigarettes, you increase 24 your chances of dying early. in this kind of a 25 country, it comes down to you whether you like it 5225 1 or not. no one is going to forbid an adult to 2 smoke, and it is now quite clear that no one is 3 going to tell him it is good for him either. the 4 decision is his, the decision and the health that 5 may depend on it. 6 (video clip concluded.) 7 mr. geise: ladies and gentlemen, the decision 8 was his. 9 i thank you so much for your time and 10 attention this morning. i thank you so much for 11 your patience the last three weeks, you have been a 12 terrific jury. 7 mr. rosenstein: counsel. 8 good morning, ladies and gentlemen. you will 9 be glad to hear that my remarks, i will try to keep 10 them around 15 minutes long. it is been a pleasure 11 to be before you in judge sasser's court, and you 12 have all been exceptional jurors, so i just thank 13 you for that. 14 when this trial began i gave a brief opening 15 statement where i talked, i told you a little bit 16 about my client and i told you what the evidence 17 was going to show about mr. tullo. 18 now we are at the end of trial and 19 ms. gallagher did an excellent job covering 20 yesterday why the lawyers in this case have failed 21 to meet their burden against the defendants on all 22 their claims. 23 please remember, this case is not about 24 whether cigarette smoking caused dominick tullo's 25 cancer. we know that it did. that is not what 5182 1 we are here to decide. 2 we are also not here to resolve whether 3 cigarette smoking is addictive, we know that, 4 nicotine is addictive. 5 instead, this case is about two things. one, 6 it is specifically about mr. tullo and the way he 7 lived his life, smoking for 60 years; and two, it is 8 about whether any of these tobacco companies did 9 anything or said anything that influenced 10 mr. tullo's decisions or behavior. 11 and the evidence is clear in this case that 12 nothing any of the defendant companies did affected 13 mr. tullo's behavior. 14 now, the evidence you heard during this trial 15 shows that mr. tullo started smoking some time way 16 back in the 1930s, obviously, that was a long time 17 ago, and it is not easy for anyone to remember 18 specific details going back that far. 19 but what did we learn? mrs. tullo, along with 20 her daughter and her son, told us he smoked 21 at least seven different brands throughout his 22 life. they may have added a couple vivid memories 23 about specific brands or others that they recall 24 him smoking for certain periods of time. but what 25 did not they tell us? 5183 1 ladies and gentlemen, please remember, you are 2 the investigators here and you are looking at the 3 evidence in this case through a detective's eyes 4 because, after all, you are trying to determine the 5 truth based on the evidence. 6 among other things, your job is to figure out 7 the who, what, where, when, how and why about the 8 facts in this case. 9 now, i have to ask you what do we know about 10 my client's brands, what do we know about liggett 11 cigarettes? 12 well, the who and the what, that is pretty 13 easy. the who is dominick tullo. the what is 14 chesterfield cigarettes, unfiltered cigarettes, by 15 the way. 16 the when and the where, that is also pretty 17 easy. we know he is living back in new york city, 18 and it was the late 1940s, or so. he recently got 19 married or got involved and then married with his 20 wife, mrs. tullo. 21 the how and the why, however, they did not 22 exactly say that. sure, we know he switched 23 smoking the chesterfields at some point before the 24 first smoking house studies came out linking 25 smoking to cancer. but the details become kind of 5184 1 hazy about chesterfield cigarettes. 2 in other words, we do not know exactly why 3 dominick tullo started smoking or switched to 4 smoking chesterfields in his mid-20s. we also 5 learned that he switched -- i'm sorry -- and it 6 still remains vague about how much he actually 7 smoked. 8 well, we know he switched to chesterfield 9 around the late 1940s. we also learned he switched 10 to five different brands over the next decade or 11 so. truthfully, as we sit here today, we still 12 do not know much about his use of any of those 13 brands, and those brands including chesterfield. 14 please remember, plaintiffs counsel, 15 mr. hammer and mr. gdanski, they have the burden of 16 proof here, it is their job to prove their claims 17 against each defendant, and yet they never provided 18 details about mr. tullo and any of these brands. 19 now, if the people working at liggett asked me 20 today how long did mr. tullo smoke chesterfield 21 cigarettes, i would have to say, honestly, i do not 22 know. his wife told us something about how he 23 switched to smoking them some time around 65 years 24 ago, but she did not really tell us much else. 25 you have to speculate to determine the amount 5185 1 or length of time that he smoked chesterfields. in 2 other words, you have to guess to solve the 3 investigation. you cannot do that because this is a 4 court of law. 5 your role is to determine the truth, and the 6 evidence leads you to draw a giant question mark 7 about why and how much chesterfield cigarettes 8 mr. tullo smoked among some of the other brands 9 over half a century ago. 10 for that reason alone, plaintiffs have failed 11 to meet their burden. but it does not stop there. 12 to find against liggett in this case you have 13 to ask were liggett cigarettes, were the 14 chesterfields, the legal cause of dominick tullo's 15 death? did chesterfield cigarettes substantially 16 cause or contribute to his lung cancer? 17 you have heard that before from some of the 18 other lawyers. in other words, you have to ask 19 yourself, would mr. tullo have gotten lung cancer 20 if he had never touched liggett cigarettes back 21 over 60 years ago? 22 and the answer to that question is, of course, 23 he smoked other -- dominick tullo smoked other 24 brands other than chesterfield for a majority of 25 his life and he still would have gotten lung 5186 1 cancer. because of that, liggett cigarettes could 2 not have been a legal cause of his death, but, of 3 course, that very fact does not change that there 4 was no evidence presented at trial proving that 5 anything these cigarette companies did or said, and 6 that is including liggett, affected mr. tullo and 7 his smoking decisions in any way. these are some 8 major problems with plaintiffs case. 9 you will recall yesterday, you heard some bits 10 and snippets about dr. burns and a few things he 11 said. dr. burns said that each and every cigarette 12 dominick tullo smoked contributed to his lung 13 cancer. i'm not sure if you recall that, because 14 it was a few days ago, that is an interesting choice 15 of words. he said "contributed." 16 are not you just a little bit curious why he 17 did not say more than that? he did not tell you what 18 does or how much or how many cigarettes is 19 sufficient to cause lung cancer. sure, he drew 20 some map out and did some sort of chain thing but 21 he simply said each one contributes. what does 22 that mean? 23 think of it this way. does each and every 24 bucket of water contribute to filling the lake? 25 sure, each bucket may contribute, but when you take 5187 1 a look at the whole lake, no single bucket can be 2 considered a substantial contribution to filling 3 that lake. 4 and remember, in this case, you have to answer 5 whether certain cigarettes substantially caused 6 dominick tullo's lung cancer. sure, each cigarette 7 may have contributed, but the evidence about 8 chesterfields, as well as some of the other brands, 9 it is so vague it cannot be considered a 10 substantial contribution. 11 in fact, you heard their own expert, and i 12 think that mr. bideau just mentioned it, 13 dr. cummings told you that a person who smoked less 14 than -- had less than a ten-pack year smoking 15 history and then stopped would virtually eliminate 16 any risks to his health. 17 based on the evidence, or the lack thereof, 18 mr. tullo's use of liggett cigarettes was a 19 fraction of that time. and common sense tells us 20 that is not enough to be a legal cause of his death. 21 now, the other day you were read the testimony 22 of mr. morgan and you were played the videotape of 23 dr. farone. now, these two are really easy for me 24 to talk about. simply put, mr. morgan and 25 dr. farone did not say anything about liggett, 5188 1 nothing. both worked for other companies. it 2 should be disregarded when it comes to my client, 3 liggett. in fact, i still have no idea what 4 mr. morgan or dr. farone had anything to do with 5 mr. tullo. 6 you also heard a lot of arguments in this case 7 and testimony that used catch-all statements like 8 the tobacco companies did this or the tobacco 9 companies did that. 10 well, there is a funny saying about 11 generalizations. all generalizations, including 12 this one, are false. in reality, generalizations 13 are unfair, they are inaccurate, they are not really 14 helpful at getting at the truth. 15 with respect to my client, liggett, there is 16 some more straightforward path to the truth. the 17 evidence shows that even going back to the '50s, 18 time and time again liggett acted independently and 19 responsibly. 20 for example, when the first studies came out 21 linking smoking to lung cancer back in the early 22 1950s, what did liggett do? well, you heard from 23 dr. burns and dr. cummings, they confirmed a few 24 things for us. 25 it is undisputed in this case, liggett did not 5189 1 attend this 1953 plaza hotel meeting, liggett did 2 not create or publish that frank statement to 3 cigarette smokers. 4 what did liggett do? instead, it chose to 5 launch its own large-scale effort into smoking 6 health research. this was confirmed by dr. burns 7 and dr. cummings. then they went on and they 8 shared all the results of the research with the 9 surgeon general's advisory committee. that was in 10 1963. 11 do you remember the letter i showed you? i 12 wish i had some sort of overheads, but i do not. 13 but i showed you a letter last week from the 14 surgeon general where it basically praised liggett 15 and their consultant group, arthur d. little, with 16 respected effort and cooperation and eventual 17 contribution to the 1964 report. 18 and i think at one point you also heard 19 dr. cummings -- this is much more recently -- he 20 actually volunteered this on the stand about a 21 no-nicotine cigarette called quest which he finds 22 is helping people quit smoking. well, that 23 cigarette is also marketed by an affiliate of 24 liggett. 25 ladies and gentlemen, those are the facts 5190 1 about my client, liggett. as you know by now, like 2 all trials, this is a case where we have search for 3 the truth. and i will tell you in this case, based 4 on the evidence, there is only one truth when it 5 comes to dominick tullo and his smoking. and what 6 we saw in this courtroom, that truth is no one 7 knows the truth. 8 as we sit here today, we still do not know 9 anything about why mr. tullo switched to any given 10 brand and we have to speculate about how much or 11 how little he smoked of each of the brands they 12 talked about. 13 certainly, apart from making cigarettes, which 14 is perfectly legal, perfectly legal in this 15 country, there is no evidence showing that any of 16 these defendants had any effect or influence on his 17 lifestyle or decisions. 18 instead, what we do know about mr. tullo is he 19 was a hard working man who lived a good life, he 20 raised a great family and he did what he wanted to 21 do. and those are the facts. and those simple 22 facts show that dominick tullo made his own 23 decisions and followed his own path through life. 24 pure and simple, abraham lincoln once said: 25 you cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by 5191 1 evading it today. that statement is as true today 2 as it was 150 years ago. 3 ladies and gentlemen, i ask you, please, use 4 your intelligence and your common sense and retrace 5 the evidence. and when you do that, you will find 6 by the greater weight of the evidence there is no 7 support for their claim for money against liggett 8 and the other defendants in this case. 9 thank you once more for your kind attention to 10 my closing remarks and have a great day. thank 11 you.
