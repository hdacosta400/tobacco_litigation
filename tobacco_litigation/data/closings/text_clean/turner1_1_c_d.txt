22 mr. hohnbaum: i want to add my thanks for 23 your service and your attention. being a juror 24 is not easy. 25 and one of the reasons being a juror is not easy is you are listening to a flood of 2 information in this case, seven or eight days, 3 and it is like you are trying to drink from a 4 fire hose. and you are not given the 5 instructions, you are not given the law until 6 the end of the case, and there are very good 7 reasons for that. but it makes it very 8 challenging, as you are listening to evidence, 9 to figure out, how is that evidence going to 10 help me decide the issues in this? 11 and the plaintiff, except on the statute 12 of limitations, has the burden of proof. they 13 have to tie what you heard on that witness 14 stand to ms. wilkinson. 15 because this case is not about some 16 smokers, other smokers, people who may have 17 been deceived, many people. it is about one 18 person who smoked for 50 years, despite knowing 19 from a very young age that it could kill her 20 and ruin her life. that is not disputed by any 21 of the witnesses you heard from that witness 22 stand. 23 what the plaintiff did in this case, they 24 called their first witness, live, it was 25 dr. cummings. right? dr. cummings talked to you for about a day 2 and a half about general things. that is where 3 the generic comes from: general things. 4 did mr. -- did dr. cummings know anything 5 meaningful about ms. wilkinson? well, he 6 acknowledged on the stand: i know when she was 7 born, i know when she died. i know a couple of 8 brands she smoked. but i do not know why she 9 smoked, how long she smoked. i do not know when 10 she smoked a particular brand. he did not know, 11 nor did he even try to find out, about 12 ms. wilkinson, right? 13 i did not read the depositions. i was not 14 asked to give opinions specific to 15 ms. wilkinson. 16 that was dr. cummings' own testimony in 17 this case. 18 and so what dr. cummings did is he came in 19 and he told you that everybody smoked, right? 20 smoking was normalized. no one knew it was 21 dangerous. information was hidden. 22 that is what dr. cummings told you about 23 what was going on generally, without knowing 24 what was going on with respect to 25 ms. wilkinson. in fact, i asked him: do you know whether 2 her parents forbade smoking? do you know if 3 her brother warned her 100 times that smoking 4 could kill her? 5 and his honest answer was: i do not know. 6 i do not know. 7 so they brought you dr. cummings, and, 8 again, this is what he did not know. he wants 9 to tell you general stuff, but you need to 10 focus to answer the issues on the verdict form, 11 because every issue on the verdict form has one 12 name on it, and it is ms. wilkinson. it is not 13 everybody else. this is ms. wilkinson's issue. 14 they want you, in deciding what 15 ms. wilkinson knew -- this is what she knew: 16 she knew about her father telling her it was 17 bad, her brother telling her it was bad, her 18 sister telling her, her first husband, who she 19 married when she was 16 years old, her first 20 husband telling her smoking is bad for her. 21 sister, the warning labels. at school, at 22 church. she was surrounded by warnings 23 throughout her life. 24 and when you heard testimony from her 25 brother joseph via videotape: i warned her a hundred times. did you hear him say she denied 2 it? she was confused about it? she doubted 3 it? no. 4 when you heard from malloy, mr. malloy and 5 the sister, did anybody say, anybody in this 6 case say she was confused, doubted it or did not 7 understand what she had been told her entire 8 life? 9 dr. cummings comes in here. he shows 10 documents, campaign of doubt, controversy, 11 confusion, people were confused. this was 12 working. he did not know anything about 13 ms. wilkinson. 14 the evidence will -- with ms. wilkinson 15 is, she did know. is there any evidence in 16 this case that she was confused? that she 17 doubted it? that in any way she absorbed the 18 controversy? 19 and the answer to that question is "no," 20 from her own mouth. 21 at some point in time, if somebody is 22 telling you, would not you expect if it was 23 confused and she doubted, that she would say, i 24 do not believe that, i do not believe that? 25 well, i'm not so sure about that. not one single, solitary time in her 2 entire life. 3 generic testimony from dr. cummings, who 4 does not know her, versus very specific factual 5 evidence about ms. wilkinson, because it is her 6 case. plaintiff cannot prove their case by 7 putting up a bunch of offensive documents -- 8 and they are offensive -- and say there is some 9 connection to ms. wilkinson, because there have 10 to be facts connecting, and there are not. 11 she knew throughout her entire life, by 12 the people she trusted, the people who were 13 respected in her eyes, the people she loved, 14 the people who knew, she knew were looking out 15 for her, her entire life, and she told those 16 people -- those people told her smoking is 17 going to ruin your life, it is going to kill 18 you, you should stop. 19 not one single time: confused, doubt. 20 plaintiff's generic case. again, 21 dr. cummings. did he render an addiction 22 opinion in this case? did he say ms. wilkinson 23 was addicted? no. he was not even asked to. 24 he was not asked to give that opinion. 25 he comes in, he talks about all regular smokers are addicted, nicotine, cannot quit, and 2 addicted smokers continue to smoke until they 3 develop a smoking-related disease. okay. that 4 is dr. cummings talking about general people. 5 what do we know about ms. wilkinson? 6 barbara walsh, who knew her for over 20 years, 7 said she smoked willingly, willfully and 8 enjoyable. 9 that is her contemporary, the person she is 10 seeing on a regular basis for over 15, 20 11 years. 12 and what did ms. walsh say about 13 ms. wilkinson? she knew it. she knew what she 14 was doing. she knew that smoking could kill 15 her. how could she not know that smoking could 16 kill her? she knew it could kill her. 17 and the evidence is she could have quit 18 any time, and i'm going to talk more about 19 that. she did quit. and she could have quit 20 at any point in time. 21 mr. rosen discussed documents in the '20s 22 and the '70s about marketing to youth and 23 studying youth. 24 i'm not here to defend that. the question 25 is: what do documents in the 1970s about youth marketing have to do with vivian wilkinson, who 2 was in her 30s and 40s in the 1970s? 3 where is the dot? where is the 4 connection? where is the proof? 5 and ask yourself, why are you hearing 6 evidence about documents in the '70s with 7 respect to youth, when she was 30, 40 years 8 old? 9 no one knows why ms. wilkinson started 10 smoking. mr. wicks, who knew her best, did not 11 have any information about that. he did not 12 have any information about what brand she 13 smoked right out of the box. 14 and we do not know what brand -- we do not 15 know what brand of cigarettes she smoked before 16 the 1960s, when she was an adult, because the 17 only person who gave you testimony about that, 18 first-hand observation, was vivian turner. 19 when she was in elementary school and 20 before that, we do not know what brand she 21 smoked. 22 what did those who knew her tell you about 23 ms. wilkinson? what did the people that knew 24 her tell you? 25 again, ms. walsh. we are going to talk about ms. walsh. willingly, willfully, 2 enjoyably for 50 years, knowing that it could 3 kill her and ruin her life. that is from the 4 family member. 5 i want to start marching through the legal 6 issues and the evidence in this case with the 7 second issue on the verdict form. 8 the second issue on the verdict form is 9 the question of the statute of limitations. it 10 is the only issue in the case that defense has 11 the burden of proof. 12 and it is an issue, as mr. rosen says, 13 that if you resolve this, that the plaintiff's 14 claim is barred by the statute of limitations, 15 the case is over. and that is why i want to 16 address it first. 17 and this is the instruction i'm going to 18 march through. this is the instruction, minus 19 the last paragraph. the last paragraph tells 20 you what the result is if you answer yes or no. 21 this is the meat of the statute of 22 limitations instruction, and i want to go over 23 that with you. 24 ms. wilkinson knew or should have known 25 that she had copd/emphysema, and the date that we know by now is may 5th, 1990. 2 all three pulmonologists in this case, 3 that is, dr. reed, dr. gidel and dr. farber, 4 all three of them agree that she had copd in 5 the 1980s. no dispute in this case that she 6 had the disease. 7 family members and friends, i'm going to 8 show you this, mr. wicks, ms. walsh saw her in 9 the '80s with the hallmark symptoms of copd, 10 and that is shortness of breath. 11 ms. wilkinson knew her shortness of breath 12 was caused by smoking. 13 how do we know that? do we have to guess 14 at that? do we have to speculate about that? 15 how do we know that? 16 she said it. she said it to her brother. 17 and we are going to play that clip. 18 and ms. wilkinson self-treated shortness 19 of breath throughout the 1980s with inhalers. 20 she knew it was caused by smoking. she was 21 using inhalers to help with her shortness of 22 breath. 23 and there is no evidence in this case, 24 zero evidence, for any other explanation for 25 what was causing her shortness of breath other than copd. 2 you heard otherwise healthy. otherwise 3 healthy. excellent health. good health. 4 there is no other explanation for why she was 5 short of breath. 6 barbara, dr. reed, dr. gidel appeared by 7 transcript. so we do not have a picture of 8 them, but they all agreed that she had the 9 disease. 10 and i want to point something out, make 11 this very clear: reynolds does not need to 12 prove that ms. wilkinson was actually diagnosed 13 with copd/emphysema before may 5th, 1990. 14 the issue is not whether there is a 15 medical record, whether we can prove that she 16 had a diagnosis from a doctor prior to may 5th, 17 1990. the first records we have are in 1993. 18 we do not have to prove that she was 19 actually diagnosed. 20 the issue for purposes of the defense, the 21 critical event is not when she was diagnosed, 22 but when her copd/emphysema first manifested 23 itself. 24 we know when her symptoms first manifested 25 itself. and we know she had the disease, right? we looked at the pft from 1993. the 2 pft showed that she had very severe copd in 3 1993, in april of 1993. 4 and there was some discussion about 5 whether or not that was at baseline. and we 6 are going to talk about that, whether that pft 7 was at baseline, whether she was at baseline. 8 you heard testimony that you would not give 9 a pft unless somebody was around baseline. why 10 would you do it? why would it help you? 11 the fact of matter is, they gave her a 12 pft, and they gave her a pft because she was 13 around baseline. otherwise, why do it? 14 this is not a debatable proposition. 15 according to her own witnesses, dr. gidel and 16 dr. reed, did she have severe copd in 1993? 17 "it is your opinion that ms. wilkinson had 18 severe copd, correct? 19 "yes. 20 "and based on numbers like this and the 21 spirometry, would you agree it was very severe? 22 "yes." 23 and remember, folks, this is the grading 24 for copd. very severe is less than thirty percent. 25 severe is 30 to 49 percent. so even if for some reason she is 2 straddling the severe/very severe, she had 3 copd. she was diagnosed with severe or very 4 severe copd in may of 1990. 5 and we know from every single witness in 6 the case that she had it in the late 1980s, and 7 i do not have to guess at it. you do not have to 8 guess at it. here is the testimony from 9 dr. reed, who came in to this courtroom. and 10 what did he tell you? 11 "you agree that more likely than not she 12 had some degree of copd in the late 1980s, 13 correct?" 14 and what was his answer? "yes." 15 no hedging. no fudging. yes. 16 the testimony from dr. gidel. he is never 17 seen anyone go from initial symptoms to severe 18 in less than five years. 19 ms. wilkinson had copd. do not have to 20 prove that it was diagnosed. have to prove 21 that the symptoms first manifested itself. 22 the first hurdle is to prove she had the 23 disease. we have proven that she had the 24 disease. we have done it from their own 25 witnesses, from their mouths. she had the disease. 2 and what do we know from dr. gidel? we 3 know that even patients in the moderate 4 range -- let us go back to that. moderate. way 5 down the spectrum. you have got very severe, 6 severe, moderate. 7 are there patients who have moderate copd 8 and do not experience symptoms? and what was 9 his answer? 10 i would say unlikely. 11 unlikely. even patients with moderate 12 copd, according to their own expert witness in 13 this case, the person who treated 14 ms. wilkinson, testified it was unlikely; that 15 somebody with moderate copd should have at 16 least moderate copd in the 1980s. 17 she had symptoms when the disease first 18 manifested itself. was it before may 5th, 19 1990? barbara walsh's testimony. 20 dan, can you play that? 21 (thereupon, a video clip played as 22 follows:) 23 "question: do you recall ms. wilkinson 24 ever having any difficulty breathing? 25 "answer: yes. "question: do you know approximately when 2 you first observed her having difficulty 3 breathing? 4 "answer: i would say in the late '70s. 5 "question: and how would you describe 6 what you observed about her having difficulty 7 breathing? 8 "answer: that is air, gasping, short 9 gasps, and she used those little inhalers. 10 they were a small amount, but they were pretty 11 good size. you pumped them. i have never used 12 one, so..." 13 (the video clip ended.) 14 mr. hohnbaum: nobody asked her about the 15 inhalers, and she volunteered it. she 16 volunteered that: i saw her having shortness 17 of breath at work, when she was working, and i 18 saw her use the inhalers. 19 she told you that. no one had to ask her 20 a question about whether she was using 21 inhalers. that is what ms. walsh distinctly 22 remembers. 23 what did ms. wilkinson's own brother say 24 about her having symptoms of shortness of 25 breath? would you play that, dan? 2 3 "question: did you tell vivian that 4 cigarettes were causing her shortness of 5 breath? 6 "answer: yes. 7 "question: did you tell vivian that 8 cigarettes were causing her shortness of breath 9 more than once? 10 "answer: oh, god, yes. oh, yes. 11 "question: did vivian ever deny that 12 cigarettes were causing her shortness of 13 breath? 14 "answer: no, she never denied it. 15 "question: did vivian ever agree with you 16 that cigarettes were causing her shortness of 17 breath? 18 "answer: she knew it, yes. i do not know 19 whether she agreed with me or no, but she knew 20 it. 21 "question: did she -- did vivian 22 verbalize to you that she knew that cigarettes 23 were causing shortness of breath?" 24 (the video clip ended.) 25 mr. hohnbaum: did she verbalize that she knew that cigarettes were causing her shortness 2 of breath? 3 yes. 4 and the testimony from mr. wicks is that 5 shortness of breath was in her 40s. in her 6 40s. exactly the time period that we are 7 talking about. she had symptoms. 8 you would have to disbelieve her own 9 brother and you would have to disbelieve 10 someone who worked with her and went to her 11 wedding, her daughter's wedding, about her 12 having her symptoms prior to may 5th, 1990, to 13 find for the plaintiff in this case. 14 so let me address this point. she knew or 15 should have known that there was a reasonable 16 possibility that her copd/emphysema was caused 17 by cigarette smoking. okay? 18 mr. wicks just told you. we proved that. 19 she knew her shortness of breath was caused by 20 her smoking. 21 reasonable possibility that her 22 copd/emphysema was caused by cigarette smoking. 23 she was short of breath, and by her own words 24 knew that that was because of her smoking. 25 and it was not just joseph wicks. it was other family members, according to her brother 2 that saw her have shortness of breath, and told 3 her that smoking caused that shortness of 4 breath. 5 we just heard it from mr. wicks, and 6 mr. wicks told you in that same testimony that 7 her sister -- two sisters, kathy and mary 8 ellen, also told her that her shortness of 9 breath was caused by smoking. 10 cigarettes caused it, and i preached that; 11 lay off them, stop it. from mr. wicks' own 12 mouth. 13 so, look, we do not have to prove that she 14 was actually diagnosed. the critical event is 15 when it first manifested itself. the 16 overwhelming weight of evidence is that it 17 first manifested itself prior to may 5th, 1990. 18 the overwhelming evidence says that. 19 and we know from her own mouth that she 20 knew that the cause of her shortness of breath 21 was smoking. 22 so let us talk about the top part: knew or 23 by the exercise of reasonable care knew, 24 exercise of reasonable care, should have known 25 before may 5th that she had the disease. all right? that she had the disease. 2 let us talk about that. what did dr. gidel 3 tell you? he told you that he has had patients 4 who self-medicate with over-the-counter 5 bronchodilators when they have copd. 6 what did ms. walsh say? 7 will you play that, please? 8 9 "question: did ms. wilkinson -- did you 10 observe ms. wilkinson regularly use an inhaler 11 from the late 1970s until at least through the 12 early 1990s? 13 "answer: yes. yes. 14 "question: you observed her using an 15 inhaler after you became a customer? 16 "answer: oh, yes, yes. 17 "question: and do you know why 18 ms. wilkinson was using the inhaler? 19 "answer: she told me she had a -- in her 20 words, bronchial condition. 21 "question: and did she point to anything 22 or demonstrate anything, what she meant by 23 that? 24 "answer: no. i knew, you know, bronchial 25 had something to do with breathing, and i -- you know, that was -- that was her excuse for 2 using the inhalers. 3 "question: and you remember her using 4 inhalers? 5 "answer: yes. 6 "question: and you remember her using 7 inhalers for how long? 8 "answer: since the late '70s until, i 9 mean -- i mean, every time -- okay. i need 10 to -- okay. where the cash register is here on 11 the bar -- 12 "question: okay. 13 "answer: -- on a pedestal, cabinet, and 14 there is a space around it, her cigarettes 15 would be in one space, and right next to it 16 would be an inhaler." 17 (the video clip ended.) 18 mr. hohnbaum: she knew and remembered 19 precisely where her friend and co-worker, 20 ms. wilkinson, kept her inhaler throughout the 21 '80s. she kept it right on the cash register, 22 next to her cigarettes. 23 she was using an inhaler, and it was 24 making her feel better, and she knew that the 25 shortness of breath that she was having was caused by smoking. 2 this instruction is very important in 3 determining what she knew or by the exercise of 4 reasonable care should have known. 5 sorry. i got turned around. 6 let us talk about barbara walsh. mr. rosen 7 did not say much about barbara walsh. and there 8 is a tension perhaps in the testimony of 9 mr. wilkinson and ms. turner on this point, 10 right? 11 they say they did not observe their mom 12 being short of breath before may -- before her 13 hospitalization in april of 1993, right? 14 that is their testimony. never short of breath. 15 never saw her use an inhaler. 16 then we have the testimony of ms. walsh 17 that she did use an inhaler and she was short 18 of breath. 19 and i have a nine-year-old son. he loves 20 to play -- 21 mr. rosen: objection, move to strike. 22 the court: jury, disregard the last 23 comment, please. 24 mr. hohnbaum: -- with jigsaw puzzles, 25 jigsaw puzzles. the satisfaction of putting that piece of the puzzle together so that it 2 fits. so that it fits. 3 what do we know about barbara walsh? 4 she worked with her, ms. wilkinson, for 5 five years, often saw her at eddie's place when 6 she was a customer, for 15 years. 7 she received the same information that 8 ms. walsh -- ms. wilkinson did, right? they 9 were in the same environment. same generation 10 and background. 11 she was friendly with ms. wilkinson. she 12 described her as nice, intelligent. she said 13 she was a loving mom. she said ms. turner was 14 a loving daughter. 15 she came in and was talking about 16 ms. wilkinson in a nice way. she said she was 17 hard working. barbara walsh has not a single 18 interest in this case. she has absolutely no 19 reason to come into this case and not tell the 20 truth, which is what she swore to do. 21 pieces of the jigsaw puzzle. putting them 22 together. putting them together. 23 how can ms. walsh's testimony be true and 24 the testimony of ms. turner and mr. wilkinson 25 be true? and the fact of the matter is, it is not hard to see how that can be. 2 we know from the testimony that she was 3 not -- ms. wilkinson was not the type to 4 complain about her health. she was not the 5 type to complain about her health. 6 she did not discuss medications with her 7 children. she did not discuss what she was 8 going through. 9 vivian turner did not know she had been 10 hospitalized. did not know that she had been 11 hospitalized. that was on the medical record. 12 her mom made a decision not to share that 13 information with her daughter. 14 ms. wilkinson -- ms. turner did not know 15 she was taking an antibiotic. remember the 16 doxycycline? 17 "did you know your mom was on prescription 18 medication prior to april of '93 when she was 19 in the hospital? 20 "no, i did not know that." 21 they never noticed that she had a health 22 problem before she was hospitalized. 23 and mr. wilkinson: i never talked about 24 the health risks of smoking with her. 25 ms. wilkinson hid for her entire life, until the depositions in this case, the fact 2 that she had three other children. 3 hid from her, ms. turner, and 4 mr. wilkinson, that she was married before, the 5 name of that person. 6 think of the energy and the resolve over 7 the course of their entire life never to share 8 anything about that. 9 and ask yourself: how hard is it to hide 10 an inhaler? you put it in a pocket. you do it 11 in the bathroom. you do it when they are not 12 around. 13 and, of course, when she needed it the 14 most was at work, when she was exerting 15 herself. that is when she needed to use the 16 inhaler. 17 and who is the best witness? who is the 18 one that was around for most at work? it was 19 barbara walsh. 20 we have to look at the undisputed evidence 21 that we all agree to, to know that 22 ms. wilkinson was quite good at hiding her 23 physical discomfort. 24 and why do we know that? in this case, 25 she went in the hospital on april 20th, 1993. according to her children, before that, before 2 that date, she was in excellent health. i have 3 never seen her short of breath. she was doing 4 great. 5 in fact, ms. turner said it was a 6 traumatic event. i had no idea. all of a 7 sudden my mom is in the hospital. she is in the 8 hospital. 9 but what do we know about the six months 10 leading up to it from ms. wilkinson's own 11 mouth? her symptoms were getting progressively 12 worse. she was not doing well. she was taking 13 an antibiotic. she was so short of breath and 14 was having such a problem, she went to the 15 emergency room, which she apparently had never 16 done before, and her children, who were around 17 her, at least ms. turner, around her on a 18 weekly, a couple-of-times-a-week basis, did not 19 notice a thing. did not notice a thing. 20 she did not want them to know. that is how 21 mr. wilkinson and ms. turner are telling you 22 she was in good health. i never saw her use an 23 inhaler. 24 but ms. walsh did. and we know how 25 successful ms. wilkinson was at sharing some parts of her life with her kids and not sharing 2 other parts of her life with her kids. 3 so what did she know before may 5th, 1990? 4 what do we know was on the packs of cigarettes? 5 we know that after 1985, one of the rotating 6 warnings was smoking causes what? emphysema. 7 what did she know? she knew on the packs 8 of cigarettes that smoking causes emphysema, 9 for more than five years before may 5th, 1990. 10 we had this saturday evening post article. 11 mr. wicks said that was one of the publications 12 that he saw in her house, the saturday evening 13 post. 14 emphysema, stalking the susceptible. and 15 this was the checklist. remember we went 16 through this checklist? do i smoke? am i 17 short of breath? you should consult a 18 physician. 19 what do we know about her reading? she 20 read. she was intelligent. she kept up with 21 current events. 22 what was she told from the newspapers? 23 emphysema on the increase. quit smoking. 24 needs treatment. and the disease that takes 25 your breath away. that was the information she was getting. 2 she was getting it on her pack of cigarettes 3 from 1985 on. she was getting it from 4 newspapers. and, of course, she was getting 5 throughout her life that what she was doing was 6 harmful to her. was harmful to her. 7 i know that the smoking was causing my 8 shortness of breath. 9 she knew before may 5th, 1990, that she 10 had copd/emphysema. 11 but, look, even if you determine we 12 have not proven that she knew that she had it 13 before may 5th, 1990, the next clause, we 14 certainly have proven that: by the exercise of 15 reasonable care, she should have known this, 16 she should have known. 17 i jumped the gun before. this is the 18 instruction that i wanted you to see. here is 19 what it tells you about the standard of care: 20 in the exercise of reasonable care, you 21 may consider whether she was negligent in 22 failing to learn that she had copd/emphysema, 23 or that there was a reasonable probability that 24 it was caused by smoking. 25 negligence is the failure to use reasonable care -- here it is; what i want you 2 to focus on -- which is the care that a 3 reasonably careful person would use under like 4 circumstances. 5 for over a decade, she was self-treating 6 with inhalers that she was getting from 7 emergency medical professionals at the bar that 8 she worked and frequented. for over a decade, 9 self-treating. she should have known. 10 by reading the articles, looking at 11 newspapers, by talking to people, by talking to 12 the people in the bar, she should have known. 13 it is a nifty two-step to put up testimony 14 that the tobacco companies were denying it at 15 that point in time. that is not the question. 16 the question is what she knew or should have 17 known. what she knew or should have known. 18 and we know what she was experiencing. 19 and what would a reasonable careful person have 20 done sometime in the decade or so that she is 21 using an inhaler to treat the symptoms? what 22 would a reasonable person do? 23 a reasonable person goes to a doctor. 24 sometime in there, go to a doctor. she is using 25 an inhaler. what do you do? you go to a doctor. 2 the inhalers, ladies and gentlemen, were 3 working. why would she use them? they were 4 making her feel better. they were helping her 5 symptoms. 6 why would you use something over a decade 7 if it was not helping you? that is the 8 recognition: that i've got a problem; this 9 medication, this prescription medication is 10 helping the problem. a reasonable person goes 11 and sees a doctor. 12 and what we know from the testimony on the 13 witness stand was that if she had gone to a 14 doctor and said, i smoke, i'm using an inhaler, 15 it is helping me feel better, i'm getting 16 shortness of breath at my work, what would that 17 doctor have done? he would have done a pft, 18 and we already know what that pft would have 19 shown by the testimony of dr. reed, dr. gidel 20 and dr. farber: it would have shown that, in 21 fact, she had copd, all well before may 5th, 22 1990. 23 a reasonable person experiencing those 24 symptoms figures out what the problem is, or 25 goes to a doctor and is diagnosed. this was from the opening. mr. rosen did 2 something similar to this about our statute of 3 limitations defense. 4 remember he had barbara walsh on one side 5 and the slide in the closing was checkmarked 6 next to everybody else. 7 but, look, joseph wicks, his testimony is 8 spot on. she had symptoms prior to may 5th, 9 1990. she knew it was caused by smoking. 10 joseph wicks supports the defense's statute of 11 limitations. 12 dr. gidel supports the statute of 13 limitations: unlikely, very unlikely not to 14 have symptoms, and certainly more likely than 15 not had the disease prior to may 5th, 1990. 16 she supports the defense. 17 dr. reed, the same thing: she had the 18 disease in the '90s. symptoms of shortness of 19 breath are clearly related. 20 and the medical records do not refute it. 21 they support it, right? you cannot go from very 22 severe or severe copd in 1993 overnight. it 23 takes years to develop. 24 those medical records of the severity of 25 the disease in '93 and '98 support, and do not refute it, that she had the disease, and it was 2 significant enough to cause symptoms. 3 this is the law. this is the law to 4 follow in this case. and the fact is we have 5 proven by the greater weight of the evidence 6 that ms. wilkinson knew or in the exercise of 7 reasonable care should have known before 8 may 5th, 1990, that she had copd/emphysema. 9 can you flip this on? thank you. 10 you have got the verdict form. you will 11 have the verdict form. these are the questions 12 that you will have to ask -- you will have to 13 answer, okay? 14 and the second question, that is the one 15 i've been talking about: did vivian wilkinson 16 know or by the exercise of reasonable care 17 should have known that she had copd/emphysema, 18 and that there was a reasonable possibility 19 that the copd/emphysema was caused by cigarette 20 smoke? 21 and the answer is yes. 22 thank you. 23 okay. let me talk about the first issue 24 on the verdict form: class membership. the 25 plaintiff has to prove addiction and addiction causation. 2 two components to that. must prove that 3 she was addicted to nicotine, and even if they 4 prove to your satisfaction by the greater 5 weight of the evidence that she was addicted, 6 they also have to prove that that addiction, as 7 opposed to her decision to keep smoking, was a 8 legal cause of her death from copd. 9 and, again, this is the plaintiff's 10 burden. the only burden of proof we have is on 11 issue two on the verdict form. this is their 12 burden of proof, and they have to do it like 13 with everything else, like we just marched 14 through with that: with evidence, with facts. 15 let us talk about addiction. did plaintiff 16 prove that ms. wilkinson was medically 17 addicted? 18 not addicted in the common sense of the 19 word, not addicted in what you might think it 20 means, not addicted in what somebody might 21 think, but what a professional -- 22 mr. rosen: your honor, i'm going to 23 object. 24 mr. hohnbaum: -- who diagnoses -- 25 the court: sustained. mr. hohnbaum: -- what a professional -- 2 mr. rosen: move to strike. 3 the court: i sustained the objection, 4 counsel. 5 mr. hohnbaum: did plaintiff prove that 6 she was medically -- 7 mr. rosen: again, move to strike, your 8 honor. it is not the proper standard. 9 the court: counsel, go ahead. 10 mr. hohnbaum: here is what they brought 11 you. dr. drobes. he has not treated a patient 12 in 13 years. he is a researcher. no harm in 13 that. noble calling. somebody who spends his 14 time doing research. 15 for the last 13 years, he is not treated 16 any patients for any sort of addiction, and he 17 is not, by his own admission, a medical doctor. 18 dr. reed, he came in and he told you that 19 ms. wilkinson was addicted. 20 but i asked him: do you consider yourself 21 to be an expert on addiction? 22 and what was his answer? no. 23 he was very forthright about that. and, 24 of course, he was not -- he is not a 25 psychiatrist, has not been trained. and, of course, by the time she got to dr. reed, what 2 did his notes say? she had already quit. so, 3 of course, he did not treat her because she had 4 already quit smoking. 5 and dr. cummings, who, in fact, does see 6 patients, has seen patients, written 7 stop-smoking guides, did dr. cummings, with 8 that level of expertise, "world-renowned" i 9 think is the word we heard, did he give an 10 opinion about whether or not ms. wilkinson was 11 addicted? no, he did not. he did not have any 12 information about her. 13 this is one of the tests that dr. drobes 14 used with you: the fagerstrom test. this test, 15 as dr. barnett said, is not used to diagnose 16 people with nicotine addiction. 17 in fact, it assumes that whoever is taking 18 the test is addicted, and at the bottom it 19 says: how addicted are you? very low level to 20 very high level. 21 and there are questions on there that he 22 answered -- this is one of those points where i 23 asked him -- mr. keehfus asked him that first 24 question: how soon after you get up do you 25 start smoking? that is one of those questions you are not 2 sure how that fits in. 3 and he said: well, she does it within the 4 first five minutes. 5 but then when you drill down on that, the 6 fact of the matter is no one knows -- no one 7 testified to how soon she smoked when she got 8 up. and so he is crediting that she smoked 9 within the five minutes without any testimony. 10 and why, if all you need to establish is 11 that somebody smoked a pack a day for a year, 12 five years, 10 years, 40 years, if all you need 13 is quantity, why did it take him going through 14 this test, why did it take him hours to talk 15 about it? because more is required than just 16 quantity. more is required than that. 17 dr. barnett, the only psychiatrist to 18 diagnose ms. -- to assess ms. wilkinson for 19 nicotine addiction. the only psychiatrist. 20 like dr. drobes, she applied what? the 21 american psychiatric association diagnostic and 22 statistical manual no. 5, put out by 23 psychiatrists, used by psychiatrists. 24 dr. drobes is not a psychiatrist. 25 and she went through the criteria for you, and she said she was not addicted to the 2 nicotine in cigarettes. 3 she also said that half of all daily 4 smokers are not addicted. half are, half 5 are not. 6 people who smoke -- a quantity -- if it 7 just was, you have to smoke a pack a day for a 8 certain number of years, check, that would be a 9 pretty simple exercise. and it is not simple. 10 it requires clinical judgment, is what 11 dr. barnett told you. and it is what 12 dr. drobes told you. 13 it takes clinical judgment to determine 14 whether or not someone meets the criteria under 15 the dsm-iv. 16 and, of course, we know that people smoke 17 for reasons other than addiction. we know that 18 people smoke for reasons other than nicotine. 19 dr. barnett listed those. people enjoy the 20 smell, enjoy the taste, they enjoy the ritual. 21 it is satisfying to them. 22 and we know that ms. wilkinson smoked. 23 witnesses on the stand and through the videos 24 said she enjoyed smoking. she smoked for 25 social reasons. she liked going to the bar. she went to the bar that she worked at, where 2 95 percent of the customers smoked, even when 3 she was not working there. she liked -- she 4 liked to smoke. she liked to socialize with 5 people at the bar. 6 and she never told anyone that he was 7 addicted. she never said, i'm addicted. 8 ms. wilkinson was not addicted. that is 9 the reason to answer that question "no." 10 but even if you find that she was 11 addicted, that is not the end of the analysis, 12 because the instruction could not be clearer 13 that you have to prove that the addiction -- 14 that but for an addiction to cigarettes 15 containing nicotine, the copd/emphysema would 16 not have occurred. it is not enough just to 17 establish that she was addicted. 18 and this is a helpful way to look at it: 19 did she have the ability to quit and chose to 20 continue smoking, or was she compelled to 21 smoke, leaving her no choice and becoming just 22 sort of a robot that had to have the next 23 cigarette. 24 and here is what we know from the 25 witnesses: addiction does not prevent smokers from quitting. addicted smokers can and do 2 quit. any smoker, any smoker can quit. 3 of course, we know she never tried to quit 4 while she was smoking rj reynolds cigarettes. 5 the first evidence that we have in this 6 case that she started -- that she tried to quit 7 was in the late '70s. 8 millions and millions and millions and 9 millions of people have quit smoking. heavily 10 addicted smokers quit smoking. you can quit 11 smoking. she could quit smoking. 12 look, were the cigarettes she was smoking 13 different than the cigarette that was smoked by 14 the 60 million people who quit? of course it 15 was not. did if affect her brain differently? 16 were they exposed to advertising any 17 differently? did she smoke longer? no. 18 was she different from her brother, who we 19 know chose to quit, and quit? of course not. 20 she made the choice to continue to smoke. 21 what do we know about her? what do we 22 know about this woman? we know she was 23 strong-willed, hard to move off an idea, 24 intelligent, independent. she did what she 25 wanted to do. this is what i was going to do. that is 2 the type of woman that she was. if she set her 3 mind to quit, she would have quit. 4 of course, we know at some point in time 5 she did have some problem with alcohol. it 6 ruined her first marriage. she conquered that, 7 managed that. she was able to work through 8 that and successfully deal with it. 9 what do we know, keith malloy never saw 10 her try to quit. vivian turner never saw until 11 early -- try to quit in the '60s. 12 ms. walsh, her contemporary, ms. walsh 13 never, in the '70s, '80s or '90s, the person 14 she came back to the bar with and hung out 15 with, the patron at the bar, never tried to 16 quit, never talked about quitting, never said 17 it was hard, never saw her try to quit. 18 of course, what do the medical records 19 say? she did quit. she quit starting at least 20 by april/may of 1998. she did stop. 21 dr. reed, i went through the whole 22 exercise with him: "are those records accurate 23 that she quit?" 24 what did he say? "yes." 25 and every record after that said that she quit. 2 if somebody comes into the emergency room, 3 that they have been smoking, do people know 4 that they are smoking? can they smell it? of 5 course they can smell it. he said: my records 6 are accurate. she quit. 7 the first issue on the verdict form: was 8 she addicted? and even if so, was the 9 addiction the legal cause of her chronic 10 obstructive pulmonary disease/emphysema? the 11 answer to that question is "no." 12 it is "no" on addicted, and "no" on 13 addiction causation. 14 can you go back, please? 15 the last question i'm going to address, 16 and then i'm going to turn it over to 17 mr. keehfus, the third issue on the verdict 18 form: was smoking cigarettes manufactured by 19 rj reynolds a legal cause of her copd/emphysema 20 and death? there is only one defendant in this 21 case: it is rj reynolds. 22 this is the instruction. like with all of 23 this, that is your guide. that is the law of 24 the case that you have been instructed by the 25 judge you must follow and that you have agreed to follow. the copd must be caused by 2 reynolds' products. 3 there is no evidence that she was ever 4 impacted by advertising. did you ever see -- 5 you heard a part on that by philip morris, but 6 not by rj reynolds. 7 never heard a statement by anyone at rj 8 reynolds. no evidence that she started smoking 9 a reynolds product when she started smoking. 10 no evidence that she smoked a light cigarette 11 manufactured by rj reynolds, or a low-tar 12 cigarette. 13 she smoked parliament for more than 14 20 years, from 1975 until 1998. the only light 15 cigarette -- you heard testimony about 16 lights -- was parliament light. and how long 17 did she smoke it? intermittently, on and off 18 for a year. 19 we talked about this in openings. is it 20 seven years? is it six years? is it 10 years? 21 it is in that ballpark, ladies and gentlemen of 22 the jury. 23 and we know that smoking cigarettes for 24 seven years, eight years, nine years, 10 years, 25 is not enough. it is not sufficient to cause copd. not likely to cause it. 2 and you heard from dr. farber that she 3 would have developed copd/emphysema anyway, 4 because you take that time period out, the six 5 years, is it five years, is it 10 years, you 6 take that time period out, and she still would 7 have gotten copd/emphysema. of course she 8 would have. she smoked for 50 years. 9 was smoking cigarettes manufactured by rj 10 reynolds tobacco company a legal cause of 11 ms. wilkinson's copd/emphysema and death? 12 the answer to that question is "no." 13 thank you again for your service, and i'm 14 going to turn it over to mr. keehfus. thank 15 you. 21 mr. keehfus: may it please the court. 22 good afternoon, ms. turner, counsel. 23 good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 24 jurors: good afternoon. 25 mr. keehfus: i have the pleasure today to discuss with you the remaining questions on the 2 verdict form, the questions that you are going 3 to decide in this case. and those will be 4 questions 4 through question 8. 5 now, you should not get this far, because 6 as mr. hohnbaum explained, the evidence 7 demonstrates that you should return a defense 8 verdict on the issue of statute of limitations, 9 question 2. 10 and further as mr. hohnbaum described to 11 you, there has been a failure of proof, a 12 complete failure of proof on the plaintiff's 13 part that ms. wilkinson was a class member. 14 but i have an obligation to discuss all of 15 the issues in the case. so in the event that 16 you do get this far, i'm going to discuss with 17 you why there has been a complete failure of 18 proof on the rest of plaintiff's claims. 19 i'm going to start with questions 4 and 5 20 because they go together. and those are 21 plaintiff's claims of concealment and agreement 22 to conceal. 23 and, ladies and gentlemen, you heard judge 24 murphy read the instructions to you this 25 morning. those instructions in this case are critical. no matter what it is in our lives, 2 whether it is putting together legos, whether 3 it is fixing your toilet at the house, whether 4 it is putting in a new flood light, the 5 instructions tell you everything that you need 6 to know. 7 and this case is no different. the legal 8 instructions that the judge has read to you 9 tell you everything you need to know to answer 10 the claims in this case. 11 those are the legal principles and the 12 legal rules that you have to apply to the facts 13 that you have been presented to render your 14 verdict, the facts that you have been 15 presented, not argument. as the judge 16 instructed you, lawyer argument is not evidence. 17 rhetoric, catch phrases are not evidence. you 18 need proof. you need facts to apply. 19 for example, a lawyer saying that 20 ms. wilkinson relied on concealment and that 21 reliance was a legal cause of her 22 copd/emphysema is not evidence. that is not 23 facts. that is an argument. 24 so we are going to look at the facts, 25 because the instructions are critical. and because the instructions tell you what you need 2 to know to answer these claims, i want to take 3 a look at those. 4 this is instruction no. 15 in your 5 booklet. number 15. and instruction 15 and 6 instruction 16 go together. they deal with 7 those questions, no. 4 and no. 5, on 8 concealment and agreement to conceal. 9 and what i would like to do is highlight 10 three very important parts of instruction 11 no. 15 for you. again, these are the rules 12 that will guide you in your determination. 13 and what you were instructed on 14 plaintiff's claim for fraudulent concealment is 15 that the issue for your determination is 16 whether vivian wilkinson reasonably relied to 17 her detriment on any statement of material fact 18 by rj reynolds tobacco company that concealed 19 or omitted material information not otherwise 20 known or available, not otherwise known or 21 available, concerning the health effects or 22 addictive nature of smoking cigarettes. 23 that is the first critical part of the 24 instruction. 25 the second part, we are going to focus on as we go along is that of material facts. we 2 know that the plaintiffs have to prove a 3 material fact, that something that was 4 concealed was material. it was a game-changer. 5 what does that mean? a material fact, as 6 you were instructed, is one that is of such 7 importance that ms. wilkinson would not have 8 acted as she did but for the concealment or 9 omission of that fact. it is one -- it is one 10 of such importance that she would not have 11 acted as she did. 12 that is plaintiff's burden, to prove to 13 you with evidence that but for concealment of 14 some fact, ms. wilkinson would not have acted 15 as she did, she would not have continued to 16 smoke. if she had known that material fact, 17 she would have changed her behavior by quitting 18 smoking. 19 that is the inquiry when you get to 20 question 4: did the plaintiff prove to you 21 with evidence that ms. wilkinson would have 22 changed her behavior had she known something 23 else. 24 they did not. there is a complete failure 25 of proof on that point. and we will discuss that. 2 the third section i would like to 3 highlight of this instruction is critical. 4 ms. wilkinson cannot be found to have 5 reasonably relied on a statement if she knew it 6 was false or its falsity was obvious to her, or 7 if the fact allegedly concealed was already 8 known to her. she cannot be found to have 9 relied, if that fact, allegedly concealed -- if 10 she already knew it. 11 so those are the three critical parts of 12 this instruction that we need to keep in mind 13 as we go through the verdict form. 14 and the plaintiffs very simply have failed 15 to prove concealment. they failed to prove 16 that ms. wilkinson relied on some tobacco 17 industry statement that concealed or omitted 18 information that she did not already know. 19 they have to prove this connection, this 20 link between statements the tobacco industry 21 made and ms. wilkinson's conduct and 22 ms. wilkinson's injuries. 23 and they failed to do that. there is zero 24 evidence in this case. again, the instructions 25 are important, because they tell you, you cannot conceal what someone already knows. and 2 that makes perfect sense. you cannot take that 3 knowledge away from someone after she knows it. 4 you cannot conceal something from someone 5 who already knows that fact from another 6 source. you cannot hide something in plain 7 sight. 8 plaintiff has to prove that a statement 9 made by rj reynolds reached ms. wilkinson and 10 it impacted her in a material way, in order to 11 succeed on this claim. 12 they failed to do that. why did they fail 13 to do that? we know. we know from your 14 instruction, she cannot rely on a statement if 15 the fact that was allegedly concealed was 16 already known to her. 17 as mr. hohnbaum briefly explained earlier 18 this afternoon, and i'm going to go into more 19 detail, ms. wilkinson was warned about and knew 20 the dangers of smoking her entire life. that 21 information was known and available to her 22 throughout her life. 23 what was the evidence on that? in 24 summary, ms. wilkinson knew that smoking was 25 dangerous in the 1940s. she knew that smoking could kill her in the 1940s. and she never 2 disputed that smoking was dangerous and 3 addictive; not once throughout her entire life. 4 you cannot conceal something from -- you 5 cannot conceal from someone when she already 6 knows it, and ms. wilkinson knew it. 7 you heard several times in this case about 8 doubt, confusion. there was no doubt and no 9 confusion. there was no evidence that 10 ms. wilkinson ever expressed doubt or confusion 11 about the dangers of smoking. 12 instead, she verbalized to those around 13 her that she understood those dangers. 14 ladies and gentlemen, if there is one fact 15 in this case that is beyond dispute, 16 ms. wilkinson understood the dangers of smoking 17 since the time she started smoking. 18 how do we know that? well, we have the 19 testimony from her brother joseph wicks. 20 21 "question: when you were growing up, did 22 your parents allow you to smoke in the house? 23 "answer: no, i never smoked. my daddy 24 would not allow that, period. 25 "question: what did your dad say to you about smoking when you were growing up? 2 "answer: i can remember, when he caught 3 me and my brother sneaking his cigarettes, and 4 he made us set down and smoke a pack, and we 5 almost died. i do remember that. 6 "question: did he say anything to you 7 when he caught you smoking? 8 "answer: yes. you know, he was always 9 against that. bad health, you know, ruin your 10 health, ruin your life. 11 "question: did your father tell you that 12 cigarettes were bad for your health? 13 "answer: yes. 14 "question: did your father tell you that 15 cigarettes would ruin your life? 16 "answer: yes. 17 "question: did he tell you those things 18 more than once when you were growing up? 19 "answer: lots of times. lots of times. 20 "question: were you the only sibling that 21 your father told those things to? 22 "answer: no. my brother, too. i'm 23 pretty sure he lectured my sisters, too. 24 "question: your father was an equal 25 opportunity lecturer on the subject? "answer: yes 2 "question: do you think that your father 3 told you that cigarettes were bad for your 4 health more than 10 times when you were growing 5 up? 6 "answer: oh, god, yes. oh, yes. 7 "question: it is something that he told 8 you a lot, huh? 9 "answer: a lot. 10 "question: did your father continue to 11 tell you that cigarettes were bad for your 12 health after you were an adult? 13 "answer: yes. i can remember when i came 14 back from world war ii, i went to meet my dad." 15 (the video clip ended.) 16 mr. keehfus: ladies and gentlemen, this 17 was the environment that ms. wilkinson grew up 18 in, the environment where her parents did not 19 allow smoking; where her father was such a 20 staunch antismoking advocate when he discovered 21 her brothers smoking that he sat them down and 22 made them smoke an entire pack of cigarettes. 23 and you heard how mr. wicks reacted to that. 24 you heard a lot about the culture back 25 then, how things were different. in ms. wilkinson's home, that was the 2 culture; the culture of smoking being 3 prohibited, and her father telling her and her 4 siblings that smoking would ruin your life. 5 that was the culture. that was the 6 environment ms. wilkinson grew up in. that was 7 the information known to her. 8 as mr. hohnbaum told you the evidence is 9 overwhelming that ms. wilkinson lived in a 10 world of warnings, surrounded by warnings from 11 every source: family, friends, pop culture, 12 slang, her sister, her own body. 13 ms. wilkinson knew. she knew smoking was 14 dangerous. and she knew it for 50 years. 15 that is the information that ms. wilkinson 16 knew. she cannot be found to have reasonably 17 relied on a statement if the fact allegedly 18 concealed was already known to her. 19 you heard the testimony of ms. walsh. i 20 do not think we need to play it again. but you 21 heard the testimony of ms. walsh that their 22 boss, wanda sarussi, at eddie's place, sat them 23 down and had a very frank and candid 24 conversation with them about the dangers of 25 smoking. you will recall ms. walsh testified that 2 ms. sarussi had quit smoking. she talked to 3 both of them, ms. walsh and ms. wilkinson, 4 together. and she said: quit smoking. 5 what else did she say? a familiar refrain 6 in ms. wilkinson's life. ms. sarussi told her: 7 smoking will ruin her life, just like her 8 father has told her, just like joseph wicks had 9 told her. 10 ms. sarussi just confirmed what 11 ms. wilkinson already knew: smoking was 12 dangerous, and it would ruin her life. and she 13 chose to continue smoking. 14 and ms. walsh was right there for the 15 conversation. she was able to observe 16 ms. wilkinson's reactions. and what did she 17 testify to? i'm sure she knew. 18 of course she knew. the evidence is 19 overwhelming that she knew, and there is been no 20 attempt to say that ms. wilkinson did not know 21 the dangers of smoking. 22 it was not simply in ms. wilkinson's home. 23 the dangerous and addictive nature of 24 cigarettes has been public knowledge for more 25 than 100 years. that is what dr. cummings told you on cross-examination. 2 now a word about dr. cummings. he is the 3 witness the plaintiffs -- the first live 4 witness the plaintiff's brought; and as you 5 heard, he is the witness that travels from 6 courtroom to courtroom testifying against 7 tobacco companies. he is testified in over 80 8 trials against tobacco companies. and he is 9 been doing it for 20 years. 10 and this is what he conceded on 11 cross-examination. now, it was not always easy. 12 mr. hohnbaum, over 20 times, had to show him 13 his prior sworn testimony, but this is what he 14 conceded: 15 for over 100 years, the public has known 16 nicotine occurs naturally in tobacco; that it 17 can be difficult to quit smoking; smoking is 18 dangerous and addictive; and tobacco use can 19 cause cancer. 20 remember, the plaintiff has to prove 21 reliance on a statement that concealed 22 information not otherwise known or available. 23 this was known and available for over 100 24 years. 25 what else did dr. cummings tell you? by 1954, virtually everyone knew that smoking 2 caused disease. 3 and we know in this case, ms. wilkinson 4 knew 10 years prior to that, when she was 5 growing up in the 1940s. that was the 6 testimony that you just heard from mr. wicks. 7 mr. wicks told you when he came back from 8 the war, he started warning her that smoking 9 would kill her. ten years prior to 1954. 10 now in 1954, ms. wilkinson was 21 years 11 old. she had three children and was married. 12 she was an adult. 13 dr. cummings told you that this conspiracy 14 to conceal started in december of 1953; and 15 then in cross-examination, conceded that by 16 1954, virtually everyone knew smoking could 17 cause disease. 18 known and available. the public had been 19 extensively warned prior to 1964. 20 dr. leroy burney, the surgeon general at 21 the time, in the moment, in real time, in 1957, 22 dr. burney said: the message is getting out. 23 we have informed the public. 24 dr. heller, the national cancer institute, 25 similar. boots on the ground. in 1957, not looking back 40 years, he was there in real 2 time: excellent job covering the problem, and 3 a very objective job, a valuable way of 4 informing the public. the message was out 5 there. 6 this information was known and available. 7 what were smokers doing with that 8 information? well, we know millions of highly 9 addicted smokers quit before ms. wilkinson ever 10 smoked an rj reynolds cigarette. 11 you can see on this timeline. between 12 1950 and 1965, over 17 million people quit. 13 between 1964 and 1979, 30 million people in 14 that 15 years quit; two million people every 15 year. 16 the information was out there, and people 17 were making a decision to quit. 18 now, there was some discussion in this 19 case about the warning labels that went on in 20 1966. you may recall dr. cummings' testimony 21 about what little effect they had. 22 but on cross-examination, he conceded that 23 between 1966 and 1970, 13 million people quit 24 in those four years. in those four years, 25 after that warning label on went on, 13 million people quit. 2 what did dr. cummings say? that was the 3 largest four-year decline in american history. 4 the message was out there; the information 5 about the dangers of smoking was known; it was 6 available to ms. wilkinson; and it was getting 7 through to people. 8 dr. cummings conceded that virtually 9 everyone had heard about the 1964 surgeon 10 general's report at that time. 11 how do we know that? well, the evidence 12 was it was major news across the country, and 13 in florida. you may recall that map of florida 14 that showed the newspaper articles north to 15 south, from tallahassee to miami, and east to 16 west. 17 every major newspaper in florida covered 18 the story above the fold, front page, 19 publicizing the conclusions of the 1964 surgeon 20 general's report that smoking was a cause of 21 cancer. 22 the information was known, and it was 23 available. 24 and we know that ms. wilkinson heard about 25 the 1964 surgeon general's report because her brother told her about it. 2 he learned about it in 1964, and he told 3 his entire family, including ms. wilkinson, 4 about the surgeon general's report. 5 you cannot conceal something from someone 6 when they already know. that is the 7 instruction you have been given. 8 there is warnings by the public health 9 community. dr. daniel horn, in 1968, he was 10 one of the famous researchers that you heard 11 about that worked with the american cancer 12 society, one of the leading experts on the 13 dangers of smoking in the 1950s, '60s and '70s. 14 this is what he said: you can stand on a 15 rooftop and shout "smoking is dangerous" at the 16 top of your lungs. you would not be telling 17 anyone anything that they did not already know. 18 no one needed to stand on a rooftop at 19 ms. wilkinson's house because she already knew 20 it. by 1968, she had known for over 20 years 21 that smoking was dangerous. 22 we know the warning labels were on 23 cigarettes. every pack of reynolds' 24 cigarettes, anyone who saw ms. wilkinson smoke, 25 carried a federally mandated warning label. there is no dispute that ms. wilkinson saw 2 those warning labels at least 20 times a day. 3 she picked up that pack of cigarettes 20 times 4 a day. can there be any dispute that she saw 5 that warning label? she continued to smoke. 6 and that was her choice. 7 the court instructed you regarding the 8 warning labels that after july 1, 1969, those 9 warning labels are adequate as a matter of law 10 and cannot be challenged. 11 the only advertisement that any witness 12 recalled ms. wilkinson seeing was after 1969. 13 why is that important? because after 14 1969, every cigarette advertisement -- i'm 15 sorry, after 1971, every cigarette 16 advertisement had a warning label. every one, 17 including the parliament ad. the one 18 parliament ad you heard about carried a surgeon 19 general's warning label, saying that the 20 surgeon general has determined that cigarette 21 smoking is dangerous to your health. 22 the information was known and it was 23 available. 24 let us talk about advertising for a minute, 25 because you some saw evidence about that. what did not you see? well, there was no 2 evidence that advertising caused ms. wilkinson 3 to begin smoking. 4 there was no evidence, there were no facts 5 presented to you that advertising caused 6 ms. wilkinson to begin smoking. 7 as mr. hohnbaum pointed out earlier, no 8 one knows why ms. wilkinson began smoking. but 9 there is certainly no evidence that advertising 10 caused her to start smoking. 11 no witness mentioned that ms. wilkinson 12 saw any reynolds advertisement. we know that 13 cigarette advertising was legal. and you have 14 an instruction in your booklet that says that: 15 the manufacture, sale and advertising of 16 cigarettes is legal. that is an issue that our 17 congress has decided. 18 and we know that all advertising had 19 warnings starting in the early 1970s, years 20 before ms. wilkinson tried to quit. 21 now, let us talk about this one parliament 22 advertisement that mr. wilkinson recalled at 23 the beauty parlor. that was the only evidence 24 you heard about ms. wilkinson seeing an 25 advertisement in this case. and the testimony was that she saw this 2 advertisement sometime in the 1970s, 30 years 3 after she had been warned. she had received 30 4 consecutive years of warnings about the dangers 5 of smoking before there is any evidence that 6 she saw the cigarette advertisement. 7 by the time she saw this advertisement in 8 the 1970s, her brother had been warning her; 9 she had heard about the 1964 surgeon general's 10 report; she knew that smoking was dangerous. 11 and there is no evidence that that 12 advertisement had any impact on her whatsoever. 13 there is no evidence that that advertisement 14 was material in her decision to continue 15 smoking. 16 there is no evidence that ms. wilkinson 17 was going to stop smoking if she had not seen 18 that one parliament advertisement issued by 19 philip morris, who is not a defendant in this 20 case. 21 you heard dr. cummings testify that 22 cigarette advertising was wallpaper. well, 23 dr. cummings was never in ms. wilkinson's home, 24 because we know that wallpaper was not in her 25 house. instead, she was surrounded by warnings. she was surrounded by personalized, 2 direct and candid warnings from her family and 3 friends throughout her entire life. 4 there was discussion about filters and 5 lights, and it was suggested to you that 6 ms. wilkinson smoked filtered cigarettes 7 because she thought they were safer. 8 you will recall that testimony. the only 9 time that testimony was mentioned was during 10 the cross-examination of dr. barnett. 11 at no other time. ms. turner did not tell 12 you that ms. wilkinson smoked filtered 13 cigarettes because she thought they were safer. 14 mr. wilkinson did not tell you that 15 ms. wilkinson -- 16 mr. rosen: your honor, i object. 17 the court: what is the objection? 18 mr. rosen: i was precluded from asking 19 the question. hearsay. 20 the court: sustained. rephrase, counsel. 21 mr. keehfus: certainly. 22 ladies and gentlemen, the only time you 23 heard that evidence was on the 24 cross-examination of dr. barnett. there was no 25 specific evidence on that point. what do we know about the generic filters 2 and lights case that you heard? 3 we know that ms. wilkinson smoked light 4 cigarettes for less than a year in the late 5 1980s. less than a year. 6 and we know that the evidence is that when 7 she did smoke lights, she switched back and 8 forth between lights and regular full-flavored 9 cigarettes. 10 is someone who is switching to light 11 cigarettes because she thinks they are safer 12 then going to go and switch back to 13 full-flavored cigarettes? that does not make 14 any sense. 15 less than a year in the late 1980s, those 16 filtered and light cigarettes carried the exact 17 same warning label as every other cigarette. 18 during this one year in the late 1980s, 19 plaintiff claims that ms. wilkinson was still 20 trying to quit. 21 why is she trying to quit if she thinks 22 that light cigarettes are safer? she did not 23 think that. she was smoking light cigarettes 24 because she liked light cigarettes. and then 25 she went back to her regular brand. the only brand of light cigarettes 2 ms. wilkinson smoked was parliament light, not 3 a product made by rj reynolds. 4 and we know from dr. cummings' 5 cross-examination, the public health community, 6 during ms. wilkinson's life, concluded that 7 filtered and lower tar cigarettes were safer, 8 and they encouraged people to quit smoking or 9 switch to them. that was the message coming 10 from the public health community in the 1970s 11 and the 1980s. 12 plaintiff's generic evidence on filters 13 and lights has nothing to do with this case. 14 ladies and gentlemen, i submit to you, it does 15 not help you answer a single question on your 16 verdict form. 17 this is all of the evidence you heard from 18 dr. cummings, a day and a half of statements, 19 press releases, video clips. not a single 20 shred of evidence that ms. wilkinson saw or was 21 impacted by it at all. 22 remember, in your concealment instruction, 23 she has to have relied on a statement that 24 concealed a material fact, something that would 25 have impacted her, it would have changed her; that she had seen it, she would have changed 2 her behavior. there is simply no evidence of 3 that. 4 we asked ms. turner and mr. wilkinson on 5 the stand -- you may have wondered why, why 6 would we ask about statements by the tobacco 7 research committee or the council for tobacco 8 research. 9 we asked both of them: did your mother 10 ever discuss with you any statements made by 11 any of these entities? and the answer was "no" 12 every single time. 13 that is the evidence that you have in the 14 record before you. that is the evidence that 15 you have to apply to the law that the judge has 16 instructed you on. 17 this is, again, a material fact 18 instruction. this is your guide. this is your 19 instruction book that will help you navigate 20 through the verdict form. 21 and you see there the material fact 22 instruction: would not have acted as she did 23 if not for the statement concealed. 24 they have not proven a statement that she 25 saw or was impacted by; and they have not proven that she would not have acted as she did 2 but for that statement. 3 now, on this issue of material 4 information, what we do know is, we do have 5 evidence of how ms. wilkinson did respond when 6 she was given warnings. we know how she 7 reacted when people warned her about the 8 dangers of smoking. 9 what was the evidence? when ms. sarussi 10 told her you need to quit smoking, it is going 11 to ruin your life, ms. walsh told you she 12 fluffed it off. 13 she did not at that point try and change 14 her behavior. she did not at that point say, 15 you know what, i'm going to try to quit. 16 instead, she fluffed it off. 17 barbara walsh told you it did not matter, 18 it did not matter, she was going to do what she 19 wanted to do. and she did it willingly, 20 willfully and enjoyably. 21 ladies and gentlemen, ms. wilkinson did 22 not develop copd/emphysema because the health 23 effects or addictive nature of cigarettes were 24 unknown or unavailable to her. 25 the evidence is relentless. it is consistent and continuous. ms. wilkinson knew 2 the dangers of smoking. that information was 3 available to her, surrounded her, her entire 4 life. and you cannot conceal something from 5 somebody that they already know. 6 ms. wilkinson knew that cigarettes could 7 kill her. what more did she need to know? 8 those stark warnings she got in the 1940s, 9 cigarettes can kill you, she knew it. 10 was there any evidence in this case, any 11 evidence whatsoever that she needed to know 12 that there was ammonia in cigarettes and that 13 would have been the game-changer for her? 14 there is no evidence of that. 15 was there any evidence in this case that 16 she needed to know that flue-cured tobacco was 17 in cigarettes and, you know, that was going to 18 be the material fact that made her quit 19 smoking? 20 mr. rosen: your honor, i again object to 21 this. 22 the court: sustained. 23 mr. hohnbaum: there is no evidence in 24 this case that ms. wilkinson was waiting on 25 tobacco company -- mr. rosen: objection, your honor. 2 the court: ladies and gentlemen, rely on 3 your own recollection of the evidence. 4 proceed, counsel. 5 mr. keehfus: ms. wilkinson had that 6 information. she had the information about the 7 dangers of smoking. what more did she need to 8 know? there has been a complete failure of 9 proof to you on that. 10 the evidence is overwhelming that 11 ms. wilkinson knew the health effects and 12 addictive nature. you cannot conceal what she 13 already knew. 14 for those reasons, ladies and gentlemen, 15 remember, questions 4 and 5, there is similar 16 analysis for both on the question of 17 concealment, reliance on concealment, and the 18 same question on reliance on agreement to 19 conceal. the same analysis, the same answer. 20 and when you get to those questions, we 21 submit to you that your answer should be "no." 22 okay. question 6. again, i submit to you 23 that you should not get this far, but if you 24 do, i would like to discuss with you the 25 evidence and how it fits into the instructions that you have been given. 2 and this is the question of fault that you 3 assign that was a legal cause of 4 ms. wilkinson's injuries. a legal cause of her 5 injuries. 6 the assignment of fault relates only to 7 those actions that were a legal cause of 8 ms. wilkinson's emphysema and death. the 9 assignment of fault can only be related to the 10 conduct the plaintiff linked up or connected to 11 ms. wilkinson specifically with facts. 12 now, dr. cummings showed you some stuff; 13 some wrong stuff, some bad stuff. but that is 14 not the issue before you. the issue before you 15 is what kind or actions were a legal cause of 16 ms. wilkinson's injuries. 17 stated a different way, reynolds cannot be 18 assigned fault for actions that were not a 19 legal cause of ms. wilkinson's copd/emphysema 20 or death. 21 and the engle findings do not establish 22 that reynolds is at fault for ms. wilkinson's 23 copd or death. it is not a comparison of 24 choices; it is not a comparison of whose 25 choices are worse. the assignment of fault relates only to 2 that specific conduct that you find was a legal 3 cause of ms. wilkinson's injuries. 4 now, it was suggested to you earlier this 5 morning that perhaps ms. wilkinson had as 6 little as ten percent fault. ten percent fault. 7 but the evidence demonstrates that 8 ms. wilkinson was the only cause of her 9 copd/emphysema. ms. wilkinson chose to smoke 10 for decades without making a serious quit 11 attempt. decades. 12 she was not confused about the dangers and 13 addictive nature of smoking. she knew that 14 information her entire life. every smoker has 15 the ability to quit, including ms. wilkinson. 16 and ms. wilkinson had the responsibility 17 to quit smoking if she wanted to do that. 18 the court: five minutes, counsel. 19 mr. keehfus: ms. wilkinson could have 20 quit smoking at a time that prevented her 21 death. 22 as dr. cummings told you, a smoker is 23 fully responsible for making the choice to 24 quit. 25 and, ladies and gentlemen, when you get this question on the verdict form, i submit to 2 you, state the percentage of any fault that was 3 a legal cause, that ms. wilkinson's actions 4 were the only legal cause of her 5 copd/emphysema. 6 you heard plaintiff's claim for damages. 7 plaintiffs asked for $2 million in damages 8 each. you will be instructed that any damages 9 must be just in light of the evidence, and 10 plaintiff has the burden to prove every dollar. 11 plaintiff is not seeking damages for 12 ms. wilkinson's four other children, her pain 13 and suffering, loss of wages, funeral expenses, 14 her support and services. 15 the plaintiff failed to prove that 16 ms. turner and ms. wilkinson are entitled to 17 $4 million because their mother chose to smoke, 18 despite knowing the dangers her entire life. 19 respectfully, ladies and gentlemen, 20 plaintiff's claim for $4 million defies common 21 sense. 22 remember, in reaching your verdict you 23 were instructed, do not let bias or sympathy 24 play a role. 25 finally, on this verdict form, question no. 9, punitive damages. you remember that 2 punitive damages can be awarded only for 3 concealment that was a legal cause of 4 ms. wilkinson's death. 5 you may not punish reynolds for harm 6 suffered by anyone other than ms. wilkinson. 7 it is a very specific inquiry on the conduct 8 that you find to be connected to ms. wilkinson. 10 punitive damages are in addition to 11 damages that fully compensate the plaintiff and 12 mr. eugene wilkinson. and they can be awarded 13 only to vivian turner and eugene wilkinson, not 14 to anyone else, not to any other organizations. 15 punitive damages only go to the plaintiff and 16 mr. wilkinson. 17 and it is clear and convincing evidence. 18 it is the higher burden. it is the highest 19 burden we have in civil trials. 20 plaintiff has to prove to you by clear and 21 convincing evidence that, without hesitation, 22 they have met their burden, their higher 23 burden. 24 and what does that mean? that means when 25 you are deliberating, if there is any hesitation or doubt plaintiff has not met their 2 burden to prove to you entitlement to punitive 3 damages. 4 you may not consider the engle findings in 5 determining whether punitive damages are 6 warranted, and they do not establish that 7 plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages. 8 this is the key point: mitigating 9 evidence. you may consider mitigating evidence 10 in determining punitive damages. 11 what did you hear from dr. cummings? the 12 fda has regulatory control over the tobacco 13 industry since 2009. the federal government 14 has regulatory control over the tobacco 15 industry since 2009. 16 you have seen the warning labels. you have 17 heard from dr. cummings: ctr funded 18 $500 million of research, published scientific 19 and medical articles, 600 articles in the 20 surgeon general's reports, 10 nobel prize 21 winners, funded research at ivy league 22 institutions and universities around florida. 23 should reynolds be punished? the evidence 24 clearly is no. 25 you saw ctr funded this article in 1963 which concluded that cigarette smoking was 2 addictive, sponsored in part by grants of the 3 american cancer society and the tobacco 4 industry research committee. in 1963, they 5 funded that research. 6 you heard about premier and eclipse, 7 reynolds' efforts to develop a safer cigarette. 8 dr. cummings admitted to you there is no 9 such thing as a safer cigarette; but he also 10 told you that reynolds has tried to reduce the 11 level of cancer-causing chemicals in cigarettes 12 since the 1950s. 13 they started this heat-not-burn technology 14 to try to make a safer cigarette. they spent 15 over a billion dollars to develop a less 16 harmful cigarette, but it failed because people 17 did not like the taste. 18 and dr. cummings told you developing a 19 safer cigarette was a responsible thing to do; 20 and he told you that just because premier 21 failed, reynolds did not stop. they tried to do 22 it again later with that cigarette called 23 eclipse. they kept trying. 24 it demonstrates that reynolds should not 25 be punished. you heard about youth smoking. what did 2 dr. cummings admit? youth smoking rates have 3 drastically plummeted. florida has the second 4 lowest youth smoking rate in the country, after 5 utah. 6 today, 93 percent of florida high school 7 students are not smoking, even a single 8 cigarette in a month. that is youth smoking 9 today. in florida, nine out of 10 high school 10 students not smoking even a cigarette in a 11 month. 12 ladies and gentlemen, when you get to the 13 question of compensatory damages, we submit to 14 you the answer should be zero for ms. turner 15 and mr. wilkinson. 16 and when you get to the question for the 17 entitlement to punitive damages, the plaintiff 18 has not met that higher burden of clear and 19 convincing evidence, and your verdict should be 20 "no," if you get that far on the verdict form. 21 ladies and gentlemen to wrap up, this case 22 is about one smoker, ms. wilkinson, who smoked 23 for 50 years, knowing smoking could kill her 24 and ruin her life. 25 i thank you on behalf of our team, on behalf of plaintiffs and everybody, thank you 2 for your time, your attention, being prompt 3 every day. we so appreciate it. the system 4 would not work if it was not for you. 5 when you came to the courthouse, you guys 6 did not choose to be on this case, but you were 7 selected. we thank you for your diligent 8 attention. 9 the only thing we ask of you when you go 10 back into that jury room, take your guide book, 11 your instructions; you apply the legal 12 principles embodied in these instructions; you 13 apply them to the facts presented here; and we 14 ask that you return a complete defense verdict, 15 based on the overwhelming presentation in this 16 case for rj reynolds. thank you very much.
