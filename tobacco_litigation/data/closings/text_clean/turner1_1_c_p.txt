4 mr. rosen: it has been just shy of two 5 weeks since we started this process, just shy 6 of two weeks, and i think we are actually a 7 little bit ahead of schedule. so that is good. 8 i tried to move quickly through witnesses, 9 and i know sometimes things got a little bit 10 slow, but i hope that we presented some 11 interesting, unique issues, you got to learn 12 some science, medicine, and that you got to see 13 some great witnesses in this case. 14 the information that you now have, you 15 know, i really -- thinking about this, you 16 probably have more information about the 17 tobacco industry and smoking and health than 18 probably 99 percent of the us population. i 19 feel confident in that. 20 and that information is powerful. okay? 21 because i think -- i think i said this early on 22 in the case: what you thought you knew about 23 cigarettes and about smokers and about the 24 cigarette industry might be very, very 25 different than what you learned in this courtroom. 2 i want to thank every one of you for your 3 patience and for sacrificing and being here on 4 behalf of vivian and william. we thank you. 5 all right. and so now we are coming to 6 the end of this case, for you to make a 7 decision and to decide the outcome of who wins, 8 who loses, what is right, what is wrong. 9 and so what is going to happen in probably 10 a couple of hours is you are going to go back 11 to that jury room and you are going to get a 12 verdict form. 13 the judge read you these instructions, and 14 you are going to have to review all of those 15 instructions. 16 you are going to have the verdict form. 17 the way i'm going to try to go through it is as 18 succinctly as possible. you are going to have 19 the verdict form. i'm going to run through it 20 right now with you to understand what the 21 issues are and what we are going to be talking 22 about. 23 you heard and saw a lot of evidence. you 24 heard a lot of evidence about the tobacco 25 industry, and you heard and saw a lot of evidence about vivian wilkinson. 2 you heard about the engle class and what 3 we need to prove and whose burden it is to 4 prove who is an engle class member. 5 so we are going to start. hopefully, it 6 works. 7 about class membership: "was vivian 8 wilkinson addicted to cigarettes containing 9 nicotine, and if so, was that addiction a 10 cause, a legal cause of her copd/emphysema? 11 you are going to see in those jury 12 instructions that it is not about fault, it is 13 not about what vivian wilkinson knew or she 14 did not know. 15 this is the question: "was vivian 16 wilkinson addicted to cigarettes containing 17 nicotine, and if so, was such addiction a legal 18 cause of her chronic obstructive pulmonary 19 disease?" 20 if you answer is "no" to this question, 21 the case is over. rj reynolds wins, and we go 22 home. 23 okay. if you answer is "yes," and i'm 24 confident you are going to answer "yes," that 25 vivian wilkinson was addicted to cigarettes and that her addiction was the legal cause of her 2 copd, we are going to go on to the next 3 question. 4 but i want to talk about this first 5 question because you heard and saw a lot of 6 evidence whether addiction, about smoking, not 7 about fault -- it is not about whether addicts 8 can quit or not. you are going to see, you are 9 to read the instruction. it is not about that. 10 nowhere in there does it talk about that, 11 whether the smoker shares any responsibility. 12 that is a question that is later on in the 13 verdict form. and we are going to talk about 14 that later also. 15 it is not about whether she relied on 16 industry statements, what -- whether she relied 17 on what they were talking about. 18 and you are not going to see anything 19 about choice, okay? 20 it is not about whether she chose to smoke 21 or did not choose to smoke. 22 we are going to talk about addiction and 23 the greater weight of the evidence. that is 24 what we have to prove. that is our burden, 25 whether by the greater weight of the evidence, the more persuasive and convincing portion of 2 the evidence, whether she was addicted and 3 whether that addiction caused disease. 4 vivian wilkinson was 13 years old when she 5 started smoking. that is the evidence in this 6 case. she was 13. 7 the time when she started smoking, you 8 know, was around in the 1940s. i'm not going 9 to go through all of the advertisements. we 10 went through a ton of advertisements. i'm not 11 going to make you sit through more 12 advertisements. you saw them all. 13 that was life back then. it was a 14 different world. people smoked everywhere. 15 little kids. this was her older brother. 16 joseph wicks says it was common for girls to 17 smoke. he came back from the war and kids were 18 smoking. all right? 19 it was a different time. they were giving 20 out cigarettes to the soldiers back then. all 21 right? it was part of society. 22 i think the testimony and the evidence was 23 more than fifty percent of people in the united 24 states smoked. and so it was a different 25 world, and she was 13 when she started smoking. and we have the history in her medical 2 records. you saw the over 40 pack-year smoking 3 history, 40-pack-year history of smoking. 4 and her medical records, you know, they 5 want to deny it, but her medical record -- 6 mr. rosen: objection, your honor. 7 the court: overruled. this is argument. 8 proceed. 9 mr. rosen: they want to deny it, but this 10 is what the medical records say, her own 11 doctors that were treating her: history of 12 tobacco abuse. 13 i asked dr. barnett, we are going to talk 14 about her in a minute: was there a history of 15 abuse? 16 she would not agree that abuse is something 17 that people think about in terms of substance 18 abuse or addiction. she would not agree to it. 19 this is in her medical records. 20 there is another document here: history 21 cigarette abuse. it was actually written. 22 this is just some billing code. no, it is in 23 the medical record. it is a handwritten note. 24 and there was another diagnosis of 25 tobacco-use disorder. all right? these are doctors, the people who were 2 responsible for her well-being. this is what 3 they wrote. and that was back in 1998. 4 and so the instruction that you are going 5 to get on legal cause is: was addiction to 6 cigarettes -- the addiction to cigarettes 7 containing nicotine is a legal cause. it 8 does not have to be the only legal cause, but a 9 legal cause if it indirectly and in natural 10 sequence substantially produces so that it 11 reasonably can be said that but for the 12 addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine, 13 the copd would not have occurred. 14 so, but for addiction, but for addiction, 15 would she have smoked for 40 years? forty 16 years, a pack of these a day. 17 if i sat here -- i was thinking about 18 doing it. i'm not going to do it; it is going 19 to take too much time. if i were to take one 20 cigarette at a time, put it in my mouth and 21 smoke it, put it down, and then took another 22 one and light it up and sit here, how long do 23 you think that is going to take? that is one. 24 there is 20 in here. 25 do you think someone is going to do that for 40 years if they were not addicted? 2 and, again, there is no issue on choice. 3 you are not going to see anything regarding 4 choice on the legal cause of addiction causing 5 copd. 6 just remember, it is stipulated, it is that 7 her smoking caused the copd. her smoking 8 caused her copd and her copd caused her death. 9 that is not even an issue. 10 so why did she continue to smoke for 40 11 years? and i also talked about, this is called 12 a concurring-cause instruction: addiction 13 does not have to be the only cause. all right? 14 it could act in combination with other factors. 15 i can go through the -- going to go 16 through this. listen, if you look at the 17 amount of time, the amount of time of her 18 lifetime smoking, it is astonishing. 19 this is one and a half packs. you can go 20 more or less, depending on what you think she 21 smoked. the testimony is on -- is in different 22 ranges. some people say a pack; medical 23 records say a pack; some say a pack and a half 24 to two packs. 25 but look at the actual time. using the substance over a lifetime is 12.5 years. 12.5 2 years of smoking. 3 was she addicted to nicotine in 4 cigarettes? start at 13. you heard the 5 testimony. she smoked first thing in the 6 morning. the pack a day, she would smoke 7 around her kids. she would smoke before going 8 to sleep. she would wake up in the middle of 9 the night. she would smoke in the car filling 10 up gas. you heard all of the testimony about 11 what this lady did, what vivian wilkinson did. 12 okay? 13 and so, was it just because she loved the 14 way smoke -- the taste of smoke? did she -- 15 did she love that so much, she just loved the 16 feel of a cigarette in her hand? no. it is 17 the nicotine. and we are going to talk about 18 that in a minute. 19 you learned so much about it, all right? 20 and i suspect the things you did not know 21 before, and i suspect you learned about the 22 things that they concealed and hidden what they 23 were doing with nicotine. 24 and we talked about her quit attempts. i 25 mean, listen, i think william said on the stand, he says 50 times he remembers, and 2 vivian was talking how many times, dozens. 3 there is no dispute she tried to quit many 4 times from the late '70s going forward, you 5 know? and she was not successful. she was 6 never successful. 7 she smoked all the time. she would cry, 8 her brother would talk to her, her brother 9 joseph wicks, a 91-year-old guy, we have a 10 video of him, he would talk to the sister: i 11 beg you, you have got to quit. and she would 12 break down crying. what would she say to him? 13 i'm trying, i'm trying to quit. 14 did she want to smoke or did she want to 15 stop smoking? 16 and then, you know, again, dr. barnett 17 just denied any of these withdrawal symptoms. 18 you heard the testimony about how she would 19 become anxious. she would get irritable, 20 become a different person. wake up william in 21 the morning, she would be a different person. 22 you knew that is when she was quitting. that 23 was one of the days. 24 what happened? it would only last a day 25 or two, and she would go back, because there is an incredible driving force behind what is in 2 this pack and in this cigarette. 3 this is not just tobacco rolled up in a 4 piece of paper; this is sophisticated, highly 5 designed, highly engineered. 6 there is a reason 500,000 people die every 7 year from smoking. twenty million died since 8 the 1960s. it is not because people just all 9 want to walk off a cliff. there is a driving 10 force. and they know it. and they have known 11 it for years. they are in the business of 12 selling nicotine. 13 that was -- that goes back to '63: this 14 dominant specification should be nicotine 15 delivery. it is a potent drug. the industry 16 is based upon the design and sale of attractive 17 dosage forms. 18 this is a dosage form of nicotine. this 19 is a dosage form of nicotine. i thought this 20 was just a cigarette. 21 and it is an essential commodity in a 22 habitual act. they talked about it in records. 23 they compared smokers to rats. they are going 24 to keep going back and hitting that lever 25 because they need it. you know, they admit that she smoked 2 enough to get copd, but not enough to be 3 addicted? 4 she smoked enough to get a deadly chronic 5 illness, but not to be addicted? 6 and so you think about that. 7 dr. barnett, they brought an expert for 8 you to -- a psychiatrist. i had the chance to 9 cross-examine her. you heard about who she is. 10 before she was contacted by the tobacco 11 lawyers, she never did any type of research on 12 nicotine addiction. it was never published. 13 she was not any type of authority in the field 14 of tobacco use or abuse. i mean, she is a 15 psychiatrist. that is fine, okay? 16 and, really, i mean, i understand she is a 17 medical director for this public corporation, 18 where she is creating a sleep apnea program. 19 maybe that is her thing, but addiction to 20 nicotine, that is not her thing. that is not 21 her thing. 22 she advertised her services, and now the 23 industry hires her. how many cases has she 24 been hired to talk about -- in every single 25 case she is testified, none of the smokers are addicted. 2 there was a person, she had a guy, 35 3 pack-a-day smoker, not addicted, right? 4 and so you will have the opportunity to 5 weigh her credibility, and you can reject her 6 testimony. that is what the instruction said, 7 okay? and i suspect you will. 8 what did she say about the surgeon general 9 of the united states? "i do not find him to be 10 authoritative." 11 the surgeon general, who is been writing 12 about this since 1964, who publishes every 13 year, we have the book, i was asking dr. farber 14 questions about it yesterday, but, i mean, the 15 surgeon general is not an authority on smoking 16 and health? 17 and then what was -- this -- you know, 18 this shows where she comes from: that 19 someone -- this was a question that was asked 20 by defense counsel: someone who continues to 21 smoke, is addiction a factor? no. 22 how is addiction not a factor in someone's 23 continued use of an addictive substance? 24 it makes no sense. no sense at all. 25 this was the testimony, this was the evidence on addiction, is that every single 2 person, from vivian, to her doctors, to her 3 medical records, all say she is addicted. who 4 is the only person? dr. barnett. no, she is 5 not addicted; she was not addicted. 6 and so you will have to -- you will make 7 this decision. 8 i mean, this is what they say internally: 9 without the chemical compound, the cigarette 10 market would collapse, we would lose our jobs 11 and consulting fees. 12 these are internal documents that were not 13 available, and you learned about these 14 documents. and that is going to be important: 15 about the timing, when this stuff came to 16 light. 17 this stuff did not come to light until the 18 1990s, right? and that is going to be something 19 that you are going to decide. they are going to 20 argue that she should have known, she should 21 have known she had a disease caused by smoking, 22 when all of this information, what they knew, 23 did not come out until the 1990s. but she 24 should have known about it before 1990. we are 25 going to get to that. this was another important document. and 2 all of these are in evidence. you can look 3 through them. examine them, read them. they 4 are very interesting. 5 and this is a window into the soul of rj 6 reynolds and these other companies: we cannot 7 ever be comfortable selling a product which 8 most of our customers would stop using if they 9 could. 10 they know their customers cannot stop. and 11 the exit gate suddenly opened. if people are 12 going to stop smoking, they are going to be out 13 of business overnight. 14 what do they have to do? they have to 15 make the cigarette more addictive so people 16 keep smoking. 17 was vivian wilkinson addicted to 18 cigarettes containing nicotine? the answer is 19 "yes." for no. 1, the answer is "yes," okay? 20 and you are going to have the verdict form 21 back there. i do not know if i have a copy of 22 it. that is all right. 23 and so when she is a class member, that is 24 the class membership question. is she a class 25 member? you apply these findings. the findings 2 apply in this case, okay? 3 reynolds concealed material -- omitted 4 material information that was not otherwise 5 known or available. 6 that is what they did. those findings are 7 binding. if they did not -- and that is going to 8 apply in this case. 9 what else? reynolds agreed with other 10 companies to conceal or omit information 11 regarding the health effects of cigarettes or 12 their addictive nature, and they did it with 13 the intention that the public would rely on it. 14 okay? they did it intending for the public to 15 rely on it. those are two that are so 16 important. 17 then no. 3: they placed these cigarettes 18 in the market that are defective, cigarettes 19 that have ammonia compounds, okay, that change 20 the form of nicotine, so that it absorbs 21 faster, gets to the brain. that is effective. 22 that is the problem. 23 and then smoking cigarettes causes 24 disease, including copd. remember something, 25 okay? remember, before these findings, before these -- the jury found these findings, they 2 denied all of this. they denied all of it. 3 and we saw the video. we are going to 4 show you a couple in a little bit. they said 5 historically, right up until 2000, cigarette 6 smoking does not cause disease; our products 7 are not injurious to human health. if there is 8 an issue with them, we will remove it. 9 they lied to everybody, to their 10 customers, to the -- to everybody. 11 and you know why they lied? they lied for 12 money. and i'm going to get into that a little 13 bit more when we talk about punitive damages. 14 but this was a corporation that lied, 15 concealed, denied, deceived, with the purpose 16 and motive and intent, okay? and the reason -- 17 the motivation was money. a lot of money. 18 the next question is going to be the 19 statute of limitations defense, and the judge 20 is going to give you -- has given you some 21 instructions on whether she knew or should have 22 known before may 5th, 1990, that by the 23 exercise of reasonable care, she should have 24 known before may 5th, 1990, that she had copd, 25 and that there was a reasonable possibility that it was caused by cigarette smoking. 2 vivian turner's testimony. this is her 3 daughter. this is the person who lived with 4 her, who saw her. she was at -- vivian 5 wilkinson was at her daughter's wedding. and 6 we showed you a picture of her smoking at the 7 wedding. 8 the question is: before 1992, did you see 9 her use an inhaler? 10 never. 11 before 1992, at your wedding, did you see 12 her having shortness of breath? 13 never. 14 did you ever see her wheezing before 1992? 15 no. 16 coughing of sputum? 17 no. 18 hacking cough? 19 no. 20 nothing before 1992. i mean, that is 21 critical. 22 before 1992, did you see her having a 23 smoking cough? 24 no. 25 tell us about your mom at the wedding, all right? 2 and she talked about her mom. she was 3 walking around. she was dancing. she was 4 having a good time, okay? 5 in 1992, if she had this severe emphysema 6 that dr. farber talked about yesterday, she had 7 a severe emphysema by 1993, she could not do 8 anything. there is no way she is walking around 9 like this, having a good time, dancing at the 10 wedding. there is no way. it does not happen. 11 and you have photos of her. you heard 12 about the colorado trip even after she was 13 diagnosed. this lady went to colorado and was 14 able to spend time and run around and do things 15 with the kids and the family. 16 william wilkinson. and you heard this 17 gentleman spent a lot of time with his mom at 18 the beauty parlor. poor guy. at the beauty 19 parlor, okay? 20 he joined the military in 1987, rose to 21 the ranks of the top 1 percent of the united 22 states military, retired chief master sergeant, 23 okay? it is the highest ranking for an 24 enlisted personnel. it is comparable to a 25 general, okay? this man has led squadrons, all right? 2 before you joined the military -- and this 3 is testimony under oath, 1987: before you 4 joined the military in 1978, did you see your 5 mom using an inhaler? 6 no, sir. 7 before you joined the military, any 8 shortness of breath? 9 no. 10 before you joined the military in 1987, 11 had you observed any health problems? 12 no, sir. 13 and between 1989 and 1991 when you visited 14 your mother, how as her health? 15 it was excellent. she was in great 16 physical condition. 17 this is absolutely consistent with the 18 medical records that we have in this case, all 19 of the documentation. 20 did there come a time in the early 1990s 21 where you learned your mom was diagnosed? 22 yes, sir. 23 what year? 24 '93. 25 he remembered exactly where she was, and before that time, at the very bottom of this, 2 he talks about how no observations of his mom 3 having shortness of breath, breathing problems 4 or using inhalers. 5 1993. that is when she was diagnosed. 6 and we have the medical record, and you 7 are going to see it in evidence, right? it 8 states right there. this is april 20th, 1993. 9 she has a 40-year smoking history, who has 10 noted progressive shortness of breath over the 11 period of the last six months. much worse in 12 the past three days. 13 all right. that is 1993, when she was 14 diagnosed with copd. 15 and the defense is arguing that she should 16 have known back in the 1980s that she had copd. 17 she should have known about it. 18 and what was her report to the nurse? you 19 know, how long did you have these symptoms that 20 you could not breathe? it was last wednesday. 21 that is what she reported. 22 dr. barry reed. i asked him questions. 23 based upon your review of the records, was 24 there any notation or any symptoms or anything 25 relating to copd before april of 1993? no. 2 was there any evidence of symptoms 3 associated with vivian wilkinson's copd prior 4 to may 5th, 1990? 5 no. 6 now, the testimony is that if you have a 7 certain level of copd -- because it is a slowly 8 progressing disease. it takes time to develop, 9 okay? if she has either moderate or severe 10 copd in 1993, she is probably going to have some 11 level of it before 1990, okay? she is probably 12 going to have -- it does not mean she should 13 have known about it. it does not mean she 14 should have found out about it. 15 the records here show she went in 1993 to 16 the doctor. there is more records that suggest 17 she was actually seen by other doctors before 18 that, and she never reported being diagnosed 19 with copd. 20 do any of the records indicate before 21 may 5th that she was having symptoms? 22 no. 23 again, this is her doctor. this is not an 24 expert from indiana, flying down here to 25 testify in court. this is a doctor that has his office in miami, who still sees patients 2 down here, who takes care of his pulmonary 3 patients on a daily basis, and who is the 4 person who was there on the front lines taking 5 care of vivian, trying to keep her alive, 6 trying to keep her from suffocating to death. 7 this is what he has to say about the 8 information with respect to whether or not she 9 had copd before 1990, whether she had symptoms 10 associated with it. 11 and i asked him, because this was 12 important, because everyone is saying that she 13 had this certain level of copd in 1990, in 14 1993. 15 and this is dr. gidel. this was the 16 doctor that diagnosed her. if you look at the 17 record, he does not write "severe copd." he 18 says: copd, decompensating chronic obstructive 19 pulmonary disease. 20 and he testified that when you are having 21 an acute exacerbation, meaning you have to go 22 to -- you are going because you have an acute 23 bronchitis, which the medical records show she 24 had, okay, when you go in, in that condition, 25 and you give a pulmonary function test, it is going to be different. 2 and dr. farber yesterday agreed with that. 3 he agreed you are not supposed to give someone 4 a pulmonary function test if they are having 5 exacerbation, because it shows abnormal or more 6 abnormal results than a normal test would show. 7 is it hard to tell how severe her copd was 8 just based on the pulmonary function test 9 because she was suffering from an exacerbation 10 during that time? 11 yes. 12 that is the doctor who was taking care of 13 her back then. 14 and dr. farber, their expert, admitted he 15 would not order a pft if the person was not at 16 baseline. 17 she was not at baseline. she was two days 18 there into a five-day stay at the hospital. 19 and the records say that they actually had her 20 do it at bedside because she could not get up. 21 she was not well enough. she was so ill at the 22 time she could not get up and go give the 23 pulmonary function test. 24 what else? dr. farber, every case he is 25 hired, never found someone to be a member of the engle class. it is impossible for people to 2 become a member of the engle class, right? i 3 mean, she is diagnosed in 1993. 4 he agreed that the definitive test of copd 5 is a pulmonary function test. a pulmonary 6 function test is what diagnoses copd. 7 she never had one before 1993. there is 8 no evidence that she ever had one before 1993. 9 and even if she had shortness of breath, it is 10 not always associated with copd. 11 a person can have fifty percent of their 12 lungs operating, fifty percent of lung function 13 and not have symptoms. 14 and he agreed he is not seen a person with 15 severe copd work full-time on their feet. 16 the testimony is you have social security 17 earnings records. vivian wilkinson was on her 18 feet bartending all throughout this time. she 19 gets sick in 1993; she is back on her feet and 20 back working. 21 and this talk about -- he agreed this was 22 an article that he said was authoritative that 23 he cited. it is normal for people to show up 24 late in the disease of copd. it is normal, 25 right? and so, you know, listen, in hindsight, 2 can anyone go to a doctor earlier? or hope 3 that maybe if they go to the doctor, the doctor 4 is going to get the right diagnosis? 5 this says with chronic obstructive 6 pulmonary disease, people seek it late. 7 and my question to him: is it normal, not 8 unreasonable, is it normal for people to go 9 late to the doctor late in the disease of copd? 10 then he also agreed to the fact that 11 people even with copd, when they start to 12 develop either shortness of breath or 13 something, they modify what they are doing, 14 right? 15 they probably do it subconsciously. they 16 start to shift things around a little bit so 17 they are not feeling like they were. it is not 18 unreasonable for someone to go late when they 19 get diagnosed. 20 what is their burden of proof? we talked 21 about our burden of proof. we talked about our 22 burden of proof. 23 on the statute of limitations, they need 24 to prove it to you. that is their burden. all 25 right? that she knew or should have known by the use of exercising reasonable care that she 2 had copd and it was caused by smoking. that is 3 their burden. 4 and this is the burden of proof on that 5 issue. on that issue. right? 6 every witness, every medical record, no 7 symptoms prior to 1990, except who? barbara 8 walsh, okay? barbara walsh. 9 and what did she say regarding symptoms? 10 11 "question: you said before that you 12 did not observe her wheezing, right? 13 "answer: no, i do not recall her wheezing 14 from it." 15 "question: you do not remember her having 16 a chronic cough, a hacking cough? you do not -- 17 "answer: no. 18 "question: -- remember her ever having a 19 chronic cough? 20 "answer: no. 21 "question: you do not remember her 22 coughing up sputum? 23 "answer: no. lord, no." 24 (the video clip ended.) 25 mr. rosen: and she is asked about these inhalers. she is asked about inhalers, and 2 counsel got to ask this question. he asked 3 her: did you -- did you associate vivian 4 wilkinson's shortness of breath with smoking? 5 and what was her answer? 6 no. 7 there was no association, because back 8 then they did not talk about it. it was not an 9 issue. 10 and you want to know why it was not an 11 issue? i'm not going to play this, but she 12 talked -- she had conflicting testimony about 13 how often she actually saw vivian wilkinson. 14 in one sentence she says: well, i would 15 see her two or three times a week. 16 you know, let us just play it. 17 18 "question: were there times in the 1980s 19 where you would not see her for weeks or even 20 months? 21 "answer: yeah. it would depend on my 22 work schedule." 23 (the video clip ended.) 24 mr. rosen: so she did not see her all the 25 time. it was not every week. that is the testimony from william also, is that when he 2 would go, she was not always there. 3 what else was going on? i mean, the 4 argument, the argument is that she knew or she 5 should have known that she had copd and that it 6 was caused by cigarette smoking. 7 they want to hold -- the defense wants to 8 hold vivian wilkinson to a higher standard than 9 their own ceos and executives. 10 i mean, you remember the open debate 11 campaign. let us see what the ceo of rj 12 reynolds tobacco company was saying in the 13 1980s about whether smoking caused emphysema. 14 that is what they say she should have known: it 15 was caused by smoking. 16 17 >>: cigarette smoking does not cause 18 cancer, yes or no? 19 >>: it is not known whether cigarettes 20 cause cancer. it has not been causally 21 established. 22 >>: cigarette smoking, no causal 23 relationship between cigarette smoking and 24 emphysema? 25 >>: despite all of the research to date, there has been no causal link established. 2 >>: no causal relationship between 3 cigarette smoking and heart disease? 4 >>: no. as a matter of fact, there are 5 studies that while we are accused of being 6 associated with heart disease, there have been 7 studies conducted over 10 years that would say, 8 again, that science is still puzzled over these 9 forces. 10 (the video clip ended.) 11 mr. rosen: that is the ceo of r.j. 12 reynolds, this company, the company that 13 counsel represents, all right? the defendant 14 in this courtroom. 15 the ceo in the 1980s is saying that 16 cigarettes do not cause emphysema. that is the 17 manufacturer of this product that vivian 18 wilkinson is smoking. 19 she had a right to believe them, okay? 20 and they cannot come in 30 years later and say 21 that she should have known, she should have 22 known we were lying about that and concealing 23 information about that. she should have known 24 it. she was much smarter than we were. 25 i mean, they spent -- and i'm going to talk about this. the resources and the amount 2 of money and effort that they put behind this 3 machine was tremendous. all right? 4 they talk about, can we have an open 5 debate campaign? that was part of the huge 6 campaign in the 1980s, where they are talking, 7 there is other evidence. some people are saying 8 it is harmful. here, there is other evidence. 9 you are ignoring the significant evidence to the 10 contrary. our product is not harmful. 11 where were we? back then, we were coming 12 to the peak of smoking, all right? we are at 13 the peak. 14 this is the same gentleman that i just 15 played the video of, all right? this is the 16 same gentleman under oath, in 1994, a year 17 after vivian wilkinson was diagnosed with copd. 18 all right? 19 now he is the former ceo of rj reynolds in 20 1994. 21 does cigarette smoking cause cancer? 22 not in my opinion. 23 what is that opinion based on? 24 the fact that there continues to be 25 statistics that underlie the issue or problem. there is still no scientific link that there is a 2 direct cause-and-effect relationship. 3 does cigarette smoking cause any diseases? 4 not in my opinion. 5 fundamentally, he believes that. all 6 right? 7 they cannot hold vivian wilkinson to a 8 higher standard. they cannot do that. they 9 cannot say she was negligent for not going to a 10 doctor, when they lied and deceived and told 11 the public that their product did not cause 12 harm. 13 this is the actual ceo in 1994. all 14 right? they lined up. and this is in 15 deposition he testifies: 16 is it your position that it has never been 17 proven that cigarette smoking has caused a 18 single person to die? 19 that is my position, yes. 20 that is the head of the head, the top 21 person at rj reynolds tobacco company. 22 so on the statute of limitations defense, 23 on whether she knew or should have known, look 24 at the medical records, the ideas -- look at 25 what is the more persuasive and convincing force and effect of the entire evidence. the 2 entire evidence in this case. and the answer 3 to this is no. 4 if you answer "yes" to this question, 5 plaintiff loses. we go home. the case is 6 over. rj reynolds wins, okay? 7 if the answer to this question is "no," 8 she did not know before, and she should not have 9 reasonably, through the exercise of reasonable 10 care, have known. 11 was smoking cigarettes manufactured by rj 12 reynolds a legal cause of vivian wilkinson's 13 copd and emphysema? 14 i do not think this should be an argument. 15 it is admitted, it is stipulated that smoking 16 caused her disease, all right? 17 smoking, even their own expert talks 18 about -- this is a stipulation: smoking 19 cigarettes was the cause of her emphysema and 20 copd. she died from copd and emphysema, right? 21 we have the testimony from vivian turner, 22 her daughter, talking about the earliest memory 23 is lucky strike. that is rj reynolds. 24 there was winstons all through the '60s, 25 into the '70s, right? it was rj reynolds brand cigarettes. it was winston and viceroy. there 2 was parliament, which is not an rj reynolds 3 brand cigarettes. 4 and that happened -- oh, and also, even 5 after she switched, even after she switched to 6 other -- to parliament, she still saw her mom 7 would smoke pall mall, barclay, and i believe 8 true. pall mall, barclay, those are both rj 9 reynolds brand cigarettes. 10 so even after she switched to parliament, 11 occasionally she would be smoking still rj 12 reynolds' cigarettes. 13 this talks about, again, through her high 14 school years and when did you make the switch. 15 yes, it was after i graduated high school 16 or around there. 17 all right? and then who testified with 18 the -- with the memory, all right? of spending 19 quality time with his mother, all right? at 20 the beauty parlor, right? what does he say? 21 when did your mother switch from smoking 22 the winston, the viceroy to smoking parliament? 23 it would have been after 1978, when we 24 started going to the beauty parlor, and he had 25 a distinct memory. i asked him, do you have a distinct memory of that? 2 yes. 3 so we have a smoking history of rj 4 reynolds brand cigarettes; we have actual 5 evidence, people talking about it, right from 6 the '60s into the late '70s, all right? 7 now, let us talk about -- because they want 8 you to think that vivian turner -- excuse me 9 vivian wilkinson -- 10 mr. rosen: objection, your honor. as to 11 what we want. 12 the court: sustained. 13 mr. rosen: i mean, the evidence here is 14 not that vivian wilkinson all of a sudden 15 started smoking lucky strike the first time 16 that vivian turner remembered seeing her mom. 17 vivian turner stuck with cigarettes for a 18 very long time. she stuck with parliaments for 19 a very long time, winstons, viceroy. it is not 20 that all of a sudden she popped up smoking 21 viceroy -- excuse me -- popped up smoking lucky 22 strike. 23 lucky strikes were huge. rj reynolds' 24 market share was huge, and i'm going to show 25 you that, but what does joe wicks remember about cigarettes when he was growing up, back 2 when they were kids? 3 he remembers lucky strike advertising: 4 smoke, i seen them come out of the 5 airplane, lucky strike in the sky. 6 you remember as a boy seeing a plane 7 flying over? 8 they would have planes flying over, okay? 9 with smoke that says "lucky strike." 10 and this gentleman, 91 years old, 11 remembered that from back in the '40s or '30s, 12 whenever he remembered it. 13 and what other brand does joe wicks 14 remember with respect to rj reynolds? 15 go ahead. 16 17 "question: what brand of cigarettes did 18 you see your sister smoke? 19 "answer: i do not know that. i thought it 20 was winston. 21 "question: you said you do not know, but 22 you thought it was winston. why did you think 23 it was winston? 24 "answer: because i remember seeing the 25 packs lay around, the winston cigarette packs. "question: where did you see the packs? 2 "answer: in her house. 3 "question: when did you see the packs? 4 "answer: god, what year, i do not know. 5 because her husband smoked. you know, they all 6 smoked. 7 "question: did you ever see vivian take a 8 cigarette out of the packs of cigarettes and 9 smoke it? 10 "answer: yeah, i seen her take it out of 11 the packs. 12 (the video clip ended.) 13 mr. rosen: he remembers winston. he 14 remembers lucky strike as being the heavily 15 advertised cigarette. 16 and then we have the documents. these are 17 in evidence. the big three. 18 okay. what cigarette do you think she was 19 smoking before -- before vivian turner can 20 testify about what her memory is? what do you 21 think she was smoking? 22 this is -- rj reynolds has 70 -- over 23 seventy percent of the market, seventy percent of the 24 market, and the other part of the market share 25 was chesterfield. and no one said anything about her smoking chesterfield. they do 2 remember her smoking lucky strikes. 3 this was her doctor. i asked him just a 4 question: 5 just assuming, let us just assume that she 6 just smoked rj reynolds brands for a 10-year 7 period, from '65 to '75. is that a substantial 8 contributing caution of copd in 1993? 9 "answer: yes, they substantially 10 contributed." 11 everyone agrees, you cannot just pull it 12 out. you cannot say smoking those brands did not 13 contribute substantially to producing the 14 disease. 15 this was their expert: 16 do you agree that the total smoking 17 history, every year of it, contributes to the 18 development of copd? 19 yes. 20 and you agree that a person's history of 21 smoking which contributes is cumulative? 22 yes. 23 then i asked him: 24 and you agree if someone smokes one brand 25 from '46 to '65 and then switches and smokes another brand for the next 10 years? 2 what was his answer? 3 "each cigarette contributes to copd, 4 whatever brand. 5 "was smoking cigarettes manufactured by rj 6 reynolds a legal cause of her copd/emphysema? 7 "yes." 8 okay? the answer is "yes." 9 now i want to talk about punitive damages, 10 the path to punitive damages. all right? 11 there is going to be two questions on the 12 verdict form, and it has to do with reliance. 13 it has to do with whether or not vivian 14 wilkinson relied on their lies and whether she 15 relied on their conspiracy to lie. 16 and this is the first question: did 17 vivian wilkinson reasonably rely to her 18 detriment on any statements of material fact 19 made by the defendants? 20 we know, we know with the findings we 21 have, the engle findings, they did it. they 22 concealed material information. they failed to 23 disclose material facts. 24 the question is whether she relied on 25 their fraud, all right? and then the next question on this topic, on this issue, first 2 let us talk about fraud, what they concealed. 3 all right? 4 and dr. cummings talked about this, about 5 the modern cigarette, about the flue-curing, 6 about sugars, making it more inhalable. 7 it was not inhalable. the disease of lung 8 cancer did not exist before 1900. that is an 9 epidemic that was created and sustained by this 10 company. all right? by the tobacco companies. 11 it did not exist, and we have the chart 12 here, and you have seen the chart. 13 but, i mean, this is lung cancer. it 14 does not exist before 1900. okay? and it was 15 with the advent, the invention of the camel 16 cigarette, the modern cigarette. 17 additives: they would put additives to 18 adjust the ph, to maintain certain levels of 19 nicotine. 20 bronchodilator. bronchodilators. their 21 expert, farber, talked about what a 22 bronchodilator is. it relaxes the lungs, 23 right? it makes -- you are able to breathe 24 easier. 25 they put bronchodilators in cigarettes. the amount of carcinogens and deadly chemicals 2 that are in this cigarette, that they know 3 about, that they have always known about, right? 4 they put bronchodilators so people can inhale 5 them easier into their lungs. 6 did vivian wilkinson know that? did she 7 know that they were adjusting the ph and 8 manipulating the levels of nicotine, putting 9 flavors in it to make it easier to smoke? leaf 10 blending to manipulate nicotine? filter vents? 11 she switched to filters. she switched to 12 filters. she believed they were safer. she 13 switched to light cigarettes. she tried those 14 because she thought they were safer. 15 ammoniation. they put ammonia in 16 cigarettes. ammonia, like the stuff under your 17 sink, in a cigarette because it freebases 18 nicotine. it changes the form of the nicotine 19 so that it gets into the system faster, and it 20 has a higher impact and addiction potential. 21 reynolds is legally responsible for the 22 conduct and the statements made by the other 23 companies and the tobacco institute and ctr. 24 that is the law of this case, right? 25 there was a conspiracy, and whenever everyone gets together for a conspiracy, the 2 other people making statements, right, you are 3 all together in it, and they are bound by that. 4 and so what did the industry conceal? we 5 went through a ton of evidence, and i tried to 6 keep it interesting, and dr. cummings was here, 7 and we talked about all of the documents. 8 they formed a conspiracy. right? they 9 formed a conspiracy to conceal the health 10 effects. they met at that plaza hotel. we 11 have the documents. you saw the documents. 12 they hired doctors and scientists to mislead 13 the public. they misled the surgeon general. 14 they knew how highly addictive nicotine 15 was, and they concealed and lied about it. 16 they publicly stated it was not addictive. 17 they studied teenagers, the base of their 18 market. they knew that teenagers, kids, 19 children were the base of their market, and if 20 they could not get these kids, if they could not 21 target these kids, their business would fall 22 apart; they would go out of business. right? 23 they talked about how the rise and decline of 24 every industry deals with the youth market. 25 i mean, fifty percent of all smokers die. right? they knew how many people it was 2 killing, and they lied about it. 3 we just talked about this, but as far as 4 what they knew about manipulating the levels of 5 nicotine, about the chemicals in their 6 cigarettes; that the filters were not working; 7 that they were an illusion; that everyone is 8 buying and smoking filters; they think they are 9 better, they think they are safer, it does not 10 work, it is a joke. 11 and this was the goal: how to free 12 millions of americans from the guilty fear that 13 is going to arise deep in the biological depths 14 every time they light a cigarette. 15 that is what they did. all right? they 16 embarked on a multibillion dollar campaign, 17 with more power, more resources, right, and 18 more drive, right? to convince and to confuse 19 and create doubt, so that people keep smoking. 20 and it worked. 21 and along the way, 20 million people died. 22 vivian wilkinson was one of those people. 23 they boasted about it. this was in the 24 1950s. internal documents we did not have 25 before. their scientists are saying: fortunate 2 for us, cigarettes are a habit they cannot 3 break. boy, would not it be wonderful if our 4 company was the first to produce a cancer-free 5 cigarette? 6 they made public statements about whether 7 or not -- the industry got together, and they 8 made a public statement to reassure the public 9 we are going to look into it; we are going to 10 help society. 11 they lied about it. they state they 12 believe their products are not injurious. they 13 are going to cooperate closely with the public. 14 did they cooperate closely with the 15 public? ask yourself that. when you are 16 answering the question of, was there reliance 17 by vivian wilkinson, ask if they cooperated 18 with public health, or did they lie to them or 19 they deceive them, whether they attacked the 20 surgeon general and other public health 21 authorities. 22 and they knew, they knew -- we have these 23 documents, you know -- they knew how deadly and 24 how devastating this product was that they are 25 selling to billions of people, okay? they knew how deadly it was, and they 2 just kept it quiet and kept selling and 3 selling, and people kept buying and people kept 4 dying. 5 1958: the individuals we met with believe 6 that smoking causes lung cancer. 7 1961: carcinogens are found in every 8 class of compound of smoke. 9 this is an rj reynolds document, 1962: 10 the amount of evidence accumulated to indict 11 cigarettes is overwhelming. the evidence 12 challenge is scant. 13 b&w document. this is an rj reynolds 14 document, 1963: cigarettes have certain 15 unattractive side effects. unattractive side 16 effects. they cause lung cancer. 17 human suffering. human suffering. and 18 you are going to hear about human suffering, and 19 i'm required to talk to you about it. 20 and if they did not form this conspiracy, 21 and they did not put together this tobacco 22 industry research committee, this fake 23 scientific organization, right, they would be 24 in a deplorable position. 25 they knew about it. it was a defensive operation. it was not to help anyone. they 2 wanted to provide psychological crutches to 3 smokers. obviously, the key word is 4 "confusion." doubt is our product. 5 the most important story is that which 6 casts doubt on the cause-and-effect theory of 7 disease and smoking. 8 i mean, is that responsible? is that what 9 a responsible corporation would do? 10 that is -- you know, punitive damages, 11 that is premeditated. that is deliberate. 12 that is intentional. right? that is first 13 degree. okay? 14 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor, 15 motion. 16 the court: sustained. 17 mr. rosen: this is what they said. 18 19 >>: we want to be the detective just as 20 much as the surgeon general and the ama. we 21 will cooperate in every way. 22 well, obviously, a filter takes out 23 certain tar and nicotine. i do not think the 24 industry admits there are any bad elements. 25 if there are bad elements, through our laboratory, through the surgeon general, 2 through the ama, through acts of god and luck, 3 we hope we may find them. if they are found, 4 they will be removed. 5 >>: we do talk to the question of whether 6 or not cigarettes are hazardous. we do not 7 believe that cigarettes are hazardous. we 8 do not accept that because when, as and if any 9 ingredient in cigarette smoke is identified as 10 being injurious to human health, we are 11 confident that we can eliminate that 12 ingredient. 13 (the video clip ended.) 14 mr. rosen: it was the same line over and 15 over and over and over again. and they wanted 16 people to rely on it. that was the industry. 17 the industry wanted people to rely on it. 18 and you know what? people relied on it. 19 vivian wilkinson relied on it. 20 go ahead. 21 (thereupon, a video clip played as 22 follows:) 23 "question: they wanted people to be able 24 to believe them and rely upon them, did they 25 not? "answer: i believe in general, yes. 2 "question: as late as '88, '89 or '90, 3 the tobacco institute was saying they did not 4 know whether smoking caused cancer, correct? 5 that is what they were telling the public, 6 correct? 7 "answer: they did not know. they could 8 not make that determination, is what they said 9 on the video. 10 "question: and they wanted the people to 11 believe them, correct? 12 "answer: i would say they would, yes." 13 (the video clip ended.) 14 mr. rosen: they wanted people to rely on 15 it. it worked. it was effective. 16 and this is -- this is their -- this is 17 right -- the strategy was brilliantly conceived 18 and executed over years, right? they talked 19 about it in their documents, how the strategy 20 was brilliantly conceived and worked. 21 and this was the most -- when i read this, 22 you know, when i read this, a holding strategy, 23 right? think about a holding strategy. the 24 holding strategy is people are smoking and 25 dying so that they can make more money. all right? a lot of money. $250 billion was just 2 their marketing expenses over these years. a 3 holding strategy. 4 i mean, the families and the people that 5 suffered from this. all right? vivian turner 6 watched her mom suffocate to death. 7 important battles for them? this was 8 important for human life. right? for just 9 normal, everyday people, who did not know what 10 they knew. 11 that the tirc was a shield and enacted as 12 a front. the tobacco money: the ctr was the 13 best and cheapest insurance that money could 14 buy, that the industry could buy. let us pay 15 these fake organizations that we created. it is 16 the best insurance we have got. 17 because if they keep lying, they are going 18 to keep spreading doubt, and people are going 19 to keep smoking. 20 again, they talk in the documents, who 21 ain't for more money? right? they did not want 22 to be regulated. do we really want to tout 23 cigarette smoke as a drug? it is, of course, 24 but there are dangerous fda implications. 25 i mean, this talks about they -- they are dealing -- they are dealing with 2 representatives, right? they have contacts 3 with senators and representatives. 4 they influence society from the highest, 5 highest level. 6 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor. 7 motion in limine instruction. 8 the court: sustained. move on, counsel. 9 mr. rosen: they influenced doctors. they 10 influenced scientists. right? they influenced 11 the public. they influenced consumers. 12 and they knew filters -- the carcinogens 13 are found -- this is what they told the surgeon 14 general, right? this is an internal document 15 that philip morris wrote: carcinogens are 16 found in practically every compound in smoke. 17 present technology does not permit selective 18 filtration. 19 what did they write to the surgeon general 20 two years later: none of the chemical 21 substances listed therein, to our knowledge, 22 have been found by scientific research to be 23 harmful to health. it is possible, of course, 24 to modify chemical components of cigarettes by 25 the use of filters. and they wrote that letter, philip morris 2 wrote that letter on behalf of all the tobacco 3 companies, including rj reynolds. 4 they lied to the surgeon general. all 5 right? the person who is looking out for 6 public health. 7 and this is their confession, okay? this 8 is a confession. our basic -- 9 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor. 10 the court: overruled. 11 mr. rosen: this is an internal tobacco 12 institute document, and you heard that all of 13 these executives were the heads of the tobacco 14 institute. they ran it. they ran the show, 15 along with the lawyers. 16 our basic position in the cigarette 17 controversy is subject to charge and may be 18 subject to the finding that we are making false 19 or misleading statements to promote the sale of 20 cigarettes. 21 they knew what they were doing, and they 22 forged ahead without any care in the world. 23 that is reckless. that is conscious disregard 24 for human life. that is what they chose to do. 25 that is what they chose to do. vivian wilkinson, she chose to try to quit 2 smoking a bunch of times and failed, not 3 knowing what they knew and not knowing what 4 they were doing. 5 filters are frauds. you saw the spike in 6 how much -- it started out, it was unfiltered 7 cigarettes, and then everybody was smoking 8 filters. today the market is almost 9 one hundred percent filtered cigarettes, and it all 10 happened when? when was filtered cigarettes? 11 well, look at that, right there in 1954. 12 right when the health issue starts coming out, 13 when the mouse painting studies, right when the 14 frank statement comes out. there could be 15 problems with smoking. what did the cigarette 16 industry do? more filters. let us get filters. 17 let us give light cigarettes. let us give 18 low-tar cigarettes. and they spiked. 19 it talks about how the industry has the 20 filtered market. 1963: here's our triple, our 21 quadruple, our quintuple filter, capable of 22 removing whatever constituents are in tobacco 23 smoke. 24 and they knew the smoker of a filtered 25 cigarette was getting as much or more nicotine and tar than they would have gotten from a 2 regular cigarette. 3 do you think vivian wilkinson knew that? 4 do you think that she knew when she switched to 5 a filter or light cigarette that every time she 6 took a puff, do not you think she is getting 7 something less, and they knew she was getting 8 more, more of the bad stuff. 9 because it was an illusion of filtration. 10 i mean, they knew it. all of these documents, 11 all of these companies knew it. 12 the person who switches from a high 13 filtration cigarette winds up smoking more 14 units in order to provide themselves the same 15 delivery that they had before. 16 i asked this question of dr. barnett: 17 it was reported vivian wilkinson switched 18 to filters because she thought they were safer? 19 there was somebody that reported that? 20 yes. 21 there was also reports that vivian 22 wilkinson switched to light cigarettes, tried 23 light cigarettes in the 1980s, because she felt 24 they were safer? 25 yes. she relied, she believed, and they 2 capitalized on it. not just her, but millions 3 and millions of people who all switched to 4 light cigarettes under this false impression 5 that it was actually going to help them. 6 and all the while, happily for us, 7 nicotine is both habituating and unique. 8 this is an rj reynolds document. you 9 heard about claude teague. you will see 10 claude's teague name. he rose through the 11 ranks of rj reynolds: 12 happily for us, nicotine is both 13 habituating. 14 i mean, they are boasting about it. 15 the nicotine levels are not obtained by 16 accident. we can regulate nicotine fairly 17 precisely. 18 did you remember dr. cummings taking about 19 taking all of the nicotine out, they can take 20 it out; they put it back in, perfectly 21 controlling precisely the amount of nicotine in 22 every one of their cigarettes, uniform dosage 23 form? 24 any level management might require. it 25 talks about ph levels. smoke ph increases an increased proportion. total nicotine occurs in 2 the free form. 3 i mean, they studied it. they knew it. 4 and this is how they designed their cigarettes, 5 so people keep smoking and cannot put them down. 6 and what happens when their scientists -- 7 when there are scientists that are trying to 8 help the public? this was a doctor who was 9 studying to find an antagonist for nicotine. 10 that means that if you take a drug and it 11 blocks your nicotine receptors, right, so you 12 are not going to want to smoke, right? 13 what do they do? if it goes forward, we 14 are in the process of digging our own grave, 15 right? 16 their goal would have the potential of 17 putting the tobacco manufacturers out of 18 business. 19 from the plaza hotel up until 1994, well, 20 really until 2000, these folks, this industry, 21 this company, this corporation lied, deceived, 22 in an unspeakable, unthinkable manner. 23 and that is what we are talking about, 24 punitive damages. this was how much money they 25 spent on their marketing and their campaign, right? how much money i read to you. i stood 2 up and i think i read to you some requests for 3 admissions, about how much they are paying the 4 ti and the tobacco research committee, each 5 company, millions and millions of dollars. 6 the tobacco industry spent more on 7 advertising cigarettes in one day than the 8 government could spend in a year. they were 9 outspending everybody. 10 they want you to think that everybody 11 knew, everybody believed that cigarettes -- 12 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor. 13 the court: sustained. 14 mr. rosen: 1964, the surgeon general -- 15 mr. hohnbaum: move to strike, your honor. 16 the court: the jury is to disregard the 17 last comment. 18 counsel, talk about the evidence. 19 mr. rosen: yes, your honor, sorry. 20 1964, the surgeon general report comes 21 out. everyone -- everyone knows that cigarette 22 smoking is deadly, right? 23 in all of the other reports, it is all out 24 there, everyone knows. everyone is just 25 choosing to smoke. all right? holding strategy. the billions and 2 billions of dollars worked. and this graph 3 shows and proves it, okay? this graph does not 4 lie. this graph does not lie. 5 what they did worked, and it affected 6 countless, countless people, with a level of, 7 you know, untold harm and suffering. 8 there it is. i knew it was somewhere. 9 i mean, it is right there. you see, it 10 keeps spiking. even after whatever report came 11 out, whatever the government is trying to 12 convey, their message was much, much stronger. 13 and they had to lie about addiction. they 14 had to keep it secret, because they knew that 15 addiction was key to their argument that 16 smokers just choose to smoke. it is their 17 choice. it is their free will. they enjoy it. 18 that is their choice. 19 they knew that they cannot defend continued 20 smoking as free choice if the person is 21 addicted. 22 23 "question: throughout your tenure with 24 american, it was not only american's position, 25 but your position that cigarettes were not injurious to health; is that accurate? 2 "answer: through my tenure? 3 "question: yes. 4 "answer: yes, that is so. 5 "question: that is something that 6 american tobacco wants the public to believe; 7 is that correct? 8 "answer: yes. 9 "question: it is a statement that the 10 american tobacco put great reliance on? 11 "answer: we issued that statement, yes. 12 certainly, we wanted them to believe it. 13 "question: as far as you you are 14 concerned, a person is justified in relying on 15 that statement? 16 "answer: yes." 17 (the video clip ended.) 18 mr. rosen: people, according to the 19 tobacco, the head ceo, this was in the 1980s, 20 were justified in relying on what they were 21 saying: cigarette smoking is not injurious to 22 health. 23 that is what he said. 24 there is an instruction -- this was the 25 ceo of american tobacco company. i want to make very, very clear, okay, that rj reynolds 2 is responsible for the harms of american 3 tobacco company and brown & williamson. they 4 are responsible. they are part of rj reynolds 5 now. all right? and that is an instruction 6 that you are going to get. 7 and so did she rely on their fraud? did 8 it work? did it have an impact on vivian? 9 yes. 10 did she rely on their conspiracy to 11 conceal about filtered cigarettes and whether 12 they were safe or whether they were unsafe? 13 yes. 14 state whether you find -- and this is the 15 question on whether punitive damages are 16 warranted in this case. 17 and i know i told you we are close to the 18 end, we are close to the end, all right? i told 19 you we are ahead of schedule. i saw some you, 20 your faces kind of lit up a little bit. we are 21 ahead of schedule. 22 if you answer "yes" to this question, we 23 are going to have a very short second phase, 24 probably come back tomorrow, but it will be 25 very short, and i promise you, my intent, i'm going to play a video that is probably less 2 than half an hour long. 3 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor. 4 the court: sustained. 5 mr. hohnbaum: move to strike again. 6 the court: the jury is to disregard the 7 last comment. it is stricken. 8 mr. rosen: if you answer "yes," it is a 9 short second phase of trial, just on the issue 10 of punitive damages, okay? 11 we protect kids. we protect children. we 12 do not addict them, all right? and rj reynolds 13 is treated just like a person. a corporation 14 is treated like a person. 15 they targeted kids. vivian wilkinson was 16 13 years old when she started smoking. she was 17 exactly who they were looking for, and she was 18 their perfect customer. 19 20 >>: cigarettes manufactures are not 21 interested in obtaining new business from 22 teenagers in our society. 23 >>: but how can you stay in business if 24 you cannot hook the kids? 25 >>: we have been in business very well, thank you, for some time now without attempting 2 to hook kids. we do everything possible to 3 discourage teenage smoking. 4 (the video clip ended.) 5 mr. rosen: i mean, the lies do not stop. 6 they do not end. they have targeted kids, and 7 it started back in the '20s, and we have the 8 documents. they were running around the 9 schools, big business. line up the most 10 popular students. get these kids started 11 early, because they knew that smokers do not 12 start smoking over the age of essentially 25, 13 and i think 80 to ninety percent under 18 is when 14 they start smoking. that is when people start 15 smoking. you do not see people start smoking at 16 30, 35. they have got to get the children. 17 and they studied them. they stalked these 18 kids. 19 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor. 20 the court: sustained. 21 mr. hohnbaum: move to strike. 22 the court: the jury will disregard the 23 last comment. 24 mr. rosen: high school students, 25 freshman, sophomores, juniors, seniors in high school. that is how they create addiction. 2 you heard dr. cummings. you heard 3 dr. drobes talk about how the kids' brains are 4 actually developing, the frontal lobe; how it 5 actually affects and changes the kids' frontal 6 lobes growing up. that is the part of the brain 7 that deals with impulse. 8 they studied the 14- to 20-year-old market 9 in hopes to discover the secret of the instant 10 popularity. creating a fad in this market 11 could be a bonanza. 12 that is what they wanted, a bonanza. this 13 huge business opportunity for rj reynolds and 14 the other companies. 15 this is an rj reynolds document. in 1960, 16 the young adult market, the 14- to 24-year-old 17 age group, they represent tomorrow's cigarette 18 business. the 14-year-old kids. she was 13. 19 she was right in their sweet spot. they got 20 her a little bit early. 21 right here. i mean, this they studied how 22 to induce a presmoker, right? we need to 23 consider another aspect of the business. 24 that is the factors which induce a presmoker. 25 he does not start -- he does not start to smoke to satisfy a non-existent craving for 2 nicotine. people do not start smoking for 3 nicotine, right? they see other people, they 4 see advertisements, they see it is cool, it is 5 normal, it is risky, right? it is rebellious. 6 but once they start, they cannot stop. it 7 changes to that, to craving for nicotine. 8 why do you think they spent the amount of 9 money on all of the advertising, all of the 10 television shows, and the flintstones and lucy 11 and all of the other shows? 12 because that had no effect on anybody, 13 right? all of the advertising, all of the 14 marketing, that did not have any effect on 15 anybody. we do not want anybody to start 16 smoking our product. 17 realistically -- this is rj reynolds, some 18 thoughts about the new brands of the cigarette 19 market: realistically, if our company is to 20 survive over the long-term, we must gain our 21 share of the youth market. 22 fourteen to 24. we need to increase 23 penetration among the 14- to 24-year-olds. 24 that is 1975. 25 this is what they sent. they sent this letter in 1990, all the way in 1990. some kids 2 contact rj reynolds, and what do they write? 3 despite all of the research going on, the 4 simple and unfortunate fact, scientists do not 5 know the case or causes of chronic diseases 6 reported. we would appreciate your passing 7 this information. 8 pass this along to the kids. let them 9 know. to date, science has not proven it is 10 harmful. go ahead and smoke. 11 and what about nicotine? you know, 12 nicotine, everybody knew that nicotine is 13 addictive, right? everyone knew about that. 14 they deliberately downplayed the role of 15 nicotine. they deliberately downplayed it, 16 right? 17 so people do not know that is the reason why 18 they have to smoke 20 or 30 or 40 cigarettes a 19 day, day in and day out, for decades. 20 youth market. twelve-year-olds. young 21 adult smokers. replacement smokers. a 22 replacement smoker, because people die, and 23 they need to replace that person with a kid. 24 with a fresh crop. 25 vivian wilkinson was a replacement smoker. all right? she replaced the people that died 2 on the other end. and they knew it, and that is 3 what they wanted. and that is who they 4 targeted. 5 there is going to be another issue: 6 percentage of fault you get to decide, okay? 7 you get to decide relative fault on the 8 parties. you can decide if vivian wilkinson 9 had fault. maybe she did not try hard enough to 10 quit. maybe she should not smoke after she got 11 copd. you make that decision. all right? 12 but when you make that decision, look at 13 everything in context. all right? and the way 14 i say you look at this, if two people come to 15 the table, vivian wilkinson comes down and sits 16 at the table, rj reynolds sits down at the 17 table, who has more information? who has more 18 knowledge? who knows what is going on with 19 these cigarettes and what they were doing? 20 so i would suggest to you, i'm just going 21 to put a number, rj reynolds, ninety percent; 22 vivian wilkinson, ten percent. 23 and you can change that. that is up to 24 you. this is your decision, okay? your 25 decision. the court: you have 10 minutes, counsel. 2 mr. rosen: thank you, your honor. 3 corporations cannot conduct themselves in 4 the way rj reynolds and these other companies 5 did. they cannot do it. you cannot conceal. 6 you cannot commit fraud. you cannot cause death. 7 if you do, you are responsible for those 8 harms. they are responsible for the harms they 9 caused. okay? 10 and this, the harm that this company 11 caused, this family is the highest level of 12 harm. it does not get more than this. okay? 13 families destroyed. this family 14 destroyed. they were a happy family, and 15 vivian wilkinson worked hard, and she raised 16 her kids, and she did her best, and she did a 17 good job. she did a good job. 18 and so you are going to have to decide, and 19 i'm going to ask you, and i'm going to suggest 20 to you a number. i want to explain this. the 21 number is a suggestion. you can go higher or 22 you can go lower. it is up to you. you make 23 the decision, and vivian and her family will 24 respect whatever decision you make, okay? 25 i want to start with william wilkinson. i want to start with no. 2, okay? no. 8, excuse 2 me. 3 this gentleman took the stand, and he 4 shared with you his feelings, and they were 5 significant, and for a man who is a man like 6 him, a soldier, a war veteran, okay? i'm sure 7 it was not easy. i know you saw it. 8 and it was serious, and it was deep, and 9 it was right into the soul of this man. and i 10 would suggest to you that he lost someone very, 11 very dear. if you were to take that pain that 12 this man has and spread it over a 700 man 13 squadron -- 14 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor. 15 the court: sustained. 16 mr. rosen: if you were to take that pain, 17 you would not see a single smiling face, okay? 18 you would not see a -- 19 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor. 20 the court: i sustained the objection 21 previously, counsel. 22 mr. rosen: you will decide the level of 23 harm. vivian turner, she lost her best friend. 24 that is what she said. 25 and she watched and she was there. you have the medical records. you are going to see 2 the last days, the last months, the last years, 3 two years, you will see two years, vivian 4 wilkinson in and out of the hospital with copd. 5 end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary 6 disease is devastating. it is devastating. 7 people cannot breathe. they are on oxygen. it 8 is -- it is a slow way of suffocating, and she 9 saw it, and she was there with her best friend. 10 you decide how significant that is. and i 11 suggest to you that level of harm is 12 overwhelming. and so i'm going to suggest to 13 you these numbers, and they are just 14 suggestions. you make a decision whether you 15 want to go higher or lower. it is up to you. 16 all right. but i would suggest for each, 17 for vivian wilkinson and eugene wilkinson, i 18 would suggest $2 million each. 19 punitive damages. that is going to be that 20 last question. it is to punish and deter 21 companies from doing similar conduct. it is so 22 that other corporations, not just rj reynolds, 23 it is to punish rj reynolds, but to let other 24 companies know this is not the way we do 25 business. we do not accept this in our country. and so you decide whether we have met our 2 burden that they have risen to being guilty of 3 intentional misconduct, whether we proved that 4 by clear and convincing evidence. 5 and you have all of the documents, and i 6 do not think it would be any more clear or 7 convincing -- 8 mr. hohnbaum: objection as to "i do not 9 think." 10 the court: sustained. no personal. 11 mr. rosen: it cannot be any more clear and 12 convincing than those documents. you take a 13 look at them and you decide. 14 they stood before congress. this was a 15 year after vivian wilkinson was diagnosed with 16 the disease that killed her. 17 18 >>: placed under oath, do you or do not 19 agree with the surgeon general's testament of 20 over 400,000 smokers died? 21 >>: i do not agree. 22 >>: do you know how many die each year? 23 >>: i do not know. 24 mr. rosen: it is rj reynolds right there. 25 >>: they agreed that smoking causes lung cancer. do you agree? 2 >>: it may. 3 >>: do you know whether it does? 4 >>: i do not. 5 >>: the medical experts agree that 6 smoking causes emphysema. do you agree? 7 >>: it may. 8 >>: they agree that smoking causes 9 bladder cancer, stroke and low birth weight. 10 do you agree? 11 >>: it may. 12 >>: mr. tisch, i want to move to you for 13 a moment. in a deposition last year you were 14 asked whether smoking causes cancer. 15 your answer was, "i do not believe so." 16 do you stand by that answer today? 17 >>: i do, sir. 18 >>: you are head of a manufacturer of a 19 product that is been accused by the overwhelming 20 scientific community to cause cancer. 21 you do not know? you do not have an 22 interest in finding out? 23 >>: i do, sir, yes. 24 >>: and what have you done to pursue that 25 interest? >>: well, we have looked at the data, and 2 the data that we have been able to see has all 3 been statistical data that has not convinced me 4 that smoking causes death. 5 >>: mr. campbell, you were also deposed, 6 and you said, "to my knowledge, it has not been 7 proven that cigarette smoking causes cancer." 8 will you ever be convinced, and what 9 evidence are you waiting for? 10 >>: let us have the microphone passed 11 over. 12 >>: yes, i may be convinced. we do not 13 know what causes cancer in general right now, 14 so i think that we may find out what causes 15 cancer, and we may find out some relationship 16 which has yet to be proven. 17 >>: let me begin my questioning on the 18 matter of whether or not nicotine is addictive. 19 let me ask you first, and i would like to just 20 go down the row, whether each of you believes 21 that nicotine is not addictive. 22 i heard virtually all of you touch on it. 23 just yes or no. 24 do you believe nicotine is not addictive? 25 >>: i believe nicotine is not addictive, yes. 2 >>: mr. johnston. 3 >>: congressman, cigarettes and nicotine 4 clearly do not meet the classic definitions of 5 addiction. there is no intoxication. 6 >>: we will take that as a no. again, time 7 is short. if you can just -- i think each of 8 you believe nicotine is not addictive. we 9 would like to have it for the record. 10 >>: i do not believe that nicotine or our 11 products are addictive. 12 >>: i believe nicotine is not addictive. 13 >>: i believe that nicotine is not 14 addictive. 15 >>: i believe that nicotine is not 16 addictive. 17 >>: and i, too, believe that nicotine is 18 not addictive. 19 (the video clip ended.) 20 mr. rosen: are punitive damages warranted 21 in this case? what they did? what these 22 companies did? it screams punitive damages. 23 so i would suggest you answer "yes." 24 it is a lot. i really truly, on behalf of 25 everyone here, thank you so much for your time. i understand it was a true sacrifice. thank 2 you. 15 mr. rosen: thank you, your honor. may it 16 please the court. 17 so now this is my last opportunity, okay? 18 i'm sorry, i just keep coming back up. this is 19 it, okay? from there, you do not have to listen 20 to me. you are going to go back into the back 21 and decide the outcome of this case. 22 there is a saying that i heard before, and 23 i think it is appropriate and i want to discuss 24 it: many are called upon, but few are chosen. 25 okay. there was a very large roomful of people here when we started jury selection, and 2 it came down to you, you folks. 3 and one of the primary reasons is because 4 each of you showed that you can be fair and 5 impartial jurors in this case. all right? 6 and i think that you heard other jurors 7 say how they think these cases are frivolous, 8 people should not have a right to bring these 9 lawsuits, and i would suggest to you that you 10 can take that same impartiality into 11 consideration when you look at some of the 12 people's testimony in this case. 13 barbara walsh. all right. she talked 14 about willfully, enjoyably, and i believe it is 15 frivolous. 16 all right. when she testified, i asked 17 her: how do you feel about these lawsuits? 18 she said: angry that it would take 15, 16 19 years. i'm not too sure as when vivian passed 20 away. it would take that long for her daughter 21 to try to collect money for something her 22 mother willfully and enjoyably, and i believe 23 it is frivolous. it is a waste of everyone's 24 time and energy, mine included. 25 and she said: these lawsuits are frivolous and ludicrous. 2 you know, that is not impartiality. that 3 is not impartiality. she is an independent 4 witness. okay? but she did come in -- she 5 testified in this case with partiality. 6 and the most -- the best evidence in this 7 case regarding vivian wilkinson's health back 8 then are the medical records. those are 9 medical records from back in 1993. 10 they are documented. they were documented 11 back then, and they are not testimony from 12 someone, from barbara walsh 20 years later or 13 30 years later. okay? 14 and so this was -- this was the most 15 important thing. 16 can you bring up the admission note, the 17 note from baptist hospital, please? 18 and counsel brought this up. there is a 19 note that talked about doxycycline, and we 20 heard about that. it is a prescription 21 medication. it is a prescription medication, 22 and she reported it when she went to the 23 doctor. all right? 24 what did not she report? there is no 25 report about using inhalers. i mean, she went to the doctor, and she could not breathe, and 2 she was asked, what are you taking, and she 3 said doxycycline. but she does not say, i'm 4 taking proventil. she did not say, i'm taking 5 some type of inhaler back then, before that 6 time. she was not. she was not. 7 maybe she had used an inhaler at some 8 point in time before, but at the time of this 9 visit, she was not using any type of inhaler. 10 and you know what else this tells us? it 11 tells us that she saw a doctor. she got a 12 prescription medication. presumably, if she 13 saw a doctor, right? would not that doctor -- 14 she said she -- 15 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor, 16 speculation. 17 the court: this is argument. overruled. 18 mr. rosen: she should have gone to a 19 doctor earlier, right? she should have gone to 20 a doctor earlier. 21 if she did, they would have done either a 22 pft, pulmonary function test, and they would 23 have found what she had, or they would have 24 referred her to a pulmonary doctor, and they 25 would have done it. we have evidence that she saw someone, and 2 before she visits in april of 1993, when she 3 goes to the doctor, they ask her, do you have 4 any type of illnesses, issues, diseases, and 5 she says none, no diseases, nothing. all 6 right? 7 and she reports no history, no other prior 8 history. she talks about a car accident, 9 right? she is hospitalized for a car accident 10 at some point before this visit. all right? 11 if she had a car accident and she was 12 hospitalized, they would have examined her. 13 they would have looked at and would have 14 checked her out. and you know what? they 15 did not diagnose her. 16 so we have evidence of visits before this. 17 so everything they are telling us -- if she had 18 gone to a doctor, right, that is their argument. 19 and so if someone says, well, she should 20 have gone to a doctor, you can let them know. 21 she did go to a doctor, right? she did go 22 to a doctor, and they did not diagnose her with 23 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. that is 24 what this record reflects, a record from the -- 25 from back then. this is also important. this is a video. 2 barbara walsh was asked by defense counsel, 3 back in 1983: did you connect her shortness of 4 breath with her smoking? 5 and what did she say? 6 can you play that video, 116? 7 8 "question: in your own mind connect her 9 shortness of breath with her smoking? 10 "answer: not really, no. 11 "question: ms. wilkinson ever do or say 12 anything that indicated to you that she was 13 aware that smoking could cause damage to your 14 health? 15 "answer: i do not think we ever had a 16 conversation regarding that." 17 (the video clip ended.) 18 mr. rosen: she never made a connection. 19 the person who is testifying about inhalers, she 20 never made the connection that her shortness of 21 breath equals -- was caused by smoking, and the 22 defense is arguing, well, vivian wilkinson 23 should have. 24 and then this, you know, this is also, 25 this is also important, 117. i asked her: sitting here today, do you believe that 2 smoking is harmful to you? 3 i'm not concerned about it, so i guess 4 that has to be a no. 5 you know, barbara walsh talked about 6 willfully, enjoyably. she talked about the 7 daughter waiting 16 years to collect money. 8 she knew nothing about this case or the 9 history, that this started back in 1994, or the 10 history from 1953 going forward. she knows 11 nothing about it. 12 and she is judging it, she is judging it 13 without any basis. and so to say that vivian 14 wilkinson willfully and it was enjoyable, 15 barbara walsh still thinks that. 16 and, you know, you almost have to kind of 17 feel bad because she testified she is a smoker. 18 she is still smoking. 19 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor. 20 the court: sustained. 21 mr. hohnbaum: move to strike. 22 the court: the jury is to disregard the 23 last comment. 24 mr. rosen: we talked about -- counsel 25 talked about dr. barnett. she admitted 23 million americans are addicted. she said 2 half of daily -- half of the daily smokers are 3 addicted. that was her testimony, right? 4 then why not, in fifty percent of the cases 5 she testified in, is the smoker addicted? 6 is not that strange, that she says 7 fifty percent, if you are a regular daily smoker, 8 fifty percent of those people are going to be 9 addicted, but the cases that she is hired by 10 lawyers in these cases and she testifies, none 11 of them are addicted. none of them, by her own 12 statistics, you know. 13 and then they are saying, listen, she is 14 the only psychiatrist, she is the only person, 15 right? 16 you know, people do not -- she admitted 17 people do not go to her for nicotine addiction. 18 they go to her for other issues, bipolar or 19 they have some other drug abuse problem. the 20 nicotine addiction is secondary for her. no 21 one goes to her. i think she said one out of 22 thousands of people, right? 23 people who have addictions to cigarettes, 24 they get help from either their primary care 25 physician, because they go in and have an issue, or they go to a doctor like dr. reed, a 2 pulmonologist, and they cannot breathe anymore. 3 dr. reed says you have to stop smoking; 4 here is some medication; here are the things. 5 those are the people on the front line: 6 primary care doctors, the pulmonologists, the 7 people who are taking care of these people 8 getting diseases. by the time they are getting 9 this help, it is too late. it is too late. 10 by the time vivian wilkinson got that 11 patch in 1993, it was too late. 12 dr. gidel. i want to talk a little bit 13 more about the statute of limitations. 14 dr. gidel, he was the person that was treating 15 her. 16 let us bring up 114. 17 this was question concerning the pulmonary 18 function test and whether or not before 1990 it 19 would be mild, moderate, severe. 20 the next question: could you say with any 21 degree of certainty whether she had copd? 22 well, she may or may not have had 23 symptoms. 24 if you had done a pulmonary function test 25 prior to 1990, she probably would show some changes, right? 2 okay. and the question is: "you do not 3 know if that would be mild or not?" 4 "answer: i do not know if it would be 5 mild, moderate or severe at that point, no. 6 that is the doctor that was taking care of 7 her. 8 let us talk about -- talk about these 9 people, right? her father. this is a person 10 who influences her. he was a smoker. that was 11 the testimony. he was smoking, and you 12 think -- really, how bad do you think he 13 thought cigarette smoking was when he gives his 14 son, his own boy, a pack of cigarettes to smoke 15 until he gets sick? right? he is a smoker. 16 her sister, happy, josephine's testimony, 17 she was a smoker. those are the influences. 18 mr. malloy was brought up, right? about 19 what he -- what he talked about and how he 20 warned, mr. malloy warned vivian about the 21 health risks of smoking. 22 let us see if we can find this. no. 127. 23 "did you ever hear any of ms. wilkinson's 24 siblings warn her about smoking? 25 "answer: no, not to my knowledge. "question: did any member of your family 2 warn ms. wilkinson? 3 "answer: not to my knowledge." 4 that is the ex-husband. 5 dr. farber, 126. this is their doctor: 6 "you agree, sir, that copd is frequently 7 underdiagnosed clinically, true? 8 "answer: that is probably true, yes." 9 all right. vivian wilkinson might have 10 seen a doctor. we have records that show she 11 had to have seen somebody for a car accident to 12 get that doxycycline, right? it is 13 underdiagnosed. 14 they cannot meet their burden. she would 15 have gone -- she should have gone to a doctor, 16 and this doctor would have somehow done the 17 pulmonary function test and told her, you have 18 copd and it is caused by smoking. 19 it is the farthest stretch. 20 joseph wicks, right? joseph wicks. you 21 know, sometimes you have to fact-check. that 22 is what my job is, fact-check. i'm 23 listening -- 24 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor. 25 mr. rosen: -- listening to counsel. the court: sustained. 2 mr. rosen: you heard counsel bring up 3 that it was -- she was in her 40s when she had 4 breathing problems. i think that is what 5 counsel said. 6 128, please. 7 "when you say 48, 49, 50, are you 8 referring to vivian's age? was that she got 9 into her late 40s and 50s? 10 "no. years, years. 11 "you think she started coughing from 12 smoking late 1940s? 13 "yeah." 14 next slide. 119. 15 and this is my question to him: 16 "i want to clarify because earlier you 17 were asked about vivian's health. 18 "yes. 19 "okay. you said first noticed her having 20 shortness of breath in the '40s? 21 "yes. 22 "in the '40s, vivian was 17 or 18? 23 "no, it was not the '40s. he was talking 24 about the years, the 40s. 25 "and so to clarify for the record, the first time you observed vivian's shortness of 2 breath was after reed was born, right?" 3 what does he say? "yes." 4 let us see the video, 115. 5 now, this is what he said, and this is 6 what he talked when the symptoms came and when 7 he had conversations with vivian about it. 8 9 "question: you have two grandchildren? 10 "answer: yes. 11 "question: what are their names? 12 "answer: david joseph and reed, thomas 13 reed. 14 "question: and david joseph was born in 15 1988? 16 "answer: yes. 17 "question: and thomas reed was born in 18 1990? 19 "answer: yes, two years later. 20 "question: was reed a little boy the 21 first time you observed your sister vivian 22 having health problems? 23 "answer: he was smaller. i do not know 24 how old he was then. 25 "question: before reed was born, how was vivian's health? 2 "answer: i think her health was all right 3 before he was born. 4 "question: before reed was born? 5 "answer: yes. 6 "question: based on your observations, 7 she was in good health? 8 "answer: yes. 9 "question: to clarify for the record, was 10 the first time you observed vivian having 11 shortness of breath after reed was born? 12 "answer: yes, yes. 13 "question: and was the first time you 14 observed vivian having a smoker's cough, was 15 that after reed was born? 16 "answer: yes." 17 (the video clip ended.) 18 mr. rosen: that is testimony. she was not 19 in her 40s. i was very clear. we talked very 20 clearly about the 1990s, when reed was born. 21 that was an anchoring time that he was able to 22 remember. ninety-one years old. 23 the court: excuse me. counsel, slow 24 down. 25 mr. rosen: sorry about that. she is typing furiously. thank you. 2 the court: i see steam coming out of the 3 court reporter's ears. 4 mr. rosen: dr. farber, i asked him about 5 symptoms of copd, 128. it might be 123. 123. 6 "there a lot of different symptoms 7 associated? 8 "yes. 9 "cough? 10 "yes. 11 "wheezing? 12 "yes. 13 "sputum production? 14 "yes." 15 she had none of those symptoms, that is 16 what every witness talked about, before 1990. 17 none of those symptoms. none. and she should 18 have gone to the doctor. 19 125. 20 "you agree that it is possible for someone 21 to have fifty percent lung function and a person 22 is still not showing symptoms? 23 "they may not, that is right." 24 that is their doctor. fifty percent. she 25 was operating on fifty percent, and she may not have symptoms. 2 i asked dr. reed about inhalers for 3 treatment of asthma, wheezing. it could be for 4 bronchitis, helping to bring up mucous, for 5 shortness of breath. they may be anxious or 6 shortness of breath and other reasons, as well. 7 "were there any inhalers that were 8 available over-the-counter in the '80s and the 9 '90s? 10 "yes, there were inhalers available 11 over-the-counter. 12 "can you explain to the jury, what are 13 some of the reasons people have shortness of 14 breath? 15 "asthma, acute bronchitis, restrictive 16 lung disease, damage to the lung, lung trauma." 17 it goes on. many, many other things. 18 just because she may have had shortness of 19 breath -- may have, okay, because i suggest to 20 you the record does not support that -- if she 21 did, it does not mean she had copd. you needed 22 to go to a doctor, and they would have said, 23 you have copd. 24 you know, counsel brought up youth 25 marketing, right? how does a youth marketing document in 1970 have anything to do with 2 vivian wilkinson, right? 3 pt 3400. 4 1984: younger adult strategies. this is 5 rj reynolds. how does it have to do with 6 vivian wilkinson, right? 7 the critical factor in the growth and 8 decline of every major brand over the last 50 9 years. okay? she started smoking over the 10 last 50 years. 11 this goes back. if you go from 1984 back 12 50 years, i think doing my math -- i'm not 13 going to get it right. 1933, '34. that is what 14 it looks like. that is why it is relevant, 15 because they were targeting her back then. 16 you know, i think barbara walsh did see 17 vivian using inhalers -- 18 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor, as 19 to what he thinks. 20 the court: sustained. 21 mr. rosen: more likely than not, it was 22 probably diagnosed after 1993, because she had 23 inhalers and she was -- 24 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor. 25 mr. rosen: that is what -- the court: sustained. 2 ladies and gentlemen, you are to rely on 3 your own recollection of the evidence. 4 mr. rosen: they are saying she was 5 negligent for not going to the doctor. she was 6 negligent? their conduct was intentional and 7 calculated. 8 we already talked about the car accident, 9 the fact that she would have seen somebody, and 10 she never had a diagnosis. 11 can you bring up -- just that. do you 12 have it? 13 1993. what major illnesses have you had? 14 none. none. 15 so if someone says that she was diagnosed 16 with something or she should have known she had 17 something, in 1993, when she asked, she thought 18 she had none. 19 she had health insurance. that is the 20 testimony, she had health insurance. and they 21 talked about alcohol. she was able to stop 22 using alcohol, control her alcohol. do you 23 know what that shows? you know, that shows 24 that she was able to stop alcohol, but she 25 could never stop using nicotine. right? she was able to stop one thing, but she could not 2 stop the other. 3 you know, she had -- she had a second 4 chance, and she raised two beautiful kids. 5 how many chances did rj reynolds have? 6 how many chances did they have to change, to 7 make a difference, to make things right? 8 you know, they talked about there is no 9 proof of reliance, there is no proof that 10 concealment/reliance would have changed 11 anything. 12 you know, people have an instinct for 13 survival. you make a decision whether all of 14 this information would have changed the way 15 vivian wilkinson looked at life and looked at 16 smoking. right? 17 about the flue-curing and the ph and the 18 bronchodilators and the flavoring and the 19 ventilation tricks and the ammoniation, and 20 everything else that they do to these 21 cigarettes. 22 you know, if she knew -- they talked about 23 everyone knew that nicotine was -- everyone 24 knew that nicotine was harmful, addictive, 25 right? i think that is what counsel said, everyone knew. 2 pt 02077. it is a brown & williamson 3 document. 4 very few consumers -- this is what the 5 tobacco industry -- what year is this? 6 mr. philipson: 1978. 7 mr. rosen: 1978. very few consumers are 8 aware of the effect of nicotine, either its 9 addictive nature and nicotine is a poison. 10 everyone knew? not true. the industry 11 knew that the consuming public did not know and 12 they relatively were not aware. 13 1964. everybody knew, everybody knew that 14 nicotine was harmful. you could stand on a 15 rooftop and yell it, and this was a major 16 event, and everyone is going to stop smoking. 17 pt 19233. what is the industry saying? 18 "propaganda blast was tremendous, and the 19 penetration of the public opinion widespread. 20 i have the feeling that the public reaction -- 21 i have the feeling that the public reaction was 22 not as severe in order to have the emotional 23 depth that i feared." 24 the industry had no problem with it. it 25 did not have the impact. and they capitalized on it. 2 you know, we heard about warning labels. 3 there was a warning label on all of the packs, 4 right? 5 pt 01040. 6 rj reynolds document. let us see what they 7 say about warning labels. 8 they looked at it as a plus. they looked 9 at it as a plus because kids see a warning 10 label, they think it is dangerous, it is a little 11 risky, it is rebellious. they looked at it as a 12 positive. 13 they talked about dr. cummings said that, 14 you know, in the 1970s and '80s, the public 15 health authorities were telling people to 16 switch to filters and light cigarettes. 17 dr. cummings' testimony, it was a major 18 mistake doing that. they never would have done 19 it had they known. 20 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor, 21 motion. 22 the court: sustained. 23 mr. hohnbaum: move to strike, please. 24 the court: jury is to disregard. 25 mr. rosen: counsel, you know, i agree with one thing. i agree with one thing. many 2 things said, but i agree with one thing: their 3 conduct was offensive. all right? and i think 4 mr. keehfus said dr. cummings showed some wrong 5 stuff, some bad stuff. 6 this is not wrong stuff. this is not bad 7 stuff. this is pure evil. pure evil. 8 mitigating evidence. well, now they are 9 regulated. in 2009, 2009, they are regulated. 10 forty-five years it took for them to be 11 regulated. 12 and you know what? this is what they said 13 about regulation. 14 pt 02009. 15 "i will be more cautious in using the 16 pharmacomedical model. do we really want to 17 tout cigarette smoke as a drug? it is, of 18 course, but there are dangerous fda 19 implications to having such conceptualization 20 go beyond these walls." 21 these companies did not want to be 22 regulated, and it took 45 years. and you know 23 what that is? mitigation? too little too 24 late. okay? because they were not regulated 25 when vivian wilkinson was smoking. and then ctr. they just put something 2 about the ctr. they funded all research, all 3 of this great stuff. are they still saying 4 that ctr was a good thing? 5 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor. 6 still. 7 the court: thank you. 8 counsel, just argue the facts, all right? 9 mr. rosen: you have the evidence on what 10 ctr was and what they did. okay? and who they 11 influenced. 12 this is who they were going after: the 13 public health, the schools, mass media, popular 14 culture, house rules, government, federal 15 agencies, regulatory agencies. 16 mr. hohnbaum: objection, your honor, 17 motion in limine. 18 the court: counsel, that is your board. 19 he is reading off of your board. overruled. 20 mr. rosen: this is ctr. this is who ctr 21 is. it was an industry shield. it was a 22 front. that is what it is. that is what ctr 23 was, and that is who they influenced, and they 24 spent millions and millions and millions of 25 dollars to shape public opinion. so that why? that curve kept going up, 2 and people kept smoking. 3 mitigation. they have tried to make a safe 4 cigarette, right? spent all this money on 5 making a safe cigarette. 6 you know what testimony you heard? rj 7 reynolds just merged with lorillard. they just 8 bought another company that sells the most 9 popular menthol, combustible, traditional 10 cigarette, newport. that is who they are today. 11 they are not trying to make a safer cigarette. 12 their conduct is despicable. and the 13 evidence is overwhelming. they said to me 14 about the evidence overwhelming. the evidence 15 is overwhelming in this case on behalf of 16 plaintiff. she was addicted to the cigarettes 17 containing nicotine. it was a legal cause of 18 her copd. she died from it. she suffered from 19 it. 20 her family -- can you bring this up? 21 the court: wrap this up, counsel. 22 mr. rosen: wrapping it up. 23 it mattered. it affects people in the 24 most profound way. 25 i truly appreciate your time. thank you.
