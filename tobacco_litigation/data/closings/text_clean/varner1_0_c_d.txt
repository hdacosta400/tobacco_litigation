3 mr. geraghty: thank you, your honor. 4 may it please the court. 5 good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 6 jurors: good afternoon. 7 mr. geraghty: you know at this point 8 that my name is bill geraghty, and i represent 9 philip morris usa in this case. 10 i think it goes without saying that it 11 has been a long trial. and if you count the 12 voir dire process, we have been together now the 13 better part of two and a half weeks. and i 14 think we are all happy to be getting close to 15 the end of the case. 16 and i want to start the same way 17 mr. schlesinger did, and that is by thanking 18 you for your jury service. we appreciate very 19 much that you all have made a tremendous 20 sacrifice of your time to be here for the 21 better part of two and a half weeks. 22 and we know from the questions that you 23 yourselves put to the witnesses that you have 24 been paying close attention to the evidence, 25 and we really appreciate that. we are getting very close to the end of 2 the case. and pretty soon, judge murphy is 3 going to give you the final legal instructions 4 and a verdict form. 5 and that verdict form will have the 6 questions that you will answer that will decide 7 the issues in this case. 8 but before you head off to deliberate, 9 this is my opportunity to summarize the 10 evidence that we have seen and heard over the 11 last two weeks. 12 and when i first spoke to you almost two 13 weeks ago, i told you that the plaintiff would 14 spend a lot of time talking about statements 15 made and ideas held by philip morris and 16 r.j. reynolds, many of which were made 30, 40, 17 and in some instances, more than 50 years ago. 18 and i also told you we would not try to 19 defend those statements. 20 philip morris and r.j. reynolds made 21 statements and expressed ideas that today, no 22 one would say or think. 23 i told you that for too long, they denied 24 the fact that cigarette smoking caused lung 25 cancer, and that cigarette smoking could be addictive, long after the public already knew 2 those things. 3 and i told you all of that, ladies and 4 gentlemen, two weeks ago before any of the 5 evidence was presented. 6 but i also told you that if that was all 7 this case was about, if all the plaintiff had 8 to prove was that cigarette company executives 9 made inappropriate statements, we would not have 10 spent the last two weeks together. 11 but we did. and that is because, ladies 12 and gentlemen, this case is not about all 13 cigarette smokers. 14 the case is not about whether you believe 15 people should or should not smoke cigarettes. 16 this case is about virginia varner, it is 17 about her life, and the decisions that she made 18 about how to live her life. 19 and that is why when you get that verdict 20 form from judge murphy, you will see that every 21 question asks you specifically about virginia 22 varner. not all cigarette smokers and not the 23 general public. 24 now, you have heard dr. proctor. and 25 dr. proctor told you he has made $4 million testifying against philip morris and other 2 cigarette companies. 3 he showed you many of the same documents 4 and videotapes that he has shown to literally 5 hundreds of other juries in other cases in 6 which he is testified. 7 what else did dr. proctor tell you? he 8 told you he knew absolutely nothing about 9 virginia varner. 10 he told you he had no idea whether 11 virginia varner ever read or saw or heard any 12 of the statements or any of the documents that 13 he showed you. 14 after being on the witness stand for four 15 days during that first week of the trial, he 16 told you nothing about virginia varner. 17 but now you know that is what this case is 18 all about. 19 you learned during the course of the last 20 two weeks that virginia varner was a strong, 21 intelligent, and capable person who lived her 22 life the way she wanted to live it. 23 she told her daughter decades ago in a 24 very matter-of-fact way, "these cigarettes are 25 killing me." smoking is killing me. that is what she 2 told her daughter decades ago. decades ago. 3 and years later, years later in 1992, 4 when her husband had a heart attack, when he 5 quit smoking and when he encouraged her to quit 6 for the very first time, what did she say to 7 him? 8 did she say: i want to quit? i've tried 9 to quit, but i cannot? 10 that is not what she said. what she said 11 to him, again, in a very matter-of-fact way 12 was, "i am going to die anyway." 13 "i am going to die anyway." 14 and, ladies and gentlemen, that tells you 15 about virginia varner's attitude about 16 cigarette smoking. 17 and she made no effort to quit in 1992 18 because she enjoyed smoking cigarettes, she 19 wanted to smoke. that is what she wanted to do. 20 what else have you heard about virginia 21 varner that is undisputed? well, mr. varner 22 told you that he knew that smoking could cause 23 lung cancer as far back as 1966 when those 24 first warning labels appeared on cigarette 25 packs. he told you he most likely discussed 2 those warning labels with virginia varner. 3 you heard that her mother was a heavy 4 cigarette smoker who was diagnosed with 5 emphysema in the late 1970s or early 1980s. 6 her mother eventually needed a wheelchair 7 and was bedridden from her illness. 8 around that same period of time, virginia 9 varner developed a smoker's cough and a 10 smoker's wheeze. 11 she discussed it with her own doctors. 12 the doctors told her the cough and the wheeze 13 are caused because you smoke cigarettes. 14 she told her daughter lori at that time, 15 "these cigarettes are killing me." 16 she told her that cigarette smoking was 17 addictive and cigarette smoking is bad for your 18 health. 19 the evidence has shown, ladies and 20 gentlemen, that virginia varner knew cigarette 21 smoking was dangerous and potentially addictive 22 for decades before she got lung cancer. 23 so ask yourself why plaintiff spent an 24 hour trying to persuade you that ms. varner was 25 somehow tricked into smoking. but what you heard is totally 2 inconsistent with the evidence that we have seen 3 and heard about virginia varner over the last 4 two weeks. 5 now, before i move on, let me say 6 something about the findings from the earlier 7 class action. 8 you heard judge murphy's instructions, 9 and there is no debate about this issue. those 10 findings do not tell you how to answer any of 11 the questions you will be asked to decide on 12 the verdict form. 13 and that is because, ladies and gentlemen, 14 you get to decide based on your verdict in this 15 case, based on the evidence you have heard over 16 the last two weeks, whether those findings have 17 any applicability to virginia varner and the 18 lifestyle choices that she made. 19 i told you in my opening statement two 20 weeks ago this case presents a simple question. 21 are we going to hold philip morris 22 responsible, legally responsible for virginia 23 varner's decision to smoke cigarettes and award 24 joseph varner millions of dollars in damages 25 when the evidence clearly shows that they lived their lives exactly the way they wanted to live 2 it; they smoked cigarettes because that is what 3 they wanted to do; and they had no real 4 interest in quitting, until the very end. 5 you now know, ladies and gentlemen, that 6 virginia varner never made any real effort to 7 quit smoking until 1994, when unfortunately she 8 was diagnosed with lung cancer. 9 you did not hear anything from 10 mr. schlesinger about that at all. 11 you are the only jury that has heard the 12 evidence in virginia varner's case, and you get 13 to decide the issues in this case. you get to 14 decide that, ladies and gentlemen. 15 now, in just a minute we are going to walk 16 through the significant events in virginia 17 varner's life, because this case is about her, 18 and we will show you that everything i told you 19 in my opening statement has turned out to be 20 true. 21 when i talked to you during the opening 22 statements two weeks ago, i discussed what i 23 called the sources of evidence. the sources of 24 evidence. and i asked you to pay close 25 attention to the important sources of evidence. and what did i mean by that? 2 well, just about everything you saw 3 during the course of this trial came from what 4 joseph varner himself told us in his deposition 5 and from what one of his children said in their 6 depositions. 7 and as i predicted two weeks ago, many of 8 the things that joseph varner and his children 9 tried to tell you during this trial are 10 inconsistent with or contradicted by what they 11 said in their deposition testimony under oath 12 before the trial started. 13 and i told you that you would get to be 14 the judges of the facts. you get to decide 15 what testimony you choose to believe in this 16 case. 17 judge murphy has given you the 18 instructions. and in the packet that you have 19 been given, there is an instruction on what is 20 called the believability of witnesses. i 21 believe it is instruction number 3 in your 22 packet. 23 and this is instruction number 3. 24 it says: in evaluating the believability 25 of any witness and the weight you will give the testimony of any witness, you may properly 2 consider. and then there is a series of things 3 for you to consider. 4 among them is: any interest the witness 5 may have in the outcome of the case. 6 and by "interest," we mean a financial 7 interest to what you now appreciate is to the 8 tune of $10 million. 9 the instruction goes on to say that you 10 can consider the reasonableness of the 11 testimony of the witness considered in the 12 light of all the evidence in the case, and in 13 light of your own experience and common sense. 14 ladies and gentlemen, i encourage you, i 15 ask you, i implore you to use your common sense 16 and your everyday life experiences when you 17 evaluate the testimony you have heard in this 18 case. 19 and that is particularly important when it 20 comes to mr. varner and his two children who 21 testified live in this courtroom. 22 judge murphy has told you that you can 23 accept or reject any testimony you hear in this 24 case. and that is your job and your job alone. 25 so let me give you some examples of when joseph varner and lori cohen and joey varner 2 told you one thing from this witness stand 3 during the trial, but said the exact opposite 4 in their depositions under oath. 5 you may remember when joseph varner, sr. 6 testified, the plaintiff. one of the very 7 first questions i asked him was: and you had 8 never tried to quit smoking at any point before 9 you had the heart attack in 1992, correct? 10 and he started to say: i think i did. 11 that is what he told you right from this 12 witness stand under oath. 13 but remember, ladies and gentlemen, we 14 showed you his videotaped deposition testimony 15 from before the trial, and we played it for 16 you. 17 can you show that, please? 18 this is what he said before the trial on 19 the same point. 20 21 22 follows:) 23 question: had you tried to quit before 24 the time you quit in 1992? 25 answer: no. (video clip concluded.) 2 mr. geraghty: so that was mr. varner in 3 his deposition about a year ago in august, 4 saying the exact opposite of what he tried to 5 tell you from the witness stand here during the 6 course of this trial. 7 now, later i asked him if he loved his 8 current wife, monique varner. this is the 9 testimony from here in court. 10 question: you loved monique, did not you? 11 answer: no. 12 well, is not it true that you used to love 13 monique, but not anymore? 14 his answer: i do not think so, no. 15 but then you may recall the judge allowed 16 me to confront him with the deposition 17 testimony he gave again, about a year before 18 the trial. and this is what he said. 19 before the trial, in his deposition under 20 oath, he said: so i do not love monique. i 21 used to, but i do not no more. 22 that was his testimony under oath in his 23 deposition. 24 so you have to ask yourselves, ladies and 25 gentlemen, in a case in which he is now asked to be awarded millions of dollars in damages, if 2 mr. varner is willing to deny under oath that 3 he was in love with a woman he lived with for 4 20 years -- 5 mr. schlesinger: objection. 6 the court: excuse me, what is the 7 objection? 8 overruled. 9 ladies and gentlemen, you rely on your 10 own recollection of the evidence. 11 proceed. 12 mr. geraghty: if mr. varner is willing 13 to deny under oath that he was in love with a 14 woman -- 15 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor. 16 it is mitigation, against the rule. 17 the court: thank you. i've instructed 18 the jury on this point, counsel. overruled. 19 you can proceed, counsel. 20 mr. geraghty: if mr. varner is willing 21 to deny under oath that he was in love with a 22 woman he spent 20 years with, can you believe 23 anything he tells you when it comes to the 24 substantive facts of this case? 25 what about lori cohen? she told you she moved to south carolina around the time his 2 father began a relationship with his second 3 wife, monique varner. 4 she told you she is only seen her father 5 two or three times in the last 20 years, but if 6 you believe what she said, she also said she would 7 seen him five or six times just since january 8 of this year. 9 so what did lori cohen say? 10 i asked lori cohen: you remember your 11 mother singing a song called smoke, smoke, 12 smoke that cigarette by a country performer 13 named tex williams? 14 her answer: i've heard of it. i do not 15 recall whether it was my mother, but i do not 16 recall -- but i do recall. 17 do not you recall that your mother sang 18 that song around the house? 19 her answer: no, sir, she did not sing it 20 around the house. 21 that is what lori cohen told you from this 22 witness stand in the last two weeks. 23 but then remember, judge murphy allowed 24 me to confront her with her deposition 25 testimony given before the trial. here is what she said in her deposition 2 testimony before trial. 3 have you ever heard the song smoke, 4 smoke, smoke that cigarette by a country 5 western artist tex williams? 6 answer: yes, smoke. 7 question: when do you first recall 8 hearing that song? 9 my mother sang it. 10 your mother would sing it? 11 answer: yeah. 12 that was lori cohen's testimony under 13 oath before the trial started. 14 what happened when i confronted her with 15 other testimony in the case? she initially 16 tried to tell you that her mother tried to quit 17 smoking a couple of times, and when she did, 18 she looked like a heroin addict coming off of 19 heroin. that is what lori cohen told you from 20 this witness stand. 21 but when i cross-examined her, she 22 admitted that her mother never tried to quit 23 smoking when her grandmother was diagnosed with 24 emphysema, when her doctors told her mother 25 that the cough and the wheeze were caused by smoking and when mr. varner had a heart attack. 2 and she also admitted to you that to her 3 knowledge, her mother never went a single day 4 without smoking cigarettes. that was lori 5 cohen's testimony. 6 and finally, what about joseph varner, 7 jr.? he testified that his mother said she 8 wanted to quit smoking numerous times. he said 9 he heard it a lot. 10 here is his testimony. again, this is on 11 direct examination, when mr. hammer was asking 12 the questions. 13 question: based upon your observations, 14 did you observe that your mom wanted to quit? 15 answer: yes. 16 tell us about that, please. 17 answer: well, i've heard her say, 18 numerous times, over the years. 19 but this is what he said when i asked him 20 questions on cross-examination. 21 is not it true that you do not recall your 22 mother making efforts to quit smoking before 23 she was diagnosed with lung cancer? 24 his answer: i do not remember. i do not 25 recall, no. and then i followed up: and you do not 2 recall your mother stopping smoking for even 3 one day before she was diagnosed with cancer? 4 his answer: i do not remember. i do not 5 remember. 6 and, in fact, one of you, ladies and 7 gentlemen, asked him a very insightful 8 question, which the court then read to him. 9 and the question was: when did mrs. varner 10 first tell you that she wanted to quit smoking? 11 he hemmed and he hawed, but at the end of 12 the day, he said he did not know. he did not 13 know. 14 so, ladies and gentlemen, you get to use 15 your common sense, your personal life 16 experiences, to draw reasonable conclusions and 17 inferences from the evidence and to decide 18 whether or not you are going to believe some of 19 the things that joseph varner and his children 20 have told you. 21 and, again, ladies and gentlemen, this is 22 your job and your job alone. 23 now, you may remember at the very 24 beginning of the case i told you this case was 25 about two words: control and responsibility. and i asked you to simply ask yourself 2 the following series of questions. and we are 3 going to walk through all the significant 4 events in virginia varner's life again. and 5 again, i would ask you, ask yourself the 6 following series of questions: who was in 7 control of her lifestyle choices? 8 who was in control of her efforts to quit 9 smoking? 10 who controlled her motivation to quit? 11 whether virginia varner was ever motivated to 12 quit at any time before 1994. 13 was virginia varner addicted? and if so, 14 was her addiction so strong, so substantial 15 that it robbed her of her free will? 16 or was virginia varner simply someone who 17 enjoyed smoking cigarettes and had no real 18 interest in quitting, until the very end? 19 and finally ask yourself, did virginia 20 varner rely on anything that philip morris or 21 r.j. reynolds said about the health risks or 22 addictive nature of smoking? 23 and when you answer these questions, when 24 you answer these questions on your own, you 25 will know that virginia varner was always in control and therefore responsible for her own 2 actions. 3 in this country we all have the right to 4 make decisions for ourselves, even decisions 5 that today, with the benefit of hindsight, we 6 might say were not in her best interests. we 7 believe in free will. that is a fundamental 8 principle upon which our country was founded. 9 you have the right to make your own 10 decisions in life, but with that right comes 11 the obligation to accept personal 12 responsibility for the consequences of those 13 decisions. 14 now let me just very briefly talk about 15 the burden of proof. joseph varner bears the 16 burden of proof on all of his claims in this 17 case by what the court referred to as the 18 greater weight of the evidence. 19 so what does that mean? that means that 20 mr. varner and his lawyers were required to 21 bring you more persuasive, more convincing 22 evidence than the mountain of evidence that 23 we have presented that virginia varner was always 24 in control; that she was not some hopeless, 25 mindless addict who was robbed of her free will; that she was never motivated to quit 2 smoking at any point before her lung cancer 3 diagnosis in 1994. 4 your honor, i'm going to move into 5 something else. so it is 12:30 -- 6 the court: perfect time to break. 7 mr. geraghty: -- this might be a good 8 time to take the lunch break. 9 the court: all right. ladies and 10 gentlemen, we will take our luncheon recess 11 now. counsel, thank you. 12 i do apologize. i did not realize the 13 lunch was there, but it is sitting in front of 14 me. i get a text from my clerk that it is there 15 all the time. so i apologize for that. 16 just remember the admonition. you are not 17 to discuss the case. do not form any opinion 18 about the case. do not allow anyone to discuss 19 the case in your presence, certainly no 20 research. just leave your notepads on your 21 chairs. 22 before you go in, my thought is we would 23 like to continue. i do not know exactly how 24 much time you need to eat your lunch. 45 25 minutes, is that enough time for everybody? jurors: yes. [#deleted recess#] 2 mr. geraghty: thank you, your honor. 3 may it please the court again. 4 good afternoon, again, ladies and 5 gentlemen. i hope you all had a good lunch, 6 and i'm going to try to move along here and 7 move us through the afternoon and cover the 8 evidence you have heard. 9 now i told you we were going to walk 10 through all the significant events in virginia 11 varner's life, and we are going to do that right 12 now. and i'm going to remind you of what we 13 heard over the last two weeks. 14 and i just want to let you know at the 15 front end, this is the same exact timeline that 16 i showed you in my opening statement, exactly 17 the same. and i'm going to show you that 18 everything we told you in opening statement we 19 have now proved over the course of the last two 20 weeks. 21 so let me start at the beginning. you 22 know virginia varner was born on april the 23 22nd, 1941, in aiken, south carolina 24 security, tobacco country. we know that her 25 family had a farm back in south carolina, and they owned a general store where they sold 2 cigarettes. and that is basically all we really 3 know about her early years. 4 you know her parents are ralph and 5 gertrude woodward and that they are longtime 6 cigarette smokers themselves. 7 and that is important because both 8 dr. difranza and dr. ticknor told you that a 9 key predictor in whether someone will start 10 smoking if their parents smoked cigarettes. so 11 we know that her parents smoked cigarettes. 12 they moved to miami sometime in the early 13 to mid 1950s. we are not exactly sure when. 14 they moved down the street from joseph varner. 15 he begins to date his wife in 1957 or 1958. 16 and you heard mr. varner tell you that he 17 was smoking cigarettes, but he was hiding his 18 cigarette smoking from his parents because he 19 knew they would not approve. he knew during 20 this period of time that his wife was smoking, 21 but she also did not smoke cigarettes in front 22 of his mother or father. 23 so we do not know much about her cigarette 24 smoking at this point in time. what we do know 25 is they are smoking filtered cigarettes from the very beginning, filtered cigarettes. 2 in 1959, joseph and virginia varner get 3 married. you know that their children -- 4 joseph, jr., born in 1960; lisa roberts, 1961; 5 lori cohen, 1965. the family moves to 6 hollywood in about 1962. 7 now, you heard mr. schlesinger say that 8 the american public did not know that cigarette 9 smoking could cause cancer and could be 10 addictive. but after the evidence you heard, 11 you know that is simply not the case and 12 certainly not the case as far as virginia 13 varner is concerned. 14 remember dr. proctor testified. he told 15 you as far back as 1906 or 1907 that the 16 florida board of health had determined that 17 today cigarettes are looked upon by all as the 18 worst form of tobacco addiction, the very worst 19 form of tobacco addiction. that is in 1906, 20 1907. 21 you heard about "coffin nails" and 22 "cancer sticks" and "nicotine fiends" and 23 "nicotine fits." these were terms people used 24 to refer to cigarettes and cigarette smokers 25 over a hundred years ago. and mr. varner told you he heard the 2 terms "coffin nails" and "cancer sticks." he 3 understood exactly what those terms meant. he 4 heard the song smoke, smoke, smoke that 5 cigarette. he told you he was sure his wife 6 heard it as well. and they understood, even 7 though they were joking about it, that it meant 8 you can puff, puff, puff yourself to death. 9 you heard that in the 1930s and '40s and 10 '50s popular magazines like reader's digest 11 published articles about cigarette smoking. 12 and these are just some of examples that 13 we showed you from 1935, '38, '41, '52. and 14 these articles talked about the fact that 15 cigarettes cause cancer. 16 cigarettes have nicotine in them, and the 17 nicotine in cigarettes can be addictive, and 18 people can become addicted to smoking 19 cigarettes. that is in reader's digest magazine 20 in the 1930s, '40s and '50s. 21 as we move further along on the timeline 22 to the early 1950s, you heard that scientific 23 studies are published that specifically link 24 cigarette smoking with lung cancer. 25 and you will remember the article in life magazine. this is "smoke gets in the news" 2 from life magazine, december of 1953. 3 we walked through all those pictures with 4 dr. proctor. it says: doctors report tobacco 5 tar induces mouse cancer. note: rise in 6 cigarette use and human lung cancer. this is 7 1953. 8 and you also heard that six months after 9 this life magazine article comes out, there is 10 a poll conducted that shows that ninety percent of 11 the american public had read or heard something 12 to the effect that cigarette smoking may be a 13 cause of cancer of the lung. may be a cause of 14 cancer of the lung. 15 that is in june of 1954, when virginia 16 varner would have been 12 years old, just 12 17 years old. 18 now you heard that the publicity that 19 cigarette smoking causes lung cancer continues 20 to build throughout the 1950s and the 1960s, 21 and that brings us to january of 1964. 22 virginia varner is 22 years old, and in 23 january of 1964, the united states surgeon 24 general issues a report that says cigarette 25 smoking causes lung cancer. can you see the screen? is this blocking 2 the screen? let me move -- 3 juror: i can see. 4 mr. geraghty: okay. are you sure? 5 juror: i can see. i appreciate it. 6 mr. geraghty: okay. 7 the surgeon general in january 1964 says 8 cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, chronic 9 bronchitis and increases the risk of dying from 10 emphysema. 11 and you know that those studies, the 12 surgeon general's report, front-page news on 13 newspapers and magazines all across the united 14 states, including right here in broward county. 15 this is the hollywood sun tattler, the 16 paper that you heard lori cohen and lisa 17 roberts say that the varner family got in their 18 home. 19 this is friday, january 10th, 1964: 20 report to cite cigarette hazards. 21 virginia varner is 22 years old. 22 here is the very next day. same paper, 23 hollywood sun tattler: cigarettes major health 24 hazard. 25 this is the one i showed in my opening. this is from the florida sun-sentinel, january 2 12th, 1964: smoking called "grave" hazard. 3 grave hazard. 4 we showed you the broadcast from cbs news 5 and harry reasoner, so you know that every 6 american, including virginia varner, was told 7 in 1964 that cigarette smoking causes lung 8 cancer. and this is a key event in the 9 timeline. 10 remember what dr. proctor told you. 11 plaintiff's own expert, dr. proctor. he told 12 you the 1964 surgeon general's report was the 13 beginning of the end of cigarettes in this 14 country. the beginning of the end of 15 cigarettes. 16 he told you it was the turning point on 17 smoking rates. 18 and he told you it began an unprecedented 19 era of quitting smoking in this country. 20 you heard mr. schlesinger talk about 21 total cigarette consumption. well, dr. proctor 22 told you in 1964 adult per capita cigarette 23 consumption peaked in 1964, and it has been on 24 a steady decline ever since, in 1964. 25 so two years later, in 1966, the very first warning appears on cigarettes. it says: 2 caution, cigarette smoking may be hazardous to 3 your health. 4 here is the pack you saw in evidence 5 several times. it is a pack of marlboros with 6 that warning label on the side. 7 this warning was printed on every pack of 8 cigarettes sold in the united states beginning 9 in january of 1966 when virginia varner would 10 have been 24 years old. 24 years old. 11 and it appeared on every pack of 12 cigarettes sold. filtered, unfiltered, you 13 name it, that warning appeared on it. 14 mr. varner testified that he learned a 15 long time ago that cigarette smoking could 16 cause lung cancer, and he referred specifically 17 to this warning label as the source of why he 18 believed that. 19 he told you that he and his wife most 20 likely discussed this warning label all the way 21 back in 1966. 22 mr. schlesinger: objection, judge, not a 23 warning label. 24 the court: thank you. objection noted. 25 it is overruled. mr. geraghty: he said: i'm sure we 2 probably talked about it. it is just common 3 sense that if they put this on the pack of 4 cigarettes you are going to talk about it. 5 here's his testimony about the warning 6 label; and it is a little bit long, but let me 7 walk you through it. and i'm asking the 8 questions. 9 and it says: this is what you meant when 10 you referred to the fact that you had heard -- 11 and we are talking over one another. 12 he says, answer, "that it may cause --" 13 and i asked him: that cigarette smoking 14 may cause lung cancer, quote, a long time ago? 15 his answer is: yes. 16 so you knew this warning was on the pack 17 back in 1966? 18 his answer: yeah. 19 and a few minutes later, i asked him the 20 following question: the label on the screen 21 here, you remember that when you saw this 22 label, you associated in your mind that the 23 warning had something to do with lung cancer? 24 and he says: yes. 25 that is mr. varner's testimony that you heard right in this courtroom during the course 2 of the trial. 3 and remember now, ladies and gentlemen, 4 at this point in time, he and his wife are both 5 smoking marlboro red cigarettes. filtered 6 marlboro red cigarettes. 7 and all of this, ladies and gentlemen, 8 took place more than 50 years ago. more than 9 50 years ago. 10 let us go to the next page of the 11 timeline. and we are going to start below the 12 blue bar. i know it is a little tough for you 13 all to see it, but i'll try to walk you through 14 it. 15 in 1970, congress changes the warning 16 label. and the warning label as of 1970 says: 17 the surgeon general has determined that 18 cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health. 19 and here's, again, a pack of marlboro 20 cigarettes with that warning label that first 21 began to appear in 1970, right on the side of 22 the pack. 23 one year later in 1971, all cigarette ads 24 are taken off of television and radio here in 25 the united states. and in 1972, this surgeon general's 2 warning is required to appear on any cigarette 3 advertisement in a newspaper, a magazine, or on 4 a billboard. 5 now, mr. varner told you that he and his 6 wife did not really pay much attention to this 7 warning because, as he put it: it did not tell 8 them anything they did not already know. 9 it did not tell them anything they did not 10 already know. 11 and think about it, ladies and gentlemen. 12 you heard the evidence. during this period of 13 time, the late 1960s and early 1970s, there is 14 an incredible amount of information published 15 about the health risks of smoking. 16 you saw the public service announcements; 17 bill talman, john wayne. we talked about john 18 wayne. 19 you remember mr. varner's testimony about 20 john wayne. he referred to john wayne as one 21 of his heroes. and mr. varner told you he knew 22 that john wayne had been diagnosed with lung 23 cancer because he smoked cigarettes by the 24 early 1970s. he told you that. 25 and you saw the public service announcement that he gave. 2 now, the plaintiff has tried to tell you 3 that somehow all these warnings and health 4 messages were being drowned out by statements 5 made by cigarette companies. 6 but remember what even dr. proctor had to 7 admit. he told you that between 1974 when that 8 very first surgeon general's report came out 9 and 1979, 30 million americans quit smoking. 10 thirty million people quit smoking during 11 that 15-year period. 12 that is 2 million people every single 13 year. and this is during the same period of 14 time that you saw all those public statements 15 by the tobacco institute saying: we do not 16 know. maybe it does, maybe it does not. all 17 during that same period of time. 18 nevertheless, 30 million americans quit 19 smoking because of the same warnings and the 20 same health messages that joseph and virginia 21 varner received. 22 and remember again, this is during a 23 period of time, there is no nicotine 24 replacement therapy. there is no nicorette 25 gum, there is no nicotine patch, there is no zyban, there is no chantix. 2 but millions quit smoking cold turkey, 3 and they quit for good. and that is the 4 evidence you have heard over the course of the 5 last two weeks. 6 of course, ladies and gentlemen, the 7 evidence now shows mrs. varner received those 8 same warnings and health messages. 9 how do we know that? well, we know that 10 because you heard in the late 1970s or early 11 1980s, her mother, gertrude woodward, develops 12 emphysema. 13 and you now know that emphysema is a type 14 of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or 15 copd, that is caused by smoking cigarettes. 16 you heard the testimony from lori cohen 17 and lisa roberts. 18 so what all did you hear? you heard that 19 gertrude woodward was a heavy cigarette smoker; 20 that she was diagnosed with emphysema because 21 she smoked cigarettes; that she had serious 22 breathing problems. her condition got worse 23 and worse over the years. 24 lisa roberts told you that her 25 grandmother, her mother's mother, had to use a wheelchair, and eventually was bedridden 2 because of her emphysema. 3 and, most importantly, you heard that 4 virginia varner took care of her mother during 5 this period of time, took her to many of her 6 doctor's appointments for her emphysema. 7 gertrude woodward lived in the house next 8 door to mr. and mrs. varner during the period 9 of time when this all happens. 10 so, ladies and gentlemen, there is no 11 question based on the evidence you have heard 12 that virginia varner saw firsthand the serious 13 health problems that cigarette smoking could 14 cause in her own mother. 15 in fact, during the same period of time, 16 the early to mid 1980s, 1982 or 1983, you heard 17 virginia varner develops a smoker's wheeze and 18 cough. 19 she attributes the smoker's cough and 20 wheeze to her cigarette smoking. she goes to 21 see the doctors. 22 the doctors tell her: you are wheezing 23 and you are coughing because you smoke 24 cigarettes. 25 you heard all of that from lori cohen. here is what lori cohen told you when she 2 testified. 3 question: your mother told you that her 4 smoker's cough and her smoker's wheeze were 5 caused by cigarette smoking, right? 6 her answer: correct. 7 your mother told you that her doctors 8 told her that the wheeze and the cough were 9 caused by her cigarette smoking? 10 and her answer is: correct. 11 that is what you heard from lori cohen. 12 and, of course, you know virginia varner 13 appreciates the significance of what the 14 doctors told her. 15 at first, lori cohen tried to deny this, 16 but she eventually acknowledged that almost 17 every morning, her mother would cough and 18 wheeze and say: these cigarettes are killing 19 me. smoking is killing me. 20 here's the testimony. 21 "when do you first recall having a 22 discussion with your mother during which she 23 said something to the effect smoking is killing 24 me? 25 "my mother would say that every morning when she got up and coughed and could not 2 breathe." 3 that is undisputed testimony you have heard 4 in this case, ladies and gentlemen. 5 undisputed. 6 now, the plaintiff has suggested to you 7 that even though the doctors told her that the 8 cough and the wheeze were caused by smoking, 9 that somehow the doctors never told virginia 10 varner that she should quit smoking. 11 but just think about that for one minute. 12 judge murphy has instructed you that you 13 can draw reasonable inferences from the 14 evidence and use reason and common sense and 15 your everyday life experiences. 16 what was the evidence you heard? you 17 heard from three medical doctors: dr. gup, 18 dr. difranza, dr. ticknor. all of them have 19 been practicing medicine since the late 1970s. 20 and what did they tell you? 21 all three of them told you they tell 22 every one of their patients to quit smoking. 23 they tell their patients to quit smoking, 24 because when you quit, your risk of developing 25 lung cancer and copd goes down, even if you have been smoking for many years. 2 the sooner you quit, the better your 3 chances are of avoiding a smoking-related 4 illness. 5 so, ladies and gentlemen, your common 6 sense and your everyday life experiences and 7 the evidence you have heard in this case tells 8 you, of course the doctors told virginia varner 9 to quit. 10 but we know that virginia varner did not 11 listen to her doctors. even lori cohen 12 admitted to you, her mother did not try to quit 13 smoking when the doctors told her the smoker's 14 cough and wheeze were caused by smoking. 15 and based on the testimony you have heard 16 in this case, if ms. varner had followed her 17 doctor's advice, she likely never would have 18 developed lung cancer, and we would not be here 19 today. 20 now, in 1985 -- we move forward, we are 21 below the blue bar here -- the warning labels 22 on cigarette packs change again. 23 one of the warnings says: surgeon 24 general's warning. smoking causes lung cancer, 25 heart disease, emphysema and may complicate pregnancy. 2 that is what the warning label said. 3 again, joseph varner told you he and his 4 wife did not pay attention to this warning, 5 because it did not tell them anything they 6 had not already known for years at this point in 7 time. 8 so what did mrs. varner do with all this 9 information? what does the evidence show? 10 well, plaintiff's own experts tell you 11 the most important factor that determines 12 whether someone will quit is motivation. are 13 you motivated to quit. 14 dr. ticknor told you the same thing. 15 simply put, unless you really want to quit, 16 unless you really try to quit, you are not going 17 to quit. 18 and the evidence in this case shows that 19 virginia and joseph varner enjoyed smoking 20 cigarettes. and for many years, they simply 21 had no interest in quitting. 22 ms. varner enjoyed smoking marlboro red 23 cigarettes. she enjoyed the taste of marlboro 24 red. you heard she liked to double inhale. 25 she taught her husband how to double inhale. she enjoyed smoking when she drank coffee 2 in the morning, when she socialized with her 3 girlfriends, after meals, when she drank 4 alcohol, when her and her husband would retire 5 to their bedroom and watch television in the 6 evening. 7 now, joseph varner, right here on the 8 witness stand, denied that his wife enjoyed 9 smoking cigarettes. that is what he did. 10 he told you he knew she was addicted. he 11 knew she was addicted, but he did not think she 12 enjoyed smoking. he refused to admit that his 13 wife, with whom he had spent 35 years together, 14 enjoyed smoking. 15 mr. schlesinger: objection, judge. what 16 he admits. it is attacking the prosecution of 17 the case, what he refused to admit. 18 the court: i sustain the objection. 19 mr. geraghty: he denied on the witness 20 stand that his wife enjoyed smoking cigarettes, 21 his wife with whom he had lived for 35 years. 22 that is why we talked about all of the 23 things that he and his wife enjoyed doing 24 together. 25 remember, he told you about the motorcycle club? what did he tell you? he 2 told you his wife and he would ride on his 3 motorcycle, go to the club, socialize with 4 friends, shoot pool, drink beer, dance, and 5 smoke cigarettes. 6 and he told you that they enjoyed doing 7 every single one of those things all the time, 8 except smoke cigarettes. that is what he told 9 you. 10 but, of course, they did. who would not, 11 ladies and gentlemen? these are all activities 12 that your common sense and everyday life 13 experience tells you people enjoy doing. 14 but mr. varner denied that his wife 15 enjoyed smoking cigarettes while doing many of 16 these things. he is one hundred percent confident she is 17 addicted, but he does not know whether she 18 enjoyed smoking. 19 and that is why, ladies and gentlemen, we 20 asked him all those questions. 21 because the truth is and the evidence 22 shows you cannot live with someone for almost 35 23 years and not know what they enjoy, what they 24 love to do. that is what being in a 25 relationship is all about. and, of course, lori cohen and lisa 2 roberts, her two daughters, what did they tell 3 you? they said of course their mother enjoyed 4 smoking cigarettes, and they gave you many 5 examples. 6 so how do you square the evidence you 7 heard about virginia varner from her two 8 daughters with the testimony that her husband 9 gave? 10 it is very simple. he said all those 11 things on the witness stand after he is filed a 12 lawsuit in which he is now asked you to award 13 him -- 14 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor. 15 the court: your objection is noted. 16 overruled. 17 mr. geraghty: he said all of those 18 things to you on the witness stand under oath 19 after he is filed a lawsuit in which he is now 20 asked you, ladies and gentlemen, to award him 21 $10 million. 22 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor, 23 that attacks the prosecution of this case. 24 the court: thank you. 25 no speaking objections. if you want to approach, i'm more than happy to do it. 2 mr. schlesinger: yes, i do. 3 (the following discussion was held at 4 sidebar:) 5 the court: you do not think that goes to 6 bias and motivation? 7 mr. schlesinger: may it please the 8 court. i think that -- 9 the court: you do not believe it goes to 10 bias? that is my question. 11 mr. schlesinger: the money goes to bias 12 and motivation, but the way he said it was that 13 he is attacking his right to file a lawsuit. 14 you can say does he have an interest in 15 getting money. 16 they completely have turned the idea of 17 what you can talk about on its head and say 18 anytime we say anything, we are attacking the 19 defense. 20 he has every right to file a lawsuit. 21 they are attacking his right to file a lawsuit. 22 they can say he is asking for money 23 damages. you can consider his bias and 24 motivation because he is seeking a monetary 25 award. but they say because he had filed a 2 lawsuit claiming money damages. he has an 3 absolute right to do that. for them to attack 4 that is directly on point with what they 5 vociferously say we did. 6 so in this situation, that was the 7 directly improper wording of it. that is the 8 directly improper wording of it. 9 he can spin this case, he is seeking 10 money. he can say you can consider that with 11 his credibility, bias, because he seeks money. 12 but you cannot say that after he filed a 13 lawsuit, because you are attacking his right to 14 file a lawsuit. 15 the court: thank you. 16 wish to be heard? 17 mr. geraghty: no, sir. 18 the court: objection is overruled. 19 you said you wanted to know when an hour 20 was coming up. you have an hour and ten 21 minutes, approximately. 22 mr. geraghty: i have an hour and ten? 23 oh, i'm at an hour and ten? 24 the court: you will be at an hour in ten 25 minutes. i misspoke. i'm sorry. (sidebar discussion concluded, and the 2 following was held in open court:) 3 the court: counsel, when you are ready, 4 you may proceed. 5 mr. geraghty: thank you, your honor. 6 that raises the question, did virginia 7 varner make any serious effort to quit smoking 8 before she was diagnosed with lung cancer in 9 1994? 10 now, after two weeks together, you 11 have not heard any credible or reliable evidence 12 to support that. 13 in fact, the overwhelming evidence you have 14 heard demonstrates that she never made any 15 effort to quit before her lung cancer 16 diagnosis. 17 first, you heard from joey varner, who he 18 told -- he told you: i think my mother said 19 she wanted to quit smoking. 20 but he admitted he does not recall her 21 ever making any effort to quit smoking at all. 22 at any point in time. 23 you heard from lisa roberts. lisa 24 roberts told you flat out: my mother never 25 said she wanted to quit smoking, and i never observed her ever try to quit at any point in 2 time, until she had lung cancer in 1994. 3 and mr. varner reluctantly agreed to the 4 same thing. 5 the only one who claims her mother tried 6 to quit smoking a couple of times was lori 7 cohen. 8 and she told you her mother, after 9 stopping cigarettes for a couple of hours, 10 acted like a heroin addict coming off of 11 heroin. that is what she told you. 12 think about that, ladies and gentlemen. 13 do not you think that if there was any truth to 14 what lori cohen told you about that, someone 15 else in the family would have observed that, 16 remembered it, and told you the same thing here 17 in this courtroom? 18 after all, everyone said that they 19 basically saw virginia varner every single day. 20 mr. varner, his son joseph varner, lisa 21 roberts. 22 lori cohen's testimony simply does not 23 square with everything else you now know about 24 how virginia varner lived her life. 25 to understand ms. varner's attitude about cigarette smoking, all you have to do is look 2 at what happened when her husband had the heart 3 attack in 1992. 4 and that is right here. 5 you may recall i told you i was not sure 6 if the evidence would show it was '89 or '92. 7 but mr. varner told you, in 1992 that he 8 had a heart attack, he was rushed to the 9 emergency room. the doctors told him: if you 10 do not quit, you are going to have another heart 11 attack and die, and he quit smoking cold turkey 12 right there on the spot. 13 that is what he told you. 14 and then he said for the very first time 15 in his life, the very first time in their 16 marriage in 1992, he first encouraged his wife 17 to quit smoking. that is what he told you. 18 and this is what his testimony was about 19 that. 20 question: now, at the time that you had 21 the heart attack and you quit in 1992, you told 22 your wife, virginia varner, that she should 23 quit smoking too? 24 his answer: yes. 25 and you looked right at her and you told her: do not smoke cigarettes? 2 answer: yes. 3 you told her: smoking will kill you, 4 right? 5 his answer: yes. 6 and she kind of joked in response and 7 said: well, i'm going to die anyway. 8 his answer: yes. 9 that is the undisputed testimony of 10 joseph varner in this case. that is what he 11 told you. 12 and, frankly, this response tells you 13 everything you need to know about virginia 14 varner's feelings about cigarette smoking. 15 mr. schlesinger told you 1992 was not an 16 important date. it is the key date. because 17 here we are, she smoked cigarettes at this 18 point for the better part of 35 years. 19 she is watched her mother develop 20 emphysema. she is watched her husband have a 21 heart attack. and what is her attitude? i'm 22 going to die anyway. 23 and it was not some fatalistic comment. 24 he told you, she joked. 25 so if this is what she thinks about cigarette smoking in 1992, after all of that, 2 what makes you think that at any point in time 3 prior to this date she ever really had any 4 interest in quitting? 5 there is zero evidence of that in the 6 record. 7 this is the most specific statement any 8 of her family members have told us about her 9 true attitude about cigarette smoking. 10 and the plaintiff says it is not 11 important. 12 well, at the end of the day, ladies and 13 gentlemen, you get to decide what evidence is 14 important. 15 but what you also heard, what you also 16 heard is that virginia varner does make a 17 significant change in her behavior. 18 she stops smoking around her husband in 19 1992 when he quits. 20 and everyone told you this, ladies and 21 gentlemen. everyone. there is absolutely no 22 dispute about this. joseph varner himself, 23 lori cohen, lisa roberts. 24 think about the significance of that. 25 this is after they have been married for 35 years, during which they smoked around one 2 another every single day. 3 in the morning with coffee, after meals, 4 in the evenings, when they are at the motorcycle 5 club. they used to smoke together every single 6 night in their bedroom watching the local news 7 or the johnny carson show. mr. varner said it 8 was a ritual. 9 but in 1992, when it is important to her 10 because her husband no longer smokes, ms. 11 varner controls where, when, and how much she 12 smokes, because it is important to her husband. 13 and the fact that ms. varner could 14 control where and when she smoked is important, 15 because you heard if you can control your use 16 of a substance, then you are not addicted. 17 and when it was important, when it 18 mattered to her, virginia varner controlled her 19 smoking. that is the undisputed evidence in the 20 case. 21 that brings us to 1994. you have already 22 heard all this. you know that she has -- she 23 coughs up blood. she goes to see the doctor. 24 dr. gup tells her that she probably has lung 25 cancer. they have a bronchoscopy that confirms 2 that diagnosis. and she is scheduled to have 3 exploratory surgery to determine whether the 4 cancer can be removed and she can be cured. 5 and about two weeks before that surgery, 6 virginia varner quits smoking. 7 and this is that record. this record is 8 in evidence. you have seen it a couple times 9 already. 10 but this is the record where on august 11 the 18th, she tells the anesthesiologist who 12 is going to be part of the surgical procedure: 13 i quit smoking two weeks ago. 14 that is what the record shows. 15 now, you know that on august the 22nd, 16 they have the surgery. and, unfortunately, the 17 doctors determined that the cancer was 18 inoperable; meaning, it cannot be removed, and 19 there is no cure. 20 and the doctors tell ms. varner and her 21 family that she only has six months left to 22 live. and, unfortunately, you heard that she 23 passes away in january of 1995. 24 now, you heard that virginia varner quit 25 smoking a few weeks before the surgery. everyone agreed that she quit smoking in august 2 of 1994. joseph varner, sr., joseph varner, 3 jr., lisa roberts. they all told you they 4 never saw virginia varner smoke another 5 cigarette again after this diagnosis. 6 lori cohen told you that after her mother 7 learned that her condition was terminal and 8 there was no cure, that she would give her 9 mother one or two cigarettes each day in those 10 last couple of months. 11 but even if you accept ms. cohen's 12 testimony on this point, all of the experts 13 told you that this was an incredibly 14 significant change in virginia varner's smoking 15 behavior. 16 to go from smoking one to two packs of 17 cigarettes a day to no cigarettes, to one to 18 two cigarettes per day, particularly in light 19 of what she was dealing with, is a significant 20 change in her smoking behavior. 21 so there will be no question that 22 virginia varner had the willpower when she 23 decided to apply it to control her smoking and 24 to quit smoking when she was motivated to do 25 so. now, real briefly, you heard that 2 mr. varner begins to date about a year after 3 his wife died. you heard that he met a woman 4 named regina brown. she moved in with him, and 5 that relationship lasted about six months. 6 and not long thereafter, in 1996, he 7 meets monique varner. they start a 8 relationship. monique moves in with mr. varner 9 shortly thereafter. they have a daughter named 10 brianna, who is born in 2002, a few years 11 later, and they get married in 2007. 12 and you heard that they continued to live 13 together for the next seven or eight years, 14 until late 2014 or 2015, when they apparently 15 got separated. 16 and that, ladies and gentlemen, is the 17 story that we have all seen and heard in this 18 courtroom over the last two weeks. that is the 19 evidence. 20 now, ladies and gentlemen, with the time 21 i have remaining, i want to switch gears with 22 you, which i like to do. 23 i told you that this case was about two 24 words: control and responsibility. 25 and even though that is what this case is all about, you will not see those two specific 2 words on the verdict form. 3 so with the time i have left, i'd like to 4 talk to you about the questions you will have 5 to answer on the verdict form. 6 the court: thirty minutes, counsel. 7 mr. geraghty: thank you, your honor. 8 so here is the very first question, the 9 class membership question you are going to be 10 asked to decide. 11 was virginia varner addicted to 12 cigarettes containing nicotine? and if so, was 13 such addiction a legal cause of her lung cancer 14 or her copd? 15 and i told you in the opening statement 16 you could break this question down into really 17 two pieces. 18 the first part is, was she addicted; and 19 if so, number 2, was her claimed addiction a 20 legal cause of her lung cancer and death or 21 copd. 22 if you answer "no" to this question, 23 that is a verdict for philip morris. 24 if you were to answer "yes" to this 25 question, that means you have decided to award some money damages to joseph varner. 2 keep in mind that the plaintiff bears the 3 burden of proof on this question by the greater 4 weight of the evidence. 5 so the first part of the question asks: 6 was virginia varner addicted to cigarettes? 7 was she addicted to cigarettes? 8 in the instructions you have been given, 9 the court did not give you a definition of 10 addiction or a set of criteria to use to 11 determine whether someone is addicted. 12 so what is the evidence you have heard? 13 well, plaintiff brought you dr. gup 14 first. and dr. gup is the pulmonologist, the 15 lung doctor who saw mrs. varner 22 years ago in 16 1994. 17 and because it was more than 20 years 18 ago, he told you he does not remember anything 19 about his care and treatment of virginia 20 varner, but he acknowledged that when he first 21 saw her on july the 21st, it was a very busy 22 clinic. 23 he was in a hurry, and he did not have the 24 ability to spend much time with her. he told 25 you all those things. during that first visit when he wrote 2 down his impression "tobacco addiction," 3 dr. gup admitted that the only thing he knew 4 about virginia varner's smoking history was 5 that she had smoked two packs a day for 6 40 years and she had cut down to about one pack 7 per day in the month before he saw her. he 8 told you that is all he knew about her smoking 9 history. 10 and from his perspective, that is all he 11 needed to know. he said: as far as i was 12 concerned, that meant she was addicted. 13 he also told you that he did nothing 14 further to confirm his impression. why is that 15 important? well, remember what he also told 16 you. when he suspected that she had lung 17 cancer he ordered a follow-up test, the 18 bronchoscopy, to confirm that she did, in fact, 19 have lung cancer. 20 when he suspected that she had copd, he 21 ordered another follow-up test, the pulmonary 22 function test. but after he wrote "tobacco 23 addiction" in his note, he did nothing further 24 to confirm that, even though he said it was 25 intended to be a medical diagnosis. dr. gup did not even know that virginia 2 varner had quit smoking about two weeks before 3 the surgery. told you he did not know that. 4 and finally, he told you that virginia 5 varner was not unique among his patients. he 6 says he writes down the impression "tobacco 7 addiction" in literally thousands of his 8 patient's charts. that is what he told you. 9 simply put, saying she was addicted was 10 not meaningful to his care and treatment. he 11 told you: i would have treated her exactly the 12 same whether or not i wrote down tobacco 13 addiction. 14 you then heard from dr. difranza. he was 15 from the university of massachusetts. he was 16 the very nice professorial doctor. but, ladies 17 and gentlemen, he is just not a specialist in 18 addiction. 19 he is a family doctor who told you he 20 treats whatever comes through the front door of 21 his office, from young children to the elderly, 22 for sinus infections, colds, the flu. he 23 does not treat people for nicotine addiction. 24 he has no practical experience diagnosing 25 or treating people who are using addictive substances, including cigarettes. 2 he is never been involved in working in a 3 smoking cessation clinic. 4 sometimes the lawyers actually ask 5 questions that are as revealing as the answer 6 the witness gives, and you may recall that 7 dr. difranza was asked whether or not he just 8 works in an "ivory tower." that was the term 9 that was used. 10 now dr. difranza tried to say, no, he 11 does not, but the rest of the testimony 12 demonstrates that is exactly what he does when 13 it comes to nicotine and cigarettes. 14 he told you that if a patient comes to 15 his office with a real addiction problem, guess 16 who he refers them to? a clinical psychiatrist 17 in the psychiatry department at the university 18 of massachusetts, a doctor just like 19 dr. christopher ticknor. 20 when it comes to cigarettes, dr. difranza 21 is an academic. he told you he actually goes 22 upstairs to his office and does research and 23 writing on his computer about nicotine, the 24 so-called "ivory tower." 25 he does not have any real-world practical experience when it comes to diagnosing someone 2 as addicted, let alone diagnosing them as 3 addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes. 4 and he candidly acknowledged that. 5 he told you ms. varner was addicted, and 6 he talked about different tests and different 7 criteria that he used. but did you ever hear 8 him explain the criteria that he applied to 9 virginia varner and how she satisfied that 10 criteria? he never explained any of that to 11 you. 12 and that is because, ladies and gentlemen, 13 in every single case he is testified, he is told 14 you the cigarette smoker is addicted. he 15 believes all cigarette smokers are addicted. 16 if you smoke one cigarette per day, you are 17 addicted, according to him. in fact, he said, 18 you smoke one cigarette a month and you are 19 probably addicted. that is his standard. 20 that is his criteria. 21 think about that, ladies and gentlemen. 22 if someone drinks a glass of wine every day or 23 even a couple of glasses of wine on the 24 weekend, are they an alcoholic? but that is 25 essentially what dr. difranza told you. if you believe what he said, everyone is 2 addicted to something, whether it is cigarettes, 3 alcohol, shopping, you name it. he had no 4 standard whatsoever. 5 he determined that virginia varner was 6 addicted based on a telephone conversation that 7 he had with joseph varner. and he had that 8 conversation with mr. varner and determined 9 that she was addicted without reading any of 10 her medical records, without reading any of the 11 depositions that her family members had given 12 in this case. 13 he had reached that conclusion after the 14 phone conversation with mr. varner even though 15 he admitted to you that mr. varner told him: i 16 cannot recall any instance in which my wife ever 17 tried to quit smoking, in all the years we were 18 married. he agreed with that twice during the 19 course of his testimony. 20 so ask yourselves, ladies and gentlemen, 21 is that how we diagnose people in this country 22 with a serious mental disorder? of course not. 23 your common sense tells you of course not. 24 the evidence we have presented 25 demonstrates that virginia varner was not addicted. 2 we brought you dr. ticknor, a medical 3 doctor and board-certified psychiatrist. he 4 told you he is diagnosed and treated thousands 5 of patients with addictions to a whole variety 6 of addictive substances, including cigarettes. 7 he is evaluated, interviewed, diagnosed and 8 helped thousands of cigarette smokers quit in 9 the course of his career. 10 unlike dr. difranza, he sees patients on 11 a weekly basis who have substance abuse and 12 addiction problems. he evaluates them, 13 determines whether they are addicted, and he 14 helps them stop using those substances. 15 people come to him specifically for help 16 in quitting smoking. he ran a smoking 17 cessation clinic for eight years. 18 he told you that addiction is, in fact, a 19 medical diagnosis, and we just do not cavalierly 20 label millions of people as addicts simply 21 because they smoke a certain number of 22 cigarettes. 23 he applied the same criteria to virginia 24 varner that he is used to diagnose thousands of 25 patients as potentially addicted to a whole variety of substances: heroin, alcohol, 2 cocaine and cigarettes. 3 this is the same criteria he told you is 4 used to teach medical students and young 5 residents -- 6 mr. schlesinger: objection. 7 the court: what is the objection, 8 counsel? 9 mr. schlesinger: sidebar, judge. [#deleted sidebar#] 19 the court: when you are ready, you may 20 proceed. 21 mr. geraghty: thank you, your honor. 22 dr. ticknor applied the same criteria in 23 his analysis of virginia varner that he told 24 you he uses to teach medical students and young 25 residents how to diagnose addiction and treat persons with substance abuse problems. 2 he read all of the medical records, he 3 reviewed all of the deposition testimony in 4 this case before he arrived at his diagnosis 5 about virginia varner. 6 he provided you with medical criteria he 7 used to determine whether mrs. varner was 8 addicted. he explained it all to you in great 9 detail on friday. he told you virginia varner 10 was not addicted to cigarettes. 11 he told you that addiction requires 12 something called "clinically significant 13 impairment," which simply stated means did the 14 person lose control in an important aspect of 15 their life because of the use of the substance? 16 he told you there was no evidence of 17 that, and you know that is the case. ms. varner 18 never failed in her role as a mother or a wife. 19 she never let smoking interfere with any of her 20 duties or obligations. 21 smoking did not control mrs. varner. to 22 the contrary, she controlled her smoking when 23 her husband quit in 1992 and when she quit cold 24 turkey in august of 1994. 25 so at the end of the day you have to ask yourself whether the plaintiff's evidence is 2 sufficient or whether something more should be 3 required like tangible, reliable evidence. 4 based on the evidence you have heard, the 5 answer should be clear. mrs. varner was not 6 some hopeless addict or some tortured smoker; 7 she was a hard-working, intelligent, and 8 capable person who made her own decisions in 9 life. 10 your answer to the first question -- i'll 11 go back here -- oops. the answer to the first 12 question should be "no." 13 but even, ladies and gentlemen, even if 14 you were to answer the first part of the 15 question "yes" and find that she is addicted, 16 your work is just beginning because the 17 plaintiff still has to prove the second part of 18 the question. 19 the plaintiff still bears the burden to 20 prove by the greater weight of the evidence 21 that ms. varner's claimed addiction was a legal 22 cause of her lung cancer and death or copd. 23 now the court gave you an instruction for 24 legal cause, and the language of that 25 instruction can be a little bit hard to follow. so let me give you a thought to help you 2 explain this concept of legal cause. 3 imagine, if you will, ladies and 4 gentlemen, someone walks across the street and 5 they get hit by a bus. well, the bus is the 6 medical cause of why they were injured. but to 7 determine legal cause, you would need to know 8 more than that. 9 mr. schlesinger: objection, judge. 10 the court: overruled. 11 mr. geraghty: you would need to know, 12 for example, did the person cross the street 13 when she had the right-of-way? was the light 14 green or red when she crossed the street? was 15 she paying attention or was she texting on her 16 phone or listening to music? 17 did the person cross the street knowing 18 that that bus was going to be there every 19 single day? 20 those are things you would need to know 21 in order to understand legal cause. 22 and the question of legal cause boils 23 down to quitting, quitting smoking and 24 motivation to quit smoking. 25 ask yourself, based on the evidence you have heard, was ms. varner's claimed 2 addiction so strong, so substantial that it 3 prevented her from quitting when she was truly 4 motivated to do so? 5 the truth is and the evidence has shown 6 ms. varner was not motivated to quit smoking 7 before she was diagnosed with lung cancer in 8 1994. 9 if ms. varner did not make any effort to 10 quit smoking until then, ask yourselves how can 11 addiction be a legal cause of her cancer and 12 death? 13 what better evidence can there be that 14 she was not motivated to quit than the fact 15 that she made no real effort to do so until 16 after her cancer diagnosis? 17 other than lori cohen, no one came into 18 this courtroom and told you that mrs. varner 19 ever tried to stop smoking before 1994. how 20 can the plaintiff maintain that ms. varner's 21 so-called addiction prevented her from quitting 22 when she never really tried before july of 23 1994? 24 rather, it was ms. varner's decision to 25 smoke cigarettes long after she knew the dangers and her decision not to make a 2 motivated effort to quit until 1994 that was 3 the one and only legal cause of her cancer and 4 death in this case. 5 only the smoker can make the decision and 6 ultimately the effort to quit, even 7 dr. difranza told you that. 8 this is his testimony. 9 and the choice to attempt to quit smoking 10 is one hundred percent within the smoker's control, 11 correct? 12 dr. difranza's answer is: yes. 13 the truth is and the evidence shows that 14 mrs. varner enjoyed smoking cigarettes. that is 15 what she wanted to do. and she was not really 16 interested in quitting until 1994, when she was 17 diagnosed with lung cancer. 18 think about it for just a second. 19 mr. varner and his lawyers are trying to 20 persuade you that mrs. varner -- 21 mr. schlesinger: objection, judge. 22 the court: sustained. 23 mr. schlesinger: move to strike. 24 the court: jury disregard. 25 mr. geraghty: the plaintiff is trying to persuade you that mrs. varner really wanted to 2 quit. she desperately wanted to quit. but 3 what did she tell her own husband in 1992, when 4 he had his heart attack and he encouraged her 5 to quit? this is what she told him, after 35 6 years of smoking cigarettes. 7 to answer this first question, all you 8 really need to do is listen to what 9 dr. difranza told you. whether you are addicted 10 or not, dr. difranza told you 60 million 11 americans have quit smoking. most of those 12 60 million americans would be considered 13 addicted according to his criteria. 14 nevertheless, most of those people quit smoking 15 cold turkey, meaning without any assistance 16 whatsoever. 17 just like dr. ticknor told you, the 18 nicotine in cigarettes did not prevent these 19 60 million people from understanding that 20 cigarette smoking is dangerous and from 21 exercising their free will to stop. 22 and during the past two weeks you have 23 heard no evidence that virginia varner was any 24 different. she was not some hopeless addict who 25 lost her free will. she was hard-working, intelligent, capable. her husband told you 2 that. 3 the court: ten minutes, counsel. 4 mr. geraghty: she received many warnings 5 over the years; and she smoked in the face of 6 those warnings, and she had every right to make 7 that choice. but it was her informed decision 8 to smoke for many years that was the one and 9 only legal cause of her lung cancer and copd. 10 so after hearing all the evidence, ladies 11 and gentlemen, your answer to this question 12 should be "no." your answer to this question 13 should be "no." 14 i'm going to zoom ahead now. 15 okay. i do not think you are going to get 16 this far on the verdict form, but -- 17 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor, 18 personal belief of counsel, move to strike. 19 the court: jury is to disregard the last 20 comments, sustained. 21 mr. geraghty: if you get past 22 question 1, question 2 is a question that 23 relates only to r.j. reynolds. i'm going to 24 let mr. keehfus talk about it. 25 i do not think -- well, let me just read question number 3. it is a little bit wordy. 2 it says: please state as to each defendant 3 whether virginia varner reasonably relied to 4 her detriment on any statement made by that 5 defendant which concealed or omitted material 6 information not already known or available to 7 her concerning the health effects and/or 8 addictive nature of smoking cigarettes, and if 9 so, whether such reliance was a legal cause of 10 virginia varner's death. 11 i mean, that is a mouthful, right? 12 the fourth question is very similar 13 except it broadens it to include other 14 cigarette companies. 15 so here's what you need to focus on. 16 instruction number 10 tells you what 17 "detrimental reliance" is. 18 the plaintiff must prove as to each 19 defendant that, but for virginia varner's 20 reliance on a statement by that defendant 21 concealing or omitting a material fact not 22 otherwise known or available, she would have 23 acted differently and avoided her injuries. 24 that is the instruction you will have in the 25 packet from the court. so what is the evidence that you heard? 2 you know what mr. varner told you about 3 this. we asked him these questions 4 point-blank: your wife never told you that she 5 had ever saw or read or heard a statement about 6 cigarette smoking and health made by for 7 example, philip morris? 8 his answer was: no. 9 he gave the same answer about 10 r.j. reynolds. 11 i asked him about the tobacco institute, 12 the council for tobacco research, the tobacco 13 industry research committee. said he had never 14 heard of those organizations, and he never had 15 a conversation with his wife about any 16 statements they ever made. 17 i even asked him point-blank: your wife 18 never told you that she relied upon any 19 statements made by any tobacco company? 20 she relied on it? he asked me. 21 i said: yeah. 22 his answer was: no. 23 that is his testimony under oath. 24 now -- so what did the plaintiff tell 25 you? you heard lori cohen tell you this story about how she and her mother were looking at a 2 coffee can filled with cigarette butts filled 3 with rain water, and that made them think that 4 filtered cigarettes were somehow safe because 5 they were taking out some of the, quote, "bad 6 stuff." 7 she went on to say that that is -- some of 8 that stuff's got to be going into your lungs. 9 and her mother said: i do not know, i guess. 10 ladies and gentlemen, i would ask that 11 you use your common sense when you evaluate 12 whether that testimony and that evidence is 13 remotely credible. does that story make sense? 14 well, it certainly does not make any sense when 15 you consider what lori cohen admitted on 16 cross-examination. 17 this is what she admitted. 18 so the smoke from the cigarette passes 19 through the filter, goes into your lungs, and 20 that is what you were saying to your mother when 21 you said: hey, this brown gook or guck, or 22 whatever it is, is getting into your lungs? 23 lori cohen said: yes. 24 then we asked her: is not it true that 25 you do not remember whether your mother agreed or disagreed with what you told her about 2 filtered cigarettes? 3 she did not -- she never -- she never 4 said. and she agreed with that same question a 5 second time. that is what lori cohen told you. 6 but more importantly, ladies and 7 gentlemen, just remember the sequence of 8 events. at the time this conversation 9 allegedly took place in the early 1980s, 10 gertrude woodward had already been diagnosed 11 with emphysema from smoking filtered 12 cigarettes. 13 virginia varner had been smoking filtered 14 marlboro cigarettes since the 1950s, her 15 doctors told her she had a smoker's cough and 16 wheeze from smoking filtered cigarettes. 17 she told lori many times: these 18 cigarettes are killing me. meaning "these 19 filtered cigarettes are killing me." 20 and finally, remember, every single pack 21 of cigarettes she and her husband smoked, these 22 filtered cigarettes, had the surgeon general's 23 warning right on them. 24 "the surgeon general has determined that 25 cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health." ask yourself whether lori cohen's story 2 makes any sense. 3 in light of all the evidence you have 4 heard, it just does not add up. 5 let me highlight one instruction real 6 briefly. it is instruction number 16. i did not 7 put it up on the screen. there we -- it is not 8 on the screen, but let me just -- it is 9 instruction number 16. 10 the judge has already instructed you, but 11 take a look at it. it says: as long as 12 cigarette packs bear the federally mandated 13 warnings, cigarette advertising after july 1, 14 1969, cannot be the subject -- cannot be the 15 subject of any claim that the advertising 16 undermined or neutralized the warnings or made 17 them less effective. 18 you will have the opportunity to read that 19 instruction when you go back. when you go back 20 and read that instruction and you consider the 21 evidence that i've just reviewed on this 22 so-called story about filtered cigarettes, 23 you will see that the plaintiff simply cannot meet 24 his burden of proof that his wife relied on any 25 kind of statement made by any cigarette company. 2 ladies and gentlemen, the bottom line is, 3 virginia varner never saw, heard, or read a 4 single statement made by philip morris, 5 r.j. reynolds or any tobacco company. but 6 that is what the plaintiff's burden is to prove 7 to you. 8 your answer to question 3 and 4 should be 9 "no." 10 so let me quickly move on to question 11 number 5 and 6. 12 again, i need to respond because 13 mr. schlesinger talked about it. question 5 14 is: was there fault on the part of virginia 15 varner which was a legal cause of her death? 16 and then you are asked to state the percentage. 17 so what does it mean to accept 18 responsibility for the decisions that one makes 19 in life? 20 the evidence you have heard is clear that 21 virginia varner knew smoking was dangerous and 22 addictive for many decades. she never took any 23 steps to quit until july or august of 1994. 24 you heard mr. varner say that he believes 25 his wife -- oops, i screwed that up -- let me -- okay. we may have taken that out. 2 mr. varner told you that he believed his 3 wife could have quit smoking if she had tried 4 earlier than 1994. he told you that. he told 5 you that. 6 so when you get to this issue of 7 responsibility, ask yourselves: if someone 8 never makes any effort to quit at any point in 9 time until after they have lung cancer, who is 10 responsible for that decision? 11 dr. difranza told you that the smoker is 12 one hundred percent responsible for the decision and 13 the choice to try to quit. the answer to the 14 question ought to be simple, ladies and 15 gentlemen. virginia varner is one hundred percent 16 responsible. 17 here's that testimony from her husband: 18 do you think your wife had the ability to quit 19 smoking or at least try to quit before she did 20 in 1994? and he agreed. 21 now let me move on to the damages. i 22 do not think you will get this far on the verdict 23 form -- 24 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor. 25 the court: sustained. mr. geraghty: you heard mr. schlesinger 2 ask you to award a total of $10 million in 3 damages to mr. varner for the decisions that 4 virginia varner and only virginia varner made 5 to smoke cigarettes. that is an incredible sum 6 of money. 7 ask yourself how did the plaintiff come 8 up with that number? that would be no 9 different than if i suggested $100,000. 10 the plaintiff has the burden of proof on 11 damages. he has to burden to prove every 12 single dollar in damages that mr. schlesinger 13 asked for, and he has to burden to prove that 14 with evidence, not argument. 15 judge murphy has already instructed you 16 that is the law. 17 is there any evidence to support the 18 plaintiff's number? of course not. that 19 number, ladies and gentlemen, was essentially 20 pulled out of thin air. 21 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor. 22 the court: sustained. 23 mr. schlesinger: move to strike. 24 the court: jurors disregard the last 25 comment. mr. geraghty: the arguments of the 2 lawyers are not evidence. there needs to be 3 evidence to support every single dollar in 4 damages. 5 so where is the evidence to justify such 6 a huge amount based on what you heard during 7 this trial? knowing the plaintiff has the 8 burden of proof? 9 you have not heard any. how do you even 10 get to $1 million, let alone $10 million? 11 in a case like this, that number defies 12 common sense. we are talking about a case in 13 which every pack of cigarettes virginia varner 14 smoked had a government-mandated warning since 15 1966, that she and her husband discussed when 16 they first came out in 1966. 17 smoking was something that virginia and 18 joseph varner wanted to do, that they enjoyed 19 doing together. 20 mr. varner never once encouraged his wife 21 to quit smoking before 1992, yet here he is 22 asking you to award him an incredible sum of 23 money. 24 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor. 25 the court: what is the objection? mr. schlesinger: may i approach? 2 (the following discussion was held at 3 sidebar:) 4 mr. schlesinger: i'm sorry, judge, what 5 does the warning -- 6 the court: "incredible"? i take it 7 that is the problem? 8 mr. schlesinger: what does the warning 9 have to do with damages? the warnings have to 10 do with the damages? you talk about the 11 damages in the case, the warnings have to -- 12 yeah, i object to him saying it is an 13 incredible amount of money, and i object to him 14 saying that the warnings have something to do 15 with the damages in the case. 16 and i'm not looking to interrupt his 17 time. i apologize. but i do not want to make 18 a -- 19 the court: wish to be heard? 20 mr. geraghty: no, your honor. 21 the court: the objection is overruled. 22 this is argument. 23 counsel, you need to start to wrap it up. 24 mr. geraghty: mr. keehfus said i have 25 five minutes of his time. (sidebar discussion concluded, and the 2 following was held in open court:) 3 the court: counsel, when you are ready, 4 you may proceed. 5 mr. geraghty: thank you, your honor. 6 in 1992, you heard that for the very 7 first time, joseph varner encouraged his wife 8 to stop smoking. 9 what does she say? i'm going to die 10 anyway. 11 that is in 1992. virginia varner never 12 made any effort to quit smoking before she was 13 diagnosed with cancer. 14 should joseph varner be made a 15 multimillionaire when the evidence shows that 16 he and his wife lived their lives exactly the 17 way they wanted to live it? 18 and if you get this far on the verdict 19 form, i would suggest that you use your life 20 experiences and your common sense when 21 deciding -- 22 mr. gdanski: objection. 23 mr. schlesinger: object. golden rule, 24 judge. 25 the court: overruled. mr. geraghty: i suggest you use your 2 everyday life experiences and your common sense 3 when deciding how much money you believe should 4 compensate mr. varner for his loss. 5 but i would suggest that given the 6 evidence that you have heard in this case over 7 the last two weeks, $100,000 is indeed far more 8 consistent, fair and appropriate, given all the 9 evidence you have heard in the case. 10 now, the last question on the verdict 11 form asks whether you find by clear and 12 convincing evidence that punitive damages are 13 warranted against philip morris or 14 r.j. reynolds. 15 if you answer "no" to that question, you 16 never get to the issue of punitive damages and 17 your work is done. 18 so let me very briefly talk about what 19 you are being asked to decide. 20 in this phase, you are not being asked to 21 decide the amount of punitive damages. the 22 issue is whether, by clear and convincing 23 evidence, mr. varner has demonstrated that he 24 is entitled to an award of punitive damages. 25 so do not spend one minute thinking about the amount. 2 the question before you right now is 3 whether he has shown that he is entitled to 4 punitive damages. 5 if you decide the answer to that question 6 is "yes," there will be another phase of this 7 trial. the plaintiff will present evidence. 8 they suggested they may show testimony from 9 dr. proctor -- 10 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor. 11 mr. geraghty: philip morris -- 12 mr. schlesinger: objection. what we are 13 doing in the second phase, objection. 14 the court: sustained, counsel. 15 mr. schlesinger: move to strike. 16 mr. geraghty: plaintiff will have the 17 opportunity to present evidence. philip morris 18 and r.j. reynolds will have the opportunity to 19 present evidence, and there will be additional 20 argument. 21 now, i want to make sure that if you get 22 to this issue, you understand what you are being 23 asked to decide. 24 you will see in the instructions clear 25 and convincing evidence is defined. it is a much higher burden of proof than the greater 2 weight of the evidence. 3 it says specifically that the evidence 4 must be, quote, "precise, explicit, lacking in 5 confusion, and of such weight that it produces 6 a firm belief or conviction without hesitation 7 about the matter at issue." 8 in other words, you need to be convinced, 9 convinced that punitive damages are appropriate 10 under that standard. 11 one more thing. you have to decide if 12 you get there that punitive damages are 13 warranted based only on conduct that relates 14 specifically to virginia varner. 15 you may think to yourselves -- 16 mr. schlesinger: objection, judge. 17 the court: overruled. 18 mr. schlesinger: objection. 19 the court: excuse me. 20 what is the objection, counsel? 21 mr. schlesinger: may i approach? i'm 22 sorry. 23 (the following discussion was held at 24 sidebar:) 25 mr. schlesinger: damages to be awarded in the next phase pertain only to the conduct 2 as it affects virginia varner. 3 however, your honor read an instruction 4 that says: in assessing reprehensibility and 5 determining whether punitive damages are 6 warranted, you may consider harm to others. 7 and you may do it for purposes of deterring 8 others from acting the same way. 9 he just said the only way you get to 10 punitive damages is, any wrongful conduct 11 specific as to virginia varner. that is not 12 your instruction. that is phase ii. that has 13 to go with how much the damages will be to her, 14 if they get there. 15 but that is absolutely not the 16 instruction you gave on why you admitted into 17 evidence the harm to others. 18 so it is a complete misstatement of law. 19 i had to object. 20 the court: wish to be heard? 21 mr. geraghty: no, sir. 22 the court: overruled. 23 (sidebar discussion concluded, and the 24 following was held in open court:) 25 mr. geraghty: i'm getting close to the finish line here, ladies and gentlemen. 2 may i proceed, your honor? 3 the court: please. 4 mr. geraghty: now, you may think, based 5 on the evidence you have heard, well, the 6 companies did bad things, and i'm sure you 7 do not like that. 8 but this is virginia varner's case, and 9 under the law, you cannot award punitive 10 damages unless -- you can only award punitive 11 damages in this case for conduct that is 12 specifically related to virginia varner. 13 based on the evidence you have heard in 14 this case, nothing that philip morris did or 15 did not do harmed virginia varner. 16 philip morris made and sold cigarettes. 17 that alone cannot be the basis for liability. 18 cigarettes are a legal product. and in 19 the instructions, the court has already 20 instructed you the defendants cannot be liable 21 for manufacturing, advertising, and selling 22 cigarettes, even though we all recognize they 23 are inherently dangerous and addictive. 24 now, let us talk about that last factor, 25 deterrence. what did you hear about the philip morris 2 of today from dr. proctor? you heard that the 3 tobacco institute and the council for tobacco 4 research were disbanded in 1998. 5 since that time, there have been no 6 cigarette ads on billboards or transit of any 7 kind. there is no sponsorship of concerts, no 8 advertising at sporting events. 9 and you have also heard that even though 10 it is legally permissible today, philip morris 11 no longer advertises in magazines. 12 for the last 16 years, philip morris has 13 publicly stated cigarette smoking causes lung 14 cancer, cigarette smoking is addictive, and 15 there is no such thing as a safe cigarette. 16 the fda now has regulatory authority over 17 philip morris and cigarettes. philip morris 18 pays large sums of money to the fda and the 19 states, including the state of florida, to 20 enforce the regulations and the restrictions 21 that govern the way philip morris does business 22 today. 23 and what are those restrictions? the fda 24 has the power to reduce nicotine to arbitrarily 25 very, very low levels. it has the power to ban any flavoring it deems unsafe or harmful. 2 philip morris and r.j. reynolds have to 3 get approval from the fda if they want to 4 launch a new tobacco product or make any 5 substantial change in an existing one. 6 the fda has the power to shut down 7 manufacturing facilities if philip morris and 8 r.j. reynolds are not in compliance with any of 9 the fda's regulations. 10 smoking rates for both adults and youth 11 are at all-time lows in this country, and 12 that is especially true here in the state of 13 florida. 14 ms. varner always had the information 15 available to her to make an informed decision 16 about whether she would smoke cigarettes or 17 whether she wanted to quit. 18 she always had the ability to quit 19 whenever she was motivated to do so. 20 and the evidence now shows that she 21 simply did not make an effort to do so until, 22 unfortunately, it was too late. 23 given the evidence you have heard, the 24 plaintiff has simply failed to meet his burden 25 of proof on this question, and your answer to that last question on punitive damages should 2 be "no." 3 i'm going to sit down here in about 60 4 seconds. mr. keehfus is going to speak to you, 5 and then mr. schlesinger, on behalf of the 6 plaintiff, will have one more opportunity to 7 talk to you, and that is because the plaintiff 8 bears the burden of proof. 9 i do not know what mr. schlesinger will 10 say, but i can predict it is likely not going to 11 be very favorable about philip morris and 12 r.j. reynolds. 13 as you listen to the things he says, just 14 ask yourself: what does this have to do with 15 virginia varner? 16 mr. schlesinger: objection, your honor. 17 that is -- 18 the court: excuse me. 19 it is argument, counsel. 20 mr. schlesinger: i withdraw it, judge. 21 i withdraw it. 22 mr. geraghty: the truth is, ladies and 23 gentlemen, we do enjoy a tremendous amount of 24 freedom in this country. we have the right to 25 make decisions and lifestyle choices that are not always in our best interests. and with 2 that freedom comes the obligation to accept 3 personal responsibility for the consequences of 4 those decisions. 5 and at the end of the day, ladies and 6 gentlemen, that is what this case is all about. 7 that is what this case is all about. 8 based on the evidence you have heard in 9 this case, your answer should be clear. 10 based on the evidence you have heard in 11 virginia varner's case, the evidence supports 12 one and only one true verdict. that is a 13 verdict in favor of philip morris and 14 r.j. reynolds. 15 i'm going to sit down now, and this is my 16 last opportunity i'm going to have to speak to 17 all of you. 18 and i just want to end with letting you 19 know that it is been an honor to be able to 20 present the case to you. you have all been 21 very, very patient with all the questions i've 22 asked and all the time i've spent standing up 23 talking to you, and i just want you to know 24 that i really appreciate it very much. 25 so thank you very much. the court: counsel, thank you. 14 mr. keehfus: thank you, your honor. 15 may it please the court. 16 counsel. mr. varner. 17 ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. 18 jurors: good afternoon. 19 mr. keehfus: this case is about one 20 smoker and one smoker only. 21 it is about mrs. varner. and it is about 22 mrs. varner who smoked my client's product over 23 the course of two years 60 years ago. 24 and she stopped smoking my client's 25 product nearly four decades before she was diagnosed with lung cancer or copd. 2 those are the facts of this case, of 3 mrs. varner's case. 4 now, plaintiff has made the claim to you 5 that somehow mrs. varner's smoking of winston 6 cigarettes over the course of those two years 7 in the 1950s caused her lung cancer and copd 40 8 years later. 9 there has been a complete failure of 10 proof. plaintiffs have completely failed to 11 meet their burden of proof to prove to you that 12 but for mrs. varner's smoking of winston 13 cigarettes for those two years in the 1950s, 14 she would have avoided her lung cancer and 15 copd. 16 what was the evidence that you did hear 17 with respect to r.j. reynolds? 18 i've summarized it here on this board. 19 these are five key facts. five key facts that 20 you heard through this trial, and you can use 21 each of these five key facts to answer every 22 question on the verdict form with respect to 23 r.j. reynolds. 24 this can be your pocket guide as you go 25 back into the jury room. what are those key facts? mrs. varner's 2 smoking of reynolds' cigarettes for only two 3 years did not cause her cancer, copd, or death. 4 mrs. varner regularly smoked reynolds' 5 cigarettes for only two years and stopped 6 smoking winston cigarettes in 1956. 7 mrs. varner never tried to quit smoking 8 while she smoked reynolds' cigarettes. 9 mrs. varner never relied on anything 10 r.j. reynolds said or did. instead, she made 11 her own smoking decisions. 12 and despite knowing that smoking is 13 dangerous and addictive, mrs. varner chose to 14 smoke, because she wanted to smoke. 15 these are the five key facts that you can 16 use to answer each and every question on your 17 verdict form with respect to r.j. reynolds. 18 and during the time i have with you, i 19 want to focus in on the issues with respect to 20 r.j. reynolds, the specific issues with respect 21 to my client. 22 i, of course, join in mr. geraghty's 23 comments to you this morning and this 24 afternoon. and i'm going to focus in on just 25 some of the questions on the verdict form specifically with respect to r.j. reynolds. 2 undisputed, ladies and gentlemen, 3 mrs. varner smoked winston cigarettes only over 4 the course of two years, between 1954 and 1956. 5 now, we do not know how much she was 6 smoking of winston at that time. it was so 7 long ago, mr. varner could not provide those 8 details. we do not know how much she was 9 smoking of winston. we do not know how often 10 she was smoking. 11 but what we do know is that she was in 12 school at the time, all day long, and smoking 13 was not permitted on school grounds. and then 14 after school, we know that she went home to 15 live with her parents. 16 so while we do not know exactly how much 17 mrs. varner was smoking between 1954 and 1956, 18 we know it probably was not that much, because 19 she just did not have an opportunity to smoke at 20 that time. 21 we also know that around this time, she is 22 also smoking some marlboro cigarettes. you 23 recall that mr. varner got a marlboro cigarette 24 from mrs. varner around this time period. 25 you heard this morning from plaintiff that, well, was it 1953 when she started 2 smoking winston or was it 1954? 3 but you heard dr. proctor tell you, 4 winston did not even come on the market in the 5 united states until 1954. there is absolutely 6 no way she was smoking any winston cigarettes 7 before 1954. 8 and the undisputed evidence is she 9 stopped in 1956. 10 we also -- what else do we know about 11 mrs. varner's smoking of winston? 12 well, mr. varner told you, they did not 13 like the taste of winston. it was too harsh. 14 they did not enjoy that taste, and so they 15 switched. 16 they switched to a cigarette that they 17 did enjoy and they did like the taste of, 18 marlboro. 19 and by the time they were dating in 1957, 20 they were smoking marlboro cigarettes. 21 and the undisputed testimony before you 22 is that mrs. varner smoked marlboro cigarettes 23 from 1957 to 1994. 24 mr. varner told you that, lisa roberts 25 told you that, and her daughter lori cohen told you that. no dispute about that. 2 there is no evidence that mrs. varner 3 smoked winston or any other cigarette 4 manufactured by my client after 1956, 60 years 5 ago. 6 r.j. reynolds was out of her life in 7 1956, never to return. 8 now, i told you in opening statement you 9 probably would not hear much about winston 10 cigarettes in this trial, and you did not. 11 and that is because mrs. varner's use of 12 winston cigarettes was so long ago and it was 13 so minimal and insignificant that it did not 14 merit much discussion, and you did not hear much 15 about it. 16 and in thinking of a way to illustrate 17 mrs. varner's use of winston cigarettes in the 18 context of all of her smoking, i tried to come 19 up with a picture. 20 i think this is a helpful way to 21 demonstrate mrs. varner's use of winston 22 cigarettes in the context of all of her 23 smoking. 24 it was like a couple of drops of water in 25 an ocean. very insignificant. very minimal, her use of winston. 2 now, plaintiff's other claim that they 3 have made against r.j. reynolds are for 4 concealment and agreement to conceal, questions 5 3 and questions 4 on your verdict form. 6 as mr. geraghty told you, it is 7 plaintiff's burden of proof -- not burden of 8 speculation, not a burden of assumptions, and 9 not a burden of inferences, but it is their 10 burden of proof -- to bring you evidence that 11 mrs. varner relied on a statement made by 12 r.j. reynolds or philip morris. 13 and but for her reliance on that 14 statement, she would have acted differently and 15 avoided her injuries. 16 we will talk more about that later, but 17 there is a complete lack of evidence with 18 respect to r.j. reynolds on both the 19 concealment and agreement to conceal claims. 20 in fact, there is no evidence that 21 mrs. varner had even heard of r.j. reynolds, 22 mr. varner, and their three children testified. 23 not a single one of them even said the name 24 "r.j. reynolds" in their testimony. 25 it is an extremely high burden of proof. the plaintiff has to prove that but for her 2 reliance, she would have acted differently and 3 avoided her lung cancer and copd. and they 4 failed to meet that burden of proof. 5 but i want to focus in on the key issue 6 with respect to r.j. reynolds. it is going to 7 be question 2 on your verdict form. 8 if you get to question 2. because, 9 again, i join in mr. geraghty's comments and 10 ask that you return a verdict for the 11 defendants on question 1, which would be a no. 12 if you get to question 2, the plaintiff 13 must prove that smoking r.j. reynolds' 14 cigarettes was a legal cause of mrs. varner's 15 lung cancer and copd. 16 now, as mr. geraghty told you in opening 17 statement, there is no dispute in this case 18 that smoking was a legal cause of mrs. varner's 19 lung cancer and copd. 20 the question for you is whether it was 21 r.j. reynolds,' whether smoking r.j. reynolds' 22 cigarettes was a legal cause of mrs. varner's 23 lung cancer or copd. 24 the plaintiff has a burden to prove that 25 against r.j. reynolds. you will see that on question 2 on your verdict form. 2 question 2: was smoking cigarettes 3 manufactured by r.j. reynolds tobacco company a 4 legal cause of virginia varner's lung cancer or 5 copd? 6 now, this morning it was suggested to you 7 that r.j. reynolds was a substantial cause of 8 mrs. varner's lung cancer or copd because those 9 two years of winston back in the 1950s 10 initiated and sustained an addiction. those 11 were the words that were used. 12 ladies and gentlemen, on this question -- 13 can i have the elmo, please? oh, boy. 14 there we go. 15 so it was suggested to you that 16 r.j. reynolds' cigarettes were a substantial 17 cause of mrs. varner's lung cancer and copd 18 because they initiated and sustained an 19 addiction. and we will get to that in more 20 detail later. 21 but you can see in question 2, addiction 22 appears nowhere in that question. addiction 23 has nothing to do with question 2. 24 the question is very limited and very 25 focused. and it boils down to: did mrs. varner smoke enough winston cigarettes to 2 be a cause of her lung cancer or copd 40 years 3 later? 4 addiction has nothing to do with 5 question 2. 6 we talked about this concept of legal 7 cause. i spoke to you about it briefly during 8 opening statement. 9 what does it mean to be a legal cause? 10 you have your jury instruction. it is 11 jury instruction number 9, and it is on page 11 12 of your packet. 13 and, ladies and gentlemen, this legal 14 instruction embodies the rules of law that you 15 have to apply to the facts as you find them to 16 render your verdict. 17 these are the rules. and these are the 18 rules that you apply. 19 and what do the rules tell you? well, 20 the rules tell you the plaintiff must prove, 21 but for smoking -- but for smoking cigarettes 22 manufactured by r.j. reynolds tobacco company, 23 mrs. varner's lung cancer or copd would not 24 have occurred. 25 that is the plaintiff's burden. they have to prove that but for smoking cigarettes 2 manufactured by r.j. reynolds, mrs. varner's 3 lung cancer or copd would not have occurred. 4 in other words, plaintiff has to prove 5 that if you take winston out of the equation 6 from 1954 to 1956, mrs. varner never develops 7 lung cancer or copd in 1994, nearly 40 years 8 later. that is the burden of proof that 9 plaintiff has. 10 ladies and gentlemen, the evidence was 11 overwhelming before you. not only did 12 plaintiff fail to meet their burden to prove to 13 you that reynolds was a but-for cause of 14 mrs. varner's lung cancer or copd. but i 15 brought you the evidence on cross-examination 16 of their own expert witnesses that conclusively 17 established that reynolds' cigarettes were not 18 a legal cause of mrs. varner's lung cancer or 19 copd. 20 the evidence was overwhelming that two 21 pack years of smoking in the 1950s was not even 22 close to being enough to cause lung cancer or 23 copd. 24 and it came from their own witnesses. 25 dr. gup. you recall dr. gup was the gentleman that testified early last week. 2 and he told you on cross-examination: 3 lung cancer typically does not occur without at 4 least 20 pack years of smoking, 20. ten times 5 the amount of winston smoking that mrs. varner 6 had. 7 dr. difranza went further. he doubled 8 that. he said in his 30 years of practicing 9 medicine up in massachusetts, he is never seen a 10 lung cancer patient with less than 40 pack 11 years of smoking. forty pack years, 20 times 12 the amount of winston smoking mrs. varner had. 13 and dr. proctor told you it takes decades 14 for cancer to develop. and, of course, it 15 does. 16 dr. gup explained that. he explained the 17 repeated exposures that are necessary over 18 many, many years in order for those genetic 19 mutations to even start the process which may 20 eventually end up being cancer. 21 it takes many, many years for those 22 mutations to even start. 23 even in plaintiff's best case scenario, 24 their own witness said it takes at least 20 25 years. mrs. varner had 1/10 of that. 1/10 of that for r.j. reynolds. 2 given what plaintiff's own expert said, 3 it was not surprising that dr. difranza gave the 4 key admission on this issue, on the issue in 5 question 2 on your verdict form with respect to 6 r.j. reynolds and legal cause. 7 dr. difranza told you that even if 8 mrs. varner had started smoking in 1957, 9 instead of 1954, she more likely than not still 10 would have developed lung cancer. 11 you may ask yourself, well, why is that 12 important? it is important because by 1957, 13 winston and r.j. reynolds are out of 14 mrs. varner's life. she is a marlboro smoker. 15 and dr. difranza told you that if you 16 take out 1954 to 1956, remove that from the 17 equation, mrs. varner never touches winston 18 cigarettes and starts smoking in 1957, she 19 still would have gotten lung cancer. 20 remember, it is the plaintiff's burden to 21 prove if not for winston, she never would have 22 gotten lung cancer or copd. 23 dr. difranza says that is not so. the 24 same thing more likely than not would have 25 happened. and that means r.j. reynolds is not a legal cause. the smoking of r.j. reynolds' 2 cigarettes is not a legal cause of 3 mrs. varner's lung cancer or copd. 4 but we did not stop there. dr. difranza 5 admitted for someone with a smoking history of 6 just two or three pack years, he said that 7 person's risk of developing lung cancer would 8 be very, very low. very, very low. two pack 9 years, just like mrs. varner had with respect 10 to winston. 11 and he said the person who had two or 12 three pack years would have a risk so low that 13 it would be difficult to distinguish from that 14 of a nonsmoker. 15 so even after two years of smoking 16 winston, she really had no appreciable increase 17 in lung cancer risk compared to a nonsmoker. 18 so not only did plaintiff fail to prove 19 legal cause, but they could not even prove that 20 winston increased the risk that mrs. varner 21 would get lung cancer or copd, that it would 22 increase her chances, because dr. difranza 23 said: even two years of smoking, no real 24 appreciable increase in risk. and i cannot tell 25 the difference in risk between someone who smokes for two years and a nonsmoker. 2 ladies and gentlemen, the evidence was 3 overwhelming and direct and it came from 4 plaintiff's own witnesses, the witnesses they 5 hired to come in and testify on mr. varner's 6 behalf. 7 and they told you, they told you about 8 the amount of smoking that is required. 9 multipliers more than two pack years. for 10 dr. gup it was ten times that, and for 11 dr. difranza it was 20 times that. it was not 12 even close. 13 mrs. varner did not develop cancer in 14 1994 because she smoked cigarettes manufactured 15 by reynolds over the course of a couple years 16 in the middle 1950s. 17 but plaintiffs have also made a claim for 18 copd. so what was the evidence on copd? well, 19 it was even stronger than the evidence was for 20 cancer. dr. difranza told you he does not see 21 copd patients with less than 50 pack years of 22 smoking, 25 times that of mrs. varner and 23 winston smoking. 24 the court: ten minutes, counsel. 25 mr. keehfus: dr. difranza admitted mrs. varner would have gotten copd even if she 2 had never touched winston cigarettes. even if 3 she had started smoking in 1957 when she 4 switched to marlboro and smoked to 1994, she 5 still would have developed copd. 6 that destroys plaintiff's claims of 7 but-for causation. 8 remember, plaintiff has to prove if not 9 for the winston, she does not develop lung 10 cancer or copd. dr. difranza said on both 11 claims, on lung cancer and copd, even if she 12 did not smoke from 1954 to 1956, she still more 13 likely than not would have developed both of 14 those diseases. 15 that is the key admission in the case, 16 and that is the key admission on question 2, on 17 your verdict form, that smoking cigarettes 18 manufactured by reynolds was not a legal cause. 19 because dr. difranza said so. 20 now, the claim again was made to you that 21 her smoking of winston during that time 22 initiated and sustained her addiction. and 23 somehow her smoking of winston over the course 24 of those two years made her go on and smoke 25 cigarettes manufactured by a different company for the next 40 years? 2 well, ladies and gentlemen, you can use 3 your common sense to evaluate that argument and 4 that claim. and when you do, you will see that 5 it just does not stand up to an examination. 6 what do we know? well, we know from that 7 time period when she is smoking winston that 8 she is also smoking some marlboro. so you cannot 9 say that if it was not for the winston she would 10 not have gone on to become a regular smoker. 11 we know that she was smoking cigarettes 12 manufactured by other companies at that time 13 and cigarettes that she went on to smoke after 14 she switched from winston. 15 also, we know that mr. varner smoked 16 marlboro pretty much his entire adult life. 17 that is how they identified themselves, as 18 marlboro smokers. and that was the man who she 19 married and spent time with. 20 he cannot say that she would not have gone 21 on to become a regular smoker if it was not for 22 winston. that is like someone who drinks red 23 wine for a couple of years early in their life 24 and then after a couple years says: you know 25 what? i do not like that red wine so much anymore, i do not like the taste of it and i'm 2 going to switch to white wine. and they go on, 3 they drink white wine for the next 40 years 4 until they unfortunately develop cirrhosis of 5 the liver, and then they turn around and say: 6 oh, but you know what? it was that red wine 7 that i drank in an undetermined amount 40 years 8 ago that caused all the problems. 9 of course nobody would say that because 10 it does not make sense. 11 plaintiff's claim here is no different. 12 so, ladies and gentlemen, when you get to 13 question 2 and you see the question: was 14 smoking cigarettes manufactured by 15 r.j. reynolds a legal cause of mrs. varner's 16 lung cancer or copd, the answer is a resounding 17 "no." 18 there is been a complete failure of proof. 19 and, in fact, i've brought you the evidence to 20 demonstrate conclusively that reynolds 21 cigarettes were not a legal cause. 22 but even if, in an alternate universe, 23 two years of smoking was somehow enough to 24 cause lung cancer or copd, even if that was 25 enough, it happened so long ago that any minuscule risk that mrs. varner would have 2 accumulated would have disappeared. 3 that was the testimony from plaintiff's 4 expert dr. joseph difranza. he candidly 5 admitted that for someone with a two- or 6 three-pack year history their risk of 7 developing lung cancer 40 years later would be 8 the same as someone who had never smoked. 9 the risk would be the same as someone who 10 had never smoked. no appreciable even increase 11 in the risk. and after 40 years that risk 12 would decline and be the same as a never 13 smoker. 14 what did dr. difranza tell you about this 15 addiction theory that winston initiated and 16 sustained addiction? 17 he admitted that even if mrs. varner 18 did not smoke winston cigarettes from 1954 to 19 1956, knowing what he knows about the rest of 20 her smoking history from 1957 forward, he would 21 still come to the conclusion that she was 22 addicted. 23 now, for the reasons mr. geraghty said 24 and discussed earlier, obviously plaintiffs 25 have failed to meet their burden of proof to prove mrs. varner was addicted to nicotine. 2 but even if they somehow could make that 3 case to you, dr. difranza admits that even if 4 you -- even if she never touched winston 5 cigarettes, in his opinion she still would have 6 been addicted. so this theory that if not for 7 winston she never would have been a regular 8 smoker, it just does not have any merit. 9 when you take it apart piece by piece, it 10 falls flat. 11 the court: five minutes, counsel. 12 mr. keehfus: so when you get to 13 question 2 on your verdict form, for all of 14 these reasons, the overwhelming and persuasive 15 and convincing evidence is mrs. varner's lung 16 cancer or copd were not legally caused by her 17 smoking a couple of years of winston cigarettes 18 40 years before she was diagnosed. 19 i want to get to plaintiff's claims for 20 reliance and concealment. 21 it is plaintiff's burden to prove the 22 linkage, the connection between any statements 23 and mrs. varner. they have identified no 24 statement made by r.j. reynolds that had any 25 impact whatsoever on mrs. varner. again, this is a burden of proof. 2 they have got to provide you with a statement 3 that mrs. varner saw that impacted her smoking 4 decisions. and there is been a total failure of 5 proof. 6 they have got to show a statement by each 7 defendant that she believed it, that she made 8 decisions based on it, and that had she not 9 seen it, she would have acted differently and 10 avoided her injury. 11 what does that mean? that means that had 12 she -- they have got to prove, had she not seen 13 that statement, she would not have gotten lung 14 cancer or copd. she would have thrown her 15 cigarettes down immediately, quit smoking, and 16 avoided any disease. 17 that is plaintiff's burden of proof when 18 you get to questions 3 and 4. and they have 19 completely failed to prove that. 20 the fact is, there is absolutely no 21 evidence mrs. varner's smoking choices were 22 impacted by r.j. reynolds. there is no evidence 23 that she relied on any r.j. reynolds 24 advertisements or ad campaigns or documents or 25 executives or video clips. none of that. it was plaintiff's burden to tie all that 2 to mrs. varner. dr. proctor testified for 14 3 hours and 43 minutes of your time. he talked 4 about mrs. varner for less than 40 seconds. 5 he was no help to you in determining 6 whether mrs. varner was specifically impacted 7 by something philip morris or r.j. reynolds 8 did. 9 you have -- plaintiffs have a burden 10 against each defendant, and when you get to 11 question 3 or 4 -- 3 and 4, i ask that you find 12 "no" for philip morris but specifically for 13 r.j. reynolds as well. 14 when you get to the issue of comparative 15 fault, plaintiffs have the burden to prove each 16 and every percentage point. 17 you should not get this far on the verdict 18 form, but if you do, i want to address this 19 with you very briefly. 20 they have the burden to prove each and 21 every percentage point. and it is got to be 22 conduct that you would find to be a legal cause 23 of mrs. varner's injuries. 24 this is not a comparison of conduct in 25 general. it is a very specific, focused question. you can only allocate fault for that 2 conduct that you find to be a legal cause of 3 mrs. varner's injury, that conduct that they 4 tied up to mrs. varner. 5 and especially here with respect to 6 r.j. reynolds, the evidence establishes that 7 her smoking of r.j. reynolds cigarettes was not 8 a legal cause of her injury. and even her 9 smoking of r.j. reynolds products resulted in a 10 0 percent increase in even her chances or her 11 risk of developing a disease. 12 so i ask that if you get to this question 13 on your verdict form on the allocation of 14 fault, that you enter a 0 percent for 15 r.j. reynolds. r.j. reynolds was out of her 16 life in 1956, never to return. 17 the court: you need to wrap it up, 18 counsel. 19 mr. keehfus: ladies and gentlemen, on 20 plaintiff's claim for damages, $10 million was 21 the claim made to you. plaintiff is asking 22 from r.j. reynolds for millions of dollars 23 because mrs. varner took some winston 24 cigarettes from her mother and smoked them over 25 the course of a couple of years 60 years ago. and for that mr. varner wants to be made a 2 millionaire. 3 respectfully, ladies and gentlemen, the 4 evidence does not even come close to supporting 5 that claim especially against r.j. reynolds. 6 on the issue of punitive damages, you will 7 be told that -- and in your instructions you 8 were instructed that there is mitigating 9 evidence. 10 you may consider mitigating evidence 11 which demonstrates that r.j. reynolds and 12 philip morris need not be punished. 13 and what did you hear? you heard 14 r.j. reynolds and philip morris tried to make a 15 safer cigarette. specifically r.j. reynolds 16 tried with the premier cigarette which heated, 17 did not burn tobacco. but it failed in the 18 marketplace because it smelled like rotten 19 rubber and fish, as dr. proctor told you. 20 but that does not stop them. they did not 21 give up. reynolds went back to the drawing 22 board and tried eclipse, redoubled their 23 efforts, poured hundreds of millions of dollars 24 into it. but it failed again in the 25 marketplace. but they tried to make a safer product. 2 you heard now about public disclosure on 3 the companies' websites. you heard about the 4 companies funding tobacco-free florida, the 5 anti-youth smoking programs that are currently 6 in place, and the fact that we have evidence 7 that they are working. 8 youth smoking rates are at an all-time 9 low, especially in broward county. 10 you heard a lot about the environment of 11 smoking, but you heard that smoking has now 12 been de-normalized and we are moving towards a 13 society where nobody will smoke cigarettes. 14 that is the environment that dr. proctor told 15 you about today. 16 that is the mitigating evidence, ladies 17 and gentlemen, which you should consider on 18 this issue of whether the plaintiff is entitled 19 to punitive damages. 20 and when you get to question 8, you 21 should check "no" for both defendants, but 22 especially for r.j. reynolds in light of the 23 evidence that you heard in this trial. 24 i'm going to end where i started, with 25 these five key facts, five key facts that you heard and will help you decide every question 2 with respect to r.j. reynolds on your verdict 3 form. 4 i told you my role in this case would be 5 limited. i did not cross-examine some of the 6 witnesses, and other witnesses i cross-examined 7 very briefly. but i told you my role was going 8 to be limited because of mrs. varner's limited 9 use of my client's product. 10 and that is exactly what the evidence 11 showed. 12 she smoked my client's product very 13 minimally for an insignificant period of time 14 60 years ago. and the evidence showed that her 15 smoking of r.j. reynolds cigarettes was not a 16 legal cause of her lung cancer or copd 60 -- 17 sorry, 40 years later and 60 years ago. 18 ladies and gentlemen, i ask that you 19 return a verdict in favor of the defendants in 20 this case. 21 i thank you very much for your time and 22 attention.
