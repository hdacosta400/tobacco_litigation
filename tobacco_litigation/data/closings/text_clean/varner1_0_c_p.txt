15 mr. schlesinger: may it please the 16 court, counsel. 17 ladies and gentlemen of the jury, thank 18 you. you all are folks that have sacrificed a 19 lot to be here with us, to participate in this 20 jury system. we cannot thank you enough. the 21 court personnel, we cannot thank them enough. 22 and we are just honored and proud to be 23 able to present this case and be able to wrap 24 it up at this juncture, and i'm just going to 25 jump right in. my time is limited. so, the verdict form, which is what you 2 all are going to fill out and check off 3 questions -- 4 and mr. keehfus mentioned that every 5 single question on the verdict form only talks 6 about virginia varner, and i wanted to 7 elaborate on that a bit, because every single 8 question on the verdict form not only talks 9 about virginia varner, but always in terms of 10 cigarettes. 11 and you cannot separate out virginia 12 varner, or so many other smokers in this 13 country -- 45 million of them at this time -- 14 from cigarettes and the role they play. 15 this case is about what cigarettes do to 16 people, the harm they cause, the addiction they 17 cause. the mothers, brothers, aunties, uncles, 18 children, grandparents who are left behind to 19 grieve and suffer in what is a -- what is very 20 much not a peaceful end to an existence. 21 and i always think about, when they say 22 the word "pleasure," is this the price for 23 pleasure? you will see, there is no socially 24 redeeming benefit to cigarettes in this 25 country. it is a business, and that is all it is. 2 but the questions pertain to virginia 3 varner and the nexus of the production of the 4 product, defective and dangerous product, that 5 are the cigarettes, and every question is how 6 did virginia varner inter- -- interact with 7 cigarettes. they produced the cigarettes. 8 this is about what cigarettes do to people. 9 it is very important to consider. 10 but the very last question on the jury 11 instruction -- on the jury -- jury verdict 12 form -- i'm sorry, you got the instructions -- 13 on the verdict form: 14 under the circumstances of this case, 15 please state whether you find, by clear and 16 convincing evidence, that punitive damages are 17 warranted against: philip morris usa inc., 18 r.j. reynolds tobacco company, and the check 19 mark for "yes" or "no." 20 so that only talks about them, a fine. 21 they have not been fined. punishment. 22 and one has said that punishment is 23 justice for the unjust. they richly deserve 24 it. we hope we proved it. we are going to talk 25 about it. but i wanted to talk about the very last 2 question first, and talk to you all about how 3 you get there if, when i stitch this case 4 together, you see this our way. 5 and the very first thing i thought about 6 was just some of the topics of what this 7 business is all about. i'm going to try to do 8 it quick. 9 doubt is our product. you thought they 10 manufactured cigarettes. they manufacture 11 doubt. without nicotine, cigarette sales would 12 collapse and we would all be out of business 13 overnight. 14 this is the industry's internal 15 documents. they were not known until the late 16 '90s and 2000. they were not known in the 17 '50s, '60s, '70s and '80s. they were the 18 secret of what they really meant behind the 19 scenes. the second face. not the public face; 20 the true internal face. 21 the illusion of filtration: the filters 22 will be fake, the health reassurance to get 23 folks to keep smoking, the psychological crutch 24 we must provide our smokers who might be 25 worrying about health who are now going to get sick. the base of our business is the high 2 school student. 3 one of my favorite songs -- 4 it is not a favorite song. i liked elton 5 john when i was growing up in the '70s. i went 6 to high school and i -- 7 mr. geraghty: your honor, i object. 8 this is a personal story. 9 the court: overruled. this is argument, 10 counsel. 11 mr. schlesinger: there is a song that he 12 has on -- i think his third album, "honky 13 chateau." it is called -- called -- 14 i'm a little nervous, you know? 15 it is called "mona lisas and mad hatters," 16 all right? 17 and it is just got some great -- you know, 18 great lines in there. but he talks about "i 19 thought i knew, but now i know, that rose trees 20 never grow in new york city." 21 and he goes on and on and on, but it is 22 that line where he says, "i thought i knew, but 23 now i know." 24 one jury at a time, in the engle progeny 25 cases, in the decertified class, in the group of folks who are engle progeny jurors, in the 2 group of folks who are engle progeny 3 plaintiffs -- 4 you are an engle progeny juror. 5 mr. varner and his wife are engle progeny 6 plaintiffs. what is "progeny"? the children 7 of engle. "i thought i knew, but now i know." 8 we all came in here, we talked to folks, 9 and there was more folks in the jury selection 10 process than there were here now. they were 11 filled up -- 12 you were in those seats, you sat on those 13 hard benches, and we heard what folks thought 14 about cigarettes. everybody thinks they know 15 something about cigarettes, but now you know. 16 so i say, now you know something about 17 cigarettes you did not know, and why this would 18 be a valuable and worthwhile course to take. 19 but calling youth, calling children, 20 calling youngsters "replacement smokers," 21 perhaps you will agree with me that that meets 22 the bounds -- that goes beyond the bounds of 23 humane conduct, and gets into the recklessness, 24 the disregard for considerations of human life 25 and health, that justify punitive damages. that is why i started with this. 2 and i will tell you right now, you know, 3 we are completely coned down, completely 4 granular, focused, 24/7, on this case, and the 5 job that we do, it is the nature of the trial 6 lawyer, but we are not unmindful of world 7 events; however, they do not have any role in 8 this courtroom right now. 9 we cannot reflect upon them, we cannot talk 10 about them. we are in a crucible together, 11 where you all have been cut off from all of 12 your electronic devices, despite the fact that 13 this entire courtroom is bristling with 14 electronics and bristling with technology that 15 never existed when my 12- or 13-year-old client 16 was smoking cigarettes in the 1950s. no such 17 thing existed. 18 we have to put ourselves back in that 19 time and think about what was the world like 20 for her. she smoked during a period of time in 21 the world she grew up in, that she lived in, 22 that was normal. no appreciation of the 23 dangers, all right? so we live in a different 24 time. 25 now, you are going to have to ask -- answer these questions. i read them to you and 2 we hope you will answer them "yes." and we hope 3 that the evidence supports the concept that you 4 will answer them "yes." it will take us to the 5 next phase of the trial. 6 and the next phase of the trial will 7 take, hopefully, no more than tomorrow, if you 8 deliberate today and come to a ver- -- a 9 verdict; but sometimes the juries take a day, a 10 half a day, six days. there is no -- 11 the judge will -- 12 mr. geraghty: objection. i would object 13 to what other juries do, your honor. 14 the court: sustained. 15 mr. schlesinger: the judge -- 16 the judge will tell you that the 17 deliberation period of time is up to you all. 18 you take as little or as long as you like to do 19 it, to work through this. whenever you are done 20 with it. we cannot -- we sometimes -- 21 the defendants, more often than us, may 22 present some brief evidence -- 23 mr. geraghty: objection. 24 mr. keehfus: objection, your honor. 25 the court: sustained, counsel. mr. schlesinger: phase ii has evidence 2 that is far briefer. it is about net worth than 3 anything else, because the only thing -- 4 mr. keehfus: objection. 5 the court: sustained. counsel -- 6 mr. schlesinger: i'll move on, i'll move 7 on. i do not want to get bogged down. i'm 8 sorry. 9 all right. so you know what the frank 10 statement said. it was a promise to the 11 american people. it was the biggest 12 advertisement in the history -- in the history 13 of united states advertising. and it was 14 designed to get that message out, promises it 15 was not bad for you, basic responsibility more 16 important than business, not injurious to 17 health, safeguarding the public health, all 18 those charges have been abandoned for lack of 19 evidence, and we are going to put up an 20 unimpeachable, integrity guy in charge of the 21 committee. 22 but, in reality, the real business was not 23 that they have a paramount interest in others; 24 it is "who ain't for more money." it was about 25 making money, making profits. they disregarded the health of their customers to make money. 2 similarly, they promised they would 3 cooperate with the public health, but really 4 they smeared and belittled them. they would 5 say he is a -- 6 they would attack him, so that when you 7 saw labels that talked about the "surgeon 8 general says" on the pack of a side of 9 cigarettes, they worked heavily to undermine 10 the efficacy -- 11 mr. keehfus: objection. 12 mr. schlesinger: -- and authority -- 13 mr. geraghty: objection. 14 the court: sustained. 15 counsel, you got to slow down. 16 mr. keehfus: move to disregard. 17 the court: you have got to slow down. 18 mr. geraghty: move to strike the last 19 comment. 20 the court: the jury is to disregard the 21 last comment. it is stricken. 22 mr. schlesinger: as you know, they -- 23 they actively smeared and belittled the surgeon 24 general. they said that he was having 25 publicity stunts and he was intentionally misleading the american people. and that was a 2 lie. it was not true. true. but it was a very 3 successful campaign because they manufactured 4 doubt. they manufactured lung cancer. 5 what kind of business is it? we 6 manufacture a nicotine-delivery device. we 7 manufacture addiction, doubt, and lung cancer. 8 and millions and millions of people, in the era 9 in which those folks grew up in, bought it 10 hook, line, and sinker. 11 so, you know, all the charges have been 12 abandoned for lack of evidence, it is not 13 dangerous; but in their documents, going way 14 back into the early '60s, even the claude 15 teague documents in the '50s, indicated that 16 the amount of evidence accumulated to indict 17 cigarette smoke as a health hazard is 18 overwhelming, and the evidence challenging such 19 an indictment is scant. they knew full well, 20 before the '50s, that what they made caused 21 cancer. 22 and it brings up an interesting point. 23 when we played part of dr. figlar, reflect upon 24 all those 18th cent- -- 1800s, 19th century 25 articles that they trotted out in cross-examination of dr. proctor. 2 what was the point of that? that in some 3 dusty stack, somewhere in a library, they, 4 through research, were able to find the word 5 "danger" or "addiction" in some old medical 6 article? 7 was virginia varner, who had not been born 8 for another 50 or a hundred years, supposed to 9 know about that? 10 if that was common knowledge, the common 11 knowledge defense, then why in the world did not 12 they know about it? why did they invent the 13 bonsack machine and start pumping out 14 cigarettes in the millions, and mass marketing? 15 why did they embark upon this campaign if it 16 was such common knowledge that cigarettes were 17 deadly and addictive? 18 it might have been to them. it certainly 19 was not to virginia varner or the american 20 people. 21 and, as dr. proctor said, the message of 22 the public health and those old articles were 23 like a snowflake in a snowstorm. we will talk 24 about that. 25 unimpeachable integrity. clarence cook little, who they put in charge of it, was not 2 unimpeachable integrity when he said: and you 3 asked, have we looked for carcinogenic 4 substance in tobacco smoke. and we have not 5 because we do not believe they are there. 6 so that was -- it was obfuscation, doubt, 7 a front, a holding strategy. the whole thing 8 was a fake, designed to keep selling 9 cigarettes, keep people smoking. 10 they said that their research 11 corporations, this tirc, the ctr, all of these 12 guys are co-conspirators, they are all -- 13 they are all contributorily culpable. 14 meaning, a conspirator is, we get 15 together in a group and we conspire. and 16 dr. proctor said, conspiracy, it is (indicating) 17 inspiration, conspiracy. the breathing 18 together. 19 you know, imagine huddled together in the 20 plaza hotel, heads -- titans of industry -- 21 during a period of time where folks trusted 22 industry -- titans of industry, breathing 23 together, discussing together, whispering among 24 themselves of what we were going to do. 25 it is killing people. what are we going to do? we are going to keep making them, we are 2 making fortunes of money. and what are we 3 going to tell the american people? it is not 4 bad for you. 5 this is why this case calls out for and 6 screams for a fine, punishment. that is -- 7 that is the important part of the case to us. 8 and you can see they had a front and a 9 shield, and they are only interested in evidence 10 which denies the allegations that cigarette 11 smoking causes disease. were not trying to get 12 to the truth, were not using -- 13 they were using the exact opposite of 14 folks with unimpeachable integrity and national 15 repute. 16 and then, in 1994, after the ceos -- 17 the ceos, major men of major 18 responsibility, major might, major power, got 19 up and all raised their hand and lied to 20 congressmen, the -- 21 as -- as dr. proctor called it, the iron 22 uniformity of the conspiracy, that had held 23 together, okay, no matter what, to the "i will 24 tell these lies to my death." more 25 importantly, "i will tell these lies to the death of millions of americans for profits." 2 these are the kinds of things that are 3 not humane. and all florida citizens encompass 4 and embraces -- 5 and if you just take the death rates in 6 the united states -- and proctor spit out a lot 7 of statistics -- it has to encompass hundreds 8 of thousands of people that were included in 9 the class. that is why it is a big -- 10 mr. keehfus: objection, your honor. 11 mr. schlesinger: it is all florida 12 citizens. 13 mr. keehfus: objection. 14 the court: sustained, counsel. 15 mr. keehfus: move to strike. 16 mr. schlesinger: it is a reasonable -- 17 the court: excuse me. the jury is to 18 disregard the last comment. 19 mr. schlesinger: to hear the defendants 20 say it, nobody would ever be in the class, and 21 that would make no sense. 22 mr. keehfus: objection. 23 mr. geraghty: objection, your honor. 24 mr. schlesinger: and -- 25 the court: excuse me. overruled. this is argument. 2 mr. schlesinger: here's the most -- 3 here's the most important thing about it: 4 that word in there, "addiction," that his honor 5 says we are not going to give you any particular 6 definition of it, she meets every single part 7 of that. and it is all there. she is a class 8 member. that is -- 9 it is supposed to be all of those folks. 10 all of them. and they cannot deny addiction 11 causes disease. it makes you smoke too much 12 and you get sick. it is compulsive. 13 how about someone who smoked four -- who 14 drank four million sips of cocktail high balls, 15 right? a manhattan, with a shot of whiskey in 16 it, ten sips in a cup, 20 of them a day, seven 17 days a week, for 40 years. what would you call 18 that person? an enjoyable social drinker? or 19 would you call them an alcoholic? 20 twenty drinks a day, ten sips in a cup, 21 to get alcohol. what would you call that 22 person? 23 how about three million snorts of 24 cocaine? how about 300,000 snorts of cocaine 25 because it lasts ten times longer than the hit of a cigarette? 2 mr. keehfus: objection, your honor. 3 the court: overruled. 4 mr. schlesinger: what would you call 5 that person? you would call them a drug 6 addict. 7 that was the amazing thing about what 8 these drugs were. they were drugs that hide in 9 plain sight, that look like totally normal 10 consumer products. tell -- 11 you imagine a young boy walking up to his 12 dad and holding up this pack of cigarettes and 13 saying, "daddy, what is this?" and a father 14 looking to protect his son, saying, "it is bad." 15 and the son saying, "it does not look bad." 16 this looks like any other normal consumer 17 product: size, shape. it hides in plain 18 sight. it is not supposed to look like anything 19 abnormal. how do you protect a kid from this? 20 how do you protect them? so -- 21 mr. geraghty: objection, your honor -- 22 the court: excuse me. overruled. 23 mr. schlesinger: a camel is a kid's toy. 24 every kid's got toys. 25 so this is not heroin. this is not a sniffling, itching junkie, with mucus dripping 2 out of his nose, robbing a liquor store to try 3 to get a fix for smack. that is not what this 4 is. 5 nicotine does not make you that high. 6 nicotine is socially acceptable. it is a social 7 standard. that is the era in which she was 8 smoking cigarettes. 9 so, the greater weight of evidence. what 10 is the greater weight of evidence? it is the 11 more convincing force and effect of the 12 evidence in the case. 13 oops. i knew i would do that. 14 all right. anyway, i'll do it by hand. 15 the point is, on balance, whose case 16 makes more sense? it is not to the exclusion of 17 any and all reasonable doubt, it is not a 18 criminal burden or standard; it is, on balance, 19 whose case makes more sense? where is the 20 greater weight of the evidence? 21 so what is the simple truth in this case? 22 and i told you at the very beginning of this 23 case, it really is -- 24 and you can make it as -- 25 you can make it difficult. when we litigate it, we can make it difficult, but this 2 is what it is: smoking cigarettes is drug 3 addiction. the compulsive act of sucking 20 or 4 30 cigarettes down, ten puffs a cigarette, 5 seven days a week, without fail, for 40 years, 6 is dependence on a drug, okay? 7 and when you take her within a couple of 8 years -- 9 that picture is within a couple of years 10 before she started smoking. she is nine or ten 11 in that picture. within a year or two, she is 12 smoking cigarettes. could she make a 13 long-range lifestyle choice? did she know she 14 was going to get hooked? i do not think so. 15 so this is why virginia varner's in the 16 engle class. and i -- i want you to be 17 thinking about this. this is a timeline. 18 1954 -- 19 i mean, she is the engle class. she is 20 so right on the critical dates. 1954, dos, 21 date of smoking; 1954, doc, date of conspiracy. 22 that is when they put out the frank statement. 23 that is when they saw the mice painting studies 24 were resulting in cancer. 25 and, then, all the way through the '60s, '70s, '80s and '90s, what was going on? they 2 were lying, denying, producing doubt, 3 manufacturing doubt, propagating lung cancer, 4 working with nicotine as a center of their 5 universe. 6 it is: i thought i knew, but now i know. 7 now i know. now i know. one jury at a time. 8 1995 -- 9 mr. geraghty: objection, your honor. 10 the court: sustained. 11 mr. schlesinger: -- on january 1st -- 12 mr. geraghty: move to strike. 13 the court: excuse me. just talk about 14 this case, counsel. 15 mr. schlesinger: one -- 16 january 1st, new year's day, and she 17 passes. and you heard how she passes in those 18 records. and that is the way -- 19 it was not a peaceful way to go, moaning 20 in pain, with her family gathered around her 21 bedside, with the food -- choking and going 22 into her lungs from her throat from the 23 esophageal hole. 24 it is an ignominious end. she ended with 25 a whimper, just like they said when they made the conspiracy in 1954, that they were in fear, 2 that this is the way their world would end: 3 not with a bang, but with a whimper. 4 that is t.s. eliot, the poem "the hollow 5 men." that is why i said her world ended with a 6 whimper, not theirs. 7 but they feared it would. and they 8 did not fear for themselves and their physical 9 health or their moral obligation to their 10 fellow man; they feared for their money. and 11 today you will speak to them in the only 12 language they understand: money. 13 mr. geraghty: objection. 14 mr. keehfus: objection, your honor. 15 the court: sustained. 16 mr. geraghty: move to strike. 17 the court: the jury is to disregard the 18 last comment. 19 mr. schlesinger: so that is -- that is the 20 key points of the class. 21 and then there is one more thing on this. 22 there are two years here that do not matter and 23 there are two years here that do matter. and i 24 want to point to you the two years that do 25 matter and the two years that do not matter, and do this real quick as i go through it, all 2 right? 3 so, right here, she is smoking, and she is 4 smoking those winstons from the family. and 5 there is a couple of years in there. is it two 6 years? is it three years? when did she 7 switch, '58? when was she smoking, '53? 8 we have enough evidence, the family lore, 9 the husband who, when he first ever met her, 10 she was a smoker. those two years matter for 11 mr. keehfus' client, for reynolds, because they 12 initiate and sustain the addiction in that 13 youthful pediatric brain, that adolescent 14 brain, that the younger it is, the more 15 susceptible it is to the application and 16 exposure of nicotine. so she was the most 17 vulnerable then. 18 and you cannot revise history and say, if 19 she did not smoke those winstons and it never 20 happened in those few years, things would have 21 automatically been the same, because maybe she 22 would have met a boyfriend that did not smoke. 23 you do not know what she would have done in '57 24 or '58 if she had never smoked. maybe she 25 would have been more mature, she would have had a chance. but they cannot speculate it would not 2 have made a difference. 3 but i can tell you that those two years, 4 according to dr. difranza, a world-renowned 5 professor and legitimate expert, dedicating his 6 life, heroically, to the study and scourges of 7 addiction, told you that those years matter. 8 even dr. gup said those years matter and every 9 cigarette causes you harm. so those are the 10 two years that matter. 11 the two years that do not matter, that we 12 heard quite a bit about as mr. geraghty put 13 forth his side of the story, his version that 14 is the defense he -- he wants to suggest you 15 consider, and that is -- oops -- and that is 16 here (indicating). 17 this is my right hand where the laser is; 18 this is my left hand where the clicker is. 19 sorry. 20 1994, in july, she is got lung cancer from 21 smoking, from tobacco addiction, a devastating 22 six months to live. i mean, just -- that is -- 23 that is -- 24 you are now staring at the abyss. it is 25 over. we cannot -- we cannot save you. we cannot cut it out of you. you are 53 years old. 2 fifty-three years old. 3 in 1992, joe had a heart attack. joe had 4 a heart attack, and that should have served as 5 the warning, despite their denials to the 6 contrary, that she should have quit at that 7 time? the two years that did not matter. 8 you heard dr. gup. cancer was growing in 9 her lungs in 1992. she could not smoke 10 cigarettes, a pack to two packs a day for 38 11 years, and take this supposed warning -- 12 which, by the way, the tobacco companies 13 would publicly say joe's condition was not 14 caused by cigarettes, if anyone said his -- 15 mr. keehfus: objection. 16 mr. schlesinger: -- heart attack's 17 caused by cigarettes. 18 the court: sustained. 19 mr. keehfus: move to strike. 20 the court: the jury -- 21 mr. schlesinger: the evidence in -- 22 the court: excuse me. it is stricken. 23 mr. schlesinger: the evidence in the 24 case is they denied all forms of diseases were 25 being caused by cigarettes up through '94. the point is, '92 is the two years that 2 do not matter, because trying to say that is when 3 she should have quit or that she was negligent 4 in not quitting then, does not take into account 5 the reality of the science, okay? 6 now, again, here it is. diagnosis, class 7 member. what did dr. gup say? a treating 8 physician, a legitimate guy that met her, 9 treated her in 1994. his only interest was 10 helping her, understanding what was wrong with 11 her, a specialist who spends so much of his 12 time with the diseases and scourges of this 13 problem. 14 and he said, in no uncertain terms, she is 15 got a two-pack history a day for 40 years, a 16 one pack for the last month. 17 remember, she was coughing and coughing 18 up blood, so she cut down smoking for a month 19 while she is fixing to be dying of cancer. and 20 then she is got left lung cancer, the chronic 21 obstructive pulmonary disease, and tobacco 22 addiction. 23 24 25 follows:) q. when you wrote in your very first visit 2 with her, after assessing her, your impression of 3 bronchogenic cancer on the left, copd, and tobacco 4 addiction, that was all written in one place at one 5 time. why did you write all three of those together? 6 a. to show that the cancer is due to the 7 tobacco addiction. 8 (video clip concluded.) 9 mr. schlesinger: now, this is a treating 10 doctor. this is the hook they cannot get off 11 of. that is class membership. was she a 12 floridian? was she a heavy smoker? was she 13 addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes? did 14 that nicotine drive that compulsive smoking to 15 result in disease? 16 the answer from an unimpeachable, 17 credible, caring physician, no axe to grind, no 18 stake in the outcome, someone who is there at 19 the time -- and what i've heard said, 20 "documentation trumps conversation" -- he wrote 21 it down 22 years ago -- thank you, dr. gup -- 22 because we have that evidence here, and that is 23 all you need, because you do not have to make a 24 mountain out of a molehill. 25 the threshold requirement of class membership is proven. it is -- look at all the 2 smoking. this is -- 3 we did not show you all the records. this 4 is in the records you have in evidence. you 5 can try to dig through them and see it; but all 6 through the records, she is documented not only 7 by dr. gup, but by everybody who saw her in 8 july, in august, of being a long-term heavy 9 smoker, okay? 10 forty -- 40 years, a pack-per-day smoker, 11 one pack per day, two packs -- two packs per 12 day for 40 years, one pack per day her last 13 month. 14 did she -- did she say she quit somewhere 15 in the record a couple of weeks ago? 16 so, 8/18, she said she quit. that means 17 that, for several weeks after her lung cancer 18 diagnosis, she is smoking. and what did dr. gup 19 see in august? that she was still smoking. 20 and lori was sneaking her cigarettes. 21 and what did we hear? people sneak 22 cigarettes because they are embarrassed to do 23 it. when you are dying of lung cancer, maybe 24 your other family members are going to get on 25 you about that. so lori was doing it, she was sneaking 2 cigarettes. the other family members did not 3 see it or did not know about it. that means it 4 did not happen? 5 these are the eyewitnesses to what, back 6 then, was a mundane activity. we are asking 7 folks to remember what happened 20, 30, 40, 50 8 years ago, in what was a perfectly normal -- 9 like, tell me about brushing your teeth. 10 tell me about, you know, how you are making -- 11 you are making your coffee. tell me about your 12 coffee cup. 13 the medical records document that this 14 woman was a long-time heavy smoker, so -- 15 and what did -- what did her -- what did 16 her daughter say? 17 18 19 follows:) 20 q. so where did she keep the cigarette pack 21 that she was smoking? 22 a. wherever she was. if she was in the 23 kitchen, she would keep them on the kitchen counter. 24 if she was in the living room, sitting down, they 25 would be next to her on a coffee table or side table. q. okay. 2 a. in her bedroom, she had an ashtray right 3 next to her bed on the nightstand. 4 i do not recall if she smoked in the 5 bathroom, obviously, because the door was closed, so i 6 do not know about that, but... 7 (video clip concluded.) 8 mr. schlesinger: okay. so the point is, 9 cigarettes were everywhere. 10 and this next -- this next one, i'm not 11 going to play it; but, basically, it talked 12 about the fact that they were -- 13 one of the debates was, well, you know, 14 was she having withdrawal. you know, when 15 she -- when she was trying to quit, after she 16 had a lung cancer diagnosis, after they are 17 radiating her, cutting her open like a fish, 18 giving her morphine, and all kinds of narcotic 19 pain medications, did you notice that she had 20 withdrawal symptoms? right? and you did not 21 see her having withdrawal symptoms. 22 a lady's dying, she is in excruciating 23 distress, the family is traumatized by the pain 24 of it and someone's supposed to be 25 distinguishing withdrawal symptoms? this clip, which i'll skip, talks -- 2 and you may remember it, because i do not 3 want to subject you to too much more than the 4 three hours of lisa you already heard, but she 5 says it was a combination of all the things, 6 you could not separate out what part was -- was 7 craving or irritability or -- or desire; but 8 the fact that she was sneaking her cigarettes 9 meant that, despite she was dying, she really 10 wanted those cigarettes. 11 so it is not realistic to try to say, hey, 12 everything's great. you know, one of the 13 things -- 14 did you use smoking-cessation aids? and 15 i listened to her, i listened to her, i 16 listened to her say, smoking -- 17 did she use the patch? 18 the patch did not even come out over the 19 counter until 1996, after she was dead. these 20 were not available. and they blocked the 21 introduction of the merrell dow nicotine gum, 22 and we will talk about that. 23 but did you use the patch, the patch that 24 was not available until 1996? and, no, we 25 did not use the patch. no, we used another cessation method. what was that? lung cancer. 2 to a tobacco industry, is that what is a 3 cessation method, lung cancer? fear of death? 4 mr. varner, he quit smoking cigarettes in 5 '92 because the doc said you are going to die. 6 well, what -- if someone says you are going 7 to -- 8 that is what -- that is what it takes to 9 get someone to quit? that is addiction. that is 10 dependence on a drug. 11 i'll skip that. 12 now, class membership. and you will not 13 see this in the jury instructions, or question 14 1 on the verdict form about class membership. 15 you will not see the word "choice," "personal 16 responsibility," "fun," "pleasure." 17 "something wonderful happens." can you 18 imagine an old tv show of a beautiful woman, 19 julie london, singing "something wonderful 20 happens?" 21 what is wonderful? getting lung cancer? 22 getting emphysema? dying? where is the truth 23 in advertising? they do not advertise the true 24 realities of what tobacco does to folks. 25 and when you get to class membership, none of these things here have anything to do 2 with class membership, especially fault. and 3 that is important to remember that -- that there 4 is -- 5 you do not want to let there be a 6 conflation, a conflating of -- of 7 addiction/dependence driving disease that puts 8 you in the -- in the class with a simple 9 threshold, demonstrated by dr. gup's record, 10 and the idea of, you enjoyed it, you should 11 have tried harder to quit, things like that. 12 we will talk about that. 13 but, here, it does not matter if addiction 14 was the only cause. whether addicts can and do 15 quit, that goes to fault. whether they share 16 responsibility, whether making cigarettes is 17 legal, as dr. proctor said, it is not legal to 18 give it to -- to children. 19 exactly when a -- a smoker understands 20 the dangers of smoking, the reliance on 21 statements, whether addicts say "i like 22 smoking," "i'm going to die, anyway," whether 23 they enjoy the drug they are addicted to, that 24 is not class membership and the judge is not 25 going to instruct you that way. and then here's dr. ticknor. and i'm not 2 going to -- 3 i can spend a lot of time on him, but i'm 4 not going to spend a lot of time on him because 5 i'll tell you what they say in texas. old 6 saying among the ranchers. it is called -- 7 when they are -- when they are up there and 8 they are puffing and they are -- and they are -- 9 and they are exaggerating their credentials 10 or -- or what they have, or braggadocious, 11 right? very -- very well-known saying, texas 12 way -- and he is from texas -- "big hat, no 13 cattle." "big hat, no cattle." 14 and dr. ticknor gave you some anecdotal 15 story about something he did, that does not make 16 him a true expert, we believe the evidence 17 shows, in this condition; but it does make him 18 an impossible mathematician, because if you 19 find that of the most addicted smokers, as 20 dr. difranza said, the engle class members that 21 come -- 22 mr. geraghty: objection, your honor. 23 mr. schlesinger: -- and sue -- 24 the court: what is the objection? 25 mr. geraghty: reference to other class members. 2 the court: sustained. 3 mr. schlesinger: dr. difranza -- 4 mr. geraghty: move to strike. 5 the court: jury is to disregard. 6 mr. schlesinger: dr. difranza was asked 7 a question about did he find other folks 8 addicted; and when they asked him why, he -- in 9 the engle class, he said it was because they 10 were the most addicted who had died of lung 11 cancer and other diseases of smoking. 12 that is testimony from dr. difranza. i'll 13 find it, read it to you. but the fact is, is 14 that he also said that 95 percent of smokers 15 out there are addicted. 16 the numbers creep up if you are dealing 17 with a concentrated class of the most addicted, 18 heaviest smokers that succumb to diseases; but 19 according to dr. ticknor, if you do the math, 20 right, if you do the math, to get -- 21 if it is one in 20 out of a regular group 22 of folks that are not dependent on nicotine in 23 cigarettes from smoking like a pack a day, then 24 it is one in 20 -- so that is .05 -- and if you 25 take .05 and you multiply it -- times itself 18 times, that is .05 raised to the power of 18 -- 2 you get that the chances -- the mathematical 3 chances of dr. ticknor's 18 smokers who were -- 4 none of whom were addicted is one in 260 5 septillion. 6 that is the biggest number i've ever said 7 in a courtroom. one in 260 septillion. 8 hundreds, thousands, millions, billions, 9 trillions, quadrillions, quintillions, 10 sextillions, septillions, okay, which means 11 it is impossible. it means it cannot be true. 12 that is the number of stars in the known 13 observable universe. so it is not realistic. 14 if you change the number and you put it 15 down to 75 percent or eighty percent addiction 16 rate, if you put it down to an eighty percent -- a 17 75 percent addiction rate, the odds are one in 18 69 billion. 19 you would be 230 times more likely to win 20 the powerball lottery. those odds are one in 21 292 billion -- billion. so, even at 22 75 percent, even at what mr. -- what 23 christopher ticknor said was his fifty percent 24 rate, which dr. difranza, the true expert 25 talked about, the folks -- he is an expert at a subject. 2 dr. ticknor, by virtue of graduating 3 school and going into the expert witness 4 business, is an expert at being a witness; but 5 the fact is, is that one in -- 6 if it is a fifty percent addiction rate, then 7 it is still one in a quarter-million, which is 8 about the likelihood of being struck by 9 lightning -- 10 mr. keehfus: objection, your honor. 11 mr. schlesinger: -- in the united 12 states. 13 the court: overruled. 14 mr. schlesinger: so that is considered 15 extremely improbable. 16 so that is why i told you that you may say 17 to yourself, well, how can his -- how can 18 his honor, judge murphy, let this guy say what 19 he says? 20 mr. geraghty: objection. 21 the court: excuse me. 22 mr. schlesinger: how can he let them -- 23 mr. geraghty: i would object to that and 24 make a motion. 25 mr. schlesinger: i -- the court: excuse me. 2 mr. schlesinger: i will -- 3 the court: excuse me, counsel. let me 4 finish before you start talking -- 5 mr. schlesinger: yes, sir. 6 the court: -- all right? it is -- 7 the objection's sustained, it is stricken. 8 the jury is to disregard the last comment. 9 mr. schlesinger: sorry, judge. 10 i was being rhetorical. what i mean is, 11 this jury instruction -- 12 look, today, you all have great power in 13 this. this is a great leveling of a playing 14 field, great power. 15 mr. geraghty: objection to the phrase 16 "leveling of a playing field." 17 the court: sustained. 18 mr. schlesinger: and, in that regard, 19 the power is given to you by the law. and some 20 of the law that gives you the power includes 21 the believability of witnesses instructions, 22 one of which is, when someone characterizes 23 themselves as an expert, you think about 24 everything -- the knowledge, skill, training, 25 experience, the bias, the money they earn, everything about that -- and then you give that 2 testimony the weight you think it deserves; or, 3 when it comes to experts, because they are a 4 special class in the courtroom, you may reject 5 it. 6 so the reason i'm not going to spend a 7 lot of time on chris ticknor is because we hope 8 the evidence shows he was not worthy of belief, 9 his testimony should be rejected. 10 and, do not forget, when dr. proctor 11 talked about the way in which and some of the 12 reasons why the tobacco industry way back when, 13 years ago -- 14 mr. geraghty: objection, your honor. 15 mr. keehfus: objection. 16 the court: sustained. 17 mr. geraghty: i would object. 18 mr. schlesinger: dr. -- i'm talking 19 about what -- 20 dr. proctor conferred with you on 21 internal documents, secret documents. this is 22 one of the documents in evidence. 23 mr. geraghty: i object and ask that we 24 approach on this very briefly. 25 mr. schlesinger: hold my time, please. (the following discussion was held at 2 sidebar:) [#deleted sidebar#] 14 mr. schlesinger: all right. may i get 15 set and pick up my time, judge? 16 the court: counsel, we have a running 17 clock here. 18 mr. schlesinger: yep. so -- 19 the court: you may proceed. 20 mr. schlesinger: the clock runs when 21 you are in the penalty box, okay? it is like 22 hockey. in any event, i'll keep going. 23 dr. proctor talked about the purpose and 24 the role that a lot of their work played -- 25 he talked about the pillars of the conspiracy. remember he drew the eight-armed 2 octopus and all the different elements that 3 went into keeping this conspiracy going? 4 one of them was a very important element 5 of it way back in those days, because they did 6 not want to be held responsible for the damage 7 they were doing. so a big part of their 8 conspiracy was to hold off and -- and defend in 9 litigations way back then, and dr. proctor -- 10 mr. geraghty: i would -- i would object, 11 your honor. 12 the court: overruled. 13 mr. geraghty: move to strike. 14 mr. schlesinger: the industry research 15 effort has included special projects designed 16 to find scientists and medical doctors who 17 might serve as industry witnesses in 18 legislative -- in lawsuits or in legislative 19 forums. and, you know, he talked about the 20 three pillars of the conspiracy: public 21 opinion, legislation, and litigation. 22 and it makes sense, if you know you are 23 making a product that is killing a substantial 24 number of your customers and you are replacing 25 them with youth, which is a pretty incendiary thing to put in the documents, and you are 2 doing it for profit, clear-eyed, straight 3 ahead, you have decided to do that, you are also 4 trying to do what you can to stave off 5 regulation and any other ripple effects, any 6 repercussions of what you are doing. and this 7 is a document that shows that. 8 addiction is the legal cause if it 9 contributes substantially. and the question 10 is, did the addiction play an important role? 11 the question is, if she was not addicted 12 to nicotine, would she have compulsively smoked 13 cigarettes all day long, from first thing in 14 the morning till first thing -- the last thing 15 at night, every day for 40 years? 16 basically, put another way, because they 17 admit -- now they admit -- 18 mr. keehfus: objection. 19 mr. schlesinger: -- she got lung 20 cancer -- 21 the court: what is the objection? 22 mr. keehfus: "now they admit." 23 the court: overruled. 24 mr. schlesinger: now they admit, in this 25 courtroom, about this case, that our client smoked enough cigarettes to get lung cancer and 2 emphysema and die. but if you are admitting 3 that my client -- 4 if you acknowledge that my client, that 5 joe's wife, that virginia smoked enough 6 cigarettes to get lung cancer and die, but they 7 would have you believe that she was not 8 dependent not one day in her life, that none of 9 that cigarette smoking was driven by the sine 10 qua non of their existence -- that without 11 which there is nothing, the center of their 12 universe, nicotine -- we would argue that that 13 does not stand to reason, and hope you see that 14 our way. 15 that is why we say "a" versus "the." it 16 is not whether it was the cause, whether it was 17 a cause; meaning, can you be addicted and still 18 enjoy your drugs? lots of drug addicts enjoy 19 their drugs. 20 the funny thing about -- 21 the tragic thing about tobacco was, for 22 so many years, it was a secret addiction. 23 folks did not know why. sales were meteorically 24 going up, the people were smoking it up like 25 silly, and did not understand that it was a drug that was controlling them. that is what 2 dr. koop said. we will play that. 3 so here's a quick way of applying facts 4 to the law: you can see addiction causes 5 continued smoking, lung cancer and death; but 6 look at the other things that can also 7 contribute to cause: stress, enjoyment, 8 pleasure, what have you. that is why it need 9 not be the only cause. 10 let us look at it this way: imagine the 11 cigarettes -- 12 because cigarettes are addictive. the 13 engle findings says cigarettes are addictive. 14 it does not say "they might be," "sometimes," 15 "they could be," "maybe," "they could be once 16 but we cannot find that guy." 17 it is not a theoretical concept; it is the 18 reality of the world, it is the truth of 19 science, and it is what we know now. and the 20 more they study it, the more they see it 21 changes your brain permanently. 22 but here -- here's a way of taking the 23 concurring cause instruction, which can confuse 24 you when you see it in paper, and making a 25 pictograph. in order to be a legal cause of lung 2 cancer and death, cigarettes, addictive 3 cigarettes, addiction to cigarettes -- that is 4 what is represented by that imagery there -- may 5 not be the only cause. 6 the addiction to cigarettes may be a 7 legal cause of lung cancer even though it 8 operates in combination with fun, pleasure, the 9 joy of smoking, if such fun, pleasure, taste -- 10 taste -- 11 no taste buds in the lung, but it is 12 delicious in the mouth. it is a delicious taste 13 even though the lungs cannot taste, right? 14 inhalation is what makes addiction unleash the 15 dragon of addiction. 16 -- if such fun occurs at the same time as 17 the addiction to cigarettes, and that the 18 addiction to cigarettes contributes 19 substantially to producing lung cancer. 20 and there is the death certificate. death 21 from lung cancer. there is a way of looking at 22 that. it is not all or nothing. it is not a 23 cause -- it is not the cause, it is a cause. 24 and what did dr. difranza say? does 25 addiction kill? i mean, in simple terms, does addiction kill? yes, addiction kills. 2 how about nicotine addiction? that kills 3 more than any other addiction. the number one 4 killer in the united states. more people are 5 dying right now in the united states from this. 6 we are at the peak of death in -- in this 7 year. more people are dying than have ever 8 died before of cigarettes, and they are dying 9 more than all those other scourges combined. a 10 hundred times more than heroin addicts. more 11 than aids and automobile accidents and 12 homicides and terrible things all combined. 13 the number one killer in this country are 14 cigarettes. it hides in plain sight. it is an 15 irrational madness to have a product that kills 16 over half of its users reliably, over a half 17 million people in the united states. 18 this here (indicating), this is less than 19 a summer's supply of marlboro cigarettes. 20 seven cartons. seven weeks. ten packs a 21 carton, 20 cigarettes a pack, seven cartons, 22 1400 cigarettes. that is today's death toll. 23 today, while we do this case, from 24 morning to night, 1400 people -- 25 mr. geraghty: objection, your honor. mr. schlesinger: -- will die -- 2 the court: sustained. 3 mr. schlesinger: -- from 4 cigarette-related -- 5 mr. geraghty: move to strike -- 6 the court: sustained. 7 mr. geraghty: -- your honor. 8 mr. schlesinger: okay. 1400 people a 9 day die from cigarettes. 10 mr. geraghty: objection -- objection, 11 your honor. 12 the court: i sustain the objection -- 13 mr. schlesinger: that is the evidence. 14 the court: -- counsel. 15 mr. schlesinger: in any event, that 16 represents 1400 cigarettes. 17 so, as dr. difranza said, did nicotine 18 addiction kill virginia varner? yes. but for 19 her being addicted to nicotine, would she be 20 alive today with her husband, more likely than 21 not? you bet. 22 he says: if she had not been addicted to 23 nicotine, she never would have gotten lung 24 cancer. that is for sure. 25 let us play this, please. 2 3 follows:) 4 voice: i would say it is just as 5 addictive as heroin or cocaine. 6 our nation has mobilized enormous 7 resources to wage a war on drugs, illicit 8 drugs. we should also give priority to the one 9 addiction, tobacco addiction, that is killing 10 more than 300,000 americans each year. 11 (video clip concluded.) 12 mr. schlesinger: so, back in that period 13 of time, it was said by the surgeon general 14 koop at the time -- this is in the '88 15 period -- that tobacco addiction is killing 16 more than 300,000 americans a year; and he goes 17 on to say, we now understand what -- what has 18 been robbing them of their free choice. it is a 19 drug. what is controlling them? it is a drug. 20 and then this here is the memo -- and 21 this is the memo -- it is in evidence, you will 22 have it, it is two pages -- and it is from -- 23 it is september 9th, 1980, from kloepfer to 24 knopick. 25 and these are the folks -- the president and vice president of the tobacco institute, 2 one of those lobbying arms, one of the fronts 3 and shields in the conspiracy. and it is dated 4 september 9th, 1980. and they say: we cannot 5 defend continued smoking as a free choice if 6 the person was addicted. 7 this is what they were saying internally. 8 this is how they described where they were 9 internally. but what is interesting about this 10 is, when you read this entire document, which 11 you can -- 12 you know, we are giving you snippets, but 13 this will be marked. it is pt2184. it will 14 have a folder, it will say "pt2184." 15 if you want to read it, their concern was 16 about a surprise story that the national 17 institute of drug abuse wanted "addictive" 18 added to the cigarette warning, and that 19 cigarette smoking is a -- is a dependence 20 process and cigarette smoking is addictive, and 21 that it was more addictive than using heroin. 22 and -- and they say: the tobacco 23 institute missed a chance to attend and present 24 information at nida meeting which was 25 developing the addictive language. i feel badly about my own lack of 2 intelligence-gathering in this situation, but 3 these questions are not academic. the lawyers 4 remind us, the entire matter of addiction is 5 the most potent weapon a prosecuting attorney 6 can have in a lung cancer/cigarette case. we 7 cannot defend smoking as free choice if the 8 person was addicted. 9 that was in 1980. it was not even until 10 '88 or '89 where dr. koop came out and labeled 11 it addictive. 12 so, for 25 years, after the 1960s, when 13 they said our -- we are in the nicotine delivery 14 business, it is -- the cigarette is not the 15 product, the cigarette is the package, it is a 16 nicotine-delivery device, the product is 17 nicotine, nicotine is addictive, for over 25 18 years, the surg- -- the -- the public health 19 authority did not come out and declare that 20 publicly. 21 and, by that time, the hook sets deep. 22 folks can be very addicted by that time. so 23 that is in evidence. 24 all right. let me see if i can find 25 this. okay, yeah, i know where i am. let me -- 2 judge, we can take a break right now. 3 i'm at about 45 minutes. we can take a break 4 right now. 5 the court: all right. ladies and 6 gentlemen, we are going to take our -- a short 7 recess. do not discuss the case, do not form 8 any opinion about the case, do not allow anyone 9 to discuss the case in your presence. just 10 leave your notepads and the jury instructions 11 on your chairs. do not do any research on the 12 case. we will be back with you shortly. 13 (jury exited the courtroom at 10:48 a.m.) 14 the court: all right. let the record 15 reflect the jury has been excused; counsel 16 remain. 17 now, counsel, subsequent to our 18 discussion sidebar, where i was telling you to 19 take a break, one of the court reporters 20 indicated to me she did not have to change just 21 yet. i'm -- i'm trying to figure out when 22 we are going to make this change, so -- [#deleted recess#] 25 proceed. mr. schlesinger: thank you, judge. 2 all right. folks, one thing i skipped 3 over, i must touch on with you so we -- so we 4 are definitive and certain. 5 despite what you heard in opening 6 statement or any misimpressions it may have 7 conveyed, you must know that in this case, my 8 client, mr. varner, did not delay filing his 9 lawsuit in any way, because the case was filed 10 in 1994, just a month after the ceos testified 11 in congress down here in miami. 12 that was the class action. it worked its 13 way through the courts, and it was -- 14 mr. geraghty: i object, your honor. 15 the court: sustained. 16 mr. keehfus: make a motion. 17 mr. schlesinger: in 2006, the florida 18 supreme court decertified the class and 19 permitted individual lawsuits to be filed 20 within one year of its mandate -- that is the 21 finality, the supreme court's final, here's my 22 opinion, we have considered all motions -- 23 mr. geraghty: i object to any -- 24 mr. schlesinger: -- it is final, the 25 mandate. mr. geraghty: i object to anything 2 beyond the court's instruction. 3 the court: thank you. 4 mr. schlesinger: the mandate is the 5 finality of the florida supreme court's 6 opinion. 7 and it allowed folks from january 11th 8 of 2007, individuals from the class, from 9 january 11th of 2007 until january 11th of 10 2008, 365 calendar days, one year, to file an 11 engle class lawsuit. 12 this is one of those engle suits filed in 13 that proper and appropriate time frame. and 14 for no other reason. 15 mr. geraghty: objection, your honor, i 16 object to counsel's -- 17 the court: excuse me. 18 objection is overruled. 19 counsel, move on. 20 mr. schlesinger: yes. 21 so, the choice of defendants to market 22 tobacco known to be both addictive and 23 cancer-causing, raises the question of fault 24 reserved for questions 5 and 6 on the verdict 25 form. mr. geraghty: your honor, i object. 2 that is implied preemption. 3 the court: overruled. 4 mr. schlesinger: evidence of what the 5 tobacco company manufacturers knew about their 6 deadly product and when they knew it will be 7 important in answering that question. 8 the choice of a youngster, like virginia 9 varner, to use tobacco also raises the question 10 of fault reserved for questions 5 and 6. 11 the question of what did she know and 12 when did she know it will have to be addressed 13 by you at that time, but you cannot decide at 14 question 1 how much either side should be 15 faulted for their choices to market or use 16 tobacco, because they have not gotten to 17 questions 5 and 6 yet. 18 mr. keehfus: objection, statement of law 19 your honor. 20 the court: overruled. 21 mr. schlesinger: so why am i even 22 talking about choice when you have not reached 23 the fault question on the verdict form yet? 24 because the tobacco companies want to 25 suggest that virginia varner was not addicted. mr. geraghty: objection, your honor, to 2 what we want to suggest. 3 the court: sustained. 4 mr. schlesinger: but if you will not buy 5 that nonsense, there is -- 6 mr. geraghty: excuse me, i object, 7 your honor, motion, motion -- 8 the court: excuse me. i sustain the 9 objection. 10 argue the facts, argue the law. you 11 concern yourself with plaintiff's argument, 12 counsel. 13 mr. schlesinger: okay. 14 but if you do not accept that position, 15 there is a fall-back position. if she was 16 addicted, it was her choice to smoke long 17 enough to get sick; therefore, it was her 18 choice and not her addiction that caused her 19 copd, her lung cancer, and her death. 20 but not one piece of evidence was 21 presented by either side that virginia varner's 22 addiction was her choice. nobody chooses 23 addiction. it is often a terrible side effect 24 of the choice to smoke. 25 just like the addiction some people get from prescription pain relievers. no one 2 chooses that addiction. but it frequently 3 happens as an unintended consequence of the use 4 of the drug. lawful, but dangerous drugs, can 5 have awful side effects, side effects like 6 addiction. 7 that is why ordinary people often say 8 about tobacco or prescription pain relievers: 9 be careful, do not get hooked. 10 why do people say that? because 11 addiction is like a fish getting hooked. the 12 fish chooses to strike the bait, and then gets 13 caught by the hidden hook. the hook starts 14 pulling the fish along. the fish starts 15 fighting the hook and tries to get off. 16 fish that are only hooked through the lip 17 sometimes get away. but those who are hooked 18 through the side of the mouth are goners. 19 fishermen know all this. it is why they use 20 bait and hooks in the first place. 21 but no fisherman would ever tell you that 22 the fish was caught because the fish chose to 23 get hooked. the fish died because it did not 24 see the hook in the first place. 25 high speed lure, this marine -- you do not see the hook. it is a hidden hook. it is not 2 meant to be seen. it is supposed to look like 3 something enticing. it is not supposed to be 4 something that is going to kill you. 5 the 12-year-old, 13-year-old virginia 6 varner certainly did not see the hook. she 7 died january 1st, '95; 53 years old. 8 the tobacco companies did not tell their 9 customers that they thought cigarettes were 10 addictive until five years after virginia 11 varner died. 12 instead, they repeatedly told everyone 13 who could read there was a substantial 14 scientific controversy about whether cigarettes 15 were addictive, about whether cigarettes could 16 get you hooked. 17 there was no warning on a cigarette pack 18 until 1966, which was not even a warning. it 19 was a caution. 20 by that time, virginia varner was 25 21 years old. she would been addicted to smoking for 22 years. she was hooked. hooked badly. 23 she tried to get away, but did not. being 24 hooked eventually killed her. 25 now the tobacco companies want to tell you being hooked had nothing to do with the 2 death of virginia varner. that is a real fish 3 story, and they know it. 4 mr. keehfus: objection, your honor -- 5 the court: sustained. 6 mr. keehfus: -- motion. 7 mr. schlesinger: virginia varner chose 8 to smoke at a time when no one knew the real 9 dangers of addiction disease inherent in 10 cigarettes. 11 she started as a youth in approximately 12 1954. the advertising and movies that 13 attracted the young virginia varner never 14 mentioned addiction. never mentioned cancer. 15 she smoked for over 12 years before the 16 cigarettes even said -- before the cigarette 17 packs even said that cigarettes might -- might 18 be dangerous to your health. may be, they may 19 not be. 20 perfect keeping with the doubt campaign 21 voiced upon the american people by tobacco. 22 over a decade. in that amount of time, the 23 hook sets deep. very deep. 24 virginia varner will be pulled along by 25 that hook for more than 40 years. she tried to fight it, but she did not get off. 2 maybe some of you think that she should 3 have tried harder. that is fair. but that is 4 questions 5 and 6. that is fault. 5 right now, the defendants would suggest 6 that virginia varner was never hooked -- 7 mr. geraghty: objection, your honor, to 8 what the defendants would suggest. 9 the court: sustained. 10 mr. schlesinger: and if you do not accept 11 that, then they would present evidence to 12 suggest that being hooked in no way contributed 13 to her death. 14 common sense tells us that is not the 15 true, accurate evidence in this case. 16 the reason we all worry about getting 17 hooked is because addiction starts pulling you 18 along, it is hard to get away. if you do not get 19 away in time, you are dead. 20 that is what happened to virginia varner. 21 she did not get away in time. and at least one 22 of the important reasons for that was her 23 dependence to the drug nicotine in cigarettes. 24 and that nicotine was a substantial and 25 big factor in why she did not get away from cigarettes. 2 they ought to know it. they are the ones 3 that make cigarettes -- 4 mr. keehfus: objection, your honor. 5 the court: what is the objection? 6 mr. keehfus: attacking defense. 7 mr. schlesinger: so not true. 8 the court: thank you. 9 overruled. 10 mr. schlesinger: they are the ones that 11 make the cigarettes with the nicotine hook 12 built right in. sustain addiction, initiate 13 addiction, maintain addiction. you must have 14 precision amounts of nicotine. 15 now these defendants would offer evidence 16 that that hook has no role in pulling smokers 17 towards disease. 18 that is not believable if you see this our 19 way. they put nicotine in cigarettes, they 20 keep nicotine in cigarettes, because it keeps 21 their customers hooked. that way, they will buy 22 more cigarettes. 23 all the way to the end. they know that, 24 they want that, they keep the nicotine in their 25 products to keep doing that, getting people hooked. just like they hooked virginia varner 2 all the way to the end. 3 freedom of choice? what did claude 4 teague say? and i invite you to look at all of 5 claude teague's critical documents in this 6 case, because he was a brilliant man, and he 7 really captured the essence of the industry 8 with his recognition of the essential role of 9 nicotine, with the urgency to capture the share 10 of the youth market and all smoking begins at 11 youth. 12 his recognition in the '50s when he 13 reported to all his superiors that cigarette 14 smoking caused cancer. 15 but his pt numbers, the claude teague 16 documents, some thoughts on the youth market, 17 the crucial role of nicotine. read them. you 18 will see brilliance in action for a nefarious 19 purpose. but, nevertheless, brilliance in 20 action. 21 what did dr. teague say with specificity 22 about whether there was really freedom of 23 choice? 24 this is an internal document from the 25 '70s, when you are addicted. when you are not a free smoker. when you are a learner, when 2 you are a confirmed smoker, freedom to choose is 3 a negative. because they know you do not have 4 it. 5 easy as possible to start, hard as 6 possible to quit. that is the business model. 7 and all throughout, nicotine is 8 addictive. they have to have the habituating 9 levels of nicotine, they will liquidate their 10 business if they reduce or eliminate nicotine. 11 without nicotine, there would be no 12 smoking, and very few consumers -- this is 13 claude teague again -- very few consumers are 14 aware of the effects of nicotine; for instance, 15 its addictive nature. it goes on to say, and 16 that it is a poison. 17 remember when they were trying to come up 18 with ways to see if nicotine was addictive 19 internally in the research, and they said if 20 these results come out that way and it looks 21 like it is just as addictive as morphine, we are 22 going to bury those results and bury that 23 research. 24 remember dr. proctor told you about how 25 many documents they shredded. so for as many millions as we have and 2 for many lifetimes of careers of scholars to 3 read these tens and 50 or more million 4 documents, dr. proctor also reflected on how 5 many were destroyed. 6 this is an industry in the united states 7 doing this to folks. remember, they are human. 8 they are judged by you in human terms, but 9 they are also held to human obligations. if you 10 want to be treated like a person, act like a 11 person. 12 so they controlled the nicotine, they 13 freebase the nicotine. everything about it is 14 to make sure it maintains precise levels of 15 control. 16 and this is the explanation: that 17 different drugs that cause addiction exert 18 their effect in different ways. 19 dr. difranza showed this to you. the 20 king of dependence, meaning relapse, and 21 keeping smoking, and a lifetime of smoking for 22 four cigarettes. 23 remember that article that dr. difranza 24 talked about that he used in his studies by 25 dr. russell? the one who said that folks are no more likely -- without nicotine, folks are 2 no more likely to smoke cigarettes than they 3 would be to light sparklers or blow bubbles. 4 without nicotine, that is how much people 5 would be doing it. they would not be doing it 6 20 times a day, blowing bubbles and lighting 7 sparklers. 8 heroin gets you higher, cocaine has a 9 different withdrawal effect. alcohol can be 10 terrible delirium tremens. 11 but nicotine -- you cannot judge nicotine 12 and a disorder of nicotine about whether or not 13 you can do housework or whether or not you are 14 going to lose your job. right? 15 nobody would want their pilot getting on 16 a plane after spending an hour in the sky 17 lounge knocking back a few white russians. 18 they would not want him flying that plane. they 19 would not want to be on a plane flying with a 20 pilot who drank. 21 but nobody would mind getting on a plane 22 with a pilot who smoked a couple cigarettes. 23 and you do not lose your job from smoking 24 cigarettes in the '50s, '60s, '70s, and '80s, 25 where you can smoke at work, in hospitals. when the doctors smoked with you in the halls. 2 that was a normal process. 3 so we do not have cigarettes here. 4 but in the '80s, there would be 5 cigarettes burning all in the ashtrays in this 6 courtroom. the judges would be smoking, the 7 lawyers would be smoking, the jurors would be 8 smoking. that would be perfectly normal. it 9 was not banned, in hospitals or anywhere. 10 so presentism. think about the way 11 things were. and do not substitute the 12 addictive nature of alcohol and what it does to 13 assert its effects, with its intoxicating 14 effects or withdrawal effects, with nicotine, 15 which just makes you do it over and over and 16 over again to keep that nicotine level in your 17 body. 18 the evidence is overwhelming, the greater 19 weight of the evidence, that she was dependent. 20 so question 1 is checked off "yes." 21 and off you move. and i've spent more 22 time on this part than i wanted to, but off you 23 move. 24 and then the next one is, i told you the 25 two years that mattered. you will notice there is no such question for philip morris, because 2 question 1, philip morris, there is no doubt 30 3 years of smoking was definitely a 4 super-important contributor of her being 5 addicted and full of cancer and emphysema and 6 dying. 7 so that is already been determined as a 8 matter of law. no dispute. 9 however, reynolds -- and it is reasonable, 10 right, it is reasonable, that reynolds, with 11 only the beginning of her smoking career and 12 only a couple years, right, 1/20 of her 13 smoking career, that you-all should consider, 14 was it a legal cause; meaning, did it 15 contribute. 16 we believe, we hope that the evidence is 17 sufficient -- particularly from dr. difranza, 18 even dr. gup talked about it -- to have you 19 check that off and then they will bear their 20 relative proportion of responsibility from 21 there if you find that the answer to that 22 question is yes. 23 and under it is dr. difranza's answer. 24 and he explained that the cigarettes establish 25 her addiction, she is so young, a stronger addiction. and did that early role play a 2 significant role in her ultimate disease 3 development and death. 4 and he said it would be a critical 5 factor. and he is the youth smoking guy. 6 right? and he is contributed cutting edge, 7 niche knowledge. 8 it is an honor to bring -- you know, we 9 brought witnesses to you that we hoped honored 10 this process, men of great stature in their 11 professional communities, men of great 12 knowledge and wisdom. 13 and we hope to be able to do that so that 14 we could show you what they did and how they 15 built their career and why they deserved to be 16 giving the kind of opinions and getting some of 17 the kind of, you know, awards that they did. 18 and if they say things like they were 19 against smoking, it stands to reason. because 20 a police officer doing his job is against 21 crime. he is a crime fighter. 22 so saying, well, you believe that smoking 23 is something that should be abolished by, 24 dr. proctor, well, it is a clear-minded, 25 rational concept. that to him, it makes no sense that cigarettes should exist. they kill 2 over half their users. that just makes sense. 3 so trying to say that should undermine 4 you or impair your credibility does not stand to 5 reason any more than dr. difranza, who sees the 6 scourge of the effect on children and does not 7 want it to happen. 8 you know, it is a legitimate, it is a 9 lofty, it is a laudable goal to pursue. 10 these are the instructions. you have got 11 them. you will have them back there with you. 12 but this is as if you found them yourself. 13 these are undeniable findings. they cannot be 14 denied. 15 this is how we got here. this is the 16 long journey to justice. this is -- 17 mr. geraghty: objection; not in 18 evidence, your honor. 19 the court: excuse me. 20 objection is noted. it is overruled. 21 mr. schlesinger: the findings, the jury 22 decision, the law, the facts, the supreme court 23 mandate, and now they are yours. now we hand 24 them to you, and we ask you to please use them 25 for all considerations. after question 1 is answered, for all 2 considerations, is what they did reprehensible? 3 this helps you understand the nature -- 4 mr. keehfus: objection, your honor, 5 statement of the law. 6 the court: overruled. this is argument. 7 mr. schlesinger: they are guilty of 8 fraud, they are guilty of conspiracy. that is 9 been found. you all know it. dr. proctor 10 testified about it extensively. 11 it was extremely successful. they 12 celebrated it. twenty years later, said it was 13 a brilliantly conceived holding strategy, and 14 it is helped us win many battles and many 15 victories. and they were -- they celebrated 16 it. 17 so then we talk about the fraud and 18 conspiracy and how this affects my client, as 19 you are working your way to the punitive 20 damages. 21 and you will see that you have to answer 22 these questions about whether or not the fraud 23 and the conspiracy affected virginia varner, 24 one of many millions, one of the folks who did 25 exactly what they expected her to do, behaved exactly like they wanted her to do. 2 she was the perfect smoker. she was the 3 customer she [sic] wanted. she was a lifelong 4 smoker. 5 talking about other members of her family 6 who may have become sick and succumbed to 7 cigarettes in a multigenerational catastrophe 8 is not a successful piece of evidence for the 9 defendants to put on. 10 mr. geraghty: objection, your honor. 11 the court: no personal opinions, 12 counsel. 13 mr. schlesinger: it speaks to the 14 tragedy of cigarettes. we talk about harm to 15 others. the punitive damages instruction says 16 you can consider harm to others. 17 not only the 20 million who were killed 18 nationwide since the '60s from cigarettes in 19 assessing the degree of wrongfulness of the 20 harm. but also just the people around that 21 they mention, what about this one and what 22 about this family member? that is harm to 23 others. 24 so it actually supports the notion of 25 finding them and punishing them if they are telling you that other members of the family 2 got sick from cigarettes. 3 it is a multigenerational catastrophe, and 4 you can consider it that way. 5 so, this reliance, this -- i smoked 6 filters. her actions speak louder than her 7 words. she smoked that which was the 8 psychological crutch, giving the illusion of 9 filtration so you would think there was 10 selective filtration. 11 the marlboro ads are selectrate filter. 12 and mr. geraghty skillfully asked my 13 client mr. varner, saying: well, did not you 14 know that smoke was still coming through those 15 cigarettes when you smoked them? 16 yeah, but the only thing that he thought 17 was coming through was what the tobacco 18 companies told them was coming through, and it 19 was the fun and the taste and the pleasure and 20 the enjoyment. 21 and these sciencey-sounding filters, 22 which we do not agree there was anything bad in 23 there. if there is anything bad, we will find 24 out what it is, we will take it out. 25 but in the meantime, here is our 20,000 filter traps. here is our selectrate filter, 2 which will selectively remove the bad stuff and 3 only let the fun, the enjoyment, the pleasure, 4 and the taste come through. 5 so mr. varner is not supposed to know 6 technically it is a marketing gimmick. 7 so their behavior, their actions speak 8 louder than words. they fell for the filter 9 fraud, like millions like them, and they relied 10 on this fraud, and it contributed to cause that 11 ongoing smoking. 12 it was the psychological crutch that kept 13 smokers that might be worried. 14 there was no evidence that she was really 15 worried. she was doing what she thought was 16 normal. 17 like her son said, joe, jr.: we sat 18 around, we ate dinner, we drank coffee, we 19 watched tv, we smoked cigarettes, we laughed. 20 that was normal. it was -- you know, 21 sitting here today, if this room was full of 22 smoke, it might not seem that way. 23 and the point is, is that all the 24 information out there, the snowflake in the 25 snowstorm, that the overwhelming message from tobacco was out there. it was designed to 2 reach populations, of which virginia varner was 3 one. 4 it does not have to be direct. it can be 5 circuitous. as long as they meant to get it 6 out there with the intent that she rely on it, 7 she is entitled to be found to rely, because 8 would it have been important to her? 9 and we will play this. 10 11 12 follows:) 13 q. and then they wanted to also reassure the 14 public that there was no proof of the claims between 15 smoking and lung cancer, correct? 16 a. they -- they -- they did want that 17 message to get out. yes, that is correct. 18 (video clip concluded.) 19 mr. schlesinger: so that was their 20 intent. that is one of the findings. 21 and guess what? it worked. it worked. 22 every cigarette to this day -- almost every 23 cigarette has got a fake filter on it, a 24 marketing gimmick, a scam, a dupe, a dodge. 25 color-changing filters by claude teague with the invention. 2 and it is a hard illusion to break. an 3 entire country and -- smoking this. does not do 4 anything. it does not do a thing. 5 that is a heck of a successful illusion, 6 and it kept millions of folks smoking. and -- 7 8 9 follows:) 10 voice: i've been reading a lot about it 11 in the paper, but i do not know anyone actually 12 who has gotten cancer. of course the fact that 13 it was smoking, come out and proved in black 14 and white. 15 voice: they come out and really say, 16 well, you are going to get it, i'll stop then. 17 but when they just keep on saying some say you 18 do, some you do not, i'll just keep on. 19 voice: you know they say it causes 20 cancer and heart disease. do you believe that? 21 voice: no, i do not. not in my heart. i 22 cannot believe it. if i look back at it, 23 peoples that make the cigarettes, i feel like 24 the one that make the cigarettes should know 25 what they doing. voice: throughout your tenure with 2 american, it was not only american's position 3 but your position that cigarettes were not 4 injurious to health. 5 is that accurate? 6 voice: through my tenure? 7 voice: yes. 8 voice: yes, that is so. 9 voice: that is something american tobacco 10 wanted the public to believe; is that correct? 11 voice: yes. 12 voice: it is a statement that american 13 tobacco placed great reliance on. 14 voice: we issued that statement, yes. 15 we [indiscernible] believe it. 16 voice: as far as you are concerned, a 17 person is justified in relying on that 18 statement. 19 voice: yes. 20 (video clip concluded.) 21 mr. schlesinger: reliance goes both 22 ways. they relied on her relying on them. 23 like an organic chemistry equation. it is a 24 balance in equilibrium. with an arrow going 25 that way, an arrow going that way. they relied on her reliance and millions like her, and it 2 worked. 3 think about this. they made promises 4 they would stop making it. they made promises 5 they would stop making it, if it was ever proven to 6 be bad. and it certainly has been proven to be 7 bad, but they never stopped making it. 8 mr. keehfus: objection, your honor. 9 the court: sustained. 10 mr. keehfus: motion. 11 mr. geraghty: we join. 12 mr. schlesinger: okay. so we talked 13 about reliance. there was some testimony about 14 it, about the water turning brown and them 15 thinking that the stuff was coming out that was 16 bad. you heard that testimony. 17 and what did dr. teague say? okay? the 18 public attaches great significance -- remember 19 the color-changing filter trick -- to the color 20 changes. and even though they said it would 21 have no effect, the advantages and sales 22 advantages are obvious. 23 they believed that that brown stuff 24 coming out of the back of those filters made a 25 difference. that is reliance. that is a contribution to that. they thought they could 2 rely on it. they thought the bad stuff was 3 coming out. that is exactly what teague and 4 everyone else expected. 5 and then -- i'm going to skip this. 6 okay? you have heard him, dr. cullman. and, 7 again, a merchandising proposition, the public 8 attaches great significance to the color 9 change. that is teague. 10 you cannot really selectively filter. 11 we will tell people: here's a triple, quadruple 12 or quintuple filter capable of removing 13 whatever constituents in smoke is suspect. oh, 14 and that document, pt036615, ends with "and 15 incidentally, a nice jolt of nicotine." do not 16 forget the nicotine. 17 and, of course, the illusion of 18 filtration is as important as the fact of 19 filtration. that is just the truth of the 20 industry's fraud, deception. 21 health reassurance fraud, keep people 22 smoking, psychological crutch, and it worked. 23 and they admit they are liars, right here: we 24 are making false and misleading statements to 25 promote the sale of cigarettes. this was way back in the '60s. they knew 2 what they were up to. they did not care. they 3 were not trying to help people. 4 lies cost lives. that is one of my ways 5 of saying why things are reliance. if you lie 6 to people, it results in death. it causes 7 folks to die. it causes folks to count on 8 them. 9 the engle instruction says they made 10 these fraudulent. they conspired. they 11 breathed together. they put forth a fraudulent 12 concealment campaign to keep folks from fully 13 understanding what was going on with the idea, 14 the intent that the public relied. 15 and smoking rates kept going up all the 16 way through the early to mid '80s. kept going 17 up. 18 so this is reliance. because if lies 19 cost lives, virginia was one of those lives. 20 look at all the things they hid from her: 21 that there was never a controversy. doubt, 22 that there is all these poisons in the 23 cigarettes. hundreds of thousands of people 24 are dying. teenagers are the target. nicotine 25 is as highly addictive as cocaine and heroin. they manipulate the nicotine, adjust the 2 ph level, add all kinds of additives to make 3 them inhalable and keep them to be addictive 4 and more addictive. and then filters do not 5 make them any safer. they did not know that. 6 okay? 7 do i play this one or skip it? play it. 8 9 10 follows:) 11 voice: if we do find any that we 12 consider harmful, and so far we have not, we 13 will remove these from smoke and still retain 14 the pleasure of your favorite cigarette. 15 voice: well, obviously a filter takes 16 out certain tar and nicotine. i do not think 17 the industry admits there are any bad elements. 18 voice: to claim there is now sufficient 19 scientific evidence to establish that cigarette 20 smoking causes disease is, in my opinion, 21 unjustified. 22 voice: turning a significant health 23 question into a publicity stunt is an insult to 24 serious science. 25 voice: i cannot point to anything that i would consider the cause of cancer of the lung, 2 but the behavior of the disease does not 3 support the idea of cigarettes being the causal 4 agent. 5 voice: we do not believe that cigarettes 6 are hazardous. we do not accept that. 7 voice: do you believe that cigarettes 8 are safe? have they been proved to be safe, 9 mr. cullman? 10 voice: i believe they have not been 11 proved to be unsafe. 12 voice: the case is still open. the jury 13 has not come out. 14 voice: it may not be harmful. we are not 15 convinced. 16 voice: it may, or it may not be. we 17 do not know. 18 voice: but insofar as the correlation 19 between lung cancer and cigarette smoking are 20 concerned, no one knows. it may, it may not. 21 voice: cigarette smoking does not cause 22 cancer, yes or no? 23 voice: it is not known whether 24 cigarettes cause cancer. 25 voice: all right. sir -- voice: has not been causally 2 established. 3 voice: there is not unanimity of opinion 4 in the community of science on these issues. 5 we have no business prejudging the scientific 6 controversy. we need more information. 7 voice: do cigarettes cause cancer? i 8 do not know if they do or not. 9 voice: i'm not a person to give you a 10 does or does not answer. 11 voice: the data that we have been able 12 to see has all been statistical data that has 13 not convinced me that smoking causes death. we 14 do not know what causes cancer in general right 15 now, so i think that we may find out what 16 causes cancer, and we may find out some 17 relationship which has yet to be proven. 18 voice: i do not think any of them die of 19 diseases caused by cigarette smoking. 20 voice: zero? 21 voice: if they do, i think it is an 22 unproven case. 23 (video clip concluded.) 24 mr. schlesinger: dr. alexander spears, 25 ceo of lorillard, now bought by reynolds in 1997. i do not think anybody dies of smoking, 2 and if they do, they still do not. it is an 3 unproven case. 4 the absolute iron, iron uniformity of the 5 conspiracy as late as 1997. it is a -- 6 and then the big pivot. they are trying 7 to claim that virginia varner should have known 8 what they profess to have not known because of 9 a "may be bad for you" label in 1966, or the 10 surgeon general said it is hazardous without 11 specificity in 1970? that does not meet with 12 the bounds of reason. 13 and then doubt is the product. 14 controversy, psychological crutch. let us say 15 controversy, contradictions unknown create 16 doubt. and the industry shield. 17 so we recommend when you get to this part 18 of the -- of the verdict form you find them all 19 to have acted in a way that caused virginia to 20 rely such that her smoking continued and how 21 things might have been different had they told 22 her the truth; and that they have culpability; 23 and that yes, their fraud and their conspiracy 24 depended upon and succeeded in getting folks 25 like her and virginia, in particular, to rely. and that includes reynolds every bit as 2 much as philip morris because they are co-equal 3 conspirators, all the acts together in 4 furtherance of the conspiracy. 5 and you heard testimony or statements 6 from lots of people that were the faces of the 7 conspiracy -- the scientists, the executives -- 8 all those folks were doing it to get her to 9 rely. she did. 10 that is how you should answer those 11 questions if you see this our way. 12 now, this is 5 and 6. i talked to you 13 about before, and i read you that story about 14 hooked. 15 was there fault on the part of virginia 16 varner which was a legal cause of her lung 17 cancer? remember they kept saying she did not 18 do anything wrong. she was right to enjoy 19 herself. she had every right to smoke and 20 these are her personal lifestyle choices and 21 everything else. 22 and so for that reason, while considering 23 whether or not she is at fault, just from what 24 they said, we would say that you check this off 25 "no," she did not do anything wrong. in the era in which she smoked she acted 2 totally normally. not to trump up things like: 3 did you ever hear -- they asked her: hey, had 4 you ever heard of the song smoke, smoke, smoke 5 that cigarette? 6 and lisa said: no. 7 and then the next question was: did you 8 ever hear your mom sing the song smoke, smoke, 9 smoke that cigarette? right? 10 did you ever hear the term "coffin 11 sticks"? 12 no. 13 did you ever hear your mom use the term 14 "coffin sticks," "cancer nails," "coffin 15 sticks." coffin nails, cancer sticks, smoke, 16 smoke, smoke that cigarette? 17 i do not figure they will harm me because 18 they have not hurt me yet. 19 jokes? jokes are what were supposed to 20 supplant trying to help people and telling the 21 truth about a dangerous deadly protect that is 22 too dangerous to market. that is a defective 23 and unreasonably -- 24 mr. keehfus: objection, your honor, 25 legal product. the court: excuse me. overruled. 2 mr. schlesinger: a defective -- this is 3 the engle finding. as if you found it 4 yourself. undenial by the defense. a 5 defective and unreasonably dangerous finding. 6 when used as intended, it is dangerous. 7 they advertise, they encourage folks: 8 smoke as much as you can. smoke as much as you 9 can. save the marlboro miles. save them. 10 because -- not that it is a road to 11 nowhere. because, do you have what it makes -- 12 do you have what it takes to make the team? a 13 road to nowhere. 14 what happens to someone that saves this 15 many pack -- proof of purchase from a pack? 16 they are encouraging you to smoke as much as 17 possible to win valuable prizes? 18 mr. geraghty: your honor, there is no 19 evidence -- motion -- 20 the court: sustained. 21 mr. schlesinger: this is -- 22 the court: excuse me. you are to rely 23 on your own recollection of the evidence. 24 counsel, you have ten minutes. 25 mr. schlesinger: so, if you say: hey, by 1982, 1985, okay -- this is how i break it 2 down numerically. you have to add it to 3 one hundred percent. if you find she is not at fault at 4 all, you would break it down 75 percent, 5 25 percent, because they initiated the 6 addiction. 7 but these are my recommendations. you 8 can adjust these numbers any way you want. you 9 have to put a zero in for virginia varner if 10 you say no. 11 but let us look at this. let us say you 12 say: wait a second. now, we heard a lot about 13 her smoking. there was a caution on the pack. 14 you know, she should have done better. 15 well, look here, these are smoking rates. 16 smoking rates kept going up. it was not until 17 '82, '85, that the new warnings that actually 18 said something specific about lung cancer got 19 on a label, and it was not until that much 20 information was out there that the total 21 consumption in the united states started going 22 down. 23 that is the turning point. that is 24 30 years into her smoking. 25 if you think that 30 years into her smoking, the first 30 years being totally the 2 responsibility of the defendants to confuse the 3 situation, reassure her with filters and her 4 smoking in a normal culture, that would all be 5 their fault. 6 the last ten percent of her smoking 7 career, the last ten years, if you want to say 8 she bears some responsibility for that so that 9 the last 25 percent of her smoking was such 10 that with the population reducing smoking so 11 too was she careless or negligent or at fault 12 for not starting to or figuring out or getting 13 over her addiction or trying to fight it 14 harder? 15 well, then, you can assign her some 16 relative degree of responsibility for that 17 period of time forward. 18 but even in that setting, i would say you 19 break it up so that they are more at fault. 20 because they are doing something on purpose 21 that is wrongful. 22 and she was just -- maybe some human 23 weaknesses, curtailed and constrained by 24 addiction and dependence. she was not doing 25 anything on purpose. they were doing stuff on purpose. 2 so you could -- if you checked it off 3 "yes" -- because i want to talk to you about 4 this because the defendants will -- then i 5 would break it up like this so that even in 6 those last years, she gets no more than 7 ten percent. because the last ten years, one 8 quarter of her smoking history, that is 9 25 percent of it. they should still get more. 10 they should get 15 of that last 25 percent, and 11 she could get ten percent if you do that. 12 it would be a great honor for mr. varner 13 of vindication if you check off -- 14 mr. keehfus: objection, motion. 15 the court: sustained. 16 mr. geraghty: objection, motion. 17 mr. schlesinger: if the evidence 18 supports it, it would be perfectly appropriate 19 for you to check off "no." 20 they said they accept a basic interest. 21 you saw that. 22 they boycotted the dow purchases of 23 millions of dollars of material because they 24 did not want people to stop smoking. they tried 25 to block people from smoking [sic]. in one of those cullman videos you may 2 remember at the very beginning he says: we 3 do not do anything. we have no program set up 4 to try to help people stop smoking. 5 they were not trying to help people quit. 6 they never wanted people to get. they never 7 wanted virginia varner to quit. they were 8 happy to have her smoke and buy those 9 cigarettes because they could make money off 10 her. that was their job. 11 so i'm going to skip this. 12 voice: stop worrying about -- 13 mr. schlesinger: and talk about the 14 advertising budget of a quarter trillion 15 dollars and dr. proctor saying that the public 16 health message was like a snowflake in a 17 snowstorm. 18 i'm going to skip this. 19 voice: 19 -- 20 mr. schlesinger: and do not forget. 21 dr. difranza was good enough at one time -- and 22 you will see both these brochures in evidence -- 23 to be quoted by philip morris as being an 24 authority who talked about raising kids who 25 do not smoke and saying: do not be afraid to admit to your children that you might have made 2 a different choice had you understood then what 3 you do now. 4 that is in 2000 when they put out a 5 brochure supposedly to show that they are not 6 wanting youth smoking, and they cited 7 dr. difranza. and then subsequently in the 8 footnote that cited his work, they removed his 9 name. 10 and you look at those brochures side by 11 side and watch how he was good enough for them 12 as an expert, and then they removed his name 13 subsequently. you look at that. 14 and then, again, importantly, virginia 15 did not appreciate the dangers of smoking, not 16 like it was demonstrated in this courtroom the 17 modern world understands it. 18 and if you have a caution on a pack of 19 cigarettes, right, like in 1966, and you have a 20 kid, a 12-year-old, and he is standing out on 21 the board of a pool and he is getting ready to 22 jump in the pool and you see a no diving sign 23 there, are reasonable people going to say, if 24 the child is getting ready to run off the end 25 of that diving board into an empty pool: go ahead, go ahead? or are they going to say: 2 stop. do not go there. this is dangerous. a 3 lifetime consequence will occur? 4 so what constitutes the truth and helping 5 people and saying "we did something wrong" and 6 doing something about it makes a big 7 difference. 8 look at 12 years after she started 9 smoking; 16 years after she started smoking; 10 1985, 31 years after she started smoking. 11 heavily addicted. nonrotating -- the rotating 12 warnings on the side. 13 and then dr. proctor talked about what is 14 confusing about this. it takes years for these 15 poisons to accumulate one puff at a time and 16 kill you. unlike if you saw a rattle snake on 17 the side of the road and you know right away 18 that thing could kill you right now with 19 poison. that is a clear and present threat. 20 cigarettes, it is seductionism. lowering 21 the level of the threat of harm to below what 22 folks would normally appreciate as being 23 immediately dangerous. that is part of the 24 miracle of its profitability and the scourge of 25 its deadliness to our society. i'll skip this. 2 the court: five minutes, counsel. 3 mr. schlesinger: yeah. i'll skip that. 4 so negligence and fault. i thought we 5 did this. okay? talk about damages a little 6 bit. 7 and i always run out of time on this. we 8 spend so much time. 9 but, you know, you heard what they said. 10 i mean one of the more -- you saw him break 11 down with emotion, and the -- i -- there are 12 two things -- there are things that matter and 13 things that do not matter with regard to 14 damages, okay? 15 there are things that matter and two 16 things that do not matter with regard to 17 damages. 18 when you do compensation for the pain and 19 suffering, mental anguish of joe varner -- who 20 lost his wife now for over 20-something years 21 and into the future for the next eight or ten 22 years they would have together, if she had not 23 died, they had stayed together. 24 the way in which you assess this 25 intangible element of damages is you say you consider -- you consider this evidence. you 2 measure the magnitude of the harm. 3 and we ask you to say to joe varner 4 through your verdict: we place great value on 5 your loss. okay? and i suggest that that is a 6 $10 million number, for pain and suffering, for 7 mental anguish, for losing his wife of 22 years 8 at 53, who would otherwise be alive. 9 you saw him on the stand. you judge his 10 demeanor. you judge the tears down his face. 11 you know he is still hurting from losing her. 12 you know he is going to be buried next to her 13 because he wants to spend life in heaven with 14 her. you know he wears her cross around his 15 heart. 16 however, there is something that you take 17 away and something you do not take away, because 18 there are two things that matter. the first is 19 this. it is relevant and you must consider it. 20 and i want to share it with you. 21 infidelity is a horrible thing. there is 22 no sugarcoating it. if the betrayed leaves, it 23 is justifiable and it is understandable. if 24 they stay and are able to rebuild in earnest, 25 that is something truly remarkable. the decision is, do we value the 2 relationship by what happened in that horrible 3 moment, or by the years before and, more 4 importantly, by the years afterwards? 5 the easy answer is to make the ugliness 6 into a be-all/end-all and continue the 7 punishment. but is it the right thing under 8 these special circumstances? 9 if she could forgive him, who are we to 10 hold it against him. what would she tell you 11 to do? 12 mr. keehfus: objection. the -- 13 mr. geraghty: golden rule, your honor. 14 mr. keehfus: motion. 15 the court: sustained. 16 mr. schlesinger: i suggest you measure 17 the true value of the relationship as she did. 18 something so treasured it was worth fighting 19 for and hurting for and, in the end, 20 resurrecting to a special place of atonement 21 and fulfillment. 22 that is surely the way he experienced it. 23 the luckiest man alive. someone who was given 24 a second chance and treated her as his most 25 precious gift for the rest of their lives together. you heard him testify about it. 2 and if you want to subtract from the 3 amount of money i suggest -- which, by the way, 4 you can give less, you can give more. you can 5 think it is too much. you can think it is not 6 enough. you can give substantially more. you 7 can give substantially less. 8 but it is relevant because in a betrayal, 9 in an affair, even if you get back together 10 one hundred percent, it leaves a mark, it leaves a 11 scar. it does not -- it never -- it does not 12 ever really one hundred percent heal. 13 so he hurt her, but he atoned. he 14 offered repentance. he lived the rest of his 15 life honorably, and he lived the rest of his 16 life to try to show to her that he could be 17 faithful to her. 18 and so it is relevant because it is his 19 pain and mental suffering and anguish. but 20 this was an impairment during their marriage. 21 but they got back together and but for her 22 death, they would be together today. 23 what is not to be mitigated from the 24 damages, what is irrelevant subtraction -- and 25 we spent very little time on it because it does not bear on anything other than you should 2 know the truth. he had a child a decade later. 3 he got married 12 years later. he is separated 4 now. you need to know the truth. 5 but the law does not provide, the 6 instructions do not provide -- 7 mr. geraghty: your honor, i object. 8 mr. schlesinger: -- for any 9 mitigation -- 10 the court: excuse me. 11 mr. geraghty: i object. 12 the court: what is the objection? 13 mr. geraghty: it is inconsistent with the 14 court's instructions. 15 the court: overruled. 16 mr. schlesinger: for any mitigation of 17 the law whatsoever. 18 and that is why i did not get sucked into 19 it. did not get into a debate. because there 20 was nothing to hide. now you know, yes, there 21 was a subsequent relationship. he explained 22 it. 23 but so you understand for damages, there 24 would not have been a subsequent relationship 25 but for her death because of negligence and intentional misconduct. he would have stayed 2 with her. 3 so the thing that does not matter and 4 should not result in we are going to take money 5 away from what we believe is a proper award for 6 pain and suffering and mental anguish and the 7 loss of his beloved wife -- who i heard called 8 the first wife at least eight times during this 9 trial -- 10 mr. geraghty: i object, your honor, to 11 the -- 12 mr. schlesinger: that is in the record. 13 mr. geraghty: -- attacking the way the 14 case has been -- 15 mr. schlesinger: i'm not attacking -- 16 the court: counsel, you need to wrap it 17 up. 18 mr. schlesinger: okay. 19 and in any event, so yes, you can 20 consider the affair in the context of it -- it 21 is in the marriage and it leaves a mark. 22 so -- but that is -- that is our 23 recommendation. ultimately this is up to you. 24 it is an intangible, and we trust the good 25 considerations in all of you. the harm to others as to punitive 2 damages, the death toll matters and deterrence 3 matters because it is not only to punish this 4 company, but to deter others who would act the 5 same way and disregard human life. 6 numbers numb. and it is hard to imagine 7 that -- the entire state of florida has 8 20 million people in it. 20 million deaths 9 would be an empty state of florida. 10 the defendants keep the exit gates locked 11 and they say right here that they would all 12 lose their jobs and consulting fees and the 13 cigarette market would collapse. 14 20 million people collapsed. millions 15 more are sick. the people collapsed, but they 16 did not want the business and the roaring river 17 of cash of profit to collapse. and that is 18 inhumane. they knew they would go out of 19 business if they lost nicotine and addiction, 20 and they do not want that. that is why i say the 21 numbers numb. 22 and we talked about you could consider 23 the harm to others. that is why it was relevant 24 that so many of the people get sick and die. 25 and that is why you heard those big numbers. even though they are hard to imagine. but they 2 are truly tragic numbers. 3 and then i think we played this already, 4 did not we? no, skip this. skip it. 5 okay? and that is why, when assessing 6 reprehensibility, atrocious misconduct, you 7 say: okay. you are here as a company. we 8 judge you as being human. they are humans. 9 here is their logos. they are human. but were 10 they humane? did they help people? did they 11 try to block addiction. 12 and i say -- i'm going to wrap up now 13 very quickly here. 14 i say what humane companies, people, 15 corporations should do, is to protect children, 16 not addict them. 17 what i say is, men of science and 18 brilliant men who come up with the ingenious 19 ways and novel ways of making this perfect 20 nicotine delivery device should be working to 21 cure cancer, not cause cancer. 22 mr. geraghty: your honor -- 23 the court: sustained. 24 mr. geraghty: move to strike; motion. 25 the court: jury, disregard. stricken. mr. schlesinger: and i think the 2 evidence showed in this case that it is all 3 about the youth; the critical factor is kids; 4 and that that is something that is very 5 reprehensible, very unacceptable among human 6 decency. and they even describe them as a 7 crop, and a crop to be harvested. 8 after the 1964 report wore out and sales 9 were skyrocketing again, and the most number 10 one consumer package product in the history of 11 civilization is this, more of these have been 12 sold in the world than anything else ever. 13 and they refer to the youth who they are 14 looking to pick up after the surgeon general's 15 reports come out, the backlog of youth. they 16 call them a "crop." 17 and what do you do with a crop? van 18 gogh's famous painting, the reaper. a crop is 19 to be harvested. 20 and that is how they refer to their 21 customers, as rats in a cage, as a crop. this 22 is claude teague. we read this, it is in 23 evidence. 24 and -- to this day, they have not 25 mitigated. they have not changed. they are still advertising in ways that reach the 2 message to youth. dr. proctor talked about 3 thousands of youth all the time. still 4 smoking. 5 this magazine is in evidence. it is chock 6 full of advertisings that are very seductive 7 and sultry. 8 the money they say they paid under the 9 master settlement agreement had nothing to do 10 with anything other than reimbursing medicaid 11 and was a fraction of a fraction of the 12 hundreds of billions of dollars in medical care 13 that dr. proctor told you are generated by 14 cigarette diseases and deaths in this country 15 during any given year. 16 they do not advertise truthfully about 17 what really goes wrong with cigarettes. 18 and the jury instructions are what they 19 are. but you will decide if it was reckless 20 disregard if they were consciously indifferent 21 to the consequences, if they intentionally 22 violated the rights of humans, and if they 23 disregarded the safety and welfare of the 24 public. 25 the fda. they talked about the fda, and dr. proctor explained that they have done 2 nothing, and anything meaningful in public 3 health benefits. 4 and so some folks are disappointed with 5 government agencies, regulatory bodies, and 6 what the efficacy of government is. 7 but -- and i could call it the fail to do 8 anything association, as far as cigarettes -- 9 mr. geraghty: your honor, i object. 10 the court: sustained. 11 mr. keehfus: motion. 12 mr. geraghty: move to strike and motion. 13 the court: jurors, disregard the last 14 comments. 15 stricken. 16 mr. schlesinger: thomas jefferson said 17 that you as a jury, the jurors are the best of 18 all safeguards for the person and property of 19 every individual. i'd like to say they chose 20 profits over people. they promised to stop 21 making it, but their fingers were crossed 22 behind their back. 23 mr. keehfus: objection, your honor. 24 mr. schlesinger: and what would have 25 happened if they had told the truth? what would have happened if they changed 2 their behavior? 3 the world would be a very different 4 place, because the death rate would have 5 changed substantially, and we would not be here 6 because virginia varner would. 7 this is the last thing i'll play. 8 9 10 follows:) 11 voice: do you swear that the testimony 12 you are about to give is the truth, the whole 13 truth, and nothing but the truth? 14 voices: i do. 15 voice: please consider yourself to be 16 under oath. 17 voice: let me begin my question on the 18 matter of whether or not nicotine was 19 addictive. 20 let me ask you first -- and i would like 21 to just go down the row -- whether each of you 22 believes that nicotine is not addictive. 23 i heard virtually all of you touch on it. 24 just yes or no. 25 do you believe nicotine is not addictive? voice: i believe nicotine is not 2 addictive, yes. 3 voice: mr. johnson? 4 voice: congressman, cigarettes and 5 nicotine clearly do not meet the classic 6 definitions of addiction. there is no 7 intoxication -- 8 voice: we will take that as a no. 9 again, time is short. if you could 10 just -- i think each of you believe nicotine is 11 not addictive. we just would like to have this 12 for the record. 13 voice: i do not believe that nicotine or 14 our products are addictive. 15 voice: i believe nicotine is not 16 addictive. 17 voice: i believe that nicotine is not 18 addictive. 19 voice: i believe that nicotine is not 20 addictive. 21 voice: and i, too, believe that nicotine 22 is not addictive. 23 (video clip concluded.) 24 mr. schlesinger: last thing, and i'm 25 sitting down. george orwell wrote a book called 1984. it was published in the '40s, 2 famous writer, and -- 3 mr. geraghty: your honor, i object. 4 this is not proper argument. 5 the court: overruled. 6 mr. schlesinger: and he -- it was made 7 into a movie with richard hurt and -- richard 8 burton and john hurt. 9 and richard burton represented big 10 brother, the all-powerful force. and john hurt 11 represented the free-thinking man, trying to 12 see things as they are, which is what we ask 13 you to do in this case. to see things as they 14 are. 15 and richard burton was -- or was it john 16 hurt -- was torturing john hurt, and he said to 17 him, this. 18 he said: and above all, we do not 19 allow -- 20 mr. keehfus: objection, your honor, this 21 is not -- 22 the court: excuse me. 23 overruled. 24 this is argument, counsel. 25 mr. schlesinger: and he said: and above all, we do not allow the dead to rise up 2 against us. you must stop imagining that 3 posterity will vindicate you, winston. 4 posterity will never hear of you. 5 you will be lifted clean out from the 6 stream of history. we shall turn you into a 7 gas and pour you into the stratosphere. 8 nothing will remain of you. not a name 9 in a register, not a memory in a living brain. 10 you will have been annihilated in the past, as 11 well as in the future. 12 you will have never -- you will never 13 have existed. 14 ladies and gentlemen of the jury, 15 virginia varner existed. she is 22 years dead, 16 and we have recreated her story as best we can 17 before you over these last couple weeks. 18 we thank you for your attention thus far, 19 and we wish you great, good fortune in arriving 20 at a just and proper decision in this most 21 significant and important case. thank you. 22 the court: can i see counsel sidebar, 23 please? 24 (the following discussion was held at 25 sidebar:) the court: counsel, are you ready to 2 proceed, or do you need a break? 3 mr. geraghty: i just need like two or 4 three minutes to get started. i do not know if 5 your honor -- does your honor want me to go 45 6 minutes and then we will take the lunch break? 7 the court: it is your closing argument. 8 i want to give you the opportunity to make a 9 decision how you want to handle it. 10 mr. geraghty: i appreciate that. can 11 your honor tell me when i'm at about 30 or 35 12 minutes, and maybe i'll take a break at that 13 point? i know they do not like to wait too long 14 for their lunch. 15 the court: all right. we will plan on 16 going somewhere around 12:30, around that time. 17 i will wait -- 18 mr. schlesinger, you went ten minutes 19 over, so we are taking that out of your 20 rebuttal. ten minutes. 21 mr. schlesinger: i thought -- 22 the court: we are not talking about it. 23 you went ten minutes over. thanks. 6 mr. gdanski: thank you, judge. may it 7 please the court. 8 good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 9 jurors: good afternoon. 10 mr. gdanski: last minutes you get to 11 hear are precious, so i'm going to jump 12 superfast right into it. 13 we have been here for a couple of weeks, 14 and it is pretty clear that some things are in 15 dispute. some things are not in dispute. 16 one thing that nobody disputes is that 17 the tobacco industry purposefully, 18 intentionally controls the level of nicotine in 19 cigarettes in order to maintain levels of 20 addiction. you heard nothing else about it. 21 so forget everything else for one second. 22 ask this question: why are they designing a 23 product continuing to do so until today in such 24 a way that they know has just the right amount 25 of nicotine, just that super, super sweet spot to keep smokers addicted, maintain their 2 addiction, keep them along the path such that 3 they will get sick and die? 4 that is not how you are supposed to design 5 products. that is not giving people the free 6 choice to quit smoking. that is not helping 7 people quit smoking. that is not trying to help 8 save lives. that is not trying to help prevent 9 disease. that is not trying to help prevent 10 youth smoking. that is promoting all of those 11 things. 12 they have created an epidemic in this 13 country heretofore unknown in the history of 14 society. there is no two ways about it. there 15 was no other version of that story. it was 16 just kind of ignored by those who manufactured 17 it. 18 how can we sit on the sidelines and watch 19 them massively create death and destruction and 20 sort of just pretend it hides in plain sight 21 and does not exist? 22 and dr. proctor talked about -- and 23 mr. schlesinger said it, scott said it -- he 24 said that conspiracy means to breathe together. 25 and what exactly does that mean? so they breathe an epidemic together, 2 they breathe a conspiracy together. the 3 smokers inhale the conspiracy. as they are 4 doing that, one side is profiting, one side is 5 growing, one side is getting stronger and 6 stronger, and one side is slowly losing their 7 breath, dying slowly to the tune of thousands, 8 hundreds of thousands, millions. 9 and it goes on. it goes on just like 10 that. and then something happens. those folks 11 who are dying, those folks who are smoking, 12 they die. 13 and so what does the industry do? 14 i need help, buddy. 15 what does the industry do? they put in 16 place a mechanism to create replacement 17 smokers. so they know they are going to die. 18 what are we going to do? we cannot have them 19 die because if younger adults turn away from 20 smoking, the industry must decline. 21 now that is not an acceptable 22 proposition. that is not something that can be 23 entertained. that is not something that can be 24 appreciated. it must be avoided at all costs. 25 it must be avoided to the cost of just as a population which does not give birth will 2 eventually dwindle. 3 so replacement smokers are their 4 children, but they keep on killing them. 5 virginia varner, a replacement smoker. her 6 mother -- we have heard more in this case about 7 her mother's emphysema from mr. geraghty than 8 we have heard about her lung cancer, virginia's 9 lung cancer, and her emphysema that we heard 10 from mr. geraghty. 11 mr. geraghty: i would object. 12 the court: sustained. 13 mr. geraghty: move to strike. 14 the court: jurors disregard. 15 mr. gdanski: virginia varner is a 16 replacement smoker. 17 you heard testimony her kids smoke. they 18 will be replacement smokers. 19 but they go on. they do not just replace 20 the use. they do not just replace those who 21 die. they profit from them. they monetize 22 them. they study them. not to the tunes of 23 millions of dollars, not to the tunes of 24 thousands of dollars, billions and billions of 25 dollars. they say here that if we have an 2 aggressive plan, it will call for $442 million 3 profit during the plan period. however, if we 4 hold these -- remember the code words that were 5 used, yas, young adult smokers -- for the 6 market average of seven years, they would be 7 worth over $2.1 billion in aggregate 8 incremental profits. 9 these are their words discussing the 10 profitability, the monetization of children. 11 that is reprehensible. that is 12 abhorrent. it is unacceptable, and it should 13 not be tolerated even the tiniest little bit. 14 you know, we talked about mitigation. so 15 in 1950, you had elizabeth taylor on the cover, 16 and in 2008 or '12, you have rose from the 17 transformers with one direction. 18 this is not mitigation. they could not 19 have more tobacco advertisements in this 20 magazine than they do. it is advertised in this 21 magazine to a greater degree than any other 22 product. 23 so how far have we come? how far have 24 they let society come? not very far at all. 25 because a powerful industry, a powerful industry -- 2 mr. geraghty: objection, your honor. 3 the court: sustained. 4 mr. geraghty: move to strike. 5 the court: jurors disregard the last 6 comment. 7 mr. gdanski: this industry depends on 8 the perpetuation of this epidemic. they cannot 9 see it go down. they will keep it going 10 because nicotine, young adult smokers -- 11 mr. geraghty: your honor, there is no 12 evidence of any of this. i will object. 13 the court: overruled. ladies and 14 gentlemen, you rely on your own recollection of 15 the evidence. 16 mr. gdanski: nicotine and children are 17 their lifeblood. they are their sine qua non. 18 without children, without replacement smokers, 19 without nicotine, they would have no business, 20 the exit gates would open, it would be the end 21 of days for them, and they do not let it come. 22 dr. proctor talked about the current 23 state of affairs. every single day in this 24 country 3,800 children start smoking. 1,000 of 25 them become regular daily smokers. 500,000 deaths per year right now. 1,400 people die 2 from smoking every single day. 3 how many more? there is a song that has a 4 refrain, how many more, by neil young. 5 mr. geraghty: your honor, i would 6 object. 7 the court: overruled. 8 mr. gdanski: how many more, how many 9 more will there be? 10 dr. proctor said in 100 years smoking 11 will be gone. maybe, maybe not. but we are not 12 there; we are now. 500,000 1,400, 3,800 -- 13 massive, mind-staggering statistics that you 14 need to take a step back. because if you do not 15 take a step back and sort of get the big 16 picture, the numbers start to just become: ah, 17 a lot of people die from cigarette smoking. 18 that is not how it is. parents are dying. 19 sisters are dying. brothers are dying. aunts, 20 uncles, grandparents, loved ones. they leave 21 widows; they leave orphans. we do not exist in 22 a perfect world, but they leave real people 23 behind to suffer real sorrow with real tears 24 and real emotions. 25 there was one episode in this trial that portrayed a moment of just sort of reality of 2 mr. varner where he said: i go to my wife's 3 grave. and he is there by himself, and in a 4 moment of silence and solitude, he cleans the 5 weeds from her graveside. 6 that is real. that is not pretend. it is 7 not fake. it is real care. it is real emotion. 8 his son said he saw him do it. it is 9 someone who cherished his wife, cherishes her 10 still to this day, and it is a snapshot of the 11 mind frame and the caring nature that a husband 12 has for their longtime wife, their true love, 13 their soul mate, the person they met as a kid 14 and intended on living the rest of their life 15 with. 16 he gets down on his hands and his 17 knees -- he is not a young fellow. gets down on 18 his hands and his knees and cleans her 19 graveside. that is admirable. it is admirable. 20 so this is dr. gup's note from 8/22/1994. 21 and let us just give a little bit of context. 22 dr. gup here has confirmed the diagnosis 23 of lung cancer, he is confirmed the diagnosis of 24 copd, he is confirmed the diagnosis of tobacco 25 addiction, and he carries all of those over to this date. and he documents virginia varner as 2 of 8/22, so august 22nd, 1994, as a smoker. 3 this is her still smoking. 4 mr. geraghty: objection, that is 5 inconsistent with the evidence, your honor. 6 the court: thank you. 7 ladies and gentlemen, you are to rely on 8 your own recollection of the evidence. this is 9 counsel's opportunity to go through the 10 evidence as he recalls it. 11 go ahead, counsel. 12 mr. gdanski: this is the organic medical 13 record created at the time. still smoking a 14 pack a day. 15 and before this, when dr. gup first met 16 virginia varner, he never noted a history of 17 lung problems, he never noted a history of 18 significant medical problems, he never noted 19 any of those things. 20 this is his history taken from the person 21 who no one in this room ever got to speak to, 22 except for her husband. this is taken from 23 virginia varner. this is what she told him, 24 not courtroom deposition testimony with 25 impeachment, but this is real testimony. and we know there is a proverb that says: 2 the palest ink is far brighter than the best 3 memory. 4 this is ink. this is pen to paper in a 5 medical record, broward county hospital, that 6 actually demonstrates what took place. 7 there is no reference to history of 8 wheezing. there is no reference to history of 9 significant medical problems. 10 but take one step back for a second. 11 they want to claim that virginia varner had 12 this wheeze going back to the mid '80s. let us 13 just assume she did for a second. they also 14 want to claim that she smoked despite that for 15 a second. is not that a sign of addiction? did 16 they ever explain that, though? 17 if you have a person who suffers from a 18 wheeze that is associated with a product and 19 they continue to use the addictive product 20 which caused the wheeze, do you think that is 21 probably evidence of the person probably being 22 addicted? which is the burden of proof that is 23 relevant in this case, what is most likely? 24 what is probable? 25 is it probable that if a person uses an addictive drug for 40 years, they get sick as a 2 consequence of using that addictive drug, that 3 they were probably addicted to that drug? 4 does that stand to reason? does that 5 make logical sense? 6 we submit to you that it does, and that 7 is dispositive of multiple issues in this case. 8 dr. difranza. dr. difranza is a no-joke 9 expert. there is no real two ways about that. 10 whether or not you want to say he is treating 11 the most patients or some patients or whatever 12 you want to say about dr. difranza, 13 dr. difranza is a serious expert. 14 and he came in here and he told you that 15 addiction was "a cause" of virginia varner's 16 lung cancer, copd, and death. "a cause." 17 remember that because it is important. 18 when you get back with the jury instructions -- 19 and they are superdense. the jury instructions 20 are complicated. they take up time to 21 understand. there is a very big difference 22 between something being "a cause" and "the 23 cause." 24 but dr. difranza told you in no uncertain 25 terms, addiction was a contributing cause of her disease. 2 now, before these lawsuits, dr. difranza 3 was philip morris's expert. they paraded him 4 around when they wanted to try to put out 5 brochures -- 6 mr. geraghty: your honor, that is 7 inconsistent with the evidence. 8 the court: thank you. 9 ladies and gentlemen, again, you are to 10 rely on your own recollection of the evidence. 11 mr. gdanski: it is right here. this is: 12 raising kids who do not smoke. it is pt425 from 13 2004. 14 we all heard that the engle progeny cases 15 developed in 2006. your honor -- i think the 16 court read that instruction. that is when the 17 florida supreme court came out with its 18 opinion. the mandate, one year later. 19 so in 2004, before this evolution of 20 litigation against the industry, philip morris 21 was proudly, publicly citing dr. difranza -- 22 mr. geraghty: objection. 23 the court: sustained. 24 mr. geraghty: move to strike, 25 your honor. the court: thank you. 2 ladies and gentlemen, again, you are to 3 rely on your own recollection of the evidence. 4 i sustained the objection. it is stricken. 5 mr. gdanski: philip morris cited 6 dr. difranza as their expert in raising kids 7 who do not smoke in 2004. the citation was 8 number 6, discussing symptoms of addiction. 9 so on the question of symptoms of 10 addiction, they cite him for the proposition 11 that teens and preteens can have symptoms 12 within weeks or only days after they become 13 occasional smokers. 14 it makes sense they would cite him on 15 that for two reasons. number one is, he is an 16 expert on addiction. number 2 is, he is a 17 specialist in youth smoking. that is what he is 18 devoted his life to. 19 so they cite him right there, number 6 in 20 evidence. and then a couple of years later, 21 the second version of this comes out, and they 22 take him right off. 23 now, we know that the industry internally 24 had documents where they discussed what would 25 happen if there were methods to stop smoking? what would happen if there were methods to help 2 people cessate from smoking? 3 and they say here in pt1154: it is my 4 strong feeling that with the progress that has 5 been claimed, we are in the progress [sic] of 6 digging our own grave. 7 they were not comfortable continuing 8 research that led to them digging their own 9 grave. instead, they were very comfortable, 10 very comfortable letting the graves be dug for 11 thousands and hundreds of thousands -- 12 mr. geraghty: objection, your honor. 13 move to strike. i have a motion. 14 the court: thank you. 15 jurors, disregard the last comment. 16 stricken. 17 mr. gdanski: i asked dr. proctor about 18 anthropomorphizing, which means keeping the 19 company alive and the smoker something else. 20 and they did that here: we do not want to 21 die. they say this while thousands of 22 americans are dying. 23 dr. proctor. 24 dr. proctor is a scholar on the subject 25 of the tobacco industry. they never one time took out his book and said to him: well, you 2 know, you wrote something different in this 3 book. that is different than what your 4 scholarly research shows. 5 no, there is no two sides to it. but this 6 is a mousetrap. there is a proverb that says: 7 build a better mousetrap, and the world will 8 beat a path to your door. 9 build a better mousetrap. he built a 10 better mousetrap. he became -- he went to 11 harvard and stanford and teaching and studying 12 and studying and reading and researching and 13 publishing. 14 he became a major significant expert. 15 the surgeon general cites him over 30 times. 16 he is at the white house for the introduction. 17 the fda brings him to washington, d.c. he 18 distinguished himself as an expert in the 19 subject. 20 we need to find someone to teach jurors 21 about that subject. who are we going to go to? 22 we are going to go to the person who built the 23 better mousetrap, because he has paved a path 24 to his door. 25 we come to him for his expertise. and to suggest anything otherwise is disingenuous. he 2 is a top scholar -- 3 mr. keehfus: objection. 4 the court: sustained. 5 mr. keehfus: motion. 6 mr. gdanski: dr. proctor is the top 7 scholar on this subject in this country. he 8 knows more about it than almost anybody else. 9 we heard about reader's digest. the 10 tobacco industry hated reader's digest. they 11 could not stand when they were putting out 12 articles. 13 and what did they do? they successfully 14 refuted reader's digest. 15 we put it into evidence, 2027, 16 successfully refute reader's digest. because 17 they could not appreciate, they could not stand 18 for the message reader's digest was putting 19 out. why? because the industry did not want 20 people to stop smoking. 21 same thing when dow, nicorette tried to 22 help people for the first time have a medical 23 mechanism to stop. they said: no way. 24 filtered cigarettes, there is this 25 concept being brought up by counsel -- defense counsel over and over again that the varners 2 always smoked filters. and so if you always 3 smoked filters, then they saw bad stuff in 4 filters. i'm not sure i understood it, but 5 here's where -- 6 mr. geraghty: i would object, 7 your honor, to the commentary about the 8 arguments. 9 the court: overruled. 10 mr. gdanski: here is what dr. proctor 11 explained about filters. he explained that the 12 surgeon general, the public health community 13 for decades recommended smokers smoke filters. 14 and then he said in 2001, they switched 15 that recommendation because of the revelation 16 of the internal documents. 17 and he talked about the fact that the 18 public health community, the surgeon general, 19 the american cancer society were misled by -- 20 mr. keehfus: objection. 21 mr. geraghty: your honor, this is not in 22 evidence. hearsay. 23 the court: thank you. 24 counsel. sustained. 25 mr. geraghty: move to strike, your honor. 2 the court: jurors, disregard the last 3 comments. 4 mr. geraghty: and i have a motion. 5 the court: ladies and gentlemen, you are 6 to rely on your own recollection of the 7 evidence. 8 mr. gdanski: dr. proctor said: and 9 exactly as you said, the surgeon general 10 recommended filters. they would all say it is 11 best not to smoke at all. but if you must 12 smoke, smoke filters, believing they were 13 safer. 14 so it was not an uncommon -- uncommon 15 for -- even among leading public health 16 officials for decades to make the mistake that 17 filters were safer. 18 then he discussed in 2000, after the 19 revelation of the documents, the consensus 20 turning around. 21 and if the surgeon general and the public 22 health community got it wrong and the tobacco 23 industry knew internally, what chance did 24 virginia varner have? what chance did she 25 have? the surgeon general could not get it 2 right. took him 30 years to get it right. 3 what chance did she have? 4 mr. geraghty said that joe varner, jr. 5 hemmed and he hawed. he did not hem and haw. 6 can you play it? 7 this is the question from -- one of you 8 asked this question. this is it. let us take a 9 look. 10 we need some volume. do it again. 11 try it one more time. then i'm going to 12 move. if we get it, we will come back to it. 13 okay. 14 mr. geraghty said in opening statement 15 and again today: we are not going to dispute 16 that some of our employees said stupid or 17 inappropriate things over time. and that is 18 too little, too late. 19 mr. geraghty: your honor, i would object 20 to the comment. 21 the court: sustained. 22 mr. gdanski: it is not about -- 23 mr. geraghty: move to strike. 24 the court: jurors, disregard the last 25 comment. mr. gdanski: it is not about what is 2 said now in 2016. it is about what was said 3 and what was done while virginia varner was 4 alive. that is what it is about. and we know 5 that they -- i'll get back to it. 6 okay. we will do it now. 7 8 9 follows:) 10 the court: i will read the question out 11 loud. and if i correctly stated the question, 12 then i'm going to ask you to answer it. all 13 right? 14 the question reads as follows: did 15 mrs. varner first -- or, excuse me -- when did 16 ms. varner first tell you she wanted to quit 17 smoking? 18 did i correctly state your question? 19 voice: yes. 20 the court: can you answer that, please? 21 the witness: i'm not sure exactly, a 22 date or anything like that. but i've heard her 23 say it quite a few times, you know -- as i was 24 growing up or whatever, even before -- probably 25 even before i was smoking. but, honestly, i do not know, you know, 2 how old i was or how old she was. i do not 3 remember. 4 the court: does that complete your 5 answer, mr. varner? 6 the witness: yes, sir. 7 (video clip concluded.) 8 mr. gdanski: that is candid. he said she 9 tried to quit probably before he was even 10 smoking. no hemming, no hawing. strictly 11 upfront. answered the question. he told his 12 answer as best as he possibly could. 13 now, it is not about what is said in court 14 today from tobacco company attorneys. it is 15 about what they did. 16 but the documents also reveal something 17 else. they do not just reveal what they did. 18 they reveal why they did it, what they were 19 scared of, what they were terrified of. 20 and we know at least two things were 21 really in their mind that they were afraid of: 22 lawyers and lawsuits. lawyers and lawsuits. 23 the court: five minutes, counsel. 24 mr. geraghty: i object and move to 25 strike, your honor. mr. gdanski: we have here -- 2 the court: excuse me. there is an 3 objection pending. 4 sustained. 5 mr. gdanski: we have here 1963 from a 6 law firm representing tobacco companies. 7 they said then: as we frequently 8 discussed with the passing of time, the 9 defenses of assumption of risk -- dr. proctor 10 explained that means it is all their fault -- 11 defenses of assumption of risk and contributory 12 negligence will loom increasingly more 13 important. 14 so they knew it was going to loom as a 15 defense. 16 yet the validity -- the validity of these 17 defenses is being whittled down by tobacco 18 company utterances, to the effect that there is 19 no risk or that it is remote. 20 they knew in 1963 that what they said 21 publicly made a difference to what people were 22 doing. they knew that. 23 24 25 follows:) voice: it is equally ridiculous in your 2 judgment for the surgeon general and the u.s. 3 public health service and the centers for 4 disease control, it is equally ridiculous and 5 preposterous for them to say that 450,000 6 americans die every year as a result of 7 cigarette smoke. 8 voice: i think it is totally 9 unsupportable. 10 (video clip concluded.) 11 mr. gdanski: the history of the 12 documents reveal why this was maintained as the 13 ultimate denial. 14 lest some lawyer be looking over our 15 shoulder, i do not conceive that even one 16 person dies of a chronic disease that is caused 17 by smoking cigarettes. sauce for the goose is 18 sauce for the gander. that is all i'm saying. 19 we know that this is the real truth. 20 this is the secret reason, the real reason. 21 in this case, there is no dispute -- 22 everyone should understand this, there is no 23 dispute that smoking cigarettes caused virginia 24 varner's death. none. 25 we know, though, that internally, in 1978, there are documents that an admission by 2 the industry that excessive cigarette smoking 3 is bad for you is tantamount to an admission of 4 guilt with regard to the lung cancer problem. 5 this -- and when they say "this," they 6 are referring to this idea that smoking 7 actually hurts people -- this could open the 8 door to legal suits in which the industry would 9 have no defenses. 10 so we know from a document 11 mr. schlesinger talked about, lawyers remind us 12 we cannot defend continued smoking as free 13 choice if the person was addicted. 14 here, this could open the door to legal 15 suits in which the industry would have no 16 defense. 17 one of the things that was discussed was 18 ms. varner, virginia varner, saying: i'm going 19 to get sick in 1992. she was prescient. she 20 had a sense. 21 in 1992, it was too late. had she 22 stopped, she is still doomed. 23 however, now, it is not too late. think 24 about this. when they knew -- 25 mr. geraghty: objection, your honor. the court: overruled. 2 mr. gdanski: when they knew smokers were 3 going to die. 4 so she says: i know -- she says that 5 it is -- i'm going to die anyway. well, flip it 6 on its head. they knew smoking was dangerous, 7 and what did they do. they said: we are going 8 to kill them anyway. 9 mr. keehfus: objection. 10 mr. geraghty: objection. 11 the court: sustained. 12 mr. geraghty: motion, your honor. 13 the court: jurors, disregard. 14 counsel, you need to wrap it up. 15 mr. gdanski: yes, sir. 16 there is a quote from a famous author 17 named saul bellow, which says: a great deal of 18 intelligence -- and the folks who worked for 19 tobacco companies were smart -- a great deal of 20 intelligence can be invested in ignorance when 21 the need for illusion is deep. 22 they had a deep need to create illusion. 23 they did it by the manufacturing of ignorance. 24 and virginia varner unquestionably paid the 25 price. she paid the ultimate price. the eternal price. she paid the forever price. 2 what price have they paid? 3 mr. keehfus: objection, your honor. 4 mr. geraghty: objection, your honor. 5 the court: thank you. 6 overruled. 7 mr. gdanski: thanks very much, ladies 8 and gentlemen. thank you.
