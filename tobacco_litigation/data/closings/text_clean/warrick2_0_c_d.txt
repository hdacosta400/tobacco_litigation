7 mr. reilly: judge, that suggests that my 8 closing argument might make somebody sleepy. and i 9 hope that is not true. 10 and when i practiced this last night, i 11 practiced it by saying, "good morning, everybody," 12 and i'm still making it. 13 the jury: good morning. 14 mr. reilly: so good morning, everybody. 15 the jury: good morning. 16 mr. reilly: you know what, i want to start my 17 closing argument in kind of the same way that 18 mr. shields did, and that is by thanking you for your 19 service. 20 when we started this, when we were picking you 21 guys as jurors, we said things like tremendous 22 responsibility, tremendous power. remember all 23 that? and when we were talking about it, i said, 24 you know, we are going to ask you to leave your jobs 25 and your homes and your families and come spend a 1 lot of time with us. and you have done it. and i 2 said, "your job is going to be to listen closely to 3 all the evidence in this case," right? and then you 4 were going to have to put that together with the law 5 that judge boyer is going to give you here in just a 6 little bit. actually, it is probably going to be 7 monday, i think. 8 and, you know, for this system to work right -- 9 i asked all you guys, "is there any better system in 10 the world?" you know, we talked about raising 11 hands, and is anybody not from here in the united 12 states and do they have a system -- a better system 13 anywhere else in the world? and we all agreed that 14 this was the best system. 15 and for it to work really well, you guys got to 16 do what you did in this case. and what is that? 17 you paid very close attention to the evidence as it 18 was coming in. 19 and sometimes that was not all that easy. and 20 i know that because some of it was long depositions 21 on that screen, including one where i was 22 cross-examining dr. farone. and i'll be perfectly 23 honest with you. i got a little sleepy, myself, 24 listening to me cross-examine. 25 so i know it was hard sometimes. but you guys 1 did a great job. and we really, all of us, on 2 behalf of myself, mr. bradford, everybody in this 3 room, we appreciate the work you have done. 4 but, of course, your work is not over yet, 5 right? now we have come to the most important part. 6 this is where you actually resolve this civil 7 dispute. this is where you take the evidence that 8 you heard from the witness stand and the documents 9 and things that are going to be sent back with you 10 into the jury room, and the instructions that judge 11 boyer is going to give you, and you put it all 12 together, you answer the questions on the verdict 13 form, and you resolve this dispute, right? all 14 right. 15 so now let us get started. you know, at the 16 very beginning of this case, when i gave you my 17 opening statement, i put this board up. and you 18 notice that we are going to see an awful lot of the 19 boards that i put up, because i told you that what i 20 wanted you to do was to watch the evidence and see 21 whether or not it did not turn out to be exactly what 22 i told you it was going to be. that is what i told 23 you. 24 and i said, "you know what, this case is going 25 to be about three words." i said, "we can distill 1 this whole case down into three words." and what 2 were they? control, who was in control of 3 mrs. warrick decisions, lifestyle choices, that came 4 with the potential for long-term health 5 consequences? and i said, "for sure that is going to 6 include smoking," right? but i said, "that is not 7 the" -- in order to know about why somebody does 8 what they do, you have to look a little broader than 9 that, right? you have to know more about the person 10 than just their smoking. you have to know how they 11 live their life, right? 12 so i said, "we are going to be looking at" -- 13 "we are going to have a little window into how 14 ms. warrick lived her life, and it is going to 15 include things like smoking, diet, health, weight, 16 all that kind of stuff." 17 and you did, you got a little window into who 18 was in control of mrs. warrick's lifestyle 19 decisions, including her decision to begin smoking, 20 continue smoking, quit smoking. 21 i said this case was going to be about 22 causation. i said, "you are going to be asked what 23 was the cause of her death." and mr. shields just 24 referred to this as a "false issue." it is not 25 really a false issue. it is an issue in this case. 1 and you guys have to resolve it for us. 2 and what is the question? the question is: did 3 she die because of her lung cancer or chronic 4 obstructive pulmonary disease, or did she die 5 because she had a terribly diseased heart, a heart 6 twice as large as its normal size, with electrical 7 problems? did her heart stop beating because it had 8 electrical problems, too large a size, and it beat 9 for the last time because of that? 10 and i should start this by saying, mr. engram 11 and i are going to divide up the defense side of the 12 closing argument, and he is going to talk to you 13 about that. 14 and then i said, "once you know the answer to 15 who was in control of mrs. warrick's decisions and 16 what was the cause of her death, then you would be 17 able to determine who was responsible in this case." 18 who was responsible? 19 and i said, "you know what, you will not see these 20 words on the verdict form; you will not see these words 21 in the instructions. this is a distillation." and 22 that is true, you will not see them on the verdict form. 23 but that is what this case turned out to be about. 24 as you watched the evidence in this case, 25 that is what you saw unfold, when we talked about 1 whose case this was. 2 this is not a class action. this is not a case 3 about america, in general, or american people or the 4 american population or people who answer surveys. 5 this is a case about one smoker, right? and who is 6 that? that is eveline warrick. that is whose case 7 we are here about today. 8 all right. so, now, what does -- what are the 9 questions that we asked you to answer? and i have 10 the verdict form. it looks like this. and you are 11 each -- i do not know if everybody gets a verdict 12 form, but everybody gets a set of instructions. 13 but the first two questions that you are going 14 to be asked to answer -- can everybody see this? 15 the jury: (nods head.) 16 mr. reilly: okay. "was eveline warrick 17 addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine? yes or 18 no?" and, number two, "if your answer to question 1 19 was yes, then you need to answer the second 20 question, which is, 'was eveline warrick's addiction 21 to cigarettes containing nicotine a legal cause of 22 her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?'" 23 okay. now, what did the evidence turn out to 24 be regarding whether or not mrs. warrick was 25 addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine? well, 1 you guys had two addiction experts come here. the 2 plaintiffs brought dr. frazier, and we brought 3 dr. hayes, right? dr. hayes was the lady that 4 appeared last in this trial. 5 and dr. frazier said, "yes, mrs. warrick was 6 addicted." and here in this courtroom on direct 7 examination, she said, "in my opinion, my clinical 8 judgment, mrs. warrick was addicted from the time 9 she was in her -- either her late teens or her early 10 20s, sometime in the late '50s or early '60s." and 11 she said, "i use as my guide a manual here, the dsm, 12 but" she said, "i do not have enough information to 13 use this going all the way back to the '50s or the 14 '60s." 15 so here in this courtroom, on direct 16 examination, she said, "so i used my clinical 17 judgment to make that determination." but then on 18 cross-examination i reminded -- 19 what is the best way to do this? let us use two 20 of these. 21 can you see this one, too? 22 a juror: yeah, except for the bottom. 23 mr. reilly: except for the bottom? 24 a juror: (nods head.) 25 mr. reilly: how about that? 1 a juror: (shakes head.) 2 mr. reilly: still in the way. okay. you know 3 what? i'll do it another way. 4 there you go. sorry. 5 and if anybody cannot hear me -- because the 6 court reporter told me before i got started, she 7 said, "speak up, mr. reilly. you are too 8 soft-spoken," so... 9 on cross-examination i reminded her that in her 10 deposition she had testified that she said, "i can 11 tell you, based on my clinical experience and based 12 on the fact that she started so young and if she was 13 smoking a pack a day, i would not be surprised if 14 she met the criteria for nicotine dependence in her 15 late teens or early 20s. nobody could tell you 16 within medical certainty unless they were there at 17 that time and interviewed her to see if she met the 18 criteria, so i cannot say with medical certainty. i 19 can say it would not surprise me at all, based on my 20 clinical experience of treating patients for lots of 21 years with nicotine dependence." 22 so then she was asked, "so it would not surprise 23 you, but you really do not know?" 24 "no, i do not. nobody would." 25 that is what she was reminded of. 1 now, what did dr. hayes say? dr. hayes said, 2 "i also am using this same criteria, the same 3 criteria found in this manual." and she said, "you 4 know what, just as dr. frazier had said in her 5 deposition" -- she said, "you know what, there is 6 just not enough information before 1991 to make that 7 determination. but i will tell you this, if her 8 smoking -- if her quitting history that she 9 described after 1991 is accurate, then i'll say that 10 she meets the necessary three criteria for 11 determining that somebody is nicotine-dependent as 12 of 1991." but she said, "there are reasons to be 13 uncertain about that. there are reasons for 14 questioning." 15 and, you know, she is a forensic psychologist, 16 ph.d. in forensic psychology. and she told you what 17 that means is that she is trained in looking at folks 18 who say things for reasons. like the person who 19 claims insanity because he or she wants to avoid the 20 death penalty, right? 21 so now dr. hayes said, "look, i'm not saying 22 that -- i'm not" -- she did not -- she did not accuse 23 mrs. warrick of not telling the truth. she only 24 said, "there are certain things in the medical 25 records that raise some question." 1 for example, she said, "look, was there any 2 indication on mrs. warrick's part about having quit 3 smoking in 1993 when she was diagnosed with that 4 lesion on her epiglottis?" do you remember that? 5 and how, when the doctors told her -- 6 and this is that medical record that talks 7 about here "she was a one-and-a-half-pack-a-day 8 smoker." "off," in other words, she quit smoking in 9 december of 1993. 10 january '94, that is when they have this 11 epiglottis. and remember dr. bagnoli said, "that 12 lesion went away over some period of time because 13 she stopped smoking." now, he could not be specific 14 as to how long, but he said, "you know, this is not 15 something that happens overnight." 16 and then -- remember mrs. warrick testified 17 that she could not -- she could not stop smoking 18 between 1991 and thanksgiving 2000 except for a 19 couple days at a time, or maybe two or three weeks, 20 maximum, one time? but here was her podiatrist 21 record, and it was filled out by mrs. warrick on 22 july 7th, 1994. and the question was asked, "do you 23 smoke?" and her answer was "no." 24 now, mrs. warrick did not say anything about 25 this in her deposition. she did not say anything 1 about the epiglottis situation in her deposition. 2 now, do we know whether or not mrs. warrick 3 stopped smoking between december of '93 and july 4 of '94? is that why she said she was a -- she wrote 5 no to being a smoker? we do not know. did she stop 6 smoking for longer than july 7th, 1994? we do not 7 know. we do not know. 8 but that is why dr. hayes raised this issue 9 about whether or not she truly was addicted from 10 1991 on. because if she really could stop and if 11 she really did stop, that would be inconsistent with 12 the history that she gave, right? and now we have 13 these medical records that raise that question. 14 i have an echo. 15 all right. but, you know, i leave that -- the 16 answer to that first question, "was she addicted to 17 cigarettes containing nicotine," to your sound 18 discretion. you guys heard the evidence. you guys 19 decide. you will decide, regardless of whether i 20 tell you to. 21 but there is a second question here. and 22 mr. shields really did not focus on a significant 23 part of this question. part of your instructions, 24 part of your obligation, part of what you are 25 obliged as jurors to do -- you cannot skip over it. 1 you know, it is like if you are building an airstrip 2 or you are doing a maintenance project or you are 3 teaching folks about how to do something or you are 4 filling out the paperwork for reimbursements or 5 determining the validity of claims, you got to do 6 all the steps. you cannot leave any of them out. 7 even though some of them are harder than others, 8 even though some are doggone hard, you still got to 9 do every step, every step. 10 so what you have to determine is whether or not 11 if mrs. warrick was addicted, whether or not her 12 addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine was a 13 legal cause of her chronic obstructive pulmonary 14 disease. 15 now, have you seen yet the definition of legal 16 cause? well, mr. shields did not explain it to you 17 at all, but here it is. let us read through it 18 because it is hard. it is filled with legalese. 19 "addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine is 20 a legal cause of copd if it directly and in natural 21 and continuous sequence produces or contributes 22 substantially to producing such copd so that it can 23 reasonably be said that, but for the addiction, the 24 copd would not have occurred." would not have 25 occurred. 1 now, i'll tell you. i said it slowly because 2 it is hard, and i know that law students spend three 3 years in law school trying to learn what that means. 4 and then lawyers like me spend the rest of our lives 5 trying to figure out how to communicate it to 6 people, because it is hard. it is a hard concept. 7 but what it boils down to is that -- and this 8 is their burden of proof. this is their burden of 9 proof. they have to prove to you that if she was 10 addicted, her addiction was so strong, so powerful 11 that without it, that but for it, she would never 12 have gotten her copd. without it she would never 13 have gotten her copd. that is how powerful it has to 14 be. that is their burden of proof. they have to 15 bring a bigger mountain of evidence on this point 16 than we do. that is their obligation. 17 now, what mr. shields showed you and walked 18 through was the second half of this. and it 19 basically says that addiction does not have to be the 20 only cause. it can work in conjunction with some 21 other cause. but that does not alleviate, that 22 does not eliminate their obligation to prove that the 23 addiction was, in the first place, a legal cause, 24 the "but for" cause, of why she got her copd. 25 now, i realize -- i realize this is not easy. 1 it is just like i said. it is a step you have to -- 2 you cannot skip over it. you cannot skip over it. 3 it is part of what you have to wrestle with and 4 determine. 5 now, to help you -- to help you with that issue 6 there is something we need to focus on -- and 7 mr. shields talked about it -- and that is their 8 admission. what is their admission? what did they 9 admit in this case? and you are going to see it in 10 your instructions. what did they admit in this 11 case? 12 norma warrick, as the representative of 13 the estate of her mother, admitted that eveline 14 warrick's acts and omissions relating to the 15 duration and frequency of her efforts to quit 16 smoking were a partial cause of her copd. 17 in other words, they have said, "look, her 18 efforts at quitting were a legal cause of her 19 getting copd." 20 now, why did they admit that? they had to 21 admit that. mrs. warrick, as mr. shields just told 22 you in his closing argument, never even -- never -- 23 never tried to quit until 1991. when did 24 dr. bagnoli diagnose her with copd? 1991, same day, 25 same day. 1 so if you -- i mean, it says, "the duration and 2 frequency of her efforts." there were none. there 3 were no efforts -- there was no duration, there was 4 no frequency, there were no efforts to quit before 5 1991. 6 all right. so what does this mean? what does 7 that admission mean? now, they said it. and i 8 do not want to overlook it. when they made that 9 admission, they tacked on that they think that 10 philip morris and r.j. reynolds are responsible, 11 too, right? that is the way they worded their 12 admission. but they admitted that mrs. warrick was 13 in control -- this is what this means. 14 what that means is that they have admitted that 15 mrs. warrick could have quit smoking in time to 16 avoid her copd and her lung cancer, and her lung 17 cancer. it means that eveline warrick's decisions 18 were a direct, substantial contributing factor to 19 her copd and her lung cancer. 20 that is this actual test for determining 21 whether something is a legal cause. that is what 22 they admitted, and you will see it in the 23 instructions; you will see it in the instructions. 24 all right. why did they have to acknowledge 25 this? it is because you now know -- you had a window 1 into the life of mrs. warrick. if you go back to 2 that question of control, who was in control of 3 mrs. warrick's decisions about beginning smoking, 4 continuing to smoke? 5 and another way of looking at that is, every 6 day when mrs. warrick woke up and looked in the 7 mirror, was there somebody else looking back that 8 was responsible for what she did that day? was 9 there somebody else who was looking back saying, 10 "no, today you will or will not start smoking; today 11 you will or will not decide to quit; today you will or 12 will not decide to not smoke anymore?" 13 is mrs. warrick different than anybody else? 14 was there somebody else in the mirror, really and 15 truly? 16 remember when i put this timeline up -- and 17 it is the very same timeline, very same timeline, no 18 changes -- and i said, "you know what, we are going 19 to walk through mrs. warrick's life." and i'm just 20 going to take you right back through it, because -- 21 well, i'm not going to make all the stops i did 22 before. i do not have -- i'm not going to take that 23 much of your time. 24 but i did not change anything on this timeline. 25 and mr. shields said i did not -- i did not develop 1 the evidence that represents many of the stops on 2 this timeline. but you know what? i'm going to 3 show you the evidence in each and every one of the 4 stops that relates to mrs. warrick, each and every 5 one. because i've been doing this a very long time, 6 and i'm not going to put something on a timeline 7 that i create that i cannot support. i'm never going 8 to do that, never. 9 mr. shields said i misrepresented the evidence 10 in this case. i'm never going to do that, never. 11 i explained to you in my opening statement that 12 the evidence would show that mrs. warrick was born 13 into a family where the dad -- i did not say he was a 14 tobacco farmer. i said he grew his own tobacco, and 15 he did. that is exactly what the evidence showed. 16 he grew his own tobacco for his personal use. he 17 gave it to his father-in-law. he grew it so that he 18 could make cigars, cigarettes, snuff, chewing 19 tobacco. that is what i told you, and he did, and 20 she testified to it. 21 i said he grew it, he harvested it, he cured 22 it, he flavored it, he cut it up, and he turned it 23 into cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco and snuff. 24 and that is what the evidence showed. 25 now, who did he enlist to assist him in that 1 task? eveline warrick. you remember what i said -- 2 and i do not have the testimony -- i did not bring 3 this testimony because i did not know he was going 4 to -- mr. shields was going to say what he said -- 5 but you remember i said that the evidence would show 6 that the one thing she wanted out of his estate when 7 he died was that knife that he used to make those 8 cigars and cigarettes to cut up the tobacco. 9 and you remember in her deposition she said -- 10 and i got it -- "that is the one thing i wanted and i 11 got it." 12 was that important to her? mr. shields said 13 that she did not smoke his cigarettes. well, in 14 fact, that is not true. 15 this is on? thanks. 16 here's the testimony. now, let me tell you why 17 you see this on printed form like this. it is 18 because -- although you see a videotape, whenever 19 there is a video being made, a videotaped deposition, 20 they also have a court reporter there, and she takes 21 everything down and they turn it into a booklet just 22 like this. and so that is why you see this. 23 and this is the actual transcript -- this is 24 the work of -- you have seen this team of court 25 reporters coming in and out. they actually make 1 daily copy of what goes on in this courtroom. so 2 this is the actual trial transcript. 3 so this is mrs. warrick testifying on the 4 video -- 5 whoops. did i just do something bad? i did. 6 i pushed that button. 7 thank you. saved my life. 8 so this is the actual testimony. 9 "i did not start smoking until i was 13. i did 10 try some of daddy's cigarettes." 11 i did try some of daddy's cigarettes. 12 "when was that?" 13 "i was about 14 years old, i guess, 12, 13 or 14 14 after i started smoking." 15 "how did you get ahold of some of his 16 cigarettes?" 17 "i just wanted to try one of them and he gave 18 it to me." 19 "okay. what did you think of it?" 20 "it was a lot better than lucky strikes." 21 "so you thought his tobacco was pretty good?" 22 "huh?" 23 "his tobacco was pretty good, you thought?" 24 "yeah, i can remember it, the difference in the 25 taste." 1 "okay. and this was just a roll-your-own 2 cigarette" -- 3 "uh-huh." 4 -- "made with his tobacco?" 5 "uh-huh." 6 "and what was different about the taste?" 7 "it was just -- it was not as strong, and it had 8 more of a flavor taste to it or something." 9 "by flavor taste, what do you mean, a 10 particular flavor or" -- 11 "well, not like a vanilla flavor or anything 12 like that. it just had a -- kind of a sweetish 13 taste to it a lot. i can remember it." 14 you know, this is when she was 13 years old. 15 how many years later -- this is 2009. she can still 16 remember the flavor of his cigarette. 17 "okay. did you frequently smoke the cigarettes 18 made from his tobacco" -- 19 "no." 20 -- "or was it just one time?" 21 "just tried them a couple of times maybe." 22 so, sure, she tried her dad's cigarettes. 23 i would leave that down, except it blinds me. 24 all right. who else smoked in that family? 25 well, you know that her dad smoked. you know that 1 her mom did not. you know that her grandfather did, 2 because sometimes he would get some of her dad's 3 cigars. you know that her older sister, annie 4 marie, smoked. you know that because you have heard 5 that testimony in this case. 6 now, why did mrs. warrick begin smoking? well, 7 i'm not going to tell you that she did not say that 8 she thought it was glamorous. she said -- you can 9 see a passage in her deposition where she says she 10 thought it was glamorous, advertising, everyone was 11 doing it, everyone was doing it. and, yes, her dad 12 smoked; her older sister smoked, the sister she was 13 really close to; her friend nancy smoked. lots of 14 people smoked, no question about it. 15 you remember, though, i asked dr. goldberg -- i 16 put up that chart that had four things on it. it 17 was parents, peers, siblings and environment. and i 18 asked dr. goldberg -- remember, dr. goldberg was the 19 guy -- the old professor who went to that seminar, 20 seminar -- went to that conference of plaintiffs' 21 lawyers on how to win big verdicts in tobacco cases, 22 how to find jurors in mock trials who would be 23 favorable to the plaintiffs' side of the case; you 24 remember that? he is the guy that i -- they asked 25 him, "how much money have you been paid?" and he 1 said "600,000." and then i said, "well, wait a 2 minute. five years ago you said you have been paid 3 700,000. did you give some money back?" 4 and he said, "no, i did not give any money 5 back." 6 and then i said, "well, you calculated that you 7 made another $50,000 a year over the last five 8 years, so that would be about a million bucks you 9 made?" 10 well, i asked him, "in all of the 20 or 25 11 cases that you have looked at, have you ever seen a 12 fact scenario like that?" a factual scenario where 13 you had a -- where you had a family that was that 14 into making their own tobacco company, making their 15 own tobacco products -- "factual background like 16 that?" and he said, "no, i have not, no." 17 so what were the influences that caused 18 ms. warrick to begin smoking? i think it is 19 awfully clear in her case -- and this is all 20 about mrs. warrick. this is not about the 21 american public. this is not about some -- this 22 is not a class action. this is just about 23 mrs. warrick, right? you know that. 24 all right. so that is starting smoking. 25 advertising. did mrs. warrick talk about 1 advertising? yeah, she said a lot about 2 advertising. 3 i'll do it one at a time. 4 and this is what she said. and, look, just so 5 you know that it really did come in a trial 6 transcript, for every entry that i've shown you, 7 i've put at the bottom the exact page and line 8 numbers on the transcript, just like i showed this. 9 every page is numbered and the lines are numbered. 10 so you know that what i'm showing you is right out 11 of the trial transcript. 12 so mrs. warrick was asked about advertising. 13 mr. shields said we did not ask her enough questions. 14 did not ask enough detail. but i'll show you. we 15 asked -- i'll show you that mr. shields did not show 16 you what we did ask. 17 "when did you and your husband have this 18 conversation about the marlboro man?" 19 "oh, we used to laugh, talk about it when it 20 would come on tv all the time." 21 "okay. so that was when it was on television?" 22 "uh-huh." 23 "and what about it made you laugh?" 24 "it was such a stupid commercial to me." 25 that is what she thought about advertising. 1 let us see some more. let us see some more. 2 mrs. warrick said a lot of stuff. 3 "did you ever talk about cigarette 4 advertisements to anyone other than your husband?" 5 "oh, yeah, i've talked about it, but who and 6 when i cannot remember. another one i always thought 7 was stupid, the virginia slims." 8 "virginia slim?" 9 "that one to me is a disgrace to women." 10 was she being positively influenced by 11 advertising? let us see some more. 12 "were there any other cigarette advertisements 13 that you thought" -- misspelled, sorry -- "were 14 stupid?" 15 "i'm sure there were a lot of them, but i just 16 do not remember them because, well, they had no 17 reason for me to remember them." 18 and then here sort of sums it all up. 19 "anything else, any specific ad?" 20 "not really a specific ad." 21 "okay." 22 "i really do not pay that much attention to 23 ads." 24 and is that really any different than anybody 25 else, really? if you went out on the street and 1 interviewed people, do you think they would say, 2 "you know what? cigarette ads are why i started 3 smoking. cigarette ads are why i kept on smoking," 4 really and truly? 5 let us go to the '50s. 6 yes, wynder and graham. their first witness, 7 their first live witness, dr. proctor, said, "with 8 wynder and graham's study looking at groups of 9 people, smokers and nonsmokers, who got lung cancer 10 more often?" 11 and he said, "that is when science -- even 12 though people had been trying to engage in science 13 before they got -- they got conflicting results -- 14 but as of 1950 using what they call 'epidemiology,' 15 the science started to take hold connecting smoking 16 with lung cancer." 17 1950, 1953, science is starting to grow, no 18 doubt about it. was it a secret from the american 19 public? you remember i showed you life magazine -- 20 i showed you-all those magazines. you are going to 21 have them. you are going to have them. this was no 22 secret from the american public, no secret at all. 23 and you will have the mag- -- i mean, was life 24 magazine a secret? reader's digest a secret? come 25 on. 1 now, mr. shields talked about the frank 2 statement, and, yes, there is no doubt that the frank 3 statement was published. 4 now, that is why we have to talk about legal 5 cause for just another minute. because i told you 6 at the beginning of this trial that during the 7 course of this trial you would see things that the 8 cigarette manufacturers -- ideas that people had, 9 statement peoples made -- statement people -- 10 statements people made, and recommendations people 11 had that today i would not do and you would not do, no 12 doubt about it. 13 i said they clung too long to the idea that 14 smoking had not been proven to cause lung cancer or 15 other diseases. they clung too long to the ideas 16 that smoking was not addictive. no debate about it. 17 but this is not a class action. this is not about the 18 american public. this is about one person. and 19 what the plaintiffs have the burden of proving in 20 this case is that something that philip morris or 21 r.j. reynolds did actually was a legal cause of 22 injury to mrs. warrick, actual legal cause of injury 23 to mrs. warrick. 24 legal cause -- this is the way i think -- this 25 is a little diagram that i've created that i think 1 is helpful in terms of thinking of legal cause. and 2 what is that? whatever it is, whatever it is, 3 whether it is a newspaper ad or an interview on 4 television or something like that, there has to be 5 a direct connection between whatever it is and 6 ms. warrick such that it had a substantial impact 7 and then it can be a legal cause. 8 so as we go through this, i'm just going to be 9 asking you guys to consider, is that something that 10 had a direct connection with mrs. warrick that 11 resulted in having a substantial impact so that it 12 was a legal cause of why she either began smoking, 13 continued to smoke or did not quit smoking until 14 1990 -- or did not begin to quit smoking until 1991 15 or did not quit smoking until 2000 at thanksgiving. 16 all right. so let us use as our first example 17 this frank statement. where was it published? did 18 anybody come here and say it was published in 19 anything that -- any newspaper that mrs. warrick was 20 ever even close to? was -- mrs. warrick was asked 21 specifically, "have you ever heard of something 22 called a frank statement to cigarette smokers? 23 "a what?" 24 "a frank statement to cigarette smokers." 25 "that, i'm not familiar with." 1 did that have a direct connection, a 2 substantial impact, was it a legal cause of anything 3 for mrs. warrick? well, you know the frank 4 statement did not cause her to start smoking, because 5 the frank statement did not get published until 6 january of 1954. she is been smoking for five years, 7 right? so it sure as heck did not cause her to 8 start. 9 did it cause her to continue to smoke? was 10 there any evidence of that? well, there cannot be 11 because she did not know anything about it and, 12 frankly, there is no evidence that it was ever 13 published in a paper that she could have ever seen. 14 well, how about -- mr. shields had spent a lot 15 of time, i think the majority of his closing 16 argument -- talking about things that philip morris 17 or r.j. reynolds thought internally, wrote an 18 internal memo about, or something like that. 19 so mrs. warrick was asked point-blank, 20 point-blank -- mr. shields said she did not get asked 21 enough direct questions. she was asked point-blank, 22 "have you ever heard a cigarette company make a 23 statement about smoking and health?" 24 "not the cigarette companies." 25 there is the page and line. 1 "well, how about the council for tobacco 2 research" -- i'm sorry -- "how about the tobacco 3 industry research committee? do you know if you 4 ever heard any statement made by the tobacco 5 industry research committee?" 6 "no." 7 "no, you did not?" 8 "no, i did not. i do not remember hearing 9 anything that they did." 10 "well, how about the council for tobacco 11 research or the tobacco institute, organizations 12 with connection to philip morris or r.j. reynolds? 13 have you ever heard any statement made by the 14 council for tobacco research?" 15 "no, not that i know of." 16 "do you know if you have ever heard a statement 17 made by the tobacco institute?" 18 "of the what?" 19 "the tobacco institute." 20 "i do not think so." 21 so, again, is there a direct connection that 22 has a substantial -- that had a substantial impact 23 that resulted in a legal cause of injury to 24 mrs. warrick? and how could it be? it would have 25 to be something that caused her -- since it did not 1 cause her to start smoking, it would have to be 2 something that she heard or saw or read that caused 3 her to continue to smoke. 4 all right. now, let us go back to the timeline. 5 and let us go to the late '50s. 6 i'm going to put this right over here. 7 mr. shields brought up this "annie marie 8 situation" in the late '50s. and he said that i had 9 misrepresented what the testimony was about annie 10 marie's situation. and i'm going to show you right 11 now i did not misrepresent a thing. 12 here's the exact testimony. 13 "do you know when she was diagnosed with copd?" 14 this is annie marie's copd. 15 "probably back in the late '50s." 16 "how did you find out about her being diagnosed 17 with copd?" 18 "talking to her" -- "talking to her and going 19 with her to and from the hospitals and the doctors' 20 offices." 21 and he said we did not ask enough details; we 22 did not find out when. 23 "so did you take her to the doctor then?" 24 "the late '50s, many times." 25 many times. but she was asked more detail than 1 that. 2 mr. shields said, you did not ask whether or not 3 the doctor said it was caused by her smoking. 4 mr. shields said you did not ask -- here's more of 5 the transcript testimony. 6 "when she was diagnosed, did you-all talk with 7 the doctors about what was causing the copd?" 8 "yes." 9 "what did they say?" 10 "they said it was her heavy smoking, and she 11 was a welder during the war in the shipyards. they 12 were constantly on her to quit smoking." 13 this is -- i appreciate that they would like 14 to not have this testimony on the record, but it is 15 there. there is the transcript right there. this is 16 the late '50s. this is their own client. 17 now, they want to have a whole bunch of excuses 18 for why this testimony occurs. but that is her 19 testimony. that is her testimony. 20 "what was causing the copd?" 21 "yes." 22 "what did they say?" 23 "heavy smoking, and they were constantly on her 24 to quit smoking." 25 now, mr. shields suggested, well, this cannot be 1 right because she said the doctors used the phrase 2 "copd" and that did not get coined or used until mid 3 '60s. 4 well, i've got two suggestions for you in that 5 regard. the first is, i asked dr. proctor, their 6 science historian, a ph.d. in the history of 7 science -- i asked him point-blank, "there were 8 doctors who were telling their patients in the '50s 9 'i'm diagnosing you with any of those diseases, it is 10 all one and the same, chronic obstructive lung 11 disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 12 that is copd, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and 13 telling them it is caused by your smoking,' right, 14 and that is in the '50s?" 15 and he said, "i'm sure some were, yes." 16 "and you would agree with me that if you were 17 being told by your physician that that is the 18 diagnosis and in the physician's opinion that is why 19 you have it, that would be a powerful source of 20 information letting you know about the health risks 21 of smoking, would not it?" 22 and dr. -- their expert said, "i would hope it 23 would be powerful." 24 of course it would be powerful. imagine 25 sitting with -- a sister sitting with the sister 1 she is particularly close to, the sister she loves, 2 and listening to the doctors diagnose her with copd. 3 what are the symptoms of copd? chronic cough, 4 shortness of breath. who said so? their expert, 5 dr. burns, their expert. 6 chronic bronchitis, you remember dr. -- 7 dr. proctor just got through telling you that 8 they are all interchangeable, chronic bronchitis, 9 emphysema, copd, cold. it is all the same, it is all 10 the same. 11 "chronic bronchitis is usually used either to 12 refer to just a chronic cough or to be a synonym for 13 chronic obstructive lung disease." 14 this is all coming from their witnesses, their 15 client, their experts. 16 so as of the late '50s -- and we sure got 17 plenty of detail -- as of the late '50s, what does 18 mrs. warrick know? she knows -- she sat there with 19 her sister many times in the hospitals and the 20 doctors' offices listening to the doctors look right 21 at her sister and say, "you have copd." 22 now, maybe she used the term "copd" because 23 she is going to watch her sister over the next 25 24 years with this illness. 25 you remember dr. andrews, the guy from tampa, 1 he came here and told you, "this is a long-standing 2 disease. this is a disease that you have for 3 decades." and he said, "the symptoms are chronic 4 cough, shortness of breath." and he told you, 5 "look, doctors diagnose that, especially family 6 practitioners, internists, they diagnose you with 7 copd all day long based on chronic cough and 8 shortness of breath." 9 well, here she is in the late '50s, her 10 sister's got copd, and the doctors have told you, 11 "it is due to your smoking." is that a powerful 12 piece of information for mrs. warrick? does she 13 decide that at that moment that she is going to make 14 any effort to quit smoking? is she going to give up 15 the pleasure that she derives from smoking? 16 look, this is -- we are here because a lawsuit is 17 been brought. i'm telling you this story. i'm 18 telling you about this why? because we are in 19 litigation. 20 is this a criticism of mrs. warrick? 21 absolutely not. this is america. you get to make 22 up your mind here whether or not you are going to 23 smoke or not. you get to decide for yourself. you 24 get to look in the mirror every morning, and you get 25 to say i'm going to drink beer. i'm going to drink 1 scotch. i'm going to smoke cigarettes. i'm going 2 to smoke cigars. i'm going to smoke a pipe. i'm 3 going to eat mcdonald's. i'm going to -- i'm going 4 to live my life. that is what we get to say here in 5 america. we fought for that right. 6 all right. let us go to the '60s. 7 throughout the '60s mrs. warrick is going to 8 be with her sister, right? does not go away. her 9 sister lives in this town. ms. warrick lives in 10 this town. she is going to watch her from the late 11 '50s all the way through to her death in 1985. 12 yes, mrs. warrick said i did not know about the 13 health -- another point in her deposition. she 14 said, "i do not know about the health" -- "i did not 15 know about the health risks of smoking until the 16 late '80s." 17 people say things that just do not make any 18 sense sometimes. how can that be possible, right, 19 with this history? 20 and you remember in my opening statement i 21 talked about the "roy kitchen" story. and i said, 22 you know what? it is not perfectly clear, not 23 perfectly clear, that mrs. warrick connected roy 24 kitchen's death from cancer with his smoking; pretty 25 clear, but i said in my opening statement, not 1 perfectly clear. and here's the testimony. i 2 did not pull any punch on that. 3 "okay" -- this is mrs. warrick. this is the 4 page and line. 5 "okay. do you know what roy died of?" 6 "cancer." 7 "okay. and when did he die?" 8 "back around '64 or '65." 9 "okay. did you relate the cancer of any of the 10 kitchen boys to their smoking?" 11 "yes." 12 now, that is not crystal clear, but pretty 13 close. 14 now let us see in just a minute just exactly how 15 crystal clear we are about another kitchen. 16 1964, the surgeon general's report -- you know, 17 mrs. warrick -- you are going to see the coverage. 18 you saw the coverage. and, frankly, i'm going to 19 show you harry reasoner right now, because you will 20 remember this was what was on all three channels 21 back in the day, cbs, abc and nbc, and this is what 22 the broadcasters were telling you about the surgeon 23 general's report. 24 can we play that, shreve (phonetic)? thanks. 25 (a video clip was played and transcribed by the 1 court reporter to the best of her ability as follows:) 2 announcer: "this is a cbs news extra on 3 smoking and health, the findings of the surgeon 4 general's committee." 5 harry reasoner: "almost from the moment that 6 cigarettes were introduced they were attacked. but 7 the attacks took a new turn ten years ago and 8 culminated in today's report by the surgeon 9 general's committee. 10 "this, in summary, is what the committee says. 11 cigarette smoking is a major cause of lung cancer in 12 men, and data on women smokers points the same way. 13 cigarette smoking is a significant cause of cancer 14 of the larynx and probably the most important cause 15 of chronic bronchitis. cigarette smoking may be 16 related to other lung diseases. 17 "male smokers have a much higher death rate 18 from heart disease, although it is not proven that 19 smoking is the cause. 20 "on the question of filters, the committee says 21 there is no evidence that they do any good, but it 22 did not exclude the possibility that an effective 23 filter might be developed. 24 "in short, the committee said, 'if you smoke 25 cigarettes, you increase your chances of dying 1 early. the sooner you start, the more you smoke, 2 the more you inhale, the worse your chances are.' 3 "in this kind of a country, it comes down to 4 you, whether you like it or not. no one is going to 5 forbid an adult to smoke, and it is now quite clear 6 that no one is going to tell him it is good for him 7 either. 8 "the decision is his, the decision and the 9 health that may depend on it. 10 "this is harry reasoner. goodnight." 11 (the video clip was ended.) 12 mr. reilly: i cannot tell you whether or not 13 mrs. warrick saw that broadcast. i know that their 14 addiction expert, dr. frazier, wishes what harry 15 said was not true. remember one of the first things 16 i asked her on cross-examination is, "you are a 17 person who wishes that americans did not have the 18 choice to smoke, are not you?" she said, "yes, i 19 wish americans did not have the choice to smoke." 20 that is all right. you are welcome to your opinion, 21 but, as harry said, "in this country we do have that 22 choice." 23 she also said she is never met somebody -- she is 24 never had a patient come to her who said, you know 25 what, i enjoy smoking and i do not want to stop. she 1 said she is never had anybody say that. 2 1966, the first warning labels go on the 3 package of cigarettes. "caution: cigarette smoking 4 may be hazardous to your health." 5 we asked mrs. warrick in detail about that 6 warning and other warnings, in detail. 7 "what did you think when the warning labels 8 first went on the packs?" 9 "i really did not think anything." 10 "okay. did it surprise you?" 11 i'm going to sneeze -- do not take it down. 12 maybe i'll talk myself out of it. 13 "did it surprise you?" 14 "not really. i just did not pay any attention 15 to it, i guess." 16 "did that warning tell you anything you did not 17 already know?" 18 did it tell you anything you did not already 19 know? 20 "i do not think so." 21 how do you square that with "i did not know 22 about the health risks of smoking until the 23 late '80s?" 24 "were you not concerned that there was a 25 warning on the cigarettes that you were smoking?" 1 "i just did not really pay any attention to it, 2 i guess." 3 "okay. well, why not?" 4 "probably busy with something else." 5 "that is okay. you do not have to pay attention 6 to them if you do not want to." 7 "would you not have paid attention to warning 8 labels on cigarettes because you loved your 9 cigarettes?" 10 "probably." 11 did mrs. warrick enjoy smoking? you bet she 12 did. she enjoyed smoking for a variety of reasons. 13 "because you loved your cigarettes?" "probably." 14 what did she enjoy about cigarettes? i did not 15 take out each and every line item, but these are 16 generally the reasons why she said; she said she 17 enjoyed the taste, especially the cigarettes 18 manufactured by philip morris, the saratogas, 19 socialization, relaxation, boredom, and the pleasure 20 you get from smoking, and the pleasure you get from 21 smoking. 22 all right. let us go back to this timeline. 23 thelma kitchen, late '60s, early '70s. she 24 said -- i will not tell you what i said. i'll just 25 read it to you. 1 mr. shields said she did not know -- she was not 2 connecting her friends' death from cancer to their 3 smoking until the late '80s. this is exactly what 4 she said about thelma kitchen's death. and 5 mr. shields, in his closing argument, did not even 6 mention thelma kitchen, did not even bring her up. 7 he only talked about the kitchen boys, remember? 8 "okay. what did thelma die of?" 9 "she had cancer." 10 "what kind of cancer; do you know?" 11 "it was lung cancer and throat cancer." 12 "do you remember the decade? was it the '60s 13 or '70s?" 14 "i think it was the late '60s or early '70s, 15 somewhere in there." 16 "okay. did you relate her smoking to her 17 cancer?" 18 "thelma, i did, uh-huh." 19 now, does that lack clarity? did she say, "no, 20 not until the '80s, the late '80s," or did she say, 21 "thelma, i did, uh-huh"? did i misrepresent this to 22 you in some way? 23 did mrs. warrick -- at any point in this time, 24 did mrs. warrick give any indication she had any 25 interest in quitting smoking? did she say, "i want 4613 1 to quit smoking. i want to give up the pleasure i'm 2 getting from smoking. i want to try to quit. i'm 3 going to" -- no, not once. mr. shields said it, 4 and he was right, in his closing argument, that 5 mrs. warrick did not make any effort to quit smoking 6 until 1991. and that is okay. we get to make those 7 decisions. but now we are in a lawsuit. 8 the '70s, 1970, the pack warning changes. 9 you have already seen what mrs. warrick said about 10 warnings. i think mr. block, when cross-examining 11 dr. hayes, said, "well -- but she smoked," what did 12 she say, a half a million cigarettes? that means 13 she had a half a million opportunities to look and 14 see whatever the warning was at the moment, right? 15 at least 300,000 opportunities since the warnings 16 went on the packs in '66, right? 17 i put on this timeline eveline tells gail, 18 "smoking is dangerous." you know where that came 19 from was the testimony of dr. hayes yesterday. 20 dr. hayes was given all the depositions in this 21 case. 22 now, we did not read -- we did not read all the 23 depositions that were obtained in this case. but an 24 expert gets to review them all, gets to review them 25 all. and so that is where she got this statement. 1 "eveline told her daughter gail, 'smoking is 2 dangerous.'" and that is what dr. hayes told you 3 from the stand, in 1971. 4 now, 1971, joe cullman. and mr. shields just 5 played it for you. and, like i said, philip morris 6 clung too long to the notion that smoking had not 7 been proven to cause illness. no doubt about it. 8 did mrs. warrick watch face the nation and see 9 joe cullman? you already saw her statement, "i 10 never heard a thing the tobacco industry ever said 11 about smoking and health, not once." 12 so, once again -- i will not put it up -- once 13 again, has mr. shields satisfied the obligation of 14 that hard thing you have got to look at, and that is, 15 did he prove that there is a legal cause connection 16 between philip morris's statement by joe cullman and 17 mrs. warrick continuing to smoke? you already know 18 the answer to that. 19 or jim bowling, do you remember -- do you 20 remember on that interview, the interviewer has a 21 british accent. why is that? because that was for 22 a program shown in england. is there any evidence 23 in this case that mrs. warrick ever went to england? 24 none. was there any evidence that she ever saw jim 25 bowling, james bowling? 1 mr. shields said, well -- but we did not bring 2 you any of these people. these people are dead. 3 they were old adults in the '70s, right? that is 40 4 years ago. 5 1975, ms. warrick -- now, is that exactly when 6 they switched to saratogas? nobody really knows 7 because we do not really -- she was not really clear. 8 she actually thought she switched to saratogas in, 9 like, '70, '71, which was not possible, because, as 10 you learned from dr. goldberg, saratogas were not 11 made until 1970 for the very first time. 12 okay. so i put it on the board at the very 13 first opportunity, 1975. i did not -- i did not 14 quibble about that. 1975. i accept it. and how 15 long did she smoke saratogas? they do not really 16 know. but i'll give her ten years, ten years of 17 smoking out of 50 years of smoking history. i said 18 '85 [sic], fine. why quibble about it? 19 why did she switch to saratogas? because of 20 advertising? no. she actually gave two reasons. i 21 have one on the board. i'll tell you about both. 22 they were talking about -- in this part of the -- of 23 the deposition, they were talking about her husband 24 switching to pall malls. and so the question was: 25 "probably the same sort of thing when he started 1 pall malls, they were just out of your brand that 2 day?" this is talking about how she switched to 3 saratogas. 4 "uh-huh." 5 "and you got a new brand and decided it was all 6 right?" 7 "i know that is how i started on saratogas." 8 i know that is how i started on saratogas. 9 "they are out of my brand at the store so i pick 10 another, (inaudible) saratogas, and i liked them." 11 "did you like the taste of the saratoga better 12 than the taste of the viceroy? 13 "yeah." 14 so did she continue to smoke saratogas? yes. 15 did mr. warrick say, "we like saratogas. we liked 16 them best"? yeah. okay. so that is why they 17 switched. 18 now, the '70s. mr. shields said that i was 19 terribly overstating mrs. warrick's situation in the 20 '70s in connection with her cough. he said, "all 21 she had was a cough." and he said that i said that 22 the doctors told her to quit. i never said that. 23 i told you in my opening statement that her 24 doctors told her, dr. sapp in particular, said, 25 "your cough and your breathing problems are due 1 to your smoking." and now i'm going to show you 2 that testimony. and this is from their client, 3 mrs. warrick. 4 "when did the cough get worse?" 5 "actually, back in the '70s it got" -- what did 6 she say? she did not say i have a little cough. she 7 said, "it got pretty bad." 8 "and you were seeing dr. sapp at that time; is 9 that correct?" 10 "uh-huh." 11 "and was he telling you then that the cough was 12 related to the smoking?" 13 "yes. he had the same problem." 14 mr. shields said we did not ask enough 15 questions. we asked some more questions. i was not 16 there. i did not ask the question, but were more 17 questions asked? you bet. 18 "did you tell him you were having breathing 19 problems?" 20 "he knew it, yeah. we discussed it." 21 so here we are, her cough got bad, she is having 22 breathing problems, dr. sapp knows it. 23 "did he tell you that the breathing problems 24 were related to the smoking?" 25 there is the page and line. 1 "yes, many times." 2 now, you know, she stopped seeing dr. sapp in 3 the '70s, early '80s, something like that. now, do 4 we have his medical records? no, we do not have his 5 medical records. he is been dead. his records are 6 gone. but this is their own eveline warrick's 7 testimony. for this to be wrong, she is got to be 8 inaccurate. they have to run away from her 9 testimony. they have to say, "no, no, do not believe 10 her. believe her when she says something we like, 11 but do not believe her when she says something we 12 do not. she is inaccurate. she is sick. she is not 13 able to recall things correctly, right"? 14 "yes, many times." 15 "many times. and that was back in the '70s?" 16 "yeah." 17 did i make this up? there is the page and line 18 of the transcript. 19 breathing problems, bad cough. what are the 20 symptoms of copd? what symptoms has her sister had 21 now since the late '50s? what diagnosis has she sat 22 there and listened to the doctors give to her 23 sister? and she is sitting right there. right 24 there. right there. 25 yes, it relates to the third question on the 1 verdict form. and what is that third question? 2 "did eveline warrick know or by the use of 3 reasonable care should she have known, before may 4 5th" -- this is in the '70s. her sister's diagnosis 5 is in the late '50s. she is at dr. sapp's office. 6 she follows with dr. barnhart. this is in -- that is 7 in the '70s. that is 20 years before may 5th, 8 1990 -- "that she had chronic obstructive pulmonary 9 disease and that it was reasonably caused by the 10 defendants' actions?" what is that? making 11 cigarettes. 12 well, you know, this issue was addressed by 13 both dr. bagnoli and dr. andrews. they asked 14 dr. bagnoli, "dr. bagnoli, did she know she had copd 15 before 1991? should she have known that she had 16 copd before 1991?" and dr. bagnoli said, "no." but 17 then on cross-examination, dr. bagnoli was asked, 18 "did you have mrs. warrick's deposition?" 19 and he said, "no." 20 he was asked, "do you know about her being 21 cared for by dr. sapp or dr. barnhart?" 22 "no." 23 "do you know about her breathing problems? do 24 you know about her chronic cough in the '70s?" 25 "no." 1 "do you know about her sister annie marie and 2 her copd diagnosis in the late '50s and her disease 3 and her death in 1985?" 4 dr. bagnoli sees mrs. warrick for the first 5 time in 1991. annie marie has been dead now for six 6 years. did dr. bagnoli know anything about annie 7 marie? not a thing. he was asked, and he said, "i 8 do not know." 9 we gave dr. andrews -- you remember the 10 pulmonologist that came from tampa that runs the -- 11 that works at the va, runs their -- what do they 12 call it, the -- i forget exactly the clinic that he 13 runs, but it is the tumor clinic, basically, where 14 they cannot -- it is really hard to figure out -- all 15 the doctors are sending in their difficult cases to 16 see whether or not these people have lung cancer or 17 not. 18 and we asked dr. andrews -- who we gave the 19 deposition of mrs. warrick to, so he knew that she 20 saw dr. sapp in the '70s and that she had seen 21 dr. barnhart. he knew about her -- her description 22 of her chronic cough, her description of her 23 breathing problems. he knew about annie marie's 24 diagnosis in the '50s, and he knew about annie 25 marie's death. 1 and so i asked him these three questions. 2 "let me ask you this, is there anything that 3 would have prevented mrs. warrick from being 4 diagnosed with copd in the late '70s?" 5 "no." 6 and you remember dr. andrews explained to you 7 that copd is a long-running disease, that you go 8 from mild to moderate to severe. when she sees 9 dr. bagnoli in 1991, what does he diagnose her as? 10 severe. so that means that she is had this disease 11 for decades, right? that is exactly what dr. andrews 12 told you, no dispute in this case. no dispute. 13 so does she have copd when she sees dr. sapp 14 and dr. barnhart in the '70s and '80s? sure, she 15 does. dr. andrews told you she does, and it is not 16 disputed by anybody, nobody. 17 so then the question was posed to dr. andrews: 18 "is there any reason why she would not have been able 19 to reasonably determine that she had copd in the 20 late '70s?" 21 "no." 22 "is there any reason why she could not have 23 asked dr. sapp or dr. barnhart, 'what is the nature 24 of my reason -- of my illness'"? 25 just asked, "what is the nature of my illness?" 1 you see, this question does not just say, "did 2 you know." it says, "could you reasonably have 3 determined?" "could you reasonably have 4 determined?" 5 "by the use of reasonable care, should she have 6 known before may 5th?" that is the '70s and the 7 '80s. 8 those answers by dr. andrews are not disputed 9 by anybody that actually knew the history that 10 mrs. warrick provided, not disputed by anybody that 11 knew the history. 12 you can keep your expert in the dark if you 13 want and then ask him the question and he will answer 14 you based on the information he has. that is why i 15 think it is important to give the expert all the 16 information. give him the history. 17 all right. that is the '70s. let us go to the 18 '80s. 19 you are being very patient with me. 20 '80s. 1985, annie marie dies of copd and lung 21 cancer. mrs. warrick's testimony that they are 22 relying on that she does not know about the health 23 risks of smoking that say that she does not know 24 until the late '80s, her sister dies in 1985. the 25 warnings on the packs now say explicitly "smoking 1 causes lung cancer." 2 and just to show you -- you know, they 3 suggested that philip morris or r.j. reynolds should 4 have put a list of the carcinogens in cigarette 5 smoke on the packs maybe or in an ad in the 6 newspaper. 7 after all of this, after all of this, can you 8 reasonably say that mrs. warrick would have changed 9 how she operated her life one bit if philip morris 10 had put a list of the carcinogens on a pack of 11 cigarettes? 12 you do not leave your common sense at the door 13 to this courtroom or the security checkpoint. you 14 bring it right on into the jury box. you bring it 15 right on into the jury deliberation room. 16 maybe even more dramatic, 1988, calvin has a 17 heart attack. mrs. warrick -- they say it is due to 18 his smoking. mrs. warrick testifies -- "what 19 specifically did you tell your husband after his 20 heart attack about quitting smoking?" 21 "i said, we both needed to quit." 22 "did you" -- 23 "but even i did not try until 1991." 24 so here she is talking about calvin does not 25 try. and she says "even i did not try until 1991," 1 three years later. 2 now, she sat there and watched her husband have 3 a heart attack. do you really think for a minute 4 that if philip morris or r.j. reynolds had put 5 something on a pack of cigarettes about carcinogens 6 in cigarette smoke that she would have done 7 something different than she did, really and truly? 8 all right. i've already shown you the -- 9 there is no dispute that mrs. warrick did not try to 10 quit until 1991. mr. shields started his closing 11 argument off by telling you that. 12 okay. i've already shown you the medical 13 records regarding 1993. mr. shields showed you the 14 tobacco industry's ceos testifying before congress, 15 as was shown on c-span in 1994. is there any 16 indication in this case that mrs. warrick ever saw 17 those guys on c-span? no. 18 did i tell you in my opening statement that i 19 thought they clung too long to the idea that smoking 20 was not addictive? you bet i did. but did it have 21 an impact in this case, in mrs. warrick case? 22 because they have to prove that it was a legal cause 23 of injury to mrs. warrick. 24 direct connection, substantial impact, legal 25 cause. 1 thanksgiving day she quit smoking. no dispute 2 as to how that happened. 3 "and, i do not know, there was just something 4 about that dog that was telling me, 'you got to 5 quit.' and i was sitting there smoking a cigarette. 6 i put it out, and i never put another one in my 7 mouth.'" 8 now, remember i asked both addiction experts, 9 but especially dr. hayes, "that "quit" on 10 thanksgiving, does that raise a question as to 11 whether or not somebody's addicted to have those 12 brain changes when the nicotine is going to be gone 13 over the next," what did she say, "half-life of a 14 day and a half, two days?" 15 so when are the -- "if you are going to have 16 withdrawal symptoms because you have an 17 up-regulation or an increased number of 18 neuroreceptors and they are all crying out for 19 nicotine, when are you going to have withdrawal 20 symptoms?" 21 "you are going to have them in the first week or 22 two weeks," she said. 23 did mrs. warrick have any of that? she was not 24 on nicotine replacement. she had no medication, but 25 she had no withdrawal symptoms, no irritability to 1 lack of concentration, no craving, no difficulty. 2 no difficulty. no difficulty. 3 all right. that takes us back to the first 4 question on the verdict form "was she addicted" and 5 leave that to your discretion. "was addiction, if 6 she was addicted, the legal cause of her developing 7 her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?" i 8 believe the answer to this one is no. 9 on that question about whether she 10 reasonably -- with reasonable care should have known 11 before may 5th, 1990, that she had copd, because we 12 know she had it, the answer to this one is yes. 13 all right. and if that is the way you answered 14 those questions, that ends your responsibilities in 15 this case. that is the way this verdict form is set 16 up. 17 actually, it says -- shreve (phonetic), can we 18 do this? is it this one? 19 video tech operator: you just have to uncover 20 it. 21 mr. reilly: thanks. 22 "only if you answer both the first two 23 questions yes and you question" -- "and you answer 24 question 3 no do you go on to question 4." 25 only if you answer the first two questions yes 1 and if you answer the third question no do you go on 2 to question 4; otherwise, your work here is done. 3 if you go on to question 4, then you have to 4 answer the question, "was eveline warrick's lung 5 cancer a legal cause of her death?" and that is a 6 question that mr. engram is going to talk to you 7 about when i sit down. 8 all right. and that is the first verdict form 9 that you are going to have. depending upon how you 10 answer that, you may have no verdict forms after 11 this. your work would be done. 12 sorry. next page. you have to answer question 13 number 5. if you answer those questions, you have 14 to answer both was her -- "was lung cancer the legal 15 cause of her death or was copd the legal cause of 16 her death?" so you have to answer both of those if 17 you answer questions 1 and 2 yes and question 3 no. 18 all right. now, there is a second verdict form. 19 if you -- and i do not think you go beyond that. i 20 think the evidence in this case has shown you do not 21 go any farther than that and your work is done. 22 but there is another verdict form, and i 23 probably should go through it with you, so i will. 24 and i will not spend nearly as long going through this 25 as i did through the other one -- or through that 1 evidence. you have been very considerate. 2 now, let me remind you that the decisions by 3 that jury in miami ten years ago have nothing to do 4 with answering a single question on this first 5 verdict form, nothing. this is all you guys. these 6 findings do not even apply -- they do not have any 7 impact whatsoever unless you have to go to the 8 second verdict form. 9 and i do not know -- the two verdict forms are 10 virtually identical, if you go on, whether it is a 11 survival action or wrongful death action. so i've 12 just picked one. and i'm just going to run through 13 these questions. and, yes, if you get here, those 14 jury findings from the jury in miami ten years ago 15 would be binding on you, but you still have to 16 determine whether or not any of those activities -- 17 do you have a marker? 18 -- any of those findings were a legal cause of 19 mrs. warrick's -- this is the wrongful death action 20 verdict form. you have to decide whether any of 21 those activities were a legal cause. and that is 22 true all the way through. 23 for each one of those theories, you have to 24 make the determination of legal cause. you have to 25 make the determination of whether or not those 1 things had a direct connection, a substantial 2 impact, and were a legal cause. 3 and as an example of that -- oh, for example, 4 number 2, "state whether the defendants" -- "state 5 for each defendant whether the fraudulent 6 concealment was a legal cause of eveline warrick's 7 death." 8 you have to ask yourself, did the plaintiffs 9 prove in this case that anything that philip morris 10 or r.j. reynolds failed to say about the health 11 risks of smoking actually caused mrs. warrick to 12 die. 13 if you answer those questions in that way, then 14 you get down to question number 7. matter of fact, 15 you are going to have to answer, i think, about ten 16 or 11 more questions. but you would get down ultimately 17 to question number 7 at one point. and you would have 18 to apportion responsibility between mrs. warrick, 19 philip morris, r.j. reynolds, and there you would be 20 having to determine whether someone has acknowledged 21 that they had the power, the ability, but did not 22 exercise it to quit, and quit in time to avoid 23 getting any illness whatsoever. 24 does somebody else really have a percentage of 25 responsibility in why they got sick and why they 4630 1 died? was there really somebody else looking in the 2 mirror or when they had the power, when they had the 3 ability to stop smoking, stop in time to avoid 4 getting their illness altogether? 5 and that brings us to -- the only thing i'll 6 say about damages -- i really do not talk about 7 damages. the only thing i'll say about damages is, 8 we stipulated to the dollar amount of the -- of the 9 medical bills and funeral expenses, because we do not 10 dispute things that should not be disputed, should not 11 be disputed. 12 now, as far as mr. spruance was concerned, the 13 only thing i'll say about that is that all 235- or 14 -45,000 dollars, the warricks did not pay a penny of 15 that. they never shelled out any money for somebody 16 to come spend the night with the warricks. they 17 never spent any money to have somebody come and cook 18 a meal or clean their house. those were all things 19 that mr. spruance thinks that they should have 20 gotten, should have had available to them. and so 21 that is how he made his calculation. that is how he 22 made his calculation. 23 okay. then we come to the final question, and 24 that is -- number 11, and that is, "under the 25 circumstances of this case, please state whether" -- 1 sorry -- "by clear and convincing evidence punitive 2 damages are warranted against each defendant." 3 and i will tell you once again, in the 4 instructions you are going to see that this is not 5 something in the air. this is not in general. this 6 is not a class-action question. this is about 7 mrs. warrick. this is about mrs. warrick and what 8 conduct of philip morris or r.j. reynolds actually 9 impacted her, actually impacted her. 10 now, if you answer that question, then your 11 work will not be done. there'll be another session, 12 there'll be another opening statement, more 13 evidence, closing argument. so your work will not be 14 over. 15 all right. i want to con- -- oh, one other 16 thing. mr. shields said that all that evidence we 17 put in about newspaper articles, magazine articles, 18 videos, he said that was only limited until about 19 1970 or '71 and then it all petered out and it was 20 all shown after midnight, and all that kind of 21 stuff. 22 you will have these back in the back with you, 23 but we selected -- mr. bradford, in particular, 24 selected just examples of those public service 25 announcements. and, of course, you saw the harry 1 reasoner cbs news report. that, of course, was not 2 at midnight. 3 the bill talman announcements, that is 1967; the 4 "killers" ad, that is where the cowboys come in, 5 that is '68; the snakebite where the snake comes out 6 and bites you, that is '69; the "nice and clear" 7 where the ashtray empties out, that is '69; the 8 warnings where they had all of the various warnings, 9 that is an example. that was '69. 10 the obituary of bill talman, walter cronkite. 11 you know walter cronkite was not on at 2:00 on the 12 morning. that is '69. 13 the huff and puff, that is '70; "dreams," that is 14 '70; "great american smokeout" with ed asner, '77; 15 "great american smokeout" with ed asner, '78, while 16 larry hagman's are in the '80s. it did not stop. it 17 did not stop. 18 all right. you guys have been very patient and 19 very attentive. and so i thank you. 20 i'm going to sit down and mr. engram is going 21 to get up. he is going to talk to you about -- i'm 22 sure he will talk to you a bit about r.j. reynolds, 23 but he is also going to talk to you about what caused 24 her death. 25 and now after i -- after both of us sit down, 1 then mr. shields gets to get back up and he gets to 2 address you again, because he has the burden of 3 proof on everything but the statute of limitations. 4 he has to show you that they brought a bigger 5 mountain of evidence in this case about 6 mrs. warrick, connecting to mrs. warrick than we 7 did. 8 and i will not get to get back up, nor will 9 mr. engram. and we will not have another opportunity 10 to come back and say, hey, wait a minute. 11 mr. shields mischaracterized what i said in my 12 opening statement or he did not give you all of the 13 causation, legal cause instruction, he did not give 14 you all of the quotes. i will not get to do that. 15 so all i would ask is that as he makes -- and 16 he has another hour to talk to you, if he wants to 17 use it. so all i would ask is that you just think 18 in the back of your mind, what does this have to do 19 with mrs. warrick? does this really connect to 20 mrs. warrick, really, in a direct way resulting in a 21 substantial impact. because that is what you are 22 going to get in the instructions. 23 thank you very much. 12 mr. engram: thank you, your honor. 13 ladies and gentlemen, i want to thank you, too 14 for the time that you have spent here for the last 15 three weeks. when mr. reilly back during jury 16 selection in the courthouse downtown talked about 17 jury duty, he talked about it being both a privilege 18 and a responsibility. 19 well, i also think that it is a great sacrifice 20 for you to be away from your families, and your 21 jobs, and spend this time and give this attention to 22 the case and the witnesses and the evidence, and on 23 behalf of mr. latham and myself and our client r.j. 24 reynolds, we really do appreciate that. our system 25 would not work without people like you that make this 1 kind of sacrifice. 2 what i want to talk about with you about today 3 is the evidence we presented on a couple of issues 4 because of eveline warrick's death and the work that 5 the scientists and other employees at r.j. reynolds 6 tobacco company have been doing over the last 60 7 years. 8 but before i talk about that, i want to look 9 back at these last nine days of testimony and make 10 three observations. first of all, i like to think 11 of the closing statement as a report card. you get 12 to check off the things, the promises that we made 13 to you in our opening statement and see if we were 14 held to those promises. 15 the second thing, though, not only is this like 16 a report card, but i wondered -- i wondered during 17 closing, i wondered during the presentation of 18 evidence, during the witnesses who testified, were 19 the plaintiffs and the defendants trying the same 20 case here. 21 we told you when we came -- when we began our 22 opening statement that this case was about, first 23 and foremost, mrs. warrick. it was about what she 24 knew about the risks of smoking; it was about the 25 choices mrs. warrick made; it is about what diseases 1 and conditions that she had; and it is about what 2 caused her death. that is what we told you this case 3 was about. 4 the plaintiff, though, on the other hand, has 5 spent very little time talking about mrs. warrick. 6 they have tried to retry that first engle case. and 7 they brought generic experts, general experts, 8 experts who knew nothing about eveline warrick to 9 prove a case of general company conduct, to prove 10 the case of some unknown plaintiff. and, certainly, 11 they did not prove the case of mrs. warrick. 12 we know that mrs. warrick knew nothing about 13 the frank statement. we know during their closing 14 they put up seven documents. and as mr. shields put 15 those documents up on the screen and said that they 16 were representative of the millions of pages of 17 documents, that is what dr. proctor told you, he put 18 up company documents from 1953, 1961, 1962, 1963, 19 1967, 1969 and 1972. 20 he put up two ads. he put up two ads. and do 21 you remember what cigarette brands they were about? 22 the first one was old gold and the second one was 23 for camels. 24 eveline warrick did not smoke old gold and she 25 did not smoke camels. why would he be showing you 4646 1 these ads about somebody else's brands of 2 cigarettes? old gold is not even made by philip 3 morris or r.j. reynolds. 4 and the last observation i want to make is that 5 we put in part of our case through our 6 cross-examination of plaintiff's witnesses. and so 7 even though the plaintiffs took six days to present 8 their evidence through their witnesses and the 9 defendants took only three days, when we are 10 cross-examining their witnesses, we are putting on 11 evidence as well which we believe proves our case. 12 so do not just think about the defendant's case 13 as being the evidence that you heard tuesday, 14 wednesday and thursday of this week. think about 15 what other evidence we elicited when we 16 cross-examined the plaintiff's witnesses. and i'm 17 going to try to highlight some of the things those 18 witnesses said. 19 so let us talk about the evidence you heard on 20 the cause of mrs. warrick's death. you heard in 21 plaintiff's opening statement that they told you 22 that mrs. warrick's death was caused by her cancer 23 and her treatment for her cancer or from her copd. 24 well, which one was it? those are three 25 different potential causes. but more importantly, 1 they never told you how her copd or how her lung 2 cancer or how her treatment for her lung cancer 3 caused her death. they never answered the 4 how-she-died question. 5 they had dr. bagnoli testify that mrs. warrick 6 died from both her copd and her lung cancer, even 7 though he could not tell you how either of those 8 diseases caused mrs. warrick's death. and, 9 remember, dr. bagnoli said that the autopsy report 10 that calvin warrick requested at the insistence of 11 norma warrick did not say she died from copd, did not 12 say she died from her lung cancer. 13 they brought dr. nurani, the radiation 14 oncologist, who treated mrs. warrick. he never said 15 that copd caused mrs. warrick's death. and what did 16 he say about the cause of death? we had a few 17 questions at the end of his videotaped deposition. 18 but remember, he said that a medical examiner, a 19 forensic pathologist would be a better expert to 20 testify on the cause of death. 21 and that is the kind of expert we brought you in 22 dr. mark shuman, the medical examiner from 23 miami-dade county. and what did he say on copd? 24 well, he said that mrs. warrick's copd was stable 25 for many years and that the autopsy, with respect to 1 her lung cancer, that the autopsy showed that she 2 had no cancer in her lungs; that the chemotherapy 3 treatment had worked and the autopsy doctors could 4 not find any evidence of cancer in her lungs at the 5 time she died. nor did the autopsy doctor find any 6 evidence of pneumonia when mrs. warrick died. 7 and it is almost as if they are telling you, we 8 do not know how mrs. warrick died. we know she had 9 copd; we know she had lung cancer. it must have 10 been one of those; we are going to leave it up to you 11 to decide. but that is not the way it works, ladies 12 and gentlemen. you have to base your decision on 13 the evidence in this case. 14 mr. shields, in his closing, was not talking 15 about cause of death but he -- i wrote this down -- 16 he said, data or not, use your common sense. well, 17 data is a type of evidence. you are not going to be 18 instructed by judge boyer, evidence or no evidence, 19 use your common sense. 20 we want you to use your common sense, but you 21 have to rely on evidence in making your decision. 22 and the plaintiff's witnesses do not provide you with 23 any evidence as to how mrs. warrick died. and 24 because they do not, they cannot meet their burden of 25 proof on the cause of death. 1 let us look at how mr. reilly and i, though, 2 proved to you that mrs. warrick's sudden cardiac 3 death was caused by a grossly enlarged heart that 4 was electrically unstable and that resulted in her 5 heart going into v. fib, ventricular fibrillation. 6 there were only two witnesses who talked about how 7 mrs. warrick died when her heart stopped beating, 8 when it went into sudden cardiac arrest. 9 dr. bishopric, the cardiologist from the 10 university of miami school of medicine and 11 dr. shuman, the medical examiner and forensic 12 pathologist from miami-dade county. and what did 13 they say specifically about mrs. warrick's heart 14 that we can agree on? well, let us get out the 15 report card. 16 in my opening i said we would prove 17 mrs. warrick had an enlarged heart, and we did that. 18 you will have the autopsy report. you will have the 19 medical records, and there are numerous references 20 to the enlarged heart. 21 we told you in opening mrs. warrick's heart 22 weighed 650 grams at autopsy. and we proved that. 23 you have it in the autopsy report. 24 we also proved that the normal weight for a 25 woman's heart is 300 grams. both dr. shuman and 1 dr. bishopric testified to that. both of them 2 testified that high blood pressure causes 3 hypertrophic heart disease. hypertrophic was one of 4 those medical terms for an enlarged heart. 5 both of them testified that mrs. warrick's 6 weight contributed to her enlarged heart. 7 the evidence is in the medical records 8 mrs. warrick weighed over 200 pounds until april of 9 2009. 10 you will see the photomicrographs, the actual 11 slides of the tissue from mrs. warrick's heart and 12 her heart was filled with scar tissue and fat at 13 autopsy. 14 dr. bishopric talked about how genetics play a 15 role in an enlarged heart. enlarged hearts are more 16 vulnerable to arrhythmias. both dr. shuman and 17 bishopric testified to that and they both said that 18 smoking does not cause an enlarged heart or 19 hypertrophic heart disease. 20 and that is what our report card shows. 21 you know, the plaintiff did not call 22 mrs. warrick's treating cardiologist or medical 23 examiner. and the plaintiff has the burden of 24 proving the cause of mrs. warrick's death in this 25 case. they have filed the wrongful death claim and 1 it is their burden to prove that she died a death due 2 to something our clients did or failed to do. 3 in fact, not only did mrs. warrick have one 4 cardiologist, she had at least two cardiologists. 5 do you remember when dr. bagnoli came here, 6 mrs. warrick's lung doctor, and said mrs. warrick 7 was seeing dr. ramezani, a cardiologist before she 8 ever started to be treated with me? 9 well, doctor -- and the other cardiologist that 10 we know mrs. warrick saw was a dr. baker and you will 11 see those medical records from the baker gilmour 12 cardiovascular institute. but why did not they bring 13 mrs. warrick's own heart doctors to court? well, i 14 think you will find the answer in the medical records 15 that we showed you with dr. shuman and dr. 16 bishopric. 17 in 2002, dr. ramezani is one of the heart 18 doctors who found that mrs. warrick had electrical 19 problems with her heart. this is an ekg and at the 20 top you have mrs. warrick's name, the date, december 21 12, 2002, sinus tachycardia with occasional 22 premature supraventricular complexes. 23 and dr. shuman testified, as did dr. bishopric, 24 that premature ventricular complexes are these 25 electrical problems, arrhythmias, irregular rhythms 1 in the heart. 2 tachycardia was one of those types of 3 arrhythmias where the heart beats too fast. and so 4 in december of 2002 we have evidence from 5 dr. ramezani that mrs. warrick had electrical 6 problems with her heart. 7 remember, too, the other piece of evidence that 8 we put up from dr. ramezani; the cardiac 9 catheterization that he did in 2001. dr. ramezani 10 did this catheterization six months after 11 mrs. warrick had quit smoking in thanksgiving of 12 2000, finding that the left main coronary artery is 13 normal in size and free of any significant disease. 14 the left anterior descending coronary artery is 15 also free of any significant disease. 16 the circumflex coronary artery is normal in 17 size and appears to be free of any significant 18 stenosis. 19 so six months after mrs. warrick quit smoking, 20 her coronary cardiac catheterization is normal. 21 and what about dr. baker, of the baker gilmour 22 cardiovascular institute? in april of 2008 23 dr. gilmour interpreted mrs. warrick's 24 echocardiogram and he said it showed good ef. 25 dr. shuman said ef stood for ejection fraction, but 1 significant cardiomegaly. and y'all remember what 2 cardiomegaly was? it is just another word for -- 3 medical term for enlarged heart. 4 so is it any wonder why the plaintiffs did not 5 call dr. ramezani or dr. baker when they knew that 6 both of her cardiologists had records that were 7 damaging to their theory about the cause of 8 mrs. warrick's death? 9 let us talk about what dr. shuman, the medical 10 examiner, did to determine the cause and manner of 11 death. remember, that is what he said that forensic 12 or autopsy pathologists do, and he is somebody that 13 does 200 a year. he does -- he is done 2500 14 autopsies during the course of his practice as a 15 forensic pathologist. 16 and dr. shuman said that a medical examiner 17 determines the chain of events that lead to death. 18 and that chain of events actually comes right off 19 the death certificate, what they are required to find 20 in the death certificate. 21 and in mrs. warrick's case, there are basically 22 what i'll call three links in the chain of events. 23 the first link is her longstanding high blood 24 pressure. well, we showed you and we will just run 25 through these quickly. every year of her life that 1 we have medical records for, from 1982 and then 2 beginning again in 1998 through april of 2009, 3 mrs. warrick had high blood pressure readings 4 recorded in her medical records. 5 did they get better? sure they did. but she 6 had 12 years of high blood pressure and the toll 7 that that took on her heart is the second link in 8 this chain of events. 9 she had an enlarged diseased electrically 10 unstable heart; a heart that weighed 650 grams at 11 the time she died, more than twice the size of a 12 normal person's heart; so much fat that not only did 13 it surround the heart, but it infiltrated both the 14 left and right ventricles and scarring. remember, 15 interstitial fibrosis was just another medical term 16 for scarring in the heart muscle itself. 17 that is the second link. the enlarged heart is 18 the second link in the change of events that led to 19 mrs. warrick's death. 20 you know, dr. shuman talked about the enlarged 21 heart. he is the one that put up dr. baker's 2008 22 report that i showed you a moment ago. and 23 dr. shuman, in discussing enlarged heart, said that 24 they are electrically unstable, that they are more 25 vulnerable to these electrical problems, they are 1 more vulnerable to arrhythmias and irregular 2 heartbeats. 3 and he also testified that mrs. warrick had 4 progressively worsening irregular heartbeats, so 5 much so that by october of 2007 she had a 24-hour 6 holter monitor, and this showed two things. did not 7 blow up the first thing, but it showed sinus 8 bradycardia. well, that is the opposite of what she 9 had in that earlier record with dr. ramezani when 10 she had tachycardia. that is the fast irregular 11 heart rhythm. bradycardia is a slow irregular heart 12 rhythm. 13 and then -- but dr. shuman wanted to point out 14 that the computer recorded 1,310 isolated premature 15 ventricular contractions -- premature is early -- 16 ventricular contractions. 17 what did they say about how many premature 18 ventricular contractions a normal person has? they 19 said you should not have any; zero. 20 this was not the only test that we -- 21 mrs. warrick had run and that we brought and 22 presented to you. in july of 2009 we know that 23 mrs. warrick underwent placement of a loop recorder 24 similar to a holter monitor, except it actually, as 25 dr. bishopric described, gets placed inside just 1 under the chest skin. 2 and why had she been having -- why did she have 3 this loop recorder? because she fainted at home in 4 the bathroom, and when she fainted she fell and hit 5 her head in the bathtub. well, the loop recorder 6 showed that she had periods where her heart just 7 stopped beating for more than three seconds. 8 and we used this description on the heart 9 monitor that you see on tv shows, instead of seeing 10 a regular heartbeat, for three seconds it would flat 11 line. mrs. warrick had to have a pacemaker put in 12 july 2nd, 2009 to treat this period -- this period 13 where her heart stopped beating for periods of more 14 than three seconds. 15 link number three. what is the final link in 16 the chain of events? well, that final link is the 17 v. fib, the ventricular fibrillation. on the day 18 that mrs. warrick died she was found with no pulse, 19 not breathing for 20 minutes, but with an electrical 20 rhythm; an electrical rhythm that the jacksonville 21 fire and rescue described as v. fib or ventricular 22 fibrillation. 23 and remember that dr. shuman described v. fib 24 as the heart muscle just quivering -- not pumping, 25 not beating -- just quivering. 1 what did the jacksonville fire and rescue call 2 it? the ems? they found -- they reported what they 3 found when they initially arrived. on initial 4 contact there were no pulses, no heartbeats, with a 5 v. fib rhythm. 6 primary impression: cardiac arrest. 7 secondary impression: cardiac rhythm 8 disturbance. 9 the evidence is overwhelming that mrs. warrick 10 had a severe electrical problem with her heart and 11 the chain of events establishes that this is what 12 caused her death. 13 you know, there was even a time in 2007 with 14 dr. zenk, one of mrs. warrick's partners, where she 15 was skipping a heartbeat. her heart, regularly 16 irregular. not isolated. regularly irregular with 17 four skipped beats per minute. 18 what is her diagnosis? her diagnosis is 19 arrhythmia. it is a little bit covered up here. and 20 for the plan for that first diagnosis, for diagnosis 21 number one, patient to see her cardiologist in a few 22 weeks. what did dr. zenk want to do? she did not 23 want to wait a few weeks. she wanted her to have a 24 holter monitor right then. and it is the holter 25 monitor that she has two years later with -- in 1 fact, the date on that -- i'm sorry, could you go 2 back? i just want to correct something there. 3 the date on this -- do we have the first page? 4 i see it is on the title but i believe the actual 5 date is july 21, 2007. 6 that exhibit is defendant's exhibit 44. it is 7 in the record, and you will be able to review it, but 8 that is my recollection, is that the date is july 21, 9 2007. 10 it is not until 2009 when she is having these 11 fainting episodes that they actually do anything to 12 treat mrs. warrick with this heart electrical 13 problem that she has. 14 you know, dr. bagnoli knew about this. he came 15 and testified to you that, you know, in his opinion, 16 it was either copd or lung cancer. did not tell you 17 how, but he knew that when he saw mrs. warrick in 18 july of 2009, he knew enough that when mrs. warrick 19 had these fainting -- recurring fainting spells, he 20 knew enough to suggest to her doctors that they 21 needed to consider cardiac arrhythmias. 22 and, finally, dr. bishopric explained that the 23 type of pacemaker that mrs. warrick had had a dual 24 chamber pacemaker designed to make sure that the 25 heart did not go below a certain critical level. but 1 mrs. warrick's heart just was not beating on 2 schedule. it was stopping for periods of greater 3 than three seconds. it was skipping beats -- four 4 beats, every minute. those are the kinds of issues 5 that she had when the fire and rescue found her. 6 now, let us go back to dr. shuman's three links 7 in the chain of events for a moment. 8 longstanding high blood pressure; enlarged, 9 diseased electrically unstable heart; and 10 ventricular fibrillation. 11 you know, dr. shuman was asked a question on 12 cross-examination by mr. shields, and i just want to 13 go through each of these points with respect to 14 their testimony so there is no confusion. 15 dr. shuman and dr. bishopric both agree that 16 ventricular fibrillation was the final link in the 17 chain of events leading to mrs. warrick's death. 18 there is no dispute about that final link. 19 dr. shuman and dr. bishopric both agree that 20 mrs. warrick had this massive enlarged heart, more 21 than twice the normal size for a woman, and there is 22 no dispute about that. 23 and dr. shuman and dr. bishopric both said that 24 high blood pressure, longstanding high blood 25 pressure can cause a heart to become enlarged. you 1 know, dr. shuman explained that the heart is a 2 muscle and it gets larger when it is put under 3 stress, just like any other muscle in the body. 4 and i asked dr. shuman if high blood pressure 5 was the only thing that can cause an enlarged heart 6 and he said, no, obesity can do it, valvular heart 7 disease, genetic defects can also cause enlarged 8 hearts. 9 dr. bishopric was also asked these same 10 questions by mr. reilly. and it is in the 11 transcript, 3713, why did mrs. warrick's heart get 12 so big? 13 and dr. bishopric said, she does not know why 14 people's hearts get big in every case. sometimes 15 the cause is clear, like when they can do a genetic 16 test and determine it, and sometimes it is not. 17 well, there was no genetic test done at the 18 autopsy. so we do not know whether genetics 19 contributed to her enlarged heart. 20 but dr. bishopric added, that mrs. warrick had 21 hypertension, and that certainly did not help. she 22 was a very heavy woman and the heavier you are the 23 bigger your heart gets, it is just the way it is. 24 mr. reilly then asked dr. bishopric, does 25 hypertension, high blood pressure, affect the size 1 of your heart, and her answer was, yes, it does, it 2 makes it bigger. 3 let us talk about what the -- and remember -- 4 remember what the jacksonville fire and rescue 5 records says, cardiac rhythm disturbance. what did 6 the examination of the heart tissue itself show? 7 the doctor who performed the autopsy made slides to 8 look at mrs. warrick's tissue, not just from the 9 lungs, but all of the tissues from her autopsy to 10 look at under the microscope. and we had some 11 pictures of the tissues from her heart and these 12 showed that mrs. warrick's heart was diseased. 13 remember, dr. shuman came down and pointed out 14 that these were the fat cells, these white clear 15 circles were all the fat cells surrounding 16 mrs. warrick's heart. and that all of this, these 17 black dots, these cells between the long pink or 18 purple fibers, the muscle tissue itself of the 19 heart, that all of that was abnormal. it should not 20 have been there. but it was evidence of an 21 inflammation and fibrosis and the significant 22 disease and damage that mrs. warrick's heart had. 23 and that is what the autopsy report finding is 24 with respect to the heart. hypertrophy of the 25 heart. 650 grams. large amounts of fat. fat 1 outside. fat inside. fat in two ventricles. and 2 scarring in the heart muscle itself. that is all 3 uncontroverted. 4 dr. bagnoli said, no, they got that wrong. he 5 never said anything of the sort. and you will have 6 these medical records and these pictures with you 7 when you retire to the jury room to begin your 8 deliberations. nothing in that autopsy report will 9 suggest to you that mrs. warrick died from her 10 cancer or died from her copd. and we would ask that you 11 answer those questions on the verdict form, 12 questions 4 and 5 -- and your honor, i do think 13 there is a typo in the verdict form that we will have 14 to correct. that should be, please proceed to 15 question 5 -- was eveline warrick's lung cancer a 16 legal cause of her death? 17 the overwhelming evidence is, no. 18 was eveline warrick's copd a legal cause of her 19 death? 20 mr. reilly talked to you about legal cause. i 21 will not repeat that. the answer is, no, based on the 22 overwhelming evidence. 23 do not ignore the data. do not ignore the 24 evidence. 25 you know, mr. shields wants you to believe that 4663 1 a woman who is 181 pounds or 200 pounds, somewhere in 2 that neighborhood was cachectic. well, that is 3 another medical word that i had to get my dictionary 4 out to understand. but a person who is cachectic is 5 wasting away. and you remember he asked dr. shuman 6 about it. do not you think she was cachectic? do not 7 you think she was wasting away? 8 and she said, no, there is no way that a woman 9 who weighs 200 pounds is cachectic. it is not just 10 dr. bishopric's opinion. the autopsy report does not 11 describe mrs. warrick as frail or cachectic. 12 the autopsy report says, in describing her 13 abdomen, her stomach, her belly is what i'd call it, 14 that the abdomen was soft to palpation, without 15 masses, and protuberant, sticking out, secondary to 16 obesity. and what was the diagnosis in the autopsy 17 report? under accessory diagnosis, the first 18 accessory diagnosis is moderate obesity. there is no 19 way mrs. warrick was cachectic when she died 20 february 7th, 2010. 21 why did lung cancer not contribute or cause 22 mrs. warrick's death? well, let us talk about 23 dr. shuman's testimony. dr. shuman told you, based 24 on the autopsy report, there was no cancer found in 25 her lungs. they had -- she had ten nodules in her 1 liver that were less than a half an inch in 2 diameter. but the tumor and the liver was stable. 3 they did not even know that the cancer had spread to 4 her brain. they did not know that when they removed 5 her brain. they did not know that when they looked 6 at her brain without the benefit -- without the 7 benefit of microscope. when they simply looked at 8 it using the naked eye, they did not identify any 9 cancer in mrs. warrick's brain. it was only when 10 they made these slides to look under the microscope 11 that they found what dr. bishopric called 12 micrometastasis, metastasis that can only be seen 13 under the high power of a microscope. 14 and just as importantly, mrs. warrick had no 15 symptoms of liver failure or brain dysfunction when 16 she died. 17 the plaintiffs want you to believe that because 18 mrs. warrick had pneumonia some three weeks before 19 she died when she went in to the hospital that 20 somehow she died of lung cancer. now, i do not know 21 how you make the leap from pneumonia that is 22 resolved after you are in the hospital to death by 23 lung cancer. i just do not see how you can do that. 24 dr. bagnoli never said how mrs. warrick died 25 from her lung cancer. and dr. shuman explained why 1 the autopsy proves that she did not die from her lung 2 cancer. remember, dr. shuman showed you the 3 discharge summary from her hospitalization in 4 january when she was sent home february 3rd, 2010. 5 and remember, one of her diagnosis, one of the 6 things that they monitored, that they found while 7 she was in the hospital in january was atrial 8 fibrillation with controlled ventricular response. 9 she continued to have electrical problems with her 10 heart while she was in the hospital in january. 11 but this is what the doctor said right before 12 he sent her home: given her overall condition, she 13 did quite well. she was somewhat slow to improve, 14 but did gradually improve. she is doing much better 15 at the time of discharge. her shortness of breath 16 is significantly improved. her pancytopenia has 17 resolved. 18 do you remember when mr. shields was arguing 19 that she was immunosuppressed? there is no question 20 that when she went in on january 18th she was 21 immunosuppressed. when she went home, her 22 pancytopenia had resolved. her hemoglobin and her 23 hematocrit has been stable, meaning she is not 24 anemic, and she is now cleared for discharge home. 25 they sent her home and told her to follow up 1 with her doctors in one to two weeks. the doctors 2 had sent her home from memorial hospital did not 3 think she was going to die four days later. 4 and, remember, how norma warrick was surprised? 5 i asked her about the autopsy, why it came about 6 that an autopsy was asked for in this case. and she 7 was surprised at her mother's death. she was 8 surprised because her mother had been getting 9 better. she had this piece of paper, the pet scan 10 that said that the cancer was gone from the lungs. 11 she was getting better, not worse. and she said to 12 her father, daddy, do not you want to know why momma 13 died? that is the reason she convinced her father to 14 ask for an autopsy. she was not frail. she was not 15 cachectic. she did not die from her lung cancer or 16 her copd. 17 remember, we told you in the beginning that 18 this case is all about eveline warrick. it is about 19 the choices that mrs. warrick made, it is about the 20 fact that she was morbidly obese, as her doctors 21 called it, and that the obesity contributed to her 22 high blood pressure. her high blood pressure 23 contributed to her enlarged heart, her massive 24 enlarged heart, as dr. shuman described it. and it 25 was because of this enlarged heart that she had and 1 was susceptible to and prone to these heart rhythm 2 irregularities. 3 and that is what caused her heart to stop 4 suddenly in february of this year when she was found 5 by the fire and rescue in v. fib, no pulse, not 6 breathing, and she had been down for 20 minutes when 7 they arrived. 8 that is the chain of events that caused her 9 death in february of this year. not any cigarettes 10 that she smoked, remembering that she had quit 11 nearly ten years prior to her death on thanksgiving 12 day in 2000. 13 now, when i started my closing, i told you i 14 also wanted to highlight some testimony that we 15 elicited on cross-examination from plaintiff's 16 experts, dr. burns, dr. proctor, and dr. farone 17 regarding the research that had been conducted at 18 r.j. reynolds over the last 60 years. 19 and you will remember that the plaintiffs 20 introduced a number of documents, not just medical 21 records, but company documents from what dr. proctor 22 described as tens of millions of pages, millions of 23 documents. and we have already highlighted the 24 documents that the plaintiffs listed in their 25 closing, which you would think would be the most 1 important documents that they would want to present 2 to you to prove their case. 3 the newest document from that list in 4 plaintiff's closing was from 1972. well, here's all 5 of the documents out of the tens of millions of 6 pages that r.j. reynolds, that american tobacco 7 company, and that brown & williamson tobacco company 8 generated, that they brought to you, they brought 9 you one from the 1920s. nothing from the '30s and 10 '40s. nine documents from the '50s. three 11 documents from the '60s. nine documents from the 12 '70s. and three documents from the '80s. 13 25 documents out of tens of millions of pages. 14 and the most recent one out of all of those that 15 were just even commenced during the plaintiff's case 16 was 1984, 26 years ago. and i think some of you 17 were not even born 26 years ago. 18 what about some of the reynolds employees who 19 wrote these documents? you have heard dr. claude 20 teague, dr. alan rodgman, dr. frank colby. did 21 dr. proctor tell you that dr. colby's dead? did he 22 tell you when dr. teague or dr. rodgman retired from 23 reynolds, how many years ago, how many decades ago 24 they retired? these were documents written in the 25 '50s and '60s and '70s and these are people who are 1 no longer working at r.j. reynolds. brown and 2 williamson no longer exists. american tobacco 3 company no longer exists. 4 these documents were written at a different 5 time. they were written long ago, and some of them 6 were written as much as 50 to 70 years ago. but 7 this is a case that is taking place in 2010. 8 let me talk briefly about some of the things 9 that dr. burns testified to on cross-examination. 10 dr. burns told you that the council for tobacco 11 research or ctr funded grants for outside 12 researchers. he said that they funded many 13 distinguished scientists from the top universities. 14 remember, universities even here in the state of 15 florida. 16 that some of ctr's research was cofounded by 17 public health groups like the american cancer 18 society and the national cancer institute. 19 that hundreds, hundreds of ctr articles were 20 published in the peer-reviewed literature. 21 that hundreds of ctr articles were published in 22 the surgeon general's report. 23 and more than 50 million americans have quit 24 smoking. 25 and dr. burns finally told you that 80 to 90 1 percent of the 50 million americans who quit did so 2 cold turkey, without any aid or assistance. 3 you know, we asked dr. burns about smokers, and 4 whether -- he said many times that smokers are 5 responsible for their own smoking behavior. that is 6 dr. burns' belief. that is correct. 7 even if they are addicted, that smokers are 8 still responsible for their own smoking behavior, 9 correct? 10 yes, that is correct. the fact that someone is 11 addicted is a barrier for behavioral change, but it 12 does not free them from the responsibility for their 13 own behavior. 14 and dr. burns talked about the 1988 surgeon 15 general's report. you saw dr. koop on video clip. 16 this is what dr. koop wrote: cigarette smoking is 17 an addictive behavior and the individual smoker must 18 decide whether or not to continue that behavior. 19 who is decision is it? who is choice is it? 20 even dr. koop tells you it is the individual smoker's 21 choice and decision. 22 let us talk about a couple of other things that 23 dr. proctor admitted on cross-examination. he said 24 if either you or a family member were diagnosed with 25 copd or lung cancer and a doctor told you it was 1 caused by smoking, that would be a powerful source 2 of information on the risks of smoking? 3 and he said, yes. 4 he said yes, not knowing anything about eveline 5 warrick or her history about her sister annie marie 6 griffiths being diagnosed with copd and lung cancer. 7 but he agreed that that should be a powerful source 8 of information on the risks of smoking. 9 he also said that some people treated cigarette 10 warnings like they treated ads; they did not pay any 11 attention to them. 12 and mr. reilly has talked about the fact that 13 the warning labels are not the only way that smokers 14 learn about the dangers of smoking. 15 remember last monday after dr. goldberg 16 testified? i know dr. goldberg went home on friday, 17 but you came in on monday morning, mr. spruance was 18 here live, and so he testified, and then when 19 mr. spruance finished testifying, judge boyer read 20 to you and, remember, he is told you, when i read to 21 you, this is the law that i'm giving you. when i 22 talk to you, extemporaneously, i'm trying to explain 23 it. but he read to you the law after dr. goldberg 24 testified. 25 and what he said was, congress has determined 1 as of july 1, 1969 that cigarette warning labels 2 were effective as a matter of law. the adequacy or 3 the sufficiency of the warnings cannot be a basis 4 for a liability in this case after july 1, 1969. 5 and here are the warnings that eveline warrick 6 saw. 1966, 1970, and the four rotating warnings 7 beginning in 1985. these are the same warnings that 8 exist on every pack of cigarettes today. 9 these are the same warnings that eveline 10 warrick saw every time she took a cigarette out of 11 the pack. and you remember from my opening, we 12 calculated based on a pack-and-a-half a day, 365 13 days a year, 30 cigarettes in a pack-and-a-half 14 times 34 years with the number of warnings, 15 mrs. warrick was warned 372,300 times. and she was 16 more powerfully warned with her own personal family 17 experiences, families and friends. 18 back to dr. proctor's testimony. he 19 acknowledged that the surgeon general thanked philip 20 morris and r.j. reynolds and others for the 21 information they provided in that big green book, 22 the larson, haag and silvette collections. and he 23 also acknowledged, like dr. burns did, that rjr 24 scientists research was cited in the 1964, 1979, 25 1981, 1989, and 2000 surgeon general's report. 1 finally, with respect to dr. farone. you 2 remember dr. farone. he is the former philip morris 3 scientists who was fired. what did dr. farone admit 4 on cross-examination? well, dr. farone had the most 5 to say about r.j. reynolds research efforts. he 6 talked about tar reduction. he talked about r.j. 7 reynolds' conduct. 8 let us look at some of the things that 9 dr. farone admitted on videotape on 10 cross-examination by mr. latham. first of all, 11 dr. farone told you there is no current government 12 standard for what constitutes a safer cigarette, nor 13 has there ever been one. 14 he also told you that reynolds has devoted 15 historically a tremendous amount of financial 16 resources and scientific talent to try to develop a 17 safer cigarette. 18 that they worked beginning in the 1950s to try 19 to reduce the risks of cigarette smoking; and that 20 they acted as reasonable, prudent cigarette 21 manufacturer identifying and quantifying pah's and 22 other carcinogens in smoke. 23 reynolds also engaged in efforts to reduce the 24 constituents in smoke and he described that as a 25 reasonable approach to try to reduce the risks of 1 smoking. 2 he told you they used filtration, reconstituted 3 tobacco, porous paper, filter ventilation, an 4 expanded tobacco. and you saw all of those things 5 when mr. jupe testified, the expanded tobacco in the 6 glass jars, and the diagram of the cigarette -- the 7 cigarette cone. 8 reynolds was the first company to use 9 reconstituted tobacco. and when you compare the 10 cigarettes from the 1950s to the cigarettes of 11 today, tar and nicotine yields dropped more than 70 12 percent. 13 scientist at reynolds have published a lot of 14 information about cigarette smoke chemistry over the 15 years and they have been repeatedly recognized by the 16 surgeon general's report dating back to 1964. 17 dr. farone also said that in 1986 the cigarette 18 companies disclosed all the ingredients used in 19 their cigarettes to congress. 20 and, importantly, the u.s. government has never 21 told the cigarette companies to remove any 22 ingredient from their products. 23 and, finally, dr. farone talked about reynolds' 24 product stewardship program that works to make sure 25 that any product changes, including addition of new 1 ingredients, does not increase the inherent risks of 2 smoking. 3 you know, ladies and gentlemen, today is 4 october 1, 2010. it is not 1953. it is not 1964. 5 it is not 1966. it is not the 1970s. it is not 1984. 6 that is the case that you heard the plaintiffs put 7 on. the case you heard them put on was the engle 8 findings case. remember, the engle findings do not 9 answer the issues that you are here to decide. 10 before you can apply the engle findings, 11 remember -- and, you know, this sounds almost like 12 the craziest thing you have to do. but you have to 13 go back into that jury room and completely put the 14 engle findings that they have hammered to you out of 15 your minds. you have to decide the question of 16 whether or not eveline warrick was an engle class 17 member without consideration of a single engle 18 finding. 19 understanding that, remember, the engle jury 20 heard no evidence about eveline warrick, and the 21 findings that you will read and hear about do not even 22 mention eveline warrick. the engle jury did not 23 decide any issues specific to eveline warrick. it 24 did not decide on whether she relied on anything that 25 reynolds said or pm said -- philip morris said or 1 failed to say. 2 the engle jury did not decide that eveline 3 warrick was injured by any conduct of r.j. reynolds 4 or its predecessor companies or philip morris. 5 and the engle findings do not establish that 6 these defendants are liable to the estate of eveline 7 warrick. 8 philip morris and r.j. reynolds tried eveline 9 warrick's case. we put on evidence about her cause 10 of death. we put on evidence about mrs. warrick's 11 awareness. we put on evidence so that you could 12 decide the issues that the engle jury did not decide, 13 issues that they never considered. 14 and on behalf of r.j. reynolds and mr. latham, 15 i want to thank you for your time and for all of 16 your attention. 17 thank you very much.
