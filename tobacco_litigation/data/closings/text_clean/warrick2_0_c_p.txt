2 mr. shields: thank you, your honor. 3 we were talking about all of the massive 4 documentary evidence about their denials and 5 misrepresentations and concealment that cigarettes 6 caused cancer. 7 there is another aspect of that as well, and 8 that is their denials that cigarettes were addictive 9 long after they knew they were addictive and they 10 were internally researching how to manipulate the 11 content of cigarettes to make them more addictive. 12 one of the documents we have shown to you is a 13 1969 report from one of the premier researchers -- 14 you have heard his name time and time again from 15 philip morris -- dr. wakeham, in a presentation that 16 he made to the philip morris board of directors. 17 now, you may have had this implication from 18 time to time from the defense, that it is a scientist 19 here and a scientist there and they are not really 20 speaking for the company. this is the presentation 21 to the board of directors of their corporation, the 22 top people that run the company. 23 and what this document indicates is their clear 24 understanding of why people smoke and how to keep 25 them smoking. 1 they start by recognizing that they get smokers 2 to begin with when they are children, when they are 3 teenagers, and that they start smoking as teenagers 4 for reasons that have nothing to do with nicotine or 5 the cigarettes but have to do with glamorizing them, 6 feeling like they are an adult, for all of these 7 psychosocial reasons. that is why children begin to 8 smoke. 9 we are all going through -- all have gone 10 through that adolescence process, and that is what 11 happens. and they fully understood that. but how 12 do you keep them smoking after that point in time? 13 what this document recognizes is that their 14 understanding of how you keep them smoking is their 15 addiction to nicotine. 16 this was not only recognized in this document 17 to the board of directors, but they undertook a 18 massive internal investigation by dr. dunn. 19 the next document about nicotine's 20 addictiveness and the incentive to keep people 21 smoking by manipulating nicotine. 22 you are going to have all of these documents. 23 it is a lot of documents to look through. it is a 24 pretty massive pile over here. and among those you 25 will have this document that clearly indicates their 1 understanding that the way you keep people smoking 2 is the nicotine content. 3 and as dr. farone testified to you -- remember 4 dr. farone. he was at philip morris. he was one of 5 their internal scientists. and he told the truth 6 and said, "we all knew that cigarettes caused cancer 7 and we all knew that nicotine was addictive. and we 8 manipulated the content of cigarettes to make sure 9 that people continued to smoke because of their 10 addictiveness." 11 that fact is set out by a rather important 12 admission made in 1963 in a document that you will 13 have, marked strictly "private and confidential," 14 in which "there is a candid and clear admission, 15 moreover, nicotine is addictive. we are then in the 16 business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug." 17 that is the truth that they knew clearly by the 18 early '60s, if not before that. but they united. 19 finally in 1988 the surgeon general of the united 20 states, he issued a massive report -- one of those 21 documents you will have over there -- that goes 22 through all the evidence that nicotine is addictive, 23 that it is similar to cocaine, that it is similar to 24 heroin addiction, and they responded by denying it. 25 here's the evening news from the day that 1 surgeon general's report was issued. 2 (a video clip was played and transcribed by the 3 court reporter to the best of her ability as follows:) 4 announcer: "the smoking war escalated today. 5 a new report from the surgeon general of the united 6 states added a weapon for people who oppose smoking 7 and their representatives in congress. it also drew 8 fire from the tobacco industry. medical 9 correspondent susan spencer reports." 10 susan spencer: "surgeon general koop drew his 11 smoking gun on the tobacco industry today, declaring 12 what a lot of people who cannot kick the habit 13 already know: the nicotine in cigarettes is 14 addictive, very addictive." 15 surgeon general koop: "i would say it is just 16 as addictive as heroin or cocaine. our nation has 17 mobilized enormous resources to wage war on drugs, 18 illicit drugs. we should also give priority to the 19 one addiction, tobacco addiction, that is killing 20 more than 300,000 americans each year." 21 susan spencer: "anti-smoking groups said this 22 report puts their fight on a new footing." 23 unidentified speaker: "because a finding that 24 smoking is addictive knocks out the tobacco 25 industry's number-one argument, that is, that 1 smokers smoke because of their freewill." 2 susan spencer: "others said the official 3 finding that smokers are addicted may actually help 4 them quit." 5 unidentified speaker: "people should be 6 encouraged. now we know what the nature of the 7 beast is that is been controlling them. it is a 8 drug." 9 susan spencer: "as expected, the tobacco 10 institute called today's report unwarranted, saying 11 that since people do quit smoking, tobacco clearly 12 is not addictive. 13 "in response, the surgeon general noted that 14 some people also get off heroin. 15 "susan spencer, cbs news, washington." 16 (the video clip was ended.) 17 mr. shields: now, you saw the reference in 18 that report to the number of people that die each 19 year from tobacco, 300,000. recall that dr. burns 20 testified later than it was close to 440,000. why 21 is that? that is because in the year since 1988 more 22 people die each year from cigarette smoking, 23 primarily because of the number of women that 24 started smoking and the long lag between when 25 starting smoking and when cancer finally occurs to 1 return to the addictiveness. 2 they not only denied it following the surgeon 3 general's report saying it was an irresponsible 4 scare tactic -- and you will have that document -- a 5 few years later in 1994 they were compelled by 6 subpoena to appear before a congressional committee 7 and required, as you saw witnesses here, to take an 8 oath that they would tell the truth, the whole truth 9 and nothing but the truth under penalty of perjury. 10 and each of the presidents of the tobacco 11 companies, including the president of philip morris 12 and including the president of r.j. reynolds, stood 13 up under oath and said tobacco and nicotine was not 14 addictive, despite the fact that all of their 15 internal documents going back 30-some years showed 16 to the contrary, not only that they knew it but they 17 were internally researching how to make the 18 cigarettes more addictive by manipulating the 19 content of nicotine. 20 let us take a look at their testimony. 21 (a video clip was played and transcribed by the 22 court reporter to the best of her ability as follows:) 23 unidentified speaker: "let me begin my 24 questioning on the matter of whether or not nicotine 25 is addictive. let me ask you first -- and i'd like 1 to just go down the row -- whether each of you 2 believes that nicotine is not addictive. i heard 3 virtually all of you touch on it. and just yes or 4 no. 5 "do you believe nicotine is not addictive?" 6 unidentified speaker: "i believe nicotine is 7 not addictive, yes." 8 unidentified speaker: "mr. johnson?" 9 unidentified speaker: "congressman, cigarettes 10 and nicotine clearly do not meet the classic 11 definitions of addiction. there is no 12 intoxication" -- 13 unidentified speaker: "we will take that as a 14 no. and again, kind of short, if you can just -- i 15 think each of you believe nicotine is not addictive. 16 i just would like to have this for the record." 17 unidentified speaker: "i do not believe that 18 nicotine or our products are addictive." 19 unidentified speaker: "i believe nicotine is 20 not addictive." 21 unidentified speaker: "i believe that nicotine 22 is not addictive." 23 unidentified speaker: "i believe that nicotine 24 is not addictive." 25 unidentified speaker: "and i, too, believe 1 that nicotine is not addictive." 2 unidentified speaker: "all right." 3 (the video clip was ended.) 4 mr. shields: those denials were not just on 5 c-span, as mr. reilly told you in opening statement, 6 but the evening news covered that very testimony of 7 all the networks. 8 and the major story in all the newspapers the 9 following day was that the cigarette company 10 presidents denied that nicotine was addictive. 11 and they continued that denial until 2000, 12 following the first engle trial, when they finally 13 admitted on their website. 14 now, what is the contrary evidence to all that 15 i've been telling you, about their long campaign of 16 denial and deceit and misrepresentation and fraud 17 and concealment? was there any evidence they 18 presented you denying anything that dr. proctor said 19 or dr. burns said or dr. goldberg said? 20 the only evidence they offered was from 21 mr. jupe. despite all of their internal scientists 22 and corporate executives and people that had denied 23 over the years, did not bring a one of them to 24 testify. did not bring a one of them to say, "here's 25 why i said it and here's what i meant." 1 instead they brought somebody that did not even 2 come to work for them until 1995 and who claimed on 3 that witness stand that he had not read or seen any 4 of the documents, despite the fact that he is asked 5 deposition after deposition about them, including by 6 me less than two months ago when he also denied, as 7 he admitted on the stand, that he had read the 8 documents. 9 and he was shown the documents and required to 10 read them. and he comes into court two months later 11 and says, "oh, i've never read these." why do you 12 think it is that they put on a witness and they 13 never have him read all of the documents that are 14 relevant to what they did? because they cannot deny 15 it. there is no contrary evidence to this. the 16 evidence is not just compelling, it is the only 17 evidence at this trial. 18 now, compare that conduct to mrs. warrick. 19 like most smokers, she continued to believe, as she 20 testified, that cigarettes were not hazardous. she 21 testified, when asked the question directly, that 22 she did not know that cigarettes were harmful until 23 the '80s when all of those events, the death of her 24 sister, calvin's heart attack, the death of her 25 friend, to coalesce for them. she, like most 1 smokers at the time accepted their denials. 2 now, why do we know that most smokers did it? 3 because these companies researched their smokers and 4 tried to determine what they believed and did not 5 believe. and we showed you those documents in 6 dr. proctor's testimony and in dr. goldberg's 7 testimony. their own internal surveys indicated 8 that close to two-thirds of the smokers, their 9 customers, accepted their denials and rejected 10 that cigarettes caused cancer and were harmful. 11 dr. goldberg said, "even those that said it was 12 harmful compared it to getting out of a bathtub in 13 terms of the risk." 14 they knew they had provided a psychological 15 crutch that worked. 16 not only did dr. goldberg testify to that, but 17 one of the documents you will have is from the 18 federal trade commission. look at it closely. it 19 describes its survey research around the country of 20 smokers in trying to determine the effectiveness. 21 let us move to the federal trade commission. 22 video tech operator: which one? 23 mr. shields: the federal trade commission 24 document. 25 while she is finding it, what their survey 1 documents indicated is that -- here we go. here's 2 the federal trade commission report. 3 and what this federal trade commission report 4 indicated is that the commission believes that the 5 warning label on cigarette packages has not 6 succeeded in overcoming the prevalent attitude 7 toward cigarette smoking created and maintained by 8 the cigarette companies through their 9 advertisements, particularly the barrage of 10 commercials on television which portray smoking as a 11 harmless and enjoyable social activity that is not 12 habit-forming and involves no hazards to health. 13 that is what the united states government 14 concluded from its survey of smokers, and that is 15 what the compelling evidence shows here as well. 16 let us talk about causation now. you are going 17 to hear about causation, i expect, from the 18 defendants, as they try to say, "but anything we did 19 did not cause her to smoke." 20 the evidence is to the contrary. dr. goldberg 21 testified that she started smoking in the first 22 place, as she did, because of their marketing and 23 advertising, using celebrities and athletes, 24 creating the impression that everybody smoked, 25 creating the impression that it was glamorous. 1 mrs. warrick testified she started smoking because 2 of the glamour, because you went to the movies, you 3 saw everybody smoking, and everybody around her 4 smoked. 5 then she became addicted. and with addiction 6 comes the difficulty of trying to quit and the 7 willingness to accept the denials of the companies 8 as a reason not to quit. 9 and so dr. goldberg described for you their 10 massive advertising campaign in which they drowned 11 out any public health message. you may recall his 12 term for that, as a marketing professor, was "share 13 of voice." 14 and he had this fulcrum that he showed you 15 as to what was going on. you had the tobacco 16 industry's heavy, sophisticated advertising 17 promotion, and you had to compare that to what 18 public health warnings were available. 19 now, you saw yesterday various articles and 20 public health information that was put on for you, 21 but where was the witness to say, "this public 22 health message ran on the following stations for the 23 following time periods and with this frequency"? 24 where was the witness that told you, "this was on 25 all the time so somebody would have known it"? they 1 did not put on anybody. 2 dr. goldberg testified that what the federal 3 trade commission and what he had determined as well 4 was, first, that these warnings, under the fairness 5 doctrine, were only for a limited period of time in 6 the late '60s; secondly, in order to comply the 7 stations, in fact, played them but at 2:00 in the 8 morning, so that they technically complied, but how 9 many people were up to see those kind of warnings 10 and with what frequency? and then after the ban on 11 advertising on television, those health messages 12 virtually disappeared. 13 that is the undisputed testimony. no testimony 14 from the defendants at all about what any of that 15 material meant or how often it was played. 16 they also showed you some documents, some 17 newspapers in life magazine and so forth, as if that 18 would indicate to mrs. warrick that she knew 19 something or should have known something. what they 20 did not tell you was that in each of those articles 21 the tobacco industry denies what the article claims. 22 what they did not tell you is that that life magazine 23 was full of ads. 24 as dr. goldberg said, the ads just dominated. 25 and surveys have shown that for those magazines that 1 took tobacco advertising, they seldom put out any 2 anti-tobacco or public health message. 3 the fact is, marketing works. the fact is, 4 their advertisement works. i know we all say, "oh, 5 i'm not impacted by advertising. i'm not impacted 6 by marketing. i did not go out and buy tide because 7 there is all that advertising on television." but 8 that survey evidence indicates to the contrary. 9 ask yourself this question. do you think the 10 tobacco companies, as sophisticated in marketing and 11 advertising as they were, would spend the vast 12 amount of money that they did on their heavy, 13 sophisticated advertising program if it did not work? 14 they knew it worked. they tested it. they 15 surveyed eight people. it worked. it convinced 16 their customers to continue smoking their product. 17 and a few public service announcements and articles 18 in the paper did not change that. 19 so the simple and compelling logic here is as 20 follows: she started smoking as a child because 21 they focused their advertising on children to get 22 them to smoke. she became addicted. and then once 23 she became addicted, she needed a psychological 24 crutch to continue to smoke, and they knew it. and 25 so with their heavy, sophisticated campaign of 4552 1 denial and deceit, they continued to persuade her to 2 continue smoking over the years. 3 now, they may say, "well, she could not recall a 4 specific thing we said or a specific document." 5 that misses the point. nobody 50 years later can 6 say, "oh, i remember the frank statement," or 50 7 years later, "i remember this specific ad," although 8 she did testify in some detail about what she 9 remembered about a lot of ads. 10 the fact is, it is all of that together that 11 creates this image of what you believe. that is what 12 they created. they created a whole culture around 13 her of smoking that took her decades to break 14 through and recognize the harm and then attempt to 15 quit. 16 there is a related causation issue that i want 17 to talk about next. and that is, did cigarette 18 smoking cause her death by causing her death through 19 lung cancer and copd? 20 all of their evidence in this case literally 21 dealt with that issue. they put on dr. bishopric. 22 they put on dr. shuman. they talked at length about 23 whether or not, in fact, she died of cigarette 24 smoking as opposed to heart disease. 25 that is a false issue. it is a false issue 1 because whether she died as a result of copd or lung 2 cancer, she is still entitled to recover. the estate 3 is still entitled to recover. that does not provide 4 a defense to this claim. it just determines what 5 kind of recovery she gets, whether it is what is 6 called a "wrongful death claim" or whether it is a 7 survival claim. 8 now, the undisputed facts are she was diagnosed 9 with copd in 1991, that dr. bagnoli started treating 10 her for copd and treated her for the rest of his 11 life -- her life, that she grew progressively worse, 12 being disabled in 1994 from working, going on oxygen 13 full-time, requiring a walker, ultimately requiring 14 a wheelchair, that she was diagnosed with lung 15 cancer, the worst kind you could have, stage iv, 16 that she went through debilitating, toxic 17 chemotherapy, that she went through radiation, that 18 she spent 17 days in the hospital just before her 19 death, severely anemic, immunocompromised, with 20 pneumonia, frail, older than her stated age and 21 wasting, and that she died within four days of when 22 she got out of the hospital. 23 and her treating physicians, dr. bagnoli, 24 dr. nurani said it is because she had lung cancer and 25 copd. 1 but instead of calling her treating physicians 2 or her local heart doctors or anyone else, they 3 brought in two doctors from miami to say, "oh, no, 4 it is heart disease." 5 now, those doctors had to admit that copd, in 6 fact, can cause the very condition that they were 7 talking about. they had to admit that chemotherapy 8 can cause the very condition that they are talking 9 about. they had to admit that smoking-induced 10 coronary artery disease can cause the very condition 11 they are talking about. they had to admit that, in 12 fact, as dr. shuman said, they may well have been 13 contributing causes to her death. 14 and that is the standard, whether they were 15 substantial contributing causes. they did not have 16 to be the only cause. her heart disease could have 17 been related to other things as well, as long as 18 there was substantial contributing causes. 19 but i'm not here to tell you, believe the local 20 doctors and reject their experts, because it does not 21 make any difference. the fact is, we are entitled to 22 recover either way. i'm not going to spend a lot of 23 time talking about their experts. you are going to 24 have to decide, do i believe dr. bagnoli? do i 25 believe dr. nurani? do i believe the local 1 physician that did the autopsy that said it had 2 nothing to do with her heart condition, or do i 3 believe a thousand-dollar-an-hour doctor from miami 4 that they brought in? 5 but if you believe, in fact, she died from 6 unrelated heart disease, all right. it does not mean 7 we do not have a claim; it just means we have a 8 different claim. 9 and as we are now going to turn to damage and 10 talk about it and we will see, the irony is that the 11 survival claim, as opposed to the wrongful death 12 claim, probably has more economic value. 13 so let us talk about damages. the first kind of 14 damages we are going to talk about are what are 15 called compensatory damages, that is the damages for 16 her actual injuries, whether you call it wrongful 17 death or whether it is a survival claim. 18 and so you need to understand the difference 19 between a wrongful death and survival claim. and 20 one of the questions you are going to have to answer 21 very early is was her death on february 7th caused 22 by either or one of a combination of her 23 smoking-related illnesses? that is, "did copd or 24 lung cancer cause or substantially contribute to 25 causing her death?" 1 if you answer yes to that question, it is what is 2 called a "wrongful death claim." and a wrongful 3 death claim has certain damages that the law of 4 florida provides. 5 it provides that you can recover for medical 6 bills, funeral expenses, calvin warrick, her 7 husband's, loss of support and services, calvin 8 warrick's loss of companionship, mental pain and 9 suffering. those are the damages provided by 10 florida law for wrongful death. 11 but if you determine that, in fact, she did not 12 die from her copd or lung cancer, it does not mean 13 she did not suffer. she had 19 years of suffering 14 from copd. she had extreme suffering during the 15 last year of her life from lung cancer. all it 16 means is the "no" answer to the question is that 17 it is what is called a "survival action." 18 what does that mean? all that means is the 19 claim that she would have had, had she still been 20 alive today, survives her death so that her estate 21 can assert it. 22 and the claim that survives her death that she 23 would have had, if she were still alive today, is 24 that she could recover for her medical bills, she 25 could recover for her pain and suffering, she could 1 recover for her mental anguish, she could recover 2 for her loss of enjoyment of life, for her 3 inconvenience, physical impairment, and aggravation 4 of her preexisting condition. 5 those are all parts of the damage that can be 6 recovered in a survival claim. 7 basically, the difference is, wrongful death 8 damages, you both recover medical expenses and -- on 9 both, but for death, of course, you have funeral 10 expenses. and the emphasis on the wrongful death 11 claim is on the damage to mr. warrick, whereas a 12 survival claim is the damage to her that she had for 13 the 19 years prior to her death. 14 and that is why i told you that in many respects 15 that survival claim may well have more value, be 16 worth more in damages for the wrongful death claim. 17 that is why i'm not going to spend a lot of time 18 disputing with them about whether it is a wrongful 19 death or a survival claim. 20 now, what do we know about the damages? first, 21 the medical bills. it is agreed that the medical 22 bills are $683,682.27. there is no evidence to the 23 contrary. in fact, there is an agreement that that is 24 the amount. and we are going to ask you, whether 25 it is wrongful death or whether it is survival, to 1 award that amount of money as a starting point. 2 secondly, it is undisputed that the funeral 3 expenses were $2,692.49. no dispute. we are going 4 to ask you, if there is a wrongful death claim, to 5 award that amount of money. 6 next, on the wrongful death claim, as i told 7 you, the emphasis on it is calvin, whereas the 8 survival claim emphasis is on mrs. warrick. 9 the unrefuted testimony is that one of the 10 elements of the loss of the value of services and 11 support is $234,000. you remember mr. spruance that 12 testified towards the end of our case, the life care 13 planner, rehabilitation guy who determined what the 14 value was? the only evidence you have is his 15 testimony as to the value of those loss of services, 16 and that is $234,000. so that we are going to ask you 17 if you find wrongful death claim to award that as 18 well. 19 let us go to the next one. 20 in addition, if you are going to award the 21 wrongful death claim, you have to determine the 22 entitlement for full reimbursement for calvin 23 warrick's loss of companionship, mental pain and 24 suffering from july 1991 until today. 25 why july 1991? well, it could probably be 1 argued to be earlier than that, but that is the time 2 period when the copd was first diagnosed. and so he 3 suffered some loss of companionship during that 4 entire time period because of her disabilities, 5 because of her problems. and so we are going to ask 6 you to award damages, under the wrongful death 7 claim, for that 19-year period of time. 8 now, let me say this -- and this is going to 9 apply to the survival claim as well -- the law 10 does not provide a precise formula about how you 11 award damages for such items like loss of 12 companionship and pain and suffering. those are 13 left to your enlightened conscience as jurors. 14 that is what you are here to determine, among other 15 things. 16 now, there are various ways to do it. and i 17 can suggest ways to do it. i doubt the defendants 18 will suggest ways to do it, but they could. but 19 it is going to ultimately be up to you. 20 one way to do it, which makes a lot of sense, 21 is to think about the time period. think about the 22 fact that it is 19 years. during those 19 years 23 every hour, every day, every month, every year these 24 damages occur, whether they are wrongful death 25 damages for calvin or her pain and suffering in the 1 survival claim. 2 now, we are used to thinking about being paid by 3 the hour. we are used to thinking about compensation 4 based upon time. one logical way that you can go 5 about determining these kind of damages is to think 6 about the total number of hours, total number of 7 days, the months and years during that 19-year 8 period, and to think in your mind, how many hours a 9 day, and apply an hourly figure, as you would if you 10 were being paid by the hour at your job, and apply 11 it over that 19-year period of time. 12 and that works both not only on calvin's loss 13 of companionship, mental pain and suffering, but it 14 works, if you are talking about the survival claim, 15 on her pain and suffering, impairment and the losses 16 that she would have had during that time period. so 17 that when you answer no, if you answer no, and 18 you are over here for her pain and suffering, her 19 mental anguish, her loss of enjoyment, her 20 inconvenience, her physical impairment and her 21 aggravation, think in terms of each of those occur 22 every hour, every day, every month, every year over 23 that 19-year period. 24 now, clearly, the pain and suffering is worse 25 during the last year when she is on chemotherapy and 1 radiation and she is hospitalized and anemic and has 2 pneumonia and respiratory distress, so severely 3 immunocompromised. so it may make sense in terms of 4 figuring out time periods and how much to apply for 5 an hourly basis to think about much larger amounts 6 during that time period. 7 but even if you go back -- and she is totally 8 disabled by 1994. she is on oxygen by 1997. she is 9 on a walker, in a wheelchair, unable to do things, 10 in constant pain and suffering. so it is not just 11 the last year of her life. you are going to have to 12 figure that out. 13 and we suggest to you the most logical way of 14 dealing with these damages is to approach it from 15 that standpoint, to make that very simple 16 calculation and figure out how much you, in your 17 collective wisdom, think it will be appropriate to 18 reimburse the estate for those losses, whether it is 19 wrongful death in calvin's claim or the claim that 20 would survive her death as if she were still here. 21 now, there is a second damage issue you are 22 going to have to address. we have talked a lot both 23 about the original engle findings and if you find 24 she was a member of the class that she gets the 25 benefit of those. among those findings are civil 1 conspiracy and fraud by concealment. but we offered 2 you massive evidence of that as well of all of their 3 fraudulent concealments and their misrepresentations 4 and their misstatements of everything. that is what 5 is justification for punitive damages. 6 the court's going to instruct you on the 7 florida law of punitive damages and the standard 8 that you, as a jury, have to apply in order to award 9 punitive damages. 10 punitive damages are damages in addition to the 11 compensatory damages that are designed to deter and 12 punish the wrongdoer for their conduct. 13 ladies and gentlemen, if there was ever a case 14 that justifies the award of punitive damages, it is 15 this case. if there is ever any wrongful conduct 16 that justifies deterrence and punishment, it is what 17 they did over that 45- to 50-year period of time, 18 that massive civil conspiracy designed to keep their 19 smokers addicted, knowing, ultimately, that they 20 would kill 440,000 people a year, or more, and 21 knowing that as long as they provided their denials 22 and the psychological crutch, they could keep those 23 people smoking and keep making all of the profits 24 that they were making. 25 you are going to have to ask yourself one 1 question and answer it on this verdict form. is the 2 estate of eveline warrick entitled to punitive 3 damages? it is a simple question you are going to 4 have to answer. the evidence is overwhelming, under 5 the standard of florida law, that there is 6 entitlement to punitive damages. 7 if ever there was a case, this is the case in 8 which there is entitlement for punitive damages in 9 which you ought to be thinking about deterrence and 10 punishment. 11 one final subject, and then i'm going to sit 12 down. 13 they have asserted a defense. it is called a 14 "statute of limitations." and that is going to be 15 one of the questions early in the case that you are 16 going to have to face. you are going to have to 17 answer this question on the verdict form. and it is 18 this question: "did eveline warrick know, or by the 19 use of reasonable care, should she have known before 20 may 5, 1990, that she had chronic obstructive 21 pulmonary disease and that there was a reasonable 22 possibility that it was caused by the defendants' 23 actions?" 24 what is all that about? that is what is called a 25 "statute of limitations." a statute of limitations 1 is a time period in which a lawsuit must be filed. 2 and if it is not filed within that time period, the 3 claim is barred. you cannot bring it. 4 now, that date, may 5, 1990, is based upon the 5 engle class action. it is four years before the 6 engle class action was filed, because there is a 7 four-year statute of limitations for these kinds of 8 claims. 9 so not only do you need to determine whether 10 she was a member of the engle class, but also 11 whether -- as a member of the engle class, whether 12 there is a statute of limitations defense, which is 13 this question. 14 now, since it is a defense, they have the burden 15 of proof, not us. they have to prove to you by the 16 greater weight of the evidence that she knew or 17 should have known before may 5, 1990, that she had 18 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 19 if they do not meet that burden of proof, that 20 is, if it is equally divided, if you cannot decide for 21 sure, that defense is gone, since they have got the 22 burden of proof, and you would answer this question 23 no. 24 now, what is the evidence on this question? the 25 evidence is from dr. bagnoli. he said, "i diagnosed 1 her a year later -- so that there would not be any 2 statute of limitations defense -- "in 1991 that she 3 had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease." and he 4 testified she did not know until then that she had 5 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. that is not 6 unusual. 7 dr. burns told you in his videotape that 8 because of the function of the lung -- remember that 9 chart he had of lung function and how it dropped 10 over the years -- that it took a pretty extreme drop 11 in lung function before you had symptoms and knew 12 you would have some problem. 13 in fact, the evidence here is, the way eveline 14 warrick ended up in dr. bagnoli's office was not 15 that she thought she had some lung problem; she was 16 hospitalized for what she thought was a reaction to 17 a red bug bite. and it was as a result of that 18 hospitalization that she got sent to dr. bagnoli. 19 he did the tests and said, "you have got chronic 20 obstructive pulmonary disease." and he told you 21 that, in his judgment, she clearly did not know 22 before then. 23 so the question becomes should she have known? 24 should she somehow have known before a doctor ever 25 diagnosed her, before a doctor ever told her, that 1 she had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? 2 now, the defense is going to argue she should 3 have known because she had a cough earlier. a cough 4 is not chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. a 5 cough does not indicate, "gee, i've got this lung 6 condition that is a serious, chronic disease." 7 the testimony is until there is this test, even 8 a doctor does not know for sure whether or not you 9 have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. there 10 simply is no support for the claim that she should 11 have known before that diagnosis. 12 remember that testimony i showed you at the 13 beginning, where she said in response to specific 14 questions, "i did not have any breathing problems; i 15 did not have any asthma; i did not have any problems 16 that led me to think there was any difficulty until 17 1991" when dr. bagnoli diagnosed her condition. 18 so the answer to this question, one of the 19 first three questions you have to ask [sic], has to 20 be no. 21 you got three questions that you got to answer 22 initially: one, was she addicted to cigarettes 23 containing nicotine? the answer is yes, from the 24 compelling evidence. that is the first part of 25 proving she is a member of the engle class. 1 the second question you have to answer is 2 whether that addiction was a cause of her chronic 3 obstructive pulmonary disease. the answer to that 4 is yes. 5 and the third important question is whether or 6 not this statute of limitations applies, and the 7 answer is no. 8 those are the first three questions you have to 9 answer, and then you will move beyond that to whether 10 she had a wrongful death claim or whether it was a 11 survival claim. 12 and, believe it or not, i'm going to sit down 13 at this point in time and let the defendants have 14 their say. i'll be back to talk to you in more 15 detail after they have given you their argument and 16 tell you what responses i have to their argument. 17 i thank you again, not only for your attention 18 in the close to last two hours, but your attention 19 throughout this trial. it is a pleasure to be in 20 front of a jury that is engaged and interested and 21 attentive to everything that is going on. 22 thank you so much.
