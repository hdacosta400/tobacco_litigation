                    CLOSING STATEMENT
              MR. PAIGE:  Good morning.  So as
        Mr. Kaczynski actually said in jury selection,
        it's been a long time, right?  It doesn't seem
        like that long.  Three weeks ago today, I think,
        when y'all started and it seems like yesterday.
        So I guess they say, time flies when you're having
        fun.  Hopefully, I do think that y'all learned a
        lot during this trial that probably you didn't
        know coming in, and I know that because we all saw
        and appreciated the amount of notes that y'all
        took.
              And so as you'll remember three weeks ago,
        there was 250 of y'all that were brought in, and
        we talked to every one of you.  And I know
        Mr. Kaczynski -- we remember where each one of you
        was sitting, who was sitting on the left side of
        the room, who was sitting on the front row, who
        raised their hand to the first question, and we
        all agreed, we all, both sides, wanted y'all to be
09:37:05
09:37:15
09:37:29
09:37:43
09:37:56 4765 our jurors in this case.  And we appreciate your
        time and your consideration, and we know that
        y'all paid attention.  We know y'all have your own
        families and friends and lives, and you're here
        listening.  We appreciate it.
              On behalf -- David is not here right now,
        David Sales, who tried the case with me.  He will
        be here.  He had somewhere where he had to be this
        morning.  The Court knows about it.  He'll be here
        around lunchtime.  He wants to be here.  Ina is
        not here yet.  She's coming.  Y'all have seen her
        during the trial, and it takes her a while to get
        to where she needs to be.  So usually she gets
        here around ten, and she will be here.  But she
        appreciates your time and consideration and
        sacrifice that y'all have made.
              And Bryan is here.  And I wanted to explain
        to you, I don't know if I explained it at the
        beginning, he could not be here at trial because
        there are rules of the court, and one of the rules
        is called the rule of sequestration, and if you're
        not the party, you're not allowed to be in the
        courtroom.
              So the party is only the -- even though he
        has a claim, he's not the personal representative.
09:38:12
09:38:23
09:38:36
09:38:49
09:38:58 4766 So when you bring a case, a wrongful death case,
        it has to be brought by the personal
        representative.  That was Ina.  She's the only one
        permitted to be here.  But Bryan is here today,
        and he appreciates your time as well.
              And Robert, I told you during the beginning
        I couldn't work without him.  He's my friend and
        my neighbor, but I am probably would not be able
        to do a case without him being here, and Adam
        helped me as well.  And the Defense, I want don't
        want to say we fight, but we have issues during
        the lawsuit, but I respect them immensely,
        Mr. Kaczynski and his team and Ms. Arnold.
              And hopefully, even though David is not
        right here now, hopefully there will be no
        sidebars, because if there is, I'll be in trouble.
        So I'm going to try not to say anything that they
        will bring me up there.
              Today, as you all know, it's an important
        day and --
              (Ms. Ahrens entered into the courtroom.)
              MR. PAIGE:  It's an important to both
        parties.  It's a big issue.  You-all have heard
        about it.  You've been here.  You know how much it
09:39:11
09:39:19
09:39:35
09:39:48
09:40:02 4767 means to both parties.
              And you-all have -- you know, we do this
        for a living, but you guys are here now, and this
        is your opportunity.  You have the -- you know,
        the power and the ability to say what you think is
        right and what's wrong, what's acceptable, what's
        not acceptable in our society, what's good and
        what's bad.
              And, you know, coming in here, I know from
        doing these cases -- I'd be naive to say that I
        don't know that people have preconceived notions
        about smokers.  I know that.
              And -- but, as we said at the beginning --
        and we know that cigarettes are a legal product.
        That's not a secret.  We know that.  But the issue
        is -- it really is, how did we get here to this
        point in life in society where this is okay that
        500,000 Americans, 90 percent of them starting as
        teenagers, are going to die from the
        smoking-related illness while their clients profit
        and lied about it and concealed things.
              So how did we get here?
              Because we know in 1900s there were 140
        deaths in the world from lung cancer.  That's a
        true fact.  A hundred years ago in history is not
09:40:15
09:40:26
09:40:41
09:41:00
09:41:14 4768 that long ago, and you-all see the line that's
        going down now because the truth is out, people
        are being educated.  They are now -- they are now
        being regulations, and it's a legal product, but
        the line for consumption and death is going down
        in society.
              And a hundred years from now, you have to
        wonder -- because a hundred years back, you know,
        it wasn't happening, and a hundred years from now
        people may think, how did this happen, what
        happened here, how did it happen where there was a
        society where 30 million people, 30 million
        Americans -- and, again, you know, there were
        issues where Karl Ahrens -- I'm going to talk
        about it -- everything that came up in this trial,
        I'm not shy.  I'm willing to talk about every
        issue, and I want to talk about every issue.
              And Karl Ahrens whether he first started
        experimenting or whether he became a regular
        smoker in the Navy, which seems like that's when
        it is, because we don't know for sure, but that's
        when he probably became a regular smoker.
              But we know that by the age of 24 is where
        the frontal lobes of the brain really fully form.
        So, you know, that's a business model.  That's
09:41:29
09:41:42
09:41:57
09:42:08
09:42:21 4769 been their business model.  That's how they made
        money.
              And so at the beginning of the trial, I
        said to you at one point in opening -- I usually
        say it in closing -- but there is a song -- and a
        friend of mine told me -- and I have a friend who
        does the same type of work I do -- and it's by
        Elton John and called Mona Lisa something.  He
        says, "I thought I knew, but now I know that roses
        never grow in New York City."
              But when you came in here, did you really
        know that there's arsenic, cyanide in every puff
        of cigarettes going into a smoker's lungs; that
        nicotine is a drug as addictive as cocaine and
        heroin; that it goes through the brain in seven
        seconds with each dose of nicotine.
              And even Dr. Dorce admitted when people are
        20, 30 years old, and they are smoking, it's --
        it's -- natural, it's natural for somebody to
        think, "Hey, when I get older, I'd quit.  When I
        get older, I'll quit."
              And then when they are 40, 50 years old and
        they have a hard time quitting, one or two things
        are going to happen.  Either, A, they will quit,
        and they will be fine, hopefully, thank God; or,
09:42:37
09:42:50
09:43:02
09:43:18
09:43:31 4770 B, they won't quit or they might quit, and they
        won't be okay, because we know statistically
        60 percent of them will die a horrible death, a
        smoking-related death, that are not fine, lung
        cancer, emphysema, throat cancer, heart disease,
        stroke, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, stomach
        cancer.  Those are diseases that people get.
              So that's their legal product.  Again, it's
        a legal product.  Nobody is going to jail here,
        but this is a civil lawsuit in a civil society
        where people from the community judge whether or
        not corporations should be able to do what they
        did and cause harm to the amount of people that
        they did while they made a ton of money.
              And you have to decide if you think that's
        right or that's wrong and whether what they did
        was bad.  Okay?
              What they did when they lied, when they all
        went to the little rooms, their executives and
        scientists, they had their papers, and they had
        all their knowledge.  And they knew exactly what
        was going to happen, there was no doubt -- you
        know, "Doubt is Our Product", "Doubt is Our
        Product," but they had no doubt when they were in
        their little rooms making all their money what was
09:43:46
09:44:03
09:44:19
09:44:31
09:44:42 4771 going to happen to regular people.
              So, you know, that's why we're here.  And
        so you will decide, I guess -- you will decide if
        it's okay because they want to blame 100 percent
        of fault on Karl Ahrens.  And you will decide if
        that's okay, that a corporation can do what they
        did and blame all their victims, all their victims
        100 percent.
              And we do accept partial responsibility
        because I know.  I know from when I very first did
        this, when I very first started doing this type of
        work and they said to Dr. Proctor, you worked for
        Mr. Paige 15 times over the past, what has it
        been, eight years, and it's not easy to get a case
        to trial.  It takes time.  You see the type of
        work that came into this.
              And so I know -- and even though Ina -- Ina
        loves her husband, loves her husband, loves her
        husband, she does not think he did anything wrong,
        and that's natural.  But I know, in your minds
        that everybody must think, hey, the smoker has to
        bear some responsibility.  If somebody tries to
        quit 10 times, they could try 11 times.  If they
        try 20, they can try 21.  I know that.
              I know y'all believe that, and I know most
09:44:59
09:45:10
09:45:26
09:45:37
09:45:50 4772 people probably do believe that.  And that's why
        we do accept partial responsibility.  But
        likewise, is it okay to have a defective product,
        a defective product where the filters don't work,
        where the lights don't work, where it's highly
        addictive, and added chemicals.  And they say,
        hey, we're not going to bear any responsibility,
        and they don't have to.  It's my burden of proof,
        and I think we brought you overwhelming proof.
              So the first slide I want to show you is --
        you know, we brought you top experts and they --
        I -- I don't want to say they criticize -- they
        talked to Dr. Proctor respectfully about the money
        he's made over the past 20 years doing this type
        of work.  You guys know he's the top guy in the
        world, if not in the country, in the world on this
        topic.  Okay.
              So if I have to hire Dr. Proctor to come
        here and teach you the truth, that's what I have
        to do.  Hey, look, I don't -- I wish I didn't have
        to pay him any money.  But the truth is you got
        people -- you know, he's -- in any field if
        somebody is the top person in their field in the
        world, they are going to be compensated.
              And so if I hired somebody like Dr. Pach,
09:46:05
09:46:20
09:46:37
09:46:49
09:47:02 4773 Pach, whatever his name, and brought him to you
        and said, let him explain the conspiracy to you, I
        probably would not be able to meet my burden of
        proof.
              So we brought you -- and I'm not
        apologizing.  I'm proud that we brought you some
        of the top experts in the world, Dr. Proctor,
        Dr. Hurt from the Mayo Clinic.  He started the --
        I think it was the first inpatient treatment
        facility for nicotine addicts in the country.
        That was Dr. Hurt.
              Dr. Ruckdeschel, I was fortunate when I
        went through the medical records, and we do that,
        we look at who is the treating doctor, who treated
        my client.  And I find out that he's the CEO of
        Moffitt Cancer Center.  He's published all over
        the world on this topic.
              So these are the -- excuse me.
              These are the people that we brought you,
        and so what you do know now and what you didn't
        know, or you may have known, but this is from the
        FTC report.  And you guys have learned that
        cigarette smoking is the greatest single public
        health problem the Nation has ever faced.
              That's not me saying it.  That's the
09:47:13
09:47:26
09:47:37
09:47:55
09:48:13 4774 evidence in this case.  That's the truth.  That's
        the truth.
              So people who know people -- you know,
        sometimes you work with people and you say, why is
        this guy running outside in the rain and goes
        smoking by himself, why is this poor guy walking
        downstairs and sitting there and -- all by himself
        with smokers, what are -- why are they doing it?
        Because nicotine is a drug.  It's a drug
        addiction.
              And the Surgeon General -- it wasn't until
        1988 that the Surgeon General issued a report
        where they established and they -- you know,
        revealed to the public that it was a drug
        addiction.  And there's no -- you know, it's
        not -- and, again, a fair question is, is this a
        habit, do people do this out of habit, or is this
        a drug addiction?
              And it is a drug addiction.  The facts of
        the case are every smoker of every cigarette is
        getting 1 to 2 milligrams to his brain with each
        cigarette, ten inhalations with each cigarette
        that go seven seconds to the brain, and the
        nicotinic receptors grow, and when they are active
        they need more drug.  And that's how drug
09:48:22
09:48:38
09:48:50
09:49:04
09:49:18 4775 addiction works, whether it's cocaine, heroin,
        alcohol, drug addiction.
              You say, hey, people know -- people know
        it's going to be bad for them.  People who love
        their families, they love their families, they
        want to live as long as they can, they want to see
        their -- they want to see their kids' weddings,
        they want to meet their grandchildren.  Nobody
        wants to die early.
              So what is it that's making these people do
        what they are doing?
              People may think that they do it because
        they like it, they like it.  But what is there to
        like?  What is there to like?  It calms you.  It
        makes you feel good because when you don't have it
        you don't feel good.
              If somebody says, hey, I'm not going to
        smoke today, they are going to have a hard time
        not smoking that day.  And they will feel better
        when they smoke.  And then they will think, hey,
        when I get older, hopefully I'll quit.  And
        hopefully God willing they will, but it is a drug
        addiction like any other drug addiction.
              And that is why a lot of people -- you
        know, when they don't know what you-all know now,
09:49:29
09:49:40
09:49:53
09:50:02
09:50:15 4776 they may blame their family and say, hey, you
        know, my family member had a choice.  It was my
        family member's decision.
              But when you look at their own documents --
        see, that's the thing, they let America believe
        it's a choice.  They tell America it's a choice.
        Hey, it's a free choice.  It's a victim's choice.
        It's a victim's choice.
              In their internal documents they say the
        complete opposite.  When they go into their rooms
        and they tell their little secrets, their dirty
        little secrets, they say this is not a choice.
        They know where -- nowhere in their documents do
        they say it is a free choice, let the people
        choose.  You won't find a document like that,
        because if there was one, they would have showed
        it to you, I assure you.  It does not exist.
              The other thing that we now know, and I
        alluded to it, though, is that 90 percent start as
        teenagers, whether it's 13, 18, 19 -- I think it's
        99 percent start by the age of 24.
              And you know why that is, it's because the
        frontal lobes on a teenager are not fully formed.
        Most people when they are age 35, 40 years old do
        not begin to smoke.  You know, you're not going to
09:50:26
09:50:37
09:50:50
09:51:09
09:51:26 4777 say, hey, I'm going to start smoking now, because
        those are the parts of the brain that deal with
        rational decisions, dealing with consequences,
        thinking about the future, and so that's why
        that's where they target, that's where they direct
        their money to, that's where they put all their
        resources.
              And so while they are lying and while they
        were watching Americans lie -- I'll show the next
        screen -- they knew that people just like Karl
        Ahrens -- 500,000 Americans every year would end
        up dying, people with families, fathers, mothers,
        you know, brothers, sisters, daughters, whatever
        and that did not matter to them.
              So today you get to hold them accountable,
        and we'll ask you -- we'll go through -- there are
        important issues, one is class membership, one
        is -- which I'll talk about.  The other is
        apportionment of fault, and then we'll talk about
        the fraud and the punitive damages.
              So the first issue I do want to talk to you
        about is class membership.  And as you-all know
        from the trial, this case started out -- stemmed
        out of another case.  There was a class action
        filed in 1994, and it was for Florida residents
09:51:38
09:51:50
09:52:05
09:52:18
09:52:36 4778 from a different time, a different era -- oh, not
        like -- that's why we talk about present day --
        people born in the '30s, '40s, and '50s who ended
        up getting a smoking-related disease in the '90s.
              And that was -- this case was a short case,
        as long as it seemed, the real case lasted about a
        year and there was a lot of evidence.  And there
        were findings in that case where that jury just
        like you made certain findings based on the
        evidence that they had.  And it went all the way
        to the Florida Supreme Court, and it is the law of
        the State of Florida that what they did cannot be
        denied.  There is denial that they entered into a
        conspiracy, that they concealed important
        information.  That's a fact.  That's a fact as if
        you found the issues yourself.
              But for that to apply, we have to prove to
        you, it's our burden of proof that Karl Ahrens was
        a class member.  And so this issue, if you look at
        it, was he addicted to cigarettes containing
        nicotine; and, if so, was that a legal cause of
        his cancer and death.
              It seems simple.  And it's important.  It's
        very important.  And we know now -- and, again,
        it's my burden of proof, but obviously their
09:52:51
09:53:04
09:53:16
09:53:34
09:53:47 4779 Defense is that he's not a class member.  And I
        submit to you that through his life, they had in
        their class of smokers that they always wanted him
        to be a member of, they always wanted him to be a
        member of their class until he got sick and died.
              And this is -- what I'm showing you is even
        if he started smoking at 18, their goal is -- and
        it's in their own documents that they want to get
        in the minds of kids when they are young.  That's
        their whole -- their whole business plan, get in
        the minds of children when they are children, and
        when they get older in their teens, they will
        experiment and then we can get them hooked and get
        them addicted.  Then they will be tomorrow's
        business for the next 25 years.  These are the
        business plans.  These are the documents that
        you're not supposed to see that you're seeing.
              This is Philip Morris when they talk about
        children being very impressionable, remembering
        things they hear and see long after they've
        occurred.  That's why they are giving candy to
        kids.  They don't want a 6-year-old, a 7-year-old,
        an 8-year-old to start smoking, this is not what
        they are doing, but they are trying to create a
        favorable impression in the mind of children,
09:53:59
09:54:12
09:54:25
09:54:37
09:54:48 4780 knowing that they become -- look, it looks cool,
        it looks glamorous.
              And then they are saying -- in 1960, they
        were saying 14- to 24-year-olds will represent --
        and Karl at that time was 21 -- will be our -- our
        business, tomorrow's business for the next 25
        years.  And that was Karl.
              So in their internal documents, that's what
        they wanted.  They wanted him to -- to become
        addicted to their product.  They wanted him to be
        a long-term smoker.  They wanted him to belong to
        this class of all the other people who we now know
        all died, or were really injured from the product.
              So the class membership, this is what -- we
        talked about this a little bit in opening.  Class
        membership, when you heard -- the Judge just
        instructed you on the law, and you heard it.
        There's nothing about whether smokers have
        choices.  That's not going to be an issue as to
        whether or not you can include or exclude somebody
        from the class.
              When you include somebody in the class,
        it's just that issue that I read to you, and I
        will tell you the instruction in a second.
              Choices that people may have.  You know,
09:55:00
09:55:13
09:55:32
09:55:44
09:55:53 4781 people can choose to try to quit.  People make
        choices to try to quit.  Just because you choose
        to try to quit doesn't always mean you're going to
        be successful.  That issue goes to comparative
        fault, which is another issue.  Ability to quit,
        every addict has the ability to quit.  If that was
        the issue for class membership, nobody would ever
        be a class member because any addict, whether
        you're a nicotine addict, an alcoholic, a heroin
        addict, addicts can quit.
              Knowledge of the dangers, that's an issue
        that goes to the conspiracy, concealment, the
        reliance claims and those fraud claims.  And brand
        usage, whether he smoked one brand or the other,
        that's an issue for a different thing.  But class
        membership, it's not about those issues.
              So I have to spend a little bit of time on
        class membership because it's such an important
        issue here.
              So this is the instruction that the judge
        has told you-all about, addiction to cigarettes
        containing nicotine was a legal cause of lung
        cancer in Mr. Ahrens if it directly and in natural
        and continuous sequence produced or contributed
        substantially to producing such lung cancer so
09:56:08
09:56:20
09:56:32
09:56:47
09:57:02 4782 that it can be said that but for the addiction to
        cigarettes, the lung cancer would not have
        occurred.
              So you have to ask yourself when you weigh
        the evidence, did the nicotine -- did the
        addiction to nicotine -- was he addicted to
        nicotine or did he smoke for reasons.  And if he
        was addicted to nicotine, was that the reason he
        smoked.  But for his addiction, would he have
        smoked that many cigarettes for that many years
        and still develop lung cancer?
              I submit to you the evidence is
        overwhelming that nobody does that, and they know
        that.  They know that nobody does that.
              And again, the addiction, this is
        important, too, because it doesn't have to be the
        only cause.  It's not about class membership.
        That's why I asked you guys, respectfully, to keep
        your eye on the ball.  If you follow the law, I
        submit to you Mr. Ahrens was a member of the class
        clearly, because even if you believe that he had
        choices at some point where he could have quit or
        could have tried harder or should have quit, which
        we don't deny, that doesn't exclude somebody from
        being a class member because addiction -- and this
09:57:16
09:57:32
09:57:40
09:57:57
09:58:10 4783 was the law, the law that you-all obviously -- you
        know, we know that you will follow, it says
        addiction need not be the only cause and it can
        occur at the same time -- other things can occur
        at the same time, as long as the addiction
        contributes substantially to producing the death
        or the illness of the person, and then you are a
        class member.
              And so we have to prove our evidence by the
        greater weight of the evidence, and in this case
        on the addiction issue, we brought you -- there
        were two experts that were brought to you,
        Dr. Dorce and Dr. Hurt.  I'm sorry.  So this is
        one of the issues is believability of witnesses,
        and I'm going to go through some of the
        instructions.
              The judge just read this to you, but you
        have to consider the expertise, the experience,
        the knowledge, the training of these experts in
        saying who do you believe more.
              And, quite frankly, we do bring you experts
        to see if somebody was addicted to nicotine or
        not, but one of the reasons that I did go over the
        definitions with Dr. Dorce is that you-all -- you
        know, you-all are laypeople, intelligent people.
09:58:25
09:58:35
09:58:51
09:59:01
09:59:15 4784 You don't have to be a doctor to be able to see
        whether or not somebody meets the definition of
        addiction.  Karl Ahrens is not here for somebody
        to make a medical diagnosis of him.
              So there was a lot of things that Dr. Dorce
        didn't know but that we do know, and even based
        upon what we do know -- and I submit he didn't
        have all the criteria for the DSM-5, but in
        considering whether somebody is addicted or not,
        you consider each expert.  And you don't have to
        consider Dr. Dorce at all.  If you feel that
        Dr. Dorce was not qualified or not being frank or
        not being honest and not being forthright, you can
        disregard everything that she said.
              But you have these two experts and we
        brought you -- you know, again, it's an important
        case for my client.  And we brought you
        Dr. Richard Hurt.  We brought you Dr. Richard
        Hurt.  You know he's treated thousands of patients
        for nicotine addiction.  He devoted his life to
        this.
              And then they brought you Dr. Dorce, and
        she doesn't treat people for nicotine addiction.
        People go there for other reasons.  In fact, they
        tell people to bring cigarettes to her facility.
09:59:28
09:59:42
09:59:53
10:00:08
10:00:18 4785 That's what she does for a living.  She's never --
        never been asked to lecture to anybody other than
        juries when she's been hired by them.
              And so this is what they asked Dr. Dorce:
        Why do people smoke?  And she said they smoke
        because of a habit, they smoke because of
        routines, they smoke because of control of weight.
        These are the reasons that she told you when she
        was on the stand in direct examination.  And one
        thing that she didn't tell you in direct
        examination is that the primary reason people
        smoke is for nicotine.  They know that.  They know
        that.  And she knows that.
              And so when Dr. Dorce takes the stand and
        she gives you all the other reasons, she doesn't
        tell you the primary reason.  You have to ask
        yourself, why wouldn't she be telling me this, why
        is she not telling us about the nicotine.  Because
        there are -- that people want to smoke just for
        the taste or just because it's a habit, they can
        go smoke cigarettes without nicotine if they want.
        But nicotine is there for a reason.  It's there
        for a reason, and they know it.
              We also know that they knew much more about
        nicotine than was even in the published
10:00:31
10:00:44
10:00:59
10:01:13
10:01:30 4786 literature.  They know how important nicotine is.
        And when you look in their own documents, when you
        see why are people smoking, why do they think the
        people are smoking, how are they getting people to
        be customers for 30, 40, 50 years, people who want
        to quit, people who are trying to quit, people
        whose family are asking them to quit, people who
        are saying, hey, I like it, and they know in their
        own documents that they are in the business of
        selling nicotine, an addictive drug that they
        designed, the products that deliver nicotine, that
        their industry is based on nicotine.  And there's
        nothing in there anywhere, anywhere in their
        documents where they are talking about let's give
        people a choice, let's make the nicotine levels
        low enough so people can quit when they want to.
              In fact, they say the opposite.  They talk
        about how low can we keep them and keep people
        addicted.  And so when you look at even Dr. Dunn,
        who was a scientist for Philip Morris who gave a
        speech, one of the things -- he gave two speeches.
        One there was information, and the other one there
        wasn't.  He had internal memos which had some
        things that he did not reveal in his speech, but
        when he was writing his book and he signed his
10:01:44
10:01:55
10:02:08
10:02:22
10:02:39 4787 book to a friend, he said, "No doubt about it,
        it's all about the nicotine."  And they know that.
              So, you know, I think now -- hopefully now
        that you-all realize that that's what it is about.
        It is about the nicotine.  And they are in the
        business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug.
        That's how they designed their products.  And if
        they are going to be in the business of selling
        nicotine, an addictive drug, how can they be
        marketing to teenagers 21 years of age and under?
              In fact, Dr. Leung from Lorillard said they
        should never market to anybody 21 years or
        younger.  And so they know that 60 percent of
        their consumers are going to grow up and die;
        whether it's 50 percent or 80 percent or 90
        percent, there's a large percentage of these
        teenagers in our country who are going to smoke
        their products, who are going to get addicted --
        not everybody is addicted.  Some people could
        smoke a few cigarettes, some people could smoke a
        couple here and there and quit whenever they want.
        That happens.
              But people who smoke a pack, two packs a
        day, those people are generally addicted to
        nicotine.  People are smoking all day long.  And
10:02:54
10:03:07
10:03:23
10:03:35
10:03:44 4788 then why would they want to market a product to
        teenagers, who they know 50, 90 percent are going
        to become addicted and 60 percent are going to die
        a pretty bad death.
              And so these are the different definitions
        of addiction that we brought to you.  It's a
        chronic relapsing brain disease, despite harmful
        consequences.  You know, that's drug addiction.
        People will use it chronically.  People will try
        to quit and start again, try to quit and start
        again.  That's relapsing.  And they do it despite
        their knowledge of a harmful consequence.
              Those are all the different definitions of
        addiction that we went over with Dr. Dorce.  They
        are from NIDA, the American Psychiatric
        Association, you know, compulsive use, repetitive
        behavior of activity despite adverse consequence.
              So you have to ask yourself, is that what
        Karl Ahrens did?  Was he addicted?  Was he
        somebody who was addicted, or did he smoke just
        because he liked the taste and he smoked and he
        can take it or leave it whenever he wanted to?
              And so here is what we know about Karl.
        Again, 90 percent start as teenagers.  He smoked
        for 35 -- approximately 35 years.  Look, his
10:03:59
10:04:15
10:04:26
10:04:40
10:05:02 4789 family said he started at 18.  His son said he
        started before that.  Dr. Dorce said between 16
        and 18 because people experiment.  And we know
        that he quit around '91-'92 because not only is
        that what his family said, but they filled out --
        he had filled out a survey in 1991 or '90 or '91
        that he was smoking Merit Ultra Lights.
              He smoked a pack to a pack and-a-half a
        day.  200 to 300 hits of nicotine to the brain
        every day.  First thing in the morning.  When he
        tried to quit, he would have a withdrawal, a
        well-recognized withdrawal.  He smoked despite the
        harmful consequences.  And he would make multiple
        attempts.  And even when he quit for a day or two
        days or three days or a week, he would relapse and
        go right back.
              That's what addiction is.  It's a chronic
        relapsing disorder that people do despite the
        harmful consequences even when they want to quit.
        And that's addiction.
              And so we know the ASAM, the American
        Society of Addiction Medicine, they say in their
        own criteria that the two most clinically useful
        tests to determine physical dependence are the
        Fagerstrom and the Heaviness of Smoking Index.
10:05:18
10:05:32
10:05:45
10:05:56
10:06:14 4790 So those are the two that scientists and
        doctors -- I know there's a book, the DSM-5 which
        we talked to Dr. Dorce about.  And, again, I'm not
        shying from that book.  I still feel confidently
        that Mr. Ahrens did meet all those criteria.  But
        that's a book for psychiatrists for mental
        illnesses.
              Most people when they go -- when they want
        to stop smoking, they want to go to their doctor,
        they go to their family doctor, they go to other
        doctors, and those doctors generally use these two
        tests.  And we know under these tests, that from
        what we know of Karl Ahrens, because we don't know
        everything, but when you go through the Fagerstrom
        Test, that he had somewhere between 7 -- and, you
        know, he could have had more because two of the
        questions we don't know the answers of, but no
        matter how you cut it, when you use that test, he
        was somebody who was considered highly addicted.
              And the same with the Heaviness of Smoking
        Index.  That's not something that Dr. Hurt came up
        with on his own.  It's a widely used,
        well-recognized, reliable test, because they look
        at -- they look at how soon is this person smoking
        when he gets up.  Is he somebody who is smoking
10:06:29
10:06:41
10:06:55
10:07:09
10:07:23 4791 two hours, three hours, four hours, a day later.
        Does it not matter to him when he gets his first
        cigarette or is he smoking on his way to the
        bathroom, because that matters because you guys
        know that the nicotine receptors in the morning
        are empty.  The way they work is they need to be
        filled, they need to be filled for nicotine, and
        when you're not getting your nicotine, if you're
        addicted to nicotine, you need it.  You feel
        like -- you know, you feel better when you have
        it.  You feel like it relaxes you.  It makes you
        feel relaxed.  It makes you feel more at ease.
              So people who smoke within five minutes and
        smoke, you know, 20, 30 hits of cigarettes of
        nicotine a day are those that are considered
        highly dependent, highly addicted.
              And we also know Dr. Dorce used the DSM-5.
        And even when we went through the DSM-5 with
        Dr. Dorce, you can go through all the criteria,
        and the only ones that he did not meet are the
        two, the one that says recurrent tobacco use
        resulting in failure to fulfill major roles and
        obligations, and even that book says that that
        rarely -- rarely happens with tobacco use because
        you can't -- there's most places you can smoke,
10:07:38
10:07:49
10:08:03
10:08:18
10:08:32 4792 you can at work or things like that.  So that one
        barely even is applicable.  And the other one he
        didn't fulfill was the one where, you know,
        continued despite knowledge of problems because he
        didn't yet have a problem before he quit smoking.
              So I submit to you that, you know, he was
        highly addicted under any criteria, and he --
        ultimately he tried to quit and ultimately, thank
        God, he did quit.  But, you know, some people who
        quit, unfortunately, because of the damage that's
        done, they are still going to get lung cancer, and
        that's what happened to him.
              So we know how much time he spent -- when
        you talk about did the addiction cause his
        illness, did the addiction cause his lung cancer,
        we know how much time he spent administering
        nicotine to his brain.  And that's why -- and
        maybe I wasn't clear, somebody said to me
        yesterday that I wasn't clear in terms of the
        hours.
              But what I was trying to say was obviously
        the day is 24 hours, but people need to sleep,
        right.  So if you take 16 hours a day and you take
        somebody with the number of cigarettes that he
        smoked and they smoke one after the other, it
10:08:47
10:09:04
10:09:17
10:09:28
10:09:42 4793 would take him that long to finish all of the
        cigarettes.  And he spent a lot of time doing it.
              And while doing it, these are all the
        carcinogens that he's exposing his body to.  And
        all the different carcinogens, cyanide,
        formaldehyde, arsenic, are all going into his body
        with every inhalation of cigarettes that he takes.
              So we know that his lifetime exposures are
        different than a social smoker.  Instead of
        somebody smoking maybe a pack a month, who is
        really not doing that much damage to their body,
        he is getting 2-and-a-half to almost 4 million of
        these exposures because of his addiction to
        nicotine.  And so that's what we know.
              We know with smoking, people who are
        exposed to all these carcinogens, 50 percent --
        Dr. Hurt said 60 percent will die from a
        smoking-related disease.
              And so what happened with Karl -- and this
        is what, unfortunately, went on to occur that we
        know that he developed what's called
        adenocarcinoma of the lung.  And we know from
        doctor -- we know from all the evidence in the
        case, you-all may remember, with adenocarcinoma,
        number one, it's an adeno-related disease,
10:09:54
10:10:08
10:10:19
10:10:33
10:10:48 4794 adenocarcinoma of the lung.
              But the evidence was because of the design
        changes in cigarettes over time there was more
        adenocarcinoma of the lung or is more
        adenocarcinoma of the lung in our society.  We
        know that.  And we also know that people who smoke
        some of these cigarettes with these design changes
        will inhale more deeply, will inhale more.  And
        with adenocarcinoma, it goes further down in the
        lung.  And that's what happened to Karl Ahrens.
              And so his adenocarcinoma that we know that
        he had when they first did the bronchoscopy, they
        were unable to reach it.  You know, it wasn't that
        it wasn't in the lung.
              If he did not have lung cancer, they would
        not have done any more tests.  Nobody would have
        said he had lung cancer.  This is Dr. Ruckdeschel,
        who was, you know, one of the tops in the world,
        explained to you-all that what happens -- what
        happens, especially with adenocarcinoma, that the
        bronchoscopy may not be able to visualize the
        tumor.  And so what they did is they did a
        mediastinoscopy.  And when they did that, they
        took the biopsy from the lymph nodes, from the
        mediastinum lymph nodes, and that biopsy showed
10:11:00
10:11:13
10:11:26
10:11:40
10:11:55 4795 that he had non-small cell carcinoma.
              And what we know is when he was referred to
        Moffitt Cancer Center, all the doctors at the
        prior hospital, the pathologist, the surgeon, when
        they discharged him to his family doctor, they
        said, hey, he's got adenocarcinoma.  It's a single
        solid mass, which we know.  When it metastasizes,
        it becomes multiple masses through the
        bloodstream.  He had a single solid mass.
              It ended causing a pleural effusion which
        happens with lung cancer.  It metastasized to the
        bone, and they knew that it was lung cancer.  It
        was nothing else.  There was nothing else.
              They said, oh, he didn't have an autopsy.
        Who has an autopsy?  When people know what you die
        from why would -- why would you want to subject
        Ina or her family to an autopsy of Karl Ahrens,
        when every single doctor said he had lung cancer
        because maybe 20 years later a tobacco company
        would say you have not proved it with 100 percent
        certainty.  That's not -- that's not -- that's not
        fair, and that's not right.
              They knew he had lung cancer.  They put him
        in a special study for only people with lung
        cancer.  And so everybody at Moffitt who treated
10:12:11
10:12:25
10:12:37
10:12:53
10:13:07 4796 him knew he had lung cancer.  He had two pathology
        reports at Moffitt.  They both came up
        adenocarcinoma.  One of them said consistent with
        a favor lung primary, and the other one said
        consistent with lung primary.  And both of them
        called for a clinical correlation.
              And we know with adenocarcinoma it can only
        be breast cancer, ovary cancer.  He didn't have
        those; we know that.  Esophogeal cancer, we know
        he did not have that.  Stomach, pancreas, colon
        cancer, kidney cancer, which we know he had a
        normal CT of the abdomen.  And the only other
        possibility in the world was that maybe he had
        prostate cancer, which we know all of his urinary
        symptoms are normal, and he had a normal rectal
        exam.
              So it would be physically impossible for
        somebody to have Stage IV cancer of any of those
        types -- forget he had a single solid mass that
        looked like lung cancer, that everybody said was
        lung cancer, that went to the -- caused the
        pleural effusion and went to the mediastinum lymph
        nodes and everything, forget that.  The
        adenocarcinoma, could it be anything else?  So
        from a process of elimination, you would have to
10:13:23
10:13:37
10:13:54
10:14:06
10:14:17 4797 know even, without a chest x-ray, that it had to
        be lung cancer.
              And so he was treated at Moffitt by all
        these doctors.  I mean, these are doctors -- they
        were not hired by me; they didn't know me; they
        didn't know anybody; they didn't know the tobacco
        companies.  Every single one of them, five
        different oncologists.  We had a GI oncologist, a
        radiation oncologist, different surgeons.  Every
        single one of them, when you look -- I think there
        was actually more in the medical records who
        diagnosed him with lung cancer.
              So if you have any doubt, you can look
        through those medical records, you will see that
        every single solitary doctor in the world before
        we came to court -- well, every single doctor in
        the world who has ever spoken about him, because
        there's nobody in on the other side, everybody
        said it was lung cancer.
              And so the death certificate says lung
        cancer.
              And so then when you put everything
        together -- and this is just to determine if he's
        a class member, in all fairness, is he somebody
        who is a member of the Engle Class.  That's what
10:14:29
10:14:42
10:14:50
10:15:03
10:15:23 4798 we've been litigating, and we know that once
        somebody is smoking how they cause these changes,
        nicotine addiction causes these compulsive
        continual changes that results in lung cancer.
        This is the Surgeon General even saying how
        nicotine addiction causes cancer.
     transcribed as
        follows:)
              "We should also give priority to the one
        addiction, tobacco addiction, that is killing more
        than 300,000 Americans each year."
              (Video clip concluded.)
              MR. PAIGE:  Even Dr. Dorce yesterday
        finally did admit that nicotine addiction causes
        lung cancer.
              So, you know, this whole thing about, you
        know, is it the choice that caused the lung cancer
        or the nicotine addiction that causes the lung
        cancer, you know, I submit to you that's not what
        the law -- that's not what the law says.  The
        law -- if you read the law and you --
              MR. CARTER:  Objection, Your Honor,
        misstates the law.
              THE COURT:  Mr. Paige, you want to
        approach?
10:15:35
10:15:43
10:15:54
10:16:04
10:16:25 4799 MR. PAIGE:  No.
              THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, if you
        discern any difference at all between what the
        Court instructs you on the law and what anybody
        else says, you are legally obligated to follow the
        Court's instructions on the law.
              MR. PAIGE:  Right.
              And that's respectfully what I'm asking
        you, which I know you-all do, and what I'm saying
        is the law -- when you read the law you won't see
        any words about choice.  All you'll see is, was
        the addiction to nicotine a substantial
        contributing cause so that but for the -- but for
        the addiction, if he was not addicted, would he
        have smoked that much and developed lung cancer.
              And I submit to you the evidence is
        overwhelming that he has to be a class member.
              And on the prior slide -- if you go back,
        Robert -- you know, it talks about -- they even
        know, again -- we proved our case through their
        documents.
              They know internally it's all about the
        nicotine.  They are talking about here without the
        chemical compounds, the cigarette market would
        collapse, we'd all lose our jobs, we'd all lose
10:16:37
10:16:46
10:17:01
10:17:13
10:17:26 4800 our consulting fees.
              And that's the -- you know, the sad part
        because there's no -- there's no compassion in
        there, there's no compassion for what's going on
        for anybody other than themselves.  And they are
        worried about -- when you look at those documents
        and you see what their concerns are, where they
        are concerned -- look, I know they are a business.
        Businesses have to make money.
              But when you make money, there has to be
        some morals.  And even Dr. Wakeham, which we'll
        play, said, "Hey, we're a moralistic company."
              How moralistic is it when you know all that
        they know and they expressed not one concern, not
        any compassion, not any compassion for any human
        being but themselves, nothing, zero, and all they
        care about is whether they will lose their jobs
        and whether they will be out of business
        overnight.  And all they know is it's about the
        nicotine, and that's all they are concerned with.
              And when they now say that he's not a class
        member, I submit to you it would not be consistent
        with the law.  So once we know he is a class
        member, that Karl Ahrens, who has always wanted to
        be a member of the class, who is a class, then we
10:17:37
10:17:47
10:18:00
10:18:12
10:18:25 4801 know -- and this is what the -- and this is what
        the argument is.  Because once he's a class
        member, we know that you have to embrace the
        findings as if you found it yourselves.  They know
        that.  They know you have to embrace the findings,
        and they know what they did.  The proof is and the
        overwhelming evidence is that they did these
        things.
              So what they did is -- if we can skip the
        first two -- they know that their products are
        defective and unreasonably dangerous.  The
        products that Karl Ahrens smoked, the filters did
        not work, Micronite filters.
              Imagine they tell somebody when all this is
        going on back in the '50s and the '60s and the
        '70s that there's this controversy.  And they say,
        hey, we have a filter that's going to take out --
        if there is anything harmful, it will be removed.
        It will be removed.  And then the people find out
        it didn't remove anything.
              They promised me they were going to
        remove -- they told me that they were going to
        remove anything harmful and didn't remove
        anything.  And then they told me the lights would
        be safer if I switched to lights, but internally
10:18:38
10:18:48
10:19:02
10:19:16
10:19:25 4802 they knew that people who were smoking lights were
        getting as much or more tar and nicotine.
              And the Merit Ultra Lights had 77 percent
        more free nicotine.  They were adding more
        chemicals to the Merit Ultra Lights to keep the
        nicotine levels higher.  So that's not fair.
        That's not right.  And that's what they did.
              They were negligent.  They were careless.
        You know, there's an instruction that it says --
        the Judge just read it, you know, corporations
        have to be treated like a person, right.  And for
        a person you have to -- you know, negligent, what
        would a reasonable careful person, a reasonable
        prudent person, somebody with morals and caring
        about people, what would they do, were they
        negligent.  And they were negligent.
              And, you know, there's a book -- everything
        I knew I learned I knew in kindergarten, right, be
        nice, be fair, don't lie to people, don't hurt
        people.  You know, think about other people.
              And they didn't do that.  They didn't do
        that.  And they did everything but that.  And
        that's a problem with them.  And they weren't --
        they were not stupid people.
              You know, something like this happens in
10:19:37
10:19:52
10:20:06
10:20:20
10:20:32 4803 life for 50 years and you think, how did this
        happen.  These are grown men who were going home
        to dinner with their families and eating and
        enjoying all their profits that they were talking
        about and people were dying and they didn't care.
        And so they were negligent.  That's the truth.
        That's a finding.  That's a fact.
              They concealed or omitted material
        information, important information knowing what
        they were saying was false concerning the health
        effects and addictive nature of smoking.
              And then they entered into an agreement
        with each other.  So now you have not just one
        company, you have six companies, and they go to
        The Plaza Hotel, right, and they know -- because
        that's the finding -- they know that -- there's
        the thing about punitive damages.  Are they
        recklessly indifferent to the rights of others, do
        they care -- how bad is what they did.
              And they go to The Plaza Hotel, all these
        companies, all these executives, all these grown
        men, and they sit in a room, and they devise a
        plan where they want people to rely upon it to
        their detriment.
              MS. ARNOLD:  Objection, Your Honor,
10:20:44
10:20:57
10:21:10
10:21:23
10:21:36 4804 mischaracterizing the findings.
              THE COURT:  Overruled.
              MR. PAIGE:  And so you have all these
        people.  And, you know -- and the point is these
        are real people.  This is Ina Ahrens, and she's
        lived through this.  This is the harm that they
        knew would happen to families.  This isn't, like,
        some obscure thing that happened.  It happens
        every day.
              Think about it, 500,000 people a year in
        our country, how many people that is, how many
        people.  It's more than a thousand people every
        day.  And how many of them started when they
        didn't know what they knew, and how many did they
        take advantage of.
              And so, you know, there's a movie, probably
        a lot of you probably saw it, maybe the younger
        ones maybe not, but it's called A Few Good Men,
        and there's a part in the movie where -- it's at
        the end of the movie, and there's the two guys,
        Dawson and Downey, and so the big guy -- I forget
        his name -- that was Dawson, the little guy was
        Downey.  And the little guy says:
              "How?  I don't understand how come we're
        going to get in trouble.  What did we do?  We
10:21:56
10:22:07
10:22:19
10:22:32
10:22:42 4805 didn't do anything wrong?"
              And the big guy says:  "No.  But we didn't
        help anybody.  We sat back, and we didn't help
        anybody when we could have."
              And think about this, for 50 years all
        these people knowing that people were dying,
        knowing that they would rely upon them to their
        detriment and all they care about was one thing,
        one thing, and that was their money.
              And so those are the findings and that's --
        those are very important in this case.  And that's
        the issue of why class membership is important.
              The next issue is, was smoking a
        cigarette -- manufactured by each Defendant a
        legal cause.
              So we have two cigarettes that we've been
        litigating about in this case, the Kent and the
        Merit Ultra Lights.
              And so did each cigarette contribute to
        lung cancer, that's one of the questions.  And so
        this -- the instruction says the, Defendant's
        cigarette was a legal cause of injury if smoking
        that is directly and in natural and continuous
        sequence produced or contributed substantially to
        producing such injury, so that it can reasonably
10:22:51
10:23:03
10:23:26
10:23:39
10:23:59 4806 be said that but for smoking that Defendant's
        cigarettes -- so but for the Merit Ultra Lights or
        but for the Kent -- the injury would not have
        occurred.
              And then it says in order to prove as a
        legal cause, smoking of cigarettes manufactured by
        either of the Defendants need not be the only
        cause.  Smoking the Defendants' cigarettes may be
        a legal cause of his lung cancer and death even
        though it operates in combination with the
        cigarettes of another.
              So it doesn't have to be that just the
        Kents caused it or just the Merit Ultra Lights
        caused it, it could be both.  And now doctor --
        the issue in this case is that doctor -- go to the
        next slide -- Dr. Ruckdeschel said in cross
        examination, he said at one point, if he had quit
        in 1980, he probably would have got lung cancer
        anyway because we know 25 years of smoking is a
        lot that, hey, probably he would have gotten lung
        cancer.  But we know also that he said that's
        speculation.  Who really knows.
              What we do know is that he did continue to
        smoke, and as he continued to smoke, his
        chances -- and Dr. Ruckdeschel said this, the
10:24:10
10:24:23
10:24:35
10:24:52
10:25:07 4807 likelihood increased and increased and increased
        until we know with the certainty that he did get
        lung cancer.
              So, and the epidemiological studies and the
        evidence in this case have shown that there's a
        dose-response effect, and it increases with the
        length of time each individual smokes and with the
        number of cigarettes consumed.
              So with every cigarette smoked, there's
        more harm and more harm being done to his body.
        And even we know -- we can speculate what would
        have happened if he quit in 1980 or what would
        have happened if he quit in 1970 or what would
        have happened if he quit in 1985.  But what we do
        know in this case, he smoked until about 1991 or
        1992, and what we do know is that each cigarette
        he smoked along the way damaged his body so that
        the cancer that we know that he got with 100
        percent certainty, not that he may have -- would
        have gotten it, not that he probably would have
        gotten it, but the one that we know that he got
        was caused by all the damage.
              And, truthfully, it's not really an issue
        for us.  It's more of an issue between them
        because if after 1980 Merit has no
10:25:20
10:25:31
10:25:44
10:26:01
10:26:13 4808 responsibility -- they are still responsible for
        the conspiracy, by the way.  They don't get --
        conspiracy, they are responsible even if they
        didn't smoke their cigarette.  But then Kent would
        be responsible for all the damage.
              But the issue is, and I think the
        overwhelming evidence is the more you smoke, the
        more the chances increase, the more the likelihood
        increases until we know with absolute certainty
        what happened here.
              So I would submit the answer to those are
        yes to both.
              And then the next issue is apportionment of
        fault.  And so once you decide that somebody is a
        class member and the cigarettes are involved, you
        have to apportion responsibility.  And, again, you
        know that we've accepted some responsibility in
        combination with the acts of the Defendants on the
        negligence and strict liability claims.
              And the judge has instructed you it doesn't
        apply to the fraud claims because the law does not
        allow if somebody does something on purpose, if
        somebody commits a fraud or they commit a
        conspiracy, they don't get the benefit of
        comparative fault in our society.  So that's
10:26:30
10:26:41
10:26:56
10:27:11
10:27:22 4809 different.
              So on the negligence claim and the strict
        liability claims, we do admit that we bear some
        responsibility, but it's important to see what
        responsibility Mr. Ahrens had in comparative to
        what the Defendants did.
              So we brought you Dr. Proctor; and they
        brought you Dr. Pach.  And I just think it's --
        Dr. Pach said that he was the historian of Karl
        Ahrens, but he didn't know much about Karl Ahrens.
        But he did read the Surgeon General Report.  He
        did say he read that, and one of things that he
        did acknowledge is that he was aware either
        through reading that and reading the book,
        Cigarette Century, he was aware of all the harm
        and lies caused by the Defendants' conspiracy.
              So you have to go back in time to when Karl
        Ahrens was growing up, and you apportion his
        fault.  And you have to look at what -- because
        the rule of the law for comparative fault is what
        would a reasonable person have done under like
        circumstances at that time, in the '50s, the '60s,
        the '70s.  What was a reasonable, normal, usual
        thing doing.
              That's why I asked Dr. Dorce, I said,
10:27:35
10:27:48
10:28:03
10:28:17
10:28:29 4810 there's nothing unusual about somebody, especially
        back then, smoking in their 20s, their 30s, trying
        to quit in their 40s, taking many, many times and
        finally quitting.
              So when he was smoking, in the world he
        grew up in, smoking was normal, athletes smoked.
        You know, Hank Aaron, that's Len Dawson during the
        Super Bowl.  The other day it was the Super Bowl.
        It would be like Cam Newton or Peyton Manning
        smoking in the locker room, it would be unheard
        of.  But back then, it was normal.  It was normal
        for that to occur.
              You know, he grew up in a world where, you
        know, there was nothing wrong with seeing things
        like that, athletes and Santa Claus and doctors.
        And doctors, remember in the 1950s, 60 percent of
        doctors smoked.
              And they talk a lot about Karl Ahrens was
        an intelligent man.  Sure, he was intelligent.
        Intelligent people smoke.  You know, a lot of
        smart people smoke.  Millions of smart people
        smoke, and people smoke when they are intelligent
        because either they are uninformed or they are
        addicted.
              And Karl Ahrens, when he started smoking
10:28:40
10:28:56
10:29:11
10:29:23
10:29:34 4811 when he was younger, and his schoolbooks -- you
        know it's funny, they try to say in his work -- in
        his work they were teaching him about -- they had
        a wellness program at Xerox, he should have known
        better, he should have known better.  But if he
        knew -- if he knew better, how come -- how come
        the executives from Philip Morris and R.J.
        Reynolds who are going on TV and saying they
        didn't know, how is that okay?
              So how could he have known more than what
        they knew, when all the times where they knew
        internally, but they were lying about it?  But he
        grew up in a world where, you know, this is not
        even a mixed message.  The message was it was
        healthy and it was fun and it was okay to smoke.
        And so when he started smoking in the 1950s, did
        he do anything wrong?  Was there anything wrong
        with it?  When he was smoking in the 1960s, was
        there anything abnormal about it?
              You know, they were spending $200 billion.
        They will show you all the PSAs they had on TV.
        The PSAs don't compare.  You know, they had -- it
        was -- they would spend more in a day than the
        public health community would spend in a year.  So
        the public health community, I think if you do the
10:29:45
10:29:59
10:30:12
10:30:26
10:30:44 4812 math, it's about $10 million a day that they spent
        marketing their product.  That's what the public
        health community would do in a year.
              So when he was growing up, it's not like it
        is today.  You know, today you go on TV and you
        can see all the Public Health Service messages
        about how bad smoking is, and that's a great thing
        for kids to see, younger kids, kids in high school
        who grow up with that and they get that message.
        And there's no competing forces, there's no doubt,
        there's no confusion about it, there's no nothing.
        It's clear as can be now, and that's a great
        thing.
              But when Karl Ahrens was growing up, it was
        a different world, a different message.  In fact,
        even in the textbooks, you know, there's
        information in there about, hey, smoking is
        harmful, nicotine is a poison, and then they also
        talk about, but, you know, there's two sides, you
        need to make up your mind.  And how can you
        compete with all this advertising that's going on.
              And think about this.  If they are trying
        to teach it to the school kids in schoolbooks,
        don't smoke, don't smoke, why, why would they then
        try to target kids?  Why would they have all these
10:30:58
10:31:09
10:31:21
10:31:32
10:31:50 4813 messages, mixed messages to kids?  What would they
        even try to interfere with that or compete with
        that?  Why wouldn't they just stop doing that?
              Because if the schools are trying to teach
        the kids right from wrong, the schools are trying
        to help kids, why are they doing the opposite?
        What would motivate them?  You talk about
        motivation.  What's their motivation.  Why did
        they make their choices that they made?
              (Video clip played.)
              SPEAKER:  What cigarette do you smoke?
        You'll be interested to know how the doctors of
        America answered.  The brand named most was Camel.
              Yes, according to this survey, more doctors
        smoke Camel.
              Do you inhale?  Then you're better off
        smoking Philip Morris, and here is how you can
        prove it.  Light up a Philip Morris.  Take a puff.
              (Singing.)  Don't miss the fun of smoking.
        Don't miss the fun of smoking.  Mildness is a
        pleasure with Pall Mall.
              As with Bob Cousy, Kent is the favorite
        cigarette of millions of smokers.  And all over
        America, Kent with Micronite filter is smoked by
        more scientists and by more educators.
10:32:04
10:32:18
10:32:28
10:32:42
10:32:56 4814 DESI ARNAZ:  Lucy.
              LUCILLE BALL:  Yes, dear.
              DESI ARNAZ:  Give me a cigarette, will you,
        hon?
              LUCILLE BALL:  Don't say cigarette; say
        Philip Morris.
              DESI ARNAZ:  Oh, is there any other kind?
              LUCILLE BALL:  Not for you, there isn't.
              GRANNY:  I tell you, Pearl, Winston is
        good smoking.  Sure wish you could taste it.
              PEARL:  I am tasting it, Granny.  Winston
        tastes good.
              GRANNY:  Like a cigarette should.
              (Singing.)  You get a lot to like with a
        Marlboro, filter ...
              FRED FLINTSTONE:  Okay.  How's about taking
        a nap?
              BARNEY RUBBLE:  I got a better idea.  Let's
        take a Winston break.
              FRED FLINTSTONE:  That's it.  Winston is
        the one filter cigarette that delivers flavor
        twenty times a pack.  Winston has got that filter
        blend.
              (Singing.)  If you smoke a lot, please be
        certain that you've got the cigarette designed
10:33:01
10:33:10
10:33:23
10:33:32
10:33:42 4815 just for you.  Change to Kent, change to Kent,
        change to Kent.  With the Micronite filter.
              (Video clip concluded.)
              MR. PAIGE:  And so when you're talking
        about fault of Karl Ahrens and you're going to
        compare his fault to their defective product and
        their carelessness -- and we're not comparing his
        fault in 2015, what somebody would do in 2015 or
        2000 or even 1990.  When you look at that chart,
        the consumption level is rising and rising and
        rising until about 1982.  So he's doing --
        basically in 1960, 50 percent of doctors smoked.
        In 1970, 30 percent of doctors smoked.  In 1982,
        the consumption level starts going down and the
        truth starts coming out, and less people are
        starting to die and, actually, 1982 is when he
        starts trying to quit.
              But the cancer survey -- and this is
        from -- looking at a 1987 survey, this was still
        saying that about 15 to 20 million of Americans,
        you know, still had some -- they didn't know what
        we know today.
              And so when you blame the victim 100
        percent, I submit to you that's not fair when you
        consider the world he grew up in, the information
10:34:00
10:34:17
10:34:36
10:34:51
10:35:05 4816 that he had, the information that he believed
        about his filters, the information that he
        believed about what he was doing, and what they
        say internally and what they have said internally,
        not what they say publicly, not what they want the
        public to believe, not what they want people to
        know, but they know internally, they said all
        along is that it's not a free choice, it's not a
        free choice if somebody's addicted.  And it's been
        confirmed by the Surgeon General.
              So, and again, I'm not saying he did
        nothing, that he should not bear any
        responsibility, but all that I submit to you has
        to be considered.  Sure.  And again, you know --
        um -- um.  Next one.
              So I submit, you know -- and I submit you
        are saying to yourself, okay, but he didn't quit
        until 1991, 1992.  Why did it take him so long?
        Why did it take him so long?
              You know what?  That's a fair question.
        That's a fair question.  And I submit to you that
        he started quitting in 1982.  It wasn't a choice.
        He was addicted.  He tried as hard as he could.
              Look, everybody can try harder.  Everybody
        can try harder.  In retrospect, I'm sure he wishes
10:35:18
10:35:33
10:35:52
10:36:08
10:36:25 4817 he could have.  I'm sure Ina wishes that he did.
        But he was growing up in a world that's very
        different than what we know now.  He had totally
        different information than what we have now.
              So I submit to you from the time he was
        born, while, you know, Johnny Roventini and the
        candy cigarettes and the world he grew up in,
        through all the commercials that you saw until
        about 1982 when the consumption is going down, I
        submit to you he doesn't bear any responsibility
        for that.
              And we know that the first ten years -- we
        don't know what he smoked.  What we do know is
        that the Defendants had about 80 percent of the
        market, okay, they had 80 percent of the market.
        Do we know what brand he smoked?  We don't.  And
        I'm not asking you to apportion any fault to them
        for the first ten years because I don't know 100
        percent what he did smoke those years.
              But the next 25 years, we know what he
        smoked, and we know from 1966 until about 1982,
        about 15 years, he smoked their brands and the
        last ten years he smoked Ms. Arnold's company's
        brands.  So we can break it out into time periods
        it's 60/40.  Okay.  60 percent of the time before
10:36:38
10:36:52
10:37:03
10:37:16
10:37:35 4818 1982.  I submit to you R.J. Reynolds is
        100 percent at fault.  And I submit to you for the
        last 40 percent, for that time period, I submit to
        you that when Mr. Ahrens was trying to quit, when
        he was smoking the light cigarettes, when he
        thought that they were safer, when he was doing
        the best he could do, I admit that he does bear
        some responsibility, but I do not think -- it's up
        to you, you decide what you want to do.  These are
        just suggestions.  And obviously whatever you
        decide.
              But I would suggest to you that at the end
        when you compare the fault that the defective
        product of Philip Morris to the efforts of
        somebody who is addicted to nicotine was trying
        hard, that it's not 50/50 during that time period,
        but it's more like 25/75.  And that's why I came
        up with these numbers, 60/30/10.  And that's how
        we respectfully submit you apportion fault; but,
        again, that's just my suggestion.
              Your Honor, this will be a good time to
        break.
              THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.
              Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to give
        you a ten-minute recess now, and then we'll return
10:37:51
10:38:05
10:38:16
10:38:32
10:38:41 4819 to continue Mr. Paige's closing.
              (Jurors exited the courtroom.)
              COURT DEPUTY:  Jury is outside the hearing
        of the court.
              THE COURT:  Thank you, sir.  Ten minutes.
                   (Recess 10:39 a.m. until 10:50 a.m.)
              THE COURT:  As a housekeeping matter,
        Mr. Paige isn't back -- there you are, Mr. Paige.
              As a housekeeping matter, I calculate that
        it's going to be meal time or past meal time when
        we get through closings and instructions.  So I've
        had Deputy Robb distribute a menu to the jury.
        They are going to place their lunch orders now and
        target -- I told them to try to target delivery
        about one o'clock.
              Does that sound about right?
              MR. PAIGE:  From me or for them?
              THE COURT:  For the jury's tummies.  Does
        that sound like a reasonable -- when I say about
        right, does that sound like a reasonable
        prediction about when we're --
              MR. CARTER:  I think it would make sense,
        Your Honor, to probably break at the normal time
        for lunch.
              I'm gathering Mr. Paige has probably about
10:39:15
10:51:15
10:51:34
10:51:48
10:51:57 4820 another hour, hour and 10 minutes in his first
        part of his closing.  Am I wrong?
              MR. PAIGE:  You're pretty good.  You're
        pretty good.
              MR. CARTER:  So that would take us right up
        to about noon.  Rather than split the Defense
        closing over lunch, I think it makes more sense --
              THE COURT:  No.  I was anticipating we get
        everything done by one.  You don't think so?
              MR. CARTER:  No.
              MR. KACZYNSKI:  No.
              THE COURT:  Well, and that's why I'm
        asking.  I would delay that lunch order, then, and
        send them out on their own devices for lunch after
        the conclusion of Plaintiff's argument.  Okay.
        We'll -- I wish I could retrieve the deputy about
        now.
              MR. PAIGE:  Maybe if it gets here early,
        they can eat it if they want to.
              THE COURT:  Is that him?  That's another
        deputy.
              No, we'll let them know that they are going
        on their own for lunch after all.  I'll tell them
        it was my miscalculation.  And that's why I'm
        asking.
10:52:08
10:52:20
10:52:31
10:52:49
10:52:59 4821 (Pause in proceedings.)
              COURT DEPUTY:  All rise.  Court is now in
        session.  Bring the jury in, Your Honor?
              THE COURT:  Yes.
              (Jurors entered the courtroom.)
              COURT DEPUTY:  The jury is seated and
        accounted for, Your Honor.
              THE COURT:  Thank you, Deputy Robb.
              Before Mr. Paige proceeds, ladies and
        gentlemen, I want to apologize for probably
        getting your mouths watering for nothing.  I
        miscalculated and thought that we would be taking
        a lunch today, but we're actually going to be
        taking a break to send you to lunch in the usual
        manner.  So you'll be on your own for lunch after
        all.
              And with that, Mr. Paige, you may proceed.
              MR. PAIGE:  Okay.  So now I want to move on
        and talk about the fraud claims and the
        significance of the fraud claims.  And the fraud
        claims are different than what we have been
        talking about.
              The class membership, obviously you have to
        find under the law somebody to be a class member
        before the fraud claims apply.  But for the fraud
10:57:05
10:57:24
10:57:37
10:57:53
10:58:03 4822 claims, they are important for a couple reasons.
        But -- one reason is because they committed fraud,
        but another reason is for us to prevail on
        punitive damages -- well, actually, that's not --
        I don't think that's so.  So I was mistaken.
              But with the fraud claims, I just want to
        be clear that our admission of comparative fault
        does not apply, and that's not what we're
        admitting to, because for an intentional tort, the
        law does not apply for there to be a setoff for
        comparative fault because of what it is.  Somebody
        commits a fraud, admits concealment or conspiracy
        with the intent that they will harm people, they
        don't get that benefit, that other people do
        something by mistake or by negligence.
              So the first, as we all know -- for me to
        go through this with you-all again -- and for
        lawyers, we know that you guys took a lot of
        notes.  And not every jury takes a lot of notes,
        just so you know.  So we know you guys took a lot
        of notes and I know you guys paid attention.  A
        lot of what I'm saying, you guys are probably
        thinking to yourself, why is he telling me this,
        we heard this already.
              For a lawyer, I don't know what you know or
10:58:20
10:58:32
10:58:46
10:59:03
10:59:15 4823 what you thought.  So probably a lot of it -- I
        apologize if I'm being redundant on what you guys
        already know.  But I'm trying to just walk through
        the evidence with you and kind of apply it to the
        law.  So I guess that's it.
              In any event, we know and you-all know now
        that there was a meeting at The Plaza Hotel in
        1953, and that's when that mouse skin-painting
        study came out that was on the news and that
        people then started learning, because that was the
        first real big news that smoking caused lung
        cancer.
              And if you think about it, that was a time
        in society, again, where I think there was --
        there were tens of millions, whether it's
        50 million or 60 million Americans were smoking,
        and they did not know what we know now.
              So there was a meeting at The Plaza Hotel
        when that came out.  And all the executives were
        competitors.  It would be like if Coke and Pepsi
        and whatever, Verizon and another cell company got
        together, we need a meeting, this is a problem for
        our business, let's talk about how we're going to
        handle it and because a lot of people are dying
        and we need to make sure that we handle it
10:59:26
10:59:42
10:59:55
11:00:07
11:00:23 4824 together because if one person steps out of line,
        we'll all lose money.
              So they go and they meet at The Plaza Hotel
        and they carry out this conspiracy that you-all
        know about for about 50 years.  And when you think
        about that meeting, the reason that meeting is so
        important, sure, they did tell the Attorney
        General, they had to tell for other reasons that
        they were meeting, but nobody knew for decades
        what went on in those meetings, the Forwarding
        Memo that you guys saw, because that wasn't made
        public.
              But the significance or the historical
        significance of it was imagine back at that time,
        you know, people wouldn't accept about cigarettes
        what we accept now because we're basically, you
        know, numb to it or immune to it.  But back then,
        it was more normal and accepted that people were
        smoking.  And people didn't think that -- you
        know, that if it was harmful, it wasn't going to
        be okay back then, and they knew that.  They
        actually knew that.  They even said that, look, if
        it's harmful, we'll pull our product off the
        market, okay, which made sense back then.
              Think about it now, if a product came out
11:00:33
11:00:46
11:00:58
11:01:14
11:01:26 4825 today that they knew was going to kill hundreds of
        thousands of Americans that really had no
        redeeming quality and was a drug, it would not get
        approved, it wouldn't get approved.
              So back then, they had this meeting and
        this they said, look, this is a big study, this
        could really affect us.  Let's talk about this as
        individuals, as real people, what are we going to
        do about this, okay, how are we going to handle
        this, because we have -- they did have a
        responsibility, right.  They knew the harm that
        was going on.  They had a chance to change history
        right then and there, okay.  Because if they had
        kept their promise, if they had kept their promise
        of what people were expecting of them at that
        time, hundreds -- tens of millions of lives would
        have been saved.  So at that point, they had their
        meeting and they talked in the meeting.
              And when you read this, if you look at this
        Forwarding Memo, you'll see there really wasn't a
        concern about what was going on to the public, it
        was more of a concern about what was going on to
        them.
              And they talk about, you know, how they
        could profit if they could make the first
11:01:37
11:01:52
11:02:05
11:02:21
11:02:33 4826 cancer-free cigarette and how they were going to
        lock arms and walk together.  And that is when
        really, in terms of history, when this all started
        and when things could have been completely
        different.
              Can you show the chart again?  Is it coming
        up, or no?  So if you look at the consumption
        chart, when the news came out in 1953, you know,
        this is what was going on.  This line started
        going down.  And that's when people were concerned
        and people were quitting.
              And this is when they were having their
        meeting right there.  And that was significant in
        history because this news is coming out and it's
        telling people that, hey, look, we have this
        product, it's now been proven, proven that people
        who smoke -- cigarettes cause lung cancer.  And
        people were scared, and people started quitting.
              And at that point, the cigarette companies
        got together.  And if they would have gotten
        together and said, hey, look, we are making a
        product that's really hurting a lot of people,
        there are other businesses that we can do, maybe
        we go back to the non-inhalable cigarette.  --
        remember we had this cigarette that wasn't
11:02:44
11:03:01
11:03:12
11:03:27
11:03:39 4827 inhalable, that didn't get deep into the lungs,
        maybe we didn't sell as many, but maybe people
        were not addicted, but not that many people were
        dying.  Maybe we can make it so it's a habit they
        can break.  Maybe we take the nicotine out and we
        spend all of our money marketing that product.
              They had a lot of choices they could have
        made.  And instead -- and they knew -- you know,
        their internal memos where they talk about the
        research that was coming out, there was a lot of
        research that they showed, Dr. Proctor or
        Dr. Hurt, that was coming out about some of these
        harms.  But they knew the public wasn't reading --
        it wasn't like their consumers were keeping up
        with the research.  They were keeping up with the
        research and they were doing their own research.
        And in their internal memos, they talk about, hey,
        we know more -- we know a lot more than what's
        even in the published literature.
              So when they come forward and make this
        promise and they tell the people, this is what
        we're promising you, there is no proof, we accept
        people's health as a basic responsibility
        paramount to every other consideration in our
        business, that is what a reasonable company would
11:03:54
11:04:08
11:04:21
11:04:32
11:04:43 4828 do, right?
              If they know that they are making money
        hurting people, and they tell people who are --
        they know -- I'm not going to keep saying the
        statistics, but they know how many are starting as
        kids, how many are going to go on to die, how many
        of them get addicted and they say, look, it's
        natural that we're going to take your health
        paramount to our profits, but we believe that
        we're not making anything that's injuring anybody,
        and we're going to cooperate with the Surgeon
        General, there's no reason that anybody would
        disbelieve that.
              So and, again, at the beginning, in 1954
        when they went forward, this is what they said,
        which now, you know, 50 years later might seem a
        little funny, but back then, they said if any one
        of us believed that the product we were making and
        selling was in any way harmful to our customers'
        health, we would voluntarily go out of business.
              That's what they said, and that was what
        was expected back then.  That wasn't odd.  That
        wasn't strange.  That's what people thought.
        That's what people expected.  And that's what they
        told people, and people believed it.  And, you
11:04:54
11:05:06
11:05:18
11:05:33
11:05:44 4829 know, they made that statement all the way through
        the '70s.  And then here is the interview with the
        Philip Morris individuals.
     transcribed as
        follows:)
              MR. BOWLING:  I certainly wouldn't be in
        the business if I thought cigarettes were harmful
        to people.  I think it's important that there be a
        lot of us around who are trying to keep the
        research honest and open.  I think the real
        dishonesty is telling people things that are not
        so.
              PETER TAYLOR:  If you were convinced that
        cigarettes were killing people, would you stop
        making cigarettes?
              MR. BOWLING:  Oh, I've personally been on
        record on that for a long time.  I'm not in the
        business of killing people, obviously.  I've said
        all along, simply there are plenty of ways to make
        a living.  I happen to believe in what I'm doing
        very strongly.
              MR. WAKEHAM:  Anything can be considered
        harmful.  Applesauce is harmful if you get too
        much of it.
              PETER TAYLOR:  People are smoking a lot of
11:05:53
11:06:03
11:06:14
11:06:26
11:06:40 4830 cigarettes.
              MR. WAKEHAM:  Well, let me say it this way.
        The people who eat applesauce die.  The people who
        eat sugar die.  The people who smoke cigarettes
        die.  Does the fact that the people who smoke
        cigarettes die demonstrate that smoking is the
        cause?  I don't know what harms a cigarette smoker
        or what doesn't harm them.  I really honestly
        don't know that.  You must be trying to get me to
        admit that cigarette smoking is harmful.
              I think that if the company as a whole
        believed cigarettes were really harmful, we would
        not be in the business.  We're a very moralistic
        company.
              (The video clip ended.)
              MR. PAIGE:  The point is, I think everybody
        knows they should have been honest.  Had they been
        honest, they could have helped people.
              And there's other documents that I want to
        show you about how they intercepted people's
        ability to try to quit.  They did certain things
        with health assurances and smoking cessation
        clinics and the gum and the medications as they
        were coming out.
              So they had opportunities to do good
11:06:51
11:07:07
11:07:23
11:07:32
11:07:45 4831 things.  They had -- any one of those individuals
        had the opportunity to make the choice to do the
        right thing, to help people and not -- you know,
        not pick their profits over human lives.  And that
        was their choice.  And with their choices, there
        were horrible consequences for a lot of people, a
        lot of people.
              Bless you.
              We know that internally -- when they were
        making these statements publicly, we know
        internally that there was no doubt -- there was no
        confusion that they knew, you know, with 100
        percent certainty that they were hurting people
        and they were killing people.
              So here is the lies that we know that was
        going on.  And internally what they were saying is
        that they had to create doubt, because they knew
        with what was going on, to sell their product,
        especially with an addicted smoker, if you talked
        to somebody who is -- you know, and, in fact, even
        when you look at the polls that went out, there
        was a much higher belief level of people who were
        not smokers and people who were smokers.
              So the doubt, the confusion, the fact that
        filters are helpful or lights are helpful or it
11:07:58
11:08:12
11:08:22
11:08:43
11:08:54 4832 may not be proven or the dangers and ingredients
        would be removed was more readily believable by
        people who were addicted to nicotine, and they
        knew that.
              So in their internal documents, they talk
        about things, Doubt is Our Product, Doubt is Our
        Product.
              We have to provide smokers with a
        psychological crutch, rationale to continue
        smoking.  And you have to say to yourself or think
        to yourself or people should think why would they
        do that, is that fair, is that right.
              These are bad people who are making bad
        decisions, and they are making decisions that are
        hurting other people.  And that's -- again, it's
        not a criminal case.  Nobody is going to jail in
        this courtroom, but in a civil society are those
        type of actions acceptable by individuals who have
        power.
              I mean, they had power.  You know, who is
        Karl Ahrens?  He worked -- he went to school.  He
        worked at a computer company, Xerox.  Who are the
        normal people in society who are smoking, just
        regular people who are trying to do the right
        thing or trying to raise their families, who are
11:09:05
11:09:18
11:09:28
11:09:41
11:09:54 4833 loving their families.
              And they are powerful people.  You saw the
        power they had with their lobbying efforts, the
        power they had with the media, the power they had
        to do the right thing and all the money, all the
        opportunities to do what was right and do what was
        fair.
              And instead of saying, hey, the key word is
        compassion.  The key word is helping people.  The
        key word is being nice.  The key word is being
        honest.  They talk about the key word is
        confusion.  Let's deny the truth.  And I submit to
        you the overwhelming evidence just, you know,
        everybody knows is that that's a very bad thing,
        not a right thing for people to do to other
        people.
              Here is some of the public statements.
     transcribed as
        follows:)
              MR. CULLMAN:  I don't believe that most
        people who smoke get lung cancer.  We are now in
        an era, as you know, of moderation.  We have
        smoking habits which incidentally today changing
        the type of cigarettes from regular cigarettes to
        filters.
11:10:06
11:10:18
11:10:34
11:10:43
11:10:58 4834 I don't think the industry admits there are
        any bad elements.  If they are bad elements,
        through our laboratories, through the Surgeon
        General, through the AMA, through acts of God, and
        luck, we hope we may find them.  And if they are
        found, they will be removed.
                      *    *    *    *
              MR. CULLMAN:  We do not believe that
        cigarettes are hazardous.  We don't accept that.
        Because when, as, and if any ingredient in
        cigarette smoke is identified as being injurious
        to human health, we are confident that we can
        eliminate that ingredient.
              (The video clip ended.)
              MR. PAIGE:  And so, you know, internally
        they discuss these things because in 1953 -- and
        you guys probably have it in your notes; but I
        believe if I recall the numbers were about
        3 percent smoked filters, and by the '60s, it was
        60 percent.  And now it's about 99 percent.
              So why -- why were people switching from
        non-filtered to filters, and they were switching
        because they were being told, if there's anything
        dangerous, if there's anything unsafe, it would be
        removed.  We're looking into it.  We're going to
11:11:10
11:11:20
11:11:34
11:11:51
11:12:06 4835 remove it, but you could be assured in the
        meantime just smoke this thing with the filter,
        but internally they are saying, we're really not
        filtering anything out.  But externally they are
        saying, hey, just smoke our filter.
              And they knew internally people were
        switching for health reasons.  Health reasons are
        the reason people are trying them.  The public has
        been conditioned to accept that filter effects of
        charcoal and other fields and when charcoal was
        added it proved to be an effective advertising
        gimmick.
              So, again, this is part of their
        conspiracy.  This is what they were concealing.
        And when we think later what was being concealed,
        what was being concealed, you know, they can ask
        Ina Ahrens, "Oh, did your husband ever know who
        the TIRC was?  Did he know who the CTR was?  Did
        he ever said he relied on a statement from the
        TIRC or CTR?
              He might -- nobody even knew who they were
        because they were not telling people that these
        doctors, who were making statements, were frauds
        and were being paid by them.  How would he know?
              The issue is what was the CTR and all the
11:12:19
11:12:31
11:12:40
11:12:56
11:13:06 4836 companies concealing from people?  What were they
        not telling people?  And that's the problem with
        the concealment claim.  The concealment claim is
        they had the information.  They knew the truth,
        and they wouldn't tell people about it.
              And so here is some of their filters.  This
        is the brand that Karl Ahrens smoked.  Kent
        Micronite filters.  One that more educators and
        scientists smoked.
              So when you talk about, he was an
        intelligent man.  A lot of intelligent people
        smoked.  Millions of intelligent people were and
        are addicted to nicotine.  It's not their fault.
        But they capitalize on it; they take advantage of
        it.
              Educators, teachers, scientists.  You know,
        this one here, how effective are these filters?
              Kents Micronite filter approaches seven
        times the efficiency of other filters in removal
        of tars and nicotines and is twice as effective as
        the next most efficient filter.
              There was no efficiency, zero efficiency,
        zero.  So somebody is using a product.  They think
        that it's filtering something out.  It's not
        filtering anything out.  All those carcinogens
11:13:18
11:13:31
11:13:43
11:13:54
11:14:09 4837 that I showed you that people were getting, the
        arsenic, cyanide, the formaldehyde, polonium-210,
        that wasn't filtering any of that out, zero, zero.
              You know who knew it?  You think Karl
        Ahrens knew it?  They knew it.  Their clients knew
        it.  They knew it 100 percent.  There wasn't a
        mistake.  There was no secret to them.
              Internally this was what they are saying.
        And this is what they were concealing.  This is
        what people had a right to know.  People were
        entitled to know the truth.  People are entitled
        to know the truth.
              And when they internally say the sale of
        filter-tip cigarettes -- imagine somebody smoking
        filter-tipped cigarettes, they think it's doing
        them some good, and they get throat cancer, lung
        cancer, some disease.  And they find out later,
        later that this is what they knew all along?  Is
        that the way corporations -- is that what we
        expect corporations to do and act that way?
              The sale of filter-tip cigarettes is purely
        a merchandising, sales promotion proposition.
        People are smoking cigarettes with filters wind up
        smoking more in order to provide themself with the
        same amount of nicotine.
11:14:23
11:14:35
11:14:48
11:15:05
11:15:20 4838 They studied compensation.  They knew
        what -- before you got here, did you know about
        compensation?  How people compensated to get the
        nicotine that they wanted with light cigarettes?
        They knew about it.
              We say here is our triple, quadruple filter
        removing whatever it is; meanwhile, we're giving
        them a full nice jolt of nicotine.
              Here Kent -- Kent, the one he's talking
        about.  Hey, we're going to exploit some Reader's
        Digest that made a mistake.  We're going to
        exploit it because of the safety image.
              Illusion of filtration.
              Smoker of filters is getting as much or
        more tar and nicotine.  And every day, every day
        they did that thousands of people were dying every
        single day.  You know -- and this is in the '70s.
              I mean, they still had a chance.  I mean,
        somebody, you know, in the '80s whistleblowers
        started coming out.  In the '90s some of the
        documents through other means were forced to come
        over.
              But, I mean, come on, they had -- you know,
        the executives of those companies, you know, do
        you really think they were doing the right thing
11:15:30
11:15:42
11:15:54
11:16:08
11:16:21 4839 when they knew the harm that they were causing
        people, like Karl Ahrens, Ina Ahrens for 20 years
        she's living alone.
              That's the damage they left when they --
        when they all went home and did their thing and
        they spent their money and they enjoyed all the
        things that they benefited from this, they didn't
        think about Ina Ahrens, and she's home for 20
        years taking care of herself because her husband
        didn't know they were going to exploit the Kent
        filter he was smoking?
              It wasn't only, you know, Karl Ahrens who
        was fooled.  All these people thought that filters
        were safer because now they know, you know, now
        they know because now -- Dr. Proctor told you now
        even the World Health Organization -- you know,
        they showed something from the World Health
        Organization.
              We know now the World Health Organization
        says they are no safer, took a long time.  We know
        now the Surgeon General, all these government
        companies, now that they have seen their
        scientific studies that they were doing and their
        internal documents and they understand
        compensation.
11:16:30
11:16:42
11:16:55
11:17:07
11:17:18 4840 You look at any of those reports, and they
        will tell you what they know, how they knew it,
        and why it took so long for them to learn it, and
        what the harm was to society of people because of
        their lies.
              And they knew too.  They knew too because
        if you look at their documents for nearly
        20 years -- this is what they are saying in '72.
              So remember The Plaza Hotel was in '53.  So
        now they are writing about it 20 years later.  So
        20 years later, okay -- we're now talking between
        '53 and '73, it's 10 million people died, right,
        500,000 people a year.
              So now in that 20 years a lot of people
        have been hurt, a lot of people have been hurt.
        And they are writing about it, hey, we have this
        strategy.  It's been great.  It was brilliantly
        conceived and executed.  We won important battles.
        It's been a holding strategy about creating doubt,
        about the health charge without actually having to
        deny it, and it helped us defend ourself on three
        major fronts.
              Litigation, they don't want any litigation.
        All the litigation that we now know of that --
        because we now know about this stuff, they were
11:17:29
11:17:44
11:18:00
11:18:14
11:18:26 4841 able to fend that off for decades, no
        responsibility to nobody.
              Defend itself on politics.  We talk about
        it -- all the things that they have been able to
        benefit from where we are.  Now they have FDA
        oversight from 2009.  They were able to stall that
        for decades.
              And public opinion.  Public opinion.  Let
        people think it's a choice.  We're going to go
        ahead and do this holding strategy.  People won't
        know what we know.  And for 20 years this is what
        they bragged about internally about how brilliant
        that was, how brilliant it was.
              Nobody, nobody in the world, no government
        entity, nobody who got their documents later
        looked at this and said, boy, these guys were
        brilliant.  Nobody, nobody thinks that.
              So here is what they are saying about --
        they talk about how they were able to fend off
        litigation.
              An admission by the industry that excessive
        smoking is bad for you is an admission of guilt.
              So they are not going to admit.  He says
        here it could open the door to litigation.  So
        they are not going to admit that smoking hurts
11:18:39
11:18:52
11:19:03
11:19:22
11:19:35 4842 anybody.
              You know, the one element of our legal
        defense was that there was no dose-response
        relationship.  It doesn't matter how much you
        smoke, all the additional cigarettes, we know from
        the '89 report that every cigarette the person
        smokes there is a dose-response.  Every cigarette
        does cause harm.
              But here they are saying, no, we're going
        to tell people it's not a dose-response, and we
        can hire whatever expert we want, and they will
        tell the jury whatever we want them to tell them.
              MS. ARNOLD:  Objection, Your Honor,
        improper argument.
              THE COURT:  Overruled.
              MR. PAIGE:  And so this is what they were
        talking about internally.
              Our medical scientists, witnesses will say
        whatever we want them to say.  That's what they
        were -- that's what they talk about internally.
        And that's not what's supposed to happen.  That's
        not what's supposed to happen.
              Let some lawyer look over our shoulder, I
        won't even concede that one person died of the
        disease caused by smoking, I won't admit one
11:19:46
11:19:59
11:20:18
11:20:27
11:20:42 4843 person, one person, let alone 500,000 people a
        year.
              And so they get involved with the CTR, you
        know.  There was a TIRC, and then they changed the
        name to the CTR.  And they start telling people,
        hey, we got this research that's coming out.  It's
        not really smoking.  We know it's not smoking.
        It's a lot -- smoking might be harmful, but it
        could be pollution.  It could be genetics, a lot
        of reasons why people are getting sick nowadays.
        We're learning a lot more about it.
              And so they have these people who they are
        funding, legitimate people, some of them, or some
        of them maybe not, but some people who were
        reputable, they will give them money and tell them
        to publish on other topics so they can claim
        they're affiliated with.
              Hey, look, we're giving money to Harvard.
        We're giving money to Stanford.  We're giving
        money to the University of Florida.
              But internally they are not sharing this
        with these institutions.  Do you think these
        institutions would be affiliated with them if they
        knew what was really going on?
              The CTR, you know, trying to get a buffer,
11:20:58
11:21:14
11:21:25
11:21:36
11:21:45 4844 some public and political attack, a buffer from
        that sort of thing, the fact it's a front and a
        shield.  And then they talk about, you know, the
        tobacco money ain't so dirty anymore.  They were
        able to give their money out to some of these
        institutions who were having problems getting
        funding.
              And around that time -- and this is the
        other -- this is the other sad part.  We don't
        even know everything that went on there because we
        only know so much because they had policies in
        place about destroying reports, throwing things
        away, rewriting reports.  So what we have is good
        knowledge -- thank God we have -- but internally
        they are talking about any important letters or
        documents have to be sent -- please send them
        home, and I will destroy them.  You will not --
        this is Wakeham telling somebody who he's
        providing funding to, "You're not allowed to
        publish anything from any of these findings
        without me approving it."
              So they give people money -- that's Wakeham
        from Philip Morris, that second document.  They
        give them money, and they say, but don't publish
        anything until I tell you it's okay.
11:22:06
11:22:14
11:22:30
11:22:41
11:22:51 4845 This other document here -- that's Philip
        Morris -- Philip Morris document, and he's talking
        about where they are doing studies on nicotine,
        and if the results don't come out like they want
        them to, they will go ahead and bury those
        results.
              And then, finally, they are talking about,
        hey, we'll give some funding, but you can take our
        money, but you can't do any research on related
        smoking to disease -- to cancer or diseases to
        smoking.  And that's what they were doing.
              So they come here, and they tell you look
        how great -- the CTR, if you hear anybody say the
        CTR was good, the CTR was disbanded and the Judge
        told you they were part of the conspiracy.  They
        were not good.  They were not good.  They did
        nothing good.  They actually got told they can't
        do it anymore.  They were disbanded by the
        government, and they were part of the conspiracy
        as a matter of law.
              And then here, what else they did.  This is
        why people like Karl Ahrens, just regular people,
        they didn't have, you know -- and people think --
        you know, you talk to somebody who is addicted to
        a drug or an alcohol, you know, an alcoholic, you
11:23:13
11:23:23
11:23:38
11:23:50
11:24:05 4846 talk to an alcoholic and they will say, hey --
        first they will deny, they will deny they are an
        alcoholic.  And then if you really confront them,
        they will say, hey, it's my life, I'll do what I
        want.
              But people like that with nicotine who
        didn't understand it didn't have a chance, because
        here they are, they have the AMA in their pocket,
        the American Medical Association, they gave $20
        million.  Here they talk about tobacco, state
        congressmen, they have to get them to believe and
        understand that smoking is not a factor in lung
        cancer.
              Then they talk about Gori, this whole thing
        with the Tobacco Working Group, that they were in
        with the Tobacco Working Group, the National
        Cancer Institute was trying to look for a safer
        cigarette.  And the cigarette companies had their
        scientists on the Tobacco Working Group, but they
        couldn't go in the Tobacco Working Group as
        representatives of the cigarette company.  They
        had to go in in an independent capacity for the
        cigarette companies, and they could not admit that
        smoking caused cancer.
              And all along, they were not sharing the
11:24:21
11:24:31
11:24:46
11:25:01
11:25:12 4847 research with the tobacco -- they were not sharing
        the research with the Tobacco Working Group.  And
        Gori, who was the head, was asking them for
        favors.  And they ultimately were giving Gori
        money.  He was crooked.  It's not legitimate.
              You know, those sort of things that
        happened, wherever they happened, you know, where
        normal people are affected by decisions that
        corporations are making and people get affected
        with whatever part of life, it's not right and
        it's not fair, and it should not happen.
              And here they brag about how many
        congressmen --
              MS. ARNOLD:  Objection, improper argument.
              THE COURT:  Rephrase, Mr. Paige.
              MR. PAIGE:  And the last letter says they
        have contacts with Congress which have always been
        good, but now better, a systematic approach on
        Capitol Hill.  We can now count nearly 300
        representatives and 75 senators as grade-A
        contacts, which means that we know them, but more
        importantly, they know us.
              So is that legal to do that?  Yeah, it's
        legal to do that.  Is it okay to do that?
              MS. ARNOLD:  Objection, Your Honor,
11:25:26
11:25:38
11:25:50
11:26:06
11:26:19 4848 improper argument.
              THE COURT:  Approach?
              (Sidebar discussion held:)
              MR. PAIGE:  If I could finish my sentence,
        what I was about to say, Your Honor, is -- I was
        midsentence.
              THE COURT:  Actually, the transcript has
        you at the end of a sentence.  Let's not take
        multiple trips up here.  I want to know what your
        objection is.
              MS. ARNOLD:  I'm sorry to interrupt.  My
        concern is that there's a number of times during
        the statement where Mr. Paige has been talking
        about the morality of the conduct of the
        Defendants in this case.
              This is a civil lawsuit.  The Plaintiff has
        the burden of proof, and it's not appropriate at
        all for him to be saying these are bad acts or
        these are bad people, and they shouldn't be doing
        it, or it might be legal, but it's not okay.
              THE COURT:  Do you agree with that?
              MR. PAIGE:  No.  And what I was going to
        say is -- maybe I should put a period at the end,
        but I was really going to say -- I don't know
        where I was.  I was going to say it's okay to do
11:26:45
11:27:01
11:27:10
11:27:20
11:27:35 4849 that, but when they talk to these senators, they
        need to tell them the truth.  They can't conceal
        what they know.  That's all I was going to say.
              THE COURT:  I don't think the fact that --
        I'm not giving a basis -- I don't think he's
        crossed any lines.  I think to an extent, he's
        entitled to -- the jury is being asked if
        consideration of punitive damages is warranted.
              I'm really not getting your point at all.
        And I called you up here because I -- in case
        there was something, quite frankly, that I was
        missing, but I didn't miss that.  So it's
        overruled.
              (Sidebar concluded.)
              MR. PAIGE:  Okay.  So I have to go back
        where I was.  What I was saying was, if they are
        going to use their contacts in Congress, with the
        Senate, there's nothing illegal about that, that's
        okay, but when you do that, especially when you're
        selling a deadly product, it's highly addictive,
        it would be nice, it would be nice to be honest
        with our government.  And that's what they were
        not doing.
              They were lying and they were concealing
        important information from our government and all
11:27:55
11:28:17
11:28:48
11:29:05
11:29:17 4850 along the way, they were making a lot of money,
        knowing full well the harms that they were
        causing.
              And so this is a -- this is another
        interesting issue in the case is that you have to
        put yourself into the 1970s, 1980s, different than
        where we are today.
              Okay.  Now, we have somebody wants to quit,
        there are very -- you know, I think one of the
        things Dr. Hurt said -- and this is one of the
        problems with -- if somebody has heart disease or
        needs a certain medication, sometimes a doctor
        could find 50 different medications to prescribe
        somebody because of the advancements and the
        understanding of what's been going on.
              With nicotine addiction, the Surgeon
        General didn't even declare nicotine addictive
        until '88.  Now, you know, we have the patch,
        which you heard is not very effective because of
        the way the nicotine gets to the brain.  You have
        the gum, which is the same thing.  We have two
        medications now, only two, Chantix and Zyban.  And
        those medications were actually being talked about
        in the 1970s.
              So think about the delays of how many
11:29:33
11:29:45
11:29:58
11:30:10
11:30:23 4851 people nowadays -- I don't remember which doctor
        it was -- but how many people nowadays are able to
        overcome their addiction to nicotine because of
        prescription medications that are out there today
        and because of the knowledge that doctors have
        today in helping them.
              You know, we talk about motivation.  If
        somebody wasn't motivated enough, they were not
        motivated enough.  Somebody can wake up in the
        morning and be very motivated, say, you know what,
        I'm going to quit today.  And by five o'clock,
        something happens.  That doesn't mean that they
        were not motivated.  You know, then they try
        again, they fail.  And, you know, failure doesn't
        feel good.  Somebody tries a couple times or five
        times and they fail, and they think they can't do
        it.  Some people give up.  Some people keep
        trying.
              But, you know, I would think that most
        people try, they want to quit, they try as hard as
        they can, they keep trying.  And some people are
        successful.  And, you know, 50 percent of people,
        unfortunately, don't succeed.  And that's the sad
        thing.  That is the sadness about it because they
        are real people with real lives with real
11:30:39
11:30:50
11:31:03
11:31:14
11:31:28 4852 families.
              So back in the '70s when all this was going
        on, when the cigarette companies had
        opportunities, you know, the first one is from the
        Tobacco Working Group which they talked about
        being involved with, but internally they are
        talking about "our scientific directors will
        informally try to persuade Gori to eliminate or
        modify proposals such as smoking cessation
        clinics."
              Okay.  So think about that.  I mean,
        really.  They are in the Tobacco Working Group
        with the National Cancer Institute.  Okay.
        National Cancer Institute is a public health
        authority who is trying to help people and save
        lives.
              They infiltrate the National Cancer
        Institute.  They get in there, and now internally
        this guy Gori, who ultimately ends up on their
        payroll later in life, and they say, look --
        internally -- we got to persuade Gori that we have
        to stop with these smoking clinics.  We got to get
        rid of the smoking clinics.
              This is in 1973.  Why would anybody in
        their right mind would try to persuade somebody to
11:31:40
11:31:53
11:32:05
11:32:15
11:32:28 4853 not get involved with smoking cessation clinics
        that can help save lives, especially when you're
        responsible for taking their lives?
              You know, it's one thing if you're going to
        have that product and you're going to sell the
        product, and you know the harm, and you are going
        to be honest with it, and you are going to make
        sure that nobody under the age of 21 gets their
        hands on it, and you decide that's what you want
        to do, and you do that, you're selling a highly
        addictive product that's going to kill half of its
        users, and you get it legalized in the right ways
        and you have it regulated, well, somebody who
        sells a product like that better make sure they
        actually encourage smoking cessation clinics, that
        they help people with medications, that they want
        people to be covered under health insurance.
              They wanted the opposite.  They wanted the
        opposite.  You talk about motivation and choices.
        They didn't want people to have choices.  They
        didn't want them to have smoking clinics for
        people who wanted to try to quit.
              Here is this guy Leo Abood who is getting
        funded, and they say he's fighting clinically an
        antagonist to nicotine.  That's a medication.
11:32:44
11:32:56
11:33:10
11:33:22
11:33:34 4854 That's 20 years, 25 years before there's
        medications.  Think of the great things they could
        have done.  20 years earlier, they could have had
        a medication, and they cut his funding off.  They
        cut his funding off.
              And imagine somebody between 1977 and 2000
        dies of lung cancer or throat cancer or heart
        disease or COPD, and they never had a chance
        because the people who were making the product who
        are lying about it are cutting off funding on
        people who were trying to save lives.
              Here is the DSM.  Dr. Dorce, you know, we
        talked about the DSM.  The DSM is a fine manual.
        I have no problem with it.  It's for people with
        mental disorders.  And it's made many changes over
        the years from the '80s to the '90s to now.
        There's nothing wrong with the DSM.
              But in 1976, if you look at this letter
        here, this 5839, you look at the series of
        letters, what was going on there, they did not
        want tobacco abuse classified in that manual.
        They didn't want it because they knew that people
        could get help.  If it's a mental disorder, and
        they put it in a manual, they didn't want it
        because people would be covered under health
11:33:47
11:34:02
11:34:16
11:34:29
11:34:45 4855 insurance, okay?
              How sad is that?  People could be covered
        under health insurance to help them with a disease
        that could save their life, and they are going to
        try to stop that.
              So they contact this Dr. Proctor, not
        Dr. Proctor that we brought here, another
        Dr. Proctor.  He contacts all of his friends, and
        they make anonymous letters to the DSM.
              And then when Dow Chemical is trying to
        come out with the gum in the early '80s, and what
        went on here was they were giving a lot of money
        to Dow, as you know, for --
              TECHNICIAN PHILIPSON:  Humectant.
              MR. PAIGE:  -- humectant.
              And so Dow is going to come out with the
        gum.  They come out with the gum.  And Dow wants
        to put newsletters in doctors' offices around the
        country, hey, we have a new product.  If you're
        smoking and you want to quit, we want -- now we
        all know about the gum.  In 1984, if we want to
        educate -- doctors want to educate people about
        the gum, we're going to put newsletters in their
        offices.
              No.  No.  Tobacco says, no, no, you're not
11:34:54
11:35:07
11:35:29
11:35:41
11:35:53 4856 going to do that.  And they stopped the
        newsletters, and they stopped Dow from giving the
        newsletters to doctors.  It didn't happen after
        the first issue.
              And so here is more of their statements.
     transcribed as
        follows:)
              SPEAKER:  A California doctor said, as a
        scientist, I find no persuasive evidence that
        cigarette smoking causes lung cancer.
              A New York doctor told Congress, to claim
        there is no sufficient scientific evidence to
        establish that cigarette smoking causes disease,
        it is, in my opinion, unjustified.
              SPEAKER:  Turning a cigarette health
        question into a publicity stunt is an insult to
        serious science.
              SPEAKER:  I cannot point to anything that I
        would consider the cause of cancer of the lung,
        but the behavior of the disease does not support
        the idea of cigarettes being the causal agent.
              SPEAKER:  We believe our product is not
        injurious to health.
              SPEAKER:  A jury has not come in.
              MR. STOSSEL:  It may not be harmful?
11:36:05
11:36:14
11:36:25
11:36:37
11:36:51 4857 You're not convinced?
              SPEAKER:  It may be or may not be, we don't
        know.
              SPEAKER:  Insofar as the correlation
        between lung cancer and cigarette smoking are
        concerned, no one knows.  It may; it may not.  How
        can cigarette smoking be the cause of lung cancer
        if the cause of lung cancer is as yet unknown?  In
        fact, no one knows what causes lung cancer.
              TED KOPPEL:  You say cigarette smoking does
        not cause cancer, yes or no?
              ED HORRIGAN:  It is not known whether
        cigarettes cause cancer.  It has not been causally
        established.
              SPEAKER:  The tobacco industry continues to
        earmark millions of dollars annually on an ongoing
        basis in unrestricted arm's length research to
        answer the very questions raised in the Surgeon
        General's Report.
              SPEAKER:  Do cigarettes cause cancer?
              MR. MERRYMAN:  I don't know if they do or
        not.
              SPEAKER:  I'm not in a position to give you
        it does or does not answer.
              MR. TISCH:  The data that we've been able
11:36:58
11:37:17
11:37:24
11:37:36
11:37:47 4858 to see is all the statistical data that has not
        convinced me that smoking causes death.
              MR. CAMPBELL:  We don't know what causes
        cancer in general right now, so I think that we
        may find out what causes cancer and we may find
        out some relationship which has yet to be proven.
              (The video clip ended.)
              MR. PAIGE:  That's 1994.  Those statements
        are from the '70s to the '90s.  These are people
        who are making these statements, you-all know,
        with the intent that smokers will rely upon them
        to their detriment, meaning they are intending
        people to rely upon it, knowing they will get
        hurt.
              In 1994, they are in front of Congress
        swearing to Congress, who are trying to do
        something about it, who are trying to help people,
        and their documents are still secret at that time
        and they are lying, knowing people are dying,
        knowing that families are being hurt.  And they
        are lying about it, and they are saying we didn't
        know, but Karl Ahrens should have known, because
        he worked with a computer that was a big computer,
        and Xerox gave him a newsletter that he should
        exercise.
11:38:01
11:38:16
11:38:25
11:38:39
11:38:55 4859 You know, I will say this, I have never
        disputed and I will not dispute that Karl Ahrens
        knew at some point that smoking could cause lung
        cancer, okay.
              Probably when he started, he had no idea.
        Later he probably had doubts.  He probably thought
        the filters are helping him, just like everybody
        else.
              And we know that by the '80s -- you know,
        the '70s it bothered his wife with the smoke.
        30 percent of doctors were smoking.
              And in the '80s his kid comes home, Bryan,
        and Bryan comes home, and he's crying to his dad
        and he says, "Dad, I love you.  I love you.  I
        want you to quit.  I don't want anything to happen
        to you."
              And you know what?  I don't deny that at
        that point -- Karl Ahrens at least at that point
        probably knew.  And then he had a struggle with
        addiction, and we'll talk about light cigarettes.
              But -- but it took Karl Ahrens a long time
        to figure out what they were even denying they
        knew in 1994.  In 1994 they were still lying about
        it.
              And so, you know, when we talk about our
11:39:09
11:39:22
11:39:33
11:39:44
11:40:00 4860 conspiracy, our concealment claim, our right to
        punitive damages, you know -- punitive damages, I
        asked you guys in jury selection, every one of
        you, I said, if the evidence supports that they
        should be punished and the evidence supports that
        it would be a good thing to award punitive damages
        against the tobacco companies from doing what they
        do, would you award significant amount of punitive
        damages, and all of you said you would.
              And I submit to you the money for punitive
        damages doesn't go -- I told you guys in jury
        selection.  It does not go to the American Cancer
        Society.  It does not go to charity.  It goes to
        Ina Ahrens.  Okay.  Ina Ahrens.
              This is about -- we're here today seeking
        justice for what's right, what's right in our
        society, a civil system, okay.  Ina Ahrens, all
        she wants is justice.
              And when we started, I'm proud of her for
        being here and bringing this lawsuit and seeking
        the truth for what her family went through.
              But it's not right, and when you -- when I
        get to the punitive damages, we talk about harm to
        others -- because another thing that you may
        think, look, we're showing you videos of youth
11:40:13
11:40:25
11:40:38
11:40:54
11:41:09 4861 marketing in the '70s and the '80s and you may say
        to yourself, why are you showing me a video of
        them targeting teenagers in the '80s?  Okay.
        Right.  That's a fair question.  Why am I showing
        it to you?  Why am I?
              For punitive damages you're allowed to
        consider harm to others if it was similar conduct
        that harmed Karl Ahrens, and we know Karl Ahrens
        started smoking as a teenager.  We know he got
        addicted.  We know that was their business plan.
        Their business plan never changed for decades, and
        that's why we showed you that, because you can
        consider harm to others.
              You can only -- you can award -- you can
        award -- entitlement to punitive damages, you're
        allowed to consider harm to others.  You can only
        award punitive damages for the harm to Karl
        Ahrens, okay?  So when we get there, we're not
        going to ask you to award punitive damages for the
        harm they did to 500,000 people; but, anyway, I'm
        getting a little sidetracked on that.
              So back to where we were.  So we know that
        there was a time in the '80s that Karl Ahrens was
        switching to light cigarettes.  And we know that
        he was trying to quit.  And we know that they were
11:41:25
11:41:38
11:41:49
11:42:01
11:42:22 4862 not helping people, okay.
              It's one thing not to help people.  If
        people are trying to quit, you know, I guess
        somebody might be able to think, hey, you know
        it's their product.  They are trying to make
        money.  They don't have to help anybody to quit if
        they don't want to.
              But they don't have to lie about it either,
        and they don't have to interfere with people's
        rights to quit.
              So internally what they are talking about
        when Karl Ahrens was trying to quit, when he was
        trying to do the right thing, when his son was
        trying to help him, when he did want to be alive,
        when he did wanted to -- you know, where Karl
        Ahrens should be this week?  He should be
        70-years-old, and he should be fitted for a tux
        for his wedding.
              So anyway, that's what they were doing.
              The next one.
              And so here are the advertisements.
              The next one.
              And so here are their documents with Merit.
        You know Merit Ultra Lights.  And so they knew
        people were smoking Merits.  And, you know,
11:42:34
11:42:45
11:42:54
11:43:08
11:43:29 4863 77 percent more free nicotine in Merits.
              You know, people are switching to Merit for
        health reasons, for health reasons.  They know
        that.  They know people are, you know -- look,
        they have documents that talk about educated
        people.  They have documents that talk about less
        educated people.  They have documents talking
        about targeting teenagers.  They are going to
        target whoever they can, okay.
              So they have different cigarettes for
        different people.  And they know, look -- Karl
        Ahrens, he had some marketing background.  He got
        a B minus or B in marketing.  They showed his
        report card.  They bring in a guy from Ohio
        University to show you his report card that he got
        a C plus and a B or a couple Bs in marketing.
              But this -- these people, they know about
        marketing.  So -- and that's why we showed you
        some documents in the '80s.  They started
        marketing to less educated people, but smart
        people smoke.  And they know with smart people --
        look, they are going to put their money where they
        can get their money.
              They can get more less educated people,
        they are going to put their money there.  If they
11:43:48
11:43:59
11:44:13
11:44:30
11:44:38 4864 could tell educated people to go lights, they will
        put their money there.  So that's what they did.
        They tried to intercept people.  Their documents
        talk about interception.  So this is a time that
        Karl Ahrens was trying to quit.
              And so, you know, this is -- again, you
        know, this is -- we can throw numbers out, give
        hundreds of thousands or millions or this and
        that, but this is a real person, a real life, you
        know who, got caught up in their fraud.
              Next.
              Okay.  So this is their document where
        Philip Morris is talking about compensation.  And
        so now you-all -- you know, I doubt that you-all
        knew about compensation before you came here, but
        this is just part of that document that they talk
        about how they would exploit the benefits of
        smoking to the advantage and profitability of our
        company.  Okay.
              Think about that.  People are -- they know
        people are inhaling deeper.  They know that
        there's changes in their cigarette design.  They
        know people are compensating who are going to
        these products, and they talk about -- you read
        that document, and you'll see what they are
11:44:49
11:45:01
11:45:19
11:45:31
11:45:46 4865 talking about, exploiting that for the
        profitability of their company.
              And this is -- we're not in the '50s
        anymore.  This is in 1984.  This is when Karl
        Ahrens was trying to quit and when he was smoking
        light cigarettes.
              And so -- and they knew.  And this is the
        thing we talk about reliance.  You may say to
        yourself today, because it might seem odd.
              You know, somebody who I meet today and I
        say, hey, you know, I'm going to sue the cigarette
        companies.  Sue cigarette companies.  For what?
              When you hear this and you see what people
        actually believed back then, what people actually
        thought back then, you think to yourself how for
        50 years was this allowed to happen?  And then
        this is what real people were saying back then
        through --

              SPEAKER:  I've been reading a lot about it
        in the paper, but I don't know anyone actually who
        has got cancer because of the fact because they
        were a smoker.  I mean, it hasn't been proved in
        black and write.
              SPEAKER:  Well, when they come out and
        really say, well, you're going to get it, I'll
        stop then.  But when they just keep on saying,
        some say you do, some don't, I'll just keep going.
              NARRATOR:  Throughout your tenure with
        America, it was not only American's position but
        your position that cigarettes were not injurious
        to health; is that accurate?
              UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Throughout my
        tenure?
              NARRATOR:  Yes.
              UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Yes.
              NARRATOR:  That's something American
        Tobacco wanted the public to believe; is that
        correct?
              UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Yes.
              NARRATOR:  It's a statement that American
        Tobacco had place great reliance on?
              UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  We issued that
11:46:49
11:46:56
11:47:09
11:47:13
11:47:24 4867 statement, yes.
              NARRATOR:  As far as you're concerned a
        person is justified in relying on that statement.
              UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Yes.
              SPEAKER:  You know they say it causes
        cancer and heart disease.  Do you believe that?
              SPEAKER:  No, I don't.  Not in my heart.  I
        can't believe it.  I look back at it, people say
        who make the cigarettes, and I feel like that the
        one that make the cigarettes should know what they
        doing.
              (The video clip ended.)
              MR. PAIGE:  And then -- is this a video
        now?
              And then so we -- that's why I'm trying to
        take you through decades and decades, and we get
        to 1994, and we know this is what happened again.
     transcribed as
        follows:)
              CONGRESSMAN WYDEN:  Let me begin my
        questioning on the matter of whether or not
        nicotine is addictive.  Let me ask you first, I'd
        like to go down the row, whether each of you
        believes that nicotine is not addictive.  I heard
        virtually all of you touch on it.  Just yes or no.
11:47:33
11:47:47
11:47:56
11:48:06
11:48:18 4868 Do you believe nicotine is not addictive?
              MR. CAMPBELL:  I believe nicotine is not
        addictive, yes.
              CONGRESSMAN WYDEN:  Mr. Johnson.
              MR. JOHNSTON:  Congressman, cigarettes and
        nicotine clearly do not meet the classic
        definitions of addiction.  There is no
        intoxicants --
              CONGRESSMAN WYDEN:  We'll take that as a
        no.  And again, time is short.  If you could
        just -- I think each of you believe nicotine is
        not addictive.  We would just like to have this
        for the record.
              MR. TADDEO:  I don't believe that nicotine
        our products are addictive.
              MR. HORRIGAN:  I believe nicotine is not
        addictive.
              MR. TISCH:  I believe that nicotine is not
        addictive.
              MR. SANDEFUR:  I believe that nicotine is
        not addictive.
              MR. JOHNSTON:  And I too believe that
        nicotine is not addictive.
              (The video clip ended.)
              MR. PAIGE:  And so you think 100 years
11:48:27
11:48:38
11:48:47
11:48:55
11:49:03 4869 before that 140 people in the whole world died,
        and this is where we end up.  And now you know --
        you know how we ended up here.
              And you have to ask yourself the question
        for reliance is the issue -- that's a very long
        instruction for me to read, but there's an
        instruction here about did he rely, and this is an
        important claim for concealment and fraud.
              The issue is whether or not the concealment
        or omission of material information regarding the
        health effects, would it have been important for
        somebody to know that the lights were a fraud,
        would it be important for somebody to know that
        the filters didn't work, would it be important for
        somebody to know they had no intention of removing
        the dangerous ingredients, would it be important
        for somebody to know there was never any doubt or
        confusion at all.
              Did they omit material information that was
        a legal cause that he reasonably relied to his
        detriment -- okay -- was a legal cause of his lung
        cancer because Mr. Ahrens reasonably relied to his
        detriment that Philip Morris and/or R.J. Reynolds
        would not conceal or omit the disclosure of
        material information.
11:49:18
11:49:35
11:49:45
11:49:57
11:50:16 4870 He would not expect a cigarette company, at
        least back then -- I mean, people may think
        differently -- you would not expect a product
        manufacturer to lie and conceal important
        information that they knew that can cause you to
        die.
              Material information is such that it would
        be important to him that he would not have acted
        as he did but for the concealment.
              And then it talks about it can act in the
        same concurring cause.  It doesn't have to be the
        only cause.  The concealment doesn't have to act
        alone because, you know, you're always going to
        hear this argument about people made choices.
              Choice is a two-way street, right.  Choice
        is a two-way street.  And there's a difference
        between a choice of somebody who is addicted to a
        drug, who is trying to do the best thing they can
        when you compare it to the choice of a corporate
        greed who are not trying to do the best thing for
        anybody but themselves.
              So this is the material information that
        was concealed.  You know, there was never any
        controversy.  They didn't tell anybody about all
        the different carcinogens or that people who were
11:50:29
11:50:38
11:50:50
11:51:02
11:51:14 4871 smoking had a 50 percent chance of dying.  You
        know, most smokers don't know that.
              I think Dr. Hurt said 60 percent, 50 to
        60 percent.  Most people.  And Dr. Dorce said
        people in their 20s and 30s, they are not thinking
        about what's going to happen when I'm 40 or 50.
              And so that's the type of stuff they didn't
        want people to know about.  They studied marketing
        and targeted teenager.  They knew all along
        nicotine was highly addictive as cocaine and
        heroin.  They manipulated nicotine with pH levels.
              They tell you it had low nicotine.  They
        add ammonia to jump the nicotine back up.  And
        they didn't tell anybody about the filters or
        lights.
              How would people know those things?  You
        probably didn't know those things.  They knew
        those things for 50 years.
              And so the question is for the fraud, was
        the concealment of material information from R.J.
        Reynolds concerning the health effects or
        addictive nature a legal cause.  And the same
        thing for Philip Morris.
              And I submit to you the overwhelming
        evidence is it has to be, yes.
11:51:26
11:51:40
11:51:54
11:52:04
11:52:15 4872 And the same with the conspiracy, their
        agreement.  Again, remember, had one person just
        come forward and tell the truth, anybody, anybody.
        It's amazing how all the different people who go
        on TV and say the same thing.  But, you know, have
        the conspiracy, was that a problem, does that
        contribute to his death.
              And so the next question, which again is
        important, is whether or not punitive damages --
        do you find by clear and convincing evidence that
        punitive damages are warranted against Philip
        Morris and R.J. Reynolds.
              And so this is what, when you look at
        punitive damages, are warranted as punishment.
        You know, what are punitive damages for, right,
        because you get to punish a corporation -- you
        don't punish somebody for no reason, right.
              So punitive damages are to punish somebody
        who did something really horrible, right, and
        that's why people get punished.
              And remember, corporations are no different
        than people, right.  That's a jury instruction.
        You want to be treated like a person, you have
        to --
              MS. ARNOLD:  Objection, improper argument.
11:52:29
11:52:50
11:53:06
11:53:20
11:53:29 4873 THE COURT:  Sustained.
              MR. PAIGE:  And so punitive damages are
        applicable equally to people and the corporations.
        They both have to act according to laws and civil
        laws and do the right thing.
              And so punitive damages are warranted if
        you find by clear and convincing evidence -- if
        you can't consider the Engle findings, that's one
        of the things you may have trouble finding, you
        may ask yourself, why did I have to sit through --
        sometimes we had to see all this stuff, and
        there's already a finding of conspiracy.
              But for punitive damages, you have to rely
        on the evidence that we gave you, and I think we
        showed you enough evidence, a lot of evidence, not
        as much as the Engle jury, but you've seen a good
        deal about the conspiracy and concealment, more
        than most people know about.
              And so you'd have to find -- any one of
        these.  Are there four or five?
              MR. SALES:  Four.
              MR. PAIGE:  That each Defendants' conduct,
        so against Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds, the
        Defendants' conduct caused the lung cancer, it was
        so gross and flagrant to show a reckless disregard
11:53:48
11:54:00
11:54:10
11:54:21
11:54:35 4874 for human life.
              And I submit to you there's no -- it
        couldn't be any more clear that they didn't care
        about human life.  If you look through all their
        memos and see everything they did, you'll see
        there was no regard, zero regard for human life.
              The next way that punitive damages -- you
        know, punitive damages are punish, but also to
        deter other corporations who look at this and say,
        hey, look what they did, look what's going to
        happen, we'll be held accountable for our actions
        by members of our society, members of our society
        will get to judge us and see if this is acceptable
        or not.
              Ordinary people, regular people will come
        in here and say, is this okay what we did, are we
        going to tolerate this, or are we going to try to
        tell people and tell corporations and deter others
        that, no, this is not right, this was not good,
        this is bad, and you're not going to do that.
              Each Defendant's conduct showed an entire
        lack of care that they must have been consciously
        indifferent to the consequences, which could not
        be any clearer.  They never cared about the
        consequences.  They cared about -- they cared
11:54:45
11:54:57
11:55:08
11:55:23
11:55:35 4875 about the money they were going to make, but they
        didn't care about the harm at all, or that each
        Defendant showed a reckless disregard for the
        safety or welfare or that they showed a reckless
        indifference to the rights of others.
              And I submit to you -- you only have to
        find one of them -- every one of them is
        applicable to what they did.  Every single one of
        them.
              And so these are some of the people.  And
        you look at them and you think, you know, why --
        why did they do this.  You know, why would they do
        what they did.  Why did they conceal what they
        did.  You know, they are grown men.  And I think
        we all know what it was about, and we all know
        what they were indifferent about, and what they
        didn't care about and what they did care about.
              And so when we get to punitive damages, for
        entitlement to punitive damages, when you look at
        what they did that was reckless and disregard the
        rights of others and why they should be punished
        and what they did, you know all along that the
        nicotine with the fraud they talk about
        internally, this is an R.J. Reynolds document, "we
        have played down the role of nicotine," right,
11:55:48
11:55:55
11:56:10
11:56:28
11:56:41 4876 hence, the non-smoker, people who don't smoke,
        people who don't smoke, they don't understand,
        they don't know what nicotine is about.
              So we have to convince a non-smoker --
        you're not going to convince an adult to smoke,
        right?  I'm not going to convince a grown adult to
        smoke, so what am I going to do?  I'm going to
        make money.  We'll convince teenagers whose brains
        aren't fully formed, whose frontal lobes aren't
        fully formed -- is an 18-year-old an adult under
        our law?  Yes.
              But 18-year-olds, why would they want to
        market and target young kids who are leaving for
        college, away from home for the first time, young
        men who are going away to the military to leave
        their homes for the first time, why do they want
        to target them so badly?  Why not just target
        30-year-olds or 40-year-olds?  Because they know
        they are more susceptible, and they can convince
        them with wholly irrational reasons why they
        should try smoking, in the hope they will discover
        what it will be with the real satisfaction, which
        is nicotine.
              There's a document in there that I didn't
        talk about in this, but it's in evidence, where it
11:56:55
11:57:08
11:57:18
11:57:32
11:57:41 4877 talks about targeting the young adult smokers, and
        they talk about the military and why the military
        is so susceptible.
              And one of the things they talk about is
        it's good because there's boredom, they are bored
        over there.  So they put the cigarettes in the
        rations -- again, I was not in the military, but
        from what I understand, there's some times if you
        don't do -- you know, if you smoke, you don't have
        to do the push-ups or something, so you get more
        breaks or whatever it is.
              But they have their reasons why they target
        less educated, more educated, teenagers, college
        students, military, young military, and they do it
        for a reason and they do it not with education,
        not with telling people.  You know they don't go
        and tell people, hey, we're going -- you're going
        to smoke, and you're going to become a drug
        addict, you'll become addicted to a drug and you
        may think later it's about this or that.  No, they
        convinced them with irrational reasons, once they
        are hooked, they are an addict, and that's a great
        thing, that's a great thing for them.
              Go on.  And so this is from the '89 SG
        report.  It says, "If the adult rate of smoking
11:57:53
11:58:06
11:58:21
11:58:37
11:58:52 4878 were to continue at the present level, the impact
        of smoking on the future health and welfare of
        today's children would be enormous.  Research has
        shown that one-fourth or more of all regular
        smokers die of a smoking-related disease.  If 20
        million of the 70 million children now living in
        the United States smoke cigarettes as adults, then
        at least 5 million of them will die of
        smoking-related diseases.  This figure should
        alarm anyone who is concerned with the future of
        today's children."
              And we know that it is alarming and it
        should concern anybody, everybody, and we know who
        it did not concern and it never concerned.
              And so this is a video.
     transcribed as
        follows:)
              MR. STOSSEL:  80 percent of all smokers
        started before they were 21.
              SPEAKER:  Cigarette manufacturers are not
        interested in obtaining new business from
        teenagers in our society.
              MR. STOSSEL:  How can you stay in business
        if you can't hook the kids?
              SPEAKER:  We've been in business very well,
11:59:08
11:59:22
11:59:32
11:59:44
11:59:55 4879 thank you, for some time now, without attempting
        to hook kids.  We do everything possible to
        discourage teenage smoking.
              MR. STOSSEL:  They are passing out free
        Camels.  Tobacco companies have been doing a lot
        of this lately.  Their code says, we shall not
        give cigarettes away in any public place within
        two blocks of any center of youth activity, and
        here they are passing them out in front of a David
        Bowie concert.  Lots of kids here.  Cigarettes
        were also passed out at concerts given by the
        Talking Heads and the Animals.
              You pass out free cigarettes at these
        concerts?  I don't see you passing out free
        cigarettes at Frank Sinatra concerts.
              SPEAKER:  There are many, many adults at
        those concerts.
              MR. STOSSEL:  The concerts says 40 to 60
        percent of the audience is under 21.  The tobacco
        code also says, don't give cigarettes to anyone
        under 21.  We asked a 16-year-old to try to get
        some.
              SPEAKER:  I'd like regular.  Thank you.
              I just went up and asked for cigarettes,
        and they didn't ask me for any ID or anything, so
12:00:08
12:00:22
12:00:35
12:00:46
12:01:00 4880 I just got it and walked away.
              MR. STOSSEL:  This videotape made last
        winter by the Chicago Lung Association shows young
        people being given Bright cigarettes.
        Sixteen-year-old Joe was given a pack.  Seven of
        nine young people who asked for cigarettes got
        them.
              The Chicago Lung Association sent people
        out.  Kids got them.
              MS. BROWDER:  I cannot address that.  I can
        tell you what the sampling code is for cigarette
        manufacturers, and the sampling companies are
        sworn to adhere by that code.
              MR. STOSSEL:  But they don't obey.
              MS. BROWDER:  They are supposed to obey it.
              MR. STOSSEL:  Kids see the billboards all
        the time.  Tobacco companies spend so much money
        on advertising that nearly every other billboard
        in America promotes cigarettes.
              MS. BROWDER:  I think the cigarette
        manufacturers have the right to advertise their
        product.  I think they have the right to sponsor a
        variety of events, as they do.  I don't think it's
        illegal, so why not.
              (The video clip ended.)
12:01:15
12:01:25
12:01:37
12:01:47
12:02:00 4881 MR. PAIGE:  And so we go back in time, what
        they are doing there they have done for a long
        time.  And so here is from when Karl Ahrens was a
        kid.  And here is the point again when I showed
        the document earlier from the Johnny Roventini
        from the Marlboro, the Philip Morris -- "Call for
        Philip Morris."
              And it says, hey, we want to get in the
        mind of them when they are children because it
        will carry on with them for a long time.  And
        that's the same thing with the candy cigarettes.
        They are giving candy cigarettes or not objecting
        to candy cigarettes.  I don't think it's their
        intent to get a 5-year-old, a 6-year-old, a
        7-year-old to smoke back then.  I don't think that
        would happen anymore.  But -- but that was the
        world that these kids were growing up in.
              So if you were in the '40s or the '50s and
        you were growing up, or the '60s, and kids were
        smoking candy cigarettes and cartoons were being
        used to advertise cigarettes or Santa Claus was
        being used to advertise cigarettes.  You know,
        that was the world that people grew up in.
              So whether they started experimenting at 16
        and 17 and became a regular smoker at 18, that's
12:02:13
12:02:27
12:02:40
12:02:52
12:03:06 4882 what they knew would happen.
              And it continued into the '60s.  You know,
        the '60s, they were -- schoolkids were writing
        letters to the tobacco companies asking, does your
        product hurt people.  You know, maybe some of
        those kids were concerned for their own parents.
        And they would write back to the schoolkids and
        say, no, no, it doesn't, it's not been proven.
        They'd give them information.  These are documents
        where they knew and they were -- considered them
        to be potential new smokers.
              We went on to the '70s.  Think about this,
        they are talking about interviewing kids at
        beaches.  But the other one, this is an
        interesting document because when you're a
        corporation and you're trying to look at problems,
        you know, hey, I'm a company, I want to see how I
        can increase profits and what are the problems
        that are facing my industry, my company.  And in
        that document to the right, they are looking at
        future problems and they consider, think about
        that, increasing educational programs to prevent
        young smokers from taking -- young non-smokers
        from taking up the practice of smoking.
              And the people who are writing that for the
12:03:20
12:03:34
12:03:47
12:04:00
12:04:14 4883 industry considered that to be a problem, a
        problem, that kids would have a right to be
        educated about what was really going on, about
        what was really the truth.
              And that's what -- that's the
        reprehensibility of their conduct.  That's why
        companies should not be able to do that.  And
        people should know if you're going to do that, if
        you're going to really not protect -- you're not
        going to protect the kids but you're going to go
        hurt the kids, that's why punishment is warranted
        and that's why other corporations should be
        deterred.
              And they go on, this is both retrospective,
        you're looking back, teenagers, it's all about the
        teenagers, young adult smokers, they call them
        young adults.  But they are talking, you know, 12
        percent; by 18, 68 percent.  And without them,
        without the young teenagers, and they put it in --
        kind of poetically, "just as a population which
        does not give birth will eventually dwindle."
              And that's what they consider the teenagers
        to be.  If they can't give birth, if they can't
        have the teenagers, then they are going to dwindle
        and they are going to lose money.  And all -- most
12:04:26
12:04:39
12:04:52
12:05:10
12:05:24 4884 people with -- most people -- you know, Karl
        Ahrens was an intelligent man.  Most intelligent
        people would think that would be a good thing not
        to have young people starting to smoke so they can
        grow up to be addicted or grow up to die a
        horrible death.
              And then with the pH levels, you know, this
        was another big thing for them.  You know, how are
        we going to go ahead and keep the pH levels up?
        What is the optimum composition of cigarette
        smoke?  And it talks about, you know, the amount
        of nicotine is not being obtained by accident, you
        know, how low can we go, how low can we go.  We
        have to determine the minimum level that will
        allow continued smoking that will keep people
        smoking.
              So the sad thing about this is while they
        were doing this internally, they were lying to
        Congress and saying it wasn't even addicting.  So
        they were telling people, hey, it's a habit,
        people can do with it as they want to.  They don't
        have to do if they don't want to.  It's a free
        choice.  It's a habit.
              But internally they know darn well this is
        not a habit -- for some people, you have a light
12:05:42
12:05:55
12:06:12
12:06:23
12:06:34 4885 smoker, again they call them chippers, people who
        smoke a few cigarettes here and there.  Some
        people might do that.  But people -- when you're
        smoking, 20, 30, 40 cigarettes a day and you get
        200, 300, 400 doses of nicotine a day, they want
        to make sure you're going to get the right amount
        of nicotine to keep you coming back for more.
        Because as long as you keep coming back for more,
        they are going to keep making more.
              And then this is Lorillard where they talk
        about their program to augment -- nicotine
        augmentation program.  And they talk about free
        nicotine and, you know, the document -- "generally
        agree that this kind of small amount of free
        nicotine is more desirable than a large amount of
        bound nicotine."  They talk about Dr. Spears in
        there.
              And so, you know, that's their whole deal.
        They are going to add ammonia, they are going to
        add diammonium phosphate.  They will do whatever
        they can to have the best amount of freebase, the
        free nicotine so you'll get the biggest kick.  And
        all along, they will tell you it has a low amount
        of nicotine.
              And so these are more documents about that,
12:06:48
12:07:02
12:07:20
12:07:32
12:07:42 4886 that the pH increase is above 6, "the nicotine
        occurs in a free form which is volatile, rapidly
        absorbed by the smoker and believed to be
        instantly perceived as a nicotine kick."
              The goal, "determine the minimum level of
        nicotine that will allow continued smoking."  And
        what does ammonia do?  "Ammonia liberates free
        nicotine, which increases the impact and
        satisfaction."
              So, you know, that's stuff people should be
        entitled to know about.  Smokers should know if
        they are adding diammonium phosphate, ammonia to
        their cigarettes to get the right nicotine kick,
        especially when they are telling them it's a low
        nicotine level.
              A low nicotine level doesn't mean anything
        as long as they are adding the chemicals to give
        it the bigger kick.
              Why did they do this?  This is why punitive
        damages, when you look for it, look about it, why
        are punitive damages warranted, for more money,
        our basic position is this is what they knew all
        along.  And this is why, you know, back in 1968
        they were going to be subject -- there's no
        controversy, and we're going to be subject to a
12:07:59
12:08:12
12:08:24
12:08:32
12:08:45 4887 finding that we're making false and misleading
        statements to promote the sale of cigarettes.
        They knew it all along, they knew they were doing
        it for money, they knew people were dying, they
        had no compassion or anything for anybody who was
        being harmed.  And they did it on purpose.  It was
        not a mistake.  It wasn't just a foolish statement
        that a couple people made.  It was a conspiracy
        that went on for 50 years.
              And so we talked about this, why punitive
        damages are warranted and why you can consider
        harms to others.  We spoke about that.
              And it has to be by clear and convincing
        evidence.  That's different for the class member.
        It has to be the greater weight of the evidence
        and more likely than not to be a class member.
              For the other claims, the conspiracy, the
        concealment it is to be more likely than not.
              Punitive damages, because, you know, they
        are serious, it's important, the law provides that
        it has to be by clear and convincing evidence.
              You have to really clearly -- the evidence
        has to be clear that what they did warrants
        punishment and deterrence to others, and I submit
        it couldn't be any more clear.
12:08:55
12:09:10
12:09:22
12:09:35
12:09:49 4888 And so we would submit that the checks for
        both of those should be yes.
              And so lastly -- I'm on my homestretch.  I
        said this yesterday.  But I really am.  I get
        hungry at 12:00.  So I'll have to eat soon.
              I'll take you through the last part of the
        case, which is compensatory damages.  And so one
        of the things that we asked for in this case, in a
        civil case there's no restoration.  Okay.  The law
        doesn't provide that they restore all the harm
        that they have done.  It's impossible.
              So the civil justice system provides for
        compensation, that you have to compensate for pain
        and suffering, for mental anguish, for what you
        did to other people.
              And obviously if restoration was available,
        Ina would be the happiest person in the world.
        She's lonely.  She doesn't want to be alone.  But
        that's the reality she lives with.
              So the law provides when you hurt people
        and when you disregard other people and they
        suffer alone for 20, 30 years, justice provides
        for fair compensation, right?  Total compensation
        is total justice.
              And this is -- you know, she -- you know,
12:10:19
12:10:33
12:10:46
12:10:56
12:11:10 4889 Ina had a tough life.  She, you know, grew up in
        an attic, and she met her husband, had a future
        with him, loved him.  And, you know, he was a real
        person.  You know, he was a good father.  He was a
        good husband.  He was a good father to Bryan, you
        know, and he was a real person.
              And when you think about that he died when
        he was 57 and now he should be about 77 and still
        have time with his family, to meet his grandkids,
        and go to his kids' weddings.  He missed all that,
        and missed that with them as well.
              So what amount is fair compensation, right?
              So what I submit to you is you have to do
        it differently for Bryan and for Ina.  So you have
        to decide what's the fair compensation for Bryan
        Ahrens -- I'm going to do Bryan first.
              So for Bryan, you know, it's his father,
        and they had a good relationship, and he loved his
        father.  And his father died when he was 23 years
        old, when his father was 57.
              And so what is fair compensation for the
        past and for the future, because it's not just for
        what he's been through, but what he's missed for
        the future, and I would submit to you, you know,
        there's no significant -- no more significant loss
12:11:29
12:11:46
12:12:01
12:12:19
12:12:34 4890 than the loss of a loved one, right.  It's a
        significant loss.  The compensation I think y'all
        would agree would have to be significant.
              So for Bryan -- this is what I'm
        suggesting -- and it could be more; it could be
        less.  It's totally up to the six -- the eight of
        you.
              And I would say this, that when you go back
        in the jury room, it's not just one person, you
        know, everybody has a voice back there and
        everybody has to be heard and everybody has to
        talk and everybody has to have their opinions
        heard and considered, you know, and I think that's
        important.
              But for fair compensation, for Bryan for
        the loss of his father, his real father in his
        real life, we would submit to you $2.5 million for
        Bryan.
              And for Ina I would submit it would be far
        more substantial.  You know, she could use her
        husband.  She could have used him for the past
        20 years.  And so I would submit $10 million for
        Ina would be fair and reasonable compensation for
        what they did.
              And so that's what we submit.  Again,
12:12:45
12:12:55
12:13:05
12:13:20
12:13:40 4891 that's a suggestion for you all to consider.
              And in closing, and I'm done, I would just
        say that -- thank you again for your time.  I know
        it was a long today, and I appreciate your
        attention and your consideration on behalf of Ina
        and Bryan.  I really truly do.  And I'm going to
        sit down now.
              And then they are going to have an
        opportunity to talk, Mr. Carter is going to speak,
        then Mr. Kaczynski and then Ms. Arnold.  So I know
        that you-all will listen to them.  And the only
        thing I would ask you to do is just remember that
        the law provides me to go last.  I'll do my best
        to keep it short when I go at the end, and we'll
        be able to respond to what they say to you.  And I
        thank you-all very much for your time.


                  CLOSING REBUTTAL
          MR. PAIGE:  So I know you guys have had a
     long day, the last thing -- and I know that
     it's tough -- tough place to be right now.
     Everybody wants to go home and I know you guys
     probably know the evidence as well as you know
     it, right.
          So what I do have, I wrote it down, and
     you waited a long time to be here, and you all
     have been here a long time, I do have something
     to say in response to what they said.  I'm not 5076
     going to waste your time with responding to
     every single thing, but I do have to respond to
     some of the things they said that I think need
     responding to.  So I hope you will be patient
     with me and allow me to do that.
          You know, sitting here and listening to
     this stuff, you know, it's tough.  It's tough
     to listen to that.  And Mr. Kaczynski said, I
     think he said at one point, you know, before he
     was doing this, I guess, you were in the
     military, right?
          MR. KACZYNSKI:  Uh-huh.
          MR. PAIGE:  Yeah.  And, you know, before I
     did this, when I put myself through law school,
     I worked as a roofer and I was the kettle man
     on the roofing crew.  So to do this now, to be
     here in front of you guys on such an important
     issue, you know, it's -- it's amazing.  And
     sometimes I sit there and I listen to this, and
     I say, boy, oh boy, it would be a lot easier to
     be back on the roof.  And just have some peace
     and quiet and be left alone.
          But I do think that this work is
     important.  And I think the truth is important.
     And I think that what they said and how they 5077
     said it, I could respond to almost everything
     they said.
          The first thing, and Mr. Carter said, and
     again, I know Mr. Carter, he is a nice man.  I
     have no problems with him.  But when he said
     that I said that I admitted partial
     responsibility, it was like a ball fake, or
     that I was trying to fake something.  You know,
     I take issue with that.  Because, you know,
     when I first started doing this, as I told you,
     and I met -- I remember I met people and I
     would tell them this, and we'd talk about it,
     and I do think it's important.  Even though Ina
     did not think that her husband bears any
     responsibility, because she lived with him and
     she loved him, I do think it's important that
     we do admit partial responsibility because it's
     probably the truth, right?
          And so for me to come in here, and tell
     you, look you in the eyes and say he bears no
     responsibility, it's all their fault.  I
     couldn't do that with a straight face.  I would
     not be able to.
          So if you think that it was some sort of
     ball fake or some sort of a lawyering, I assure 5078
     you it was not.
          And so I want to respond to some of the
     things that they said, and again -- and so, you
     know, when I listen to what they told you, I
     wish I could put where you can't see the other
     side, because we have a divider there, and it's
     what they told you, and so I wish you couldn't
     see the other side right now the way I did
     this, but you can, so you already know the
     punchline on other side -- no, it's okay.  To
     each of them, but I'll go through them quick,
     I'm not going to waste a lot of your time.  I
     may take a little time, I don't want to tell
     you how many pages that is, that's not the only
     page, so ...
          But -- because you probably saw me over
     there, add this, add that.
          So, you know, Dr. Dorce, she came here and
     they asked her, the 20 cases, how many people
     did you say were addicted, and she said three.
     She's 15 percent.  Which doesn't make sense
     because when you think about it, we know 50 to
     80 percent, 90 percent of regular smokers, pack
     a day or more, are addicted to nicotine.
          She said 15.  So when Mr. Carter stood up 5079
     here, he said, oh, Dr. Dorce said three people
     were addicted; Dr. Hurt said none.  But what
     Mr. Carter didn't tell you, in all due respect
     to Mr. Carter, you probably know this, that
     every time Dr. Dorce testifies, she always says
     that addiction was not the cause of a disease
     or the death or an illness in a lawsuit because
     she knows that's the issue.  Okay.  She knows
     that's a crucial issue in the case.  That's
     what we've been talking about.
          And it's not whether or not addiction is
     the only cause.  It's not whether or not
     addiction is -- you know, Dr. Dorce even said,
     people who are addicted suffer complications.
     So, but for the addiction this is what happens.
     People do get sick.
          You know, they said, oh, we may have said
     some bad things.  They do that, they stand here
     and say, oh, there's some things that they
     said, people -- that we wouldn't say those type
     of things now, and it's kind of, you know, to
     ingratiate, you know, to say, hey, we don't
     really think good about them.  But if they
     don't want to be responsible, they don't have
     to be responsible.  It's my burden of proof. 5080
          But when they say that to you, hey,
     there's some bad things that they said.  They
     don't think -- Mr. Kaczynski made it very
     clear -- he does not think, and he's entitled,
     he doesn't think they are responsible for
     anything they said, nothing they said.  And I
     ask you to think to yourself, because you have
     to think when they are talking, you know, do
     you really think that it would be any
     different, if it was a different smoker?  Do
     you really think if Mr. Ahrens did not quit,
     they would have said, oh, he could have quit.
          And if Mr. Ahrens would have quit after
     two times, they would have said, oh, look how
     easy it was for him to quit.  If Mr. Ahrens
     would have relapsed after he quit, they would
     say, oh, look at him, he chose to go back.
          You can't win with them.  You can't win
     with them.
          So --
          MS. ARNOLD:  Objection, Your Honor,
     improper argument.
          THE COURT:  Overruled.
          MR. PAIGE:  You know, so when they tell
     you he quit.  So for Mr. Ahrens, you know, this 5081
     is Mr. Ahrens' case, he quit so he can't be a
     class member because he quit.  Think to
     yourself, who do you think they think is a
     class member?
          MS. ARNOLD:  Objection, Your Honor,
     improper argument.
          THE COURT:  Overruled.
          MR. PAIGE:  And so, you know, that's why
     when they say use your common sense, you all --
     you know, I know you'll use your common sense.
     So use your common sense and think, who do you
     think that Mr. Kaczynski, Mr. Carter, and
     Ms. Arnold, who do you think that they think is
     a class member?
          MR. KACZYNSKI:  Objection, Your Honor,
     personal.
          THE COURT:  Approach.
          (Sidebar discussion held:)
          THE COURT:  The problem is everybody
     objected.  I think and you think, which is
     not -- is improper terminology in the first
     place, but let's talk about what they are
     condemn, what they are arguing for and not what
     does he think, what does she think.  I didn't
     get your -- what -- is that -- that's not what 5082
     you were -- tried to object to.
          MS. ARNOLD:  Your Honor, his comments were
     disparaging us in this lawsuit and that's --
          THE COURT:  It's rebuttal.  He is supposed
     to disparage your argument.  That's the --
          MS. ARNOLD:  Disparaging us for defending
     ourselves in this case and criticizing us --
          MR. SALES:  This all came from the
     Defense.
          MS. ARNOLD:  Criticizing us and arguing
     that Mr. Ahrens was not a member of the class
     when it's their burden of proof.
          THE COURT:  I don't consider that improper
     argument.
          But, you know, he is off on references to
     people -- refer to their arguments, not
     their --
          MR. PAIGE:  Okay.  I got it.
          THE COURT:  -- not their personal stuff.
          Wait a minute.  While we are down here,
     my -- this thing is down, I'm having trouble
     hearing him.  Can you get me --
          (Sidebar concluded.)
          MR. PAIGE:  So, one -- the next thing
     Mr. Kaczynski showed you were those polls.  And 5083
     he said, hey, who was going to believe the
     tobacco companies, look how low the public
     opinion is for the tobacco company, only
     5 percent of the people believe us.
          And that's the whole point of the
     conspiracy.  You know, that was the whole
     point.  That's why they gave $20 million to the
     AMA.  The AMA was with them for a long time.  I
     don't remember the years, I'm not going to say
     it.
          That's why they started the TIRC.  They
     went through the CTR.  And they had all those
     doctors that you could see on TV who are saying
     things that nobody knows if they are affiliated
     with the tobacco companies.  So that's why when
     they look at those polls, what Mr. Kaczynski in
     his argument failed -- what wasn't said was
     that 47 to 64 percent of the people believed
     the AMA, who they were with, and you'll see the
     documents in evidence that they did give them a
     lot of money and they finally distanced
     themselves from them.  In what year?
          MR. SALES:  '76.
          MR. PAIGE:  In the '70s.
          Also, you will see that people believe 5084
     independent laboratories.  That's why all these
     doctors were saying they were independent.
     They didn't know.  That's why the TIRC -- the
     CTR was disbanded by the government.  They were
     forced to disband.  And so when they come here
     and tell you how good of research they were
     doing, the CTR and the TI were co-conspirators.
     That's not me talking.  I mean, that is a fact.
     That is a fact in history.  That is a true
     fact.
          Mr. Carter said, when he went to Moffitt,
     there was no diagnosis of addiction in the
     medical records.  So how could he be addicted?
     How could Karl Ahrens be addicted when no
     doctor at Moffitt ever diagnosed him with
     nicotine addiction, right?
          And that's why you need to think, does
     that make sense?  Does that argument really
     make sense when he didn't go to Moffitt until
     five years after he quit smoking?  Who's going
     to diagnose him with nicotine addiction?  What
     does that mean?  They say that I say things to
     try to get you, you know, passionate.  I am
     passionate about this.
          And so -- and the things that Ms. Arnold 5085
     talked about at end, all that stuff about other
     people, it is relevant for punitive damages
     because the law, not that I wrote, but that the
     law in Florida is that you as jurors can
     consider harm to others when you're considering
     reprehensibility, how reprehensible is their
     conduct, is the law in the state of Florida
     that you shall consider the reprehensibility of
     their conduct towards others when you determine
     whether or not punitive damages shall be
     awarded, and then, if and then you decide it's
     warranted, you only punish for the harm to Karl
     Ahrens.  That's the law.  So if I didn't tell
     you about the harm to others, I would not be
     doing my job.
          You know, he told you that Karl was
     asymptomatic when he went to Moffitt.  Look at
     the medical records.  He presented with
     fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath,
     that's what he had.  You know, no doctor --
     there's not one medical record where any doctor
     was puzzled and said this might not be lung
     cancer.
          He told you that Mr. Carter said that he
     told his doctors that he quit seven, eight, 5086
     nine years ago.  So when he went to Moffitt in
     1996, the doctors asked him, when did you quit
     smoking?
          And you'll see some of the records say
     '87, some say '88, some say '89.  You know,
     think about it.  In 1996, so it's 2016, if
     somebody asked somebody about something that
     happened, when did you go to this doctor, when
     did you do this, oh, it's five years ago, it's
     eight years ago, somebody could be off a couple
     years.
          But what they didn't tell you is that they
     know, and we read to you the question for
     admissions, that Philip Morris has in their own
     files today a survey that was filled out by
     Karl Ahrens in 1990 saying that he was a
     current smoker of Merit cigarettes.
          So why all the debate about 1988?  Why
     would we even talk about that?  You know, it's
     not even -- it's not a fact.  The fact is when
     Karl Ahrens was alive and when he was smoking,
     not retrospectively, the day he was smoking in
     1990, he filled out a survey that they had in
     their files.  And they know that.
          They said that he didn't have primary lung 5087
     cancer.  I mean, he had a single solid mass,
     pleural effusion, you know -- I'm going to
     estimate the numbers, it was 90, 95 percent of
     pleural effusions are caused by breast cancer
     or lung cancer.
          He had the mediastinal lymph nodes, that
     was also about 90, 95 percent from lung cancer.
     It was a big, large one mass, which is classic
     lung cancer.
          And then he had the carcinomatous
     meningitis that comes from lung cancer.  And,
     in fact, Dr. Ruckdeschel made that diagnosis
     before they even got the pathology back, so
     there wasn't even a doubt among any of the
     doctors.
          And then they said, well, he didn't do any
     staining to find out.  You know, now, 20 years
     later, we are in court where we have to prove
     our case by more likely than not, what did more
     likely than not happen, and they are saying,
     well, you didn't do an autopsy.  Should have
     done an autopsy.  Should have done an autopsy.
     Then we would know 100 percent.
          Well, those doctors, actually,
     Dr. Ruckdeschel said he was 100 percent 5088
     certain.  Why would he do stains to rule out
     colon cancer, kidney cancer, esophageal cancer,
     breast cancer, things that every doctor that
     devoted their life to treating people and
     helping people, saving their lives, not one
     doctor thought they should do that.  Nobody,
     had a doubt, nobody in the world had a doubt
     until we got here.
          They keep talking about the 60 million
     Americans who quit.  Dr. Dorce admitted that
     number, it's a number, okay, of that number we
     know there's a high relapse rate.  We know that
     8.5 million Americans are living with
     smoking-related diseases.  We know that 500,000
     Americans die every year and we know for a fact
     that 30 million Americans have died.  Those are
     real numbers.
          So the 60 million, that's people who
     smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, those
     are people who relapse, who started smoking
     later, those are people who got sick.
          The real numbers, the real victims, are
     the 30 million, 30 million Americans, 500,000 a
     year.  Think about it.  If you saw on the news
     that something happened to 1,000 people, God 5089
     forbid if something happened today and that was
     on the news, we'd read about it for a month.
     This happens every day, decade after decade,
     and nobody's reading about it.  Nobody's
     talking about it.
          Ms. Arnold told you that he quit Merit
     Ultra Lights in '78 to '80.  One, that couldn't
     even be possible.  They didn't make Merit Ultra
     Lights until 1981.  So, you know, you have to
     use your common sense again as to why -- why
     would they say that.
          The next slide.
          MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, may we approach
     on this one?
          THE COURT:  You may.
          (Sidebar discussion held:)
          MR. PAIGE:  Let me get my glasses.
          MR. CARTER:  There's a line that's
     circled.
          MR. PAIGE:  Your Honor, it's not -- I'll
     change.  Let me see what is needing to be
     changed.  Where is it?
          MR. CARTER:  The next one, the third one,
     Your Honor.
          MR. PAIGE:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  I got it. 5090
     I'll just put -- I'll tell him to omit this
     one.  Just take this one out.
          THE COURT:  Both of then, right?
          MR. PAIGE:  Yeah, I'm going to take both
     slides out.
          THE COURT:  Okay.
          (Sidebar concluded.)
          MR. PAIGE:  And then Ms. Arnold told you
     that the only -- the only brand that Bryan
     remembered was Merit Ultra Lights.  You know,
     how valid, how reliable could it be?  In 1981
     Bryan was only 8 years old.
          Think about it, when you're 43 years old,
     somebody who is 43 years old now, they are
     going to remember the brand of cigarettes their
     father was smoking 35 years ago when they were
     7 years old?  That's the cigarette he grew up
     with, Merit Ultra Lights, and that's the one he
     remembers.
          Ms. Arnold told you that light cigarettes
     are safe, that they are safer.  We know for a
     fact today, now we know that the design changes
     cause people to smoke how they smoke, and the
     design changes cause more adenocarcinoma in the
     lungs.  It's a fact.  It's a proven fact. 5091
          So they are not safer.  They are more
     dangerous and they are not safer for people who
     get adenocarcinoma.  That's for sure.
          The Philip Morris website today actually
     says that lights are no safer, okay.  But they
     knew that for decades.  When you look at -- you
     look at their documents, you'll see that it's
     in there for decades.  And you think to
     yourself, why then now, why now, you know,
     think why now?  Now we are in courtrooms, we
     are talking about it.  So why now suddenly is
     this on their website that they are going to
     admit it?
          MS. ARNOLD:  Objection, Your Honor.
          THE COURT:  Grounds.  You want to
     approach?
          MR. CARTER:  Pretrial motion.
          THE COURT:  Sustained.
          MR. PAIGE:  I'm going to go through these
     quick.  They say the public health community
     recommended light cigarettes to the public.
     That's true.  That's a true fact.
          That they were working with the National
     Cancer Institute.  Remember they had the
     Tobacco Working Group, and they were working 5092
     with them and they weren't being honest with
     them.  And they were supposed to, back in 1953
     when they did the Frank Statement, they
     promised, we are going to cooperate with the
     Surgeon General.  We are going to cooperate
     with public health authorities.  That's what we
     promise you that we will do.
          And they concealed that.  They lied to the
     Surgeon General, they lied to the National
     Cancer Institute, and now -- now, in fact, even
     Dr. Pach said that he was aware of, that he's
     read the 2014 Surgeon General's Report.  I
     asked him, are you familiar with the 2014
     Surgeon General's Report.  He said yes.
          And I asked him, are you aware of the
     harms caused by all the conspiracy and the
     concealment done by the industry?  He knows
     about it.  Dr. Pach, who came from the
     Defendant, knows about it.
          And so they know now, the government now
     knows, now that the documents are public, what
     they concealed from them for decades, while
     people were dying, while they were making
     money.  And that's why they got in trouble.
          That's why they got in trouble. 5093
          The median Florida income is $50,000.
     That's probably true.  You know, if Dr. Pach
     made $35,000 on one case, compare his
     qualifications to Dr. Proctor.  Dr. Proctor
     makes a lot of money, I'm not here to apologize
     for him, he's a brilliant man.  He is probably
     one of the smartest, you know, a very smart
     man.  He reads and reads and reads.  He knows
     so much.  And you know what, second to him,
     Proctor is probably the most important person
     in my cases.
          So he's -- he knows his stuff, and he
     knows things that are -- that a lot of people
     do not know.  I could hire a Dr. Pach, but why
     would I do that?  Why would I do that?  It
     doesn't make sense.  So now I can stand up here
     and apologize that I've hired the top person in
     the country --
          MR. KACZYNSKI:  Objection, Your Honor,
     personalizing.  Personal opinion.
          THE COURT:  Mr. Paige, you just said the
     same thing in your previous closing, so I think
     you can move off this.
          MR. PAIGE:  Okay.  All right.  I guess I
     said that before. 5094
          And then they said to check "no" for
     punitive damages because they said --
     Mr. Kaczynski said there's going to be another
     session.
          And it sounds -- we do appreciate your
     time here.  And it's hard -- you know, we are
     asking you to sacrifice your jobs, you know,
     get up early, come here, be with us all day
     long.  Everybody should be home for dinner
     right now and you got to listen to me.  But ...
          MR. SALES:  Three weeks.
          MR. PAIGE:  But the truth is, the session
     for punitive damages will take one day.
     Opening statements will be like 10 minutes, 15
     minutes.  They each call a witness.  It's about
     three hours.  Closing statements are very
     short.  It's not a session, we will be done by
     Friday.  And it shouldn't be that we are
     nervous about punitive damages being a session
     that you should avoid justice in doing what's
     right.  And I ask you, you know, don't check --
     I mean, check "no" if you believe it's not
     warranted, but the session won't take very
     long.  We will be done by Friday.
          So you saw 36 Reader's Digest articles, 5095
     they told you, but I don't even know if you saw
     any.  But then they wanted to tell you that you
     didn't see any of the $200 billion advertising
     campaign, that they didn't want you to think
     that you didn't see any of that.
          It was no secret to Karl Ahrens that
     nicotine was addictive, but all their people
     you saw on video, Bowling, Wakeham, Rodgman,
     Campbell, Horrigan, Heimann, all those people
     who talked, went on TV and they talked to
     people, didn't know nicotine was addictive,
     didn't know smoking caused cancer, didn't know
     nothing.  All they knew was that applesauce
     might hurt people.  I mean, come on.
          And then they say everybody knew, but they
     were justified in lying.  They revealed the
     truth, they cooperated with the NCI and the
     Surgeon General, but the Florida Supreme Court
     is wrong.  The Florida Supreme Court that
     affirmed and confirmed all these findings by
     these Defendants that the TI and the CTR were
     disbanded by law in our country, but they think
     they are going to convince you that they
     revealed everything and cooperated with
     everybody. 5096
          And they have a searchable website now,
     you know, a searchable website that was
     launched after lawsuits and after Karl Ahrens
     died.
          MR. CARTER:  Objection, Your Honor,
     improper argument.
          THE COURT:  Sustained.
          MR. PAIGE:  That's the end of that part.
          Okay.  So real quick.  Again, I appreciate
     your patience.
          They showed you the pack warnings and all
     the warnings, the hundreds of thousands of
     times that they -- that Mr. Ahrens saw the
     warnings.  And again, you know, were there
     warnings on his packages?  Of course there
     were.  Of course there were.
          Does a smoker, every time they go to the
     warnings -- get a cigarette, sit there and read
     the pack?  Do they?  Do they?  Does a smoker
     every single -- that's what Mr. Ahrens said --
     I mean Mrs. Arnold said.  You take a pack of
     cigarettes and you look at the warning and you
     start analyzing it.
          They know that doesn't happen.  In fact,
     the FTC reports that they get copies that tells 5097
     them that people don't pay attention to those
     warnings, that that warning doesn't work.  They
     know that.
          So they know that, you know -- what's all
     the arguments about warnings?  In fact, if the
     warnings were seen 100,000 times by Karl --
     that's the same thing.  If the warning was seen
     100,000 times by Karl Ahrens, how many times,
     how many billions and billions and billions of
     packs of cigarettes were they making every day
     that had the same warnings while they went on
     TV and lied and told people the warnings
     weren't true?
          All these people, they didn't see the
     warnings, but Karl Ahrens did.  They didn't see
     Reader's Digest, but Karl Ahrens did.  They
     didn't know nicotine was addictive, but -- they
     knew that nicotine was as addictive as cocaine
     and heroin, and I will tell you, Karl Ahrens
     did not know that.  They knew about all the
     carcinogens of arsenic and cyanide and
     freebasing.  Karl Ahrens did not know that.
     There was no way he could have known that.
     They knew about compensation.  They knew their
     filters were a fraud. 5098
          And Mr. Kaczynski -- oh, well, okay.
          So -- right.  So we talked about choices,
     you know, and we said this in the beginning,
     choice is a two-way street, right.  It's got to
     be.  You can't just say he could have quit, so
     because he didn't quit, he's at fault
     100 percent, because that means that would
     apply to everybody.  And so choice, you know,
     we talked a lot about it, but they talk about
     choice in their internal documents, and they
     said over and over and over again that they
     know that it's not about free choice.
          Internally, when they are sitting in their
     meetings and they are writing their memos, they
     never talk about giving a smoker free choice.
     You will not see that.
          And so when we talked about filters, and
     Mr. Kaczynski says, oh, well, Lorillard -- he
     was smoking a Kent.  What was Lorillard suppose
     supposed to know?  Well, first of all,
     Lorillard was in a conspiracy with
     R.J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson and
     American Tobacco and all the other companies.
     If Lorillard didn't know that filters were no
     safer, okay, if you think about what 5099
     Mr. Kaczynski is saying, you take it to the
     logical end, and he says, all the scientists at
     Lorillard didn't know that filters weren't
     working, right, people who probably had Ph.D.s
     and who knows what degrees, they are making
     cigarettes, they are studying cigarettes, they
     are in laboratories making filters.
          So they don't know.  If they didn't know
     the filters were a fraud, how in the world was
     Karl Ahrens going to know?  All he knows is the
     advertisements said that they did work.  That
     they did work.
          And Lorillard talked about exploiting the
     filters, that people thought they were safer.
     That's not nice.  They know people are dying
     and they are going to say, we are going to
     exploit that.  We are going to exploit that.
     Those are their words, not mine.
          So when Mr. Kaczynski said that they
     didn't know, well, it's their product, they
     should know.  And if they didn't know, maybe
     some of their buddies who they were conspiring
     with maybe should have told them what was in
     their memos.  But they all knew.  They all
     knew. 5100
          So then they talk about Alexander Spears,
     this great scientist who is out to help people.
     Well, when you look at his memos, all he is
     talking about are profits.  Look at this.  They
     are talking about making a cigarette so they
     can make money.
          You look at Alexander Spears, not once
     does he say one thing about one person who got
     hurt.  That is not what he is trying to do.
     And, in fact, if he was such a great person --
     what year is that?
          MR. SALES:  '66.
          MR. PAIGE:  1966.  So here is Alexander
     Spears, the great scientist.  He is talking
     about making a two to three-fold increase in
     sales.  He knows his products are bad.  He
     knows they are killing people and he watches
     TV, he sees the same shows that everybody else
     is seeing, and he sees the people that he is
     working with lying, and he does not have the
     courage to come forward and tell the truth.  He
     doesn't have the courage to come forward and
     help nobody.  And that's the great Alexander
     Spears that they tell you about.
          Come on. 5101
          And so back to the beginning, is Karl
     Ahrens a class member?  But for the addiction,
     because they want to tell you that he would
     have smoked a pack to a pack and a half a day
     if there was no nicotine.  And I submit to you
     that cannot make common sense.  It doesn't make
     sense because if it did, if it was about free
     choice, which is all they talk about, if it was
     about free choice and it wasn't about the
     nicotine, then they would remove the nicotine
     and give people free choices.  They would do
     that, but they know that's not so.
          So but for -- all the words that they use,
     I can't even remember them and I wrote them
     down, we have to prove this, we have to prove
     that to be a class member, just look at the
     law.  If you look at the jury instructions, it
     says what it says.
          You know, it's like when I was talking to
     Dr. Dorce yesterday and I was asking Dr. Dorce,
     it says as manifested by three of the
     following.  That means it's manifested.  It
     means it's manifested, right?  No, no, it
     doesn't mean that.  It means something else.
          You can't take the English language for 5102
     the English language, you got to go to medical
     school to understand this because -- I mean,
     you look at the book, the book says you have to
     go to medical school.
          This is not complicated.  If I can
     understand it, believe me, anybody can
     understand it.  It says what it says.  But for
     the addiction, if he was not addicted, would he
     have smoked a pack to pack and a half a day for
     35 years?
          And if the answer to that is -- if the
     answer to that is but for the addiction -- if
     he was smoking because he was addicted but for
     the addiction, then he's a class member.  He
     has to be a class member.  There's no reason to
     exclude him from the class.  He has to be.  And
     they always wanted him in the class before.
     There's no reason to exclude him now.  The law
     is the law.
          MS. ARNOLD:  Objection, Your Honor.
          THE COURT:  Grounds.
          MS. ARNOLD:  Exclusion from the class.
          THE COURT:  Overruled.
          MR. PAIGE:  And the one thing -- I'm
     almost done.  I'll be done in like five 5103
     minutes.
          So, you know, one thing when they talk
     about legal cause, they never tell you --
     there's always another instruction that follows
     it.  Every time -- it's not this or that.  It
     doesn't work that way.  It doesn't work, okay,
     it has to be this, it has to be that.  You have
     to choose one or the other.  That's not the
     law.  And when they showed you the law, they
     never showed you the second part of the law.
          And with every legal cause there's another
     instruction that always talks about concurring
     cause, and what that says is it doesn't have to
     be the only cause.  It could be addiction and
     choice.  It could be addiction and he didn't
     try hard enough.  It could be addiction and he
     should have tried harder.  That doesn't exclude
     somebody from being a class member.  That's why
     we talked about comparative fault.  And that's
     why we admitted partial responsibility.  And so
     that does not --
          MR. CARTER:  Objection, Your Honor.
          THE COURT:  You want to approach?
          MR. CARTER:  Yes.
          (Sidebar discussion held:) 5104
          THE COURT:  State your objection.
          MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, he is conflating
     class membership with comparative fault.  He
     said that they admitted comparative fault
     because -- he's talking about the concurrent
     cause instruction and class membership.
     That's --
          THE COURT:  I think he was -- at some
     point using the term "class" to mean -- I
     thought he was contrasting the Engle class with
     the target audience of cigarette marketing at
     one point.
          MR. CARTER:  Now he is talking about the
     concurrent cause, and then he just said that's
     more than one thing, that's why we admitted one
     for comparative fault.  So he is now arguing --
          COURT REPORTER:  Somebody is rustling
     papers.
          THE COURT:  Those are distinct legal
     concepts.
          MR. SALES:  I think the point of the
     argument, as I was following it and suggested
     it to Mr. Paige, not in reference to any
     particular concurrent cause instruction is that
     every time the Defense showed the legal cause 5105
     instruction, it only showed the first half.
          THE COURT:  I think that was -- I think
     that was permissible and that's not what drew
     the objection.  I don't think.  I think what
     drew the objection was -- let me get to the
     Plaintiff saying and -- and -- and that's why
     we are admitting -- he is suggesting and
     that -- that the concept of comparative fault
     is -- an analogue or parallel or otherwise the
     model for the distinction between legal cause
     and concurring cause.  Concurrent cause is like
     comparative negligence, right?
          MR. SALES:  There's a concurrent cause
     instruction and the comparative fault
     instruction.  There's a concurrent cause
     instruction.
          THE COURT:  Well --
          MR. SALES:  That's why I said -- but how
     about if I just tell Mr. Paige to move to the
     next thing?
          THE COURT:  I think -- I think that's
     probably better.  Are you asking for the
     instructions to be reread?
          MR. CARTER:  I would like the last
     statement that he compared, where he said 5106
     that's why we admitted fault, I would like that
     to be stricken and disregarded.
          THE COURT:  It could be addiction, it
     could be -- and he should have tried harder.
     He's talking about concurrent causation.  That
     doesn't exclude somebody from being a class
     member.
          MR. SALES:  That's true.
          THE COURT:  And then he talked about
     comparative fault.  And that's why we have
     admitted partial responsibility.
          MR. PAIGE:  Comparative fault.
          MR. SALES:  I don't -- and I'm scratching
     my head still --
          MR. CARTER:  Given a mistrial motion was
     made during my closing, I think that's fairly
     shocking that they are confused about this one.
          MR. SALES:  That was pixie dust.
          THE COURT:  Well, let me ask myself if it
     makes sense.
          I think, arguably, there is no conflation,
     so I'm going to cut the baby in half and just
     say move on.
          (Sidebar concluded.)
          THE COURT:  Counsel. 5107
          MR. SALES:  Are we coming back up, Judge?
          (Sidebar discussion held:)
          THE COURT:  A juror just sent up a
     question.  I need some Defense lawyers.
          Okay.  If I were a stickler I would call
     the juror out of order for sending up a
     question at this point, but the question is:
     "Are we, the jury, allowed to medical records
     of Mr. Ahrens to confirm our verdict even if
     they're copied from evidence files?"
          Oh, boy, I don't know what the hell that
     means.
          MR. PAIGE:  Tell them the medical records
     are in evidence.
          THE COURT:  I'm -- how about if I slough
     over it.  Understanding that there's a question
     about the medical records -- that Mr. Ahrens'
     medical records will be available to you in
     evidence.
          MR. SALES:  Yeah, are you going to
     respond, Your Honor?
          THE COURT:  Yeah.  I'll do that much.
          MR. SALES:  Are you going to do it now?
          THE COURT:  Yeah.  Yeah.
          (Sidebar concluded.) 5108
          THE COURT:  Folks, I have a juror question
     about medical -- about the -- Karl Ahrens'
     medical records.
          THE COURT REPORTER:  Microphone.
          THE COURT:  I have a juror question about
     Karl Ahrens' medical records.  Mr. Ahrens'
     medical records are in evidence and will be
     available to the jury during their
     deliberations.
          Go ahead, Mr. Paige.
          MR. PAIGE:  Okay.
          So -- the next one.
          So the last -- I have two -- I think two
     more issues and then maybe one little puny one
     at the end.
          So the one last issue that Ms. Arnold
     brought up was brand product use.  And what she
     was saying is:  Smoking a Defendant's cigarette
     was a legal cause -- this is the instruction --
     of injury if smoking that Defendant's
     cigarettes directly and in natural and
     continuous sequence produced or contributed
     substantially to producing such injury, so that
     it can reasonably be said that but for smoking
     that Defendant's cigarettes the injury would 5109
     not have occurred.
          And so two things:  One, there is another
     instruction that goes after that, and I'll show
     you that other instruction, and that one where
     it talks about -- right after it says:  In
     order to be regarded as a legal cause -- this
     is the second part of it, if you didn't see --
     smoking cigarettes manufactured by
     R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris need not be the
     only cause.  Smoking a Defendant's cigarettes
     may be a legal cause of his lung cancer and
     death even though it operated in combination
     with the cigarettes of another -- and so go on.
          And so that's why we showed you this.  And
     that's -- again, that's the facts of the case.
     You know, they did -- you know, we know with
     Merit Ultra Lights there's more compensation,
     we know about the design changes with
     adenocarcinoma, we know this gentleman got
     adenocarcinoma, we know that Dr. Ruckdeschel
     said with a 25-year-pack history in 1980 or
     '81, you know, he probably would have gotten
     lung cancer anyway, but then he said, the
     additional cigarettes for the next ten years
     increased the likelihood.  Every cigarette 5110
     smoked, we know there's damages.  There's
     carcinogens.  He went through the whole thing
     where he showed you the cilia and what's going
     on with the DNA changes.
          So all that ten years increased the
     probability until we got a 110 certainty.  So
     we don't have to speculate anymore.
          MR. SALES:  More difficult to treat.
          MR. PAIGE:  More advanced or make it more
     difficult to treat.  That's what he said.
          So, you know, those cigarette, you know,
     and we are not asking for this, but if you take
     that again to the logical conclusion of what
     they are saying, if from 1980 the die was
     already cast, that's what he is saying, if
     that's what they are saying, and Merit Ultra
     Lights bears no responsibility, then you know
     who else bears no responsibility?  Mr. Ahrens.
     Because he was not -- when he was in his teens
     and 20s and 30s and 30 percent of doctors in
     America were smoking in the '70s, that's not
     what we accepted responsibility for.  So
     Mrs. Arnold's client, you know, just because --
     you know, we couldn't bring a lawsuit in 1980
     if we wanted to, to say, hey, he is probably 5111
     going to get lung cancer, it's probably going
     to happen.  They'd say, hey, you're
     speculating, you don't know that.
          So what we do know is that he smoked for
     another ten years, and we do know that every
     time he smoked he was getting formaldehyde and,
     you know, arsenic and cyanide and polonium and
     all that stuff and junk into his lungs, and we
     know that he did have, ultimately, that 6 to
     8 centimeter tumor that that contributed to.
          So I just wanted to respond to that.
          Lastly, you know, we talked about, you
     know, Mr. -- I think it was Mr. Carter who --
     was it Mr. Carter -- I think it was Mr. Carter,
     who talked about that maybe he never smoked
     Kent cigarettes, but then he said, well, we are
     not going to disbelieve Mrs. Ahrens, either.
          Look, Mrs. Ahrens, you met her.  She told
     you what her husband smoked.  The fact that,
     you know, that's what he smoked.  If it was
     something else, she would have told you it was
     something else.  He smoked Kents.  And what she
     told you is she remembered something brown.
          Think about it.  It's 2015, '16, you know.
     She's being asked about what she remembers from 5112
     the '90s, the '80s, and she's saying, look, I
     remember brown.  She is going to remember the
     filter on somebody else's cigarettes from 20,
     30 years ago, she's remembering something
     brown.
          So that's Merit Ultra Light had a brown
     filter.  There's no dispute about it.
          If you can show that.
          So that's a Merit Ultra Light.  You can
     see the little sign.  You see it on the lighter
     there.  That's a Merit Ultra Light pack, and
     that's the brown filter she remembered.
          And before that he smoked Kents.  That's
     what Mrs. Ahrens told you when she was under
     oath, and I submit to you everything that she
     said, you know, she was very forthright and
     forthcoming and what did she say, she told you
     what she knew, nothing more and nothing less,
     and that's what happened.
          And, finally, the last one is not even
     typed up, it's handwritten.  And so Mrs. Arnold
     said that the amount that we requested had to
     be based upon the law.  And it had to be based
     upon the facts in this case, and I agree with
     that 100 percent. 5113
          Because I know -- I don't want a verdict
     that does not conform with the evidence and the
     law.  Okay.  I know that that would not be a
     good thing, to get a verdict that would be too
     high.  Okay.  That's not good to have it.
          I wish I could ask for more, but I have to
     ask for an amount that I know would be
     supported by the evidence and the law.  So if I
     ask for $100 million, that wouldn't be right.
     I submit to you that the evidence and the law
     would sustain a verdict of exactly what I asked
     for, and that's why we asked for that.
          And what Mrs. Ahrens went through, you
     know, I didn't say much about it, but she's
     having a lonely life for 20 years.  She slept
     alone in her room.  She has people coming to
     her house in the morning.  They take care of
     her, they give her a bath, they get her dressed
     and then they leave her there.
          And they come, I think they help her make
     dinner, then they leave her there.
          You know, I wish I could ask for more.
     And, you know, you could -- I would urge you
     not to give more.  You could award more, you
     could give less, it's up to you.  But I think 5114
     the amount that we asked for is fair and
     reasonable in light of the harm and the mental
     anguish and the pain and suffering that she's
     lived with and will live with.
          And that's it.  And I thank you all very
     much for your time.  Thank you again.
