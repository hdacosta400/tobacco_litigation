21           MR. KACZYNSKI:  Thank you, Your Honor.  May it
22       please the court, counsel, Ms. Alexander, ladies
23       and gentlemen.  Finally winding down.  I want to
24       join my colleagues here in thanking you for your
25       service, thanking you for your attention.

 1           I said it before and, again, I know it sounds
 2       trite, but the system couldn't survive without
 3       you.  We couldn't do this without you.
 4           In terms of ways that you can serve your
 5       country, there's a whole range.  I mean, it starts
 6       with something as simple and as easy as paying
 7       your taxes, and ranges all the way to those who
 8       lie in state in Arlington and other places like 
 9       that around the country.
10           And your service is on the upper end of that
11       scale and whatever you decide, whatever the
12       verdict, you'll be able to go back to friends,
13       family, co-workers and tell them that you helped
14       make the system work because you did.  And we
15       appreciate that.
16           Just about two weeks ago I told you this case
17       was about John Paul Alexander and the choices he
18       made, and two weeks later it still is.  Two weeks
19       ago I told you you'd see a picture of a strong man
20       who stood in between addiction and injury.  A man
21       who never complained about his smoking.  A man who
22       never said he wanted to quit.  A man who was in
23       control of where he smoked and where he didn't.  A
24       man who never tried to quit before he was
25       diagnosed.  And when he was diagnosed with COPD he

 1       quit when he tried the first time.
 2           Two weeks later almost, with the proof in, you
 3       still saw a picture of a strong man who never
 4       complained about his smoking, who never said he
 5       wanted to quit, who was in control of where he
 6       smoked and where he didn't, who never tried to
 7       quit before he was diagnosed.
 8           Now, from pretrial to trial, testimony about
 9       how -- whether he actually quit changed a little
10       bit.  In front of you under oath in that chair
11       Mrs. Alexander said her husband never quit.
12       Before trial under oath she said he did.  She said
13       he had no withdrawal symptoms.  Said he was the
14       same man before and after he quit.
15           And you heard that pretrial deposition
16       testimony under oath yesterday when Ms. Brower was
17       playing the part of Ms. Alexander in the jury box.
18           Now, you're the Judge of facts and you'll have
19       to decide what the true facts are.  But, you know,
20       we can take a look at the medical records.
21           The medical records say he quit.  They say he
22       quit back in -- the 1998 record says he quit.  The
23       1997 record says he quit.  Says, Smoking, No.  And
24       if you look up in the corner, I was going to come
25       back to this later, it's the reporter, the person

 1       who reported that information was his daughter
 2       Clara.
 3           In court here under oath Jeanette said he quit
 4       -- I'm sorry, one more medical record, stopped
 5       smoking two years ago.  Smoking, and the one on
 6       the right, Smoking, No.  And by the way, if you
 7       look down at the lower right-hand corner, Able to
 8       Read, Yes.
 9           And then his daughter Jeanette under oath here
10       in that chair said that there was a time she
11       remembered that she didn't see him smoking
12       anymore.
13           Under oath here his daughter Clara said that
14       he never quit but, of course, Clara, as I pointed
15       out a moment ago on the medical record, was the
16       reporter to the doctor -- or the nurse who filled
17       out the form saying that he quit a month and a
18       half ago back in 1997.
19           So you're the Judge of facts.  You'll have to 
20       figure out where the truth lies.
21           Two weeks ago I told you you'd be inundated
22       with company documents and testimony had
23       everything to do with the companies and nothing to
24       do with Mr. Alexander.
25           Two weeks later with the proof in, the

 1       plaintiffs have made a valiant attempt to retry
 2       the first Engle case.  To re-prove generic company
 3       conduct, to prove the case of some anonymous
 4       plaintiff, a generic smoker -- not
 5       Mr. Alexander -- a generic smoker who, unlike
 6       Mr. Alexander, cared about and followed the
 7       activities of the Tobacco Industry Research
 8       Committee and Council For Tobacco Research and
 9       Tobacco Institute.
10           A generic smoker who, unlike Mr. Alexander,
11       like a lemming to the sea, looked at cigarette
12       ads, studied them like a marketing student and
13       then ran off as he was programmed to do by the
14       product.
15           And two weeks later, and you heard it again
16       this afternoon, two weeks later they proved a
17       thoroughly unremarkable marketing proposition that
18       manufacturers segment their markets and compete
19       with each other for brand share within those
20       market segments.
21           One of those market segments is now, and as we
22       saw in Ebony, has been since at least the '60s,
23       the African American market.  The evidence, of
24       course, was -- and you saw from the Surgeon
25       General, tobacco companies didn't create that

 1       market.  The 1950s marked the introduction of
 2       menthol cigarettes, although a greater proportion
 3       of African Americans now smoke mentholated
 4       cigarettes compared with members of other
 5       racial/ethnic groups.  No evidence exists that the
 6       menthol market was initially conceived as having
 7       any special appeal to African Americans or other
 8       racial/ethnic groups.
 9           And they have not shown you one illegal or
10       improper activity, marketing activity, in
11       connection with marketing to that market segment.
12           And Dr. Kyriakoudes told you that on the
13       witness stand.  For the period of time you were
14       running through, it was lawful to run print
15       advertising for the tobacco companies, right?
16           Oh, yes.
17           Lawful to sponsor concerts, correct?
18           Yes.
19           Lawful to sponsor racing events, correct?
20           Yes.
21           Lawful to use billboard advertising, correct?
22           Yes.
23           Lawful to use point of sale advertising,
24       correct?
25           Yes.

 1           Lawful to do transit advertising, correct?
 2           Yes.
 3           We heard -- we saw a document here that says
 4       they got advertising in liquor store.  That's 
 5       lawful, too.
 6           So all you heard was that the cigarette
 7       companies, like companies all across the country,
 8       segment their market, compete in the market
 9       segment using lawful means of advertising.
10           And that's true, it's marketing 101, even if
11       the product is cigarettes and even if the market
12       is African Americans.
13           You heard back in the testimony of
14       Dr. Kyriakoudes that Kools attempt to upgrade its
15       brand, was somehow made to sound sinister.  Well,
16       again, marketing 101.
17           Remember when K-Mart was trying to upgrade its
18       image by introducing a Jacqueline Smith role --
19       excuse me, line of clothing?  So what.  So what if
20       they used concerts, coupons, or smiling models, or
21       billboards.  That's not wrongful conduct.  That's
22       marketing 101.  And even Dr. Kyriakoudes,
23       plaintiff's expert, admitted it.
24           So two weeks after we started, what have they
25       not done?  Well, they have not done what their

 1       expert witnesses said that they weren't going to
 2       do, and that was to try the case of John Paul
 3       Alexander, to try the Gainesville, Florida
 4       portion of the trial.
 5           Dr. Burns, of course, was the first witness.
 6       He was on generic videotape.  He had nothing to
 7       say about Mr. Alexander or any other individual.
 8       But the folks that did appear, we had Dr. Proctor,
 9       and right off the bat, Dr. Proctor said he's not
10       here to be the biographer of Mr. Alexander.  He
11       done no research into his life and he's not here
12       to tell you the, the jury, what he read or didn't
13       read, what he saw or didn't see, anything specific
14       to him.
15           So Dr. Proctor disclaimed wanting to talk
16       about the case of John Paul Alexander.
17           Dr. Kyriakoudes, same thing.  He often
18       testifies that he's not the historian of the
19       individual smoker.  He says, I'm not any
20       particular plaintiff's biographer.  He's been
21       asked basically to render a judgment on
22       individuals at a particular point in time and he
23       doesn't do it, and he didn't do it here.  He was
24       not the biographer of Mr. Alexander.  He was not
25       here to tell us what he saw, what he saw or didn't

 1       see, things of that nature.  He said no, I'm not
 2       here, and I haven't in the course of my testimony.
 3           So the experts didn't make out their case of
 4       John Paul Alexander.  And no family or friends
 5       stepped in to fill the void.
 6           No family member or friend says that
 7       Mr. Alexander ever heard of the Tobacco Research
 8       -- Industry Research Committee.  No family or
 9       friend ever said he heard of the Council For
10       Tobacco Research.
11           No family or friend said that he heard of the
12       Frank Statement.  No family or friend said that he
13       argued with them when they told him to quit
14       because it was bad for his health or that it might
15       kill him. 
16           No family or friend said that he was the kind
17       of individual who would be influenced by
18       advertising.  In fact, right here in court right
19       in front of you his daughter Jeanette said the
20       exact opposite.  Was your father the type of
21       person who was generally influenced by
22       advertising?
23           I could not say that.
24           You would say no to that question?
25           I would say no to that.

 1           And Dr. Werner who reviewed all the
 2       depositions taken in this case came to the same
 3       conclusion.  Did you see any evidence in the
 4       depositions that he was, in fact, influenced by
 5       advertising and marketing with respect to why he
 6       started smoking?
 7           There was no evidence of that.
 8           Then she said nobody testified to that, that
 9       it influenced his decision to smoke or to not quit
10       sooner.
11           When your experts don't make out your case and
12       your fact witnesses don't make out your case, you
13       have no case.  You can't meet your burden of proof
14       without proof.  You can't meet the greater weight
15       of the evidence without evidence.
16           You can't tip the scales of justice with
17       nothing and you can't replace evidence and proof
18       and trying to tip the scales of justice with
19       things like the Frank Statement that never ran in
20       Gainesville.  Mr. Alexander couldn't have seen it.
21       Pamphlets sent out to doctors and politicians,
22       when Mr. Alexander was neither.
23           You can't replace evidence and proof with
24       press releases that never appeared in the
25       Gainesville Sun or with ads for Kool that were run

 1       while he was smoking Pall Mall or with the
 2       Flintstones ads for Winston which ran when he was
 3       30 years old and he was smoking Salems.  None of
 4       that has anything to do with him.
 5           And you can't replace proof and evidence by
 6       rhetoric that's just solely designed to get you
 7       mad at my client, or by showing you -- you saw one
 8       here -- those forecasting documents from the '70s
 9       and '80s and suggesting, as has been done, they
10       were used to market the teens.
11           But even Dr. Kyriakoudes had to admit that
12       there were legitimate purposes to things like
13       that, legitimate purposes to know why 14 do 17
14       year olds were smoking.
15           So the ability to forecast future usage is
16       important to a product manufacturer?
17           Yes, I mean, they're in the business of
18       selling their product and if they predict what
19       they are going to sell, it helps efficiency.
20           Well, it also helps predict the size of the
21       work force, right?
22           Yes.
23           How much manufacturing capacity they're going
24       to need?
25           Yes.

 1           The allocation of the manufacturing plant of
 2       different products -- different products that they
 3       manufacture?
 4           Yes.
 5           So knowing future trends is very important?
 6           Yes.
 7           I told you you'd see some stupid documents and
 8       company files, and you did.  And a lot of them,
 9       even Dr. Proctor had to admit that they went
10       nowhere.
11           In opening I told you, remember we talked
12       about the suggestion box, you'd see some noble
13       ideas, the low-tar and medium/nicotine cigarette,
14       even things like that, documents like that, there
15       was some stupid language, and you saw it.
16           But stupid ideas and stupid language do not
17       substitute for the greater weight of the evidence.
18           And all of that, the Frank Statement, the
19       pamphlets, the press releases, the internal memos
20       from Reynolds, the internal memos from Philip
21       Morris.
22           And by the way, you'll hear an instruction
23       from the Judge, or you heard it, it's actually in
24       your packet, that tells you the circumstances
25       under which you could consider evidence that's

 1       introduced by companies -- about companies other
 2       than Reynolds.  It has to be in furtherance of the
 3       conspiracy.
 4           When Philip Morris was trying to figure out
 5       how to better market Philip Morris products, I
 6       would argue to you that's not in furtherance of
 7       any conspiracy.  It's in furtherance of the
 8       special interest of Philip Morris.  But you saw a
 9       lot of those.
10           And I raised this question two weeks ago for
11       the Frank Statement, the press releases, the
12       pamphlets, all that stuff.  What has this got to
13       do with John Paul Alexander?  Because that's why
14       we're here.  That's why we're here.
15           This is not a generic class action like the
16       first Engle trial.  This is not a congressional
17       hearing where you're making judgments in a vacuum.
18       This case is about John Paul Alexander.  And
19       neither their experts nor their fact witnesses
20       have connected anything that Reynolds did to him.
21           We talked about those railroad tracks back in
22       the opening and the railroad that runs from
23       Jacksonville to Miami.  When it passes through
24       this place that used to be called Hogtown, the
25       tracks don't meet.

 1           They have not proven that anything R.J.
 2       Reynolds did affected Mr. Alexander.  They have
 3       not proven that anything R.J. Reynolds did was a
 4       legal cause as to finding in the instructions of
 5       his injury.
 6           Now, the first question you're going to have
 7       to answer on the verdict form when you retire to
 8       deliberate is whether Mr. Alexander was addicted
 9       to cigarettes containing nicotine, and if he was,
10       whether addiction caused his injury or whether
11       his injury was caused by his choice to smoke and 
12       to continue to smoke.
13           The issue is not whether smoking caused COPD.
14       It did.  That's resolved, as you heard.  The issue
15       is whether addiction caused his injury.
16           Now, as the proof came in, you learned a
17       little bit about the concept of addiction.  You
18       learned that the notion that quitting smoking
19       could be difficult has been around for a long,
20       long time.
21           You learned from the plaintiff's first
22       witness, Dr. Burns, that it's been known for over
23       100 years that smoking could be difficult to quit.
24       The terms like nicotine fiend, nicotine fit have
25       been a part of our culture for a long, long time.

 1           You heard that the State of Florida first
 2       called smoking -- cigarette smoking an addiction
 3       back in 1906.  And the instruction that you were
 4       read about concealment, as you'll see in the
 5       instructions you were given to take back to the
 6       jury room, the information concealed has to be
 7       something that was not otherwise available.
 8           Was the fact that cigarette smoking was
 9       addictive otherwise available?  Here it is.  From
10       Florida in 1906.
11           In the 1930s and 1940s we showed you Reader's
12       Digest articles that talked about quitting and
13       addiction and nicotine.
14           And when in 1988 the Surgeon General
15       officially labeled smoking addictive was above the
16       full coverage right here in Gainesville.
17           You saw the clip, you saw it many times during
18       this case, of the Waxman Committee hearings in
19       1994.  And the then CEO of R.J. Reynolds, James
20       Johnston, was asked the question whether smoking
21       was addictive.
22           And he was cut off in his answer, and that's
23       so important.  You'll have that in evidence.  You
24       can play back.  Listen to what he was starting to
25       say.  He was starting to say cigarettes are not

 1       intoxicating.  Cigarettes -- you do not develop a
 2       level of tolerance.
 3           What he was trying to do was to disagree with
 4       the '88 Surgeon General's Report to be sure, but
 5       he was embracing the '64 Surgeon General's Report;
 6       the report that called it a habit.  The report
 7       that set out criteria under which smoking was not
 8       addictive.
 9           It's one thing to call him old-fashioned or
10       maybe not adopting the principles or the standards
11       that the Surgeon General changed in order to call
12       smoking addictive, but you can't call him a liar
13       because he was adhering to the '64 report
14       standard.  And that's what he was cut off trying
15       to say.
16           The newspaper articles, and you saw a bunch of
17       them, and magazine articles began to pop up about
18       smoking and disease in the '40s and the '50s and
19       the '60s, '70s and '80s, there would be articles
20       about smoking cessation clinics.  Articles right
21       here in Gainesville.
22           In the '80s and the '90s you saw the articles 
23       about publicity for The Great American Smokeout
24       and the activities around town for The Great
25       American Smokeout.

 1           Why are these important?  Doctors have quoted
 2       it.
 3           Even if you assume that Mr. Alexander couldn't
 4       read or had minimal reading ability, all this is
 5       going on around him, all this is going on around
 6       him in a town he's lived in for decades.  You
 7       could not help but know this.
 8           You also heard in this case that addiction
 9       does not provide an excuse or a reason to avoid
10       personal responsibility.  And you heard it, from
11       no less of an authority, Dr. Burns who said, And
12       even if they're addicted the smokers are still
13       responsible for their own smoking behavior,
14       correct?
15           That's correct.  The fact that someone is
16       addicted is a barrier to behavioral change, but it
17       doesn't free them from responsibility for their
18       own behavior.
19           And Dr. Werner told you that she would never
20       tell any patient that that patient did not have
21       the ability to stop smoking.  And that's because,
22       as you heard, from the very first days of this
23       case, that the word choice, as much as people
24       would like to say that it's a word of the tobacco
25       industry or mine, is the word of the Surgeon

 1       General, 1977.  Cigarette smoking represents a
 2       category of health problems that can be called
 3       personal choice health behavior.
 4           A few years later he said it again.  A
 5       personal choice behavior.  Was that a mistake,
 6       too?  Take a look again.
 7           Even while calling smoking an addictive
 8       behavior, the Surgeon General said the individual
 9       smoker must decide whether or not to continue that
10       behavior.  The words of the Surgeon General.  Not
11       mine.  Personal choice and personal
12       responsibility.
13           It's a concept as old as the Garden of Eden.
14       A concept exercised every day Mr. Alexander
15       reached for a pack and took out a cigarette; he
16       exercised when he lit the cigarette.  It's a
17       choice he exercised when he inhaled the cigarette.
18       And it's a choice that he had for every time he
19       looked at that pack, for like 30 years, and saw a
20       warning label that told him it was a choice.  But
21       it was not a choice without consequence.  Personal
22       choice did not come with that risk.
23           Now, when deciding whether Mr. Alexander's a
24       class member, you have to decide whether addiction
25       caused his injury or whether his choice to smoke

 1       caused his injury.
 2           And you may remember from opening statement, I
 3       had a little diagram to sort of illustrate this.
 4       We've got addiction on the left.  We've got his
 5       COPD or emphysema on the right and we've got
 6       Mr. Alexander standing between them.
 7           Now, the plaintiffs in this case would take 
 8       the middle box out, and it would be that simple.
 9       Addiction, COPD.  In their regime addiction ends
10       free choice.  Addiction makes you a non-factor in
11       basic decisions about your own life.  Addiction
12       makes you a victim of forces beyond your control.
13       Nicotine.
14           Injury's inevitable.  It's just a matter of
15       time and injury absolves you of responsibility for
16       your choices.
17           But that formulation overlooked the fact that
18       addiction does not directly cause injury.  And I
19       want you, again, when you get back in the jury
20       room, read the definition of legal cause.
21       Addiction does not directly cause injury.  It's
22       not a virus.  It's not like HIV, AIDS or HPV or
23       the flu.
24           In between addiction and injury is a person.
25       A "you", a "me".  In this case a "John Paul

 1       Alexander".  And that person does have free will.
 2       And that person does have the ability to make
 3       choices.  Even in this age of victimhood that
 4       person bears responsibility for their actions.
 5           Not 10 percent or 20 percent, but 100 percent,
 6       because as I told you in injury selection, the
 7       party to this lawsuit best position to prevent
 8       harm to Mr. Alexander was Mr. Alexander.  The
 9       party to this lawsuit best position to stand
10       between addiction and injury is Mr. Alexander.
11           We learned a great deal about Mr. Alexander in
12       this trial.  And we learned that notwithstanding
13       his limited education, he was an intelligent man,
14       a bright man, a man who learned a trade and got
15       very good at it.  He could read well enough to get
16       a driver's license.  He could read well enough to
17       do bills at the service station.
18           Mrs. Alexander said he was a full-grown man
19       who knew right from wrong and who could and did
20       decide to smoke.  And we learned that he could and
21       did control his smoking.  She told us that he
22       wouldn't smoke at PTA meetings when he went with
23       her.  He sat through them, didn't need a
24       cigarette.  And went to school plays, he sat
25       through them.  Didn't need a cigarette.

 1           At her request he drove her to church and
 2       didn't smoke in the car because she didn't want to
 3       smell like tobacco smoke when she got to church.
 4           Whatever reason, he did decide to smoke around
 5       his daughter Clara who was asthmatic even when she
 6       was having asthma attacks.  He never tried to
 7       quit.
 8           Dr. Werner for the plaintiffs reviewed the
 9       record and concluded that he didn't try to quit.
10       Nobody at trial ever contradicted that.  Dr.
11       Werner found that he actually did quit in 1997.
12       No evidence he tried before and the medical
13       records reflect the fact that in '97 he did.
14           And let's take a look, again, at those medical
15       records.  First one, quit.  Family reports he
16       quit.  Stopped two years ago.  Quit smoking, no.
17       Able to read, yes.
18           And you heard the deposition testimony read 
19       yesterday where Ms. Brower played Mrs. Alexander
20       said that he quit.  He was a strong man who kept
21       up on current events.
22           You heard yesterday from the deposition
23       testimony that he would watch Walter Cronkite and
24       the Evening News at least from the 1960s on with
25       his wife beside him.

 1           So what we have is a man who controlled his
 2       smoking, who never wanted to quit before 1996, who
 3       never tried to quit before 1996, and was
 4       successful when he did, and suffered no withdrawal
 5       symptoms whatsoever.
 6           And he never complained about his smoking
 7       because it was just a part of his life.  It was
 8       just a part of his life.  It was a part of his
 9       life that he resisted being told to change.  When
10       people told him that they wanted him to quit
11       smoking, like his wife, for example, he told them
12       to mind their own business.  He told his daughter,
13       I'm grown.  I mean, I don't have to do what I
14       don't want to do.
15           And whether or not you agree with Dr. Werner
16       that he was addicted or with Dr. Myers that he
17       wasn't, the end result is the same.  Mr. Alexander
18       made a choice to smoke every day.  It was a
19       choice.  Surgeon General's word, not mine.  That
20       he could have changed every day, but he chose not
21       to.
22           It's a choice for which even today nobody
23       wants to seem to take responsibility for anything.
24       Even today he should be held responsible for that
25       choice.  Nothing and nobody controlled

 1       Mr. Alexander's choices except Mr. Alexander.
 2           Nobody and nothing could stand between
 3       addiction and injury except Mr. Alexander.  Don't
 4       let them take him out of that equation because
 5       this case is -- and was and is about John Paul
 6       Alexander and the choices that he made.
 7           We go through the verdict form, that first box
 8       whether his injury was caused by an addiction to
 9       cigarettes containing nicotine, you should check
10       no.
11           Now, there was an issue -- at the beginning of
12       the case I told you there was an issue of statute
13       of limitations.  And you're going to have to
14       decide, one of the questions -- and it's true the
15       defense bears the burden of proof on this one --
16       you're going to have to decide whether
17       Mr. Alexander could, by the exercise of due
18       diligence, have discovered his smoking related
19       COPD before 1990?
20           MR. SMITH:  Objection, Your Honor.  May we
21       approach?
22           (A sidebar conference was held outside the
23       hearing of the jury as follows:)
24           MR. SMITH:  That is a misstatement of the law.
25       It does not say "could".  It says "should" and

 1       that -- I let him go on opening because they
 2       hadn't been instructed.  They've been instructed
 3       now and that's a misstatement of the law.  The 
 4       instruction is that he "should" not "could".
 5       There's a huge difference and they've been
 6       instructed and that's misleading.
 7           MR. KACZYNSKI:  I'll repeat it, Judge.
 8           THE COURT:  Just correct it.
 9           MR. KACZYNSKI:  Okay.
10           (The sidebar conference was concluded, and the
11       following proceedings were held in open court in
12       the presence of the jury:)
13           MR. KACZYNSKI:  The issue you're going to be
14       asked to decide on the statute of limitations is
15       whether, in the exercise of due diligence,
16       Mr. Alexander should have discovered is smoking --
17       COPD smoking related before 1990.
18           This is a little bit tough to piece together
19       because we've been giving you pieces of evidence.
20       A lot of pieces came in yesterday.  Pieces of
21       evidence that have to -- that form like a puzzle
22       and as judges of the facts you're going to have to
23       decide whether that puzzle fits together.
24           And the puzzle pieces come from different
25       sources.  They come from -- and these are

 1       essentially the three questions:
 2           Did he have COPD before May 5th, 1990?
 3           Did he know, or should he have known, that he
 4       had an injury?
 5           Did he know his symptoms were related to his
 6       smoking?
 7           Let's take those one at a time.
 8           Did he have COPD before May 5th, 1990?  This
 9       is easy.  Everybody says he did.  Everybody says
10       he did.  You heard from Dr. Feingold that COPD
11       goes from mild to moderate to severe over a period
12       of decades.  It doesn't happen over night.
13           He showed up in his sixth decade of life in
14       his 50s with clinically significant emphysema.
15           And if Dr. Feingold had examined Mr. Alexander
16       back in the '80s he would have diagnosed him with
17       COPD.
18           Dr. Truncale says all of the above, and he had
19       symptoms that he should have known about back in
20       the 1980s.
21           Now, these are decades prior to 1990, the
22       decades that we don't have medical records.
23       Nobody's fault.  They're just not around.
24           But when we do start to have medical records,
25       what do we see?  Well, we see that he showed up

 1       and was diagnosed with severe COPD in 1996.
 2       Again, it doesn't happen overnight.
 3           Dr. Feingold admits he had COPD in the '80s.
 4       He would have diagnosed him in the '80s as far
 5       back as 1986.  He agrees he would have diagnosed
 6       him using pulmonary function tests and radiology
 7       and these tools, these diagnostic tools were
 8       available at the time.
 9           41, please.
10           Also, this is the right age to develop COPD.
11       The fifth -- the sixth decade of life, which
12       Mr. Alexander was in the 1980s.
13           Dr. Truncale said it was symptomatic.  And
14       here's an interesting record where he spells out 
15       clearly that he had a medical history, a past
16       medical history of emphysema.  Past medical
17       history of emphysema, according to his family and
18       reported by his daughter.
19           And we know that daughter was Jeanette.
20           Now, in this courtroom, she said her father
21       never had any medical problems prior to his stroke
22       in 1996.
23           On this medical record from 1996 she said he
24       had a history of hypertension, a history of
25       emphysema and if you look in the lower right-hand

 1       corner, the highlighted SOB, shortness of breath,
 2       back in 1996.  Family members knew he had a
 3       history of COPD and he must have as well.
 4           Now, should he have known he had COPD?  This
 5       is an important question and, again, there are
 6       three pieces -- there are three sources to the
 7       pieces of the puzzle:  Medical records, testimony
 8       of the family, and testimony of the friends in
 9       this trial.
10           Let's take a look.
11           Well, let's check one, okay.
12           Let's take a look.  Now the issue is not, by
13       the way, whether Mr. Alexander could diagnose
14       himself with a stethoscope to his chest.  Whether
15       -- the question is whether his condition was
16       severe enough for him to see a doctor.
17           Now, here's where the puzzle pieces begin to
18       fit.  You heard of the deposition testimony
19       yesterday, where Ms. Brower played Mrs. Alexander,
20       that Mr. Alexander stopped working at his service
21       station, she said, when he took sick and was told
22       that he had emphysema.
23           Everybody's memory, of course, controls, but
24       she sat on the stand and said those three things.
25       He stopped work at a service station when he took

 1       sick, when he was diagnosed with emphysema.
 2           Put that puzzle piece together with his social
 3       security records and what do they show?
 4           Well, first of all, what you don't see, by the
 5       way, is any work at all in 1988.  But then you see
 6       the last work he did at the service station is
 7       1989, and there are no social security records
 8       after that.
 9           So if you put Mrs. Alexander's testimony
10       together with the social security records, you
11       have him leaving the service station in 1999 -- or
12       excuse me, 1989 and then Mrs. Alexander follows
13       in, because he was diagnosed with emphysema.  The
14       whole puzzle begins to fit.
15           After that he worked at home.  You heard
16       testimony -- you were shown deposition testimony
17       from some of his friends, and I have no doubt that
18       every one of his friends was sincere in telling --
19       giving the testimony that they gave.  They
20       remember these things as happening in the 1990s.
21           We've seen what memories can do.  But the
22       social security record can't be wrong.  It can't
23       be wrong.  It's not subject to lapse of memory.
24       It's not fallible.
25           It says the last time he worked for an 3079
 1       employer was 1989.  And it jives with the
 2       testimony of Mrs. Alexander.
 3           So, again, why would he work at home?
 4           Dr. Truncale filled that in.  By this point he
 5       likely had moderate COPD, moderate emphysema and
 6       he just couldn't take the work at the service
 7       station, but continued to work on cars but at a
 8       slower rate and at home.
 9           That's -- those are a couple of puzzle pieces
10       and they're both consistent with what the
11       addiction expert said, because both addiction
12       experts, Dr. Werner and Dr. Myers, agreed that
13       Mr. Alexander met the DSM number 7 criteria, which
14       I'm going to show you in a minute, from the 1980s.
15           They said that in the 1980s he had a cough, he
16       had shortness of breath, and he had hoarseness.
17       And that these things were significant enough that
18       he would have known he had them and would have
19       known they were related to cigarette smoking.
20           Just take a look at what the DSM actually
21       says.  DSM 7, which both addiction experts,
22       plaintiff's and defendant's, said that
23       Mr. Alexander met, said that substance use, if
24       you're smoking, is continued, despite knowledge
25       of having a persistent or recurrent physical or

 1       psychological problem that is likely to have been
 2       caused or exacerbated by the substance.
 3           In other words, whatever he had was pretty
 4       significant.  Whatever he had was pretty
 5       significant, and he continued to smoke in spite of
 6       it.
 7           And dwell on that for a minute.
 8       Independently, the expert in Gainesville and the
 9       expert in Providence, Rhode Island working for
10       different sides with diametrically opposed
11       interests in the lawsuit, looking though at the
12       same materials, came to the same conclusion; that
13       based upon the symptoms they saw reported in the
14       medical records and the depositions, he had
15       knowledge of a persistent physical problem caused
16       by smoking in the 1980s which jives with the
17       social security record that says that's when he
18       stopped working, which jives with Mrs. Alexander's
19       testimony that said he stopped working because he
20       was sick and was diagnosed with emphysema.
21           Now, given all this, should Mr. Alexander have
22       gone to a doctor?
23           Drs. Myers and Werner, medical doctors, both
24       thought so.  And what would have happened if he
25       did?

 1           Well, this is what Dr. Feingold said.
 2       Dr. Feingold said back in the '80s, if a person
 3       goes to see a family practitioner in the 1980s
 4       they would have been told to stop smoking by most
 5       family practitioners.  That was his practice and
 6       that was the standard of care for Florida
 7       physicians.
 8           So under any test, any test, Mr. Alexander
 9       would have known, would have had severe symptoms
10       that would have been diagnosed as emphysema and he 
11       would have been told had he gone to a doctor they
12       were caused by smoking.  But he wouldn't have to
13       go to a doctor to know they were caused by
14       smoking.  Look at what was being played all across
15       the country.
16           ("Smoker's Cough?  See a Doctor" video played
17       for the injury.)
18           MR. KACZYNSKI:  Did he know he had an injury
19       back in the 1980s?
20           Check, yes.
21           And the final piece of the puzzle, Did he know
22       they were related to his smoking?
23           Well, first of all, the warning label on the
24       pack said it would have been.  Second of all, he
25       was told by various members of his family and

 1       friends, all throughout the entire time he smoked,
 2       that smoking wasn't good for him because it was
 3       making him cough, just killing him.
 4           But, again, looking at the evidence, Dr. Myers
 5       and Dr. Werner says that he met the DSM criteria;
 6       that is, these things:  Cough, shortness of breath
 7       and hoarseness were significant and should have
 8       had knowledge of those problems caused by smoking.
 9           Dr. Myers testified that these required --
10       this DSM-IV, criteria 7, doesn't require a doctor
11       to tell you that you've got them.  It's just that
12       you know you've got them.
13           And with all this, the evidence fits together.
14       The evidence fits together.
15           The testimony of Mrs. Alexander, the social
16       security record, the expert's testimony, it all
17       fits together.  And common sense tells you it fits
18       together.
19           So in the end, check all three boxes.
20           And when you get to the verdict form, the
21       question number 6, check yes.  Mr. Alexander
22       should have known that he had emphysema caused by
23       smoking.
24           Now, if you find him to be a class member, we
25       get past the statute of limitations and if we get

 1       past the addiction issue, you're going to have to
 2       find that something wrong that R.J. Reynolds did
 3       affected his choices.  You're going to have to
 4       find legal cause.
 5           In other words, but for R.J. Reynolds'
 6       conduct, Mr. Alexander would not have been
 7       injured.
 8           Now, because they made a run at re-trying the
 9       Engle case, the plaintiffs really kind of ignored
10       trying the Alexander case and they did not make
11       out a case of legal case.  In fact, most of the
12       so-called evidence that you saw, and you saw,
13       again, some of it this afternoon, falls into one
14       of three categories:  Untrue, unproven or
15       unrelated to Mr. Alexander.
16           But before we review the evidence, I want to
17       take a little detour and talk about the people who
18       provided it.  And that brings us to Dr. Proctor.
19           Dr. Proctor was the plaintiff's main witness
20       who testified for almost two days.  You recall
21       that he told us proudly that he is not a 
22       dispassionate scholar relating events to the jury.
23       He told us he was rooting for the plaintiff to
24       win.  Of course he was rooting for the plaintiff
25       to win.

 1           Dr. Proctor's the expert you recall who
 2       routinely trashes people who disagrees with him
 3       and it doesn't matter who they are, whether it was
 4       a historic figure like Dr. Wynder.  Dr. Wynder
 5       favored filters.  Dr. Proctor said -- we'll talk
 6       about this in a minute -- they were gimmicks so he
 7       trashed him.  He said he was taking tobacco money.
 8           Dr. Russell, the scientist of the addiction
 9       expert from Great Brittain, who wrote in the
10       British Medical Journal, Lancet, and wanted to
11       advocate a low-tar and medium/nicotine cigarette.
12       Dr. Proctor said he was taking cigarette money.
13       He was corrupt.  Not just wrong, but corrupt.
14           The American Medical Association for saying
15       they didn't think a warning label was necessary
16       because everybody knew the risks of smoking way
17       back in 1964.  He trashed the AMA and said they
18       took tobacco money.  Not just wrong, but corrupt.
19           And he never offered any evidence to prove it.
20       He never proved Dr. Wynder took money.  He never
21       proved Dr. Russell took money, and he didn't
22       exactly explain to you what the AMA situation was
23       all about.  Not just wrong, but corrupt.
24           And if you're a historian for the defense,
25       like Dr. Stueck, not only do you get smeared, you

 1       get smeared in print.  He charged people like
 2       Dr. Stueck of engaging in historical malpractice,
 3       being a black mark on the profession, and being
 4       easily seduced by money.
 5           In one article he smeared 40 distinguished
 6       historians without a second thought.  And, in
 7       fact, in his article and in this courtroom one of
 8       those historians was Dr. Steven Ambrose.  Who's
 9       he?  He was a bit of a giant in the historical
10       profession.  We heard that he was personally
11       selected by President Eisenhower to be his
12       biographer.  This is the man who founded the D-Day
13       Museum in New Orleans to honor our soldiers.
14       He's the author of the book Band of Brothers which
15       led to the mini series, was advisor to the mini
16       series.  Was advisor to Tom Hanks on Saving
17       Private Ryan.  This man was not beyond the reach
18       of Dr. Proctor.
19           If you disagree with Dr. Robert Neal Proctor
20       at Stanford, look out.  It's kind of ironic that
21       the man who sat there and talked about how the
22       tobacco industry had plans to smear researchers
23       which, by the way, you never saw any evidence of,
24       to smear researchers engaged in exactly that same
25       behavior in print, repeatedly, and in this

 1       courtroom under oath.
 2           And finally, you heard about his little
 3       adventure regarding the University of Florida.
 4       And no matter how self-righteous he defended that
 5       conduct, in fact, he was proud of it, what he
 6       really tried to do was to intimidate four graduate 
 7       students trying to work their way through college.
 8           What were they doing that was so horrible?
 9       They were researching newspapers for historians
10       for the defense in one of these cases.  Collecting
11       newspaper articles.
12           So he finds out that they're doing it.  He
13       gets their names from Dr. Kyriakoudes.  He gets on
14       the Internet, looks up their faculty advisor,
15       finds someone he met at a conference who was from
16       the University of Florida, and e-mails them and
17       says, hey, you know this is going on, and by the
18       way, to my e-mail, let me attach these two
19       articles in which he smears all the historians who
20       work for the tobacco industry.
21           When nothing happened after he let the Florida
22       professor know about it, he told her to bring it
23       up at a faculty meeting.  When he was told that
24       there was a Florida Sunshine Law that might govern
25       his e-mails with the Florida professor, he deleted

 1       them, which, again, is kind of ironic, a man
 2       covering his tracks deleting e-mails.  Ironic
 3       behavior for a man who came to you to talk about
 4       concealment.
 5           Now, as it turns out, the University of
 6       Florida History Department didn't need any help
 7       running their own department.  They didn't need
 8       any help from Dr. Proctor invading the students'
 9       privacy, researching the name of that faculty
10       advisor or telling the faculty how to run the
11       department because they had it under control all
12       the time.
13           One of the faculty advisors knew, was fully
14       informed, and didn't care, correct?
15           I think that's right.
16           Picking on colleges students working their way
17       through college.  Real profile and encouraging.
18           So why was this a big deal?  Why did they make
19       a big deal out of this?
20           Because Dr. Proctor, on so many issues, so
21       many things in this case, asks you to take a lot
22       on faith, on his word.  He often makes statements
23       unsupported by the evidence.  He often makes
24       statements that were contradicted by the evidence.
25           I'm going to take a look at a few.  Too often

 1       they gave -- we gave you proof, they gave you
 2       Proctor.  And I'm suggesting that anything this
 3       man said should be taken with a grain of salt.
 4           What am I talking about?  You even saw this
 5       one this afternoon.  Dr. Chin Lee of R.J. Reynolds
 6       wanted to do Ames testing back in 1978.  He's told
 7       legal says, no.
 8           And then Dr. Proctor moved on.  What he wanted
 9       you to think was the testing wasn't done and the
10       legal department is running the R&D department.
11       They're running the science, and no mutagenicity
12       testing, which is what he was asking to do, was
13       done.
14           What Dr. Proctor knew all along but didn't
15       want to tell you was that it was done.  Legal was
16       overruled.  And if you take a look at the dates,
17       this is a 1983 memo from the same Dr. Chin Lee to 
18       Dr. Rodgman who originally told them what legal
19       had said -- go to the next one -- the R&D
20       department of R.J. Reynolds has been engaged in
21       mutagenicity testing of cigarette smoke condensate
22       and tobacco additives by the Ames salmonella
23       microsome method since 1978.
24           Since the date of the first memo that
25       Dr. Proctor showed you, they were doing Ames

 1       testing in '78, '79, '80, '80, '80, '82, '83.
 2       Every year.  And you saw evidence that they were
 3       going to do it in the future.  So the Ames testing
 4       was done.
 5           Dr. Proctor wouldn't want you to know that.
 6           Again, ironic that a man came here to talk
 7       about concealment concealed this fact from you.
 8           Under what kind of evidence did he provide
 9       here?  It would be classified as untrue.
10           Now, Dr. Proctor called filters a gimmick, a
11       myth.  Here's his testimony.  A gimmick.  And if
12       you look down at the bottom, he calls it a myth.
13           Well, did you see a single scientific study
14       offered in support of that?  Did you see a Surgeon
15       General's Report that said filters didn't work?
16       Did you see a Surgeon General's Report that said
17       filters do not lower lung cancer rates?
18           He didn't show you anything.  He wanted you to
19       take it on faith; take it on the word of
20       Dr. Robert Neal Proctor.
21           Well, what did we show you?  We showed you
22       Surgeon General Reports from 1975 to 1990 that do
23       not say that filters were a gimmick.  They all say
24       filter tipped cigarettes lower lung cancer rates.
25       Filter cigarettes work.

 1           That's not what you heard from Dr. Proctor.
 2           You saw one staff report from a congressional
 3       committee written by politicians in 1957.  You saw
 4       that over and over again.  Whatever the case was
 5       in 1957, by the time we were all around to the
 6       '70s the Surgeon General is consistent, consistent
 7       in saying filters were a benefit.
 8           And remember Dr. Russell?  What did he say?
 9       He said it's unlikely that any single measure has
10       saved more lives or done more to reduce smoking
11       related disease than to switch from plane to
12       filter tipped cigarettes which began in the late
13       1950s and continued throughout the 1960s.
14           We gave you proof.  They gave you Proctor.
15           Dr. Proctor called CTR research distraction
16       research.  Conceded it was good research by good
17       scientists published in good journals, but
18       unrelated to smoking and health.
19           We showed you otherwise.  Articles dealing
20       with addiction.  Articles dealing with coronary
21       artery disease.  Articles dealing with
22       bronchogenic carcinoma, pulmonary, which is lung
23       cancer, pulmonary cancer, clearly related to
24       smoking and health.
25           And don't take my word for it, because -- next

 1       one -- this is just one, we showed you a bunch,
 2       cited by the Surgeon General of the United States, 
 3       CTR supported research.
 4           And as you heard in the testimony, this
 5       happened about 600 times.  Clearly related to
 6       smoking and health.  Not distraction research.
 7           We gave you proof.  They gave you Proctor.
 8           Dr. Proctor told you that the cigarette
 9       industry had a huge information campaign, that got
10       its messages from newspapers all around the
11       country.  And the best you got from him is this:
12       Plaintiff's Exhibit 26, which if you look real
13       carefully, consists of five New York newspapers
14       and one Boston newspaper.
15           He did not show you -- in fact, no plaintiff's
16       witness showed you a single issue of the
17       Gainesville Sun.  Not one.  And there's a reason
18       for that.  They did not show you a single issue of
19       the Gainesville Sun with an article slanted
20       towards the industry.
21           We put 44 issues of the Gainesville Sun into
22       evidence.  Read them.  Look at them and see what
23       they say about the power and effect of this
24       information.
25           The message that came through from those

 1       articles is that smoking causes disease, smoking
 2       could be hard to quit, and help is available if
 3       you want to quit.
 4           When you look at the instruction on
 5       concealment, it says that the information
 6       concealed must not be otherwise available to
 7       Mr. Alexander; otherwise available in the
 8       Gainesville Sun.  Smoking causes disease, smoking
 9       could be hard to quit, and it's addictive above
10       the full front page, and of all ads for clinics
11       and the Great American Smoke Out, this information
12       was clearly otherwise available.
13           But more to the point, the massive information
14       campaign, apparently never made it to Alachua
15       County.
16           Dr. Proctor said that R.J. Reynolds concealed
17       this internal work on the chemistry of tobacco,
18       but he didn't show you anything that should have
19       been disclosed that wasn't.
20           We showed you sites -- and this is just one
21       Surgeon General's Report.  We showed you sites of
22       all these articles written by Reynolds' scientists
23       that appeared in print.  These are all that are
24       just in one Surgeon General's Report.
25           He showed you some memos that suggested

 1       Reynolds was designed to ad campaigns to appeal to
 2       14 year olds.  You saw those documents again this
 3       afternoon.
 4           But the plaintiffs never showed you the ads.
 5       We did.
 6           Take a look at this one.  The first memo you
 7       were shown at one of the Hilton Head
 8       presentations, these are the ads that ran after T
 9       it.  Which ad do you think is going to drive the
10       14 year old to the candy store to get a pack of
11       cigarettes and smoke until he stops being sick to
12       become a regular smoker?
13           The guy in the middle who looks like an 
14       undertaker or the guy with the -- holding his
15       chest in the upper left-hand corner?  This is what
16       supposedly was going to appeal to 14 year olds.
17           Look at the next one.
18           These are the ones that ran after the document
19       in the 1980s.  You could use your own judgment
20       whether or not these appeal to 14 year olds.
21           We showed you the ads.  We gave you the proof.
22       They just gave you Dr. Proctor's opinion.
23           Now, I told you in opening finally that you
24       would see ideas that were a little bit like
25       suggestions in a suggestion box, ideas that never

 1       went anywhere but made trial exhibits or going to
 2       be trial exhibits forever.  You saw some of them
 3       here.  You saw some of them this afternoon.
 4           There was a proposal for a -- you saw the
 5       specially filter -- treated filtertip that would
 6       change color.  One of Claude Teague's earliest
 7       memos.  It went nowhere.  Dr. Proctor admitted it
 8       went nowhere.
 9           The proposal for a youth brand with tar levels
10       going back to the levels of the 1950s.  Never went
11       anywhere.
12           Even the idea of the low-tar, medium/nicotine
13       cigarette that Dr. Proctor had to admit was
14       actually motivated by the ideas of people like the
15       National Cancer Institute, the Surgeon General,
16       Dr. Russell and the Tobacco Working Group.
17           And by the way, lest you forget that that
18       project had a noble goal, not one to addict
19       people.
20           Look at Dr. Russell's article in the British
21       Medical Journal.  Besides having low-tar and CO
22       yield, the least harmful cigarettes for heavy
23       smokers may be those with a high, rather than low
24       nicotine yield.
25           Remember, the reason was people smoke for the

 1       nicotine but it's the tar that gives them disease.
 2       And if you bring the nicotine down -- if you bring
 3       the tar down, you bring the nicotine down, too.
 4       The idea was to maintain the nicotine but lower
 5       the tar so you would get less of the harmful
 6       ingredients of smoke.  That was the goal behind
 7       them.  Not to addict people, but in the end this
 8       idea went nowhere.  It couldn't produce a
 9       commercially acceptable cigarette.
10           But it was the defense that had to point that
11       out.  In so many cases with the stupid ideas,
12       Dr. Proctor was content to lay out the document
13       and move on, leaving it for you to assume that
14       happened.  Again, it didn't happen.
15           The man liked to use the word misleading.  He
16       did a fair amount of misleading.  And he told you
17       things that were unproven.  In the end he would
18       present a case that was unrelated to
19       Mr. Alexander.
20           As I said earlier, the plaintiff has to
21       establish legal cause.  They must prove that R.J.
22       Reynolds did something wrong that affected
23       Mr. Alexander's choices.  In other words, but for
24       R.J. Reynolds conduct Mr. Alexander wouldn't have 
25       been injured.

 1           Now, I've got a diagram for this as well.  The
 2       conduct -- call it negligence, call it
 3       concealment, call it product defect -- must have
 4       caused, must have affected Mr. Alexander's choices
 5       and that leads to COPD.
 6           But for the conduct, but for those things,
 7       Mr. Alexander would have made different choices.
 8       The conduct has to be why he started or continued
 9       to smoke.
10           And like addiction, he's in the middle.  He's
11       in the middle.  The man with the choices is in the
12       middle.
13           So you have to ask yourself, is the reason he
14       started to smoke any conduct of R.J. Reynolds?  Is
15       the reason he started to smoke -- continued to
16       smoke due to any conduct of R.J. Reynolds?
17           And if R.J. Reynolds had not done things,
18       would he have started to smoke, would he have
19       continued to smoke?
20           Well, we know R.J. Reynolds had nothing to do
21       with him starting to smoke, because we know his
22       first encounter with tobacco, we know from his
23       sister Rosa Lee, that his first encounter with
24       tobacco came when his father gave him tobacco to
25       chew when they were very, very young.

 1           Did R.J. Reynolds do anything wrong to cause
 2       Mr. Alexander to continue to smoke?
 3           Again, there's no evidence of that.  There's
 4       no evidence he saw the Frank Statement or heard of
 5       CTR.  There's no evidence he ever saw a pamphlet
 6       or a statement from the Tobacco Institute or CTR.
 7       There's no evidence he showed any interest
 8       whatsoever in anything any Tobacco Company,
 9       including R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, said.
10           Everything that Dr. Proctor said on the
11       witness stand and talked about has nothing to do,
12       nothing to do with Mr. Alexander.
13           I posed this question in the beginning and
14       it's true today:  Dr. Proctor's testimony, all of
15       it, what has this got to do with John Paul
16       Alexander?
17           The answer is, nothing.
18           So exit Dr. Proctor and Dr. Kyriakoudes, the
19       historian turned advertising experts, and even
20       here they come up empty.
21           What you heard this afternoon was
22       Mr. Alexander happened to be an African American
23       smoker which at some point switched to menthol.
24       That's the fact.  That's the proof.
25           There's no evidence of exactly when he did and

 1       there's no evidence at all of why he did.  For
 2       that reason alone, they can't meet the burden of
 3       proof without proof.  And you should reject any
 4       argument based on marketing.
 5           But what you're being asked to do -- what the
 6       Judge's instructions tell you you can't do is to
 7       substitute speculation for proof.
 8           The plaintiff's best case here is that
 9       Mr. Alexander was smoking a non-menthol product, 
10       he saw an ad for menthol and he switched.  Now,
11       that's built on argument.  That's not built on
12       proof.  He could have switched because a friend
13       switched.  He could have switched because he tried
14       one and he liked it.  There's no evidence he
15       switched because of ads.  None.  Dozens of
16       possibilities.
17           But even if it was true, it results in a
18       defense verdict, and here's why.  You already saw
19       the Surgeon General said that tobacco companies
20       did not create the menthol market.  And it's true.
21       The companies could plead guilty to having pursued
22       and competed in the African American segment of
23       the market.
24           But as we saw in our scroll from Ebony, so did
25       the Navy, so did McDonalds, so did Burger King, so

 1       did liquor, so did cars, so did beer, so did life
 2       insurance.  Everybody was competing for a segment
 3       of that market.  And it's true that the companies
 4       used a variety of ways to market there.  Well,
 5       things like the Kool jazz festival.
 6           But as that whole litany I went through with
 7       Dr. Kyriakoudes says, there's nothing wrong with
 8       that; that's not wrongful conduct.  It's
 9       legitimate marketing tools.
10           So if Mr. Alexander saw an ad on the TV or in
11       a magazine laying around the service station or on
12       a billboard on the road or on a poster in a liquor
13       store -- and bear in mind, there's no evidence
14       that any of that happened, but if it did, and he
15       switched to a menthol cigarette as a result, your
16       response should be, so what; so what.
17           The conduct that affects his choices must be
18       wrongful and there is nothing wrongful about
19       lawfully marketing.
20           And Dr. Kyriakoudes told you everything that
21       you heard about was lawful.
22           It is not wrongful to try to improve your
23       brand image.  It is not wrongful to try to take
24       market share from a competitor.  It is not
25       wrongful to market to ethnic media -- in ethnic

 1       media like Ebony.
 2           As a matter of fact, you saw the 1988 Surgeon
 3       General's Report that it was Ebony that was
 4       pursuing the companies to advertise in it.  Not
 5       the other way around.
 6           This is marketing 101, and it bears
 7       repeating.  Marketing 101 does not become
 8       unlawfully just because the product is cigarettes
 9       and just because the market is African Americans.
10           So if we go back to our diagram, the chains
11       busted.  They've identified no wrongful conduct
12       that caused Mr. Alexander to start smoking or to
13       continue to smoke.  They've identified no wrongful
14       conduct that was the legal cause of his injury.
15           You have the instructions with you.  You can
16       read it, but that chain is busted and the
17       plaintiff can't bridge the gap.
18           Now, if everything I've said thus far is un
19       persuasive, we're going to get to the issue of
20       damages.  We'll get to the issue of damages.  And 
21       you have -- if you decide to return a verdict in
22       favor of Mrs. Alexander, you'll have to decide on
23       an amount of damages.  This is hard.  It's hard to
24       put a value on life.  Human life is precious from
25       the wound to the grave.

 1           Mr. Avera asked for $2 million pain and
 2       suffering and $1 million for the future.  $3
 3       million is a lot of money even today.
 4           Now, you've got a jury instruction there that
 5       says whatever award you make is supposed to be
 6       fair and just in light of the evidence that you've
 7       heard in this case regarding Mrs. Alexander's loss
 8       of Mr. Alexander.
 9           You heard some talk about how much sports
10       figures make or what expert billing rates are.
11       That's not in the jury instructions.  The jury
12       instruction is what's fair and just according to
13       the evidence in this case.
14           So my question is what evidence did you hear
15       in this case?  And the answer is you heard
16       precious little.
17           Did you hear what kind of a father
18       Mr. Alexander was?  If we heard that testimony, I
19       missed it.
20           Apart from being a provider and a driver, did
21       we hear what kind of husband Mr. Alexander was?
22       If the testimony was there, I missed that, too.
23           Did we hear what he did to his family?  We
24       didn't hear that testimony.
25           He had three daughters but we only heard from

 1       two.  In fact, we called one of the two.  What did
 2       you hear?  You heard the life expectancy, the
 3       joint life expectancy, I believe this is correct,
 4       is eight years.
 5           You saw his social security earning records.
 6       Those -- that is evidence in the case, and that
 7       may be the only evidence you have to help you with
 8       this issue.
 9           And I would suggest that the evidence suggests
10       an award in the thousands, not in the millions, if
11       you should feel necessary to make an award in this
12       case.
13           If you make an award, compensate
14       Mrs. Alexander, not the lawyers.  Compensate her
15       based on the evidence you heard.  Not the
16       arguments you hear.
17           And finally, and it really is finally for me
18       because I don't get to speak again, if you go all
19       the way through the verdict form to the last
20       question, and you have found against my client on
21       either the conspiracy or concealment, you have to
22       decide whether punitive damages are warranted.
23           And if we get that far, if we get to punitive
24       damages, you will have already completely
25       compensated Mrs. Alexander for her loss with

 1       whatever figure you arrive at.
 2           Punitive damages are not about compensation or
 3       making someone whole.  Punitive damages are about
 4       more money.  Punitive damage is designed to punish
 5       and deter, punish for conduct tantamount to being 
 6       a reckless disregard for human life, and as you
 7       heard, the plaintiff must meet a higher level of
 8       proof; clear and convincing evidence.
 9           And I'm obviously here to argue that they've
10       proven no such thing.  Punish R.J. Reynolds?  You
11       heard testimony in the 1950s.  You saw a document
12       from the 1950s that R.J. Reynolds tried to take
13       the harmful substances out of cigarettes.
14           As you see, the very last paragraph there, 120
15       separate experiments using half a million
16       cigarettes.  They were trying to get
17       benzo{a}pyrene and that family of chemicals out of
18       their cigarettes.
19           Now, you heard from Mr. Avera, well, they told
20       people keep smoking, we're working on it.  Well,
21       they were working on it.  You got to understand,
22       you heard that when we were talking about Claude
23       Teague about how he started at Reynolds as a bench
24       chemist, never became a vice president, but when
25       we were talking about Dr. Proctor, we heard that

 1       Dr. Teague came to R.J. Reynolds after serving in
 2       Europe in World War II.  This was the greatest
 3       generation.  This was the World War II generation.
 4       They had just let Nazi Germany imperil Japan.
 5           Presented with a problem like this, is it
 6       unremarkable that they decided if there's
 7       something wrong with cigarettes, we're capable of
 8       fixing it?  And this is one of the efforts they
 9       made to fix it.  In the 1950s.
10           In the 1960s, we had R.J. Reynolds trying to
11       cooperate with the Federal Government.  Now,
12       you've heard about these documents that these
13       documents were all written, they were never
14       expected to see the light of date and this is what
15       people were really thinking.
16           Well, this one is too.  As you heard, it's
17       from the head of R&D, from the president of the
18       company, and what does he say?  In cooperation
19       with others you should push the work concerning
20       tobacco and health.  You should prepare a plan to
21       foster any relationship with government personnel
22       in the quest for mutual understanding of facts
23       ultimately to gain their cooperation and proper
24       research of the subject.
25           2.  Again, written while nobody's looking.  If

 1       there is a safer cigarette, let's continue and
 2       increase our efforts on this program.  Please
 3       prepare a plan to carry it out.
 4           This document was prepared, as you can see, on
 5       the top in 1968.  This was at the outset of the
 6       Tobacco Working Group.
 7           Let's go to the next one.
 8           Tobacco Working Group is something Dr. Proctor
 9       was asked about.  Again about '68, nine or ten
10       years.  It was under the aegis of the National
11       Cancer Institute.  Members of the Public Health
12       Community were members, the Tobacco Institute, the
13       federal government and the National Cancer
14       Institute.  This was a joint effort that went on
15       for nine years trying to develop a less hazardous
16       cigarette.  R.J. Reynolds fully participated in 
17       that.
18           And one of those efforts -- the next one,
19       please -- one of those efforts, this is the
20       minutes of one of the meetings, one of those
21       efforts was to come up with a high -- low-tar
22       medium/nicotine cigarette.  And there is the
23       document where the group says this is something
24       that we should go after.  This is something that's
25       promising.  R.J. Reynolds cooperated in trying to

 1       reduce the risk of smoking for those who would not
 2       quit.
 3           You saw some recites in the Surgeon General's
 4       Report of R.J. Reynolds' scientists.  There were
 5       others.  R.J. Reynolds' scientists published
 6       articles in the science of tobacco, and as we saw,
 7       they wound up being cited sometimes by the Surgeon
 8       General.
 9           In the 1980s R.J. Reynolds made a
10       revolutionary break through with something called
11       Premiere.  I asked Dr. Proctor about it.  It was a
12       prototype cigarette that would heat rather than
13       burn tobacco.  If you don't burn tobacco you don't
14       produce benzo{a}pyrene.  Test marketed.  Consumers
15       didn't like it and it went nowhere.  But it
16       lowered many of the constituents in cigarettes
17       that were associated with various diseases and
18       carcinogenesis.  Effort in the 1980s.
19           Now, the purpose of punitive damages is to
20       deter future misconduct.  You've heard that R.J.
21       Reynolds admits that smoking causes disease,
22       including one in this case.  You've heard that
23       R.J. Reynolds admits that smoking is addictive.
24       You saw the Reynolds website as it currently
25       exists.

 1           And the days that Dr. Proctor talked about,
 2       but never showed us, examples of sliming, he said,
 3       public health authorities.  Here you have the
 4       Tobacco Company with links on its website telling
 5       and telling its customers that they should rely on
 6       the conclusions of the U.S. Surgeon General, the
 7       Centers for Disease Control and other public
 8       health and medical officials when making decisions
 9       regarding smoking.  And if they need to know what
10       that advice is, there are links on its website to
11       all those -- all those sources you see there,
12       including several Surgeon General's Report, the
13       National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer
14       Society and the American Heart Association.
15           And you heard that Reynolds has a database, a
16       document database of all the litigation; documents
17       such as you saw in this case.
18           When this case is over and you're freed from
19       the obligation that Judge Hulslander pulled on you
20       not to do outside research, when this case is
21       over, you can log on, anybody with the internet,
22       anybody with a computer, and you could read all
23       about anything you want to read about.  Claude
24       Teague, Alan Rodgman, Philip Morris, anybody.
25       It's all publicly available on the R.J. Reynolds

 1       website.  No secrets.  RJR.com. 
 2           Is this a reckless disregard for human life?
 3       Is this clear and convincing evidence?
 4           I'd argue to you that this record is not one
 5       that warrants money damages above and beyond
 6       compensatory.  Punitive damages, I would suggest
 7       to you, should not be available in this case.
 8           Mr. Alexander was, by all accounts, a smart
 9       man; a smart man who made choices throughout his
10       life.  Some of those choices were related to
11       smoking.
12           The choice to smoke was made in another era
13       and a time and a place lost to history.  He
14       started with chewing tobacco given to him by his
15       parents and he continued to smoke, and made a
16       decision to continue to smoke every time he lit up
17       a cigarette.  And he made that decision for 30
18       years while a warning label cautioned him against
19       the risks of what he was about to do.
20           We should respect those choices.
21       Mr. Alexander was not a victim during his life.
22       I'd ask you not to make him a victim after his
23       death.
24           Now, this is only chance I get to speak to
25       you.  The plaintiff has the burden of proof so

 1       they get a chance at rebuttal.  I have no idea
 2       what Mr. Smith's going to say.  But because I
 3       can't respond to him, I would ask one of you to be
 4       my advocate in the jury room and respond as I
 5       might so we can have everything on the table,
 6       everything aired as you decide to make your very
 7       important decisions as the finders of fact in this
 8       case.
 9           Once again, thank you for your service.  Thank
10       you in advance for your work and deliberation in
11       arriving at a verdict.  And I guess once we get
12       done here, it's going to be lunch time.  Thanks a
13       lot.
